So for each test case, we read n, convert it to integer, then compute r as n divided by 100. Then calculate 1 plus the sum of the conditions. Wait, let's think about how the conditions work. Let's take examples. If the rating is 2300: r = 2300/100 = 23. So r <19 is False (0), r <16 is False (0), r <14 is False (0). So 1 + 0 +0 +0 =1. Correct division 1.

Division 2: 1600 <= rating <=1899 \u2192 r is 16 to 18.999. So r<19 is True (1), r<16 is False (0), r<14 is False (0). Sum is 1. 1+1=2. Correct. Division 3: 1400-1599 \u2192 r 14 to 15.999.

Wait, maybe the loop is supposed to handle multiple test cases.\n\nThe problem statement says the input starts with t, the number of test cases. So the code must read t, then process each test case.

For each iteration, read a rating. Then compute the division.\n\nWait, the code uses n as the rating. Because in the line r=int(n)/100, n is the input line. So for each test case, we read n, convert it to integer, then compute r as n divided by 100. Then calculate 1 plus the sum of the conditions.\n\nWait, let's think about how the conditions work. Let's take examples.\n\nIf the rating is 2300: r = 2300/100 = 23. So r <19 is False (0), r <16 is False (0), r <14 is False (0). So 1 + 0 +0 +0 =1. Correct division 1.\n\nFor a rating of 1679: 1679/100 is 16.79. r is 16.79. Check the conditions:\n\nr <19? 16.79 <19 \u2192 True (1). Then r <16? 16.79 <16 \u2192 False (0). r <14? Also False.

Wait, but in Python, dividing by 100 could be a float. For example, if n is 1679, then 1679/100 is 16.79. But when we cast to int(n), then 1679 is converted to integer, then divided by 100 \u2192 16.79 as a float.\n\nBut when checking conditions like r <19, for 16.79, which is less than 19, that's True.
