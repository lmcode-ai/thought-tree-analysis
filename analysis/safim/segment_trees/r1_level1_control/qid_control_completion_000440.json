Because that would trigger the need for a new operation. Let me check the sample input. First sample test case:\n\nn=2, p_2=1. l_1=1, r_1=1. l_2=2, r_2=2. Processing i=2 first. For node 2, mx[2] is 0. Then, since 0 < a[2][0] (which is 2), condition is true. So ans increases by 1. b[2] = a[2][1] = 2. Then, parent is 1. mx[1] is min(a[1][1] (1), 0 + 2 = 2. So mx[1] is 1. Then processing i=1. Check condition: mx[1] is 1. a[1][0] is 1. So 1 >= 1, so condition is false. b[1] is mx[1] =1. Then, since i=1, the loop ends. The ans is 1, which matches the sample. Second sample:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3. p_2=1, p_3=2. l_1=5, r_1=5. l_2=3, r_2=3. l_3=7, r_3=7. Processing nodes 3,2,1. Processing node 3: mx[3] is 0. Check if 0 < 7. Yes. So ans becomes 1. b[3] =7. Parent is 2. mx[2] is min(3, 0 +7) \u21923. Processing node 2: mx[2] is 3. Check if 3 <3? No. So b[2] =3. Parent is 1. mx[1] is min(5, 0+3=3). So mx[1] is 3. Processing node 1: mx[1] is 3. a[1][0] is 5. 3 <5 \u2192 yes. So ans becomes 2. b[1] =5. So the ans is 2, which matches the sample. So the condition is checking if mx[i] < a[i][0].

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the missing condition in the if statement here. The code is supposed to calculate the minimum number of operations required to make each a_v between l_v and r_v. \n\nThe approach here seems to be processing the tree from the leaves up, maybe in a post-order traversal. The loop starts from i=n down to 1. For each node, if the condition is met, then set b[i] to a[i][1] and increment the answer. Otherwise, set b[i] to mx[i]. Then, the parent's mx is updated by taking the minimum of their own a[fa][1] and mx[fa] + b[i]. \n\nWait, what's mx and b here? Let me think. The variables might represent some constraints on the increments. Since each operation affects the path from root to a node, maybe the algorithm tracks the maximum possible contribution that can be applied to a node and propagate it upwards.\n\nThe key idea here is that each operation can be thought of as adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. To minimize the number of operations, we want to cover as many nodes as possible with each operation. \n\nThe problem might be determining when a node needs a new operation. For a node v, if the required upper bound (r_v) is less than the accumulated maximum possible from the children (mx[v]), then we can't carry over the previous operations and need a new one. \n\nWait, the code has a[i][0] and a[i][1], which are l_i and r_i. The mx array probably keeps track of the maximum possible value that can be contributed by the operations applied to the subtree below the current node. For each node i, when processing, we check if the current mx (from children) is insufficient to meet the lower or upper bound. \n\nWait, the condition in the if statement is probably checking whether the lower bound of the current node is greater than the accumulated maximum possible (mx[i]). Because if the lower bound is higher than what can be contributed by the children, then we need a new operation here. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The variables:\n\nb[i] is set to a[i][1] (the upper bound) if the condition is true. Otherwise, it's mx[i]. Then, for the parent fa, mx[fa] is updated as min of a[fa][1] and mx[fa] + b[i]. \n\nHmm. So, mx[fa] accumulates the possible contributions from its children. If the current node's required maximum (r_i) is less than the required contributions from its children, then we have to start a new operation here. \n\nWait, maybe the condition is whether the lower bound of the current node (a[i][0]) is greater than the maximum possible value that can be contributed by the parent's operations. Because if the lower bound is higher than what the parent's path can provide, then we need to perform an operation here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is checking if the accumulated maximum (mx[i]) is less than the node's lower bound (a[i][0]). Because if mx[i] is less than l_i, then the current contributions are insufficient, and a new operation must be added to reach at least l_i. But since the operation can add up, perhaps we need to check if the accumulated maximum can't reach the lower bound, which would necessitate a new operation. \n\nWait, but in the code, when the condition is true, we set b[i] to the upper bound. So, perhaps the condition is when the upper bound of the current node is lower than the required minimum. No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, think of mx[i] as the maximum possible value that can be added to the node through operations on its descendants. Then, the node's own required a[i][0] must be covered by either the accumulated mx[i] or a new operation. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the sum of the operations' contributions along the path must result in a_v between l_v and r_v. So for each node, the sum of all c_i's from operations that include it in their path must be >= l_v and <= r_v. \n\nEach operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. So, the sum of the increments from all operations along the path must be within [l_v, r_v]. \n\nThe approach here seems to be for each node, track the maximum possible value that can be added to it by operations in the subtree. If this maximum is insufficient to meet the lower bound, then a new operation is needed. \n\nWait, but the code is processing nodes from the bottom up. For each node i, when processing it, if the condition is true, we have to create a new operation. Then, the b[i] is set to the upper bound (a[i][1]) in that case. Then, the parent's mx is updated by taking the min of their own upper bound and the sum of their current mx plus the b[i]. \n\nSo mx[fa] represents the maximum possible value that can be added to the parent through operations in the subtree. For each child i of fa, when processing i, the contribution from i's subtree is b[i], and mx[fa] is the minimum of its own upper bound and the accumulated sum of mx[fa] (which starts at 0) plus b[i]. \n\nWait, mx[fa] is initialized to 0 for each node. Then, for each child i of fa, mx[fa] = min( a[fa][1], mx[fa] + b[i] ). \n\nSo, mx[fa] accumulates the sum of the maximum possible contributions from each child, but can't exceed the parent's own upper bound. \n\nSo, when processing a child i, the parent's mx is being built by adding the child's contribution (b[i]). But since the parent's operations can't contribute more than their own upper bound, this is capped. \n\nSo, for the current node i, the condition in the if statement is whether the maximum possible contribution (mx[i]) from the subtree is less than the node's lower bound (a[i][0]). Because if mx[i] < a[i][0], then even the maximum possible contributions from the subtree's operations can't reach the lower bound. So, we need to perform an additional operation here. \n\nIn that case, when we add a new operation, the maximum contribution for this node becomes its upper bound (since the operation's c array is non-decreasing, the maximum possible contribution for this node is a[i][1]). So, the code sets b[i] = a[i][1], and increments the answer. \n\nOtherwise, if the mx[i] (from subtree operations) is >= a[i][0], then we don't need a new operation. We can use the existing contributions, but we take the minimum between mx[i] and the upper bound. Wait, no. Because the code sets b[i] = mx[i] in that case. \n\nWait, no. Let's think again. For the current node i, during processing:\n\nIf the condition is true, we set b[i] to a[i][1] (the maximum possible contribution via a new operation). Then, ans increases by 1. Else, we set b[i] to mx[i], which is the accumulated maximum from the subtree. \n\nBut mx[i] for the node is initially 0, but perhaps after processing children, it's updated. Wait, no. The code has mx[i] initialized to 0. Then, for each child of i, when processing them, they update mx[i]. \n\nWait, the code starts processing from i = n down to 1. So for a node i, after processing all its children (since the children have higher numbers?), but no, the parent of i is p_i, which is less than i. So, processing in reverse order (from n to 1) ensures that all children of i have been processed before i. \n\nWait, no. For example, node 2's parent is 1. So when processing i=2, the parent is 1. So the code processes nodes from n down to 1. So each node's children are processed before the node itself. Because the parent of a node is always less than the node. \n\nSo for each node i, when processing it, all its children (since their indices are higher than i) have already been processed. \n\nSo mx[i] is initially 0. Then, for each child j of i, during their processing, they update their parent's mx (mx[i] = min(a[i][1], mx[i] + b[j])). \n\nSo mx[i] accumulates the maximum possible contributions from all children. Then, when processing node i, the code checks if mx[i] is less than a[i][0]. If so, then even with all the contributions from children, the sum is not enough to reach the lower bound, so a new operation is needed. \n\nSo the condition in the if statement should be: if mx[i] < a[i][0]. Because if the accumulated maximum from children is less than the lower bound, then we need to add an operation here. \n\nBut wait, when adding an operation here, the contribution to the node is up to a[i][1]. But since the lower bound is a[i][0], which is <= a[i][1], this would allow the sum (from the new operation) to meet the lower bound. \n\nSo the missing condition is: if (mx[i] < a[i][0]). Because that would trigger the need for a new operation. \n\nLet me check the sample input. \n\nFirst sample test case:\n\nn=2, p_2=1. l_1=1, r_1=1. l_2=2, r_2=2.\n\nProcessing i=2 first. For node 2, mx[2] is 0. Then, since 0 < a[2][0] (which is 2), condition is true. So ans increases by 1. b[2] = a[2][1] = 2. Then, parent is 1. mx[1] is min(a[1][1] (1), 0 + 2 = 2. So mx[1] is 1. \n\nThen processing i=1. Check condition: mx[1] is 1. a[1][0] is 1. So 1 >= 1, so condition is false. b[1] is mx[1] =1. Then, since i=1, the loop ends. The ans is 1, which matches the sample. \n\nSecond sample:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3. p_2=1, p_3=2. \n\nl_1=5, r_1=5. l_2=3, r_2=3. l_3=7, r_3=7.\n\nProcessing nodes 3,2,1.\n\nProcessing node 3: mx[3] is 0. Check if 0 < 7. Yes. So ans becomes 1. b[3] =7. Parent is 2. mx[2] is min(3, 0 +7) \u21923.\n\nProcessing node 2: mx[2] is 3. Check if 3 <3? No. So b[2] =3. Parent is 1. mx[1] is min(5, 0+3=3). So mx[1] is 3.\n\nProcessing node 1: mx[1] is 3. a[1][0] is 5. 3 <5 \u2192 yes. So ans becomes 2. b[1] =5. \n\nSo the ans is 2, which matches the sample. \n\nSo the condition is checking if mx[i] < a[i][0]. Thus, the missing code in the if statement is mx[i] < a[i][0]."
