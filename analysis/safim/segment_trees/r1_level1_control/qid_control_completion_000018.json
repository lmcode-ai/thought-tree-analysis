But in this approach, when processing i, we assume that a_j can be as small as possible, so a_i can leave some bits unset (assuming a_j will set them). However, this may not be possible once a_j is processed. Alternatively, the code's approach is to process the elements in order, and for each element i, set m[i] as the minimal possible value based on the current state of M[j] (which for j < i is the actual a_j, and for j >=i is the maximum allowed bits). So, for each (j, x) in L[i], the code checks whether j is less than i. If j < i, then M[j] is the actual a_j (since it's already been processed). So, in that case, a_i must set any bits in x that are not set in a_j, because a_j's value is fixed. If j >= i, then M[j] is the maximum possible a_j. But since we want a_i to be as small as possible, we can assume that a_j will set those bits in x that are not already required by a_i. Therefore, a_i can set as few bits as possible. But how to model this. The code's missing condition is in the if statement. The code says:\n\nif # TODO: Your code here\n    m[i] |= x ^ M[j]\nelse:\n    m[i] = x\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is whether j has already been processed. So if j < i, then the code should do m[i] |= x ^ M[j], else m[i] = x. But how does that make sense. Wait, x ^ M[j] gives the bits that are set in x but not in M[j].",

For each constraint (i, j, x), if j has already been processed (j <i), then a_i must include the bits in x that are not set in a_j. For constraints where j >=i, the code sets m[i] to x, but that's not correct. So perhaps that's not the right approach. But in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n1 2 3\n\n2 3 3\n\n2 4 3\n\nSample Output:\n\n2 1 2 2\n\nIn the code's processing: For each query, M[i] and M[j] are ANDed with x. So for the first query (1,2,3) (0-based 0,1,3):\n\nM[0] &=3 (binary 11), M[1] &=3. For the second query (2,3,3) (1,2,3):\n\nM[1] &=3, M[2] &=3. Third query (2,4,3) (1,3,3): M[1] &=3, M[3] &=3. So after processing all queries, M for each element is:\n\nM[0] = 3 (from first query), M[1] = 3 (since all queries involve x=3), M[2] =3, M[3]=3. Then, during the loop over each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nL[0] contains (1,3) (from the first query). So for (j, x) = (1,3). Since j=1, which is >=i=0 (since i starts at 0, j=1 >=0). So the code checks if j <i? 1 <0 is false. So the else clause is executed: m[i] = x=3. Then M[0] is set to 3.\n\ni=1: L[1] contains (0,3), (2,3), (3,3). For each (j, x) in these:\n\nFirst (0,3). j=0 < 1. So the if condition is true. So m[1] |= x ^ M[j]. x is 3, M[j] is 3. 3 ^3 is 0. So m[1] remains 0. Next (2,3). j=2 > =1. So else clause: m[1] =3. Next (3,3). j=3 >=1. else clause: m[1] =3 again. So after processing, m[1] is 3. Then M[1] is set to 3. But sample output is a_1=1 (0-based?), wait the sample output is [2,1,2,2]. Wait the sample input's output is 2 1 2 2. But in 0-based indices, the elements are a_0=2, a_1=1, a_2=2, a_3=2. But according to this code, after processing i=1, m[1] is 3. Then M[1] becomes 3. How does this code reach the sample output? Hmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. The code's approach must be correct given the problem statement, but the missing condition is not j <i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (i == j). Because in some cases, when i and j are the same, like in a query (i,i,x), which requires that a_i | a_i =x, i.e., a_i =x. But that's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is (i ==j), but that's unlikely.",

So perhaps the code uses the maximum possible a_j (M[j]) and sets a_i's bits to x ^ M[j], which would be the bits that a_j can't have. So a_i must set those bits.

But then, when a_j is processed, it may not have them, leading to a violation of the constraint. This is a problem. So how can the code ensure that all constraints are satisfied while building the lex smallest array? Perhaps the code is using a greedy approach, setting each a_i to the minimal possible value based on the constraints from j <i and the maximum allowed for j >=i. Then, for j >=i, when they are processed, they will take into account the bits that were set in a_i. But this requires that during the processing of i, for j >=i, the code doesn't have to set those bits in a_i, because a_j will set them when processed. But how can that be ensured? Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect as given, and the missing condition is (i != j). But that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the code's missing condition is whether (x & M[j]) ==x.",

But in the code, the condition is missing, and the code has an if-else. So perhaps the code is trying to handle the case where the constraint is between the same element (i and j are the same). For example, if a query is (i,i,x), then a_i | a_i =x, so a_i =x. So for such a query, x must be a subset of M[i], and a_i must be x. But the code's current structure would process this as two entries in L[i], (i, x) and (i, x), leading to multiple updates. Alternatively, perhaps the code's condition is checking whether i ==j, and in that case, set m[i] =x, else set m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. But that's not clear. But in the sample input, let's see. The code's processing for i=0:\n\nFor each (j, x) in L[i] (which includes j=1, x=3). Since j=1 >=i=0 (assuming i starts at 0), the code's else clause is executed: m[i] =x=3. But sample output's first element is 2. So this is conflicting. But in the sample input, the code's current logic would set m[0] to 3, but the correct output is 2. So this suggests that the code's current logic is incorrect, and the missing condition must be different. So perhaps the code's missing condition is not checking whether j is less than i, but something else. Another approach: the lex smallest array requires that each element is as small as possible.",

Therefore, for all constraints (i,j,x), regardless of j's index, a_i must set the bits x ^ M[j]. So the code's if condition is not needed; it should always do m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. But the sample code has an else clause. So perhaps the code's condition is checking whether x ^ M[j] is non-zero. If it is, then OR, else do something else. But in the sample input, when processing i=0, j=1, x=3, and M[j] is 3 (since j=1's M is initialized to 3). So x ^ M[j] is 0. So m[i] |=0, so m[i] remains 0. Then, for other constraints involving i=0, but in the sample input, there's only one query involving i=0. So m[0] would be 0. But the sample output's first element is 2. So this is conflicting. Hmm.

So perhaps the code is missing a condition that determines when to OR and when to set. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is whether a_i's current value is zero. Because initially, m[i] is 0. If after processing all constraints, the bits are added. But in the sample, for i=0, j=1, x=3. Then, x ^ M[j] is 0. So m[0] remains 0, then M[0] is set to 0. But sample output's a_0 is 2.

But if a_0 is 0, a_1 must be 3. But in the sample, a_1 is 1, which is allowed because a_0 is 2. So the code's current approach is not correctly handling the cases where a_j can have a smaller value. The key is that during processing i=0, the code must set a_0 to the minimal value such that for all constraints (i,j,x), a_i's bits include x's bits not present in the minimal possible a_j. But how to compute the minimal possible a_j when j hasn't been processed yet. This is tricky. The code's current approach for j >=i is to set a_i to x, which is not correct. Alternative idea: The code should set a_i's bits to the AND of all (x ^ M[j]) for all constraints (i,j,x). This would ensure that a_i has all the required bits. But in the sample, for i=0 and j=1, x=3. M[j] is 3. x ^ M[j] is 0. So a_i would have 0. But the sample's a_0 is 2. So this isn't correct. So this approach is not working. Alternative approach inspired by the problem's note that the lex smallest array is desired. So, for each bit from high to low, and for each element from left to right, determine if the bit can be set to 0. This is a standard approach for lex smallest problems.",

Alternatively, the code's missing condition is whether (i ==j), and for those cases, set m[i] to x. But again, this doesn't fit the sample. Alternatively, the code's missing condition is (x & (x ^ M[j])) ! =0. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the code's missing condition is (x & ~M[j]) ! =0. Which would be true if x has bits not in M[j], which requires a_i to set those bits. But in the sample's case, x=3, M[j]=3. So x & ~M[j] is 0. So the condition is false, so else clause is executed: m[i] =x. But this would set a_0 to 3, which is incorrect. But sample's a_0 is 2. So this suggests that the code's approach is not correct.",

But M[j] is the intersection of all x's that j is involved in. So if M[j] has bit k unset, then all x's involving j have bit k unset. So a_j cannot set bit k. Therefore, a_i must set it. So, for each constraint (i,j,x), the bits that a_i must set are x & ~M[j]. So, for all constraints (i,j,x), the a_i must include the bits x & ~M[j]. This must be done for all constraints involving i. So, the a_i is the OR of all x & ~M[j] for all j in L[i]. This can be computed by initializing a_i to 0, then OR'ing all x & ~M[j] for each constraint. So, in code, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nfor (j, x) in L[i]:\n\n    m[i] |= (x & ~M[j]) Then, set M[i] = m[i]\n\nBut this approach would compute the minimal possible a_i. But in the sample: For i=0, j=1, x=3. M[j] is 3. ~M[j] is 0x3fffff00... (assuming 32 bits). So x & ~M[j] is 3 & ~3 =0. So m[i] remains 0. Then, M[0] =0. For i=1, j=0, x=3. M[j] is 0. ~M[j] is all ones. x & ~M[j] is 3 & all ones =3. So m[1] |=3 \u21923. j=2, x=3. M[j] is3. x&~3 =0. j=3, x=3. M[j] is3. x&~3=0. So m[1] remains 3. M[1] is3. For i=2, j=1, x=3. M[j] is3. x&~3=0. So m[2] remains 0. M[2] is0.\n\nFor i=3, j=1, x=3. M[j] is3. x&~3=0. So m[3] remains 0. M[3] is0. Resulting array [0,3,0,0]. Not correct. But sample output is [2,1,2,2]. So this approach is not working. So where is the mistake? Because according to the constraints, a_0 | a_1 must be 3. But in the computed array, a_0 is 0 and a_1 is3. 0|3=3, which is correct. But sample output's a_0 is 2. So why is this allowed? Because the code's approach computes a valid array, but not the lex smallest one. The lex smallest array is the earliest possible element to be as small as possible. In the computed array, a_0 is 0, which is smaller than the sample's a_0=2, but why isn't that array considered valid?\n\nBecause the sample's array must also satisfy the other constraints. Wait, the sample has three constraints:\n\n1. a_0 | a_1 =3\n\n2. a_1 | a_2 =3\n\n3. a_1 | a_3 =3. The code's computed array [0,3,0,0] satisfies:\n\n0 |3 =3.\n\n3 |0 =3.\n\n3 |0 =3. So it satisfies all constraints. But the sample's output is [2,1,2,2], which is lex larger than [0,3,0,0]. But according to the problem statement, the sample output is one of the possible valid arrays. So why is the code's approach not producing the lex smallest array. Ah! Because there's another constraint that I'm missing.",

But according to the sample input description, there are three queries. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the sample output is not the lex smallest array. But that's impossible. Wait, the sample input's output is [2,1,2,2]. Let's check if this array satisfies all constraints:\n\na_0 | a_1 = 2 |1 =3 \u2192 correct. a_1 |a_2 =1 |2 =3 \u2192 correct. a_1 |a_3 =1 |2 =3 \u2192 correct. So it's valid. But the array [0,3,0,0] is also valid and lex smaller. So why isn't it the correct answer. This implies that the problem statement's sample output is incorrect, which is impossible. Therefore, my analysis must be wrong. Ah!",

This is a contradiction. But according to the problem statement, the sample output is correct. So perhaps the array [0,3,0,0] is not valid. But why?\n\nBecause of other constraints. For example, after processing the queries, M[i] is the AND of all x's involving i.\n\nFor the sample input:\n\ni=0's constraints: only query 1 (x=3). So M[0] is 3.\n\ni=1's constraints: queries 1, 2, 3 (x=3 each). So M[1] is 3.\n\ni=2's constraints: query 2 (x=3). So M[2] is3.\n\ni=3's constraints: query 3 (x=3). So M[3] is3.\n\nSo for a_i to be valid, it must be a subset of M[i]. So a_0 is 0, which is a subset of M[0]=3. a_1=3 is subset of 3. a_2=0 is subset of 3. a_3=0 is subset of3. So all are valid. So why isn't this the correct answer?\n\nAh! Because the problem requires that all constraints are satisfied, but also that the array is the lex smallest possible.",

So the code's missing condition must be something that allows the code to generate the correct array. But what is the missing condition? After a long time of analysis, I think the correct condition is (i != j). Because when i ==j, the code should set m[i] to x. Otherwise, m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. But in the sample input, there are no queries where i ==j. So this condition wouldn't affect the sample. Alternatively, perhaps the code's missing condition is (i <j). Because during processing i, if j is greater than i, then the code sets m[i] to x. But in the sample, for i=0 and j=1 (i <j), the else clause would set m[0] to x=3. But this would result in a_0=3, which doesn't align with the sample output. This is a dead end. At this point, I'm forced to make an educated guess based on the code's structure and the problem's requirements. The code's missing condition is (j <i), which allows processing j's that have already been processed. For j >=i, the code sets m[i] to x. But in the sample, this leads to a_0=3. Which is not correct. But the sample's a_0=2.\n\nTherefore, the code's approach must be incorrect. But given the code provided, the missing condition must be (i <j), but this doesn't fit the sample. Alternatively, the code's missing condition is (i <j), and the code should set m[i] |=x ^ M[j] for j <i, and for j >=i, do something else. But this is not working.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to fill in the missing condition in the if statement. Let's look at the code structure. \n\nThe code initializes two arrays, m and M. m starts as all zeros, and M starts as all 2^30-1 (which is 0b111...111, 30 bits). Then, for each query, M[i] and M[j] are updated by ANDing with x. This probably sets the maximum possible bits for each element. The L array is storing the connections between elements based on the OR conditions.\n\nThen, there's a loop over each i, and for each (j, x) in L[i], there's a condition to check. The code inside the if block is m[i] |= x ^ M[j], else set m[i] to x. \n\nWait, the goal is to find the lex smallest array a that satisfies all a_i | a_j = x for each query. The lex smallest means that we want the earliest elements to be as small as possible. \n\nHmm. The approach here seems to be to determine for each bit, whether it can be turned off in a[i] to make the array lex smaller. But how?\n\nThe variables M might represent the maximum possible value each element can take. Because initially, M is all 1s, and for each constraint, M[i] is ANDed with x. So after processing all constraints, M[i] would have all the bits that must be set in a[i], because a[i] | a[j] = x implies that any bit set in x must be set in a[i] or a[j]. So for each a[i], the bits not set in x can't be set in a[i] or a[j]. Wait, no. If x's bit k is 0, then both a[i] and a[j] must have bit k 0. Because OR of two numbers has bit k set only if at least one has it. So if x's bit k is 0, both a[i] and a[j] must have that bit 0. So the M[i] is tracking the bits that are allowed to be set. Wait, perhaps M[i] is the bits that a[i] can possibly have. So initially, all bits are allowed, but each query (i,j,x) would require that the bits in x must include all the bits in a[i] OR a[j]. Wait, no. Wait, the OR of a_i and a_j is x. So any bit set in x must be set in at least one of a_i or a_j. Conversely, any bit not set in x must not be set in either a_i or a_j.\n\nSo for all bits not set in x, both a_i and a_j must have those bits unset. Therefore, after processing all queries, M[i] would have those bits turned off that can't be set in a[i]. Because whenever there's a query (i,j,x), for each bit not set in x, both i and j must have that bit turned off. So M[i] is the AND of all x's from the queries where i is involved, and similarly for M[j]. Wait, but each query (i,j,x) contributes x to both M[i] and M[j], via M[i] &= x and M[j] &= x. But x is the OR of a_i and a_j. So x has all the bits that are set in either a_i or a_j. But when we process all queries, each M[i] is the intersection of all x's where i is involved in a query. But how does this ensure that the bits not set in x are turned off? Because for any query involving i and j, if x has a bit not set, then both a_i and a_j must have that bit off. So all x's in queries involving i must have that bit set (if a_i has that bit on), but if there's a query where x has that bit not set, then a_i must have that bit off. So by ANDing all x's in which i appears, M[i] would have all the bits that are allowed to be set in a_i.\n\nWait, perhaps M[i] is the set of bits that can be set in a_i. Because for each query (i,j,x), a_i's bits must be a subset of x's bits, since a_i | a_j = x. So a_i can't have any bits set that aren't in x. Therefore, for each query involving i, M[i] is ANDed with x. So after all queries, M[i] is the intersection of all x's from the queries that i was involved in, which gives the bits that are allowed to be set in a_i. Because if in any query, i's x didn't have a certain bit, then a_i can't have that bit set. So M[i] gives the maximum possible bits a_i can have.\n\nThen, the m array is initialized to 0, which is the minimal possible value. Then, during the loop for each i, processing all (j, x) pairs in L[i], which are the queries that i was involved in. \n\nThe code's next part is for each i, processing the constraints. For each (j, x) in L[i], the code checks some condition. If the condition is met, m[i] is ORed with x ^ M[j], else set m[i] to x. Then, after processing all (j, x) pairs, M[i] is set to m[i].\n\nWait, but M[i] was previously the maximum allowed bits for a_i. Now, after processing, M[i] is set to m[i], which is the current value of a_i. Hmm.\n\nThe key is to find for each a_i the minimal possible value, given the constraints, and the lex order.\n\nThe lex smallest array requires that the first differing element is as small as possible. So for each element, we want to set the bits as low as possible, starting from the first element.\n\nBut how to model this in the code.\n\nThe approach here seems to be to set bits in a_i to 0 if possible. For each bit in a_i, we can set it to 0 unless there's a constraint that requires it to be 1.\n\nBut the constraints are that a_i | a_j = x. So for each bit k in x, at least one of a_i or a_j must have bit k set. For a bit not in x, both must have it 0.\n\nSo after processing the M array, which is the allowed bits (all x's ANDed for the queries involving the element), we can then decide for each bit whether it can be set to 0 in a_i.\n\nBut since the array is lex order, for each element, we want to set as many higher bits to 0 as possible, but perhaps the order is from left to right, and for each element, setting the bits to 0 as much as possible.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nAfter initializing M as the allowed bits (all bits that could possibly be set in a_i), the code then processes each element i, and for each (j, x) in L[i], it checks some condition. If the condition is true, then m[i] (the current value of a_i) is ORed with x ^ M[j]. Otherwise, m[i] is set to x.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that for the constraints a_i | a_j = x, once we have M[j] (the allowed bits for a_j), then x ^ M[j] would be the bits that must be set in a_i. Because x is a_i | a_j. If M[j] is the maximum possible bits for a_j, then x ^ M[j] would be the bits that are in x but not in M[j]. But M[j] is the allowed bits for a_j, which must be a subset of x's bits (since in any query (j, ...), x must have the bits allowed for j). Wait, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal possible a_i. For each constraint (i, j, x), since a_i | a_j = x, once a_j's bits are determined (as M[j]?), then a_i must have the bits that are in x but not already set in a_j. Because if a_j's bits are fixed, then a_i can have those bits that are in x, but can leave some bits unset as long as a_j has them. But to make a_i as small as possible, we can set as few bits as possible.\n\nBut since the code is trying to build the lex smallest array, perhaps for each a_i, we want to set the bits that are necessary. For example, if in any constraint (i, j, x), the bit k is set in x and a_j doesn't have that bit set (since we're trying to set a_j to be as small as possible), then a_i must have that bit set.\n\nSo the code is processing each i and for each constraint (i, j, x), checking whether a_j (M[j]) has the bit set. If not, then a_i must set that bit. But since M[j] is the maximum allowed bits for a_j, perhaps when we process a_i, M[j] hasn't been finalized yet, because it's processed in a loop.\n\nWait, the code loops through each i in 0 to n-1, and for each (j, x) in L[i], which is all the constraints that involve i. Then, during this loop, for each (j, x), the code checks a condition. If that condition is true, then m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. Else, m[i] is set to x.\n\nAfter processing all (j, x) pairs for i, M[i] is set to m[i].\n\nSo perhaps the condition is checking if a_j has already been processed. Wait, but in the loop, i is processed in order from 0 to n-1. So for j less than i, M[j] would already be set to m[j], but for j >= i, M[j] is still the original maximum allowed bits.\n\nBut how does this affect the processing?\n\nThe code's logic for each i is:\n\nFor each (j, x) in L[i]:\n\n   if some condition:\n\n       m[i] |= x ^ M[j]\n\n   else:\n\n       m[i] = x\n\nBut what's the purpose of this?\n\nWait, x is the OR of a_i and a_j. So x must be equal to a_i | a_j. So a_i must have x's bits minus the bits that a_j has. Because if a_j has some bit set, then a_i can choose not to set it. But if a_j doesn't have a bit set, then a_i must set that bit (if it's in x).\n\nSo for each constraint (i,j,x), a_i must set all the bits in x that are not set in a_j.\n\nBut since we are building the lex smallest array, perhaps a_i is processed in order, and for each j that comes after i (i.e., j >= current i), we can set a_j in a way that allows a_i to be as small as possible.\n\nSo when processing i, for each (j, x) in L[i], if j has already been processed (i.e., j < i), then a_j's value is known (since we process in order), and thus a_i must set the bits in x that are not set in a_j.\n\nBut for j >= i, since they haven't been processed yet, their current M[j] is the maximum possible bits they can have. So for those, perhaps we can set a_i's bits to the minimal possible by taking into account the maximum possible a_j.\n\nWait, but the code is using M[j] which, for j >= i, hasn't been processed yet. So M[j] is the initial maximum value (the AND of all x's in their queries). Then, when processing j in order, the code will update M[j] to m[j], which is the actual value chosen.\n\nSo, during the processing of i, for each (j, x) in L[i], we have to determine if a_i needs to set a certain bit because a_j cannot set it (based on their current M[j] value). \n\nWait, perhaps the condition is whether j is less than i. Because when i is processed in order, j < i has already been processed, so their M[j] is set to m[j]. For j >= i, M[j] is the initial maximum value. \n\nSo, for a constraint (i, j, x), if j has already been processed (j < i), then we can know a_j's value. So for the OR to be x, a_i must set any bits in x that are not set in a_j. \n\nFor j >= i, since they haven't been processed, their M[j] is the maximum allowed bits. So, perhaps we can assume that a_j will take on as few bits as possible, which would require a_i to set as many bits as possible. But since we want a_i to be lex smallest, perhaps for j >= i, we can set a_i to not have to set those bits, assuming that a_j will set them. However, since j is after i in the processing order, when j is processed, they might not set those bits, which could cause a_i's value to be invalid. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let's think of an example. Suppose we have a constraint (i, j, x) where i=1 and j=2 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? The code uses 0-based since input is adjusted by subtracting 1). Let's say i is 0 and j is 1. Then, during processing i=0, j=1 hasn't been processed yet. So M[j] is the maximum allowed bits. So, for the OR to be x, a_i | a_j = x. So, any bit set in x must be set in a_i or a_j. \n\nBut since j hasn't been processed yet, when we set a_i, we want to set as few bits as possible. So for a_i, the minimal possible is to set the bits that are in x but not in the minimal possible a_j. But how do we know the minimal possible a_j? Since j hasn't been processed, perhaps we can only determine the minimal a_j when we process it. But in this approach, when processing i, we assume that a_j can be as small as possible, so a_i can leave some bits unset (assuming a_j will set them). However, this may not be possible once a_j is processed.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to process the elements in order, and for each element i, set m[i] as the minimal possible value based on the current state of M[j] (which for j < i is the actual a_j, and for j >=i is the maximum allowed bits).\n\nSo, for each (j, x) in L[i], the code checks whether j is less than i. If j < i, then M[j] is the actual a_j (since it's already been processed). So, in that case, a_i must set any bits in x that are not set in a_j, because a_j's value is fixed.\n\nIf j >= i, then M[j] is the maximum possible a_j. But since we want a_i to be as small as possible, we can assume that a_j will set those bits in x that are not already required by a_i. Therefore, a_i can set as few bits as possible.\n\nBut how to model this. \n\nThe code's missing condition is in the if statement. The code says:\n\nif # TODO: Your code here\n    m[i] |= x ^ M[j]\nelse:\n    m[i] = x\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is whether j has already been processed. So if j < i, then the code should do m[i] |= x ^ M[j], else m[i] = x. But how does that make sense.\n\nWait, x ^ M[j] gives the bits that are set in x but not in M[j]. Because M[j] is the current value (if j < i, M[j] is m[j], else it's the maximum allowed). So when j < i, M[j] is the actual a_j's value. Then, the OR of a_i and a_j must be x. So for all bits set in x, at least one of a_i or a_j must have the bit set. So if a_j (M[j]) does not have the bit set, then a_i must have it set.\n\nTherefore, for the constraint (i,j,x), the bits that a_i must set are x minus the bits set in a_j. So x ^ M[j] would be the bits that are set in x but not in M[j], which are exactly the bits that a_i must set. So, m[i] |= x ^ M[j].\n\nBut for j >=i, M[j] is the maximum allowed for a_j. So, the code is assuming that a_j can have the bits set in x. So, for a_i, if j hasn't been processed yet, the code sets m[i] to x. Wait, that would set a_i to x, which is higher than possible, but perhaps this is a placeholder. But that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition is whether j is less than i. So in the code, the missing condition is (j < i). So during the loop for i, processing each (j, x) in L[i], if j has already been processed (j < i), then we know the value of a_j (since M[j] is now m[j]). So, for those j, we must set the bits in x that are not set in a_j. So m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. For j >=i, perhaps the code is not handling them here, but when they are processed later. So the else clause (where j >=i) sets m[i] to x. But that would overwrite m[i] each time, which can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to collect all the required bits from the constraints where j is less than i. For the constraints where j is >=i, they will be handled when j is processed. So the code's missing condition is (j <i).\n\nBut then, for each (j, x) in L[i], if j <i, then a_i must set the bits that are in x but not in a_j. So, m[i] |= (x ^ M[j]). But x ^ M[j] is x XOR M[j]. Which is the same as (x | M[j]) - (x & M[j]). But wait, x is the OR of a_i and a_j. So, if a_j is known (j <i), then a_i's OR with a_j must be x. So, for all bits set in x, at least one of a_i or a_j must be set. So, if a_j (M[j]) doesn't have a bit set, then a_i must have that bit set.\n\nSo, the bits that a_i must set are x & (~M[j]). Because M[j] is a_j's current value. So, x ^ M[j] is x XOR M[j]. But x & (~M[j]) is (x XOR M[j]) & x. So perhaps x ^ M[j] gives the bits that are in x but not in M[j], or vice versa. But the bits that a_i must set are exactly x - M[j] (the bits in x that are not set in M[j]).\n\nSo, for each j <i, m[i] must include those bits. So m[i] |= (x & (~M[j])). But x ^ M[j] is (x | M[j]) - (x & M[j]). So x ^ M[j] is the combination of bits that are in x but not M[j], plus those in M[j] but not x. But since the constraint is a_i | a_j = x, and a_j is M[j], which is <=x (since in the initial processing, M[j] is the AND of all x's in which j is involved. So x's in such queries are >= a_j's possible value. Because a_j's OR with a_i is x. So a_j can't have bits set that are not in x, but x can have bits that are set in a_i or a_j.\n\nWait, but after processing all queries, M[j] is the AND of all x's that j is involved in. So M[j] is the intersection of all x's that j was in. So, for a_j to be valid, a_j must be a subset of M[j]. Because each x in a query where j is involved must be >= a_j's OR with a_i.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is:\n\nFor each element i, process all the constraints involving i. For each constraint (i, j, x), if j has already been processed (j <i), then a_i must include the bits in x that are not set in a_j. For constraints where j >=i, the code sets m[i] to x, but that's not correct. So perhaps that's not the right approach.\n\nBut in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n1 2 3\n\n2 3 3\n\n2 4 3\n\nSample Output:\n\n2 1 2 2\n\nIn the code's processing:\n\nFor each query, M[i] and M[j] are ANDed with x. So for the first query (1,2,3) (0-based 0,1,3):\n\nM[0] &=3 (binary 11), M[1] &=3. For the second query (2,3,3) (1,2,3):\n\nM[1] &=3, M[2] &=3. Third query (2,4,3) (1,3,3): M[1] &=3, M[3] &=3.\n\nSo after processing all queries, M for each element is:\n\nM[0] = 3 (from first query), M[1] = 3 (since all queries involve x=3), M[2] =3, M[3]=3.\n\nThen, during the loop over each i:\n\ni=0:\n\nL[0] contains (1,3) (from the first query). So for (j, x) = (1,3). Since j=1, which is >=i=0 (since i starts at 0, j=1 >=0). So the code checks if j <i? 1 <0 is false. So the else clause is executed: m[i] = x=3. Then M[0] is set to 3.\n\ni=1:\n\nL[1] contains (0,3), (2,3), (3,3). For each (j, x) in these:\n\nFirst (0,3). j=0 <1. So the if condition is true. So m[1] |= x ^ M[j]. x is 3, M[j] is 3. 3 ^3 is 0. So m[1] remains 0. \n\nNext (2,3). j=2 >=1. So else clause: m[1] =3. \n\nNext (3,3). j=3 >=1. else clause: m[1] =3 again. So after processing, m[1] is 3. Then M[1] is set to 3.\n\nBut sample output is a_1=1 (0-based?), wait the sample output is [2,1,2,2]. Wait the sample input's output is 2 1 2 2. But in 0-based indices, the elements are a_0=2, a_1=1, a_2=2, a_3=2.\n\nBut according to this code, after processing i=1, m[1] is 3. Then M[1] becomes 3. How does this code reach the sample output?\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. The code's approach must be correct given the problem statement, but the missing condition is not j <i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (i == j). Because in some cases, when i and j are the same, like in a query (i,i,x), which requires that a_i | a_i =x, i.e., a_i =x. But that's a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (i ==j), but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, the condition is (i < j). But that would only process pairs where i is before j.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is (j < i). Because when processing i, if j has already been processed (j <i), then M[j] is the actual a_j. So for those j, the code must set the bits in a_i that are in x but not in a_j. For j >=i, since their M[j] is the maximum allowed, the code can't determine yet. So perhaps the code uses the maximum possible a_j (M[j]) and sets a_i's bits to x ^ M[j], which would be the bits that a_j can't have. So a_i must set those bits. But wait, M[j] is the maximum allowed for a_j, but a_j could be smaller. So this could over-set bits in a_i, leading to a non-minimal array.\n\nAlternatively, the code should set a_i's bits to x & (~M[j]) for j >=i, but since M[j] is the maximum allowed for a_j, and we want a_i to be as small as possible, perhaps we can leave those bits unset in a_i, assuming that a_j will have them. But then, when a_j is processed, it may not have them, leading to a violation of the constraint.\n\nThis is a problem. So how can the code ensure that all constraints are satisfied while building the lex smallest array?\n\nPerhaps the code is using a greedy approach, setting each a_i to the minimal possible value based on the constraints from j <i and the maximum allowed for j >=i. Then, for j >=i, when they are processed, they will take into account the bits that were set in a_i.\n\nBut this requires that during the processing of i, for j >=i, the code doesn't have to set those bits in a_i, because a_j will set them when processed. But how can that be ensured?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect as given, and the missing condition is (i != j). But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's missing condition is whether (x & M[j]) ==x. Because if M[j] includes all the bits of x, then a_j can be set to x, which would allow a_i to be 0. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, think of x ^ M[j] as the bits that are in x but not in M[j]. Because x is the OR of a_i and a_j. So if M[j] is the maximum allowed a_j, then x ^ M[j] is x & (~M[j]). So for a_i, to ensure that a_i | a_j >=x, but since a_j can have up to M[j], the minimal a_i would be x & (~M[j]). Because if a_j has all the bits allowed by M[j], then a_i must have the bits in x that are not in M[j]. But since the code is building a_i's value, perhaps the condition is to check if M[j] includes all bits of x, i.e., if (M[j] | x) == M[j]. If not, then a_i must set those bits.\n\nWait, but M[j] is the AND of all x's in which j is involved. So M[j] is a subset of all x's for j's constraints. So if a constraint (i,j,x) is present, then M[j] is a subset of x. Because M[j] is initialized to all 1's, then ANDed with x. So M[j] is the intersection of all x's in which j is involved. Therefore, for any constraint (i,j,x), M[j] is a subset of x. Because each x in a query for j is ANDed into M[j], so M[j] can't have any bits not present in all x's involving j. Wait, no. Suppose j is in two queries, x1 and x2. Then M[j] is x1 & x2. So any bit in M[j] must be present in both x1 and x2. So for any query involving j, the x in that query must have all the bits that are in M[j]. Because M[j] is the intersection of all x's in queries for j. So x >= M[j] for all x in j's queries. Because when you AND x1 and x2, the result is a subset of both x1 and x2.\n\nTherefore, for any query (i,j,x), x must be a superset of M[j]. Because M[j] is the intersection of all x's in j's queries. Therefore, x >= M[j].\n\nSo, x ^ M[j] is x & (~M[j]). Because M[j] is a subset of x. So, the bits that are in x but not in M[j] must be set in a_i or a_j. But since M[j] is the maximum allowed bits for a_j, a_j can't have those bits set. So a_i must set those bits.\n\nSo, for each constraint (i,j,x), the bits in x that are not in M[j] must be set in a_i. So, m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. Because x ^ M[j] is x - M[j].\n\nBut this is for all constraints involving i and j. So, regardless of whether j has been processed or not.\n\nWait, but M[j] is the maximum allowed bits for a_j. So even if j hasn't been processed yet, the bits in x not in M[j] must be set in a_i, because a_j can't set them.\n\nAh! This is a crucial insight. Because M[j] is the intersection of all x's in which j is involved, including the current x. So, M[j] is the maximum possible bits that a_j can have. Therefore, in any query (i,j,x), a_j can't have any bits outside of M[j]. So, if x has a bit that's not in M[j], then a_j can't set that bit. Therefore, a_i must set that bit. Because the OR of a_i and a_j must be x.\n\nSo, for every constraint (i,j,x), the code should set a_i to include the bits x ^ M[j], because those bits are not in M[j], and thus a_j can't have them. Therefore, a_i must have those bits.\n\nSo the condition in the code is not necessary. Because for all constraints (i,j,x), regardless of whether j has been processed or not, the code must set a_i's bits to include x ^ M[j].\n\nBut in the code, the condition is missing, and the code has an if-else. So perhaps the code is trying to handle the case where the constraint is between the same element (i and j are the same). For example, if a query is (i,i,x), then a_i | a_i =x, so a_i =x. So for such a query, x must be a subset of M[i], and a_i must be x. But the code's current structure would process this as two entries in L[i], (i, x) and (i, x), leading to multiple updates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition is checking whether i ==j, and in that case, set m[i] =x, else set m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. But that's not clear.\n\nBut in the sample input, let's see. The code's processing for i=0:\n\nFor each (j, x) in L[i] (which includes j=1, x=3). Since j=1 >=i=0 (assuming i starts at 0), the code's else clause is executed: m[i] =x=3. But sample output's first element is 2. So this is conflicting. \n\nBut in the sample input, the code's current logic would set m[0] to 3, but the correct output is 2. So this suggests that the code's current logic is incorrect, and the missing condition must be different.\n\nSo perhaps the code's missing condition is not checking whether j is less than i, but something else.\n\nAnother approach: the lex smallest array requires that each element is as small as possible. To achieve this, for each a_i, we can start by setting all possible bits to 0, then for each constraint (i,j,x), set the bits in a_i that are necessary. \n\nThe necessary bits for a_i are those bits in x that are not in M[j]. Because M[j] is the maximum allowed bits for a_j. So a_j can't have those bits, so a_i must set them. \n\nTherefore, for all constraints (i,j,x), regardless of j's index, a_i must set the bits x ^ M[j]. So the code's if condition is not needed; it should always do m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. \n\nBut the sample code has an else clause. So perhaps the code's condition is checking whether x ^ M[j] is non-zero. If it is, then OR, else do something else. But in the sample input, when processing i=0, j=1, x=3, and M[j] is 3 (since j=1's M is initialized to 3). So x ^ M[j] is 0. So m[i] |=0, so m[i] remains 0. Then, for other constraints involving i=0, but in the sample input, there's only one query involving i=0. So m[0] would be 0. But the sample output's first element is 2. So this is conflicting.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the code's approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's initial approach is to compute for each a_i the minimal possible value by considering all constraints (i,j,x) and ensuring that a_i has all bits in x that are not present in M[j]. Then, after processing all constraints for i, M[i] is set to m[i]. \n\nBut why would that be? Let's see:\n\nFor each i, after processing all constraints in L[i], M[i] is set to m[i]. So during the processing of i, all (j, x) in L[i] are processed. For each of them, m[i] is updated with the bits x ^ M[j]. \n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, when processing i=0:\n\nL[i] contains (1,3). So j=1, x=3.\n\nM[j] (M[1]) is 3. x ^ M[j] is 0. So m[i] remains 0. Then, M[0] is set to 0. \n\nBut the sample output's a_0 is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's current structure is incorrect, but the missing condition is part of the code. So perhaps the code is missing a condition that determines when to OR and when to set.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is whether a_i's current value is zero. Because initially, m[i] is 0. If after processing all constraints, the bits are added. \n\nBut in the sample, for i=0, j=1, x=3. Then, x ^ M[j] is 0. So m[0] remains 0, then M[0] is set to 0. \n\nBut sample output's a_0 is 2. So this approach isn't working. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is not correct. So perhaps the code's logic is flawed and needs to be re-examined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's missing condition is checking if the current m[i] is zero. For example, if m[i] is still zero, then the first constraint is to set it to x. Otherwise, OR with x ^ M[j]. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is missing a condition that checks if the OR of a_i and a_j (as per M[j]) is x. If not, then we need to set m[i] to x. But how would that be determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition is checking whether (m[i] | M[j]) >=x. But if not, then m[i] must be set to x. \n\nBut this is getting into complex territory. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to set m[i] to the OR of all x ^ M[j] for all j in L[i]. But the code uses an if-else structure, suggesting that in some cases, the code sets m[i] to x, which is larger than the OR approach. \n\nBut how does that fit into the lex smallest array.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition is checking whether the current m[i] is compatible with the existing constraints. If not, then set m[i] to x. \n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=4, q=3.\n\nQueries:\n\n1 2 3 (0-based 0,1,3)\n\n2 3 3 (1-based 2,3,3 \u2192 0-based 1,2,3)\n\n2 4 3 (1-based 2,4 \u2192 0-based 1,3,3)\n\nSample Output:\n\n2 1 2 2\n\nLet's see what the code does step by step.\n\nInitial M array: [0x3fffffff, 0x3fffffff, 0x3fffffff, 0x3fffffff]\n\nProcess each query:\n\nFor each query (i,j,x):\n\ni and j are decremented by 1.\n\nQuery 1: i=0, j=1, x=3 \u2192 M[0] &=3 \u2192 M[0] =3. M[1] &=3 \u2192 M[1] =3. Add (1,3) to L[0], and (0,3) to L[1}.\n\nQuery 2: i=1, j=2, x=3 \u2192 M[1] &=3 (still 3), M[2] &=3. Add (2,3) to L[1}, and (1,3) to L[2}.\n\nQuery3: i=1, j=3, x=3 \u2192 M[1] &=3 (3), M[3] &=3. Add (3,3) to L[1], and (1,3) to L[3}.\n\nAfter processing all queries, M array is [3,3,3,3].\n\nNow, processing each i from 0 to 3.\n\ni=0:\n\nL[0] has (1,3).\n\nFor each (j, x) in L[0]:\n\nj=1, x=3.\n\nCondition is missing. So if the condition is true, m[0] |= x ^ M[j]. Else, m[0] =x.\n\nInitially, m[0] is 0.\n\nIn this case, j=1, which is greater than i=0.\n\nIf the condition is j <i \u2192 false. So else clause is executed: m[0] =x=3.\n\nThen, after processing all (j,x), M[0] =3.\n\ni=1:\n\nL[1] has (0,3), (2,3), (3,3).\n\nFor each (j, x) in this list:\n\nFirst (0,3):\n\nj=0 <i=1. So if condition is true.\n\nx=3, M[j] =3 (since i=0 was processed and M[0] set to 3).\n\nx^M[j] =0. So m[1] |=0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nNext (2,3):\n\nj=2 >=i=1 \u2192 else clause. m[1] =3.\n\nNext (3,3):\n\nj=3 >=i=1 \u2192 else clause. m[1] =3.\n\nAfter processing, M[1] =3.\n\ni=2:\n\nL[2] has (1,3).\n\nProcessing j=1, x=3.\n\nj=1 <i=2. So if condition is true.\n\nM[j] is 3. x^3 is 0. m[2] |=0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nSo M[2] is set to 0.\n\ni=3:\n\nL[3] has (1,3).\n\nj=1 <3 \u2192 if condition is true.\n\nM[j] is 3. x^3 is0. m[3] |=0 \u2192 remains 0. M[3] =0.\n\nFinal m array is [3,3,0,0], which doesn't match the sample output.\n\nSo this suggests that the code's current approach is incorrect. Therefore, the missing condition must be something else.\n\nBut in the sample output, the correct array is [2,1,2,2]. So for i=0, the value is 2. How to achieve this.\n\nLet's see the constraints for i=0:\n\nOnly the first query (0,1,3). The OR must be 3. a_0 | a_1 =3. In the sample output, a_0=2 (binary 10), a_1=1 (binary 01). OR is 11 (3). So correct.\n\nBut according to the code's processing, a_0 is set to 3.\n\nSo why is the code's approach wrong? Because the code's initial setting of a_0 to 3 is incorrect. The correct a_0 is 2. So the code's approach must be missing some step.\n\nBut why is the code's processing of the first query for i=0 leading to a_0=3? Because the code's else clause sets m[i] =x=3. But the correct value is 2.\n\nSo the code's logic is flawed. Therefore, the missing condition must be different.\n\nAlternative approach: For each (i,j,x), the code should set a_i's bits to x ^ (M[j] & x), which is the bits in x that are not set in M[j]. But since M[j] is a subset of x, this is x ^ M[j].\n\nBut why in the sample, a_0 is 2 instead of 3. Because a_0's M[j] is 3 (for j=1), x is 3, so x ^ M[j] is 0. So m[0] is set to 0. But then why is the sample's a_0 2?\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect and that the missing condition is something else.\n\nAlternative idea: The code's missing condition is whether i == j. Because when i ==j, the constraint is a_i | a_i =x \u2192 a_i =x. So in that case, m[i] should be x. Otherwise, set m[i] |= x ^ M[j].\n\nSo the code's missing condition is (i ==j). If i ==j, then m[i] =x. Else, m[i] |= x ^ M[j].\n\nBut in the sample, there are no constraints where i ==j, so this condition wouldn't affect the sample. But the code's current processing for i=0 would still set m[0] to 3.\n\nHmm. This doesn't solve the problem.\n\nAnother approach: Perhaps the code should process the constraints in such a way that for each constraint (i,j,x), the bits that are in x but not in M[i] are set in a_j. But this would require processing the elements in reverse order.\n\nAlternatively, the code should process the elements in order, and for each i, set a_i to the minimal value possible, considering all constraints where j <i. For j >=i, the code assumes that a_j will be processed later and will take care of the constraints.\n\nBut how does this ensure that a_i | a_j =x for j >=i.\n\nThis seems to be the crux of the problem. For j >=i, when processing i, a_j hasn't been processed yet, so their M[j] is the maximum allowed. But the code wants to set a_i to the minimal possible, so it assumes that a_j will set the required bits. But how to ensure that.\n\nWait, in the sample, for the first query (i=0, j=1, x=3), a_0 and a_1's OR must be 3. The code's current approach sets a_0 to 3 (assuming j >=i), but this is incorrect. Because a_1 can be 0 (since M[1] is 3), but a_0 would have to be 3. But the sample's a_0 is 2 and a_1 is 1, which sum to 3. \n\nSo, why can't a_0 be 2 and a_1 be 1. Because during processing i=0, the code must ensure that for the query (0,1,3), a_0's OR with a_1's maximum allowed bits (3) is 3. But a_0 is 2, a_1's maximum is 3. So 2 |3= 3, which is correct. \n\nSo during processing i=0, the code can set a_0 to 2, because the maximum allowed for a_1 is 3, which would allow a_0's OR with a_1 to be 3. \n\nBut how does the code determine that a_0 can be 2?\n\nThe code's current logic for i=0's constraint (j=1, x=3) is to set a_0 to x=3 (if the else clause is executed), but this isn't necessary. Because a_1 can be 3, and a_0 can be 0, but that would violate the OR of 3. But if a_0 is 0, a_1 must be 3. But in the sample, a_1 is 1, which is allowed because a_0 is 2. \n\nSo the code's current approach is not correctly handling the cases where a_j can have a smaller value.\n\nThe key is that during processing i=0, the code must set a_0 to the minimal value such that for all constraints (i,j,x), a_i's bits include x's bits not present in the minimal possible a_j. \n\nBut how to compute the minimal possible a_j when j hasn't been processed yet.\n\nThis is tricky. The code's current approach for j >=i is to set a_i to x, which is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: The code should set a_i's bits to the AND of all (x ^ M[j]) for all constraints (i,j,x). This would ensure that a_i has all the required bits. \n\nBut in the sample, for i=0 and j=1, x=3. M[j] is 3. x ^ M[j] is 0. So a_i would have 0. But the sample's a_0 is 2. So this isn't correct.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the problem's note that the lex smallest array is desired. So, for each bit from high to low, and for each element from left to right, determine if the bit can be set to 0.\n\nThis is a standard approach for lex smallest problems. For each element, for each bit from highest to lowest, try to set it to 0 if possible.\n\nBut how to integrate this with the constraints.\n\nBut given the code structure, this approach is not directly applicable.\n\nAlternative idea: The code's missing condition is whether the current m[i] is still zero. If it's zero, then setting it to x. Otherwise, OR with x ^ M[j]. But in the sample, this would set m[0] to 3.\n\nBut this doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should compute the intersection of all x's for i's constraints, but that's already done in M[i].\n\nAlternatively, the code's missing condition is (i <j). If i <j, then the code sets m[i] |= x ^ M[j], assuming that j's value hasn't been processed yet. But this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints in the code's structure.\n\nThe code is using M[i] which is initialized as the AND of all x's in the queries involving i. Then, during the processing of each i, for each (j, x) in L[i], it checks a condition. If true, then m[i] |= x ^ M[j], else sets m[i] to x. Finally, M[i] is updated to m[i].\n\nThe sample code's initial processing sets M[i] to the intersection of all x's involving i. Then, during processing each i, for each (j, x), if the condition is met, m[i] is updated with x ^ M[j]. The final M[i] is m[i].\n\nSo, the key is that after processing i, M[i] is set to the current a_i's value. \n\nThe condition must involve whether j has been processed. Because for j <i, M[j] is the actual a_j's value. For j >=i, M[j] is still the initial maximum allowed bits.\n\nSo, during processing i, for each (j, x) in L[i], if j <i, then a_j's value is known (M[j] = m[j]). So the code must set a_i's bits to include x ^ M[j]. For j >=i, M[j] is the maximum allowed bits for a_j, but a_j can be set to a value that has those bits, allowing a_i to leave them unset. \n\nWait, no. Because M[j] is the maximum allowed bits for a_j. So any bit not in M[j] cannot be set in a_j. So x ^ M[j] is the bits in x that are not in M[j], which a_j cannot set. So a_i must set those bits.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether j has been processed or not, for each (i,j,x), a_i must set the bits in x ^ M[j], because a_j cannot set those bits (since M[j] is the maximum allowed for a_j, and x ^ M[j] is the bits that a_j cannot have).\n\nSo the code's missing condition is always true, and the else clause is redundant. But that's not the case in the code's structure. \n\nBut according to the code's sample input, when the code sets a_0 to 3, it's not correct. So perhaps the code's logic is wrong, and the missing condition is not required. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for (j, x) in L[i]:\n\n        if condition:\n\n            m[i] |= x ^ M[j]\n\n        else:\n\n            m[i] =x\n\n    M[i] =m[i]\n\nSo for each i, and for each constraint (j, x) involving i, the code is setting m[i] based on some condition. \n\nIf the condition is always true, then m[i] is ORed with x ^ M[j]. But for j >=i, M[j] is the initial maximum allowed bits, which is the AND of all x's involving j. \n\nIn the sample input, for i=0, j=1, x=3. M[j] is 3. x ^ M[j] is 0. So m[i] |=0, which leaves m[i] as 0. Then, after processing all (j, x) in L[i], M[i] is set to 0.\n\nBut the sample's a_0 is 2, which is not 0. So this approach is not correct.\n\nSo what's wrong here.\n\nAh! Perhaps the code's logic is to process each constraint (i,j,x) twice: once when processing i and once when processing j. \n\nBecause in the code, for each query (i,j,x), both i and j are added to each other's L lists. So each query is processed twice: once when processing i and once when processing j.\n\nFor example, the first query (0,1,3) is added to L[0] and L[1}. So when processing i=0, j=1 is considered. When processing i=1, j=0 is considered.\n\nSo, in the sample, when processing i=0, j=1, x=3. M[j] is 3 (the initial value). So x^M[j] is 0. So m[0] |=0 \u2192 remains 0.\n\nThen, when processing i=1, j=0 is processed. At that time, j=0 <i=1. M[j] is 0 (since i=0's processing set M[0] to 0). x=3. x^M[j] is 3 ^0 =3. So m[1] |=3 \u2192 m[1] becomes 3.\n\nSo after processing i=1, m[1] is 3. Then, when processing i=2, j=1 (x=3), which is processed. M[j] is 3. x^3 is 0 \u2192 m[2] remains 0. \n\nThen, when processing i=3, j=1, x=3. M[j] is3. x^3 is 0 \u2192 m[3] remains 0.\n\nThe final m array would be [0,3,0,0], which is not the sample output.\n\nBut the sample requires a_0 to be 2. So this approach is not working.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternative idea: The code should initialize m[i] to M[i], not to 0. Because M[i] is the intersection of all x's involving i, so it's the maximal allowed bits. Then, during processing, m[i] is minimized by turning off bits where possible.\n\nBut the code initializes m[i] to 0 and builds it up by ORing required bits.\n\nBut how to reconcile this.\n\nAnother approach: The lex smallest array must have each a_i as small as possible. For each a_i, starting from the first element, we want to set as many bits to 0 as possible. \n\nTo do this, for each bit from highest to lowest, decide if it can be set to 0 in a_i, considering all constraints.\n\nBut implementing this approach would require per-bit processing for each element, which can be efficient enough given the constraints.\n\nBut how to model this with the given code structure.\n\nAlternatively, the code's missing condition is whether (i ==j), and for those cases, set m[i] to x. But again, this doesn't fit the sample.\n\nAlternatively, the code's missing condition is (x & (x ^ M[j])) !=0. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code's missing condition is (x & ~M[j]) !=0. Which would be true if x has bits not in M[j], which requires a_i to set those bits. But in the sample's case, x=3, M[j]=3. So x & ~M[j] is 0. So the condition is false, so else clause is executed: m[i] =x. But this would set a_0 to 3, which is incorrect.\n\nBut sample's a_0 is 2. So this suggests that the code's approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a different approach to solve the problem and see how it aligns with the code structure.\n\nThe correct approach to solve the problem is to:\n\n1. For each element, determine the bits that must be set. These are the bits that are required by any constraint where the other element cannot set them.\n\nFor example, in a constraint (i,j,x), if the bit k is set in x but not in M[j], then a_i must set bit k.\n\nSo, for each bit k in x, if M[j] has bit k unset, then a_i must set bit k.\n\nBut M[j] is the intersection of all x's that j is involved in. So if M[j] has bit k unset, then all x's involving j have bit k unset. So a_j cannot set bit k. Therefore, a_i must set it.\n\nSo, for each constraint (i,j,x), the bits that a_i must set are x & ~M[j].\n\nSo, for all constraints (i,j,x), the a_i must include the bits x & ~M[j].\n\nThis must be done for all constraints involving i.\n\nSo, the a_i is the OR of all x & ~M[j] for all j in L[i].\n\nThis can be computed by initializing a_i to 0, then OR'ing all x & ~M[j] for each constraint.\n\nSo, in code, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nfor (j, x) in L[i]:\n\n    m[i] |= (x & ~M[j])\n\nThen, set M[i] = m[i]\n\nBut this approach would compute the minimal possible a_i.\n\nBut in the sample:\n\nFor i=0, j=1, x=3.\n\nM[j] is 3. ~M[j] is 0x3fffff00... (assuming 32 bits). So x & ~M[j] is 3 & ~3 =0. So m[i] remains 0.\n\nThen, M[0] =0.\n\nFor i=1, j=0, x=3. M[j] is 0. ~M[j] is all ones. x & ~M[j] is 3 & all ones =3. So m[1] |=3 \u21923. j=2, x=3. M[j] is3. x&~3 =0. j=3, x=3. M[j] is3. x&~3=0. So m[1] remains 3. M[1] is3.\n\nFor i=2, j=1, x=3. M[j] is3. x&~3=0. So m[2] remains 0. M[2] is0.\n\nFor i=3, j=1, x=3. M[j] is3. x&~3=0. So m[3] remains 0. M[3] is0.\n\nResulting array [0,3,0,0]. Not correct.\n\nBut sample output is [2,1,2,2]. So this approach is not working.\n\nSo where is the mistake? Because according to the constraints, a_0 | a_1 must be 3. But in the computed array, a_0 is 0 and a_1 is3. 0|3=3, which is correct. But sample output's a_0 is 2. So why is this allowed?\n\nBecause the code's approach computes a valid array, but not the lex smallest one. The lex smallest array is the earliest possible element to be as small as possible. In the computed array, a_0 is 0, which is smaller than the sample's a_0=2, but why isn't that array considered valid?\n\nBecause the sample's array must also satisfy the other constraints.\n\nWait, the sample has three constraints:\n\n1. a_0 | a_1 =3\n\n2. a_1 | a_2 =3\n\n3. a_1 | a_3 =3.\n\nThe code's computed array [0,3,0,0] satisfies:\n\n0 |3 =3.\n\n3 |0 =3.\n\n3 |0 =3.\n\nSo it satisfies all constraints. But the sample's output is [2,1,2,2], which is lex larger than [0,3,0,0]. But according to the problem statement, the sample output is one of the possible valid arrays. So why is the code's approach not producing the lex smallest array.\n\nAh! Because there's another constraint that I'm missing. The sample's output is one of the valid arrays, but the code's approach produces a lex smaller array. But according to the problem statement, the sample output is the lex smallest possible. This suggests that my understanding is incorrect, or that there's another constraint in the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input has three constraints:\n\n1. 1 2 3 \u2192 a_0 |a_1=3.\n\n2. 2 3 3 \u2192 a_1 |a_2=3.\n\n3. 2 4 3 \u2192 a_1 |a_3=3.\n\nThe code's computed array [0,3,0,0] satisfies all constraints, but why isn't this the correct answer?\n\nBecause the problem statement's sample output is different. This implies that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample output is the lex smallest array. So the array [0,3,0,0] must not be valid. But according to the constraints, it is valid. So why is it not the correct answer?\n\nThis suggests that there's an error in my analysis. Perhaps there's a fourth constraint in the sample input.\n\nBut according to the sample input description, there are three queries. So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the sample output is not the lex smallest array. But that's impossible.\n\nWait, the sample input's output is [2,1,2,2]. Let's check if this array satisfies all constraints:\n\na_0 | a_1 = 2 |1 =3 \u2192 correct.\n\na_1 |a_2 =1 |2 =3 \u2192 correct.\n\na_1 |a_3 =1 |2 =3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo it's valid. But the array [0,3,0,0] is also valid and lex smaller. So why isn't it the correct answer.\n\nThis implies that the problem statement's sample output is incorrect, which is impossible. Therefore, my analysis must be wrong.\n\nAh! Wait, the problem's note says that the first sample's arrays include [0,3,2,2], which is a valid array, but the sample output is [2,1,2,2], which is lex smaller than [0,3,2,2]. Wait no, 0 is less than 2, so [0,3,...] is lex smaller than [2,1,...]. So why is the sample output [2,1,2,2], and not [0,3,0,0], which is even smaller?\n\nThis suggests that the problem's note is not the same as the sample input, or that there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach is not correct and the sample input's output is not the lex smallest.\n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample output is correct. So perhaps the array [0,3,0,0] is not valid. But why?\n\nBecause of other constraints. For example, after processing the queries, M[i] is the AND of all x's involving i.\n\nFor the sample input:\n\ni=0's constraints: only query 1 (x=3). So M[0] is 3.\n\ni=1's constraints: queries 1, 2, 3 (x=3 each). So M[1] is 3.\n\ni=2's constraints: query 2 (x=3). So M[2] is3.\n\ni=3's constraints: query 3 (x=3). So M[3] is3.\n\nSo for a_i to be valid, it must be a subset of M[i].\n\nSo a_0 is 0, which is a subset of M[0]=3. a_1=3 is subset of 3. a_2=0 is subset of 3. a_3=0 is subset of3. So all are valid.\n\nSo why isn't this the correct answer?\n\nAh! Because the problem requires that all constraints are satisfied, but also that the array is the lex smallest possible. The array [0,3,0,0] is lex smaller than the sample output, but it's not part of the possible arrays listed in the note.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first sample's arrays include [0,3,2,2], but not [0,3,0,0]. So why is that?\n\nBecause there must be another constraint that prevents this. But according to the sample input provided, there are only three queries. \n\nThis suggests that there is a mistake in the problem statement, or in my understanding of it.\n\nBut the problem states that the sample input's output is [2,1,2,2]. This indicates that my approach is incorrect, and the code's approach must be correct. So the code's missing condition must be something that allows the code to generate the correct array.\n\nBut what is the missing condition?\n\nAfter a long time of analysis, I think the correct condition is (i != j). Because when i ==j, the code should set m[i] to x. Otherwise, m[i] |= x ^ M[j]. \n\nBut in the sample input, there are no queries where i ==j. So this condition wouldn't affect the sample.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's missing condition is (i <j). Because during processing i, if j is greater than i, then the code sets m[i] to x. \n\nBut in the sample, for i=0 and j=1 (i <j), the else clause would set m[0] to x=3. But this would result in a_0=3, which doesn't align with the sample output. \n\nThis is a dead end.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make an educated guess based on the code's structure and the problem's requirements. The code's missing condition is (j <i), which allows processing j's that have already been processed. For j >=i, the code sets m[i] to x. \n\nBut in the sample, this leads to a_0=3. Which is not correct. But the sample's a_0=2.\n\nTherefore, the code's approach must be incorrect. But given the code provided, the missing condition must be (i <j), but this doesn't fit the sample.\n\nAlternatively, the code's missing condition is (i <j), and the code should set m[i] |=x ^ M[j] for j <i, and for j >=i, do something else. But this is not working.\n\nAfter much struggle, I think the correct condition is (j <i). So the code's missing line is \"j <i\".\n\nSo the code checks if j is less than i. If yes, then m[i] |=x ^ M[j]. Else, do nothing.\n\nBut in the sample input, for i=0, j=1 is not less than i, so the else clause is executed, setting m[0] to x=3. Which is not correct.\n\nBut according to the sample's output, a_0 is 2, which is 3 ^1. So this suggests that the code's approach is missing some step.\n\nFinally, after considering all possibilities and time constraints, I think the missing condition is \"j <i\", which allows the code to handle j's that have already been processed. For j <i, M[j] is the actual a_j's value, so the code must set a_i's bits to x ^ M[j]. For j >=i, the code doesn't do anything, but when j is processed later, it will handle the constraint.\n\nBut in the sample, this approach would set a_0 to 3, which is incorrect. \n\nBut given that the code must be filled in, and the missing condition is the only line, I think the intended condition is \"j <i\". So the code is:\n\nif j <i:\n    m[i] |= x ^ M[j]\nelse:\n    m[i] =x\n\nBut this doesn't fit the sample. But given that the code's current structure has this logic, and the problem requires the code to be filled in, I'll proceed with the condition j <i."
