    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if a given string can be formed using the stamp operations described. The stamp changes two adjacent cells, either to BR or RB. And each use of the stamp can affect those two cells again. So the main thing is figuring out the conditions that the target string must satisfy for it to be possible.\n\nThe code given splits the input string into segments separated by W. Each of these segments (non-white parts) needs to be checked for validity. Because any W in the middle breaks the sequence, since you can't stamp across a W. So each non-white segment must independently satisfy some conditions.\n\nSo the missing code is the condition to check each segment 'a' in the jiexi array. The idea is that each such segment must meet two criteria:\n\n1. The length of the segment must be at least 2. Because you can't have a single non-W cell, since each stamp affects two cells. Wait, but wait. The sample input includes cases where a single non-W cell is impossible. For example, the second test case in the notes. Because you can't stamp a single cell. So any segment of length 1 is automatically invalid. So if a is empty (like when split by W?), but wait, the split would have removed Ws, but if the input is all Ws, then jiexi would be empty? Wait, no. The code replaces W+ with spaces and splits on whitespace, so consecutive Ws become a single space and then split into empty strings. Wait, for example, if the original string is \"WWBWRRW\", replacing W+ with \" \" gives \" B RR \", splitting on whitespace (using split(\"\\\\s+\") which trims and splits multiple spaces) would give [\"\", \"B\", \"RR\", \"\"]. But in the loop, those empty strings are skipped. Or maybe not? Hmm. So the code's logic is to split the original string into parts that are separated by Ws. So each part is a group of consecutive non-W characters. But if the original string starts with W, then jiexi[0] is an empty string. Similarly if ends with W. So in the loop, we process each a in jiexi. But for a to be a valid part, it must have at least two characters. Because each stamp affects two cells. But how do you get a single non-W cell? You can't. So any segment with length 1 is invalid, leading to S being set to false.\n\nBut there's more. Even if the segment length is >=2, the colors must alternate in a way that allows for parity. For example, a segment like \"RBRB\" is possible, but \"RR\" is possible? Let's think. Let's take \"RR\". How can we get that? Let's see. Let's see the possible operations. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells. For example, applying the stamp as BR. So the first application could be positions 1-2: R and B. Then applying again in positions 1-2 as BR would turn them back to W? Wait, no. Because each stamp application toggles the colors. Wait, the problem statement says that each application of the stamp recolors both cells. So the initial cells are white. When you apply the stamp, you set them to BR or RB. Then applying the same stamp again would toggle them again. Wait, no. Wait, when you apply the stamp, it's not additive. Each stamp operation sets the two cells to either BR or RB. So each time you apply a stamp, you overwrite those two cells. So it's possible to apply the stamp multiple times on the same pair. For example, first apply BR on positions 1-2. Then apply RB on the same positions. The result would be RB. Then apply BR again, and so on. So the order of stamping matters.\n\nBut the problem is that each stamp operation can be applied in any way, any number of times. So how do the colors end up? The key is to model the possible colors for each cell based on the number of stamps that affect it.\n\nWait, each time a stamp is applied to positions i and i+1, it sets those two cells to either BR or RB. But how does that affect their colors? Let's think of each cell's color as being determined by the parity of the number of times it's been part of a stamp. For example, let's imagine that each stamp application on a pair of cells toggles their colors in a certain way. Wait, maybe not. Because each stamp operation sets them to either BR or RB. So it's not a matter of toggling, but of choosing which way to stamp them. Hmm. This makes it more complex.\n\nAlternatively, think of each stamp as adding a certain pattern. The initial state is all white. Each stamp is applied in such a way that it affects two adjacent cells. Each application of the stamp can be either BR or RB. So each application to a pair (i, i+1) can flip their colors in some way. For example, if the cells were white, applying BR would make them BR. Applying again as BR would have no effect? Or does it overwrite again? No, because each stamp operation completely changes the two cells. So for example, after applying BR once on positions 1-2, they become BR. Applying BR again would set them to BR again, so no change. Applying RB would set them to RB.\n\nBut this suggests that the order of operations matters. So how can we model the possible colors? This seems tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: for the target string, each contiguous non-W segment must satisfy certain parity conditions. Let's think of each such segment. For example, a segment of length 2 must be either BR or RB. Otherwise, it's impossible. Because the only way to create a two-cell segment is by stamping exactly once. So for example, if the target is BB, then it's impossible. Because each stamp would set the two cells to either BR or RB, and you can't have BB.\n\nBut wait, maybe not. Suppose you stamp on adjacent pairs. For example, consider a segment of length 3. Suppose the target is BBB. How can that be achieved? Let's see:\n\nStamps can be applied on 1-2, 2-3. Let's see:\n\nInitial: WWW.\n\nFirst, apply stamp on 1-2 as BB? Wait no, the stamp can only set them to BR or RB. So initial is WW. Apply stamp as BR \u2192 BR. Then stamp on 2-3 as BR \u2192 BR. Now the string is BBR. Then, perhaps stamp on 1-2 again as RB \u2192 RB. Then 1-2 is RB, 2-3 is BR. So the string is R B R. Hmm, but how to get BBB? That seems impossible. So any segment with all B's is impossible.\n\nBut maybe there's a different approach. Let's think of each cell's color as being determined by the number of times it was the first or second in a stamp application. For example, each time a cell i is part of a stamp as the first in a BR pair, it's set to B. As the first in a RB pair, R. Wait, no. The stamp can be applied in either orientation. Each stamp application to a pair (i, i+1) can be either BR or RB. So each application contributes to the color of those two cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each stamp as an operation that sets the two cells to a certain color pair. So each stamp application is equivalent to choosing a pair of adjacent cells and setting them to either BR or RB. However, multiple stamps can be applied to the same pair, which would overwrite their colors each time. Also, stamps can be applied to overlapping regions. So the problem is to model whether the target can be achieved by a sequence of such operations.\n\nThis seems challenging. But perhaps there's a pattern or invariant that must hold for the target string. Let's think of the parity of the number of stamps applied to each cell. Wait, maybe not. Because each stamp affects two cells, but the order of application can vary.\n\nAlternatively, for a segment of non-W cells, let's consider the following:\n\nEach stamp application to a pair of cells (i, i+1) affects the colors of i and i+1. So to reach the target colors, perhaps the sum (parity) of certain operations must hold.\n\nWait, here's an important observation: For any two consecutive cells in the target, their colors must be different. Because each stamp application can only set them to BR or RB, which are different. But wait, that's not correct. Because you can apply multiple stamps. For example:\n\nApply stamp to (1,2) as BR \u2192 BR.\n\nThen apply stamp to (2,3) as RB \u2192 RB.\n\nThen apply stamp to (1,2) as RB \u2192 RB.\n\nThen the colors are R, B, B.\n\nSo in this case, the first two cells are RB, the next pair is BB. Wait, no. Let's track each step:\n\nInitial: WWW.\n\nStep 1: Apply BR to (1,2) \u2192 B R W.\n\nStep 2: Apply RB to (2,3) \u2192 B R R B? Wait, no. Applying RB to (2,3) would set cells 2 and 3 to RB. So after step 2, the string is B R B.\n\nStep 3: Apply RB to (1,2): set cells 1 and 2 to RB. So the string becomes R B B.\n\nSo now, cells 2 and 3 are B and B. So consecutive cells can have the same color. Therefore, the initial thought that consecutive cells must be different is wrong. So that's not a valid condition.\n\nSo the problem is more complex. Therefore, the earlier approach of splitting the string into non-W segments and checking each for validity is correct, but the conditions are more nuanced.\n\nSo, for each non-W segment, what must be true?\n\nFirst, the segment's length must be at least 2. Because you can't have a single non-W cell. So any segment of length 1 is invalid. So in the code, if a has length 1, then S is set to false.\n\nSecond, within the segment, the colors must not be all R or all B. Wait, no. Let's see. For example, can we have a segment of three R's? Let's see:\n\nSuppose the target is RRR. How can that be achieved? Let's try:\n\nStart with WWW.\n\nApply stamp to (1,2) as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nThen apply stamp to (2,3) as RB \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B. So after second stamp: R R B.\n\nThen apply stamp to (1,2) as RB \u2192 R and R become R and B again? Wait, no. Wait, applying the stamp to (1,2) as RB would set them to R and B. So after step 3: R B B.\n\nHmm, that's not getting us to RRR. Alternatively:\n\nAnother approach. Apply stamp to (1,2) as RB: R B W.\n\nApply stamp to (1,2) as BR: B R W.\n\nApply stamp to (2,3) as RB: R becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 B R B.\n\nNot helpful. Hmm. So maybe it's impossible to have three R's in a row. So perhaps each segment must have at least one B and R. But that's not the case. For example, in the fifth test case of the notes: the target is BRB. Let me see. The sample input 5's explanation says it's possible. So the target is BRB, which has R in the middle and B on the ends. So it's possible. So the presence of both R and B is not required. Wait, in that case, the segment is BRB, which has both R and B. But what about a segment like BRRBR. That has R and B. So how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that each segment must have at least one R and one B. Because each stamp introduces both R and B. But when overlapping stamps are applied, maybe it's possible to have some R's and B's in the segment. Wait, but if all the stamps applied to a segment are in such a way that they overwrite previous colors, perhaps it's possible to have a segment with only R's. Or maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think. Each time a pair is stamped, it's set to either BR or RB. So each stamp application adds exactly one R and one B to the pair. But if you apply stamps in such a way that overlapping pairs overwrite previous cells, perhaps you can end up with all R's. Let's try:\n\nExample: Target is RR. Let's see if possible.\n\nOriginal is WW.\n\nApply stamp as RB \u2192 R B. Now, apply another stamp to the same pair as RB again. That would set them to R B again. No change. Apply as BR \u2192 B R. So after that, the pair is B R. Then apply stamp again as BR \u2192 B R again. Not helpful. So it's impossible to get RR. So for a segment of two, the only possible targets are BR or RB. So if the segment is RR, then it's invalid.\n\nSo for a segment of length 2, it's only valid if the two characters are different.\n\nFor segments longer than 2, what's the condition?\n\nLet's take a segment of length 3: \"BRB\".\n\nHow was this achieved in the fifth test case? The steps were:\n\nWWW \u2192 W RB \u2192 WB RB \u2192 BR B. Wait, according to the example:\n\nThe steps were:\n\nOriginal WWW.\n\nApply stamp to positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 W RB. Then apply stamp to positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 BR RB. Result is BRB. So that's allowed.\n\nSo the segment is BRB, which has B, R, B. So the first and third are B. So the colors can be same in non-consecutive positions.\n\nAnother example: a segment of length 3, \"RBR\". Is that possible? Let's see.\n\nApply stamps to 1-2 as RB (R B), then to 2-3 as BR (B R). So the result is R B R. So yes. So a segment like RBR is possible.\n\nBut how about a segment of length 3, \"RRR\"? Let's see:\n\nIs there a way to get R R R?\n\nStarting with WWW.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nThen apply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R B.\n\nThen apply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R R becomes R B? No, applying RB would set 1-2 to R B. So after that, R B B.\n\nNo. Then apply another stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 B becomes R, B becomes B \u2192 R R R. Wait, no. Because stamping 2-3 as RB would set 2 and 3 to R and B. Wait, initial after step 2 is R R B. Then stamp 2-3 as RB: cells 2 and 3 are set to R and B. So the string becomes R R B \u2192 R R B \u2192 applying to 2-3 as RB would make 2 R, 3 B. So that's R R B again. No change. So it's impossible.\n\nThus, \"RRR\" is invalid.\n\nSo the key seems to be that in a segment, the first and last characters can't be the same. Or perhaps not. Wait, the fifth test case's segment is BRB, where first and last are B. So that's allowed. So that's not the condition.\n\nHmm. Another approach: For a segment to be possible, there must be at least one occurrence of R and B. Because each stamp adds both. So if a segment has only R's, it's impossible. For example, a segment of RR is impossible, as each stamp would require BR or RB. But how about a segment of length 3 with all R's? Then, impossible. So the condition is that each segment must have at least one R and one B.\n\nYes! Because each stamp operation introduces both colors. So for any segment, there must be at least one R and one B. Otherwise, if the entire segment is all R's or all B's, it's impossible.\n\nSo combining the two conditions: each non-W segment must have length >=2, and must contain both R and B.\n\nWait, but in the fifth test case example, the segment is BRB. So it has B and R. So that's valid.\n\nIn the sixth test case example, the target is RBB. So the segment is RBB. So R and B are present. So that's valid.\n\nBut what about a segment of length 3: BBRB. That has B and R. So it's valid.\n\nSo the conditions for a segment are:\n\n1. The length is at least 2.\n\n2. The segment contains at least one R and at least one B.\n\nIf both conditions are met, then the segment is possible; otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nBut wait, there might be more conditions. For example, a segment like BRR. Let's see if it's possible.\n\nBRR has B and R. So according to the conditions, it's valid. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: WWW.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R. So after that: B B R.\n\nSo the string is BBR. Then, apply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B B becomes BR again. No. Hmm. Wait, not sure. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nApply to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nApply to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 B R B.\n\nThen, apply to 2-3 again as BR \u2192 B R. So now the string is B B R.\n\nSo the target is BRR (assuming that's the case). So how?\n\nWait, the example is BRR. Let's see:\n\nOriginal is WWW.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R (since stamp sets them to RB? Wait, when you apply stamp to 2-3 as RB, then cell 2 becomes R and cell 3 becomes B. So after that, the string is B R B.\n\nThen, apply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, B becomes R. So cells 2 and 3 are B R. So the string becomes B B R.\n\nSo the segment is BBR, which is allowed. But the target BRR would require cells 2 and 3 to be R and R. But according to the steps, that's not possible. So perhaps there are more conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parity of the number of R's and B's in the segment must be considered. For example, in a segment, the counts of R and B must satisfy certain parity conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first and last characters must be the same. Wait, in the fifth test case, the segment is BRB: first and last are B. The sixth test case's segment is RBB: first is R, last B. So that's allowed.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the parity isn't the issue, but the presence of R and B is.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that each stamp operation introduces exactly one R and one B. But multiple stamps can overwrite these, but the overall sum may have certain parity. For example, each stamp on a pair (i, i+1) adds one R and one B. But when you apply a stamp again, it might overwrite previous colors, but the total number of R and B can change.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire segment. For it to be possible, the sum of R and B in the segment must be even? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order of operations doesn't matter, and the colors are determined by the parity of how many times each cell is stamped as part of a pair. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's think of the code again. The code splits the input into non-W segments. For each segment, it must check if it's possible. The code sets S to false if any of the segments is invalid.\n\nThe missing condition is in the if statement. So the code currently loops through each a in jiexi (the non-W segments) and checks if some condition is true. If any of them is true, then S is set to false.\n\nSo the condition inside the if is the one that determines if the segment is invalid.\n\nSo what conditions make a segment invalid?\n\n1. The length of the segment is less than 2 \u2192 invalid.\n\nOR\n\n2. The segment contains only R's or only B's \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the code should check if a.length() < 2 OR (all R or all B).\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif (a.length() < 2 || (!a.contains(\"R\") || !a.contains(\"B\")) )\n\nWait, but in Java, to check if the string a has both R and B, we need to see if it contains at least one R and at least one B. So if a has only R's, then a.contains(\"R\") is true, but a.contains(\"B\") is false. So the condition would be:\n\nIf a has length <2, or (a does not contain R OR a does not contain B).\n\nWait, no. Because if the segment is all R's, then it doesn't contain B. So the condition would be: a.length() <2 || (a has no R or a has no B). Wait, no. Wait, the condition for the segment to be invalid is if it is all R or all B. So the segment is invalid if (a has no R) OR (a has no B). But in that case, (a.indexOf('R') == -1) || (a.indexOf('B') == -1). So the code would be:\n\nif (a.length() < 2 || (a.indexOf('R') == -1 || a.indexOf('B') == -1)) {\n\nThen S is set to false.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, a segment of \"RRB\" has R and B. So it's valid. So in that case, a.indexOf('R') != -1 and a.indexOf('B') != -1. So the condition is not met. So the code would not enter the if block. Thus, S remains true, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: segment is \"BB\". Then, a.indexOf('R') == -1. So the condition is true. So the code sets S to false.\n\nAnother example: segment is \"RRR\" \u2192 indexOf B is -1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAnother example: segment is \"BR\" \u2192 has both R and B. Length is 2. Valid.\n\nSo the condition for the if statement is: if the segment's length is less than 2, OR the segment doesn't contain R OR doesn't contain B. So in code: (a.length() < 2) || (a does not have R) || (a does not have B).\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nIn Java, to check if a string contains 'R', we can use a.indexOf('R') == -1. Similarly for 'B'. So the condition would be:\n\na.length() < 2 || (a.indexOf('R') == -1 || a.indexOf('B') == -1)\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nif (a.length() < 2 || (a.indexOf('R') == -1 || a.indexOf('B') == -1)) {\n\nThen, if this is true, the segment is invalid, so S is set to false.\n\nSo that's the missing condition.\n\nTesting this with the examples:\n\nFirst test case: \"BRBBW\" \u2192 split into [\"BRBB\"] (since the W is at the end). The length is 4, which is >=2. And contains B and R. So valid.\n\nSecond test case: \"RR\" \u2192 split into [\"RR\"], which has length 2. But no B. So invalid \u2192 code returns false.\n\nThird test case: \"B\" \u2192 split into [\"B\"], length 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nFourth test case: \"WW\" \u2192 jiexi is empty (after split), so loop skips \u2192 S remains true. So output YES. Wait, but the original input is \"WW\". The code replaces W+ with space and splits, so jiexi is [\"\", \"\"] \u2192 but split with \\\\s+ would remove leading and trailing, so maybe split into an array with empty strings? For example, the input is \"WW\", which after replace becomes \" \" \u2192 split into [\"\"], which when split using \\\\s+ becomes an empty array. Wait, Java's split with \\\\s+ splits on one or more whitespace, so the empty string is split into zero elements. Let me check:\n\nThe code has:\n\nString zhaopian = input.next().replaceAll(\"W+\", \" \");\nString[] jiexi = zhaopian.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n\nSo for example, if the original string is \"WWW\", replaceAll(\"W+\", \" \") \u2192 \" \".\n\nThen split on \\\\s+ \u2192 split into parts split by one or more whitespace. The split method will split the string \" \" into an array of zero elements (since the split removes leading and trailing whitespace). So for example, \"   \".split(\"\\\\s+\") gives an empty array.\n\nSo in the case where the entire string is Ws, zhaopian is a single space (if n >=1), then jiexi is an empty array. So the loop for (String a : jiexi) doesn't run. So S remains true, which would output YES, which is correct (since the desired picture is all Ws, which is possible by not using any stamps).\n\nBut in the fourth test case of the notes, which says the answer is NO. Wait, the note says:\n\n\"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is 'NO'.\"\n\nWait, the fourth test case is probably \"W\", which after processing becomes \"\" in jiexi, so the loop doesn't run. But the original n is 1. So the input is \"W\" \u2192 which is allowed. So the code would output YES. Wait, but the note says the fourth test case is impossible. So perhaps the fourth test case's input is something else. Wait, the note says that for test case 4, it's impossible. Let's check the note again:\n\nNotes:\n\n\"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\nAh, the fourth test case's input is a single cell. For example, n=1 and s=\"R\". Then the code would split into [\"R\"], which is processed. The loop runs, a is \"R\", which has length 1. So the condition is true, S is set to false. So output is NO. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code correctly handles the case where the segment is of length 1.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif (a.length() < 2 || (a.indexOf('R') == -1 || a.indexOf('B') == -1)) {\n\nSo putting that into the code:\n\nThe code's TODO is in the line:\n\nif (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\nSo replacing the comment with the condition.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\na.length() < 2 || a.indexOf('R') == -1 || a.indexOf('B') == -1\n\nSo the complete if condition is:\n\nif (a.length() < 2 || a.indexOf('R') == -1 || a.indexOf('B') == -1) {"
