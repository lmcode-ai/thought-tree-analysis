Wait, the current code structure is in descending order. The first condition is 1900 or higher. If that's not met, check if 1600 or higher. Then the next condition should be for 1400 or higher. Because after checking 1600, the remaining n is less than 1600. So for Division 3, the condition should be n >= 1400. Because if n is between 1400 and 1599, then it's Division 3. Otherwise, it's Division 4. So the missing condition is else if (1400 <= n). Because once we reach that else if, n is already less than 1600. So checking if it's >=1400 would cover 1400 to 1599. Then else would handle anything below 1400, which is Division 4. So the missing code should be 1400 <= n. Because that's the correct range for Division 3.",
