Suppose x1's distance is 0. Then, the initial in[i] for i is 3. So the code would set dis[i] to 0+3=3. Then in[i] becomes 2. Then, when x2 is processed (with distance 1), the code checks the edge from i to x2. At this point, in[i] is 2. So dis[i] would be 1 + 2=3. But since dis[i] was already set to 3, it doesn't change. Then in[i] becomes 1. Then, when x3 is processed (distance 2), in[i] is 1. So dis[i] would be 2+1=3. Again, same as before. So the minimal distance for i is 3. But what if x3's distance is lower? For example, if x3's distance is 0. Suppose the edges are processed in the order x3, x2, x1. Then, when x3 is processed first (distance 0), in[i] is 3. So dis[i] becomes 0+3=3, in[i] becomes 2. Then x2 (distance 1) comes, in[i] is 2, so 1+2=3. Then x1 (distance 2) comes, in[i] is 1, 2+1=3. So again, same result. So in this approach, regardless of the order in which the edges are processed, the minimal distance is the sum of the minimal x's distance plus the current in[i] (which depends on the number of edges processed before).

But the code uses a priority queue sorted by the current distance of the node (x), so the nodes with the smallest distance are processed first. In the example above, if x1 has a distance of 1 and x2 has a distance of 2, then x1 is processed before x2. So when x1's edge is processed, in[i] is 2, leading to dis[i] = 3. Then when x2's edge is processed, in[i] is 1, leading to 2+1=3, but the distance is already 3. But if x2 has a smaller distance than x1, then x2 is processed first. Then in[i] is 2, dis[i] =2 (distance of x2) +2 =4. Then in[i] becomes 1. Then x1's edge is processed, leading to 1 +1=2, which is better. So in this case, the order of processing nodes x1 and x2 affects the result. But in the code, the priority queue ensures that nodes with the smallest distance are processed first.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to understand the problem here. So, we need to find the minimum number of days d such that AmShZ can ensure Keshi reaches city n in at most d days. The way the days work is that each day, AmShZ can either block a road or tell Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he picks a random available road, but AmShZ wants to make sure that regardless of his choices, he ends up at city n within d days.\n\nHmm, the code provided uses Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a clue. The nodes are cities, and the priority queue is ordered by some distance. The initial setup starts from city n (since dis[n] is 0), which suggests that we're calculating the shortest path in reverse. \n\nThe variables involved are in[x], which is the in-degree of the node x. Wait, but in the code, when reading roads, they are stored in v[y].push_back(x), which seems like for each road from v_i to u_i, we're adding x (which is v_i) to the adjacency list of u_i. So the adjacency list v is for reversed roads. Because originally the roads are from v_i to u_i, but in the code, for each such road, we add to v[y] (y is u_i) the node x (v_i). So the adjacency list is built in reverse. So when we process node x, we're looking at all nodes i (original v_i) that have a road leading to x (original u_i). So this is building a reverse graph.\n\nThe key part is the condition in the if statement. Let's see. The code is doing something like, for each node i connected to x in the reversed graph, check if some condition is met, then update dis[i]. The in[i] is the in-degree of the original node. Wait, in the code, in[x] is incremented for each road. Because for each road from v_i to u_i, the code adds to v[y] (y is u_i) the x (v_i), and increments in[x]++. So in[x] here is the number of outgoing roads from x in the original graph. Because each road from x to any other node contributes to in[x]. Wait, no. Let me think again. The original road is from v_i to u_i. So in the code, for each such road, we add to u_i's adjacency list the v_i (since v[y] where y is u_i, and x is v_i). So the reversed graph's edges are from u_i to v_i. And in[x] is the number of original outgoing roads from x, i.e., the out-degree of x in the original graph. Because for each road leaving x, in the original graph, in the code, in[x] is incremented once. So in[x] is the out-degree of x in the original graph.\n\nNow, when processing node x (which in the reversed graph represents the original node x), the distance for node i (original v_i) is considered. The distance is being calculated as dis[x] + in[i], but only if some condition is met. Then, in[i] is decremented.\n\nWait, the problem requires finding the minimal d such that Keshi can reach n in at most d days. So the approach here seems to model this as a shortest path problem, where each node's distance is determined by the maximum possible time needed to reach n from there, considering the optimal blocking strategy by AmShZ.\n\nSince AmShZ can block roads each day, except when he tells Keshi to move. The idea is that AmShZ can block all roads except the ones that lead to the optimal path, thereby forcing Keshi's movement towards the target.\n\nBut how does this relate to the distance calculation here? Let's think of it in terms of dynamic programming. For a node u, the minimal days required to reach n from u is the maximum between the minimal days required from each of its outgoing neighbors plus the time it takes to block the other roads. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, if AmShZ can block all roads except the one leading to the best next node, then each move would take one day (the move) plus the number of roads that need to be blocked before that.\n\nWait, another way: Suppose Keshi is at node u. The optimal strategy is for AmShZ to block all outgoing roads except the one that leads to a node with the smallest possible d. But each day, AmShZ can block one road. So, if the current node u has k outgoing roads, then to eliminate all but the best road, AmShZ would need to block (k-1) roads. Each day he can block one, so that takes (k-1) days. Then, on the (k)th day, he tells Keshi to move, which would take him to the desired node. So the total days added for this step is (k-1) + 1 = k days. But if the out-degree is k, then the number of roads to block is (k-1), taking (k-1) days, then 1 day to move, so total (k) days. But in this case, the minimal days for node u would be the minimal days of its best neighbor plus (k-1) + 1 days.\n\nBut the code is using in[i], which is the original out-degree. Wait, but in the reversed graph, when processing x (original node u), and i is a predecessor in the reversed graph (original node v_i has a road to u), then for node i (original v_i), the out-degree is in[i] (since in[i] counts the number of outgoing roads from v_i in the original graph). So when considering moving from v_i to u, the out-degree of v_i is in[i]. \n\nSo the distance for v_i would be the distance from u plus (in[i] - 1) + 1. Because AmShZ has to block all roads except the one leading to u. The (in[i] - 1) is the number of days needed to block the other roads, and then 1 day to move. But (in[i] -1 +1) = in[i] days. So the total days would be the distance from u plus in[i]. But wait, in the code, the condition is checking if dis[i] can be updated to dis[x] (the distance of x) plus in[i]. And then pushing that into the priority queue.\n\nBut why in[i] and not something else? Let's see. For example, if the out-degree of node i in the original graph is 3. Then AmShZ needs to block 2 roads, taking 2 days, then on the third day, tell Keshi to move. So total 3 days added. So the distance would be 3 + the distance of the next node. So for each node i, the distance is the distance of x (next node) plus the out-degree of i. That's what the code is doing here: dis[i] = dis[x] + in[i], where in[i] is the out-degree of i in the original graph.\n\nBut why is in[i] being decremented after checking the condition? Hmm. Let's think again. When processing a node x (original node u) in the reversed graph, for each of its predecessors i (original node v_i with a road to u), the code checks if the current dis[i] can be updated to dis[x] + in[i]. Then, in[i] is decremented. \n\nWait, perhaps the out-degree is being adjusted. Because if there's another path from i to x via a different edge, then the out-degree of i (in the original graph) would have other edges. But when considering the best possible path, maybe the minimal distance for i is the minimal of (distance of x + (remaining out-degree)). Hmm, maybe the code is using a priority queue to select the best possible path. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as a modified BFS where the cost to move from node i to x (original u) is the number of outgoing edges of i (in[i]). So for each edge from i to x (in the reversed graph, which is original edge from x to i?), wait, maybe I'm getting the direction wrong. Wait, the reversed graph is built such that for each original edge from a to b, the reversed graph has an edge from b to a. So the code is building the reversed adjacency list. So when processing x (original u), the edges are from x to its predecessors in the original graph. Wait, no. If the original edge is from a to b, then in the code, it's stored as v[b].push_back(a). So in the reversed graph, the edges are from b to a. So the reversed graph's edges are the reverse of the original edges. So when we run Dijkstra on the reversed graph starting from n, we're finding the shortest paths in this reversed graph, which correspond to the paths from the original nodes to n. \n\nBut the distance calculation is using in[i], which is the original out-degree of node i. So for each i (original node), when we find an edge from x (original u) to i in the reversed graph (so original edge from i to u), we check if the distance to i can be updated. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is working as follows: For each node in the reversed graph (i.e., original node), the distance is the minimal number of days needed to reach n from that node. When processing a node x (original u), for each original edge from i to u (so in the reversed graph, there's an edge x -> i?), no, wait, the reversed graph's edge is from u to i (since original edge is from i to u). Wait, the original edge is from v_i to u_i. So the code adds to v[u_i].push_back(v_i), and in the reversed graph, each edge is from u_i to v_i. So when processing x (which is u_i in the original), the adjacency list for x contains the v_i's (original edges from v_i to x). So the reversed graph's edges are from x to v_i, meaning that in the original graph, there's an edge from v_i to x. \n\nSo when the code processes x, it's looking at all original nodes v_i that have an edge pointing to x. So in the original graph, v_i can reach x directly. \n\nThe idea is that to compute the minimal days for node i (original v_i), we need to consider the minimal days of all nodes that can be reached from i in one step (in the original graph). But since the reversed graph is being used, we're processing x (original u) and looking at all i that have edges to x in the original graph. \n\nThe key part is the condition for updating dis[i]. The code is checking if dis[i] can be updated to dis[x] + in[i], where in[i] is the out-degree of i in the original graph. Then, after that, in[i] is decremented by 1. \n\nWait, the in[i] is the out-degree of i in the original graph. So when i has an edge to x in the original graph, when we process this edge (as part of the reversed graph's x's adjacency list), we first check if using this edge can lead to a better distance for i. \n\nBut why are we decrementing in[i] after that? Let's think of in[i] as the number of outgoing edges from i that have not yet been considered. Because, for a node i, if there are multiple outgoing edges (say, to x1, x2, ... xk), each time we process one of them (i.e., when x1 is processed, then x2, etc.), the in[i] (original out-degree) is being decremented. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the minimal distance for i is dis[x] + (current in[i] - 1) + 1. Because when considering the edge from i to x, the number of edges left from i is (in[i] -1). Because in[i] is the original out-degree, and each time we process an edge, we decrement in[i], which represents that we've considered that edge. So when processing the edge i->x, the remaining edges (other than this one) is (in[i] -1). So to block all except this edge, AmShZ would need (in[i] -1) days to block, plus 1 day to move. So total in[i] days. \n\nBut then, for each edge from i to x, the distance would be dis[x] + (current in[i]). Because when this edge is considered, the in[i] represents the number of edges that would need to be blocked (current in[i] is the original out-degree minus the number of edges we've already processed). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose i has an out-degree of k. Each time we process an edge from i to some x, the in[i] is decremented by 1. So the first time we process an edge from i to x1, the in[i] is k-1. Then, the next edge, in[i] is k-2, etc. \n\nSo when we process an edge from i to x, the in[i] at that time is (original out-degree - number of edges already processed). \n\nSo for this edge, the cost to choose this path would be (in[i] (current value)) + 1 (the day to move). But wait, no. Because AmShZ can block the other (current in[i]) edges. Wait, the current in[i] after processing previous edges. Wait, for example, if i has 3 edges. The first edge processed (to x1) has in[i] = 3-0=3. So blocking the other 2 edges would take 2 days, then move. So total 3 days. The next edge (to x2) would have in[i] =3-1=2. So when processing this edge, the remaining edges from i are 2 (original out-degree minus edges processed so far). But if this edge is chosen, then the number of days would be (number of other edges) +1. The other edges are (in[i] -1) because we have already processed some edges. So for the first edge, the in[i] is 3 (original out-degree), so blocking 2 edges (3-1) gives 2 days, then 1 day to move: total 3 days. For the second edge, in[i] is 2, so blocking (2-1) =1 day, plus 1 day to move: 2 days. So the minimal days would be min(3 + days for x1, 2 + days for x2, ...).\n\nSo the formula for the distance of i is dis[x] + (current in[i] value). Because current in[i] value is (original out-degree - edges processed so far). When you choose this edge, the number of days is (current in[i] value) days (since (current in[i] -1) days to block the other edges, plus 1 day to move).\n\nSo the code's logic is: for each edge from i to x in the original graph (processed in reverse), check if the current distance for i can be updated to dis[x] + (current in[i]). \n\nSo the condition in the code is whether dis[i] can be updated to dis[x] + in[i], where in[i] is the current value (original out-degree minus the number of edges already processed). \n\nBut how does this work with the priority queue? Since we're using a min-heap, the first time a node is processed with the minimal distance, we can be sure that this is the minimal possible distance. Because once in[i] is decremented, the next edges would have a lower in[i] value, leading to a lower distance. \n\nFor example, if i has edges to x1, x2, x3, and the distances of x1, x2, x3 are 0, 1, 2 respectively. Then, processing the edge to x1 first (when in[i] is 3) would give a distance of 3 +0 =3. Then, when in[i] becomes 2, processing the edge to x2 gives distance 2 +1=3. Then, when in[i] is 1, processing x3 gives 1 +2=3. So the minimal is 3. But this might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the first processed edge gives the minimal possible distance, and subsequent edges are ignored because the distance is already set. \n\nWait, the code uses a priority queue sorted by the current distance. So the first time a node is popped from the queue, its distance is the minimal possible. So once a node is popped, any further entries in the queue for that node with higher distances are ignored (since the code checks if dis[x] != y then continue).\n\nTherefore, when processing edges for i, the code must consider all possible edges, and the minimal distance for i is the minimum among (dis[x] + in[i] after processing each edge). \n\nWait, no. Because each time we process an edge from i to x, the in[i] is decremented. So the first edge processed (say, to x) will have a higher in[i] value than the next edges. So if we process the edges in the reversed graph in the order that the nodes x have lower distances, then the first edge processed (with higher in[i]) may result in a higher distance for i, but later edges (with lower in[i]) could give a better distance. \n\nThis suggests that the code is using a greedy approach where the minimal distance for i is the minimum possible (dis[x] + in[i] after considering all edges from i to x, with in[i] being the current value when that edge is processed). \n\nBut how is the in[i] being managed here? Let's take an example. Suppose node i has out-degree 3 (original), with edges to x1, x2, x3. In the reversed graph, these edges are x1 \u2192 i, x2 \u2192 i, x3 \u2192 i. So when the code processes x1 (the node with the minimal distance first?), then for each of its reversed edges (i in x1's adjacency list), which corresponds to the original edge from i to x1. So when x1 is processed, the code iterates over all nodes i that have an original edge to x1. \n\nIn that iteration, for each such i, the code checks if dis[i] can be updated to dis[x1] + in[i], and then decrements in[i]. \n\nSuppose x1's distance is 0. Then, the initial in[i] for i is 3. So the code would set dis[i] to 0+3=3. Then in[i] becomes 2. Then, when x2 is processed (with distance 1), the code checks the edge from i to x2. At this point, in[i] is 2. So dis[i] would be 1 + 2=3. But since dis[i] was already set to 3, it doesn't change. Then in[i] becomes 1. Then, when x3 is processed (distance 2), in[i] is 1. So dis[i] would be 2+1=3. Again, same as before. So the minimal distance for i is 3. \n\nBut what if x3's distance is lower? For example, if x3's distance is 0. Suppose the edges are processed in the order x3, x2, x1. Then, when x3 is processed first (distance 0), in[i] is 3. So dis[i] becomes 0+3=3, in[i] becomes 2. Then x2 (distance 1) comes, in[i] is 2, so 1+2=3. Then x1 (distance 2) comes, in[i] is 1, 2+1=3. So again, same result. \n\nSo in this approach, regardless of the order in which the edges are processed, the minimal distance is the sum of the minimal x's distance plus the current in[i] (which depends on the number of edges processed before). \n\nBut why does this work? Because the code is using a priority queue to process the nodes in order of their current minimal distance. So nodes with smaller distances are processed first. \n\nSo the key is that for each node i, the minimal distance is determined by the earliest processed edge (the one leading to the smallest x's distance), but with in[i] being the number of outgoing edges remaining when that edge is processed. \n\nWait, perhaps the logic is that when you have multiple possible next nodes (x) to go to from i, the optimal path is to choose the x with the minimal (dis[x] + (k - t)), where k is the original out-degree of i, and t is the number of edges processed before this one. Because t edges have been processed (blocked), so the remaining edges are (k - t), so the days needed would be (k - t - 1) days to block the others, plus 1 day to move. So (k - t) days. So for each edge processed in the reversed graph, the code is considering the possible days if that edge is chosen as the last one to remain (after blocking the others). \n\nBut since the code processes the edges in the order determined by the priority queue, which prioritizes nodes with smaller distances, the first time an edge is processed (from x to i in the reversed graph) that gives the minimal possible (dis[x] + in[i]) for i, that becomes the minimal distance. Because subsequent edges would have in[i] decremented, leading to lower (dis[x] + in[i]) values. But once the distance for i is set, any further updates would not happen because the condition dis[i] would already be lower. \n\nWait, no. Suppose a node i has edges to x1 and x2. x1 has distance 1, x2 has distance 2. \n\nWhen x1 is processed first (distance 1), in[i] is 2 (original out-degree is 2). So dis[i] = 1 + 2 = 3. Then in[i] is decremented to 1. \n\nThen x2 is processed (distance 2), in[i] is 1. So dis[i] could be 2 + 1 = 3. But since dis[i] is already 3, no update occurs. \n\nBut what if x2 is processed first? Then in[i] is 2, dis[i] is 2 + 2=4. Then in[i] becomes 1. Then x1 is processed, in[i] is 1. So dis[i] is updated to 1 +1=2. That's better. \n\nWait, this suggests that the order in which the edges are processed affects the outcome. But the code uses a priority queue sorted by the current distance of the node (x), so the nodes with the smallest distance are processed first. \n\nIn the example above, if x1 has a distance of 1 and x2 has a distance of 2, then x1 is processed before x2. So when x1's edge is processed, in[i] is 2, leading to dis[i] = 3. Then when x2's edge is processed, in[i] is 1, leading to 2+1=3, but the distance is already 3. \n\nBut if x2 has a smaller distance than x1, then x2 is processed first. Then in[i] is 2, dis[i] =2 (distance of x2) +2 =4. Then in[i] becomes 1. Then x1's edge is processed, leading to 1 +1=2, which is better. So in this case, the order of processing nodes x1 and x2 affects the result. \n\nBut in the code, the priority queue ensures that nodes with the smallest distance are processed first. So, in the case where x1 has a smaller distance, it is processed first. This way, the code ensures that the earliest possible edges (those leading to nodes with the smallest distance) are considered first. \n\nBut how does this lead to the correct minimal distance for node i? \n\nLet's take another example. Suppose node i has two outgoing edges: to x (distance d) and to y (distance d'). Suppose d < d'. \n\nThe optimal path would be to choose x. To block the edge to y, which requires 1 day (since there are two edges). So the days would be (block one edge (1 day) + 1 day to move) = 2 days. So the total distance for i is 2 + d. \n\nBut if y is processed first (with higher distance), then in[i] is 2 (original out-degree is 2), so dis[i] is d' + 2. But if x is processed first, dis[i] is d + 2. \n\nBut in reality, the minimal days for i would be the minimum between (d + 2) and (d' + 1). Because if y's distance is d', and the code processed y first, then when x is processed, in[i] is 1, leading to d + 1. So in this case, the code would choose the minimal of d+1 and d' +2. \n\nSo the code's logic is that when processing nodes x in order of their distance, the edges from i to x (original) are processed in that order, and the code captures the minimal possible sum of the x's distance plus the current in[i]. \n\nBut this seems to require that the edges are processed in the order of increasing x's distance. Because if x is processed first (smaller distance), then in[i] is higher, leading to a larger sum. But perhaps in[i] is being decremented for subsequent edges, which could have a lower sum. \n\nBut the code uses a priority queue (min-heap) based on the distance of x, so nodes with smaller distances are processed first. So for node i, when processing x (with smaller distance), the in[i] is higher, leading to a higher sum. But when a node y with higher distance is processed later, the in[i] is lower, leading to a lower sum (y's distance + lower in[i]). \n\nBut how do we know that the code captures the minimal possible sum? \n\nLet's think of it as the minimal possible (dis[x] + (k - t)), where k is the original out-degree of i, and t is the number of edges processed before this one. To minimize this sum, we need to process edges in the order of increasing (dis[x] + (k - t)). \n\nBut how does the code's approach achieve this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct because whenever a node i's edge is processed, the sum (dis[x] + in[i]) is the best possible given the current state of in[i], and since in[i] is decremented each time, subsequent edges can't offer a better sum. \n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let's think of the code's algorithm as a way to compute for each node i the minimal value of (dis[x] + (k - t)), where t is the number of edges processed before the edge from i to x. \n\nThe minimal value would be when (dis[x] - t) is as small as possible, because (k - t) is subtracted. So, for each edge, the value is dis[x] + (k - t) = dis[x] - t + k. To minimize this, we need to process edges in the order of increasing (dis[x] - t). \n\nBut t is the number of edges processed before this one, which complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, where each time the minimal possible distance is picked from the priority queue, and the edges are processed. \n\nIn the code, when processing a node x (original node u), for each i (original node v_i that has an edge to u), the code checks if the current distance for i can be updated to dis[x] + in[i]. Then, in[i] is decremented. \n\nSo the in[i] variable here is being used to track the remaining out-degree (original) minus the number of edges processed. So the first time an edge from i is processed (original edge from i to x), in[i] is the original out-degree. Then, each subsequent processing of an edge from i to another node x' will have in[i] decremented by 1. \n\nThe key idea is that for each edge from i to x, the minimal days needed to reach n from i would be dis[x] (days needed from x) plus the number of days needed to block the other edges from i. \n\nSince AmShZ can block roads each day, the optimal strategy is to block all edges from i except the one leading to the x with minimal (dis[x] + (k - t)), where k is the original out-degree of i and t is the number of edges processed before this one. \n\nBut how does the code account for this? \n\nPerhaps the code is correct because it greedily chooses the minimal possible (dis[x] + in[i]) for each i. Since in[i] is the current out-degree (original) minus the number of edges processed so far, the code considers each possible edge and keeps track of the minimal sum. \n\nThe code's condition for updating dis[i] is if the new distance (dis[x] + in[i]) is less than the current dis[i]. \n\nSo, the missing code in the if statement is checking whether dis[i] can be updated to a smaller value. So the condition is:\n\nif (dis[i] > dis[x] + in[i])\n\nBecause initially, dis[i] is set to a large value (0x3f3f3f3f or similar), and whenever a better (smaller) distance is found, it is updated. \n\nThus, the missing code in the if condition is whether dis[i] is greater than dis[x] + in[i]. \n\nIn the code, the line inside the for loop is:\n\nif (/* TODO: Your code here */) dis[i] = dis[x] + in[i], p.push(...)\n\nSo the condition is checking if the current stored distance for i is larger than the computed distance via x. So the condition is:\n\ndis[i] > dis[x] + in[i]\n\nSo the correct code to fill in is:\n\ndis[i] > dis[x] + in[i]\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nBecause when processing node x (original u), for each edge in the reversed graph (from x to i, which is original edge from i to u), we check if taking this edge as the chosen path for i would result in a better (smaller) distance. The new distance for i would be the distance of x (u's distance) plus the current in[i], which is the out-degree of i (original) minus the number of edges processed so far. \n\nSo the condition is whether this new sum is smaller than the current known distance for i. If so, we update it and push it into the priority queue. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the missing code is the condition that dis[i] is greater than the sum of dis[x] and the current in[i]. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the if statement is:\n\ndis[i] > dis[x] + in[i]"
