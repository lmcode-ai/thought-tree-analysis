Because when AmShZ blocks those edges first, each takes a day, then the move day. But I'm getting stuck here. Let's look at the code's structure again. The code is a modified Dijkstra's algorithm. The nodes are processed starting from n, and the dp array tracks the minimal days required to reach n from each node. For each node x, when we process it (with the minimal current cost), we look at all its predecessors y in the original graph (since the reversed graph's edges are rootinv[x] which contains y where y->x is an original edge). For each such y, we calculate a cost and see if we can update the dp[y]. The key part is the condition in the if statement. The code currently has: \n\nif # TODO: Your code here\n    dp[y] = dp[x] + cost\n    heappush(hp, (dp[y], y)) So the missing condition is the one that checks whether the new cost (dp[x] + cost) is less than the current dp[y]. So the code is trying to compute the minimal dp[y] as the minimum between its current value and dp[x] + cost. So the condition should be if dp[y] > dp[x] + cost, then update. So the missing line would be something like:\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + cost: But how is cost computed? In the code, cost is no[y] +1. But why? Let's think. For each edge y->x in the original graph, when we are at y, the cost to move from y to x would be the number of edges that need to be blocked before using this edge. Because AmShZ can block the other edges in the days before the move. But how many edges are those? For example, if y has k outgoing edges, and the optimal path uses one of them. The minimal days required is (k-1) days to block all other edges, and then 1 day to move. So total of k days. But in the code, when processing the edge y->x, the cost is no[y] +1. no[y] is the original out-degree of y minus the number of edges processed from y before this one.",

So the condition is: if dp[y] > c + cost, then we update. But c is the current dp[x], which is the cost up to x. \n\nWait, the code uses the variable c as the current cost for x. So when we process x with cost c, and for each y in rootinv[x], we calculate the new cost as c + cost, where cost is no[y] (after decrement) +1. So the missing line is: if dp[y] > dp[x] + cost. So the code should check if the current dp[y] is larger than the computed value (dp[x] + cost). If yes, then update. Thus, the missing code is: if dp[y] > dp[x] + cost:\n\nSo filling that in would complete the condition. Let's test this logic. Let's look at the first sample input from the problem statement. Sample Input 1:\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n\nSample Output: 1\n\nThe optimal path is 1 \u21923. So dp[3] is 0. Then, for node 3, we look at nodes in rootinv[3], which are 1 and 2. Processing node 3 (c=0). For y=2 (edge 2\u21923), subtract 1 from no[2]. no[2] was originally 1 (since it has one outgoing edge, 2\u21923). After subtracting, no[2] is 0. cost is 0 +1 =1. So dp[2] is 0+1=1. For y=1 (edge 1\u21923), subtract 1 from no[1]. no[1] was 2 (since 1 has edges to 2 and 3). After subtracting, no[1] is 1. cost is 1+1=2. So dp[1] would be 0+2=2. But then, when processing node 2 (c=1), for its rootinv[2], which is nodes that have edges to 2. For example, node 1 (edge 1\u21922). Subtract 1 from no[1] (now no[1] is 0). cost is 0+1=1. So dp[1] would be 1+1=2. Which is the same as before. But the correct answer is 1. How does this code handle it? Wait, in the first sample, the answer is 1. But according to the code's calculation, when processing node 3's edge to 1 (y=1), the cost is 2. So dp[1] would be 2. But the sample output is 1. Hmm, that suggests there's an error in the code's approach. Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the code is actually correct. Let me re-examine the sample input.

The no array is initialized as the out-degree of each node:\n\nno[1] = 2 (since node 1 has two outgoing roads: 1\u21922 and 1\u21923). no[2] = 1 (road 2\u21923). no[3] = 0.

For y=2:\n\nno[y] (which is 1) is decremented by 1 \u2192 0. cost =0+1=1. dp[2] is currently 1e18. So dp[2] becomes 0+1=1. Push (1,2) into heap. For y=1:\n\nno[y] (2) is decremented by 1 \u21921.\n\ncost=1+1=2. dp[1] is 1e18. So dp[1] becomes 0+2=2. Push (2,1) into heap. Now, the heap has (1,2) and (2,1). Next, we process (1,2). c=1, x=2. For each y in rootinv[2], which is 1 (road 1\u21922). no[y] (currently 1) is decremented by 1 \u21920.\n\ncost=0+1=1. dp[y=1] is 2. Check if 2>1+1 \u2192 2>2 \u2192 no. So no update.

So the code's approach is to process the edges in reverse order and calculate the cost as (remaining edges from u) +1. But how does that work? For example, in the first sample, the path is 1\u21923. The number of edges from 1 that are after this edge in the processing order is zero (if this edge is processed last). So the cost is 0+1=1. So the code's calculation would then give dp[1] =0 +1=1, which matches the sample output. But how to adjust the code to achieve this? The current code processes edges in the order determined by the reversed graph. The key is to process the edges in the order that minimizes the cost.",

But how does this affect the cost for the edge 1\u21923? Ah, no. Because the edge 1\u21923 is processed when node 3 is processed. The code for node 3's processing already added y=1 and y=2 to the heap. So the no[y] for y=1 is decremented once when processing node 3. But when processing node 2, we process the edge y=1 (original edge 1\u21922), which decrements no[1] to 1. But the edge 1\u21923 was processed earlier, leading to a cost of 2. So the code's current approach does not allow for the optimal processing order. Thus, the code's approach is incorrect. So what is the correct way to model this problem?",

So those edges must be blocked, each requiring one day. Thus, the cost is no[y] (number of edges to block) + 1 (move day). So for the first sample, when processing edge 1\u21923 (original), the no[y=1] is 1 (since after processing this edge, no[y] is 2-1=1). So cost is 1+1=2. But the sample output is 1. So this suggests that the code is incorrect. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 1. Thus, there's a contradiction.",

The correct cost should be (out_degree[u] -1) +1 = out_degree[u], regardless of the processing order. So, the code's mistake is in the way the cost is computed. Thus, the correct code should compute cost as (no[y] +1) when the code is processing the edge. Wait, but no[y] is the original out_degree minus the number of processed edges from y. For example, if we process the edges in reverse order, the first edge from y would have no[y] = original_out_degree -1 (since it's the first one processed). But the correct cost is (original_out_degree -1) +1 = original_out_degree. But in the code's approach, when processing edges in reverse order, the first edge's cost would be (original_out_degree -1) +1 = original_out_degree. The second edge's cost would be (original_out_degree -2) +1 = original_out_degree -1. So the code's approach gives varying costs for different edges from the same node. But the correct cost for each edge from y should be (original_out_degree -1) +1 = original_out_degree. Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

In the code, no[y] is initialized as the original_out_degree of y. So, the correct cost would be no[y] (original) +0. But no[y] is modified during processing. Thus, the code should store the original out_degree of y in another array. So, the code should have an array, say, out_degree, which is initialized as no[y] before any processing. Then, cost = out_degree[y] Thus, in the code, the line would be:\n\ncost = out_degree[y]\n\nBut where is out_degree stored?",

But during processing, no[y] is modified. Thus, the code should store the original out_degree in a separate array. But the code currently does not do that. Thus, the code's mistake is that it uses a modified no[y] in the cost calculation. The correct approach is to use the original out_degree of y. Thus, the code should have a separate array for the original out_degree. But in the given code, the code initializes no[u] +=1 for each edge, which makes no[u] the original out_degree. But during processing, no[y] is modified. Thus, to correct the code, we need to store the original out_degree in a separate array. For example:\n\noriginal_out = [0]*(n+2)\nfor i in range(m):\n    u,v = map(int, input().split())\n    root[u].append(v)\n    rootinv[v].append(u)\n    original_out[u] +=1\n\nThen, in the cost calculation, use original_out[y] instead of no[y]. But the code currently uses no[y], which is modified. Thus, the cost calculation should be:\n\ncost = original_out[y] But then, in the code's current logic, the no[y] is being used for something else. But according to the correct model, the cost is the original out_degree of y. Thus, the code's current cost calculation is incorrect. Thus, the correct code should have:\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + original_out[y]:\n    dp[y] = dp[x] + original_out[y]\n    heappush( ... ) But how to implement this in the given code?

But no[y] is the original out_degree of y, then decremented each time an edge from y is processed. Thus, when processing the first edge from y, no[y] is original_out_degree -1.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what code to fill in the missing part here. The problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can meet after at most d days. \n\nLooking at the code, it's using Dijkstra's algorithm. The dp array is initialized with a large value except dp[n] which is 0. The heap starts with (0, n), which suggests that we're processing nodes starting from the destination (n) backwards to the source (1). \n\nThe main idea here is to model the problem as a shortest path problem where the cost to reach a node y from x is calculated in a certain way. The rootinv is probably the adjacency list for the reversed graph. So, for each node x, we look at all nodes y that can reach x directly (since the roads are directed, the reversed edges would be from y to x in the original graph).\n\nThe no array seems to track the out-degree of each node. Wait, in the loop where roads are added, for each road u->v, they add v to root[u], and u to rootinv[v]. Then, no[u] is incremented. So no[u] counts the number of outgoing edges from u. So, no[y] would be the number of original outgoing edges from y. But when processing node x (which is part of the reversed graph), we look at rootinv[x], which are the nodes y such that there's an edge y->x in the original graph. So for each such y, when considering moving from y to x, perhaps this is part of the path from 1 to n.\n\nIn the code, for each y in rootinv[x], they subtract 1 from no[y]. Hmm. Wait, no[y] starts as the original out-degree of y. Then, when processing x, which is a node in the reversed graph (so original edges to x), for each y that has an edge to x, when considering this edge, the code subtracts 1 from no[y]. So perhaps this is keeping track of the number of edges that are still unblocked when building the path.\n\nThe cost variable is set to no[y] + 1. So the cost for moving from y to x would be the number of edges that AmShZ has to block plus the day of movement. Because for each day when AmShZ tells Keshi to move, he might have to block all other outgoing edges except the one on the path. \n\nLet me think about the strategy. The minimal days d is the minimal maximum days required. For each node y on the path from 1 to n, when moving from y to x (the next node in the reversed Dijkstra's approach), the cost is the number of edges that need to be blocked before this edge can be chosen. Because AmShZ can block all other edges except this one, so that Keshi has no choice but to take this edge. The number of blocks required would be the number of outgoing edges from y minus 1 (since each block takes a day, and they have to block all other edges first, one per day). But also, once all those are blocked, the move takes one day. So total cost is (number of edges to block) + 1. Which is (no[y] - 1) +1 = no[y]. Wait, but no[y] is the original out-degree. For example, if y had 3 outgoing edges, and we choose one of them as the path. Then, we need to block the other 2 edges. Each block takes a day. So AmShZ would send a block message for each of those 2 edges, which takes 2 days. Then on the third day, he tells Keshi to move, and since only the desired edge is left, Keshi takes it. So the total days added here are 2 (blocks) + 1 (move) = 3. Wait, but 2+1 is 3. But the original no[y] is 3. So 3 is the cost here. So cost is indeed no[y].\n\nWait, but in the code, the cost is set to no[y] +1. Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-express. Suppose the current node is x, and we are looking at y in the reversed edges (original edge y->x). Then, when y is being considered, the no[y] is the original out-degree minus the number of times we have processed edges from y. Because each time we process an edge from y to some x, we subtract 1 from no[y]. So no[y] in this context might represent the number of outgoing edges that have not yet been considered as part of the path. So for each such y, when we process this edge, the number of edges remaining to block would be no[y] (since the remaining edges would be blocked before this one can be used). So the cost would be (no[y] - 1) + 1 = no[y]. But why is the code using cost=no[y]+1?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the variables. Let's think again. When processing y (as a predecessor of x in the reversed graph), the no[y] has been decremented each time an edge from y to any other node was processed. Because in the code, when processing x, for each y in rootinv[x], which is all nodes that have an edge to x in the original graph, the code subtracts 1 from no[y]. So no[y] is the original out-degree minus the number of edges from y that have been processed before. \n\nSo, suppose y has three outgoing edges: a, b, c. The first time we process an edge from y (say to x), no[y] is 3. Then subtract 1, becomes 2. The next time, no[y] would be 2, subtract 1, becomes 1, etc. \n\nSo for the first edge from y (to x), no[y] is 3. Then the cost is no[y] +1? That would be 4. But according to the problem, the cost for that edge should be the number of days required to block the other edges plus the move day. For example, in the first case, if y has 3 outgoing edges, and this is the first edge processed, then the other two edges would need to be blocked (two days), then the move day (third day). So total 3 days. But 3 is no[y] (3) plus 1 (3+1=4) is not matching. So maybe there's a mistake in the cost calculation here.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using a different approach. Let's think about the problem again. The minimal d is computed as the maximum possible time to reach n from 1, considering that at each step AmShZ blocks all other roads except the ones along the optimal path. \n\nIn Dijkstra's approach here, the dp array represents the minimal days required to reach the destination from each node. For node n, it's 0 days. For other nodes, we compute the minimal days. \n\nWhen considering a node y, and an edge from y to x, the cost to reach x from y is the number of other outgoing edges from y (i.e., the number that need to be blocked) plus 1 (the day of moving). But the number of other edges is (original out-degree of y - 1). So cost is (original out-degree - 1) + 1 = original out-degree. \n\nBut in the code, no[y] is the original out-degree minus the number of edges processed so far from y. Wait, no. Let's see. The code initializes no[y] as the original out-degree. Then, each time an edge from y to x (i.e., an edge in the reversed graph) is processed, no[y] is decremented by 1. So, for the first edge processed from y, no[y] is original_out_degree. Then after subtracting 1, it's original_out_degree -1. But the code uses the value of no[y] before subtracting? Wait no. Let me look again.\n\nIn the code:\n\nfor y in rootinv[x]:\n    no[y] -=1\n    cost = no[y] +1\n    if ... \n\nWait, no[y] is decremented first, then cost is calculated. So for the first edge from y, no[y] was originally the out-degree of y, but after decrementing, it's (original -1). Then cost is (original -1) +1 = original. \n\nAh! So that's the key. So, when processing edge y -> x (original direction), which is part of the reversed graph (so x's predecessors in the reversed graph are the original edges to x). \n\nBut in the code, when processing x, for each y in rootinv[x], which are the nodes with edges to x in the original graph. For each such y, the code subtracts 1 from no[y], which is the original out-degree of y. Then the cost is no[y] (which is original_out_degree -1 after the subtraction) plus 1. \n\nWait, but original_out_degree -1 +1 = original_out_degree. So cost is original_out_degree. \n\nWait, but no[y] was decremented by 1 before cost calculation. So for example, if y has an out-degree of 3. The first edge processed from y would cause no[y] to become 2. Then cost is 2 +1 =3. Which equals original_out_degree (3). Then, the next edge processed from y would have no[y] =2-1=1, cost is 1+1=2. Which is original_out_degree -1 (3-1=2). Hmm, that's not matching. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is designed to represent the number of edges that have not yet been processed. So for each edge from y, when processed, the code reduces no[y] by 1. The cost for using this edge would be the current no[y] (after decrementing) plus 1. \n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose y has three outgoing edges: e1, e2, e3. \n\nProcessing e1 (y->x1) first:\n- no[y] was 3, subtract 1 \u2192 2\n- cost = 2 +1 =3.\n\nProcessing e2 (y->x2) next:\n- no[y] was 2, subtract 1 \u21921\n- cost =1+1=2.\n\nProcessing e3 (y->x3) last:\n- no[y] was1, subtract 1 \u21920\n- cost=0+1=1.\n\nBut the original out-degree is 3. So the cost for each edge is 3, 2, 1. \n\nBut how does this relate to the minimal days? \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when AmShZ wants to guide Keshi along a path, he can block all other edges except the ones on the path. But the order in which the edges are processed affects how many need to be blocked. \n\nFor example, if the optimal path uses the first edge (e1), then the number of edges that need to be blocked is the number of edges that are processed after e1 (since those would have been blocked before e1 is considered). Wait, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to model the worst-case scenario where, for each edge in the path, the number of edges that are not part of the path but are processed after this edge. Because when AmShZ blocks those edges first, each takes a day, then the move day. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let's look at the code's structure again. The code is a modified Dijkstra's algorithm. The nodes are processed starting from n, and the dp array tracks the minimal days required to reach n from each node. \n\nFor each node x, when we process it (with the minimal current cost), we look at all its predecessors y in the original graph (since the reversed graph's edges are rootinv[x] which contains y where y->x is an original edge). For each such y, we calculate a cost and see if we can update the dp[y]. \n\nThe key part is the condition in the if statement. The code currently has: \n\nif # TODO: Your code here\n    dp[y] = dp[x] + cost\n    heappush(hp, (dp[y], y))\n\nSo the missing condition is the one that checks whether the new cost (dp[x] + cost) is less than the current dp[y]. \n\nSo the code is trying to compute the minimal dp[y] as the minimum between its current value and dp[x] + cost. So the condition should be if dp[y] > dp[x] + cost, then update. \n\nSo the missing line would be something like:\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + cost:\n\nBut how is cost computed? \n\nIn the code, cost is no[y] +1. \n\nBut why? Let's think. For each edge y->x in the original graph, when we are at y, the cost to move from y to x would be the number of edges that need to be blocked before using this edge. Because AmShZ can block the other edges in the days before the move. \n\nBut how many edges are those? For example, if y has k outgoing edges, and the optimal path uses one of them. The minimal days required is (k-1) days to block all other edges, and then 1 day to move. So total of k days. \n\nBut in the code, when processing the edge y->x, the cost is no[y] +1. no[y] is the original out-degree of y minus the number of edges processed from y before this one. \n\nSo, for example, if this is the first edge processed from y, then no[y] is original_out_degree -1 (since after subtracting 1). Then cost is (original_out_degree-1) +1 = original_out_degree. \n\nIf this is the second edge processed, then no[y] after subtraction is (original_out_degree-2), cost is (original_out_degree-2) +1 = original_out_degree -1. \n\nHmm. So the code's cost for each edge is varying based on the order in which edges are processed. \n\nBut why is that? Because for the first edge processed from y, the cost is original_out_degree, but for the next, it's original_out_degree-1, etc. \n\nThis suggests that the code is trying to model that if we choose to use a certain edge from y, the cost depends on how many edges we have to block before that edge becomes the only option. \n\nWait, perhaps the approach is that when building the path, for each edge from y to x, the number of edges that are processed after this edge in the reversed graph. Because when those edges are processed later, it means that AmShZ can block them first, allowing Keshi to take this edge. \n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that when processing edges in reverse order (from the destination), each time we process an edge y->x, we calculate how many edges from y have already been processed (i.e., how many edges from y that are processed after this one). Because those edges would need to be blocked before this edge can be used. \n\nFor example, suppose y has three edges: a, b, c. If we process a first, then when using a, the edges b and c would need to be blocked. So two days of blocking, then one day of moving: total 3 days. \n\nBut if we process c first, then using c would require blocking a and b: two days, then move. \n\nBut in the code's calculation, for edge a (processed first), the cost would be original_out_degree (3) \u2192 cost=3. For edge b (processed second), cost would be original_out_degree -1 (3-1=2). For edge c (processed third), cost would be 3-2=1. \n\nSo the code is giving higher priority to edges processed later (lower cost). \n\nBut why? Because when you process an edge later, the number of remaining edges (no[y]) is smaller, leading to a lower cost. \n\nSo the code's approach is to model the minimal possible cost for each edge based on the order in which they are processed. \n\nThe idea is that the earliest processed edges (from y's perspective) have higher costs, and later ones have lower. So the algorithm tries to process edges in a way that allows for minimal cost. \n\nBut this seems to require that the edges are processed in the reverse order of their original out-degree. Wait, not sure. \n\nThe main thing is that the code uses a priority queue (heap) to select the next node with the minimal current cost, and processes its reversed edges. \n\nSo, the code for the missing line is to check if dp[y] is greater than the sum of dp[x] and cost. If so, then update dp[y] and push into the heap. \n\nSo the condition is: if dp[y] > c + cost, then we update. But c is the current dp[x], which is the cost up to x. \n\nWait, the code uses the variable c as the current cost for x. So when we process x with cost c, and for each y in rootinv[x], we calculate the new cost as c + cost, where cost is no[y] (after decrement) +1. \n\nSo the missing line is: if dp[y] > dp[x] + cost. \n\nSo the code should check if the current dp[y] is larger than the computed value (dp[x] + cost). If yes, then update. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + cost:\n\nSo filling that in would complete the condition. \n\nLet's test this logic. Let's look at the first sample input from the problem statement. \n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n\nSample Output: 1\n\nThe optimal path is 1 \u21923. So dp[3] is 0. Then, for node 3, we look at nodes in rootinv[3], which are 1 and 2. \n\nProcessing node 3 (c=0). For y=2 (edge 2\u21923), subtract 1 from no[2]. no[2] was originally 1 (since it has one outgoing edge, 2\u21923). After subtracting, no[2] is 0. cost is 0 +1 =1. So dp[2] is 0+1=1. \n\nFor y=1 (edge 1\u21923), subtract 1 from no[1]. no[1] was 2 (since 1 has edges to 2 and 3). After subtracting, no[1] is 1. cost is 1+1=2. So dp[1] would be 0+2=2. \n\nBut then, when processing node 2 (c=1), for its rootinv[2], which is nodes that have edges to 2. For example, node 1 (edge 1\u21922). Subtract 1 from no[1] (now no[1] is 0). cost is 0+1=1. So dp[1] would be 1+1=2. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. How does this code handle it? \n\nWait, in the first sample, the answer is 1. But according to the code's calculation, when processing node 3's edge to 1 (y=1), the cost is 2. So dp[1] would be 2. But the sample output is 1. \n\nHmm, that suggests there's an error in the code's approach. Or maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the code is actually correct. Let me re-examine the sample input. \n\nSample Input 1: \n\n3 cities, 3 roads:\n1\u21922\n2\u21923\n1\u21923\n\nThe possible paths are 1\u21923 (direct), which takes 1 day (AmShZ just tells Keshi to move), and 1\u21922\u21923, which would take 2 days (move on day 1, move on day 2). \n\nBut the optimal is to take the direct path. So the minimal d is 1. \n\nIn the code's calculation, dp[3] is 0. Then, for y=1 (edge 1\u21923), no[y] is initially 2 (since node 1 has two outgoing edges: to 2 and 3). After processing this edge, no[1] is 2-1=1. cost is 1 +1=2. So dp[1] is 0+2=2. But that's wrong. So what's the mistake here? \n\nAh, I see. The code's approach may have an error. Because in this case, the correct cost for using the direct edge 1\u21923 should be 1 day (just tell Keshi to move, no blocking needed). But according to the code's calculation, the cost is 2. \n\nSo why is that? Because the code's logic assumes that when using the edge y\u2192x (in this case 1\u21923), AmShZ has to block all other outgoing edges from y (1). Since 1 has two edges (to 2 and 3), the other edge (to 2) needs to be blocked. So that's one day of blocking, then one day of moving. So total 2 days. But that's not correct. \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when AmShZ sends a move message, Keshi will choose any reachable city. So if there are multiple options, he could choose any. So AmShZ has to block all other edges except the desired one to ensure that Keshi moves along the desired path. \n\nIn the first sample, the direct edge is available. So AmShZ can choose to send a move message on day 1. However, Keshi has two options: 2 and 3. So he might choose 2, which would not reach the destination. \n\nAh, right! So in this case, AmShZ cannot just send a move message. Because Keshi might choose either of the two edges. So to guarantee that Keshi reaches the destination, AmShZ must block the other edges first. \n\nWait, the problem states that AmShZ and Keshi want to make sure that after at most d days, they meet. So AmShZ must find a strategy that ensures that regardless of Keshi's choices, they meet. \n\nSo, for the first sample, the optimal strategy is to block the edge 1\u21922 on day 1. Then on day 2, send a move message, which allows Keshi to take 1\u21923. So total days is 2. But the sample output is 1. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. Oh wait, no. Wait the sample input's output is 1. So how is that possible? \n\nWait, perhaps the first sample explanation says that it's possible to send a move message on day 1, and Keshi could choose to go to 3 directly, but how can AmShZ ensure that he does that? \n\nThe problem statement says that AmShZ and Keshi want to find the smallest d such that they can make sure that they will see each other after at most d days. So, AmShZ's strategy must work no matter what choices Keshi makes. \n\nSo in the first sample, if AmShZ sends a move message on day 1, then Keshi has two options: 2 or 3. If he chooses 3, then they meet. If he chooses 2, then the next day AmShZ can block the edge 2\u21923 (but the problem says that each day AmShZ can send one message. So in this case, the initial approach of sending move on day 1 could lead to Keshi being at 2, then AmShZ has to block the other edges. \n\nSo this approach would require up to 3 days (day 1: move to 2; day 2: block 2\u21923, day 3: move but no options, remains. So that's bad. \n\nAh, but the sample output is 1. So perhaps the problem allows that if there's any possibility that Keshi can reach the destination in d days, but AmShZ's strategy must ensure that no matter what choices Keshi makes, he will reach within d days. \n\nWait, no. The problem says that AmShZ and Keshi want to make sure that after at most d days, they meet. So AmShZ has to choose a strategy where regardless of Keshi's choices, he will be at n after d days. \n\nSo in the first sample, if AmShZ chooses to not block any roads and just tell Keshi to move each day, then on day 1, Keshi could choose to go to 3 (so they meet). But if he chooses to go to 2, then on day 2, Keshi can move to 3, so they meet on day 2. So the maximum possible days is 2. But the sample output is 1, which suggests that there's a way to ensure it in 1 day. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 1. So how? \n\nAh, perhaps the sample explanation is that AmShZ can send a move message on day 1, and Keshi will reach n in 1 day. But that's only possible if the only path is directly to n. \n\nWait, but in the first sample, there are two edges: 1\u21922 and 1\u21923. So when Keshi is told to move, he can choose either. So to guarantee that he reaches n in 1 day, AmShZ must block the 1\u21922 edge on day 1. \n\nBut then, the first day's message is block 1\u21922. Then, Keshi can't use that road. So in the first day, he remains in city 1. Then, the next day, AmShZ sends move, and Keshi takes 1\u21923. So two days. But the sample output is 1. \n\nThis is confusing. So the sample explanation says that it's possible to have the answer 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is that AmShZ can send a move message on day 1. But Keshi could choose between 2 and 3. So if he chooses 3, then they meet in day 1. But if he chooses 2, then they don't. But the problem requires that the strategy must ensure that after at most d days, they meet regardless of Keshi's choices. So in this case, sending a move message on day 1 is not sufficient. \n\nAh, the sample explanation says that in the first sample, it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message. But how? Because Keshi can choose either path. So the only way this works is if there's a path where all other options are blocked. \n\nWait, the sample explanation must be incorrect. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, the first sample's input is:\n\n3 3\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\n1 3\n\nSample output is 1. \n\nSample explanation says that AmShZ can send the second type of message (move) and Keshi will arrive. But how? Because Keshi has two options: 2 and 3. If he chooses 2, then he doesn't reach n. So the strategy must ensure that regardless of Keshi's choice, he will end up at n after d days. \n\nBut that's not possible. So perhaps the problem's explanation is wrong. Or perhaps the problem allows that AmShZ can block some roads in the same day. \n\nNo, the problem statement says that each day, AmShZ can send one message: either block one road or move. \n\nSo for the first sample, the correct d is 2. But according to the sample output, it's 1. So there's a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows that when Keshi is told to move, if he is in city 1 and has two roads (1\u21922 and 1\u21923), but AmShZ can block all other roads except the one to 3 in the same day. But that's not allowed, because each day AmShZ can only block one road. \n\nAh, no. Each day, AmShZ can send one block message. So to block both 1\u21922 and 1\u21923 would take two days. \n\nBut the sample output is 1. So what's the correct approach? \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's read the problem statement again. \n\nWhen AmShZ sends a move message, Keshi will choose any reachable city. So if there are multiple options, he can choose any. But the strategy must guarantee that Keshi reaches n within d days, regardless of his choices. \n\nSo in the first sample, if there's a path that guarantees that Keshi reaches n in 1 day. How? \n\nThe only way is to block both of the other roads. But AmShZ can only block one road per day. So to block two roads, two days are needed. \n\nBut the sample output is 1. So perhaps there's a different interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1 because the minimal d is the shortest possible path, assuming that Keshi chooses the best possible option. But the problem says \"make sure that they will see each other after at most d days\", which implies that it must work regardless of Keshi's choices. \n\nThis suggests that the sample explanation is incorrect. But the sample output is 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement's sample explanation is wrong, or perhaps there's a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the sample input would return 1. \n\nLet's try to work through the code for the first sample. \n\nIn the code:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nRoads:\n\n1\u21922\n\n2\u21923\n\n1\u21923\n\nThe reversed graph (rootinv) for each node:\n\nrootinv[2] includes 1 (since there's a road 1\u21922).\n\nrootinv[3] includes 2 (road 2\u21923) and 1 (road 1\u21923).\n\nThe no array is initialized as the out-degree of each node:\n\nno[1] = 2 (since node 1 has two outgoing roads: 1\u21922 and 1\u21923).\n\nno[2] = 1 (road 2\u21923).\n\nno[3] = 0.\n\nThe dp array is initialized with dp[3] =0, others are large values.\n\nThe heap starts with (0,3).\n\nProcessing node 3 (c=0):\n\nFor each y in rootinv[3], which are 1 and 2.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nno[y] (which is 1) is decremented by 1 \u2192 0.\n\ncost =0+1=1.\n\ndp[2] is currently 1e18. So dp[2] becomes 0+1=1. Push (1,2) into heap.\n\nFor y=1:\n\nno[y] (2) is decremented by 1 \u21921.\n\ncost=1+1=2. dp[1] is 1e18. So dp[1] becomes 0+2=2. Push (2,1) into heap.\n\nNow, the heap has (1,2) and (2,1).\n\nNext, we process (1,2). c=1, x=2.\n\nFor each y in rootinv[2], which is 1 (road 1\u21922).\n\nno[y] (currently 1) is decremented by 1 \u21920.\n\ncost=0+1=1.\n\ndp[y=1] is 2. Check if 2>1+1 \u2192 2>2 \u2192 no. So no update.\n\nThen, no more entries. \n\nHeap now has (2,1). Process (2,1). c=2, x=1. \n\nFor y in rootinv[1], which is none. So nothing happens. \n\nSo the final dp[1] is 2. But sample output is 1. \n\nBut according to the code's calculation, the answer is 2. But the sample output is 1. This indicates that the code is incorrect. \n\nHmm. This suggests that there's a mistake in the approach. \n\nWhat's the correct way to model this problem?\n\nThe correct approach is to model the problem as a shortest path where the cost of moving from node u to node v is equal to the number of other outgoing edges from u. Because for each such edge, AmShZ must block them, one per day, then on the (k+1)th day, send a move message. So the cost is k +1, where k is the number of edges to block. \n\nBut k is the number of edges from u that are not on the path. So for a node u with out-degree d, if the path uses one edge, the cost is (d-1) +1 =d. \n\nBut in the code, the cost for the edge u\u2192v is computed as (current no[u] after decrement) +1. \n\nBut in the first sample, when processing the edge 1\u21923, the code computes the cost as (2-1) +1= 2. So the code's model gives a cost of 2, but according to the problem's sample, the correct answer is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is wrong. \n\nSo what's the correct way to model this? \n\nAh, perhaps the problem requires that AmShZ can block roads in any order, and the optimal way is to block the minimal number of roads. So when choosing the path, the cost for a node u is the number of edges not in the path (i.e., out-degree minus 1) plus 1 (the move). \n\nIn the first sample, the path 1\u21923 has out-degree 2 for node 1. So cost is (2-1) +1 = 2. But the sample's answer is 1. \n\nSo this is conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the reversed edges and the cost calculation is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the sample explanation is incorrect. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample output is 1. \n\nSo why is the code's approach giving 2 for the first sample? \n\nAh, perhaps the code is not correct. \n\nSo what's the mistake here? \n\nLet me re-express the problem. We need to find the minimal d such that there exists a strategy where after d days, Keshi is at n. \n\nThe strategy involves AmShZ blocking certain roads each day and/or telling Keshi to move. \n\nThe minimal d is the maximal sum over the path of the (number of blocked roads per node) +1 (for each move). \n\nBut the path is chosen such that the sum is minimal. \n\nBut the correct approach is to model this as a shortest path problem where each edge's weight is the number of blocked roads needed plus 1. \n\nIn the first sample, the path 1\u21923 requires blocking one road (1\u21922), so one day for blocking and one day for moving. Total 2 days. But the sample says the answer is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the sample's explanation is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows that when Keshi is told to move, even if there are multiple roads, but one of them leads to the destination, then AmShZ can choose to block all other roads in the same day. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong, and the correct answer is 2. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample output is 1, so there must be a different way to model it. \n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the move day and block day are considered in the same day. \n\nWait, according to the problem statement:\n\nEach day, AmShZ can send one message:\n\n- Block a road, and Keshi doesn't move that day.\n\n- Or, tell Keshi to move. \n\nSo each day is either a block or a move. \n\nSo for node 1 in the first sample:\n\nOption 1: \n\nDay 1: AmShZ tells Keshi to move. Keshi has two options: 2 or 3. If he chooses 3, done. If he chooses 2, then the next day, AmShZ can block the edge 2\u21923 (day 2: block), but then Keshi can't move. So this is not sufficient. \n\nBut the problem requires that the strategy must guarantee that Keshi reaches n within d days regardless of his choices. So this approach (sending a move on day 1) is not sufficient. \n\nOption 2: \n\nAmShZ blocks road 1\u21922 on day 1. Now, the only option for Keshi is 3. Then on day 2, AmShZ tells Keshi to move. So two days. \n\nBut the sample output is 1. \n\nSo this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nWhat's the correct way to model this? \n\nAh! I think the code's model is incorrect. \n\nThe correct model is that for each edge u\u2192v in the path, the cost is (number of edges from u that are processed after this edge in the path) + 1. \n\nBecause when you process the edges in reverse order, the number of edges from u that are processed after this edge (and thus need to be blocked) is the count. \n\nSo the code's approach is to process the edges in reverse order and calculate the cost as (remaining edges from u) +1. \n\nBut how does that work? \n\nFor example, in the first sample, the path is 1\u21923. The number of edges from 1 that are after this edge in the processing order is zero (if this edge is processed last). \n\nSo the cost is 0+1=1. \n\nSo the code's calculation would then give dp[1] =0 +1=1, which matches the sample output. \n\nBut how to adjust the code to achieve this? \n\nThe current code processes edges in the order determined by the reversed graph. The key is to process the edges in the order that minimizes the cost. \n\nSo, in the code's approach, when processing edges from a node y in the reversed graph, the order in which they are processed determines how many edges are considered \"left\" to block. \n\nThus, to minimize the cost, we need to process the edges from y in the reversed order of their out-degree. Or, more precisely, process the edges in such a way that when an edge is processed later, it has a lower cost. \n\nIn the code's current setup, the cost for an edge is no[y] +1, where no[y] is the number of outgoing edges from y that have not been processed yet. \n\nSo, if we process the edges in reverse order (i.e., the edges from y that would have higher no[y] are processed first), then the cost for each edge decreases. \n\nBut how to ensure that in the code? \n\nThe code uses a priority queue (min-heap) based on the current cost. This ensures that nodes with lower accumulated cost are processed first. \n\nIn the first sample, when processing node 3, the edges to y=1 and y=2 are added. The code would process them in the order of their current cost. \n\nBut the problem is that the code's current approach for the first sample calculates a cost of 2 for node 1, but the correct answer is 1. \n\nSo perhaps the code is missing a part where the processing order of the edges is optimized to find the minimal cost. \n\nAh! The code's current approach for processing the edges in rootinv[x] may not be optimal. Because the order in which the edges are processed from y affects the no[y] value. \n\nTo minimize the cost, for each node y, we should process the edges in the reverse order of their contribution to the cost. That is, process the edges that would have the least cost first. \n\nThis would mean that for each node y, when processing its edges, we process the edges in the order of increasing cost. \n\nBut how can this be done? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should process edges from y in the order of the minimal cost first. \n\nBut how? \n\nThe code uses a priority queue (heap) which processes nodes in order of their current dp value. \n\nThus, when a node's edges are processed in the reversed graph, the code subtracts 1 from y's no and calculates the cost. \n\nBut perhaps the code should process the edges in a way that allows the earliest possible edge to have the lowest possible cost. \n\nFor example, in the first sample, if the code processes the edge from 1 to 3 first, then no[1] is decremented to 1. Then, when processing the edge from 1 to 2, no[1] is decremented to 0. \n\nBut when processing the edge 1\u21923 first, the cost is 1 (no[y] after decrement is 1) +1 =2. \n\nBut that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, if the code processes the edge from 1 to 2 first, then no[1] is 2-1=1. Then, when processing the edge 1\u21923, no[1] is 1-1=0. cost is 0+1=1. \n\nThis would give a cost of 1 for the edge 1\u21923. \n\nBut how can the code ensure that the edges are processed in the optimal order? \n\nAh! This suggests that the code's approach is correct, but the order in which edges are processed depends on the priority queue's selection of nodes. \n\nIn the first sample, when node 3 is processed, the code adds both y=1 and y=2 to the heap. \n\nBut for y=1, the cost is 2 (dp[x]=0 + cost=2), and for y=2, the cost is 1. \n\nSo the heap will process y=2 first. Then, when processing y=2's edges (which is 1\u21922 in the original graph), we decrement no[1] from 2 to 1. \n\nThen, when processing node 1's edges (after being pushed with cost 2), the no[1] is now 1. \n\nBut how does this affect the cost for the edge 1\u21923? \n\nAh, no. Because the edge 1\u21923 is processed when node 3 is processed. The code for node 3's processing already added y=1 and y=2 to the heap. So the no[y] for y=1 is decremented once when processing node 3. \n\nBut when processing node 2, we process the edge y=1 (original edge 1\u21922), which decrements no[1] to 1. \n\nBut the edge 1\u21923 was processed earlier, leading to a cost of 2. \n\nSo the code's current approach does not allow for the optimal processing order. \n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nSo what is the correct way to model this problem? \n\nThe correct approach is to model the minimal days required to reach node n from node 1, where each edge u\u2192v contributes a cost of (k) +1, where k is the number of edges from u that are not part of the optimal path. \n\nBut how to compute this in the reversed graph? \n\nThe correct model is to use a priority queue where the cost for reaching a node u is the minimal number of days needed. For each node u, the cost is the minimal over all edges u\u2192v of (cost[v] + (number of edges from u that are not this edge) +1). \n\nBut the number of edges from u that are not this edge is (out_degree[u] -1). So for each edge u\u2192v, the cost is cost[v] + (out_degree[u] -1) +1 = cost[v] + out_degree[u]. \n\nBut this suggests that the cost for each node u is the minimal cost[v] + out_degree[u]. \n\nBut this is not correct for all cases. \n\nWait, for example, if node u has multiple edges, and some of them are processed earlier than others. \n\nBut this approach would imply that the minimal cost for u is cost[v] + out_degree[u], where v is the best choice among u's edges. \n\nBut in the first sample, node 1 has out_degree 2. So the cost for node 1 would be cost[3] + 2 =0+2=2. Or cost[2] + 2=1+2=3. So minimal is 2. \n\nWhich gives the code's result of 2, but the sample's output is 1. \n\nThis indicates a conflict. \n\nThus, there must be a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements. \n\nPerhaps the problem allows that when Keshi is told to move, and there are multiple options, but one of them leads to the destination, then the minimal days is the minimal possible path regardless of Keshi's choices. \n\nBut the problem statement says that they must make sure that they will meet after at most d days, regardless of Keshi's choices. \n\nSo the problem requires a strategy that ensures that no matter what choices Keshi makes (when moving), he will reach n within d days. \n\nThis requires that the path is such that every possible path Keshi can take is forced to reach n within d days. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAh! This is similar to the concept of the worst-case shortest path. \n\nThe problem requires that the path is a sequence of edges where, at each step, all outgoing edges from the current node either lead to the destination or are blocked. \n\nThus, the minimal d is determined by the path with the minimal worst-case cost. \n\nThis can be modeled using a Dijkstra-like approach where the cost for a node u is the minimal maximum cost of all possible paths from u to n. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that for each node u, the cost is the minimal over all edges u\u2192v of (number of edges from u that need to be blocked before this edge can be used) + 1 (move day) + cost[v]. \n\nThe number of edges to block is (number of edges from u that are not this edge and are not part of the path). \n\nBut this is difficult to model. \n\nThe correct approach, as explained in some online resources, is to model this as a modified Dijkstra algorithm where the cost to reach node u is the minimal number of days required, and for each edge u\u2192v, the cost is computed as (the number of edges from u that have not been processed yet) + 1 + cost[v]. \n\nThis requires processing the edges in reverse order of their contribution to the cost. \n\nThus, the code's current approach is correct, but the sample input's output is wrong. \n\nBut according to the sample input's output, this is not the case. \n\nThus, there must be a different approach. \n\nAfter some research, I find that this problem requires the same approach as the code is using, and the sample input's answer is indeed 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's cost calculation is incorrect. \n\nIn the code's current approach, the cost is no[y] +1. no[y] is the number of edges from y that have not been processed yet. \n\nBut when processing edges in the reversed graph, the code's no[y] represents the number of edges from y that are processed after the current edge. \n\nThus, for each edge y\u2192x in the original graph, the cost is the number of edges from y that are processed after this edge (which would need to be blocked) plus 1 (the move day). \n\nThus, the total cost is (number of edges to block) + 1 + cost[x]. \n\nBut the code uses cost = no[y] +1. \n\nAh, but when processing the edge y\u2192x, no[y] is the number of edges from y that have not been processed yet (i.e., the number of edges from y that will be processed after this one). So those edges must be blocked, each requiring one day. \n\nThus, the cost is no[y] (number of edges to block) + 1 (move day). \n\nSo for the first sample, when processing edge 1\u21923 (original), the no[y=1] is 1 (since after processing this edge, no[y] is 2-1=1). So cost is 1+1=2. \n\nBut the sample output is 1. So this suggests that the code is incorrect. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is 1. \n\nThus, there's a contradiction. \n\nAfter further consideration, I realize that perhaps the code's approach is correct, and the sample input's output is indeed 2, but the problem's sample explanation is wrong. \n\nBut according to the problem's sample input and output, the first sample's output is 1. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the code's approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the sample's explanation is wrong. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's cost calculation is incorrect. \n\nLet me think about another example. \n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n1 2\n\n1 3\n\n3 4\n\nSample Output: 2\n\nSample explanation: AmShZ blocks the first road (1\u21922) on day 1. On day 2, tells Keshi to move. So from 1, the only option is 3. Then on day 3, he moves to 4. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 2. \n\nWait, no. The sample explanation says that after blocking the first road on day 1, on day 2, he tells Keshi to move, which leads to 4. So two days. \n\nBut according to the code's approach:\n\nProcessing node 4 (dp[4] =0). \n\nrootinv[4] contains 3. \n\nProcessing node 4, y=3: no[y] is 1 (out-degree of 3 is 1 (3\u21924)). subtract 1 \u21920. cost is 0+1=1. dp[3] =0+1=1. \n\nProcessing node 3, y=1: original out-degree is 2 (edges 1\u21922 and 1\u21923). subtract 1 \u21921. cost is 1+1=2. dp[1] =1+2=3. \n\nProcessing node 3's other predecessors? No. \n\nBut the sample output is 2. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's approach is not correct, and there's a mistake in the way the cost is calculated. \n\nThe correct way to model this problem is to use the following cost calculation: For each edge u\u2192v, the cost to reach v from u is (number of edges from u that are not this edge) + 1. \n\nSo, the cost is (out_degree[u] -1) +1 = out_degree[u]. \n\nThus, the code's current approach is incorrect because it uses no[y] +1, which is (original out_degree - number of processed edges) +1, but this depends on the processing order. \n\nThe correct cost should be (out_degree[u] -1) +1 = out_degree[u], regardless of the processing order. \n\nSo, the code's mistake is in the way the cost is computed. \n\nThus, the correct code should compute cost as (no[y] +1) when the code is processing the edge. \n\nWait, but no[y] is the original out_degree minus the number of processed edges from y. \n\nFor example, if we process the edges in reverse order, the first edge from y would have no[y] = original_out_degree -1 (since it's the first one processed). \n\nBut the correct cost is (original_out_degree -1) +1 = original_out_degree. \n\nBut in the code's approach, when processing edges in reverse order, the first edge's cost would be (original_out_degree -1) +1 = original_out_degree. \n\nThe second edge's cost would be (original_out_degree -2) +1 = original_out_degree -1. \n\nSo the code's approach gives varying costs for different edges from the same node. \n\nBut the correct cost for each edge from y should be (original_out_degree -1) +1 = original_out_degree. \n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nThe correct cost should be (original_out_degree[y] -1) +1 = original_out_degree[y]. \n\nSo, regardless of the order in which edges are processed from y, the cost for each edge from y is original_out_degree[y]. \n\nThus, the code's cost calculation is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code should set cost = no[y] +1 + (original_out_degree[y] - (no[y] +1)), but that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, the code should use the original_out_degree of y, not the current no[y] value. \n\nThus, the code's mistake is in using no[y] (which is modified during processing) instead of the original_out_degree of y. \n\nSo, the correct code should have cost = (original_out_degree[y] -1) +1 = original_out_degree[y]. \n\nBut how to track the original_out_degree[y]?\n\nIn the code, no[y] is initialized as the original_out_degree of y. So, the correct cost would be no[y] (original) +0. \n\nBut no[y] is modified during processing. \n\nThus, the code should store the original out_degree of y in another array. \n\nSo, the code should have an array, say, out_degree, which is initialized as no[y] before any processing. \n\nThen, cost = out_degree[y] \n\nThus, in the code, the line would be:\n\ncost = out_degree[y]\n\nBut where is out_degree stored? \n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nIn the code, the no array is initialized as [0]*(n+2), and for each road, no[u] is incremented. So no[u] holds the original out-degree of u. \n\nBut during processing, no[y] is decremented each time an edge from y is processed. \n\nSo, the original out-degree is stored in the no array before any processing. \n\nThus, the code should have a separate array for the original out_degree. \n\nBut in the current code, no array is modified. \n\nThus, the code has a mistake. \n\nTo correct this, the code should store the original out_degree in a separate array, say, out_degree, and use that for cost calculation. \n\nThus, the code's missing line would be:\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + (out_degree[y] - (no[y] +1)) +1:\n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the correct cost for edge y\u2192x is (original_out_degree[y] -1) +1 = original_out_degree[y]. \n\nThus, regardless of the order in which edges are processed, the cost for using edge y\u2192x is original_out_degree[y]. \n\nThus, the code's cost should be the original out_degree of y. \n\nBut how to track that? \n\nIn the code, the original out_degree of y is stored in no[y] before processing. \n\nBut during processing, no[y] is modified. \n\nThus, the code should store the original out_degree in a separate array. \n\nBut the code currently does not do that. \n\nThus, the code's mistake is that it uses a modified no[y] in the cost calculation. \n\nThe correct approach is to use the original out_degree of y. \n\nThus, the code should have a separate array for the original out_degree. \n\nBut in the given code, the code initializes no[u] +=1 for each edge, which makes no[u] the original out_degree. \n\nBut during processing, no[y] is modified. \n\nThus, to correct the code, we need to store the original out_degree in a separate array. \n\nFor example:\n\noriginal_out = [0]*(n+2)\nfor i in range(m):\n    u,v = map(int, input().split())\n    root[u].append(v)\n    rootinv[v].append(u)\n    original_out[u] +=1\n\nThen, in the cost calculation, use original_out[y] instead of no[y]. \n\nBut the code currently uses no[y], which is modified. \n\nThus, the cost calculation should be:\n\ncost = original_out[y]\n\nBut then, in the code's current logic, the no[y] is being used for something else. \n\nBut according to the correct model, the cost is the original out_degree of y. \n\nThus, the code's current cost calculation is incorrect. \n\nThus, the correct code should have:\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + original_out[y]:\n    dp[y] = dp[x] + original_out[y]\n    heappush( ... )\n\nBut how to implement this in the given code? \n\nThe given code has no array original_out. Thus, the code is missing this part. \n\nBut the user-provided code initializes no[u] as the original out_degree. \n\nBut during processing, no[y] is decremented. \n\nThus, the code's cost calculation should use the original out_degree, which is no[y] before any processing. \n\nBut in the given code, no[y] is modified. \n\nThus, the code's mistake is that the cost is calculated using the modified no[y]. \n\nThus, the correct code should use the original out_degree of y. \n\nThus, the code's cost should be no[y] +1 (since no[y] is the original out_degree of y before any processing, but in the code, no[y] is modified before the cost calculation). \n\nWait, in the code's current setup, the code does:\n\nfor y in rootinv[x]:\n    no[y] -=1\n    cost = no[y] +1\n    if ... \n\nBut no[y] is the original out_degree of y, then decremented each time an edge from y is processed. \n\nThus, when processing the first edge from y, no[y] is original_out_degree -1. \n\nThus, cost is (original_out_degree -1) +1 = original_out_degree. \n\nWhen processing the second edge from y, no[y] is (original_out_degree -1) -1 = original_out_degree -2. \n\nCost is (original_out_degree -2) +1 = original_out_degree -1. \n\nThus, the code's cost calculation varies for edges from y based on the order of processing. \n\nThis is correct. \n\nBecause when processing edges from y in reverse order, the first edge processed has higher cost (original_out_degree), the next has original_out_degree-1, etc. \n\nThus, the code's approach is to process edges in such a way that the earliest processed edges have higher costs, and the later ones have lower costs. \n\nThus, the code's algorithm uses a priority queue to process nodes in order of their current cost, which allows us to find the minimal possible total cost. \n\nBut why in the first sample this approach gives a cost of 2 for node 1, but the correct answer is 1? \n\nAh! Because the code's approach is correct, but the first sample's explanation is wrong. \n\nBut according to the problem statement's sample input, the answer is 1. \n\nThis suggests that there's a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample explanation is incorrect. \n\nBut the code's approach seems to model the problem correctly. \n\nThus, the missing line is the condition:\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + cost:\n\nSo, the code's correct missing line is:\n\nif dp[y] > c + cost:\n\nor\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + cost:\n\nBecause c is the current cost of x. \n\nThus, the correct code is:\n\nif dp[y] > dp[x] + cost:\n\nThus, the answer to fill in the code is:\n\nif dp[y] > c + cost:\n\nBut in the code, c is the current cost of x (dp[x]). \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the code has:\n\nc, x = heappop(hp)\n\nThen, for each y in rootinv[x]:\n\n    no[y] -=1\n\n    cost = no[y] +1\n\n    if ...:\n\n        dp[y] = dp[x] + cost\n\n        heappush(...)\n\nThus, the missing condition is:\n\nif dp[y] > c + cost:\n\nSo, the line to fill in is:\n\nif dp[y] > c + cost:\n\nThus, the correct missing code is:\n\nif dp[y] > c + cost:"
