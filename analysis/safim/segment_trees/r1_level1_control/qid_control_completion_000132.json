The problem is about determining if there's a way to move robots such that at least one reaches the upper left corner (0,0) without any robot exploding. \n\nThe code provided seems to be looking for two positions: x1,y1 and x2,y2. Then it checks if they are the same. If so, output YES. Otherwise, NO. But how do these positions relate to the problem?\n\nLooking at the first loop: it's iterating over each row (n rows) and each column (probably 'r' is m, since the input after n is m, but in the code it's read as 'r' maybe a typo). The code is searching for the first occurrence of 'R' in row-major order (left to right, top to bottom). So x1 and y1 are the coordinates of the first robot found in that order.\n\nThen the second loop iterates over columns (from 0 to r-1, which is m-1), and for each column, checks each row. It's looking for the first 'R' in column-major order (top to bottom, left to right). So x2 and y2 are the coordinates of the first robot in this order.\n\nWait, why are they doing that? Because the idea might be that the upper-leftmost robot in row-major order and column-major order must be the same.

Because, to move all robots left and up enough so that one can reach (0,0), the robot that is the leftmost and topmost is the one that can reach (0,0) without others blocking. Because any robot to the left or above would require movements that could push others out of the grid.\n\nFor example, suppose there's a robot at (2,1) and another at (1,2). If you try to move the (2,1) robot left, the other robot might have to move left as well, but if it's on the edge, it could explode.
