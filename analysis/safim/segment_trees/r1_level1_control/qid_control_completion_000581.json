So when processing the a's and c's:\n\n- For each a in the order they appear (after removing b's), the a in t must be >= the position in s.\n\n- For each c in the order they appear (after removing b's), the c in t must be <= the position in s.\n\nBut how to model this.",

So for example, when processing a 'a' in t, the code checks that there are no c's that are in the original s that are after this a's position (since that would require the a to move past a c to reach its position in t, which is not allowed). In the case of 'b' in t, the code's TODO is checking some condition. The existing code for 'b' in t is:\n\nif (curr == 'b') {\n    if (!a.isEmpty()) {\n        if (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n            sb.append(\"NO\\n\");\n            continue k;\n        }\n    }\n    b.pop();\n} So the code checks if the a stack is not empty.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining if we can transform string s into t using certain moves. The allowed moves are swapping 'ab' to 'ba' or 'bc' to 'cb'. So these operations allow us to swap adjacent a and b, and adjacent b and c. But importantly, a can't move past c directly. For example, if there's a 'ac', you can't swap them. Similarly, 'ba' can't be swapped unless you have an 'ab' to begin with. Wait, the allowed swaps are replacing 'ab' with 'ba' (so swap a and b when they are in that order), and 'bc' with 'cb' (swap b and c when in that order). Wait no, the operation is replacing an occurrence of \"ab\" with \"ba\"\u2014so the swap makes them reverse. So each move allows you to swap an 'a' with a 'b' that's immediately after it, or a 'b' with a 'c' that's immediately after it. So the allowed swaps are moving 'a's to the right past 'b's, and 'b's to the right past 'c's. Wait no, wait: each operation replaces \"ab\" with \"ba\"\u2014so the 'a' and 'b' are swapped, moving the 'a' to the right. Similarly, replacing \"bc\" with \"cb\" swaps them, moving the 'b' to the right. So the allowed operations are moving a to the right past b (since each swap moves the a one position to the right), and moving b to the right past c. So the order of a and b can be changed as a can move right past b, and b can move right past c. But a cannot move past c directly. So the relative order of a's and c's is fixed. Also, the relative order of b's and a's can be adjusted as long as a's can move past b's. Wait, but for example, if there's a 'ba' in s, you can't swap them. Because the allowed operations are only swapping 'ab' to 'ba' and 'bc' to 'cb'. So when you have 'ab', you can swap to 'ba', which effectively moves the a to the right. But if you have 'ba', you can't swap them. So the allowed operations let you move a's to the right past b's (since each swap steps them over), and b's to the right past c's. So for the original string s, the a's can be reordered to the right past any b's, but cannot cross c's. Similarly, b's can be moved to the right past c's but can't cross a's if they are to the left. Wait, no. Let's think: a can move right past b's via the swaps, but once a's are after a b, you can't move them back. Because the swap is ab \u2192 ba. So to move a to the right, you can swap with a b. But once a is to the right of a b, there's no way to move it back left. Similarly, a can't move past c's. So the order of a's and c's in the original string must be the same as in t. Because you can't swap a's with c's. Also, for the b's and c's: since you can swap bc to cb, which moves the b to the right. So in the original string, the positions of the b's can be adjusted relative to c's, but only in a way that allows moving b's to the right. Similarly, the order of a's and b's can be adjusted by moving a's to the right past b's. So the main thing is:\n\nThe order of a's and c's in s and t must be the same. Because you can't swap a and c. Also, for the a's and b's: in the transformed string, the a's can't appear to the left of where they are in s, except by moving right. Wait, no. Because each swap allows a to move right past a b. So if in s, the a is at position i, and there's a b at i+1, then the swap can move a to i+1. But if you have multiple b's after a's, you can move a's further to the right. So the a's can end up to the right of some b's, but not left. Wait, no. Because when you swap ab to ba, the a moves to the right. So if you have a sequence like \"ab\", you can swap once to get \"ba\". Then if there's another b to the left of that a, you can't move the a back. So the a's can only move to the right past b's. So, in the transformed string, each a in t must be in a position that is >= the position of the same a in s. Wait, but how?\n\nHmm. Let's think of the positions of the characters. For the a's in s, after any number of swaps, the a's can only have moved to the right through the b's. But not through the c's. So the a's in t must be in positions that are >= their original positions, but only after moving past b's. But how does this affect the problem?\n\nThe problem is to check if s can be transformed into t by these swaps. So the approach is to check:\n\n1. For each a in t, the corresponding a in s must be in a position that is <= the position in t, but this is only possible if between the original position and the target position, there are no c's. Because a can't move past c's.\n\nSimilarly for c's: since they can only move to the left via swaps (if a bc is swapped to cb, which moves the c to the left. Wait, no. If you have \"bc\" and swap to \"cb\", the c moves left by one. So c can move left past b's. Wait, but the allowed swap is bc \u2192 cb. So if there's a bc in the string, you can swap them, moving the c to the left. So c can move left past b's. So the c's can end up to the left of some b's. But a's can't move past c's, and vice versa.\n\nSo the steps for the solution:\n\nFirst, check that s and t have the same multiset of characters. If not, immediately output NO.\n\nThen, check the order of a's and c's in both strings. Since a's can't move past c's and vice versa, the order of a's and c's in s and t must be the same. For example, if in s there is an a followed by a c, in t, the a must come before that c. So for each a in s, all c's that are after it in s must also be after it in t, and vice versa. Wait, perhaps a better way is to check that when you process the characters in order, the non-b characters (a and c) must appear in the same order in both s and t. Because any a or c in s must appear in the same order relative to each other in t. Because you can't swap a's and c's. So for example, if in s there is an a followed by a c, then in t, the same a must come before the same c. Because you can't swap them. Similarly, if a c is followed by an a in s, then that's impossible to change. So, the a's and c's in s and t must form the same sequence when all the b's are removed. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo the first two checks are:\n\n- For each test case, if the counts of a, b, c in s and t are not equal, output NO.\n\n- Check that the sequence of non-b characters in s and t are identical. If not, output NO.\n\nIf those conditions are met, then proceed.\n\nOnce those are satisfied, the next thing is to check for the positions of a's and c's in their respective groups.\n\nBut then, even if those two conditions are met, there's the problem of the a's and c's being able to move through the b's.\n\nFor a's, the allowed swaps are moving a's to the right past b's. So each a in t must be at a position >= the position of the corresponding a in s. But only if there are no c's blocking their path. But since the sequence of a's and c's in the non-b characters is the same, this is already handled.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is:\n\nFor each a in s and the corresponding a in t, the position in t must be >= the position in s. Because a can only move right.\n\nSimilarly, for each c in s and the corresponding c in t, the position in t must be <= the position in s. Because c can move left through b's.\n\nSo when processing the a's and c's:\n\n- For each a in the order they appear (after removing b's), the a in t must be >= the position in s.\n\n- For each c in the order they appear (after removing b's), the c in t must be <= the position in s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, when processing each a in t, we can check that in the original s, the a's are in such positions that they can be moved to the required positions in t.\n\nBut how to track this.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the positions of the a's, b's, and c's in s and t.\n\nFor a's:\n\nIn s, the a's are stored in a stack. When processing t from the end backwards (as in the code provided), for each 'a' in t, we pop the a's from s's a stack (which is built in order, perhaps reversed? Let's look at the code.)\n\nLooking at the existing code:\n\nThe code initializes three stacks (a, b, c) for the indices of each character in s. For example, a.add(i) for each 'a' in s. So when building the stack, the order is from left to right. So the first a in s is at index 0, then the next a is added, etc. So the stack a will have the indices in the order they appear in s, with the first a being at the bottom of the stack and the last a at the top.\n\nThen, when processing the t string from the end to the beginning (i from n-1 downto 0), for each character in t, they check:\n\nIf the character is 'a', then they check if there are any c's in the stack. If the a's top index is less than the c's top index, then it's invalid. Because that would imply that in s, there's a c after the a, but in t, the a is supposed to come after that c. But since a can't move past c, that's impossible. So the code is checking that when the current t character is 'a', the corresponding a in s must not have any c's that are after it (since in the code, they check if the a's top is after the c's top, but wait, maybe the code is checking if a's current index (from the stack) is after any c's that are in the stack. Hmm, perhaps I need to understand the code structure better.\n\nThe code is processing t in reverse order, from the end. For each character in t (starting from the last), it pops from the corresponding stack. For example, if the current character in t is 'a', then they pop from the a stack. But before popping, they check if there are any c's in the stack (i.e., in the original s, are there any c's that haven't been processed yet). Because if the a in s (which is the next a to be popped, since we are processing t's a's in reverse) is at a position earlier than some c in s (which hasn't been processed yet), then that c is to the right of the a in s, which would mean that in t, the a is supposed to be after that c. But since a can't move past c, this is impossible. So in this case, the code returns NO.\n\nSimilarly, when processing a 'c' in t, the code checks if there are any b's or a's in the stacks that are after the current c. For example, if the current c in t is matched with a c in s, but in s, there's a b or a that's after this c's position, then it's invalid. Because the c in t can only be placed there if all those a's and b's have been moved to the right (for a's) or left (for b's?), but perhaps the code is checking for this.\n\nNow, looking at the code for 'b' in t. The code has a TODO here. The existing code for 'a' and 'c' checks the following:\n\nFor 'a' in t:\n\n- Check if there are any c's in the stack. If so, compare the top of a and the top of c. If a's top is less than c's top, then return NO. Because that a in s is before a c, but in t, the a is supposed to be after that c. Which is impossible.\n\nFor 'c' in t:\n\n- Check if there are any b's in the stack. If the c's top is less than b's top, return NO.\n\n- Also check if there are any a's in the stack. If c's top is less than a's top, return NO.\n\nSo for 'c' in t, during processing, the code ensures that the current c in s is not earlier than any b's or a's in s. Because the c can move left through b's (so for example, a c can move left past b's, but during processing, the code is checking that the current c in s (which is the one being popped) is not before any remaining b's. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nWhen processing the c in t, the code checks if there are any b's in the stack. The stack for b contains the positions of the original b's in s, in the order they appear. So when the code checks if c's top (the current c's position in s) is less than b's top (the position of a remaining b in s), then that means that in s, there is a b that is after this c. But in t, the current c is being placed here, but the remaining b's (which are in s) must be processed after. But since c can move left past b's, this is allowed. Wait, but the code is returning NO in this case. Wait, that's the code for 'c' in t: if there are any remaining b's, and c's top is less than b's top, then it's invalid. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is structured to process t from the end to the beginning. For example, when we process the i-th position of t (from the end), we need to match it with the corresponding character in s. But the stacks are built in the order of the original s, so when processing t in reverse, the code is trying to match the characters from the end of s. For example, the first character in t (from the end) is matched with the last occurrence in s's stack.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe the code is using a greedy approach to match the characters. Let's think: when processing t in reverse, for each character in t (starting from the end), we pop the corresponding stack (a, b, c) in s. The idea is that the current character in t must correspond to a character in s that can be moved into position via the allowed swaps. For example, when processing an 'a' in t, the corresponding 'a' in s must be able to move to that position, considering the other characters.\n\nNow, the code for 'a' in t is checking that the a in s (the one being popped) is not before any c's that are still in the stack. Because if the a is before a c in s, but in t's current position (i), the a is supposed to be after that c. But since a can't move past c, this is impossible. So the code checks that when processing an 'a' in t, there are no remaining c's in the stack that are after this a in s.\n\nSimilarly, when processing a 'c' in t, the code checks that there are no remaining b's or a's in their stacks that are after the c's position. Because the c can only move left through b's. Wait, but if a c in s is at position x, and there's a b at position y > x, then during the swaps, the c could have moved left past that b. So the code's check here is that when processing a 'c' in t, the c's position in s (x) must be >= any remaining a's or b's in their stacks. Because if there is a remaining a or b that is after x in s, then in t's current position, which is i (the current index being processed in reverse), the c is supposed to be at i, but in s, there's a a or b after x (the c's position in s), which hasn't been processed yet. Which would imply that the c in s can't reach that position in t if there are a's or b's blocking the way.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the following logic: when processing a character in t from the end, the corresponding character in s must have been able to reach that position via the allowed moves. So for a's in t, the a's in s must be able to move right to that position. But during processing, since we are going from the end backwards, the a's in s's stack are being matched in reverse order. So the code pops the a's in the order of their positions in s (since the stack was built by adding indices in order, so the last element is the last a in s). So for example, when processing the last a in t, the code uses the last a in s.\n\nBut perhaps the code is trying to model the constraints as:\n\nFor each a in t (processed in reverse order), the corresponding a in s must not have any c's that are after it (in s) that haven't been processed yet. Because those c's would be to the right of the a in s, but in t, the a is supposed to be to the right of those c's. Since a can't move past c, this is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, for each c in t (processed in reverse), the corresponding c in s must not have any a's or b's that are after it (in s) that haven't been processed yet. Because those a's or b's would be to the right of the c in s, but in t, the c is supposed to be to the right of those a's or b's, which is impossible since the c can only move left through b's.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to enforce that when building the t string from the end, the characters must be able to be placed in their positions considering the allowed swaps. So for example, when processing a 'a' in t, the code checks that there are no c's that are in the original s that are after this a's position (since that would require the a to move past a c to reach its position in t, which is not allowed).\n\nIn the case of 'b' in t, the code's TODO is checking some condition. The existing code for 'b' in t is:\n\nif (curr == 'b') {\n    if (!a.isEmpty()) {\n        if (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n            sb.append(\"NO\\n\");\n            continue k;\n        }\n    }\n    b.pop();\n}\n\nSo the code checks if the a stack is not empty. Then, if some condition is true, it returns NO.\n\nWhat condition should be checked here?\n\nWhen processing a 'b' in t, the corresponding 'b' in s must be able to reach the desired position. But what could prevent that?\n\nThe allowed swaps for 'b's are moving them right past c's (since bc can be swapped to cb, which moves the b to the right). Wait, no. When you swap bc to cb, the b moves to the right (since bc becomes cb; the b is at index i, and c is at i+1. After swap, b is at i+1, c at i. So the b moves right by one. So the allowed swap for bc allows the b to move right. So, the b can move right past c's.\n\nWait, no. The swap is bc \u2192 cb. So the original positions are i (b) and i+1 (c). After swap, the positions are i (c) and i+1 (b). So the b moves from i to i+1. So the swap allows the b to move to the right past the c. So each such swap moves the b one position to the right. So the b's can move right past c's.\n\nBut how does this affect the processing? For a 'b' in t, the corresponding 'b' in s must not have any a's that are after it. Because a's can't move past b's. Wait, the a's can move to the right past b's. So if a 'b' in s is followed by an a in s, the a can move past the b to the right. But in the t string, if the 'b' is positioned after that a's position, then it's possible. Wait, but the a can move to the right, but the b's can also move to the right. So perhaps the code's logic for 'b's is to check if there are any a's that are after the current 'b' in s. Because in t, the 'b' is placed in a position that requires that all a's in s that are after this 'b' must have been processed (i.e., placed in their positions in t, which are after the current 'b's position in t). But if those a's are in s after the 'b', then in t, the 'b' must come before them, which would require the 'b' to move left. But since 'b's can't move left past a's (only a's can move right past b's), that's impossible.\n\nWait, the allowed swaps are ab \u2192 ba (a moves right past b), and bc \u2192 cb (b moves right past c). So the a can move right past b's, and the b can move right past c's. So a's can't move left. B's can move right past c's, but can't move left past a's. Because to move a b left past an a would require an ab swap, which is allowed for a's moving right. So for example, if you have ab \u2192 ba, which moves a to the right. But if you have ba, you can't swap that to ab. So the b can't move left past a's.\n\nSo, when processing a 'b' in t, the code must check that the corresponding 'b' in s does not have any a's that are after it (in s). Because if in s, there's an a after the current 'b', then in t, the 'b' is supposed to be placed after that a's position. But since the a can't move left, and the b can't move left past the a, this is impossible. So for the 'b' in t, the code must check that in s, there are no a's that are after the current 'b's position.\n\nIn the code, when processing a 'b' in t, the code pops from the 'b' stack. But before that, the code checks if there are any a's in the stack (i.e., a's in s that haven't been processed yet). If there are, then the code must check that the current 'b's position in s (the one being popped) is not before any of those a's. Because if the 'b' is before an a in s, then the a can move to the right (so in t, the a can end up after the 'b'). But if the 'b' in s is after an a, then in t's processing, if the current 'b' is being placed in a position that requires the a to be after it, that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach for 'b's is to check that there are no a's in the stack (s's a's that haven't been processed) that are after the current 'b's position in s. Because when processing t's 'b' at position i, the corresponding 'b' in s must be positioned such that any a's in s that are after the 'b's position must have already been processed (i.e., placed in t's positions after i). But if there are a's in the stack (i.e., not yet processed) that are in s after the 'b's position, then in t, the 'b' is being placed before those a's, which is allowed if those a's can move right past the 'b's. Wait, but the 'b' in t's current position would require that the 'b's in s can move left to that position. But the 'b's can't move left past a's.\n\nSo the code's TODO for 'b's is to check if the current 'b's position in s is after any a's that are still in the stack. Because if in s, there is an a that comes after this 'b', and that a hasn't been processed yet (i.e., is in the a stack), then in t, this 'b' is supposed to be placed before that a's position in t, which is impossible because the a can't move left.\n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to check that in s, the 'b' being processed must not have any a's that are to the right of it (i.e., in s, the 'b' is to the left of some a's that are still in the stack). Because in t, the 'b' is being placed in a position where those a's would need to be to the right of the 'b', but the a's can't move left. So how can this be possible?\n\nFor example, suppose s is \"ab\", t is \"ba\". Then the code would process the t from the end. The last character is 'a', so we check the a stack. The a's stack in s has index 0. Then, the code checks if there are any c's in the stack (no), then pops the a. Next, process the first character of t (which is 'b'), which is handled by the 'b' case. The code checks if there are any a's in the stack (the a's stack is empty now), so no condition is checked. Then the code pops the 'b' (from index 1 in s's b stack). So this would return YES, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: s is \"ba\", t is \"ab\". The code processes the 'b' in t (last character). The code checks if there are any a's in the stack. The a stack in s has index 1 (since the 'a' is at position 1). So the code checks if the current 'b's position (from s's b stack, which is 0) is less than the a's top (1). So the condition would be if (b's position < a's position). In this case, 0 < 1, so the code would append NO. Which is correct, because you can't swap \"ba\" to \"ab\".\n\nSo the condition for 'b's is that if there are any a's in the stack, the current 'b's position in s (the one being popped) must be after all those a's. Wait, no. Because in the example where s is \"ab\", t is \"ba\", the 'a' is at position 0, the 'b' is at position 1. When processing the 'b' in t (second character), the code checks the a stack, which has already been popped (since the first processed character in t is 'a'). So no condition is checked, and it works.\n\nSo in the code's current structure, for the 'b' case, the code checks if there are any a's in the stack. If there are, then the current 'b's position in s must be after the a's positions. Because if the 'b' in s is before any a's that are still in the stack, then in t, the 'b' is placed before those a's. But the a's can't move left past the 'b's. So the code must check that the 'b's position in s is after the a's positions in the stack.\n\nSo the condition for the 'b' case is: if there are any a's in the stack, and the current 'b's position (from s's b stack) is less than the a's top position. Then it's invalid.\n\nSo the code's TODO is to check if (b's current position < a's top position). Because the 'b' in s is at a position that is before an a in s, and in t, this 'b' is supposed to be placed after that a's position in t. But since a can't move left, this is impossible.\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO part for the 'b' case is: if (b.peek() < a.peek()), then return NO.\n\nSo the code should check if the current b's index (from the stack) is less than the top a's index (from the a stack).\n\nSo the line to fill is:\n\nif (b.peek() < a.peek()) {\n    ...\n}\n\nSo that's the condition that needs to be checked.\n\nSo the code for 'b' would look like:\n\nif (!a.isEmpty()) {\n    if (b.peek() < a.peek()) {\n        sb.append(\"NO\\n\");\n        continue k;\n    }\n}\n\nThis would handle the case where in s, the 'b' is positioned before an 'a', which hasn't been processed yet. Because when processing the 'b' in t, the corresponding 'b' in s is before an 'a' that is still in the stack. This means that the 'b' in t is supposed to be placed after that 'a' in t's string, which is impossible since the 'a' can't move left.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is b.peek() < a.peek()."
