For the entire array to have the same parity, after applying x and y, the parity of these two must be equal. The parity after operations for position 1 (odd) is (a1_parity + x) mod 2. For position 2 (even), it's (a2_parity + y) mod 2. These must be equal. So:\n\na1_parity + x \u2261 a2_parity + y (mod 2)\n=> (x - y) \u2261 (a2_parity - a1_parity) mod 2. But this is just one equation. How about the other elements? Let's take another element, say position 3 (odd). Its parity after x and y is (a3_parity + x) mod 2. It must be equal to the parity of position 1. So (a3_parity +x) \u2261 (a1_parity +x) mod 2. Which implies a3_parity \u2261 a1_parity mod 2.

Wait, but in that case, O_parity (all odd positions are even) and E_parity (all even positions are even). Then, choosing x=0 and y=0: all elements are even. So possible.

So for code's 0-based array, the 1-based even indices are the elements where the 0-based index is 1, 3, 5, etc. (since 1-based index 2 is 0-based index 1). So in code, the even indices (as per the problem's 1-based) are the 0-based indices with (i % 2) == 1. Similarly, the odd indices in 1-based terms are 0-based indices with (i % 2) == 0. So, for the code, the elements at 0-based index i where i is even (i%2==0) correspond to the 1-based odd indices (since i+1 is odd). So when the problem refers to odd indices, they are 0-based even. So the code must check two things:\n\n1. All elements at 0-based even indices (i%2==0) have the same parity. 2. All elements at 0-based odd indices (i%2==1) have the same parity. If both are true, then output YES. Otherwise, NO. So the code needs to check these two conditions. Looking at the code provided:\n\nThe code loops from i=0 to n-2 (inclusive?), but the loop is written as for(int i=0; i <n-2; i++). Wait, n-2? So if n is 5, the loop runs i=0,1,2 (since 5-2 is 3, and i <3). But n-2 is 3, so loop runs 0,1,2. That's 3 elements. But perhaps the code is checking adjacent elements, but I'm not sure.",

So perhaps the code is checking for each i, whether a[i] and a[i+2] have the same parity. Because for 0-based, elements at i and i+2 are same parity (even or odd indices). For example, in 0-based:\n\ni=0 (even) and i+2=2 (even) should have same parity. i=1 (odd) and i+3=3 (odd) should have same parity. So for each 0-based even index i, check that a[i] and a[i+2] have the same parity. Similarly for odd indices. So the code loops over i from 0 to n-3 (since i+2 can be up to n-1 when i is n-3). So the loop runs for i from 0 to n-3. Because if n is the size, then i can be up to (n-1) - 2 = n-3. For example, if n=5, then n-3=2. i can be 0,1,2. Then i+2 is 2,3,4 (which is allowed). So that's correct. So the code's loop is for i=0 to n-3, checking whether a[i] and a[i+2] have the same parity.",

We need these to be the same. So 0 +x \u2261 0 +y mod 2 \u2192 x \u2261 y mod 2. So possible if x and y are even (both 0) \u2192 parities 0 and 0 \u2192 same. Or x and y are both 1 \u2192 parities 1 and 1 \u2192 same. So, for x=0 and y=0: all even. For x=1 and y=1: all odd. So answer is YES. So why does the note say that the second test case has output NO? Because the array must be different. Ah, this indicates that the code's approach is correct, but the sample input is not as I thought. Perhaps the second test case in the note is different. For example, the array has elements with varying parities in even and odd indices. For example, consider the array [1, 2, 2]. Then:\n\nOdd indices (0-based even: 0 and 2) have parities 1 and 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out what's missing in this code. The problem is about determining if after any number of operations (adding 1 to even indices or odd indices), we can make all elements in the array have the same parity (all even or all odd). \n\nThe code given checks each element up to n-2, but I'm not sure why. Wait, maybe the loop is checking consecutive elements for some condition. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe operations affect the parity of elements. Each operation toggles certain elements. For example, when you perform an odd-indexed operation, all elements at positions 1, 3, 5, etc., get incremented by 1, which changes their parity. Similarly, even-indexed operations change the parity of elements at even positions.\n\nBut how do these operations affect the ability to make all elements have the same parity? Let's think about parity transitions.\n\nSuppose we have two elements. Let's say their parities need to match. The operations can adjust their parities. But maybe the key is that for the array to be possible, the parities of elements at even and odd positions must follow certain rules.\n\nWait, maybe the parity of elements at even and odd positions must all have the same parity modulo 2. Because each operation affects either all even or all odd indices. So, for example, adding to odd indices changes the parity of all elements at those positions. Similarly for even indices.\n\nWait, the operations can be applied any number of times, but each time you apply an operation, all elements in their respective indices (even or odd) toggle their parity. Because adding 1 changes even to odd and vice versa. So each operation of type 1 (odd indices) flips the parity of all odd-indexed elements. Similarly for type 2. So the parity of each element's position depends on how many times each operation is applied.\n\nBut the question is, can we make all elements even or all odd. Let's consider two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: All elements must be even. Then, for each element a_i, after some number of operations, a_i's parity must be even. But the operations affect the parity in a certain way. Let's model this.\n\nLet me think in terms of parity (even or odd). Let's denote for each element a_i, its initial parity (0 for even, 1 for odd). Then, the operations can flip the parity of certain elements.\n\nEach time we perform an odd operation (type 1), the parity of all elements at odd indices (1-based) is flipped. Similarly, each even operation (type 2) flips parity of even indices.\n\nSo, for each element, the total number of times it's flipped depends on its position and the number of operations of each type.\n\nWait, but for the final parity of each element, it's determined by the initial parity plus the number of times the operations affecting its position were applied. Since each operation of type 1 adds a flip to all odd positions, and type 2 adds a flip to even positions. So for an element at position i (1-based), the parity after x operations of type 1 and y operations of type 2 would be:\n\nparity_i_initial + x*(i is odd) + y*(i is even) mod 2.\n\nWe need all parity_i_final to be the same (either all 0 or all 1).\n\nSo, for all i, (parity_i_initial + x*(i is odd) + y*(i is even)) mod 2 = c, where c is 0 or 1.\n\nWe need to find x and y (non-negative integers, but since mod 2, x and y can be 0 or 1 each) such that this equation holds for all i.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y can be any number of operations (even or odd times), but each operation can be applied any number of times. However, since each application toggles the parity, applying it twice is equivalent to not applying it. So the effective choices are whether to apply each operation an even or odd number of times. So x and y can be considered modulo 2. So possible x is 0 or 1, same for y.\n\nSo there are four possible combinations of x and y (0,0; 0,1; 1,0; 1,1). For each combination, we check if all elements' parities can be made the same.\n\nIf any of these four possibilities works, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think about the possible combinations.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the parity constraints for the elements.\n\nFor all elements to have the same parity, the parity of each element must be the same modulo 2. Let's see:\n\nFor each pair of elements in certain positions, their parities must differ in a certain way that can be adjusted by the operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the parity of elements in even and odd positions must have certain relationships. Let's think about two elements: say, elements at positions 1 and 2. For the entire array to have the same parity, after applying x and y, the parity of these two must be equal.\n\nThe parity after operations for position 1 (odd) is (a1_parity + x) mod 2. For position 2 (even), it's (a2_parity + y) mod 2. These must be equal. So:\n\na1_parity + x \u2261 a2_parity + y (mod 2)\n=> (x - y) \u2261 (a2_parity - a1_parity) mod 2.\n\nBut this is just one equation. How about the other elements?\n\nLet's take another element, say position 3 (odd). Its parity after x and y is (a3_parity + x) mod 2. It must be equal to the parity of position 1. So (a3_parity +x) \u2261 (a1_parity +x) mod 2. Which implies a3_parity \u2261 a1_parity mod 2. So, all elements at odd positions must have the same parity modulo 2. Similarly, elements at even positions must have the same parity.\n\nWait, this is an important point. Let's see:\n\nIf two elements are at the same parity positions (both even or both odd), then their parities after applying x and y operations would be:\n\nFor odd positions i and j (both odd), their parity after x and y is a_i_parity +x mod 2 and a_j_parity +x mod 2. For these to be equal, a_i_parity must equal a_j_parity mod 2. So all elements at odd positions must have the same parity initially. Similarly, even positions must have same parity.\n\nIf that's not the case, then even with x and y, their parities would differ. For example, if two elements at odd positions have different parities, then adding x (0 or 1) would not make them both even or both odd. Because x is the same for all odd positions. So, after applying x, the parity of all odd positions is a_i_parity +x. So, if two a_i_parity differ, then their parities after adding x would also differ. So that's impossible. Hence, for the array to be possible, all elements at even positions must have the same parity, and all elements at odd positions must have the same parity.\n\nSo the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All elements at even indices have the same parity modulo 2.\n\n2. All elements at odd indices have the same parity modulo 2.\n\nBut wait, what if the even indices and odd indices can be adjusted via x and y?\n\nWait, the even and odd indices are adjusted by y and x respectively. For example, the even positions are affected by y (mod 2), and odd by x (mod 2). So for the entire array to have same parity, the combination of x and y must make all even and odd positions' parities the same.\n\nLet me rephrase the conditions.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- For all odd i, a_i_parity is the same. Let's call this O_parity.\n\n- For all even i, a_i_parity is the same. Let's call this E_parity.\n\nThen, after applying x (mod 2) and y (mod 2), we need:\n\nO_parity + x \u2261 E_parity + y (mod 2).\n\nBecause all odd positions will have O_parity +x, and even positions E_parity +y. These must all be equal.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. All odd indices have same parity.\n\n2. All even indices have same parity.\n\n3. The parities of O and E differ by (x - y) mod 2. But since x and y are variables that can be chosen (0 or 1), there must exist some x and y such that O_parity +x \u2261 E_parity +y mod 2.\n\nSo, substituting x and y, possible combinations:\n\nWe need to find x and y (each 0 or 1) such that O_parity +x \u2261 E_parity + y mod 2.\n\nRearranged: x - y \u2261 (E_parity - O_parity) mod 2.\n\nBut x and y can be 0 or 1. So let's check for possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, the equation can be rewritten as x + E_parity \u2261 y + O_parity mod 2.\n\nBut for the existence of x and y, it's possible if (E_parity - O_parity) is even or odd. Let's see.\n\nFor example, if O_parity is 0 and E_parity is 0: then x must equal y mod 2. So possible choices are x and y both 0, or both 1. Then, O_parity +x = 0+0=0, E_parity +y=0+0=0. So yes. So all elements can be even (if x and y are even) or odd (if x and y are 1).\n\nWait, but in that case, O_parity (all odd positions are even) and E_parity (all even positions are even). Then, choosing x=0 and y=0: all elements are even. So possible. Alternatively, x=1 and y=1: all elements are even (O_parity +1 is 1, even positions +1 is 1, which is odd. Wait, no. If O_parity is 0 (even), then adding x=1 (mod 2) gives 1 (odd). Similarly, E_parity 0 plus y=1 gives 1. So all elements would be odd. So yes, that works. So in this case, possible.\n\nSo, the third condition is that the difference between O_parity and E_parity can be adjusted by choosing x and y. For example, when O_parity and E_parity are the same, then x and y can be chosen such that x \u2261 y mod 2. So possible.\n\nAlternatively, if O_parity and E_parity are different, then we need x and y such that x - y \u2261 (E_parity - O_parity) mod 2. Since E_parity - O_parity is 1 mod 2 (because they are different), x - y must be 1 mod 2. So possible (x=1, y=0; x=0, y=1).\n\nSo regardless of O_parity and E_parity, as long as the first two conditions (all odds same, all evens same) are met, then there exists x and y that can make all elements have the same parity. So the third condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nWait, that's the key! Because the third condition is whether O_parity +x \u2261 E_parity +y mod 2. Which can be written as x - y \u2261 E_parity - O_parity mod 2. Since x and y can be 0 or 1, there's always a solution for x and y. Because (E_parity - O_parity) can be 0 or 1. For example:\n\nIf (E_parity - O_parity) is 0:\n\nThen x - y must be 0 mod 2. So possible choices are x=0, y=0; x=1, y=1. Either works.\n\nIf (E_parity - O_parity) is 1:\n\nThen x - y must be 1 mod 2. So possible choices are x=1, y=0; x=0, y=1.\n\nThus, as long as all elements in even positions have the same parity and all elements in odd positions have the same parity, then it's possible to choose x and y to make all elements the same parity.\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\n1. All elements at odd indices have the same parity.\n\n2. All elements at even indices have the same parity.\n\nSo the code needs to check these two conditions. If both are true, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nIn the code given, the loop is for i from 0 to n-2. The array is 0-based, so the original indices in the code are 0-based. Wait, the problem statement uses 1-based indices for the operations. So in the code, the even and odd indices are 0-based. Wait, no: in the problem statement, the operations are applied to 1-based indices (i.e., a_1 is the first element, a_2 is the second, etc.). But in the code, the array is 0-based. So when the code refers to a[i], in the problem's terms, that's a_{i+1}.\n\nSo for the code, the 0-based index corresponds to 1-based index i+1. So the even positions in the problem's terms (like a_2, a_4) are 1-based even. So in 0-based terms, those are indices 1,3,5,... (since 1-based 2 is 0-based 1, etc.). So in code, for a 0-based array, even positions (1-based) are the indices 1, 3, 5..., which are odd in 0-based terms.\n\nSo, to check the parity of the elements in 1-based even positions (problem's even), we need to check 0-based indices 1,3,5 etc. (i.e., those with (i % 2) == 1 in 0-based).\n\nBut in the code, the array is stored as 0-based. So, the code needs to check if all elements at even positions (1-based) have the same parity, and all elements at odd positions (1-based) have the same parity.\n\nWait, the problem's operations are: adding 1 to elements with odd indices (1-based) and even indices (1-based). So in code, the 1-based even indices are the even indices. So for code's 0-based array, the 1-based even indices are the elements where the 0-based index is 1, 3, 5, etc. (since 1-based index 2 is 0-based index 1). So in code, the even indices (as per the problem's 1-based) are the 0-based indices with (i % 2) == 1. Similarly, the odd indices in 1-based terms are 0-based indices with (i % 2) == 0.\n\nSo, for the code, the elements at 0-based index i where i is even (i%2==0) correspond to the 1-based odd indices (since i+1 is odd). So when the problem refers to odd indices, they are 0-based even.\n\nSo the code must check two things:\n\n1. All elements at 0-based even indices (i%2==0) have the same parity.\n\n2. All elements at 0-based odd indices (i%2==1) have the same parity.\n\nIf both are true, then output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nSo the code needs to check these two conditions.\n\nLooking at the code provided:\n\nThe code loops from i=0 to n-2 (inclusive?), but the loop is written as for(int i=0; i <n-2; i++). Wait, n-2? So if n is 5, the loop runs i=0,1,2 (since 5-2 is 3, and i <3). But n-2 is 3, so loop runs 0,1,2. That's 3 elements. But perhaps the code is checking adjacent elements, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, the code's current structure is: for each test case, it checks for i from 0 to n-3 (since the loop runs while i < n-2). Then, if a certain condition is met, outputs NO and breaks. Otherwise, outputs YES.\n\nBut in the problem's solution, the code needs to check that all elements in even positions (0-based even) have the same parity, and all in 0-based odd positions have same parity.\n\nSo perhaps the code is checking for each i, whether a[i] and a[i+2] have the same parity. Because for 0-based, elements at i and i+2 are same parity (even or odd indices). For example, in 0-based:\n\ni=0 (even) and i+2=2 (even) should have same parity.\n\ni=1 (odd) and i+3=3 (odd) should have same parity.\n\nSo for each 0-based even index i, check that a[i] and a[i+2] have the same parity. Similarly for odd indices.\n\nSo the code loops over i from 0 to n-3 (since i+2 can be up to n-1 when i is n-3). So the loop runs for i from 0 to n-3. Because if n is the size, then i can be up to (n-1) - 2 = n-3. For example, if n=5, then n-3=2. i can be 0,1,2. Then i+2 is 2,3,4 (which is allowed). So that's correct.\n\nSo the code's loop is for i=0 to n-3, checking whether a[i] and a[i+2] have the same parity. If any pair doesn't, then it's impossible. So the code is checking for the same parity in every even-even pair and odd-odd pair.\n\nSo the condition in the code should check if a[i] and a[i+2] have different parities. If so, output NO.\n\nWait, for example, for 0-based even indices (i=0,2,4...). For each consecutive even index (i and i+2), check if their parity is the same. If any pair is not, then it's impossible.\n\nSo the condition in the code is: if (a[i] % 2) != (a[i+2] % 2), then output NO.\n\nBut the code has the loop for i from 0 to n-2. Wait, the original code's loop is written as for(int i=0;i <n-2;i++). So if n is 5, i runs 0,1,2. But n-2 is 3, so i <3. So yes, for n=5, i will be 0,1,2. Then i+2 will be 2,3,4.\n\nBut for even indices (i=0,2,4), when we check i=0, i+2=2 (even), then i=2, i+2=4 (even). So for even indices, the loop steps are correct. Similarly, for odd indices (i=1,3), but in the loop, for example, when i=1, i+2=3 (odd), so the code checks a[1] and a[3] parities.\n\nBut the code is in a loop from i=0 to n-3, which is correct. Because if the array has length n, then the maximum i is n-3, so that i+2 is n-1 (the last element).\n\nSo the code's loop is correct. The missing condition is checking whether a[i] and a[i+2] have the same parity. If any of them don't, then the answer is NO.\n\nSo the missing code in the if condition is: (a[i] % 2) != (a[i+2] % 2). Because if any pair (i, i+2) have different parities, then it's impossible to satisfy the conditions.\n\nThus, the code should check for each i from 0 to n-3, if a[i] % 2 != a[i+2] %2, then output NO.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif (a[i] % 2 != a[i+2] % 2)\n\nSo putting that into the code's if condition.\n\nSo the answer is to fill in the condition with (a[i]%2 != a[i+2]%2).\n\nTesting this:\n\nFor example, the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1: array is [1, 2, 1]. The code checks:\n\ni=0: a[0] =1 (odd), a[2] =1 (odd). Same parity. So condition is false.\n\ni=1: a[1] =2 (even), a[3] is beyond the array (since n=3, i=1 is n-3=0? Wait, n=3. The loop runs i <3-2=1. So i can be 0 only. Because n-2 is 1, and the loop is i <1. So for n=3, the loop runs i=0.\n\nWait, the code's loop is for (int i=0; i <n-2; i++). So for n=3, n-2=1. So i runs from 0 to 0 (since i <1). So i=0.\n\nSo for the first test case, the code checks i=0. a[0] and a[2] are both 1, so same parity. The condition is not triggered. So code proceeds to output YES.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor the second test case in the problem statement (sample input 2):\n\nThe array is [2, 2]. The code's loop runs i from 0 to n-2=0 (n=2). So i <0, loop doesn't execute. So code outputs YES. But according to the problem, the answer is NO.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, in the second test case, the array is [2,2]. The elements are even, but according to the problem's note, the answer is NO. Wait, but according to our conditions, in this case, the even positions (0-based) are 0 (even) and 1 (even). Wait, wait. Wait, the array has 2 elements. For 0-based indices:\n\n0 is even (1-based 1, which is odd). 1 is odd (1-based 2, which is even). So the elements are:\n\na[0] =2 (even) (1-based 1, odd index). So in the code's terms, the odd indices (1-based) are 0-based even.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's re-examine.\n\nIn the problem's second test case:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the array is [2,2]. The code checks for all even indices (0-based even and even indices in 1-based terms). Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe 1-based indices are 1 and 2. The elements are 2 and 2.\n\nIn 0-based terms:\n\na[0] is 2 (1-based index 1, which is odd). So this is an odd index in the problem's terms.\n\na[1] is 2 (1-based index 2, even).\n\nSo, the code's first condition is that all elements at 0-based even indices (i%2==0) have the same parity. For 0-based even indices, the elements are a[0] (2) and a[2] (if exists). But in this case, the array has length 2. So the loop runs for i=0 to n-2-1? Wait, no. For n=2, n-2 is 0. The loop condition is i <0. So the loop does not execute.\n\nThus, the code would output YES. But according to the sample input 2, the answer should be NO.\n\nWait, this suggests a problem with the code's logic.\n\nWait, the sample input 2 is:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=2\n\narray [2,2]\n\nSample output is NO.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nBecause applying any operations, the elements can't have the same parity.\n\nOriginal array is [2,2]. All even. So parity is even. So according to the code, the code would output YES. But the sample answer is NO.\n\nWait, this is conflicting. What's the issue here.\n\nWait, the sample input 2's answer is NO. But according to the conditions:\n\nIn the sample input 2, the array is [2,2]. So:\n\nElements at 0-based even indices (i=0) have parity 0.\n\nElements at 0-based odd indices (i=1) have parity 0.\n\nSo all even indices (0-based) have same parity. All odd indices (0-based) have same parity (only one element, a[1] is even). So according to the conditions, the answer should be YES. But the sample answer is NO.\n\nHmm, this suggests a mistake in the reasoning.\n\nWait, this must mean that there's a mistake in the logic. Let's re-examine the problem statement.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\nSample Output: NO.\n\nBut according to the reasoning, the answer should be YES. Because all elements are even. So the output should be YES. But the sample says NO.\n\nWait, this is a contradiction. Let's check the problem's note for the second test case:\n\nNote: For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity. So the answer is NO.\n\nWait, but the initial array is [2, 2], which are even. So the answer should be YES. But according to the note, the answer is NO.\n\nThis suggests that my reasoning is incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nDetermine if after any number of operations it is possible to make the final array contain only even numbers or only odd numbers.\n\nWait, the array in sample input 2 is already all even. So the answer should be YES. But according to the note, the sample input 2's answer is NO. So there must be a mistake in understanding the sample input.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the test cases. Let me look at the note again.\n\nNotes:\n\nFor the first test case: array [1,2,1] becomes [1,3,1] (after adding 1 to even indices (1-based)), making all odd.\n\nSecond test case: after any number of operations, can't make same parity. So the answer is NO.\n\nThird test case: all elements already same parity.\n\nFourth test case: possible.\n\nBut what is the second test case's input? According to the note, perhaps the second test case is [2,2], but the sample says output is NO. That can't be, because the array is already all even.\n\nSo perhaps I'm mixing up the test cases. Let me check the note again.\n\nWait, the first test case in the note is array [1, 2, 1], which after adding to even indices becomes [1,3,1], all odd. So that's possible.\n\nThe second test case in the note is a case where after any operations, you can't make all elements same parity. So perhaps the second test case's array is [2,2], but the answer is NO. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is different. Let's check.\n\nThe sample input 2 in the note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is 'NO'.\"\n\nBut what's the array for the second test case?\n\nAh, perhaps the second test case is [2, 3]. Let's see.\n\nOriginal array: even and odd. \n\nLet's see possible operations:\n\nIf we do an even operation (add 1 to even indices, i.e., index 2 in 1-based, which is index 1 in 0-based). So the array becomes [2,4]. Now all even. So answer is YES. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the sample input 2 is not [2,2], but another array.\n\nAh, I think I must have made a mistake in reading the note. Let me recheck the note.\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is 'NO'.\"\n\nBut what is the array for this case?\n\nWait, perhaps the array is [2, 1].\n\nLet's see:\n\nOriginal array: [2 (even), 1 (odd)].\n\nPossible operations:\n\nIf we do an odd operation (add 1 to odd indices, which are 1-based indices 1,3, etc. In 0-based, index 0, 2, etc. So in 0-based, for array of size 2, the odd indices are 0 and 2 (but only index 0 exists). So adding 1 to index 0 (0-based) would make it 3 (odd). The array becomes [3, 1]. Both odd: answer YES.\n\nSo this is possible. Not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the array is [1,2].\n\nOriginal array: 1 (odd), 2 (even).\n\nDo an even operation: add to even indices (1-based index 2: 0-based index 1). So array becomes [1,3]. Both odd. So answer YES.\n\nSo perhaps the second test case is not a 2-element array but a 3-element array.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the array is [1,2,3].\n\nThen, check the conditions.\n\nFor the code's logic, the even positions (0-based even: indices 0, 2) have parities 1 (odd) and 3 (odd). So same parity. Odd positions (0-based 1): 2 (even). So same parity. So according to the code, answer is YES. Because x and y can be chosen to make all parities same.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the second test case's answer is NO, which suggests that the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nThis indicates that the initial reasoning was wrong.\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nPerhaps the code's approach is incorrect. Let's re-examine.\n\nThe code is checking for each i from 0 to n-2, and if a[i] and a[i+2] have different parities, output NO. But maybe there's a mistake in how the indices are handled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not checking all pairs.\n\nLet me think of the sample input 2 from the problem's note. Let's say that the array is [2,2]. According to the code's logic, the answer would be YES, but according to the note, it's NO. So the code's logic is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the second test case's array must be such that even after any operations, it's impossible to make all elements have the same parity. So perhaps the code's approach is missing something.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem.\n\nThe key is that the operations can be applied any number of times. So each operation can be applied even or odd times. Each application of an operation toggles the parity of the relevant elements.\n\nSo, for the array to have all elements same parity, it's necessary that:\n\nAfter applying x (number of times odd operations) and y (number of times even operations), all elements' parities are the same.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, in the second test case, it's impossible. Let's try to find what array would make it impossible.\n\nLet's consider an array with two elements where the first is even and the second is even. \n\nOriginal parities: even, even.\n\nBut the code's logic would output YES, because all even and odd indices have same parity.\n\nBut according to the note, the second test case's answer is NO. So there's a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the second test case's array is [1,1]. So both are odd. Then code would output YES, which is correct. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case's array is [1, 2, 3]. \n\nOdd indices (0-based even indices 0 and 2) are 1 and 3, both odd. Even indices (0-based 1) is 2, even. So according to code, output YES. So possible.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the second test case is impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem for each possible array.\n\nSuppose the array is [2,2], n=2.\n\nThe operations are:\n\n- Odd operation: add 1 to elements at 1-based odd indices (0-based even indices). For n=2, the indices are 0 and 1 (1-based 1 and 2). So the odd indices are 0-based 0.\n\nSo after an odd operation, a[0] becomes 3 (odd), a[1] remains 2. Now the array is [3,2]. Parities are odd and even.\n\nAlternatively, an even operation adds 1 to 1-based even indices (0-based 1). So a[1] becomes 3. Now the array is [2,3]. Parities even and odd.\n\nWe can also apply multiple operations.\n\nThe possible scenarios after applying any number of operations:\n\nThe parity of a[0] depends on the number of odd operations (x). The parity of a[1] depends on the number of even operations (y).\n\nThe parity of a[0] is (2's initial parity 0) + x mod 2.\n\nThe parity of a[1] is (2's initial parity 0) + y mod 2.\n\nWe need these to be the same.\n\nSo 0 +x \u2261 0 +y mod 2 \u2192 x \u2261 y mod 2.\n\nSo possible if x and y are even (both 0) \u2192 parities 0 and 0 \u2192 same.\n\nOr x and y are both 1 \u2192 parities 1 and 1 \u2192 same.\n\nSo, for x=0 and y=0: all even.\n\nFor x=1 and y=1: all odd.\n\nSo answer is YES. So why does the note say that the second test case has output NO? Because the array must be different.\n\nAh, this indicates that the code's approach is correct, but the sample input is not as I thought.\n\nPerhaps the second test case in the note is different. For example, the array has elements with varying parities in even and odd indices.\n\nFor example, consider the array [1, 2, 2]. Then:\n\nOdd indices (0-based even: 0 and 2) have parities 1 and 0. So they are different. So code would output NO.\n\nThus, the code's logic would correctly output NO.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut why does the sample input 2 have output NO?\n\nThe sample input 2's array must be such that the even indices have varying parities or the odd indices do.\n\nFor example, array [1, 2, 3]. \n\nOdd indices (0-based even) are 1 and 3 (parity 1 and 1: same).\n\nEven indices (0-based odd) are 2 (parity 0: even). So code would output YES.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 4]. \n\nOdd indices (0-based even): 1 and 4. Their parities are 1 and 0. Different. So code would output NO.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct and the missing condition is (a[i] %2 != a[i+2]%2).\n\nThus, the code's missing code is:\n\nif (a[i] % 2 != a[i + 2] % 2)\n\nSo the code should be filled in with that condition."
