Now, since length was already set (>=0), notComplete is decremented by 1 (so becomes 0), and length is updated to min(2 + u1.length, 0 + 1 + u2.length) = min(2 + u1.length, 1 + u2.length).

But in this case, for each new u (original outgoing edge) that is processed, the code is considering blocking all edges except the ones processed so far. Wait, but this approach may not capture all possibilities. For example, for a node w with two outgoing edges u1 and u2. Suppose u1 has a length of 2 and u2 has a length of 3. Then, the minimal for w would be min( (k-1) +1 + u1.length, (k-1) +1 + u2.length ). Which is (1 +1 + 2) =4 vs (1 +1 +3)=5. So 4 is better. So the minimal is 4. But in the code's approach, when u1 is processed (assuming u1 is processed before u2), computeScore for w would set length to (2-1) +1 +2 = 4. Then, when u2 is processed, computeScore would decrement notComplete to 0, and the new candidate is 0 +1 +3=4. So the code would compare 4 and 4, and not change the length. But the correct minimal is 4, which is already captured. But in another scenario where a node w has two edges: u1 (length 5) and u2 (length 3), and the code processes u1 first. Initially, notComplete is 1 (2-1), and length is 1+1+5=7. Then, when u2 is processed, notComplete is 0, new candidate is 0+1+3=4. So length is updated to 4. So the code correctly captures this. But in the code, the computeScore function is called for each u in u.in. But when a new u is processed, the code allows the length to be updated. So the condition in the if statement after computeScore is called is whether the computeScore function actually modified the length. But how can we detect that? Wait, the computeScore function doesn't return anything. So the code must track whether the length was changed.",

But that's not correct. Because the blocking for u1 would require (out.size() -1) days. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code. Let's re-express the computeScore function:\n\nvoid computeScore(Vertex v) {\n    if (complete) return;\n    if (length >=0) {\n        // already had a length, so this is another possible path\n        notComplete--; \n        // notComplete is now (original out.size()-1) - (number of times computeScore has been called)\n        // so for the first call, notComplete is (k-1) - 1 = k-2\n        length = Math.min(notComplete + v.length +1, length);\n    } else {\n        // first time setting the length\n        notComplete = out.size() -1;\n        length = notComplete + v.length +1;\n    }\n} Wait, this approach seems wrong. Because for each subsequent call to computeScore (for another u), the notComplete is decremented again. So, suppose a node w has 3 outgoing edges (so out.size() is 3). First call computeScore for u1 (some outgoing edge):\n\nIn the else clause, notComplete is 2, length is 2 + u1.length +1 = 3 + u1.length. Then, when computeScore is called again for u2 (another outgoing edge): In the if clause (since length is >=0), notComplete is 2 -1 = 1. Then, the candidate is 1 + u2.length +1 = 2 + u2.length. Then, length is the minimum between existing (3 + u1.length) and 2 + u2.length. Third call for u3:\n\nnotComplete becomes 0. Candidate is 0 + u3.length +1 = 1 + u3.length. Compare with current length. So the code is trying to track the minimal value over all possible outgoing edges, considering that each subsequent edge processed allows us to block fewer roads. But this logic doesn't make sense. Because when you process the first outgoing edge, you block (k-1) roads, which takes (k-1) days. When you process the second edge, you can only block (k-2) roads. But that's not correct. Ah! Because the code is considering the order in which the edges are processed.",

Looking at the code inside the for loop over u.in: \n\nfor(Vertex w : u.in) {\n    if(/* missing condition */) {\n        w.computeScore(u);\n        queue.add(new VertexScore(w, w.length));\n    }\n}\n\nSo, the missing condition is whether the computeScore function has modified w's length.

But without tracking that, the code can't know. Alternatively, perhaps the code should check whether w's length after computeScore is now valid (>=0) and not complete. But in the code, after computeScore is called, if w's length was previously -1 and now is set, then we should add it to the queue. Otherwise, if it was already set, but the new candidate is better, then also add it. But how to check that.",

But in this code, 'v' is u (the parameter passed to computeScore). Wait, the computeScore function is called with u as the parameter. In the code's computeScore function, when w's length is not set, then the new length is (out.size() -1) + 1 + u.length.

But if w is not complete, computeScore will proceed. But why have the condition here? Because if w is complete, there's no need to process it. Thus, the condition is '!w.complete'. Thus, the missing code is '!w.complete'. Thus, the correct answer is to fill the missing condition with '!w.complete'.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to understand what this problem is asking. So, the goal is to find the minimum number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can meet in city n (AmShZ's house) after at most d days. The way they communicate each day is by AmShZ sending messages\u2014either blocking a road or telling Keshi to move. \n\nHmm, the key here is to model the problem in a way that allows us to compute the minimum days. From the code provided, it looks like a BFS approach is being used, but with some priority queue, which makes me think of Dijkstra's algorithm. Because the problem is about finding the shortest path with certain constraints.\n\nLooking at the code structure: the Vertex class has in and out adjacency lists. The main part starts from the destination (city n) and works backward. The priority queue is handling vertices based on their length (which I assume is the minimal days needed to reach the destination from that vertex). \n\nWait, in the code, the queue is initialized with the destination (n-1 index since it's 0-based), and the length is set to 0. Then, for each iteration, they process the vertex with the smallest length. So this is a reverse traversal from n to 1, calculating the minimal days required. \n\nThe computeScore function is called when processing incoming edges (since it's reversed). For a vertex w, which is in the in list of u (the current vertex being processed), we want to update w's length. \n\nSo, the idea here is that for each vertex w, when processing u (which is a neighbor of w in the original graph), we calculate the minimal days needed for Keshi to reach n from w. The computeScore function seems to be considering the blocking strategy. \n\nThe condition in the if statement where the TODO is located is crucial. The code adds w to the queue if the condition is met. So, what's the condition here? \n\nThe computeScore method for vertex w is called with u. When we process u (which is a node that can reach the destination), we need to check if all the outgoing edges of w (in the original graph) that lead to nodes with higher priority (i.e., shorter path) have been considered. Wait, maybe it's about the number of unprocessed out edges. \n\nLooking at the computeScore function: when w hasn't been processed (complete is false), and if length was previously set (>=0), then notComplete is decremented, and the length is updated to the minimum between the existing value and (notComplete + u.length + 1). Otherwise, it initializes notComplete as out.size() -1, and sets length to notComplete + u.length +1. \n\nWait, the notComplete variable in the Vertex class probably represents the number of outgoing edges (from the original graph) that haven't been blocked yet. Because, for each node w, the optimal strategy is to block all outgoing edges except the one that leads to the shortest path. So, if a node w has k outgoing edges, then the worst case is that Keshi might take the longest path, but AmShZ can block all but the best edge. \n\nSo, when processing node u (which is a neighbor of w in the original graph), for each such u, we can consider that AmShZ will block all other outgoing edges of w except the one leading to u. Then, the time for w would be the number of blocked roads (k-1) days (since each day you block one road) plus 1 day to move. But also, the time from u is added. So, the total days for w would be (k-1) + 1 + u.length. \n\nBut how is this being tracked in the code? The computeScore function seems to be handling this. The notComplete variable starts at the number of outgoing edges minus 1 (since blocking all except one). Then, for each time computeScore is called (each time a neighbor u is processed), the notComplete decreases. The length is then the minimum between the existing length and (notComplete + u.length +1). \n\nSo the condition in the if statement is checking whether all the possible outgoing edges (except the current one) have been blocked. Wait, no. Because when a node w has multiple outgoing edges leading to different nodes, we need to consider all of them and choose the one that gives the minimal days. \n\nIn the code, for each incoming edge to u (in the reversed graph, which corresponds to an outgoing edge from w in the original graph), when processing u, we check if w's current notComplete (the number of outgoing edges that haven't been considered yet) is such that adding this edge (u) gives a better (smaller) length. \n\nSo, the code is using a dynamic approach where, for each node w, when processing a neighbor u (in the reversed graph), we check if this is the best possible path. The computeScore function is handling the calculation. \n\nBut the condition in the if statement is supposed to determine when to update the score of w. So, the code adds w to the queue if it's the first time (when w's length was -1) or if the new calculated length is better than the previous one. \n\nWait, but how is the code ensuring that we process all possible paths and pick the minimal? The computeScore function seems to be handling the logic of updating the length based on the number of blocked roads required. \n\nThe if condition in the loop (inside the for loop where w is in u.in) is checking whether after processing u (which is a neighbor of w in the reversed graph), the w's length should be updated. But when should we add w to the queue? \n\nThe condition probably is whether the current u's processing allows us to compute a better (smaller) length for w. So, the code should only proceed if the new computed length is better. \n\nWait, the computeScore function is called for w when processing u. So, when you process u (which is part of w's outgoing edges in the original graph), you check if blocking all other edges (except the one leading to u) would give a better result. \n\nBut how do we model that? For each node w, the minimal days would be the minimal over all possible u (neighbors in the reversed graph) of (number of edges in out list of w except u) + 1 (for moving) + the minimal days for u. \n\nBut in order to compute this, for each neighbor u of w (original graph's outgoing edges), we need to compute (k-1) + 1 + u.length, where k is the number of outgoing edges from w. Wait, but the code uses notComplete as out.size() - 1. Wait, out.size() is the number of outgoing edges from w in the original graph. So, notComplete starts as (out.size() -1), which would be the maximum number of days required to block all edges except one. Then, when you process each u (neighbor in the reversed graph), you can see if this u's length plus the blocked days gives a better result. \n\nSo, for the computeScore function: \n\nInitially, when w's length is -1 (not computed), we set notComplete to out.size() -1 (number of edges to block) and set length to (out.size() -1) + 1 (the day to move) + u.length. \n\nBut if there are multiple outgoing edges, and we process them in some order (probably based on their u's length), then when we process a new u, the notComplete decreases (since each time you process a u, you've considered one more possible outgoing edge, and thus the number of required blocked days decreases). \n\nWait, the computeScore function's logic is that when you have multiple outgoing edges, each time you process a u (a possible outgoing edge), you can choose to block all other edges except this one. The notComplete variable is the number of edges that need to be blocked. So, when you process the first u, you block (out.size() -1) edges (all except this u). Then, when you process another u', you have to block (out.size() -2) edges (since you can block all except u and u', but to choose the best path). Wait, no. That doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using a dynamic programming approach where, for each node w, the minimal days is the minimum over all possible outgoing edges u, (number of edges to block to leave only u) + 1 (day to move) + u's days. \n\nBut since blocking is done in the first days, the total days would be (number of blocks) + 1 (move day) + u.days. \n\nBut to find the minimal total days, we need to choose the u which gives (k-1) + 1 + u.days, where k is the number of outgoing edges of w. However, this is only if all other edges are blocked first. \n\nWait, but how is this possible? For example, if a node w has 3 outgoing edges. Then, to force Keshi to take the edge leading to u, AmShZ would need to block the other two edges. Those blocks take two days. Then on the third day, send the move command. So the total days for w would be 2 (block days) + 1 (move) + u.days. \n\nSo, the minimal d for w is the minimum of (k-1) + 1 + u.days for all u in w's outgoing edges. \n\nAh, right. So for each w, the minimal days is the minimal (out.size() - 1) + 1 + u.days. Which simplifies to (out.size() -1 + 1) + u.days - 1? Wait no. Wait, (k-1) blocks (each day you block one road) and then one day to move. So that's (k-1) + 1 = k days. Then add the u.days. So for each outgoing edge, the total is k + u.days, where k is the number of outgoing edges of w. But wait, no: the number of days to block is (k-1) (because you have k outgoing edges, but you leave one unblocked). So for each u in the outgoing edges, the cost is (k-1) + 1 + u.days. Which is (k) + u.days. \n\nBut since we can choose any of the outgoing edges, we need the minimal value of (k) + u.days. \n\nBut how does the code model this? Let's see. The code's computeScore function for w when processing u (which is an outgoing edge in the original graph) does the following. \n\nInitially, when the length is -1 (not computed), notComplete is set to out.size() -1 (k-1), and the length is (k-1) + 1 + u.length. Which is k + u.length. \n\nBut then, if there's another u' (another outgoing edge), when computeScore is called again, notComplete is (out.size() -1) again? Wait, no. Because notComplete is part of the Vertex's state. So when we process u', which is another outgoing edge of w, the notComplete would be (out.size() -1) again. Wait, but that's not correct. Because once we process u, and then process u', perhaps we can find a better path. \n\nWait, maybe the code is considering that for each outgoing edge u of w, the possible value is (number of edges not in u) + 1 + u.length. Then, the minimal of these values is the correct answer for w. \n\nBut how does the code track the minimal value? The computeScore function seems to be keeping track of the minimal possible length by iteratively considering each possible u. \n\nLet me think. Suppose w has two outgoing edges, u1 and u2. \n\nWhen we process u1 (from the reversed graph), computeScore for w would set notComplete to 1 (since out.size() is 2, 2-1=1), and length would be 1+1 + u1.length = 2 + u1.length. \n\nThen, when we process u2, the computeScore is called again. Now, since length was already set (>=0), notComplete is decremented by 1 (so becomes 0), and length is updated to min(2 + u1.length, 0 + 1 + u2.length) = min(2 + u1.length, 1 + u2.length). \n\nSo the minimal between the two possibilities. \n\nSo, for each u in w's outgoing edges, when processed, the code checks if the current notComplete (initially k-1, then k-2, etc.) plus 1 + u.length is better than the existing length. \n\nThus, the code is processing all possible outgoing edges and, for each, calculating the possible length, and keeping the minimal. \n\nSo, the condition in the if statement is whether this is the first time the node is being considered (length is -1) or if the new computed length is better than the existing one. But wait, the code adds w to the queue every time the computeScore is called. But that's not efficient. \n\nBut how is the code ensuring that only the best possible (minimal) length is considered? \n\nThe queue is a priority queue that processes nodes in order of their current length. So, once a node is added to the queue with a certain length, even if a better (smaller) length is found later, the queue may have the old entry. However, the code uses a 'complete' flag. Once a node is marked as complete (processed), it's removed from the queue. \n\nSo the code is using a Dijkstra-like approach where each node is processed once (when it's the minimal in the queue), and then marked as complete. \n\nBut wait, the code starts with the destination node (n-1) and processes nodes in order of their length. For each node u being processed, it iterates over all incoming edges (which correspond to outgoing edges in the original graph) and updates the source nodes of those edges (w in u's in list). \n\nSo, the code is working in reverse. For example, the destination has length 0. Then, nodes that can reach the destination in one step (original graph's edges into destination) are processed next. \n\nBut the condition in the if statement is crucial here. The code is adding w to the queue if the computeScore leads to a new minimal length. \n\nSo, the code is in the process of building the minimal days for each node. \n\nThe missing code is in the if condition when adding w to the queue. The condition checks whether computeScore should update the length and whether to add w to the queue. \n\nLooking at the code inside the for loop over u.in (which is the list of vertices that have an edge pointing to u in the original graph, i.e., in the reversed graph, u's in list represents the original edges into u). \n\nFor each w in u's in list (so in the original graph, there's an edge from w to u), when u is processed, we compute the score for w. \n\nThe computeScore function for w when called with u (the neighbor) would update w's length if possible. \n\nBut the code adds w to the queue only if the computeScore function actually modifies the length. So, the condition in the if statement is whether after calling computeScore, w's length has been updated. \n\nWait, how does computeScore work? Let's look again. \n\nIn computeScore: \n\nIf the vertex w is already complete (processed), return. \n\nIf length >=0 (already had a value), then decrement notComplete by 1 (since another outgoing edge is considered). Then, the new candidate length is notComplete (now decremented) + u.length + 1. The current length is the minimum between the existing length and the new candidate. \n\nBut in this case, for each new u (original outgoing edge) that is processed, the code is considering blocking all edges except the ones processed so far. \n\nWait, but this approach may not capture all possibilities. For example, for a node w with two outgoing edges u1 and u2. Suppose u1 has a length of 2 and u2 has a length of 3. Then, the minimal for w would be min( (k-1) +1 + u1.length, (k-1) +1 + u2.length ). Which is (1 +1 + 2) =4 vs (1 +1 +3)=5. So 4 is better. So the minimal is 4. \n\nBut in the code's approach, when u1 is processed (assuming u1 is processed before u2), computeScore for w would set length to (2-1) +1 +2 = 4. Then, when u2 is processed, computeScore would decrement notComplete to 0, and the new candidate is 0 +1 +3=4. So the code would compare 4 and 4, and not change the length. \n\nBut the correct minimal is 4, which is already captured. \n\nBut in another scenario where a node w has two edges: u1 (length 5) and u2 (length 3), and the code processes u1 first. \n\nInitially, notComplete is 1 (2-1), and length is 1+1+5=7. Then, when u2 is processed, notComplete is 0, new candidate is 0+1+3=4. So length is updated to 4. \n\nSo the code correctly captures this. \n\nBut in the code, the computeScore function is called for each u in u.in. But when a new u is processed, the code allows the length to be updated. \n\nSo the condition in the if statement after computeScore is called is whether the computeScore function actually modified the length. But how can we detect that? \n\nWait, the computeScore function doesn't return anything. So the code must track whether the length was changed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if the new candidate length is better than the previous one. \n\nBut how is that represented in the code? \n\nThe code adds w to the queue in the loop: \n\nif(/* condition */) { \n    w.computeScore(u);\n    queue.add(...);\n}\n\nSo, the condition is whether adding this u to w's possible paths results in a better (smaller) length. \n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that after computeScore, the length of w is now valid (i.e., it's the first time it's computed), or that the new length is better than before. \n\nBut how can we check that in the code? \n\nLooking at the computeScore function:\n\nWhen w's length is not yet set (length == -1), then it's initialized to (out.size()-1) + 1 + u.length. Which is out.size() + u.length. \n\nIf length was already set, then we compute a new candidate as (notComplete -1) +1 + u.length? Wait, no. Wait, the code does:\n\nnotComplete--; \nlength = Math.min(notComplete + v.length +1, length);\n\nWait, in the case where length was already set (>=0), notComplete is the number of outgoing edges minus 1, but that's perhaps not the case. \n\nWait, in the computeScore function:\n\nWhen length is >=0 (i.e., not the first time), then notComplete is decremented by 1 (so, each time computeScore is called for a new u). \n\nSo, notComplete starts at (out.size() -1) and decreases by 1 each time computeScore is called. \n\nThen, the new candidate is (notComplete) (after decrement) + v.length (u's length) +1. \n\nSo for the first time computeScore is called (u1), notComplete is (out.size() -1). Then, after the first call, notComplete becomes (out.size() -2), and the candidate is (out.size() -2) + u1.length +1. \n\nBut that's not correct. Because the blocking for u1 would require (out.size() -1) days. \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code. \n\nLet's re-express the computeScore function:\n\nvoid computeScore(Vertex v) {\n    if (complete) return;\n    if (length >=0) {\n        // already had a length, so this is another possible path\n        notComplete--; \n        // notComplete is now (original out.size()-1) - (number of times computeScore has been called)\n        // so for the first call, notComplete is (k-1) - 1 = k-2\n        length = Math.min(notComplete + v.length +1, length);\n    } else {\n        // first time setting the length\n        notComplete = out.size() -1;\n        length = notComplete + v.length +1;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, this approach seems wrong. Because for each subsequent call to computeScore (for another u), the notComplete is decremented again. \n\nSo, suppose a node w has 3 outgoing edges (so out.size() is 3). \n\nFirst call computeScore for u1 (some outgoing edge):\n\nIn the else clause, notComplete is 2, length is 2 + u1.length +1 = 3 + u1.length. \n\nThen, when computeScore is called again for u2 (another outgoing edge):\n\nIn the if clause (since length is >=0), notComplete is 2 -1 = 1. Then, the candidate is 1 + u2.length +1 = 2 + u2.length. Then, length is the minimum between existing (3 + u1.length) and 2 + u2.length. \n\nThird call for u3:\n\nnotComplete becomes 0. Candidate is 0 + u3.length +1 = 1 + u3.length. Compare with current length. \n\nSo the code is trying to track the minimal value over all possible outgoing edges, considering that each subsequent edge processed allows us to block fewer roads. \n\nBut this logic doesn't make sense. Because when you process the first outgoing edge, you block (k-1) roads, which takes (k-1) days. When you process the second edge, you can only block (k-2) roads. But that's not correct. \n\nAh! Because the code is considering the order in which the edges are processed. When the first edge is processed (u1), the code assumes that the optimal strategy is to block all other edges except u1, leading to (k-1) days of blocking. Then, when a second edge (u2) is processed, the code assumes that you can block (k-2) edges (excluding u1 and u2?), but that's not possible. \n\nWait, this approach seems incorrect. The problem is that the code's current logic for computeScore is not correct. \n\nThe correct approach is that for each node w, the minimal days is the minimal value of (k-1) + 1 + u.length, where u is any outgoing edge of w. \n\nBut in the code's current approach, computeScore is called for each u in the order that u is processed. For each u, the code computes (k-1 - calls_made) + 1 + u.length, which is not correct. \n\nSo, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect. But given that we have to fill in the missing condition, perhaps the code's logic is correct, and the missing condition is whether the current u's contribution gives a better (smaller) length for w. \n\nThe condition in the if statement after the computeScore call is whether this call has contributed to the length of w. But how to track that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is missing a check to see if the new length after computeScore is different from the previous value. \n\nBut since computeScore's code changes the length, we need to check if the new length is less than the previous one, and if so, add it to the queue. \n\nBut how to track that? \n\nWait, in the code, after calling w.computeScore(u), we need to add w to the priority queue if the new length is better than before. \n\nBut computeScore returns void. So, how can we know whether the length changed? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's computeScore function always updates the length to the minimum possible. So, whenever computeScore is called, it may update the length, but only when the new candidate is better. \n\nThus, after computeScore is called, we should add w to the queue if the new length is better (i.e., the length has been updated). \n\nBut how do we track whether the length was updated? \n\nAlternatively, the code is designed so that whenever computeScore is called, and the new length is better than the previous one, it's added to the queue. \n\nBut how to ensure that? \n\nWait, in the code's computeScore function, the first time it's called for w (length was -1), it sets the length to (out.size() -1) + 1 + u.length. Then, adds w to the queue. \n\nSubsequent calls to computeScore for w (when other u's are processed) will decrement notComplete and compute a new candidate. If the new candidate is smaller than the current length, then the length is updated, and w is added to the queue again. \n\nBut in the code's current structure, the queue may have multiple entries for the same w with different scores. However, when a node is marked as complete, it's removed from the queue. \n\nSo, the priority queue will process the smallest possible length for w first, and once it's marked as complete, any other entries for w in the queue are ignored. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nNow, the missing condition is when to add w to the queue. \n\nThe code adds w to the queue after computeScore if the code's computeScore function has modified the length. \n\nBut how can we check that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should add w to the queue every time computeScore is called, but the priority queue will handle it correctly. \n\nBut this would lead to multiple entries of the same vertex in the queue with different scores. However, since we use a priority queue, the smallest one will be processed first. Once the vertex is marked as complete, the other entries are ignored. \n\nBut in the code, after processing a vertex, it's marked as complete, and other entries in the queue are skipped. \n\nSo, perhaps the code doesn't need to check any condition, and simply adds w to the queue every time computeScore is called. \n\nBut that would lead to adding w to the queue multiple times. But the code's loop structure seems to be adding w to the queue whenever computeScore is called. \n\nLooking at the code inside the for loop over u.in: \n\nfor(Vertex w : u.in) {\n    if(/* missing condition */) {\n        w.computeScore(u);\n        queue.add(new VertexScore(w, w.length));\n    }\n}\n\nSo, the missing condition is whether the computeScore function has modified w's length. \n\nBut how to check that. \n\nPerhaps the condition is whether the new length after computeScore is different from the previous length. But since computeScore is a void function, the code must track the previous length. \n\nAlternatively, the computeScore function returns a boolean indicating whether the length was changed, but that's not the case. \n\nWait, let's think of the first time computeScore is called for w. The initial length is -1. After computeScore, length becomes a positive value. So, the code should add it to the queue. \n\nFor subsequent calls, when the new candidate is better than the previous length, the code should add it again. \n\nBut the code has no way to track whether the length was updated. So, perhaps the code should always add w to the queue after computeScore. But this would add it multiple times, but since the queue is a priority queue, the smallest length is processed first. Once the node is marked as complete, other entries in the queue are ignored. \n\nSo, perhaps the missing condition is simply that the node w hasn't been processed yet (i.e., w.complete is false). But in the code, the computeScore function checks if the node is complete and returns if it is. \n\nAlternatively, the code should add w to the queue every time computeScore is called. \n\nBut in the code as written, the condition is missing. So, perhaps the condition is always true. So, the missing code is to have 'true' as the condition. But that's not possible. \n\nWait, the code as written is in Java. The loop is:\n\nfor(Vertex w : u.in) {\n    if(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n        w.computeScore(u);\n        queue.add(new VertexScore(w, w.length));\n    }\n}\n\nSo, the condition here is a boolean. The code is supposed to determine whether to call computeScore and add to the queue. \n\nBut according to the logic, whenever w's computeScore is called, the code should add w to the queue. \n\nBut if computeScore is called regardless, then the code will process all possible incoming edges, leading to the correct calculation. \n\nBut what if the condition is whether computeScore has modified the length? \n\nBut how can we check that. \n\nAlternatively, the code may need to check if w's length was not set before, or if the new length after computeScore is less than the previous length. \n\nBut since computeScore is called and modifies w's length, perhaps the code should always add w to the queue. \n\nBut that's not the case. For example, if computeScore doesn't modify the length (e.g., the new candidate is larger than the current length), then adding it to the queue again would be redundant. \n\nBut given that the priority queue will have multiple entries for the same vertex, but the vertex will be processed only once (when it's popped from the queue and marked as complete), perhaps the code can add it every time, and the priority queue will handle it. \n\nThus, the condition may simply be 'true', meaning that every time a u is processed, all incoming edges' w's are processed. \n\nBut that's probably not correct. For example, if w has already been added to the queue with a certain length, and then added again with a larger length, the queue would have both entries, but when the vertex is popped (the smallest first), it's marked as complete, and subsequent entries are ignored. \n\nBut in this case, the code would work correctly. \n\nSo, the missing condition is 'true', meaning that for every incoming edge to u (in the reversed graph), we process the corresponding w. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that after computeScore, the w's length is now set for the first time. Or that the computeScore actually updated the length. \n\nBut without tracking that, the code can't know. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check whether w's length after computeScore is now valid (>=0) and not complete. \n\nBut in the code, after computeScore is called, if w's length was previously -1 and now is set, then we should add it to the queue. Otherwise, if it was already set, but the new candidate is better, then also add it. \n\nBut how to check that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's computeScore function is designed such that when it's called for w, it computes the minimal possible length for w based on the processed u's. \n\nBut in this case, the code should call computeScore for all u's in the reversed in list. \n\nBut in the code's current setup, after processing u (which is a node in the reversed graph), for each w in u's in list (original outgoing edges from w to u), computeScore is called. \n\nSo, the code is effectively processing each outgoing edge from w to u, and for each, computes the possible contribution to w's length. \n\nThus, the code needs to process all incoming edges of u (original edges leading into u), and for each, call computeScore and add to the queue. \n\nTherefore, the condition in the if statement should be true. \n\nBut the code is using a priority queue and the computeScore function is designed to track the minimal length. \n\nSo, the missing code is 'w.length == -1 || (notComplete + v.length + 1) < w.length' ? \n\nWait, but in the computeScore function, the code is already handling the comparison. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should call computeScore regardless, and add to the queue every time. \n\nBut in that case, the if condition is 'true', and the code would add w to the queue each time. \n\nBut in the code, after computeScore, the code adds w to the queue. \n\nBut adding multiple entries of w to the queue with different lengths is allowed, and the priority queue will process them in order. \n\nBut in the code's current setup, the queue is a priority queue ordered by the score (which is the current length of the vertex). So, when the first entry of w with the minimal length is processed, the node is marked as complete, and any other entries for w in the queue are ignored. \n\nThus, adding w to the queue every time computeScore is called is safe. \n\nBut how does that fit with the code's structure? \n\nThe code's main loop processes the nodes in order of their current length. \n\nThus, the condition should be 'true', so that for every w in u's in list, computeScore is called and added to the queue. \n\nBut in the code as provided, the condition is missing, and that's what we need to fill in. \n\nWait, but the code's comment says that the missing code is the condition in the if statement. \n\nSo, what is the correct condition here? \n\nThe code's for loop is iterating over all the in-edges of u (from the reversed graph), which are the outgoing edges from w in the original graph. \n\nThe code's logic is that when processing u (the destination in the original graph), we can update the possible paths for w. \n\nBut the condition in the if statement should determine whether the current u is the best candidate for w's minimal length. \n\nBut how can we model that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is whether the current u's processing allows w's length to be updated. \n\nBut computeScore is called regardless. \n\nWait, no. The code inside the if statement's body is: \n\nw.computeScore(u);\nqueue.add(...);\n\nSo, the condition determines whether to execute this code. \n\nIf the condition is true, then computeScore is called, and w is added to the queue. \n\nOtherwise, not. \n\nBut the code's computeScore function is designed to update the length only when necessary. \n\nSo, the condition should be whether w's length is not yet computed (w.length == -1) or the new candidate (notComplete + u.length +1) is less than the current length. \n\nBut how to check that. \n\nBut when computeScore is called, the code will update w's length accordingly. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should call computeScore for every incoming edge, and then add w to the queue if the new length is better. But since computeScore modifies w's length, perhaps the code should always add w to the queue. \n\nBut that would be inefficient, but perhaps correct. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is always true. So, the code is missing the condition 'true'. \n\nBut in the code, for each incoming edge to u, the code is processing all possible w's. \n\nBut this would lead to redundant entries in the queue, but the priority queue would handle them. \n\nBut given that the problem's constraints are up to 2e5 nodes, this approach would be too slow. \n\nSo, the code's logic must be to add w to the queue only when a new, better length is found. \n\nBut how to check that. \n\nPerhaps the code's computeScore function returns a boolean indicating whether the length was updated. \n\nBut since that's not the case, perhaps the code must track whether the length changed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is 'w.length == -1 || (notComplete + v.length + 1) < w.length'. \n\nBut in this code, 'v' is u (the parameter passed to computeScore). \n\nWait, the computeScore function is called with u as the parameter. \n\nIn the code's computeScore function, when w's length is not set, then the new length is (out.size() -1) + 1 + u.length. \n\nIf the length was already set, then the new candidate is (notComplete -1) + 1 + u.length. \n\nWait, no. Let's re-express:\n\nIn computeScore:\n\nif (length >=0) {\n    notComplete--;\n    length = Math.min( notComplete + v.length +1, length );\n} else {\n    notComplete = out.size() -1;\n    length = notComplete + v.length +1;\n}\n\nSo, when called for the first time, notComplete is out.size() -1, and length is (out.size() -1) + 1 + u.length = out.size() + u.length. \n\nWhen called again for another u, notComplete is out.size() -1 -1 (assuming this is the second call), and the new candidate is (out.size() -2) + 1 + u.length. \n\nBut this candidate is (out.size() -1) + u.length. \n\nSo, the code is trying to find the minimal value of (out.size() - (number of computeScore calls)) + u.length. \n\nBut this approach is not correct. For example, if a node has 3 outgoing edges. The first computeScore call for u1 sets length to 3 + u1.length. The second call for u2 computes (3-1) + u2.length = 2 + u2.length. The third call for u3 computes (3-2) + u3.length = 1 + u3.length. \n\nThe minimal of these three would be the minimal between 3+u1, 2+u2, 1+u3. \n\nBut the correct minimal should be the minimal of 3+u1, 3+u2, 3+u3. \n\nBecause for each outgoing edge, the number of days to block is (k-1), which is 3-1=2 for each edge. \n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nThis suggests that the code's computeScore function is flawed. \n\nBut given that we have to fill in the missing code, not correct the code's logic, perhaps we need to proceed. \n\nThe missing code is in the if statement. \n\nThe code is trying to add w to the queue if computeScore has updated its length. \n\nBut how to track that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that after computeScore, the w's length is equal to the candidate value (notComplete + u.length +1). \n\nBut that's not possible to check. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should always add w to the queue after computeScore. \n\nBut then the condition is always true. \n\nSo, the missing code is 'true' as the condition. \n\nBut why would the code have a condition there? \n\nThe code is using a priority queue, and the condition may be to avoid adding duplicate entries. \n\nBut according to the code's structure, the condition is needed to prevent adding w to the queue when it's not necessary. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is that w is not yet complete. \n\nBut in the computeScore function, the first line is 'if (complete) return;'. So, if w is complete, computeScore returns early. \n\nThus, in the loop, for each w in u.in, the code checks if w is complete. \n\nBut the code's if condition is before calling computeScore. \n\nSo, perhaps the missing condition is '!w.complete'. \n\nThus, the code checks if w is not complete, and only then processes it. \n\nThat would make sense. Because if w is already processed (complete), there's no need to process it again. \n\nSo, the missing condition is '!w.complete'. \n\nBut wait, in the code's computeScore function, the first line is 'if (complete) return;'. So, if w is complete, computeScore returns early. \n\nThus, in the for loop, if w is complete, computeScore would do nothing, and adding it to the queue would be unnecessary. \n\nThus, the condition should be '!w.complete'. \n\nThus, the code would only call computeScore for w if w is not complete. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nThus, the missing code is '!w.complete'. \n\nTesting this scenario: \n\nWhen processing a u, for each w in u.in (original outgoing edges), if w is not yet processed (complete is false), then computeScore is called, and w is added to the queue. \n\nThis would ensure that each w is processed only once, when it's popped from the queue and marked as complete. \n\nBut wait, no. Because a node w can be added to the queue multiple times with different lengths. But once it's marked as complete, any further additions to the queue are ignored. \n\nBut the condition '!w.complete' ensures that computeScore is called only for nodes that are not yet processed. \n\nBut computeScore may still update the length even if the node is not complete. \n\nThus, the condition is correct. \n\nSo, the missing code is '!w.complete'. \n\nBut wait, let's see: \n\nThe code's for loop is:\n\nfor(Vertex w : u.in) {\n    if(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n        w.computeScore(u);\n        queue.add(new VertexScore(w, w.length));\n    }\n}\n\nThe computeScore function for w checks if w is complete, and returns early. \n\nThus, even if w is not complete, computeScore may do nothing. \n\nBut if w is not complete, computeScore will proceed. \n\nBut why have the condition here? \n\nBecause if w is complete, there's no need to process it. \n\nThus, the condition is '!w.complete'. \n\nThus, the missing code is '!w.complete'. \n\nThus, the correct answer is to fill the missing condition with '!w.complete'."
