The solution is to perform one operation on path 1\u21922 with c = [1,2]. So, sum[2] starts as 0. When processing node 2 (since it's a leaf), sum[2] is 0. Then, the condition would check if 0 < low[2] (which is 2). So, we need to add an operation here. The sum[parent[2]] (which is 1) gets high[2] (2) added. Then, when processing node 1, sum[1] would have 2 added. Then check if sum[1] >= low[1] (1), which it is, so no new operation needed. Wait, but sum[1] is 2, which is higher than high[1] (1).",

We need to add an operation here, because 0 < l[3] (7). So, add an operation, which contributes 7 to node 3. But since the path is 1\u21923, the c array must be non-decreasing. So, the parent (node 1) would have a c value of 2 (since 2 \u22647). So, the sum[parent[3]] (node 1) would get 7 added. But node 1's a is already 3 from the first operation, and now adding 2 more (from the second operation's c1=2) would make it 5, which is within the l and r (3 and 5). So sum for node 3 would be 7, which is added to the parent (node 1) as 7. But how does the code model this?",

But each such operation contributes to j's children and j (since the path includes j's children's paths). Wait, no. Each child of j's path would include j, because the path is from root to the child. So, the sum[j] represents the maximum possible contributions that can be passed up from the children to j. Because each operation applied to a child's path (including j) would have c_j <= c_child. But in the code's processing, when processing a child, the contribution to the parent (j) is either high[child] (if a new operation was added for the child) or min(sum[child], high[child]). Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to model the code's approach step by step. The code processes nodes in reverse order (from n down to 1). For each node j, it checks whether sum[j] is sufficient to meet the lower bound. sum[j] is the sum of contributions from j's children. Because each operation that affects a child of j will have j in its path, so the c_i for j in such operations is <= the c_i for the child. But in the code, sum[j] is built by adding the contributions from each child: when processing a child, if the child's sum is insufficient (sum[child] < l[child]), then the parent (j) gets high[child] added to sum[j]. Otherwise, it adds min(sum[child], high[child]). So, sum[j] is the total of the maximum possible contributions from each child.",

Putting this all together, the missing condition in the code is checking whether sum[j] is less than low[j]. So the code should look like:\n\nif (sum[j] < low[j]) {\n    ++ans;\n    sum[parent[j]] += high[j];\n} else {\n    sum[parent[j]] += min(sum[j], high[j]);\n} So, the TODO part is to check if sum[j] is less than low[j]. Therefore, the missing code is the condition sum[j] < low[j], so the code should be:\n\nif (sum.at(j) < low.at(j)) So, the correct code fills in that condition.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the problem is about a rooted tree where each node has a value that starts at 0. We need to perform operations to make each node's value lie within its [l_v, r_v] range. The operations are a bit tricky: each operation involves selecting a path from the root to a node v, then choosing a non-decreasing array c, and adding each c_i to the nodes along the path. The goal is to find the minimum number of such operations required.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the constraints here. The key is that each operation's c array is non-decreasing. That means when you apply an operation, the increments along the path must not decrease as you go down the path from root to v. For example, if the path is 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3, then c1 \u2264 c2 \u2264 c3.\n\nSo, each operation can be thought of as adding a certain non-decreasing sequence to a path. Our task is to cover the required ranges for each node with as few operations as possible.\n\nThe approach here might involve considering the nodes in a bottom-up manner. Because each node's required increments can affect its ancestors through the operations. Wait, the sum of the increments from the operations must meet the node's l and r constraints. But how do the operations' contributions add up?\n\nWait, each node's a_v is the sum of all the c_i's from the operations that include it in their path. But each c_i in an operation is part of a non-decreasing array along the path. So for node v, which is part of the path from root to some node u (which is a descendant of v), each such operation contributes some value to a_v. But the c values along the path must be non-decreasing. So, when considering the contributions to the nodes along a path, the earlier nodes (closer to root) get values \u2264 the ones further down.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model the required increments. Let's think: for each node, the minimum and maximum possible increments it can have based on the operations applied to it and its descendants.\n\nWait, the solution code provided has a for loop that iterates from n down to 1. For each node j, it checks a condition (the TODO part), and based on that, increments the answer and adds to the parent's sum. Otherwise, it adds the minimum of sum[j] and high[j] to the parent's sum.\n\nSo the key seems to be in how the sum variable is managed. The sum array probably represents some kind of available capacity or contribution that can be passed up to the parent.\n\nLet me try to parse the code structure. The loop starts from the leaves (processing nodes in reverse order, starting from n down to 1). For each node j, if some condition is met, we increment the answer (so this is a new operation), and add high[j] to the parent's sum. Otherwise, we add the minimum of sum[j] and high[j] to the parent's sum.\n\nThe sum array is likely tracking the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to the parent nodes. Because each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to the parent (which is earlier in the path) can't exceed the contribution to the child. So, when processing a child, the maximum contribution that can be made to the parent is limited by the sum[j] (from the children of j) and the high[j] (the maximum allowed for j).\n\nSo, the condition to check is whether the sum of contributions from the children plus the required minimum for j is more than the maximum allowed. Wait, maybe not. Let's think: for node j, during each operation that affects it, the c_i for j's position in the path must be >= the c_i's of all previous nodes (since the array is non-decreasing). Therefore, the maximum possible contribution to j's parent is constrained by the contributions to j and its descendants.\n\nWait, maybe the sum[j] represents the total possible contribution that can be passed up from node j to its parent. When processing j, if the accumulated sum from its children (sum[j]) is less than the low[j], then we need to perform an additional operation here. Because even the maximum possible contributions from the children (sum[j]) aren't enough to meet the minimum required for j. But how?\n\nAlternatively, when the sum of the contributions from the children (sum[j]) is less than the lower bound l[j], then we have to add an operation that directly contributes to j and all its ancestors. But since the c array must be non-decreasing, the value added to j's parent can't be more than the value added to j. So, in such a case, the operation's c for the parent node would be at least the l[j] - sum[j], but since it's a new operation, the c array could be set such that the parent's contribution is <= the child's. Wait, but how do we model this?\n\nLet me think of the example given. For the first test case, node 1's l is 1 and r is 1, node 2's l is 2 and r is 2. The solution is to perform one operation on path 1\u21922 with c = [1,2]. So, sum[2] starts as 0. When processing node 2 (since it's a leaf), sum[2] is 0. Then, the condition would check if 0 < low[2] (which is 2). So, we need to add an operation here. The sum[parent[2]] (which is 1) gets high[2] (2) added. Then, when processing node 1, sum[1] would have 2 added. Then check if sum[1] >= low[1] (1), which it is, so no new operation needed.\n\nWait, but sum[1] is 2, which is higher than high[1] (1). Oh, but maybe the sum represents the maximum possible contribution that can be applied to the node. But how are the actual constraints (l and r) being enforced here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe sum[j] represents the maximum possible accumulated value that can be contributed to node j from the operations applied to its descendants. If sum[j] is less than l[j], then we need to perform an operation that directly targets this node (or some ancestor) to cover the deficit. But how?\n\nAnother example: in the second test case. After the first operation (on node 2 with c=[3,3]), node 1's a is 3, node 2's a is 3. Then, when processing node 3, sum[3] is 0. We need to add an operation here, because 0 < l[3] (7). So, add an operation, which contributes 7 to node 3. But since the path is 1\u21923, the c array must be non-decreasing. So, the parent (node 1) would have a c value of 2 (since 2 \u22647). So, the sum[parent[3]] (node 1) would get 7 added. But node 1's a is already 3 from the first operation, and now adding 2 more (from the second operation's c1=2) would make it 5, which is within the l and r (3 and 5). So sum for node 3 would be 7, which is added to the parent (node 1) as 7. But how does the code model this?\n\nIn the code's processing loop:\n\nFor node j (say node 3 in the second example), during processing, the sum[j] is the sum from its children. Since node 3 has no children (leaf), sum[j] is 0. The condition would check if sum[j] < low[j]. So 0 < 7, which is true. So we increment ans by 1, and add high[j] (7) to parent's sum. Then, when processing the parent (node 1), sum[j] (sum[1]?) is being accumulated.\n\nWait, the code's sum array is for the parent. So for each node j, when processing it, we either add high[j] to parent's sum (if we had to perform an operation here) or add the minimum between sum[j] and high[j] to the parent's sum. So sum[parent[j]] is the sum of contributions from the children.\n\nSo, the sum[j] represents the maximum possible cumulative contribution that can be passed up from node j to its parent. Because the parent's contribution in an operation must be <= the child's contribution (due to non-decreasing c array), the maximum the parent can get from the child's operations is the minimum between the sum[j] (which is the total from the child's operations) and high[j] (since the child's a_v can't exceed r_v).\n\nBut if the sum of contributions from the children (sum[j]) is less than the lower bound l[j], then even if we take all possible contributions from the children (sum[j]), the a_v would be sum[j], which is below l[j]. Therefore, we need to perform an additional operation here. But since we can't use the children's contributions to meet l[j], we have to add a new operation. In this case, the new operation's contribution to this node must be at least (l[j] - sum[j]). But since the operation's c array is non-decreasing, the parent's contribution (c_i for the parent) would be <= the contribution to this node. However, the maximum possible contribution we can add for this node in the new operation is high[j], but we need to cover the deficit (l[j] - sum[j]). Wait, but maybe the code's approach is to assume that the new operation's contribution to the node is exactly high[j], which is the maximum allowed. Because adding a higher value would exceed r[j], but the problem requires a_v to be <= r[j]. But wait, maybe the code's logic is that when a new operation is needed, we take the maximum possible (high[j]) to cover as much as possible, thus minimizing the number of operations.\n\nSo, in the case where sum[j] < l[j], we must add an operation. The contribution to j in this operation must be at least (l[j] - sum[j]). However, we can choose any c value between (l[j] - sum[j]) and (r[j] - sum[j]) to reach the required a_v. But the code's approach is to take the maximum possible, which is high[j], because this allows the parent to have a larger sum (since the parent can take up to high[j] from this node's operation). Wait, but in the code, when we add a new operation, sum[parent[j]] += high[j]. So in this case, the parent's sum is increased by high[j], which is the maximum possible contribution from this operation. This implies that when a new operation is added for node j, the contribution to the parent is high[j], which is the maximum possible. Because in the operation's c array, the parent's c_i can be up to c_j (since it's non-decreasing). So, by setting c_j to high[j], we can set c_i for the parent to be as high as possible, which helps cover their l values. Thus, taking the maximum possible (high[j]) for the parent's sum is optimal.\n\nSo the condition in the code is: if the sum of contributions from the children (sum[j]) is less than the lower bound (low[j]), then we need to add a new operation. Because sum[j] is the maximum possible contribution from the children, but it's not enough. So we have to perform a new operation here, which contributes to this node and all ancestors. The contribution to this node in this operation must be at least (low[j] - sum[j]). But since we can contribute up to (high[j] - sum[j]) (to avoid exceeding r[j]), the code chooses to take the maximum possible (high[j]) here. Because adding the maximum possible allows the parent to have more contributions, which might reduce the number of operations needed higher up.\n\nSo the condition in the code should be checking if sum[j] (the sum of contributions from children) is less than the node's lower bound (low[j]). If so, we need to add an operation. Otherwise, we can use the sum[j] (but not exceed high[j], so we take min(sum[j], high[j])).\n\nWait, but the code's sum[j] is the sum of contributions from the children, which is the sum of the contributions from the operations that pass through j's children. But each such operation contributes to j's children and j (since the path includes j's children's paths). Wait, no. Each child of j's path would include j, because the path is from root to the child. So, the sum[j] represents the maximum possible contributions that can be passed up from the children to j. Because each operation applied to a child's path (including j) would have c_j <= c_child. But in the code's processing, when processing a child, the contribution to the parent (j) is either high[child] (if a new operation was added for the child) or min(sum[child], high[child]).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to model the code's approach step by step.\n\nThe code processes nodes in reverse order (from n down to 1). For each node j, it checks whether sum[j] is sufficient to meet the lower bound. sum[j] is the sum of contributions from j's children. Because each operation that affects a child of j will have j in its path, so the c_i for j in such operations is <= the c_i for the child. But in the code, sum[j] is built by adding the contributions from each child: when processing a child, if the child's sum is insufficient (sum[child] < l[child]), then the parent (j) gets high[child] added to sum[j]. Otherwise, it adds min(sum[child], high[child]).\n\nSo, sum[j] is the total of the maximum possible contributions from each child. Each contribution from a child is either high[child] (if a new operation was needed for the child) or min(sum[child], high[child]) (if no new operation was needed for the child). So, sum[j] represents the maximum possible total contribution that j can receive from its children's operations. But j's own l[j] and r[j] must be considered.\n\nIf the sum of contributions (sum[j]) is less than l[j], then j's value a[j] would be sum[j] (from children's operations) plus any contributions from operations that target j's path. But sum[j] is the sum of the children's contributions, which are passed up to j. So, if sum[j] < l[j], then we need to perform additional operations that target j (or a descendant) to add enough to reach at least l[j].\n\nWait, perhaps sum[j] is the total contributions that can be applied to j from operations on its descendants. But in that case, a[j] would be sum[j] plus any contributions from operations targeting j or higher nodes. Hmm, maybe not. The code's approach seems to model sum[j] as the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to j from its children. So, when processing j, sum[j] is the sum of the contributions from all children. Then, j's own required contribution is determined by comparing sum[j] to l[j] and r[j].\n\nSo, if sum[j] < l[j], then even the maximum possible contributions from the children (sum[j]) are not enough to reach the lower bound. Therefore, we must perform new operations that directly target j (or a node higher up in the path) to make up the difference. But since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to j in such an operation can be as high as needed, but the maximum possible is r[j] - sum[j], to avoid exceeding r[j]. However, the code's approach is to take the maximum possible (high[j]) for the parent's sum. This is because when you add an operation here, the contribution to j is high[j], and the parent (which is part of the path) can get up to high[j] as well. So by adding high[j] to the parent's sum, you are allowing the parent to have more contributions, which might reduce the number of operations needed higher up.\n\nSo, the condition in the code should be: if the sum[j] (sum of contributions from children) is less than the lower bound l[j], then add a new operation. The code increments ans and adds high[j] to the parent's sum. Otherwise, the code adds the minimum of sum[j] and high[j] to the parent's sum.\n\nWait, but sum[j] is the sum of contributions from children. So, when sum[j] >= l[j], then a[j] will be sum[j] plus any contributions from operations that include j in their path. But wait, the code's sum array is for the parent, so sum[j] is the sum of contributions that are passed up to j from its children. Then, when processing j, the code decides whether to add an operation here (if the sum is insufficient) and then passes the appropriate amount up to the parent.\n\nSo, the correct condition for the code is: if sum[j] < low[j], then we need to perform an operation here, and add high[j] to the parent's sum. Because the sum from children is not enough, so the required contribution must be added via an operation on j's path. The maximum possible contribution for j in this operation is high[j], so adding high[j] to the parent's sum (since the parent's contribution in this operation can be up to high[j]).\n\nIf sum[j] >= low[j], then we can use the contributions from the children. But the actual contribution to j is sum[j], but since a[j] can't exceed high[j], we take min(sum[j], high[j]) and pass that up to the parent. Because the parent's contribution in the operations can't be more than the child's, so the maximum contribution passed up is min(sum[j], high[j]).\n\nPutting this all together, the missing condition in the code is checking whether sum[j] is less than low[j]. So the code should look like:\n\nif (sum[j] < low[j]) {\n    ++ans;\n    sum[parent[j]] += high[j];\n} else {\n    sum[parent[j]] += min(sum[j], high[j]);\n}\n\nSo, the TODO part is to check if sum[j] is less than low[j].\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the condition sum[j] < low[j], so the code should be:\n\nif (sum.at(j) < low.at(j))\n\nSo, the correct code fills in that condition."
