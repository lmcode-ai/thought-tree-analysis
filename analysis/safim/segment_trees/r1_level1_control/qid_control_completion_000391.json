Except for the starting and ending position. This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to model the conditions. Let's think of the prefix sums. Let's process the array from left to right and keep track of some constraints. For the first element a_1: since you can't move left from position 1, any left steps from position 1 are impossible. So L_1 = 0, and R_1 = a_1. So a_1 must be non-negative. But how about after that? For each position i >=2, the number of left steps from i can't exceed the number of right steps from i. Because each left step from i must be preceded by a right step to i (from i-1). Wait, perhaps not.",

This suggests that for each position i >=2, the number of times you can move left from i is determined by the number of times you've moved right from i-1 and then i. Hmm, perhaps not. This is getting complicated. Alternatively, considering that the process must form a path that starts and ends at 1. Let's model the path as a sequence of steps. Each time you move right, you increment the current position and add 1 to the current element. Each time you move left, you decrement the current position and subtract 1 from the current element.

But since R = L (total right steps equals total left steps), this sum is (sum R_i) - (sum L_i). But sum R_i is the total right steps (since each R_i is a step from i to i+1), and sum L_i is the total left steps (each L_i is a step from i to i-1). Since the pointer ends at 1, the total steps right minus steps left must be zero. Because each right step is +1 to displacement, left is -1. So total displacement is R_total - L_total = 0. Therefore, R_total = L_total. So sum R_i = sum L_i. So sum (R_i - L_i) = sum a_i = 0.",

But since i <n, the only way to proceed is to move right again, which would require the prefix sum to be positive again. But if the sum is zero, then any further steps would require that the sum becomes negative, which is invalid. So the conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum of the array is zero. 2. For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. The prefix sum up to i must be >=0.\n\n   b. If the prefix sum up to i is zero, then all elements from i+1 to n must be zero. 3. The first element a_1 must be >=0. Because you can't move left from position 1. So a_1 is the number of right steps from position 1 minus left steps from position 1 (which must be zero), so a_1 must be >=0. Wait, but in the sample input, the second test case has a_1 =2 which is >=0. The sum is zero. The prefix sums are:\n\ns1 =2.\n\ns2 =2 + (-1) =1.\n\ns3=1 + (-1)=0. At i=3, which is less than n=4. So according to condition 2b, all elements after i=3 must be zero. But in the sample input, a_4 is zero. So that's allowed. So the condition holds. So the sample input would be allowed. Another example: Let's say n=3, a=[1,-1,0]. Sum is 0. Prefix sums are 1, 0, 0. Here, at i=2, the prefix sum is zero. So all elements after i=2 must be zero. But a_3 is 0. So this array would be allowed. But wait, according to the problem's note, the sample input's second test case has a_3=-1. How does that fit? Wait, the sample input's second test case is [2,-1,-1,0]. The sum is zero. The prefix sums are 2,1,0,0. So at i=3 (n=4), the prefix sum is zero. According to condition 2b, all elements after i=3 must be zero. Which they are (a_4 is 0). So it's allowed. But if there's an array like [1, -1, 1, -1], sum is zero. The prefix sums are 1,0,1,0. At i=2, the sum is zero, but then a_3 is 1. So according to condition 2b, after i=2, all elements must be zero. But a_3 is 1. So this array would be invalid. So the algorithm would be:\n\nCheck that the total sum is zero. Check that the first element is non-negative. Check that all prefix sums are >=0. Check that once a prefix sum becomes zero (for i <n), all remaining elements are zero. If all these conditions are met, then output Yes; else No. So now, let's think about the code provided. The code is in C++. The code reads t test cases. For each case, reads n and the array. Then, during processing the array elements, it's accumulating sum, and checking some conditions. In the code, after reading each element a, it adds to sum. Then:\n\nif sum <0: is_ok=0. Else if flag <=0 and sum ==0: flag=1. Else if (missing condition) then is_ok=0. The code then checks if is_ok and sum ==0, output yes. So the code is trying to capture the conditions. Let's see:\n\nThe sum must be zero at the end. The flag is set to 1 when sum becomes zero. So the flag is 1 once the sum reaches zero. So during the loop:\n\nFor each a_i:\n\nsum += a_i. If sum <0: invalid. Else if flag is 0 and sum ==0: set flag=1. Else if (some condition): invalid. The code's logic is that once the sum reaches zero (flag is set), then all remaining elements must be zero.",

So the code's missing condition is:\n\nif (flag has been set and the current sum is not zero) \u2192 invalid. But how to check that. Alternatively, once flag is set, any a_i must be zero. Because sum was zero before adding a_i. So sum +=a_i \u2192 sum =a_i. So a_i must be zero. So the code can check if flag is set and a_i is not zero. But in the code, after adding a_i to sum, sum is now a_i. So a_i = sum. So if flag is set and sum is not zero, then a_i is not zero. So the code can check if flag is set and sum ! =0. So the missing condition in the else if is:\n\nflag > 0 && sum ! =0\n\nBecause:\n\n- flag is 1 (set). - sum is now a_i (since previous sum was zero, sum +=a_i is a_i). - if sum ! =0 \u2192 a_i ! =0 \u2192 invalid. So the missing code is:\n\n(flag > 0 && sum ! = 0) So the code should have:\n\nelse if (flag >0 && sum ! =0) \u2192 is_ok =0. That's the condition that the code is missing. Let me check this against the example I had before: [1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1]. Processing the elements:\n\ni=0, a=1 \u2192 sum=1. flag is 0. sum >=0. sum ! =0. So no condition met.\n\ni=1, a=-1 \u2192 sum=0. flag is 0 \u2192 set flag=1.\n\ni=2, a=0 \u2192 sum=0. flag is 1. sum is 0. So code checks else if (flag>0 && sum ! =0) \u2192 no. So no problem. i=3, a=0 \u2192 sum=0. Same as above.\n\ni=4, a=1 \u2192 sum=1. flag is 1. sum ! =0. So code enters else if (flag>0 && sum !=0) \u2192 is_ok=0. So this element would invalidate the array, which is correct. So in this case, the code correctly marks it as invalid. Another example: sample input's second test case. array [2, -1, -1, 0]. sum=0. Processing:\n\ni=0 (a=2): sum=2. flag is 0. sum >=0. sum ! =0. No action.\n\ni=1 (a=-1): sum=1. flag 0, sum not zero. No action. i=2 (a=-1): sum=0. flag is 0 \u2192 set flag=1.\n\ni=3 (a=0): sum=0. flag is 1. sum is 0. So code's else if condition is false. No problem. So code allows this case. Another test case: [0,0,0,0]. sum=0. But according to the note, this case is invalid because the pointer isn't back to position 1. Let's see. In code:\n\nsum is 0 at the first element (a_1=0). flag is set to 1. Then the next elements are 0,0,0. sum remains zero. So code's else if condition is not triggered. sum is zero. But the code checks if (is_ok and sum ==0). So output is Yes. But according to the note, this array is possible but the pointer isn't back to the first element. So why is the code outputting Yes? Because the code's logic may not be correct. Wait, what's wrong here. The array [0,0,0,0] would have sum zero. According to the code's logic:\n\na_1=0 \u2192 sum=0. flag set to 1. a_2=0 \u2192 sum=0. flag is 1. sum ==0 \u2192 code's else if condition (flag>0 && sum ! =0) is false. So is_ok remains 1. Similarly for a_3=0 and a_4=0.",

So even though the array can be formed, the final position is not the first element, so the answer is no. But according to the code's logic, the conditions would allow it. So the code's logic is missing a check. Ah, right. So the code's current logic doesn't check that the first element is non-negative. Because a_1 is the number of right steps from position 1 minus left steps from position 1 (which are zero). So a_1 must be >=0. So in the example where a_1 is zero, it's allowed. But in the problem's first test case, the array is [0,0,0,0], but the pointer isn't on the first element. So how can that happen? Because the code's logic is missing a check for a_1 >=0. So the code needs to also check that a_1 is >=0. But in the code, how is this checked? In the current code, the first element is read into a variable 'a' and added to sum. sum is then checked.",

So this is valid and should output yes. But if there's a sequence of steps that ends at a different position but results in all zeros, then it's invalid. Wait, but if the array is all zeros, the only way to form it is by not moving. Because any movement would require changing the array. For example, moving right once from position 1 to 2 would set a_1=1, which is not zero. So the only way to have a_1=0 is to have no right steps from position 1. But then the pointer must be at position 1. So in this case, the code's logic would output yes, which is correct. But the problem's note says that in the first test case, the array is [0,0,0,0], and the answer is no. But according to this reasoning, the code's logic would output yes. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's note.",

But according to the problem's note, the first test case is possible but the pointer isn't on the first element. So why would that be? Because the problem's first test case's array is formed with steps that end elsewhere. So there's a contradiction. How can the array be all zeros but the pointer isn't at 1? Because all steps would have to be balanced. For example, moving right once and then left once would result in a_1 =1 (from the right step), a_2 =-1 (from the left step), which is not zeros. So it's impossible to have the array all zeros unless no steps are taken.",

So the pointer is at 1, which is correct. So the answer should be yes. But the note says that the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't on the first element. So perhaps the first test case's array is not all zeros. For example, maybe it's [0, 0, 0, 0], but the pointer is not at 1. But how is that possible? I think there's a misunderstanding here. The code's current logic is missing the check that the first element is non-negative. Because in the code's logic, a_1 can be zero. But according to the problem's rules, a_1 can be zero. Wait, the first element a_1 is the number of right steps from position 1. Since you can't move left from position 1, L_1=0. So a_1 = R_1. So a_1 must be >=0. But the code's current logic checks that the sum is non-negative. For the first element, sum =a_1. So the first element is allowed to be zero (sum=0), which is correct. But according to the problem's note, the first test case's array is possible but the pointer is not on the first element. So perhaps the first test case's array is possible to form via some steps, but the pointer isn't at 1. Hence, the code's logic must check that the pointer is at 1. But how to model that in terms of the array's conditions. Another condition: the array must not have any non-zero elements after the prefix sum first becomes zero.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what code to add here. Let's look at the problem again. The task is to determine if a given array can be obtained through the specified operations. The key points are the operations and the constraints. \n\nThe operations are: you can move forward, increasing the current element by 1 each time before moving, or move backward, decreasing the current element by 1 each time before moving. But after all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what these operations imply. Let's model the process.\n\nSuppose we have the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The operations affect the elements as follows. Each time you move right (from position i to i+1), you add 1 to a_i. When you move left (from position i to i-1), you subtract 1 from a_i. But the pointer must end up at the first element. So, the total number of left and right moves must balance such that the pointer returns to the start.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to model the cumulative sum here. Let's think about the process step by step. Starting at position 1. Each right move increments the current position and moves right. Each left move decrements the current position and moves left. But every time you move right, you add 1 to the current element before moving. So, each right step from position i to i+1 adds 1 to a_i. Each left step from position i to i-1 subtracts 1 from a_i. The final position must be 1.\n\nSo, the array a is the result of all these increments and decrements. How can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think about the necessary conditions that the array a must satisfy for it to be possible.\n\nFirst, the pointer starts at position 1 and ends there. So, the path taken must return to the start. That implies that every right move must eventually be matched by a left move except for the ones that form a path that allows the pointer to end at the first element. Wait, maybe that's complicated. Let's think differently.\n\nLet's model the process as a sequence of steps. Each right move adds 1 to the current position and moves right. Each left move subtracts 1 from the current position and moves left. The final position is 1.\n\nBut how does this translate into the array a? The array a is the sum of all the increments and decrements made during the process. For example, each time you are at position i and move right, you add 1 to a_i. Each time you move left from position i, you subtract 1 from a_i. So the final a_i is the number of times you moved right from i minus the number of times you moved left from i.\n\nBut the pointer must end at position 1. So the total number of right moves minus left moves must be such that the pointer ends up at 1. Let's see: every right move increases the position by 1, left move decreases by 1. So the sum of (right moves - left moves) must equal 0 (since starting and ending at position 1). Wait, no. Because the initial position is 1, and after each right move, position increases by 1. Each left move decreases it by 1. The total displacement must be zero. So the total number of right steps minus left steps equals zero. So right steps = left steps. But that's not necessarily true. For example, if you move right once and then left once, you end up back. Or if you have a sequence of right and left steps that brings you back.\n\nWait, maybe the sequence can be more complex. For example, moving right three times (positions 1\u21922\u21923\u21924), then left three times (4\u21923\u21922\u21921). So total displacement is zero. Right steps =3, left steps=3. So the sum of (right - left) steps is 0.\n\nAlternatively, you can have a path that's like right, right, left, right, left, left. The total displacement is 0. So right steps minus left steps is 3-3=0. So yes, the total number of right steps must equal the left steps. Because each right step is +1, left is -1. Sum must be 0.\n\nSo total right steps = total left steps. Let's call this R = L.\n\nNow, each right step from position i contributes +1 to a_i. Each left step from position i contributes -1 to a_i. So a_i = (number of right steps from i) - (number of left steps from i). \n\nBut how can we model the a array?\n\nLet's think of the process as a path. The pointer starts at 1, and ends at 1. The path can be represented as a sequence of positions: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1, etc. Each time you step right, you leave a +1 in the previous position. Each time you step left, you leave a -1 in the current position before moving.\n\nWait, no. When moving right, the current position is i. You add 1 to a_i, then move to i+1. When moving left, the current position is i. You subtract 1 from a_i, then move to i-1. So for example, moving from i to i+1 (right), a_i increases by 1. Moving from i to i-1 (left), a_i decreases by 1. So the a array is the sum of all these steps.\n\nBut how do these steps relate to the a_i's?\n\nLet's model the a_i's in terms of the steps taken. Let's denote R_i as the number of times you moved right from position i, and L_i as the number of times you moved left from position i. Then:\n\na_i = R_i - L_i for each i from 1 to n.\n\nBut the pointer's movement is determined by the steps. For example, moving right from i increases the position to i+1. Moving left from i decreases the position to i-1. The path starts and ends at 1. So the steps must form a valid path that starts and ends at position 1.\n\nNow, let's think about the constraints on R_i and L_i.\n\nFirst, the path must start at 1 and end at 1. So the movement must form a valid path. For example, you can't have more left steps than right steps at any point. Because when you are at position 1, you can't move left. So for all i, the number of right steps from positions 1 to i-1 must be greater than or equal to the number of left steps from positions 2 to i. Otherwise, you would have tried to move left from position i when there's no previous right steps to allow that.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to model the movement as a sequence. The path can be thought of as a series of steps that form a walk starting and ending at position 1, never moving left from position 1, etc. But this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, considering the constraints for the a array. Let's think of the conditions that a must satisfy for it to be possible.\n\nFirst, the pointer must start at 1 and end at 1. So all steps must form a path that returns to 1. Let's model the cumulative steps. Let's consider the process of building the array. For each position i, the number of times you can move left from i is limited by the number of times you have entered i from the right. Because to move left from i, you must have arrived there via a right step from i-1. \n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: during the process, whenever you are at position i, you can only move right if i < n, and left if i > 1. But after all steps, the pointer is at 1. \n\nBut how to translate this into conditions on the a array.\n\nAnother approach: Let's process the array from left to right. Let's consider the prefix sums. \n\nSuppose we process the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. Let's think of the process of moving right and left. The key observation is that the pointer can never be to the left of position 1. So the path must not go left of 1. Also, when moving, the steps are such that for the array to be possible, certain conditions must hold.\n\nLet's consider the cumulative effect. For example, the first element a_1 is equal to the number of right steps from position 1 minus the number of left steps from position 1. But each left step from position 1 is impossible, because you can't move left from position 1. So L_1 must be zero. Therefore, a_1 = R_1. Since R_1 is the number of times we moved right from position 1. Which implies that a_1 must be >= 0. Wait, but in the sample input, the first test case is [0,0,0,0], which outputs \"No\". Wait, in the note, it says that the first test case is possible, but the pointer is not on the first element. Wait, but the problem states that after all operations, the pointer must be on the first element. So the sample input's first case would have an array [0,0,0,0], but the pointer is not on the first element. Hence, that case would return \"No\". Wait, but the note says that in the first test case, the array can be obtained but the pointer is not on the first element. So the answer is \"No\".\n\nHmm. So the key is that even if the array can be formed by some operations, if the pointer isn't on the first element after all operations, then it's invalid. So the conditions must ensure that after all operations, the pointer is on the first element. \n\nSo the problem is to check both that the array can be formed by some operations and that the final position is 1.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach comes from thinking of the process as a series of steps where each right move increases a_i by 1 and moves the pointer to i+1. Each left move decreases a_i by 1 and moves to i-1. The pointer starts at 1 and ends at 1.\n\nThe problem is to determine if there exists a sequence of such operations that results in the array a and ends with the pointer at 1.\n\nSo, let's model the process step by step. Let's think of the process as a sequence of steps. The pointer starts at 1. Each step is either right or left (if possible). After each step, the array is modified. The sum of all right steps minus left steps must be such that the pointer ends at 1.\n\nBut how can we model this without considering the entire sequence? Maybe there's a way to find constraints on the array a that must hold for this to be possible.\n\nLet's think of the process in terms of the path taken. The path is a sequence of positions starting and ending at 1. Each time you move right from position i, a_i increases by 1 and you go to i+1. Each time you move left from position i, a_i decreases by 1 and you go to i-1. \n\nThe path can be considered as a series of steps, forming a walk that starts and ends at 1, with each step moving either right (if possible) or left (if possible). The array a is the sum of all the increments and decrements done during the process.\n\nSo for the array to be possible, the a array must be the net result of these steps, and the path must end at 1.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's consider the following:\n\nEach time you leave a position (except when you end there), you must have entered it via a right step (except for the first position). Because, for example, to move left from position i, you must have entered i from a right step (i-1 \u2192 i). So, during the process, the number of times you can leave a position to the left is equal to the number of times you entered it from the right minus the number of times you left via the right. Wait, this might not be the right way to model it.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i (except the first and last), the number of times you entered from the left (i-1 \u2192 i) minus the number of times you exited to the left (i \u2192 i-1) must equal the number of times you entered from the right (i+1 \u2192 i) minus the number of times you exited to the right (i \u2192 i+1). But this might get complicated.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the movement as a series of passes. For each i from 1 to n, the pointer can move to i, and possibly make some right and left moves from there. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the a array as the net right moves minus left moves for each position. For a_1, since you can't move left from position 1, all left moves from position 1 are zero. So a_1 must equal the number of right moves from 1. So a_1 must be >=0.\n\nBut wait, when you move right from 1, you add 1 to a_1 and move to 2. Then, to return to 1, you must move left from 2. That subtracts 1 from a_2. So a_2's value is R_2 - L_2. But R_2 is the number of times you moved right from 2, and L_2 the number of times you moved left from 2.\n\nBut the process must end at position 1. So after all steps, the pointer is back to 1. Which implies that the last step must have been a left step from position 2. So the total number of right steps from 1 must be equal to the total number of left steps from 2 plus 1? No, perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path as a sequence that starts and ends at 1. So for each position i, the number of times you entered i from the left (i-1 \u2192 i) must equal the number of times you exited i to the right (i \u2192 i+1) plus the number of times you exited i to the left (i \u2192 i-1). Except for the starting and ending position.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to model the conditions.\n\nLet's think of the prefix sums. Let's process the array from left to right and keep track of some constraints.\n\nFor the first element a_1: since you can't move left from position 1, any left steps from position 1 are impossible. So L_1 = 0, and R_1 = a_1. So a_1 must be non-negative.\n\nBut how about after that? For each position i >=2, the number of left steps from i can't exceed the number of right steps from i. Because each left step from i must be preceded by a right step to i (from i-1). Wait, perhaps not. For example, after moving to i via a left step from i+1, then you can move left again. But that's not possible because moving left from i+1 requires that you were there via a right step from i. So to reach i via a left step from i+1, you must have first moved right to i+1 from i. \n\nThis suggests that for each position i >=2, the number of times you can move left from i is determined by the number of times you've moved right from i-1 and then i. Hmm, perhaps not. This is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the process must form a path that starts and ends at 1. Let's model the path as a sequence of steps. Each time you move right, you increment the current position and add 1 to the current element. Each time you move left, you decrement the current position and subtract 1 from the current element. The process must end at position 1.\n\nNow, during this path, for the array to be valid, certain conditions must hold. Let's consider the cumulative sum of a_i's.\n\nWait, here's an important insight: the sum of all a_i's must be zero. Because each right move adds 1 to the current element, and each left move subtracts 1. So for each step (right or left), the net contribution is +1 (right) or -1 (left). But since the total number of right and left steps must be equal (since the pointer returns to 1), the sum of all a_i's is (R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n) - (L_1 + L_2 + ... + L_n). But since R = L (total right steps equals total left steps), this sum is (sum R_i) - (sum L_i). But sum R_i is the total right steps (since each R_i is a step from i to i+1), and sum L_i is the total left steps (each L_i is a step from i to i-1). Since the pointer ends at 1, the total steps right minus steps left must be zero. Because each right step is +1 to displacement, left is -1. So total displacement is R_total - L_total = 0. Therefore, R_total = L_total. So sum R_i = sum L_i. So sum (R_i - L_i) = sum a_i = 0. Therefore, the sum of all elements in a must be zero. That's a necessary condition.\n\nSo the first condition to check is that the sum of the array is zero. If not, output is \"No\".\n\nBut even if the sum is zero, there might be other constraints.\n\nAnother observation: the process must form a path that never leaves the array. For example, the pointer can't go beyond the first or last element. So during the process, whenever you move left from position i, i must be greater than 1. Similarly for moving right, i must be less than n.\n\nBut how does this affect the array a?\n\nLet's think of the process as building up the array. Starting at position 1. Each time you move right, you add 1 to the current position and move. Each time you move left, you subtract 1 from the current position and move.\n\nSuppose we model the process as a series of moves. Let's track the current position and the array a as it's being built. But with n up to 2e5, we can't simulate this for each test case. So we need a way to find constraints on a without simulating.\n\nAnother key insight: the prefix sum up to the i-th element must be non-negative, except for the last element where the sum must be zero.\n\nWait, considering the path. Let's think of the process in terms of the cumulative right and left steps. The path must return to the first position. So the cumulative steps must form a valid path. \n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is to model the path in terms of the current position's \"balance\". For example, when moving forward through the array, each time you are at position i, you can only move right if you have a positive balance. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when you process the array from left to right, for each position i, the sum up to i must be non-negative. Because when you first arrive at i via a right move, the sum up to i must be at least zero, since you can't have any left steps from i until you have arrived via a right move. \n\nWait, here's a possible line of reasoning: the process must start at 1 and end at 1. So the path can be considered as a series of forward and backward steps. The first time you reach position i (i>1), it's via a right move from i-1. Then, when you move left from i to i-1, you must have enough right moves to allow that. \n\nBut how does this translate into the array a's values? Let's process the array from left to right and keep track of the sum of a_1 to a_i. Let's call this the prefix sum s_i. \n\nAt each step i, the prefix sum s_i must be non-negative. Because when you reach position i for the first time, you must have made s_{i} steps that have contributed to the sum. If the sum up to i is negative, that would imply that you have more left steps than right steps, which isn't possible because you can't have left steps before you arrive via a right step.\n\nWait, perhaps for the array to be possible, the following conditions must hold:\n\n1. The sum of all elements is zero.\n\n2. The prefix sum up to each position i (from 1 to n-1) must be strictly positive. Because after the last operation, the pointer is back to 1, but during the process, when you move past i, the prefix sum must be at least 1 (since you can't have a left step before a right step). Wait, no. Let's think again.\n\nLet me take the sample input given in the note:\n\nSecond test case: [2, -1, -1, 0]. Sum is 2 -1 -1 +0 =0.\n\nThe steps taken are:\n\n0 \u2192 1 (right step, a1 becomes 1, pointer at 2)\n\nThen, a2 is 0. Then move left to 1 (subtract 1 from a2 \u2192 a2 becomes -1, pointer at 1.\n\nThen move right again to 2 (a1 becomes 2, pointer at 2).\n\nThen move right to 3 (a2 becomes 0, pointer at 3).\n\nThen move left to 2 (a3 becomes -1, pointer at 2).\n\nThen move left to 1 (a2 becomes -1, pointer at 1).\n\nSo the array is [2, -1, -1, 0], sum is zero.\n\nThe prefix sums are:\n\na1 = 2 \u2192 s1 = 2.\n\na1 +a2 = 2 + (-1) =1 \u2192 s2=1.\n\ns3 =1 + (-1) =0.\n\ns4 =0 +0=0.\n\nBut during the process, after the first step, the sum up to 1 is 1 (when moving to 2), then after moving back, the sum up to 1 is 2. Then after moving right again, sum up to 2 is 0 (2's a is 0). Wait, perhaps this approach is getting stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: For the array to be possible, the sum must be zero, and during processing the array from left to right, the cumulative sum up to any position i (for i <n) must be greater than zero. And once the cumulative sum reaches zero at some position i (before n), then all subsequent positions must have zero.\n\nWait, here's a possible algorithm:\n\n- The sum of the array must be zero.\n\n- The prefix sum must be non-negative for all positions.\n\n- For all positions except the last, if the prefix sum is zero at any position i <n, then all subsequent elements (i+1 to n) must be zero.\n\nWhy? Because once the prefix sum reaches zero at position i <n, that implies that after processing up to i, the pointer is back to the first position. But since i <n, the only way to proceed is to move right again, which would require the prefix sum to be positive again. But if the sum is zero, then any further steps would require that the sum becomes negative, which is invalid.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The total sum of the array is zero.\n\n2. For each i from 1 to n:\n\n   a. The prefix sum up to i must be >=0.\n\n   b. If the prefix sum up to i is zero, then all elements from i+1 to n must be zero.\n\n3. The first element a_1 must be >=0. Because you can't move left from position 1. So a_1 is the number of right steps from position 1 minus left steps from position 1 (which must be zero), so a_1 must be >=0.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the second test case has a_1 =2 which is >=0. The sum is zero. The prefix sums are:\n\ns1 =2.\n\ns2 =2 + (-1) =1.\n\ns3=1 + (-1)=0. At i=3, which is less than n=4. So according to condition 2b, all elements after i=3 must be zero. But in the sample input, a_4 is zero. So that's allowed. So the condition holds. So the sample input would be allowed.\n\nAnother example: Let's say n=3, a=[1,-1,0]. Sum is 0. Prefix sums are 1, 0, 0. Here, at i=2, the prefix sum is zero. So all elements after i=2 must be zero. But a_3 is 0. So this array would be allowed. But wait, according to the problem's note, the sample input's second test case has a_3=-1. How does that fit?\n\nWait, the sample input's second test case is [2,-1,-1,0]. The sum is zero. The prefix sums are 2,1,0,0. So at i=3 (n=4), the prefix sum is zero. According to condition 2b, all elements after i=3 must be zero. Which they are (a_4 is 0). So it's allowed.\n\nBut if there's an array like [1, -1, 1, -1], sum is zero. The prefix sums are 1,0,1,0. At i=2, the sum is zero, but then a_3 is 1. So according to condition 2b, after i=2, all elements must be zero. But a_3 is 1. So this array would be invalid.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCheck that the total sum is zero.\n\nCheck that the first element is non-negative.\n\nCheck that all prefix sums are >=0.\n\nCheck that once a prefix sum becomes zero (for i <n), all remaining elements are zero.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then output Yes; else No.\n\nSo now, let's think about the code provided. The code is in C++. The code reads t test cases. For each case, reads n and the array. Then, during processing the array elements, it's accumulating sum, and checking some conditions.\n\nIn the code, after reading each element a, it adds to sum. Then:\n\nif sum <0: is_ok=0.\n\nElse if flag <=0 and sum ==0: flag=1.\n\nElse if (missing condition) then is_ok=0.\n\nThe code then checks if is_ok and sum ==0, output yes.\n\nSo the code is trying to capture the conditions. Let's see:\n\nThe sum must be zero at the end.\n\nThe flag is set to 1 when sum becomes zero. So the flag is 1 once the sum reaches zero.\n\nSo during the loop:\n\nFor each a_i:\n\nsum += a_i.\n\nIf sum <0: invalid.\n\nElse if flag is 0 and sum ==0: set flag=1.\n\nElse if (some condition): invalid.\n\nThe code's logic is that once the sum reaches zero (flag is set), then all remaining elements must be zero. Because once you reach a sum of zero, you can't proceed further except to the first element. So any non-zero element after that would invalidate the condition.\n\nSo the missing condition in the code is that if the flag is set (sum was zero previously), then the current a_i must be zero.\n\nSo the missing code in the else if condition is:\n\nflag is 1 (since after sum was zero, we set flag=1), and the current a is non-zero.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nIf sum is negative \u2192 invalid.\n\nElse if it's the first time sum is zero \u2192 set flag to 1.\n\nElse if flag is 1 (sum was zero before) \u2192 then check if current a is non-zero. If so, invalid.\n\nSo the missing code should check if (flag is 1 and a is not zero). But how is that represented in the code?\n\nWait, during the loop, for each element a_i, after adding to sum:\n\nWe have:\n\nif (sum <0) \u2192 invalid.\n\nElse if (flag <=0 and sum ==0) \u2192 set flag=1.\n\nElse if (what condition?) \u2192 invalid.\n\nThe else if is checking for some condition that, when met, sets is_ok to 0.\n\nSo after the sum reaches zero (flag is 1), any subsequent elements (i+1 to n) must be zero. Because once the sum reaches zero, the pointer is back to the first position. So any further elements must be zero. Because moving right would require adding 1 to a_1 and moving to position 2, but then you have to return, which would subtract from a_2, etc. But if the sum is zero, and there's a non-zero element after, that would imply that the sum can't be maintained.\n\nSo once the sum is zero (flag is 1), all remaining elements must be zero. Because after that, you can't have any more operations that change the array. \n\nSo during the loop, once flag is set to 1 (sum was zero), any subsequent element a_i must be zero. Because adding them to sum would cause sum to be a_i, which would be non-zero unless a_i is zero.\n\nWait, but after flag is set to 1, sum is zero. Then, for the next element, sum becomes a_i. So if a_i is non-zero, sum becomes non-zero, which would trigger the first condition (sum <0 if negative), but if a_i is positive, sum is positive. But then sum is not zero anymore, but the sum must be zero overall. So the code's check for sum ==0 at the end would catch that. However, during the loop, once flag is set, any a_i that is non-zero must be invalid, regardless of whether sum is positive or negative. Because after the sum becomes zero, any further elements must be zero.\n\nSo the code needs to check that once flag is set (sum was zero), all subsequent elements must be zero.\n\nBut in the code's loop, for each a_i, the sum is accumulated. Once the sum was zero (flag is 1), then any a_i added to the sum must be zero, so that sum remains zero. Otherwise, the sum will become non-zero, and at the end, sum won't be zero. But the code's final check is sum ==0. So perhaps the code is designed to check that once the sum becomes zero, all subsequent elements must be zero, which ensures that the sum remains zero. \n\nSo the missing condition in the code is:\n\nIf flag is 1 (sum was zero in a previous step), then the current a_i must be zero. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo the code's else if clause is triggered when flag is 1 and a_i is not zero.\n\nIn code terms, the condition would be:\n\nelse if (flag && a !=0)\n\nBut in the code, the a variable is not stored. Because the code reads a into a variable, adds to sum, and then the a is not stored. So how can we check if the current a_i is zero?\n\nWait, the code reads each a_i into a variable 'a' and adds it to sum. So during the iteration, 'sum' is the prefix sum up to i. So when the code processes each a_i, sum is the cumulative sum after adding a_i.\n\nBut how to check if the current a_i is non-zero when flag is set?\n\nWait, the code is processing the elements one by one. Suppose that the sum before processing a_i was s_prev. After adding a_i, the sum is s_prev + a_i. So during the processing of a_i:\n\nsum = sum + a_i (since it's in a loop where sum starts at 0, and each a is added in sequence).\n\nWait, no. The code initializes sum to 0LL. Then, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum += a (which is a_i).\n\nSo sum is the prefix sum up to i+1 (since the array is 1-based in the problem statement, but the code reads 0-based). Or perhaps the code is 0-based. \n\nBut regardless, the code is processing each a_i (elements in the array) and accumulating sum.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nsum starts at 0. For each a_i in the array:\n\nsum += a_i.\n\nThen checks:\n\nif sum <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nElse if flag is 0 and sum ==0 \u2192 set flag=1.\n\nElse if (condition) \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo when flag is 1 (sum was zero in a previous step), the code needs to check that all subsequent a_i's are zero.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nIf after setting flag=1, any a_i added to sum would be part of the sum. But sum must be zero at the end. So if sum was zero (flag=1) and then the next a_i is non-zero, the sum becomes non-zero, which would cause the final check (sum ==0) to fail. \n\nBut the code's logic must also check that once flag is set, all subsequent a_i are zero. Because even if the sum after adding a_i is not zero, but then subsequent a_i's bring it back to zero, it's not allowed.\n\nFor example: array [1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1]. Sum is zero. The prefix sums are 1,0,0,0,1,0. So after the second element, sum is zero (flag is set). Then the third element is 0 (allowed). Fourth is 0 (allowed). Fifth is 1: sum becomes 1. Which is allowed by the code's current checks (sum is positive). But then sixth element is -1: sum becomes 0. So the final sum is zero. But according to our conditions, once the sum is zero (after the second element), all subsequent elements must be zero. So the fifth element is 1, which violates this. Hence, the array should be invalid. But according to the code's current logic, this would be allowed because the sum remains non-negative and ends at zero. But according to our conditions, it's invalid.\n\nSo the code's current logic isn't sufficient. It needs to ensure that once flag is set (sum became zero), all subsequent elements are zero.\n\nBut how can the code check that?\n\nThe code's current structure processes each a_i, adding to sum. Once the sum is zero (flag is set), the next a_i must be zero, and the sum remains zero. Any non-zero a_i after that would make sum non-zero again, which would be caught by the sum check at the end. But in the example above, the fifth element is 1, sum becomes 1, which is allowed (sum is positive), and then sixth is -1, sum becomes 0. But this array is invalid because after the sum became zero (after second element), the third element is zero (allowed), fourth is zero (allowed), fifth is 1 (sum is 1 \u2192 allowed by current checks). But according to the problem's conditions, once the sum becomes zero in the middle (i <n), all remaining elements must be zero. So the fifth element being 1 is invalid.\n\nHence, the code's current logic doesn't catch this case. So the code must check that after the flag is set (sum was zero in a previous step), all subsequent a_i's are zero.\n\nBut how to do that. The sum after adding a_i is the cumulative sum. So when flag is set (sum was zero in a previous step), the current a_i must be zero, and the sum after adding a_i is zero again. Because once the sum is zero, the pointer is back to position 1. Any subsequent operations must be to move right again, which requires adding 1 to a_1. But if a_i (for i> current) is non-zero, that implies that you have steps that are not allowed after the sum is zero.\n\nSo, the code must check that once the flag is set (sum is zero), all subsequent a_i's are zero. Because you can't have any more steps once the sum is zero except possibly steps that return to position 1, but you can't move right again after that.\n\nSo the missing condition in the code's else if is: (flag is set) and (current a_i is not zero). Because the sum is updated to sum += a_i. When flag is set, the previous sum was zero before adding a_i. So after adding a_i, sum becomes a_i. For the current a_i to be allowed, it must be zero. Otherwise, the sum becomes non-zero, which is invalid.\n\nSo the code's else if condition should check whether the flag is set (flag is 1) and sum is not zero. Or, equivalently, whether flag is set and a_i is not zero.\n\nWait, but in the code, after adding a_i to sum, sum becomes the new value. So when the flag is set (sum was zero before adding a_i), the sum after adding a_i is a_i. So if a_i is non-zero, sum becomes non-zero. So the code's else if condition could be:\n\nif (flag is set and sum !=0) \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the code's else if clause should check whether flag is 1 and sum is not zero. Because once the flag is set (sum was zero in a previous step), adding a_i must be zero to maintain sum zero.\n\nSo the missing condition is:\n\nflag > 0 && sum != 0\n\nBut in the code, after adding a_i to sum, the sum is checked. So in the case where flag is set, and a_i is non-zero, sum becomes a_i, which may be positive or negative. \n\nSo the code would check:\n\nif (sum <0) \u2192 invalid.\n\nelse if (flag <=0 && sum ==0) \u2192 set flag=1.\n\nelse if (flag >0 && sum !=0) \u2192 invalid.\n\nWait, but in this case, after flag is set, sum can't be zero. Because sum is zero again, but the flag was already set. So the code would allow this. But according to the problem's conditions, once the sum becomes zero (flag is set), all subsequent a_i's must be zero. So the sum should remain zero. Therefore, after flag is set, every a_i must be zero, which makes sum remain zero.\n\nSo the code's missing condition is:\n\nif (flag has been set and the current sum is not zero) \u2192 invalid.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, once flag is set, any a_i must be zero. Because sum was zero before adding a_i. So sum +=a_i \u2192 sum =a_i. So a_i must be zero. So the code can check if flag is set and a_i is not zero.\n\nBut in the code, after adding a_i to sum, sum is now a_i. So a_i = sum. So if flag is set and sum is not zero, then a_i is not zero. So the code can check if flag is set and sum !=0.\n\nSo the missing condition in the else if is:\n\nflag > 0 && sum !=0\n\nBecause:\n\n- flag is 1 (set).\n\n- sum is now a_i (since previous sum was zero, sum +=a_i is a_i).\n\n- if sum !=0 \u2192 a_i !=0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n(flag > 0 && sum != 0)\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nelse if (flag >0 && sum !=0) \u2192 is_ok =0.\n\nThat's the condition that the code is missing.\n\nLet me check this against the example I had before: [1, -1, 0, 0, 1, -1]. \n\nProcessing the elements:\n\ni=0, a=1 \u2192 sum=1. flag is 0. sum >=0. sum !=0. So no condition met.\n\ni=1, a=-1 \u2192 sum=0. flag is 0 \u2192 set flag=1.\n\ni=2, a=0 \u2192 sum=0. flag is 1. sum is 0. So code checks else if (flag>0 && sum !=0) \u2192 no. So no problem.\n\ni=3, a=0 \u2192 sum=0. Same as above.\n\ni=4, a=1 \u2192 sum=1. flag is 1. sum !=0. So code enters else if (flag>0 && sum !=0) \u2192 is_ok=0. So this element would invalidate the array, which is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the code correctly marks it as invalid.\n\nAnother example: sample input's second test case.\n\narray [2, -1, -1, 0]. sum=0.\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0 (a=2): sum=2. flag is 0. sum >=0. sum !=0. No action.\n\ni=1 (a=-1): sum=1. flag 0, sum not zero. No action.\n\ni=2 (a=-1): sum=0. flag is 0 \u2192 set flag=1.\n\ni=3 (a=0): sum=0. flag is 1. sum is 0. So code's else if condition is false. No problem.\n\nSo code allows this case.\n\nAnother test case: [0,0,0,0]. sum=0. But according to the note, this case is invalid because the pointer isn't back to position 1. Let's see.\n\nIn code:\n\nsum is 0 at the first element (a_1=0). flag is set to 1. Then the next elements are 0,0,0. sum remains zero. So code's else if condition is not triggered. sum is zero. But the code checks if (is_ok and sum ==0). So output is Yes. But according to the note, this array is possible but the pointer isn't back to the first element. So why is the code outputting Yes? Because the code's logic may not be correct.\n\nWait, what's wrong here. The array [0,0,0,0] would have sum zero. According to the code's logic:\n\na_1=0 \u2192 sum=0. flag set to 1.\n\na_2=0 \u2192 sum=0. flag is 1. sum ==0 \u2192 code's else if condition (flag>0 && sum !=0) is false. So is_ok remains 1.\n\nSimilarly for a_3=0 and a_4=0.\n\nAt the end, sum is zero and is_ok is 1. So code outputs yes. But according to the note, this array is invalid because the pointer isn't back to position 1.\n\nSo why is this discrepancy?\n\nAh, because the code's conditions are necessary but not sufficient. There's another condition: the first element must be non-negative.\n\nWait, in this example, a_1 is zero, which is allowed. So according to the code's current conditions, it would output yes. But according to the problem's note, the sample input's first case is [0,0,0,0], which outputs no. Why?\n\nBecause in that case, the pointer is not on the first element after the operations. So even though the array can be formed, the final position is not the first element, so the answer is no.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, the conditions would allow it. So the code's logic is missing a check.\n\nAh, right. So the code's current logic doesn't check that the first element is non-negative. Because a_1 is the number of right steps from position 1 minus left steps from position 1 (which are zero). So a_1 must be >=0.\n\nSo in the example where a_1 is zero, it's allowed. But in the problem's first test case, the array is [0,0,0,0], but the pointer isn't on the first element. So how can that happen?\n\nBecause the code's logic is missing a check for a_1 >=0.\n\nSo the code needs to also check that a_1 is >=0.\n\nBut in the code, how is this checked?\n\nIn the current code, the first element is read into a variable 'a' and added to sum. sum is then checked. If the first element is negative, sum would be negative, which would set is_ok to 0. So the code's first condition (sum <0) would catch a_1 being negative.\n\nBut what if a_1 is zero? Then sum is zero, flag is set. But according to the problem's note, this case is possible but the pointer isn't on the first element, which makes the array invalid. \n\nWait, but why is that case possible? How can the array be formed with a_1=0 but the pointer not ending at position 1?\n\nFor example, suppose the pointer starts at 1, and the array is [0,0,0,0]. How can this be formed?\n\nIf the pointer never moves from position 1, then the array remains all zeros, and the pointer is at 1. So that's valid. But according to the note, the first test case's array can be obtained but the pointer isn't at position 1. So perhaps there's a way to form the array but end at a different position. But according to the problem statement, the array must be formed with the pointer ending at 1. So even if the array can be formed via some steps that end elsewhere, it's invalid.\n\nSo the code's logic must ensure that not only the array is formed, but also the final position is 1. \n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAh! So the code's current conditions are missing the check that a_1 >=0. Because if a_1 is zero, but the pointer ends at 1, then it's valid. But if the array is all zeros, but the pointer is not at 1, then it's invalid. But according to the problem's note, the first test case's array is [0,0,0,0], and it's possible to form the array via some operations but the pointer isn't at 1. So the code's current logic would incorrectly output \"Yes\" for this case.\n\nBut according to the code's current logic, the sum is zero, and the flag is set after the first element. Then, all subsequent elements are zero. So the code would output \"Yes\".\n\nBut according to the problem's note, this case should output \"No\". So what's wrong with the code's logic?\n\nThe code is missing the condition that the pointer must end at position 1. How does the code's logic capture that?\n\nAh! The pointer must end at position 1. To ensure this, the code must also check that the sum is zero and the last element is processed with the pointer at 1. But how to model that.\n\nAnother key insight: the process must end at position 1. So the last step must be a left step from position 2. \n\nBut how does this affect the array.\n\nThe array must have a_1 >=0, sum of elements is zero, prefix sums are non-negative, and once a prefix sum becomes zero (for i <n), all subsequent elements are zero. Additionally, the last prefix sum (sum of all elements) must be zero.\n\nBut in the case where a_1 =0, and all other elements are zero, the code's current logic would output yes. But according to the problem's note, this array is possible but the pointer isn't on the first element. Why?\n\nBecause the way the array is formed may involve steps that end at a different position. For example, if no steps are taken, the array is all zeros, and the pointer is at 1. So this is valid and should output yes. But if there's a sequence of steps that ends at a different position but results in all zeros, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, but if the array is all zeros, the only way to form it is by not moving. Because any movement would require changing the array. For example, moving right once from position 1 to 2 would set a_1=1, which is not zero. So the only way to have a_1=0 is to have no right steps from position 1. But then the pointer must be at position 1. So in this case, the code's logic would output yes, which is correct.\n\nBut the problem's note says that in the first test case, the array is [0,0,0,0], and the answer is no. But according to this reasoning, the code's logic would output yes. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's note. Let me re-read the note:\n\nNoteIn the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element. One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown below.\n\nSo the first test case's array can be obtained via some operations, but the pointer is not on the first element. So the answer is no, but according to the code's current logic, it would output yes. So why is that?\n\nAh! Because the code's logic doesn't check that the pointer ends at position 1. It only checks the sum and the prefix conditions. So the code's logic is missing a condition.\n\nWhat's the missing condition?\n\nThe array can be all zeros, but the pointer ends at position 1. For that to happen, the sequence of steps must start and end at 1. So if no steps are taken, the pointer is at 1. So the array is all zeros, and the pointer is at 1. So this case should output yes. But according to the problem's note, the first test case is possible but the pointer isn't on the first element. So why would that be? Because the problem's first test case's array is formed with steps that end elsewhere.\n\nSo there's a contradiction. How can the array be all zeros but the pointer isn't at 1?\n\nBecause all steps would have to be balanced. For example, moving right once and then left once would result in a_1 =1 (from the right step), a_2 =-1 (from the left step), which is not zeros. So it's impossible to have the array all zeros unless no steps are taken. Hence, the only possible way is that no steps are taken, so the pointer remains at 1. So the array of all zeros should output yes. But according to the problem's note, the first test case's array is [0,0,0,0], and it's possible to form it but the pointer isn't on the first element. But according to our reasoning, this isn't possible. So perhaps the problem's note is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's first test case's array is not all zeros. Let me check the note again.\n\nThe note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element. One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown below.\"\n\nAh, the first test case's array is not all zeros. It's perhaps a different array. But the note doesn't provide the input. So perhaps the first test case's array is [0,0,0,0], but according to the note, it's possible to obtain it but the pointer isn't on the first element. So why is that possible?\n\nThis suggests that there's a way to form the array even when the pointer isn't on the first element. But according to the problem's rules, the answer is no. But according to the code's current logic, it would output yes.\n\nSo there's a missing condition in the code's logic.\n\nAh! Oh right! The code's logic checks for sum ==0 and the other conditions. But even if all conditions are met, the pointer must be on the first element. But how to model that.\n\nWait, the code's current logic doesn't check whether the pointer is on the first element after all steps. It only checks the sum and the prefix conditions. But there's another condition: the array must be formed such that the pointer ends at position 1.\n\nSo what's the condition that ensures that the pointer ends at position 1?\n\nThe pointer's position depends on the sequence of steps. But how to model this in terms of the array's values.\n\nAh! The pointer ends at position 1 if and only if the sum of (right steps - left steps) for each position i is such that the pointer's final position is 1. But the sum of right steps minus left steps for all steps is zero (since R_total = L_total). But how to model the final position.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the final position is 1 only if the total number of right steps equals the total number of left steps. Which is already ensured by the sum being zero.\n\nWait, no. For example, if you move right once and then left once, the pointer ends at position 1. Sum is 1 (right from 1) - 1 (left from 2) \u2192 a_1=1, a_2=-1. Sum is 0. The array is [1,-1], sum zero. Prefix sums are 1 and 0. The code's logic would check that a_1 >=0 (yes), sum is zero (yes), and the prefix sums are non-negative. So the code would output yes. Which is correct.\n\nBut in this case, the pointer ends at position 1.\n\nAnother example: the array [0,0,0,0]. The only way to form this is by taking no steps, so the pointer is at 1. So code would output yes.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case is possible but the pointer isn't on the first element. So perhaps the code's logic is missing a condition.\n\nAh! I think the code's logic is missing the check that the prefix sum for the last element (sum) is zero and the flag is set (sum was zero at some point before the last element). Or perhaps that the sum reaches zero for the first time at the last element.\n\nFor example, consider the array [0,0,0,0]. The sum is zero. The flag is set after the first element. The code's logic would output yes. But according to the problem's note, this case is possible but the pointer isn't on the first element. But how can that be?\n\nThe only way to form this array is by not moving. So the pointer is at 1, which is correct. So the answer should be yes. But the note says that the first test case's array can be formed but the pointer isn't on the first element. So perhaps the first test case's array is not all zeros. For example, maybe it's [0, 0, 0, 0], but the pointer is not at 1. But how is that possible?\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding here. The code's current logic is missing the check that the first element is non-negative. Because in the code's logic, a_1 can be zero. But according to the problem's rules, a_1 can be zero. \n\nWait, the first element a_1 is the number of right steps from position 1. Since you can't move left from position 1, L_1=0. So a_1 = R_1. So a_1 must be >=0.\n\nBut the code's current logic checks that the sum is non-negative. For the first element, sum =a_1. So the first element is allowed to be zero (sum=0), which is correct.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's array is possible but the pointer is not on the first element. So perhaps the first test case's array is possible to form via some steps, but the pointer isn't at 1. Hence, the code's logic must check that the pointer is at 1. \n\nBut how to model that in terms of the array's conditions.\n\nAnother condition: the array must not have any non-zero elements after the prefix sum first becomes zero. Except when the prefix sum first becomes zero at the last element.\n\nSo the code's current logic allows the sum to become zero at any position, but requires that all subsequent elements are zero. But the code also requires that the sum of all elements is zero. So if the sum first becomes zero at the last element, that's allowed.\n\nThus, the code's logic is:\n\n- Sum of elements is zero.\n\n- The prefix sums are non-negative.\n\n- If the sum becomes zero before the last element, all subsequent elements must be zero.\n\n- The first element is >=0 (sum after first element is a_1 >=0).\n\nSo in the case where the array is [0,0,0,0], the code's logic allows it (sum is zero, prefix sums are zero, and all elements after the first are zero). So the code would output yes, which is correct. Because the pointer is at 1.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's array is possible but the pointer isn't on the first element. So perhaps the first test case's array is not all zeros. Or perhaps the note is referring to a different array. \n\nSo the code's missing condition is that the first element is non-negative, which is already handled by the first check sum <0. Because a_1 is the first element, so sum after processing it is a_1. If a_1 is negative, sum <0, which is caught. So the code's current logic covers that.\n\nSo back to the original problem: the code's missing else if condition is:\n\nflag >0 && sum !=0\n\nSo in the code, the missing code is:\n\nflag > 0 && sum !=0\n\nSo the line in the code would be:\n\nelse if (flag > 0 && sum != 0) {\n    is_ok =0;\n}\n\nIn C++ code:\n\nSo the missing line in the code is:\n\nelse if (flag > 0 && sum != 0) {\n\nSo in the code, the placeholder is in the else if condition:\n\n} else if (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\nThe code should be filled with:\n\nflag > 0 && sum != 0\n\nBut written in C++ syntax, since in C++ the logical operators are && and ||.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nflag > 0 && sum != 0"
