But perhaps the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that the sum of all blocks' lengths is >= s^2. So the key is to compute the sum of the lengths of all blocks, then find the maximum s where s^2 <= sum. Then, the answer is the floor of the square root of the sum. Wait, but maybe that's not exactly correct. Let's think. Each block i (from 1 to n) has a length of ceil(i/2). Let's compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n.\n\nLet's find a formula for that sum. For example, when i is even, ceil(i/2) is i/2. When i is odd, it's (i+1)/2. So for each pair (i, i+1) where i is odd, the sum is (i+1)/2 + (i+1)/2 = (i+1). For example, for i=1 and 2: 1/2 ceil is 1, 2/2 is 1. Sum is 2. For i=3 and 4: ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2. Sum is 4. So for even n: sum is (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)/2? Wait, maybe not. Let's think for n even and odd. Wait, let's split into even and odd cases. Let's say n is even: n = 2k. Then the sum is sum_{i=1 to 2k} ceil(i/2). For i=1 and 2: sum is 1+1=2. For i=3 and 4: 2+2=4. For i=2m-1 and 2m: m + m = 2m. So each pair contributes 2m, where m ranges from 1 to k. So sum is 2*(1 + 2 + ... +k) = 2*(k*(k+1)/2) = k*(k+1). Since n=2k, k =n/2. So sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1). If n is odd: n=2k+1. Then the sum is sum_{i=1}^{2k} ceil(i/2) + ceil((2k+1)/2). The first part is k*(k+1), as above. The last term is ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1. So total sum is k*(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)^2. Since n=2k+1, k=(n-1)/2. So sum is ((n-1)/2 +1 )^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2. Wait, let's verify with examples. For n=1: sum is ceil(1/2)=1. ( (1+1)/2 ) ^2 =1^2=1. Correct. For n=3: sum is 1+1+2 =4. ((3+1)/2)^2 = (2)^2=4. Correct. For n=5: sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. (5+1)/2 is 3, squared is 9. Correct. So the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nSo S(n) is equal to floor( (n+1)^2 / 4 ) ? Wait, let's see. Let's compute (n+1)^2 /4 for even and odd n.\n\nCase 1: n is even. Let n=2k. Then (2k+1)^2 /4 = (4k\u00b2 +4k +1)/4 = k\u00b2 +k + 0.25. So floor is k\u00b2 +k. Which is equal to k(k+1), which is what the even case gives. Case 2: n is odd. Let n=2k+1. Then (2k+1 +1)^2 /4 = (2k+2)^2 /4 = (4(k+1)^2)/4 = (k+1)^2. Which matches the odd case. So S(n) = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ) Yes. Because for even n: (n+1)^2 /4 is (2k+1)^2 /4 = (4k\u00b2 +4k +1)/4 = k\u00b2 +k +0.25. The floor is k\u00b2 +k = k(k+1) which is the even sum. So in all cases, S(n) = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ) Wait, but let me check for n=2:\n\n(n+1)^2 /4 =9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor is 2. Which matches sum 1+1=2.\n\nn=4: (5^2)/4=6.25 \u2192 floor 6. Sum for even 4: 2*3=6. Correct. n=5: (6^2)/4=36/4=9 \u2192 sum is 9. Correct. So the sum S(n) is indeed floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ) So the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n), where S(n) is floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ) So s is the integer part of the square root of S(n). But S(n) is floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ), which is a perfect square when n is odd. Because for n odd, (n+1)/2 is integer, so S(n) is ((n+1)/2)^2. So sqrt(S(n)) is (n+1)/2.",

So the square root would be between n/2 and n/2+1. So the integer part would be the floor of sqrt( (n/2)*(n/2 +1) ) Wait, but let's compute S(n) for even n=2k: S(n)=k*(k+1). So the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(k(k+1)). But k(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor of that is k. But wait, sqrt(k(k+1)) is sqrt(k^2 +k). Which is less than sqrt(k^2 + 2k +1 ) = k+1. So floor is k. So for even n=2k, S(n)=k(k+1), and sqrt(S(n)) is about k+0.5, so floor is k. So s is k. But wait, for example: n=4 (k=2). S(n)=2*3=6. sqrt(6) is ~2.45 \u2192 floor is 2. So s=2. Which would give s\u00b2=4 \u22646. But can s be 2? Yes. But maybe even a larger s is possible. Wait, no. Because s must be such that s\u00b2 \u22646. The maximum s is 2, since 3\u00b2=9>6. Wait, but wait, let's think again. For even n, the sum S(n) is k(k+1). So s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)). But for even n=4, k=2. sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)~2.45 \u2192 floor 2. So s=2. But what is the actual maximum possible s? For the sum 6. The sum must be >= s\u00b2, and we can arrange the blocks into s rows. So s\u00b2 must be <=6. So the maximum possible s is 2, since 2\u00b2=4<=6. 3\u00b2=9>6. So yes. So for even n=2k, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k*(k+1)) ) ? Wait, but let's compute for k=3 (n=6). S(n) =3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464 \u2192 floor 3. So s=3. 3\u00b2=9<=12. Yes. So in this case, s=3, which is larger than k=3/2? Wait, n=6, k=3 (since n=2k). Wait, no. Wait, n=2k. So for n=6, k=3. So S(n)=3*4=12. The maximum s is 3, since 3^2=9<=12, and 4^2=16>12. But 3 is the floor of sqrt(12)=3.464. So for even n=2k, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ), which is floor( sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) ). But how do we compute this in terms of n? Because for even n=2k, we have k =n/2. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) = sqrt( (n/2)^2 + n/2 ) = sqrt( (n\u00b2 + 2n)/4 ) = sqrt(n\u00b2 + 2n)/2. Hmm. But maybe there's a pattern here. Wait, let's consider two cases: even and odd n.\n\nCase 1: n is odd. Then S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2. So s is (n+1)/2. For example, n=5, s=3. Which matches the sample input where the answer is 3. Case 2: n is even. Then S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1). So s is the floor of sqrt( (n/2)(n/2 +1) ). Let's compute this. Let me compute for some even n:\n\nn=2: sum=2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414 \u2192 floor 1.\n\nn=4: sum=6. s=2. n=6: sum=12. s=3. n=8: sum=20. sqrt(20) is ~4.47 \u2192 floor 4. So s=4. Wait, but for n=8, sum is 20. s^2 is 16 which is <=20. Then s=4. So that's correct. But when n is even, how can we express s in terms of n?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nn=2 \u2192 s=1 \u2192 which is (2/2) * something. But 2/2=1. s=1.\n\nn=4 \u2192 s=2. 4/2=2. s=2.\n\nn=6 \u2192 s=3. 6/2=3. n=8 \u2192 s=4. 8/2=4. Wait, wait, that's interesting. For even n, s is equal to n/2? But for n=6, s=3 which is 6/2=3. But the sum is 3*4=12. s=3, 3\u00b2=9 < =12. But 3+1=4. 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes, 3 is the correct s.\n\nWait, but if n is even, then the sum S(n) is (n/2) * (n/2 +1). Let's compute s as floor( sqrt( (n/2)(n/2 +1) ) ) But when n is even, (n/2)(n/2 +1) = k(k+1), where k =n/2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is sqrt(k\u00b2 +k). For example, k=3: sqrt(12)\u22483.46. So floor is 3. But k=3: the s is 3. So in that case, s is equal to k. Because sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So the floor is k. Wait, no. For k=3: sqrt(3*4) = sqrt(12)\u22483.464. Floor is 3. Which is equal to k=3. Wait, but for k=1: sqrt(1*2)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414 \u2192 floor 1. Which is k=1. For k=2: sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)\u22482.449 \u2192 floor 2. Which is k=2. Ah, so for even n, s= floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ) =k. Because sqrt(k(k+1)) is always less than k+1, but greater than k. So the floor is k. Wait, no. Wait, let's see:\n\nk(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k.\n\nsqrt(k\u00b2 +k) =k*sqrt(1 + 1/k). Which is between k and k+0.5, since for large k, sqrt(1+1/k) approaches 1+1/(2k). So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) =k + 0.5 * (1/k) *k =k +0.5, approximately. So the floor is k.\n\nWait, but when k is 3: sqrt(3\u00b2+3)=sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 floor is 3. Yes. So for even n, the maximum s is k, where k =n/2. But wait, that would mean for even n, s= n/2. But let's check for n=6: sum is 3*4=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But s could be 3. So the answer would be 3. But the sum is 12, which is 3*4. So s\u00b2=9 <=12. So 3 is allowed. But what about the sum being 12. What is the maximum s possible? The maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <=12. Which is 3, since 3\u00b2=9 <=12 and 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes, s=3= n/2. Wait, but n=6, n/2=3. So yes, s=3. Wait, this seems to hold for even n. So when n is even, s= n/2. But then why in the code sample, for example, when n=5 (odd), the code uses (n+1)/2. Wait, let's see:\n\nSample input 2: n=5. The sum is ((5+1)/2)^2 =9. So s is 3, which is correct. So when n is odd, s= (n+1)/2. But when n is even, sum is k(k+1), which is k\u00b2 +k. So the maximum s is the floor of sqrt(k\u00b2 +k). But for even k, this seems to be equal to k. For example:\n\nk=1: sqrt(2)\u22481.414 \u2192 floor 1. Which is k.\n\nk=2: sqrt(6)\u22482.449 \u2192 floor 2. Which is k.\n\nk=3: sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 floor 3. Which is k. So for even n (n=2k), the maximum s is k. Which is n/2. But then, for even n, the sum is k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. The maximum s is floor(sqrt(k\u00b2 +k)) =k. Because k\u00b2 < k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2 +2k +1 = (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is between k and k+1, so floor is k. So for even n, s= n/2. Wait, but in the sample code, the code has a condition that if something is true, output (n+1)/2, else n/2. So the code seems to check if the sum is >= s^2 where s is (n+1)/2. But for even n, (n+1)/2 is a non-integer. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to compute s as the maximum possible, which depends on whether the sum is >= s^2. So the code's logic is:\n\nCompute s = floor( sqrt( sum ) ) But sum is (n+1)^2 /4, which can be written as ( (n+1)/2 )^2 when n is odd. So for odd n, sum is a perfect square, so s = (n+1)/2. For even n, sum is k(k+1) where k =n/2. Then s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ), which is k if k(k+1) >=k^2. But k(k+1) is k\u00b2 +k. The square root is between k and k+0.5, so floor is k. So for even n, s= k =n/2. Wait, but let me compute for even n=6. sum=3*4=12. s=3. So 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But 3 is the floor of sqrt(12). So yes. But what if sum is 6 (n=4). s is 2. 2\u00b2=4 <=6. Which is correct. So for even n, the maximum s is n/2. So putting this together:\n\nThe maximum s is:\n\nIf the sum is a perfect square (n is odd), then s= (n+1)/2. If the sum is not a perfect square (n is even), then s= n/2. But wait, when n is even, sum is k(k+1) which is not a perfect square, so the maximum s is floor( sqrt( k(k+1) ) ) =k. Which is n/2. So in code, the condition would be: if the sum is a perfect square (i.e., when n is odd), then output (n+1)/2. Otherwise, output n/2. Wait, but how to check if the sum is a perfect square. Because for n being odd, sum is ((n+1)/2)^2, which is a perfect square.",

So the missing code is:\n\nif (n % 2 !=0) So the code would be:\n\nif (n%2) {\n\n   cout << (n+1)/2 << ...;\n\n} else {\n\n   ...;\n\n} But wait, the code is written as:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\n    cout<<int((n+1)/2)<<\"\\n\";\n\n}\n\nelse{\n\n    cout<<n/2<<\"\\n\";\n\n}\n\nSo the condition inside the if is whether n is odd. So the condition is (n % 2 == 1) or (n % 2 !=0). In C++, for integers, if n is odd, then n%2 is 1 (if n is positive). For negative numbers, n%2 can be -1. But since n is given as per the input specification (1 <= n <=1e9), n is always positive. So n%2 is 1 for odd numbers. So the condition should be if (n % 2 ==1). So the missing code is (n % 2).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n blocks. Each block's length is the ceiling of i/2, where i is the block's number from 1 to n. The height of each block is 1 unit. So, the square's side length depends on how we arrange these blocks in such a way that their total area is at least s^2, and the arrangement allows for a square of side s.\n\nWait, but how do the blocks contribute? Each block contributes a length (in one row) and height 1. To form a square of side s, we need s rows, each with total length s. Because each row has height 1, so s rows would give height s. Each row must sum to s in length.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of the lengths of the blocks used is at least s^2. But since we can choose any subset of blocks, the maximum s is determined by the sum of the largest possible lengths.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the blocks can be arranged in any way. Each block can be placed in any row. So the total area of all blocks used must be >= s^2. But also, the sum of lengths in each row must be >= s, and there are s rows. Because each row contributes exactly 1 unit to the height. So the total area is the sum of the lengths of all blocks used. But each row's total length must be at least s. So the sum of all blocks' lengths must be >= s*s. However, if the sum is >= s^2 but the individual rows can't each sum to at least s, then it's not possible. Wait, but maybe that's not a problem here. Because the way the blocks are arranged can split the lengths into the rows. So perhaps the maximum s is determined by the maximum s where the sum of all blocks' lengths is >= s^2, and the sum of the two largest block lengths is >= s (since each row can have at most one block? Wait, no. Wait, the blocks can be arranged in any way. For example, multiple blocks can be placed in a row. So the sum of the lengths of the blocks in a single row must be >= s. So each row needs to have total length >= s. But since we can arrange blocks into rows, the problem is to find the largest s such that sum of all blocks' lengths >= s^2, and the sum of the two smallest blocks (or some other condition) is >= s. Wait, but maybe the sum of the lengths being >= s^2 is sufficient. Because if you have sum >= s^2, then you can distribute the blocks into s rows, each of which has a total length of at least s. How? Because if the total sum is s^2, then by the pigeonhole principle, each row can have s units. But if the sum is higher, then you can have more. But perhaps the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that the sum of all blocks' lengths is >= s^2.\n\nSo the key is to compute the sum of the lengths of all blocks, then find the maximum s where s^2 <= sum. Then, the answer is the floor of the square root of the sum. Wait, but maybe that's not exactly correct. Let's think.\n\nEach block i (from 1 to n) has a length of ceil(i/2). Let's compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n.\n\nLet's find a formula for that sum. For example, when i is even, ceil(i/2) is i/2. When i is odd, it's (i+1)/2. So for each pair (i, i+1) where i is odd, the sum is (i+1)/2 + (i+1)/2 = (i+1). For example, for i=1 and 2: 1/2 ceil is 1, 2/2 is 1. Sum is 2. For i=3 and 4: ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2. Sum is 4. So for even n: sum is (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)/2? Wait, maybe not. Let's think for n even and odd.\n\nWait, let's split into even and odd cases. Let's say n is even: n = 2k. Then the sum is sum_{i=1 to 2k} ceil(i/2). For i=1 and 2: sum is 1+1=2. For i=3 and 4: 2+2=4. For i=2m-1 and 2m: m + m = 2m. So each pair contributes 2m, where m ranges from 1 to k. So sum is 2*(1 + 2 + ... +k) = 2*(k*(k+1)/2) = k*(k+1). Since n=2k, k =n/2. So sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1).\n\nIf n is odd: n=2k+1. Then the sum is sum_{i=1}^{2k} ceil(i/2) + ceil((2k+1)/2). The first part is k*(k+1), as above. The last term is ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1. So total sum is k*(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)^2. Since n=2k+1, k=(n-1)/2. So sum is ((n-1)/2 +1 )^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2.\n\nWait, let's verify with examples. For n=1: sum is ceil(1/2)=1. ( (1+1)/2 )^2 =1^2=1. Correct. For n=3: sum is 1+1+2 =4. ((3+1)/2)^2 = (2)^2=4. Correct. For n=5: sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. (5+1)/2 is 3, squared is 9. Correct.\n\nSo the sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nSo S(n) is equal to floor( (n+1)^2 / 4 ) ?\n\nWait, let's see. Let's compute (n+1)^2 /4 for even and odd n.\n\nCase 1: n is even. Let n=2k. Then (2k+1)^2 /4 = (4k\u00b2 +4k +1)/4 = k\u00b2 +k + 0.25. So floor is k\u00b2 +k. Which is equal to k(k+1), which is what the even case gives.\n\nCase 2: n is odd. Let n=2k+1. Then (2k+1 +1)^2 /4 = (2k+2)^2 /4 = (4(k+1)^2)/4 = (k+1)^2. Which matches the odd case.\n\nSo S(n) = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 )\n\nYes. Because for even n: (n+1)^2 /4 is (2k+1)^2 /4 = (4k\u00b2 +4k +1)/4 = k\u00b2 +k +0.25. The floor is k\u00b2 +k = k(k+1) which is the even sum.\n\nSo in all cases, S(n) = floor( (n+1)^2 /4 )\n\nWait, but let me check for n=2:\n\n(n+1)^2 /4 =9/4=2.25 \u2192 floor is 2. Which matches sum 1+1=2.\n\nn=4: (5^2)/4=6.25 \u2192 floor 6. Sum for even 4: 2*3=6. Correct.\n\nn=5: (6^2)/4=36/4=9 \u2192 sum is 9. Correct.\n\nSo the sum S(n) is indeed floor( (n+1)^2 /4 )\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 S(n), where S(n) is floor( (n+1)^2 /4 )\n\nSo s is the integer part of the square root of S(n).\n\nBut S(n) is floor( (n+1)^2 /4 ), which is a perfect square when n is odd. Because for n odd, (n+1)/2 is integer, so S(n) is ((n+1)/2)^2. So sqrt(S(n)) is (n+1)/2. For even n, S(n) is (n/2)*(n/2 +1) \u2192 which is a product of two consecutive integers, so it's between (n/2)^2 and (n/2 +1)^2. So the square root would be between n/2 and n/2+1. So the integer part would be the floor of sqrt( (n/2)*(n/2 +1) )\n\nWait, but let's compute S(n) for even n=2k: S(n)=k*(k+1). So the maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(k(k+1)).\n\nBut k(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor of that is k. But wait, sqrt(k(k+1)) is sqrt(k^2 +k). Which is less than sqrt(k^2 + 2k +1 ) = k+1. So floor is k. So for even n=2k, S(n)=k(k+1), and sqrt(S(n)) is about k+0.5, so floor is k. So s is k.\n\nBut wait, for example: n=4 (k=2). S(n)=2*3=6. sqrt(6) is ~2.45 \u2192 floor is 2. So s=2. Which would give s\u00b2=4 \u22646. But can s be 2? Yes. But maybe even a larger s is possible. Wait, no. Because s must be such that s\u00b2 \u22646. The maximum s is 2, since 3\u00b2=9>6.\n\nWait, but wait, let's think again. For even n, the sum S(n) is k(k+1). So s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)).\n\nBut for even n=4, k=2. sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)~2.45 \u2192 floor 2. So s=2.\n\nBut what is the actual maximum possible s? For the sum 6. The sum must be >= s\u00b2, and we can arrange the blocks into s rows. So s\u00b2 must be <=6. So the maximum possible s is 2, since 2\u00b2=4<=6. 3\u00b2=9>6. So yes.\n\nSo for even n=2k, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k*(k+1)) ) ?\n\nWait, but let's compute for k=3 (n=6). S(n) =3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464 \u2192 floor 3. So s=3. 3\u00b2=9<=12. Yes.\n\nSo in this case, s=3, which is larger than k=3/2? Wait, n=6, k=3 (since n=2k). Wait, no. Wait, n=2k. So for n=6, k=3. So S(n)=3*4=12. The maximum s is 3, since 3^2=9<=12, and 4^2=16>12.\n\nBut 3 is the floor of sqrt(12)=3.464.\n\nSo for even n=2k, the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ), which is floor( sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) ). But how do we compute this in terms of n? Because for even n=2k, we have k =n/2. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) = sqrt( (n/2)^2 + n/2 ) = sqrt( (n\u00b2 + 2n)/4 ) = sqrt(n\u00b2 + 2n)/2.\n\nHmm. But maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, let's consider two cases: even and odd n.\n\nCase 1: n is odd. Then S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2. So s is (n+1)/2. For example, n=5, s=3. Which matches the sample input where the answer is 3.\n\nCase 2: n is even. Then S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 +1). So s is the floor of sqrt( (n/2)(n/2 +1) ). Let's compute this.\n\nLet me compute for some even n:\n\nn=2: sum=2. s=1. sqrt(2) is ~1.414 \u2192 floor 1.\n\nn=4: sum=6. s=2.\n\nn=6: sum=12. s=3.\n\nn=8: sum=20. sqrt(20) is ~4.47 \u2192 floor 4. So s=4.\n\nWait, but for n=8, sum is 20. s^2 is 16 which is <=20. Then s=4. So that's correct.\n\nBut when n is even, how can we express s in terms of n?\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nn=2 \u2192 s=1 \u2192 which is (2/2) * something. But 2/2=1. s=1.\n\nn=4 \u2192 s=2. 4/2=2. s=2.\n\nn=6 \u2192 s=3. 6/2=3.\n\nn=8 \u2192 s=4. 8/2=4.\n\nWait, wait, that's interesting. For even n, s is equal to n/2? But for n=6, s=3 which is 6/2=3. But the sum is 3*4=12. s=3, 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But 3+1=4. 4\u00b2=16>12. So yes, 3 is the correct s.\n\nWait, but if n is even, then the sum S(n) is (n/2) * (n/2 +1). Let's compute s as floor( sqrt( (n/2)(n/2 +1) ) )\n\nBut when n is even, (n/2)(n/2 +1) = k(k+1), where k =n/2.\n\nSo sqrt(k(k+1)) is sqrt(k\u00b2 +k). For example, k=3: sqrt(12)\u22483.46. So floor is 3.\n\nBut k=3: the s is 3. So in that case, s is equal to k. Because sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So the floor is k. Wait, no. For k=3: sqrt(3*4) = sqrt(12)\u22483.464. Floor is 3. Which is equal to k=3.\n\nWait, but for k=1: sqrt(1*2)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414 \u2192 floor 1. Which is k=1.\n\nFor k=2: sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)\u22482.449 \u2192 floor 2. Which is k=2.\n\nAh, so for even n, s= floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) )=k. Because sqrt(k(k+1)) is always less than k+1, but greater than k. So the floor is k. Wait, no. Wait, let's see:\n\nk(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k.\n\nsqrt(k\u00b2 +k) =k*sqrt(1 + 1/k).\n\nWhich is between k and k+0.5, since for large k, sqrt(1+1/k) approaches 1+1/(2k). So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) =k + 0.5 * (1/k) *k =k +0.5, approximately. So the floor is k.\n\nWait, but when k is 3: sqrt(3\u00b2+3)=sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 floor is 3.\n\nYes. So for even n, the maximum s is k, where k =n/2.\n\nBut wait, that would mean for even n, s= n/2. But let's check for n=6: sum is 3*4=12. s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But s could be 3. So the answer would be 3.\n\nBut the sum is 12, which is 3*4. So s\u00b2=9 <=12. So 3 is allowed.\n\nBut what about the sum being 12. What is the maximum s possible? The maximum s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <=12. Which is 3, since 3\u00b2=9 <=12 and 4\u00b2=16>12.\n\nSo yes, s=3= n/2.\n\nWait, but n=6, n/2=3. So yes, s=3.\n\nWait, this seems to hold for even n. So when n is even, s= n/2. But then why in the code sample, for example, when n=5 (odd), the code uses (n+1)/2. Wait, let's see:\n\nSample input 2: n=5. The sum is ((5+1)/2)^2 =9. So s is 3, which is correct. So when n is odd, s= (n+1)/2.\n\nBut when n is even, sum is k(k+1), which is k\u00b2 +k. So the maximum s is the floor of sqrt(k\u00b2 +k). But for even k, this seems to be equal to k. For example:\n\nk=1: sqrt(2)\u22481.414 \u2192 floor 1. Which is k.\n\nk=2: sqrt(6)\u22482.449 \u2192 floor 2. Which is k.\n\nk=3: sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 floor 3. Which is k.\n\nSo for even n (n=2k), the maximum s is k. Which is n/2.\n\nBut then, for even n, the sum is k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. The maximum s is floor(sqrt(k\u00b2 +k)) =k. Because k\u00b2 < k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2 +2k +1 = (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k\u00b2 +k) is between k and k+1, so floor is k.\n\nSo for even n, s= n/2.\n\nWait, but in the sample code, the code has a condition that if something is true, output (n+1)/2, else n/2.\n\nSo the code seems to check if the sum is >= s^2 where s is (n+1)/2. But for even n, (n+1)/2 is a non-integer.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute s as the maximum possible, which depends on whether the sum is >= s^2. So the code's logic is:\n\nCompute s = floor( sqrt( sum ) )\n\nBut sum is (n+1)^2 /4, which can be written as ( (n+1)/2 )^2 when n is odd.\n\nSo for odd n, sum is a perfect square, so s = (n+1)/2.\n\nFor even n, sum is k(k+1) where k =n/2. Then s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ), which is k if k(k+1) >=k^2. But k(k+1) is k\u00b2 +k. The square root is between k and k+0.5, so floor is k. So for even n, s= k =n/2.\n\nWait, but let me compute for even n=6. sum=3*4=12. s=3. So 3\u00b2=9 <=12. But 3 is the floor of sqrt(12). So yes.\n\nBut what if sum is 6 (n=4). s is 2. 2\u00b2=4 <=6. Which is correct.\n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is n/2.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nThe maximum s is:\n\nIf the sum is a perfect square (n is odd), then s= (n+1)/2.\n\nIf the sum is not a perfect square (n is even), then s= n/2.\n\nBut wait, when n is even, sum is k(k+1) which is not a perfect square, so the maximum s is floor( sqrt( k(k+1) ) )=k. Which is n/2.\n\nSo in code, the condition would be: if the sum is a perfect square (i.e., when n is odd), then output (n+1)/2. Otherwise, output n/2.\n\nWait, but how to check if the sum is a perfect square. Because for n being odd, sum is ((n+1)/2)^2, which is a perfect square. For even n, sum is k(k+1), which is not a perfect square.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nIf n is odd, then output (n+1)/2.\n\nIf n is even, output n/2.\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nLet's test some examples.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=1 (odd). Output is (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=5 (odd). Output is 3. Correct.\n\nSample input where n is even:\n\nn=4. sum is 6. s=2. 2^2=4<=6. So output is 2.\n\nAnother example: n=6. sum=12. s=3. 3^2=9 <=12. So output 3.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, for even n, the output is n/2. So 6/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=8. sum=20. s=4. 4^2=16 <=20. So code outputs 4. Which is 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, code outputs n/2. For odd n, code outputs (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, how to determine if n is even or odd. So the code checks if n is odd. Then, output (n+1)/2. Else, output n/2.\n\nSo in code, the condition would be if n is odd. But wait, in the code provided, the missing part is an if condition that decides whether to output (n+1)/2 or n/2.\n\nSo the code is structured as:\n\nif ( condition ) {\n\n   cout << (n+1)/2 << \"\\n\";\n\n} else {\n\n   cout << n/2 << \"\\n\";\n\n}\n\nSo the condition must be true when n is odd. Because for odd n, the answer is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the condition is whether n is odd. Because when n is odd, (n+1)/2 is integer. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3.\n\nSo the condition is if (n is odd) ?\n\nBut wait, n is of type ll (long long). So how to check if n is odd.\n\nIn C++, n % 2 != 0.\n\nSo the condition is if (n % 2 != 0).\n\nSo the missing code in the if condition is n % 2 !=0.\n\nBut wait, let's test that.\n\nIf n is odd, then (n+1)/2 is (2k+1 +1)/2= (2k+2)/2= k+1. Which is correct.\n\nIf n is even, then n/2 is correct.\n\nSo the code's condition should be if (n % 2 !=0), then output (n+1)/2, else output n/2.\n\nBut let's check the sample input where n=5 (odd). The code outputs 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6 (even) \u2192 code outputs 3. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, let's see the sample input given in the problem statement. For n=5, the sample output is 3, which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: when n=6, output is 3 (6/2=3). Correct.\n\nSo the code's condition is whether n is odd. So the missing code is:\n\nif (n % 2 !=0)\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nif (n%2) {\n\n   cout << (n+1)/2 << ...;\n\n} else {\n\n   ...;\n\n}\n\nBut wait, the code is written as:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n\n    cout<<int((n+1)/2)<<\"\\n\";\n\n}\n\nelse{\n\n    cout<<n/2<<\"\\n\";\n\n}\n\nSo the condition inside the if is whether n is odd.\n\nSo the condition is (n % 2 == 1) or (n % 2 !=0).\n\nIn C++, for integers, if n is odd, then n%2 is 1 (if n is positive). For negative numbers, n%2 can be -1. But since n is given as per the input specification (1 <= n <=1e9), n is always positive. So n%2 is 1 for odd numbers.\n\nSo the condition should be if (n % 2 ==1).\n\nSo the missing code is (n % 2).\n\nBecause in C++, if the condition is non-zero, it's considered true. So writing (n%2) is equivalent to checking if the remainder is 1 (for positive n).\n\nSo the correct code for the missing condition is n % 2.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nif (n % 2) { ... }\n\nWhich is equivalent to checking if n is odd.\n\nSo the missing code is (n%2). So the if condition is filled with (n%2).\n\nTesting this:\n\nn=5 \u2192 5%2=1 \u2192 true \u2192 output 3.\n\nn=4 \u21924%2=0 \u2192 false \u2192 output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the correct condition is (n%2)."
