    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed using the stamp operations described. The stamp can be applied multiple times, each time flipping two adjacent cells as either RB or BR. Each application affects those two cells, possibly changing their colors multiple times.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find out the necessary conditions that the target string must satisfy for it to be possible. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nFirst, any W in the string is a cell that has never been stamped. Because once a cell is part of a stamp, it changes color. Wait, but the stamp can be applied multiple times. Wait, no. Because even if you stamp a cell multiple times, each time it's part of a pair. So a W can only exist in positions that have never been stamped at all. Because once a stamp is applied to a cell, it's either R or B. So any W in the target must be such that neither the cell nor its neighbors have been stamped? Wait no. Wait, each time you stamp two adjacent cells. So each stamp affects exactly those two cells. So for a cell to remain white, it must never have been part of any stamp. But how? Because the initial cells are white. If you stamp a cell, it's no longer white. So if the target has a W, that cell must never have been stamped. But also, any cell adjacent to a W can't have been stamped in a way that would affect the W? Wait no. Because if a cell is W, that means it was never stamped. Because any time you stamp a cell (as part of a pair), it's color changes. So, for example, if a cell is W in the target, it must have never been part of any stamp. Because any stamp that includes it would change its color.\n\nSo, that implies that all Ws in the target must form contiguous blocks, but more importantly, any non-W (R or B) must form segments between Ws. Because if there's a W between two non-Ws, those non-W segments are separate. Because the W can't be part of any stamp, so the non-W segments on either side of the W must be formed independently.\n\nSo the approach is to split the string into segments separated by Ws. For each of these segments (which consist of R and B only), we need to check if each such segment can be formed by some sequence of stamps.\n\nSo the first step is to split the string into parts separated by W. Then, for each of these parts, check if it's possible to form that part using stamps. If all parts are possible, then the answer is YES, else NO.\n\nNow, the question is: what conditions must a segment of R and B (without W) satisfy to be formable by the stamps?\n\nEach stamp application affects two adjacent cells, and sets them to either RB or BR. But each application can be overlapping. For example, applying a stamp to positions 1-2, then 2-3, etc. Each stamp can be applied in either direction. And each application overrides the previous colors of those two cells.\n\nBut the key is to model what the possible sequences of R and B can be generated by these operations.\n\nLet's consider small examples:\n\nFor a single cell: it's impossible. Because the stamp requires two cells. So any segment of length 1 is automatically invalid, unless it's W. But since we are considering segments split by W, so any segment in the split parts must have length >=1. But for a segment of length 1, since it's R or B, it's impossible. So in that case, the answer is NO.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the second note says that for test cases where n=2, but the input is \"WB\" (wait, no, in note 2-4, the test cases have n=1, which is impossible to stamp). So in our code, any segment of length 1 (non-W) would make the entire test case invalid.\n\nSo the first condition is that each segment (split by Ws) must have length at least 2. Wait, no. Because, for example, if the entire string is \"RRBB\", then when split by Ws, it's a single segment of length 4, which is okay. But if a segment is of length 1, like \"R\", then it's invalid. So the code should split the string into parts separated by Ws, then for each part, check if:\n\n1. The part's length is at least 1. Wait, but if the part is split by Ws, then the parts are those elements that are between Ws. For example, \"WBRBWWB\" would split into [\"BRB\", \"B\"], then the second part has length 1, which is invalid.\n\nSo the first check is: after splitting by Ws, each resulting segment (if any) must have length >=2. Because a segment of length 1 can't be formed by any stamps, since each stamp covers two cells, and you can't create a single cell.\n\nWait, but how can a segment of length 1 exist between Ws? For example, \"WWBWW\" would split into [\"B\"], which is length 1. So in that case, the answer is NO.\n\nSo first, for each segment in line (the split parts), if any of them has length 1, then return NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the entire string is \"W\"? Then line would be empty, and all([]) is True, so the answer is YES. Which is correct, since you don't need to do any stamps.\n\nSo the next condition is: each segment (non-W) must have length >=2.\n\nBut then, even that's not sufficient. For example, a segment like \"RRR\" of length 3. How can that be formed?\n\nWait, let's think. Let's say we have a segment of length 3. Let's see possible sequences.\n\nFor example, \"RBR\".\n\nHow can that be formed?\n\nWe can start with \"WWW\".\n\nApply the stamp to positions 1-2 as BR: becomes BRW.\n\nThen apply to 2-3 as RB: B becomes R, W becomes B. So the result is BRB.\n\nWait, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nEach application of the stamp changes two adjacent cells. For example, applying BR to positions i and i+1 would set them to B and R. Applying RB would set to R and B.\n\nBut each application can override previous changes. For example, if a cell was R, applying a stamp that includes it can change it to B or R again, depending on the stamp.\n\nSo the key is to find the parity of the number of times each cell is covered in a stamp, and in which direction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each cell (except the first and last in a segment) must be covered an even or odd number of times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parity of the number of stamps affecting each position.\n\nWait, perhaps this can be modeled as a system of equations. Let's model each cell's color as the result of the stamps applied to it.\n\nEach stamp covers two consecutive cells. Let's think of each stamp application as flipping the colors of those two cells according to the stamp's orientation.\n\nBut each stamp can be applied multiple times. So the order might not matter, but the parity could.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each segment, the first and last characters must be different. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire segment must have at least one R and one B.\n\nWait, looking at the sample code. The original code provided is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    num = int(input())\n    line = [elem for elem in input().split(\"W\") if elem != \"\"]\n    print(\"YES\" if all([\"B\" in elem and \"R\" in elem for elem in line]) else \"NO\")\n\nBut the user said that this code is missing some parts and needs to be completed.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is intended to split the string into parts separated by Ws, then check that in each part, there is at least one R and one B. Because, for example, if a segment is all Bs, then it's impossible. Because each stamp operation creates one R and one B. So after any number of operations, a segment cannot be all R or all B.\n\nBut why?\n\nFor example, let's take a segment of length 2. If the desired outcome is \"RR\", can that be achieved?\n\nThe only possible stamps for two cells are BR and RB. Applying BR once gives BR. Applying it again would toggle back to WB? Wait no. Because each stamp application overwrites the two cells. So, for example, applying BR to a pair once, the cells become B and R. Applying BR again, they become B and R again. Wait, no. Because each stamp application sets the two cells to the given colors, regardless of their previous state.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp. So, applying a stamp to the same pair again will overwrite their colors. So, for example, if you apply the BR stamp twice on the same pair, the first time it becomes BR, the second time, it becomes BR again. So applying it an even number of times leaves it as BR. Wait, no, because each application sets the pair to BR. So applying it any number of times, even or odd, the result is BR. So if you want to change it, you have to apply a different stamp (RB) or apply stamps overlapping.\n\nSo the color changes are not additive. Each stamp application on a pair of cells completely overwrites their colors to either BR or RB. So the order of operations matters, but the same pair can be stamped multiple times, each time changing the colors.\n\nBut how can you end up with, say, RR?\n\nFor example, let's consider a segment of two cells. To get RR, you would need to apply a stamp that sets both to R. But each stamp can only set one R and one B. So for two cells, it's impossible to have both R. So a segment of two cells must be either BR or RB. Thus, if the target is \"RR\", it's impossible. So the condition that each segment must have at least one R and one B is necessary.\n\nSimilarly, a segment of all B's is impossible. So the code in the sample is checking that each non-W segment contains both B and R. But this is not sufficient, because for example, a segment like \"BRR\" would have B and R, but perhaps it's impossible.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's take the example of \"BRB\".\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the first sample's final picture is BRB. The code would check that \"BRB\" has both B and R, so it returns YES. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about a segment like \"RBRB\"? The code would check that it has both R and B, so returns YES. But can that be formed?\n\nWait, let's think. Let's imagine a segment of length 4. How can we form RBRB.\n\nWe can start with WWWW.\n\nApply stamp to positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 BRWW.\n\nThen apply to 2-3 as RB \u2192 B R B W.\n\nThen apply to 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R B R. So the result is BRBR. But we wanted RBRB.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Alternatively, maybe the code's condition is sufficient. Let's think about what the code is doing.\n\nThe code splits the input into segments separated by Ws. Then, for each segment, it checks that the segment contains at least one B and one R. If all segments pass this check, then output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut is that sufficient?\n\nLet's see. For example:\n\nTest case: \"BR\" \u2192 allowed. \"RB\" \u2192 allowed. \"RBR\" \u2192 allowed. \"BBR\" \u2192 allowed. All of these have both R and B.\n\nBut what about a segment like \"RBBR\"? That's allowed. So how is that formed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's condition is both necessary and sufficient. Because in each non-W segment, you must have at least one R and B, and the length is at least 2. Wait, but the code does not check for length >=2. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, the code as written:\n\nAfter splitting, each elem is a non-empty string (since they filter out empty strings). Then, for each elem in line, check if \"B\" is in elem and \"R\" is in elem.\n\nBut a segment could be of length 1. For example, input \"B\", then line would be [\"B\"], and the code checks if \"B\" is in \"B\" (yes) and \"R\" is in \"B\" (no). So the all() returns False, so output is NO. Which is correct.\n\nBut if the input is \"BR\", then line is [\"BR\"], which has both B and R. So output YES.\n\nWait, but how about a segment of length 2 that's \"BB\"? Then the code's check would fail, since there's no R. So it returns NO. Which is correct, because you can't have two Bs.\n\nSo the code's check includes the condition that each segment is at least 2 in length implicitly. Because if the segment has length 1, then it can't have both B and R, so the check fails. If the segment is length 2, then the check ensures that it has both B and R, so that the pair is either BR or RB. Which is required because each stamp application must result in one B and one R.\n\nWait, but wait: the code's check is that each segment must have at least one B and one R. So for a segment of length 2, this is possible only if it's BR or RB. So the code's check would return True for such segments, which is correct.\n\nBut what about longer segments?\n\nFor example, a segment of length 3: \"BRB\". It has both B and R. So the code returns YES. But can such a segment be formed?\n\nYes, according to the first example in the problem statement.\n\nAnother example: \"BRR\". It has both B and R. But can it be formed?\n\nLet's see. Let's start with WWW.\n\nApply a stamp to positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 W BR \u2192 WBR. Then apply a stamp to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 RB R \u2192 RBR. Then apply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, R becomes R \u2192 BRR. Wait, no. Let's walk through:\n\nInitial: WWW (all white).\n\nStamp 2-3 as BR: positions 2 and 3 become B and R \u2192 W B R.\n\nStamp 1-2 as RB: positions 1 and 2 become R and B \u2192 R B R.\n\nThen stamp 2-3 as BR: positions 2 becomes B, R becomes R? Wait, no. Applying BR to positions 2-3 would set them to B and R. So after that, positions 2 is B and 3 is R. So the sequence becomes R B R. Wait, that's the same as before. So maybe applying stamps in a different order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to form BRR. Let's think:\n\nStart with WWW.\n\nApply stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nApply stamp 1-2 again as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nApply stamp 2-3 as BR \u2192 B becomes R and W becomes R \u2192 R R R. Wait, no. Wait, stamp 2-3 as BR: positions 2 and 3 become B and R. So after that, the string would be R (from position 1), B (from position 2), R (from position 3). So R B R.\n\nHmm. So it's unclear if \"BRR\" can be formed. Maybe not. Because the code's check would allow it, but maybe it's not possible.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample code, the code is correct. Wait, the code in the problem is the one that's missing some parts. The user is asking to complete the code. So the code given is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    num = int(input())\n    line = [elem for elem in input().split(\"W\") if elem != \"\"]\n    print(\"YES\" if all([\"B\" in elem and \"R\" in elem for elem in line]) else \"NO\")\n\nBut this code may not handle cases where the segment is of length 1. Wait, but in the code, the line splits the input into parts that are split by Ws. For example, if the input is \"BRBWWB\", then the line is [\"BRB\", \"B\"]. Then, for each element in line, check if it contains both B and R. The first element does, the second element is \"B\", which does not. So the code would output NO. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about a segment of length 3 that is \"RRB\"? It has R and B, so the code returns YES. But is that possible?\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with three whites. Apply stamp to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 B becomes B (from the first stamp?), wait, no. Let me track:\n\nOriginal: WWW.\n\nAfter applying RB to 1-2: R B W.\n\nThen apply BR to 2-3: positions 2 and 3 become B and R. So the string becomes R B R.\n\nWait, that's RBR. Then apply another stamp. For example, apply RB to 1-2 again: R B becomes R B again? So no change.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the code's condition is not sufficient. But according to the problem statement's sample, the code works. For example, in the fifth test case, the input is 3, \"RBR\". The code splits into [\"RBR\"], which contains both R and B, so returns YES. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about a segment like \"RBRB\" of length 4. The code's condition is satisfied, but can that be formed?\n\nYes. For example, apply stamps to 1-2 as RB, then 3-4 as BR, resulting in R B B R. Then apply stamp to 2-3 as RB, which would set them to R and B. So the result is R R B R. Wait, not the same as RBRB. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to form RBRB.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with WWWW.\n\nApply stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 RBWW.\n\nThen apply 2-3 as BR \u2192 B becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 R B R W.\n\nThen apply 3-4 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R B R B.\n\nSo the result is RBRB. So yes, it can be formed.\n\nSo the code's condition is sufficient in this case.\n\nBut what about a segment like \"RRB\"?\n\nThe code says YES, but can it be formed?\n\nStart with three whites: WWW.\n\nApply stamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 RBW.\n\nApply stamp 1-2 again as BR \u2192 BRW.\n\nApply stamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 B R B.\n\nSo the result is BRB. Not RRB.\n\nHmm. So maybe RRB is not possible. Let's think of another way.\n\nAnother approach: maybe each segment must start and end with different colors. But how?\n\nWait, for example, to create a segment of length 3: RRB.\n\nLet me try:\n\nApply stamp to positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 RBW.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R B B.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nApply stamp to 3-4, but that's outside. So no. So maybe it's impossible. But the code would return YES because RRB contains both R and B.\n\nSo in this case, the code's condition is not sufficient. Which suggests that the code as provided is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample code is part of the solution. So perhaps the code is missing some conditions.\n\nSo what's wrong with the code?\n\nThe code checks that each non-W segment contains at least one R and B. But in some cases, like a segment of \"RRB\", the code would return YES but the actual answer is NO.\n\nWait, but how can RRB be formed?\n\nAlternative approach: let's model the possible transformations.\n\nEach stamp application affects two adjacent cells. The order of applying the stamps can change the outcome. However, since each application completely overwrites the two cells, the outcome depends on the last stamp applied to each pair of cells.\n\nFor example, in a segment of three cells (positions 1,2,3), the possible stamps are (1-2) and (2-3). Each stamp can be applied any number of times. The last application to each pair determines their current color.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIf you apply a stamp to (1-2) as RB, then (2-3) as BR, then the cells are:\n\n1: R, 2: B (from first stamp), then 2: B is overwritten by the second stamp (B and R?), wait no. Applying the stamp BR to positions 2-3 sets cells 2 and 3 to B and R.\n\nWait, but after the first stamp (1-2 as RB), the cells are R and B. Then, the second stamp (2-3 as BR) sets cells 2 and 3 to B and R. So the result is R (from cell 1), B (cell 2), R (cell3).\n\nSo the final string is RBR.\n\nSo for a three-cell segment, RBR is possible.\n\nBut what about RRB?\n\nLet's see: is there a way to get RRB?\n\nSuppose I apply:\n\nApply to 1-2 as RB \u2192 RBW.\n\nApply to 1-2 as RB again \u2192 RBW (no change).\n\nApply to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes R (from previous step), W becomes B \u2192 R R B.\n\nYes! Wait, no. Applying the stamp to 2-3 as RB would set cells 2 and 3 to R and B. But in the previous step, cell 2 is B, and cell 3 is W.\n\nSo after applying RB to 2-3, cells 2 and 3 become R and B. So the result is R (cell1), R (cell2), B (cell3). That's RRB. So yes, it's possible.\n\nWait, so the code's condition would correctly return YES for \"RRB\" and it is possible.\n\nSo why did I think it wasn't possible before? Because I made a mistake in the steps.\n\nSo according to this, the code's condition is sufficient.\n\nSo perhaps the code is correct. The code splits the string into non-W segments, and for each segment, checks that it contains at least one B and one R. If any segment is all B or all R, then it's impossible, hence the answer is NO.\n\nThus, the code provided is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about a segment of even length where the colors alternate but have the same starting and ending? For example, \"RBRB\" (length 4). It has both R and B. The code returns YES, and it is possible.\n\nAnother example: \"RBRBRB\" (length 6). Code returns YES.\n\nSo the code's condition seems to be correct.\n\nBut why does this condition hold?\n\nEach time you apply a stamp, you're adding a BR or RB pair. So each stamp contributes exactly one B and one R. But when you apply multiple stamps overlapping, you can overwrite previous colors.\n\nHowever, any non-W segment must have at least one B and one R. Because each stamp application adds both colors. If a segment is all R, then there's no way to create it, since each stamp application introduces at least one B.\n\nSo the code's condition is necessary.\n\nIs it sufficient? From the examples above, it seems to be.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Split the string into parts separated by Ws, ignoring empty parts.\n\n- For each part, check if it contains both B and R.\n\nIf all parts pass this check, output YES; else, NO.\n\nAdditionally, we need to handle cases where a part is of length 1, which automatically fails the check.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, the code's line is:\n\nline = [elem for elem in input().split(\"W\") if elem != \"\"]\n\nFor example, if the input is \"WBR\", split by W gives [\"\", \"BR\"]. But the list comprehension filters out empty strings, so line is [\"BR\"].\n\nIf the input is \"RWWB\", the split is [\"R\", \"\", \"B\"], then filtered to [\"R\", \"B\"], each of which is length 1. The code checks each for B and R. For \"R\", it's R not in \"R\" (wait, no. \"R\" has R but not B. So \"R\" would not satisfy \"B\" in elem and \"R\" in elem. So all() would return False, so output is NO. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code handles all cases.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the loop over the test cases. The code provided has:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    num = int(input())\n    line = [elem for elem in input().split(\"W\") if elem != \"\"]\n    print(\"YES\" if all([\"B\" in elem and \"R\" in elem for elem in line]) else \"NO\")\n\nSo the missing part is the loop for each test case. The code should read t test cases, so the loop should be for _ in range(t): ... So the missing code is the loop.\n\nBut looking at the code structure:\n\nThe user provided code starts with:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    num = int(input())\n    line = [elem for elem in input().split(\"W\") if elem != \"\"]\n    print(\"YES\" if all([\"B\" in elem and \"R\" in elem for elem in line]) else \"NO\")\n\nBut in Python, the for loop must have an iterator. So the correct code would be:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    parts = [part for part in s.split('W') if part]\n    valid = True\n    for part in parts:\n        if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut in the code provided by the user, the loop over test cases is missing. The original code has:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    num = int(input())\n    line = [elem for elem in input().split(\"W\") if elem != \"\"]\n    print(\"YES\" if all([\"B\" in elem and \"R\" in elem for elem in line]) else \"NO\")\n\nSo the missing part is the loop that reads t test cases. So the code should be:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    line = [elem for elem in s.split('W') if elem != '']\n    print(\"YES\" if all(('B' in p and 'R' in p) for p in line) else \"NO\")\n\nThus, the missing code is the loop that iterates t times, reads n and s, processes them, and prints the result.\n\nSo the correct code to fill in is:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    parts = [part for part in s.split('W') if part]\n    ok = all(('B' in p and 'R' in p) for p in parts)\n    print(\"YES\" if ok else \"NO\")\n\nBut the user's existing code is written as:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    num = int(input())\n    line = [elem for elem in input().split(\"W\") if elem != \"\"]\n    print(\"YES\" if all([\"B\" in elem and \"R\" in elem for elem in line]) else \"NO\")\n\nBut the for loop is missing the loop variable and the range. So the correct code to fill in would be adding the loop over t test cases.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    line = [elem for elem in s.split('W') if elem]\n    valid = all(('B' in part and 'R' in part) for part in line)\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut in the user's code, they have:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    num = int(input())\n    line = [elem for elem in input().split(\"W\") if elem != \"\"]\n    print(\"YES\" if all([\"B\" in elem and \"R\" in elem for elem in line]) else \"NO\")\n\nWhich suggests that the code inside the loop is already written. So the missing part is the loop structure. The user's code must be modified to include the loop.\n\nThus, the correct code to fill in is the loop over t test cases, which includes the code that processes each test case.\n\nSo the code should start by reading t, then loop t times. So the missing code is:\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    s = input().strip()\n    line = [part for part in s.split('W') if part]\n    print(\"YES\" if all('B' in p and 'R' in p for p in line) else \"NO\")\n\nSo the answer is to output these lines as plain text, not markdown."
