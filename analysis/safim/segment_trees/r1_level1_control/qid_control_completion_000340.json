So let's split the sum into even and odd terms. Alternatively, let's see for n:\n\nIf n is even, say n=2k. Then for the first 2k elements:\nNumbers 1,2,...,2k. The sum would be (ceil(1/2) + ceil(2/2)) + (ceil(3/2) + ceil(4/2)) + ... + (ceil((2k-1)/2) + ceil(2k/2)). Each pair (2m-1, 2m) contributes ( ( (2m-1 +1)/2 ) + (2m/2 )) = (m) + m = 2m. So for each pair, sum is 2m, where m ranges from 1 to k. The sum over m from 1 to k of 2m is 2*(k(k+1)/2) ) = k(k+1). Since k = n/2, sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = (n/2)( (n+2)/2 ) = n(n+2)/4. If n is odd, say n=2k+1. Then the first 2k terms sum to k(k+1), and the last term is ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1. So total sum is k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) = (k+1)^2. Since n=2k+1, k = (n-1)/2. So ( ( (n-1)/2 +1 ) ) \u00b2 = ( (n+1)/2 )\u00b2 = (n+1)^2 /4. So for even n: S(n) = n(n+2)/4. For odd n: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2. So the sum S(n) can be written as: If n is even: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) ) If n is odd: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2. Wait, let's check for n=5 (as in the example). For n=5 (odd), (5+1)/2=3, 3\u00b2=9.

No, because the sum of the subset would be <= S(n). So the maximum possible s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), because the sum can't exceed S(n). So the answer is the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= S(n). So the problem reduces to computing S(n) as per the even and odd cases, then compute the integer square root of S(n). So the steps are: For each test case, given n:\n\n1. Compute S(n) based on whether n is even or odd.\n2. Compute the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S(n). 3. Output s.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this s efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1e9, which makes S(n) up to (1e9+1)^2 /4 for odd n, which is about (1e9)^2 = 1e18, so s can be up to 1e9. But even for such large numbers, we can compute s using binary search. Alternatively, since S(n) can be written as: If n is even:\nS(n) = (n/2)*(n/2 + 1) = (n\u00b2 + 2n)/4. If n is odd:\nS(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2. So for even n, S(n) is (n/2)(n/2 +1). For example, n=4: S(n)= (4/2)(4/2+1) = 2*3=6. Which sum is 1+1+2+2 =6. Correct. So for even n: S(n) is (n/2)(n/2 + 1) = k(k+1), where k = n/2. For odd n: S(n) is (k+1)^2, where k = (n-1)/2. Because (n+1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 = k+1. So S(n) is (k+1)^2. So, for even n, S(n) is a product of two consecutive integers. For example, n=4: 2*3=6. Now, for even n: S(n) = k*(k+1), and we need to find s where s\u00b2 <= k(k+1). k(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k, since k\u00b2 <k(k+1) < (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1, so the floor is k.\n\nWait, for example, k=2: 2*3=6. sqrt(6) \u2248 2.449. Floor is 2. So s=2. But 2\u00b2=4 <=6, and 3\u00b2=9>6. So yes, the maximum s is 2. But wait, in that case, for even n, the maximum s is k, which is n/2. Because k*(k+1) is the sum. So the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)) is k. But for example, k=3: 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. floor is 3. So s=3. 3\u00b2=9<=12, 4\u00b2=16>12. So for even n, s is k =n/2. But wait, what about k*(k+1) >= s^2, which is k\u00b2. Then s can be k. So the answer for even n is k =n/2. But wait, let's check:\n\nIf n is even, then S(n) = k*(k+1), where k =n/2. The maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ). But when is sqrt(k(k+1)) an integer?",

Example 1: n=1. (1+1)//2=1. Correct. Example 2: n=5. (5+1)//2=3. Correct. Example 3: n=4. (4+1)//2=2. Correct. Example 4: n=3. (3+1)//2=2. Correct. But wait, let's take n=6. (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. floor is 3. Correct. So for even n, (n+1)//2 gives the correct answer. For odd n, same. So the formula for the maximum s is (n+1)//2. Wait, that's a huge simplification! So the answer is simply (n+1)//2 for all n? But why does that work? Because:\n\nFor even n, sum is k*(k+1) = (n/2)*(n/2 +1). The square root is sqrt(k^2 +k). Since k^2 +k < (k+1)^2, the floor is k. And (n+1)/2 = (2k+1)/2 \u2192 k.5. But integer division truncates, so (n+1)//2 is k. So it's correct. For odd n, sum is (k+1)^2, where k+1 = (n+1)/2. So sqrt is (n+1)/2, which is integer. So floor is (n+1)/2. Which is (n+1)//2. So regardless of even or odd, the maximum s is (n+1)//2. Wait, this can't be. Let's take n=2. sum is 1+1=2. s^2 must be <=2. s=1. (2+1)//2=1.5 \u2192 integer division is 1. Correct. n=6: sum is 3*4=12. s=3. (6+1)//2=3. Correct. n=5: sum 9 \u21923. (5+1)/2=3. Correct. n=7: sum is ((7+1)/2)^2=4\u00b2=16. s=4. (7+1)//2=4. Correct. So the answer is (n+1) divided by 2, using integer division. So the code can be written as: For each a (n), compute (a+1)/2. But wait, how does that work for even and odd? In C++, (a+1)/2 when a is even and a is even. For example, a=4: (4+1)/2 =5/2=2 in integer division. Yes. So the code can be written as:\n\nif ( (a+1)/2 * (a+1)/2 <= sum ) then output (a+1)/2. But according to our analysis, the answer is (a+1)/2. Wait, but why? Because for even a, sum is (a/2)*(a/2 +1). So (a/2)*(a/2 +1) > = (a/2)^2. So sqrt( sum ) is >= a/2. But in that case, the maximum s is floor( sqrt( sum ) ), which is a/2. Because sum is k*(k+1) where k =a/2. So the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)) is k. So s is k. But (a+1)/2 when a is even is (a+1)/2. For a even, (a+1) is odd. So (a+1)/2 is a/2 + 0.5. But integer division truncates, so (a+1)/2 is a/2 when a is even. Wait, for a=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division in C++ truncates to 2. Yes. So (a+1)/2 for even a is a/2, which is the correct answer. So regardless of even or odd, the answer is (a+1)//2. Thus, the code can be simplified to just output (a+1)/2 in integer division. Wait, but how to implement that in C++? In C++, (a+1)/2 is the same as (a+1) divided by 2, using integer division. For even a:\n\na=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=5/2=2 (since 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, but integer division truncates to 2). For a=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=6/2=3. So (a+1)/2 in C++ is exactly (a+1)//2. So the code can be written as: For each test case:\n\nRead a.\n\ns = (a+1)/2. Output s.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test n=5. sum is 9, s is 3. (5+1)/2=3. Correct. n=6: sum is 3*4=12. s is 3. (6+1)/2=3.5 \u21923. Correct.\n\nn=3: sum is 4. s=2. (3+1)/2=2. Correct. n=7: sum 16. s=4. (7+1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: sum is 2. s=1. (2+1)/2=1.5 \u21921. Correct.\n\nn=1: sum=1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct. So in all cases, the answer is (a+1)/2 using integer division. So the code can be written as: For each test case, output (a+1)/2. But wait, why does the code given in the problem have a conditional? The code provided is:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) cout<<a/2<<endl;\nelse cout<<a/2 + 1<<endl;\n\nSo the code seems to check some condition. If true, output a/2, else output a/2 +1. But according to our analysis, the answer is (a+1)/2. Which can be written as a/2 when a is even (since (a+1)/2 would be a/2 + 0.5, but integer division truncates). Wait no, a is even, a+1 is odd, so (a+1)/2 = (2k+1)/2 =k.5 \u2192 in integer division, it's k. But a/2 is k. So (a+1)/2 in integer division is same as a/2 when a is even. Because (a even) \u2192 a=2k. So (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5 \u2192 integer division truncates to k. So (a+1)/2 is k, which is same as a/2. For odd a: a=2k+1. (a+1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 =k+1.",

But the code provided in the problem has:\n\nif(/* TODO: condition */) cout<<a/2<<endl;\nelse cout<<a/2 +1<<endl;\n\nSo the code is equivalent to outputting (a+1)/2. So the missing condition is whether a is even.",

So the code would be:\n\nif (a % 2 == 0) cout << a/2 << endl;\nelse cout << a/2 +1 << endl; But wait, in the code, the variables are of type ll (long long). So a is a long long. So modulo operator works as expected. So the missing code is (a % 2 == 0), but in C++, the modulo operator can be negative for negative numbers, but since a is given as a positive integer (as per input constraints), it's safe. Thus, the answer is to fill the 'if' condition with (a % 2 == 0). But let's test this with some examples:\n\nSample Input 1: n=1. Condition: 1 is odd \u2192 else clause. a/2 is 0, +1 \u21921. Correct. Sample Input 2: n=5 \u2192 odd. a/2=2, +1 \u21923. Correct. Sample Input n=4 \u2192 even. 4/2=2. Correct. Sample Input n=6 \u2192 even. 6/2=3. Correct. So this logic works.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says we have n wooden blocks. Each block i has a height of 1 and a length of ceil(i/2). We need to find the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using some of these blocks. The square's area is side^2, and since each block contributes 1xceil(i/2) units, the total area covered by the blocks is the sum of their lengths (since height is 1, each contributes length * 1). So the sum of all the lengths of the chosen blocks should be at least side^2. The maximum possible side is the largest integer s where the sum of the lengths of the selected blocks is >= s^2.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to find is the sum of the lengths of the first k blocks (for some k up to n), and then find the largest s such that this sum >= s\u00b2. But since the blocks are given in order, perhaps the optimal way is to take the first m blocks (for some m) and sum their lengths, then find s.\n\nWait, but the blocks are numbered 1 to n. Each block i has length ceil(i/2). So the sum S(n) is the sum from i=1 to n of ceil(i/2). Let's compute this sum for a given n.\n\nLet's think about how to compute S(n). For even i, ceil(i/2) is i/2. For odd i, it's (i+1)/2. So let's split the sum into even and odd terms.\n\nAlternatively, let's see for n:\n\nIf n is even, say n=2k. Then for the first 2k elements:\nNumbers 1,2,...,2k.\n\nThe sum would be (ceil(1/2) + ceil(2/2)) + (ceil(3/2) + ceil(4/2)) + ... + (ceil((2k-1)/2) + ceil(2k/2)).\n\nEach pair (2m-1, 2m) contributes ( ( (2m-1 +1)/2 ) + (2m/2 )) = (m) + m = 2m. So for each pair, sum is 2m, where m ranges from 1 to k. The sum over m from 1 to k of 2m is 2*(k(k+1)/2) ) = k(k+1). Since k = n/2, sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = (n/2)( (n+2)/2 ) = n(n+2)/4.\n\nIf n is odd, say n=2k+1. Then the first 2k terms sum to k(k+1), and the last term is ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1. So total sum is k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k +1) = (k+1)^2. Since n=2k+1, k = (n-1)/2. So ( ( (n-1)/2 +1 ) )\u00b2 = ( (n+1)/2 )\u00b2 = (n+1)^2 /4.\n\nSo for even n: S(n) = n(n+2)/4.\nFor odd n: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo the sum S(n) can be written as:\nIf n is even: S(n) = (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) )\nIf n is odd: S(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nWait, let's check for n=5 (as in the example). For n=5 (odd), (5+1)/2=3, 3\u00b2=9. The example in the problem statement: sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. Correct. For n=5, the sum is 9. So that works.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that S(n) >= s\u00b2. Because the sum of all the blocks is S(n), and we can't use more than n blocks, the maximum possible s is the floor of the square root of S(n), but perhaps not exactly. Wait, no. Because even if S(n) is exactly a square, then s is sqrt(S(n)), but if not, we have the largest s where s\u00b2 <= S(n).\n\nBut wait, the sum of the lengths is S(n). Since each block is 1 unit high, stacking them vertically (each block's height is 1, so to get a square of s x s, we need s layers of blocks. Each layer's total length must be >= s. Wait, no. Wait, the square's area is s\u00b2. Each block contributes 1 * length. So the total sum of lengths is the area. So sum of all selected lengths must be >= s\u00b2. But since the square is s x s, the sum must be at least s\u00b2. So the maximum s is the largest integer s such that s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nSo s is the integer part of the square root of sum, but perhaps there's a case where sum is between s\u00b2 and (s+1)^2. So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(sum) ).\n\nWait, but sum is exactly S(n). So the maximum possible s is the floor of the square root of S(n).\n\nWait, no. Because sum is S(n) (when using all n blocks). So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), but maybe using a subset of the blocks gives a larger sum? No, because the sum of the subset would be <= S(n). So the maximum possible s is floor( sqrt(S(n)) ), because the sum can't exceed S(n). So the answer is the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= S(n).\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing S(n) as per the even and odd cases, then compute the integer square root of S(n).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each test case, given n:\n\n1. Compute S(n) based on whether n is even or odd.\n2. Compute the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S(n).\n3. Output s.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this s efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1e9, which makes S(n) up to (1e9+1)^2 /4 for odd n, which is about (1e9)^2 = 1e18, so s can be up to 1e9.\n\nBut even for such large numbers, we can compute s using binary search.\n\nAlternatively, since S(n) can be written as:\n\nIf n is even:\nS(n) = (n/2)*(n/2 + 1) = (n\u00b2 + 2n)/4.\n\nIf n is odd:\nS(n) = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo for even n, S(n) is (n/2)(n/2 +1). For example, n=4: S(n)= (4/2)(4/2+1) = 2*3=6. Which sum is 1+1+2+2 =6. Correct.\n\nSo for even n: S(n) is (n/2)(n/2 + 1) = k(k+1), where k = n/2.\n\nFor odd n: S(n) is (k+1)^2, where k = (n-1)/2. Because (n+1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 = k+1. So S(n) is (k+1)^2.\n\nSo, for even n, S(n) is a product of two consecutive integers. For example, n=4: 2*3=6.\n\nNow, for even n: S(n) = k*(k+1), and we need to find s where s\u00b2 <= k(k+1).\n\nk(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k, since k\u00b2 <k(k+1) < (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1, so the floor is k.\n\nWait, for example, k=2: 2*3=6. sqrt(6) \u2248 2.449. Floor is 2. So s=2. But 2\u00b2=4 <=6, and 3\u00b2=9>6. So yes, the maximum s is 2.\n\nBut wait, in that case, for even n, the maximum s is k, which is n/2. Because k*(k+1) is the sum. So the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)) is k.\n\nBut for example, k=3: 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. floor is 3. So s=3. 3\u00b2=9<=12, 4\u00b2=16>12.\n\nSo for even n, s is k =n/2. But wait, what about k*(k+1) >= s^2, which is k\u00b2. Then s can be k. So the answer for even n is k =n/2. But wait, let's check:\n\nIf n is even, then S(n) = k*(k+1), where k =n/2. The maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ). But when is sqrt(k(k+1)) an integer? Well, k and k+1 are coprimes, so their product is a square only if both are squares, which isn't possible. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is not integer. So floor is k, because k\u00b2 <k(k+1) < (k+1)^2.\n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2.\n\nFor odd n, S(n) is (k+1)^2, where k=(n-1)/2. Then the square root is exactly k+1. So the maximum s is k+1. For example, n=5: S(n) =9. s=3. Correct.\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nIf n is even, then the maximum s is n/2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for even n, the sum is k(k+1), which is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. The floor of the square root is k. So s is k. Which is n/2.\n\nBut wait, the sum is k(k+1). So the maximum s is floor( sqrt(k(k+1)) ) =k, since k^2 <k(k+1) < (k+1)^2. So yes.\n\nSo for even n, the answer is k =n/2.\n\nFor odd n, the sum is ( (n+1)/2 )^2. So the square root is (n+1)/2. So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. But since n is odd, (n+1)/2 is an integer. For example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nSo the maximum s is:\n\nIf n is even: n/2.\n\nIf n is odd: (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: n=5. The sum is 9. So s=3. Which is (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nSample Input 1: n=1. Sum is 1. So s=1. Which is (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. Sum is (3+1)/2 squared \u2192 2^2=4. So s=2. Which is correct. The blocks are 1,1,2. Sum 4. So 2x2 square.\n\nSo in all cases, when n is even, the maximum s is n/2. When n is odd, it's (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is even but the sum is such that s can be higher than n/2?\n\nWait, for example, take n=6 (even). sum is (6/2)*(6/2 +1)=3*4=12. The square root of 12 is ~3.464. So floor is 3, which is n/2=3. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example, n=2: sum is 1+1=2. s=1. Which is 2/2=1. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, s is n/2.\n\nFor odd n, s is (n+1)/2.\n\nWait, but this seems to contradict the first part. Because for even n, the sum is k*(k+1), which is S(n) for even n, and the maximum s is k =n/2. For odd n, sum is (k+1)^2, so s is k+1 = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\ns = (n+1)//2 when n is odd, and n//2 when even?\n\nWait, but (n+1)/2 when n is odd is (n//2) +1. Because for n odd, n//2 is (n-1)/2. So (n+1)/2 is (n//2) +1.\n\nSo putting it all together, the maximum s can be written as (n+1)//2 for all n. Wait, no. Because for even n, (n+1)//2 is (n+1)/2, which is not the same as n/2.\n\nWait, for example, n=4. (4+1)//2 is 2.5 floored to 2 in integer division. Wait, but (n+1)//2 when n is even is (4+1)/2=2.5, but integer division in C++ would be 2. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is (n+1)//2. But for n=4, (4+1)//2 is 2, which is same as 4//2=2. So for even n, (n//2) is the same as (n+1)//2? Let's check:\n\nn=4: 4//2=2. (4+1)//2=5//2=2 (integer division). So yes. So for even n, (n//2) equals (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let's compute (n+1)//2 for even and odd n.\n\nIf n is even:\n\nn = 2k. (n+1)/2 = (2k+1)/2. So integer division in C++ truncates towards zero. So (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5 \u2192 integer division is k.\n\nBut n//2 is k. So for even n, (n+1)/2 is k.5, but in integer division, it's k. So (n+1)//2 =k. Which is same as n//2.\n\nFor example, n=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 2 in integer division.\n\nn=6: (6+1)/2=3.5 \u21923.\n\nn//2 is 4//2=2, 6//2=3. So (n+1)//2 is 4//2 + 0.5? Wait, no. Wait, 4//2 is 2. (4+1)//2 is 5//2=2.5 \u2192 integer division truncates to 2.\n\nSo for even n, (n+1)//2 is equal to n//2. So for even n, (n//2) is same as (n+1)//2.\n\nFor odd n:\n\nn=2k+1. (n+1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 =k+1. So integer division is k+1.\n\nSo for even n, (n//2) is equal to (n+1)//2, and for odd n, (n//2) is k, and (n+1)//2 is k+1.\n\nSo combining even and odd cases, the maximum s is (n+1)//2 for all n.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nBecause for even n:\n\nsum is k*(k+1), where k =n//2. So s is floor(sqrt(k*(k+1))) =k. Which is n//2.\n\nWhich is equal to (n+1)//2. Because for even n, (n+1)//2 is (2k+1)//2 =k.\n\nYes. For even n, (n+1)//2 is (2k +1) //2 \u2192 k.\n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nFor odd n, sum is (k+1)^2, where k=(n-1)/2. So s =k+1 = (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2. Which is (n+1)//2.\n\nSo in all cases, the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, this can't be. Let's test some examples.\n\nExample 1: n=1. (1+1)//2=1. Correct.\n\nExample 2: n=5. (5+1)//2=3. Correct.\n\nExample 3: n=4. (4+1)//2=2. Correct.\n\nExample 4: n=3. (3+1)//2=2. Correct.\n\nBut wait, let's take n=6. (6+1)//2=3.5 \u2192 integer division gives 3. sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464. floor is 3. Correct.\n\nSo for even n, (n+1)//2 gives the correct answer. For odd n, same.\n\nSo the formula for the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, that's a huge simplification! So the answer is simply (n+1)//2 for all n?\n\nBut why does that work?\n\nBecause:\n\nFor even n, sum is k*(k+1) = (n/2)*(n/2 +1). The square root is sqrt(k^2 +k). Since k^2 +k < (k+1)^2, the floor is k. And (n+1)/2 = (2k+1)/2 \u2192 k.5. But integer division truncates, so (n+1)//2 is k. So it's correct.\n\nFor odd n, sum is (k+1)^2, where k+1 = (n+1)/2. So sqrt is (n+1)/2, which is integer. So floor is (n+1)/2. Which is (n+1)//2.\n\nSo regardless of even or odd, the maximum s is (n+1)//2.\n\nWait, this can't be. Let's take n=2. sum is 1+1=2. s^2 must be <=2. s=1. (2+1)//2=1.5 \u2192 integer division is 1. Correct.\n\nn=6: sum is 3*4=12. s=3. (6+1)//2=3. Correct.\n\nn=5: sum 9 \u21923. (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=7: sum is ((7+1)/2)^2=4\u00b2=16. s=4. (7+1)//2=4. Correct.\n\nSo the answer is (n+1) divided by 2, using integer division.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nFor each a (n), compute (a+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, how does that work for even and odd?\n\nIn C++, (a+1)/2 when a is even and a is even.\n\nFor example, a=4: (4+1)/2 =5/2=2 in integer division.\n\nYes. So the code can be written as:\n\nif ( (a+1)/2 * (a+1)/2 <= sum ) then output (a+1)/2.\n\nBut according to our analysis, the answer is (a+1)/2.\n\nWait, but why? Because for even a, sum is (a/2)*(a/2 +1). So (a/2)*(a/2 +1) >= (a/2)^2. So sqrt( sum ) is >= a/2. But in that case, the maximum s is floor( sqrt( sum ) ), which is a/2.\n\nBecause sum is k*(k+1) where k =a/2. So the floor of sqrt(k*(k+1)) is k. So s is k.\n\nBut (a+1)/2 when a is even is (a+1)/2. For a even, (a+1) is odd. So (a+1)/2 is a/2 + 0.5. But integer division truncates, so (a+1)/2 is a/2 when a is even.\n\nWait, for a=4: (4+1)/2=2.5 \u2192 integer division in C++ truncates to 2.\n\nYes. So (a+1)/2 for even a is a/2, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo regardless of even or odd, the answer is (a+1)//2.\n\nThus, the code can be simplified to just output (a+1)/2 in integer division.\n\nWait, but how to implement that in C++?\n\nIn C++, (a+1)/2 is the same as (a+1) divided by 2, using integer division. For even a:\n\na=4 \u2192 (4+1)/2=5/2=2 (since 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, but integer division truncates to 2).\n\nFor a=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=6/2=3.\n\nSo (a+1)/2 in C++ is exactly (a+1)//2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead a.\n\ns = (a+1)/2.\n\nOutput s.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test n=5. sum is 9, s is 3. (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nn=6: sum is 3*4=12. s is 3. (6+1)/2=3.5 \u21923. Correct.\n\nn=3: sum is 4. s=2. (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nn=7: sum 16. s=4. (7+1)/2=4. Correct.\n\nn=2: sum is 2. s=1. (2+1)/2=1.5 \u21921. Correct.\n\nn=1: sum=1. (1+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nSo in all cases, the answer is (a+1)/2 using integer division.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nFor each test case, output (a+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, why does the code given in the problem have a conditional?\n\nThe code provided is:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) cout<<a/2<<endl;\nelse cout<<a/2 + 1<<endl;\n\nSo the code seems to check some condition. If true, output a/2, else output a/2 +1.\n\nBut according to our analysis, the answer is (a+1)/2. Which can be written as a/2 when a is even (since (a+1)/2 would be a/2 + 0.5, but integer division truncates). Wait no, a is even, a+1 is odd, so (a+1)/2 = (2k+1)/2 =k.5 \u2192 in integer division, it's k.\n\nBut a/2 is k. So (a+1)/2 in integer division is same as a/2 when a is even. Because (a even) \u2192 a=2k. So (2k+1)/2 =k +0.5 \u2192 integer division truncates to k. So (a+1)/2 is k, which is same as a/2.\n\nFor odd a: a=2k+1. (a+1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 =k+1. Which is a/2 +1, since a/2 is k (since 2k+1 divided by 2 is k.5 \u2192 truncates to k).\n\nSo in code:\n\n(a+1)/2 is equal to:\n\nif a is even: a/2.\n\nif a is odd: (a/2) +1.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ncout << (a+1)/2 << endl;\n\nBut in C++, when you divide integers, 5/2 is 2. So (a+1)/2 would be (a+1) divided by 2.\n\nSo the code can replace the condition with:\n\nif (a % 2 == 0) then a/2 else (a/2) +1.\n\nBut (a+1)/2 in code would do exactly that.\n\nBut the code provided in the problem has:\n\nif(/* TODO: condition */) cout<<a/2<<endl;\nelse cout<<a/2 +1<<endl;\n\nSo the code is equivalent to outputting (a+1)/2.\n\nSo the missing condition is whether a is even. Because for even a, (a+1)/2 is a/2, and for odd a, it's a/2 +1.\n\nBut according to our analysis, the correct answer is (a+1)/2 in all cases. So the code can be replaced with simply:\n\ncout << (a+1)/2 << endl;\n\nBut the code provided uses a conditional to output a/2 or a/2 +1. So the condition is when a is even, output a/2, else output a/2 +1.\n\nSo the condition for the 'if' is (a is even). Because when a is even, (a+1)/2 is a/2, and the code outputs a/2. When a is odd, the code outputs a/2 +1.\n\nSo the condition is (a % 2 == 0).\n\nSo the missing code in the 'if' condition is whether a is even.\n\nThus, the code should check if a is even. If yes, output a/2. Else, output a/2 +1.\n\nBut wait, according to our analysis, this would be correct.\n\nYes. Because:\n\nIf a is even: answer is a/2.\n\nIf a is odd: answer is (a/2) +1.\n\nBut according to the problem, the answer is (a+1)/2. So in code, (a+1)/2 would be equal to (a/2) when a is even, and (a/2 +1) when a is odd. Because for even a, (a+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 k.5 \u2192 integer division truncates to k, which is a/2. For odd a, (a+1)/2 is (2k+1+1)/2 = (2k+2)/2 =k+1 =a/2 +1.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct, and the condition is to check if a is even.\n\nSo the missing condition is if (a % 2 == 0), but wait, no. Wait:\n\nIf a is even, then the answer is a/2.\n\nIf a is odd, the answer is (a/2 +1).\n\nSo the code's if statement is checking whether to output a/2 (when a is even) or a/2 +1 (when a is odd).\n\nBut according to our analysis, the answer is always (a+1)/2.\n\nBut in code, for a even:\n\n(a+1)/2 is (even +1)/2. For example, a=4: (5)/2=2.5 \u2192 2 in integer division. Which is 4/2=2. So code's first case.\n\nFor a odd: a=5 \u2192 (5+1)/2=3. Which is 5/2=2 (since 5/2 is 2.5 \u2192 2) +1 \u21923. So code's second case.\n\nSo in code, the 'if' condition should be whether (a+1)/2 is equal to a/2. Which is only true when a is even.\n\nAlternatively, the condition is (a is even).\n\nSo the code's 'if' condition is whether a is even. If yes, output a/2. Else, output a/2 +1.\n\nThus, the missing code in the 'if' is (a % 2 == 0).\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nif (a % 2 == 0) cout << a/2 << endl;\nelse cout << a/2 +1 << endl;\n\nBut wait, in the code, the variables are of type ll (long long). So a is a long long. So modulo operator works as expected.\n\nSo the missing code is (a % 2 == 0), but in C++, the modulo operator can be negative for negative numbers, but since a is given as a positive integer (as per input constraints), it's safe.\n\nThus, the answer is to fill the 'if' condition with (a % 2 == 0).\n\nBut let's test this with some examples:\n\nSample Input 1: n=1.\n\nCondition: 1 is odd \u2192 else clause. a/2 is 0, +1 \u21921. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: n=5 \u2192 odd. a/2=2, +1 \u21923. Correct.\n\nSample Input n=4 \u2192 even. 4/2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input n=6 \u2192 even. 6/2=3. Correct.\n\nSo this logic works.\n\nBut according to our analysis, the answer is (a+1)/2. So why not output (a+1)/2 directly, which would avoid the conditional?\n\nBecause the code given already has the conditional. So the user has to fill in the condition.\n\nBut perhaps in code, the 'if' statement is checking whether (a+1)/2 is equal to a/2. Which is only true when a is even.\n\nAlternatively, the code could compute (a+1)/2 and output that. But given that the code structure is as provided, the correct condition is whether a is even.\n\nThus, the missing code is (a % 2 == 0)."
