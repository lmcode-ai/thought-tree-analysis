For \"BRB\", len(set(x)) is 2 (B and R and B \u2192 set is {'B','R'}, so len is 2. So the code would not trigger the \"any\" condition, thus output \"YES\". But according to the problem statement, in the fifth test case the answer is YES. So the code seems to output \"YES\" in that case. But why does the code check if any split segment has all characters the same? Because if a split segment has all characters the same (like \"RRR\"), then it's impossible. Because each stamp application adds an R and a B. So how can a segment of all R's or all B's exist? Because each stamp application toggles the colors, but if a segment is all R's, that's impossible. For example, if you have a segment \"RRR\", then according to the code's check, len(set(x))==1 would be True, so the code outputs \"NO\".

But the code given in the initial sample code is:\n\nprint(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\") So if any of the non-W segments have all characters the same (like \"RR\"), then output \"NO\". Otherwise, \"YES\". So according to that code, a segment like \"RRB\" would be allowed (since len(set(x)) is 2), but \"RR\" is not allowed. But according to our previous example, it's possible to have a segment like \"RR\" if you apply the stamp twice.",

So the code's logic is correct. The necessary and sufficient condition is:\n\n1. Each non-W segment must have at least two characters (so that they can be covered by at least one stamp). Wait, no. Because the code does not check for the length of the segments. For example, if a segment is \"R\", the code's split would split it into a part of length 1, and len(set(x)) ==1, so the code outputs \"NO\". But if a segment is \"RB\", the code outputs \"YES\". But why does the code not check the length of the segments? Because a segment of length 1 is impossible. For example, \"R\" cannot be formed, since any stamp must cover two cells.",

So the code provided in the initial sample is correct. The missing part is the loop over the test cases. Because the code provided is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\") So the code needs to loop over t test cases. But the code starts with 'for' and then a missing part. So the missing code is the loop over the test cases. The correct code would read t, then loop t times. But looking at the code skeleton provided:\n\nThe code after the missing lines reads l = int(input()), which is the n for the test case. Then reads the string s.\n\nBut the code in the original problem's input is: The first line contains t, then for each test case, the first line is n, the second line is s. So the code should read t, then loop t times. For each iteration, read n (but not used), then read s, split into parts, check each part. But the code provided in the code skeleton reads l = int(input()), which is n, but then ignores it. Then reads s as the next line. So the correct code is:\n\nRead t, then loop t times. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\nBecause the first line of input is t. The code should read that t, then loop t times. So the complete code is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any(len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') if x) else \"YES\") Wait, but the code as written in the initial code skeleton is:\n\nprint(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\") But this would split the string into parts, and for each part (even empty parts), check len(set(x)) == 1.",

Each of these is considered. But len(set('')) is 0 (since empty string has no characters). So the condition len(set(x)) ==1 would be false. So empty parts are ignored. But what if the string is \"WW\"? Then split('W') gives ['', '', ''], which are all empty. So the any(...) would evaluate to false, so print \"YES\". But according to the problem statement, a string of all W's is possible by not using any stamps. So it's allowed. So the code's approach outputs \"YES\" correctly.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining whether a given final picture of cells can be achieved by using a stamp multiple times. The stamp affects two adjacent cells, turning one red and the other blue, but each stamp application can be rotated. Each use of the stamp can overwrite previous colors. \n\nThe key here is to find out the necessary conditions that the final string must satisfy for it to be possible to create using the stamp operations.\n\nLet me think about the properties that a valid string must have. \n\nFirst, any cell that's white (W) in the final string can't be part of any stamp operation. Because each time the stamp is applied, the cells under it are colored either R and B or B and R. So after any number of stamps, a white cell is impossible. Wait, the initial cells are white. But each stamp application changes two cells to R and B. So any W in the final string would mean that those cells were never stamped. Wait, but the initial state is all white. So if a cell is white in the final state, that implies that it was never stamped. But because stamps can be applied anywhere, but only to pairs of adjacent cells. So for example, if a cell is W, then all its adjacent cells must not have been part of any stamp operation that includes it. Hmm, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nWait, each time you apply the stamp to two adjacent cells, you're changing their colors. So even if you apply the stamp multiple times to the same pair, each application will toggle their colors. For example, first applying RB, then applying BR would turn them back. But applying RB again would set them to RB once more. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the two cells are white. First, applying the stamp as RB: they become R and B. If then apply BR (the other orientation), they become B and R. If you apply RB again, they become R and B again. So each application flips the colors of those two cells. So the parity of the number of times the stamp is applied to a pair matters. Even number of applications would cancel each other out. So if a cell is white, that's only possible if it was never stamped. Because once stamped, even multiple times, if the count is even, the color would be determined by the initial application. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nWait the initial state is white. Suppose we have a cell that is part of some stamp operations. Let's say the cell is in position i. Each time it's stamped with a neighbor (i and i+1, or i-1 and i), each such application affects its color. So a cell can only be W if the number of times it was stamped (each application toggles its color) leaves it white. But initially, it's white. So each stamp application that includes the cell will toggle its color. So for it to end up white, the total number of stamps applied to it (i.e., the number of times the cell is part of a stamp pair) must be even. Wait, but each stamp application affects two cells. So for example, if a cell is part of a stamp applied k times, then each application changes its color. So starting from white, after k times, if k is even, it's white again. If k is odd, it's either R or B, depending on the direction of the stamps. Wait, but each stamp could be applied in either direction. So the parity (even or odd) of the number of times the cell is stamped determines its color. Because each stamp application flips the color. So for a cell to end up as W, it must have been stamped an even number of times (so even flips: white \u2192 R/B \u2192 ... \u2192 white). But how can that happen?\n\nWait, the initial state is white. So each time a cell is stamped, it's toggled. So for example:\n\nIf the cell is stamped once: color changes from W to R or B (depending on the stamp's orientation).\n\nIf stamped again (same or different pair), it changes again. So two stamps would make it back to W. But wait, wait. Let me think. Let's take a cell that's part of two stamp operations. Suppose the first stamp is on (i, i+1), applying RB. The cell i becomes R. Then, a second stamp on (i-1, i) applying BR. The cell i is now B. So two stamps, but the color is B. So the parity isn't the only factor. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as: the final configuration must satisfy certain constraints based on the parity of the colors in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: think about the transitions between the cells. Since each stamp application affects two adjacent cells, the colors must alternate in some way.\n\nWait, each stamp application changes two adjacent cells. Let's say we model the colors as R=1, B=0, W=invalid. Wait, maybe not. Let's think in terms of possible color transitions.\n\nAlternatively, since each stamp flips the two adjacent cells (from whatever they were before), the final color of each cell is determined by the parity of the number of times it was stamped. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key observation is that any R and B in the string must be in such a way that the transitions between R and B are possible given the stamp operations.\n\nFor example, after all stamps are applied, the pattern must be such that between any two non-W cells, the colors alternate. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells. Let's see.\n\nWait, let's consider the case where there are no W's. For example, a string like R B R B. How was this possible? Each stamp application adds an R/B pair. But applying multiple stamps can lead to various combinations.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of the positions must have a certain relationship. For example, in a valid string, all R's must be in positions of the same parity. But maybe not. Let's see.\n\nWait, suppose we have a string R B R B. This could be achieved by stamping each pair once. But if the string is R R B B, that's impossible. Because each stamp application introduces an R and B. So perhaps the number of R's and B's must be equal, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the sample input, the first test case was B R B B W. So after three stamps, the first two are BR, then BR again (maybe) leading to B R B B. So the count here is B:3, R:1, but that's possible. So the count of R and B isn't the main factor.\n\nAnother idea: the pattern must consist of segments of non-W characters, and each such segment must have a length of at least 2. Because, you can't have a single non-W character. Because each stamp affects two cells. So any single non-W cell in the final string (without adjacent non-W cells) is impossible. For example, if the string is W R W, that's impossible. Because to create the R, you must have stamped it with a neighbor, but that neighbor would then be B. So the R would have to have a neighbor that's B, but in this case it's W, which is invalid.\n\nSo that's one condition. So in the given string, all non-W segments must have length at least 2. So for example, if the string is \"WBRBWWBR\", then between the Ws, the non-W parts must be of even or odd length but at least 2? Or wait, perhaps even or odd is possible. Wait, the sample input fifth case is \"BRB\", which is three characters. How was that possible? Let's see.\n\nIn the fifth test case explanation, they applied the stamp to the middle two (WWW \u2192 WRB), then to the first two (W becomes B, R becomes R?), but wait. Let me recheck that example.\n\nThe fifth test case: initial WWW. Then they stamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 W RB. Then stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 BR B. So the final string is BR B. So the non-W part is BRB, which is three characters. So a segment of length 3 is possible. So that's allowed.\n\nHmm. So the length of the non-W segments can be any as long as it's at least 2. Wait, but what about a segment of length 1? Like R. That's impossible. Because to get R, there must have been a stamp on R and its neighbor. So any R or B in the final string must be part of a pair. So each non-W segment must have length >=2. So in the code, perhaps the first check is to split the string into parts separated by W's, and check that each part has length at least 2. But wait, no. For example, the sample fifth case is \"BRB\" which is a single segment of length 3. That's allowed. But if there's a segment like \"R\", it's invalid. So the code must split the string into parts separated by W's, and for each part, if it's non-empty, then its length must be at least 2. Wait, no. Wait, the sample input has a test case where the answer is \"NO\" for a single cell. For example, test case 2,3,4 have n=1,2,2 with a single R or B. So for example, if the input is \"R\", then it's impossible. Similarly, if the input is \"RB\", then that's possible. So the code must check that all non-W segments have length >=2.\n\nWait, no. For example, \"RB\" is a valid segment (length 2). \"RBR\" (length 3) is also valid, as in the fifth test case. But a segment of length 1 is invalid. So the code must split the input into segments split by W's, and for each of those segments, check that they are of length >=2. So any occurrence of a single R or B in a segment (like \"R\" or \"B\") is invalid.\n\nWait, but what if the entire string is \"RB\", then that's valid. So yes. But if a segment is of length 1, like \"R\" in the middle of Ws, that's invalid. So the code must split on W and check that each non-empty segment has length >=2.\n\nWait, but the code in the sample code provided is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\")\n\nWait, this code is checking if any of the split parts (split by W) has all characters the same. For example, if a segment is \"RR\", then len(set(x)) ==1 \u2192 which makes the code output \"NO\". Because that's invalid. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the sample fifth case's explanation has the final string BRB, which when split by W is [\"BRB\"], and this code would check if any of the split parts has all characters the same. For \"BRB\", len(set(x)) is 2 (B and R and B \u2192 set is {'B','R'}, so len is 2. So the code would not trigger the \"any\" condition, thus output \"YES\".\n\nBut according to the problem statement, in the fifth test case the answer is YES. So the code seems to output \"YES\" in that case.\n\nBut why does the code check if any split segment has all characters the same? Because if a split segment has all characters the same (like \"RRR\"), then it's impossible. Because each stamp application adds an R and a B. So how can a segment of all R's or all B's exist? Because each stamp application toggles the colors, but if a segment is all R's, that's impossible. For example, if you have a segment \"RRR\", then according to the code's check, len(set(x))==1 would be True, so the code outputs \"NO\".\n\nSo the code's logic is to split the string into segments separated by W's. For each segment, if all characters are the same (like RRR or BBB), then it's impossible, hence output \"NO\". Otherwise, output \"YES\".\n\nBut wait, what about a segment like \"RBRB\"? len(set(x)) is 2, so the code would allow it. Which is correct, because that's possible.\n\nBut why is that the case? Let's see. For example, \"RBRB\" can be formed by applying stamps in overlapping positions. Each application adds a pair of R and B, but overlapping stamps can create a pattern like RBRB.\n\nSo the code's approach is to check for each non-W segment: if there exists a segment where all characters are the same (i.e., all R or all B), then it's impossible, else possible. So the code splits the string into parts divided by W, and for each part, check if it's all the same characters. If any such part exists, output \"NO\". Otherwise, \"YES\".\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement's sample fifth test case, the input is \"BRB\" which is split into [\"BRB\"], and len(set(x)) is 2, so the code outputs \"YES\". Which is correct.\n\nIn the second test case (n=1, s=R), split into [R], which is a segment of length 1. The code would check len(set(x)) ==1 (since x is \"R\") \u2192 true. So the code would output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\nSo the code as provided is checking two things:\n\n1. Each non-W segment must have length >=1? No. Wait, the code doesn't check the length. So for example, if a segment is \"R\", then len(set(x)) is 1, so the code outputs \"NO\". But a segment of \"RB\" would have len(set(x)) as 2, so code outputs \"YES\".\n\nBut wait, the code as written is splitting the string into parts separated by W, and then for each part, checking if all characters are the same. So even a single character part (like \"R\") would be split into a part of length 1. The code then checks if the set of characters in that part has length 1. For \"R\", yes, so the code outputs \"NO\".\n\nBut what about a part of length 2, like \"RR\"? Then the code would check if len(set(x)) ==1. Which is true. So the code would output \"NO\" in that case. But \"RR\" is invalid. Because each stamp application must result in one R and one B in the pair. So how can a segment of \"RR\" exist?\n\nWait, according to the problem's rules, each stamp application affects two adjacent cells, coloring them as R and B or B and R. Each application can be done multiple times. Let's see:\n\nIf you apply the stamp on the same pair of cells twice. For example, first apply RB: cells become R and B. Then apply RB again (same orientation): cells become B and R. Then apply RB again: R and B. So after three times, the cells would be R and B. But how can you get two R's?\n\nWait, maybe it's not possible. Because each application of the stamp to a pair changes their colors. So the parity of the number of times you apply the stamp to that pair matters. For example, if you apply an odd number of times, the pair will be in the state of the stamp's orientation (RB or BR). If even, then they could be back to white? Wait no. Because the initial state is white. So when you apply the stamp once, they become RB. Apply again (same orientation), they become BR. Apply a third time, RB again. So the pair alternates between RB and BR. So for a pair of cells, after any number of stamps, their colors are R and B in some order, but never both R or both B. So any pair that is stamped must have R and B. But if you have overlapping stamps, can you end up with a segment of RR?\n\nLet's think. Suppose the entire segment is three cells: 1,2,3. Apply stamp to 1-2 (RB \u2192 R B W), then apply to 2-3 (RB \u2192 R B R). Then apply stamp to 1-2 again (BR \u2192 B R R). Then apply to 1-2 again (RB \u2192 R B R). Wait, this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's impossible to have two adjacent cells with the same color in the final string.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. Each time you stamp a pair, you set them to R and B (or B and R). Any subsequent application on overlapping pairs can change individual cells, but the end result must have adjacent pairs that are R and B. But wait, no. Because each stamp application can be applied multiple times. For example, applying the stamp on cells 1-2 as RB (so R and B). Then apply the stamp on 1-2 again (as RB), which would toggle them to B and R. Then apply once more to get R and B. So the pair alternates each time. But if another stamp is applied to 2-3, that affects cell 2. So for example:\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial: W W W W\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W W\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B R W\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R R W\n\nNow, cells 1 and 2 are B and R, and 2 and 3 are R and W. Wait, no, applying BR to 1-2 would swap their colors. So after first two steps:\n\n1: R, 2: B \u2192 after applying BR to 1-2, 1 becomes B, 2 becomes R.\n\nThen apply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, and 3 becomes R. So now cells are B, B, R, W. So two adjacent B's. So that's possible.\n\nWait, but how? The final string here has \"BBR...\".\n\nSo the conclusion is that it's possible to have adjacent same colors in the final string. So the code's logic of checking that each segment (split by W's) has at least two different characters is not sufficient. Because in this example, the segment would be \"BBR\" (if the rest are W), which has both B and R, so the code would output \"YES\", but is it possible?\n\nWait, in the example above, the segment is \"BBR\". Let's see how that could happen. Let me re-trace:\n\n- Apply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B.\n\n- Apply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, 3 becomes B. Now cells 1 is R, 2 is R, 3 is B.\n\nWait, that's not right. Wait, when you apply the stamp to 2-3 as BR, that would set 2 to B and 3 to R. So after that step:\n\n1: R, 2: B (from first application), but then applying BR to 2-3 would set 2 to B (since BR is applied \u2192 2 becomes B and 3 becomes R. Wait, no. The stamp can be applied in either orientation. So when you apply BR to 2-3, you set 2 to B and 3 to R. But previous step had 2 as B. So after this, 2 becomes B (from BR stamp), but that's a change from B to B? No. Wait, the stamp application changes the two cells to B and R. So regardless of their previous color, applying the stamp sets them to B and R. So when you apply a stamp to a pair, you're not toggling but setting them to the new colors. Oh! Wait, I think I misunderstood the stamp's effect.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\" So each time you apply the stamp to a pair, you set their colors to either RB or BR. So it's not a toggle. Applying the stamp to a pair sets the pair to either RB or BR, regardless of their previous colors. So each application overwrites the colors of the two cells.\n\nOh! That's a crucial difference. So if you apply the stamp multiple times to the same pair, the last application determines their colors. So, for example:\n\nApply RB to pair 1-2 \u2192 R B.\n\nThen apply BR to same pair \u2192 B R.\n\nThen apply RB again \u2192 R B.\n\nSo each application overwrites the previous ones. So the final colors depend on the last application. So this is very different from the previous understanding.\n\nSo the key here is that each stamp application to a pair of cells sets their colors to either RB or BR. So the order of applications matters. So to reach a certain final configuration, you must have the right sequence of applications.\n\nSo this changes the approach. Let's think again.\n\nIn this model, each stamp application overwrites the two cells. So for example, if you apply a stamp to cells 2-3 as BR, then the cells 2 and 3 become B and R. Then, applying BR again would leave them as B and R. Applying RB would set them to R and B.\n\nSo the final state is determined by the sequence of stamp applications. The last application to any pair of cells determines their colors. So overlapping applications can change the colors of cells multiple times.\n\nSo the problem is to determine whether the final configuration can be achieved by some sequence of stamp applications.\n\nGiven that, what's the necessary and sufficient condition for the final string to be possible?\n\nLet's think:\n\nThe first observation is that any occurrence of W in the final string must not be part of any stamp application. Because every time a pair is stamped, the two cells are set to R and B. So if a cell is W in the final string, it must not have been part of any stamp application. Because if it was stamped even once, it would have been set to R or B. So the W's in the final string must be cells that were never stamped.\n\nSo the W's divide the string into segments. Each segment of non-W cells must be covered by stamps. Each such segment must be covered by stamps in such a way that the final colors are achievable.\n\nNow, each segment of non-W cells must be covered by stamps. But stamps can overlap. So how can we model the constraints?\n\nLet's consider a segment of non-W cells. Let's say it starts at position i and ends at position j. All cells in this segment must have been stamped at least once (since they are not W). Now, the stamps can be applied in any order. But each stamp application affects two adjacent cells.\n\nFor example, a segment of length 2: must have been stamped at least once, leading to either RB or BR.\n\nA segment of length 3: The stamps must have been applied in such a way that each cell is part of at least one stamp. For example, applying stamps on (1-2) and (2-3). The first stamp could be RB, the second BR. So the final colors would be R (from first stamp), then B (from first stamp) and R (from second), then B (from second stamp). So the final colors would be R, B, B. But that's not allowed. Wait, but the second stamp application would overwrite the second and third cells. Let's see:\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\nThen apply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 B (overwrites cell 2) and R (cell3). So the final colors would be R (cell1), B (cell2), R (cell3). So the segment is R B R. Which is allowed.\n\nBut in this case, the segment has alternating colors. Is that a general rule?\n\nAnother example: segment of length 3. Apply stamps to 1-2 as RB (R B W), then to 1-2 as BR (B R W), then to 2-3 as RB (R B \u2192 cell2 becomes R, cell3 becomes B). So the final colors are B (cell1), R (cell2), B (cell3). So the colors are B R B. Which is allowed.\n\nSo in this case, the colors alternate. But how?\n\nWait, the final configuration is B R B. The colors alternate between B and R. So for a segment of length 3, the first and third cells are the same. But is this possible? Yes, according to the example. So in that case, the code's initial approach of checking if all characters in the segment are the same is not sufficient. For example, the segment \"BRB\" is allowed, which has both B and R. So the code's current approach would split on W and check each segment for being all the same, but in this case, the code would not trigger a \"NO\".\n\nBut the code given in the initial sample code is:\n\nprint(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\")\n\nSo if any of the non-W segments have all characters the same (like \"RR\"), then output \"NO\". Otherwise, \"YES\".\n\nSo according to that code, a segment like \"RRB\" would be allowed (since len(set(x)) is 2), but \"RR\" is not allowed.\n\nBut according to our previous example, it's possible to have a segment like \"RR\" if you apply the stamp twice. For example, apply RB to the pair, then BR again. So the first application sets them to R B. Second application (BR) sets them to B R. Third application (RB) sets them to R B again. Wait, but each application overwrites the pair. So to have a pair of R R, how?\n\nWait, each application sets the pair to RB or BR. So it's impossible to have two R's in a pair. Because any stamp applied to them must set them to either RB or BR. So a segment of two R's is impossible. Because that would require that the last stamp applied to the pair was RR, which is not possible. So any segment of two same characters is invalid. Hence, the code's logic is correct.\n\nAh, this is the key insight! Because each pair of adjacent cells must have been stamped at least once (if they are in a non-W segment). So for any two adjacent cells in a non-W segment, their colors must be different. Because the last stamp applied to that pair must have set them to either RB or BR. So adjacent cells in a non-W segment must be different colors.\n\nWait, but what if two adjacent cells are part of a larger segment but the last stamp applied to their pair was in a way that they are different? For example, in a segment of three cells, the pair 1-2 and 2-3. Suppose we apply stamps to 1-2 as RB (R B ...), then to 2-3 as BR (B R ...). So cells 2 and 3 are B and R. Then, apply stamp to 1-2 as BR (B R ...), so cells 1 and 2 become B R. Then cells 1 and 2 are B R, which are different. Cells 2 and 3 are B R (from previous steps). So the segment is B R R. Wait, no. Let me re-trace:\n\nAfter initial steps:\n\n1-2: R B (from RB stamp).\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 cells 2 and 3 become B R. So the sequence is R B R.\n\nThen apply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 cells 1 and 2 become B R. So the sequence is B R R.\n\nBut then, in the final sequence, cells 2 and 3 are R R. But according to the stamping rules, the last stamp applied to 2-3 was BR, which sets them to B R. So how did we get R R?\n\nAh, I'm making a mistake here. When you apply the stamp to 2-3 as BR, cells 2 and 3 become B R. Then, when you apply the stamp to 1-2 as BR, that changes cells 1 and 2 to B R. So after that, the cells are B (1), R (2), R (3). But cell 3's value is R from the previous stamp. So between 2 and 3, their colors are R and R, which is impossible. Because the last stamp applied to 2-3 was BR, which sets them to B R. So how did cell 3 become R again?\n\nWait, no. When you apply the stamp to 1-2 as BR, that affects only cells 1 and 2. Cells 3 remains as R from the previous step. So after applying BR to 1-2, the cells are B R (cells 1 and 2) and R (cell 3). So the sequence is B R R. But cells 2 and 3 are R and R, which are adjacent and same. But according to the stamping rules, the last stamp applied to 2-3 was BR, which would have set them to B and R. But after that, other stamps can affect cell 2. For example, if another stamp is applied to 1-2, which changes cell 2's color. So cell 2 can be changed multiple times. So in this example, after the initial steps:\n\nAfter applying 2-3 as BR: cells 2 is B, 3 is R.\n\nThen applying 1-2 as BR: cells 1 becomes B, 2 becomes R. So the sequence is B R R. Now, cells 2 and 3 are R and R. But this is invalid according to the problem's constraints. So how is that possible?\n\nBut according to the problem statement's rules, each stamp application affects exactly two cells. The previous applications to other pairs can affect those cells. So in this example, cell 2 was first set to B (as part of 2-3 stamp), then set to R (as part of 1-2 stamp). So the final color of cell 2 is R. Cell 3 is R (from the previous 2-3 stamp). So cells 2 and 3 are R and R. But according to the problem's rules, this is not allowed. But according to the stamping rules, it's possible. So this implies that the code's initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, each stamp application must completely fit on the given cells. So, when you apply a stamp to 1-2, it's allowed. Then applying a stamp to 2-3 is allowed. Then applying a stamp to 1-2 again is allowed. So the final colors can be B R R, which has adjacent R's. But according to the problem's rules, this is possible. But according to the problem's statement, such a configuration should not be possible.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial code's logic. So this suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nSo the code's current approach checks if any non-W segment has all characters the same. But according to this example, it's possible to have a non-W segment where adjacent cells have the same color, but the code would not detect it. For example, the segment \"BRR\" would split into [\"BRR\"], and len(set(x)) is 2 (B and R). So the code would output \"YES\". But this configuration is invalid, because the last stamp applied to 2-3 must have been BR (setting them to B and R) or RB (R and B). But in this case, the final state has 2-3 as R and R. Which is impossible.\n\nWait, but how can the final state have R and R in 2-3? Because the last stamp applied to 2-3 was BR, which sets them to B and R. Then, if another stamp is applied to 1-2 (BR), it changes 2 to R. So 2 is R, and 3 is R from the previous stamp. So the pair 2-3 now has R and R. But according to the problem's rules, this is allowed because each stamp application only affects the two cells it's applied to. The problem statement allows overlapping stamps and any number of applications. So the final configuration is allowed. But this implies that adjacent cells in non-W segments can have the same color, which invalidates the initial code's approach.\n\nBut according to the problem's statement, is such a configuration possible?\n\nLet's think again. The problem allows stamping any pair of adjacent cells any number of times. Each application of the stamp sets the two cells to either RB or BR.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 cells 2 and 3 become B and R.\n\nThen, apply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 cells 1 and 2 become B and R.\n\nNow, cells 2 is R, cell 3 is R. So cells 2 and 3 are R and R. But how is that possible? Because the last stamp applied to 2-3 was BR, which sets them to B and R. Then, the stamp applied to 1-2 sets cell 2 to R, which overwrites the previous value. So cell 3 is still R from the first stamp.\n\nSo yes, this configuration is possible. But this means that adjacent cells in a non-W segment can have the same color. Which would make the code's initial approach incorrect.\n\nBut the code's initial approach would allow this case, as the non-W segment is \"BRR\", which has len(set(x))=2 (B and R). So the code would output \"YES\", but according to the problem's rules, this is possible. So the code's approach is correct in this case.\n\nWait, but in this example, the code's approach is correct. Because \"BRR\" is a valid configuration. But according to the problem's rules, it is allowed. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nBut according to the code's approach, it's not checking for adjacent characters. It's only checking that all characters in a non-W segment are not the same. So in the example where a segment has \"BRR\", the code outputs \"YES\" because there are both B and R in the segment. But the segment contains two adjacent R's. So why is this allowed?\n\nBecause according to the problem's rules, it is allowed. So the code's logic is correct, and the example is allowed.\n\nHmm. So the code's logic is that as long as in each non-W segment, there are at least two different characters, the answer is \"YES\". But how does that relate to the problem's constraints?\n\nBecause each stamp application can overwrite previous colors, it's possible to create segments where adjacent cells are the same. For example, the example above. So why is the code's approach correct?\n\nThe code's approach is to split the string into non-W segments and check that each segment contains at least two different characters. If any segment is composed of all R's or all B's, then it's impossible, else possible.\n\nBut why would that condition be correct?\n\nPerhaps the insight is that each non-W segment must have at least one R and one B. But this is not sufficient. For example, the segment \"RBR\" has R and B. But how is that possible?\n\nIn the fifth test case's example, the segment is \"BRB\". Which is allowed.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, that's allowed because the segment contains both B and R.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct. The key idea is that any non-W segment must have at least one R and one B, and this is sufficient.\n\nBut why is that sufficient?\n\nBecause given any non-W segment with at least one R and one B, we can find a way to apply stamps to achieve it.\n\nFor example, the segment \"BRB\". How can this be achieved?\n\nLet's think:\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B. So the segment becomes B R B.\n\nThus, the code's approach would output \"YES\", which is correct.\n\nAnother example: \"BRR\". How to achieve this?\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 cells 2 and 3 are B R.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 cells 1 and 2 are B R. So the segment is B R R. Which is allowed. But the code's approach would output \"YES\" because the segment contains B and R. So according to the problem's rules, this is allowed.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that the final picture can be made using the stamp operations. So in this case, it's allowed.\n\nBut how? Because each stamp application sets two adjacent cells to R and B. So the final configuration must have pairs that can be covered by stamps.\n\nBut in the case of \"BRR\", how can that be achieved? The last stamp applied to 2-3 must have been BR (B R). But after that, another stamp could be applied to 1-2, which changes cell 2 to R. But cell 3 remains R. So the pair 2-3 is R R, which was set by a previous stamp. But no, the last stamp applied to 2-3 was BR, setting them to B and R. So after that, no further stamps are applied to 2-3. So how can cell 3 be R?\n\nBecause in that case, the last stamp applied to 2-3 is BR, so cell 3 is R. And the last stamp applied to 1-2 is BR, setting cell 2 to R. So cell 2 and 3 are R and R. But according to the problem's rules, this is allowed. Because each stamp application only affects the pair it is applied to. So there's no requirement that adjacent cells in the final picture are different. The only requirement is that all non-W segments are covered by some stamps, and that their colors are achievable via a sequence of stamp applications.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct. The necessary and sufficient condition is:\n\n1. Each non-W segment must have at least two characters (so that they can be covered by at least one stamp).\n\nWait, no. Because the code does not check for the length of the segments. For example, if a segment is \"R\", the code's split would split it into a part of length 1, and len(set(x)) ==1, so the code outputs \"NO\". But if a segment is \"RB\", the code outputs \"YES\".\n\nBut why does the code not check the length of the segments? Because a segment of length 1 is impossible. For example, \"R\" cannot be formed, since any stamp must cover two cells. So, for a segment of length 1, it's impossible to form it. But in the code's approach, such a segment would have len(set(x)) ==1, thus output \"NO\".\n\nBut the code's current approach does not check the length of the segments. For example, a segment of length 2 with \"RR\" would output \"NO\", which is correct. But a segment of length 2 with \"RB\" would output \"YES\", which is correct.\n\nBut for a segment of length 1, like \"R\", the code outputs \"NO\". Which is correct.\n\nSo the code's approach implicitly checks for the length of the segments. Because for a segment of length 1, the split would have a part of length 1. Then, len(set(x)) would be 1, so the code outputs \"NO\". So the code's approach handles both cases where the segment has all same characters or is of length 1 (which is also impossible).\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Split the string into segments separated by W.\n\n- For each segment:\n\n   - Check if it's empty (possible if there are consecutive W's) \u2192 ignore.\n\n   - Check if all characters in the segment are the same. If any segment has all same characters (like \"RR\" or \"BBB\"), then output \"NO\".\n\n- If all segments are OK (each has at least two different characters), output \"YES\".\n\nSo the code provided in the initial sample is correct. The missing part is the loop over the test cases. Because the code provided is:\n\nfor # TODO: Your code here\n    l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\")\n\nSo the code needs to loop over t test cases. But the code starts with 'for' and then a missing part. So the missing code is the loop over the test cases. The correct code would read t, then loop t times.\n\nBut looking at the code skeleton provided:\n\nThe code after the missing lines reads l = int(input()), which is the n for the test case. Then reads the string s.\n\nBut the code in the original problem's input is: The first line contains t, then for each test case, the first line is n, the second line is s.\n\nSo the code should read t, then loop t times. For each iteration, read n (but not used), then read s, split into parts, check each part.\n\nBut the code provided in the code skeleton reads l = int(input()), which is n, but then ignores it. Then reads s as the next line.\n\nSo the correct code is:\n\nRead t, then loop t times.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\nBecause the first line of input is t. The code should read that t, then loop t times.\n\nSo the complete code is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    l = int(input())\n    print(\"NO\" if any(len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') if x) else \"YES\")\n\nWait, but the code as written in the initial code skeleton is:\n\nprint(\"NO\" if any (len(set(x)) == 1 for x in input().split('W') ) else \"YES\")\n\nBut this would split the string into parts, and for each part (even empty parts), check len(set(x)) == 1. For example, if the string is \"W\", then split('W') gives ['', '']. Each of these is considered. But len(set('')) is 0 (since empty string has no characters). So the condition len(set(x)) ==1 would be false. So empty parts are ignored.\n\nBut what if the string is \"WW\"? Then split('W') gives ['', '', ''], which are all empty. So the any(...) would evaluate to false, so print \"YES\". But according to the problem statement, a string of all W's is possible by not using any stamps. So it's allowed. So the code's approach outputs \"YES\" correctly.\n\nBut for a segment like \"RRWBB\", split into ['RR', 'BB']. For each part, check if all same characters. 'RR' is yes, 'BB' is yes. So the code outputs \"NO\".\n\nBut if the string is 'RRB', then split into ['RRB'], which has set size 2. So code outputs \"YES\".\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when splitting by 'W', empty strings can occur, like for leading or trailing W's. For example, \"WBR\" \u2192 split into ['', 'BR']. The empty string is checked, but len(set('')) is 0. So in the any condition, it's false. So the code correctly skips empty segments.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code to complete the program is the loop over the test cases, which is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n\nSo the answer is the line that starts the loop."
