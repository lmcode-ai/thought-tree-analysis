Similarly for node 3. Then when processing node 2 in q[1], the parents are 1. For u=1, child[u] is 2 (roads to 2 and 3). So res = 1 + (2-1) +1 = 3. But then child[u] is decremented to 1. Then processing node 3 in q[1], its parent is 1 again. Now child[u] is 1. So res =1 + (1-1)+1 =2. Then, since res=2 is <= m (which is 4), it's added to q[2].

But in the code's q array, which is of size m+1, adding to q[res] would cause an out-of-bound access if res is larger than m. But in the sample input 2, m is 4. So q has 5 elements (0 to 4). For res=3, which is within 0-4, it's okay. But when the code processes i=3, q[3] would have node 1 (from u=1 via node 2's parent). But in the code's processing, when i=2, the code processes q[2], which is where node 1 is added via the path through node 3. Then ans[1] is set to 2, and when processing q[3], since node 1 is already visited, it's skipped. So the code works correctly. But what if res is larger than m? For example, if a node u has many outgoing edges. Suppose u has 1e5 edges. Then, the res could be i + (1e5-1) +1 = i +1e5. But m could be 2e5. So if i is 1e5, res becomes 2e5 +1, which is larger than m+1.",

So each time we process a parent u for a child s, it's like we're considering one possible path (blocking all other edges except this one). So when processing the next time (from another child), the child[u] would have been decremented. But perhaps this is a way to track how many edges have been considered. So the code's approach is to model the best possible blocking strategy, where for each node u, the optimal path is to block all edges except the one leading to the child s that gives the minimal ans[s] + (remaining edges to block) +1. But I'm not entirely sure. However, the key point is that the code must check if the computed res is within the bounds of the q array. So the missing condition is res <= m.\n\nThus, the correct code to insert is:\n\nres < m+1 But in C++, m+1 is the size of the array, so indices 0 to m. So the correct condition is res <= m. So writing res < m+1 is equivalent. But in the code, the array is declared as q[m+1], so the valid indices are 0 to m. So if res is m+1, it's invalid. So the code must check that res <= m.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is res <= m. But the code uses a loop variable i that runs up to m. So for res to be beyond m would cause an out-of-bound access. So the condition is res <= m.\n\nSo, the correct answer is to check if res is less than or equal to m. Therefore, the code should have:\n\nif (res <= m)\n\nBut wait, the code's q is of size m+1, so indices 0 to m. So the correct condition is res <= m.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nres <= m\n\nThus, the if statement becomes:\n\nif (res <= m)",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to figure out the missing condition in the if statement here. Let's look at the code. The problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ can ensure Keshi reaches city n in at most d days. \n\nThe approach here seems to be using BFS in reverse, starting from city n and calculating the minimal days for each node. The code uses a dynamic programming approach where ans[s] stores the minimal days required to reach n from s. \n\nThe main loop iterates over possible days i, and for each node s in q[i], processes its parents. For each parent u of s, they calculate res as i + (child[u] - 1) + 1. Let me parse that. \n\nWait, child[u] is the number of outgoing edges from u. So when considering a parent u of s, blocking all other outgoing edges except the one leading to s. Because each day, AmShZ can block one road. So if u has child[u] outgoing edges, to force Keshi to take the edge to s, AmShZ needs to block all other edges. But since he can block one per day, he needs (child[u] - 1) days to block the other edges. Then, on the next day (hence +1), Keshi can move. So the total days added would be (child[u] - 1) + 1 days. \n\nSo for node u, the minimal days would be ans[s] (days needed for s) plus (child[u] -1) days of blocking plus 1 day for moving. So res is i (which is ans[s]) plus (child[u]-1) +1. \n\nBut then, when processing u, we need to check if the computed res is better than any previously found. The code is using a BFS-like approach where nodes are added to the queue for their respective res day. But how do we determine if we should add u to q[res]?\n\nThe line is: if(/* TODO: Your code here */) { q[res].push_back(u); }\n\nSo the condition here must be that the res computed is the minimal possible for u. But since we are processing days in order (from 0 up), once a node is added to the queue, any later paths would have higher days, so we can skip them. The 'vis' array marks whether a node has been processed already. But wait, the code checks if vis[u] is set before processing. So when u hasn't been visited, we compute res and check some condition.\n\nWait, looking at the code: for each u in par[s], if u is not visited, then compute res. Then check if some condition, and if so, add to q[res]. But after that, child[u] is decremented. \n\nHmm. So the idea here is that for each parent u of s, when considering the path from u to s, the minimal days would be res. But since u can have multiple children, each time we process a child (s), we can consider blocking the other children. However, the way child[u] is decremented suggests that each time we process a parent u from a child s, we account for one of the outgoing edges (the one leading to s). So the remaining child[u] would be the number of other edges that need to be blocked. \n\nSo for the first time we process u (from some s), child[u] is the original number of edges. Then we subtract one each time we process u from another s. So perhaps the res is calculated as ans[s] + (original child[u] - 1) +1, but since when processing other children, we have already accounted for some edges. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nLet's say u has two outgoing edges, to s1 and s2. When processing s1 first, child[u] is 2. So res would be ans[s1] + (2-1) +1 = ans[s1] + 2. Then we add u to q[res], and then child[u] becomes 1. Then when processing s2, child[u] is 1. So res is ans[s2] + (1-1)+1 = ans[s2] +1. If this res is lower than the previous res, then u would be added again. But since vis[u] is only set when it's processed from the queue, which happens when the minimal days are found. \n\nWait, the 'vis' array is marked as 1 when the node is processed (added to the queue and ans[s] is set). So when processing a parent u from s, if u is already visited, we skip. But when u is not visited, we compute res and check if adding it to q[res] is possible. \n\nBut how do we know that this res is the minimal possible for u? Because when we process nodes in order of increasing days, the first time a node is added to the queue is when the minimal days are found. So for u, the first time we compute res for u (from any of its children) would be the minimal possible. But how to ensure that?\n\nThe key is that the code uses a BFS-like approach, iterating from day 0 up. So for each day i, the code processes all nodes in q[i]. This way, once a node is added to q[i], any later processing would have a higher i, thus the first occurrence is the minimal. \n\nSo for the parent u, when considering the path via s, the res is computed. But since u could be processed via other children with a lower res, we need to check if the current res is the minimal possible. But how?\n\nWait, the code loops i from 0 to m, which is the maximum possible days (since each road can be blocked once). For each i, it processes the nodes in q[i]. So the first time u is added to any q[res], that res is the minimal possible. So during the processing of s (which is in q[i]), when we process u, compute res, and if u hasn't been added to the queue yet (vis[u] is false), then we can add u to q[res]. But since the loop processes days in order, the first occurrence of u in the queue is the minimal days.\n\nBut the code uses the line: if (/* condition */) { q[res].push_back(u); }\n\nWhat condition must be met here? Since we want to add u to q[res] only if this res is the minimal possible. However, since the code is processing days in order, and once a node is added to the queue, the first occurrence (smallest i) is the minimal. So perhaps the condition is that res is within the bounds of the array q (which has size m+1). But that's not the case here. Because the maximum possible days could be up to m+something, but maybe the code's q is of size m+1. Wait, q is declared as vector<ll> q[m+1]; but that's in C++. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, in the code, the line is vector<ll> q[m+1]; which creates an array of m+1 vectors. But m can be up to 2e5, so creating an array of 2e5+1 vectors would be a problem. Wait, but in the original code, m is read from input, so this line is invalid. Because in C++, you can't declare a variable-length array like that. So maybe the code has a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the code is supposed to use a vector of vectors, but maybe the original code uses some other approach. Hmm. But this might be a mistake in the code. Wait, the code has:\n\nvector<ll> q[m+1];\n\nBut m is a variable, not a compile-time constant. So this is not valid in standard C++. Maybe the code is using a compiler extension. But regardless, the code as written is part of the problem, and I need to focus on the missing condition.\n\nSo, the condition in the if statement must check whether the res is within the possible range of q's indices. Because q is of size m+1, and res could be up to i + (child[u]-1)+1. Since i starts at 0 and up to m, and (child[u]-1)+1 could be up to (original child[u] value). But given that m can be up to 2e5, but the maximum possible res would be when i is m, and child[u] is 2e5. Then res could be m + (2e5-1)+1 = m + 2e5, which would be way larger than m. But the q array is size m+1. So accessing q[res] would be out of bounds. So this suggests that the code is wrong here, but the user provided the code as such, and the missing part is the condition.\n\nWait, but maybe the code is supposed to use a dynamic structure, but in the code as written, the q is an array of m+1 vectors. So when res exceeds m, the code would crash. But given that the problem requires that the answer is possible, maybe the maximum possible res is m. Wait, but in the worst case, the answer could be larger than m. For example, if every day you have to block a road. So perhaps the code's approach is incorrect here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses a BFS approach where res is stored in q, and since each step can be added once, the res is handled correctly. But perhaps the maximum res is m, but in that case, the code's array is of size m+1, which is enough.\n\nBut perhaps the problem requires that the answer is up to m + something, but given the constraints of the code, maybe the missing condition checks whether res is less than or equal to m. But that's not necessarily true. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n2 1\n1 2\n\nSample Output 1:\n0\n\nBecause Keshi is already at city 1, and can move directly to city 2 in 0 days (since AmShZ tells him to move). So the code would set ans[1] =0, which is correct.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nSample Input 2:\n4 4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n3 4\n\nSample Output 2:\n2\n\nSo the code's approach would process node 4 (n=4) first. Then for its parents, which are 2 and 3. For each, res is 0 + (child[u]-1)+1. Let's say for node 2, child[u] is 1 (since it has a road to 4). So res is 0 + (1-1)+1 = 1. Then node 2 is added to q[1]. Similarly for node 3. Then when processing node 2 in q[1], the parents are 1. For u=1, child[u] is 2 (roads to 2 and 3). So res = 1 + (2-1) +1 = 3. But then child[u] is decremented to 1. Then processing node 3 in q[1], its parent is 1 again. Now child[u] is 1. So res =1 + (1-1)+1 =2. Then, since res=2 is <= m (which is 4), it's added to q[2]. Then when processing q[2], u=1's ans is 2, which is the answer. So the code's output is ans[1] =2.\n\nBut the code as written would compute res=3 and res=2. The problem is, how to handle the case where res can be larger than m. But in the code's q array, which is of size m+1, adding to q[res] would cause an out-of-bound access if res is larger than m.\n\nBut in the sample input 2, m is 4. So q has 5 elements (0 to 4). For res=3, which is within 0-4, it's okay. But when the code processes i=3, q[3] would have node 1 (from u=1 via node 2's parent). But in the code's processing, when i=2, the code processes q[2], which is where node 1 is added via the path through node 3. Then ans[1] is set to 2, and when processing q[3], since node 1 is already visited, it's skipped. So the code works correctly.\n\nBut what if res is larger than m? For example, if a node u has many outgoing edges. Suppose u has 1e5 edges. Then, the res could be i + (1e5-1) +1 = i +1e5. But m could be 2e5. So if i is 1e5, res becomes 2e5 +1, which is larger than m+1. Then, accessing q[res] would be out of bounds.\n\nBut the code has the array q[m+1], which has indexes from 0 to m. So if res is m+1, which is beyond the array's size, this would cause undefined behavior.\n\nBut this suggests that the code has a flaw. However, given that the problem states that there is at least one route from 1 to n, perhaps the minimal d is within some manageable range. But maybe the code is intended to have the condition that res is less than or equal to m. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, the code might have a mistake in the loop's upper limit, but since the problem requires us to fill in the missing code, perhaps the missing condition is to check whether res is less than (m+1), i.e., res < (m+1). Because the array q has size m+1, so indices from 0 to m. So if res is >=m+1, then the code would access q[res] which is out of bounds. So the missing condition should be res < m+1. But the code's loop runs up to i < m+1, which is i from 0 to m inclusive. So if res is m+1, then q[res] is out of bounds. Therefore, the code should check if res <= m.\n\nWait, the code declares q as vector<ll> q[m+1]; which is an array of m+1 vectors. So the indexes go from 0 to m. So if res is m, it's allowed. If res is m+1, then it's out of bounds. So the code must check that res <= m. Therefore, the missing condition is res <= m.\n\nBut in the code's for loop, i runs from 0 to m (inclusive?), since the loop is for(ll i=0; i<m+1; i++). Because m+1 is the upper limit. So i can go up to m. Then, res can be up to i + (child[u] -1) +1. If i is m, and child[u] is large, then res can be m + (child[u]-1) +1. Which could exceed m. So the code would crash. So to prevent this, the condition in the if statement should check that res is within the bounds of the q array. So the condition is res <= m.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is res < m+1 or res <= m.\n\nBut in C++, the array is 0-based with size m+1, so indexes are 0 to m. So res must be <= m.\n\nSo the missing condition is whether res <= m. So the code would be:\n\nif (res < m+1) { ... }\n\nBut since m+1 is the size of the array, checking res < (m+1) would ensure that. Alternatively, res <= m.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is res <= m.\n\nSo the line in the code should be:\n\nif (res < m+1)\n\nBut wait, the code uses a loop for i in 0 to m (inclusive), and the array q is of size m+1. So for res to be a valid index, res must be between 0 and m. So the condition is res <= m.\n\nThus, the missing code is (res < m+1) which is equivalent to res <= m.\n\nSo the condition inside the if statement should check whether res is within the allowed range.\n\nTherefore, the missing condition is res <= m.\n\nSo the code's if statement should be:\n\nif (res <= m)\n\nBut in the code, the loop runs for i in 0 to m (since i < m+1). So i can be up to m. But for res, when i is m, and child[u] is 0 (but that's impossible, since u has at least one child to s, which is part of par[s]). Wait, par[s] contains the parents of s, which are u's that have an edge to s. So for each u in par[s], child[u] is the number of edges leaving u. So when processing u, which is a parent of s, u has at least one outgoing edge (the one to s). So child[u] is at least 1. So when calculating res = i + (child[u]-1) +1 = i + child[u]. \n\nSo for u's child count, when we process it, child[u] is the original count minus the number of times we've processed u's parents. Wait, no. The code initially sets child[u] as the original count. Then, for each parent u of s, after computing res and adding to q, child[u] is decremented by 1. So each time we process a parent u for a child s, it's like we're considering one possible path (blocking all other edges except this one). So when processing the next time (from another child), the child[u] would have been decremented.\n\nBut perhaps this is a way to track how many edges have been considered. So the code's approach is to model the best possible blocking strategy, where for each node u, the optimal path is to block all edges except the one leading to the child s that gives the minimal ans[s] + (remaining edges to block) +1.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. However, the key point is that the code must check if the computed res is within the bounds of the q array. So the missing condition is res <= m.\n\nThus, the correct code to insert is:\n\nres < m+1\n\nBut in C++, m+1 is the size of the array, so indices 0 to m. So the correct condition is res <= m. So writing res < m+1 is equivalent.\n\nBut in the code, the array is declared as q[m+1], so the valid indices are 0 to m. So if res is m+1, it's invalid. So the code must check that res <= m.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is res <= m.\n\nBut the code uses a loop variable i that runs up to m. So for res to be beyond m would cause an out-of-bound access. So the condition is res <= m.\n\nSo, the correct answer is to check if res is less than or equal to m. Therefore, the code should have:\n\nif (res <= m)\n\nBut wait, the code's q is of size m+1, so indices 0 to m. So the correct condition is res <= m.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nres <= m\n\nThus, the if statement becomes:\n\nif (res <= m)"
