The loop processes each in order. Initial state: pre = 0, d=0, a=0. First iteration:\n\ni.first is x0. d += a * (x0 - pre) \u2192 a is 0, so d remains 0.\n\na += i.second \u2192 add[x0] is something. pre = x0. Then check condition.

But this is not correct. This is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider the sample input given in the problem statement.

But how does this ensure that a_j_new = a_j - contribution_i(j) < = m?\n\nWait, the code's logic is perhaps:\n\nAfter removing day i, the accumulated rainfall at any position j is a_j - contribution_i(j). We need a_j - contribution_i(j) < = m for all j.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as a_j - m <= contribution_i(j). But contribution_i(j) is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). So for all j, a_j - m <= max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). If this holds for all j, then the flood is avoided. But for j where a_j <= m, the left side is <=0, so the inequality holds. For j where a_j > m, the inequality becomes a_j - m <= p_i - |x_i - j| (since contribution_i(j) is positive), provided that |x_i -j| <= p_i (i.e., j is in [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i]). If j is not in that interval, then contribution_i(j) is zero, and the inequality becomes a_j -m <=0 \u2192 a_j <=m, which is not true (since we are considering j where a_j > m). So for j outside of the i-th day's coverage, the inequality fails.",

This requires checking (a_prev > 0) ? (d > m) : (d_prev > m). But in the code's loop structure, after processing the interval, d is the value at i.first, and a_prev is no longer available (since a has been updated). So to capture the maximum in the interval, the code would need to track both the previous d (d_prev) and the current d (d_prev + a_prev * interval). But the code's current loop structure only keeps track of d after processing each interval. So perhaps the code's condition is missing a way to track the maximum in the interval. But given that the code is written as is, and the variables available at the condition check are d (current value), a (current slope), and pre (current position), perhaps the correct condition is checking if the accumulated value (d) exceeds m.

But given that the code is written this way, perhaps the missing condition is (d > m), and the code's l and r are computed as the minimal and maximal positions j where a_j exceeds m, assuming that each such j contributes to a range of j - (d -m) to j + (d -m). But this would not correctly capture all positions where a_j exceeds m.\n\nHowever, given that the code's output is based on checking whether the i-th event's coverage includes l and r, perhaps the code's logic is that if removing the i-th event's coverage covers all positions where the original a_j exceeds m (modeled as the interval [l, r]), then the flood is avoided. So in the code's logic, l and r are the minimal and maximal positions where a_j exceeds m. Thus, for each i-th event, if the event's coverage includes [l, r], then removing it would eliminate the flood. But how is l and r computed. The code's current approach for l and r is to take i.first -d +m and i.first +d -m",

But how to compute the leftmost and rightmost positions where a_j exceeds m.\n\nThe correct approach would be to track all intervals where a_j > m and record the minimal and maximal positions. But with the code's current approach, perhaps the correct condition is to check whether the current accumulated rainfall (d) is greater than m. Then, for each such position i.first, compute the left and right positions where a_j exceeds m and update l and r accordingly. But this is only correct if the accumulated rainfall at i.first exceeds m and the code's model of the flood region as i.first \u00b1 (d -m) is accurate. But this is only accurate if the accumulated rainfall at i.first is a peak, and the a_j decreases by 1 per unit distance from i.first on both sides.",

But this would only capture the positions where the accumulated rainfall at i.first exceeds m, and model the flood region as extending (d -m) units to the left and right of i.first. This is incorrect in general, but perhaps the problem's test cases are designed in a way that this approach works. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the missing condition is 'd > m'. So, the missing code is 'd > m'.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what to put in that TODO part of the code. The problem is about determining for each day's rain whether erasing it would prevent a flood. The code uses some kind of line sweep or difference array approach to compute the accumulated rainfall and then checks conditions based on that.\n\nLooking at the code structure: They're using a map called 'add' to track changes in the rainfall's contribution. Then, they iterate through the map entries to calculate the maximum and minimum positions where the rainfall exceeds m. The variables l and r are being set based on some condition. \n\nThe key part here is the condition inside the loop over the map entries. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\", which suggests that this condition checks whether the current segment contributes to the flood. \n\nWait, the variables d and a are part of the line sweep. The 'd' represents the accumulated rainfall up to the current position, perhaps? Or maybe 'a' is the current slope of the line, and 'd' is the accumulated value. Let me think.\n\nIn the loop, for each interval (from pre to current i.first), the code adds to 'd' the product of 'a' (the current rate) and the length of the interval (i.first - pre). Then 'a' is updated by the value in the map (i.second), which is part of the difference array technique. So 'd' here is the accumulated rainfall at position i.first?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's consider how the line sweep works. The difference array approach here is used to model the piecewise linear function of the accumulated rainfall. The add map is built such that each key is a position where the slope of the rainfall changes. For each rain event centered at x_i with intensity p_i, the contribution is a triangle that starts at x_i - p_i, peaks at x_i, and ends at x_i + p_i. The slope increases by 1 from x_i - p_i to x_i, then decreases by 2 at x_i (so the slope becomes -1) from x_i to x_i + p_i, then increases by 1 again after x_i + p_i. So the add map is capturing these slope changes.\n\nWhen iterating through the add map, each entry represents a point where the slope of the accumulated rainfall changes. The 'a' variable here is the current slope, and 'd' represents the accumulated value at the previous position. Then, when moving from pre to i.first (the current position), the value of d increases by a multiplied by the distance (i.first - pre), which is the integral of the slope over that interval. So during each step, 'd' is the accumulated rainfall at the current position i.first.\n\nWait, but maybe 'd' is the current accumulated value. Let's see: initially, d starts at 0. For each interval (pre, current), the length is current - pre. The accumulated rainfall over that interval would be the previous slope multiplied by the length. So the code computes 'd += a * (i.first - pre)', which would be the area under the curve for that interval. Wait, but no. Because the accumulated rainfall is a function that's piecewise linear. The value at any position within the interval [pre, i.first) is determined by the slope 'a' during that interval. So the 'd' here is the accumulated value at position i.first. For example, during the first step, pre is the initial position (like the start of the first interval), and after processing each entry, d becomes the value at the current i.first.\n\nSo, during each iteration, we process the interval [pre, i.first), and 'd' is the accumulated value at position pre. Then, when we calculate d += a * (i.first - pre), that gives us the value at i.first. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think with an example. Suppose a is 1 (slope is 1). The interval is from pre=0 to i.first=5. Then, the accumulated value would start at d (let's say 0), then over 5 units, the value increases by 1*5, so d becomes 5. So after this step, the value at position 5 is 5. Then, 'a' is updated by i.second (which would be the next slope change). So 'd' is the value at i.first after each iteration.\n\nSo, during the loop, after processing each key in the add map, 'd' holds the accumulated value at position i.first. So during each iteration, the code processes the interval between the previous position (pre) and the current i.first. The 'd' after the update is the value at i.first.\n\nBut the code checks a condition. The variables l and r are being set based on whether the current segment contributes to a point where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. Wait, the problem states that a flood occurs if any position's accumulated rainfall exceeds m. So, during the line sweep, whenever the accumulated rainfall (d) exceeds m, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Because the code is trying to compute the minimal and maximal positions where the rain exceeds m. Or perhaps, the code is calculating the regions where the rain is above m, and then for each rain event, if removing it would exclude all those regions from being problematic.\n\nWait, the code after the loop is outputting for each i whether lefts[i] is greater than l or rights[i] is less than r. Wait, that part is a bit confusing. Let me look at the code again.\n\nAfter the loop, for each i, they check if (l < lefts[i] || r > rights[i]). If that's true, output '0', else '1'. So the idea is that lefts[i] and rights[i] define the range covered by the i-th rain event (x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i). The l and r variables represent the minimal and maximal positions where the flood would occur after removing this event. Wait, no. Wait, l and r are calculated in such a way that for the modified scenario (after removing the i-th event), the regions where the rainfall exceeds m must lie entirely within the i-th event's left and right. So if the original problem (without removing any event) causes a flood in regions that are not covered by the i-th event, then even after removing the i-th event, those regions would still be problematic. Hence, the code is checking if the entire problematic region (where rainfall exceeds m) is covered by the i-th event. If so, then removing that event would eliminate all those regions, hence the answer is 1.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The variables l and r are computed such that after considering all events except the i-th one, the maximum left and right positions where the rainfall exceeds m. Wait, perhaps not. The code as written is first building the add map with all events, then in the loop over the add entries, computes l and r. But how does this relate to the i-th event being removed? Hmm, perhaps the code is not directly considering each i-th event's removal but is instead precomputing some conditions that can be checked for each event.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to first compute the maximum and minimum positions where the original rainfall (without any removal) exceeds m. Then, for each event, removing it would subtract its contribution. The code is trying to model whether the event's coverage (lefts[i] to rights[i]) covers the entire problematic area. If after removing the event, all positions where rainfall exceeds m are within the event's coverage, then removing the event would eliminate those positions (since the event's contribution is subtracted, and those positions' rainfall would decrease by p_i - |x_i - j|. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is to compute the original maximum and minimum positions where the accumulated rainfall (without any removal) exceeds m. But when you remove an event, you need to check if the remaining rainfall in all positions is <= m. So for the i-th event's removal to be valid, the original accumulated rainfall minus the contribution from the i-th event must be <= m for all positions j. That is, for all j, (original a_j) - max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|) <= m. Which can be rewritten as original a_j <= m + max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). But this seems hard to compute.\n\nThe code's approach seems to be to precompute l and r, which are the minimal and maximal positions where the original a_j (without any removal) exceeds m. Then, when you remove the i-th event, the contribution of that event is subtracted. But how does that affect l and r? The code's current structure uses variables l and r, which are computed based on the original a_j (with all events), but perhaps that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The code is processing the add map, which is built with all the events. Then, in the loop, it's calculating 'd' as the accumulated rainfall at each position. Then, for each interval, the code checks a condition. If that condition is true, then it updates l and r.\n\nThe code's variables l and r are initialized to extremes. Then, during the loop, if a certain condition is met, l is set to the minimum of its current value and (i.first - d + m), and r is set to the maximum of (i.first + d - m). Wait, this part is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is calculating the regions where the accumulated rainfall is greater than m. For each interval, if the accumulated rainfall (d) is greater than m, then this interval contributes to the flood. But how to model the regions where a_j > m.\n\nBut the line sweep approach might not track each individual position. So perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost and rightmost positions where the a_j exceeds m. Then, for each event, if the event's coverage (lefts[i], rights[i]) includes all those positions, then removing the event would eliminate those positions (since their a_j would decrease by the event's contribution). So, for each i, if the event's left and right (x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i) covers the entire interval [l, r], then removing this event would make the a_j in [l, r] decrease, possibly bringing them below m.\n\nBut how are l and r computed? Let's re-examine the code's variables. The variables l and r are being set as:\n\nl = min(l, i.first - (d - m)) ?\n\nWait, let's see. The code line:\n\nl = min(l, i.first - d + m);\n\nWait, this can be rewritten as i.first - (d - m) = i.first - d + m. Hmm. Similarly, r is i.first + (d - m) ?\n\nWait, but d is the accumulated rainfall at i.first. So if d > m, then for the current position i.first, the rainfall is d. The code's condition is checking whether d > m, and then setting l and r based on that.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering that for each position where d > m, the interval around that position contributes to the flood. Then, the code calculates the leftmost and rightmost positions that are part of the flood regions. But this part is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the code may be trying to compute the minimal and maximal positions where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. But how?\n\nLet's think of the accumulated rainfall as a function a_j. We need to find all positions j where a_j > m. The code's approach is to sweep through all the points where the slope changes (the keys in the add map). For each such interval between pre and current i.first, the a_j function is a linear function. So within that interval, the a_j could cross the m threshold. The code's variables l and r are supposed to capture the leftmost and rightmost positions where a_j > m.\n\nSo for each interval [pre, i.first), which is part of the line sweep, the a_j in this interval is a linear function. The code needs to check if any part of this interval has a_j > m. If so, the code must find the minimal and maximal positions in that interval where a_j exceeds m and update l and r accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute that. Let's say during the interval [pre, current], the a_j starts at d_prev and increases (or decreases) with slope a. So the function is d_prev + a * (j - pre) for j in [pre, current).\n\nWe need to find the j in this interval where d_prev + a*(j - pre) > m.\n\nIf the entire interval is above m, then the entire interval contributes to l and r. Otherwise, perhaps only parts of it do.\n\nSo for each interval [pre, current), the code checks if there's any j where a_j exceeds m. If so, the code computes the minimal and maximal j in this interval where a_j exceeds m and updates l and r.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. However, since the code uses a line sweep approach, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the fact that the a_j function is piecewise linear. So for each interval between pre and current, the a_j is a linear function. The code can compute the maximum a_j in that interval and see if it exceeds m. If the maximum is <= m, then the entire interval is safe. Otherwise, the interval contributes to the flood regions.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum in the interval. Since the function is linear, the maximum is either at pre, current, or at a point where the slope changes direction (but in this case, the slope is fixed for the interval). Wait, for example, if the slope a is positive, then the maximum in the interval is at current. If a is negative, the maximum is at pre. If a is zero, the value is constant.\n\nSo for each interval [pre, current) with slope a:\n\nIf a > 0:\n\nthe a_j increases from d_prev (at pre) to d_prev + a*(current - pre) (at current).\n\nSo the maximum in the interval is at current.\n\nIf a < 0:\n\nthe maximum is at pre.\n\nIf a == 0:\n\nthe entire interval has the same value d_prev.\n\nSo, for each interval, the maximum a_j in that interval is max(d_prev, d_prev + a*(current - pre)).\n\nIf that maximum is > m, then there's a part of the interval where a_j > m. Then, we need to find the leftmost and rightmost positions in this interval where a_j > m.\n\nSo for the code's loop:\n\npre is the previous position, and the current position is i.first. The value of d_prev is the a_j at pre. Then, during the interval, a_j increases by a (the current slope) times (j - pre) for j in [pre, i.first).\n\nSo, the code has:\n\nd += a * (i.first - pre);  // so d is the value at i.first after this step.\n\nThen, a is updated with i.second (the change in slope).\n\nNow, for each interval [pre, i.first), the code must check if during that interval the a_j exceeds m.\n\nBut in the code's current setup, the condition is checking if (something) and then updates l and r. So the missing condition is whether the current interval has a_j exceeding m in any position.\n\nSo the code needs to check if the maximum a_j in the interval [pre, i.first) is greater than m. If yes, then compute the left and right positions in this interval where a_j exceeds m and update l and r accordingly.\n\nSo the condition is whether the maximum a_j in the interval exceeds m.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum. Let's see:\n\nIn the interval, the maximum is either at pre (d_prev) or at i.first (d_prev + a*(i.first - pre)), or somewhere in between if the function crosses m.\n\nWait, but the code's variables: before the line \"d += a * (i.first - pre)\", d is the value at pre. Then, after adding a*(i.first - pre), d becomes the value at i.first. So during the interval [pre, i.first), the value starts at d_prev and ends at d (after the addition). Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nIn the loop, pre is the previous position, and the code processes the current position i.first. So during the iteration, the code calculates the value at the current i.first as d = previous d (which was at pre) + a * (i.first - pre). Then, pre is updated to i.first, and a is updated with i.second.\n\nSo, the interval [pre (old value), i.first] is being considered, and during this interval, the value of a_j starts at d_prev (old d) and increases by a*(current - pre) to reach the new d (which is the value at i.first).\n\nBut the a in this interval is the previous a (before adding i.second). Because the code processes the add entries in order, and the a is updated after processing the interval.\n\nSo for the interval [pre, i.first), the slope is the current a (before the update). The code's variables during the interval processing are:\n\nd_prev = d (before adding a * (i.first - pre))\n\nd_new = d_prev + a * (i.first - pre) \u2192 which is the value at i.first.\n\nSo during the interval [pre, i.first), the a_j is a linear function starting at d_prev and ending at d_new, with slope a.\n\nThe code needs to check if any part of this interval has a_j > m.\n\nThe maximum in this interval is max(d_prev, d_new) if a is positive, or min(d_prev, d_new) if a is negative. Wait, no. If a is positive, then the function is increasing, so maximum is d_new. If a is negative, the function is decreasing, maximum is d_prev. If a is zero, the function is constant.\n\nSo for the interval [pre, i.first), the maximum a_j is:\n\nif a > 0: d_new\n\nif a < 0: d_prev\n\nif a == 0: d_prev (since the function is constant)\n\nSo, the condition for this interval contributing to flood regions is when this maximum exceeds m.\n\nSo the code's TODO condition is whether the maximum of d_prev and d_new (based on the slope a) is greater than m.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, during each iteration, the code is in the loop:\n\nd += a * (i.first - pre);\n\nSo before this line, d is the value at pre (d_prev). After the line, d becomes the value at i.first (d_new).\n\nThen, during the interval [pre, i.first), the function is linear from d_prev to d_new with slope a.\n\nSo the maximum in the interval is:\n\nif a > 0 \u2192 d_new\n\nif a < 0 \u2192 d_prev\n\nif a ==0 \u2192 d_prev (same as d_new)\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (a > 0 && d_new > m) || (a < 0 && d_prev > m) || (a ==0 && d_prev > m)\n\nBut wait, in the case where a is zero, d_prev is the value for the entire interval, so if that is > m, then the entire interval contributes.\n\nSo the condition for the interval contributing to the flood is:\n\nif the maximum value in the interval exceeds m.\n\nBut how to compute this in code.\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\npre is the previous position.\n\ncurrent is i.first.\n\nd_prev = previous d (before the line d += ...)\n\nd_new = d_prev + a * (current - pre) = after the line.\n\nSo during the interval [pre, current), the a_j is a linear function from d_prev to d_new with slope a.\n\nSo, the maximum is:\n\nif a > 0 \u2192 d_new\n\nelse if a < 0 \u2192 d_prev\n\nelse \u2192 d_prev (since a is 0, d_new == d_prev)\n\nSo the code needs to check if (a > 0 and d_new > m) OR (a <=0 and d_prev > m).\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nif (a > 0 ? (d_new > m) : (d_prev > m))\n\nBut in code, this would be:\n\nif ( (a > 0 && d + a*(i.first - pre) > m) || (a <=0 && d > m) )\n\nWait, but in the code's loop, the line \"d += a * (i.first - pre)\" is done before the condition check. Because in the code's current structure:\n\nthe code first calculates d += a * (i.first - pre), then a += i.second, then pre = i.first.\n\nWait, looking back at the code:\n\nfor (auto i : add) {\n\n    d += a * (i.first - pre);\n\n    a += i.second;\n\n    pre = i.first;\n\n    if (/* condition */) {\n\n        l = ... \n\n        r = ...\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, no, the code's loop is written as:\n\nInside the for loop:\n\nd += a * (i.first - pre);\n\na += i.second;\n\npre = i.first;\n\nif (condition) {\n\n   update l and r.\n\n}\n\nSo, during each iteration, the code is processing the interval from the previous pre to the current i.first. Then, after updating d, a, and pre, it checks the condition. But the code for the condition is checking after updating d and a. Wait, that's confusing because the interval [pre (old value), i.first] has already been processed.\n\nWait, this suggests that the code's loop is structured as:\n\nProcessing the interval [previous pre, current i.first].\n\nThen, after processing the interval, the code checks the current a and d. But that doesn't seem correct. Because the variables a and d are updated to the current state (after the interval).\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrectly structured. Because after the interval is processed (the d is updated to the value at i.first), the code then checks the condition. But the condition is supposed to check for the interval that was just processed, not the next one.\n\nHmm. So this might be a bug in the code. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's loop is designed to check each interval [pre, i.first] after processing that interval. Because after the code updates d, a, and pre, the next iteration will process the next interval. So the code's condition is supposed to check if the current interval (the one that was just processed) has any part where a_j exceeds m.\n\nSo during the iteration, the code processes the interval [pre (old), i.first], updates d to be the value at i.first, then a is updated with the new slope (i.second), and pre becomes i.first. Then, the code checks the condition. But that's after the interval has been processed. So the condition would be checking the new a and pre, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Because after processing the interval [pre_old, i.first], the code then checks if, in that interval, there was any part exceeding m. But the variables at this point (d, a, pre) are for the next interval.\n\nThis seems incorrect. Because the code's current structure is:\n\nAfter processing the interval, the variables are updated, and then the code checks a condition. But the interval that was just processed is now represented by the previous values of d and a.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is incorrect. For example, when the code is processing the first entry in the add map (say, position x1), the initial pre is some default value (maybe 0?), but then after processing, the code sets pre to x1. Then, the next entry is x2, and the code processes the interval [x1, x2], etc.\n\nBut how the variables are set. Let's think through an example.\n\nSuppose the add map has entries at positions x0, x1, x2. The loop processes each in order.\n\nInitial state: pre = 0, d=0, a=0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\ni.first is x0.\n\nd += a * (x0 - pre) \u2192 a is 0, so d remains 0.\n\na += i.second \u2192 add[x0] is something.\n\npre = x0.\n\nThen check condition.\n\nBut the interval processed was [0, x0], which was done with a=0. So in this interval, the a_j remains 0. Then, after processing, the code checks the condition. But in this case, the code is checking for the interval [x0, ...), which hasn't been processed yet.\n\nSo this seems to suggest that the code's loop is checking the condition after the interval has been processed, but the variables have been updated for the next interval. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the code's logic is flawed here. But given that the code is written this way, the correct approach must be to find the correct condition in the loop.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variables are correctly tracking the accumulated value. Let's try to re-express the loop.\n\nEach iteration of the loop is processing the current position i.first, and the interval between the previous pre and i.first. The code first updates d by adding a*(i.first - pre), which is the contribution of the previous slope over the interval. Then, a is updated with the new delta from the add map. pre is set to i.first. Then, the code checks if the current interval (the one that was just processed) has any part where a_j exceeds m. Wait, but after processing, the code now has the new slope (a) which is for the next interval. So how can we check the previous interval?\n\nThis suggests that the code's condition is placed incorrectly. The code should check the condition before updating a and pre. Because the interval being processed is between the previous pre and i.first. So the code should calculate the accumulated rainfall in the interval [pre, i.first) and then check if that interval contributes to the flood regions.\n\nSo the correct loop structure would be:\n\nfor each entry in add:\n\n   current_position = i.first\n\n   interval_length = current_position - pre\n\n   delta = a * interval_length\n\n   new_d = d + delta\n\n   // process the interval [pre, current_position) with slope a and values from d to new_d\n\n   check if this interval has any part where a_j > m\n\n   update l and r accordingly\n\n   d = new_d\n\n   a += i.second\n\n   pre = current_position\n\nSo the code's current loop structure is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nd += a * (i.first - pre);\n\na += i.second;\n\npre = i.first;\n\nThen check condition.\n\nBut this way, the code is processing the interval [pre, i.first], and after updating d, a, pre, checks the condition. Which is incorrect, as the a is already updated to the next interval's slope.\n\nTherefore, the correct code structure would process the interval [pre, i.first] with the current a (before updating it), and then update a and pre. Then, the code would check for the interval after updating d, which is the value at i.first, but the interval is the one that was just processed.\n\nWait, no. Because the code first processes the interval [pre, i.first] with the current a, updates d to the value at i.first, then updates a and pre. Then, the code checks the condition. But the interval that was processed is [pre_old, i.first], and the condition is supposed to check whether any part of that interval had a_j > m.\n\nBut the code's current code is checking the condition after processing the interval. So the variables a and pre have been updated for the next interval.\n\nBut the condition is supposed to check the interval that was just processed. So how to check that?\n\nIn the interval [pre_old, i.first], the a_j starts at d_prev and ends at d_prev + a_prev * (i.first - pre_old). So during the interval, the slope is a_prev (before updating a).\n\nSo the code should check for the interval [pre_old, i.first] with slope a_prev (before the update). But in the code's current structure, after processing the interval, a is now a_prev + i.second.\n\nSo the code's current condition is using the updated a, which is incorrect. Therefore, the code's loop is structured incorrectly. But given that the code is written as is, how can the missing condition be filled in?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the condition is checking if the current a_j (d) after processing the interval exceeds m. But that would only check the end of the interval, not the entire interval.\n\nWait, but the variables l and r are supposed to track the minimal and maximal positions where a_j > m. So if during any interval the a_j exceeds m, then we need to compute the leftmost and rightmost positions in that interval where this occurs and update l and r.\n\nSo in the code, after processing the interval [pre_old, i.first], the code has the value of a_j at i.first (d). But during the interval, the a_j could have been increasing or decreasing, so the maximum in the interval could be at the start (pre_old) or the end (i.first), depending on the slope (a_prev).\n\nSo the code needs to check if the maximum in the interval is greater than m. If so, then compute the positions where a_j exceeds m and update l and r.\n\nSo the code's condition should check if the maximum in the interval [pre_old, i.first] is greater than m.\n\nThe maximum is:\n\nif a_prev > 0 \u2192 d (the value at i.first)\n\nif a_prev < 0 \u2192 d_prev (the value at pre_old)\n\nif a_prev == 0 \u2192 d_prev (same as d)\n\nSo the condition is:\n\nmax_val = (a_prev > 0) ? d : d_prev;\n\nif (max_val > m) {\n\n   // compute the leftmost and rightmost positions in the interval where a_j > m\n\n}\n\nBut in the code's current structure, after the interval is processed, d is the value at i.first, a is updated to a_prev + i_second, and pre is updated to i.first.\n\nBut during the interval processing, the a_prev was the slope, which is the a before the code added i_second.\n\nSo the code's variables after the interval processing are:\n\nd = d_prev + a_prev * (i.first - pre_old)\n\na = a_prev + i_second\n\npre = i.first\n\nSo, during the condition check, the code has to use the a_prev (slope during the interval) to determine the maximum in the interval.\n\nBut how to get a_prev? Because a has already been updated.\n\nThis suggests that the code's structure is incorrect. The code should compute the maximum in the interval before updating a. But in the current code, the a is updated after processing the interval. So the code's logic is flawed here.\n\nBut given that the code is written as is, how can we correct the condition?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach. Let's think of it in terms of the current variables after processing the interval.\n\nThe code's d is the accumulated rainfall at i.first (current position). The a is the new slope for the next interval.\n\nBut the code's condition is checking whether the current d (at i.first) is greater than m. But this would only check the end of the previous interval.\n\nBut the code's variables l and r are being set as:\n\nl = min(l, i.first - d + m)\n\nr = max(r, i.first + d - m)\n\nWhich seems like it's trying to compute the left and right positions where the a_j exceeds m.\n\nWait, let's think of a_j > m.\n\nSo, for a position j, a_j = d_prev + a_prev * (j - pre_old)\n\nWe want to find j where this exceeds m.\n\nIf a_prev is positive:\n\nd_prev + a_prev * (j - pre_old) > m \u2192 j > (m - d_prev)/a_prev + pre_old.\n\nBut since a_prev is positive, this would be the left bound of the region where a_j exceeds m.\n\nAlternatively, solving for j:\n\nj > (m - d_prev)/a_prev + pre_old.\n\nBut since the interval is [pre_old, i.first], the minimal j where this is true is max(pre_old, (m -d_prev)/a_prev + pre_old + 1e-9).\n\nSimilarly, for a_prev negative:\n\nd_prev + a_prev * (j - pre_old) > m \u2192 j < (m - d_prev)/a_prev + pre_old.\n\nBut since a_prev is negative, dividing by a_prev reverses the inequality.\n\nThe maximal j where this is true is min(i.first, (m -d_prev)/a_prev + pre_old - 1e-9).\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the code's variables l and r are being calculated using:\n\nl = min(l, i.first - (d - m))\n\nr = max(r, i.first + (d - m))\n\nBut why?\n\nLet's think of the current position i.first, and d is the accumulated rainfall here. Suppose d > m. Then, the code is setting l and r based on i.first and d. But how does this relate to the positions where a_j exceeds m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is assuming that the maximum a_j in the previous interval is d (since a_prev was positive), and if that's greater than m, then the entire interval contributes to the flood. But this is not correct.\n\nThis is getting quite complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's consider the sample input given in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n3 5\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\n7 3\n\nSample Output: 001\n\nIn this case, the original accumulated rainfall exceeds m=5 at positions between 3 and 5, according to the note. After removing the third day's rain (which is centered at 7 with p=3), the accumulated rainfall is below m.\n\nThe code's approach should be to compute l and r such that after removing the i-th day's rain, if the original flood region [l, r] is contained within the i-th day's coverage (lefts[i], rights[i]), then removing it would eliminate the flood.\n\nSo the code's variables l and r are the original flood regions. For each day's rain, if the day's coverage [lefts[i], rights[i]] includes all of l and r, then removing it would reduce the accumulated rainfall in those regions by the contribution of that day's rain, which could bring it below m.\n\nBut this approach is only valid if the flood regions are entirely covered by the day's rain. So the code's current approach is to compute l and r as the original flood regions (without removing any day), then for each day, check if the day's coverage includes l and r. If so, then removing the day's rain would subtract its contribution from those regions, which could make their accumulated rainfall <=m.\n\nBut this approach is only correct if the accumulated rainfall in the original flood regions is exactly m plus the contribution of the i-th day. Because when you remove the i-th day's rain, the accumulated rainfall in those regions would be original a_j - max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|).\n\nSo for j in the original flood regions (a_j > m), after removing the i-th day's rain, a_j_new = a_j - contribution_i(j).\n\nWe need a_j_new <= m for all j. So for all j where a_j > m, contribution_i(j) must be >= a_j - m.\n\nBut contribution_i(j) = max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|).\n\nSo for j in the original flood regions:\n\nmax(0, p_i - |x_i - j|) >= a_j - m.\n\nBut a_j could vary for each j. This seems difficult to compute.\n\nThe code's approach seems to be to compute the minimal and maximal positions (l and r) where a_j > m in the original scenario. Then, for each day i, if the day's coverage [lefts[i], rights[i]] includes l and r, then for those positions j in l and r, the contribution of the day i's rain is at least p_i - |x_i - j|. But how does this ensure that a_j_new = a_j - contribution_i(j) <= m?\n\nWait, the code's logic is perhaps:\n\nAfter removing day i, the accumulated rainfall at any position j is a_j - contribution_i(j). We need a_j - contribution_i(j) <= m for all j.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as a_j - m <= contribution_i(j).\n\nBut contribution_i(j) is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|).\n\nSo for all j, a_j - m <= max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|).\n\nIf this holds for all j, then the flood is avoided.\n\nBut for j where a_j <= m, the left side is <=0, so the inequality holds.\n\nFor j where a_j > m, the inequality becomes a_j - m <= p_i - |x_i - j| (since contribution_i(j) is positive), provided that |x_i -j| <= p_i (i.e., j is in [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i]).\n\nIf j is not in that interval, then contribution_i(j) is zero, and the inequality becomes a_j -m <=0 \u2192 a_j <=m, which is not true (since we are considering j where a_j > m). So for j outside of the i-th day's coverage, the inequality fails. Hence, if any j in the original flood regions is outside of the i-th day's coverage, then removing day i does not change those j's accumulated rainfall, and they remain above m. Hence, the flood still occurs.\n\nThus, the only way removing day i can avoid the flood is if all j where a_j >m are within the i-th day's coverage [x_i -p_i, x_i + p_i], and for each such j, a_j -m <= p_i - |x_i -j|.\n\nBut this is difficult to check for all j. However, the code's approach is to assume that if all j where a_j > m are within the i-th day's coverage, and the maximum a_j -m for those j is <= p_i - |x_i -j|, then it's possible.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum.\n\nThe code's variables l and r are the minimal and maximal j where a_j > m in the original scenario. The code's current approach is to check whether l >= x_i -p_i and r <= x_i + p_i. If so, then all the original problematic j's are within the i-th day's coverage, and removing the day's contribution could potentially bring their a_j below m.\n\nBut even if l and r are within the day's coverage, it's possible that the a_j -m is larger than p_i - |x_i -j| for some j in [l, r]. For example, suppose a_j is much larger than m in some parts of the coverage area.\n\nSo the code's approach is incomplete. However, perhaps the code's solution is correct under certain conditions, or perhaps there's an error in the logic.\n\nBut given that the code is structured this way, the missing condition is probably checking whether the accumulated rainfall (d) in the current interval exceeds m. The variables l and r are being set to the minimal and maximal positions where the flood occurs.\n\nSo, the condition in the TODO is checking if d (the accumulated rainfall at i.first) exceeds m. But that's only the end of the interval. Alternatively, the code is checking if the current interval has any part where a_j exceeds m.\n\nBut given the code's structure, perhaps the correct condition is:\n\nif (d > m)\n\nBut why would the code check d > m here? Because d is the accumulated rainfall at i.first after processing the interval.\n\nBut wait, during the loop, d is the accumulated rainfall at i.first. So during the interval [pre_old, i.first], the a_j starts at d_prev and ends at d_prev + a_prev*(i.first - pre_old) = d. So if the maximum in the interval is d (if a_prev > 0), then checking if d > m would capture whether the interval contributes to the flood. If a_prev <0, then the maximum is d_prev, which is not captured by checking d.\n\nSo this suggests that the code's condition is incorrect. Hence, the code is probably incorrect as written.\n\nBut how to fix it given the current structure.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is to check if the maximum in the interval [pre_old, i.first] exceeds m. This requires checking (a_prev > 0) ? (d > m) : (d_prev > m).\n\nBut in the code's loop structure, after processing the interval, d is the value at i.first, and a_prev is no longer available (since a has been updated).\n\nSo to capture the maximum in the interval, the code would need to track both the previous d (d_prev) and the current d (d_prev + a_prev * interval).\n\nBut the code's current loop structure only keeps track of d after processing each interval. So perhaps the code's condition is missing a way to track the maximum in the interval.\n\nBut given that the code is written as is, and the variables available at the condition check are d (current value), a (current slope), and pre (current position), perhaps the correct condition is checking if the accumulated value (d) exceeds m. However, this would only check the end of the interval.\n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is that during the line sweep, whenever the accumulated rainfall exceeds m, the code updates l and r to the current position minus (d - m) and plus (d - m), respectively. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at the code's lines:\n\nl = min(l, i.first - d + m);\n\nr = max(r, i.first + d - m);\n\nIf d is the accumulated rainfall at i.first, then substituting:\n\nl = min(l, i.first - (d - m)) \u2192 which is i.first -d + m.\n\nr = max(r, i.first + (d - m)).\n\nBut what does this represent? Let's see:\n\nIf a_j at i.first is d, then for j = i.first - (d - m), the a_j would be m.\n\nWait, maybe this is trying to find the position where a_j = m, and the flood region is from i.first - (d - m) to i.first + (d - m).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, imagine that the accumulated rainfall at i.first is d. The code is assuming that the region where the flood occurs extends from i.first - (d - m) to i.first + (d - m). But this only makes sense if the accumulated rainfall forms a peak at i.first and decreases linearly with slope 1 on either side. But this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nThis approach seems incorrect. But given that the code is structured this way, perhaps the missing condition is (d > m).\n\nSo the code's condition would be if (d > m), then update l and r as such.\n\nBut in the first sample input, this might not capture all the regions where a_j exceeds m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition should check if the current interval has any part where a_j exceeds m. To do that, the code would need to check if the maximum of the previous d (d_prev) and current d (after processing the interval) is greater than m.\n\nBut the code's variables don't track d_prev. So this is impossible with the current structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach to compute l and r. For example, l is the minimal position j such that j = current_position - (a_j - m), and r is current_position + (a_j - m). So for each position where a_j exceeds m, the flood region extends from j - (a_j -m) to j + (a_j -m). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is modeling the accumulated rainfall as a function that forms a peak, and the flood regions are computed as the range around the peak where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. But this is not accurate in general.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for hints in the code's intended logic.\n\nThe variables l and r are initialized to very small and very large values, respectively. Then, during the loop, whenever the condition is met (the accumulated rainfall exceeds m), the code updates l to be the minimum between its current value and (i.first - (d - m)), and r to the maximum between its current value and (i.first + (d - m)).\n\nSo for example, if at position i.first, the accumulated rainfall is d = 6, m=5. Then d -m =1. So l is min(l, i.first -1), r is max(r, i.first +1). This would mark the flood region as extending from i.first-1 to i.first+1.\n\nBut this is only correct if the accumulated rainfall forms a triangular shape centered at i.first. For example, if the accumulated rainfall at i.first is 6, then the positions i.first-1 to i.first+1 would have a_j =6 - |j - i.first|, which would exceed m=5 at j=i.first and j=i.first \u00b11.\n\nBut this is not the case for general accumulated rainfall functions. The code's approach seems to assume that the accumulated rainfall forms a triangular shape, which is only true for a single rain event. But when multiple rain events are present, the accumulated rainfall can have a more complex shape.\n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect for multiple rain events, but perhaps the problem requires this assumption. However, given that the sample input has multiple events, this approach seems flawed.\n\nBut given that the code is written this way, perhaps the missing condition is (d > m), and the code's l and r are computed as the minimal and maximal positions j where a_j exceeds m, assuming that each such j contributes to a range of j - (d -m) to j + (d -m).\n\nBut this would not correctly capture all positions where a_j exceeds m.\n\nHowever, given that the code's output is based on checking whether the i-th event's coverage includes l and r, perhaps the code's logic is that if removing the i-th event's coverage covers all positions where the original a_j exceeds m (modeled as the interval [l, r]), then the flood is avoided.\n\nSo in the code's logic, l and r are the minimal and maximal positions where a_j exceeds m. Thus, for each i-th event, if the event's coverage includes [l, r], then removing it would eliminate the flood.\n\nBut how is l and r computed.\n\nThe code's current approach for l and r is to take i.first -d +m and i.first +d -m whenever the condition is met. So for each position i.first where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m, the code extends the flood region by i.first - (d - m) and i.first + (d - m). This seems to model the flood region as a single interval around i.first, which is not correct in general.\n\nBut perhaps the code's approach is to compute the minimal and maximal positions j where a_j exceeds m. Then, for each event i, if the event's coverage includes both l and r, then removing it would eliminate the flood.\n\nSo the code's l and r are the minimal and maximal positions j where a_j exceeds m. But how to compute those.\n\nIn the code's current approach, during the line sweep, whenever the accumulated rainfall exceeds m at position i.first, the code extends l to the left and r to the right. But this is incorrect if the accumulated rainfall is not a single peak.\n\nFor example, consider two separate regions where a_j exceeds m. The code would compute l as the leftmost of the two regions and r as the rightmost. But if the code's logic for l and r is to capture the entire range from the leftmost to the rightmost, then checking if the event's coverage includes both l and r would ensure that all flood regions are covered.\n\nBut how to compute the leftmost and rightmost positions where a_j exceeds m.\n\nThe correct approach would be to track all intervals where a_j > m and record the minimal and maximal positions.\n\nBut with the code's current approach, perhaps the correct condition is to check whether the current accumulated rainfall (d) is greater than m. Then, for each such position i.first, compute the left and right positions where a_j exceeds m and update l and r accordingly.\n\nBut this is only correct if the accumulated rainfall at i.first exceeds m and the code's model of the flood region as i.first \u00b1 (d -m) is accurate.\n\nBut this is only accurate if the accumulated rainfall at i.first is a peak, and the a_j decreases by 1 per unit distance from i.first on both sides. Which is only true if the accumulated rainfall at i.first is caused by a single rain event centered there.\n\nBut in general, this is not the case. Thus, the code's approach is incorrect. But given that the code is written this way, perhaps the intended condition is (d > m).\n\nSo the missing code is 'd > m'.\n\nThus, the code's condition is checking if the accumulated rainfall at i.first exceeds m, and if so, updates l and r based on i.first and d.\n\nBut this would only capture the positions where the accumulated rainfall at i.first exceeds m, and model the flood region as extending (d -m) units to the left and right of i.first. This is incorrect in general, but perhaps the problem's test cases are designed in a way that this approach works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the missing condition is 'd > m'.\n\nSo, the missing code is 'd > m'."
