So the required empty space between them is max(x,y). So when arranging all people in a circle, the sum of max(a[i], a[i+1]) for all consecutive pairs (including the last and first) plus the number of people must be <= m. But how to model this. For example, the optimal arrangement is to sort the a[i]s in non-decreasing order and arrange them in a circle. Then, the sum of max between consecutive elements would be the sum of the larger element in each adjacent pair. Since the array is sorted, each pair would have a[i] <= a[i+1], so max is a[i+1]. So the sum becomes sum(a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[n-1] + a[n] (since the last pair is a[n] and a[0], which would be a[0] < a[n], so max is a[n])). Wait, but that's not correct. Let's see. If the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, then a0 <= a1 <= ... <= an-1. Then, each pair (ai, ai+1) (for i from 0 to n-1, with ai+1 being a0 when i is n-1) would have max(ai, ai+1) = ai+1 except for the last pair (an-1, a0). The max of those two is an-1. So the sum would be a1 + a2 + ... + an-1 + an-1. Because for each adjacent pair in the sorted list (after a0, a1, ..., an-1 arranged in a circle), the max is a1 for (a0, a1), a2 for (a1, a2), ..., an-1 for (an-2, an-1), and an-1 for (an-1, a0). So the total sum is (a1 + a2 + ... + an-1) + an-1 = sum of a1 to an-1 plus an-1 = sum of a1 to an-1 + a_n-1 (since the list is sorted, the largest is a_n-1). So sum becomes (sum of all a except a0) + a_n-1. Then add the number of people (n), each taking a seat. So total required chairs is sum (max for each pair) + n = (sum(a) - a0) + a_n-1) + n.\n\nWait, sum of max for each pair is a1 (from a0 and a1) + a2 (from a1 and a2) + ... + a_{n-1} (from a_{n-2} and a_{n-1}) ) + a_{n-1} (from a_{n-1} and a0). So the sum is a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = sum(a[1..n-1]) + a_{n-1} = sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1} - a_{n-1} (Wait, no. Let me recalculate. The sum of a1 to a_{n-1} is (sum of all a) - a0. Then adding a_{n-1} (the last term from the pair between a_{n-1} and a0), which is a_{n-1} (since a0 <= a_{n-1}). So total sum is (sum a - a0) + a_{n-1}. So the total required chairs is (sum a - a0 + a_{n-1}) + n. Wait, but sum a - a0 is sum of a[1..n-1], plus a_{n-1} gives sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n]. But if a_{n-1} is the maximum, then sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} (assuming that the list is sorted in ascending order, then a_{n-1} is the maximum). Wait, no. If the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, then a0 <= a1 <= ... <= a_{n-1}. So a_{n-1} is the maximum. So sum a[1..n-1] is a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1} (since the list is 0-based). Then adding a_{n-1} gives sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = sum a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1} *2. So total sum is sum a[1..n-1} * 2 + a0? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the sum of max terms is sum(a) + a_{n-1} - a0. Because sum(a) - a0 is the sum from a1 to a_{n-1}, and adding a_{n-1} (the max of the last pair) gives sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1}. So the total required chairs is (sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1}) + n. Because each person takes 1 seat (n) and the sum of the max between each adjacent pair is (sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1}). Wait, in sample test case 2:\n\nn=2, m=4. a is [1,1]. After sorting, a0=1, a1=1. Then sum(a) is 2. sum(a) - a0 (1) is 1. Then add a_{n-1} (which is 1). So sum of max terms is 1 +1=2. Then adding n (2) gives 2 +2=4, which equals m=4. So condition is 4 <=4 \u2192 yes. Which matches the sample. Another sample: test case 4. According to the note, answer is yes. Let's see. Sample 4: n=3, m=8. a is [1,1,1]. After sorting, a0=1, a1=1, a2=1. sum(a) =3. sum(a) -a0=2. add a_{n-1}=1. sum of max terms is 2+1=3. plus n=3 \u2192 6. 6 <=8 \u2192 yes. So possible. Another test case: Test case 3. n=2, m=5. a=[1,2]. sum a=3. sum -a0=3-1=2. add a_{n-1}=2. sum of max terms is 2+2=4. plus n=2 \u21926. 6>5 \u2192 no. Which matches the sample. So this formula seems to work. So the total required chairs is (sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1}) +n <= m. Wait, but wait: sum of max terms is sum(a) -a0 +a_{n-1}? Let me check.",

So the code is missing checking two things: first, that n <=m, because if n>m, then it's impossible. Then, sum +n <=m. So the condition should be (n <=m) && (sum +n <=m).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining if n people can sit in m chairs arranged in a circle such that each person has at least a[i] empty chairs on both their left and right. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key is figuring out the minimal required chairs. Because each person i takes up a certain space. But since the chairs are arranged in a circle, the arrangement has to wrap around. So maybe the approach is to calculate the minimum total space required and check if it's <= m.\n\nBut how to compute that minimal space. Let's think. For each person, the space they need is 2*a[i] + 1 (since the person sits in one chair, and a[i] on each side). But wait, the problem says that when a person sits in chair j, the chairs from (j -a[i]) mod m to (j +a[i]) mod m are all occupied or blocked. So the total chairs blocked per person is (2*a[i] + 1). But since the chairs are arranged in a circle, overlapping might occur. So maybe the minimal required is the sum of all (2*a[i] + 1) minus overlaps, but that's hard to compute.\n\nAlternatively, since the chairs are in a circle, the minimal total required is the maximum of two conditions: the sum of each person's required space minus the overlaps, but also the maximum a[i] * 2 +1, because if one person's required space is larger than the sum of others, then that's the limiting factor.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal required chairs is the maximum between the sum of (a[i] + a[i] +1) for all but the largest a[i], plus the largest a[i] *2 +1. Or maybe another approach.\n\nWait, looking at the code provided, there's a line where they sort the array and then sum += dp[n-1], sum -= dp[0]. Then check if some condition. So maybe the code is using a formula. Let's see:\n\nIn the code, after sorting the array, sum is initially the sum of all a[i], then sum += dp[n-1], sum -= dp[0]. Wait, original sum is sum of a[i], then adding the last element (max) and subtracting the first (min). So sum becomes (sum of a[i]) + max_a - min_a. Then, multiplied by 2? Or not.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that (sum_of_a + max_a - min_a) +1 <= m. But I'm not sure. Let's think.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to compute the sum of all a[i] multiplied by 2, plus n (since each person takes 1 chair), but subtract the maximum a[i], because in a circle, the largest a[i] is considered. Wait, maybe the formula is: sum of (2*a[i]) + n <= m. But that can't be right, because when the chairs are in a circle, the sum of 2*a[i] for all i plus the number of people (each takes 1 seat) must be <= m. Because each person requires a[i] seats on each side, but when arranged in a circle, the largest a[i] might determine the minimal required. For example, if one person requires a lot of space, their requirement could dominate.\n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal required chairs as the maximum between:\n\n- The sum of all (a[i] * 2 + 1) minus the overlaps. But this is difficult.\n\nWait, let's think of arranging the people around the circle. Each person's required space is a[i] on both sides. But when placed in a circle, the sum of all a[i] plus the number of people must not exceed m. Wait, perhaps not. Let's look at the sample test case 2.\n\nSample Test case 2: n=2, m=4. a = [1,1]. The minimal required is sum of (1*2 +1) each: 3*2 =6? But m is 4. So that approach is wrong. But the actual answer is possible. So perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait in sample 2, each person takes up 1 chair (their own) and needs 1 on each side. But arranged correctly, they can be placed opposite each other. So each blocks 1+1+1=3 chairs, but since the chairs are arranged in a circle, their blocked chairs might overlap. So the total blocked chairs would be 4, which equals m. So perhaps the correct formula is sum of (a[i] + a[i] + 1) for all people minus the sum of the overlaps. But how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, after sorting the a array in non-decreasing order, the minimal required is (sum of a[i] + max(a)) + n. Because each person contributes a[i] to one side and the next person's a[i] to the other. But since it's a circle, the largest a[i] determines the necessary buffer between the first and last person.\n\nWait, here's an approach from some problem I recall. For a circle, the minimal required is sum of a[i] + max(a[i]) (since the maximum a[i] is needed between the first and last person in the sorted list). Then, adding the number of people (each takes one seat). So the condition is sum(a) + max(a) + n <= m. But sample test case 2: sum is 2, max is 1. 2 +1 +2 =5. Which is larger than m=4, but the answer is yes. So that's not right.\n\nWait sample 2: sum is 1+1=2. Max is 1. sum + max + n = 2+1 +2=5. m=4. So this formula would say no, but the answer is yes. So this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the correct formula is different. Let's think again.\n\nEach person i requires that their left and right have a[i] empty chairs. But when two people are seated next to each other, the required empty chairs between them is the maximum of their adjacent a[i]s.\n\nWait, suppose person A has a[i] = x, and person B has a[j] = y. If they are seated next to each other, the distance between them must be at least x (from A's right) and y (from B's left). So the required empty space between them is max(x,y). So when arranging all people in a circle, the sum of max(a[i], a[i+1]) for all consecutive pairs (including the last and first) plus the number of people must be <= m.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, the optimal arrangement is to sort the a[i]s in non-decreasing order and arrange them in a circle. Then, the sum of max between consecutive elements would be the sum of the larger element in each adjacent pair. Since the array is sorted, each pair would have a[i] <= a[i+1], so max is a[i+1]. So the sum becomes sum(a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[n-1] + a[n] (since the last pair is a[n] and a[0], which would be a[0] < a[n], so max is a[n])). Wait, but that's not correct. Let's see.\n\nIf the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, then a0 <= a1 <= ... <= an-1. Then, each pair (ai, ai+1) (for i from 0 to n-1, with ai+1 being a0 when i is n-1) would have max(ai, ai+1) = ai+1 except for the last pair (an-1, a0). The max of those two is an-1.\n\nSo the sum would be a1 + a2 + ... + an-1 + an-1. Because for each adjacent pair in the sorted list (after a0, a1, ..., an-1 arranged in a circle), the max is a1 for (a0, a1), a2 for (a1, a2), ..., an-1 for (an-2, an-1), and an-1 for (an-1, a0). So the total sum is (a1 + a2 + ... + an-1) + an-1 = sum of a1 to an-1 plus an-1 = sum of a1 to an-1 + a_n-1 (since the list is sorted, the largest is a_n-1). So sum becomes (sum of all a except a0) + a_n-1. Then add the number of people (n), each taking a seat. So total required chairs is sum (max for each pair) + n = (sum(a) - a0) + a_n-1) + n.\n\nWait, sum of max for each pair is a1 (from a0 and a1) + a2 (from a1 and a2) + ... + a_{n-1} (from a_{n-2} and a_{n-1}) ) + a_{n-1} (from a_{n-1} and a0). So the sum is a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = sum(a[1..n-1]) + a_{n-1} = sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1} - a_{n-1} (Wait, no. Let me recalculate. The sum of a1 to a_{n-1} is (sum of all a) - a0. Then adding a_{n-1} (the last term from the pair between a_{n-1} and a0), which is a_{n-1} (since a0 <= a_{n-1}). So total sum is (sum a - a0) + a_{n-1}.\n\nSo the total required chairs is (sum a - a0 + a_{n-1}) + n. Wait, but sum a - a0 is sum of a[1..n-1], plus a_{n-1} gives sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n]. But if a_{n-1} is the maximum, then sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} (assuming that the list is sorted in ascending order, then a_{n-1} is the maximum). Wait, no. If the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, then a0 <= a1 <= ... <= a_{n-1}. So a_{n-1} is the maximum. So sum a[1..n-1] is a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1} (since the list is 0-based). Then adding a_{n-1} gives sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a[1..n-1] + a_{n-1} = sum a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1} + a_{n-1} = sum a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1} *2. So total sum is sum a[1..n-1} * 2 + a0? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the sum of max terms is sum(a) + a_{n-1} - a0. Because sum(a) - a0 is the sum from a1 to a_{n-1}, and adding a_{n-1} (the max of the last pair) gives sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1}.\n\nSo the total required chairs is (sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1}) + n. Because each person takes 1 seat (n) and the sum of the max between each adjacent pair is (sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1}).\n\nWait, in sample test case 2:\n\nn=2, m=4. a is [1,1]. After sorting, a0=1, a1=1. Then sum(a) is 2. sum(a) - a0 (1) is 1. Then add a_{n-1} (which is 1). So sum of max terms is 1 +1=2. Then adding n (2) gives 2 +2=4, which equals m=4. So condition is 4 <=4 \u2192 yes. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: test case 4. According to the note, answer is yes. Let's see.\n\nSample 4: n=3, m=8. a is [1,1,1]. After sorting, a0=1, a1=1, a2=1. sum(a) =3. sum(a) -a0=2. add a_{n-1}=1. sum of max terms is 2+1=3. plus n=3 \u2192 6. 6 <=8 \u2192 yes. So possible.\n\nAnother test case: Test case 3. n=2, m=5. a=[1,2]. sum a=3. sum -a0=3-1=2. add a_{n-1}=2. sum of max terms is 2+2=4. plus n=2 \u21926. 6>5 \u2192 no. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nSo the total required chairs is (sum(a) - a0 + a_{n-1}) +n <= m. Wait, but wait: sum of max terms is sum(a) -a0 +a_{n-1}? Let me check.\n\nIn the sorted array, the sum of max terms for each adjacent pair (arranged in a circle) is:\n\nBetween a0 and a1: max is a1.\n\nBetween a1 and a2: max is a2.\n\n...\n\nBetween a_{n-2} and a_{n-1}: max is a_{n-1}.\n\nBetween a_{n-1} and a0: max is a_{n-1}.\n\nSo the sum is a1 +a2 + ... + a_{n-1} +a_{n-1}.\n\nBut a1 + a2 + ... +a_{n-1} = sum(a) - a0. So sum of max terms is (sum(a) -a0) +a_{n-1}.\n\nThen the total chairs needed is this sum plus n (each person takes 1 seat). So total required is sum(a) -a0 + a_{n-1} +n <= m.\n\nWait in the first test case:\n\nSample 1: n=3, m=3. So n>m, output no. Which is handled by the code because if n>m, output no. But in the code, the sum is sum of a[i] plus a_{n-1} minus a0.\n\nBut in the code, after summing the a[i], they do sum += dp[n-1]; sum -= dp[0]; so sum becomes sum_initial + dp[n-1] - dp[0}. Then check if sum <= m -n.\n\nWait wait, in the code, the sum is sum_initial (sum of a[i]) plus dp[n-1] (max) minus dp[0] (min), and then compares if sum <= m -n. Because in the code, the line is:\n\nsum += dp[n-1]; sum -= dp[0];\n\nThen if (sum + n <= m) then yes. Because sum (sum of a[i] + max - min) plus n (people) is compared to m.\n\nWait, in the code, after processing, sum is sum_initial (sum a[i]) + max - min. Then the code checks if sum <= m -n.\n\nWait, no. The code checks if (sum +n) <=m. Because sum is sum_initial + max_a - min_a. Then sum += ... etc. Then, the code does if (condition) then yes. So in the code's current state, the condition would be sum +n <=m.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nsum is initialized as sum of a[i].\n\nThen after sorting, sum += dp[n-1] (max) and sum -= dp[0] (min). So sum becomes sum_initial + max - min.\n\nSo sum_initial is sum a[i], so sum = sum a[i] + max_a - min_a.\n\nBut in our previous formula, the required chairs are (sum a[i] - a0 (min) + a_{n-1} (max)) +n. Which is sum_initial - a0 + a_{n-1} +n = (sum_initial + a_{n-1} - a0) ) +n. So sum in the code is sum_initial + a_{n-1} - a0. Then adding n gives the total required chairs. So the condition would be sum (code's sum) +n <=m. So code's check is if (sum +n) <=m then yes, else no.\n\nIn sample test case 2:\n\nsum_initial =1+1=2. After adding max (1) and subtracting min (1), sum becomes 2 +1-1=2. sum +n=2+2=4. m=4 \u2192 yes.\n\nIn test case 3:\n\nsum_initial=1+2=3. After adding max (2) and subtract min (1), sum is 3+2-1=4. sum +n=4+2=6. m=5 \u21926>5 \u2192no.\n\nYes, that works. So the condition in the code should be if (sum +n <=m) then yes.\n\nBut wait, the code's current line is:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */)cout<<\"YES\"<<\"\\n\";\n\nSo the missing code is the condition. Which should be sum +n <= m, and also n <=m. Because if n>m, then even if sum +n <=m, but since there are n people and m chairs, but n>m, it's impossible.\n\nWait, because each person needs at least 1 chair (since their own seat is taken). So if n>m, then even if all other conditions are satisfied, it's impossible. So the code must first check if n <=m, and then check the sum +n <=m.\n\nWait looking at the code:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nll n, m, sum=0; cin>>n>>m;\n\nvector<int> dp(n);\n\nfor ... sum += dp[i]\n\nthen sorted.\n\nsum += dp[n-1]; sum -= dp[0];\n\nif (condition) yes else no.\n\nSo the code is missing checking two things: first, that n <=m, because if n>m, then it's impossible. Then, sum +n <=m.\n\nSo the condition should be (n <=m) && (sum +n <=m).\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n(n <= m) && (sum + n <= m)\n\nLet me check sample test case 1: n=3, m=3. sum_initial = a's sum (unknown, but in test case 1, the actual a's are not given, but the code's first check is n>m. Oh, in test case 1, n=3 and m=3. So n is not less than m. So n <=m is 3<=3 \u2192 true. Then sum +n = sum_initial + max - min +n. But perhaps in test case 1, sum +n is 3 +3=6>3. But in the problem's note, test case 1: n>m is not possible. Wait, no. In test case 1, n=3 and m=3. So n is equal to m, but according to the note, n>m is the case. Wait, no. Test case 1's note says: n>m, so they cannot sit. So in test case 1, n is greater than m.\n\nWait, but the code's first check is n and m. So the code must check if n>m, output no. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo the code's condition must first check if n>m: in that case, output no. So in the code, the missing condition is (n <= m) and (sum +n <= m).\n\nBut in the code, the initial part is:\n\nthe code reads n and m. Then processes a[i]. Then sorts, computes sum += max and subtract min. So the code is missing checking if n>m. So in the current code, even if n>m, it proceeds to compute sum and check sum +n <=m. But sum could be 0, but n>m is the case, so the answer should be no.\n\nSo the code's condition must include checking n <=m, and sum +n <=m.\n\nSo the missing code in the if statement is:\n\n(n <= m) && (sum + n <= m)\n\nYes. Because:\n\n- If n>m \u2192 condition is false \u2192 output no.\n\n- Else, check sum +n <=m.\n\nSo the correct condition is that both n <=m and sum +n <=m.\n\nSo in the code, the missing part is:\n\nif( (n <= m) && (sum + n <= m) )\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code's missing condition is that."
