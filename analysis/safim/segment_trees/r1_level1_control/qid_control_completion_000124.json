Then, any subsequent R (in any row) will check the condition. Wait, no. Because after processing the first row, minx is set. Then, when processing the next row (second row from top), any R in that row will trigger the else clause. So the code is checking whether all R's in the grid are in columns >= the first R's column. Because the first R is the first encountered in the grid (top row, rightmost column). Then, any R that is in a column to the left of that (smaller b1) would cause check to be 0.

So the code's logic is that all robots in subsequent rows must be in columns >= the first robot's column. But that's not correct. The correct condition is that all robots must be in rows >= min_row and columns >= min_col. So the code's current logic is to find the first robot (the first R encountered in the entire grid, which is the topmost row's rightmost R). Then, all other R's must have columns >= this first R's column. But this is incorrect, because the first R may not be the leftmost in the top row. So, the code is wrong. But since the code is part of the problem, and we need to fix the missing condition, perhaps there's another approach. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to track the minimal required column for each row. Let's see:\n\nThe code processes rows from top to bottom. For each row, it processes columns from right to left. For the first row (top row), the first R encountered is the rightmost one.",

But according to the problem's correct approach, the leftmost R in the top row is column 1 (leftmost), but the code's logic is not finding that. So the code's approach is incorrect. But the code is written with the intention that it works. So perhaps the code's variable 'minx' is not the leftmost column but the minimal required column for the current row, and in the code's logic, for each row, the leftmost R (which is the first encountered in that row, since processing right to left) must be >= the minimal required column from the previous rows. Alternatively, maybe the code is checking that each R in a lower row must have a column >= the leftmost R in the top row. But this is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct but the 'minx' is actually tracking the leftmost column of the top row, and for any robot in a lower row, their column must be >= the top row's leftmost column. But the way the code processes the first robot is wrong.",

Wait, perhaps the code's logic is: For each row, track the leftmost R in that row. For all rows processed so far, track the maximum column index of those leftmost R's. Then, for each new row, the leftmost R's column must be >= the maximum of the previous rows' leftmost R columns. But that's not the case. Alternatively, the code is trying to track the minimal column in the top row. Once that's found, any R in a lower row must have a column >= that minimal column. But how to track that minimal column. Let me think of the code's processing for the top row. The code processes columns from right to left. The first R encountered is the rightmost in the row.

So for example, if the first R in the top row is column 3, and there's another R in column 2. The code will check if 2 <3, and if so, set check to 0. But according to our correct approach, the leftmost R in the top row is column 2, and all other R's must be in rows >=0 and columns >=2. But according to the code's logic, this would be rejected because the first R encountered is column 3, and the R at 2 is to the left, causing check to be 0. So the code's logic is incorrect. But the code is given, and we have to fill in the missing condition. Hmm. So what is the code's missing condition? The code is:\n\nif(c==82)if(minx==0){minx=b1;}\nelse     if(/* TODO: Your code here */){check=0;} So, in the else clause (when minx is not zero), the code checks if something is true. If so, sets check to 0. The code's variables are:\n\n- a: the current row being processed. It starts from n down to 1. So the first row processed is the top row (a =n), then the next is a-1, which is the next row down.\n\n- b1: the current column, processed from m down to 1. So for the first row, the first processed column is m (rightmost), then m-1, etc. So for the first row (top row), the first R encountered is at column m.",

So the code would output YES. Which is correct. Another sample: first test case in the problem:\n\nTest case 1: Input:\n\n3 3\n\nE E R\n\nR E E\n\nE E E\n\nThe code's processing:\n\nRows are processed top to bottom. First row (a=3), columns 3, 2, 1. In the first row, third column is R (b1=3). minx is 0, so set to 3. Then column 2 is E, column 1 is E. \n\nSecond row (a=2), columns 3, 2, 1. Column 3 is R. minx is 3. So check if 3 <3? No. So no problem. But according to the problem's note, the answer is YES. The code's check would be 1. So code outputs YES. But according to the correct approach, the candidate robot is in row 0, column 2 (0-based).",

The code reads n rows, but processes them in a loop where a starts at n and decrements. So for example, when the input has 3 rows, the code processes a=3 (first row), then a=2 (second row), then a=1 (third row). But the problem's grid is row 0 (top) to row n-1 (bottom). So the code's processing of rows may be reversed. For example, the first row in the input is row 0 (top), but the code's a=3 would process it as the first row. Wait, the code's a starts at n and decreases by 1 each time. So for a test case with n=3, the code processes a=3, then a=2, then a=1. So each a represents a row in the input. So the first row in the input is processed as a=3, which is the top row. But if the code processes rows in reverse order (the first input line is the bottom row of the grid), then the code's logic would be processing the grid rows in reverse. Ah! This is a crucial mistake. Let's re-express the code's processing of rows. The code reads n and m, then processes a from n down to 1. For each a, it reads a row. So, for example, if the input is:\n\n3 3\n\nRow1\n\nRow2\n\nRow3\n\nThen, a starts at 3 and processes Row1, then a=2 processes Row2, a=1 processes Row3. So the code's processing of the grid is in reverse order. The first input line is processed as the first row in the code's loop (a=3), which becomes the top row of the grid. No, that's not possible. Wait, no. The code's processing of rows is in the same order as the input. For example, if the input has n=3 rows, the code reads them in the order they are given. The first input row is processed when a=3, then the second when a=2, then the third when a=1. So the code's loop processes the rows in the same order as the input. But the grid's rows are typically numbered from top to bottom. So the first input row is the top row of the grid. So in the code's processing, the first row (a=3) is the top row. But when the code processes the first row (a=3), it is the top row of the grid. Then, the second input row (a=2) is the second row of the grid, and so on. But in terms of the code's variables, the first row processed (a=3) is the top row. This is correct. So in the first test case example, the code processes the first row (a=3) which is the top row (E E R), then the second row (R E E), then third row (E E E). Thus, the robots are at (0, 2) and (1, 0). When the code processes the first row's third column (b1=3?), which is E, then second column (b1=2) E, then first column (b1=1) R. So minx is set to 1. Then, in the second row (a=2), processing columns from right to left: column 3 is E, column 2 is E, column 1 is E, column 0 (if b1 starts from 3 down to 1, but m=3, then the columns are 3, 2, 1. So the code processes column 3 (E), 2 (E), 1 (E). But the R is in column 0, which is not processed. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the code's loop for columns is:\n\nfor(b1 = b; b1>0; --b1)\n\nBut 'b' is m (the number of columns). So the loop processes columns from m down to 1. But columns are 1-based. So for m=3 columns, the code processes columns 3, 2, 1. But the input's row is given as a string of m characters.",

Then, the code processes the next two characters (E and E), which are columns 2 and 1. Thus, the code's minx is 3. Then, processing the second row (a=2), the code processes columns 3, 2, 1.",

But this doesn't solve the problem. This suggests that there's a misunderstanding of the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct but the missing condition is something else. Let's think differently. The code's logic is:\n\n- For each row, process columns from right to left.\n\n- For each R, if it's the first R in the grid, set minx to its column. - For other R's, check if their column is >= minx. If not, check is 0. So the code's logic is that all R's must be in columns >= the first R's column. But this is only correct if the first R is the leftmost in the grid. But how? In the first test case's example, the first R is in column 3 (rightmost of top row). Other R's are in column 1 (second row's first column). So code's check condition is whether 1 >=3, which is false. So check is set to 0. Thus, output is NO. But the problem's note says the answer is YES.",

Then, in the first test case, the R in column 1 (second row) is 1 >3 is false, so check is 0. No. Alternatively, perhaps the code's missing condition is (b1 < minx), but the check is inverted. Wait, the code says:\n\nif(/* condition */) { check=0; } So if the condition is true, check is set to 0. So for the else clause, when the R is in a column less than minx, the code sets check to 0. But in the first test case's example, this would incorrectly set check to 0.",

But the code currently sets minx to the first R's column and doesn't update it. So to track the leftmost R in the top row, during the processing of the top row, whenever an R is found to the left of the current minx (i.e., in the same row), we need to update minx. But the code's current code doesn't do that. But the code's code has an if statement for minx ==0. So, perhaps the code's logic is:\n\n- minx is initialized to 0.\n\n- For the top row (a =n), during processing, when a robot is encountered and minx is 0, set minx to b1. But for other R's in the same row, if their column is smaller (left), set minx to b1. But the code's current code for the top row's first R is:\n\nif (minx ==0) { minx = b1; }\n\nFor other R's in the same row, minx is not zero, so the code enters the else clause. So, the code's current code doesn't update minx for other R's in the same row. Thus, to track the leftmost R in the top row, the code's logic is incorrect. But to fix this, perhaps the code's condition should be:\n\nif (minx ==0 || (a == n && b1 < minx)) But how to express this in the code. Alternatively, perhaps the code's logic is that for the first row (a ==n), when processing R's, minx is the minimal column. But the code's current code doesn't track that. So the code's logic is incorrect, but the missing condition is supposed to be (b1 < minx). But this would not work for the first test case. Alternatively, perhaps the code's logic is that for all R's, their column must be >= the leftmost R in the top row. But the code's logic is that the leftmost R in the top row is the first R encountered (rightmost), which is incorrect.",

But this is not correct. At this point, I'm stuck. Let me think of the code's intended approach. The code's check is initialized to 1. For each R:\n\n- If it's the first R (minx ==0), set minx to its column. - Else, check if some condition. If not, check becomes 0. The code's answer is \"YES\" if check is 1. So the code is trying to ensure that all R's (except the first) are in columns >= the first R's column. But this is only valid if the first R is the leftmost in the entire grid. But the code's processing of rows and columns means that the first R is the rightmost in the top row. Thus, the code's logic is to require that all R's are in columns >= the rightmost column of the top row. Which is almost never possible. But according to the sample test case 4, the code works. But in sample test case 4, the first R is in the upper left corner (column 1), so any other R's must be in columns >=1, which is true.",

Alternatively, perhaps the code's processing of columns is 0-based. For example, when m=3, the columns are 1,2,3 (1-based) or 0-based. But in the code's loop, for(b1 = b; b1>0; --b1), which for m=3 would process b1=3, 2, 1. But the actual columns are 0-based. So column 3 is out of bounds. This would be a problem. Ah! This is likely the mistake. The code processes columns from 1 to m, but the actual grid's columns are 0-based. Thus, for example, in a grid with m=3 columns, the code's loop for b1 from 3 down to 1. So the code is processing columns 3, 2, 1, which are out of bounds. This would be incorrect. Thus, the code's processing of the columns is wrong, leading to incorrect results. But how to explain this. For example, if m=3, the valid columns are 0,1,2 (0-based). The code's loop for b1 from 3 down to 1 processes columns 3, 2, 1, which are invalid. Thus, the code's logic is incorrect. But the code's code is part of the problem.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out what the missing code here is. The problem is about determining whether we can move robots such that at least one reaches the upper-left corner (0,0 if considering 0-based indices) without any robot exploding. \n\nLooking at the code provided, the main loop reads each test case. For each row, it processes the cells. The code checks for 'R' (robot) characters. The variables minx and check are involved in the logic. \n\nThe code sets minx to the current b1 (column index) when it first encounters a robot. For subsequent robots in the same row, there's a condition that if not met, sets check to 0, meaning the answer is NO. So the key is to find what that condition should be.\n\nWait, the rows are being read from top to bottom, but the code decrements 'a' each time. So the first row processed in the code is actually the top row of the grid. Because when a is the original number of rows (n), and we loop while a>0, decrementing a each time. So the first row processed corresponds to a= original n, which is the first input line. For example, if the input is 3 rows, then the code processes a=3 (the first row of input), then a=2 (second row), then a=1 (third row). But in terms of the actual grid, the first row in the input is the top row. So when the code processes the rows, the first row in the code's loop is the top row. \n\nEach row is processed by iterating over the columns (b1 from b down to 1, since m is the number of columns). So for each row, the columns are processed from right to left. For example, in a row with m=3 columns, the code processes the third column (b1=3?), then second, then first. Wait, the initial value of b1 is b, which is the number of columns. Then the loop is for b1 from b down to 1. So in a row with m columns, the code processes each cell in order from right to left. \n\nSo when a robot is found (c==82, which is 'R'), the code checks if minx is 0 (the initial value). If it's the first robot in that row, minx is set to b1. For subsequent robots in the same row, the code checks a condition. If that condition is not satisfied, check is set to 0.\n\nThe problem requires that all robots can be moved in such a way that one reaches (0,0) without any explosions. The key insight is that all robots in the same row must be to the right of the leftmost robot in that row, so that when we send left commands, the leftmost can reach the left edge. Otherwise, a robot further left would require moving more steps, possibly causing others to explode. \n\nWait, but how does this logic work? Let's think. The idea is that for each row, the robots must be arranged in such a way that their positions, when moving left (or up), allow the leftmost (or topmost) robot to reach (0,0) before others in the same row or column. \n\nWait, the upper left corner is (0,0). To reach there, a robot must be moved left and up as needed. For a robot in row i and column j, the number of left moves needed is j steps, and the number of up moves needed is i steps. But all robots must move the same steps. So the sequence of commands must first move up i times, then left j times, or any order that allows the robot to reach (0,0) without others going out of bounds.\n\nWait, but the order of commands matters. For example, if a robot is in (2,3), to reach (0,0), you might need to move up twice and left three times. But during those moves, other robots must not go out of bounds. \n\nBut the key observation is that for a robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must be in positions such that their required movement steps do not cause them to go out. So for any robot at (i,j), the number of up commands must be exactly i, and left commands exactly j. Otherwise, after moving up i times, if you move left more than j steps, that robot would go out of the grid. \n\nWait, no. Because each command moves all robots. Suppose a robot is at (x,y). Each up command decreases x by 1. Each left command decreases y by 1. So to get to (0,0), the robot needs exactly x up commands and y left commands, in any order. But during this process, other robots must not go out of the grid. \n\nBut other robots must have positions (a,b) such that when we apply all the up and left commands, a >= number of up commands, and b >= number of left commands. Otherwise, during the steps, they might go out. Wait, no. For example, if a robot is at (3,4), and the required steps are up 2 and left 3. Then during the up commands, the robot's x becomes 3-2=1. Then left 3 steps, y becomes 4-3=1. But for another robot at (1,2), after 2 up commands, it's at (1-2= -1), which is out of bounds. So that's a problem. So the steps must be such that for all robots, the required up steps is at least their current row (i), and the left steps is at least their current column (j). Wait, no. Because after moving up i times, any robot in row i' < i would have moved up i times, which would take them to row i' - i, which is negative if i' < i. \n\nSo this approach might not work. Therefore, the correct approach is to find a robot that is the leftmost in its row and topmost in its column. Because, for that robot, we can move up and left as needed, and all other robots must be to the right and below, so that when we move up and left enough times to reach (0,0), other robots are not forced to go out of bounds.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is that the minimal required steps for a robot (i,j) is i up and j left. But for all other robots (i', j'), their i' must be >= i (so that after moving i steps up, they don't go out), and their j' must be >= j (so after j steps left, they don't go out). Otherwise, those robots would have to move more steps than their positions allow. \n\nSo, the robot that is chosen to reach (0,0) must be such that all other robots are either in the same row and have a column >= that robot's column, or in the same column and have a row >= that robot's row. Or more accurately, all other robots must be in positions (i', j') where i' >= i and j' >= j. Because when we move i times up and j times left, any robot in i' >= i and j' >= j will have (i' -i) >=0 rows remaining (so not explode) and (j' -j) >=0 columns remaining, so they stay in the grid. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether there exists a robot at (i,j) such that for all other robots (i', j'), i' >= i and j' >= j. Because then, moving up i times and left j times will bring that robot to (0,0) and all others will not explode. \n\nSo the solution is to find the minimal i and j among all robots. Then check if all robots are in positions (i', j') where i' >= minimal i and j' >= minimal j. \n\nWait, because the minimal i and j would be the earliest possible robot. For example, if the minimal i is 0 (the top row), and minimal j is 0 (leftmost column), then that's the upper-left corner. But if there is a robot in (0,0), then the answer is immediately YES. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, in the fourth test case, there's already a robot in the upper left corner, so the answer is YES. \n\nSo the approach is: find the robot(s) with the smallest row and then, among those, the smallest column. That's the candidate. Then check if all other robots are in rows >= that row and columns >= that column. \n\nWait, but the minimal row and column must be considered. For example, if a robot is in row 1 and column 0, and another is in row 0 and column 1. Then the minimal row is 0, minimal column is 0 (assuming there's a robot at (0,0)). Otherwise, in this example, the minimal row is 0 (from the robot (0,1)), but the minimal column for that row is 1. So the candidate is (0,1). Then check all other robots have i' >= 0 and j' >=1. But if there's a robot in (1,0), then j' is 0 <1, so that's invalid. So in that case, it's impossible. \n\nSo the correct condition is to find the leftmost robot in the topmost row. \n\nWait, the topmost row is the minimal row index (since rows are numbered 0-based from top). The leftmost in that row is the minimal column. Then check that all other robots are in rows >= that row and columns >= that column. \n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n1. For each test case, find all robots' positions.\n\n2. Find the topmost row where there is at least one robot. Let that be min_row.\n\n3. Among the robots in min_row, find the leftmost column (min_col).\n\n4. Check that all other robots are in row >= min_row and column >= min_col.\n\nIf this is true, then answer is YES; else NO.\n\nSo, how does the code handle this?\n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nThe code processes each row in the order of input, which is top to bottom. But in the code's loop, 'a' starts at n and decreases. So the first row processed (when a is largest) is the first row of input, which is the top row of the grid. So the code is processing rows from top to bottom. \n\nThen, for each row (from top to bottom), and each column in the row, processed from right to left (since b1 starts at b and decreases to 1). So for a row of m columns, the code processes the rightmost column first, then next to the left, etc. \n\nFor each cell, if it's a robot (c == 82), then:\n\nIf minx is 0 (initial value), set minx to b1. But wait, in the code's processing of columns, for each row, the first encountered robot (since processing right to left) would be the rightmost in that row. Wait, no: because for a row with columns 1 to m (assuming the code uses 1-based?), the loop starts from b1 = b (m) down to 1. So the code processes the columns from right to left. So the first robot encountered in a row would be the rightmost in that row. Then, for subsequent robots in the same row (to the left of the first one), the code checks if (some condition). If that condition is not met, check is set to 0.\n\nWait, this code seems to track minx as the leftmost robot in the current row. Wait, no. Because when processing columns from right to left, the first robot in the row (the rightmost) would set minx to b1. Then, any robot to the left (lower b1) would be encountered later. So for example, in a row where the robots are in columns 3, 2, 1 (processing right to left), the first robot (column 3) sets minx to 3. Then the next robot (column 2) is processed, and since minx is 3, the code checks if something, and if not, sets check to 0. \n\nWait, but according to our approach, in each row, the leftmost robot (smallest column index) is the candidate. But the code is processing columns from right to left. So the first robot encountered in a row is the rightmost. Then, any robot further to the left (lower column index) would have a smaller b1. So, perhaps the code is trying to track the leftmost robot in each row. But the code sets minx to the first robot in the row (rightmost), then for other robots in the row, if their column is smaller (left), then perhaps the code should update minx. But in the code, minx is set once per row when the first robot is encountered. Then for other robots in the same row, the code checks if some condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to check for each row that all robots in that row are to the right of the leftmost robot in the topmost row. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nThe variables used in the code are:\n\n- check: initialized to 1. If any condition is violated, check is set to 0.\n\n- minx: initialized to 0. For each row, the first robot encountered (rightmost) in that row sets minx to b1. Then, for subsequent robots in the same row, the code checks if some condition. \n\nBut according to the problem, the candidate robot is the leftmost in the topmost row. So, perhaps the code is tracking the topmost row's leftmost robot, and ensuring that all other robots are in rows >= that row and columns >= that column.\n\nBut in the code, the processing of rows is from top to bottom. So the first row processed (top row) has a= n. For each row, when a robot is found, if minx is 0 (initial), then minx is set to b1. Then, for other rows (lower rows), when robots are found, perhaps there's a check.\n\nWait, no. The code's structure is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read n and m.\n\n   for a from n down to 1 (processing rows top to bottom):\n\n      for b1 from m down to 1 (processing columns right to left):\n\n          read character.\n\n          if it's R:\n\n              if minx is 0 (meaning this is the first robot in the top row?), then set minx to b1.\n\n              else, check if some condition.\n\nBut maybe the code is designed such that minx starts as 0, and for the first robot encountered (in the top row, since that's the first row processed), minx is set to its column. Then, for all subsequent robots (in lower rows or same row), the code checks if the robot's column is >= minx (assuming that the first robot is the leftmost in the top row). But wait, the first robot in the top row could be the rightmost in that row, because the code processes columns from right to left. So the first robot in the top row is the rightmost in the row, which would have a higher column number. Then, any other robot in the same row to the left (lower column number) would have a smaller b1. So, for example, in the top row, if the leftmost robot is column 1 (leftmost), but the code processes column 3 first (which is a robot), sets minx to 3. Then, when processing column 2 (another robot), the code would check if something. But since minx is 3, which is larger than 2, this would trigger a check failure.\n\nBut this can't be correct. Because in that case, the code would incorrectly reject a case where the leftmost robot is in the top row but the code first encounters a robot to the right. So the code's logic is flawed in that it's processing columns from right to left, and the first robot in the row (rightmost) sets minx, but that's not the leftmost. \n\nSo perhaps the code is incorrect. But the code was written by someone else, and we need to fix the missing condition. So perhaps the code is designed to track the leftmost robot in each row, but in a way that for the top row, the leftmost is tracked, and for other rows, their leftmost must be >= the top row's leftmost. \n\nWait, but the code's variable 'minx' is set once, for the first robot in the top row. Then, for other rows, the code checks whether any robot in that row is to the left of the top row's leftmost. If so, then it's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the leftmost robot in the entire grid. But the way it's written, the code processes rows from top to bottom. The first row (top row) is processed first. For that row, the code processes columns from right to left. So the first robot in that row (rightmost) sets minx to its column. Then, any other robot in the same row (to the left) will have a smaller column, which would cause the code to check if (some condition) and if not, set check to 0. \n\nSo the code's logic for a single row is that all robots in that row must be to the right of the first robot encountered in that row. But since the code processes columns from right to left, the first robot in the row is the rightmost. So the code's logic would require that all other robots in the same row are to the right of the rightmost robot. Which is impossible, unless there's only one robot in the row. That can't be correct. \n\nSo there must be a misunderstanding here. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nThe code:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   read n and m.\n\n   check = 1.\n\n   minx = 0.\n\n   for a in ... (processing rows):\n\n      for b1 in ... (processing columns):\n\n          read character.\n\n          if it's R:\n\n              if (minx == 0):\n\n                  minx = b1.\n\n              else:\n\n                  if (some condition) { check = 0; }\n\nSo, when minx is 0, which is the initial value, the first R encountered in the entire grid (since rows are processed top to bottom, columns right to left) will set minx to its column. Then, any subsequent R (in any row) will check the condition. \n\nWait, no. Because after processing the first row, minx is set. Then, when processing the next row (second row from top), any R in that row will trigger the else clause. \n\nSo the code is checking whether all R's in the grid are in columns >= the first R's column. Because the first R is the first encountered in the grid (top row, rightmost column). Then, any R that is in a column to the left of that (smaller b1) would cause check to be 0. \n\nBut that's not correct. For example, if the first R is at (0,3), and there's another R at (0,1), then the code will check (1 < 3) and set check to 0. But according to our correct approach, the leftmost robot in the top row is (0,1). So the code is not tracking that. \n\nThis suggests that the code is flawed in how it determines the leftmost robot. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is processing rows from top to bottom, and for each row, the leftmost robot must be to the right of the leftmost robot in the previous rows. But that's not the case. For example, if in the top row, there's a robot in column 3, and in the next row, a robot in column 2, then according to the code, the check would be triggered (since 2 <3?), but in reality, this is invalid because the leftmost robot in the second row is to the left of the leftmost in the top row. So the code's logic is that all robots in subsequent rows must be in columns >= the first robot's column. \n\nBut that's not correct. The correct condition is that all robots must be in rows >= min_row and columns >= min_col. So the code's current logic is to find the first robot (the first R encountered in the entire grid, which is the topmost row's rightmost R). Then, all other R's must have columns >= this first R's column. But this is incorrect, because the first R may not be the leftmost in the top row. \n\nSo, the code is wrong. But since the code is part of the problem, and we need to fix the missing condition, perhaps there's another approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the minimal required column for each row. Let's see:\n\nThe code processes rows from top to bottom. For each row, it processes columns from right to left. For the first row (top row), the first R encountered is the rightmost one. Then, for other rows, perhaps the code requires that all R's in that row are to the right of the minimal column from the top row. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to ensure that in each row, the leftmost R is not to the left of the leftmost R in any row above. But since the code processes rows top to bottom, and for each row, the first R encountered is the rightmost in that row, then any R to the left would trigger a check. \n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let's think of an example. \n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1\n\n3 3\n\nR E E\n\nE R E\n\nE E R\n\nThe code processes the first row (top row), columns 3, 2, 1. The first R is at column 1 (since it's the leftmost in the top row?), but wait no. The code processes columns from right to left. So for the top row, columns are 3, 2, 1. So in the first row's first column (3), if it's R, minx is set to 3. Then, in column 2, if it's E, nothing. Column 1, E. So the code's minx is 3. Then, in the second row (processing from right to left), column 3 is E, 2 is R. Then, since minx is 3, this R's column is 2 <3, so check is set to 0. So the code outputs NO. But according to the problem's correct approach, the leftmost R in the top row is column 1 (leftmost), but the code's logic is not finding that. \n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect. But the code is written with the intention that it works. So perhaps the code's variable 'minx' is not the leftmost column but the minimal required column for the current row, and in the code's logic, for each row, the leftmost R (which is the first encountered in that row, since processing right to left) must be >= the minimal required column from the previous rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is checking that each R in a lower row must have a column >= the leftmost R in the top row. \n\nBut this is unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct but the 'minx' is actually tracking the leftmost column of the top row, and for any robot in a lower row, their column must be >= the top row's leftmost column. But the way the code processes the first robot is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using 'minx' to track the leftmost column of the entire grid. But since the code processes rows from top to bottom, and columns right to left, the first R encountered would be the rightmost column of the top row. Then, when any R in a lower row is to the left of that, the code flags it. But this would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is broken, and the condition needs to be fixed. \n\nHmm. Let's think again about the correct approach. The correct approach is to find the minimal row and minimal column among all R's, and check that all R's are in rows >= min_row and columns >= min_col. \n\nTo compute this, we can iterate all R's and find the one with the smallest row (topmost) and among those, the smallest column (leftmost). Then, for all other R's, check that their row >= min_row and column >= min_col. \n\nBut how to track this in the code? \n\nThe code as written processes each row from top to bottom, and each row's columns from right to left. For each R encountered, the code is trying to track the minimal column in the top row. \n\nBut the code's initial code sets minx to the first R encountered in the top row (which is the rightmost R in that row). Then, any R in the same row to the left (smaller column) would have b1 < minx, which would trigger a check. \n\nWait, in the code's else clause, when minx is not zero (i.e., after the first R is processed), the code checks for some condition. If that condition is not met, check is set to 0. \n\nSo for the first row, any R encountered after the first (which are to the left of the first R in the same row) would have b1 < current minx (since columns are processed right to left). So in that case, the code would check the condition. If the condition is (b1 < minx), then it would set check to 0. \n\nBut in reality, if there's an R in the same row to the left of the first R, that R is the leftmost, which should be the candidate. But the code's logic is not updating minx to track the leftmost in the top row. \n\nSo perhaps the code is incorrect, and the missing condition is to check whether the current R's column is less than the current minx. \n\nBut if that's the case, then the code would set check to 0. But in reality, this R could be the leftmost in the top row. \n\nWait, let's see. For example:\n\nTest case where top row is R E R. So columns are 3, 2, 1 (processing right to left). The first R is in column 3. minx is set to 3. Then, in column 1 (leftmost), the code checks if 1 <3. If the missing condition is checking if (b1 < minx), then check is set to 0. But according to the problem's correct approach, the leftmost R in the top row is column 1. So the code would incorrectly set check to 0. \n\nThus, the code's logic is flawed. But the code is part of the problem, and we need to fill in the missing condition. \n\nSo what is the correct condition for the else clause? \n\nThe code's logic seems to be:\n\n- For the first R encountered in the grid (top row, rightmost column), set minx to its column.\n\n- For any other R in the same row, if their column is to the left (smaller than minx), then check becomes 0.\n\nBut this would require that all R's in the top row are to the right of the first R encountered (which is the rightmost). Which is impossible unless the top row has only one R. \n\nThis is incorrect. So perhaps the code's logic is wrong, but the missing condition is supposed to compare the current R's column in a row to the minx of the row. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using minx to track the minimal column for each row, and the condition is that in each row, the R's column must be >= minx. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps minx represents the minimal column that all R's in subsequent rows must have. For example, the first R in the top row (rightmost) sets minx. All R's in lower rows must have column >= minx. But that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is designed to track the leftmost R in each row and ensure that each subsequent row's leftmost R is to the right of or same as the previous row's leftmost. \n\nBut since the code processes rows from top to bottom and columns from right to left, the first R in a row is the rightmost. So the code's logic is that each row's rightmost R must be to the left of the previous rows' rightmost. \n\nThis doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute for each row the leftmost R. Since the code processes columns from right to left, the first R encountered in the row is the rightmost. But to track the leftmost, you have to find the smallest b1 in the row. \n\nBut the code is not doing that. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's 'minx' is actually the maximum column index of the leftmost R in all rows processed so far. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is:\n\nFor each row, track the leftmost R in that row. For all rows processed so far, track the maximum column index of those leftmost R's. \n\nThen, for each new row, the leftmost R's column must be >= the maximum of the previous rows' leftmost R columns. \n\nBut that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the minimal column in the top row. Once that's found, any R in a lower row must have a column >= that minimal column. \n\nBut how to track that minimal column. \n\nLet me think of the code's processing for the top row. The code processes columns from right to left. The first R encountered is the rightmost in the row. Then, any other R in the same row will be to the left. For each such R, the code checks if their column is less than the current minx (which is the first R's column). So for example, if the first R in the top row is column 3, and there's another R in column 2. The code will check if 2 <3, and if so, set check to 0. \n\nBut according to our correct approach, the leftmost R in the top row is column 2, and all other R's must be in rows >=0 and columns >=2. But according to the code's logic, this would be rejected because the first R encountered is column 3, and the R at 2 is to the left, causing check to be 0. \n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut the code is given, and we have to fill in the missing condition. \n\nHmm. So what is the code's missing condition?\n\nThe code is:\n\nif(c==82)if(minx==0){minx=b1;}\nelse     if(/* TODO: Your code here */){check=0;}\n\nSo, in the else clause (when minx is not zero), the code checks if something is true. If so, sets check to 0. \n\nThe code's variables are:\n\n- a: the current row being processed. It starts from n down to 1. So the first row processed is the top row (a =n), then the next is a-1, which is the next row down.\n\n- b1: the current column, processed from m down to 1. So for the first row, the first processed column is m (rightmost), then m-1, etc.\n\nSo for the first row (top row), the first R encountered is at column m. Then, any R in the same row to the left (smaller b1) would trigger the else clause, and the code checks if the current b1 is less than minx (which is m), which would set check to 0. \n\nBut according to the problem's correct approach, this R is the leftmost in the top row, which could be part of the solution. So the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut the code is written with this structure, so perhaps the code is not tracking the leftmost R in the top row. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is written in a way that after processing the entire grid, the 'minx' is the leftmost R in the top row. How? \n\nLet's see: in the top row, the code processes columns from right to left. So the first R encountered is the rightmost. But then, any R to the left (smaller b1) would have to set minx to the smaller b1. But the code doesn't do that. \n\nFor example, in the top row, with R's at columns 3, 2, 1. The code processes column 3 (b1=3), sets minx=3. Then processes column 2, which is R. Since minx is not zero, enters the else clause. If the missing condition is checking if (b1 < minx), then yes, 2<3, so check is set to 0. But according to the correct approach, this R is in the same row and to the left of the previous R, which makes it a better candidate. But the code's logic flags it as invalid. \n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect. Therefore, the code is not going to work. But since this is a programming problem, perhaps the code is written in a different way. \n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the code is trying to track the minimal possible required steps. For example, the leftmost R in the top row is the candidate. But in the code, 'minx' is set to the rightmost R of the top row. Then, any R to the left would trigger a check. So the code's logic is to find whether there exists a R in the top row such that all other R's are in columns >= to it. \n\nBut how? Because the code processes the top row's R's from right to left, and for each R, if there's any R to the left (smaller column) then it would trigger a check. \n\nBut the correct condition is that all R's must be to the right of the leftmost R in the top row. So the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps the code is correct because in the first row, the first R encountered is the leftmost possible. Wait, no. Because the code processes the top row's columns from right to left, the first R encountered is the rightmost. \n\nSo the code's logic is flawed. \n\nBut perhaps the code is correct and the missing condition is whether the current R's column is less than the current minx. Because, in the code's logic, the first R in the top row is the rightmost. Any R to the left in the same row would have a smaller b1, and if that is allowed, then the code would set check to 0. \n\nBut according to the problem's correct approach, such R's are valid as long as all other R's are to the right of them. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect, but the intended solution is to check whether all R's are to the right of the first R encountered in the top row. Which is not correct. \n\nBut perhaps the code's logic is to find the leftmost R in the top row, and ensure that all other R's are to the right of it and in lower rows. \n\nBut how to track the leftmost R in the top row. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's variable 'minx' is not the column of the first R, but the minimal column in the top row. \n\nBut the code sets minx to b1 for the first R in the top row (rightmost), but then does not update it for other R's in the same row. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut given that the code is written this way, perhaps the missing condition is (b1 < minx). \n\nIn this case, any R in the same row to the left of the first R (which is the rightmost) would trigger check to 0. \n\nBut according to the correct approach, such R's are valid candidates and should be allowed. \n\nSo this suggests that the code is incorrect, and the missing condition is something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct in a different way. For example, if the first R in the top row is the leftmost, and all other R's are to the right of it. But how does the code find that? \n\nWait, perhaps the code processes the top row's columns from right to left, and the first R encountered is the rightmost. Then, any R to the left of it in the same row is a candidate, but the code's logic is to ensure that all R's are to the right of the rightmost R in the top row. \n\nWhich is incorrect. \n\nThis is getting quite confusing. \n\nAnother approach: let's look at the sample inputs and see what the code would do.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\nThe fourth test case has a robot already in the upper left corner. The code should output YES. \n\nIn this case, the top row's first column (rightmost) would have R's. Let's say the input is 1x1 matrix with R. Then, the code's processing:\n\nFor a=1 (row 1), processing columns from 1 to 1. The first R is encountered, minx is set to 1. Then, no other R's. So check remains 1. Output YES. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, the minx is 1 (the rightmost column, which is 1). So when processing other rows (none), it's okay. So the code would output YES. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother sample: first test case in the problem:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\nE E R\n\nR E E\n\nE E E\n\nThe code's processing:\n\nRows are processed top to bottom. \n\nFirst row (a=3), columns 3, 2, 1. \n\nIn the first row, third column is R (b1=3). minx is 0, so set to 3. Then column 2 is E, column 1 is E. \n\nSecond row (a=2), columns 3, 2, 1. Column 3 is R. minx is 3. So check if 3 <3? No. So no problem. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the answer is YES. The code's check would be 1. So code outputs YES. \n\nBut according to the correct approach, the candidate robot is in row 0, column 2 (0-based). The other robot is in row 1, column 0. So when moving left once, the first robot moves to column 1, but the other robot moves to column -1, which is out of bounds. So the code's logic would output YES, but according to the problem's note, it is possible. Wait, but the problem's first test case says that it's possible by moving left. Let's see:\n\nIn test case 1:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nRow 0 (top row): cells 0, 1, 2 are E, E, R.\n\nRow 1: R, E, E.\n\nRow 2: E, E, E.\n\nWhen you send a left command, all robots move left. The robot in row 0, column 2 moves to column 1. The robot in row 1, column 0 (original column 0) moves to column -1, which is out of bounds. So this would explode. But according to the problem's note, the first test case's answer is YES. But this seems contradictory. \n\nWait, but the sample input may have been misdescribed. Wait, in the note for the first test case: it says \"send a command to move left\". Let me check the original problem's note again. \n\nProblem note says:\n\n\"In the first test case, it is enough to send a command to move left.\"\n\nWait, but how? The robot in row 0, column 2 moves left to column 1. But there's another robot in row 1, column 0. When moving left, that robot would go to column -1 and explode. So why is the answer YES?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake in the test case's input. Let me recheck the first test case's description. \n\nProblem note's first test case example: perhaps the input is:\n\nThe first test case's input is:\n\n3 3\n\nE E R\n\nR E E\n\nE E E\n\nBut according to the note, moving left once. The R in row 0, column 3 (assuming 1-based) would move left to column 2. But how does any robot reach the upper left corner (0,0)? \n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The upper left corner is cell (0,0) in 0-based indices. So the initial robot positions are:\n\nIn the first test case: the robot is in row 0, column 2 (0-based). So moving left once would take it to column 1. Not enough. Oh wait, perhaps the input is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the first test case's input is:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, m=3\n\nRow 1: E E R \u2192 cells (0,0): E, (0,1): E, (0,2): R\n\nRow 2: R E E \u2192 (1,0): R, (1,1): E, (1,2): E\n\nRow 3: E E E \u2192 all E.\n\nSo when we send a left command, the robot at (0,2) moves to (0,1). The robot at (1,0) moves to (1,-1), which is out of bounds. So this would explode. But according to the note, the first test case's answer is YES. This suggests that I have a misunderstanding of the problem. \n\nAh, no. The problem says that when you send a command, all robots move. But you can send multiple commands. The goal is to have at least one robot reach (0,0) without any robot exploding during any of the steps. \n\nSo perhaps the first test case's solution is to send a left command. \n\nLet me re-express the first test case:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n1\n\n3 3\n\nE E R\n\nR E E\n\nE E E\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: E E R \u2192 columns 0, 1, 2.\n\nRow 1: R E E.\n\nRow 2: E E E.\n\nSo the robots are at (0, 2) and (1,0).\n\nWhen you send a left command:\n\nRobot at (0,2) moves left to (0,1). Robot at (1,0) moves left to (1,-1) \u2192 explodes. So this is invalid. \n\nBut the problem's note says that the answer is YES. So there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says that when you send a command, all robots move. If any robot tries to move outside, it explodes and the answer is NO. So for the first test case, according to the note, sending a left command is sufficient. But according to the example, after sending left, the robot in row 0, column 2 moves to 0,1. The other robot in row 1, column 0 moves to column -1, which explodes. So the answer should be NO. But according to the note, the answer is YES. \n\nThis suggests that my understanding of the problem is incorrect. \n\nAh, perhaps the problem's rows are input in the order from bottom to top. For example, in the first test case, the first row of the input is the bottom row of the grid, and the last row is the top row. \n\nWait, but the problem statement says: the first line after n and m is the grid's rows. The code processes the rows in the order given, but the code's loop for a is from n down to 1, which may be the problem. \n\nThe code reads n rows, but processes them in a loop where a starts at n and decrements. So for example, when the input has 3 rows, the code processes a=3 (first row), then a=2 (second row), then a=1 (third row). \n\nBut the problem's grid is row 0 (top) to row n-1 (bottom). So the code's processing of rows may be reversed. For example, the first row in the input is row 0 (top), but the code's a=3 would process it as the first row. \n\nWait, the code's a starts at n and decreases by 1 each time. So for a test case with n=3, the code processes a=3, then a=2, then a=1. So each a represents a row in the input. So the first row in the input is processed as a=3, which is the top row. \n\nBut if the code processes rows in reverse order (the first input line is the bottom row of the grid), then the code's logic would be processing the grid rows in reverse. \n\nAh! This is a crucial mistake. Let's re-express the code's processing of rows. \n\nThe code reads n and m, then processes a from n down to 1. For each a, it reads a row. So, for example, if the input is:\n\n3 3\n\nRow1\n\nRow2\n\nRow3\n\nThen, a starts at 3 and processes Row1, then a=2 processes Row2, a=1 processes Row3. \n\nSo the code's processing of the grid is in reverse order. The first input line is processed as the first row in the code's loop (a=3), which becomes the top row of the grid. No, that's not possible. \n\nWait, no. The code's processing of rows is in the same order as the input. For example, if the input has n=3 rows, the code reads them in the order they are given. The first input row is processed when a=3, then the second when a=2, then the third when a=1. So the code's loop processes the rows in the same order as the input. \n\nBut the grid's rows are typically numbered from top to bottom. So the first input row is the top row of the grid. So in the code's processing, the first row (a=3) is the top row. \n\nBut when the code processes the first row (a=3), it is the top row of the grid. Then, the second input row (a=2) is the second row of the grid, and so on. \n\nBut in terms of the code's variables, the first row processed (a=3) is the top row. \n\nThis is correct. \n\nSo in the first test case example, the code processes the first row (a=3) which is the top row (E E R), then the second row (R E E), then third row (E E E). \n\nThus, the robots are at (0, 2) and (1, 0). \n\nWhen the code processes the first row's third column (b1=3?), which is E, then second column (b1=2) E, then first column (b1=1) R. So minx is set to 1. Then, in the second row (a=2), processing columns from right to left: column 3 is E, column 2 is E, column 1 is E, column 0 (if b1 starts from 3 down to 1, but m=3, then the columns are 3, 2, 1. So the code processes column 3 (E), 2 (E), 1 (E). But the R is in column 0, which is not processed. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the code's loop for columns is:\n\nfor(b1 = b; b1>0; --b1)\n\nBut 'b' is m (the number of columns). So the loop processes columns from m down to 1. \n\nBut columns are 1-based. So for m=3 columns, the code processes columns 3, 2, 1. \n\nBut the input's row is given as a string of m characters. So, for example, the first row of the first test case is \"E E R\", which corresponds to columns 1, 2, 3. So the code processes column 3 (R), which is the rightmost. \n\nBut in the first row of the first test case, the R is in column 3 (the third character of the string). \n\nThen, in the code's processing of the first row (a=3), the first character processed is the third character (R). So minx is set to 3. Then, the code processes the next two characters (E and E), which are columns 2 and 1. \n\nThus, the code's minx is 3. \n\nThen, processing the second row (a=2), the code processes columns 3, 2, 1. The second row is \"R E E\" (columns 1, 2, 3). So the first character processed is column 3 (E), then 2 (E), then 1 (E). But the R is in column 1 of the row (the first character of the string). But according to the code's loop, this is column 1. So the code processes column 3 (E), then 2 (E), then 1 (R). \n\nSo in the second row (a=2), the code encounters R in column 1. At this point, minx is 3. So the code checks if (b1 < minx) (1 <3), which is true. So check is set to 0. \n\nThus, the code would output NO. But according to the problem's note, the first test case's answer is YES. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. But according to the code's logic, the first test case's code would output NO, which is wrong. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's answer is YES. \n\nThus, the code's logic is wrong. \n\nSo the missing condition must be something else. \n\nBut why is the code giving the correct answer for the fourth test case? \n\nFourth test case has a robot in the upper left corner. \n\nThe code's processing:\n\nFor the first row (top row), the first character processed is column 1 (assuming m=1). So minx is set to 1. No other R's. Thus, check remains 1. So code outputs YES. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nBut in the first test case, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nSo, perhaps the code is not correctly tracking the leftmost robot in the top row, but instead, the code is designed to track the leftmost robot in each row, and compare it with the previous rows' leftmost. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition is incorrect. \n\nSo what's the correct condition for the else clause? \n\nThe code's minx is initially 0. The first R encountered in the grid (top row, rightmost column) sets minx to that column. \n\nFor any subsequent R, the code should check whether its column is less than minx. If yes, then it's invalid. \n\nBut in the first test case, the R in the second row's column 1 is less than minx (3), so code sets check to 0. But according to the problem's note, the answer is YES. \n\nSo this suggests that the code's logic is wrong. \n\nBut why is that? \n\nIn the first test case, the correct approach is to choose the R in row 0, column 2 (0-based). Then, to move left 2 times. \n\nBut the other R is in row 1, column 0. To move left 2 times, that robot would move to column -2, which is invalid. So how can the answer be YES? \n\nAh! I think I have misread the first test case's note. Let me re-read it. \n\nProblem note's first test case: \"in the first test case, it is enough to send a command to move left.\"\n\nAh! So sending a single left command. \n\nBut how does that work? \n\nOriginal positions:\n\nRow 0, columns 0: E, 1: E, 2: R.\n\nRow 1, columns 0: R, 1: E, 2: E.\n\nSending a left command:\n\nRow 0's R moves to column 1.\n\nRow 1's R moves to column -1 \u2192 explode. \n\nThus, the answer should be NO. But according to the note, it's YES. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the fourth test case's note says: \"in the fourth test case, there is already a robot in the upper left corner.\" So the answer is YES. \n\nBut in this case, the code correctly outputs YES. \n\nSo why is the first test case's answer YES? \n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the note. Or perhaps the input is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first test case's input has a robot in row 0, column 3 (assuming 1-based columns), and after moving left once, the robot moves to column 2, which is not the upper left. \n\nBut this doesn't solve the problem. \n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding of the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct but the missing condition is something else. \n\nLet's think differently. \n\nThe code's logic is:\n\n- For each row, process columns from right to left.\n\n- For each R, if it's the first R in the grid, set minx to its column.\n\n- For other R's, check if their column is >= minx. If not, check is 0.\n\nSo the code's logic is that all R's must be in columns >= the first R's column. \n\nBut this is only correct if the first R is the leftmost in the grid. \n\nBut how? \n\nIn the first test case's example, the first R is in column 3 (rightmost of top row). Other R's are in column 1 (second row's first column). So code's check condition is whether 1 >=3, which is false. So check is set to 0. Thus, output is NO. But the problem's note says the answer is YES. \n\nThis indicates that the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut the code is part of the problem, so perhaps the code is correct but the missing condition is the opposite. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's missing condition is (b1 > minx). Then, in the first test case, the R in column 1 (second row) is 1 >3 is false, so check is 0. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's missing condition is (b1 < minx), but the check is inverted. \n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif(/* condition */) { check=0; }\n\nSo if the condition is true, check is set to 0. \n\nSo for the else clause, when the R is in a column less than minx, the code sets check to 0. \n\nBut in the first test case's example, this would incorrectly set check to 0. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first test case's answer is YES. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nBut this suggests that the code is not the correct approach. \n\nBut since this is the code provided and we have to fill in the missing condition, perhaps the code is correct and we need to find the correct condition. \n\nPerhaps the code is intended to track the leftmost robot in the top row. \n\nSo, in the code's processing of the top row, the first R encountered is the rightmost. But as the code processes the row's columns from right to left, subsequent R's are to the left. So, for each R in the top row, we need to update minx to be the minimum (leftmost) column. \n\nBut the code currently sets minx to the first R's column and doesn't update it. \n\nSo to track the leftmost R in the top row, during the processing of the top row, whenever an R is found to the left of the current minx (i.e., in the same row), we need to update minx. \n\nBut the code's current code doesn't do that. \n\nBut the code's code has an if statement for minx ==0. \n\nSo, perhaps the code's logic is:\n\n- minx is initialized to 0.\n\n- For the top row (a =n), during processing, when a robot is encountered and minx is 0, set minx to b1. But for other R's in the same row, if their column is smaller (left), set minx to b1. \n\nBut the code's current code for the top row's first R is:\n\nif (minx ==0) { minx = b1; }\n\nFor other R's in the same row, minx is not zero, so the code enters the else clause. So, the code's current code doesn't update minx for other R's in the same row. \n\nThus, to track the leftmost R in the top row, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut to fix this, perhaps the code's condition should be:\n\nif (minx ==0 || (a == n && b1 < minx)) \n\nBut how to express this in the code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is that for the first row (a ==n), when processing R's, minx is the minimal column. \n\nBut the code's current code doesn't track that. \n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect, but the missing condition is supposed to be (b1 < minx). \n\nBut this would not work for the first test case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is that for all R's, their column must be >= the leftmost R in the top row. \n\nBut the code's logic is that the leftmost R in the top row is the first R encountered (rightmost), which is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut given that we have to fill in the missing condition, perhaps the correct condition is (b1 < minx). \n\nBecause in the code's logic, the first R encountered (rightmost in the top row) is set as minx. Any R to the left of that in the same row or in lower rows would have b1 < minx, and thus set check to 0. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, this would incorrectly set check to 0 in the first test case. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect, and the correct condition is different. \n\nBut perhaps the code's logic is intended to check if the current R is in a column that is less than the leftmost column in all previous rows. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's minx represents the minimal column among all R's encountered so far. \n\nBut the code's code doesn't update minx after the first R. So the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is correct, and the missing condition is (b1 < minx) but the code's processing of rows is reversed. \n\nBut this is a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering the rows in reverse order (processing bottom to top), and thus the first R encountered is the bottom row's rightmost R. \n\nBut that would mean that the code's minx is the rightmost R in the bottom row. \n\nBut this is not correct. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. \n\nLet me think of the code's intended approach. \n\nThe code's check is initialized to 1. \n\nFor each R:\n\n- If it's the first R (minx ==0), set minx to its column. \n\n- Else, check if some condition. If not, check becomes 0. \n\nThe code's answer is \"YES\" if check is 1. \n\nSo the code is trying to ensure that all R's (except the first) are in columns >= the first R's column. \n\nBut this is only valid if the first R is the leftmost in the entire grid. \n\nBut the code's processing of rows and columns means that the first R is the rightmost in the top row. \n\nThus, the code's logic is to require that all R's are in columns >= the rightmost column of the top row. Which is almost never possible. \n\nBut according to the sample test case 4, the code works. \n\nBut in sample test case 4, the first R is in the upper left corner (column 1), so any other R's must be in columns >=1, which is true. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct only if the first R encountered is the leftmost in the grid. \n\nBut how to ensure that the first R encountered is the leftmost in the grid. \n\nIn the code's processing, the first R encountered is the rightmost in the top row. \n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's logic is wrong, and the missing condition is supposed to be something else. \n\nBut given that this is a programming problem, and the code is expected to work, I must find the correct condition. \n\nLet me think about the correct condition that would make the code work. \n\nThe code's logic is:\n\nThe first R encountered (top row's rightmost) is the candidate. All other R's must be in columns >= this candidate's column. \n\nBut according to the problem's correct approach, this is only valid if all R's are in columns >= the candidate's column and rows >= the candidate's row. \n\nThus, the code's logic is missing the row check. \n\nBut the code's logic does not track rows. \n\nThus, the code is missing the condition to check whether the current R's row is >= the candidate's row. \n\nBut the code's code does not track the row of the candidate. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut since the code does not track the row, perhaps the condition should check both row and column. \n\nBut the code's code does not track the row. \n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nBut given that the code is provided, perhaps the correct condition is (b1 < minx) && (current row is not the top row). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition should check whether the current R is in a row below the first R's row. \n\nBut the code's code does not track the first R's row. \n\nThus, this is impossible. \n\nAt this point, I'm forced to think that the correct condition is (b1 < minx), and that the code's logic is correct, but I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's processing of columns is 0-based. \n\nFor example, when m=3, the columns are 1,2,3 (1-based) or 0-based. \n\nBut in the code's loop, for(b1 = b; b1>0; --b1), which for m=3 would process b1=3, 2, 1. \n\nBut the actual columns are 0-based. So column 3 is out of bounds. \n\nThis would be a problem. \n\nAh! This is likely the mistake. \n\nThe code processes columns from 1 to m, but the actual grid's columns are 0-based. \n\nThus, for example, in a grid with m=3 columns, the code's loop for b1 from 3 down to 1. So the code is processing columns 3, 2, 1, which are out of bounds. \n\nThis would be incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's processing of the columns is wrong, leading to incorrect results. \n\nBut how to explain this. \n\nFor example, if m=3, the valid columns are 0,1,2 (0-based). The code's loop for b1 from 3 down to 1 processes columns 3, 2, 1, which are invalid. \n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nBut the code's code is part of the problem. \n\nThus, the code's code is incorrect. \n\nBut given that this is a programming competition problem, and the code is expected to pass all test cases, perhaps the columns are 1-based. \n\nIn that case, for m=3, the columns are 1,2,3. \n\nThus, the code's processing of columns from m down to 1 is correct. \n\nBut then, the first test case's code would have R's in column 3 and column 1. \n\nThus, the code's condition would check if 1 <3, which is true. So check is set to 0. But according to the problem's note, the answer is YES. \n\nSo this is a contradiction. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nBut given that this is the code provided, I have to find the missing condition that makes it work. \n\nPerhaps the code's logic is to track the leftmost R in the entire grid, and ensure that all other R's are to the right and below. \n\nBut how to track this in the code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's minx is tracking the leftmost R's column, but the code's processing of columns from right to left ensures that the first R encountered in a row is the rightmost. Thus, any other R in the same row to the left would trigger the else clause. \n\nThus, the code's logic for the same row is to ensure that all R's are in the same column as the first R encountered in that row. \n\nBut this is not correct. \n\nAt this point, given time constraints, I think the correct condition is (b1 < minx). \n\nThus, the missing code is (b1 < minx). \n\nBut according to the first test case, this would incorrectly set check to 0. \n\nBut perhaps the code's logic is correct, and the problem's note is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's code is written to track the leftmost R in each row, and ensure that each row's leftmost R is to the right of the leftmost R in the row above. \n\nBut how to track that. \n\nAlternatively, the code's minx is the leftmost R in the current row, and for each subsequent row, the leftmost R must be >= the previous row's leftmost. \n\nBut how to track that. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the missing condition is (b1 < minx). \n\nSo, the code's else clause should check if (b1 < minx), which would set check to 0. \n\nThus, the missing code is 'b1 < minx'."
