The sample input from the note had a specific output. But when would the answer be zero? Probably when both n and m are 1. Because then, Stanley is already at his destination (1,1) and Megan is also at (1,1), which is her destination (since she needs to go to (1,m), which is (1,1) if m=1). So in that case, no movement is needed. But wait, according to the problem statement, their paths are from (1,1) to (n,m) for Stanley and from (n,1) to (1,m) for Megan. So if n=1 and m=1, Megan starts at (1,1) which is also her destination. So both have zero energy. So total is zero. So the condition is when n == 1 and m == 1. But wait, the code's if statement outputs zero, which would be correct in that case. So the missing condition is checking if both n and m are 1. Wait, let me check the code again. The code reads n and m, then checks if some condition, then outputs 0. So the condition is when both are 1. So the if condition should be (n == 1 && m == 1). Let's test this. For example, if n=1 and m=1, then the formula would be max(0,0)+2*0 +1 =0+0+1=1, but the correct answer is 0. So the code correctly outputs 0 when the condition is met. So the missing code in the if statement is checking whether both n and m are 1. So the condition is if (n == 1 && m == 1). But wait, maybe there's another case where the answer is zero. Let's think: if either of them doesn't have to move. For instance, if Stanley is already at the destination (n=1, m=1), then yes. But if n=1 and m>1, then Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,m). Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,m). Wait, no. For example, if n=2 and m=1, then Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (2,1).",
