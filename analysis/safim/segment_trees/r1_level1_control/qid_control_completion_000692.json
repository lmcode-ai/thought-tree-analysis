    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether it's possible to perform some operations on an array so that all elements end up with the same parity (all even or all odd). The operations allowed are adding 1 to all elements at odd indices or even indices any number of times. \n\nHmm. So each operation affects certain elements. For example, adding to odd indices (1-based, I assume) affects positions 1, 3, 5, etc. Wait, the problem statement says \"odd index\" but in programming, arrays are 0-based. Wait, no, the problem's first operation is adding 1 to elements with an odd index. Let me check the note. For example, in the first test case, the array is [1,2,1]. After adding even indices (since indices are 1-based?), adding even index elements (like index 2 here?), but the sample input's explanation says adding even index (so 2nd element) gives [1,3,1]. Oh right, so the problem uses 1-based indexing for the operations. So in code terms, the array is 0-based in Java, but the operations are considering 1-based indices. So when we perform an operation of type 1 (add to odd indices in 1-based terms), that would correspond to the elements at positions 0, 2, 4, etc. in 0-based terms. Because in 1-based, the first element is index 1, which is odd. So adding 1 to elements at 1-based odd indices is the same as adding 1 to 0-based even indices. Wait no. Wait, 1-based indices: positions 1, 3, 5... are odd. So in 0-based, these are 0, 2, 4... which are even indices. So when the operation is to add 1 to elements with odd indices (1-based), that translates to adding to even indices (0-based). Similarly, adding to even indices (1-based) is adding to odd indices (0-based). So in the code, when processing each element, the parity of the original index (1-based) matters. \n\nThe key is that each operation affects certain elements. Each time you perform a type 1 operation, you add 1 to all elements at even indices (0-based). Each type 2 operation adds 1 to elements at odd indices (0-based). \n\nThe goal is to make all elements even or all odd. So what's the parity of each element after some operations? \n\nEach element's parity depends on the number of times it's been modified. For example, an element at even index (0-based) can be modified by type 1 operations. Each such operation changes its parity (add 1). Similarly, elements at odd indices can be modified by type 2 operations. Each such operation changes their parity. \n\nBut the problem allows us to perform any number of operations of each type. So for each element at even index (0-based), the number of type 1 operations (say, x) will determine how many times it's been incremented. So its parity will be original parity + x mod 2. For elements at even index (0-based), their parity depends on x. \n\nSimilarly, elements at odd index (0-based) are modified by type 2 operations (say, y times). Their parity is original parity + y mod 2. \n\nSo to make all elements have the same parity, there are two possibilities: all even or all odd. \n\nLet's consider the two possibilities. \n\nCase 1: All elements must be even. \n\nFor each element, the parity after operations must be 0 (even). \n\nFor elements at even indices (0-based): (original_parity + x) % 2 == 0. So x must be (0 - original_parity) mod 2. But since x is the same for all even indices (since all type 1 operations are applied each time), we can choose x such that for all even indices, original_parity + x is even. But all even indices must have the same parity when x is applied. \n\nWait, no. Because x is the number of type 1 operations. So for all even indices, the parity after x operations is (a_i + x) mod 2. For all even indices, their original parities plus x mod 2 must be even. \n\nSimilarly, for odd indices (0-based), their parity after y operations (type 2) is (a_i + y) mod 2. This must be even. \n\nSo for all even indices: (a_i % 2 + x) % 2 == 0 \u2192 (x + a_i%2) %2 = 0 \u2192 x \u2261 ( - a_i%2 ) mod 2. So for all even indices, x must be such that x is (0 - a_i%2) mod 2. But if any two even indices have different a_i%2, then x must satisfy x \u2261 0 and x \u2261 1 mod 2, which is impossible. So in that case, it's impossible. So for all even indices, their a_i%2 must be the same. Similarly, for all odd indices, their a_i%2 must be the same. \n\nWait, but x and y can be chosen as any number of operations. So for case 1 (all even), even indices must have the same parity (so that x can be chosen as 0 or 1 to make all even indices even). Similarly, odd indices must have the same parity. \n\nSo for case 1 to be possible:\n\nAll even indices (0-based) must have the same parity. So either all even indices are even, and x is 0, or all even indices are odd, and x is 1. \n\nSimilarly, all odd indices (0-based) must have the same parity. So all of them are even (original even, so y is 0) or all are odd (so y is 1). \n\nBut then, after choosing x and y, the even indices' (x adjusted) and odd indices' (y adjusted) must be even. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nFor even indices (0-based):\n\nAll a_i % 2 must be equal. Let's call this even_parity. So even_parity can be 0 or 1. Then x must be (0 - even_parity) mod 2. \n\nFor odd indices (0-based):\n\nAll a_i %2 must be equal. Let's call this odd_parity. Then y must be (0 - odd_parity) mod 2. \n\nBut then, when we set x and y accordingly, the even indices become even, and the odd indices become even. So all elements are even. \n\nSimilarly for case 2: all elements must be odd. \n\nIn that case:\n\nEven indices (0-based) must have a_i%2 + x \u2261 1 mod 2. So x is (1 - a_i%2) mod 2. So all even indices must have the same a_i%2. \n\nOdd indices (0-based) must have a_i%2 + y \u2261 1 mod 2 \u2192 y = (1 - a_i%2) mod 2. So all must have the same a_i%2. \n\nSo the overall approach is: check if either:\n\nCase 1: All even indices have the same parity, and all odd indices have the same parity, and after adjusting x and y, all become even. \n\nOR \n\nCase 2: All even indices have the same parity, and all odd indices have the same parity, and after adjusting x and y, all become odd. \n\nBut how to check this? \n\nLet's model the possible scenarios. \n\nFirst, check whether all even indices (0-based) have the same parity. Then check all odd indices have the same parity. If this is the case, then it's possible to choose x and y to adjust them. \n\nWait, but what if after choosing x for even indices and y for odd indices, the parities are the same. \n\nFor example, for case 1: even indices adjusted to even, odd indices adjusted to even. So all even. \n\nFor case 2: even indices adjusted to odd (x = 1 - even_parity), and odd indices adjusted to odd (y = 1 - odd_parity). \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nEither:\n\nAll even indices have the same parity, and all odd indices have the same parity. Then, it's possible to choose x and y such that (even_parity + x) mod 2 is the same as (odd_parity + y) mod 2. \n\nWait, but for the overall parity to be same, (even_parity + x) mod 2 should equal (odd_parity + y) mod 2. \n\nBut x can be 0 or 1, and y can be 0 or 1. So there are four possibilities. \n\nSo even_parity and odd_parity are fixed. Then, can we find x and y such that (even_parity + x) mod 2 == (odd_parity + y) mod 2? \n\nYes, if even_parity - odd_parity \u2261 (y - x) mod 2. \n\nBut since x and y can be chosen, can we find x and y that satisfy this? \n\nLet me see. Let's denote:\n\neven_parity + x \u2261 odd_parity + y mod 2. \n\nRearranged: (even_parity - odd_parity) \u2261 (y - x) mod 2. \n\nBut x and y can be 0 or 1. So possible combinations:\n\nFor example, if even_parity - odd_parity is 0 mod 2: then (y - x) must be 0 mod 2. So y and x must be same. \n\nWhich is possible (x=0 and y=0, or x=1 and y=1). \n\nIf even_parity - odd_parity is 1 mod 2: then (y -x) must be 1 mod 2. So y = x+1 mod 2. So possible (x=0, y=1) or (x=1, y=0). \n\nSo regardless of the even_parity and odd_parity, as long as all even indices have the same parity and all odd indices have the same parity, then there exists x and y such that the overall parities are the same. \n\nWait, that's a key insight. So the only conditions are that all even indices have the same parity (even_parity) and all odd indices have the same parity (odd_parity). \n\nBecause then, regardless of even_parity and odd_parity, we can choose x and y such that the adjusted parities are same. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking two things for the array:\n\n1. All elements at even positions (0-based) have the same parity. \n\n2. All elements at odd positions (0-based) have the same parity. \n\nIf both are true, then output YES. Otherwise, NO. \n\nBecause if those two conditions are met, then we can find x and y to make all elements have the same parity. \n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1: n=3, array [1, 2, 1]. \n\nEven indices (0, 2) are 1 and 1 \u2192 same parity (1). \n\nOdd index (1) is 2 \u2192 parity 0. \n\nSo even_parity is 1, odd_parity is 0. \n\nSo we can choose x=1 (even_parity + x = 0) and y=0 (odd_parity + y=0 \u2192 even). So all elements even. Or x=0 (even_parity +0=1) and y=1 (0+1=1 \u2192 all odd). Wait, but in the sample explanation, after adding to even indices (even indices in 1-based terms, which is the same as adding to odd indices in 0-based. Wait, no. Wait the first sample's note says that adding even index (1-based) elements. So in 0-based that's index 1. So that's a type 2 operation (since type 2 is even indices in 1-based). \n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me re-express:\n\nOperation 1: add 1 to elements at odd indices (1-based). So in 0-based terms, these are even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). So operation 1 affects even indices (0-based). \n\nOperation 2: add 1 to even indices (1-based), which are 2,4, etc. In 0-based, these are 1,3,5..., which are odd indices. \n\nSo in the first test case, the array is [1,2,1]. Even indices (0 and 2) have values 1 and 1. Odd index (1) has 2. \n\nIf we perform a type 2 operation (adding to even indices 1-based, which is 0-based index 1), then the array becomes [1,3,1]. All elements are odd. So the answer is YES. \n\nSo in this case, the even_parity (0-based even indices) is 1 and 1, same. Odd_parity is 0 (since 2%2=0). \n\nSo according to our conditions, all even indices have same parity, and all odd indices have same parity. So answer is YES. \n\nAnother test case: second sample. The array is [2,2], which after operations. Even indices (0) is 2 (even). Odd index (1) is 2 (even). So even_parity is 0, odd_parity is 0. Then, according to conditions, answer should be YES, but the sample says NO. Wait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait the second test case is sample input 2:\n\nn=2, array [2,2]. Output is NO. \n\nWait according to our conditions, even indices (0) is 2 (parity 0). Odd indices (1) is 2 (parity 0). So all even indices have same parity, all odd indices have same parity. So the answer would be YES. But according to the sample, it's NO. \n\nWait this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. \n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me re-examine the sample.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=2, array [2,2]. The sample says output is NO. \n\nWhat's the possible outcome? \n\nIf we perform any number of operations. \n\nEach operation can be type 1 (add to even indices 0-based) or type 2 (add to odd indices 0-based). \n\nLet's see the possible parities.\n\nOriginal array is [2 (even), 2 (even)]. \n\nWe need to make all even or all odd. \n\nIf all even: possible. Original array is all even. So answer is YES. But sample says NO. Wait, but sample's explanation says that in the second test case, after any operations, it's not possible. But according to the original array, all elements are even. So the answer should be YES. But according to the sample, it's NO. \n\nWait this is a contradiction. So there must be a mistake in my understanding. \n\nWait the sample input 2's note says: \"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won\u2019t be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". \" But the initial array is [2,2], all even. So why is the answer NO? \n\nAh, wait, perhaps I misread the problem statement. Let me check again. \n\nProblem statement: Determine if after any number of operations it is possible to make the final array contain only even numbers OR only odd numbers. \n\nIn the second test case, the initial array is [2,2], which already has all even numbers. So the answer should be YES. But according to the sample explanation, it's NO. \n\nWait this is impossible. So there must be a misunderstanding. \n\nWait perhaps the sample input 2 is different. Let me recheck the problem statement's sample notes. \n\nProblem statement's sample notes:\n\nNote:\n\nFor the first test case: [1,2,1], after even index (1-based) operation, becomes [1,3,1], all odd.\n\nFor the second test case: after any operations, can't make same parity.\n\nWait the second test case must not be [2,2]. Let me check again. \n\nAh, perhaps the sample input 2 is different. Let me check the problem statement's notes again. \n\nWait the problem statement's notes:\n\nFor the second test case: \"we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is NO.\"\n\nBut what's the input for the second test case? Let me think. \n\nThe sample input is:\n\nProbably, the second test case's array is [2,3]. Then after any operations:\n\nOriginal array: even, odd. So parities are 0 and 1.\n\nIf we do some operations. Let's see:\n\nIf we do type 1 operation (add 1 to even indices 0-based, which is index 0. So array becomes [3,3]. Both odd. So answer is YES. So this would not fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case's array is [2, 2, 3]. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement's sample input. \n\nThe problem statement's sample input is not given, but the note says that the second test case's answer is NO. \n\nSo what's the actual input for the second test case? Maybe the array is [2,3]. Let's see:\n\nFor array [2,3], even indices (0) is 2 (even), odd indices (1) is 3 (odd). \n\nSo even_parity is 0 (all even indices, which is only index 0 here), odd_parity is 1 (index 1). So according to our condition, all even indices have same parity (yes), all odd indices have same parity (yes). Then answer should be YES, but according to the sample, this is not the case. \n\nWait, but according to our previous reasoning, if even_parity and odd_parity are same, then answer is YES. Wait no, even_parity and odd_parity can be different, but if the even indices have same parity among themselves and odd indices have same parity among themselves, then answer is YES. \n\nSo in the case of even_parity=0 and odd_parity=1, then even indices (all 0) and odd indices (all 1). Then, possible to choose x and y such that even_parity + x and odd_parity + y are the same. \n\nFor example, even_parity +x can be 0 +x, and odd_parity + y is 1 +y. \n\nWe need 0 +x \u2261 1 +y mod 2. \n\nWhich implies x - y \u2261 1 mod 2. \n\nPossible with x=1 and y=0: 1 -0=1 mod2. \n\nThen, even indices after x=1 (0+1=1 mod2) \u2192 parity 1. \n\nOdd indices after y=0 (1+0=1 mod2) \u2192 parity 1. \n\nSo all elements are odd. So answer is YES. \n\nSo in this case, the array [2,3] would return YES, but the sample says there's a test case that returns NO. \n\nSo perhaps the second test case's array is [2, 2]. \n\nWait, but in that case, even indices (0) is even. Odd indices (1) is even. So even_parity is 0, odd_parity is 0. \n\nSo, in that case, x can be 0 or 1, y can be 0 or 1. \n\nWe need even_parity +x and odd_parity + y to be the same. \n\n0 +x \u2261 0 + y mod 2 \u2192 x \u2261 y mod 2. So x and y must be same. \n\nIf x=0 and y=0: all even. \n\nWhich is possible. So answer is YES. \n\nBut the sample says that the second test case's answer is NO. So this contradicts. \n\nSo clearly, there's a flaw in my previous reasoning. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement. \n\nWait, the problem requires that after any number of operations, the array can be adjusted to have all even or all odd. \n\nBut how do the operations affect the parities? \n\nEach operation can be applied any number of times. \n\nBut each operation is a global operation. For example, each time you perform a type 1 operation, you add 1 to all even indices (0-based). So the number of type 1 operations x is the total times you've done this, which affects all even indices. Similarly for type 2 operations y. \n\nSo for even indices (0-based), their parity is (original_parity + x) mod 2. \n\nFor odd indices (0-based), their parity is (original_parity + y) mod 2. \n\nTo have all elements even: \n\n(even_parity_i + x) mod 2 == 0 for all even i. \n\n(odd_parity_j + y) mod 2 == 0 for all odd j. \n\nSo for even i, all even_parity_i must be the same. Because x is the same for all even indices. So if any even index has a different parity, then adding x will make some even and some odd. \n\nSimilarly for odd j. \n\nSo the first condition is:\n\nAll even indices have the same parity. \n\nAll odd indices have the same parity. \n\nOnly then can we choose x and y to make even_parity +x and odd_parity +y both even. \n\nThen, the adjusted even indices will be even, and adjusted odd indices will be even. \n\nOr, to make all elements odd:\n\neven_parity + x must be 1 mod2. \n\nodd_parity + y must be 1 mod2. \n\nWhich requires that all even indices have same parity, all odd indices have same parity, and then x and y are chosen such that:\n\nx = (1 - even_parity) mod 2 \n\ny = (1 - odd_parity) mod 2 \n\nBut then, even_parity and odd_parity can be different. \n\nSo the only necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All even indices have the same parity. \n\n2. All odd indices have the same parity. \n\nIf these conditions are met, then it's possible to choose x and y such that either all elements are even or all are odd. \n\nBut in the sample input 2, the answer is NO. So what's the input for that test case? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement's notes:\n\nSample 2: \"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". \"\n\nSample 3: all elements already have same parity. \n\nSample 4: array [1000, 1, 1000, 1, 1000], after one type 1 operation (adding to even indices 0-based), which are 0,2,4. Adding 1 to each of those. So 1000 becomes 1001 (odd), 1 becomes 2 (even), 1000 becomes 1001 (odd), etc. Wait, sample says after the operation, the array becomes [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001], which is all odd. So the even indices (0,2,4) are 1001 (odd), and the odd indices (1,3) are 1 (odd). So all elements are odd. \n\nSo in this case, even indices (original parities 0,0,0) \u2192 adding x=1 (1 operation of type 1), their parities become 1. The odd indices have original parities 1 and 1 (since 1 mod 2 is 1), and y=0 (no type 2 operations). So their parities remain 1. So all elements are odd. \n\nSo the conditions are met: even indices all have same parity (0) and odd indices all same (1). \n\nSo in that case, answer is YES. \n\nSo back to sample 2. Let's imagine the array is [2,3]. \n\nEven indices (0) \u2192 2 (even). Odd indices (1) \u2192 3 (odd). \n\nSo even_parity is 0. odd_parity is 1. \n\nWe need to choose x and y such that (0 +x) \u2261 (1 + y) mod2. \n\nPossible x and y:\n\nx=1, y=0 \u2192 1 \u2261 1 \u2192 yes. So even indices become 1 (odd), odd indices become 1 (odd). So all elements are odd. So answer is YES. \n\nBut sample 2's answer is NO. So perhaps the array is [1,2]. \n\nEven indices (0) \u2192 1 (odd). Odd indices (1) \u2192 2 (even). \n\nSo even_parity is 1, odd_parity is 0. \n\nThen, we need x and y such that 1 +x \u2261 0 + y mod2. \n\nPossible x=1, y=0 \u2192 (1+1) = 0 mod2, 0+0=0 \u2192 yes. Then even indices are 0 mod2 (even), odd indices 0 (even). All even. So answer is YES. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the sample 2's array is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the array is [1, 2, 3]. \n\nEven indices (0,2) \u2192 1 (odd) and 3 (odd) \u2192 same parity (1). \n\nOdd indices (1) \u2192 2 (even) \u2192 parity 0. \n\nSo even_parity is 1, odd_parity is 0. \n\nThen choose x=0 and y=1. \n\nEven indices: 1 +0 =1. Odd indices: 0 +1=1. All odd. So answer is YES. \n\nSo again, why is sample 2's answer NO? \n\nThis suggests that my previous approach is wrong. \n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that all even indices must have the same parity, and all odd indices must have the same parity, and that either even_parity equals odd_parity or they can be adjusted via x and y. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nLet me think differently. \n\nEach even index's parity depends on x (number of type 1 operations). \n\nEach odd index's parity depends on y (number of type 2 operations). \n\nWe can choose x and y (each 0 or 1, since adding 2 times would revert to original parity). \n\nSo for even indices, the parity after x operations is (original_even_parity + x) mod 2. \n\nFor odd indices, parity is (original_odd_parity + y) mod 2. \n\nWe need all even indices' adjusted parities to be the same as all odd indices' adjusted parities. \n\nSo:\n\n(original_even_parity + x) \u2261 (original_odd_parity + y) mod2. \n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nx - y \u2261 (original_odd_parity - original_even_parity) mod2. \n\nBut x and y can be 0 or 1. \n\nSo for this to have a solution, the difference (original_odd_parity - original_even_parity) mod2 must be achievable via x - y mod2. \n\nBut since x and y are each 0 or 1, the possible values for x - y mod2 are:\n\nx=0, y=0 \u2192 0-0=0\n\nx=0, y=1 \u2192 0-1 = -1 \u22611 mod2.\n\nx=1, y=0 \u2192 1-0=1 mod2.\n\nx=1, y=1 \u2192 0 mod2. \n\nSo possible differences are 0 or 1. \n\nThus, the equation x - y \u2261 (original_odd_parity - original_even_parity) mod2 has a solution if and only if the RHS is either 0 or 1. Which is always true. Because the RHS is either 0 or 1. \n\nWait, original_odd_parity and original_even_parity are each 0 or 1. So their difference mod2 can be 0 or 1. \n\nSo the equation will always have a solution. \n\nSo as long as all even indices have the same original parity, and all odd indices have the same original parity, then we can find x and y. \n\nSo the only condition is that all even indices have the same parity, and all odd indices have the same parity. \n\nBut according to sample 2, there's a case where this is true but the answer is NO. Which suggests that there's something wrong with this reasoning. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing a case where even indices have the same parity, odd indices have the same parity, but there's no way to choose x and y to make all elements have the same parity. \n\nLet me think of a test case. \n\nSuppose even_parity is 0, odd_parity is 1. \n\nThen, original_even_parity is 0, original_odd_parity is 1. \n\nWe need x and y such that 0 +x \u2261 1 + y mod2. \n\nSo x - y \u22611 mod2. \n\nPossible solutions: x=1, y=0 \u2192 1-0=1 mod2. \n\nThen, even indices become 0+1=1 mod2. Odd indices become 1+0=1 mod2. So all elements are odd. \n\nYes, possible. \n\nAnother example: even_parity 1, odd_parity 0. \n\nWe need x - y \u2261 (0-1) mod2 = (-1) mod2=1. \n\nSo x=1, y=0 \u2192 1-0=1 mod2. Then even indices become 1+1=0 mod2. Odd indices become 0 +0=0 mod2. All even. \n\nYes. \n\nSo in all cases where even and odd indices have same parity among themselves, it's possible. \n\nWhich brings us back to the conclusion that the only conditions are even indices all same, odd indices all same. \n\nBut sample 2's answer is NO. \n\nSo perhaps the sample's array is not meeting those conditions. \n\nFor example, let's say the array is [1,1,2]. \n\nEven indices (0, 2) \u2192 1 and 2 \u2192 parities 1 and 0. So even indices are not all same. So answer is NO. \n\nBut how to check this. \n\nSo the code needs to check:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Check all even indices (0-based) have the same parity. \n\n- Check all odd indices (0-based) have the same parity. \n\nIf both are true \u2192 output YES. Otherwise \u2192 NO. \n\nBut in the code provided, the arr is a 2x2 array. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code reads each element. For each element, it checks i%2 (0 or 1, for even or odd index), and temp%2 (0 or 1 for parity). \n\nThen, arr[i%2][temp%2]++ is counting how many elements in even indices are even or odd, and how many in odd indices are even or odd. \n\nSo arr[0][0] is the count of even indices (0-based) with even numbers. \n\narr[0][1] is the count of even indices with odd numbers. \n\narr[1][0] is the count of odd indices with even numbers. \n\narr[1][1] is the count of odd indices with odd numbers. \n\nSo for the even indices (0-based) to have the same parity, either arr[0][0] is 0 (so all even indices are odd) or arr[0][1] is 0 (so all even indices are even). \n\nSimilarly for odd indices: arr[1][0] is 0 or arr[1][1] is 0. \n\nSo the code's condition should check if (arr[0][0] >0 and arr[0][1] >0) OR (arr[1][0] >0 and arr[1][1] >0). \n\nIf either is true \u2192 there's a group (even or odd indices) that has mixed parities \u2192 answer is NO. \n\nOtherwise, answer is YES. \n\nSo the code's missing condition is whether either of the even indices group or odd indices group has both parities present. \n\nSo the code's if condition should check if (arr[0][0] !=0 && arr[0][1] !=0) || (arr[1][0] !=0 && arr[1][1] !=0). \n\nIn other words, if even indices have both parities or odd indices have both parities \u2192 output NO. \n\nOtherwise, output YES. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nif( (arr[0][0] > 0 && arr[0][1] >0) || (arr[1][0] >0 && arr[1][1] >0) )\n\nThen, set ans to NO. \n\nSo the code's missing line is:\n\nif ( (arr[0][0] > 0 && arr[0][1] >0) || (arr[1][0] >0 && arr[1][1] >0) )\n\nThus, the code would output NO in that case. \n\nSo in the sample test case 2, perhaps the array is such that even indices have both parities, or odd indices have both. \n\nFor example, array [1,2,3]. \n\nEven indices (0,2): 1 (odd) and 3 (odd) \u2192 same parity. \n\nOdd index (1): 2 (even). \n\nSo even indices are all odd, odd indices are all even. So the condition is satisfied \u2192 answer is YES. \n\nBut sample 2's answer is NO, so perhaps in that case, the array is such that even indices have both parities or odd indices have both. \n\nFor example, array [1,2,2]. \n\nEven indices (0,2) \u2192 1 (odd) and 2 (even) \u2192 different parities. \n\nSo arr[0][0] =1 (element 2 is even), arr[0][1] =1 (element 1 is odd). So the code would output NO. \n\nSo that's the scenario where the answer is NO. \n\nThus, the code's missing condition is checking whether either even indices have mixed parities or odd indices have mixed parities. \n\nSo the code's missing if condition is:\n\nif ( (arr[0][0] > 0 && arr[0][1] >0) || (arr[1][0] >0 && arr[1][1] >0) )\n\nIf this condition is true, then output NO. \n\nSo the answer is to fill this condition in the code. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n(arr[0][0] > 0 && arr[0][1] > 0) || (arr[1][0] > 0 && arr[1][1] > 0)\n\nSo the code's if statement is:\n\nif( (arr[0][0] > 0 && arr[0][1] > 0) || (arr[1][0] > 0 && arr[1][1] > 0) ) ans = \"NO\";"
