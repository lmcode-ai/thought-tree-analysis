            "text": "The problem is about finding the maximum square side length possible using n blocks, each with specific lengths. Let's break it down. The blocks are from 1 to n. The i-th block has a length of ceil(i/2). So for i=1 and 2, it's 1. For i=3 and 4, it's 2, and so on. So each pair of consecutive blocks (after the first two) increases the length by 1 every two steps. The total area of the square is side^2. The sum of all the blocks' lengths (since each is 1 unit high) gives the total area. So the maximum possible side is the largest s where the sum of the lengths is >= s^2. Wait, right. Because each block contributes 1xlength, so the area is the sum of lengths. So the sum of lengths must be >= s^2. We need the maximum s such that sum >= s\u00b2. So the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n, then find the largest s where sum >= s\u00b2. But calculating the sum directly for n up to 1e9 is impossible. So we need a formula. Let's find a formula for the sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\nFor even i: ceil(i/2) = i/2. For odd i: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. Let's separate into even and odd numbers. Let's see:\n\nFor n=1: sum is 1\nn=2: 1+1=2\nn=3:1+1+2=4\nn=4:1+1+2+2=6\nn=5:1+1+2+2+3=9\nWait, the example given in the problem for n=5, the sum is 1+1+2+2+3 = 9. Which is 3^2, so the maximum s is 3. So for n=5, the sum is 9. So the code's output for n=5 is 3. Let's see the code's current structure: depending on some condition, it outputs either n/2 or n/2 +1. Wait, for n=5, n/2 is 2 (since it's integer division), but the correct answer is 3 (n/2 +1=5//2 +1=2+1=3). So the code is using that formula, but under some condition. So the code's logic is that when the condition is true, output n/2, else n/2+1. So I need to find the condition that determines whether to use n/2 or n/2+1. Wait, but according to the problem statement's first example: when n=1, the output is 1. According to the code, if the condition is met, it would output 0 (1/2=0), which is wrong. Wait, the code structure must be incorrect, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the code's current approach is not directly the answer. Let's think again. Wait, perhaps the code is part of a mathematical approach where the maximum s can be determined by some formula based on n. Let's find the sum in terms of n.\n\nLet's calculate the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1}^n ceil(i/2). We can split into two cases: n even and n odd. Case 1: n is even, say n=2k. Then the sum is sum_{i=1 to 2k} ceil(i/2). For i=1: ceil(1/2)=1.\n\ni=2: 1.\n\ni=3:2, i=4:2, ..., i=2k-1: k, i=2k: k. So for even n=2k:\n\nThe sum is (1 + 1) + (2+2) + ... + (k +k) ) = 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) ) = k(k+1). So S(2k) = k(k+1). Case 2: n is odd, n=2k+1. Sum up to 2k is k(k+1), and then add ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1. So S(2k+1) = k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. So sum S(n) can be written as: If n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) = (k)(k+1), where k = n/2. If n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2. So for example, when n=5 (odd):\n\nS(5) = (5+1)/2 = 3, squared is 9. Which matches. When n=4 (even):\n\nS(4) = (4/2)*(4/2 +1) = 2*3=6. Now, we need to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S(n). So for even n=2k:\n\nS(n) = k(k+1) = k\u00b2 +k.\n\nWe need to find s such that s\u00b2 <= k(k+1). What's the maximum s here?\n\nk\u00b2 +k is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. For example, k=2: 2*3=6. s\u00b2 must be <=6. s=2 (4) or 2 (4), next is 3 (9) which is too big. So s=2. But wait, for k=2 (n=4), sum is 6. So s^2 must be <=6. The largest s is 2 (since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6). Wait wait, 6 is larger than 2\u00b2 (4) but 6 is less than 3\u00b2 (9). So maximum s is 2. But for n=4, the code would output n/2 =4/2=2, which is correct. So for even n, the code outputs n/2 if the condition holds. Wait, but according to our earlier example, for even n=4, the sum is 6. s\u00b2 must be <=6. The maximum s is 2 (since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, but 3\u00b2=9>6). So for even n, the sum is k(k+1) where k =n/2. So s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)). But what is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1))? Let's compute for some k:\n\nk=1: 1*2=2. sqrt(2)=1.414 \u2192 floor is 1.\n\nk=2: 2*3=6 \u2192 sqrt(6)=~2.45 \u2192 floor 2.\n\nk=3: 3*4=12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3. k=4:4*5=20 \u2192 sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4. So for even n=2k, s is the integer part of sqrt(k(k+1)). But how does this relate to k?\n\nWait, note that k(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor of that is k. But wait, for k=3, sqrt(12)=3.464, which is larger than 3. So floor is 3. So yes, s=k for even n? Wait, but in the case of k=3, sum is 12. s\u00b2=9 (3\u00b2) is <=12, and 4\u00b2=16>12. So s=3. Which is k=3. So for even n=2k, s=k. But sum is k(k+1). So k(k+1) >= s\u00b2 \u2192 s\u00b2 =k\u00b2 \u2192 k(k+1) >=k\u00b2 \u2192 k >=0. Which is always true. So the maximum s is k when sum is k(k+1). Because k\u00b2 +k is the sum, and s must be the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum. Wait, but for example, when k=3, sum is 12. s=3, s\u00b2=9 \u226412. But 3+1=4, 4\u00b2=16>12. So s=3. So yes, for even n, s=k =n/2. Wait, but what about k=2: sum is 6, s=2. So s=2 is the maximum. So yes, for even n, s =k =n/2. That makes sense. Because for even n, sum is k(k+1) which is >=k\u00b2 (since k+1 >=k). So s is at least k. But since sum is k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2 +2k +1=(k+1)^2. So sum is less than (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k. So for even n=2k, the maximum s is k =n/2. For odd n=2k+1, sum is (k+1)^2. Then s is k+1, because (k+1)^2 = sum. So s is exactly k+1. And (n/2) for odd n would be (2k+1)/2= k. So code for odd n would output (n/2 +1) which is k +1. Which is correct. Wait, for example, n=5 (odd): n=2*2+1. k=2. So code outputs 5//2=2, then adds 1 \u21923. Which is correct. Another example: n=3 (2*1+1). Then code outputs 3//2=1 +1=2. Sum is (1+1)^2=4. s=2. Correct. So the code's logic is:\n\nIf the sum for the given n is s squared, then for even n, the sum is k(k+1) where k is n/2. The maximum s is floor(sqrt(k(k+1)))=k.",

The code's structure is:\n\nfor each test case, read n.\n\nif (condition) \u2192 output n/2.\n\nelse \u2192 output n/2 +1. The question is, what condition would make the code output the correct s. The correct s is:\n\nfor even n: s = n/2.\n\nfor odd n: s = (n+1)/2 \u2192 which is equal to n//2 +1 (since n is odd, n divided by 2 in Java is integer division, so (n//2) is (n-1)/2, adding 1 gives (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2). So the code's output for even n is n/2. For odd n, it's (n//2)+1. So the code is correct when the condition is true for even n and false for odd n. So the code's condition must evaluate to true for even n and false for odd n. So the condition should check if n is even. But how? Because in the code, the condition is inside the test case loop, and it's written as: if (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n    System.out.println(n/2);\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(n/2+1);\n\n}\n\nSo the code is structured such that if the condition is true, output n/2, else n/2 +1. But when n is even, output n/2. So the condition should be true when n is even. So the condition could be (n % 2 == 0). But is that the case? But in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: n=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 output should be 1. According to code, (1//2) +1 = 0 +1=1 \u2192 correct. Sample Input 2: n=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 code outputs (5//2)+1=2+1=3 \u2192 correct. Sample Input where n=4 \u2192 even \u2192 code outputs 4/2=2 \u2192 correct. Another sample: n=6 \u2192 even. Sum is 3*4=12. s=3, which is 6/2=3 \u2192 correct. So the code seems to be correct if the condition checks whether n is even. So the condition is (n % 2 ==0). But wait, let me think again. But what about when n is even, but the sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1). Which is k(k+1) for k=n/2. The maximum s is k, which is n/2. So the code's output for even n is correct. For odd n, it's (n//2)+1, which is (n+1)/2.",

So the code checks if n is even, and if so, outputs n/2. Otherwise, outputs n/2 +1. But wait, the sample input for n=1: code would output 0 +1=1 \u2192 correct. Yes. So the correct condition is (n % 2 ==0). So the code's if statement should check if n is even. So the missing code is (n % 2 == 0). But wait, let's test for n=6 (even). sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Which is 6/2=3 \u2192 correct. Another example: n=8 \u2192 sum is 4*5=20. s=4 (4\u00b2=16 <=20, 5\u00b2=25>20). So code outputs 4 \u2192 correct. So the code works correctly when the condition is (n % 2 ==0). Thus, the missing code in the if condition is (n % 2 ==0). So the if statement should check whether n is even. So the correct code is:\n\nif (n % 2 ==0) {\n\n    System.out.println(n/2);\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(n/2+1);\n\n} Thus, the missing condition is (n % 2 == 0).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out the condition for the if statement in the given Java code. The problem is about finding the maximum square side length possible using n blocks, each with specific lengths. Let's break it down.\n\nThe blocks are from 1 to n. The i-th block has a length of ceil(i/2). So for i=1 and 2, it's 1. For i=3 and 4, it's 2, and so on. So each pair of consecutive blocks (after the first two) increases the length by 1 every two steps. \n\nThe total area of the square is side^2. The sum of all the blocks' lengths (since each is 1 unit high) gives the total area. So the maximum possible side is the largest s where the sum of the lengths is >= s^2.\n\nWait, right. Because each block contributes 1xlength, so the area is the sum of lengths. So the sum of lengths must be >= s^2. We need the maximum s such that sum >= s\u00b2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n, then find the largest s where sum >= s\u00b2. But calculating the sum directly for n up to 1e9 is impossible. So we need a formula.\n\nLet's find a formula for the sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\nFor even i: ceil(i/2) = i/2. For odd i: ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2.\n\nLet's separate into even and odd numbers. Let's see:\n\nFor n=1: sum is 1\nn=2: 1+1=2\nn=3:1+1+2=4\nn=4:1+1+2+2=6\nn=5:1+1+2+2+3=9\nWait, the example given in the problem for n=5, the sum is 1+1+2+2+3 = 9. Which is 3^2, so the maximum s is 3.\n\nSo for n=5, the sum is 9. So the code's output for n=5 is 3. Let's see the code's current structure: depending on some condition, it outputs either n/2 or n/2 +1. Wait, for n=5, n/2 is 2 (since it's integer division), but the correct answer is 3 (n/2 +1=5//2 +1=2+1=3). So the code is using that formula, but under some condition. So the code's logic is that when the condition is true, output n/2, else n/2+1. So I need to find the condition that determines whether to use n/2 or n/2+1.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement's first example: when n=1, the output is 1. According to the code, if the condition is met, it would output 0 (1/2=0), which is wrong. Wait, the code structure must be incorrect, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's current approach is not directly the answer. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is part of a mathematical approach where the maximum s can be determined by some formula based on n. Let's find the sum in terms of n.\n\nLet's calculate the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1}^n ceil(i/2).\n\nWe can split into two cases: n even and n odd.\n\nCase 1: n is even, say n=2k.\n\nThen the sum is sum_{i=1 to 2k} ceil(i/2).\n\nFor i=1: ceil(1/2)=1.\n\ni=2: 1.\n\ni=3:2, i=4:2, ..., i=2k-1: k, i=2k: k.\n\nSo for even n=2k:\n\nThe sum is (1 + 1) + (2+2) + ... + (k +k) ) = 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) )= k(k+1).\n\nSo S(2k) = k(k+1).\n\nCase 2: n is odd, n=2k+1.\n\nSum up to 2k is k(k+1), and then add ceil((2k+1)/2) = k+1.\n\nSo S(2k+1) = k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2.\n\nSo sum S(n) can be written as:\n\nIf n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1) = (k)(k+1), where k = n/2.\n\nIf n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo for example, when n=5 (odd):\n\nS(5) = (5+1)/2 = 3, squared is 9. Which matches.\n\nWhen n=4 (even):\n\nS(4) = (4/2)*(4/2 +1) = 2*3=6.\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S(n).\n\nSo for even n=2k:\n\nS(n) = k(k+1) = k\u00b2 +k.\n\nWe need to find s such that s\u00b2 <= k(k+1). What's the maximum s here?\n\nk\u00b2 +k is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. For example, k=2: 2*3=6. s\u00b2 must be <=6. s=2 (4) or 2 (4), next is 3 (9) which is too big. So s=2.\n\nBut wait, for k=2 (n=4), sum is 6. So s^2 must be <=6. The largest s is 2 (since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6). Wait wait, 6 is larger than 2\u00b2 (4) but 6 is less than 3\u00b2 (9). So maximum s is 2.\n\nBut for n=4, the code would output n/2 =4/2=2, which is correct. So for even n, the code outputs n/2 if the condition holds. Wait, but according to our earlier example, for even n=4, the sum is 6. s\u00b2 must be <=6. The maximum s is 2 (since 2\u00b2=4 <=6, but 3\u00b2=9>6). So for even n, the sum is k(k+1) where k =n/2. So s is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)).\n\nBut what is the floor of sqrt(k(k+1))? Let's compute for some k:\n\nk=1: 1*2=2. sqrt(2)=1.414 \u2192 floor is 1.\n\nk=2: 2*3=6 \u2192 sqrt(6)=~2.45 \u2192 floor 2.\n\nk=3: 3*4=12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor 3.\n\nk=4:4*5=20 \u2192 sqrt(20)=4.47 \u2192 floor 4.\n\nSo for even n=2k, s is the integer part of sqrt(k(k+1)). But how does this relate to k?\n\nWait, note that k(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+1. So floor of that is k. But wait, for k=3, sqrt(12)=3.464, which is larger than 3. So floor is 3. So yes, s=k for even n?\n\nWait, but in the case of k=3, sum is 12. s\u00b2=9 (3\u00b2) is <=12, and 4\u00b2=16>12. So s=3. Which is k=3. So for even n=2k, s=k. But sum is k(k+1). So k(k+1) >= s\u00b2 \u2192 s\u00b2 =k\u00b2 \u2192 k(k+1) >=k\u00b2 \u2192 k >=0. Which is always true. So the maximum s is k when sum is k(k+1). Because k\u00b2 +k is the sum, and s must be the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nWait, but for example, when k=3, sum is 12. s=3, s\u00b2=9 \u226412. But 3+1=4, 4\u00b2=16>12. So s=3. So yes, for even n, s=k =n/2.\n\nWait, but what about k=2: sum is 6, s=2. So s=2 is the maximum. So yes, for even n, s =k =n/2. That makes sense. Because for even n, sum is k(k+1) which is >=k\u00b2 (since k+1 >=k). So s is at least k. But since sum is k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k <k\u00b2 +2k +1=(k+1)^2. So sum is less than (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k.\n\nSo for even n=2k, the maximum s is k =n/2.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1, sum is (k+1)^2. Then s is k+1, because (k+1)^2 = sum. So s is exactly k+1. And (n/2) for odd n would be (2k+1)/2= k. So code for odd n would output (n/2 +1) which is k +1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, for example, n=5 (odd): n=2*2+1. k=2. So code outputs 5//2=2, then adds 1 \u21923. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3 (2*1+1). Then code outputs 3//2=1 +1=2. Sum is (1+1)^2=4. s=2. Correct.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\nIf the sum for the given n is s squared, then for even n, the sum is k(k+1) where k is n/2. The maximum s is floor(sqrt(k(k+1)))=k. For odd n, sum is (k+1)^2, so s is k+1.\n\nSo the code is outputting k for even n, and k+1 for odd n. But wait, in the code, the code outputs n/2 when the condition is true, else n/2 +1. Wait, for even n, n is even \u2192n/2 is k. Then output k. For odd n, output k+1. So that part is correct.\n\nBut what about the condition? The code says, if the condition is met, output n/2, else output n/2 +1. So the condition must be whether the sum allows for the maximum s to be n/2. But wait, for even n, s is k =n/2. For odd n, s is (n//2 +1). So the code's logic is that when the sum allows s to be n/2, which is the case for even n, then output n/2. Else, output n/2 +1. But how to determine when to choose between the two?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's current structure is designed to handle some cases where for even n, the sum might not allow s to be n/2, but that's not possible. Because for even n, sum is k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. s is the maximum integer where s\u00b2 <= sum. As we saw earlier, for even n, the sum is k\u00b2 +k, which is less than (k+1)^2. So the maximum s is k. So for even n, the code should output n/2 (k). For odd n, output (n/2 +1) (since n is odd, n/2 is integer division which gives k, and adding 1 gives k+1).\n\nSo the code's structure is:\n\nif (condition) output n/2 else output n/2 +1.\n\nSo the condition is checking whether the current sum allows s to be n/2. But for even n, the condition is always true. For odd n, the sum is (k+1)^2, so s is k+1, which is n/2 +1 (since n is odd, n=2k+1, so n/2 is k, and adding 1 gives k+1).\n\nSo why would the code ever output n/2 when n is even? Because for even n, s is always n/2.\n\nWait, but perhaps the code's approach is to compute s as the floor of sqrt(S(n)), but there's a different way to model this. Alternatively, perhaps there's a case where even though n is even, the sum S(n) could allow s to be higher than n/2. But according to our earlier analysis, that's not possible.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. For even n=2k, sum S(n) is k(k+1). So s is the maximum integer where s\u00b2 <= k(k+1). Let's compute s for some k.\n\nFor k=3: sum is 12. s=3 (3\u00b2=9 <=12, 4\u00b2=16>12).\n\nFor k=4: sum is 20. s=4 (4\u00b2=16 <=20, 5\u00b2=25>20).\n\nSo yes, s=k in even cases.\n\nSo in the code, when the sum is S(n), the maximum s is:\n\nif n is even: k =n/2 \u2192 s=k.\n\nif n is odd: s =k+1 = (n//2) +1.\n\nSo the code's condition should be checking whether the sum S(n) is >= (n/2 +1)^2. Wait, no. Wait, for even n, the sum is k(k+1). The maximum s is k. So (k+1)^2 is larger than the sum. So s can't be k+1. So the code's output for even n is k (n/2). For odd n, the sum is (k+1)^2, so s is k+1 (n//2 +1). So the code's structure is correct.\n\nBut the code's condition is not based on n being even or odd. Because in the code, the code is written as:\n\nif (some condition) {\n\n    output n/2;\n\n} else {\n\n    output n/2 +1;\n\n}\n\nSo the condition must check whether the sum S(n) is >= (n/2 +1)^2. Wait, no. Because for even n, the sum is k(k+1), which is less than (k+1)^2. So (k+1)^2 is larger than the sum. So the maximum s is k. So in code, when the sum is >= (k+1)^2, then output k+1, else output k. Wait, but that's the opposite.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a different approach. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe code's structure is:\n\nfor each test case, read n.\n\nif (condition) \u2192 output n/2.\n\nelse \u2192 output n/2 +1.\n\nThe question is, what condition would make the code output the correct s.\n\nThe correct s is:\n\nfor even n: s = n/2.\n\nfor odd n: s = (n+1)/2 \u2192 which is equal to n//2 +1 (since n is odd, n divided by 2 in Java is integer division, so (n//2) is (n-1)/2, adding 1 gives (n-1)/2 +1 = (n+1)/2).\n\nSo the code's output for even n is n/2. For odd n, it's (n//2)+1. So the code is correct when the condition is true for even n and false for odd n.\n\nSo the code's condition must evaluate to true for even n and false for odd n. So the condition should check if n is even.\n\nBut how? Because in the code, the condition is inside the test case loop, and it's written as:\n\nif (/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\n    System.out.println(n/2);\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(n/2+1);\n\n}\n\nSo the code is structured such that if the condition is true, output n/2, else n/2 +1.\n\nBut when n is even, output n/2. So the condition should be true when n is even. So the condition could be (n % 2 == 0). But is that the case?\n\nBut in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: n=1 \u2192 odd \u2192 output should be 1. According to code, (1//2) +1 = 0 +1=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nSample Input 2: n=5 \u2192 odd \u2192 code outputs (5//2)+1=2+1=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSample Input where n=4 \u2192 even \u2192 code outputs 4/2=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother sample: n=6 \u2192 even. Sum is 3*4=12. s=3, which is 6/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct if the condition checks whether n is even. So the condition is (n % 2 ==0). But wait, let me think again.\n\nBut what about when n is even, but the sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1). Which is k(k+1) for k=n/2. The maximum s is k, which is n/2.\n\nSo the code's output for even n is correct. For odd n, it's (n//2)+1, which is (n+1)/2. Which is correct because sum is ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo the code's logic is: if the number is even, output n/2, else output (n//2)+1. So the condition is (n % 2 == 0).\n\nSo the missing code in the if condition is checking if n is even. So the condition is (n % 2 == 0).\n\nBut wait, why in the code's sample for n=5, which is odd, the code outputs 2+1=3, which is correct. So yes.\n\nBut there's a problem: for n=3. Let's see. n=3 is odd. Sum is (3+1)/2 squared \u2192 2^2=4. So s=2. Code outputs 3//2 +1=1+1=2 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2 (even). Sum is 1*2=2. s=1. Code outputs 2/2=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nBut wait, another case: n=7 (odd). sum is ((7+1)/2)^2=4^2=16. s=4. Code outputs 7//2 +1=3+1=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nBut what about when n is even but the sum allows a larger s?\n\nFor example, n=2 (even): sum=2. s=1.\n\nn=4: sum=6 \u2192 s=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct when the condition is (n % 2 == 0).\n\nThus, the missing code in the if condition is (n % 2 ==0). So the code checks if n is even, and if so, outputs n/2. Otherwise, outputs n/2 +1.\n\nBut wait, the sample input for n=1: code would output 0 +1=1 \u2192 correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the correct condition is (n % 2 ==0). So the code's if statement should check if n is even.\n\nSo the missing code is (n % 2 == 0).\n\nBut wait, let's test for n=6 (even). sum is 3*4=12. s=3. Which is 6/2=3 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: n=8 \u2192 sum is 4*5=20. s=4 (4\u00b2=16 <=20, 5\u00b2=25>20). So code outputs 4 \u2192 correct.\n\nSo the code works correctly when the condition is (n % 2 ==0).\n\nThus, the missing code in the if condition is (n % 2 ==0). So the if statement should check whether n is even.\n\nSo the correct code is:\n\nif (n % 2 ==0) {\n\n    System.out.println(n/2);\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(n/2+1);\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing condition is (n % 2 == 0)."
