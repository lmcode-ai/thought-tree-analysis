But that's not possible because the code initializes ans as 0 when m is even, but that's not the sum. Hmm, perhaps the code is incorrect, but I need to fix the missing part. Alternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach. Let's think again. The problem is to choose a subset of members to invite such that the number of friend pairs in the subset is even. The goal is to minimize the sum of a_i for those not invited. The minimal possible sum is when we maximize the sum of a_i that are not included. Wait, no. Wait, the total unhappiness is the sum of a_i for members not invited. So to minimize this, we need to maximize the sum of a_i for those who are invited (since total_unhappiness = sum of all a_i - sum of invited a_i). So, the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of members where the number of friend pairs in S is even, and the sum of a_i for S is as large as possible (since sum_unhappiness = total_a - sum_S). But perhaps the code is trying to compute this in a different way. Let's see. In the code, after reading m, they compute ans. Then, for each friend pair, they compute the sum of their a_i and take the minimum. Then, in the loop over all nodes, check some condition to see if adding the node's a_i can contribute to a better ans. Wait, perhaps the code is considering two scenarios when m is odd:\n\n1. The optimal solution is to have an even number of friend pairs.",

Then the code sets ans to MAX_VALUE (since m is odd). Then, for the pair (x,y), ans becomes min(MAX, a_x +a_y). Then, in the loop over nodes, if some condition is met, take the min with a_i. Wait, the sample input's first case is n=2, m=1. The a_i's are 0 and 0. Then, the code's ans would be min(MAX, 0+0) = 0.

But that would require that the number of cakes is m -1. But how to achieve that. Wait, perhaps the code is based on the following idea:\n\nThe minimal sum is the minimal between:\n\na) The sum of a_i for all not invited (i.e., sum of all a_i) minus the sum of invited a_i. To minimize this, we need to maximize the sum of invited a_i. But how. Alternatively, the code is using a different approach. The code's ans is initialized to MAX if m is odd (meaning that we need to find a way to adjust the parity). For each friend pair, the code computes the sum of a_i + a_j (the sum if we exclude both of them?), but I'm not sure.",

So the missing condition in the code's if statement is checking whether the node's degree is odd. Therefore, the code should check if deg[i] % 2 == 1. So the condition in the loop over nodes is if (deg[i] % 2 == 1), then we can consider excluding that node, adding a_i to the answer. So the missing code is (deg[i] % 2 == 1). Testing this with sample input 2:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3, m=0. So m is even. The code initializes ans to 0. Then, since there are no pairs, the code doesn't process any pairs, so ans remains 0. Then, in the loop over nodes, the degrees are all zero (since m=0). So no node has an odd degree. So the ans remains 0. But the correct answer for this test case is 2, so this suggests that the code is wrong. But wait, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect for even m.\n\nWait, the sample input 2's description says that in that case, m is 0, which is even. The code's initial ans is 0. But the correct answer is 2. So sum a_i is 2+5+3=10. The minimal sum is 10 minus the sum of the invited a_i's. To get the minimal sum, we need to maximize the sum of invited a_i's. In this case, since m=0, there are no friend pairs, so the number of cakes is 0 (even). So the maximum sum of invited a_i's is the sum of the two largest a_i's. For example, inviting 2 and 3 (a_i's 5 and 3) sum to 8. So the unhappiness is 10-8=2. But according to the code's approach, the initial ans is 0 (which would imply sum a_i is 0?), which is wrong. So this suggests that the code is incorrect, and perhaps the missing code is not the only error. But according to the problem statement, the code is given with missing lines and blocks. So the code is partially correct, and we have to fill in the missing condition. But in the code's logic, the initial ans for even m is 0, which is clearly wrong. But according to the code, the answer is printed as ans. But in the first sample input, the correct answer is 0. Let's look at sample input 1:\n\nSample input 1: n=2, m=1. The a_i's are 0 and 0. The code's ans is initialized to MAX (since m is odd). Then, the pair (0,1) is processed, ans becomes 0+0=0.",

Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the sample explanation says that in the second test case, there are m=0 pairs. But according to the explanation, when inviting 2 and 3, the number of cakes is zero (which is even), so this is allowed. The sum is a_1=2. But if you invite all three, the sum is zero. So this suggests that the sample's answer is incorrect. So there's a contradiction here. But according to the problem statement, the sample input 2's correct answer is 2. So what is wrong here? Ah! No. The problem statement's sample input 2 is different. Let me recheck:\n\nIn the problem statement, the second test case's correct answer is 2. The sample input says:\n\nThe second test case's input is:\n\n3 0\n\n2 5 3 But according to this, m=0. So the code's approach for even m is to set ans=0. But the correct answer is 2. So this suggests that the code's approach is wrong. But the code's missing code is part of the solution. So what's wrong? Ah, perhaps the code is missing some other part.

So the missing condition is whether the node's degree is odd. So the code should check if deg[i] % 2 == 1. Thus, the missing code in the if statement is:\n\ndeg[i] % 2 == 1\n\nSo the line should be:\n\nif (deg[i] % 2 == 1) {\n\nSo the answer is the condition that checks if the node's degree is odd.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to fill in the missing condition in the if statement. The problem is about finding the minimum unhappiness value while ensuring that the number of cakes (friend pairs both invited) is even. \n\nThe code starts by reading the input. For each test case, if m is odd, the initial ans is set to MAX_VALUE, else 0. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the code: the initial ans is (m%2 ==1) ? MAX_VALUE : 0. Wait, maybe when m is even, the total cakes can be even (like 0, 2, etc.), but perhaps the best is to not take any friend pairs, leading to zero cakes (even), which would sum the unhappiness as sum of all a_i not invited. Wait, no, the initial code's approach is not clear. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem requires that the number of cakes (pairs where both are invited) is even. So the total number of cakes must be even. So, the solution depends on whether the original number of possible friend pairs (m) is even or odd. Wait, no. Because when you select a subset of the friend pairs, the count can vary. But the code's initial step is to calculate the minimum possible answer when m is even or odd.\n\nWait, let's look at the code. The ans is initialized as MAX_VALUE if m is odd, else 0. Hmm, but that can't be right. Because if m is even, perhaps the minimal case is to have zero cakes (by not inviting any pairs), which would sum all a_i's (since all are not invited). Wait, but that sum would be the sum of all a_i's. So the code's initial ans for even m is 0, but that's incorrect. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal possible answer by considering two possibilities: either the number of cakes is even (including zero), and then find the minimal unhappiness. The initial code seems to be taking the minimum between some options.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering two main cases. If m is even, then maybe the minimal case is to take all a_i's (invite no one), which gives zero cakes (even), so the total unhappiness is the sum of all a_i. But that's not possible because the code initializes ans as 0 when m is even, but that's not the sum. Hmm, perhaps the code is incorrect, but I need to fix the missing part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach. Let's think again. The problem is to choose a subset of members to invite such that the number of friend pairs in the subset is even. The goal is to minimize the sum of a_i for those not invited.\n\nThe minimal possible sum is when we maximize the sum of a_i that are not included. Wait, no. Wait, the total unhappiness is the sum of a_i for members not invited. So to minimize this, we need to maximize the sum of a_i for those who are invited (since total_unhappiness = sum of all a_i - sum of invited a_i). So, the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of members where the number of friend pairs in S is even, and the sum of a_i for S is as large as possible (since sum_unhappiness = total_a - sum_S).\n\nBut perhaps the code is trying to compute this in a different way. Let's see.\n\nIn the code, after reading m, they compute ans. Then, for each friend pair, they compute the sum of their a_i and take the minimum. Then, in the loop over all nodes, check some condition to see if adding the node's a_i can contribute to a better ans.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering two scenarios when m is odd:\n\n1. The optimal solution is to have an even number of friend pairs. Since m is the total possible pairs, but when m is odd, it's possible that even after selecting some pairs, the count could be even. But maybe the code is trying to find the minimal sum of a_i's for the pairs that are excluded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the approach is to find the minimal sum by either:\n\n- Forcing the number of cakes to be even. So if the original m is even, perhaps the best is to have all pairs not selected (so zero cakes, which is even). But that would require not inviting any member, leading to sum of all a_i. But the code initializes ans as 0 in this case, which is wrong. So perhaps the code is incorrect here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering that the minimal possible sum is achieved by either:\n\n- Choosing to have an even number of cakes. The possible ways to do this are:\n\n   a) Have zero cakes: which requires that no pair is selected. So all friends are not both invited. So, we can't invite any pair. So the solution is to select all members except those in pairs, but this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is:\n\nThe minimal answer is the minimal sum of a_i's of pairs (each pair's sum) and also individual a_i's. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nInitially, if m is odd, ans is MAX_VALUE. Otherwise, it's 0. Then, for each friend pair (a, b), ans is the minimum between current ans and a_i + a_j. Then, in the loop over all nodes, check some condition (the missing code) to see if the node's a_i can be part of a solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal possible sum that can flip the parity of the number of cakes. For example, when m is even, the minimal sum could be 0 (if we can have even cakes by selecting all possible pairs, but that may not be possible). Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal possible sum for when the number of cakes is even, which can be achieved by:\n\nCase 1: Even number of cakes, possibly zero. So the minimal answer is the minimal between:\n\na) The sum of all a_i (invite no one, zero cakes) \u2192 sum a_i. But the code initializes ans to 0 when m is even. That can't be right. So perhaps the code is wrong here. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a different approach. Let's think again. The code's initial ans for even m is 0, but that's probably a mistake. Let me think through an example.\n\nTake the first sample input. For example, the first test case:\n\nn=2, m=1. Then the code sets ans to MAX_VALUE (since m is odd). Then, for the pair (x,y), ans becomes min(MAX, a_x +a_y). Then, in the loop over nodes, if some condition is met, take the min with a_i.\n\nWait, the sample input's first case is n=2, m=1. The a_i's are 0 and 0. Then, the code's ans would be min(MAX, 0+0) = 0. Then, in the loop over nodes, perhaps the condition is checking for nodes that have an even degree. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal possible sum for two cases: when the number of cakes is even. So when m is even, the minimal sum is the sum of a_i's not in the invited set. To maximize the sum of a_i in the invited set. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the code seems to be computing ans as the minimal possible value. Let's think about the steps.\n\nWhen m is even:\n\n- We need the number of friend pairs in the invited set to be even.\n\nThe minimal possible sum is achieved by either:\n\n1. Not inviting any pairs (0 cakes, even). So the sum is sum of all a_i (since all are not invited). But this is sum a_i. But in the code, ans is initialized to 0 here. That can't be right. So perhaps the code is incorrect. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the initial setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's ans variable is not the sum of the unhappiness, but the sum of the a_i's of the invited members. Then, the code would be trying to maximize that sum. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is not even considering all possible scenarios. Let's think of the approach.\n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. To minimize this, we need to maximize the sum of a_i for the invited members.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find a subset S of members, where the number of friend pairs in S is even, such that the sum of a_i for S is as large as possible. Then, the answer is total_sum - sum(S).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nConstraints are up to 1e5 nodes and edges, so O(n + m) algorithms are needed.\n\nAn optimal approach could involve:\n\nCase 1: The number of friend pairs in the subset S is even.\n\nIf there are zero pairs (even), then S can have any members, but no two friends can be in S. So the maximum sum would be the sum of all a_i where no two are friends, which is like selecting an independent set. But finding that is NP-hard. So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the optimal solution may involve either:\n\n1. Having zero cakes (even), which requires that no two friends are invited. Then, the maximum sum is the maximum possible sum of a_i's where no two are friends. This is equivalent to the maximum weight independent set, which is not feasible for large n.\n\nOR\n\n2. Having even number of cakes (possibly 2,4,...). For example, selecting two pairs (4 cakes?), but how?\n\nBut considering that for large n and m, we need a smart approach.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal sum is the total sum of a_i minus the maximum sum achievable under the even cakes constraint.\n\nSo to find the maximum sum S where the number of friend pairs in S is even.\n\nThe key is to find S that either:\n\n- Has even number of friend pairs (could be 0, 2, ...).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAn alternative approach is inspired by the code provided. Let's look at the code:\n\nAfter reading m, the code initializes ans based on whether m is even or odd. Then, for each friend pair (a, b), ans is the minimum between the current ans and a_i + a_j. Then, in the loop over nodes, check some condition and possibly take the node's a_i into the ans.\n\nWait, maybe the code is considering the following:\n\nWhen m is even:\n\nIf we can have zero cakes (even), then the sum of a_i not invited is sum a_i. But the code's initial ans is 0. That seems wrong. So perhaps the code is wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach. For example, when m is even, the minimal possible sum is sum a_i minus the sum of the best possible selection of pairs and individuals. Wait, maybe not.\n\nLooking at the sample input 2:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3, m=0. Then m is even (0 is even). So initial ans is 0. Then, since m=0, there are no pairs. The code's loop over pairs does nothing. Then, in the loop over nodes, if some condition is met, take the node's a_i. But in this case, since m is even, the code's initial ans is 0. Then, perhaps the code's answer would be 0, but the sample's correct answer is 2 (when inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes, sum of a_i not invited is 1's a_i which is 2. Wait, no. Wait, in the sample input 2, the correct answer is 2, which is a_i of 1 (since 2 and 3 are invited, so their a_i are not added to the unhappiness. So the sum is a_1 = 2. So the code's initial ans is 0, but the correct answer is sum a_i - sum of invited's a_i. Sum a_i is 2 + 5 +3=10. Sum invited's a_i is 5+3=8. So unhappiness is 10 -8 =2. But how does the code compute that?\n\nThe code's ans variable seems to be the minimal possible sum of a_i for pairs or individual nodes. But perhaps it's not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal possible sum of a_i's that need to be excluded to make the number of friend pairs even.\n\nWait, maybe the code is considering the following approach:\n\nThe minimal possible answer is the sum of all a_i minus the maximum sum possible of invited a_i's. So the problem is to maximize the sum of invited a_i's while ensuring that the number of friend pairs in the invited set is even.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the code:\n\nThe code initializes ans to a large value if m is odd (so that we need to find a way to make the number of friend pairs even). Then, for each friend pair (a, b), the code considers the sum of their a_i's (hp[a] + hp[b]). The code takes the minimum of these, which is the minimal sum that could be excluded. Then, for each node, if the node's degree is even (or some other condition), it's considered as a possible candidate to be excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering two possibilities:\n\n1. The number of cakes is even. To achieve this, the code can:\n\n   a) If the total possible pairs (m) is even, then the minimal answer is to not invite any pairs (zero cakes, sum of all a_i).\n\n   b) But how? That's not correct, as seen in the sample inputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering that when m is even, the minimal sum is zero, which is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is getting confusing. Let's look at the code again.\n\nThe code after processing each pair, ans is the minimal sum of a and b's a_i. Then, in the loop over nodes, it checks some condition and possibly takes the node's a_i.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), the sum of their a_i's is the sum that would be added to the answer if we exclude them. Wait, but the code's ans is taking the minimum of these sums. So perhaps the code is considering excluding some pairs to flip the parity. For example, when m is odd, we need to exclude one pair (to make the total even), and the minimal sum for that exclusion is the minimal a_i + a_j. Then, ans would be that minimal sum. Then, in the loop over nodes, perhaps we can also consider excluding a single node (with even degree?), which would remove some pairs. But how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal sum between:\n\n- Excluding a pair (so the number of cakes is m - 1 (if m was odd, then m-1 is even, but how?), but maybe not. Or when m is odd, the initial approach is to find the minimal sum of a pair to exclude, which would make the total number of cakes even (if the original m was odd, then to have even cakes, we need to have even number of pairs, so we can have m -1 (if m is odd, subtracting one gives even). But that would require that the number of cakes is m -1. But how to achieve that.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is based on the following idea:\n\nThe minimal sum is the minimal between:\n\na) The sum of a_i for all not invited (i.e., sum of all a_i) minus the sum of invited a_i. To minimize this, we need to maximize the sum of invited a_i.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, the code is using a different approach. The code's ans is initialized to MAX if m is odd (meaning that we need to find a way to adjust the parity). For each friend pair, the code computes the sum of a_i + a_j (the sum if we exclude both of them?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, when m is odd, we need to have an even number of cakes. So one possible way is to have exactly m-1 cakes, which is even (if m is odd). But how to achieve that. Or perhaps the code is considering that the minimal way to adjust the parity is to exclude one pair (so the total cakes is m-1, which is even if m was odd). The sum of their a_i is added to the answer.\n\nWait, no. The sum of a_i is the sum of those not invited. So if we exclude a pair (i.e., not invite both), their a_i's are added to the sum. So, for each pair, the sum of a_i + a_j is the cost of not inviting them. So if m is odd, the code finds the minimal cost to exclude one pair (making the total cakes m-1, even), and then the minimal sum is this cost. But this would be the case only if all other pairs are included. But that's not possible because if you exclude a pair, other pairs may not be included.\n\nThis seems like a flawed approach, but perhaps it works for certain cases.\n\nBut according to the sample input 2, when m=0 (even), the initial ans is 0, but the correct answer is 2. But according to the code, the ans would be 0, which is wrong. So there's a mistake here. So perhaps the code is not correctly handling the cases where m is even.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal sum in a way that when m is even, the answer is the sum of all a_i minus the maximum possible sum of invited a_i's. But the code's initial ans is 0 for even m, which suggests that the sum of all a_i is 0, which is not the case.\n\nThis suggests that the code is missing some steps. Let's think again.\n\nIn the code, after reading the friend pairs, ans is the minimal sum of a_i + a_j for any pair. Then, in the loop over each node, the code checks a condition (missing code) and possibly takes a_i as a candidate for the minimal ans.\n\nThe idea here might be that the minimal sum is the minimal between the sum of a pair's a_i's or a single node's a_i. For example, if m is odd, the code needs to have even number of cakes. So one way is to exclude one pair (sum a_i + a_j), which makes the number of cakes even (m-1, which is even if m is odd). Alternatively, exclude a single node which is part of an odd number of pairs, thereby flipping the parity.\n\nWait, maybe the code is considering two possibilities when m is odd:\n\n1. Exclude a pair (x, y): the cost is a_x + a_y. The number of cakes is m-1 (even). So this is a valid case.\n\n2. Exclude a node that is in an odd number of pairs. Because when you exclude a node x, you remove all pairs that x is part of. So if the number of pairs that x is part of is k, then the number of cakes is reduced by k. If k is odd, then the total number of cakes becomes m -k. Since m is odd, m -k is even only if k is odd. So for this to work, k must be odd. So if we exclude a node x with odd degree, then the total cakes decrease by an odd number (from m, which is odd), resulting in even.\n\nSo the minimal cost between these two options is the answer.\n\nSo the code is checking for nodes with odd degree. Because if a node has an odd degree, then excluding it (thus removing all its pairs) will reduce the number of cakes by its degree, which is odd. So m (odd) - k (odd) is even.\n\nSo the code's missing condition in the if statement is checking if the node has an odd degree.\n\nIn the loop over nodes, for each node i, if deg[i] % 2 == 1, then excluding that node (i.e., not inviting it) would add a_i to the unhappiness sum. But also, excluding it would remove all the pairs that i is part of, which is deg[i] pairs. So the total cakes would be m - deg[i], which is even (since m is odd and deg[i] is odd). So this is a valid case.\n\nSo the minimal ans is the minimum between:\n\na) The minimal sum of a pair (a_i + a_j)\n\nb) The minimal a_i for nodes with odd degree.\n\nSo the missing condition in the code's if statement is checking whether the node's degree is odd.\n\nTherefore, the code should check if deg[i] % 2 == 1. So the condition in the loop over nodes is if (deg[i] % 2 == 1), then we can consider excluding that node, adding a_i to the answer. \n\nSo the missing code is (deg[i] % 2 == 1). \n\nTesting this with sample input 2:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3, m=0. So m is even. The code initializes ans to 0. Then, since there are no pairs, the code doesn't process any pairs, so ans remains 0. Then, in the loop over nodes, the degrees are all zero (since m=0). So no node has an odd degree. So the ans remains 0. But the correct answer for this test case is 2, so this suggests that the code is wrong. But wait, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect for even m.\n\nWait, the sample input 2's description says that in that case, m is 0, which is even. The code's initial ans is 0. But the correct answer is 2. So sum a_i is 2+5+3=10. The minimal sum is 10 minus the sum of the invited a_i's. To get the minimal sum, we need to maximize the sum of invited a_i's. \n\nIn this case, since m=0, there are no friend pairs, so the number of cakes is 0 (even). So the maximum sum of invited a_i's is the sum of the two largest a_i's. For example, inviting 2 and 3 (a_i's 5 and 3) sum to 8. So the unhappiness is 10-8=2. But according to the code's approach, the initial ans is 0 (which would imply sum a_i is 0?), which is wrong.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is incorrect, and perhaps the missing code is not the only error. But according to the problem statement, the code is given with missing lines and blocks. So the code is partially correct, and we have to fill in the missing condition.\n\nBut in the code's logic, the initial ans for even m is 0, which is clearly wrong. But according to the code, the answer is printed as ans. But in the first sample input, the correct answer is 0. Let's look at sample input 1:\n\nSample input 1: n=2, m=1. The a_i's are 0 and 0. The code's ans is initialized to MAX (since m is odd). Then, the pair (0,1) is processed, ans becomes 0+0=0. Then, in the loop over nodes, if any node has odd degree (each has degree 1), then ans is min(0, 0) \u2192 remains 0. So the code outputs 0, which is correct.\n\nSample input 2: m=0 (even). So code's ans is 0. Then, since there are no pairs, ans remains 0. The loop over nodes checks if any node has odd degree. Since all degrees are 0 (even), the condition is not met. So ans remains 0. The code outputs 0, but the correct answer is 2. So the code's approach is incorrect. So there's a problem in the code's logic.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code has missing lines, so perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the code's initial ans is set incorrectly when m is even.\n\nWait, perhaps when m is even, the minimal ans is the sum of all a_i's minus the maximum possible sum of a_i's of a subset where the number of friend pairs is even.\n\nBut how to compute that. For even m, the code's initial ans is 0, which seems to be wrong. So perhaps the code is missing code for the even m case.\n\nBut the problem requires us to fill in the missing line. Looking at the code, after processing the pairs, there is a loop over all nodes where, for each node, if some condition is met, then ans is the minimum between the current ans and the node's a_i.\n\nThe code's current approach for even m is to set ans to 0. But that's wrong, but perhaps the code is missing some other handling for even m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is:\n\nFor any m, the minimal possible answer is the minimal of:\n\n1. The sum of a_i for all not invited (if we can have zero cakes, which is even). So sum a_i. But this is possible only if no two friends are invited. So the maximum sum of a_i's where no two are friends. But this is the maximum independent set problem, which is NP-hard. So that's not feasible for large n.\n\n2. The minimal sum of a pair's a_i's plus the sum of other a_i's not in the pair (if we exclude a pair, but this depends on the parity).\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach may be to:\n\nWhen m is even, the minimal answer is the sum of all a_i minus the sum of all a_i (i.e., zero). But that's only possible if all are invited, which is only possible if there are no friend pairs. But in cases where there are friend pairs, this is not possible.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect, but perhaps the missing code is as I thought: checking if deg[i] is odd.\n\nBut how does that help in the even case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's ans variable is the sum of the a_i's of the excluded members. So for even m, the code's initial ans is 0 (sum of excluded a_i's is 0 \u2192 sum of invited a_i's is sum a_i \u2192 which is possible only if all are invited, which requires that there are no friend pairs. But in the first sample input, m=1 (odd), and code's ans becomes 0, which would imply that all are invited (sum of a_i's is 0, which is correct).\n\nBut for even m, if there are friend pairs, then inviting all members would result in m cakes, which is even, so that's allowed. So the sum of excluded a_i's is 0, which is the initial ans. So the code's ans is the sum of excluded a_i's, and when m is even, the minimal is 0 (invite all). So for even m, the code's ans is 0, which is correct if you can invite all members. But this is only possible if inviting all members results in an even number of cakes. Which is true if m is even. Because the number of cakes is the number of friend pairs where both are invited. So if all are invited, the number of cakes is m, which is even. So in this case, the minimal sum is 0 (exclude none), so ans is 0. But in the sample input 2, m is 0 (even). So according to the code's ans, the sum of excluded a_i's is 0 (invite all). So the sum of a_i's not invited is 0. But the correct answer is 2, because when all are invited (since m=0, zero cakes, even), the sum of excluded is 0. But the sample input 2's correct answer is 2, which implies that the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input 2's description says that the correct answer is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. Wait, what's the a_i array in that case?\n\nSample input 2:\n\na_i are 2, 5, 3. So sum a_i is 2+5+3=10.\n\nIf you invite all three, then since m=0, there are zero cakes (even). So the sum of excluded a_i's is zero (since all are invited), which gives unhappiness 0. But the sample's correct answer is 2. So this is conflicting. But according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 2. But according to this, the code's approach is wrong.\n\nBut wait, the sample input 2's m is 0. So the code's initial ans is 0 (for even m). Then, since there are no pairs, ans remains 0. Then, in the loop over nodes, since all degrees are 0 (even), the code does not take any node's a_i. So the ans is 0. But according to the sample, the correct answer is 2. So this is a contradiction. So what's wrong here.\n\nAh, wait, the sample input 2's correct answer is 2 because the code's approach is incorrect. But according to the problem's description, the code must be completed with the missing code, and when filled in correctly, the code will produce the correct output.\n\nSo this suggests that the code's approach is correct, but there's a misunderstanding in the sample input.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the sample input 2.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=3, m=0. So there are no friend pairs. The a_i array is [2,5,3].\n\nThe problem requires to choose a subset of members to invite, such that the number of cakes (friend pairs in the subset) is even. Since m=0, there are no friend pairs. So the number of cakes is zero, which is even. So any subset is allowed. The goal is to minimize the sum of a_i's not invited.\n\nSo the best way is to invite all members. Then, the sum of a_i's not invited is zero. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 2. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation for the second test case, the correct answer is 2. But according to this reasoning, the correct answer should be 0. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the second test case, the following options are possible:\n\n- invite 1 and 2: 0 cakes, unhappiness value is 3 (a_3=3).\n\n- invite 2 and 3: unhappiness is 2 (a_1=2).\n\n- invite only 1: unhappiness is 5+3=8.\n\nWait, no. The unhappiness value is the sum of a_i's of members not invited. So for the case where you invite 2 and 3, the not invited members are 1. So sum is 2, which is the correct answer.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code's ans variable is supposed to compute the minimal sum of a_i's not invited. So why in this case, when you can invite all members (sum not invited is 0), the answer is 2?\n\nAh, because in the case where m=0, the number of cakes is zero (even), so inviting all members is allowed. So the sum of a_i's not invited is zero, which is better than the sample's answer of 2.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 2. So this suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, or there's a misunderstanding.\n\nBut according to the sample input 2's description:\n\nThe input is:\n\nn=3, m=0.\n\na_i array is 2,5,3.\n\nThen, the sample explanation says that the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which gives sum 2. But why not invite all three, which gives sum 0?\n\nAh! Because the sample input must have been m=1, not m=0. Or perhaps the sample input's description is incorrect. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that in the second test case, there are m=0 pairs. But according to the explanation, when inviting 2 and 3, the number of cakes is zero (which is even), so this is allowed. The sum is a_1=2. But if you invite all three, the sum is zero. So this suggests that the sample's answer is incorrect. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample input 2's correct answer is 2. So what is wrong here?\n\nAh! No. The problem statement's sample input 2 is different. Let me recheck:\n\nIn the problem statement, the second test case's correct answer is 2. The sample input says:\n\nThe second test case's input is:\n\n3 0\n\n2 5 3\n\nBut according to this, m=0. So the code's approach for even m is to set ans=0. But the correct answer is 2. So this suggests that the code's approach is wrong. But the code's missing code is part of the solution. So what's wrong?\n\nAh, perhaps the code is missing some other part. For even m, the code's ans is set to 0 initially. Then, it processes each pair and takes the minimal sum of a_i + a_j. But when m is even and zero, the code's ans is 0, which would imply that the sum of a_i's not invited is zero (invite all). But in reality, this is allowed, and the sum is zero. So why is the sample's answer 2?\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the sample explanation. But the sample explanation's input must have m=1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the test case has m=0. But the code's ans would output 0, which is not the sample's answer. So this suggests that the code is incorrect, but the problem requires us to fill in the missing code.\n\nBut perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the code's ans variable is not the sum of a_i's not invited, but the sum of a_i's of invited members. So the code's ans is the maximum sum of invited members, and the answer is the sum of all a_i minus ans. \n\nFor example, in the second test case, sum a_i is 2+5+3=10. If the code's ans is 8 (sum of invited members 5+3=8), then the answer is 10-8=2. But how does the code compute this.\n\nIf the code's ans variable is the maximum sum of invited members, then the code's approach makes more sense. \n\nLet me re-express the problem in terms of maximizing the sum of invited members. Then, the answer is sum(a_i) - sum_invited.\n\nSo the code's ans variable represents the maximum sum_invited. \n\nThen, for even m:\n\n- If m is even, the maximum sum_invited is sum a_i (invite all), which gives sum_invited = sum(a_i). Then the answer is 0.\n\nBut in the sample input 2's case, sum(a_i) is 10. So answer is 10-10=0. But the sample's answer is 2. So this is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's ans variable is the sum of a_i's of the excluded members. So the code's ans is the minimal sum of excluded members. \n\nIn the first sample test case, all are invited. Excluded sum is 0. Which matches the code's output.\n\nIn the second test case, the correct answer is 2. Excluded sum is 2 (member 1). So code's ans should be 2. But according to the code's current logic, for even m (m=0), the initial ans is 0, which is sum of excluded members when all are invited (sum 0). But the sample's correct answer is 2.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is wrong for even m. But according to the problem statement, we are to fill in the missing code. So perhaps the code's approach is correct but is missing handling of even m cases.\n\nBut then, how to handle even m. Let's think again.\n\nThe code initializes ans to 0 if m is even, which would imply that the sum of excluded a_i's is 0 (invite all). But in cases where inviting all is possible (i.e., the number of cakes is even, which is m), but for even m, this is allowed. So why in the second test case, the code's ans is 0, but the correct answer is 2.\n\nAh! Because the code's ans variable is not the sum of excluded a_i's but something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal sum of a_i's that need to be excluded to achieve an even number of cakes. \n\nFor even m:\n\nIf m is even, then including all pairs would give m cakes (even). So no need to exclude any pairs. So sum excluded a_i's is 0. So code's initial ans is 0.\n\nBut in the second test case, m is 0 (even). So sum excluded is 0. But sample's answer is 2. So this is a contradiction. So what's wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem states that the number of cakes is the number of friend pairs such that both are invited. So in the second test case, there are no friend pairs. So the number of cakes is zero (even). So any subset of invited members is allowed. So the optimal solution is to invite all members, sum of a_i not invited is zero. So why is the sample's answer 2.\n\nThis suggests that there is a mistake in the sample explanation or the code's approach. But according to the sample explanation, the correct answer is 2, which is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. But this is only possible if there is a constraint that is not considered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct and the sample explanation is wrong. But according to the problem statement, the code must be completed to pass all test cases.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's focus on filling in the missing code.\n\nIn the code, the missing condition is in the loop over nodes. The code is checking whether a node's degree has a certain parity. The code's approach seems to be that when m is odd, the minimal ans is the minimal between excluding a pair (sum a_i + a_j) or excluding a node with odd degree (sum a_i).\n\nSo the missing condition is whether the node's degree is odd. So the code should check if deg[i] % 2 == 1.\n\nThus, the missing code in the if statement is:\n\ndeg[i] % 2 == 1\n\nSo the line should be:\n\nif (deg[i] % 2 == 1) {\n\nSo the answer is the condition that checks if the node's degree is odd."
