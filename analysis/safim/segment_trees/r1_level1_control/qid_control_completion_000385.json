Hmm. So the problem is more complex than just checking the first and last characters. Alternative approach: perhaps each operation can be thought of as merging two characters into one. Each operation reduces the string length by 1, and each operation's choice affects the remaining characters. Another idea: the final character after all operations depends on the original string's first and last characters. Because each merge step can be thought of as replacing two adjacent differing characters with one of them. For example, \"01\" becomes 1, so the merged result is the second character. Similarly, \"10\" becomes 0, the first character.",

Length 3: 010 \u2192 valid. So total valid is 3 (length 1) + 2 (length 2) + 1 (length3) = 6. But according to the note, the answer is 5, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the third sample's input is \"001\", as in the first example given in the problem description. Let's see:\n\nThe problem's first example is T=001. So the sample input S is 001. The substrings are:\n\nSingle characters: 3. Length 2: 0-0 (invalid), 0-1 (valid), 0-1 (valid). Wait, the substrings of length 2 would be [0,0], [0,1], and [0,1] (for positions 1-2, 2-3, 1-3 is length 3). Wait, no. The substring of length 2 for 001 is:\n\npositions 1-2: \"00\" \u2192 invalid.\n\npositions 2-3: \"01\" \u2192 valid. positions 1-3 is the entire string of length 3. So the valid substrings of length 2 are one. So for the entire string, the answer would be 3 (single) +1 (length 2) +1 (length 3) =5, which matches the note's statement. So the third sample's input is \"001\" perhaps. So the note says that in the third sample, all substrings are valid except [S2S3] (which is \"01\"? No, because that is valid).",

Wait, but if the substring is all 0s or all 1s, like \"000\", then there are no \"01\" or \"10\" pairs. So such substrings cannot be reduced if their length is >=2.

So the problem reduces to counting all possible pairs (l, r) and subtracting the number of contiguous all-0 or all-1 substrings. So the solution would be:\n\nTotal pairs = n*(n+1)/2\n\nSubtract the number of all-0 contiguous substrings and all-1 contiguous substrings. For example, for the third sample input where S is \"001\", the invalid substrings are: For all 0s: the substring [0,0] (positions 1-2), and any single 0s? No, because single characters are valid. So the all-0 contiguous substrings of length >=2 are:\n\n- positions 1-2: length 2. All-1 contiguous substrings: none except the single character. So the number of invalid substrings is 1 (all-0 of length 2) and 0 (all-1 of length >=2). So total invalid is 1. So the answer would be 3*(3+1)/2 - 1 = 6 -1=5, which matches the sample. Another example: the third sample in the problem's note has S=000. The invalid substrings are all contiguous 0s of length >=2. The number of such substrings is (3-1)*3/2 - 3 + ...

So the total invalid is sum over all runs of 0s and 1s of (k*(k-1)/2). So the formula is:\n\nanswer = total_pairs - sum_{k in runs} (k * (k-1) ) / 2\n\nWhere runs are all the consecutive sequences of 0s and 1s in the string. Yes! Because for a run of length k, there are k*(k+1)/2 possible substrings (from length 1 to k). But the invalid substrings are those of length >=2, which is k*(k+1)/2 - k (subtract the 1-length substrings) = k*(k-1)/2. So the solution is to compute for each test case:\n\nans = n*(n+1)/2 - sum (k*(k-1)/2 for each run of 0s or 1s) So for example, the third sample's input is \"001\", which has runs:\n\n00 (length 2) \u2192 contributes 2*1/2=1. 1 (length 1) \u2192 contributes 0. So sum is 1. So ans = 3*4/2 -1 =6-1=5. Which matches the sample. Another example: the third sample in the problem's note is S=000. The runs are 3 consecutive 0s. So sum is 3*2/2=3. ans=3*4/2 -3=6-3=3. Which matches the sample note. Another example: S=01. Runs are 0 (1), 1 (1). sum is 0. ans=2*3/2=3, which matches sample 2. So the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the total number of substrings (n*(n+1)/2) and subtract the number of invalid substrings (contiguous runs of 0s or 1s of length >=2, calculated as sum (k*(k-1)/2 for each run of length k)). So the code needs to: For each test case:\n\n1. Read the string S.\n\n2. Split S into runs of consecutive 0s and 1s. 3. For each run length k, compute k*(k-1)/2 and sum them all.\n\n4. The answer is (n*(n+1)/2) - sum. So now, the code in Java needs to implement this. Looking at the code provided:\n\nThe initial code reads t test cases. For each test case:\n\nn is read. s is read. ans is initialized as n (sum of all single-character substrings). Then, there's a loop for i from 1 to n-1. For each i, if some condition, add i to ans. Wait, but according to the correct approach, the total pairs are n*(n+1)/2. The code currently starts ans as n, then for i from 1 to n-1, adds i if some condition, which would make ans = n + sum over i where condition is true. But that's not how the total pairs are calculated. So there's a mistake in the initial code's approach. Wait, the initial code's approach seems to be adding to ans the number of valid substrings. But according to the code provided:\n\nlong ans =n;\n\nfor(int i=1;i<n;i++){\n\n    if(/* TODO */) ans +=i;\n\n} But this code seems to compute ans as n + sum over i=1 to n-1 of i if condition is met. Which for n=3 would be n=3, then i=1 and 2. But for example, if the condition is always true, then ans would be 3 +1 +2=6. Which is 3*4/2=6. So perhaps the code is trying to compute the total number of valid substrings (including all possible pairs) and subtract the invalid ones. But the initial code's approach is unclear.",

So according to the correct approach, the answer should be 5. But according to the code's initial code:\n\nans is initialized as 3 (n=3). Then, for i from 1 to 2 (i=1 and 2). For each i, if condition is true, add i to ans. For i=1: if condition is true, ans +=1 \u2192 ans=4. For i=2: if condition is true, ans +=2 \u2192 ans=6. But the correct answer is 5. Hmm. So this suggests that the code's approach is different. So perhaps the code is trying to count the valid substrings in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps the code's logic is: For each possible substring (l, r), where r = l + i, but I'm not sure.",

At i=1: S[1] == S[0], so no new valid substrings. So the count is 0. At i=2: S[2] != S[1], so the number of valid substrings ending here is (i-1) - last position where a transition occurred. Alternatively, for each i, we can track the length of the current valid run. For example, when a transition occurs (S[i] ! = S[i-1]), the current run increases. The number of valid substrings ending at i is equal to the current run's length. For example:\n\nIn \"001\":\n\ni=0: run =1.\n\ni=1: S[i] == S[i-1], so run=1 (reset to 1, since no transition). i=2: S[i] ! = S[i-1], so run becomes 2.",

Then, for each i, the code adds (current run -1) to ans. In the example:\n\nFor \"001\", the runs are:\n\ni=0: run=1, but since i=0 (starting index?), perhaps not considered. Then, for i=1: same as previous, run=1. current run-1 is 0 \u2192 added 0. For i=2: different from previous, run=2. current run-1 is 1 \u2192 added 1. So the total ans would be 3 (initial) +0 +1=4.

Then, each time there's a transition, current increases by 1. The number of valid substrings ending at i is current-1. So for example:\n\nString \"01\":\n\ni=1: s[1] != s[0]. current=2. valid substrings ending at 1:1 (length 2). So adding 1 to ans (which was initialized to 2). ans becomes 3, which matches the sample. Another example: \"001\". i=1: s[1] == s[0]. current=1. valid substrings: 0.\n\ni=2: s[2] ! = s[1]. current=2. valid substrings:1. ans becomes 3+0+1=4. But according to the correct answer, this should be 5. So where is the discrepancy? Ah, because the substring of length 3 (001) is also valid. According to this approach, for i=2, current is 2, so adding 1 (current-1). But the valid substrings ending at i=2 are:\n\npositions 1-2 (01) and 0-2 (001). So two substrings. So the current approach is undercounting. So the current approach's logic is flawed. Ah, I see. The current approach would count for i=2, current=2, so current-1=1, but there are two valid substrings ending at i=2: length 2 (0-1 and 1-2). Wait no, in the case of \"001\", when i=2 (which is the third character in 0-based or 1-based? Let's clarify. Assuming 0-based indices:\n\ns[0] = '0'\n\ns[1] = '0'\n\ns[2] = '1'\n\nAt i=1: s[1] == s[0], so current is reset to 1. valid substrings ending here: 0. At i=2: s[2] != s[1], so current becomes 2. valid substrings ending here are:\n\npositions 1-2 (0,1) \u2192 length 2.\n\npositions 0-2 (0,0,1) \u2192 length 3. But according to the current approach's logic, the valid substrings ending at i=2 would be current-1 = 1. So it's missing one. So this suggests that the approach is incorrect. Ah, I see the mistake. The current approach is only considering the consecutive transitions.",

Looking back at the code:\n\nans is initialized to n (the number of single-character substrings, all valid). Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nif some condition, add i to ans. The code is written in a way that for each i, if the condition is met, ans +=i. But why would you add i to ans for each i? Wait, perhaps the code is considering the substrings of length i+1. For example, for i=1 (assuming 0-based), the possible substrings of length 2. For each of those, if valid, add 1 (i=1) to ans. But that doesn't make sense.

So this code's approach may not be correct unless the problem's valid substrings are exactly those with alternating characters. But according to the problem's examples, a substring like \"001\" is valid. But the code that counts alternating substrings would not count it as valid, since there are consecutive 0s. So the code's current structure seems to be incorrect. But the user's code is supposed to be completed, which implies that the code's structure is correct, and the missing condition is the key.

So the number of valid substrings is the total number of possible substrings minus the number of all-0 and all-1 substrings. Thus, the code's approach is:\n\nans = total_substrings - invalid_substrings. But total_substrings is n*(n+1)/2. The code's initial code initializes ans as n, and then for each i from 1 to n-1, adds i if the condition is met. But this is equivalent to ans = n + sum_{i=1 to n-1} i * (condition ? 1 : 0). Which would give ans = sum_{i=0 to n-1} (i+1) * (condition for i+1). But this is not clear.",

If s[1] != s[0], then ans +=1. So ans =2+1=3, which is correct. In the sample \"001\", the code's loop runs for i=1 and i=2. i=1: s[1] == s[0], so condition is false. ans remains 3.\n\ni=2: s[2] ! = s[1], condition is true. ans +=2 \u2192 ans=5.

Similarly, for the string \"000\", the code's loop runs for i=1 and i=2. i=1: s[1] == s[0], condition false. ans remains 3.\n\ni=2: s[2] == s[1], condition false. ans remains 3.

But how does this approach count all valid substrings? For example, in the string \"001\", which is \"0\", \"0\", \"1\". At i=1 (second 0), since s[1] == s[0], no addition.

But in this case, for each i, the number of valid substrings ending at i is i's current position in the current run of transitions. But I'm not sure. However, the empirical testing shows that this approach gives the correct answer for the samples. Thus, the missing condition in the code is s.charAt(i) ! = s.charAt(i-1). So the code should fill in: if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)) ans +=i; So the code's loop becomes:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <n; i++) {\n\n   if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)) ans +=i;\n\n}\n\nThis way, for each i, if the current character differs from the previous, we add i to ans. But wait, in the code's current loop, i starts from 1 to n-1 (assuming that the string has 0-based indices). For example, in a string of length 3 (n=3), the loop runs for i=1 and i=2. But for the third character (index 2 in 0-based), if it's different from the previous (index 1), then add 2 to ans. In the example \"001\" (0-based indices 0,1,2): At i=1 (index 1), s[1] is 0 == s[0], so no addition. At i=2 (index 2), s[2] is 1 != s[1], so add 2. ans becomes 3+2=5.\n\nWhich is correct. Another example: \"01\" (0-based indices 0 and 1). i=1: s[1] != s[0], add 1. ans=2+1=3. Which is correct. Another example: \"010\" (indices 0,1,2). i=1: s[1] != s[0], add 1. i=2: s[2] != s[1], add 2. ans=3+1+2=6. Which is correct. So this approach works. Thus, the missing condition in the code is to check whether the current character differs from the previous one. The code should use:\n\ns.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1) But note that in Java, String indices are 0-based. So in the code, the loop is from i=1 to n-1 (assuming that the string's length is n). So for i=1 in the loop, the code is checking characters i and i-1 in the string. Thus, the correct condition is:\n\ns.charAt(i) ! = s.charAt(i-1) But in the code provided, the loop is written as for(int i=1; i <n; i++). So the correct code for the condition is:\n\nif (s.charAt(i) ! = s.charAt(i-1)) ans +=i;\n\nThus, the missing code is the condition s.charAt(i) ! = s.charAt(i-1). So the code would be:\n\nif (s.charAt(i) ! = s.charAt(i-1)) ans +=i;\n\nBut in Java, string indices start at 0. So for the code's current setup, s is a String variable, and the loop runs from i=1 to i <n (exclusive), which is correct. Thus, the code's missing condition is:\n\ns.charAt(i) ! = s.charAt(i-1)",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to find the number of pairs (l, r) such that the substring S[l...r] is paranoid. Let's understand what a paranoid string is.\n\nThe problem says a binary string is paranoid if after performing m-1 operations (replacing \"01\" with \"1\" or \"10\" with \"0\"), we can reduce it to a single character. So, the key is to find all substrings that can be reduced down to a single character through these operations.\n\nWait, but how do these operations work? Let's think. Each operation reduces the string length by 1. So, after m-1 steps, we end up with one character. The allowed operations are replacing \"01\" with \"1\" (so turns into '1') or \"10\" with '0'.\n\nHmm. So, what's the pattern here? Let's see examples.\n\nIn the first sample, the string is of length 1, so it's automatically valid.\n\nIn the second sample, S is \"01\". The substring is allowed. Applying the first operation once (01 \u2192 1) gives a length 1, so valid.\n\nAnother example: the third sample's explanation says that the substring \"10\" is not allowed. Wait, no, in the third sample, the substring S2S3 is \"00\", which can't be operated. So that's invalid. But according to the problem statement, the substring needs to be reducible via the allowed operations.\n\nSo, the question is: which substrings can be reduced via these operations to a single character?\n\nLet me think of the possible patterns. Let's consider that each operation reduces the string. The order of operations might matter, but perhaps there's a way to model the reducibility based on the initial and final characters.\n\nWait, maybe the crucial observation is that the entire substring can be reduced to a single character if and only if all the characters are the same, or there's a way to alternate between 0s and 1s in a way that allows merging.\n\nWait, but how? Let's see:\n\nFor example, \"0101\". Let's try to reduce it.\n\nFirst, maybe replace \"01\" with \"1\": so \"0101\" \u2192 \"1\" (replace first two characters 0 and 1). Wait no, the substring is \"01\", replace with 1. Then the string becomes \"101\". Then replace \"10\" with 0 \u2192 \"01\". Then replace \"01\" with 1. So overall, it's reducible. So the substring \"0101\" would be valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of the positions matters. Like, if the substring alternates between 0 and 1, but the starting and ending are the same. Wait, maybe the key is that the substring cannot have two consecutive same characters. Because if there are consecutive same characters, maybe that leads to being able to merge in a way that allows reduction.\n\nAlternatively, let's think recursively. For a substring to be reducible, after all possible operations, it must end up as a single character. Let's see for small lengths:\n\nLength 1: always valid.\n\nLength 2: valid only if the two characters are different. Because then, either \"01\" becomes 1, or \"10\" becomes 0. So any pair of different characters is valid.\n\nLength 3: for example, \"010\". Let's see:\n\nFirst, replace \"01\" (positions 1-2) \u2192 becomes \"10\", then replace \"10\" \u2192 0. So total steps 2, which is 3-1 steps. So valid.\n\nAnother example: \"001\". The substring is 0,0,1. The first two 0s can't be replaced. So we can look for \"01\" in the substring. The last two characters are 0 and 1 \u2192 replace with 1. So now the string is \"01\". Then replace with 1. So total steps 2. So valid.\n\nWait, so the original example given in the problem statement is T=001, which after replacing the last two characters (0 and 1) becomes 01, then replace that to 1. So it's valid. So 001 is a valid substring.\n\nSo even with consecutive same characters, it's possible. So what's the pattern here?\n\nMaybe the key is that the entire substring can be reduced to a single character if and only if the first and last characters are the same. Because each operation reduces the string but preserves the parity in some way. Wait, perhaps not. Let's see:\n\nTake \"010\": starts with 0, ends with 0. Reduced to 0. That's the same.\n\nTake \"0110\": starts with 0, ends with 0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string 0 1 1 0. Let's see:\n\nFirst, look for \"10\" or \"01\" substrings. The first two are 0 and 1 \u2192 \"01\", replace with 1 \u2192 \"110\". Then replace \"11\"? No. Wait, but the allowed operations are replacing \"01\" with 1, \"10\" with 0. So in \"110\", the first two are \"11\" \u2192 no operation. So stuck. So this substring is not valid. So even though the first and last are 0, it's not valid. So my previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So the problem is more complex than just checking the first and last characters.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps each operation can be thought of as merging two characters into one. Each operation reduces the string length by 1, and each operation's choice affects the remaining characters.\n\nAnother idea: the final character after all operations depends on the original string's first and last characters. Because each merge step can be thought of as replacing two adjacent differing characters with one of them. For example, \"01\" becomes 1, so the merged result is the second character. Similarly, \"10\" becomes 0, the first character.\n\nSo, perhaps the entire process can be considered as a series of merges where each merge takes two differing adjacent characters and replaces them with one of them (depending on which pair is merged). The key insight is that the final character can only be the first or last character of the original string. Because each merge operation either preserves the first character of the pair or the second. Wait, no: for example, if you have \"01\", replacing it with 1 (second character). So merging from left to right, the final character depends on the order of merges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character can be either the first or the last character of the original string. For example, take \"0101\". Let's see:\n\nOption 1: merge the first two (0 and 1) into 1 \u2192 \"101\". Then merge the first two (1 and 0) into 0 \u2192 \"01\". Then merge into 1. So final character is 1, which is the last of the original string.\n\nOption 2: merge the last two (0 and 1) first. So original \"0101\" \u2192 \"010\" (merge last two into 1? Wait no. Original string is 0,1,0,1. If we merge the third and fourth characters (0 and 1) into 1, the string becomes \"011\". Then merge the second and third characters (1 and 1) \u2192 no. So that's stuck. So that approach isn't possible.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother observation: the parity of the number of transitions between 0 and 1 in the substring may matter. For example, a substring with even number of transitions might be reducible to the first character, while odd transitions to the opposite. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal way to check whether a substring is paranoid is to note that all consecutive characters must alternate, except possibly for the ends. Wait, no. For example, \"001\" is a valid substring as per the problem's example. Let's see: 0,0,1. So consecutive 0s. But according to the example, it's possible to reduce it.\n\nWait, how? Let's see the steps:\n\nOriginal string: 001.\n\nFirst, find a \"01\" substring. The last two characters are 0 and 1. Replace them with 1 \u2192 becomes 01. Then replace that with 1. So total steps 2. So yes, valid.\n\nSo even with consecutive same characters, the substring can be valid. So the key is not that the entire substring has to alternate.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the substring is valid if and only if all the transitions between 0 and 1 can be merged in a way that allows a single character.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the process. Each time we can choose a substring of \"01\" or \"10\" and replace it with the appropriate character. The order of operations may affect the possibility, but perhaps for the substring to be reducible, the first and last characters must be the same.\n\nWait, in the example \"001\" (0,0,1) \u2192 after merging last two (0 and 1) \u2192 0,1 \u2192 then merged to 1. The first character is 0, last is 1. Wait, but the final result is 1. So the first and last characters of the original substring are 0 and 1. So the final result is 1, which is the last character. So this example contradicts the idea that first and last must be same.\n\nBut the substring \"001\" is valid. So perhaps the first and last characters don't need to be the same.\n\nAnother example: \"01\" \u2192 reduces to 1. First is 0, last is 1. So valid. So the first and last can differ.\n\nHmm. So that's not a valid condition.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the entire substring can be reduced if and only if all the transitions between characters (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) can be collapsed in such a way that there's a path to a single character. But how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased. Let's think that during the merging process, the order of merges doesn't affect whether the substring is reducible, but only the counts of transitions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal condition is that the substring does not contain three consecutive same characters. Because if there are three consecutive same characters, merging might not be possible. Wait, but in the example \"001\", there are two 0s followed by 1. But merging the last two (0 and 1) gives 1, then merging with the first 0 gives 1 again. So even with two same consecutive characters, it's possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that any two consecutive same characters in the substring can be handled by merging adjacent differing pairs first, which might eliminate the same characters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all substrings are valid except those that have even length and start and end with the same character, but that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: n=1 \u2192 answer is 1.\n\nSecond sample: S=01 \u2192 all possible substrings are valid. The possible pairs are (1,1), (2,2), (1,2). So total 3. But the sample says the answer is 3, which matches.\n\nThird sample: S=000. The possible substrings are:\n\nAll single characters (3).\n\nSubstrings of length 2: 00 (invalid, can't perform any operations). So there are 3 such substrings (1-2, 2-3, 1-3). Wait, no, 1-2 is 00, 2-3 is 00, 1-3 is 000. Wait, for substring 1-3 (000), length 3. Let's see:\n\nCan we reduce it? Let's try. The substring is 0,0,0. Are there any \"01\" or \"10\" substrings? No. So we can't perform any operations. So length 3, need 2 operations but can't. So this substring is invalid. So in this case, the valid substrings are all single characters (3), plus any two-character substrings (all 00, invalid), and the three-character substring (invalid). So answer is 3.\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the third sample's answer is 5. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nIn the third sample's note: all substrings are paranoid except [S2S3] (00) and the entire string (000). So S is 000. So the valid substrings are the three single characters (3), and the substrings of length 2: (1-2) 00 (invalid), (2-3) 00 (invalid), and (1-3) 000 (invalid). So total valid is 3. But according to the note, the answer is 5. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the note.\n\nWait, the third sample's note says: all substrings of S are paranoid except [S2S3] (00) and [S1S2S3]. So the total valid is 3 (single characters) + 2 (other valid substrings). So how? Let's see:\n\nWait, the substring S1S2 (00) is invalid. S2S3 (00) invalid. So the two-character substrings are invalid. But the note says that all are except two. So perhaps the third sample is a different input. Let me recheck the problem's note.\n\nThe note says: in the third sample, all substrings are paranoid except [S2S3] (because no operations can be performed), and [S1S2S3] (the entire string). So the other substrings are (each single character, which is 3), and the other possible substrings of length 2: S1S2 (00, invalid), S1S3 (0 and 0, but wait, the substring from 1 to 3 is the entire string, which is 000. So the substrings are:\n\nLength 1: 3.\n\nLength 2: (1-2) 00 (invalid), (2-3) 00 (invalid).\n\nLength 3: 000 (invalid).\n\nSo total valid is 3. But the note says that the answer is 5. Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the third sample is different. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, perhaps the third sample's input is not 000. Let me recheck the note:\n\n\"In the third sample, all substrings of S are paranoid except [S2S3], because we can't perform any operations on it, and [S1S2S3] (the entire string).\"\n\nWait, but that implies that the other substrings of length 2 (like S1S2 and S1S3?) are valid. But how?\n\nAh, perhaps the third sample's input is not 000. Let's think: for example, if the input is \"010\", then the possible substrings are:\n\nLength 1: 3.\n\nLength 2: 0-1 (0 and 1) \u2192 valid. 1-2 (1 and 0) \u2192 valid. 2-3 (0 and 0) \u2192 invalid.\n\nLength 3: 010 \u2192 valid. So total valid is 3 (length 1) + 2 (length 2) + 1 (length3) = 6. But according to the note, the answer is 5, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third sample's input is \"001\", as in the first example given in the problem description. Let's see:\n\nThe problem's first example is T=001. So the sample input S is 001. The substrings are:\n\nSingle characters: 3.\n\nLength 2: 0-0 (invalid), 0-1 (valid), 0-1 (valid). Wait, the substrings of length 2 would be [0,0], [0,1], and [0,1] (for positions 1-2, 2-3, 1-3 is length 3). Wait, no. The substring of length 2 for 001 is:\n\npositions 1-2: \"00\" \u2192 invalid.\n\npositions 2-3: \"01\" \u2192 valid.\n\npositions 1-3 is the entire string of length 3.\n\nSo the valid substrings of length 2 are one. So for the entire string, the answer would be 3 (single) +1 (length 2) +1 (length 3) =5, which matches the note's statement. So the third sample's input is \"001\" perhaps.\n\nSo the note says that in the third sample, all substrings are valid except [S2S3] (which is \"01\"? No, because that is valid). Wait, this is getting confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the actual problem is that in the third sample, the substring S2S3 is \"01\", which according to the note is invalid. But that's impossible, because \"01\" can be reduced. So maybe the note is a typo, but regardless, I need to find a way to model the solution.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's look for a pattern in valid substrings.\n\nObservation: For a substring to be paranoid, the entire process must reduce it to one character. But each operation replaces a \"01\" or \"10\" with a single character. So, any substring that contains at least one occurrence of \"01\" or \"10\" can be reduced.\n\nWait, but if the substring is all 0s or all 1s, like \"000\", then there are no \"01\" or \"10\" pairs. So such substrings cannot be reduced if their length is >=2. So for a substring of length m >=2, if all characters are the same, then it's invalid. Because you can't perform any operation.\n\nSo, for any substring of length >=2, it is valid if and only if it contains at least one occurrence of \"01\" or \"10\". Because then you can perform at least one operation, and after m-1 steps, you can reduce it.\n\nWait, but what about a substring like \"010\"? It has \"01\" and \"10\". So it can be reduced.\n\nWait, but the process requires performing m-1 operations, which for a substring of length 3, you need 2 operations. Let's see for \"010\":\n\nStep 1: replace \"01\" (positions 1-2) with 1 \u2192 becomes \"10\".\n\nStep 2: replace \"10\" \u2192 0. So done. So valid.\n\nBut what about a substring of \"0110\"? Let's see:\n\nOriginal substring: 0,1,1,0. Length 4. Need 3 operations.\n\nFirst, check for any \"01\" or \"10\" pairs. The first two are 0 and1 \u2192 replace with 1 \u2192 \"1,1,0\". Now, no \"01\" or \"10\" pairs except the last two (1 and 0). Replace with 0 \u2192 \"1,0\". Replace \"10\" \u2192 0. So done. So it's valid. So this substring is valid.\n\nSo according to this, any substring that has at least one occurrence of \"01\" or \"10\" is valid.\n\nSo the condition for a substring of length >=2 is that it contains at least one \"01\" or \"10\" pair. But wait, the substring \"0001\" (three 0s and a 1) has \"01\" in positions 3-4. So it's valid.\n\nSo the key is that if the substring has at least one transition between 0 and 1, then it is valid. Otherwise, if it's all 0s or all 1s, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the number of valid pairs is equal to the total possible pairs (n*(n+1)/2) minus the number of pairs where the substring is all 0s or all 1s.\n\nWait, this is a crucial insight. Because:\n\nFor a substring to be invalid, it must consist of all 0s or all 1s. Because if there's any transition between 0 and 1, then there's at least one \"01\" or \"10\" pair, allowing for the first operation. Then, after that, the new string will have at least one transition again (since the operation reduces the length but may introduce new transitions). Wait, but after the first operation, the substring becomes shorter. But how can we be sure that each subsequent step can be performed?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial idea is correct. For example, any substring that has at least one transition is valid, and the only invalid substrings are those with no transitions (all 0s or all 1s).\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all possible pairs (l, r) and subtracting the number of contiguous all-0 or all-1 substrings.\n\nSo the solution would be:\n\nTotal pairs = n*(n+1)/2\n\nSubtract the number of all-0 contiguous substrings and all-1 contiguous substrings.\n\nFor example, for the third sample input where S is \"001\", the invalid substrings are:\n\nFor all 0s: the substring [0,0] (positions 1-2), and any single 0s? No, because single characters are valid. So the all-0 contiguous substrings of length >=2 are:\n\n- positions 1-2: length 2.\n\nAll-1 contiguous substrings: none except the single character.\n\nSo the number of invalid substrings is 1 (all-0 of length 2) and 0 (all-1 of length >=2). So total invalid is 1. So the answer would be 3*(3+1)/2 - 1 = 6 -1=5, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: the third sample in the problem's note has S=000. The invalid substrings are all contiguous 0s of length >=2. The number of such substrings is (3-1)*3/2 - 3 + ... Wait, how to compute the number of contiguous all-0 substrings.\n\nWait, the standard way to count the number of contiguous all-0 (or all-1) substrings is to split the string into runs of 0s and 1s. For each run of length k, the number of contiguous substrings is k*(k+1)/2. But the invalid substrings are those of length >=2, so for each run of length k, the invalid substrings are k*(k+1)/2 -k (since subtracting the single-length substrings). So the total invalid is sum over all runs of 0s and 1s of (k*(k-1)/2).\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nanswer = total_pairs - sum_{k in runs} (k * (k-1) ) / 2\n\nWhere runs are all the consecutive sequences of 0s and 1s in the string.\n\nYes! Because for a run of length k, there are k*(k+1)/2 possible substrings (from length 1 to k). But the invalid substrings are those of length >=2, which is k*(k+1)/2 - k (subtract the 1-length substrings) = k*(k-1)/2.\n\nSo the solution is to compute for each test case:\n\nans = n*(n+1)/2 - sum (k*(k-1)/2 for each run of 0s or 1s)\n\nSo for example, the third sample's input is \"001\", which has runs:\n\n00 (length 2) \u2192 contributes 2*1/2=1.\n\n1 (length 1) \u2192 contributes 0.\n\nSo sum is 1. So ans = 3*4/2 -1 =6-1=5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: the third sample in the problem's note is S=000. The runs are 3 consecutive 0s. So sum is 3*2/2=3. ans=3*4/2 -3=6-3=3. Which matches the sample note.\n\nAnother example: S=01. Runs are 0 (1), 1 (1). sum is 0. ans=2*3/2=3, which matches sample 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the total number of substrings (n*(n+1)/2) and subtract the number of invalid substrings (contiguous runs of 0s or 1s of length >=2, calculated as sum (k*(k-1)/2 for each run of length k)).\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read the string S.\n\n2. Split S into runs of consecutive 0s and 1s.\n\n3. For each run length k, compute k*(k-1)/2 and sum them all.\n\n4. The answer is (n*(n+1)/2) - sum.\n\nSo now, the code in Java needs to implement this.\n\nLooking at the code provided:\n\nThe initial code reads t test cases. For each test case:\n\nn is read.\n\ns is read.\n\nans is initialized as n (sum of all single-character substrings).\n\nThen, there's a loop for i from 1 to n-1. For each i, if some condition, add i to ans.\n\nWait, but according to the correct approach, the total pairs are n*(n+1)/2. The code currently starts ans as n, then for i from 1 to n-1, adds i if some condition, which would make ans = n + sum over i where condition is true. But that's not how the total pairs are calculated. So there's a mistake in the initial code's approach.\n\nWait, the initial code's approach seems to be adding to ans the number of valid substrings. But according to the code provided:\n\nlong ans =n;\n\nfor(int i=1;i<n;i++){\n\n    if(/* TODO */) ans +=i;\n\n}\n\nBut this code seems to compute ans as n + sum over i=1 to n-1 of i if condition is met. Which for n=3 would be n=3, then i=1 and 2.\n\nBut for example, if the condition is always true, then ans would be 3 +1 +2=6. Which is 3*4/2=6. So perhaps the code is trying to compute the total number of valid substrings (including all possible pairs) and subtract the invalid ones. But the initial code's approach is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the answer using a different approach, and the missing condition is to count the valid substrings. But the initial code's approach is not aligned with the correct approach.\n\nBut according to the problem, the code provided is incomplete, and the missing part is to fill in the condition in the if statement. So the code is using a different approach than the one we derived. Let's see.\n\nThe code initializes ans as n, which is the count of single-character substrings (all valid). Then, for each i from 1 to n-1 (i is the possible length of the substring minus 1?), but perhaps i is being used in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, the code is considering substrings of length l. For example, for substrings of length l, the number of possible substrings is n - l +1. For each possible substring of length l >=2, check if it's valid and add to ans.\n\nBut the code loops for i from 1 to n-1. So for each i, perhaps it's considering the substrings of length i+1? For example, when i=1, it's substrings of length 2. Then, for each such substring, if it's valid, add 1 (the number of possible substrings). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the number of valid substrings that end at position i+1. Or perhaps it's using some dynamic programming approach.\n\nBut given the code's current structure, it's not obvious. So perhaps the correct approach is to find for each possible ending position, the maximum possible starting position such that the substring is valid. Then, for each position, accumulate the number of valid substrings ending there.\n\nBut this seems like it could be O(n) per test case.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach could be to iterate through the string and for each position i (starting from 0), track the current run of valid transitions. For example, if the current character is different from the previous one, then the number of valid substrings ending here is increased by the current run length. But this is similar to the approach used for counting the number of substrings with alternating characters.\n\nAh! Because the problem's valid substrings are those that have at least one transition (so they are not all 0s or all 1s), but this is exactly the same as the number of substrings that are not made of all 0s or all 1s.\n\nSo, the code may be using an approach where for each position i, we track the length of the current alternating run. For example, if the current character is different from the previous, the current run increases by 1, else it resets to 1. Then, for each position, the number of valid substrings ending here is the current run length minus 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example:\n\nFor the string \"001\", the valid substrings are all except [1-2] (00). So the valid substrings are:\n\nAll single characters (3).\n\nSubstrings of length 2: [2-3] (01), which is valid.\n\nSubstrings of length 3: [1-3] (001), which is valid (as per the problem's example).\n\nSo according to the correct approach, the answer should be 5. But according to the code's initial code:\n\nans is initialized as 3 (n=3). Then, for i from 1 to 2 (i=1 and 2). For each i, if condition is true, add i to ans.\n\nFor i=1: if condition is true, ans +=1 \u2192 ans=4.\n\nFor i=2: if condition is true, ans +=2 \u2192 ans=6. But the correct answer is 5.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the code's approach is different. So perhaps the code is trying to count the valid substrings in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is:\n\nFor each possible substring (l, r), where r = l + i, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach could be similar to the following:\n\nEach valid substring can be uniquely determined by the pairs where the current character is different from the previous. For example, for each position i (starting from 1), if S[i] != S[i-1], then there is a new valid substring starting at i-1 and ending at i, and extending to include previous positions where transitions occurred.\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be using the approach of counting the number of valid substrings that end at position i (0-based or 1-based). For example, if the current character is different from the previous, then the number of valid substrings ending here is previous count plus 1. Otherwise, reset to 0.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nFor example, in the string \"001\":\n\nIndices (0-based):\n\n0: '0'\n\n1: '0'\n\n2: '1'\n\nAt i=0: no previous, so no substrings of length >=2.\n\nAt i=1: S[1] == S[0], so no new valid substrings. So the count is 0.\n\nAt i=2: S[2] != S[1], so the number of valid substrings ending here is (i-1) - last position where a transition occurred.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, we can track the length of the current valid run. For example, when a transition occurs (S[i] != S[i-1]), the current run increases. The number of valid substrings ending at i is equal to the current run's length.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn \"001\":\n\ni=0: run =1.\n\ni=1: S[i] == S[i-1], so run=1 (reset to 1, since no transition).\n\ni=2: S[i] != S[i-1], so run becomes 2. The number of valid substrings ending here is 2 (length 2: \"01\", and length 3: \"001\").\n\nSo the code could be adding the current run length minus 1 for each i.\n\nSo in this case, for each i >=1, if S[i] != S[i-1], then the current run increases by 1. Otherwise, the run is reset to 1. Then, for each i, the code adds (current run -1) to ans.\n\nIn the example:\n\nFor \"001\", the runs are:\n\ni=0: run=1, but since i=0 (starting index?), perhaps not considered.\n\nThen, for i=1: same as previous, run=1. current run-1 is 0 \u2192 added 0.\n\nFor i=2: different from previous, run=2. current run-1 is 1 \u2192 added 1.\n\nSo the total ans would be 3 (initial) +0 +1=4. Which is incorrect. But the correct answer is 5.\n\nHmm. So perhaps this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is counting the number of valid substrings as follows:\n\nThe initial ans is n (for all single-character substrings). Then, for each possible length l >=2, the code adds the number of valid substrings of length l. But in the code's current structure, the loop is for i from 1 to n-1. So for each i (which could represent l-1), the code is adding i if some condition. But how does i relate to the length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is counting the number of valid substrings ending at position i (0-based) that have length >=2.\n\nFor example, for each position i, the number of valid substrings ending at i and with length >=2 is determined by how many transitions are present in the current run.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code may be using the approach that for each position i in the string, the number of valid substrings that end at i is equal to the number of consecutive transitions in the current run. For example, when you encounter a transition between i-1 and i, you can form a new substrings ending at i with length 2, and also combine with previous transitions to form longer substrings.\n\nThis is similar to the way we count the number of substrings with all unique characters.\n\nFor example, for a run of transitions like 0,1,0,1, each new transition increases the number of valid substrings ending at that position by the length of the current alternating run.\n\nIn this case, the code could be maintaining a variable that tracks the current length of the alternating sequence. For each i starting from 1:\n\nif s[i] != s[i-1], then current +=1, else current =1.\n\nthen, the number of valid substrings ending at i is current-1. Because, for example, if current is 3, then there are 3-1=2 new substrings: length 2,3.\n\nWait, perhaps the current variable represents the length of the longest valid substring ending at i. Then, each time there's a transition, current increases by 1. The number of valid substrings ending at i is current-1.\n\nSo for example:\n\nString \"01\":\n\ni=1: s[1] != s[0]. current=2. valid substrings ending at 1:1 (length 2).\n\nSo adding 1 to ans (which was initialized to 2). ans becomes 3, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: \"001\".\n\ni=1: s[1] == s[0]. current=1. valid substrings: 0.\n\ni=2: s[2] != s[1]. current=2. valid substrings:1. ans becomes 3+0+1=4.\n\nBut according to the correct answer, this should be 5. So where is the discrepancy?\n\nAh, because the substring of length 3 (001) is also valid. According to this approach, for i=2, current is 2, so adding 1 (current-1). But the valid substrings ending at i=2 are:\n\npositions 1-2 (01) and 0-2 (001). So two substrings. So the current approach is undercounting.\n\nSo the current approach's logic is flawed.\n\nAh, I see. The current approach would count for i=2, current=2, so current-1=1, but there are two valid substrings ending at i=2: length 2 (0-1 and 1-2). Wait no, in the case of \"001\", when i=2 (which is the third character in 0-based or 1-based? Let's clarify.\n\nAssuming 0-based indices:\n\ns[0] = '0'\n\ns[1] = '0'\n\ns[2] = '1'\n\nAt i=1: s[1] == s[0], so current is reset to 1. valid substrings ending here: 0.\n\nAt i=2: s[2] != s[1], so current becomes 2. valid substrings ending here are:\n\npositions 1-2 (0,1) \u2192 length 2.\n\npositions 0-2 (0,0,1) \u2192 length 3.\n\nBut according to the current approach's logic, the valid substrings ending at i=2 would be current-1 = 1. So it's missing one.\n\nSo this suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. The current approach is only considering the consecutive transitions. For example, when a transition occurs, it adds the current run's length -1. But in the case of a longer run like 0,0,1, the transition between 0 and 1 allows two substrings (positions 1-2 and 0-2), but the current approach only counts one.\n\nSo the problem is that the current approach is not considering the possibility of longer substrings that have transitions earlier.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach (counting the number of all substrings minus the number of invalid ones) is the correct way to proceed. So the code provided in the problem is incorrect, and the missing condition is not based on the current approach.\n\nThus, the code should be modified to compute the correct answer using the sum of valid substrings as total_pairs minus the number of invalid substrings.\n\nBut the code provided in the problem is structured differently, and the user is to fill in the missing condition. So perhaps the code is using the approach of counting the number of valid substrings by checking if the current character is different from the previous one, and accumulating the count based on that.\n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nans is initialized to n (the number of single-character substrings, all valid).\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nif some condition, add i to ans.\n\nThe code is written in a way that for each i, if the condition is met, ans +=i.\n\nBut why would you add i to ans for each i?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is considering the substrings of length i+1. For example, for i=1 (assuming 0-based), the possible substrings of length 2. For each of those, if valid, add 1 (i=1) to ans. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different approach. For example, for each position i (1-based?), if the current character is different from the previous, then the number of valid substrings ending at i is i.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to accumulate the number of valid substrings by adding the length of the current valid run.\n\nFor example, when a transition is found at position i, the number of valid substrings ending at i is the current run length. The code is initializing ans as n, then adding for each i the current run length.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is inspired by the following formula:\n\nThe number of valid substrings is the sum for each i from 1 to n-1 of the number of valid substrings ending at i.\n\nWhich can be computed as follows:\n\ncurrent =0;\n\nans =n;\n\nfor i from 1 to n-1:\n\n    if s[i] != s[i-1], current +=1;\n\n    else current=0;\n\n    ans += current;\n\nThus, for each transition between i-1 and i, current increases by 1. For each consecutive transition, current increases. This is the standard approach for counting the number of substrings with alternating characters.\n\nBut this approach counts the number of valid substrings where the substring has alternating characters. For example, \"010\" would have three valid substrings of length 2 and 3. But according to the problem's rules, any substring with at least one transition is valid, not just those with alternating characters.\n\nSo this approach would undercount.\n\nBut according to the problem's examples, the approach of counting all substrings with at least one transition is correct. So this code's approach may not be correct unless the problem's valid substrings are exactly those with alternating characters.\n\nBut according to the problem's examples, a substring like \"001\" is valid. But the code that counts alternating substrings would not count it as valid, since there are consecutive 0s. So the code's current structure seems to be incorrect.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to be completed, which implies that the code's structure is correct, and the missing condition is the key.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is to count the number of valid substrings where the substring has at least one transition. But how to model that.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the following observation: any valid substring must contain at least one transition. So the number of valid substrings is the total number of possible substrings minus the number of all-0 and all-1 substrings.\n\nThus, the code's approach is:\n\nans = total_substrings - invalid_substrings.\n\nBut total_substrings is n*(n+1)/2. The code's initial code initializes ans as n, and then for each i from 1 to n-1, adds i if the condition is met. But this is equivalent to ans = n + sum_{i=1 to n-1} i * (condition ? 1 : 0). Which would give ans = sum_{i=0 to n-1} (i+1) * (condition for i+1). But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written to compute the number of valid substrings by adding, for each i, the number of valid substrings of length i+1. For example, for i=0, the substrings are of length 1 (n of them). For i=1, substrings of length 2, and so on.\n\nBut the code's current structure is:\n\nans =n;\n\nfor (i=1; i <n; i++) {\n\n   if (condition) ans +=i;\n\n}\n\nSo for each i from 1 to n-1, the code adds i to ans if the condition is met.\n\nThe total would be ans =n + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (i if condition else 0).\n\nBut the sum of i from 1 to n-1 is (n-1)*n/2. So the total possible substrings of length >=2 is (n-1)*n/2. The code is adding some of those i's, which could represent the number of valid substrings of length i+1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is written to track the number of valid substrings for each possible length. For example, the maximum possible valid substrings for a string of length m is m-1 (if all possible transitions are present). But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the code's missing condition is checking whether the current character is different from the previous one. This is because for each i, if s[i] != s[i-1], then there are i valid substrings ending at i.\n\nWait, let's see. For example, in the string \"01\", the code's loop runs for i=1 (n=2). If s[1] != s[0], then ans +=1. So ans =2+1=3, which is correct.\n\nIn the sample \"001\", the code's loop runs for i=1 and i=2.\n\ni=1: s[1] == s[0], so condition is false. ans remains 3.\n\ni=2: s[2] != s[1], condition is true. ans +=2 \u2192 ans=5.\n\nWhich matches the correct answer.\n\nSimilarly, for the string \"000\", the code's loop runs for i=1 and i=2.\n\ni=1: s[1] == s[0], condition false. ans remains 3.\n\ni=2: s[2] == s[1], condition false. ans remains 3. So total ans=3, which matches the third sample's note.\n\nAnother example: \"010\".\n\ni=1: s[1] != s[0] \u2192 ans +=1 \u2192 4.\n\ni=2: s[2] != s[1] \u2192 ans +=2 \u21926. So ans=6. But according to the problem's rules, the valid substrings are all possible except those with all 0s or 1s. In \"010\", all substrings have at least one transition. So total_substrings is 3*4/2=6. Which would be correct. So yes, ans=6.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nThus, the code's condition is checking whether s[i] != s[i-1], and if so, adds i to ans. This approach is correct.\n\nBecause, in this approach, the code is adding for each position i (from 1 to n-1), the value i if the current character differs from the previous. This is equivalent to accumulating the number of valid substrings ending at i.\n\nThe reasoning is that when s[i] != s[i-1], then there are i valid substrings ending at i. But this seems to work.\n\nBut how does this approach count all valid substrings?\n\nFor example, in the string \"001\", which is \"0\", \"0\", \"1\".\n\nAt i=1 (second 0), since s[1] == s[0], no addition. At i=2 (third character, 1), s[2] != s[1], so add 2 to ans. So ans=3+2=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThe underlying idea here is that for each position i, the number of valid substrings ending at i is equal to the current number of transitions. For example, every time a transition occurs between i-1 and i, it creates i new valid substrings. But why i?\n\nPerhaps the code is using the following logic: when a transition occurs between i and i-1, it can form a valid substring of length 2. Additionally, each previous transition before i-1 allows forming longer valid substrings.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is based on the observation that the number of valid substrings ending at position i is equal to the number of positions j <= i such that the substring j..i is valid.\n\nBut in this case, for each i, the number of valid substrings ending at i is i's current position in the current run of transitions.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, the empirical testing shows that this approach gives the correct answer for the samples.\n\nThus, the missing condition in the code is s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1).\n\nSo the code should fill in:\n\nif (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)) ans +=i;\n\nSo the code's loop becomes:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <n; i++) {\n\n   if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)) ans +=i;\n\n}\n\nThis way, for each i, if the current character differs from the previous, we add i to ans.\n\nBut wait, in the code's current loop, i starts from 1 to n-1 (assuming that the string has 0-based indices). For example, in a string of length 3 (n=3), the loop runs for i=1 and i=2.\n\nBut for the third character (index 2 in 0-based), if it's different from the previous (index 1), then add 2 to ans.\n\nIn the example \"001\" (0-based indices 0,1,2):\n\nAt i=1 (index 1), s[1] is 0 == s[0], so no addition.\n\nAt i=2 (index 2), s[2] is 1 != s[1], so add 2. ans becomes 3+2=5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: \"01\" (0-based indices 0 and 1). i=1: s[1] != s[0], add 1. ans=2+1=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: \"010\" (indices 0,1,2). i=1: s[1] != s[0], add 1. i=2: s[2] != s[1], add 2. ans=3+1+2=6. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nThus, the missing condition in the code is to check whether the current character differs from the previous one. The code should use:\n\ns.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)\n\nBut note that in Java, String indices are 0-based. So in the code, the loop is from i=1 to n-1 (assuming that the string's length is n). So for i=1 in the loop, the code is checking characters i and i-1 in the string.\n\nThus, the correct condition is:\n\ns.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)\n\nBut in the code provided, the loop is written as for(int i=1; i <n; i++). So the correct code for the condition is:\n\nif (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)) ans +=i;\n\nThus, the missing code is the condition s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1).\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nif (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)) ans +=i;\n\nBut in Java, string indices start at 0. So for the code's current setup, s is a String variable, and the loop runs from i=1 to i <n (exclusive), which is correct.\n\nThus, the code's missing condition is:\n\ns.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i-1)"
