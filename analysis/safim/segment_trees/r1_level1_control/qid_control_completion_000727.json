The divisions are as follows:\n- Division 1: rating >=1900\n- Division 2: 1600 <= rating <=1899\n- Division 3: 1400 <= rating <=1599\n- Division 4: rating <=1399\n\nLooking at the code, the first condition checks if arr[i] >=1900, so that's division 1. Then the else if checks if it's between 1600 and 1899, division 2. The next else if should handle division 3, which is 1400 up to 1599. So the missing condition here is when the rating is >=1400 and <=1599. So the code for that part would be arr[i] >=1400 && arr[i] <=1599. Wait, the existing else if after the first condition checks for arr[i] >=1600 and <=1899. So any value that is >=1600 would have been caught by that. So the next else if for division 3 should check if the rating is between 1400 and 1599, inclusive. So the condition should be arr[i] >=1400. But since the previous else if checks for 1600 and up, the current else if can just check if the value is >=1400. Because if we reach this else if, the value is not >=1900 (caught by first if), not between 1600-1899 (caught by first else if), so the next condition is whether it's >=1400. Because if it's >=1400 and not >=1600, then it's between 1400-1599. So the condition can be arr[i] >=1400. But wait, maybe the code uses a more explicit check. Let me think. Alternatively, the else if could check if the rating is >=1400 and <=1599. That's more precise. Because the first else if checks for >=1600, which would include up to 1899. So the division 3 is when the rating is between 1400 and 1599. So the correct condition is arr[i] >=1400. Because any value that is >=1400 and not in the previous conditions (which are >=1600) would fall into division 3. Wait, no. Because after the first two conditions, the else if for division 3 would be the next one. So if the first two conditions are not met (so the rating is less than 1600), then checking if it's >=1400 would include 1400-1599, which is exactly division 3. So the condition for division 3 is arr[i] >=1400. But wait, what if the rating is, say, 1599? Then it would be covered by >=1400. Because the previous else if is for 1600 and up. So the code can be written as:\n\nelse if(arr[i] >= 1400) Because if it's 1400 or higher but not >=1600 (since the previous else if would have caught that), then it's division 3. So the missing code in the else if condition is arr[i] >=1400.",
