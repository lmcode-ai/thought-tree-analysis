So the missing condition is for Division 2, which should check if the rating is between 1600 and 1899 inclusive. The elif for Division 2 is currently a #TODO. So the correct condition here would be checking if n is >=1600 and <=1899. But how to write that in Python? Wait, the first condition already checked if n >=1900. So any code that reaches the first elif (the #TODO line) would already have n <1900. So the condition for Division 2 only needs to check if n >=1600. Because if n is >=1600 and since we know it's not >=1900 (because the first condition failed), then it must be in 1600-1899. So the condition can be simplified to n >=1600. So the correct elif condition is n >=1600. Let me check:\n\nIf n is 1600, then after the first if (1900) is false, the elif checks if >=1600, which is true. So it would print Division 2. If n is 1899, same thing. If it's 1599, it skips this elif, then checks the next one (1400-1599). So that's correct. So the missing code for the elif should be 'elif n >= 1600:'. That's the correct condition here. So the line should read:\n\nelif n >=1600: That's all. Let me check the sample test cases mentioned. For example, the sixth test case is 1679. Since 1679 >=1600 and <1900, so it would trigger the elif and print Division 2. Correct. Yes, that's the right condition. So the missing line is 'elif n >= 1600:'.",
