So the maximum possible s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n. So first, calculate the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Then find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= sum. But how to compute that sum efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1e9 and there are up to 1e4 test cases? Let's think about the sum. Let's split it into even and odd i's. For i=1: ceil(1/2) = 1\ni=2: ceil(2/2)=1\ni=3: 2\ni=4: 2\ni=5: 3\ni=6:3, etc. Notice that for even i, ceil(i/2) = i/2. For odd i, ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2. So for each pair of consecutive numbers (odd and even), their sum is ( (k+1)/2 ) + (k+1)/2, where k is the odd number. Wait, let's see: For example, i=1 (odd) and i=2 (even): sum is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ni=3 and 4: 2 + 2 =4.\n\ni=5 and 6: 3 +3=6. So for each pair (odd, even), the sum is ( (i+1)/2 ) * 2, where i is the odd number. But (i+1)/2 for odd i is (k) where i=2k-1. For example, i=1: (1+1)/2=1. So for the pair (1,2), sum is 2*1=2. For pair (3,4), sum is 2*2=4. Pair (5,6) sum is 2*3=6. So each pair contributes 2k for k=1,2,3,... So when n is even, the number of such pairs is n/2. The sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k, where m is the number of pairs. Because for each pair, 2k is added. For example, when n=4 (two pairs), sum is 2 +4 =6. Let's check: 1+1+2+2=6. Yes. If n is even, m = n/2. The sum is 2*(1+2+...+m) = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). If n is even, sum = m(m+1) where m =n/2. If n is odd, then there's an extra term. For example, when n=5: pairs (1,2), (3,4), sum 2+4=6, plus the fifth term ceil(5/2)=3. So sum is 6+3=9. So for odd n=2m+1, the sum is m(m+1) + (m+1). Because the extra term is ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1. So sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Alternatively, sum = ( (n+1)/2 )^2 when n is odd. Because for n=5: (5+1)/2 =3, 3^2=9. Correct. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor n even: sum = m(m+1) where m =n/2. For n odd: sum = (m+1)^2 where m= (n-1)/2. Because (n-1)/2 is m when n=2m+1. But let's see:\n\nn=5: m=(5-1)/2=2. sum is (2+1)^2=9. Correct.\n\nn=3: m=1. sum (1+1)^2=4. Which is 1+1+2=4. Correct. So the sum can be expressed as:\n\nsum = \n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nSo combining both cases, sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n + 1) // 2 ) * ( (n // 2) + 1 ) Wait, let's check for even n:\n\nFor n=4: (4+1)//2 is 2 (since (4+1)/2 is 2.5, floor is 2). n//2 is 2. So 2*(2+1)=6, which is correct. For n=5: (5+1)//2 is 3, n//2 is 2. 3*(2+1) =9, which is correct. Wait, wait. Let's see:\n\nFor even n=2m:\n\nsum = m*(m+1). Which is m*(m+1) = (2m/2) * (2m/2 +1) = m*(m+1). For odd n=2m+1:\n\nsum is (m+1)^2. But (n+1)//2 is (2m+1 +1)/2= (2m+2)/2 = m+1. And (n//2) is (2m+1)/2 = m. So (m+1)*(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Which is correct. So the formula sum = ( (n+1)/2 ) * ( (n//2) + 1 ) holds for both even and odd n. Yes. So for any n, sum = floor((n+1)/2) * ( floor(n/2) + 1 ) So sum is equal to (k) * (m +1), where k is ceil(n/2) and m is floor(n/2). But since for even n: k = m +1? Wait, for even n=2m: k = (2m +1)/2 rounded down, which is m. m +1 is m+1.",

So for each test case, we need to compute s as the integer part of the square root of the total. But how to compute that efficiently. But given that the sum is already a function of n, perhaps we can find a formula for s in terms of n without computing the sum, or find a pattern that allows us to compute s directly from n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to express s in terms of n, avoiding the step of computing the sum and then taking its square root.

So 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6. So s=2. Another example: m=3, sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. So s=3. Yes. So for even n=2m, s is m.\n\nWait, but wait, if sum is m*(m+1), then s\u00b2 <= m(m+1).

Wait, no. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2 =2.5, but integer division in C++ truncates towards zero, so (4+1)/2 is 2.5, but stored as 2 when using integer division. Wait no, in C++, (n+1) is 5, divided by 2 gives 2.5, but integer division would be 2. So (n+1)/2 when n=4 is 5/2=2 in integer division. Wait, in C++, 5/2 is 2. But for even n:\n\nn is even. So n=2m.

Which for even n gives m, and for odd n gives (n+1)/2 which is m+1.\n\nWait, let's see: For even n=4: code outputs (4+1)/2=2 (since 5/2 is 2 in integer division). Which is correct, s=2. For even n=2: code outputs (2+1)/2=1. Correct. For odd n=5: code outputs (5+1)/2=3. Correct. For odd n=3: (3+1)/2=2. Correct.

But according to (6+1)/2=3.5, which in integer division is 3. So code outputs 3. Which is correct. So the code is correct? Wait, but according to our previous analysis:\n\nFor even n=2m, sum is m(m+1), and s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1)) ). For example, when m=3 (n=6), sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. s=3. The code would output (6+1)/2=3.5, but in integer division, it's 3. So code outputs 3. Correct. Wait, but (n+1)/2 for even n is m +0.5, but in integer division, (n+1)/2 would be m if n is even. For example, n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5, but integer division truncates to 3. So the code's output is (n+1)//2, which for even n is (n+1)/2 rounded down. Which is the same as (n/2) + (1)/2, but integer division. But according to our analysis, for even n, the correct s is m =n/2. But according to the code, for even n=6, (6+1)/2=3.5 becomes 3. So code outputs 3, which is correct. So code works. Wait, no. Wait for even n=2m, (n+1)/2 is m + 0.5. Integer division would truncate to m, but (n+1)//2 is m. But m is n/2. So (n+1)//2 is equal to (n/2) when n is even? Let's see:\n\nn=4, even. (4+1)/2 =2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. Which is n/2 (4/2=2). So yes.\n\nn=6 \u2192 6/2=3, (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. So (n+1)/2 in integer division equals n/2 when n is even. So for even n, (n+1)/2 (integer division) equals m =n/2. But for even n, the correct s is floor(sqrt(m*(m+1)) ). Which is m, as discussed earlier. So the code's output for even n is m, which is correct. For odd n=2m+1, code outputs (2m+2)/2 =m+1. Which is correct. So the code is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the maximum possible side length of a square that can be formed using n wooden blocks. Each block is 1 unit high, and the length of the i-th block is ceil(i/2). So for example, the first block has length 1, the second also 1, third 2, fourth 2, fifth 3, and so on.\n\nThe goal is to arrange some of these blocks (without rotating them) to form the largest square possible. The square's area would be side_length squared. Since each block contributes an area equal to its length (since height is 1), the total area of the blocks used must be at least side_length^2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that the sum of the lengths of some subset of the blocks is >= s\u00b2. We need to find the largest s possible.\n\nWait, but the blocks are fixed. Each block's length is determined by its index. So the sum of all the lengths of the first n blocks is the total area available. So the maximum possible s is the largest integer where s\u00b2 <= sum of ceil(i/2) for i=1 to n.\n\nSo first, calculate the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Then find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nBut how to compute that sum efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1e9 and there are up to 1e4 test cases?\n\nLet's think about the sum. Let's split it into even and odd i's.\n\nFor i=1: ceil(1/2) = 1\ni=2: ceil(2/2)=1\ni=3: 2\ni=4: 2\ni=5: 3\ni=6:3, etc.\n\nNotice that for even i, ceil(i/2) = i/2. For odd i, ceil(i/2) = (i+1)/2.\n\nSo for each pair of consecutive numbers (odd and even), their sum is ( (k+1)/2 ) + (k+1)/2, where k is the odd number. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor example, i=1 (odd) and i=2 (even): sum is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ni=3 and 4: 2 + 2 =4.\n\ni=5 and 6: 3 +3=6.\n\nSo for each pair (odd, even), the sum is ( (i+1)/2 ) * 2, where i is the odd number. But (i+1)/2 for odd i is (k) where i=2k-1. For example, i=1: (1+1)/2=1. So for the pair (1,2), sum is 2*1=2. For pair (3,4), sum is 2*2=4. Pair (5,6) sum is 2*3=6. So each pair contributes 2k for k=1,2,3,...\n\nSo when n is even, the number of such pairs is n/2. The sum is sum_{k=1 to m} 2k, where m is the number of pairs. Because for each pair, 2k is added. For example, when n=4 (two pairs), sum is 2 +4 =6. Let's check: 1+1+2+2=6. Yes.\n\nIf n is even, m = n/2. The sum is 2*(1+2+...+m) = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1).\n\nIf n is even, sum = m(m+1) where m =n/2.\n\nIf n is odd, then there's an extra term. For example, when n=5: pairs (1,2), (3,4), sum 2+4=6, plus the fifth term ceil(5/2)=3. So sum is 6+3=9.\n\nSo for odd n=2m+1, the sum is m(m+1) + (m+1). Because the extra term is ceil((2m+1)/2) = m+1. So sum is m(m+1) + (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Alternatively, sum = ( (n+1)/2 )^2 when n is odd. Because for n=5: (5+1)/2 =3, 3^2=9. Correct.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor n even: sum = m(m+1) where m =n/2.\n\nFor n odd: sum = (m+1)^2 where m= (n-1)/2. Because (n-1)/2 is m when n=2m+1.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nn=5: m=(5-1)/2=2. sum is (2+1)^2=9. Correct.\n\nn=3: m=1. sum (1+1)^2=4. Which is 1+1+2=4. Correct.\n\nSo the sum can be expressed as:\n\nsum = \n\nif n is even: (n/2) * (n/2 + 1)\n\nif n is odd: ((n+1)/2)^2\n\nSo combining both cases, sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n + 1) // 2 ) * ( (n // 2) + 1 )\n\nWait, let's check for even n:\n\nFor n=4: (4+1)//2 is 2 (since (4+1)/2 is 2.5, floor is 2). n//2 is 2. So 2*(2+1)=6, which is correct.\n\nFor n=5: (5+1)//2 is 3, n//2 is 2. 3*(2+1) =9, which is correct.\n\nWait, wait. Let's see:\n\nFor even n=2m:\n\nsum = m*(m+1).\n\nWhich is m*(m+1) = (2m/2) * (2m/2 +1) = m*(m+1).\n\nFor odd n=2m+1:\n\nsum is (m+1)^2.\n\nBut (n+1)//2 is (2m+1 +1)/2= (2m+2)/2 = m+1. And (n//2) is (2m+1)/2 = m. So (m+1)*(m+1) = (m+1)^2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula sum = ( (n+1)/2 ) * ( (n//2) + 1 ) holds for both even and odd n.\n\nYes. So for any n, sum = floor((n+1)/2) * ( floor(n/2) + 1 )\n\nSo sum is equal to (k) * (m +1), where k is ceil(n/2) and m is floor(n/2).\n\nBut since for even n: k = m +1? Wait, for even n=2m: k = (2m +1)/2 rounded down, which is m. m +1 is m+1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nBut regardless, the formula works. So sum can be calculated as ((n+1)//2) * ( (n//2) + 1 ).\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For a given n, compute the sum of ceil(i/2) from i=1 to n. Let's call this total.\n\n2. Find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= total.\n\nWe need to compute s as the integer square root of total. So s = floor( sqrt(total) )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e9), and for t=1e4 test cases.\n\nWait, but for n up to 1e9, the sum can be up to ((1e9+1)/2) * ( (1e9)/2 +1 ), which is approximately (5e8) * (5e8 + 1) \u2248 2.5e17. So s could be up to sqrt(2.5e17) which is about 5e8. So for each test case, we need to compute s as the integer part of the square root of the total.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nBut given that the sum is already a function of n, perhaps we can find a formula for s in terms of n without computing the sum, or find a pattern that allows us to compute s directly from n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to express s in terms of n, avoiding the step of computing the sum and then taking its square root.\n\nLet's see.\n\nThe sum is:\n\nFor even n=2m:\n\nsum = m*(m+1) = m\u00b2 + m.\n\nWe need to find the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 + m.\n\nSo s\u00b2 <= m\u00b2 + m. Let's find s in terms of m.\n\nm\u00b2 + m = m(m+1). The square of (m + 0.5) is m\u00b2 + m + 0.25. So m(m+1) is less than (m + 0.5)^2. So the square root of m(m+1) is between m and m+0.5. Therefore, the integer part s is m.\n\nWait, let's check for m=2 (n=4):\n\nsum= 2*3=6. s is floor(sqrt(6))=2. So the maximum s is 2.\n\nWhich matches. For example, n=4, the sum is 6. So 2\u00b2=4 <=6, 3\u00b2=9>6. So s=2.\n\nAnother example: m=3, sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. So s=3.\n\nYes. So for even n=2m, s is m.\n\nWait, but wait, if sum is m*(m+1), then s\u00b2 <= m(m+1). The maximum s is the integer part of sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nBut sqrt(m(m+1)) = sqrt(m\u00b2 +m) \u2248 m + 0.5 - 1/(8m) + ... (using Taylor expansion). So the floor is m, since the sqrt is less than m+0.5.\n\nSo for even n, s is m = n/2.\n\nWait, but m is n/2 when even. So for even n, s = n/2.\n\nBut wait for m=1 (n=2), sum=1*2=2. s=1. Which is correct.\n\nFor m=2 (n=4), sum=6, s=2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow for the odd case.\n\nFor n=2m+1:\n\nsum = (m+1)^2.\n\nSo sum is (m+1)^2. So s is m+1.\n\nBecause s\u00b2 = (m+1)^2. So the maximum s is m+1.\n\nFor example, n=5 (m=2), sum=9, s=3. Correct.\n\nn=3 (m=1), sum=4, s=2. Correct.\n\nSo for odd n, s is (n+1)/2.\n\nBut wait, (n+1)/2 is (2m+2)/2 = m+1. So yes.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ns is:\n\nif n is even:\n\ns = n/2\n\nif n is odd:\n\ns = (n+1)/2\n\nWait, but wait. For n even, sum is m*(m+1), where m =n/2. So s is floor( sqrt(m(m+1)) ). Which is m, as discussed.\n\nBut when n is even, m is n/2. So s = m.\n\nBut for n even, (n+1)/2 is (2m +1)/2 = m +0.5, which when floored is m. So (n+1)/2 is m+0.5. For even n, the code in the given code outputs (n+1)/2, but since n is even, n+1 is odd, so (n+1)/2 is a half-integer, but stored as an integer division, so (n+1)//2 is m +0.5 rounded down? Wait, no. For example, n=4: (4+1)/2 =2.5, but integer division in C++ truncates towards zero, so (4+1)/2 is 2.5, but stored as 2 when using integer division. Wait no, in C++, (n+1) is 5, divided by 2 gives 2.5, but integer division would be 2. So (n+1)/2 when n=4 is 5/2=2 in integer division.\n\nWait, in C++, 5/2 is 2.\n\nBut for even n:\n\nn is even. So n=2m. So (n+1)/2 is (2m+1)/2 = m + 0.5. So in integer division, (2m +1)/2 is m.\n\nSo for even n, (n+1)/2 in code is m.5 becomes m, but stored as integer m.\n\nWait, no. Let's take m=2 (n=4). (4+1)/2 =5/2=2.5, but in C++, 5/2 is 2 (since integer division truncates). So (n+1)/2 is m.5, which when stored as integer is m.\n\nSo for even n, (n+1)/2 is m. So (n+1)/2 is equal to m.\n\nBut in even n case, the maximum s is m.\n\nSo in code, the current code outputs (n+1)/2 for all cases. Which for even n gives m, and for odd n gives (n+1)/2 which is m+1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor even n=4: code outputs (4+1)/2=2 (since 5/2 is 2 in integer division). Which is correct, s=2.\n\nFor even n=2: code outputs (2+1)/2=1. Correct.\n\nFor odd n=5: code outputs (5+1)/2=3. Correct.\n\nFor odd n=3: (3+1)/2=2. Correct.\n\nSo the code that is given in the problem (but incomplete) is:\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\nint main() {\nint t; std::cin>>t;\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\nlong long n;\nstd::cin>>n;\nstd::cout<<(n+1)/2<<'\\n';\n} \n}\n\nBut wait, according to our analysis, the code's output is (n+1)/2. But in the problem statement, the sample input where n=5 outputs 3. Which matches (5+1)/2=3. For n=6 (even), sum is 3*4=12. s is sqrt(12)=3.464..., so s=3. But according to (6+1)/2=3.5, which in integer division is 3. So code outputs 3. Which is correct. So the code is correct?\n\nWait, but according to our previous analysis:\n\nFor even n=2m, sum is m(m+1), and s is floor(sqrt(m(m+1)) ). For example, when m=3 (n=6), sum=3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464. s=3. The code would output (6+1)/2=3.5, but in integer division, it's 3. So code outputs 3. Correct.\n\nWait, but (n+1)/2 for even n is m +0.5, but in integer division, (n+1)/2 would be m if n is even. For example, n=6: (6+1)/2=3.5, but integer division truncates to 3.\n\nSo the code's output is (n+1)//2, which for even n is (n+1)/2 rounded down. Which is the same as (n/2) + (1)/2, but integer division.\n\nBut according to our analysis, for even n, the correct s is m =n/2. But according to the code, for even n=6, (6+1)/2=3.5 becomes 3. So code outputs 3, which is correct. So code works.\n\nWait, no. Wait for even n=2m, (n+1)/2 is m + 0.5. Integer division would truncate to m, but (n+1)//2 is m. But m is n/2. So (n+1)//2 is equal to (n/2) when n is even? Let's see:\n\nn=4, even. (4+1)/2 =2.5 \u2192 integer division gives 2. Which is n/2 (4/2=2). So yes.\n\nn=6 \u2192 6/2=3, (6+1)/2=3.5 \u2192 3. So (n+1)/2 in integer division equals n/2 when n is even.\n\nSo for even n, (n+1)/2 (integer division) equals m =n/2.\n\nBut for even n, the correct s is floor(sqrt(m*(m+1)) ). Which is m, as discussed earlier.\n\nSo the code's output for even n is m, which is correct.\n\nFor odd n=2m+1, code outputs (2m+2)/2 =m+1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct. But why in the problem statement's sample input where n=5, the code outputs (5+1)/2=3, which matches the sample. So the code seems to be correct.\n\nBut then why is the code provided incomplete? The code's loop is missing the condition. The original code has:\n\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\n\nSo the user is supposed to fill in the loop condition.\n\nIn the given code, the loop is for t test cases. So the while loop should run t times. So the condition for the while loop is t--. Because in C++, the loop runs while the condition is true. So t-- will decrement t each time, and the loop runs while t is non-zero.\n\nSo the correct code is:\n\nwhile(t--)\n\nSo the missing code is the loop condition t--.\n\nTherefore, the code should be filled with t-- as the loop condition.\n\nBut the original code is:\n\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\nint main() {\nint t; std::cin>>t;\nwhile(/* TODO: Your code here */) {\nlong long n;\nstd::cin>>n;\nstd::cout<<(n+1)/2<<'\\n';\n} \n}\n\nSo the missing part is the loop condition. The answer is to replace the /* TODO: Your code here */ with (t--).\n\nThus, the correct code is:\n\nwhile(t--)\n\nSo the code as provided, when filled with that, will correctly process each test case.\n\nBut wait, why is the code outputting (n+1)/2? Because according to our analysis, that's the correct answer.\n\nYes. So the code is correct, but the loop condition was missing. So the solution is to complete the loop condition.\n\nSo the missing code is the loop condition 't--'."
