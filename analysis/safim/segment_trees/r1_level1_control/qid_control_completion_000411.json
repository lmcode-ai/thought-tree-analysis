Wait, because the last element can have a sum that's zero (since after processing the last element, the sum is zero, which is required). So for all elements except the last, the cumulative sum after processing must be >=0. And the last element's sum must be zero (as part of the total sum being zero). Wait, but the sum after processing all elements must be zero. So the code checks sum ==0 at the end. So for the last element, the sum after adding it must be zero. So during the loop, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nsum +=a[i]\n\nThen, for i <n-1, if sum <0, then invalid. So the missing condition in the code is:\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0) --> then valid = false. But in the code, the loop is from i=0 to i <n. So for each iteration, i is in 0..n-1. Wait, the code's for loop is written as for(int i =0; i <n; ++i). So the loop runs for n elements, i ranges from 0 to n-1. In each iteration, sum is accumulated as sum +=a[i]. So after processing the i-th element (0-based?), the sum is the cumulative sum up to that element. So the condition is: if i is not the last element (i <n-1) and sum <0, then it's invalid. So in the code's if statement, which is currently:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) valid = false;\n\nThis condition should be (i <n-1 && sum <0). But wait, the sum is computed as sum +=a[i] before this check. So after adding a[i] to sum, we check if for i <n-1, sum <0. So the code's missing condition is (i != n-1) (since i <n-1 is equivalent to i ! =n-1 when i is in 0..n-1) and sum <0. So the code's missing line should be:\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0) valid = false;\n\nBut in Java, how is the loop written? The loop is for i from 0 to n-1 (since it's i <n). So for the last element (i =n-1), in the loop, i <n-1 is false. So for all elements except the last, check if sum is negative. So putting it all together, the missing code is:\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0) So the code's condition is:\n\nif( (i < n-1 && sum <0) ) valid = false;\n\nThat's the missing condition. So the code inside the for loop would be:\n\nsum +=a[i];\nif (i <n-1 && sum <0) valid = false;\nif(zeroed && a!=0) valid = false;\nif(sum ==0) zeroed = true; Yes.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what condition to put in the if statement here. Let's look at the problem again.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given array can be formed through specific operations. The operations are either moving right while incrementing the current element, or moving left while decrementing the current element. And after all operations, the pointer must be back on the first element.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the constraints that the array must satisfy. \n\nFirst, the sum of all elements must be zero. Because each right move adds 1 to the current element, and each left move subtracts 1 from the current element. But every right move followed by a left move would cancel out their contributions except for the first and last elements. Wait, maybe that's not the right way to think. Alternatively, the sum is equal to the number of right operations minus the number of left operations. Wait, no. Let's think about each step:\n\nEach time you do a right operation: you add 1 to the current element, then move right. So each right operation contributes +1 to the current element. Each left operation: subtract 1 from current, then move left. So each left operation contributes -1 to the current element. But the path taken by the pointer must form a valid sequence where you can't go left from the first element or right from the last. \n\nBut when you finish, the pointer is back at the first element. So the total number of right moves minus left moves must equal zero? Because each right move increments the position by +1, left move by -1. So for the pointer to end up at position 0 (the first element), the total displacement must be zero. Which implies that the number of right moves equals the number of left moves. Wait, no. Because each right move increases the pointer by 1, and each left move decreases by 1. The total displacement is (R - L), where R is the number of right moves and L the left moves. To end at position 0, the displacement must be zero. So R = L. \n\nBut each right move contributes +1 to the current element before moving. Each left move contributes -1 to the current element before moving. So the sum of all elements is equal to the sum of all the increments and decrements. Let's see: each right operation adds 1 to some element. Each left operation subtracts 1 from some element. So the total sum of the array is (number of right operations) minus (number of left operations). But since R = L (since displacement is zero), the sum would be R - L = 0. So yes, the sum must be zero. That's why in the code, they check if sum == 0. So that part is covered.\n\nBut there's another condition. Let's think about the elements themselves. For the array to be possible, certain constraints must hold for each element as we process them in order.\n\nAnother key observation: when processing the array from left to right, once the cumulative sum up to position i becomes zero, all elements after i must also be zero. Because once the sum becomes zero, the pointer can't have moved further right again. Wait, that's not immediately obvious. Let's think step by step.\n\nFor example, suppose we have elements a1, a2, a3. Let's think of the process of building the array. The pointer starts at a1. Each time you move right, you add 1 to a1, then go to a2. Then perhaps add to a2, and so on. But each time you move left, you subtract from the current element. So the elements depend on the path taken.\n\nAlternatively, there's a clever way to model the problem. Let's model the process as moving through the array, keeping track of the current sum. The idea is that for each position i (starting from 0), the cumulative sum up to i must be non-negative, and once the sum becomes zero at some position i (before the last), all subsequent elements must be zero. Because once the sum hits zero, the pointer can't go further right again, otherwise the sum would have to be non-zero again. Hmm, maybe that's the key.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way. The pointer starts at index 0. The process of building the array can be represented as a sequence of moves. Each right move increases the current element by 1 and moves to the next. Each left move decreases the current element by 1 and moves back. But the pointer must end at index 0. So the entire path must form a loop that returns to the start.\n\nBut modeling this directly is complicated. However, there's a mathematical way to model the required conditions. \n\nLet's process the array from left to right and track the cumulative sum. For the array to be valid:\n\n1. The total sum of all elements must be zero (as checked in the code).\n\n2. For each element a_i (except the last), the cumulative sum up to that element must be non-negative. Because if the sum becomes negative at any point before the last element, it's impossible. Because the pointer can't move past a point where the cumulative sum is negative. For example, if the cumulative sum up to i is negative, that would imply that there were more left moves than right moves up to that point, which could prevent the pointer from ever reaching further elements again. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, during the process of building the array, the cumulative sum up to any position (except the last) must not be zero before the end. Because once the cumulative sum becomes zero, the pointer is at that position and can't move further right again. So any elements after that must be zero. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem's note:\n\nIn the second test case, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. Let's compute the cumulative sums:\n\na1: 2, sum 2 (positive)\na2: -1, sum 2 + (-1) = 1 (positive)\na3: -1, sum 1 + (-1) = 0. Wait, here the sum becomes zero at index 3 (assuming 1-based?), but the next element is 0. So according to this, once the cumulative sum reaches zero, the remaining elements must be zero.\n\nWait, in that example, the sum after the third element (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) Let me check:\n\nWait, the example array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. Let's process each element step by step. The cumulative sum after each element:\n\nAfter first element (2): sum is 2.\n\nAfter second (-1): sum is 1.\n\nAfter third (-1): sum is 0.\n\nThen the fourth element is 0. So here, after the third element (index 2 in 0-based), the sum is zero. Then the fourth element must be zero, which it is.\n\nSo the condition is: once the cumulative sum reaches zero at any position before the last element, all the remaining elements must be zero. Also, the cumulative sum must never be negative before that point. Because if it becomes negative, then it's impossible.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\n- The total sum must be zero.\n\n- The cumulative sum up to each position (except the last) must be non-negative.\n\n- Once the cumulative sum becomes zero at some position i (i < n-1), all positions after i must have a[i+1], a[i+2], ... a[n-1] equal to zero.\n\nSo in the code, when processing each element a[i], we need to check two things:\n\n1. The cumulative sum up to i (sum) must be >= 0. If at any point sum <0, it's invalid.\n\n2. Once the sum becomes zero (zeroed becomes true), all subsequent elements must be zero. Because once we have sum=0 at position i, the pointer can't move further right again. So any elements after i must be zero.\n\nSo in the code, the for loop is processing each element. For each element a[i], the code checks two things: if after some point the sum becomes zero (zeroed is true), then any a[i] after that must be zero. Which is handled by the line \"if(zeroed && a!=0) valid = false;\"\n\nBut the first condition is missing. The code needs to check whether the sum (current sum) is positive up until it reaches zero. Wait, the sum after adding a[i] to the cumulative sum must be >=0. Wait, no. Wait, the sum variable is the cumulative sum. Let's see. The code initializes sum to 0. Then for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum += a[i]\n\nThen, the code checks some condition (the missing if statement), and also checks if after zeroed is set (sum was zero), then a[i] must be zero.\n\nSo the missing condition is: after adding a[i] to sum, if sum <0 and it's not the last element, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, because for each element except the last, the cumulative sum after processing that element must be >=0. Because once you reach that element (i-th), the sum up to that element (sum) must be non-negative. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nBut when processing a[i], the sum is sum +=a[i]. So for i <n-1, if sum <0, then the array is invalid.\n\nWait, because the last element can have a sum that's zero (since after processing the last element, the sum is zero, which is required). So for all elements except the last, the cumulative sum after processing must be >=0. And the last element's sum must be zero (as part of the total sum being zero).\n\nWait, but the sum after processing all elements must be zero. So the code checks sum ==0 at the end. So for the last element, the sum after adding it must be zero.\n\nSo during the loop, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nsum +=a[i]\n\nThen, for i <n-1, if sum <0, then invalid.\n\nSo the missing condition in the code is:\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0) --> then valid = false.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is from i=0 to i <n. So for each iteration, i is in 0..n-1.\n\nWait, the code's for loop is written as for(int i =0; i <n; ++i). So the loop runs for n elements, i ranges from 0 to n-1.\n\nIn each iteration, sum is accumulated as sum +=a[i]. So after processing the i-th element (0-based?), the sum is the cumulative sum up to that element.\n\nSo the condition is: if i is not the last element (i <n-1) and sum <0, then it's invalid.\n\nSo in the code's if statement, which is currently:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) valid = false;\n\nThis condition should be (i <n-1 && sum <0).\n\nBut wait, the sum is computed as sum +=a[i] before this check. So after adding a[i] to sum, we check if for i <n-1, sum <0.\n\nSo the code's missing condition is (i != n-1) (since i <n-1 is equivalent to i !=n-1 when i is in 0..n-1) and sum <0.\n\nSo the code's missing line should be:\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0) valid = false;\n\nBut in Java, how is the loop written? The loop is for i from 0 to n-1 (since it's i <n). So for the last element (i =n-1), in the loop, i <n-1 is false. So for all elements except the last, check if sum is negative.\n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code is:\n\nif (i < n-1 && sum < 0)\n\nSo the code's condition is:\n\nif( (i < n-1 && sum <0) ) valid = false;\n\nThat's the missing condition. So the code inside the for loop would be:\n\nsum +=a[i];\nif (i <n-1 && sum <0) valid = false;\nif(zeroed && a!=0) valid = false;\nif(sum ==0) zeroed = true;\n\nYes. Because:\n\nFor each element a[i], after adding to sum:\n\n- If it's not the last element and sum is negative, invalid.\n\n- If zeroed has been set (sum was zero in a previous step), then all subsequent a[i] must be zero.\n\nSo the code's missing line is (i <n-1 && sum <0).\n\nSo the answer is to fill in the if condition with (i < n-1 && sum <0)."
