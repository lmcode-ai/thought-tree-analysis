Let me look for a pattern in the sample input. The note mentions a test case where n=7 and m=5, but I'm not sure. The sample output was 15. Let me see how the code's formula works. Looking at the code, after handling n=1 and m=1, there's a line that swaps n and m if a certain condition is met. Then the formula is n + n + m -2. Wait, but if they swap n and m, then the formula would be (original m) + (original m) + (original n) -2? Let's see.",

So Megan could move first and leave all portals. Then Stanley can use the portals. So for example:\n\nMegan's path is (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5). She spends 4 steps. Portals are along all cells. Stanley starts at (1,1). He can teleport directly to (1,5) for 1 cost. So his total energy is 1. Megan's path is 4 steps. So total is 1+4=5, which matches the formula. So this is the optimal approach. So the formula works here. Another example: n=2, m=2. Formula's output: min(2,2)*2 + 2-2 = 4+0=4. Stanley's path: (1,1) to (2,2).",

So the code's condition to swap n and m is when m <n, so that after swapping, n becomes m and m becomes n, but since the formula is 2n +m -2, we need to ensure that n is the smaller of the two. Wait, the code's current line is:\n\nif (condition) swap n and m.\n\nThe formula after swapping is n +n +m -2 = 2n +m -2. So to get the minimal result, we need to have n <= m. Because if m is smaller than n, then swapping would result in 2m +n -2, which is better than 2n + m -2 if m <n.\n\nFor example, if n=5, m=3: original formula gives 2*5 +3-2=11. But if we swap, n=3, m=5: 2*3 +5-2=9. Which is better. So the condition is to swap if m <n. So that n becomes the smaller dimension. So the code's condition should be if (m <n) then swap n and m. Thus, in the code, the missing condition is m <n. So the code line should be: if (m <n) swap n and m.\n\nBut in C++, how to write that? The code uses n+=m, then m =n -m, etc. That's a way to swap without a temporary variable. For example, to swap n and m:\n\nn = n + m;\n\nm = n - m;\n\nn = n - m;\n\nBut that's only safe if n and m are integers, which they are. So the code's line is:\n\nif (m <n) then swap n and m.\n\nThus, the missing code is \"m <n\". So the code's condition is if (m <n), then swap. Thus, in the code, the TODO line should check if m is less than n. If so, swap them. So the answer is m <n.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to find the minimum total energy Stanley and Megan need for their paths. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is a grid with n rows and m columns. Stanley starts at (1,1) and goes to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and goes to (1,m). They can move to adjacent cells, each step costing 1. But Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. When someone is on a portal cell, they can spend 1 power to teleport to any other portal cell.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the sum of their energy costs. They can move in any order, and the portals are built as Megan moves.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to find the optimal path where they use portals efficiently. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's consider the basic paths without any portals. But that's probably not optimal. Using portals could save a lot of steps.\n\nMegan's portals are built along her path. So, the best way to use portals is to have a common cell that both can use to teleport, reducing their path lengths.\n\nLet's think about possible meeting points. The optimal strategy would involve both using a portal cell to teleport once. For example, Stanley could walk to a portal cell, teleport to another portal cell, then proceed. Similarly for Megan. But how to choose these cells?\n\nWait, but Megan is leaving portals as she moves. So all cells she visits are portals. So her path determines the available portals. So perhaps the optimal path is for Megan to take a path that allows both her and Stanley to use a portal in a way that minimizes the total steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is achieved when they meet at certain points and use the portals optimally.\n\nLet me look for a pattern in the sample input. The note mentions a test case where n=7 and m=5, but I'm not sure. The sample output was 15. Let me see how the code's formula works.\n\nLooking at the code, after handling n=1 and m=1, there's a line that swaps n and m if a certain condition is met. Then the formula is n + n + m -2. Wait, but if they swap n and m, then the formula would be (original m) + (original m) + (original n) -2? Let's see.\n\nWait, the code says if some condition, then swap n and m. Then output n + n + m -2. So the formula depends on whether we swap n and m.\n\nThe sample input from the note: the initial code would output something based on n=7 and m=5. Let's see the code's formula. If the code does not swap them, then 7+7+5-2 = 17. But the sample's answer is 15, so that's not matching. So perhaps the code's formula is correct when n and m are swapped in certain cases.\n\nSo maybe the code's formula is only correct when m is larger than n, so the condition is if m > n, then swap. Let's check.\n\nWait, the problem's solution probably involves considering the minimum of two possible scenarios. Let's think.\n\nIn the problem, perhaps the minimal total energy is achieved by choosing the best possible portal path. Let's model their paths.\n\nMegan's path: from (n,1) to (1,m). The minimal steps she can take is (n-1) + (m-1) steps. But she leaves portals in all cells she passes through. So the portals form a path from her start to her end.\n\nStanley's path: from (1,1) to (n,m). The minimal steps are (n-1)+(m-1). But using portals can help.\n\nThe optimal solution would involve both using a portal once. Let's say they both use a portal cell. For example, Stanley walks to a portal cell A, then teleports to another portal cell B, then walks to his destination. Similarly for Megan, perhaps she walks to B, then teleports to A, then walks to her destination. But how to choose A and B?\n\nAlternatively, the best strategy is to find a common portal that both can use. For example, maybe there's a cell where Megan's path and Stanley's path cross, allowing both to teleport once.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is the sum of their individual paths minus some overlapping that can be optimized via teleportation.\n\nWait, the problem says that the total energy is the sum of both their energies. So we need to find the sum of Stanley's energy and Megan's energy, each calculated as their path steps plus any teleportation steps.\n\nLet me think of the possible scenarios:\n\n1. Both take their direct paths without using portals. Then total energy is (n-1 + m-1) * 2. Because each has to walk (n-1 + m-1) steps. But this is probably not optimal.\n\n2. One uses a portal. For example, Stanley uses a portal. Suppose he walks a steps to a portal, teleports (cost 1), then walks b steps to destination. His total cost is a + 1 + b. Similarly for Megan.\n\nBut the portals are along Megan's path. So any portal that Stanley uses must be on Megan's path.\n\nSo the idea is that Megan's path creates a set of portals. Stanley can choose to use one of those portals once (cost 1 for teleport) to save steps.\n\nSimilarly, Megan can use her own portals as well.\n\nSo the problem is to find a portal cell (from Megan's path) that minimizes the sum of Stanley's path (including teleport) and Megan's path (including teleport).\n\nSo we need to model for each possible portal cell (x,y) in Megan's path:\n\nStanley's cost: steps from (1,1) to (x,y) + 1 (teleport) + steps from (any other portal cell (u,v)) to (n,m).\n\nWait, no. The teleport allows him to move from (x,y) to any portal cell. So the optimal choice is to teleport to the portal cell that gives the minimal steps after teleportation.\n\nBut since Megan's path is a grid path, perhaps the optimal is for her path to cover certain cells that are optimal for both.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total cost can be determined by considering the best possible meeting points.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution is for Megan to take the shortest path (which is (n-1)+(m-1) steps), and Stanley uses a portal cell in her path to teleport. The key is to find the best portal cell for Stanley to use.\n\nLet me model Stanley's path when he uses a portal once. Let's say he walks to a portal cell (a,b) in Megan's path, then teleports to another portal cell (c,d) (also in Megan's path), then walks to (n,m).\n\nBut since he can choose any (c,d), the best would be to choose the one that minimizes (steps from (1,1) to (a,b)) + 1 (teleport) + (steps from (c,d) to (n,m)).\n\nSimilarly for Megan, she can also use a portal once. But perhaps the minimal total is when each uses a portal once.\n\nBut considering that Megan's path is fixed (she takes the shortest path), her portals form a line from (n,1) to (1,m). For example, if she moves up first to (1,1) then right to (1,m), or right first then up.\n\nWait, but the problem states that Megan's path is arbitrary. So perhaps Megan's optimal path is a specific one that allows for the best portal usage.\n\nBut in the problem statement, Megan's path is fixed as the minimal steps? No. Because she can take any path, but she leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So the problem is to find the best possible path that Megan can take such that the portals' arrangement allows Stanley and Megan to minimize their total energy.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Megan needs to get from (n,1) to (1,m)\". So her path must be a path from start to end. But she can choose any path. The portals are left in every cell she visits. So the optimal solution would have her take a path that creates a set of portals that allows both Stanley and Megan to use them in a way that minimizes the total energy.\n\nBut considering all possibilities, this could be complex. However, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios where portals are used optimally.\n\nSuppose Megan takes a straight path. For example, she moves up (n-1 steps) to (1,1), then right (m-1 steps) to (1,m). Then her portals are along this path. So the portals form a line from (n,1) to (1,1) to (1,m). Stanley starts at (1,1), which is a portal. So he can use that to teleport to any other portal.\n\nBut in this scenario, Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (n,m). If he uses the portal at (1,1), he can teleport to (1,m) (if that's a portal). Then he walks down (n-1 steps) to (n,m). His cost would be 0 (since he starts at (1,1), teleport (1) to (1,m), then walk (n-1 steps). Total for him: 1 + (n-1) = n. Megan's cost is (n-1) + (m-1) steps. So total is (n + (n-1 + m-1)) + Megan's own steps. Wait, no. Wait Megan's own steps are (n-1 + m-1), but she can also use portals. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in this case Megan's path is (n,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,m). So the portals are along this path. Then, Stanley's path could be: start at (1,1) (portal), use teleport to (1,m) (cost 1), then walk down to (n,m) (n-1 steps). So his cost is 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\nMegan's path: she starts at (n,1). To reach (1,m), she can walk up (n-1 steps) to (1,1), then right (m-1 steps) to (1,m). Cost (n-1 + m-1). But she can use portals. For example, after creating the portal at (1,1), when she is at (1,1), she can teleport to any other portal. But since she hasn't created any other portals yet, except the ones she has passed. So when she is at (1,1), she can teleport back to (n,1), but that's not helpful. So in this case, Megan's path is fixed as she can't teleport until she has created other portals.\n\nWait, Megan leaves portals in all cells she visits. So the order in which she visits them matters. So her portals are built as she moves. So during her movement, the portals are created step by step. So when she is moving from (n,1) to (1,1), each cell along the way becomes a portal. Once she arrives at (1,1), that's a portal. Then, as she moves to (1,2), that's a new portal, etc.\n\nBut when can she use the portals? Only after she has placed them.\n\nSo for example, Megan starts at (n,1). She can choose to first move right to (n,2), which becomes a portal. Then perhaps she moves up to (n-1,2), and so on. But her path could vary, leading to different portals available.\n\nBut since the problem says that Megan can choose any path, the optimal solution would involve her taking a path that allows both her and Stanley to use the portals in the most optimal way.\n\nBut considering that the problem's solution is given by a formula in the code, perhaps there's a mathematical approach.\n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nThe code checks for n==1 and m==1. Then, in the else block, if some condition, swaps n and m, then outputs n + n + m -2.\n\nWait, after swapping, the formula becomes n (original m) + n (original m) + m (original n) -2. So the formula is 2*original m + original n -2.\n\nBut the code's output is n +n + m -2. So when the code swaps n and m, then the formula would be m + m +n -2. So the sum is 2m +n -2.\n\nBut in the sample input given (n=7, m=5), the output is 15. Let's see:\n\nIf n=7, m=5: 2*5 +7 -2 = 10 +7 -2 =15. Which matches the sample output. So the code's formula works when n and m are such that m is the smaller one.\n\nWait, but what's the condition for swapping? The code says: if (some condition) then swap n and m.\n\nSo, the code swaps n and m when m is smaller than n. Because then, after swapping, the formula would be 2*original n + original m -2. Which would be larger than if m was larger.\n\nWait, no. Let's think. The code's formula is 2n +m -2. So if n is larger than m, then swapping would make n smaller, leading to a smaller total. So perhaps the code's condition is to swap when m < n.\n\nWait, but for the sample input n=7, m=5. The code swaps n and m, making n=5, m=7. Then the formula is 5+5 +7-2= 15. Which matches.\n\nSo the code's formula is 2*min(n,m) + max(n,m) -2.\n\nBut how does that formula relate to the problem?\n\nAh, perhaps the minimal total energy is determined by considering the best possible path where both Stanley and Megan use the portals once. And the formula comes down to the sum of their paths minus some overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is 2*min(n,m) + max(n,m) -2.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet's think of when n and m are such that one is larger than the other.\n\nLet me take n=2 and m=3.\n\nAccording to the formula, min is 2. So 2*2 +3 -2=4+3-2=5.\n\nBut what's the actual energy? Let's see.\n\nIn this case, the optimal path could be:\n\nMegan's path: from (2,1) to (1,3). She can move right two steps, then up once. So her path is (2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(1,3). That's 3 steps, but she leaves portals in all cells.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) to (2,3). He can move right to (1,2), use the portal (if Megan's path has (2,2) as a portal), teleport to (2,2), then move right to (2,3). But wait, Megan's path here may not have (1,2) as a portal. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Megan's optimal path is to go up first to (1,1), then right to (1,3). Then her portals are along that path.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1), which is a portal. He can teleport to (1,3) (cost 1) and then move down to (2,3) (cost 1). So his total cost is 0 steps to portal (1,1), teleport (1), then 1 step. Total 2.\n\nMegan's path: she starts at (2,1). She moves up to (1,1) (1 step), then right to (1,3) (2 steps). Total 3 steps.\n\nBut wait, Megan's cost is 3 steps. Stanley's cost is 2. Total 5. Which matches the formula's result.\n\nSo in this case, the formula works.\n\nAnother example: n=3, m=2. Then min is 2, max is3. 2*2+3-2=5.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMegan's path could be from (3,1) to (1,2). She can go up two steps to (1,1), then right one step. Portals are (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can teleport to (1,2) (cost 1), then down two steps to (3,2). Cost 1 +2=3.\n\nMegan's cost is 3 steps (up two, right one). So total 3+3=6? But according to the formula, the answer is 5. Hmm, maybe my example is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps when n=3 and m=2, after swapping, the code will have n=2 and m=3. So the formula is 2*2 +3-2=5. So how?\n\nMegan's path could be to (1,2) via a different path. For example, she moves right from (3,1) to (3,2), then up to (1,2). Steps: 1 (right) + 2 (up) =3. Portals are (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (1,2).\n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can walk to (3,2) through portals. For example, he walks right to (1,2) (1 step, but Megan hasn't placed that portal yet. Alternatively, Megan's path is (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2). So portals are at those cells.\n\nStanley's path: He can walk down to (3,1) (2 steps). Then use the portal there, teleport (1) to (1,2), then walk to (3,2) (2 steps). Total steps 2+1 +2=5? But Megan's cost is 3. Total 5+3=8, which is not matching. So I must have misunderstood the scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct and I'm missing something. Let's think differently.\n\nThe formula for the code is (after swapping if needed) n +n + m-2. So 2n +m -2. Which, when n and m are swapped if m <n, gives min(n,m)*2 + max(n,m) -2.\n\nSo the formula is min(n,m)*2 + max(n,m) -2.\n\nBut why is this the correct formula?\n\nPerhaps the optimal strategy is for both Stanley and Megan to teleport once through a common portal, and the formula captures this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is (n + m -2) * 2 minus some overlapping steps, plus the cost of teleportation.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to find a pattern.\n\nLet's take a case where n=1 and m=5. Then min is 1, max is5. The formula gives 2*1 +5 -2 =5. But according to the problem's note, when n=1 and m=1, output is 0. So in this case, when n=1, m=5.\n\nStanley's path: from (1,1) to (1,5). Since n=1, he has to move right 4 steps. Megan's path: from (1,1) to (1,5). So same path. Portals are along that path.\n\nStanley can use portals. For example, he can walk to (1,2) (1 step), teleport to (1,5) (1 cost), total 2.\n\nMegan's path: she starts at (1,1), walks to (1,5) (4 steps). But she can use portals as well. For example, she can teleport once.\n\nWait, she leaves portals as she moves. So she starts at (1,1), then moves to (1,2), etc. So as she moves, she leaves portals. So after moving to (1,2), she can teleport back to (1,1) if she wants. But that's not helpful.\n\nBut according to the formula, the total is 5. So for Stanley and Megan:\n\nStanley's path: 4 steps (without teleport) \u2192 total energy 4. Megan's path: 4 steps. Total 8. But formula says 5. So obviously, there's a better way.\n\nAh, because they can teleport. So in this case, n=1 and m=5.\n\nStanley's path:\n\nHe can start at (1,1), teleport to (1,5) (cost 1), but Megan hasn't placed that portal yet. Because Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,5). So when Megan starts, she leaves a portal at (1,1). Then moves to (1,2), leaves a portal there. So by the time she reaches (1,5), all cells are portals.\n\nBut the order of their movements is flexible. So Megan could move first and leave all portals.\n\nThen Stanley can use the portals.\n\nSo for example:\n\nMegan's path is (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5). She spends 4 steps. Portals are along all cells.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can teleport directly to (1,5) for 1 cost. So his total energy is 1.\n\nMegan's path is 4 steps. So total is 1+4=5, which matches the formula.\n\nSo this is the optimal approach.\n\nSo the formula works here.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2.\n\nFormula's output: min(2,2)*2 + 2-2 = 4+0=4.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) to (2,2). He can walk down to (2,1) (1 step), then right (1 step) \u2192 total 2. But using portals:\n\nMegan's path: from (2,1) to (1,2). She can move up to (1,1), then right to (1,2). Portals are (2,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nStanley can start at (1,1) (portal), teleport to (1,2) (cost 1), then down to (2,2) (1 step). Total cost 1+1=2.\n\nMegan's cost: moving from (2,1) to (1,1) (1 step), then to (1,2) (1 step) \u2192 total 2 steps. So total energy 2+2=4. Which matches the formula.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nThe formula is therefore min(n,m)*2 + max(n,m) -2.\n\nSo the code's condition to swap n and m is when m <n, so that after swapping, n becomes m and m becomes n, but since the formula is 2n +m -2, we need to ensure that n is the smaller of the two. Wait, the code's current line is:\n\nif (condition) swap n and m.\n\nThe formula after swapping is n +n +m -2 = 2n +m -2.\n\nSo to get the minimal result, we need to have n <= m. Because if m is smaller than n, then swapping would result in 2m +n -2, which is better than 2n + m -2 if m <n.\n\nFor example, if n=5, m=3: original formula gives 2*5 +3-2=11. But if we swap, n=3, m=5: 2*3 +5-2=9. Which is better.\n\nSo the condition is to swap if m <n. So that n becomes the smaller dimension.\n\nSo the code's condition should be if (m <n) then swap n and m.\n\nThus, in the code, the missing condition is m <n.\n\nSo the code line should be:\n\nif (m <n) swap n and m.\n\nBut in C++, how to write that? The code uses n+=m, then m =n -m, etc. That's a way to swap without a temporary variable.\n\nFor example, to swap n and m:\n\nn = n + m;\n\nm = n - m;\n\nn = n - m;\n\nBut that's only safe if n and m are integers, which they are.\n\nSo the code's line is:\n\nif (m <n) then swap n and m.\n\nThus, the missing code is \"m <n\".\n\nSo the code's condition is if (m <n), then swap.\n\nThus, in the code, the TODO line should check if m is less than n. If so, swap them.\n\nSo the answer is m <n."
