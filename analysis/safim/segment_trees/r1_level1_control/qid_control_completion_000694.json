So the divisions are as follows:\n- Division 1: 1900 and above.\n- Division 2: 1600 to 1899.\n- Division 3: 1400 to 1599.\n- Division 4: 1399 and below. Looking at the existing code structure. The first condition checks if x is less than 1400, which covers Division 4. Then, else if (x < 1600) handles Division 3. The next else if is supposed to check for Division 2, which is 1600 <= x <= 1899. So what's the condition here? So Division 2 is when the rating is >=1600 and <=1899. So the condition here should check if x is between 1600 and 1899. But how to express that in the else if. Wait, the existing code structure is in a cascading manner. Let's think about the order. The first condition is x < 1400. If that's false, then x is >=1400. The next condition is x <1600. So that covers 1400-1599 (Division 3). If that's false, x is >=1600. Now the next else if is checking for Division 2. So Division 2 is when x is between 1600 and 1899. So the condition here would be x < 1900. Because if x is >=1600 (since previous else if was false), and if x is less than 1900, then it's Division 2. Otherwise, it's Division 1. So the missing condition is x < 1900. Because after the first two conditions, the code checks for Division 2. So the else if (x < 1900) would mean 1600 <= x <1900, which is exactly Division 2. Then the else clause would be for x >=1900, which is Division 1. So the missing code is x <1900. So the line should be:\n\n} else if (x < 1900) { Yes. That makes sense. Let's test with the sample inputs. Sample test case 6 has 1679. It should be Division 2. 1679 is between 1600 and 1899, so x <1900 is true. Correct. Another test case like 1899 would enter this block. 1900 would fall into the else. Yes, that's correct. So the missing condition is x <1900.",
