When someone steps on a portal, they can teleport to any other portal by spending 1 unit. The movement between adjacent cells costs 1 unit each.

But how?\n\nWait, the code's two options are (m + 2n -2) vs (n + 2m -2). The minimal between the two would be the one where the smaller of (m + 2n) and (n + 2m) is chosen. Let's see. For m + 2n -2 and n + 2m -2, whichever is smaller depends on whether m + 2n is smaller than n + 2m. Which is equivalent to m < n. Because m + 2n < n + 2m => m < n.\n\nWait, let's subtract the two:\n\n(m + 2n) vs (n + 2m). The difference is (m + 2n) - (n + 2m) = -m +n. So if n > m, then (m+2n) is larger than (n+2m), so (n+2m) is smaller. So the condition for using the first formula (m + 2n -2) would be when (m + 2n) is smaller than (n + 2m), which would be when m < n. Wait, wait:",

So Stanley's cost is 1. Megan's cost is 4. Total is 5. Which matches the code's first formula (5). So this case works. Another case: n=5, m=1. Code's formulas are (1 + 2*5 -2) = 9, and (5 + 2*1 -2) =5. So code would choose 5. Megan's path is from (5,1) to (1,1), which is 4 steps. Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (5,1). He can teleport: teleport from (1,1) to (5,1) (cost 1). So total sum is 4 +1 =5. Which is correct. So code's condition works here. Another case: n=2, m=3.\n\nn=2 < m=3 \u2192 code's formula is m + 2n -2 \u2192 3+4-2=5. Megan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). Steps: 1 (down) +2 (right) =3 steps. Stanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 teleport to (2,1) \u2192 (2,3). Steps: 2 (right) + 1 (teleport) + 2 (right) \u2192 steps: 2+1+2=5. Sum is 3+5=8. But code's formula says 5, which is less than 8. So this suggests a problem. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Or maybe the code's approach is incorrect. Wait, code's formula for n=2, m=3 gives 3 + 4-2=5. But according to my example, the sum is 8. So something is wrong. Wait, maybe my example is wrong. Let's re-calculate. Stanley's path from (1,1) to (2,3). Without using portals: (2-1)+(3-1) =1+2=3 steps. Megan's path from (2,1) to (1,3): steps (1) up to (1,1), then 2 steps right: 1+2=3 steps. Sum is 3+3=6. But code's formula gives 5, which is less than 6. How is this possible? Ah, perhaps there's a way to use portals to reduce the sum. For example:\n\nMegan's path is from (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,3) \u2192 portals along this path. Stanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 teleport to (1,3) (cost 1) \u2192 then to (2,3) (1 step). Total steps 1+1=2. Megan's steps: 3. Sum is 2+3=5, which matches code's formula. Ah, right! So Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) (cost 1), then walk down to (2,3) (1 step). His total is 2. Megan's steps are 3. Sum is 5. So code's formula works here. So the code's approach is correct. Thus, the condition in the code is to choose between the two formulas based on whether n < m. If yes, then use m + 2n -2; else, use n + 2m -2. So the missing condition is (n < m).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to solve this programming problem. The problem is about finding the minimum total energy Stanley and Megan need to spend to complete their paths through the grid using portals. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem says that Stanley starts at (1,1) and goes to (n,m), while Megan starts at (n,1) and goes to (1,m). They can use portals that Megan leaves in every cell she visits. When someone steps on a portal, they can teleport to any other portal by spending 1 unit. The movement between adjacent cells costs 1 unit each. We need to find the minimal total energy for both to complete their paths.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how the portals work. Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So her path is from (n,1) to (1,m), and every cell along her path has a portal. So the portals form the path that Megan takes. But since they can choose when to move, perhaps the optimal path involves using these portals optimally.\n\nWait, but Megan's path could vary. Wait, no\u2014since she has to go from her start to her end, and she leaves portals in every cell she visits. But maybe the optimal path for her is the shortest possible? Or maybe not, because Stanley can use those portals as well. So perhaps the portals' placement is determined by Megan's path, and we need to choose Megan's path such that the sum of their energies is minimized.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So her path must be such that she leaves portals along her entire path. So the portals are all the cells she steps on. So the optimal solution is to choose Megan's path in such a way that Stanley can use some of those portals to minimize their combined energy.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think of the problem as finding the best point where both Stanley and Megan can use portals to teleport, thereby saving steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal energy is achieved by having them meet at certain portals. For example, perhaps the best is for both to walk to a certain portal cell, teleport, and then proceed. The idea is to find a cell that minimizes the sum of their steps plus the teleport costs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal path is when they share a common portal, and use that to teleport once. Let's think of possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, let's model the energy consumption. Each of them can use the portals in Megan's path. Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m), so possible paths could be going straight up and then right, or right and then up. But since the problem allows them to choose any path, perhaps the minimal total energy comes from the best possible path Megan can take.\n\nWait, but Megan's path is fixed in the sense that she must leave portals in all the cells she visits. So perhaps the optimal approach is for Megan to take the shortest path (which is (n + m - 2) steps), but perhaps there's a way for Stanley to use her portals to save steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal path is determined by the minimal of two options: either Megan's path is such that she covers some optimal row or column, allowing Stanley to use a portal in that row or column to teleport and save steps.\n\nLet's think about the initial steps. The code provided in the problem has a condition where, if a certain condition is met, it prints (m + 2n -2), else (n + 2m -2). So the code is choosing between these two values, but the condition is missing.\n\nSo the task is to find what condition in the code leads to the correct answer. Let's see.\n\nThe code says, if (n*m !=1), then check some condition. If true, output (m + 2n -2), else output (n + 2m -2). Otherwise, output 0.\n\nWait, but the sample input from the note is when n=7, m=5. The answer is 15. Let's see what the formula would give. If the code uses (m + 2n-2) when some condition is true. For n=7, m=5, 5 + 2*7 -2 = 5+14-2=17. But the sample answer is 15. So maybe the code is missing something here. Wait, but perhaps the note's example is for a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's formula is not correct. Wait, maybe the code's approach is not the right way. So perhaps the code given is part of a correct approach, but the condition is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering two possible scenarios: the minimal path is either when the portals are arranged along a row or along a column. Then the minimal sum is the minimum between two options.\n\nWait, let's think of the minimal sum. For Stanley and Megan:\n\nStanley's path from (1,1) to (n,m). Without using portals, he needs (n-1) + (m-1) steps, which is n + m -2.\n\nMegan's path from (n,1) to (1,m). Similarly, her steps are (n-1) + (m-1) steps, so also n + m -2.\n\nBut if they use portals, maybe they can save steps.\n\nWait, but using portals requires that they have to spend 1 unit to teleport. So for example, if both can use a portal to teleport once, perhaps the total steps can be reduced.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's imagine that Megan's path is along the first row and then down. Wait, perhaps Megan's path is such that she leaves portals in certain cells that allow Stanley to teleport.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is that both Stanley and Megan use a portal cell that is optimal, then teleport. Let's suppose there's a portal cell (x,y) that Stanley can reach with a steps, then teleport to another portal cell (u,v) which is closer to his destination, saving steps. Similarly for Megan.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is the sum of the individual minimal paths, minus some overlapping steps that can be saved via teleportation.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of the problem as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is the sum of:\n\nStanley's steps (without teleport) + Megan's steps (without teleport) - some saving due to teleport.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal approach is to use a single teleport each, saving some steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is the minimum of two possible options:\n\nOption 1: Stanley and Megan both walk their entire paths, no teleport. Total is 2*(n + m -2) *2? Wait, no. Wait, without teleport, Stanley's steps are (n-1)+(m-1) = n+m-2. Megan's steps are (n-1)+(m-1) = same. But since they can use portals, perhaps they can save some steps.\n\nWait, but Megan leaves portals along her path, so when she moves, she's leaving portals. So when Stanley moves, he can choose to use any of those portals. So maybe the optimal strategy is that both use the portals in such a way that they can teleport once, reducing their path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is the sum of the individual minimal steps plus 2 (for two teleports) minus the saved steps.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too vague. Let's look for a pattern in the code.\n\nThe code has:\n\nif (n * m != 1) {\n\n   if (some condition) print (m + 2n -2)\n\n   else print (n + 2m -2)\n\n}\n\nElse print 0.\n\nSo for n=7 and m=5, the code would check the condition and decide which formula to use.\n\nBut in the sample input, the correct answer is 15. Let's compute:\n\nOption 1: m + 2n -2: 5 + 14 -2 = 17.\n\nOption 2: n + 2m -2:7 + 10 -2 =15. Which matches the sample's 15. So in this case, the code would choose the second option. So the condition must have been false here.\n\nSo the code's condition is choosing between the two options. So the condition is checking whether m + 2n -2 is better than n + 2m -2, or vice versa. But how?\n\nWait, the code's two options are (m + 2n -2) vs (n + 2m -2). The minimal between the two would be the one where the smaller of (m + 2n) and (n + 2m) is chosen. Let's see. For m + 2n -2 and n + 2m -2, whichever is smaller depends on whether m + 2n is smaller than n + 2m. Which is equivalent to m < n. Because m + 2n < n + 2m => m < n.\n\nWait, let's subtract the two:\n\n(m + 2n) vs (n + 2m). The difference is (m + 2n) - (n + 2m) = -m +n. So if n > m, then (m+2n) is larger than (n+2m), so (n+2m) is smaller. So the condition for using the first formula (m + 2n -2) would be when (m + 2n) is smaller than (n + 2m), which would be when m < n. Wait, wait:\n\nWait, if m + 2n < n + 2m \u2192 m + 2n < n +2m \u2192 2n -n < 2m -m \u2192 n < m. So if n < m, then m + 2n is smaller. Otherwise, the other.\n\nSo in the code, the condition should be whether n < m. Because in that case, the first option (m+2n-2) is better. Otherwise, the second option is better.\n\nWait, let's take example:\n\nSample input n=7, m=5. n=7, m=5. n is greater than m. So according to the condition, since n>m, then the code would output the second option (n + 2m -2) =7+10-2=15, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, m=5. Here n < m. So the code would choose the first option (5 +6 -2=9). Let's see: what is the minimal sum here?\n\nBut how to verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal between (m + 2n -2) and (n + 2m -2), which is equivalent to min(m + 2n, n + 2m) -2.\n\nWhich is min( m+2n, 2m +n ) -2.\n\nBut according to the code, the code checks which of the two is smaller and outputs that. So the condition in the code should be whether (m + 2n) < (n + 2m) \u2192 if yes, then first formula. Else, second.\n\nBut as per earlier reasoning, this is equivalent to checking if n < m. Because m +2n < n +2m \u2192 n < m.\n\nSo the condition in the code is if (m + 2n < n + 2m) \u2192 which simplifies to if (n < m).\n\nSo the code's condition should be if (n < m), then print (m + 2n -2), else print the other.\n\nSo in the code, the missing condition is (n < m). So the line would be:\n\nif (n < m) ... \n\nBut in the code, the line is written as if(/* TODO: Your code here */) printf(...).\n\nSo the code is to fill the condition. So the condition is (n < m).\n\nSo putting that into the code, the missing line is:\n\nif(n < m)\n\nThus, the correct code checks if n is less than m. If so, outputs the first formula, else the second.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample input n=7, m=5. So 7 is not less than 5 \u2192 condition is false. So code outputs (n+2m-2) which is 7 + 10 -2=15, correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=5 \u2192 3<5. So output is 5 +6-2=9. Let's see if that's correct.\n\nBut what would be the actual minimal sum here.\n\nFor n=3, m=5.\n\nStanley's path: from (1,1) to (3,5). The normal path is 3-1 +5-1=2+4=6 steps. But using portals:\n\nMegan's path is from (3,1) to (1,5). Her steps: 2 (to get from 3 to 1) +4 (to get from 1 to 5) =6 steps. But she leaves portals along her path. Suppose Megan's path is up to (1,1) and then right. Then her path is (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 ... \u2192 (1,5). So portals are along the first column and first row.\n\nStanley can take the path (1,1) (portal) \u2192 teleport to (3,1) (portal), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps he can walk to (1,5), then teleport to (3,1), but that's more steps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal path is for Stanley to walk to (1,1) (no steps), then teleport to (3,1) (cost 1), then walk to (3,5) (4 steps). So total steps 1+4=5. But Megan's steps are 6. So total is 5+6=11. But according to the formula, the code would output 9.\n\nWait, this suggests that perhaps the code's approach is not correct. So maybe there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal sum is not the sum of Stanley's and Megan's individual minimal steps, but considering that using portals can reduce their combined steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's formula is correct. Let's think again.\n\nThe code's formula for when n < m is (m + 2n -2). For n=3, m=5: 5+6-2=9. Let's see what that represents.\n\nMaybe the minimal sum is the minimal of two possibilities: either the portals are arranged in such a way that the best portal for Stanley is in a certain row or column.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is for Megan to take a certain path, and then both Stanley and Megan can use the portals she leaves to minimize their steps.\n\nLet me try to think of the formula.\n\nSuppose that the minimal sum is (n + m - 2) * 2 - some saved steps + teleport cost.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is (n + m -2) * 2, which is 2n + 2m -4. But the code's options are m + 2n -2 and n + 2m -2. For example, for n=3, m=5, code's first option is 5 +6-2=9. Which is less than 2n+2m-4=6+10-4=12. So the code's approach is better.\n\nBut how does this formula come about?\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's think of the scenario where Megan's path is arranged such that she takes a path that allows Stanley to use a portal early.\n\nFor example, suppose Megan's path is along the first row. So she goes from (n,1) to (1,1), then to (1,m). Then Stanley's path can be (1,1) to (1,m) using steps (m-1), then teleport to (n,1) (cost 1), then walk to (n,m) (steps (m-1)). But that's (m-1) +1 + (m-1) = 2m-1. Megan's path would be (n-1) steps up to (1,1), then (m-1) steps right. Total steps (n-1)+(m-1) =n+m-2. Sum is (2m-1) + (n+m-2) = n+3m-3. But this is not matching the code's formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as choosing the minimal between two options:\n\nOption 1: Both use the same portal to teleport.\n\nOption 2: One uses a portal, the other doesn't.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is computed as follows:\n\nFor Stanley, the minimal steps are (n + m -2) - x + 1 (teleport cost), where x is the steps saved by using the teleport.\n\nSimilarly for Megan. But how to model x?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal sum is the minimal of the two possibilities: either choose a row-based portal path or a column-based one.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's formula is derived from the following reasoning:\n\nThe minimal sum is the sum of the minimal steps for Megan and Stanley, plus some teleport costs.\n\nMegan's minimal steps is (n + m -2). But when she leaves portals, Stanley can use them.\n\nFor example, if Megan's path covers the first row, then Stanley can start at (1,1) which is a portal. He can teleport to (n,1) (Megan's starting point), then walk to (n,m). Steps: 1 (teleport) + (m-1) steps. Total for Stanley: 1 + m-1 = m.\n\nBut Megan's steps are (n-1) (down to (1,1)) + (m-1) (right to (1,m)) = n+m-2. So total sum is m + (n+m-2) = n + 2m -2.\n\nAlternatively, if Megan's path covers the first column, then Stanley can start at (1,1), walk down to (n,1) (portal), teleport to (1,1) (but that's not helpful). Hmm, maybe this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's formula is derived from the following idea:\n\nThe minimal sum is the minimal between:\n\n- Megan's steps (n+m-2) + Stanley's steps (1 + (m-1) + (n-1)) = 1 + m-1 +n-1 = m +n-1. So sum is (n+m-2) + (m +n -1) = 2n + 2m -3. No, that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is based on the following idea: The minimal sum is the sum of Megan's steps plus Stanley's steps, which are (n+m-2) + (something). But what is Stanley's something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to find the minimal between two scenarios:\n\n1. Stanley uses a portal in the first row or first column.\n\n2. Stanley uses a portal in the first column or last row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code's formula:\n\nThe code outputs either (m + 2n -2) or (n + 2m -2).\n\nLet's compute both for different scenarios.\n\nCase 1: n=1, m=5.\n\nThen the code's formulas are 5+2*1 -2=5. Or 1+10-2=9. So code would output 5.\n\nBut what is the actual minimal sum?\n\nMegan starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (1,5). She has to walk 4 steps, leaving portals. Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (1,5). His minimal path is 4 steps, but perhaps he can teleport. But Megan's path is along the same line. Wait, but Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, so (n,1) is (1,1)), and she has to go to (1,5). So her path is 4 steps. Stanley starts at (1,1), so he can walk to (1,5) in 4 steps, or teleport. For example, he can walk to (1,1) (0 steps), teleport to (1,5) (1 unit), saving 3 steps. But Megan hasn't placed the portal at (1,5) yet. Because she leaves portals as she visits them. So if Megan's path is to go from (1,1) to (1,5), then Stanley can teleport once she's there.\n\nBut they can choose the time to move. So perhaps Megan moves first, leaves all portals, then Stanley uses them.\n\nSo in this case, Megan's path is 4 steps. Stanley's path: he can teleport from (1,1) to (1,5), costing 1 unit, then no steps. So Stanley's cost is 1. Megan's cost is 4. Total is 5. Which matches the code's first formula (5).\n\nSo this case works.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=1.\n\nCode's formulas are (1 + 2*5 -2) = 9, and (5 + 2*1 -2) =5. So code would choose 5.\n\nMegan's path is from (5,1) to (1,1), which is 4 steps. Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (5,1). He can teleport: teleport from (1,1) to (5,1) (cost 1). So total sum is 4 +1 =5. Which is correct.\n\nSo code's condition works here.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=3.\n\nn=2 < m=3 \u2192 code's formula is m + 2n -2 \u2192 3+4-2=5.\n\nMegan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). Steps: 1 (down) +2 (right) =3 steps. Stanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 teleport to (2,1) \u2192 (2,3). Steps: 2 (right) + 1 (teleport) + 2 (right) \u2192 steps: 2+1+2=5. Sum is 3+5=8. But code's formula says 5, which is less than 8. So this suggests a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Or maybe the code's approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, code's formula for n=2, m=3 gives 3 + 4-2=5. But according to my example, the sum is 8. So something is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe my example is wrong. Let's re-calculate.\n\nStanley's path from (1,1) to (2,3).\n\nWithout using portals: (2-1)+(3-1) =1+2=3 steps.\n\nMegan's path from (2,1) to (1,3): steps (1) up to (1,1), then 2 steps right: 1+2=3 steps.\n\nSum is 3+3=6. But code's formula gives 5, which is less than 6. How is this possible?\n\nAh, perhaps there's a way to use portals to reduce the sum.\n\nFor example:\n\nMegan's path is from (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,3) \u2192 portals along this path.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 teleport to (1,3) (cost 1) \u2192 then to (2,3) (1 step). Total steps 1+1=2.\n\nMegan's steps: 3.\n\nSum is 2+3=5, which matches code's formula.\n\nAh, right! So Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) (cost 1), then walk down to (2,3) (1 step). His total is 2.\n\nMegan's steps are 3. Sum is 5.\n\nSo code's formula works here.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nThus, the condition in the code is to choose between the two formulas based on whether n < m. If yes, then use m + 2n -2; else, use n + 2m -2.\n\nSo the missing condition is (n < m)."
