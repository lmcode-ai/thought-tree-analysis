But in the example given in the problem statement, \"BRB BW\" (the first example in the problem), the sum of R and B in the first segment (BRBB) is 3 (two B's and one R). Wait, that's sum 3, which is odd. So this contradicts that idea. Hmm. So that approach is wrong. Alternative approach: Each application of the stamp toggles the colors of the two cells. So, for a pair of cells, each stamp application changes their colors.",

So the stamps are applied within the segment. So the segment is contiguous and non-W. So in this case, cell 3 would be W, but the stamp can't be applied to cell 2-3 if cell3 is W. So perhaps this approach is not applicable. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's look for the correct approach in the code. The code currently splits the input into pieces separated by W, then for each piece, checks if some condition is met. The code's current variables pr and pb are the first occurrence of R and B in the piece. The code checks if (pr == -1 || pb == -1). Because if either pr or pb is -1, that means the piece is all R's or all B's. For example, if pr is -1, then the piece has no R's (all B's), and if pb is -1, then all R's.",

So for a piece of length 1, if it's R or B, then pr or pb would be 0, but the other would be -1. So the condition pr == -1 || pb == -1 would trigger, and set isbad = 1. So that correctly invalidates a piece of length 1. Wait, let's test this. For example, if the piece is \"R\", then pr is 0, pb is -1. So (pr == -1 || pb == -1) evaluates to true.

So perhaps \"RBRR\" is impossible. But according to the code's condition, it would be considered valid. So this suggests that the code's condition is insufficient. But according to the problem's sample input, there is a test case where the answer is \"YES\" for \"RBRB\". Wait, the problem's fifth test case has \"BRB\" and the answer is \"YES\". Which is allowed by the code's condition. So perhaps the code's condition is correct. Because when the segment has both R and B, and length >=2, then it's possible to create it using stamps. But how to explain the RBRR case? Is there a way to create it?",

But the segment is four cells. So after applying to 3-4 (assuming the segment is four cells?), the cells would be R R B R B. Which is five cells. Not applicable. I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps the code's condition is incorrect. Wait, maybe the condition should also check that the first and last characters are the same or different. Or perhaps that the number of R and B in the segment is even. Alternatively, think about the parity of the number of R and B. Since each stamp application adds one R and one B, the total number of R and B must have the same parity.",

The order can be chosen. But the cumulative effect is that each R and B in the segment must be part of at least one such pair. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the parity of the number of R and B must be the same. Because each stamp changes two cells, adding one R and one B. So the total number of R and B must have the same parity. For example, in the RBRR example, there are three R's and one B.",

So for the RBRR example, the code would accept it as valid, but it may not be possible. So there's a flaw in the code. But according to the problem statement's sample inputs:\n\nSample 5:\n\nInput: 3, \"BRB\" \u2192 output is YES. Sample 6: Input: 3, \"RBB\" \u2192 output is YES. Sample 7: Input: 1, \"W\" \u2192 output is YES. So in sample 5, the segment is B R B. The code's condition would check for pr and pb. pr is 1 (first R), pb is 0 (first B). So the condition (pr == -1 || pb == -1) is false. So code accepts it. Which is correct. So the code's condition seems to work for the samples. But what about the RBRR case?",

So this segment is valid. But according to the example above, it may not be possible to form it. But according to the code's current conditions, it would be considered valid. But how?\n\nWait, \"RRBB\" can be formed as follows:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 again as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 B B R W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 B B B R.\n\nNot helpful. Alternatively, perhaps \"RRBB\" is not possible, but according to the code's conditions, it would be considered valid. This suggests that the code's conditions are not sufficient. This is getting very complex. Perhaps the correct approach is to look for the correct answer based on the code provided. The code in question has the following structure:\n\nforeach (var p in pieces)\n{\n    if (p is empty) continue;\n    pr = p.IndexOf('R');\n    pb = p.IndexOf('B');\n    if (some condition)\n    {\n        isbad = 1;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nThe missing condition is the one that checks whether the piece is invalid. From the problem's sample input and other examples, the correct condition seems to be that the piece has no R or no B. So the code's condition should be if (pr == -1 || pb == -1). But earlier examples like \"RBRR\" would be considered valid by this condition but may not be possible. But according to the code's structure, the answer is to fill in the condition as (pr == -1 || pb == -1). But according to the problem's sample inputs, this condition works. For example, the second test case in the problem:\n\nTest case 2: n=1, s=R. The piece is \"R\". pr=0, pb=-1. So condition is true \u2192 invalid \u2192 output NO.\n\nTest case 3: n=1, s=B \u2192 similarly invalid. Test case 4: n=2, s=RR. pr=0, pb=-1 \u2192 invalid. Test case 5: n=3, s=BRB. pr=1, pb=0 \u2192 condition is false \u2192 valid. Test case 6: n=3, s=RBB \u2192 pr=0, pb=1 \u2192 valid. Thus, according to the sample inputs, the code's condition is correct. So, the missing code in the condition is:\n\npr == -1 || pb == -1 Thus, the code should check if either pr or pb is -1, indicating the piece has no R or no B.\n\nThus, the correct code to fill in is:\n\nif (pr == -1 || pb == -1)",

Which has RB and BR pairs. So not the desired RRBB. So this is impossible. So the code's current condition is not sufficient. So the correct condition must also check that there is at least one pair of adjacent R and B in the segment. But how to check that? The code's current condition is that the segment has at least one R and B (pr != -1 and pb ! = -1). But this doesn't guarantee that there's an adjacent pair.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by using the stamp multiple times. The stamp covers two adjacent cells and colors them either RB or BR. Also, each stamp application can be overlapping with previous ones, but each time it changes the colors of the two cells it's applied on. \n\nThe code given splits the input string into pieces separated by W's. Because W cells can't be changed once they're white. Wait, no. Because the stamp only affects two neighboring cells. So any W in the final picture must have never been touched by any stamp. Because every time a stamp is applied, it colors two cells. So if a cell is white in the end, that means it was never part of any stamp application. Because any stamp that covers it would have colored it either R or B, and subsequent stamps could change it again, but you can't end up with W once a stamp has been applied to it. So W's in the final string must be untouched. Therefore, the entire string must consist of segments separated by W's, and each of those segments must be possible to form using the stamps.\n\nSo for each segment (a group of non-W characters), we need to check if it's possible to form that sequence of R and B using the stamp operations. The code splits the input into these pieces using Split('W'), which gives all the non-W groups. For each of these groups, we need to validate them.\n\nThe code then checks each piece. The current code has variables pr and pb, which are the indexes of R and B in the piece. Wait, but that's not exactly right. For example, pr is the first occurrence of R, and pb is the first occurrence of B. But maybe that's not the right approach. \n\nWhat's the condition for a segment to be invalid? Let's think. Each segment must have at least one R and B. Because if a segment is all R or all B, that's impossible. Because each stamp application adds one R and one B. But wait, when you apply the stamp multiple times, you can toggle the colors. For example, if you have a segment of two cells, you can apply the stamp once to make RB, or BR. If you apply it again, it would switch them back. But for a segment of length 1, it's impossible because the stamp requires two cells. So any segment of length 1 is invalid. Also, for longer segments, perhaps there are some constraints.\n\nWait, the code splits the string into pieces separated by W, but for example, if the input is \"R\", then it's a single segment of length 1. So that's invalid. The same for \"B\", \"RR\", \"BB\", etc. Wait, but a segment of even length can be possible. Wait, no. Let's see.\n\nThe stamp is applied on two cells each time. So each application affects two cells. But for a segment of length 2, you can have RB or BR. If you apply the stamp again, you can toggle them. So for example, a segment of length 2 can have any combination of R and B as long as it alternates? Wait, no. Because each stamp application changes the two cells. So for example, applying the stamp once makes them RB. Applying it again would change them back to WB (wait no, the initial cells are white, but once you stamp once, they become RB. Stamping again would swap them to BR. Because each stamp application inverts the colors of those two cells. Wait, the stamp can be applied multiple times. Each time you apply it on the same two cells, it toggles their colors between RB and BR. So, for a segment of two cells, possible colors are either RB or BR. If you apply the stamp once, you get one of those. If you apply it again, you get the other. So for a two-cell segment, it's possible only if the colors are either RB or BR. But if the segment is of length two and all R's or all B's, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So the code splits the input into segments between W's. For each of these segments, the following must be true:\n\n1. The segment length must be at least 2. Because a segment of length 1 can't be achieved (since the stamp covers two cells). But wait, if the segment is length 1, then it's impossible. So any segment of length 1 must make the answer NO.\n\nBut wait, the code already skips empty pieces (since Split('W') may create empty strings if there are leading or trailing W's, which are skipped). For the non-empty pieces, the code checks if something is invalid. So in the code, for each piece, if the piece is invalid, then isbad is set to 1.\n\nSo, the first condition is that the length of the piece must be at least 1? Wait, no. Wait, the code splits on 'W's, so each piece is a group of non-W characters. So the length of each piece could be 1. For example, if the input is \"RWWB\", then the pieces are \"R\" and \"B\", each of length 1. Those are invalid, so the answer is NO.\n\nSo the first check for each piece is: if the length is 1, then it's invalid. Because you can't have a segment of length 1. Because the stamp covers two cells. So even if you have a single cell that is R or B, but the rest are W, but that cell is isolated, that's impossible.\n\nSo the code needs to check for each piece: if the length is 1, then invalid. But in the code, there's a 'continue' when p.Length is 0. Then for p.Length >=1, like 1, it's checked. So the code needs to check if any piece has length 1. For example, in the code, the first check is if p.Length is 0, skip. Then for each p (non-empty), check some condition. So if p has length 1, then that's invalid, and the code should set isbad to 1.\n\nBut looking at the code: the code checks if (p.Length == 0) continue. Then for the others, it checks if some condition. So the code's TODO part is where the condition is checked. So in the code, when p is a non-empty string (after splitting on W's), the code checks for pr and pb.\n\nWait, pr is the index of the first R in p. pb is the index of the first B. So if the segment has only R's, then pb will be -1. Similarly for only B's. So, for a segment to be valid, it must have both R and B? Because each stamp application adds one R and B. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, consider a segment of length 2: \"RR\". How can that happen? Each stamp application would flip two cells. Let's see. Let's say you have a segment of two cells. If you apply the stamp once, you get RB or BR. Applying the stamp again on the same cells would switch them back to WB? Wait, no. Wait, the initial cells are white. The first stamp application would set them to RB. Applying again would set them to BR. So to have RR, you can't. Because each stamp application alternates between RB and BR. So for two cells, the possible final states are RB, BR. So a segment of two cells that is RR or BB is impossible.\n\nSo, for a segment to be possible, it must have at least one R and B. But even that's not sufficient. Because the parity of the number of R's and B's may also matter.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the segment must have both R and B, and the length of the segment is at least 2. Because if the segment is all R's, even if it's longer than 2, it's impossible. For example, a segment of 3 R's. How can that happen? Let's see. Each stamp application affects two cells. Let's imagine:\n\nStamps can be applied to cells 1-2, 2-3, etc. Each application adds a R and B. But applying multiple stamps can change colors. So for example, if you apply stamp on 1-2 (RB), then on 2-3 (BR), the result is R, B R B? Wait, maybe not. Let's think step by step.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model the problem as follows: each stamp application toggles the colors of the two cells. Because each stamp can be applied in either orientation (RB or BR). So each application of the stamp on a pair of cells swaps their colors. For example, if a cell is R, applying the stamp again would turn it into B, and vice versa. But since the stamp is applied to two cells at a time, each application toggles both cells' colors. \n\nWait, no. The stamp can be applied in two ways: BR or RB. Each application changes the two cells to either BR or RB, regardless of their previous state. So it's not a toggle. For example, if a cell is R and the other is B, applying the stamp again (same pair) would set them to BR, then RB again, etc. So each application of the stamp on a pair of cells changes them to the opposite of their previous state. So each stamp application toggles the colors of the pair. So applying the stamp an even number of times on a pair leaves them as original (if applied even times, same as not applying), and odd times leaves them as the opposite.\n\nBut the initial state is white. So the first application of the stamp on a pair of cells turns them into BR or RB. Then, subsequent applications on the same pair will swap their colors each time. So the parity of the number of applications on each pair determines the color.\n\nBut how does this affect the entire segment?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern or a way to model the possible colors.\n\nAnother approach: For each non-W segment, the following must be true:\n\n- The length of the segment is at least 2.\n- The segment must contain at least one R and at least one B. Because each stamp application introduces one R and one B. So if a segment has only R's or only B's, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but when you apply multiple stamps, you can overwrite previous colors. For example, you can stamp on positions 1-2 (making them RB), then stamp on positions 2-3 (making them BR), which would affect cell 2 and 3. So cell 2 was B after first stamp, then after the second stamp, it becomes R. So cell 2 is R, cell 3 is B. Then cell 1 is R, cell 2 is R, cell 3 is B. So the segment is RRB. So in this case, there are two R's and one B. So the counts of R and B can differ. But the total number of R and B in the entire segment must have the same parity. Because each stamp application adds exactly one R and one B, but since it's possible to apply multiple stamps, the total R and B counts can vary. Wait, no. Because each stamp application affects two cells. Each application adds one R and one B (if applied once). But when applied again, it changes them. For example, applying the stamp once to a pair gives R and B. Applying again gives B and R. So each pair of applications cancels out. So the total number of R and B can be even or odd, but perhaps the parity of R and B in the entire segment must be the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each segment, the counts of R and B must have the same parity. Because each stamp application adds a net of zero (since each stamp changes two cells, one R and one B). Wait, no. Each stamp application changes two cells. For example, if they were white (W), then after stamping, they become R and B. So that's +1 R and +1 B. But applying the same stamp again changes them to B and R. So the counts remain the same. So the total number of R's and B's in the entire segment must be such that R + B is even. Because each stamp application adds one R and one B. So each application contributes +1 R and +1 B. So the sum R + B increases by 2. But since the initial sum is 0 (all W), after any number of stamps, the sum R + B is even. But in the example given in the problem statement, \"BRB BW\" (the first example in the problem), the sum of R and B in the first segment (BRBB) is 3 (two B's and one R). Wait, that's sum 3, which is odd. So this contradicts that idea. Hmm. So that approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Each application of the stamp toggles the colors of the two cells. So, for a pair of cells, each stamp application changes their colors. For example:\n\nInitial: W W\n\nApply stamp once (RB): R B\n\nApply stamp again (BR): B R\n\nApply stamp again (RB): R B\n\nSo, the parity of the number of applications determines the color. So for each cell, the number of times it is covered by a stamp determines its color. Because each time a cell is covered by a stamp, its color is toggled (from W to R/B, then R/B to B/R, etc.). Wait, but stamps can be applied to different pairs. So a cell can be part of multiple stamps. For example, cell 2 can be part of stamp on 1-2 and stamp on 2-3.\n\nSo, for each cell, the number of times it is covered by a stamp determines its final color. Because each time it's covered, the color flips.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's model each cell's color based on how many times it's been stamped. Let's say the cell starts as W. Each time it's stamped, it alternates between R and B. Wait, no. Because the stamp is applied in pairs. When a cell is stamped in a pair, the first application could be R, then the next application (if applied again) would be B, etc. So for a cell, the number of times it's stamped determines its color. But the exact color depends on the direction of the stamp each time.\n\nWait, maybe the parity of the number of times a cell is covered by the stamp determines whether it's R or B. Because each application toggles the color. For example:\n\nIf a cell is covered once: color is R or B (depending on the stamp's orientation). But the problem states that the stamp can be applied in any orientation (either RB or BR). So each stamp application on a pair can choose which color to apply. Wait, no. The stamp is applied as either RB or BR. So when you apply the stamp on a pair, you choose the order. So for example, applying the stamp on cells i and i+1 as RB or BR.\n\nBut the order can be chosen each time. So, perhaps the color of the cell is determined by the cumulative effect of all the stamps applied to it. Each stamp application to a cell's pair (either as left or right) affects its color.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think differently. Let's model the possible final configuration.\n\nEach time a stamp is applied, it sets the two cells to either RB or BR. But subsequent applications to the same pair can toggle between these two. So, for any pair of cells, the number of times the stamp is applied to them (mod 2) determines their current colors. For example, if applied once: RB. Applied again: BR. Applied thrice: RB again. So for each pair, the parity of the number of stamps applied to them determines their colors.\n\nBut when you apply stamps to overlapping pairs, the effect on individual cells is cumulative. For example, applying a stamp to 1-2 (RB) and then to 2-3 (BR):\n\nCell 1: R (from first stamp)\nCell 2: B (first stamp) then R (second stamp)\nCell 3: B (second stamp)\n\nSo the final colors are R, R, B.\n\nSo cell 2 was covered by two stamps, so each stamp toggles its color. So starting as W, first stamp makes it B, second stamp makes it R.\n\nThus, the color of a cell depends on the number of times it was covered in any stamp. Let's model each cell as the number of times it's been stamped (counted as the number of pairs that include it). For example, cell i can be part of a pair (i-1, i) or (i, i+1). Each time it's part of a pair, it's stamped, which toggles its color. So the parity of the total number of times it's been stamped determines its current color.\n\nWait, but the direction of the stamp (RB or BR) also affects the colors. Hmm. Maybe the parity of the number of times a cell is covered as the left part of a stamp and the right part affects the final color. Alternatively, perhaps the parity of the total number of stamps covering the cell (regardless of direction) determines the color. For example, each stamp application that includes the cell (whether left or right) toggles the cell's color. Then, the color is determined by the parity of the total number of stamps that cover it. \n\nBut how does the initial application direction affect the color? Let's think: when you apply a stamp on pair i and i+1 as RB, then cell i is R. If you apply it again (as RB), then cell i becomes B (since two applications, toggling back to W and then again). Wait, maybe the direction doesn't matter for the parity. Because each application toggles the color, regardless of direction. Wait, no. Because the direction determines whether the cell is R or B. For example, applying the stamp as RB once, cell i is R. Applying the stamp as BR once (same pair), cell i is B. So the direction changes the outcome. So the direction affects the actual color, not just the parity. \n\nThis complicates things. So, the problem is to determine if there exists a sequence of stamp applications (each applied to a pair, choosing the direction each time) such that the final colors match the target string. \n\nGiven the complexity of this, perhaps there's a pattern that can be observed in valid segments. Let's consider some examples.\n\nExample 1: \"BRBBW\" (from the problem statement). The first four characters are BRBB. Let's see:\n\nThe first two characters are BR. Then B and B. How can this be achieved? According to the problem's explanation, the steps involved were:\n\n1. Apply to positions 3-4 (WBWWW -> WBW RB W).\n2. Apply to 1-2 (BR WB W).\n3. Apply to 2-3 (R B becomes B R, then adding to B in position 3).\n\nHmm. Not sure. But according to the example, it's possible.\n\nAnother example: \"RB\" is possible. \"BR\" is possible. \"RR\" is impossible. \"BB\" is impossible. \"RBR\" is possible? Let's see. Suppose the segment is RBR. How can that be achieved?\n\nPossible steps:\n\n- Apply to 1-2 (RB).\n- Apply to 2-3 (BR). Result: R becomes B (from second stamp), B becomes R. So the final is R B R. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nInitial cells 1, 2, 3: W W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB: R B W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR: R becomes B (since the stamp is applied as B R? Wait, no. When you apply the stamp to 2-3 as BR, the two cells become B and R. So cell 2 becomes B, cell 3 becomes R. So after these steps, the result is R (cell 1), B (cell 2), R (cell3). So RBR. So this is possible.\n\nBut the segment has RBR, which has two R's and one B. So counts are possible even if they're not equal.\n\nSo the initial approach of checking for the presence of both R and B is necessary but not sufficient. For example, a segment of length 3 with RBR is possible, but a segment of length 3 with RRR is impossible.\n\nSo the key condition for a segment is:\n\n- The length is at least 2.\n\n- The segment contains at least one R and at least one B.\n\nBut even that is not sufficient. For example, consider a segment of length 4 with RRRB. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the segment must start and end with different colors. Or there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of the parity of the positions. Each stamp application affects two consecutive cells. So for a segment, the colors must alternate in a way that allows for overlapping stamps. For example, in a valid segment, the parity (even or odd positions) may play a role.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the segment must have at least one R and one B, and the first occurrence of R and B must have different parity. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the segment can be transformed into a valid sequence if there's at least one occurrence of R and B, and the length is at least 2.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: since each stamp application can affect any pair, the order in which stamps are applied doesn't matter. Because applying a stamp on pair i and then pair j is the same as applying j then i. Because each application toggles the colors. The end result depends on the number of times each pair is applied (mod 2). \n\nThis suggests that the problem can be modeled as a system of equations, where each pair (i, i+1) can be applied 0 or 1 times (since even applications cancel out, and odd applications are equivalent to applying once). \n\nBut solving such a system for large n is not feasible. So there must be a pattern or a simple condition that can be checked.\n\nLet's think of the colors of the cells as a sequence. Each stamp application flips two adjacent cells. For example, applying a stamp on i and i+1 in RB direction would set cell i to R and i+1 to B. Applying it again would flip them to B and R. But since the direction can be chosen each time, perhaps each stamp application can be considered as toggling the colors of the two cells in some way.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of the number of times a cell is covered by a stamp determines its color. For example, if a cell is covered an odd number of times, it's R or B (depending on the direction of the first stamp). But since the direction can be chosen for each stamp, perhaps the actual colors can be set as desired.\n\nWait, perhaps the following is true:\n\nFor a segment to be possible:\n\n1. It must have length at least 2.\n\n2. It must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\nThese are the necessary and sufficient conditions.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nTest case: \"RRB\" (length 3). This has R and B. So according to the conditions, it's possible. Which it is, as shown earlier.\n\nTest case: \"RRR\" (length 3). It has no B's. So the conditions are not met. So it's impossible. Correct.\n\nTest case: \"RBRB\" (length 4). It has R and B. So allowed. Possible.\n\nTest case: \"RBBR\" (length 4). Also allowed.\n\nTest case: \"RBR\" (length 3). Allowed and possible.\n\nAnother test case: \"BR\" (allowed) and \"RB\" (allowed).\n\nBut what about a segment like \"RBRR\" (R B R R). This has R and B, but how can it be achieved?\n\nLet's see. Suppose we have 4 cells:\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, B becomes R. So now B R W W.\n\nApply stamp to 3-4 as RB \u2192 B R R B.\n\nBut that's not the desired sequence. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's a way.\n\nAlternatively, apply stamps to 1-2 (RB \u2192 R B W W), 3-4 (RB \u2192 R B R B). Then apply to 2-3 as BR. Then cells 2 becomes R, cell 3 becomes B. So final sequence R R B B. Not matching RBRR.\n\nHmm, perhaps the segment RBRR is possible. Let's think differently.\n\nWait, the segment is R B R R. Let's see:\n\nStamps:\n\n1. Apply to 1-2 as RB: R B W W \u2192 R B W W.\n\n2. Apply to 2-3 as BR: R (B \u2192 R), then cell 3 becomes R. So R R R W.\n\n3. Apply to 3-4 as BR: cell 3 becomes B, cell4 becomes R. So R R B R.\n\nNot matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps RBRR is not possible. So the conditions (length >= 2, at least one R and B) are necessary but not sufficient. So there's another condition.\n\nThis suggests that the initial conditions are not sufficient. So what's the missing condition?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the colors as a sequence. Each stamp application to a pair i and i+1 flips their colors from whatever they were to the opposite. For example, if they were R and B, applying the stamp would make them B and R. But since the direction is chosen each time, the effect is to swap the colors. So, the parity of the number of times the stamp is applied to a pair determines the colors. But how does this affect the entire sequence?\n\nPerhaps the parity of the first and last characters in the segment must be different. Or perhaps there's a pattern in the colors.\n\nWait, let's consider that each cell's color is determined by the parity of the number of times it's been stamped. For example, if a cell is stamped an even number of times, it's white. But since the initial state is white, and each stamp toggles the color between R and B, then:\n\nIf a cell is stamped an odd number of times, it's either R or B, depending on the direction of the first stamp applied to it. But since the direction can be chosen each time, perhaps this allows us to choose the final color.\n\nBut this seems complex. Another way to look at it: each cell must be stamped an even or odd number of times. But since the direction can be chosen, perhaps the color can be set to R or B as needed.\n\nBut how does this affect the entire sequence?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building the sequence from left to right. For each cell, after processing the previous cells, apply the necessary stamps to reach the desired color. \n\nFor example:\n\nStarting from the left, for each cell i:\n\n- If the current color is not the desired color, apply a stamp to cells i and i+1, which will set cell i to the desired color and cell i+1 to the opposite.\n\nThis way, each cell is fixed by the previous stamp application, except the last cell, which is affected by the previous stamp. So the last cell's color must match the desired one.\n\nThis approach is similar to the greedy algorithm used in some flipping problems. Let's see.\n\nFor example, take the sequence RBR:\n\nProcessing from left to right:\n\n- Cell 0: desired R. Current is W. Apply stamp to 0 and 1 in RB direction. Now cell 0 is R, cell 1 is B.\n\n- Cell 1: desired B. Current is B. No action.\n\n- Cell 2: desired R. Current is W. Apply stamp to 2 and 3 in RB direction. But the desired is R. So cell 2 becomes R, cell3 B. But cell3 may be beyond the segment (assuming the segment is RBR, which is length 3). Wait, this approach may not work for odd-length segments.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach only works for even-length segments. For example, if the segment is of even length, applying stamps from left to right can fix all cells. But for odd-length segments, the last cell can't be fixed.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nFor a segment of length 3:\n\nDesired: R B R.\n\nProcess:\n\n- Cell 0: R. Apply stamp 0-1 as RB. Now cells 0: R, 1: B.\n\n- Cell 1: B. Correct.\n\n- Cell 2: R. Current is W. Apply stamp 2-3 as RB. But cell 3 is outside the segment (assuming it's part of a larger array). Wait, but in our problem, the segments are separated by W's. So the stamps are applied within the segment. So the segment is contiguous and non-W. So in this case, cell 3 would be W, but the stamp can't be applied to cell 2-3 if cell3 is W. So perhaps this approach is not applicable.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's look for the correct approach in the code.\n\nThe code currently splits the input into pieces separated by W, then for each piece, checks if some condition is met. The code's current variables pr and pb are the first occurrence of R and B in the piece. \n\nThe code checks if (pr == -1 || pb == -1). Because if either pr or pb is -1, that means the piece is all R's or all B's. For example, if pr is -1, then the piece has no R's (all B's), and if pb is -1, then all R's. In either case, the piece is invalid.\n\nSo the condition is: if either pr or pb is -1, then the piece is invalid.\n\nBut wait, the code's current code for the condition is:\n\nif(/* TODO: Your code here */) \n{\n    isbad = 1;\n    break;\n}\n\nSo the code is supposed to set isbad to 1 if the piece is invalid. The current variables pr and pb are the first occurrences of R and B.\n\nSo the condition is that if the piece has no R's (pr == -1) or no B's (pb == -1), then it's invalid.\n\nSo the code should check if (pr == -1 || pb == -1). Because if either is -1, the piece is all B's or all R's, which is invalid.\n\nBut what about the case where the piece has both R and B but is of length 1? For example, \"RB\" is a piece of length 2. That's valid. But a piece of length 1 can't exist, so the code should check for that as well.\n\nWait, the code skips p.Length == 0. For p.Length >=1, the code checks pr and pb. So for a piece of length 1, if it's R or B, then pr or pb would be 0, but the other would be -1. So the condition pr == -1 || pb == -1 would trigger, and set isbad = 1. So that correctly invalidates a piece of length 1.\n\nWait, let's test this. For example, if the piece is \"R\", then pr is 0, pb is -1. So (pr == -1 || pb == -1) evaluates to true. So isbad is set to 1, which is correct. Similarly for \"B\".\n\nFor a piece of length 2, \"RR\": pr is 0, pb is -1. Condition is true. So invalid.\n\nFor \"RB\": pr is 0, pb is 1. Condition is false. So valid.\n\nSo this seems to cover all cases. So the missing code is to check if either pr or pb is -1. If yes, then the piece is invalid.\n\nSo the code should fill the condition as:\n\nif (pr == -1 || pb == -1)\n\nBecause that would mean the piece is all R's or all B's, which is invalid.\n\nBut wait, what about a piece that has both R and B, but in a way that can't be formed by the stamps? For example, \"RRB\" (length 3). The code would check pr=0, pb=2. So the condition is false. So it would be considered valid. But is that correct?\n\nWait, the example \"RRB\" is possible. As shown earlier, applying stamps in a certain way can result in R R B. Wait, no. Let me re-examine:\n\nWait, for a segment \"RRB\", which has length 3, and has R's and B.\n\nIf we apply the following steps:\n\n1. Apply stamp to positions 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W.\n\n2. Apply stamp to positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 R (B becomes R), and W becomes B. So the result is R R B.\n\nYes. So this is possible. So the code's condition would correctly mark this as valid.\n\nAnother example: \"RBRB\" (R B R B). The code checks that there are both R and B, so condition is false. So considered valid. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: \"RBRR\" (R B R R). The code would have pr=0, pb=1. So condition is false. Is this possible?\n\nLet's see:\n\nSteps to create R B R R.\n\nPossible approach:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B R B.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 R (B becomes R), then R becomes B. So cells 1 and 2 become R and B. Wait, the result would be R R B B. Not R B R R.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a different way.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B. So cells 0 is R, 1 is R, 2 is B.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B. Now cells 0: R, 1: R, 2: R, 3: B.\n\nSo the result is R R R B. Not R B R R.\n\nHmm, not helpful. So perhaps \"RBRR\" is impossible. But according to the code's condition, it would be considered valid. So this suggests that the code's condition is insufficient.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, there is a test case where the answer is \"YES\" for \"RBRB\".\n\nWait, the problem's fifth test case has \"BRB\" and the answer is \"YES\". Which is allowed by the code's condition.\n\nSo perhaps the code's condition is correct. Because when the segment has both R and B, and length >=2, then it's possible to create it using stamps.\n\nBut how to explain the RBRR case? Is there a way to create it?\n\nLet's think:\n\nWe need to have R B R R.\n\nSteps:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B. So cells are R R B W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B. Now cells are R R R B.\n\nNot R B R R.\n\nAlternatively, other steps:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 again as BR \u2192 R becomes B, B becomes R. So cells B R W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R. So cells B B R W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R. So cells B B B R.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's impossible. So according to the code's condition, this would be considered valid (since it has both R and B and length 4). But it's not possible. So the code's condition is incorrect.\n\nBut this contradicts our earlier examples. What's wrong here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's condition is correct, but my reasoning is wrong.\n\nLet me think again. How can R B R R be achieved?\n\nThe segment is R B R R. Let's see:\n\nPossible steps:\n\nStart with four white cells.\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B R B.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, R becomes B. Now cells 0: R, 1: R, 2: B, 3: B.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 W W becomes B R.\n\nThen apply stamp to 0-1 as BR \u2192 W W becomes B R.\n\nBut this would give B R B R.\n\nHmm. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R B W.\n\nApply stamp to 3-4 as RB \u2192 W W becomes R B. But the segment is four cells. So after applying to 3-4 (assuming the segment is four cells?), the cells would be R R B R B. Which is five cells. Not applicable.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Perhaps the code's condition is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the condition should also check that the first and last characters are the same or different. Or perhaps that the number of R and B in the segment is even.\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the number of R and B. Since each stamp application adds one R and one B, the total number of R and B must have the same parity. For example, in a segment of length 4, applying two stamps would add two R and two B. So the total R and B counts would be even. But if the segment has three R and one B, which sums to four, even. So that's allowed.\n\nBut in the RBRR case, the counts are three R and one B, sum 4. So parity is even. So that's allowed. But how to create it?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to apply stamps in a way that toggles the colors multiple times.\n\nLet's try again.\n\nTarget: R B R R.\n\nPossible steps:\n\n1. Apply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\n2. Apply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R B W.\n\n3. Apply stamp to 3-4 as BR \u2192 W becomes B and W becomes R. But this is outside the segment (assuming the segment is four cells). \n\nWait, perhaps the segment is R B R R of length four.\n\nWait, no. If the segment is four cells, then the target is R B R R.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Apply to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\n2. Apply to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B R B.\n\n3. Apply to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, R becomes B \u2192 R R B B.\n\n4. Apply to 2-3 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, B becomes R \u2192 R R R R. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nPerhaps the code's condition is not sufficient. So what's the correct condition?\n\nAfter some research, I found that the correct conditions are:\n\n1. Each segment must have length at least 2.\n\n2. Each segment must contain at least one R and at least one B.\n\n3. Additionally, the first and last characters of the segment must be different. \n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the fifth test case is \"BRB\" which has first B and last B. But according to the sample explanation, it's possible. So this condition is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that there exists at least one occurrence of \"RB\" or \"BR\" in the segment. Because that ensures that the colors alternate, allowing the stamps to be applied in a way that builds the segment.\n\nAlternatively, the code's initial condition is correct and the RBRR example is possible, but I'm not seeing how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition is correct and the RBRR example is possible. Let me think of another way to create it.\n\nAnother attempt:\n\nTarget: R B R R.\n\nSteps:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 again as BR \u2192 R becomes B, B becomes R \u2192 B R W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 B B R W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 B B B R.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAnother approach:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R B W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R R B.\n\nNot the target.\n\nHmm. It seems that creating R B R R is not possible. So the code's condition is insufficient. So what's the correct condition?\n\nAnother observation: Each stamp application must be applied to a pair of cells. Each application introduces a pair of R and B. The order can be chosen. But the cumulative effect is that each R and B in the segment must be part of at least one such pair. \n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of the number of R and B must be the same. Because each stamp changes two cells, adding one R and one B. So the total number of R and B must have the same parity. For example, in the RBRR example, there are three R's and one B. Their counts have different parity (3 is odd, 1 is odd. Same parity, sum 4 even). So this is allowed. But how to create it?\n\nWait, in this case, the sum is even, which is allowed. But I'm not seeing how to create the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's condition is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nThe code's condition checks that each segment has at least one R and B. So for a segment to be valid, it must have both. The code's current code would correctly reject segments with only R or only B, and accept those with both. So for the RBRR example, the code would accept it as valid, but it may not be possible. So there's a flaw in the code.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's sample inputs:\n\nSample 5:\n\nInput: 3, \"BRB\" \u2192 output is YES.\n\nSample 6:\n\nInput: 3, \"RBB\" \u2192 output is YES.\n\nSample 7:\n\nInput: 1, \"W\" \u2192 output is YES.\n\nSo in sample 5, the segment is B R B. The code's condition would check for pr and pb. pr is 1 (first R), pb is 0 (first B). So the condition (pr == -1 || pb == -1) is false. So code accepts it. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code's condition seems to work for the samples. But what about the RBRR case?\n\nLet's try to find a way to construct R B R R.\n\nMaybe there's a way:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B R B W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, R becomes B \u2192 R R B B W.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R B W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R R B.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R B W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as BR \u2192 B becomes R, W becomes B \u2192 R R R B.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nSo it seems impossible. But the code's condition would consider it valid. So this suggests that the code's condition is incorrect.\n\nThis indicates that the code's current approach is missing another condition.\n\nBut what is that condition?\n\nAnother observation: For a segment to be valid, there must be at least one occurrence of adjacent R and B (either RB or BR) in the segment. Because each stamp application introduces such a pair, and overlapping applications can't eliminate all such pairs. \n\nWait, but stamps can overwrite previous pairs. For example, applying stamps to the same pair multiple times can toggle between RB and BR. But other pairs can also be applied.\n\nSo if the segment has no adjacent RB or BR, then it's impossible. For example, a segment like R R B B. This has no adjacent RB or BR. Can this be formed?\n\nSteps:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R B R B.\n\nResult is R B R B. Which has RB and BR pairs. So not the desired RRBB. So this is impossible.\n\nSo the code's current condition is not sufficient. So the correct condition must also check that there is at least one pair of adjacent R and B in the segment.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nThe code's current condition is that the segment has at least one R and B (pr != -1 and pb != -1). But this doesn't guarantee that there's an adjacent pair.\n\nFor example, a segment like R W B (but wait, no. The code splits on W's. So the segment is non-W characters. So any segment cannot have W's. So the segment R R B B is allowed by the current condition but may not be possible.\n\nSo, the correct condition must also check that there exists at least two adjacent characters in the segment that are different (i.e., RB or BR). \n\nSo for each segment, the code must check:\n\n- Length >= 2.\n\n- Contains at least one R and one B.\n\n- Contains at least two adjacent characters that are different.\n\nBut how to check this efficiently.\n\nIn code terms:\n\nFor each segment, after checking that pr != -1 and pb != -1 (i.e., contains both R and B), we need to check that there exists at least one index i where s[i] != s[i+1].\n\nSo in the code, for each piece p:\n\nif (p.IndexOf('R') == -1 || p.IndexOf('B') == -1) \u2192 invalid.\n\nelse:\n\nCheck if there exists at least two adjacent characters that are different.\n\nIf not, then invalid.\n\nFor example, the segment \"RRBB\" would have pr = 0, pb = 2. Then, check if any two adjacent characters are different. The first two are R and R \u2192 same. The next two are R and B \u2192 different. So this segment is valid. But according to the example above, it may not be possible to form it. But according to the code's current conditions, it would be considered valid. But how?\n\nWait, \"RRBB\" can be formed as follows:\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 as RB \u2192 R B W W.\n\nApply stamp to 0-1 again as BR \u2192 B R W W.\n\nApply stamp to 1-2 as RB \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 B B R W.\n\nApply stamp to 2-3 as RB \u2192 R becomes B, W becomes R \u2192 B B B R.\n\nNot helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"RRBB\" is not possible, but according to the code's conditions, it would be considered valid.\n\nThis suggests that the code's conditions are not sufficient.\n\nThis is getting very complex. Perhaps the correct approach is to look for the correct answer based on the code provided.\n\nThe code in question has the following structure:\n\nforeach (var p in pieces)\n{\n    if (p is empty) continue;\n    pr = p.IndexOf('R');\n    pb = p.IndexOf('B');\n    if (some condition)\n    {\n        isbad = 1;\n        break;\n    }\n}\n\nThe missing condition is the one that checks whether the piece is invalid.\n\nFrom the problem's sample input and other examples, the correct condition seems to be that the piece has no R or no B. So the code's condition should be if (pr == -1 || pb == -1). \n\nBut earlier examples like \"RBRR\" would be considered valid by this condition but may not be possible.\n\nBut according to the code's structure, the answer is to fill in the condition as (pr == -1 || pb == -1).\n\nBut according to the problem's sample inputs, this condition works.\n\nFor example, the second test case in the problem:\n\nTest case 2: n=1, s=R. The piece is \"R\". pr=0, pb=-1. So condition is true \u2192 invalid \u2192 output NO.\n\nTest case 3: n=1, s=B \u2192 similarly invalid.\n\nTest case 4: n=2, s=RR. pr=0, pb=-1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nTest case 5: n=3, s=BRB. pr=1, pb=0 \u2192 condition is false \u2192 valid.\n\nTest case 6: n=3, s=RBB \u2192 pr=0, pb=1 \u2192 valid.\n\nThus, according to the sample inputs, the code's condition is correct.\n\nSo, the missing code in the condition is:\n\npr == -1 || pb == -1\n\nThus, the code should check if either pr or pb is -1, indicating the piece has no R or no B.\n\nThus, the correct code to fill in is:\n\nif (pr == -1 || pb == -1)"
