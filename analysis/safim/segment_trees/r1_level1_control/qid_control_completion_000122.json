For example, in a test case where the first robot is at (2,3), and another robot is at (1,4), but there's a third robot at (0,5), then the code would check the first robot (2,3), find that the other two robots have j < 2 (the third robot is j=0 < 2), so ret is 0. But the third robot (0,5) is a robot that is already in the first row. However, the third robot's position is (0,5). To reach (0,0), you need to move left 5 times. But any other robot must be in positions y >=5. Which they are not. So in this case, the code would output NO even though the third robot is in row 0, but can't reach (0,0) because others are in lower columns. Hmm. So the code's current approach is to pick the first robot, check if all other robots are in positions j >= cor.x and k >= cor.y. If yes, then output YES. Otherwise, NO. But this approach is incorrect. The correct solution is to check all robots as possible candidates, and if any of them meets the condition that all other robots are in j >= candidate.x and k >= candidate.y, then output YES. Otherwise, NO. But the code provided is structured to check only the first robot. So the code is incomplete.",

So in the code, the first robot is the one that is in the earliest row (smallest x) and earliest column (smallest y) in that row. So the first robot is the leftmost in the topmost row. So for example, if there are robots in (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), then the first robot is (0,3), because the first row is scanned first. Then, the code checks if all other robots have x >= 0 and y >=3. But (1,0) has y=0 <3, so this would set ret=0, and output NO. However, the robot (1,0) could be a candidate. Because if you select (1,0), then all other robots must have x >=1 and y >=0. The robot (0,3) has x=0 <1, which would invalidate it. So the code's approach would output NO, but the correct answer is NO, because any candidate would have some robot in a position that's left or above. Wait, this example is not correct. Let's think of a case where there's a robot in (1,0) and another in (0,3). To move the (1,0) robot to (0,0), we need to move up once. But during that movement, the robot at (0,3) will also move up once, which would take it to x = -1, which is invalid. So in this case, the answer is NO. So the code's approach would correctly output NO because the first robot is (0,3), and the robot (1,0) has j=1 >=0 (x=0), but k=0 <3, so ret=0. So the code would output NO, which is correct. But if there's a robot in (2,2), another in (1,3), then the first robot is (2,2). The other robot has x=1 <2. So ret=0. But the other robot (1,3) can be a candidate. To see if all robots are >=1 in x and >=3 in y. The first robot (2,2) has y=2 <3. So this would not work. So the code's approach correctly outputs NO.",

So perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm not sure. Let's think of a test case where there are two robots: one at (3,3) and another at (2,4). The first robot is (3,3). The code checks if all other robots are in x >=3 and y >=3. The second robot has x=2 <3. So ret=0. But the second robot is at (2,4). Can we select it as a candidate? For it to be a candidate, all other robots must have x >=2 and y >=4. The first robot (3,3) has y=3 <4, so it's invalid. So no candidate exists. So the code's output is correct. Another example: suppose the first robot is at (1,2), and there's another robot at (2,1). The code checks the first robot (1,2). The other robot has x=2 >=1, but y=1 <2. So ret=0. But the second robot (2,1) is a candidate. For it, all other robots must have x >=2 and y >=1. The first robot (1,2) has x=1 <2. So no, so no candidate exists. Code outputs NO. But what if there's a robot at (0,1). Then, the code would check this robot. All other robots must have x >=0 and y >=1. Suppose there's a robot at (0,0) which is already in the target. Then, the code would set ret=1. But the code would also check if any other robot is in a position that's invalid. For example, if there's a robot at (0,0), then in the loop, when j=0 and k=0, the code sets ret=1. Then, other robots are checked. Suppose there's another robot at (0,0). Then, the code would set ret=1. So the code would output YES. So the code's logic is:\n\n- Find the first robot (cor.x, cor.y). - Check if any robot is in (0,0). If yes, then ret is 1.\n\n- For other robots, check if their x is less than cor.x or y less than cor.y.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether there's a way to move the robots such that at least one reaches the upper left corner (0,0) without any robots exploding. So, the key is to check for each robot whether moving it to (0,0) is possible without causing others to go out of bounds during any step of the commands.\n\nHmm, the code provided is in C, and the main part that's missing is the condition inside the if statement where the TODO is. That's the part that checks if any robot would cause the answer to be \"NO\".\n\nWait, the current code's logic is that for each robot, if it's an 'R', then check some condition. If that condition is true, set ret=0 (meaning it's not possible), otherwise ret remains 1. Then, after checking all robots, if ret is 0, output NO else YES.\n\nSo the condition inside the if statement must determine whether this particular robot (j,k) cannot be moved to (0,0) without causing others to have invalid moves. Wait, but maybe the condition is comparing the robot's position with the first found robot (cor.x, cor.y). Because the idea is that all robots must have a path such that, when moving towards (0,0), their positions relative to the upper-left corner don't require any to step out of bounds during the moves.\n\nOh right! The solution approach here is based on the fact that for all robots, their coordinates (x, y) must satisfy x >= some initial robot's x and y >= some initial robot's y. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct approach here is that the minimal required steps for any robot to reach (0,0) is the sum of its row and column (since each step can move one direction). But the problem is that when you issue commands, all robots move in the same direction each step. So, for a robot to reach (0,0), all the moves must be left and up. But other robots might be in positions that if you move left and up enough times to get one to (0,0), other robots would have already gone out of bounds.\n\nAlternatively, the correct condition is that all robots must be to the right and below the upper-left corner robot. Because when you move left and up, the first robot (the one closest to (0,0)) will reach the corner first. Any robot that is in a row above or column to the left would have to move in a direction that takes them out of the grid during some step.\n\nWait, maybe the correct condition is that for a robot to be able to reach (0,0) without others exploding, all other robots must have their x coordinates >= the x-coordinate of the candidate robot, and their y-coordinates >= the candidate's y-coordinate. Because then, when you move up (decrement x) and left (decrement y) enough times, the candidate will reach (0,0), and all others are moving in the same directions but started from positions that are further away, so they won't hit the boundaries. Wait, no. Because maybe after moving up, a robot that's in the same row as the candidate would move up and reach x=0, but then moving left steps would not cause issues.\n\nWait, I remember that the correct approach is to check whether there exists a robot such that all other robots are in positions that are to the right (higher or equal column) and below (higher or equal row) than that robot. Because then, you can move that robot up and left as much as needed, and the other robots, being to the right and below, will also move those directions. For example, if the candidate is at (a,b), then moving left b times and up a times will take it to (0,0). But any other robot (c,d) must have c >= a and d >= b. Otherwise, when moving left and up, those robots would have to move beyond the grid.\n\nWait, for example, if there's a robot at (2,3). To get to (0,0), we need to move up 2 times and left 3 times. Suppose another robot is at (1,4). Then when moving up twice, this robot would move to (1-2= -1, 4) which is invalid, so it would explode. So that's not allowed. So the presence of such a robot (c < a) would make it impossible.\n\nTherefore, the correct condition is: For at least one robot (the candidate), all other robots have x >= candidate.x and y >= candidate.y. Then, moving up and left enough times would move the candidate to (0,0), and the others would move but stay within the grid. Because, for any other robot (c, d), after moving up candidate.x times and left candidate.y times, their positions would be (c - candidate.x, d - candidate.y). Since c >= candidate.x and d >= candidate.y, these are non-negative. Then, after that, the candidate is at (0,0). So that's acceptable.\n\nBut the code in the current solution seems to check for each robot (j,k) whether some condition is true. If that condition is true for any robot, then ret is set to 0 (so the answer is NO). The code's initial approach is to find the first robot (the one stored in cor.x and cor.y), and then check if any other robot is in a position that would violate the required condition.\n\nWait, the code after finding the first robot (cor) then iterates through all robots again, and for each robot (j,k), if it's an R, checks if (j ==0 && k ==0) which makes ret=1, but then checks another condition. The idea is that if any R is not in a position that allows the initial cor to reach (0,0) without explosions, then ret is 0.\n\nSo the missing condition in the code's if statement is checking whether the current robot (j,k) has a position that is \"invalid\" relative to the candidate (cor.x, cor.y). The invalid condition would be when j < cor.x or k < cor.y. Because if any robot is in a position that's to the left (smaller y) or above (smaller x) than the candidate, then when moving up and left, that robot would go out of bounds before the candidate reaches (0,0).\n\nFor example, the candidate is at (a,b). For any other robot (j,k), if j < a (since moving up a steps would require that robot to move up a times, which would be j - a steps. If j < a, then j - a would be negative, leading to it being out of the grid. Similarly for k < b. So if any robot has j < cor.x or k < cor.y, then that robot would explode when moving up cor.x times and left cor.y times.\n\nTherefore, the missing condition is: if (j < cor.x || k < cor.y). So if any robot is in a position where j (row) is less than the candidate's row, or k (column) is less than the candidate's column, then the answer is NO.\n\nBut wait, the candidate is the first robot found. But perhaps there is another robot that is in a better position (closer to (0,0)), which could be the candidate. The code currently only checks the first robot found. So maybe the code is incorrect, but according to the problem's solution, the approach is to check if there exists at least one robot such that all other robots are to the right and below it. The code as written is checking the first robot, but perhaps the correct way is to check all possible robots, and if any of them satisfies that all others are in their right and below, then output YES.\n\nBut the code's current approach is to pick the first robot as the candidate, and then check for all other robots whether any is invalid. If any is invalid, ret is 0. Otherwise, ret is 1, so output YES.\n\nBut this approach would miss cases where there's another robot that could be a candidate. For example, if the first robot is at (3,3), and another robot is at (2,2), then the code would check the first robot and find that the second robot (2,2) has j < 3 and k < 3, so ret would be 0. But if we could choose the second robot as the candidate, then all robots (including the first) must have j >= 2 and k >= 2. Then, moving up 2 and left 2 would bring the second robot to (0,0), and the first robot would be at (3-2=1, 3-2=1), which is valid. Then, we need to check all robots for that candidate.\n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect in that it only checks the first robot. However, given the code's structure, perhaps the problem is in the code, and the correct way is to check all robots as possible candidates. But given that the code is provided and the user needs to fill in the missing part, perhaps the code's logic is to check all robots for a condition relative to the first candidate. But that's not correct.\n\nWait, but the code finds the first robot (using a loop and breaking with goto once the first 'R' is found), and then checks all other robots. So the code is considering the first robot in the grid (from top to bottom, left to right) as the candidate. Then, it checks all robots. If any robot is in a position (j, k) where j < cor.x or k < cor.y, then ret is set to 0, meaning that this candidate is invalid. If all robots are in positions j >= cor.x and k >= cor.y, then it's possible.\n\nBut this approach could miss other candidates. For example, if the first candidate is invalid (due to some robot being in a position j < cor.x or k < cor.y), but another candidate exists where all robots are in j >= c.x and k >= c.y.\n\nSo the code's approach is wrong. It should check all possible candidates (all robots) and see if any of them is such that all other robots are in their bottom-right quadrant. But the code as written checks only the first robot. So the code is incorrect. However, perhaps the problem's test cases are designed such that the first robot is sufficient. But that's unlikely. For example, in a test case where the first robot is at (2,3), and another robot is at (1,4), but there's a third robot at (0,5), then the code would check the first robot (2,3), find that the other two robots have j < 2 (the third robot is j=0 < 2), so ret is 0. But the third robot (0,5) is a robot that is already in the first row. However, the third robot's position is (0,5). To reach (0,0), you need to move left 5 times. But any other robot must be in positions y >=5. Which they are not. So in this case, the code would output NO even though the third robot is in row 0, but can't reach (0,0) because others are in lower columns.\n\nHmm. So the code's current approach is to pick the first robot, check if all other robots are in positions j >= cor.x and k >= cor.y. If yes, then output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut this approach is incorrect. The correct solution is to check all robots as possible candidates, and if any of them meets the condition that all other robots are in j >= candidate.x and k >= candidate.y, then output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut the code provided is structured to check only the first robot. So the code is incomplete. However, the user needs to fill in the missing part. So perhaps the code is written in such a way that the first robot is the one with the minimal x + y, or something, but that's not the case. The first robot is the first encountered in row-major order.\n\nBut in the sample input, for example, in the fifth test case, the sequence requires moving up, left, up. Let's see. Suppose there's a robot that can be the candidate. So the code as written will fail if the first robot is not the right candidate.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample explanation, in the fifth test case, the correct answer is YES. So in that case, the code would have to find a candidate. If the first robot is that candidate, then all other robots must be in j >= candidate.x and k >= candidate.y.\n\nSo the code's approach is flawed. However, perhaps the problem's test cases are constructed in a way that the first robot is the candidate. Or maybe the code is supposed to check all possible robots, but the code structure is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct in some way. Wait, perhaps the code is not looking for the minimal x + y candidate, but any candidate. If the code checks all possible robots, then the answer would be correct. But the code as written only checks the first one.\n\nBut in the code, after finding the first robot, it then checks all robots. If any of them is invalid (j < cor.x or k < cor.y), then ret is 0. So the code is only considering the first robot as a candidate. So if there's another robot that's a valid candidate (all robots are to the right and below), but the first is not, then the code will output NO when it should output YES.\n\nTherefore, the code is incorrect. But the user is to fill in the missing part. So perhaps the code is supposed to check for each robot whether it's the candidate. But given the code's structure, the code only checks the first robot. Therefore, the code is incorrect. However, the problem says to complete the code so that the program will run correctly. So the missing code may not be the entire solution, but just the condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is not to check all robots, but to find the candidate robot which is the leftmost and topmost possible. For example, the candidate is the robot with the smallest x and then smallest y. Because that would be the minimal possible candidate, and if that candidate can't be used, then no other can. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is to find the robot that is the leftmost (smallest y) in the uppermost row (smallest x). Because if there's a robot in (0,0), then we output YES immediately. Otherwise, the candidate is the robot that is in the leftmost column of the top row possible. Then, moving left and up would be required.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is to check if there exists any robot such that all other robots are to the right and below it. But the code is only checking one candidate, the first robot. So this approach would work only if the first robot is the one that is the uppermost and leftmost. Because then, any robot to the left or above would not exist.\n\nWait, the first robot is found by scanning row by row and left to right. So in the code, the first robot is the one that is in the earliest row (smallest x) and earliest column (smallest y) in that row. So the first robot is the leftmost in the topmost row. So for example, if there are robots in (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), then the first robot is (0,3), because the first row is scanned first. Then, the code checks if all other robots have x >= 0 and y >=3. But (1,0) has y=0 <3, so this would set ret=0, and output NO. However, the robot (1,0) could be a candidate. Because if you select (1,0), then all other robots must have x >=1 and y >=0. The robot (0,3) has x=0 <1, which would invalidate it. So the code's approach would output NO, but the correct answer is NO, because any candidate would have some robot in a position that's left or above.\n\nWait, this example is not correct. Let's think of a case where there's a robot in (1,0) and another in (0,3). To move the (1,0) robot to (0,0), we need to move up once. But during that movement, the robot at (0,3) will also move up once, which would take it to x = -1, which is invalid. So in this case, the answer is NO. So the code's approach would correctly output NO because the first robot is (0,3), and the robot (1,0) has j=1 >=0 (x=0), but k=0 <3, so ret=0. So the code would output NO, which is correct.\n\nBut if there's a robot in (2,2), another in (1,3), then the first robot is (2,2). The other robot has x=1 <2. So ret=0. But the other robot (1,3) can be a candidate. To see if all robots are >=1 in x and >=3 in y. The first robot (2,2) has y=2 <3. So this would not work. So the code's approach correctly outputs NO. Because there is no candidate where all other robots are to the right and below.\n\nSo perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm not sure. Let's think of a test case where there are two robots: one at (3,3) and another at (2,4). The first robot is (3,3). The code checks if all other robots are in x >=3 and y >=3. The second robot has x=2 <3. So ret=0. But the second robot is at (2,4). Can we select it as a candidate? For it to be a candidate, all other robots must have x >=2 and y >=4. The first robot (3,3) has y=3 <4, so it's invalid. So no candidate exists. So the code's output is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose the first robot is at (1,2), and there's another robot at (2,1). The code checks the first robot (1,2). The other robot has x=2 >=1, but y=1 <2. So ret=0. But the second robot (2,1) is a candidate. For it, all other robots must have x >=2 and y >=1. The first robot (1,2) has x=1 <2. So no, so no candidate exists. Code outputs NO.\n\nBut what if there's a robot at (0,1). Then, the code would check this robot. All other robots must have x >=0 and y >=1. Suppose there's a robot at (0,0) which is already in the target. Then, the code would set ret=1. But the code would also check if any other robot is in a position that's invalid. For example, if there's a robot at (0,0), then in the loop, when j=0 and k=0, the code sets ret=1. Then, other robots are checked. Suppose there's another robot at (0,0). Then, the code would set ret=1. So the code would output YES.\n\nSo the code's logic is:\n\n- Find the first robot (cor.x, cor.y).\n\n- Check if any robot is in (0,0). If yes, then ret is 1.\n\n- For other robots, check if their x is less than cor.x or y less than cor.y. If any such robot exists, ret is 0.\n\nSo the code is assuming that the first robot is the candidate, and if any robot is to the left or above it, then it's impossible. Otherwise, it's possible.\n\nBut this is only correct if the first robot is the one that is the minimal in x and y. Because the first robot is found by scanning the grid row-wise, left to right. So the first robot is the one in the earliest possible row (smallest x), and in that row, the earliest column (smallest y). So it's the leftmost robot in the topmost row.\n\nIn this case, if there's any robot to the left or above the first robot, then there can be no candidate. Because any candidate must have x <= all robots' x and y <= all robots' y. But if the first robot is the topmost, then any robot in a higher row (x smaller) can't exist. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the first robot is the first found in row-major order, which is the topmost row and then leftmost in that row. So any robot with x < cor.x is impossible (since in row-major order, the first robot is in the first row with an 'R').\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose the grid is:\n\nRow 0: E E R\n\nRow 1: R E E\n\nThe first robot is at (0, 2). But there's a robot at (1,0). Then, the code would check if any robot is left or above (0,2). The robot at (1,0) has x=1 >=0 (so x is okay) but y=0 <2, so the code would set ret=0, outputting NO. But is there a way to move robots to (0,0) without explosions?\n\nFor example, the robot at (0,2) can be moved left twice to (0,0). The other robot at (1,0) would need to move left twice, but after each move:\n\nFirst move left: (1,0) becomes (1,-1), which is invalid. So this case would output NO, which is correct.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct here.\n\nAnother example where the code would fail:\n\nSuppose the first robot is at (2,3), but there's a robot at (1,4). The code checks for all robots. The robot (1,4) has x=1 <2 (cor.x=2). So ret=0. But there's another robot at (0,5). But the first robot is (2,3). The code outputs NO, but perhaps the robot at (0,5) can be a candidate.\n\nWait, robot at (0,5): to reach (0,0), we need to move left 5 times. Other robots: (2,3) and (1,4).\n\nWhen moving left 5 times, the robot (2,3) would move left 5 times. Its y is 3-5= -2, which is invalid. So the code's output of NO is correct.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nAnother test case: two robots. One at (0,2) and another at (1,1). The first robot is (0,2). The other robot's y=1 <2. So code outputs NO. But the robot at (1,1) is a candidate. For that, all robots must have x >=1 and y >=1. The other robot (0,2) has x=0 <1. So no candidate exists. So code is correct.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct. Because the first robot is the earliest possible candidate (topmost, leftmost). If any robot is to the left or above it, then it's impossible. Otherwise, moving the first robot left and up to (0,0) will not cause any other robot to explode.\n\nSo the missing condition in the code's if statement is:\n\nif (j < cor.x || k < cor.y)\n\nThat is, if the current robot's x is less than the candidate's x or its y is less than the candidate's y, then ret=0.\n\nSo the code will check all robots. If any of them is in a position to the left or above the first robot, then output is NO. Otherwise, YES.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nj < cor.x || k < cor.y\n\nSo the code should fill in that condition.\n\nLet's check the sample test case 5:\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n1\n\n3 4\n\nR E E E\n\nE E E E\n\nE E E R\n\nThe first robot is at (0,0) (since the first cell is R). So the code checks for all other robots. The other robot is at (2,3). For this robot, j=2 >=0 and k=3 >=0, so condition is not met. So ret remains 1. So code outputs YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample explanation.\n\nAnother sample: test case 6. According to the explanation, the answer is NO. The code would check the first robot. Suppose it's the robot that's not in a position that allows all others to be in the right and below. For example, in test case 6, there are two robots: one at (0,1) and another at (1,0). The first robot is (0,1). The other robot is at (1,0). For this robot, j=1 >=0 (okay), but k=0 <1. So ret=0. Output NO.\n\nSo the code's logic works.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is j < cor.x || k < cor.y."
