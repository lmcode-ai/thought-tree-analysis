Hmm. So, the key is to find out if the parity differences can be resolved through these operations. Let's think about how the operations affect the parities. Each operation of type 1 (add to odd indices) will change the parity of elements at positions 1, 3, 5, etc. Similarly, type 2 affects even positions. But each operation can be applied any number of times. However, each application of a type toggles the parity of those positions. Because adding 1 flips even to odd and vice versa.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine if after performing any number of operations (add 1 to all odd indices or even indices), we can make all elements of the array have the same parity\u2014either all even or all odd. Hmm.\n\nSo, the key is to find out if the parity differences can be resolved through these operations. Let's think about how the operations affect the parities.\n\nEach operation of type 1 (add to odd indices) will change the parity of elements at positions 1, 3, 5, etc. Similarly, type 2 affects even positions. But each operation can be applied any number of times. However, each application of a type toggles the parity of those positions. Because adding 1 flips even to odd and vice versa. So, applying an even number of times of a type cancels out, and applying it once is the same as any odd number of times.\n\nWait, right. Because adding 1 once changes parity; adding again (so total two times) brings it back. So the parity changes only if the number of operations of that type is odd. So for each type (even or odd indices), applying it once is equivalent to toggling the parity of those indices.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to whether there's a way to choose some combination of even and odd operations such that all elements end up with the same parity.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about the parity of each element after applying x operations of type 1 and y operations of type 2. Let x be the number of times we apply type 1 (odd indices) and y the times for type 2 (even indices). Since each x and y can be 0 or 1 (since even applications don't change anything), we can check all possibilities.\n\nWait, because applying an even number of type 1 operations is the same as not applying it. So for each type, we can choose to apply it an even or odd number of times. So for x and y, each can be 0 or 1 (mod 2). So there are 4 possible combinations to check.\n\nBut maybe there's a pattern. Let's see. Let's consider each element's parity in the original array. Then, for each element, after applying x and y operations (each 0 or 1), what's the parity?\n\nFor element at position i:\n\nIf i is odd: its parity is (original_parity) + x (since each x operation adds 1, and x is mod 2).\n\nIf i is even: its parity is original_parity + y (mod 2).\n\nSo for each element, the final parity is original_parity ^ (x if odd, y if even).\n\nWe need all elements to have the same parity. So either all are even (parity 0) or all are odd (parity 1). So, for each of the four possible (x, y) pairs (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)), we can check if applying that x and y would make all elements have the same parity.\n\nIf any of these four possibilities works, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where the parities of elements must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, let's consider the required parity for all elements. Suppose after operations, all elements are even. Then:\n\nFor odd indices: original parity + x must be even. So original_parity + x must be even. So x must equal original_parity. Because original_parity (0 or 1) + x (0 or 1) mod 2 must be 0. So x = original_parity.\n\nBut wait, for odd indices, x is the number of times we applied type 1 operations (mod 2). So for each odd index i, the parity after applying x is (a_i's parity + x) mod 2. For this to be even (0), x must be equal to a_i's parity. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf a_i is even (0), then x must be 0 \u2192 (0 + x) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 x must be even, i.e., 0 mod 2. So x can be 0.\n\nIf a_i is odd (1), then x must be 1 \u2192 (1 + x) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 x must be 1.\n\nSo for all odd indices, x must be the same as their original parity mod 2. But this x is the same for all odd indices. So, for all odd indices, their original parities must be the same. Because if two odd indices have different parities, then x would have to be 0 for one and 1 for the other, which is impossible.\n\nWait, that's a problem. For example, if there's an odd index with parity 0 and another with parity 1, then x can't be both 0 and 1. So in that case, it's impossible to have all elements even. Similarly for making all elements odd.\n\nSo, for all elements to end up even, after applying x and y operations:\n\nFor even indices: original_parity + y must be even. So y must equal original_parity.\n\nFor even indices, all original parities must be the same, otherwise y can't satisfy both.\n\nSimilarly, for odd indices, all original parities must be the same.\n\nWait, but the same x and y are applied to all elements. So, for example, for all odd indices, their original parities must be the same modulo x. Because x can be either 0 or 1. So for the case where we want all elements even:\n\nx must equal the parity of the first element (if it's odd index), but if other odd indices have different parities, then x can't satisfy all. So, all odd indices must have the same parity, and all even indices must have the same parity. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nBut this is only for the case of making all even. Similarly for making all odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as:\n\nFor the array to be possible to have all elements even or all elements odd, the following must hold:\n\nEither:\n\nAll elements at even indices have the same parity, and all elements at odd indices have the same parity. Then, by applying x and y (0 or 1), you can adjust the parities to match.\n\nOr:\n\nAnother condition. Hmm.\n\nWait, let's think of two possibilities for the desired parity:\n\nCase 1: All elements are even.\n\nFor this to be possible:\n\nFor each odd index i, original_parity[i] + x must be even \u2192 x must be equal to original_parity[i].\n\nBut x is the same for all odd indices. So all original_parity of odd indices must be the same. Similarly, for even indices, original_parity[i] + y must be even \u2192 y must equal original_parity[i], so all even indices must have the same parity.\n\nCase 2: All elements are odd.\n\nThen, for odd indices: original_parity[i] + x must be odd \u2192 x must be different from original_parity[i] (mod 2). So x = 1 - original_parity[i]. So all odd indices must have the same parity (because x is same for all of them). Similarly, for even indices: original_parity[i] + y must be odd \u2192 y = 1 - original_parity[i]. So all even indices must have same parity.\n\nSo, for the array to be possible, either:\n\nOption 1: All even indices have same parity, and all odd indices have same parity. Then, by choosing x and y accordingly, you can make all even (x = parity of odd indices, y = parity of even indices) or all odd (x = 1 - parity of odd indices, y = 1 - parity of even indices).\n\nAlternatively, maybe even indices can have any parity as long as they are same among themselves, and same for odd.\n\nSo, the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\nCheck two possibilities:\n\nA) All even indices have the same parity, and all odd indices have the same parity. Then possible.\n\nB) Wait, maybe even that's not enough, but the way the operations work allows us to adjust.\n\nWait, suppose all odd indices have the same parity (say p) and even indices have the same parity (q). Then, by choosing x and y, we can adjust:\n\nIf we want all even:\n\nSet x = p (so odd indices become even), and y = q (even indices become even). Then, all elements will be even.\n\nIf we want all odd:\n\nSet x = 1 - p (so odd indices' parity flips), and y = 1 - q (even indices' parity flips). Then, all elements are odd.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is YES.\n\nSo the condition is that all even indices have the same parity and all odd indices have the same parity.\n\nIf that's the case, then answer is YES. Otherwise, answer is NO.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether:\n\nFor the array, all elements in even positions (indices 2,4,6...) have the same parity, and all elements in odd positions (indices 1,3,5...) have the same parity.\n\nIf that's true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but let's test the examples.\n\nFirst example in the note:\n\nInput array: 1 2 1\n\nOdd indices (1 and 3) have parities 1%2=1 and 1%2=1. Even index (2) has 2%2=0. So even indices (only one) have parity 0, odd have 1. So condition holds. So answer is YES.\n\nSecond example:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput array: 2 2 2 3.\n\nSo even indices are 2 and 4. 2%2=0, 3%2=1. So even indices have parities 0 and 1. So condition fails. So answer is NO.\n\nThird example:\n\nAll elements even. So even and odd indices all have parity 0. So condition holds. YES.\n\nFourth example:\n\nArray is 1000 0 1000 0 1000. Even indices (0,0) \u2192 parity 0. Odd indices (1000, 1000, 1000) \u2192 parity 0. So even indices are 0, odd are 0. So condition holds. Applying x=1 (odd indices add 1), so their parity becomes 1. All elements become 1001, 0, 1001, 0, 1001. Then after adding 1 to even indices (y=1), even positions become 1. So all elements would be 1001,1,1001,1,1001 (all odd). Wait, but in the example, they applied only one operation (type 1), which adds 1 to all odd indices, making the array [1001, 0, 1001, 0, 1001]. All odd and even elements here: even elements are 0 (even indices) \u2192 parity 0, odd indices are 1001 (parity 1). So if you apply x=1 (add to odd indices) once, you get odd indices 0\u21921000+1=1001 (parity 1), even indices 0 (parity 0). Wait, but that would leave even indices as even. So how does that make all elements odd?\n\nWait the fourth example's input is 1000 0 1000 0 1000. The desired outcome after one operation (type 1) is 1001, 0, 1001, 0, 1001. Now, the even indices are 0, which are even. But the answer says that after this operation, all elements are odd. Wait, this contradicts. Oh wait, no: the example says that after performing one operation of type 1, the array becomes [1001, 0, 1001, 0, 1001]. Then, the even indices (positions 2 and 4) are 0, which is even, but the answer says all elements become odd. Wait, that's impossible. Oh, wait, perhaps the example is correct. Wait, the example's note says that after performing one operation of type 1 (adding 1 to odd indices), the array becomes [1001, 0, 1001, 0, 1001]. Then all elements are odd? Wait 1001 is odd (correct), 0 is even. So how does that make all elements odd? That's impossible. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the example. Let me check the fourth example note again. Oh, the fourth test case says after performing one operation of increasing all elements at odd positions, the array becomes [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001]. Wait no, the example says:\n\n\"For the fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all elements at odd positions by 1, thus obtaining the array [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001]\"\n\nWait, original array is 1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000.\n\nAfter adding 1 to odd indices (positions 1,3,5), the array becomes 1001 (1), 0 (even), 1001 (3), 0 (4), 1001 (5). Wait, but the even indices (positions 2 and 4) are 0 and 0. So they are even, but the note says after this operation, all elements are odd. That's impossible. So perhaps the example is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding the operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the original array is different. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nAh, in the fourth test case: the original array is [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. Then, after one operation of adding 1 to all odd positions, the array becomes [1001, 0, 1001, 0, 1001]. The note says all elements become odd, which is not the case. So there's a mistake here. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the note says that the answer is \"YES\". So perhaps the actual array in the fourth test case is different. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the fourth test case's array after the operation is [1001, 0, 1001, 0, 1001], which has even elements at even indices (0 is even). So how is the answer \"YES\"?\n\nAh, maybe there's another operation. For example, after the first operation (adding to odd indices), then perform another operation of adding to even indices. Let's see:\n\nAfter first operation (x=1, y=0):\n\narray is [1001, 0, 1001, 0, 1001].\n\nThen, perform adding to even indices once (y=1):\n\narray becomes [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001]. Now, all elements are odd. So by performing two operations (type 1 once, type 2 once), we get all elements odd.\n\nAh! So the example is possible. So in this case, the original array's even indices are 0 and 0 (parity 0). So even indices all have same parity (0). Odd indices have 1000 (parity 0). So all even indices have parity 0, all odd indices parity 0. So according to the condition I mentioned earlier, the answer is YES. So the code needs to check whether all even indices have same parity, and all odd indices have same parity.\n\nSo, the code can check for each even position and odd position. For even positions, check that all have the same parity as the first even element. Similarly for odd positions.\n\nSo in the code, the missing part is a loop that checks for all i in 1..n-2, and compares the parity of i-th element with i+2-th element. Because elements must have the same parity as their next element two steps away (i.e., same parity as elements in same position parity).\n\nWait, the loop in the code is for i from 1 to n-2. So for each i up to n-2, check if val[i] and val[i+2] have the same parity. If any pair differs, then flag becomes false.\n\nBecause the even indices are 2,4,6..., which are i=2, 4, etc. So for i=2, check i+2=4. Similarly, for i=1 (odd), check i+2=3, which is also odd.\n\nWait, the indices in the code are starting from 1. So for even indices (i even), check if val[i] and val[i+2] have same parity. For odd indices (i odd), check val[i] and val[i+2] have same parity. But the loop is from i=1 to n-2. So for each i from 1 to n-2, we check if val[i] and val[i+2] have the same parity. Because if all the elements in even indices have same parity, then for every even index i, val[i] and val[i+2] must have same parity. Similarly for odd indices.\n\nSo the code's loop is:\n\nfor (i from 1 to n-2)\n\n   if (val[i] % 2 != val[i+2] %2) then flag = false.\n\nSo the missing condition is (val[i] % 2) != (val[i+2] %2). If any such i exists where the parity is different between val[i] and val[i+2], then it's impossible, and the answer is NO.\n\nYes. So the code's missing line is:\n\nif ((val[i] % 2) != (val[i+2] % 2)) flag = false;\n\nSo, the code checks for all consecutive elements of the same parity (odd or even indices) whether they have the same parity. If any pair doesn't, then the answer is no.\n\nSo the missing code in the for loop is:\n\nif (val[i] % 2 != val[i+2] % 2) flag = false;\n\nWhich would be written as:\n\nif( (val[i]%2) != (val[i+2]%2) ) flag = false;\n\nThat's the condition that must be checked for each i in the loop."
