The order of checks is: if tmp <=1399 \u2192 division4\nelse if tmp <=1599 \u2192 division3 (so this is 1400-1599) Then the next else if is for division2.

Or maybe since the code is structured with else ifs, after checking division3 (<=1599), the next check is else if (tmp <=1899), which would include 1600-1899. Because after division3 is handled, any tmp that reaches the next condition must be >=1600. So if the next else if checks if tmp <=1899, then that covers 1600-1899, which is division2. Then the else would be anything higher (1900+), which is division1. So the missing condition should be tmp <=1899. Let me test that logic. For example, if tmp is 1600, after the first two conditions are false (since 1600>1599), then the else if checks if tmp <=1899 \u2192 yes, so division2. If tmp is 1899 \u2192 yes.",
