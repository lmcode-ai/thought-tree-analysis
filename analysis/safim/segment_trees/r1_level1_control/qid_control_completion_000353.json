Or perhaps, since each block can be used in any row. Wait, no. Each block is a physical object that can be placed in exactly one row. So the sum of the lengths in each row must be >= s. But the total sum is the sum of all rows' sums, which must be >= s * s (since there are s rows each contributing at least s). But since the sum is exactly the total of all selected blocks' lengths, the total sum must be >= s*s. So the maximum s is the largest integer where the total possible sum of all blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2. Because if the sum of all possible blocks is S, then the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that s\u00b2 <= S. Because even if all blocks are used, the sum S can form a square of s where s\u00b2 <= S. So the problem reduces to compute the sum of all the lengths of the blocks from 1 to n, and then find the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= sum. Wait, but this can't be right. For example, in the sample input given, when n=5, what is the sum of the blocks? The blocks are 1,1,2,2,3. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. So s\u00b2=9, s=3. Which matches the sample output. So that's correct. So for n=5, the sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So s is 3. Another test case: n=1. The sum is 1, so s=1.\n\nn=2: sum is 1+1=2. The maximum s is 1, since 1\u00b2=1 <= 2. So output 1. Wait, but according to the code that's given in the initial code, for the case where n is even, s is n/2. Let's see. For n=5, which is odd, s is (5/2) +1, which is 3. Which matches. For n=4 (even), s=4/2=2. The sum of the blocks when n=4 is 1+1+2+2=6. So s\u00b2=4, which is 2\u00b2=4 <=6, so maximum s is 2. But wait, 6 is larger than 4. Could we have a larger s? Let's check.",

Wait, but what if n=5, sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So the code outputs 3, which is correct. Another example: n=6. The blocks would be 1,1,2,2,3,3. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3=12. So sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so maximum s is 3. The code for n=6 (even) would compute s as 6/2 =3, which is correct. Hmm. So the code's current approach is to output s = (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe code in the initial code is:\n\nlong s = n%2==0?n/2:n/2 +1;\n\nWhich for even n, s is n/2. For odd n, s is (n/2) +1. Which is equivalent to (n+1)/2. So for example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. For n=6, 6/2=3. But according to the examples, this gives the correct answer. And in the sample where n=5, the sum is 9, s=3, which is correct. But how does this relate to the actual sum of the blocks? Let's see: the sum of the blocks from 1 to n.\n\nEach block i contributes ceil(i/2). Let's compute the sum S for a general n.\n\nLet me split into even and odd n.\n\nIf n is even: n=2k. Then for i from 1 to 2k:\n\nceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, ..., ceil(2k-1/2) = k, ceil(2k/2)=k. So sum is (1+1)+(2+2)+...+(k +k) = 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1). But k = n/2. So sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4 = n(n+2)/4. If n is odd: n=2k+1. Then i from 1 to 2k+1:\n\nsum for first 2k terms is same as above (k*(k+1)), and the last term is ceil((2k+1)/2)=k+1. So total sum is k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. Since n=2k+1, k = (n-1)/2. So sum is ( (n-1)/2 +1 )^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2. So for even n: sum S = (n/2)(n/2 +1) = (n(n+2))/4. For odd n: sum S = ((n+1)/2)^2. So the sum S can be written as:\n\nif n is even: S = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4. if n is odd: S = ((n+1)/2)^2. Now, the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S.\n\nSo for even n:\n\ns\u00b2 <= (n\u00b2 + 2n)/4 \u2192 s \u2264 sqrt((n\u00b2 + 2n)/4) = (n * sqrt(1 + 2/n )) / 2. But for large n, this is approximately n/2, which is the code's current approach. Wait, let's compute s for even n:\n\nThe sum S is (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = (k)(k+1) where k = n/2. So S = k(k+1) = k\u00b2 +k. The maximum s is the floor of the square root of S. So s^2 <= k(k+1). What's the floor of sqrt(k(k+1))? Note that k^2 < k(k+1) < (k+0.5)^2. Let's see: (k+0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+0.5. So the floor is k.\n\nWait, for example, k=3: 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so floor is 3. Which is k=3. So for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2. Wait, but 3*4=12, s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So yes. So for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2. Because s\u00b2 = k\u00b2 <= k(k+1) = sum. Similarly, for odd n, S = ((n+1)/2)^2. So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Because s squared is exactly ((n+1)/2)^2 = S. So in this case, the maximum s is (n+1)/2. So in both cases, the code's initial approach of outputting s = (n+1)/2 (rounded up when n is odd) is correct. Wait, let's see for even n=6:\n\nsum S is (6/2)*(6/2 +1) =3*4=12. The maximum s is floor(sqrt(12))=3. Which equals n/2=3. So correct. For even n=4: sum is 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449 \u2192 floor is 2, which is 4/2=2. Correct. For even n=2: sum is 1*2=2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414 \u2192 floor 1. Which is 2/2=1. Correct. For odd n=5: sum is ((5+1)/2)^2=3^2=9. s=3. For n=3: sum is ((3+1)/2)^2 =2\u00b2=4. s=2. So the code is correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the maximum side length of a square that can be made using certain blocks. The blocks have specific lengths based on their indices, and each is 1 unit high. So, the goal is to arrange some of them (without rotation) into a square. \n\nLet me read the problem statement again to make sure I understand. Each block i has a length of ceil(i/2). So for example, block 1 is ceil(1/2)=1, block 2 is ceil(2/2)=1, block 3 is ceil(3/2)=2, and so on. The square's area must be the sum of the lengths of the blocks (since each contributes 1 unit height, when stacked vertically, but arranged horizontally, their lengths sum up to form the side of the square). Wait, no. Wait, the blocks are placed horizontally to form the square. Each block is 1 unit high. So to form a square of side s, the total area is s*s. Each block contributes 1 (height) * length. So the sum of all the lengths of the blocks used must be at least s^2, but since they are arranged in rows of 1 unit height, each row can contribute some length. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the square's area is s\u00b2. Each block is 1 unit high. So each block can be part of a row. Each row's total length (sum of the lengths of the blocks in that row) must be at least s. Wait, no. Because the square has s rows (each 1 unit high), and each row needs to have a length of s. So each row is formed by some blocks arranged horizontally, their lengths adding up to s. So for each row, the sum of the lengths of the blocks used in that row must be >= s. But since we want exactly s units for each row, maybe the sum needs to be exactly s. But how the blocks are used here is a bit unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that all the blocks are arranged in such a way that their total sum (the sum of their lengths) must be at least s\u00b2, and each block is used in a row. So the sum of the lengths of all selected blocks must be >= s\u00b2. Because each row contributes 1 unit height, and the total height is s. So s rows, each contributing to the length. So the total sum of the lengths of the blocks is the sum of each row's sum. For a square, each row's sum must be >= s. But since all rows combined must form a square of s x s, the total sum is s multiplied by the number of rows. Wait, perhaps the total sum of all the blocks' lengths is the area of the square, which is s\u00b2. Because each block contributes 1xlength, so the total area of all blocks used is the sum of their lengths. To form a square of side s, the sum must be exactly s\u00b2. So the problem reduces to finding the largest s where the sum of some subset of the blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2.\n\nWait, but the square is formed by arranging the blocks in such a way that each row's total length is s, and there are s rows. Each block is placed in a row, and contributes its length to that row. So the sum of all selected blocks' lengths must be exactly s * s (since each of the s rows contributes s length). Therefore, the maximum s is the largest integer such that the sum of the lengths of some subset of the blocks is >= s\u00b2.\n\nBut the problem allows us to not use all the blocks. So we need to select a subset of blocks whose sum of lengths is at least s\u00b2, and find the maximum possible s.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given the sequence of lengths (ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n), what's the maximum s such that the sum of some subset of these lengths is >= s\u00b2.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum s efficiently, especially since n can be up to 1e9?\n\nWait, but the problem is not about selecting a subset (since all blocks are 1xlength, and you can use any number of them as long as their sum in each row is s). Or perhaps, since each block can be used in any row. Wait, no. Each block is a physical object that can be placed in exactly one row. So the sum of the lengths in each row must be >= s. But the total sum is the sum of all rows' sums, which must be >= s * s (since there are s rows each contributing at least s). But since the sum is exactly the total of all selected blocks' lengths, the total sum must be >= s*s. So the maximum s is the largest integer where the total possible sum of all blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2. Because if the sum of all possible blocks is S, then the maximum possible s is the largest integer such that s\u00b2 <= S. Because even if all blocks are used, the sum S can form a square of s where s\u00b2 <= S. So the problem reduces to compute the sum of all the lengths of the blocks from 1 to n, and then find the largest s such that s\u00b2 <= sum.\n\nWait, but this can't be right. For example, in the sample input given, when n=5, what is the sum of the blocks?\n\nThe blocks are 1,1,2,2,3. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3=9. So s\u00b2=9, s=3. Which matches the sample output. So that's correct. So for n=5, the sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So s is 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=1. The sum is 1, so s=1.\n\nn=2: sum is 1+1=2. The maximum s is 1, since 1\u00b2=1 <= 2. So output 1.\n\nWait, but according to the code that's given in the initial code, for the case where n is even, s is n/2. Let's see. For n=5, which is odd, s is (5/2) +1, which is 3. Which matches. For n=4 (even), s=4/2=2. The sum of the blocks when n=4 is 1+1+2+2=6. So s\u00b2=4, which is 2\u00b2=4 <=6, so maximum s is 2. But wait, 6 is larger than 4. Could we have a larger s? Let's check. sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so the integer part is 2. So maximum s is 2. So the code's output would be correct here. \n\nWait, but what if n=5, sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. So the code outputs 3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. The blocks would be 1,1,2,2,3,3. Sum is 1+1+2+2+3+3=12. So sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so maximum s is 3. The code for n=6 (even) would compute s as 6/2 =3, which is correct.\n\nHmm. So the code's current approach is to output s = (n+1)/2 when n is odd, and n/2 when even. Wait, let's see:\n\nThe code in the initial code is:\n\nlong s = n%2==0?n/2:n/2 +1;\n\nWhich for even n, s is n/2. For odd n, s is (n/2) +1. Which is equivalent to (n+1)/2.\n\nSo for example, n=5: (5+1)/2=3. For n=6, 6/2=3.\n\nBut according to the examples, this gives the correct answer. And in the sample where n=5, the sum is 9, s=3, which is correct.\n\nBut how does this relate to the actual sum of the blocks? Let's see: the sum of the blocks from 1 to n.\n\nEach block i contributes ceil(i/2). Let's compute the sum S for a general n.\n\nLet me split into even and odd n.\n\nIf n is even: n=2k. Then for i from 1 to 2k:\n\nceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, ceil(4/2)=2, ..., ceil(2k-1/2) = k, ceil(2k/2)=k.\n\nSo sum is (1+1)+(2+2)+...+(k +k) = 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) = k(k+1).\n\nBut k = n/2. So sum is (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4 = n(n+2)/4.\n\nIf n is odd: n=2k+1. Then i from 1 to 2k+1:\n\nsum for first 2k terms is same as above (k*(k+1)), and the last term is ceil((2k+1)/2)=k+1. So total sum is k(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. Since n=2k+1, k = (n-1)/2. So sum is ( (n-1)/2 +1 )^2 = ( (n+1)/2 )^2.\n\nSo for even n: sum S = (n/2)(n/2 +1) = (n(n+2))/4.\n\nFor odd n: sum S = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nSo the sum S can be written as:\n\nif n is even: S = (n/2) * (n/2 +1) = (n^2 + 2n)/4.\n\nif n is odd: S = ((n+1)/2)^2.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the maximum s such that s\u00b2 <= S.\n\nSo for even n:\n\ns\u00b2 <= (n\u00b2 + 2n)/4 \u2192 s \u2264 sqrt((n\u00b2 + 2n)/4) = (n * sqrt(1 + 2/n )) / 2.\n\nBut for large n, this is approximately n/2, which is the code's current approach.\n\nWait, let's compute s for even n:\n\nThe sum S is (n/2)*(n/2 +1) = (k)(k+1) where k = n/2. So S = k(k+1) = k\u00b2 +k. The maximum s is the floor of the square root of S. So s^2 <= k(k+1). What's the floor of sqrt(k(k+1))?\n\nNote that k^2 < k(k+1) < (k+0.5)^2. Let's see: (k+0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+0.5. So the floor is k.\n\nWait, for example, k=3: 3*4=12. sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so floor is 3. Which is k=3.\n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2.\n\nWait, but 3*4=12, s=3. 3\u00b2=9 <=12. So yes. So for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2. Because s\u00b2 = k\u00b2 <= k(k+1) = sum.\n\nSimilarly, for odd n, S = ((n+1)/2)^2. So the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Because s squared is exactly ((n+1)/2)^2 = S. So in this case, the maximum s is (n+1)/2.\n\nSo in both cases, the code's initial approach of outputting s = (n+1)/2 (rounded up when n is odd) is correct.\n\nWait, let's see for even n=6:\n\nsum S is (6/2)*(6/2 +1) =3*4=12. The maximum s is floor(sqrt(12))=3. Which equals n/2=3. So correct.\n\nFor even n=4: sum is 2*3=6. sqrt(6)=~2.449 \u2192 floor is 2, which is 4/2=2. Correct.\n\nFor even n=2: sum is 1*2=2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414 \u2192 floor 1. Which is 2/2=1. Correct.\n\nFor odd n=5: sum is ((5+1)/2)^2=3^2=9. s=3.\n\nFor n=3: sum is ((3+1)/2)^2 =2\u00b2=4. s=2.\n\nSo the code is correct. The initial code's calculation of s is indeed the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, what if the sum S is such that even after the code's calculation, there's a larger s possible? Let's think for some cases.\n\nTake n=7 (odd). sum S is ((7+1)/2)^2=4\u00b2=16. s=4. That's correct.\n\nn=8 (even). sum is (8/2)*(8/2 +1) =4*5=20. s^2 must be <=20. sqrt(20)=4.472 \u2192 floor is 4. Which is 8/2=4. Correct.\n\nSo in all cases, the code's calculation of s is the correct answer.\n\nSo the code is correct as is. But the original code in the problem has commented lines that seem to suggest that there's a different approach. Let me look at the code again.\n\nThe code given:\n\n...\n\nlong s = n%2==0?n/2:n/2 +1;\n\n// long ar = n*(n+1) + s;\n\n// for(int i=(int)s; i>0; i--){\n//     if(i*i<=ar){\n//         System.out.println(i);\n//         break;\n//     }\n// }\nSystem.out.println(s);\n\nWait, the original code is outputting 's', which according to our analysis is the correct answer. But the code was commented out, and the current code just prints 's'. So why was the sample input given in the problem for n=5 outputting 3, which matches 's' here.\n\nBut according to the sample input when n=5, the code outputs 3, which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the code as written is correct, and the commented lines are a red herring. The original code might have been trying a different approach but the correct answer is simply to output 's' as computed.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the code is missing some lines. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe user provided code has missing lines or blocks that must be filled in. So the code as given is incomplete. The task is to output the missing code.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\npublic class A_The_Ultimate_Square {\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);\n        int t=sc.nextInt();\n        while(/* TODO: Your code here */){\n            int n = sc.nextInt();\n            long s = n%2==0?n/2:n/2 + 1;\n            // long ar = n*(n+1) + s;\n\n            // for(int i=(int)s; i>0; i--){\n            //     if(i*i<=ar){\n            //         System.out.println(i);\n            //         break;\n            //     }\n            // }\n            System.out.println(s);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe while loop is incomplete; the condition is missing. The user needs to fill in the loop condition.\n\nThe code reads 't' test cases, and for each test case, reads 'n' and computes 's' as (n/2 if even, else n/2 +1), then outputs 's'.\n\nBut the while loop condition is missing. The loop should run 't' times, so the condition for the while loop should be (t-- >0). So the missing code is (t-- >0).\n\nSo the code's missing part is the condition for the while loop. The correct loop is while (t-- >0).\n\nSo the answer is to fill in the loop condition as (t-- > 0).\n\nBut wait, looking back at the problem statement, the code given has a loop over the test cases. The original code's while loop is missing the condition, which is to process t test cases. The correct condition is t-- >0.\n\nSo the missing code is the loop condition, which is (t-- > 0).\n\nIn that case, the code will read 't' test cases, each time compute 's' as (n/2) or (n/2+1), then print 's'. Which according to our analysis is the correct answer.\n\nSo the only missing code is the loop condition. But the user's code as provided has the correct logic for 's', but the loop is not properly set up.\n\nSo the correct code for the loop is while (t-- > 0).\n\nThus, the missing code is that loop condition."
