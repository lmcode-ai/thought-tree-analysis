The edge from u to v exists in the reversed graph if there was an edge from v to u in the original graph. Thus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that v can reach u in one step in the original graph. Thus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v where v+1 mod 32768 =u or 2*v mod 32768 = u. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are:\n\nv1 = (u-1) mod 32768 \n\nv2 = u//2 if u is even \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are to v1 and v2 (if applicable).

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the minimum number of operations to reduce each a_i to 0 using either adding 1 or doubling. Hmm, the operations are either v+1 mod 32768 or 2*v mod 32768. Wait, but since mod is 32768, which is 2^15, maybe there's a way to work backwards. Like, instead of starting from a_i and trying to reach 0, maybe start from 0 and see how to reach a_i, but in reverse operations. Because sometimes working backwards can be easier.\n\nWait, the operations in reverse would be: if the current number was obtained by doubling, then the previous step could be dividing by 2 (but only if even). Or if it was obtained by adding 1, then the previous step would be subtracting 1. But since mod is involved, maybe the reverse steps can be considered as:\n\nFor a number x, to reach 0, the minimal steps can be found by considering the binary representation? Or perhaps BFS for each a_i, but since n can be up to 3e4, that might be too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, precompute for all possible values from 0 to 32767 the minimal steps. Since 32768 is manageable (like 3e4 is okay for precomputing). Let's think of dynamic programming. Let dp[v] be the minimal steps to reach 0 from v.\n\nThe transitions would be:\n\ndp[v] = min(1 + dp[(v-1) mod 32768], 1 + dp[v//2] if v is even else infinity). Wait, but maybe working backwards is better. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for each v, the minimal steps can be found by considering the binary path. Let me think of the steps in reverse. Let's think of how to get from 0 to v, but in reverse steps. Wait, maybe the minimal steps can be found by considering the binary representation of v. Let me see the examples given.\n\nTake the first example, a1=19. The solution was to add 1 to get 20, then multiply 13 times. 20 * 2^13 mod 32768. Wait 2^15 is 32768, so 2^13 is 8192. 20 * 8192 = 163840 mod 32768. Wait 163840 divided by 32768 is 5, so 163840 mod 32768 is 0. So that's why 13 steps of doubling. So the steps are 1 (add) +13 (doubles) =14.\n\nHmm, so the idea is that when you can reach a power of two multiple, then doubling is better. So perhaps the minimal steps involve finding the highest power of two that divides the number, and then working backwards.\n\nAlternatively, for a given v, the minimal steps can be found by considering the binary representation. Let me think of the steps in reverse. Let me think of the reverse operations:\n\nSuppose we want to reach 0 from v. The reverse steps would be:\n\nIf the previous step was a doubling, then the previous number was v/2 (if v is even). If the previous step was an increment, then the previous number was (v-1) mod 32768. \n\nWait, but in reverse, the steps can be considered as:\n\nTo get to 0, the last step must have been a doubling (since adding 1 would have come from -1 mod 32768, which is 32767, but that's not helpful). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be found by trying to reach 0 by dividing by 2 as much as possible when possible, and then adding steps for the remainder. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps for v is the number of bits in the binary representation plus the number of increments needed. Let me think of the example 19:\n\n19 in binary is 10011. To get to 0, perhaps the best way is to first get to 20 (adding 1), then divide by 2 14 times (since 20 * 2^14 mod 32768 would be 20*16384 mod 32768? Wait 2^15 is 32768, so 2^14 is 16384. 20 * 16384 = 327680 mod 32768 is 0. So 14 steps of doubling. But the example says 13 steps. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me see:\n\nThe example says 13 steps of doubling. Let me see 20 * 2^13 = 20 * 8192 = 163840. 163840 divided by 32768 is 5, so mod 32768 is 0. So 13 steps. So 2^13 is 8192. So 20 * 8192 = 163840 mod 32768 is 0. So 13 steps. So the total steps are 1 (add) +13 (doubles) =14.\n\nHmm, so the idea is that when you can reach a number that is a multiple of a power of two, then you can take those steps. So perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the binary representation and the path to reach a power of two.\n\nAlternatively, for a given v, the minimal steps can be found by considering the binary representation and the path of dividing by 2 as much as possible, but when it's odd, you have to subtract 1 (in reverse steps). Wait, maybe working backwards is better.\n\nLet me think of the reverse approach. Let's say we want to reach v from 0. Wait no, we need to reach 0 from v. So in reverse steps, each step can be either:\n\n- If the current number is even, then the previous step could have been a doubling (so previous number is current/2).\n\n- Or, the previous step could have been an increment, so previous number is (current -1) mod 32768.\n\nWait, but in reverse, the steps are:\n\nTo get to 0, the last step must have been a doubling (since adding 1 would have come from -1 mod 32768, which is 32767, but that's not helpful). So the last step must have been a doubling. So the previous number before that must have been 0/2 =0, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the last step before 0 must have been a doubling from 0, but that's not possible. So the last step must have been an increment from 32767 to 0. Wait, but 32767 +1 mod 32768 is 0. So for numbers like 32764, the example says adding 4 times to reach 32768 mod 32768=0. So that's 4 steps. So in that case, the minimal steps are adding 4 times. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the binary representation and the path of dividing by 2 as much as possible, but when the number is odd, you have to subtract 1 (in reverse steps). \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach: for each v, the minimal steps can be computed by considering the binary representation and the path of dividing by 2 when possible, and adding steps when you have to adjust. \n\nWait, let's think of the reverse process. Let me define f(v) as the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nThen, f(0) =0. \n\nFor v !=0:\n\nf(v) = min(1 + f((v-1) mod 32768), 1 + f(v//2) if v is even else infinity )\n\nWait, but this is a recursive formula. However, since 32768 is manageable, we can precompute this with memoization or dynamic programming. \n\nBut since 32768 is 2^15, maybe we can compute this for all v in O(32768) time. Let's see.\n\nWe can precompute an array dp where dp[v] is the minimal steps for v. \n\nWe can compute this in reverse order. Let's start from 0 and compute for all v. \n\nAlternatively, since the transitions can be tricky, perhaps a BFS approach is better. Since each state is a number between 0 and 32767, and each step can be considered as edges. \n\nWait, the minimal steps can be found via BFS. Because each step is either adding 1 or doubling. So the graph is directed edges from v to (v+1)%32768 and to (2*v)%32768. We need to find the shortest path from v to 0. \n\nBut since the graph is directed and has cycles, BFS might not be straightforward. However, since we need the minimal steps, BFS can work if we process nodes in order of their distance. \n\nAlternatively, since the target is 0, perhaps we can reverse the edges and do BFS from 0. Let me think:\n\nIn the reversed graph, edges are from (v+1 mod 32768) to v (since in original, v can go to v+1 mod 32768, so reversed edge is from v+1 mod 32768 to v). Similarly, edges from (2*v mod 32768) to v (since original edge is v to 2v mod 32768). \n\nThen, the minimal steps from v to 0 in original is the same as the minimal steps from 0 to v in the reversed graph. \n\nSo, doing BFS starting from 0 in the reversed graph would give the minimal steps for each node. \n\nThis seems feasible. Let's see:\n\nInitialize a distance array with all infinity except distance[0] =0. \n\nWe can use a queue. Start with 0. \n\nFor each current node u, we can find all predecessors in the reversed graph. \n\nThe predecessors are:\n\n- (u-1) mod 32768 (since in original, that node can go to u via adding 1)\n\n- (u * inv(2) mod 32768) if u is even? Wait, no. Wait, in the original graph, a node v can reach 2*v mod 32768. So in the reversed graph, the edge is from 2*v mod 32768 to v. So for a node u in the reversed graph, the predecessors via the doubling edge would be v such that 2*v mod 32768 = u. So v can be u//2 if u is even. Because 2*(u//2) mod 32768 is u. \n\nWait, for example, if u is even, then v = u//2 is a predecessor via the doubling edge. \n\nSo for each u, the predecessors are:\n\n1. (u -1) mod 32768 (from the add edge)\n\n2. u//2 if u is even (from the doubling edge)\n\nSo for each u in the queue, we can process these two predecessors. \n\nWait, but in the reversed graph, the edges are from the next nodes to u. So for each u, the edges in reversed graph are from (u+1 mod 32768) to u via the add edge, and from (2u mod 32768) to u via the doubling edge. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express:\n\nOriginal edges:\n\nEach node v has edges to (v+1) mod 32768 (add) and to (2*v) mod 32768 (double). \n\nIn the reversed graph, edges are from (v+1 mod 32768) to v (because original edge is v to v+1 mod 32768), and from (2*v mod 32768) to v (original edge is v to 2v mod 32768). \n\nSo for each node u in the reversed graph, the predecessors are:\n\n- (u-1) mod 32768 (since in original, that node can go to u via add)\n\n- (u * inv(2) mod 32768) if u is even (since 2*(u/2) mod 32768 = u, so the predecessor via doubling is u/2)\n\nWait, but for u even, the predecessor via doubling is u//2. \n\nSo for each u, the predecessors are:\n\nprev1 = (u -1) mod 32768\n\nprev2 = u//2 if u is even.\n\nThus, in the reversed graph, the edges are from prev1 and prev2 to u. \n\nTherefore, in the BFS, for each current node u, we can look at these predecessors and see if their distance can be updated. \n\nWait, but in BFS, we process nodes in order of their distance. So starting from 0, distance 0. \n\nThen, for each node u, when we process it, we can look at its predecessors and see if their distance can be set to distance[u] +1. \n\nWait, no. Wait, in the reversed graph, the edges are from the predecessors to u. So the distance to the predecessor would be distance[u] +1? \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the reversed graph's edges as the way to reach predecessors from u. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model the BFS as follows:\n\nWe want to find the minimal steps from v to 0. So in the original graph, the edges are forward. So the minimal steps can be found via BFS starting from each node, but that's O(n) per node, which is 3e4 * 3e4 steps, which is way too big. \n\nHence, the BFS approach in the reversed graph is better. \n\nLet me try to think of the reversed graph's BFS. \n\nInitialize distance array with all infinity except distance[0] =0. \n\nWe use a queue. Start with 0. \n\nFor each node u in the queue, we look at its predecessors (prev1 and prev2 as above). \n\nFor each predecessor v in [prev1, prev2 (if applicable)], if distance[v] is infinity, then set distance[v] = distance[u] +1, and add to the queue. \n\nWait, but this way, the distance[v] is the minimal steps from 0 to v in the reversed graph, which corresponds to the minimal steps from v to 0 in the original graph. \n\nYes, exactly. \n\nSo this approach should work. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the distance array for all v from 0 to 32767 using BFS on the reversed graph. \n\nOnce we have this array, for each a_i in the input, we can just output distance[a_i]. \n\nSo the code for program1.py would be to precompute this distance array, then read the inputs and output the distances. \n\nNow, how to implement this in Python. \n\nFirst, the code given for program1.py is:\n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in map(int,s.split()):# TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the first line is n,s = open(0). But open(0) would read from stdin, but in Python, that's not the way. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake here. The correct way to read from stdin is to read lines. \n\nWait, perhaps the first line is supposed to read n and the list of a_i. \n\nWait, the code given is incomplete. The user probably wants to read n, then the next line as the list of a_i. \n\nBut the code as written is incorrect. Let me see:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nn,s = open(0)\n\nBut open(0) is not a valid way to read from stdin. The correct way would be to read from stdin. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to read the first line as n, then the second line as the list. \n\nSo the correct code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut in the given code, the first line is n,s = open(0). That's probably a mistake. \n\nBut the user's code for program1.py is incomplete. The task is to complete the code. \n\nThe code given is:\n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in map(int,s.split()):# TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the first line is wrong. The user probably intended to read n and the list. \n\nBut the problem is to complete the code. So the missing part is to compute the distance array via BFS, then for each x in the list, output the distance[x]. \n\nSo the steps for program1.py are:\n\n1. Precompute the distance array using BFS on the reversed graph. \n\nImplementing this in code. \n\nFirst, the distance array can be an array of size 32768. \n\nInitialize distance array with all -1 or infinity. \n\ndistance[0] =0. \n\nWe can use a queue. \n\nImplementing BFS:\n\nInitialize a queue with 0. \n\nThen, for each node u in the queue, process its predecessors. \n\nWait, the predecessors are (u-1) mod 32768 and (u//2) if u is even. \n\nWait, for each u, the predecessors are:\n\nprev1 = (u -1) % 32768\n\nprev2 = u//2 if u is even. \n\nSo for each u in the queue, we can check these two predecessors. \n\nWait, but in the reversed graph, the edges are from the predecessors to u. So in the BFS, the distance to the predecessor is distance[u] +1? \n\nWait, no. Because in the reversed graph, the edges are from the predecessors to u. So the distance to the predecessor would be distance[u] +1? \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe distance array in the reversed graph is the minimal steps to reach the node from 0. \n\nWait, no. Wait, in the reversed graph, the edges are such that moving from predecessor to u takes one step. So the distance to u is the distance to predecessor plus 1. \n\nWait, the distance array is for the reversed graph. \n\nWait, the distance array is the minimal steps from 0 (in the reversed graph) to each node. \n\nSo for each predecessor v of u, if we can reach v in distance[v] steps, then u can be reached in distance[v]+1 steps. \n\nAlternatively, the BFS proceeds as follows:\n\nStart with 0 (distance 0). \n\nFor each u in the queue, look at all nodes that can reach u in one step (i.e., the predecessors of u in the reversed graph). \n\nWait, no. Wait, in the reversed graph, the edges are from the predecessors to u. So the predecessors are the nodes that can reach u in one step. \n\nThus, for each u, the nodes that can reach u in one step are the predecessors. \n\nTherefore, to compute the distance to those predecessors, we can process u's distance and set their distance to distance[u] +1. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance to the predecessor would be distance[u] -1? \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose u is 1. \n\nIn the reversed graph, the predecessors of u are:\n\nprev1 = (1-1) mod 32768 =0 \n\nprev2: since 1 is odd, no. \n\nSo the predecessors are 0. \n\nSo the distance to 1 would be distance[0] +1 =1. \n\nWhich is correct, because in the original graph, to get from 1 to 0, you can do add 1 (1+1 mod 32768 is 2, but that's not helpful). Wait, no. Wait, in the original graph, to reach 0 from 1, you can do add 1 (1+1 mod 32768 is 2, but that's not 0. Alternatively, you can add 32767 times to reach 0. So the minimal steps would be 32767 steps? But that's not right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, the minimal steps for 1 to reach 0 would be adding 1 32767 times (since 1 + 32767 mod 32768 is 0). But that's 32767 steps. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. \n\nWait, the other option is to double. 1*2 mod 32768 is 2. Then doubling again gives 4, etc. But that would take more steps. \n\nHmm, so the minimal steps for 1 would be 32767 steps of adding. \n\nBut according to the reversed graph approach, the distance[1] would be 1 (distance[0] +1). Which would imply that the minimal steps from 1 to 0 is 1. Which is wrong. \n\nWait, so there's a problem here. \n\nHmm, so my approach must be wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I have the reversed graph's edges wrong. Let me re-express:\n\nIn the original graph, the edges are from v to v+1 mod 32768 (add) and to 2*v mod 32768 (double). \n\nThe reversed graph's edges are from v+1 mod 32768 to v (for the add edge), and from 2*v mod 32768 to v (for the double edge). \n\nSo for the reversed graph, the edges are:\n\nFor each v, there is an edge from (v+1 mod 32768) to v (because in original, v can go to v+1 mod 32768 via add). \n\nAlso, there is an edge from (2*v mod 32768) to v (because in original, v can go to 2*v mod 32768 via double). \n\nThus, the predecessors of u in the reversed graph are:\n\n- (u-1) mod 32768 (since (u-1 +1 mod 32768) is u, so the edge is from u to u-1 in the reversed graph?)\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe edge from (v+1 mod 32768) to v in the reversed graph. So for u = v+1 mod 32768, the predecessor is v. \n\nThus, the predecessor for u is (u-1) mod 32768. \n\nSimilarly, the edge from (2*v mod 32768) to v in the reversed graph. So for u = 2*v mod 32768, the predecessor is v. \n\nThus, the predecessors of u via the double edge are v where 2*v mod 32768 = u. \n\nSo v can be u//2 if u is even. \n\nThus, the predecessors of u are:\n\nprev1 = (u-1) mod 32768 (from the add edge)\n\nprev2 = u//2 if u is even (from the double edge)\n\nThus, in the reversed graph, the edges are from these predecessors to u. \n\nTherefore, the distance to u is the minimal of the distance to its predecessors plus 1. \n\nWait, but in the BFS approach, when processing u, we can look at its predecessors and see if their distance can be set to distance[u] +1. \n\nWait, no. Because the distance to the predecessor is the distance to reach them from 0 in the reversed graph, which corresponds to the path from 0 to predecessor, then to u. \n\nWait, perhaps the BFS should be done in the reversed graph, starting from 0, and for each node, we can reach its neighbors (the nodes that can be reached via edges from it). \n\nWait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. \n\nLet me think of the reversed graph's edges as the way to reach nodes from predecessors. \n\nWait, in the reversed graph, the edges are from the predecessors to u. So to reach u, you can come from its predecessors. \n\nThus, the distance to u is the minimal distance among its predecessors plus 1. \n\nTherefore, the BFS should process nodes in order of their distance. \n\nThe correct way to compute the distance array is:\n\nInitialize distance array with all infinity except distance[0] =0. \n\nUse a queue. \n\nStart with 0. \n\nFor each node u in the queue, look at its neighbors in the reversed graph (i.e., the nodes that can be reached from u via edges in the reversed graph). \n\nWait, no. Wait, in the reversed graph, the edges are from predecessors to u. So the edges from u in the reversed graph are to its \"successors\" in the reversed graph. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me think of the reversed graph's edges as the original edges reversed. \n\nThe original edges are:\n\nFor each v, edges to v+1 mod 32768 and 2*v mod 32768. \n\nThe reversed edges are:\n\nFor each v, edges from v+1 mod 32768 to v, and from 2*v mod 32768 to v. \n\nThus, in the reversed graph, the edges are from those nodes to v. \n\nTherefore, to compute the distance from 0 in the reversed graph (which corresponds to the minimal steps from v to 0 in the original graph), we can perform BFS starting at 0. \n\nThe BFS proceeds as follows:\n\nInitialize distance array with all infinity except distance[0] =0. \n\nQueue starts with 0. \n\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n\n   u = dequeue()\n\n   for each neighbor v in reversed edges from u:\n\n       if distance[v] is infinity:\n\n           distance[v] = distance[u] +1\n\n           enqueue(v)\n\nThe neighbors of u in the reversed graph are the nodes that can be reached via edges from u. \n\nWait, the edges in the reversed graph are from predecessors to u. So the edges from u in the reversed graph are to the nodes that can be reached via the original edges. \n\nWait, no. The reversed edges are the original edges reversed. So for each original edge v -> w, there is a reversed edge w -> v. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are all the nodes w such that in the original graph, u had an edge to w. \n\nWait, no. The reversed edge is from w to v if the original edge was v to w. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are all the nodes v such that in the original graph, u had an edge to v. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nOriginal edge: v \u2192 w. \n\nReversed edge: w \u2192 v. \n\nThus, in the reversed graph, the edges from w include an edge to v. \n\nSo, in the reversed graph, the edges from u are all the nodes v such that in the original graph, u had an edge to v. \n\nWait, no. The reversed edge is from w to v. So the edges from w in the reversed graph include v. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, u had an edge to v. \n\nWait, no. Because the original edge is u \u2192 v. So the reversed edge is v \u2192 u. \n\nThus, in the reversed graph, the edges from v include an edge to u. \n\nSo, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes w such that in the original graph, there was an edge from w to u. \n\nAh, right. \n\nSo, in the reversed graph, the edges from u are the nodes that can reach u via an original edge. \n\nWait, no. The edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes that u can reach via the reversed edges. \n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think of the reversed graph's edges as follows:\n\nFor each original edge v \u2192 w, there is a reversed edge w \u2192 v. \n\nThus, in the reversed graph, the edges from w include an edge to v. \n\nTherefore, the edges from u in the reversed graph are all the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nThus, to find the neighbors of u in the reversed graph, we need to find all nodes v where in the original graph, v can reach u via one step. \n\nIn the original graph, the edges from v are to v+1 mod 32768 and 2*v mod 32768. \n\nThus, for a node u, the predecessors in the reversed graph (nodes that can reach u in one step in the original graph) are:\n\n- v = (u -1) mod 32768 (since v+1 mod 32768 = u)\n\n- v = (u) // 2 if u is even (since 2*v mod 32768 = u \u2192 v = u//2)\n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are to these two predecessors. \n\nWait, no. The edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes that can be reached via the reversed edges. \n\nWait, the reversed edges from u are the nodes that can be reached by following the reversed edges from u. \n\nWait, the reversed edges from u are the nodes v such that in the original graph, u had an edge to v. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, u can go to v via an edge. \n\nWait, no. The reversed edges are the original edges reversed. So the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes that were reachable from u in the original graph. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of the BFS in the reversed graph as follows:\n\nWe want to compute the minimal steps from 0 in the reversed graph. \n\nThe reversed graph's edges are the original edges reversed. \n\nThus, the BFS starts at 0. \n\nFor each node u in the queue, we can go to all nodes that have edges from u in the reversed graph. \n\nThese nodes are the ones that were reachable from u in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. The edges in the reversed graph from u are the nodes that were reachable from u in the original graph. \n\nWait, no. The edges in the reversed graph from u are the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nWait, no. The reversed edge is from w to v if the original edge was v to w. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nWait, no. The edge in the reversed graph is from w to v if the original edge was v to w. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nWait, no. The edge in the reversed graph is from w to v if the original edge was v to w. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nWait, no. The edge in the reversed graph is from w to v if the original edge was v to w. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nWait, no. The edge in the reversed graph is from w to v if the original edge was v to w. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nWait, no. The edge in the reversed graph is from w to v if the original edge was v to w. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of it this way:\n\nIn the reversed graph, the edges are the original edges reversed. \n\nThus, for each original edge v \u2192 w, there is a reversed edge w \u2192 v. \n\nThus, the edges from w in the reversed graph include v. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are all the nodes v such that in the original graph, there was an edge from v to u. \n\nThus, to find the edges from u in the reversed graph, we need to find all v such that v can reach u in one step in the original graph. \n\nIn the original graph, the edges from v are to v+1 mod 32768 and 2*v mod 32768. \n\nThus, for a node u, the nodes v that can reach u in one step are:\n\n- v = (u -1) mod 32768 (since v+1 mod 32768 = u)\n\n- v = u//2 if u is even (since 2*v mod 32768 = u \u2192 v = u//2)\n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are to these two nodes. \n\nWait, no. The edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, v can reach u in one step. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v that can reach u via one step in the original graph. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that v+1 mod 32768 =u or 2*v mod 32768 =u. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v that are (u-1) mod 32768 and (u//2 if even). \n\nWait, no. The edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v such that in the original graph, v can reach u in one step. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are the nodes v where v+1 mod 32768 =u or 2*v mod 32768 =u. \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are:\n\nprev1 = (u-1) mod 32768 \n\nprev2 = u//2 if u is even \n\nThus, the edges from u in the reversed graph are to these two nodes. \n\nWait, no.
