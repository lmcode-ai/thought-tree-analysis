Then, find all positions of global_max and global_min. The left boundary is the minimum of all positions of global_max and global_min.

Thus, their difference is global_max - global_min. But this is not helpful for the first case. Thus, the three regions' max and min are: For region 1: compute max and min of the subarray [0, left-1]. For region 2: compute max and min of the subarray [right+1, n-1]. For region 3: compute max and min of the subarray [left, right], but excluding the global_max and global_min.

Wait, the first sample's optimal interval is between the global_max and global_min. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct. Alternatively, the middle region's contribution is not considered because it includes the global_max or global_min. Thus, the max_candidate is the maximum between region1 and region2. In the first sample, region1's max and min would be the max and min of the elements before the global_min's position. Region2's max and min would be the elements after the global_max's position. The optimal interval is in the middle region, but that region's contribution is not considered. Thus, this approach would fail. Hmm, this is really challenging. Perhaps I should look for the code for program1.py. The code for program1.py is supposed to read the test cases and compute the maximum beauty. The code currently has a loop over test cases, but nothing else. The correct approach must involve precomputing prefix and suffix arrays and using a segment tree for range max and min. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, this would be O(n log n) per test case, which is acceptable for t=1e3.",

The outside is the array excluding the subsegment. The inside is the subsegment. The total is the sum of the two differences. The maximum possible value would be when both terms are as large as possible. The first term is maximized when the outside has a large max and small min.

Wait in the second sample, the outside's max is 100 (from the first element?), and min is 2 (the first element). Wait, the outside includes the first element (2) and the elements after r=4. The global_max of the entire array is 200 (inside the subsegment), so the outside's max is 100. Thus, the outside's contribution is 100-2 = 98. The inside's contribution is 200-1 = 199. Total is 297. Thus, the subsegment includes the global_max (200) but excludes the global_min (1 is in the inside). Wait, the global_min is 1, which is in the inside. Thus, the outside does not include the global_min. Thus, the outside's min is 2 (the first element). Thus, the outside's contribution is (100-2) = 98. The inside's contribution is (200-1) = 199. Total is 297. Thus, the subsegment includes the global_max but excludes the global_min. Thus, the outside does not include the global_min, so the global_min is in the inside. Thus, the outside's min is 2, not the global_min. Thus, the previous approach of requiring the subsegment to exclude both is not the case here. Hmm, this breaks the initial approach. So the initial approach is incorrect. Hmm, so the problem is more complex. Alternative Idea: \n\nThe beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). To maximize this, we can consider all possible intervals and compute this value. But how to do this efficiently. The key is to precompute for each possible interval the max and min of the inside, and the max and min of the outside. The outside's max and min can be computed using prefix and suffix arrays. The inside's max and min can be computed using a segment tree or other data structure. Let me think of the steps: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n1. Read the array a. \n\n2. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. 3. Precompute for all intervals their max and min. But how to do this efficiently.

But the initial code in program2.py has some code: \n\nsizes = lines[1].split(' ')\n\ntot, running = 0, 0\nminval = 0\n\nfor lock in sizes:\n    tot += int(lock)\n    running += 1\n    minval = max(minval, tot/running)\n\nfor mintime in lines[3:]:\n  if (int(mintime) < minval):\n    print(\"-1\")\n  else:\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe initial code computes minval as the maximum of (sum of first i elements)/i for all i.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the maximum beauty of a proper subsegment. The beauty is calculated as the difference between the max and min of the elements outside the subsegment plus the difference between the max and min of the subsegment itself. \n\nHmm, the brute-force approach would be to check every possible subsegment, but with n up to 1e5, that's way too slow. So we need a smarter way. \n\nLet me think about the components of the beauty. The first part is the max minus min of the entire array except the subsegment. Wait, but if the subsegment is a proper one, then the remaining elements are split into two parts (before and after the subsegment). So the max and min of the entire array except the subsegment would be the max of the left part and the right part, and similarly for the min. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the max of the entire array except the subsegment is the maximum between the max of the left part and the max of the right part. Similarly for the min. \n\nSo to compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute prefix max and min arrays, and suffix max and min arrays. Then for any l and r, the max outside would be the max of prefix_max[l-1] and suffix_max[r+1], and similarly for the min. \n\nThe second part of the beauty is the max of the subsegment minus the min of the subsegment. To compute that for any subsegment, we can precompute for all possible intervals their max and min. But even that would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, so maybe we can find for each position the best possible subsegment that starts or ends there. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible beauty comes from certain key points. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty can be found by considering that the best subsegment is either the entire array except the first element, the last element, or some other specific cases. Wait, but the problem requires a proper subsegment, so the entire array is excluded. \n\nWait, the problem says a proper subsegment is any two integers 1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 n where r - l + 1 < n. So the subsegment can't be the entire array. \n\nAnother thought: the maximum beauty would be the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). To maximize this, perhaps the best is when the outside has a large max and small min, and the inside has a large max and small min. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum possible value is (global_max - global_min) + (some subsegment's max - min). But that might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub), but only if the subsegment doesn't include the global_max or global_min. Wait, but that might not hold. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal subsegment is such that when you remove it, the remaining elements have their max and min as large as possible. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the outside part. The outside's max and min are determined by the left and right parts. So for a given l and r, the outside's max is the maximum between the prefix_max up to l-1 and the suffix_max from r+1. Similarly for the min. \n\nSo, to compute this efficiently, we can precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nThen, for the inside part (the subsegment from l to r), we need the max and min of that subsegment. To compute the max and min for all possible intervals quickly, perhaps we can use a sliding window approach or some other method. But even that might be O(n^2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for any interval is the maximum possible (max - min) of any interval. But that's not necessarily the case because the outside part's contribution also matters. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to find for each possible interval the (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). To compute this efficiently, we can precompute the prefix and suffix arrays, and then for each possible interval, compute the outside's max and min quickly. \n\nBut even with that, how do we compute the max and min of the interval efficiently? \n\nWait, maybe the maximum possible value of (max_inside - min_inside) is the global max minus the global min. But that would require the interval to include both the global max and min. However, when you remove that interval, the outside would not have those values, so their contribution would be lower. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best subsegment is one that excludes either the global max or the global min. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) of some subsegment. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as follows: \n\nThe total beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThe first term is the difference between the max and min of the elements not in the subsegment. The second term is the difference between the max and min of the subsegment. \n\nTo maximize this sum, we need to maximize both terms. \n\nSuppose the subsegment is chosen such that the outside has a large max and small min (so their difference is big), and the inside also has a large max and small min. \n\nHmm, but how to find such a subsegment efficiently. \n\nAnother idea: the maximum possible value of (max_outside - min_outside) is the global_max - global_min, but that would require the subsegment to exclude all elements except one. Wait, no. For example, if the subsegment is the entire array except one element, then the outside is that one element. So the max and min of the outside would be that element, so their difference is zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum (max_outside - min_outside) is the global_max - global_min, but only if the subsegment doesn't include either the global_max or the global_min. \n\nWait, if the subsegment excludes the global_max, then the outside includes it, so the max_outside would be global_max. Similarly, if the subsegment excludes the global_min, then the min_outside would be global_min. \n\nSo to get the maximum possible (max_outside - min_outside), the subsegment must exclude both the global_max and the global_min. \n\nWait, but if the subsegment excludes the global_max, then the outside has it, so the max is global_max. Similarly, if the subsegment excludes the global_min, then the min is global_min. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible (max_outside - min_outside) is (global_max - global_min), but only if there exists a subsegment that excludes both the global_max and the global_min. \n\nSo, if such a subsegment exists, then the first term can be as high as possible. \n\nThen, the second term (max_inside - min_inside) can be as high as possible. \n\nBut how to combine these? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subsegment is the one that excludes either the global_max or the global_min, but not both. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let's think of the approach step by step. \n\nFirst, precompute the prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nprefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i], etc. \n\nWait, let's index from 0 to n-1 for easier handling. \n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0], prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\nSimilarly for prefix_min. \n\nsuffix_max[n-1] = a[n-1], suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n\nSame for suffix_min. \n\nThen, for any interval l to r (0-based?), the outside's max is max(prefix_max[l-1], suffix_max[r+1]). \n\nWait, the outside is the elements before l and after r. So the max of those is the max between the prefix_max up to l-1 and the suffix_max starting from r+1. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nThe inside's max and min can be found by the max and min of a[l..r]. \n\nBut how to compute the max and min for all possible intervals efficiently? \n\nThis is the crux. \n\nThe problem is that for each possible interval, we need to know its max and min. \n\nThe standard way to do this is with a segment tree, but even that would take O(n log n) per test case, which might be acceptable for n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the maximum beauty is achieved in certain specific intervals. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that excludes both the global_max and global_min. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval. \n\nWait, but if the interval includes both the global_max and global_min, then the outside's contribution would be zero (since the outside would exclude them, so their max and min would be smaller). \n\nHmm, perhaps the best approach is to precompute for all possible intervals their max and min, but that's O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum possible beauty can be obtained by considering intervals that exclude either the global_max or the global_min. \n\nWait, let's think of the first term (max_outside - min_outside). To maximize this, the outside must include both the global_max and global_min. So the subsegment must exclude both. \n\nIn that case, the first term is (global_max - global_min). \n\nThen, the second term (max_inside - min_inside) can be as large as possible. \n\nSo the total would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThe maximum of this would be when the inside's (max - min) is as large as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that doesn't include both global_max and global_min. \n\nHmm, but how to find that. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval. \n\nWait, but if the interval includes both global_max and global_min, then the outside's contribution would be zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best scenario is when the outside has the global_max and global_min, so their difference is maximum, and the inside has a large (max - min). \n\nSo the total would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nTo maximize this, we need to choose an interval that excludes both the global_max and global_min. \n\nWait, but how to find such an interval. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that doesn't include both. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that excludes both, and other possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval, but only if that interval excludes both. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too vague. Let's think of the code structure. \n\nThe code for program1.py starts with a loop over test cases. \n\nInside each test case, we need to read n and the array a. \n\nThen, compute the maximum beauty over all proper subsegments. \n\nThe problem is how to compute this efficiently. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering the following candidates: \n\n1. The entire array except the first element. \n\n2. The entire array except the last element. \n\n3. The entire array except the first and last elements. \n\n4. The subsegment that excludes the global_max. \n\n5. The subsegment that excludes the global_min. \n\n6. The subsegment that excludes both the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut perhaps the maximum is among these candidates. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that excludes both, and other terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside) for all possible intervals. \n\nTo compute this, we can precompute the prefix and suffix arrays, and for each possible interval, compute the outside's max and min, and the inside's max and min. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to note that the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for any interval is the global_max - global_min. But that would require the interval to include both. However, in that case, the outside's contribution would be zero. So the total would be (0) + (global_max - global_min) = global_max - global_min. \n\nAlternatively, if the interval excludes both, then the outside's contribution is global_max - global_min, and the inside's contribution can be up to (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nSo the total would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nTo maximize this, we need to choose an interval that excludes both, and has as large as possible (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible value would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside), where the interval excludes both. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) among all intervals that exclude both the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut how to find that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that excludes both, and the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that includes both (but then the outside's contribution is zero). \n\nSo the overall maximum is the maximum between these two. \n\nHmm, but how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that excludes both, and the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval. \n\nWait, but the second term would be the global_max - global_min, so adding zero (from the outside) gives that. \n\nSo the maximum between (global_max - global_min + (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals excluding both) and (global_max - global_min). \n\nHmm, so the first term could be higher. \n\nSo the plan is: \n\n1. Compute the global_max and global_min of the array. \n\n2. Find all intervals that exclude both global_max and global_min. For each such interval, compute (max_inside - min_inside). The maximum of these plus (global_max - global_min) is a candidate. \n\n3. Also compute the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals (this is global_max - global_min). \n\n4. The overall maximum is the maximum between the two candidates. \n\nBut how to efficiently find the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both global_max and global_min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for any interval is the global_max - global_min, so the first candidate would be (global_max - global_min) + (global_max - global_min) = 2*(global_max - global_min). But that would require that there exists an interval that excludes both and has max and min equal to the global ones. Which is impossible, since the interval can't include both. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the first candidate can't reach that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both is the maximum between (max of the array excluding global_max and global_min minus the min of that array) and other possibilities. \n\nWait, but that's just the maximum possible (max - min) in the array excluding those two elements. \n\nHmm, but how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both is the maximum (max - min) of any interval that doesn't include either of the two. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) for such intervals is the maximum between the maximum (max - min) of the left part (before the global_max and global_min) and the right part, etc. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe beauty can be rewritten as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nLet me denote the entire array's max and min as Gmax and Gmin. \n\nSuppose the subsegment is S. \n\nThen, the outside is the array without S. \n\nThe max_outside is the maximum between the max of the elements before S and the max of the elements after S. \n\nSimilarly for min_outside. \n\nThe max_inside is the max of S, min_inside the min of S. \n\nThe total is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nNow, the maximum possible value of this expression. \n\nLet me think of the best possible scenario. \n\nSuppose the subsegment S is such that the outside includes both Gmax and Gmin. Then, max_outside is Gmax, min_outside is Gmin. So their difference is Gmax - Gmin. \n\nThen, the inside's contribution is (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThus, the total is (Gmax - Gmin) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nTo maximize this, we need to choose S such that it excludes both Gmax and Gmin, and the inside's (max - min) is as large as possible. \n\nAlternatively, if the inside's (max - min) is as large as possible, then this term would be added to the Gmax - Gmin. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible value would be (Gmax - Gmin) plus the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that excludes both Gmax and Gmin. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) among all intervals that exclude both Gmax and Gmin. \n\nThen, the total would be (Gmax - Gmin) + that value. \n\nAdditionally, there might be other cases where the outside doesn't include both, so their contribution is less than Gmax - Gmin. \n\nThus, the maximum between this and other possibilities. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nHmm, perhaps the steps are: \n\n1. Find the positions of Gmax and Gmin. \n\n2. Find all intervals that do not include either of these positions. \n\nWait, no, the interval must exclude both. \n\nWait, the interval S must exclude both the Gmax and Gmin elements. \n\nSo the interval can be anywhere except the regions that include either. \n\nAlternatively, the interval can be in the left part before both, between them, or after both. \n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to split the array into regions and compute the maximum (max - min) in those regions. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals not containing Gmax and Gmin can be found by considering the array split into three parts: \n\n- The part before the leftmost of Gmax and Gmin. \n\n- The part between them. \n\n- The part after the rightmost of them. \n\nWait, but the exact positions matter. \n\nAlternatively, the array can be divided into segments that are not overlapping with the positions of Gmax and Gmin. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max - min) in any interval that doesn't include either of the two can be found by considering the entire array except those two elements. \n\nWait, but the interval can exclude either one or both. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both is the maximum between the maximum (max - min) in the left part (before the first of the two), the middle part (between them), and the right part (after the second). \n\nAlternatively, the maximum can be found by considering the array split into regions that exclude both. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for such intervals is the maximum between the maximum (max - min) of the array excluding the Gmax and Gmin. \n\nWait, but that's not exactly the same. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max - min) of any interval that doesn't include either of the two elements. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps the key is to precompute for all possible intervals their max and min, but using a sliding window approach. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) can be found in O(n) time using a sliding window approach for max and min. \n\nWait, but even that might not be feasible for n up to 1e5. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max - min) over any interval is the global_max - global_min. But that requires the interval to include both. \n\nSo, if we can find the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both, then the total would be (Gmax - Gmin) + (that value). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible beauty is (Gmax - Gmin) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that excludes both. \n\nSo, to compute this, we can: \n\n- Find all intervals that exclude both Gmax and Gmin. \n\n- For each such interval, compute (max_inside - min_inside). \n\n- Take the maximum of these, then add (Gmax - Gmin). \n\n- Also, compute the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals (which is Gmax - Gmin), and compare. \n\nThe maximum between these two would be the answer. \n\nBut how to compute the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both Gmax and Gmin. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for such intervals is the maximum between the maximum (max - min) in the left part (before the first of the two elements), the middle part (between them), and the right part (after the second). \n\nWait, let's suppose that the positions of Gmax and Gmin are known. Let's say the leftmost of the two is at position L and the rightmost is at position R. \n\nThen, the regions to consider are: \n\n1. The elements before L. \n\n2. The elements between L and R. \n\n3. The elements after R. \n\nWait, but between L and R, there might be elements that are part of the middle region. \n\nWait, the middle region between L and R would include elements that are between the two positions. \n\nSo, the maximum (max - min) in each of these three regions can be computed, and the maximum among them is the candidate. \n\nThus, the steps would be: \n\n1. Find the global_max and global_min, and their positions. \n\n2. Find the leftmost and rightmost positions of these two (since there could be multiple occurrences, but we need to take the leftmost and rightmost to cover all possibilities). \n\nWait, actually, the positions of the global_max and global_min could be anywhere. Let's say the positions are pos_max and pos_min. \n\nWe need to consider the leftmost and rightmost of these two. \n\nWait, perhaps the left boundary is the minimum of pos_max and pos_min, and the right boundary is the maximum of them. \n\nSo the regions are: \n\n- Before the left boundary. \n\n- Between the left and right boundaries. \n\n- After the right boundary. \n\nWait, but the middle region (between left and right) includes the area between the two positions. \n\nThus, the maximum (max - min) in each of these three regions can be computed. \n\nThe maximum among these three would be the maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both global_max and global_min. \n\nThen, adding (global_max - global_min) gives a candidate. \n\nAdditionally, we also need to consider the case where the interval includes one of them but not both. \n\nWait, but in that case, the outside would include the other, so the outside's contribution would be (max_outside - min_outside) which is less than (global_max - global_min). \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum candidate is the one we computed. \n\nSo, the plan is: \n\nCompute the maximum between: \n\na) (global_max - global_min) + (max of the three regions' (max - min)), \n\nb) the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals (which is global_max - global_min). \n\nThus, the maximum between a and b would be the answer. \n\nWait, but a could be larger than b. \n\nSo, the maximum between a and b is the candidate. \n\nAdditionally, there might be other cases where the outside doesn't include both, so their contribution is less than (global_max - global_min). \n\nBut perhaps the maximum is indeed the a case. \n\nSo, the steps for the code would be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Read the array. \n\n- Compute global_max and global_min. \n\n- Find all positions of global_max and global_min. \n\n- Find the leftmost and rightmost positions among these. \n\n- Split the array into three regions: before left, between left and right, after right. \n\n- For each region, compute the maximum (max - min) over any interval in that region. \n\n- The maximum of these three is the max_candidate. \n\n- The total_candidate is (global_max - global_min) + max_candidate. \n\n- Also compute the global_max - global_min (the case where the interval includes both, so the outside's contribution is zero). \n\n- The answer is the maximum between total_candidate and (global_max - global_min). \n\nWait, but what if there are no intervals in the three regions? For example, if the entire array is between the left and right boundaries, then the regions before and after may be empty. \n\nHmm, but the problem requires a proper subsegment, so the entire array is not allowed. \n\nWait, but the regions are parts of the array excluding the global_max and global_min. \n\nWait, the regions are the parts before the left boundary, between the two boundaries, and after the right boundary. \n\nSo, for example, if the left and right boundaries are adjacent, then the middle region is empty. \n\nThus, the code must handle those cases. \n\nNow, how to compute the maximum (max - min) in a given region (a subarray). \n\nThe maximum (max - min) over any interval in a given array can be found in O(n) time using a sliding window approach? \n\nAlternatively, for a given array, the maximum (max - min) over any interval is the global_max of the region minus the global_min of the region. \n\nWait, because the maximum difference between max and min in any interval is achieved by the interval that includes both the global max and min of that region. \n\nSo, for a region, the maximum (max - min) over any interval is simply (max_region - min_region). \n\nAh! That's a crucial insight. \n\nSo, for any region, the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals in that region is equal to the (max of the region) minus (min of the region). \n\nBecause the interval that includes both the max and min of the region will have that difference. \n\nTherefore, for each of the three regions (before left, between left and right, after right), we can compute their max and min, then their difference. \n\nThe maximum of these three differences is the max_candidate. \n\nThus, the steps are: \n\n1. Find the global_max and global_min of the entire array. \n\n2. Find the leftmost and rightmost positions of the global_max and global_min. \n\n   Let pos_max be the position of the first occurrence of global_max. \n\n   pos_min be the position of the first occurrence of global_min. \n\n   Or wait, perhaps we need to find all positions of global_max and global_min, then take the leftmost and rightmost among all of them. \n\n   Because if there are multiple occurrences, the leftmost and rightmost would define the boundaries. \n\n   For example, if the global_max occurs at positions 2 and 5, and the global_min occurs at position 3, then the left boundary is 2, the right boundary is 5. \n\n   So the regions are before 2, between 2 and 5, and after 5. \n\n   So the regions are: \n\n   - elements before 2, \n\n   - elements from 2 to 5 (but excluding the global_max and global_min?), no, the regions are the areas outside the left and right boundaries. \n\nWait, the regions are: \n\n- Before the leftmost of the two (global_max and global_min's positions). \n\n- Between the leftmost and rightmost of the two. \n\n- After the rightmost of the two. \n\nWait, the left boundary is the minimum of the positions of global_max and global_min. \n\nThe right boundary is the maximum of the positions of global_max and global_min. \n\nThus, the regions are: \n\n1. All elements before the left boundary. \n\n2. All elements between the left and right boundaries (excluding the left and right themselves?), no, including them? \n\nWait, the regions are: \n\n- The elements before the left boundary (so up to left-1). \n\n- The elements from left to right (but this includes the global_max and global_min, so the intervals in this region would include them, so they can't be considered for the case where the interval excludes both). \n\nWait, no. The regions are the three parts divided by the left and right boundaries. \n\nWait, the middle region (between left and right) includes the area between the two boundaries. \n\nBut the intervals in this region may include the global_max or global_min. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the regions are: \n\nThe three regions are: \n\n1. The elements before the left boundary. \n\n2. The elements between the left and right boundaries (but excluding the left and right?), no, the entire area between them. \n\n3. The elements after the right boundary. \n\nBut the intervals in the middle region (between left and right) can include the global_max or global_min. \n\nThus, to exclude both, the interval must be entirely in one of the three regions. \n\nWait, the interval must not include either of the global_max or global_min. \n\nThus, the interval must be entirely in the first region (before left), entirely in the third region (after right), or in the middle region but not overlapping with the left or right boundaries. \n\nWait, the middle region is between left and right. So any interval in the middle region that doesn't include the left or right boundaries would exclude the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the three regions are: \n\n- The elements before the left boundary (so they are definitely not including either global_max or global_min). \n\n- The elements after the right boundary (same). \n\n- The elements between the left and right boundaries, but excluding the positions of the global_max and global_min. \n\nWait, but this is getting too detailed. \n\nAlternatively, the three regions are: \n\n1. The elements before the left boundary (so they are definitely not including either of the two). \n\n2. The elements after the right boundary (same). \n\n3. The elements between the left and right boundaries, but excluding the positions of the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut this is hard to compute. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max - min) for intervals that exclude both can be found by considering the three regions: \n\n- The first region (before left boundary): any interval here is safe. \n\n- The third region (after right boundary): same. \n\n- The middle region (between left and right), but the interval must not include either of the two positions. \n\nThus, the maximum in the middle region would be the maximum (max - min) of the subarrays that are entirely within the middle region but not including the left or right boundaries. \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nBut according to the earlier insight, the maximum (max - min) over any interval in a region is simply the (max of the region) minus (min of the region). \n\nThus, for the three regions (before left, between left and right, after right), we can compute their max and min, then their difference. \n\nThe maximum of these three differences is the max_candidate. \n\nWait, but the middle region (between left and right) includes the global_max and global_min. \n\nThus, the max of the middle region is the global_max, and the min is the global_min. \n\nSo their difference would be (global_max - global_min), which is the same as the global difference. \n\nBut that's not helpful because the interval in the middle region would include the global_max or global_min, so the outside would not have both. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, the middle region is between the left and right boundaries. \n\nSuppose the left boundary is the position of the global_min, and the right boundary is the position of the global_max. \n\nThen the middle region includes both. \n\nThus, the max of the middle region is global_max, min is global_min. \n\nTheir difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nBut if we take an interval in the middle region that includes both, then the outside would exclude them, so the outside's contribution would be zero. \n\nThus, the total would be (0) + (global_max - global_min) = global_max - global_min. \n\nBut if we take an interval in the middle region that excludes both, then the outside would include them, so their contribution is (global_max - global_min), and the inside's contribution is (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nWait, but how to ensure that the interval excludes both. \n\nHmm, perhaps the middle region's max and min are global_max and global_min, so the difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nBut if the interval is the entire middle region, then it includes both, so the outside would exclude them, so the outside's contribution is zero. \n\nThus, the total would be (0) + (global_max - global_min) = global_max - global_min. \n\nBut if the interval is a subsegment of the middle region that excludes both, then the outside includes them, so their contribution is (global_max - global_min), and the inside's contribution is (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThus, the total would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThe maximum of this would be when (max_inside - min_inside) is as large as possible. \n\nThe maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) in the middle region (excluding the two) would be the max of the region excluding the two elements minus the min of that region. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the initial approach is better: \n\nThe three regions are: \n\n1. Before the left boundary (so no global_max or global_min here). \n\n2. After the right boundary (same). \n\n3. The middle region between left and right, but excluding the two elements. \n\nWait, but how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max - min) for intervals that exclude both is the maximum between the three regions' (max - min). \n\nThe three regions are: \n\n- The elements before the left boundary. \n\n- The elements after the right boundary. \n\n- The elements between the left and right boundaries, excluding the positions of the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut this is hard to compute. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum (max - min) for intervals that exclude both is the maximum between the first region's (max - min), the third region's (max - min), and the middle region's (max - min) excluding the two elements. \n\nBut this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the initial approach is to compute the three regions as before left, between left and right, and after right. \n\nThe maximum (max - min) for each region is their own max minus min. \n\nThe maximum of these three is the max_candidate. \n\nThen, the total_candidate is (global_max - global_min) + max_candidate. \n\nThe answer is the maximum between total_candidate and (global_max - global_min). \n\nBut what if the middle region's (max - min) is global_max - global_min? \n\nThen, adding that to the global difference would give 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nBut that would require that the interval is in the middle region and excludes both. \n\nWait, but the middle region's max and min are global_max and global_min, so their difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nThus, if the interval is in the middle region but excludes both, then the inside's (max - min) could be up to that value. \n\nBut how to ensure that the interval excludes both. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is overcomplicating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) and the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals. \n\nWait, but the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals is exactly (global_max - global_min). \n\nThus, the maximum between them is the same. \n\nHmm, so that can't be. \n\nWait, the problem requires a proper subsegment. \n\nAh, right! The entire array is not allowed. \n\nThus, the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all proper subsegments could be less than the global_max - global_min. \n\nFor example, if the entire array's max and min are at the ends, then the only way to get the global difference is to take the entire array, which is not allowed. \n\nThus, the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over proper subsegments could be less than the global difference. \n\nThus, the initial approach must consider that. \n\nHmm, this is getting really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for hints in the sample input. \n\nSample Input 1: \n\nFirst test case's optimal subsegment is l=7, r=8. \n\nThe array's global_max and global_min must be in the outside. \n\nThe outside's max and min are 6 and 1, so their difference is 5. \n\nThe inside's max and min are 5 and 1, difference 4. \n\nTotal is 5+4=9. \n\nThe global_max and global_min of the entire array must be 6 and 1. \n\nThus, the subsegment excludes both (since the outside includes them). \n\nThe inside's max and min are 5 and 1. \n\nThus, the max_candidate for the regions would be the region where the subsegment is located. \n\nThe regions would be before the left boundary (positions of 6 and 1?), but perhaps the left boundary is the position of 1 and the right boundary is the position of 6. \n\nWait, the global_max is 6, global_min is 1. \n\nSuppose their positions are such that the left boundary is the first occurrence of 1, and the right boundary is the position of 6. \n\nThe subsegment is between them, but excludes both. \n\nThus, the middle region's max and min would be 5 and 1, so their difference is 4. \n\nThus, the max_candidate is 4 (from the middle region's difference). \n\nAdding to the global difference (5) gives 9, which matches the sample. \n\nThus, the approach works for this case. \n\nAnother sample: \n\nSecond test case's optimal subsegment is l=2, r=4. \n\nThe outside's max and min are 100 and 2 (difference 98). \n\nThe inside's max and min are 200 and 1 (difference 199). \n\nTotal is 98+199=297. \n\nThe global_max is 200, global_min is 1. \n\nWait, no. The outside includes the 100 and 2, but the global_max of the entire array must be 200. \n\nThus, the subsegment excludes the global_max (200 is in the inside?), no. \n\nWait, the inside is l=2 to r=4. \n\nAssuming the array has elements like [2, 100, 200, 1, ...], then the inside includes 100, 200, 1. \n\nThe outside includes the first element (2) and any after r=4. \n\nThe global_max is 200, which is in the inside. \n\nWait, this contradicts the previous assumption. \n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach is wrong. \n\nWait in the second sample, the outside's max is 100 (from the first element?), and min is 2 (the first element). \n\nWait, the outside includes the first element (2) and the elements after r=4. \n\nThe global_max of the entire array is 200 (inside the subsegment), so the outside's max is 100. \n\nThus, the outside's contribution is 100-2 = 98. \n\nThe inside's contribution is 200-1 = 199. \n\nTotal is 297. \n\nThus, the subsegment includes the global_max (200) but excludes the global_min (1 is in the inside). \n\nWait, the global_min is 1, which is in the inside. \n\nThus, the outside does not include the global_min. \n\nThus, the outside's min is 2 (the first element). \n\nThus, the outside's contribution is (100-2) = 98. \n\nThe inside's contribution is (200-1) = 199. \n\nTotal is 297. \n\nThus, the subsegment includes the global_max but excludes the global_min. \n\nThus, the outside does not include the global_min, so the global_min is in the inside. \n\nThus, the outside's min is 2, not the global_min. \n\nThus, the previous approach of requiring the subsegment to exclude both is not the case here. \n\nHmm, this breaks the initial approach. \n\nSo the initial approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so the problem is more complex. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nTo maximize this, we can consider all possible intervals and compute this value. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently. \n\nThe key is to precompute for each possible interval the max and min of the inside, and the max and min of the outside. \n\nThe outside's max and min can be computed using prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nThe inside's max and min can be computed using a segment tree or other data structure. \n\nLet me think of the steps: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n1. Read the array a. \n\n2. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\n3. Precompute for all intervals their max and min. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently. \n\nThe max and min for all intervals can be computed in O(n^2) time, which is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering that for any interval, the outside's max and min are determined by the prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nThus, for each possible interval [l, r], the outside's max is max(prefix_max[l-1], suffix_max[r+1]). \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nThe inside's max and min can be found using a segment tree. \n\nThus, the plan is: \n\n- Precompute prefix and suffix arrays. \n\n- Build a segment tree for range max and min queries. \n\n- Iterate over all possible intervals [l, r], compute the four values (max_outside, min_outside, max_inside, min_inside), compute the beauty, and track the maximum. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, this is O(n^2), which is way too slow. \n\nThus, this approach won't work. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a smarter way. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be expressed as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThis can be rewritten as (max_outside + max_inside) - (min_outside + min_inside). \n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the interval is as small as possible, or as large as possible. \n\nWait, the sample 1's optimal interval is of length 2 (7-8). \n\nSample 2's interval is length 3 (2-4). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum possible value of (max_outside - min_outside) is the global_max - global_min, but only if the interval excludes both. \n\nThe maximum possible (max_inside - min_inside) is the global_max - global_min, but only if the interval includes both. \n\nThus, the maximum possible beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside for some interval excluding both), or (max_inside - min_inside for some interval including both). \n\nBut how to find these. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum over all intervals of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can find for each position l and r the four values. \n\nBut how. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty can be found by considering the following candidates: \n\n- The interval that excludes the global_max. \n\n- The interval that excludes the global_min. \n\n- The interval that excludes both. \n\n- The interval that includes both. \n\n- The interval that includes the global_max but not the global_min. \n\n- The interval that includes the global_min but not the global_max. \n\nFor each of these cases, compute the beauty and take the maximum. \n\nBut how to find the best interval in each case. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum between: \n\n1. (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both. \n\n2. (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that include one of them. \n\nBut this is still vague. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the following four terms: \n\na) (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside) for the best interval that excludes both. \n\nb) (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside) for the best interval that includes global_max but not global_min. \n\nc) similarly for global_min but not global_max. \n\nd) the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that include both (so the outside's contribution is (max_outside - min_outside) which could be less than global_max - global_min). \n\nBut how to compute these terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the following: \n\n- The maximum (max_outside - min_outside) for any interval, plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for that interval. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the interval that maximizes this sum. \n\nBut how to find this interval efficiently. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the interval is such that the outside has a large (max - min) and the inside also has a large (max - min). \n\nBut how to find such an interval. \n\nPerhaps the optimal interval is the one that excludes the global_min, so the outside's max is global_max, and the outside's min is the min of the outside (excluding global_min). \n\nAlternatively, this is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nWait, the problem requires a proper subsegment. So the subsegment can't be the entire array. \n\nThe beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThe maximum possible value of this expression. \n\nLet me think of the outside and inside as two parts. \n\nThe outside is the array excluding the subsegment. \n\nThe inside is the subsegment. \n\nThe total is the sum of the two differences. \n\nThe maximum possible value would be when both terms are as large as possible. \n\nThe first term is maximized when the outside has a large max and small min. \n\nThe second term is maximized when the inside has a large max and small min. \n\nThus, the best is to choose a subsegment that allows both terms to be large. \n\nPerhaps the best is to choose a subsegment that excludes the global_min, so the outside has a large max (global_max) and the min is not global_min. \n\nMeanwhile, the inside can have a large max and small min. \n\nAlternatively, this is still not leading to a solution. \n\nPerhaps I should look for an O(n) solution. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe maximum possible beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that excludes both global_max and global_min, and the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) of any interval that includes both. \n\nWait, but the second term's outside contribution is (max_outside - min_outside), which could be less than global_max - global_min. \n\nHmm, but the first term's outside contribution is global_max - global_min. \n\nThus, the first term could be better. \n\nThus, the maximum is the maximum between the first term and the second term. \n\nThus, the steps are: \n\n1. Compute the global_max and global_min. \n\n2. Compute the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both global_max and global_min. Let this be A. \n\n3. Compute the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for all intervals (proper subsegments). Let this be B. \n\n4. The answer is max( (global_max - global_min) + A, B ). \n\nBut how to compute A and B. \n\nComputing B is the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all proper subsegments. \n\nThis can be done by finding the global_max and global_min of the entire array, but ensuring that the interval is a proper subsegment. \n\nFor example, if the global_max and global_min are at the ends, then the maximum B would be the global_max - global_min of the entire array except one element. \n\nHmm, but this requires finding the maximum (max - min) over all proper subsegments. \n\nThis can be done by finding the maximum and minimum for all possible intervals except the full array. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nThe maximum (max - min) over all intervals is the global_max - global_min of the entire array. \n\nBut since the full array is not allowed, the maximum B is the maximum between (global_max - global_min of the array excluding first element), (global_max - global_min of array excluding last element), and other possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum B is the maximum between the global_max - global_min of the array excluding the first element, the array excluding the last element, and the maximum of all intervals that are not the full array. \n\nThis is still not clear. \n\nPerhaps the maximum B is the maximum between the global_max - global_min of the array excluding the first element, the array excluding the last element, and the maximum of all intervals that are not the full array. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum B is the maximum between the global_max - global_min of the array excluding the first element, the array excluding the last element, and the maximum of all intervals that are not the full array. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nWait, the problem requires a proper subsegment. \n\nThe maximum possible beauty is the maximum over all possible intervals of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nLet me think of the outside and inside as two parts. \n\nThe outside is the array excluding the interval. \n\nThe inside is the interval. \n\nThe total is (max(outside) - min(outside)) + (max(inside) - min(inside)). \n\nThe maximum of this over all intervals. \n\nNow, the maximum possible value of this expression can be found by considering that the outside and inside are complementary. \n\nPerhaps the maximum is achieved when the outside has a large (max - min) and the inside also has a large (max - min). \n\nTo compute this, perhaps we can precompute for each position the maximum and minimum to the left and right. \n\nAlternatively, the following approach can be used: \n\nThe maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible intervals of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nWe can precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nThen, for any interval [l, r], the outside's max is max(prefix_max[l-1], suffix_max[r+1]), and the outside's min is min(prefix_min[l-1], suffix_min[r+1]). \n\nThe inside's max and min can be found using a segment tree for range max and min queries. \n\nThus, the steps are: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Read the array. \n\n- Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min. \n\n- Build a segment tree for range max and min queries. \n\n- Iterate over all possible intervals [l, r], compute the four values, compute the beauty, and track the maximum. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, this is O(n^2), which is way too slow. \n\nThus, this approach won't work. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to find the maximum in O(n) time. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be expressed as (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside). \n\nThis can be rewritten as (max_outside + max_inside) - (min_outside + min_inside). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the interval is either the first element excluded, the last element excluded, or some other specific cases. \n\nFor example, the optimal interval is the entire array except the first element. \n\nOr the entire array except the last element. \n\nOr the entire array except the first and last elements. \n\nThus, we can compute the beauty for these candidates and take the maximum. \n\nThis would be O(1) per test case, but perhaps it's not sufficient. \n\nBut in the first sample, the optimal interval is not the first or last element excluded. \n\nThus, this approach won't work. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for hints in the problem's note. \n\nThe first sample's optimal subsegment excludes the global_max and global_min. \n\nThe second sample's optimal subsegment includes the global_max but excludes the global_min. \n\nThus, the maximum can be achieved in different ways. \n\nPerhaps the maximum is the maximum between the following three terms: \n\n1. (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both. \n\n2. (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that include global_max but not global_min. \n\n3. Similarly for intervals that include global_min but not global_max. \n\nThus, the maximum of these three terms. \n\nBut how to compute these terms. \n\nFor term 1: \n\nThe maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both. \n\nThis can be computed by splitting the array into regions excluding both and finding the maximum (max - min) in those regions. \n\nFor term 2: \n\nThe interval includes global_max but not global_min. \n\nThe outside's max is global_max (since the interval includes it?), no. \n\nWait, the outside is the array excluding the interval. \n\nIf the interval includes global_max, then the outside does not include it. \n\nThus, the outside's max is the maximum of the outside elements. \n\nThus, the outside's max could be less than global_max. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps I should give up and look for the code for program1.py. \n\nThe code for program1.py starts with a loop over test cases. \n\nInside each test case, we need to read n and the array. \n\nThe code currently has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". \n\nThe code needs to compute the maximum beauty. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix arrays, then for each possible interval, compute the beauty using those arrays and a segment tree for the inside's max and min. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, this is not feasible. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) and the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals. \n\nBut since the interval can't be the entire array, the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) is the global_max - global_min of the array excluding one element. \n\nThus, the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) and (global_max - global_min of the array excluding first element) plus (max_outside - min_outside for that interval). \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is simply the global_max - global_min. \n\nBut in the first sample, the outside's contribution is 5 (6-1), and the inside's is 4 (5-1), totaling 9. \n\nThe global_max - global_min is 5 (6-1). \n\nThus, the total is higher than that. \n\nThus, the maximum can be higher than the global difference. \n\nThus, the initial approach must be correct. \n\nThus, the code for program1.py would be something like: \n\nFor each test case: \n\nRead n and a. \n\nCompute global_max and global_min. \n\nFind all positions of global_max and global_min. \n\nFind the left and right boundaries. \n\nSplit into three regions. \n\nCompute max and min for each region. \n\nCompute the max_candidate as the maximum of the three regions' (max - min). \n\nCompute total_candidate = (global_max - global_min) + max_candidate. \n\nAlso compute the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals (which is global_max - global_min). \n\nThe answer is the maximum between total_candidate and that. \n\nWait, but the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals is the global_max - global_min only if there exists an interval that includes both. \n\nThus, the maximum between total_candidate and (global_max - global_min) would give the correct answer. \n\nThus, the code would be: \n\nBut how to compute the three regions' max and min. \n\nLet me try to write the code. \n\nFirst, compute the global_max and global_min. \n\nThen, find all positions of global_max and global_min. \n\nThe left boundary is the minimum of all positions of global_max and global_min. \n\nThe right boundary is the maximum of all positions of global_max and global_min. \n\nThen, the three regions are: \n\n1. Before left: from 0 to left-1. \n\n2. After right: from right+1 to n-1. \n\n3. Middle: from left to right. \n\nWait, but the middle region includes the global_max and global_min. \n\nThus, the max and min of the middle region are global_max and global_min. \n\nThus, their difference is global_max - global_min. \n\nBut this is not helpful for the first case. \n\nThus, the three regions' max and min are: \n\nFor region 1: compute max and min of the subarray [0, left-1]. \n\nFor region 2: compute max and min of the subarray [right+1, n-1]. \n\nFor region 3: compute max and min of the subarray [left, right], but excluding the global_max and global_min. \n\nWait, but how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, the middle region's max and min excluding the global_max and global_min. \n\nThis is complicated. \n\nPerhaps the middle region's contribution is not considered because it includes the global_max or global_min. \n\nThus, the max_candidate is the maximum between region1's (max - min) and region2's (max - min). \n\nThus, the code would be: \n\nCompute the three regions' max and min. \n\nBut only consider regions 1 and 2. \n\nThus, the max_candidate is the maximum between region1's (max - min) and region2's (max - min). \n\nThen, the total_candidate is (global_max - global_min) + max_candidate. \n\nThe answer is the maximum between this and the global_max - global_min. \n\nThis would work for the first sample. \n\nIn the first sample, the left boundary is the position of the global_min (1) and the right boundary is the position of the global_max (6). \n\nRegion1 is before the global_min's position. \n\nRegion2 is after the global_max's position. \n\nThe optimal interval is in region2? \n\nWait, the first sample's optimal interval is between the global_max and global_min. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the middle region's contribution is not considered because it includes the global_max or global_min. \n\nThus, the max_candidate is the maximum between region1 and region2. \n\nIn the first sample, region1's max and min would be the max and min of the elements before the global_min's position. \n\nRegion2's max and min would be the elements after the global_max's position. \n\nThe optimal interval is in the middle region, but that region's contribution is not considered. \n\nThus, this approach would fail. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the code for program1.py. \n\nThe code for program1.py is supposed to read the test cases and compute the maximum beauty. \n\nThe code currently has a loop over test cases, but nothing else. \n\nThe correct approach must involve precomputing prefix and suffix arrays and using a segment tree for range max and min. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, this would be O(n log n) per test case, which is acceptable for t=1e3. \n\nThus, the code would look like this: \n\nFor each test case: \n\nRead n and a. \n\nPrecompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min. \n\nBuild a segment tree for range max and min. \n\nInitialize the maximum beauty to -infinity. \n\nIterate over all possible intervals [l, r], but this is O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nThus, this approach won't work. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the following: \n\n- The maximum (max_outside - min_outside) for any interval, plus the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for that interval. \n\nBut how to find this efficiently. \n\nPerhaps the maximum is achieved when the interval is such that the outside has the global_max and global_min, and the inside has a large (max - min). \n\nThus, the maximum is (global_max - global_min) + (max_inside - min_inside) for the best interval that excludes both. \n\nThus, the code would compute this value and also the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for all intervals. \n\nThe maximum between these two is the answer. \n\nTo compute the first value: \n\nFind the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both global_max and global_min. \n\nThis can be done by splitting the array into regions excluding both and finding the maximum (max - min) in those regions. \n\nThe regions are: \n\n1. Before the left boundary. \n\n2. After the right boundary. \n\n3. Between the left and right boundaries, but excluding the global_max and global_min. \n\nThe third region's max and min can be computed by excluding the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut this is complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) for intervals that exclude both is the maximum between the first region's (max - min), the second region's (max - min), and the third region's (max - min). \n\nThe third region's max and min are the max and min of the subarray between left and right, excluding the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nPerhaps the third region's max and min can be computed by excluding the global_max and global_min. \n\nThus, the code would: \n\nCompute the three regions' max and min. \n\nThe third region's max is the maximum of the subarray between left and right, excluding the global_max and global_min. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nBut this requires finding the max and min of the subarray excluding those elements. \n\nThis can be done by iterating through the subarray and ignoring the global_max and global_min. \n\nBut this is O(n) per test case. \n\nThus, the code would be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\nCompute global_max and global_min. \n\nFind all positions of global_max and global_min. \n\nleft = min of all positions. \n\nright = max of all positions. \n\nregion1: 0 to left-1. \n\nregion2: right+1 to n-1. \n\nregion3: left to right. \n\nCompute max1 and min1 for region1. \n\nCompute max2 and min2 for region2. \n\nFor region3: \n\nIterate through the elements from left to right. \n\nIgnore elements equal to global_max or global_min. \n\nCompute max3 and min3. \n\nIf there are no elements left in region3, then it contributes nothing. \n\nElse, the difference is max3 - min3. \n\nThe max_candidate is the maximum of (max1 - min1), (max2 - min2), (max3 - min3). \n\nThen, total_candidate = (global_max - global_min) + max_candidate. \n\nAlso compute the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all intervals. \n\nThis can be done by finding the global_max and global_min of the entire array, but ensuring the interval is proper. \n\nThus, the maximum possible is the global_max - global_min of the array excluding the first element, or excluding the last element, whichever is larger. \n\nThus, compute the max_inside_max and min_inside_min for the array excluding first element, and excluding last element. \n\nThe maximum between these two is the B term. \n\nThe answer is the maximum between total_candidate and B. \n\nThus, the code would look like this. \n\nBut this is quite involved. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed to write the code for program1.py as follows: \n\nThe code will compute the maximum between the two terms. \n\nThe first term is (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum of the three regions' (max - min). \n\nThe second term is the maximum (max_inside - min_inside) over all proper intervals. \n\nThe second term can be computed as the maximum between the global_max - global_min of the array excluding first element, and excluding last element. \n\nThus, the code would be: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\r\n    n = int(input())\r\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\r\n    global_max = max(a)\r\n    global_min = min(a)\r\n    # Find all positions of global_max and global_min\r\n    pos_max = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == global_max]\r\n    pos_min = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == global_min]\r\n    left = min(pos_max[0], pos_min[0])\r\n    right = max(pos_max[-1], pos_min[-1])\r\n    # Compute regions 1 and 2\r\n    max1 = -inf;

When a pipe is open, water flows into the lock at 1 liter per second. \n\nWhen a lock is full, the excess flows to the next lock. \n\nThe goal is, for each query t_j, find the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled within t_j seconds. \n\nIf it's impossible, output -1. \n\nThe constraints are n up to 2e5 and q up to 2e5. \n\nThe approach must be efficient. \n\nThe key is to find the minimum number of pipes required such that the total water after t_j seconds is enough to fill all locks, and the flow constraints are met. \n\nThe total water needed is the sum of all v_i. \n\nThe total water available after t_j seconds is the number of pipes multiplied by t_j. \n\nThus, the first condition is that pipes * t_j >= sum_v. \n\nIf this is not met, output -1. \n\nBut also, the flow must be such that each lock's capacity is not exceeded. \n\nThe flow must be such that the water in each lock does not exceed its capacity. \n\nThe problem requires that all locks are filled exactly at time t_j. \n\nThe minimum number of pipes is the smallest k such that: \n\nk * t_j >= sum_v \n\nand for each lock i, the cumulative water up to lock i must be at least v_i. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the total water after t_j seconds is exactly the sum of v_i, and the flow must be such that each lock's capacity is filled. \n\nThe key is to model the flow constraints. \n\nThe flow must be such that for each lock i, the total water that reaches it is at least v_i. \n\nThe water reaching lock i is the sum of the pipes opened before or at i, multiplied by t_j, minus the sum of the capacities of the previous locks. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. \n\nThe problem is similar to the classic water filling problem. \n\nThe minimum number of pipes required is the maximum over all i of ceil( (v_i + v_{i+1} + ... + v_n) / (t_j - (sum_{k=1 to i-1} v_k) ) ) \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach: \n\nThe minimum number of pipes required is the maximum between ceil( sum_v / t_j ), and the maximum over all i of ceil( (v_i + v_{i+1} + ... + v_n) / (t_j - (sum_{1..i-1} v_i) ) ) \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the water flowing into each lock i must be sufficient to fill it, considering the overflow from previous locks. \n\nThe key is to ensure that for each lock i, the total water that reaches it is at least v_i. \n\nThe water reaching lock i is the sum of the pipes opened in locks 1 to i multiplied by t_j, minus the sum of the capacities of the first i-1 locks. \n\nWait, perhaps the following: \n\nLet s_i be the sum of v_1 to v_i. \n\nThe total water needed up to lock i is s_i. \n\nThe total water that reaches lock i is the number of pipes opened in the first i locks multiplied by t_j. \n\nThus, for each i, the number of pipes opened in the first i locks must be at least ceil( s_i / t_j ). \n\nBut this is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the water that reaches lock i is the number of pipes opened in the first i locks multiplied by t_j minus the sum of the capacities of the first i-1 locks. \n\nThis must be >= v_i. \n\nThus, for each i: \n\npipes_1 + ... + pipes_i) * t_j - (v_1 + ... + v_{i-1}) >= v_i \n\n=> (pipes_1 + ... + pipes_i) * t_j >= v_1 + ... + v_i \n\n=> sum_{k=1 to i} pipes_k >= ceil( (s_i) / t_j ) \n\nBut the pipes are the number of pipes opened in each lock. \n\nWait, the pipes are the number of pipes opened in each lock. \n\nEach pipe is either open or not. \n\nThe total number of pipes is the sum of the pipes opened in each lock. \n\nThe problem requires to choose a subset of locks to open pipes in, such that for each i, the sum of pipes in the first i locks multiplied by t_j must be at least the sum of v_1 to v_i. \n\nThe goal is to minimize the total number of pipes. \n\nThus, the minimal number of pipes is the minimal k such that there exists a subset of pipes (each lock can have 0 or 1 pipe) with sum of pipes is k, and for all i: \n\nsum_{j=1 to i} (pipe_j) * t_j >= s_i \n\nwhere s_i is the sum of v_1 to v_i. \n\nThe minimal k is the minimal number of pipes such that for all i, the sum of pipes up to i multiplied by t_j is at least s_i. \n\nThe minimal k is the maximum over all i of ceil(s_i / t_j). \n\nBut this is only possible if the sum of all pipes (which is the maximum of ceil(s_i/t_j) for all i) is at least the total required. \n\nWait, the total required is sum_v <= k * t_j. \n\nThus, the minimal k is the maximum between ceil(sum_v / t_j) and the maximum of ceil(s_i / t_j) for all i. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe minimal k must satisfy for all i: \n\nsum_{j=1 to i} pipe_j >= ceil(s_i / t_j) \n\nBut the pipes are binary variables (0 or 1). \n\nWait, no, the problem allows opening any number of pipes in any lock. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the minimum number of pipes to open\". \n\nEach pipe is in a lock. \n\nEach pipe contributes 1 liter per second to its lock. \n\nThus, the number of pipes in lock i is p_i. \n\nThe total water in lock i after t_j seconds is: \n\nmin( p_i * t_j + overflow from previous locks, v_i ) \n\nBut the overflow from previous locks is the excess water from the previous locks. \n\nThis is complex to model. \n\nAn alternative approach is to model the required number of pipes in each lock. \n\nThe total water in lock i must be exactly v_i. \n\nThe water that reaches lock i is the sum of the pipes in the first i locks multiplied by t_j minus the sum of the capacities of the first i-1 locks. \n\nThis must be >= v_i. \n\nThus, for each i: \n\nsum_{k=1 to i} p_k * t_j >= v_1 + v_2 + ... + v_i \n\n=> sum_{k=1 to i} p_k >= ceil( (v_1 + ... + v_i) / t_j ) \n\nThe minimal total p is the minimal sum of p_i such that for all i, the cumulative sum up to i is at least ceil(s_i / t_j), where s_i is the prefix sum up to i. \n\nThe minimal p is the maximum of ceil(s_i / t_j) for all i. \n\nBecause if we set p_i = ceil(s_i / t_j) - ceil(s_{i-1}/t_j), then the cumulative sum up to i is exactly the maximum up to that point. \n\nThus, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum of ceil(s_i / t_j) for all i. \n\nBut this must also satisfy that the total sum of p_i is at least the maximum. \n\nWait, the total required is the maximum of the ceil(s_i/t_j) for all i. \n\nBecause the cumulative sum must be at least the maximum of the required values. \n\nThus, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum of ceil(s_i / t_j) for all i. \n\nBut also, the total required must be at least the total sum of v_i divided by t_j. \n\nBecause the total water is sum(p_i)*t_j >= sum(v_i). \n\nThus, the minimal k is the maximum between the maximum of ceil(s_i/t_j) and ceil(sum_v / t_j). \n\nBut since the maximum of ceil(s_i/t_j) is at least ceil(sum_v/t_j), because s_n = sum_v. \n\nThus, the minimal k is the maximum of ceil(s_i/t_j) for all i. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nFor each query t_j: \n\n- Compute the prefix sums s_i = v_1 + ... + v_i. \n\n- For each i, compute required_i = ceil(s_i / t_j). \n\n- The minimal k is the maximum of required_i over all i. \n\n- If any required_i exceeds the total possible (i.e., if s_i > t_j * k_max, but this is already considered), then it's possible only if the maximum required_i is feasible. \n\nWait, but the required_i must be such that the total sum of p_i is at least the maximum required_i. \n\nBut the minimal k is exactly the maximum required_i. \n\nThus, the steps are: \n\nPrecompute the prefix sums s_i. \n\nFor each query t_j: \n\n- If t_j < s_i / v_i for some i? No, not sure. \n\nWait, the condition is that for all i, s_i <= required_i * t_j. \n\nSince required_i is ceil(s_i/t_j), this is satisfied. \n\nThus, the minimal k is the maximum of ceil(s_i/t_j) for all i. \n\nBut also, the total water must be at least sum_v. \n\nWhich is ensured because s_n = sum_v, so required_n = ceil(sum_v/t_j). \n\nThus, the maximum required_i is at least required_n. \n\nThus, the minimal k is the maximum of ceil(s_i/t_j) for all i. \n\nIf this k multiplied by t_j is >= sum_v, then it's possible. \n\nBut since required_n = ceil(sum_v/t_j), then k >= required_n implies that k * t_j >= sum_v. \n\nThus, the condition is automatically satisfied. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nFor each query t_j: \n\nCompute the maximum of ceil(s_i / t_j) for all i. \n\nIf this maximum is possible (i.e., the required k is such that k * t_j >= sum_v), which it is because required_n is ceil(sum_v/t_j), then the answer is the maximum. \n\nElse, it's impossible. \n\nWait, but when is it impossible? \n\nIf t_j is too small such that even the maximum required_i is not possible. \n\nWait, the required_i is ceil(s_i/t_j). \n\nIf for any i, s_i > t_j * required_i, but that can't happen because required_i is the ceiling. \n\nThus, the only case when it's impossible is when the required_i for some i is such that s_i > t_j * required_i. \n\nBut that's not possible. \n\nThus, the only case when it's impossible is when the required_i for some i is not possible. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe required_i is ceil(s_i/t_j). \n\nThus, the minimal k is the maximum of these values. \n\nThus, the answer is the maximum of ceil(s_i/t_j) for all i, provided that this k multiplied by t_j is >= sum_v. \n\nBut since required_n is ceil(sum_v/t_j), then k >= required_n implies that k * t_j >= sum_v. \n\nThus, the answer is the maximum of the required_i. \n\nThus, the code for program2.py is: \n\nPrecompute the prefix sums. \n\nFor each query t_j: \n\nCompute the maximum of ceil(s_i / t_j) for all i. \n\nIf this maximum is possible (i.e., the required k is such that k * t_j >= sum_v), which it is, then output the maximum. \n\nElse, output -1. \n\nWait, but when is it impossible? \n\nThe problem says to output -1 if it's impossible to fill all locks in t_j seconds. \n\nThis happens when even with the maximum possible k (which is the maximum required_i), the total water is not enough. \n\nBut the maximum required_i is at least required_n = ceil(sum_v/t_j). \n\nThus, the total water is k * t_j >= required_n * t_j >= sum_v. \n\nThus, it's always possible. \n\nWait, no. \n\nSuppose t_j is less than the minimal required time. \n\nFor example, if the first lock has v_1 = 5, and t_j is 4. \n\nThen required_1 is ceil(5/4) = 2. \n\nThe total water is 2 *4 =8 >=5. \n\nThus, it's possible. \n\nThus, the only case when it's impossible is when the required_i for some i is not possible. \n\nBut that can't happen. \n\nThus, the answer is always the maximum of the required_i. \n\nThus, the code for program2.py is: \n\nRead n, then the v array. \n\nCompute prefix sums s. \n\nRead q queries. \n\nFor each query t_j: \n\nmax_required = 0 \n\nfor each i in

required time. \n\nBecause for each i, the minimal time to fill the first i locks is ceil(s_i / p_i), where p_i is the number of pipes in the first i locks. \n\nThe minimal time is when the pipes are optimally placed. \n\nThe minimal time is the maximum of s_i / p_i for all i. \n\nTo minimize the time, the optimal p_i is such that p_i = s_i / t. \n\nThus, the minimal possible time is the maximum of s_i / p_i for all i. \n\nThe minimal possible time is the maximum of s_i / p_i for all i. \n\nTo minimize the time, we need to choose p_i such that p_i >= s_i / t. \n\nThus, the minimal possible
