The second term is 1 if z_n (which includes this 0) is <=n-1 \u2192 since z_n would be previous zeros plus 1 (if this is 0). Wait, but the previous zeros are the zeros in the first n-1 elements.

The solve function uses binary search to find the minimal m where cnt[m] >=n. The code has a TODO in the binary search part. The current code for solve: \n\ndef solve(sn): \n\n    t = int(sn) \n\n    s, e = 0, len(cnt) -1 \n\n    while s <e: \n\n        m = (s+e)>>1 \n\n        if cnt[m] >=t: \n\n            e =m \n\n        else: \n\n            # TODO: Your code here \n\n    return str(s) The missing part is the else clause. The else case is when cnt[m] <t \u2192 so we need to search the right half. Thus, the code should set s = m+1. So the missing code is: \n\ns = m+1 Thus, the program3's missing code is s = m+1. Putting it all together: \n\nThe three missing parts are: \n\nprogram1: a[j] =0 \n\nprogram2: tt = [l[0]+r[0]+1, l[1]*r[1]] \n\nprogram3: s = m+1 \n\nWait, but for program2's missing code, the exact line is needed. Looking back at the code for program2: The code has: \n\nif l[0] ==0: \n\n    r = (d[j][k+lt] if j >=k+lt else None) or [0,1] \n\n    tt = d[j][i] \n\n    if tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\n    elif tt[0] == l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n        tt[1] = tt[1] + r[1] \n\n    d[j][i] = tt \n\nThe 'TODO' is inside the first if condition.",

So inside the first if condition (tt is None or current steps are better), the code should set tt to the new value. Thus, the missing code is: \n\ntt = [l[0] + r[0] +1, l[1] * r[1]] So the code becomes: \n\nif tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n    tt = [l[0] + r[0] +1, l[1] * r[1]] \n\nelif ... Thus, the missing code for program2 is that line. So the three missing parts are: \n\nprogram1: a[j] =0 \n\nprogram2: tt = [l[0]+r[0]+1, l[1] * r[1]] \n\nprogram3: s = m+1 Thus, the final answer is the JSON with these three strings.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. Starting with program1.py. The problem is to find the original binary array A given the sum array C. The approach in the code seems to be trying to reconstruct A by iterating through each element and adjusting based on the counts. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py, there's a loop over each element, and some variables like j and a[i] are being manipulated. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\" in the part where j is being checked. The current code initializes a as all 1s. Then for each i, it checks if j (which is c[i]) is 0 or a[i] is 0. If so, it adds i to j. Then if j < n, there's a missing part. \n\nHmm, maybe the idea is to track how many times each position was included in the sorted prefixes. Since each B_k is the first k elements sorted, the sum C[i] is the number of times the i-th element was in the first k elements for k >= i's position in the sorted array. Wait, perhaps the approach is to work backwards. Let me think differently. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach might involve determining the number of 0s and 1s in A. Since each B_k is the first k elements sorted, the sum C[i] for position i is the number of times the i-th element was in the first k elements when sorted. Wait, maybe the key is that for each position i, the number of times it's a 0 in the sorted arrays up to k >= i's position. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the array A by considering that for each position i, the number of times it was part of the first k elements when sorted. Since the sorted first k elements are arranged with 0s first, the 0s in A's first k elements contribute to the sum. \n\nWait, maybe the approach is to start from the end. Let me think of the example given. For the sample input where C is [0,2,2,4], the correct A is [0,1,0,1]. Let's see how that works. \n\nAnother idea: For each position i, the value a[i] is 0 if the number of times it was in the first k elements (sorted) as 0 is such that... Hmm, perhaps the sum C[i] can be expressed in terms of the number of 0s before it. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that for each k from 1 to n, the first k elements of A are sorted, and then each B_k contributes to the sum. The sum C is the sum over all B_k's elements. \n\nThe key insight might be that the sum C[i] is equal to the number of k's (from 1 to n) where, in the sorted first k elements of A, the i-th element of B_k is 0 or 1. Wait, no. Each B_k is the sorted first k elements. So for each k, the elements of B_k are the first k elements of A sorted. The sum C is the sum over all B_1 to B_n of their elements. \n\nSo for each position i in the original array A, the element a_i contributes to the sum C[j] in the B_k arrays where j is the position of a_i in the sorted first k elements. \n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think of the problem in reverse. Suppose we want to reconstruct A such that when we compute all B_k and sum them, we get C. \n\nAn alternative approach is to note that the sum C can be represented in terms of the number of 0s and 1s in the array. Let me think of the contribution of each element a_i to the sum. \n\nSuppose a_i is 0. Then, in all B_k where k >= i's position in the sorted first k elements. Wait, maybe the contribution of a_i being 0 is the number of k where, when considering the first k elements, a_i is among the first m 0s in the sorted list. \n\nAlternatively, for each position i, the number of times a_i is included in the first k elements (for k >= i's position in the sorted array) as a 0 or 1. \n\nAlternatively, the sum C[i] is the number of times the i-th element of A was in the first k elements when sorted, but that's not exactly right. Wait, no. Each B_k is the sorted first k elements. The i-th element of B_k is part of the sum for the i-th position in the C array? Wait no, the B arrays are of length n each. Wait, the problem says that B is the array where the first k elements are sorted, and the rest are as in A. Wait, no, the problem says \"the first k elements of A are sorted in non-decreasing order\". So the entire array B has the first k elements sorted, and the rest are the same as A. \n\nWait, the example given in the problem: \n\nOriginal A is [0,1,0,1]. \n\nB_1 is [0,1,0,1] (sorted first 1 elements: just the first element, so [0], then the rest are same as A. So the first element is 0, others same. So B_1 is [0,1,0,1]. \n\nB_2 is the first two elements sorted: [0,1], so the array becomes [0,1,0,1]. \n\nB_3 is first three elements sorted: [0,0,1], so the array is [0,0,1,1]. \n\nB_4 is the entire array sorted, so [0,0,1,1]. \n\nThe sum C is the sum of all B_1 to B_4. \n\nSo each element in C is the sum of the corresponding elements in all B_k arrays. \n\nThe key is to find A such that when you compute all B_k arrays and sum them, you get C. \n\nThe approach in the code given starts with a array initialized to all 1s. Then for each i, it's trying to adjust based on the c[i] value. \n\nLooking at the code's current state: \n\na = [1] * n \n\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = c[i]\n    if j ==0 or a[i] ==0:\n        j +=i\n    if j <n:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is to track the number of 0s required. Let me think of the process. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. For each position i, the number of times it is a 0 in the B_k arrays. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to compute the number of 0s in the first k elements. \n\nWait, here's an idea: For each position i, the value a[i] is 0 if the number of times it was included in the first k elements (for k >= i) as a 0 in the sorted array. \n\nAlternatively, the sum C[i] can be expressed as the number of k's where, in the first k elements of A, the element at position i (when sorted) is 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the number of 0s in the first k elements for each k. Let me think of the following: \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each k, the number of 0s in the first k elements of A as z[k]. Then, the sorted first k elements will have the first z[k] elements as 0 and the rest as 1. \n\nTherefore, for each position i in the original array, the contribution to C[i] is the number of k where, in the sorted first k elements, the element at position i in the B_k array is 0 or 1. \n\nWait, but the B_k array's elements are the sorted first k elements followed by the rest of A. So the first k elements are sorted, but the rest are as in A. \n\nWait, the B_k array is formed by taking the first k elements of A, sorting them, and then appending the remaining elements (unchanged). \n\nTherefore, the element at position i in B_k is: \n\n- If i <=k: it's the (i)th element in the sorted first k elements. \n\n- Else: it's the same as A[i]. \n\nTherefore, the sum C[i] is the sum over all k from 1 to n of B_k[i]. \n\nSo for each position i, the contribution to C[i] is: \n\nIf i is in the first k elements (for each k >=i), then the value in B_k[i] is the (i)th element in the sorted first k elements. \n\nWait, no. For example, when k is less than i, then the element at position i in B_k is the same as in A. \n\nWait, let me clarify: \n\nFor a given k, the B_k array is: \n\nsorted(A[0..k-1]) followed by A[k], A[k+1], ..., A[n-1]. \n\nTherefore, for position i in B_k: \n\nif i <k: it's part of the sorted first k elements. \n\nelse: it's the same as A[i]. \n\nTherefore, the value at position i in B_k is: \n\nif i <k: the (i)th element in the sorted first k elements. \n\nelse: A[i]. \n\nTherefore, the sum C[i] is the sum over all k from 1 to n of B_k[i]. \n\nBreaking this down: \n\nFor each position i, the contribution to C[i] comes from two parts: \n\n1. When k <i: then B_k[i] = A[i]. \n\n2. When k >=i: then B_k[i] is the (i)th element in the sorted first k elements. \n\nWait, no. Wait, when k is the current k, and i is the position. \n\nWait, for k <i: the element at position i in B_k is A[i], since the first k elements are sorted, but the rest (including position i) are as in A. \n\nFor k >=i: the element at position i in B_k is the i-th element in the sorted first k elements. \n\nTherefore, the total contribution to C[i] is: \n\nsum_{k=1 to i-1} A[i] (since for those k, B_k[i] = A[i]) \n\nplus \n\nsum_{k=i to n} (the i-th element in the sorted first k elements of A). \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. \n\nThe problem requires us to find A such that this sum equals the given C array. \n\nThe key is to find A such that when you compute all these sums, you get C. \n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem in terms of the number of 0s and 1s in the first k elements. \n\nLet me think of the sorted first k elements. The first z elements are 0, then the rest are 1, where z is the number of 0s in the first k elements of A. \n\nTherefore, for any position i in the first k elements, the value in B_k[i] is 0 if i <= z, else 1. \n\nTherefore, for each position i, the contribution from the k >=i terms is: \n\nfor each k from i to n: \n\nif the number of 0s in the first k elements of A is >=i \u2192 then B_k[i] is 0 \n\nelse \u2192 1 \n\nWait, no. The i-th element in the sorted first k elements is 0 if there are at least i 0s in the first k elements. \n\nWait, the sorted array has all 0s first. So the i-th element is 0 if the number of 0s in the first k elements is at least i. \n\nSo for each k >=i, the value B_k[i] is 0 if the number of 0s in the first k elements of A is >=i, else 1. \n\nTherefore, the total contribution to C[i] is: \n\nsum_{k=1 to i-1} A[i] \n\n+ sum_{k=i to n} (0 if z_k >=i else 1), where z_k is the number of 0s in first k elements of A. \n\nHmm, this seems manageable. \n\nThe problem is to find A such that this equals C[i]. \n\nLet me think of the variables. Let's denote A as a binary array. Let z_k be the number of 0s in the first k elements of A. \n\nThen, for each i, the contribution from the first part (k <i) is (i-1)*A[i], since for each k from 1 to i-1, the term is A[i]. \n\nThe second part is the sum over k from i to n of (0 if z_k >=i else 1). \n\nWait, no. The second part is sum_{k=i to n} (0 if z_k >=i else 1). \n\nWait, the term is 0 if z_k >=i \u2192 so the contribution is 0, else 1. \n\nSo the total contribution for the second part is the number of k in [i, n] where z_k <i. \n\nWait, because for each such k, the term is 1, and when z_k >=i, it's 0. \n\nSo the second part is the count of k in [i, n] where z_k <i. \n\nTherefore, the total C[i] is: \n\nA[i]*(i-1) + (number of k in [i, n] where z_k <i) \n\nWe need to find A such that this holds for all i. \n\nHmm, this seems like a system of equations. \n\nThe variables are the A[i], and the z_k's are dependent on the A's. \n\nThis seems challenging. \n\nPerhaps we can model this in reverse. Let's process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nSuppose we process i from n down to 1. \n\nLet me think of the variables. \n\nLet me denote for each position i, the value of A[i] is 0 or 1. \n\nLet me also track the cumulative number of zeros up to position k. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to find the positions where A[i] is 0 or 1 such that the equations hold. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each i, the second term (the count of k >=i where z_k <i) must be equal to (C[i] - A[i]*(i-1)). \n\nLet me denote S_i = C[i] - A[i]*(i-1). \n\nThen S_i must equal the number of k in [i, n] where z_k <i. \n\nHmm, but how do we model this? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the variables z_1, z_2, ..., z_n. \n\nEach z_k is the number of 0s in the first k elements of A. \n\nSo z_1 = A[0] (assuming 0-based) is 0 or 1. \n\nWait, if A is 0-based, then z_k = sum_{j=0 to k-1} (1 - A[j]). Wait no, A[j] is 0 or 1. So the number of 0s in first k elements is sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (A[j] ==0 ? 1 :0). \n\nAlternatively, z_k = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (1 - A[j]). \n\nWait, if A[j] is 0, then 1 - A[j] is 1. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo z_k = sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (1 - A[j]). \n\nNow, the problem is to find A such that for each i (1-based?), the equation holds. \n\nWait, the problem uses 1-based indices? Let me check the problem's example. \n\nIn the example given, the input C is [0,2,2,4], which corresponds to the sum of the B arrays. \n\nWait, the example's A is [0,1,0,1], which is 0-based. \n\nThe first element (0-based) is 0, so in the first B_1 (k=1), the first element is 0. \n\nSo the equations must be set up correctly. \n\nLet me reindex everything to 0-based for easier coding. \n\nLet me restate the equations in 0-based indices. \n\nFor each i (0-based), the contribution to C[i] is: \n\nsum_{k=1 to i} (A[i]) \u2192 because for k from 1 to i (since k < i+1?), wait, no. \n\nWait, in 0-based terms, the position is i. \n\nThe first part is the sum over k from 1 to i (since k must be < i+1 (since k < i+1 \u2192 k <=i). \n\nWait, the first part is for k from 1 to i (since k < i+1 \u2192 k <=i). \n\nWait, the first part is the sum over k from 1 to i of A[i], since for those k, the element at position i in B_k is A[i]. \n\nThe second part is the sum over k from i+1 to n-1 (since k >=i+1 \u2192 because in 0-based, the k must be >=i+1 to have i <k). \n\nWait, in 0-based terms, for k >=i+1, the element at position i in B_k is part of the sorted first k elements. \n\nSo the second part is the sum over k from (i+1) to n (since k can be up to n, but in 0-based, the array has length n, so k ranges from 1 to n). \n\nWait, the total contribution to C[i] is: \n\nsum_{k=1 to i} A[i] \u2192 because for those k, the element at position i is A[i]. \n\nPlus \n\nsum_{k=i+1 to n} (0 if z_k >= (i+1) else 1). \n\nWait, because in the sorted first k elements (0-based up to k-1?), the i-th position (0-based) in the first k elements is 0 if there are at least (i+1) zeros? \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nIn the sorted first k elements (0-based up to k-1), the elements are arranged as 0s followed by 1s. \n\nThe i-th element (0-based) in the first k elements is 0 if the number of zeros in the first k elements (z_k) is greater than i. \n\nWait, because the first z_k elements are 0. So the i-th element is 0 if i < z_k. \n\nWait, for example, if z_k is 3, then elements 0,1,2 are 0, and 3 and beyond are 1. \n\nSo the i-th element (0-based) in the first k elements is 0 if i < z_k, else 1. \n\nTherefore, for the second part (k >=i+1, since the position i is within the first k elements when k>i), the value is 0 if z_k >i (since i < z_k \u2192 0), else 1. \n\nWait, the condition is whether the i-th element in the first k elements (sorted) is 0 or 1. \n\nSo the value is 0 if z_k >i \u2192 because the first z_k elements are 0, so the i-th is 0 if i < z_k. \n\nWait, yes. So the value is 0 if i < z_k \u2192 so the condition is z_k >i. \n\nTherefore, the second part is the number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i. \n\nWait, because when z_k <=i, then the i-th element is 1. \n\nWait, the value is 1 when z_k <=i. \n\nSo the second part is the count of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i. \n\nTherefore, the total C[i] is: \n\nA[i] * i (since the first part is sum_{k=1 to i} A[i] \u2192 there are i terms (k from 1 to i) \u2192 so A[i] multiplied by i) \n\nplus \n\ncount of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i \n\n= C[i] \n\nSo the equation is: \n\nA[i] * i + (number of k in [i+1, n] with z_k <=i) = C[i] \n\nHmm, this is a key equation. \n\nNow, the problem is to find A such that this holds for all i from 0 to n-1. \n\nThe variables are A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-1], and z_k is the cumulative count of zeros up to k elements. \n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps we can find a way to compute A in reverse. \n\nLet me think of processing from the end to the beginning. \n\nSuppose we process i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step, we can decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1, and track the required conditions. \n\nLet me see. \n\nSuppose we process i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step, we can compute the required value of A[i], based on the current state. \n\nLet me think of the variables. \n\nLet me denote for each position i, the current count of zeros up to i (but not including i yet?), or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the cumulative zeros up to position k. \n\nWait, z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements (indices 0 to k-1). \n\nWait, z_1 = A[0] ==0 ? 1 :0 \n\nz_2 = z_1 + (A[1]==0 ?1:0) \n\nand so on. \n\nSo z_k = z_{k-1} + (A[k-1] ==0 ?1:0) \n\nWait, yes. \n\nSo z is a cumulative sum. \n\nNow, the problem is to find A such that for each i, the equation holds. \n\nLet me think of the equation again: \n\nA[i] * i + (number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i) = C[i] \n\nThe term (number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i) depends on the z values for k from i+1 to n. \n\nBut since z_k is cumulative, this term is hard to compute directly. \n\nPerhaps we can model this in reverse. \n\nSuppose we process i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step, we can decide A[i], and track the required conditions. \n\nLet me see. \n\nSuppose we start with i = n-1. \n\nThe equation for i =n-1 is: \n\nA[i] * (n-1) + (number of k in [n, n] where z_k <= (n-1)) \n\nWait, since i+1 =n, so k can be n. \n\nz_n is the total number of zeros in the entire array. \n\nThe term is 1 if z_n <= (n-1), else 0. \n\nBut z_n can be at most n (if all are zeros). \n\nSo the term is 1 if z_n <=n-1 \u2192 which is always true except when z_n =n. \n\nBut since the problem states that a valid A exists, so this term is either 0 or 1. \n\nBut for i =n-1, the equation is: \n\nA[i]*(n-1) + (if z_n <=n-1 then 1 else 0) = C[i] \n\nHmm, but how do we know what z_n is? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track the possible values of z as we go. \n\nLet me think of the variables we can track. \n\nSuppose we process from the end. \n\nLet me denote for each position i, after deciding A[i], we can track the current cumulative zeros up to i. \n\nWait, but since we are going backward, perhaps we can track the cumulative zeros from the end. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nAt each step i, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nWe also track the current cumulative zeros from i to n-1. \n\nWait, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the variables as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, after processing up to i, the cumulative zeros from i to n-1. \n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following: \n\nThe term (number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i) can be rewritten as the count of k in [i+1, n] where the number of zeros in the first k elements is <=i. \n\nBut since z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements, which includes A[0] to A[k-1]. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. \n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the second term (the count) can be expressed in terms of the cumulative zeros. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process the array from the end. \n\nLet me denote for each position i, the current cumulative zeros from the start up to i. \n\nWait, but that's forward. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the minimal required number of zeros in the first (i+1) elements (since z_{i+1} is the number of zeros in first i+1 elements). \n\nWait, perhaps this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation again. \n\nThe equation for i is: \n\nA[i] * i + (number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i) = C[i] \n\nLet me denote the second term as S_i. \n\nSo S_i = C[i] - A[i] * i \n\nWe need S_i to be equal to the number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i. \n\nNow, S_i must be non-negative, since it's a count. \n\nAlso, since the problem states that a solution exists, we can proceed. \n\nNow, the question is, how to choose A[i] such that this holds. \n\nSuppose we process i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step, we can decide A[i], and track the required conditions. \n\nLet me see for the last element (i =n-1). \n\nThe equation is: \n\nA[i]*(n-1) + (number of k in [n, n] where z_n <= (n-1)) = C[i] \n\nThe term for k =n is z_n (the total zeros in the array) <= (n-1). \n\nSo the term is 1 if z_n <=n-1, else 0. \n\nBut z_n is the total zeros in the array. \n\nSuppose we choose A[i] (the last element) to be 0 or 1. \n\nLet me see: \n\nSuppose we set A[i] to 0. \n\nThen the first term is (n-1)*0 =0. \n\nThe second term is 1 if z_n (which includes this 0) is <=n-1 \u2192 since z_n would be previous zeros plus 1 (if this is 0). \n\nWait, but the previous zeros are the zeros in the first n-1 elements. \n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps there's a smarter way. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe second term S_i = C[i] - A[i] *i \n\nmust be equal to the number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i. \n\nNow, note that z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nSuppose we process from the end. \n\nLet me think of the variables as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current number of zeros in the first (i) elements (but not including the current i?), or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the minimal number of zeros required in the first (i+1) elements. \n\nWait, perhaps this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step, we can decide A[i], and track the cumulative zeros up to that point. \n\nLet me denote the cumulative zeros up to position i (including A[i]) as z_i. \n\nWait, but z_i is the number of zeros in the first (i+1) elements (since 0-based). \n\nWait, z_{i+1} = z_i + (A[i] ==0 ?1:0). \n\nHmm, so z_{i+1} = z_i + (A[i] is 0). \n\nWait, but processing backward, perhaps we can track the cumulative zeros from the end. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the current cumulative zeros from the start up to i. \n\nBut since we are processing backward, perhaps we can track the cumulative zeros from the end. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step, we can decide A[i], and track the cumulative zeros up to i (i.e., the number of zeros in A[0..i]). \n\nLet me denote this as z_i. \n\nWait, but z_i is the number of zeros in the first (i+1) elements. \n\nSo when processing i, we can decide A[i], and then z_i = z_{i-1} + (A[i] is 0 ?1:0). \n\nWait, but processing backward, perhaps we can track the cumulative zeros from the end. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can process the array from the end to the beginning, and track the current cumulative zeros. \n\nLet me denote the current cumulative zeros as 'current_zeros'. \n\nInitially, current_zeros =0 (since we haven't processed any elements yet). \n\nWhen processing i from n-1 down to 0: \n\nWe can choose A[i] to be 0 or 1. \n\nIf we choose A[i] =0, then current_zeros +=1 \n\nElse, it remains. \n\nThen, the equation for this i is: \n\nA[i] *i + (number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i) = C[i] \n\nBut how do we compute the second term? \n\nWait, the second term is the number of k in [i+1, n] where the number of zeros in the first k elements is <=i. \n\nBut the first k elements include the current A[i] if k>i. \n\nHmm, this seems difficult. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second term can be expressed in terms of the current_zeros and other variables. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second term can be expressed as the number of k in [i+1, n] where the number of zeros in the first k elements is <=i. \n\nBut the first k elements include the first i elements (since k>i). \n\nWait, but the first k elements include the first i elements plus some more. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps there's a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe second term S_i = C[i] - A[i] *i \n\nmust be equal to the number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i. \n\nNow, note that z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nSuppose we choose A[i] such that S_i is as required. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal way to choose A[i] is to set it to 0 or 1 such that S_i is non-negative and possible. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose we process from the end. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s track for each position i, the minimal required number of zeros in the first (i+1) elements. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step, we can decide A[i], and track the cumulative zeros up to that point. \n\nLet me denote the cumulative zeros up to i (including A[i]) as z_i. \n\nWait, but z_i is the number of zeros in the first (i+1) elements. \n\nSo when processing i, the cumulative zeros up to i is z_i = previous_z + (A[i] is 0 ?1:0). \n\nBut since we are processing backward, perhaps we can track the cumulative zeros from the end. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the number of zeros in the first (i+1) elements is z_i. \n\nWe need to choose A[i] such that the equation holds. \n\nThe equation for i is: \n\nA[i] *i + (number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i) = C[i] \n\nThe term (number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i) can be written as the count of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i. \n\nBut z_k is the number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nNote that for k =i+1, the first k elements are the first i+1 elements (since k =i+1). \n\nSo z_{i+1} = z_i + (A[i] is 0 ?1:0). \n\nWait, yes. \n\nSo for k =i+1, the condition is z_{i+1} <=i. \n\nSimilarly, for k =i+2, the condition is z_{i+2} <=i. \n\nHmm, but this seems hard to track. \n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the second term S_i is the number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step, we can decide A[i], and then compute the required S_i. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nThe second term S_i is the number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i. \n\nThis can be rewritten as the number of k in [i+1, n] where the number of zeros in the first k elements is <=i. \n\nNow, note that for k =i+1, the first k elements include the first i elements plus A[i]. \n\nSo for k =i+1, the number of zeros is z_i + (A[i] is 0 ?1:0). \n\nThus, the condition for k =i+1 is (z_i + (A[i] is 0 ?1:0)) <=i. \n\nSimilarly, for k =i+2, the number of zeros is z_{i+1} + (A[i+1] is 0 ?1:0). \n\nBut since we are processing backward, perhaps we can track the required conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nWe can process the array from the end to the beginning, and track the current number of zeros. \n\nLet me try to think of an example. \n\nTake the sample input where C is [0,2,2,4]. \n\nThe correct A is [0,1,0,1]. \n\nLet me see how the equations work for each i (0-based). \n\nFor i=0 (first element): \n\nThe equation is: \n\nA[0] *0 + (number of k in [1,4] where z_k <=0) = C[0] =0 \n\nThe first term is 0. \n\nThe second term is the count of k in 1-4 where z_k <=0. \n\nz_1 is the number of zeros in first 1 elements (A[0] is 0 \u2192 z_1=1). \n\nSo for k=1: z_1=1>0 \u2192 no. \n\nk=2: z_2 is zeros in first 2 elements (0 and 1 \u2192 1 zero \u2192 z_2=1. 1>0 \u2192 no. \n\nk=3: first 3 elements have 2 zeros \u2192 z_3=2>0 \u2192 no. \n\nk=4: first 4 elements have 2 zeros \u2192 z_4=2>0 \u2192 no. \n\nSo the count is 0 \u2192 which matches C[0] =0. \n\nSo the equation holds. \n\nFor i=1 (second element): \n\nA[1] is 1. \n\nEquation: \n\n1 *1 + (number of k in [2,4] where z_k <=1) = 2 \n\nThe first term is 1. \n\nThe second term must be 1. \n\nLooking at k=2: z_2=1 \u2192 1<=1 \u2192 yes. \n\nk=3: z_3=2 \u2192 2>1 \u2192 no. \n\nk=4: z_4=2 \u2192 no. \n\nSo count is 1 \u2192 total 1+1=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nFor i=2 (third element): \n\nA[2] is 0. \n\nEquation: \n\n0 *2 + (number of k in [3,4] where z_k <=2) \u2192 \n\nThe first term is 0. \n\nThe second term: \n\nk=3: z_3=2 \u2192 yes \u2192 count +=1 \n\nk=4: z_4=2 \u2192 yes \u2192 count +=1 \u2192 total 2 \u2192 0+2=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nFor i=3 (fourth element): \n\nA[3] is 1. \n\nEquation: \n\n1 *3 + (number of k in [4,4] where z_4 <=3 \u2192 z_4=2 \u22643 \u2192 yes \u2192 count is 1. \n\nTotal 3+1=4 \u2192 correct. \n\nSo the equations work. \n\nNow, how to find A? \n\nPerhaps the following approach can work: \n\nWe can process from the end (i =n-1 down to 0). \n\nAt each step, we decide whether to set A[i] to 0 or 1. \n\nWe also track the current cumulative zeros up to i (z_i). \n\nWait, but how? \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current cumulative zeros from the start up to i (z_i). \n\nBut since we are processing backward, perhaps we can track the cumulative zeros from the end. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the current cumulative zeros up to i (including A[i]). \n\nWe can track this as we go backward. \n\nLet me try to outline the steps: \n\nInitialize current_zeros =0 \n\nWe process i from n-1 down to 0: \n\nAt each step, we decide A[i] (0 or 1). \n\nThe decision must satisfy the equation: \n\nA[i] *i + (number of k in [i+1, n] where z_k <=i) = C[i] \n\nBut how to compute the second term? \n\nWait, the second term is the number of k in [i+1, n] where the number of zeros in first k elements is <=i. \n\nThe first k elements include the first i elements (since k>i). \n\nBut since we are processing backward, perhaps we can track the required conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second term can be expressed as the number of k in [i+1, n] where the number of zeros in the first k elements is <=i. \n\nThis can be rewritten as the number of k in [i+1, n] where (z_{k} <=i). \n\nBut z_{k} is the number of zeros in first k elements. \n\nNow, for k =i+1, the first k elements are the first i+1 elements (including A[i]). \n\nSo z_{i+1} = z_i + (A[i] is 0 ?1:0). \n\nThus, for k =i+1, the condition is (z_i + (A[i] is 0 ?1:0)) <=i. \n\nSimilarly, for k =i+2, the condition is z_{i+2} <=i. \n\nBut z_{i+2} = z_{i+1} + (A[i+1] is 0 ?1:0). \n\nHmm, this seems recursive. \n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the second term S_i is equal to the number of k in [i+1, n] where the cumulative zeros up to k is <=i. \n\nBut how can we track this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nWe can track the current cumulative zeros up to the current position. \n\nLet me try to think of the following variables: \n\nLet\u2019s track the current cumulative zeros from the start up to i (z_i). \n\nWe also track the number of valid k's for the current i. \n\nWait, but this is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps the code provided in program1.py has a different approach. \n\nLooking back at the code: \n\nThe code initializes a as all 1s. \n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1: \n\nj = c[i] \n\nif j ==0 or a[i] ==0: \n\n    j +=i \n\nif j <n: \n\n    # TODO \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is to track the number of zeros required. \n\nWait, the code starts with a array of all 1s. \n\nThen for each position i, it's trying to adjust based on the current c[i]. \n\nThe variable j is initialized to c[i]. \n\nIf j is 0 or a[i] is 0, then j +=i. \n\nThen, if j <n, there's a missing part. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first j elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the position where a[i] should be 0 or 1. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the following approach: \n\nThe idea is that for each position i, the number of times it is a 0 in the sorted arrays is C[i] minus the contribution from the other terms. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the following logic: \n\nThe sum C[i] is the number of times the i-th element is 0 in the B arrays plus the number of times it is 1. \n\nWait, but the B arrays are built by sorting the first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to track the number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is to start with all 1s. \n\nThen, for each position i, it's trying to adjust based on the current c[i]. \n\nThe variable j is initially set to c[i]. \n\nIf j is 0 or a[i] is 0, then j +=i. \n\nThen, if j <n, there's a missing part. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the earliest position where a[i] should be 0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first j elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe sum C[i] can be expressed as the number of times the i-th element is 0 in the B arrays plus the number of times it is 1. \n\nWait, but the B arrays are built by sorting the first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is to start with all 1s. \n\nThen, for each position i, it's trying to adjust based on the current c[i]. \n\nThe variable j is initialized to c[i]. \n\nIf j is 0 or a[i] is 0, then j +=i. \n\nThen, if j <n, there's a missing part. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the number of zeros required in the first j elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required number of zeros in the first k elements. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nLet me think of the code's current structure. \n\nThe code initializes a as all 1s. \n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1: \n\nj = c[i] \n\nif j ==0 or a[i] ==0: \n\n    j +=i \n\nif j <n: \n\n    # TODO \n\nPerhaps the idea is that for each position i, the required number of zeros in the first j elements is something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to set a[i] to 0 if certain conditions are met. \n\nWait, the code starts with a[i] =1. \n\nThen, if j (c[i]) is 0 or a[i] is 0 (which it isn't initially), then j +=i. \n\nWait, initially a[i] is 1, so the condition is only if j ==0. \n\nSo for example, if c[i] is 0, then j becomes 0 +i. \n\nThen, if j <n, then perhaps we need to set a[i] to 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the missing code is something like a[j] =0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the required zeros. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to set a[j] to 0. \n\nWait, the code's current structure is: \n\nfor each i in 0..n-1: \n\n    j = c[i] \n\n    if (j ==0 or a[i] is 0): \n\n        j +=i \n\n    if j <n: \n\n        a[j] =0 \n\nWait, that might be the missing code. \n\nLet me see. \n\nIn the sample input where C is [0,2,2,4], the code would process each i. \n\nLet's see for the first test case where the correct A is [0,1,0,1]. \n\nThe code starts with a = [1,1,1,1]. \n\nProcessing i=0: \n\nc[0] is 0. \n\nj =0. \n\nSince j ==0, we add i (0) \u2192 j becomes 0. \n\nThen, since j <4 (n=4), we set a[j] (a[0]) to 0. \n\nNow a is [0,1,1,1]. \n\nNext i=1: \n\nc[1] is 2. \n\nj=2. \n\nSince a[1] is 1, no addition. \n\nj is 2 <4 \u2192 set a[2] to 0? \n\nWait, the code would set a[j] (a[2] to 0. \n\nNow a is [0,1,0,1]. \n\nThen i=2: \n\nc[2] is 2. \n\nj=2. \n\na[2] is 0 \u2192 so j +=2 \u2192 j=4. \n\n4 is not <4 \u2192 no change. \n\ni=3: \n\nc[3] is4. \n\nj=4. \n\nSince 4 is not <4 \u2192 no change. \n\nThe final a is [0,1,0,1], which is correct. \n\nThis seems to work for the sample. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose the sample where the output is [1,1,0,1]. \n\nWait, the note says that for the first test case, the example given has A=[1,1,0,1], but the sample input's C is [2,4,2,4]. \n\nLet me see: \n\nThe code would process each i. \n\nInitial a is [1,1,1,1]. \n\ni=0: \n\nc[0] is 2. \n\nj=2. \n\nSince a[0] is 1, no addition. \n\nj=2 <4 \u2192 set a[2] to 0. \n\nNow a is [1,1,0,1]. \n\ni=1: \n\nc[1] is4. \n\nj=4 \u2192 not <4 \u2192 no change. \n\ni=2: \n\nc[2] is2. \n\nj=2. \n\na[2] is 0 \u2192 so j +=2 \u2192 j=4 \u2192 no change. \n\ni=3: \n\nc[3] is4 \u2192 j=4 \u2192 no change. \n\nThe final a is [1,1,0,1], which matches the example. \n\nThis suggests that the missing code is a[j] =0. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\nif j <n: \n\n    a[j] =0 \n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is to set a[j] to 0. \n\nSo the program1's missing code is: \n\na[j] = 0 \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimum number of moves to remove all occurrences of t in s, and the number of ways to do so. \n\nThe code provided has a dynamic programming approach. \n\nLooking at the code: \n\nThe code reads s and t, then computes is_start array which marks the starting indices of occurrences of t in s. \n\nThen, the DP table d is a 2D array where d[j][i] represents the minimum steps and count for the substring from i to j. \n\nThe code loops over lengths from 1 to ls (length of s). \n\nFor each length ln, and for each j (end index), and i (start index), it tries to find the best way to split the substring. \n\nThe code has a TODO in the part where it's trying to update the DP table. \n\nThe current code has: \n\nif l[0] ==0: \n\n    r = ... \n\n    if tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n        # TODO \n\n    elif ... \n\nThe idea is that when there is an occurrence of t starting at k, then choosing to cover it would add 1 step. \n\nThe code is trying to compute the minimal steps and the count. \n\nThe missing code is likely to set tt to a new value when a better path is found. \n\nThe code's current structure is: \n\nif the left part (l) has 0 steps (meaning it's empty?), then combining with the right part (r) would give steps l[0] + r[0] +1 (since we take this occurrence). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to split the problem into two parts: before and after the current occurrence. \n\nThe code's logic is: \n\nFor the current substring from i to j, if there is an occurrence starting at k, then we can take this occurrence, and then the left part (i to k-1) and the right part (k+lt to j). \n\nThe total steps would be left's steps + right's steps +1. \n\nThe count would be left's count * right's count. \n\nThe code is trying to find the minimal steps and accumulate the counts. \n\nThe missing code is probably: \n\ntt = [l[0] + r[0] +1, l[1] * r[1]] \n\nThen, set d[j][i] = tt. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to update the current entry. \n\nThe code has: \n\nif tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n    # TODO \n\n    d[j][i] = [l[0]+r[0]+1, l[1]*r[1]] \n\nelif tt[0] == l[0]+r[0]+1: \n\n    tt[1] += r[1] \n\nWait, but the code's current line says: \n\nif l[0] ==0: \n\n    r = (d[j][k+lt] if j >=k+lt else None) or [0,1] \n\n    tt = d[j][i] \n\n    if tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\n    elif tt[0] == l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n        tt[1] = tt[1] + r[1] \n\n    d[j][i] = tt \n\nWait, the code is trying to compute the best option when there is an occurrence at k. \n\nThe missing code is probably setting the new value when the new steps are better. \n\nThe correct code would be: \n\nif the new steps (l[0] + r[0] +1) is better than current tt's steps, then set tt to the new value. \n\nElse if equal, add the counts. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nd[j][i] = [l[0]+r[0]+1, l[1]*r[1]] \n\nBut the code's current structure has a 'tt' variable. \n\nAlternatively, the code should set tt to the new value. \n\nThe code's current line after the if condition is missing the assignment. \n\nThe correct code would be: \n\nif the condition is met (better steps), then set tt to the new value. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\ntt = [l[0] + r[0] +1, l[1] * r[1]] \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nif tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n    tt = [l[0]+r[0]+1, l[1]*r[1]] \n\nelif ... \n\nThen, after that, set d[j][i] = tt. \n\nBut the code's current structure has the 'tt' variable. \n\nAlternatively, the code should replace the 'TODO' with the assignment. \n\nThe code's current line after the 'if' is empty. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\ntt = [l[0] + r[0] +1, l[1] * r[1]] \n\nThus, the program2's missing code is to set tt to the new value. \n\nNow, program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of lines needed to form at least n equilateral triangles. \n\nThe code provided has a precomputed array 'cnt' which tracks the maximum number of triangles achievable with a certain number of lines. \n\nThe code initializes 'ctr' as [0,0,0], and 'cnt' starts with 0. \n\nThen, in a loop while cnt[-1] <1e9, it selects the smallest element in 'ctr', increments it, and appends to cnt the new count. \n\nThe solve function uses binary search to find the minimal m where cnt[m] >=n. \n\nThe code has a TODO in the binary search part. \n\nThe current code for solve: \n\ndef solve(sn): \n\n    t = int(sn) \n\n    s, e = 0, len(cnt) -1 \n\n    while s <e: \n\n        m = (s+e)>>1 \n\n        if cnt[m] >=t: \n\n            e =m \n\n        else: \n\n            # TODO: Your code here \n\n    return str(s) \n\nThe missing part is the else clause. \n\nThe else case is when cnt[m] <t \u2192 so we need to search the right half. \n\nThus, the code should set s = m+1. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\ns = m+1 \n\nThus, the program3's missing code is s = m+1. \n\nPutting it all together: \n\nThe three missing parts are: \n\nprogram1: a[j] =0 \n\nprogram2: tt = [l[0]+r[0]+1, l[1]*r[1]] \n\nprogram3: s = m+1 \n\nWait, but for program2's missing code, the exact line is needed. \n\nLooking back at the code for program2: \n\nThe code has: \n\nif l[0] ==0: \n\n    r = (d[j][k+lt] if j >=k+lt else None) or [0,1] \n\n    tt = d[j][i] \n\n    if tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\n    elif tt[0] == l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n        tt[1] = tt[1] + r[1] \n\n    d[j][i] = tt \n\nThe 'TODO' is inside the first if condition. \n\nThe code needs to set tt to the new value when the new steps are better. \n\nSo inside the first if condition (tt is None or current steps are better), the code should set tt to the new value. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\ntt = [l[0] + r[0] +1, l[1] * r[1]] \n\nSo the code becomes: \n\nif tt is None or tt[0] > l[0] + r[0] +1: \n\n    tt = [l[0] + r[0] +1, l[1] * r[1]] \n\nelif ... \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is that line. \n\nSo the three missing parts are: \n\nprogram1: a[j] =0 \n\nprogram2: tt = [l[0]+r[0]+1, l[1] * r[1]] \n\nprogram3: s = m+1 \n\nThus, the final answer is the JSON with these three strings."
