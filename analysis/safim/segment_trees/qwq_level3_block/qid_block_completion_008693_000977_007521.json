But then the total cost would be a*x[i] (moving there) plus the sum of left and right. But then the minimal over all i of (a*x[i] + (sum_{j < i} (x[i] - x_j) + sum_{k > i} (x[k] - x[i])) * b) \n\nWait, but the initial approach's ans is sum(xs)*b.

Wait, S_i is sum up to i? Wait, let me reorganize terms:\n\nThe total inside the brackets is:\n\nsum_{j <i} (x[i] -x_j) = x[i] * (i terms) minus sum x_j up to i-1. Similarly, sum_{k>i} (x_k -x[i]) = sum x_k from i+1 to n minus x[i]*(n -i terms). So total is:\n\nx[i] * i - S_{i-1} + (S_n - S_i) - x[i]*(n -i)\n\n= x[i]*(i - (n -i)) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - S_i + S_i ?

Let me see if there's a better way. Alternatively, the total inside the brackets is (sum_{j=1 to n} x_j) - x[i] Wait, no. Let me think of the total sum of (x[i] -x_j) for j <i plus (x_k -x[i]) for k>i:\n\nsum_{j <i} (x[i] -x_j) = i*x[i] - sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j \n\nsum_{k>i} (x_k -x[i]) = sum_{k=i+1 to n} x_k - (n -i)*x[i]\n\nAdding these two gives:\n\ni x[i] - S_{i-1} + (S_n - S_i) - (n -i)x[i]\n\n= (i x[i] - (n -i)x[i]) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - S_i + S_i ?

Let me think of the total cost for choosing i as the point to move to:\n\ncost_i = a*x[i] + b*(sum_{j <i} (x[i] -x_j) + sum_{k>i} (x_k -x[i]))\n\n= a*x[i] + b*( (i x[i] - S_{i-1}) + (S_n - S_i - (n -i)x[i]) )\n\n= a*x[i] + b*( i x[i] - S_{i-1} + S_n - S_i - (n -i)x[i] )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe x[i] terms: (i x[i] - (n -i)x[i]) = (2i -n)x[i]\n\nThe S terms: -S_{i-1} + S_n - S_i But S_i = S_{i-1} + x_i, so S_n - S_i = S_n - S_{i-1} -x_i Thus, the S terms become: -S_{i-1} + (S_n - S_{i-1} -x_i) = S_n - 2 S_{i-1} -x_i Putting it all together:\n\ncost_i = a x[i] + b [ (2i -n)x[i] + (S_n - 2 S_{i-1} -x_i) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be rewritten in terms of prefix sums. Let me denote S[i] as the prefix sum up to index i (assuming 0-based or 1-based? The code uses 0-based probably.) Wait, in the code, the xs are read as a list, so probably 0-based. Let me assume that S is the prefix sum array where S[0] =0, S[1] =x[0], S[2] =x[0]+x[1], etc. Wait, maybe the code uses 0-based indices. Let me see the code: In program1.py, the code has:\n\ncum=0\n\nans=sum(xs)*b\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the initial ans is sum(xs)*b, which is the cost if you conquer all from 0.",

So the code's loop is trying to compute for each i the cost_i and see if it's better than the current ans. To compute this efficiently, we can precompute prefix sums. Let me define S[i] as the sum of the first i elements (assuming 0-based). Wait, let's say the array is 0-based.

So the sum of (x[k] -x[i]) for k>i is (S[n] - S[i+1]) - (n -i)*x[i]\n\nThus, the total inside the brackets is:\n\ni*x[i] - S[i] + (S[n] - S[i+1] - (n -i)*x[i]) = (i x[i] - (n -i)x[i]) + (S[n] - S[i] - S[i+1] + ... ? Wait, S[i+1] = S[i] +x[i], so S[n] - S[i+1] = S[n] - S[i] -x[i]\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= (i - (n -i))x[i] + (S[n] - S[i] - (S[i] +x[i])) = (2i -n)x[i] + (S[n] - 2 S[i] -x[i]) Thus, the cost_i is:\n\na*x[i] + b*( (2i -n)x[i] + S[n] - 2 S[i] -x[i] ) Hmm, this can be rewritten as:\n\ncost_i = a*x[i] + b*( (2i -n -1)x[i] + S[n] - 2 S[i] )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? The code's loop is over each i, so for each i, we can compute this term and see if it's better than the current ans. The initial ans is sum(xs)*b = S[n] *b. So for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nterm = a*x[i] + b*( (2i -n -1)*x[i] + (S[n] - 2*S[i]) ) Wait, S[i] is the sum up to x[i-1], so S[i] = sum_{0..i-1} x[j]. Wait, let me recheck the variables. Suppose the prefix sum array S is such that S[0] =0, S[1] =x[0], S[2] =x[0]+x[1], etc. So S[i] is the sum of the first i elements (indices 0 to i-1). Thus, for the i-th element (0-based), the sum of x[j] for j <i is S[i], and the sum of x[j] for j>i is S[n] - S[i+1]. So the formula for cost_i is:\n\ncost_i = a*x[i] + b*( (2i -n)*x[i] + (S[n] - 2*S[i] -x[i]) )",

Then, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nthe prefix sum up to i is S[i] = cum before adding xs[i].

Alternatively, in the loop, for each i, the prefix sum up to i (S[i]) can be tracked with a variable. Wait , let's see:\n\nInitialize cum =0 (this will be S[0] =0). Then, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nthe current x is xs[i]\n\nthe prefix sum up to i (S[i]) is cum. Then, after processing i, we add xs[i] to cum, so that cum becomes S[i+1].

The code can compute the total_sum as sum(xs), but since ans is already set to that, perhaps it's already computed. Wait, the code's initial ans is sum(xs)*b, so total_sum is sum(xs). Thus, inside the loop, for each i:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum (the sum of the first i elements, since before adding xs[i], cum is the sum up to i-1 elements. Wait, let's see: Initially, cum is 0.

Wait, the formula would be steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ), but only if prev-1 is positive. Wait, if prev is 0, then prev-1 is -1. So steps needed to reach -1 is 1 step (subtract a[j] once). Thus, the formula would be steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ), but since prev-1 can be negative, we need to take the ceiling of a negative number. Wait, let's think of the steps needed to reach a value <= prev-1. The current value is 0. We need 0 - x*a[j] <= prev-1 \u2192 x*a[j] >= -(prev-1) \u2192 x >= ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j].

Thus, the formula for steps is ceil( ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] ). Wait, but since prev-1 can be negative, -(prev-1) is positive when prev <1. Thus, the steps needed are ceil( ( (prev-1) ) / a[j] ) if prev-1 is negative? Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 >=0, else 0. Wait, no.

Since a[j] is at least 1, x must be at least 1 \u2192 steps 1. prev is 5 \u2192 -(prev-1) =-4 \u2192 x >= -4/a[j]. Since a[j] is positive, this is x >= -4/a[j], which is always true for x>=0. Thus, steps needed is 0. prev is 1 \u2192 -(prev-1)=0 \u2192 x >=0 \u2192 steps can be 0. Thus, the formula is steps = ceil( ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] ), but since a[j] is positive, and we need to take the ceiling of a positive number when prev-1 is negative. Wait, but ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] is (1 - prev)/a[j]. Wait, perhaps the correct formula is steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 >=0, else 0. Wait, no. Alternatively, the steps needed are the minimal x such that 0 -x*a[j] <= prev-1 \u2192 x >= (0 - (prev-1))/a[j] \u2192 x >= (1 - prev)/a[j]. Since x must be an integer >=0, the minimal x is the ceiling of (1 - prev)/a[j], but only if (1 - prev)/a[j] is positive. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, the steps needed are the minimal x such that 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > (0 - (prev-1)) \u2192 x > (prev-1)/a[j]. Wait, the inequality is 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > -prev \u2192 x > -prev/a[j]. Since a[j] is positive, this is always true for x >=0 when prev is positive. Thus, when prev is positive, no steps are needed. Only when prev is 0 or negative, steps are needed. Wait, prev is the value of the next element (j+1). Initially, for j =i-1, the next element is i, which has b[i] =0. Thus, prev is 0. So steps needed are to make b[j] <0 \u2192 subtract at least once. Thus, steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) \u2192 (0-1)/a[j] \u2192 -1/a[j]. Taking the ceiling of that would give 0, but that's not correct. Hmm, perhaps the formula for the left side is similar to the right side but in reverse. For the right side, each element must be at least prev+1.

Steps needed is ceil(2/a[j]). But prev can't be negative because it's the value of the next element, which is being processed in the right loop. Wait, the next element's value is being built up. Wait, perhaps the code's left loop is tracking the previous value (prev) and updating it as it goes. Let me think of the code's left loop:\n\nInitially, prev is 0 (for j =i-1, the next element is i, which has b[i] =0). Then, for j =i-1:\n\nWe need to compute the steps needed to make b[j] < prev (0). The steps are ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) \u2192 (0-1)/a[j] \u2192 -1/a[j]. Taking the ceiling of that would give 0, but that's not correct. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, the steps needed are the minimal x such that 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > (0 - prev) \u2192 x > -prev/a[j]. Since prev is 0, this is x>0 \u2192 x>=1. Thus steps needed is 1. Thus, the formula is steps = max(1, ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ))? No, that's not general. Alternatively, the steps needed are ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 >=0, else 1. Wait, when prev is 0, prev-1 is -1 \u2192 steps needed is 1. When prev is 1 \u2192 prev-1 is 0 \u2192 steps needed is 0. When prev is 2 \u2192 steps needed is ceil(1/a[j]). Wait, for prev=2, a[j]=3 \u2192 steps needed is 0.5 \u2192 ceil(0.5)=1 \u2192 but 0-3*1 =-3 <2 \u2192 yes. But the maximum allowed is 1 (prev-1=1). To reach 1, steps needed is (1)/3 \u2192 0.333 \u2192 ceil(0.333) is 1 \u2192 but 0-3*1 =-3 <1. Wait, but the maximum allowed is 1, so the minimal steps to reach 1 is 0.333 \u2192 but you can't do that. Thus, the minimal steps to reach a value <=1 is 0 steps (0 is already less than 2). Ah! So when prev is 2, the current b[j] is 0, which is already less than 2. So no steps needed. Thus, the steps needed are only when prev is 0 or negative. Thus, the steps needed are ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 <0 \u2192 i.e., when prev <1. Wait, when prev is 0 \u2192 steps needed is ceil( (0-1)/a[j] ) \u2192 ceil(-1/a[j]). Since a[j] is positive, this is -1/a[j], which is negative. The ceiling of a negative number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to it. For example, if a[j] is 2 \u2192 -0.5 \u2192 ceiling is -0 \u2192 0? Wait, no. The ceiling of -0.5 is -0 \u2192 but in integers, it's -0 is 0. Wait, ceil(-0.5) is -0 \u2192 but in integers, it's -0 is 0. Thus, the steps would be 0, but that's incorrect. Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct formula for the left side is similar to the right side but with a different sign. For the right side, the required value is at least prev+1 \u2192 steps = ceil( (prev+1)/a[k] ) For the left side, the required value is at most prev-1 \u2192 steps = ceil( (prev-1 -0)/ (-a[j]) ) \u2192 but since steps can only be positive (subtracting), the formula is steps = ceil( (0 - (prev-1))/a[j] ) \u2192 ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\nThus, the steps needed are ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] ) But only if this is positive. Thus, steps = max(0, ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] ) ) Wait, let's test this formula:\n\nprev=0 \u2192 (1-0)/a[j] \u2192 1/a[j]. If a[j] is 2 \u2192 0.5 \u2192 ceil(0.5)=1 \u2192 correct. \n\nprev=1 \u2192 (1-1)/a[j] \u21920 \u2192 steps 0 \u2192 correct. prev=2 \u2192 (1-2)/a[j] \u2192-1/a[j] \u2192 ceil(-0.5) is -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 correct. prev=-1 \u2192 (1 - (-1))/a[j] \u21922/a[j]. If a[j]=3 \u2192 2/3 \u2192 ceil(0.666)=1 \u2192 steps 1 \u2192 which would make b[j] =0-3*1 =-3 < -1 \u2192 yes. Thus, this formula seems correct. Thus, the steps needed for the left side are ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] ), and we add this to the temp variable.",

But since steps can't be negative, if prev-1 is negative (i.e., prev <1), then steps needed are ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] ). Wait, let's see:\n\nprev is 0 \u2192 (1-0)/a[j] \u2192 1/a[j]. Thus steps needed is ceil(1/a[j]). Since a[j] is at least 1, this is 1.",

Wait, the current b[j] is 0. To get to (prev-1), you can subtract (0 - (prev-1)) = prev-1. The number of steps is (prev-1)/a[j], but since each step subtracts a[j], so steps = (prev-1) // a[j], but if (prev-1) is not divisible by a[j], then you need to round up.

The binary_find function is a helper for some geometric computation. The code's binary_find function has a TODO in the first if condition. Looking at the code for binary_find:\n\nwhile math.fabs(cy - fy) > eps:\n\n    mid_y = cy / 2.0 + fy / 2.0\n\n    la = lb = 0.0\n\n    ra, rb = pi - alpha_1, pi - alpha_2\n\n    while math.fabs(ra - la) > eps:\n\n        mid_a = ra / 2.0 + la / 2.0\n\n        yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_a), 2) * math.cos(alpha_1 + mid_a) / math.sin(alpha_1)\n\n        if yy < mid_y:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        if yy > mid_y:\n\n            ra = mid_a\n\n    while math.fabs(rb - lb) > eps:\n\n        mid_b = rb / 2.0 + lb / 2.0\n\n        yy = - pow(math.sin(mid_b), 2) * math.cos(alpha_2 + mid_b) / math.sin(alpha_2) if yy < mid_y:\n\n            lb = mid_b\n\n        if yy > mid_y:\n\n            rb = mid_b\n\n    x1 = ... \n\n    x2 = ... \n\n    if x1 < x2:\n\n        cy = mid_y\n\n    if x1 > x2:\n\n        fy = mid_y\n\nThe missing part is the first if condition inside the first inner loop (the one for ra and la). The code is performing a binary search on mid_a to find a value where yy equals mid_y. The current code has:\n\nif yy < mid_y:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nif yy > mid_y:\n\n    ra = mid_a\n\nThe logic is that if the computed yy is less than the target mid_y, we need to adjust the search range. In binary search, if the current mid's value is less than the target, we need to search in the higher half. Thus, in this case, if yy < mid_y, then we need to increase mid_a. The current ra is the upper bound, so we set la = mid_a. Wait, the loop is trying to find the value of mid_a where yy equals mid_y. The variables la and ra are the lower and upper bounds for the binary search. Initially, la is 0.0 and ra is pi - alpha_1. The mid_a is computed as (ra + la)/2. If yy < mid_y \u2192 the current mid_a is too small, so we need to increase la. Thus, the code should set la = mid_a. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nla = mid_a \n\nThus, the code inside the first if block is:\n\nla = mid_a So the missing code for program3's binary_find function is:\n\nif yy < mid_y: la = mid_a \n\nThus, the code's missing part is simply \"la = mid_a\". Putting it all together:\n\nThe three missing parts are:\n\nProgram1: \n\nInside the loop for each i:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum\n\nterm = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (sum(xs) - 2*s_i) )\n\nif term < ans:\n\n    ans = term\n\ncum += x_i\n\nBut in code, the variables are already in scope. Program2's left loop:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    steps_needed = ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\n    if steps_needed <0:\n\n        steps_needed =0 \n\n    temp += steps_needed \n\n    prev = 0 - steps_needed * a[j]\n\n    j -=1 \n\nProgram3's binary_find function:\n\nif yy < mid_y:\n\n    la = mid_a \n\nThus, the final JSON is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"x_i = xs[i]\\n    s_i = cum\\n    term = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (sum(xs) - 2*s_i) )\\n    if term < ans:\\n        ans = term\\n    cum += x_i\",\n  \"program2\": \"steps_needed = ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\\n    if steps_needed <0:\\n        steps_needed =0 \\n    temp += steps_needed \\n    prev = 0 - steps_needed * a[j]\\n    j -=1\",\n  \"program3\": \"la = mid_a\"\n} Wait, but for program2's loop, the code is inside the while j >=0 loop. The code for program2's missing part is the entire loop's body. The code inside the j loop (the left loop) is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    steps_needed = ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\n    if steps_needed <0:\n\n        steps_needed =0 \n\n    temp += steps_needed \n\n    prev = 0 - steps_needed * a[j]\n\n    j -=1 Thus, the missing code for program2 is the four lines inside the while loop. But in the code's structure, the loop is:\n\nwhile j>=0:\n\n    # TODO:",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about finding the minimum cost to conquer all kingdoms. The key here is to decide when to move the capital and when to conquer. Since moving the capital costs a per unit distance and conquering costs b, which is cheaper? Well, if b is cheaper than a, maybe it's better to conquer as much as possible before moving. But I need to think of the optimal strategy.\n\nLooking at the code provided, the initial approach seems to calculate the sum of all x multiplied by b, which would be the cost if we just conquered everything from 0. But that's probably not optimal. The code has a loop over n, so maybe it's trying to find the best point to split the kingdoms into left and right parts, considering moving the capital there.\n\nWait, the problem says that when you conquer, you can't have unconquered kingdoms between the capital and the target. So, you can only conquer in a straight line from the current capital. So the optimal path probably involves moving the capital to a point where you can cover the remaining kingdoms efficiently.\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal cost is achieved by choosing a point x_i where you move the capital to, and then conquer the remaining kingdoms on both sides. The cost would be the sum of conquering to the left and right from that point, plus the cost of moving there. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be similar to the classic problem where you choose a point to minimize the sum of distances multiplied by certain coefficients. Let me think: the total cost can be broken down into moving the capital and conquering. Since moving the capital can be done in steps, but each move has a cost, perhaps the optimal strategy is to move the capital as infrequently as possible when a is cheaper than b, or more often when b is cheaper.\n\nWait, the note example shows that moving the capital multiple times is necessary. Let me look at the note example again. The example's cost includes moving the capital each time after conquering. The total cost is a combination of moving and conquering steps. \n\nThe code in program1.py has a loop over i, and the initial ans is sum(xs)*b. That's the cost if you just conquer everything from 0, but that's probably not optimal. The loop is probably trying to find a better point. Maybe for each position i, compute the cost if we choose to move the capital to x[i], and then conquer the remaining kingdoms on both sides. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum over all possible positions i of (cost to reach i) plus (cost to conquer the remaining). Let me think of the formula. \n\nSuppose we choose to move the capital to x[i]. The cost to move there would be a * x[i], since moving from 0 to x[i] directly (assuming we can do that in one move, but actually, you can only move to conquered kingdoms. Hmm, maybe the approach is to consider that the optimal point is somewhere in the middle, and the cost can be expressed in terms of prefix sums.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: the minimal cost is the minimum over all possible positions k (the last capital position) of the cost to reach k plus the cost to conquer the remaining. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as choosing a point where you move the capital to, and then conquer all to the left and right. The total cost would be the cost to move to that point plus the cost to conquer the remaining. But how to compute this efficiently?\n\nWait, the code's initial ans is sum(xs)*b. That's the cost if you just conquer all from 0. But maybe there's a better way. Let me think of the example given in the note. The example has n=5, a=6, b=3, and x = [1,5,6,21,30]. The optimal path's total cost is 171. The initial approach would compute sum(x)*b = (1+5+6+21+30)*3 = 63*3=189, which is higher than 171. So the code's loop must find a better value.\n\nThe loop in the code is for i in range(n). So perhaps for each i, we compute the cost if we choose x[i] as the point where we move the capital to, and then conquer the remaining. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be broken down into two parts: the cost to reach x[i] (moving there from 0, which costs a*x[i]), plus the cost to conquer the left and right parts. Wait, but once you move to x[i], you can conquer the remaining kingdoms to the left and right, but you can only conquer in one direction at a time. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost can be found by considering that the optimal strategy is to move the capital to some x[i], and then conquer all to the left and right from there. The cost would be:\n\ncost = a * x[i] (moving there) + (sum of (x[i] - x[j]) for j < i)*b (conquering left) + (sum of (x[k] - x[i]) for k > i)*b (conquering right). But also, moving the capital might be needed again, but perhaps the optimal is to do it in one move. Wait, but maybe moving once to x[i], then conquering everything else from there. \n\nWait, but in the example, they moved multiple times. So perhaps this approach is not sufficient. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as the total cost is the sum of all the distances between consecutive conquered points, multiplied by either a or b, depending on whether it's a move or a conquer. \n\nWait, the key is that when you conquer a kingdom, you can only do so if there are no unconquered between the capital and the target. So, the order of conquering must be such that you can only conquer in a contiguous block extending from the current capital. So the optimal path would involve moving the capital to a point, then conquering all to the left or right, then moving again, etc. \n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a dynamic programming approach, but given the constraints (n up to 2e5), that's probably not feasible. \n\nLooking back at the code, the initial ans is sum(xs)*b. The loop is over i, and inside the loop, there's a TODO. The code is trying to compute a better ans by considering each possible i as a split point. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum between the initial approach and some other terms. Let me think of the formula. \n\nSuppose we choose to move the capital to x[i], then the cost would be:\n\ncost = a * x[i] (moving from 0 to x[i]) \n\nplus the cost to conquer the left side (all x_j < x[i]). Since you can conquer them from x[i], but you have to do it in order. Wait, but to conquer the left, you can only do so if they are between 0 and x[i], but since they are already in order, you can conquer them all at once? Or do you have to conquer them in order? \n\nWait, the problem says you can conquer an unconquered kingdom if there are no unconquered between the capital and the target. So, if the capital is at x[i], you can conquer any kingdom to the left (since they are all between 0 and x[i], but only if they are not yet conquered. Wait, but if you move the capital to x[i], then you can conquer all the left kingdoms in one step? Or do you have to do them one by one? \n\nNo, the problem says \"conquer an unconquered kingdom (c2) at a cost of b*distance\". So each individual kingdom must be conquered, but you can only do it if there are no unconquered between the capital and the target. So, to conquer all left kingdoms, you have to do them in order from the capital towards 0. But since they are already in order, perhaps you can conquer them all at once? Or maybe you have to conquer them in order, but the cost is the sum of their distances from the capital. \n\nWait, the cost for conquering each left kingdom would be the distance from the capital (x[i]) to each x_j < x[i]. But since they are all between 0 and x[i], you can conquer them all at once? Or do you have to conquer them one by one, but the order doesn't matter as long as they are between. \n\nActually, the problem states that you can conquer any unconquered kingdom as long as there are no unconquered between the capital and the target. So, if the capital is at x[i], you can conquer any kingdom to the left (since there are no unconquered between them and the capital, once you have moved there). Wait, no. Suppose there are some unconquered kingdoms between 0 and x[i]. Then you can't conquer a kingdom that's further left than some unconquered one. So to conquer all left kingdoms, you have to conquer them in order from the capital towards 0. But since you can choose any order, perhaps the minimal cost is just the sum of (x[i] - x_j) for all j < i, multiplied by b. \n\nSimilarly, for the right side, the sum of (x_k - x[i]) for k > i, multiplied by b. \n\nBut then the total cost would be a*x[i] (moving there) plus the sum of left and right. \n\nBut then the minimal over all i of (a*x[i] + (sum_{j < i} (x[i] - x_j) + sum_{k > i} (x[k] - x[i])) * b) \n\nWait, but the initial approach's ans is sum(xs)*b. Let's see:\n\nsum_{all x} x * b = sum(x_j) * b. \n\nThe alternative for choosing i is a*x[i] + (sum_{j < i} (x[i] -x_j) + sum_{k>i} (x_k -x[i})) * b \n\nThe sum inside the brackets is (sum_{j <i} x[i] - x_j) + sum_{k>i} x_k -x[i] \n\n= (i * x[i] - sum_{j <i} x_j) + (sum_{k>i} x_k - (n -i) x[i])\n\nTotal sum: i x[i] - S_{i-1} + (S_n - S_i) - (n -i)x[i]\n\n= i x[i] - S_{i-1} + S_n - S_i - (n -i)x[i]\n\n= (i x[i] - (n -i)x[i]) + (S_n - S_{i} - S_{i-1} + ... ? Wait, S_i is sum up to i?\n\nWait, let me reorganize terms:\n\nThe total inside the brackets is:\n\nsum_{j <i} (x[i] -x_j) = x[i] * (i terms) minus sum x_j up to i-1.\n\nSimilarly, sum_{k>i} (x_k -x[i]) = sum x_k from i+1 to n minus x[i]*(n -i terms).\n\nSo total is:\n\nx[i] * i - S_{i-1} + (S_n - S_i) - x[i]*(n -i)\n\n= x[i]*(i - (n -i)) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - S_i + S_i ? Wait, S_i is sum up to i, so S_n - S_i is sum from i+1 to n.\n\nWait, the total becomes:\n\nx[i]*(i - (n -i)) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - x[i]*(n -i) ? Not sure. Let me compute:\n\nThe first term is x[i] * i - S_{i-1}\n\nThe second term is (S_n - S_i) - x[i]*(n -i)\n\nAdding them together:\n\nx[i] *i - S_{i-1} + S_n - S_i - x[i]*(n -i)\n\n= x[i]*(i - (n -i)) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - S_i)\n\nBut S_i = S_{i-1} + x[i], so S_n - S_i = S_n - S_{i-1} -x[i]\n\nSo substituting:\n\nx[i]*(2i -n) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - (S_{i-1} +x[i])) \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me see if there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, the total inside the brackets is (sum_{j=1 to n} x_j) - x[i] \n\nWait, no. Let me think of the total sum of (x[i] -x_j) for j <i plus (x_k -x[i]) for k>i:\n\nsum_{j <i} (x[i] -x_j) = i*x[i] - sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j \n\nsum_{k>i} (x_k -x[i]) = sum_{k=i+1 to n} x_k - (n -i)*x[i]\n\nAdding these two gives:\n\ni x[i] - S_{i-1} + (S_n - S_i) - (n -i)x[i]\n\n= (i x[i] - (n -i)x[i]) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - S_i + S_i ? Wait S_i is S_{i-1} +x_i. So S_n - S_i = S_n - S_{i-1} -x_i. \n\nSo substituting:\n\n= x[i]*(2i -n) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - (S_{i-1} +x_i)) \n\nWait, not sure. Let me compute the total:\n\nThe total of the two terms is:\n\ni x[i] - S_{i-1} + (S_n - S_i) - (n -i)x[i]\n\n= (i x[i] - (n -i)x[i]) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - S_i) \n\nBut S_i = S_{i-1} + x_i, so S_n - S_i = S_n - S_{i-1} -x_i \n\nSo substituting:\n\n= x[i]*(2i -n) + (S_n - S_{i-1} - (S_{i-1} +x_i)) \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me think of the total cost for choosing i as the point to move to:\n\ncost_i = a*x[i] + b*(sum_{j <i} (x[i] -x_j) + sum_{k>i} (x_k -x[i]))\n\n= a*x[i] + b*( (i x[i] - S_{i-1}) + (S_n - S_i - (n -i)x[i]) )\n\n= a*x[i] + b*( i x[i] - S_{i-1} + S_n - S_i - (n -i)x[i] )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe x[i] terms: (i x[i] - (n -i)x[i]) = (2i -n)x[i]\n\nThe S terms: -S_{i-1} + S_n - S_i \n\nBut S_i = S_{i-1} + x_i, so S_n - S_i = S_n - S_{i-1} -x_i \n\nThus, the S terms become: -S_{i-1} + (S_n - S_{i-1} -x_i) \n\n= S_n - 2 S_{i-1} -x_i \n\nPutting it all together:\n\ncost_i = a x[i] + b [ (2i -n)x[i] + (S_n - 2 S_{i-1} -x_i) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be rewritten in terms of prefix sums. Let me denote S[i] as the prefix sum up to index i (assuming 0-based or 1-based? The code uses 0-based probably.)\n\nWait, in the code, the xs are read as a list, so probably 0-based. Let me assume that S is the prefix sum array where S[0] =0, S[1] =x[0], S[2] =x[0]+x[1], etc. Wait, maybe the code uses 0-based indices. Let me see the code:\n\nIn program1.py, the code has:\n\ncum=0\n\nans=sum(xs)*b\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the initial ans is sum(xs)*b, which is the cost if you conquer all from 0. \n\nThe loop is over each i (from 0 to n-1?), and for each i, perhaps we compute the cost of moving to x[i], then conquering the rest. \n\nThe formula for cost_i would be:\n\ncost_i = a * x[i] (moving from 0 to x[i]) \n\nplus the cost to conquer the left (all before i) and right (all after i). \n\nThe left cost is sum_{j <i} (x[i] -x[j]) *b \n\nThe right cost is sum_{k>i} (x[k] -x[i])*b \n\nSo total cost_i = a*x[i] + b*(sum_{j <i} (x[i]-x[j]) + sum_{k>i} (x[k]-x[i]))\n\nWe need to find the minimum between the initial ans and all cost_i. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal ans is the minimum over all i of cost_i, and the initial ans. \n\nWait, but the initial ans is when you don't move the capital at all, so you have to conquer all from 0. But in that case, you can only conquer the kingdoms in order, but since they are in order, you can conquer them all, but the cost would be sum(x) *b. \n\nSo the code's loop is trying to compute for each i the cost_i and see if it's better than the current ans. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can precompute prefix sums. Let me define S[i] as the sum of the first i elements (assuming 0-based). \n\nWait, let's say the array is 0-based. Let S be the prefix sum array where S[0] =0, S[1] =x[0], S[2] =x[0]+x[1], etc. \n\nWait, perhaps S is the array where S[i] = x[0] + ... +x[i-1]. So S[n] is the total sum. \n\nThen, the sum of x[j] for j from 0 to i-1 is S[i]. \n\nThe sum of x[j] for j <i (assuming 0-based) is S[i]. \n\nThe sum of x[j] for j>i (0-based) is S[n] - S[i+1]. \n\nWait, let me re-express the terms:\n\nsum_{j <i} (x[i] -x[j]) = i *x[i] - S[i] \n\nsum_{k>i} (x[k] -x[i]) = (S[n] - S[i+1]) - (n -i -1)*x[i] \n\nWait, the sum of x[k] for k>i (0-based) is S[n] - S[i+1], and the number of terms is (n - (i+1) +1) = n -i terms. \n\nSo the sum of (x[k] -x[i]) for k>i is (S[n] - S[i+1]) - (n -i)*x[i]\n\nThus, the total inside the brackets is:\n\ni*x[i] - S[i] + (S[n] - S[i+1] - (n -i)*x[i])\n\n= (i x[i] - (n -i)x[i]) + (S[n] - S[i] - S[i+1] + ... ? Wait, S[i+1] = S[i] +x[i], so S[n] - S[i+1] = S[n] - S[i] -x[i]\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= (i - (n -i))x[i] + (S[n] - S[i] - (S[i] +x[i])) \n\n= (2i -n)x[i] + (S[n] - 2 S[i] -x[i])\n\nThus, the cost_i is:\n\na*x[i] + b*( (2i -n)x[i] + S[n] - 2 S[i] -x[i] )\n\nHmm, this can be rewritten as:\n\ncost_i = a*x[i] + b*( (2i -n -1)x[i] + S[n] - 2 S[i] )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe code's loop is over each i, so for each i, we can compute this term and see if it's better than the current ans. \n\nThe initial ans is sum(xs)*b = S[n] *b. \n\nSo for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nterm = a*x[i] + b*( (2i -n -1)*x[i] + (S[n] - 2*S[i]) )\n\nWait, S[i] is the sum up to x[i-1], so S[i] = sum_{0..i-1} x[j]. \n\nWait, let me recheck the variables. \n\nSuppose the prefix sum array S is such that S[0] =0, S[1] =x[0], S[2] =x[0]+x[1], etc. So S[i] is the sum of the first i elements (indices 0 to i-1). \n\nThus, for the i-th element (0-based), the sum of x[j] for j <i is S[i], and the sum of x[j] for j>i is S[n] - S[i+1]. \n\nSo the formula for cost_i is:\n\ncost_i = a*x[i] + b*( (2i -n)*x[i] + (S[n] - 2*S[i] -x[i]) )\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nThe previous expression was:\n\n(2i -n)x[i] + (S[n] - 2 S[i] -x[i])\n\nSo that's (2i -n -1)x[i] + (S[n] - 2 S[i])\n\nThus, the cost_i is:\n\na*x[i] + b*( (2i -n -1)*x[i] + (S[n] - 2*S[i]) )\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified as:\n\ncost_i = (a + b*(2i -n -1)) *x[i] + b*(S[n] - 2*S[i])\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums S. \n\nSo in the code, the first step is to compute the prefix sums. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1.py, the code has:\n\ncum=0\n\nans=sum(xs)*b\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code doesn't have a prefix sum array. So perhaps the code needs to compute the prefix sums. \n\nWait, the code's initial ans is sum(xs)*b, which is S[n] *b. \n\nThe loop is over each i (from 0 to n-1). For each i, we can compute the cost_i as above. \n\nTo compute this, we need S[i], the prefix sum up to i (i.e., sum of first i elements, which is x[0] to x[i-1]). \n\nWait, in code, the xs list is 0-based. So for the i-th element (0-based), the prefix sum up to i is sum(xs[0..i-1]). \n\nThus, the code needs to precompute the prefix sums. \n\nSo, in the code, perhaps the first step is to compute the prefix sums. \n\nWait, the code currently has cum=0. Maybe that's for the prefix sum. \n\nWait, the code's current code for solve() is:\n\ndef solve():\n\n    n,a,b=map(int,input().split())\n\n    xs=list(map(int,input().split()))\n\n    cum=0\n\n    ans=sum(xs)*b\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print(ans)\n\nSo, the cum variable is initialized to 0, but not used. \n\nThe missing code in the loop must compute the cost_i for each i and update the ans if it's smaller. \n\nSo, first, we need to compute the prefix sums. Let's see:\n\nWe can compute the prefix array. Let's create a prefix array S where S[0] =0, S[1] =xs[0], S[2] =xs[0]+xs[1], etc. \n\nAlternatively, since the code has cum=0, perhaps we can track the prefix sum as we go. \n\nWait, let's think of the loop:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current x is xs[i]\n\n    the prefix sum up to i (sum of first i elements) is S[i] = sum(xs[0..i-1])\n\n    so S[i] can be tracked with a variable. \n\nWait, the code has cum=0. Maybe that's the current prefix sum up to i. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, cum is 0. \n\nAt i=0, the prefix sum up to 0 is 0 (since S[0] =0). \n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nthe prefix sum up to i is S[i] = cum before adding xs[i]. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should track the prefix sum as follows:\n\nInitialize S as a list, but given that n can be up to 2e5, it's better to compute on the fly. \n\nAlternatively, in the loop, for each i, the prefix sum up to i (S[i]) can be tracked with a variable. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitialize cum =0 (this will be S[0] =0). \n\nThen, for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nthe current x is xs[i]\n\nthe prefix sum up to i (S[i]) is cum. \n\nThen, after processing i, we add xs[i] to cum, so that cum becomes S[i+1]. \n\nThus, in the loop:\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n    current x is xs[i]\n\n    S_i = cum (sum of first i elements)\n\n    compute the cost_i as:\n\n    a*x[i] + b*( (2*i -n -1)*x[i] + (total_sum - 2*S_i) )\n\n    where total_sum is sum(xs) = S[n]\n\n    then, ans = min(ans, cost_i)\n\n    then, cum += xs[i]\n\nWait, that's possible. \n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- compute the total_sum = sum(xs)\n\n- initialize cum=0, and then loop over each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    compute S_i = cum (sum of first i elements)\n\n    compute the cost_i as:\n\n    a * x[i] + b * ( (2*i -n -1)*x[i] + (total_sum - 2*S_i) )\n\n    then, compare with ans and keep the minimum.\n\n    then, add x[i] to cum.\n\nThus, the code's missing part would be:\n\ntotal_sum = sum(xs)\n\ncum =0\n\nans = total_sum * b\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    x_i = xs[i]\n\n    s_i = cum\n\n    term = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (total_sum - 2*s_i) )\n\n    if term < ans:\n\n        ans = term\n\n    cum += x_i\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the initial ans is set to sum(xs)*b, which is correct. \n\nSo the code's loop needs to compute this term for each i and update ans. \n\nThus, the missing code in program1.py's loop is:\n\ntotal_sum = sum(xs)\n\ncum =0\n\nans = total_sum * b\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    x_i = xs[i]\n\n    s_i = cum\n\n    term = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (total_sum - 2*s_i) )\n\n    if term < ans:\n\n        ans = term\n\n    cum += x_i\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the cum is initialized to 0 before the loop. So perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\ndef solve():\n\n    n,a,b=map(int,input().split())\n\n    xs=list(map(int,input().split()))\n\n    cum=0\n\n    ans=sum(xs)*b\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    print(ans)\n\nSo, the code needs to compute the term for each i. \n\nThe code can compute the total_sum as sum(xs), but since ans is already set to that, perhaps it's already computed. \n\nWait, the code's initial ans is sum(xs)*b, so total_sum is sum(xs). \n\nThus, inside the loop, for each i:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum (the sum of the first i elements, since before adding xs[i], cum is the sum up to i-1 elements. Wait, let's see:\n\nInitially, cum is 0. \n\nAt i=0:\n\ns_i = cum (0) \u2192 which is the sum of first 0 elements (correct).\n\nThen, after processing, cum += xs[0], so cum becomes xs[0], which is the sum of first 1 element (i=1). \n\nThus, the code can proceed as:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum\n\nterm = a*x_i + b*( (2*i -n -1)*x_i + (total_sum - 2*s_i) )\n\nif term < ans:\n\n    ans = term\n\ncum += x_i\n\nThus, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum\n\nterm = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (sum(xs) - 2*s_i) )\n\nif term < ans:\n\n    ans = term\n\ncum += x_i\n\nWait, but sum(xs) is already stored as ans / b. But perhaps better to compute it once. \n\nWait, the code can precompute total_sum = sum(xs) before the loop. \n\nSo modifying the code:\n\ndef solve():\n\n    n,a,b=map(int,input().split())\n\n    xs=list(map(int,input().split()))\n\n    total_sum = sum(xs)\n\n    cum=0\n\n    ans = total_sum * b\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        x_i = xs[i]\n\n        s_i = cum\n\n        term = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (total_sum - 2*s_i) )\n\n        if term < ans:\n\n            ans = term\n\n        cum += x_i\n\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the initial code has cum=0, and the loop is over i in range(n). So the code needs to add the missing lines inside the loop. \n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum\n\nterm = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (sum(xs) - 2*s_i) )\n\nif term < ans:\n\n    ans = term\n\ncum += x_i\n\nWait, but sum(xs) is already stored as total_sum. So better to compute that first. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\ntotal_sum = sum(xs)\n\ncum =0\n\nans = total_sum * b\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    x_i = xs[i]\n\n    s_i = cum\n\n    term = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (total_sum - 2*s_i) )\n\n    if term < ans:\n\n        ans = term\n\n    cum += x_i\n\nBut in the code provided, the initial code has:\n\ncum=0\n\nans=sum(xs)*b\n\nSo the code can compute total_sum as sum(xs), but since ans is already set to that, perhaps it's redundant. \n\nThus, the code's missing lines inside the loop are:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum\n\nterm = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (sum(xs) - 2*s_i) )\n\nif term < ans:\n\n    ans = term\n\ncum += x_i\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop is already inside the solve function, so the variables n, a, b, xs are available. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum\n\nterm = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (sum(xs) - 2*s_i) )\n\nif term < ans:\n\n    ans = term\n\ncum += x_i\n\nSo the code for program1's missing part is:\n\nInside the for loop:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum\n\nterm = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i - n -1)*x_i + (sum(xs) - 2*s_i) )\n\nif term < ans:\n\n    ans = term\n\ncum += x_i\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the loop is written as:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code must be inserted there. \n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is the four lines above. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. \n\nThe approach given in the code is to try all possible starting points (i) and compute the minimal moves from there. \n\nThe code loops over each i, and for each i, it sets t as the array of b's, but the code is trying to compute the minimal moves. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n\n    t=[0]*n\n\n    temp=0\n\n    j=i-1\n\n    prev =0\n\n    while j>=0:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    k=i+1\n\n    prev=0\n\n    while k<len(a):\n\n        x=(ceil((prev+1)/a[k]))\n\n        temp+=x\n\n        prev=(a[k]*x)\n\n        k+=1\n\n    ans=min(ans,temp)\n\nThe idea is that for each i, we consider it as the peak, and compute the required moves for the left and right parts. \n\nWait, the code is trying to set the i-th element as the starting point, and then compute the minimal moves for the left and right. \n\nThe right part is handled by the k loop. For each element after i, we need to ensure that b[k] > prev (the previous element's b value). \n\nThe code for the right part seems correct: for each k starting from i+1, the required b[k] must be at least prev +1. Since b starts at 0, the minimal steps to reach that is ceil((prev+1)/a[k]). \n\nWait, the current b[k] is 0. To make it at least prev+1, the minimal steps are ceil( (prev+1)/a[k] ), since each step can add or subtract a[k]. But since we can choose to add or subtract, but we need to reach a value >= prev+1. \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach a value >= target is ceil( (target - current)/a[k] ), but since current is 0, it's ceil(target /a[k]). \n\nWait, the code uses ceil( (prev+1)/a[k] ), which is correct because the required value is at least prev+1. \n\nThe left part (j loop) is missing. \n\nThe left part is for elements before i. For those, we need to ensure that their b values are strictly less than the next element. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the array is strictly increasing. So for each element before i, their b must be less than the next element's b. \n\nWait, the code's approach is to set the i-th element as a reference point, and compute the required moves for the left and right. \n\nFor the left part (j = i-1, i-2, etc.), we need to ensure that each b[j] < b[j+1]. \n\nThe code's j loop is going backward from i-1 to 0. \n\nThe current approach for the left part is missing. \n\nThe code has prev initialized to 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the left part is handled by ensuring that each previous element is less than the next. \n\nLet me think: \n\nSuppose we are processing the left side (elements before i). \n\nWe start from j =i-1 and go backward to 0. \n\nThe previous element (the one after j) is at j+1, which has a certain b value. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the previous value (prev) and compute the required steps for the current j. \n\nFor the left part (elements before i), the current element must be less than the next element (j+1). \n\nSuppose we are at position j, and the next element (j+1) has a b value of prev. \n\nThe current element's b[j] must be less than prev. \n\nThe current b[j] starts at 0. \n\nTo make it less than prev, we can subtract some multiple of a[j]. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to subtract enough to make b[j] as large as possible but still less than prev. \n\nWait, the maximum possible b[j] can be is prev -1. \n\nThe current b[j] is 0. \n\nSo the required value is (prev -1) -0 = prev-1. \n\nWait, but since we can subtract, the minimal steps would be to subtract (0 - (prev-1)) / a[j], but since steps can be adding or subtracting. \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach a value less than prev is to set b[j] to prev-1. \n\nThe required delta is (prev-1) -0 = prev-1. \n\nBut since we can subtract, the steps needed are (prev-1)/a[j], but since we can choose to subtract, the steps would be (prev-1)/a[j], rounded up? \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach a value <= prev-1 is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ), but since we can subtract, the steps would be (prev-1) // a[j], but since we can choose to subtract, the steps would be (prev-1) // a[j] if it's exactly divisible, else (prev-1) //a[j] +1? \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach a value of exactly prev-1 is (prev-1)/a[j], but since you can only add or subtract multiples of a[j], the minimal steps would be ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if you can reach it by subtracting. \n\nWait, the current b[j] is 0. To get to (prev-1), you can subtract (0 - (prev-1)) = prev-1. \n\nThe number of steps is (prev-1)/a[j], but since each step subtracts a[j], so steps = (prev-1) // a[j], but if (prev-1) is not divisible by a[j], then you need to round up. \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach a value <= prev-1 is the minimal x such that 0 - x*a[j] <= prev-1. \n\nWait, the desired value is <= prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the minimal x where 0 - x*a[j] <= prev-1 \u2192 x >= (0 - (prev-1))/a[j]. \n\nBut since x must be a non-negative integer (since you can choose to subtract a[j] x times). \n\nWait, the minimal x is ceil( (prev -1)/a[j] ), but I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, the required value is at most prev-1. \n\nThe maximum possible value we can have is prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that is (prev-1)/a[j], but since each step subtracts a[j], the steps needed are (prev-1) // a[j], but if there's a remainder, you need to add 1. \n\nWait, for example, if a[j] is 3 and prev-1 is 4, then 4//3 is 1, but 3*1=3, which is less than 4. So you can subtract once to get -3, which is less than prev-1 (4). Wait, no, the desired value is to have b[j] < prev. \n\nWait, the current b[j] is 0. To make it less than prev, the maximum possible is prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach a value of (prev-1) is (prev-1)/a[j], but since you can only subtract, the steps would be (prev-1)/a[j], but since you can't have fractions, you need to take ceiling? \n\nWait, let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose a[j] is 2, and prev is 5. \n\nWe need b[j] <5 \u2192 maximum is 4. \n\nThe current b[j] is 0. \n\nTo reach 4, subtract 0 - 4 = -4 \u2192 steps needed: 4/2 = 2 steps (subtract 2 twice). \n\nSo steps are 2. \n\nWhich is (4)/2 =2. \n\nAnother example: prev is 5, a[j] is 3. \n\nWe need to reach 4. \n\n0 - x*3 <=4 \u2192 x*3 >= -4 \u2192 x can be 0 (0 is allowed, but 0 is not less than 5. Wait, no, the current b[j] is 0, which is less than prev (5). So in this case, no steps are needed. \n\nAh! Wait, the current b[j] is 0, which is already less than prev (5). So no steps needed. \n\nWait, so the condition is that b[j] must be less than the next element's b. \n\nThe next element's b is prev. \n\nSo the current b[j] can be anything less than prev. \n\nThe current b[j] is 0, which is already less than prev (as long as prev is positive). \n\nWait, but prev is the value of the next element (j+1). \n\nWait, in the code's left loop, the prev is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's approach. \n\nThe code's approach for the left part (j loop) is to process elements from i-1 down to 0. \n\nThe variable prev is the value of the next element (j+1). \n\nInitially, for j =i-1, the next element is i, which has b[i] =0 (since t is initialized to 0). \n\nWait, the code's t array is initialized to 0 for all elements. \n\nWait, the code's approach is to choose a starting point i, and then compute the minimal steps required to make the array increasing. \n\nThe code's approach for the right side (k loop) is to compute the steps needed for each element after i to be greater than the previous. \n\nFor the left side (elements before i), the code is trying to ensure that each element is less than the next. \n\nThe code's j loop is going backward from i-1 to 0. \n\nThe prev variable represents the value of the next element (j+1). \n\nInitially, for j =i-1, the next element is i, which has b[i] =0 (since t is initialized to 0). \n\nWait, but the code's t array is not being used here. The code is using prev to track the required previous value. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps without explicitly tracking the array. \n\nLet me think of the left part: \n\nWe need to ensure that for each j from 0 to i-1, b[j] < b[j+1]. \n\nWe process from j =i-1 down to 0. \n\nAt each step j, the next element (j+1) has a certain value (prev). \n\nThe current element (j) must be less than prev. \n\nThe current b[j] starts at 0. \n\nTo make it less than prev, we can subtract some multiple of a[j]. \n\nThe maximum possible value for b[j] is prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps needed to reach that value is (prev-1 -0)/ (-a[j]) \u2192 but since steps can be subtracting, the steps are (0 - (prev-1)) / a[j] \u2192 (prev-1)/a[j], rounded up? \n\nWait, the required delta is (prev-1) -0 \u2192 but since we can only subtract, the steps are (prev-1)/a[j], but since each step subtracts a[j], the steps needed are ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ). \n\nWait, the steps needed to reach a value of (prev-1) is (prev-1)/a[j], but since each step subtracts a[j], the number of steps is (prev-1)/a[j], but since it's subtraction, the steps are (prev-1) // a[j], but if there's a remainder, you need to add 1. \n\nWait, let me see with an example. \n\nSuppose prev is 5, a[j] is 2. \n\nWe need to reach 4. \n\nSteps: 4/2 =2 steps (subtract 2 twice \u2192 0-2*2 =-4 \u2192 which is less than 5. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAnother example: prev is 6, a[j] is 4. \n\nWe need to reach 5. \n\n5/4 is 1.25 \u2192 ceil(5/4) is 2 steps. \n\n2 steps: 0 -4*2 =-8 \u2192 which is less than 6. \n\nWait, but 5 is the desired value. \n\nWait, the maximum allowed is prev-1 =5. \n\nThe steps needed to reach exactly 5 would be (5)/4 \u2192 1.25 \u2192 so 2 steps (since you can't do fractions). \n\nBut with 2 steps, you get -8, which is less than 5. \n\nWait, but the problem allows any value less than prev. So the minimal steps would be to reach the maximum possible (prev-1), but if that's not possible, you can choose a lower value. \n\nWait, the minimal steps would be the minimal steps to reach a value less than prev. \n\nThe maximum possible value is prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that is (prev-1)/a[j], rounded up? \n\nWait, the steps needed to reach exactly prev-1 is (prev-1)/a[j], but since each step subtracts a[j], the steps are (prev-1)/a[j], but since you can't have fractions, you need to take the ceiling of (prev-1)/a[j]. \n\nWait, no. Let me think of prev-1 divided by a[j]. \n\nIf (prev-1) is divisible by a[j], then steps = (prev-1)/a[j]. \n\nElse, steps = (prev-1)//a[j] +1. \n\nWait, for example, prev-1=5, a[j]=2 \u2192 5/2=2.5 \u2192 steps needed 3? \n\nWait, 0 -3*2 =-6 <5 \u2192 yes, but 2 steps would give -4 which is also less than 5. \n\nAh, so actually, the minimal steps is the minimal x such that 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > (0 - (prev-1)) \u2192 x > (prev-1)/a[j]. \n\nWait, the inequality is 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > -prev \u2192 but since a[j] is positive, this is always true for x>=0. \n\nWait, that can't be right. \n\nWait, the condition is that b[j] < prev. \n\nb[j] =0 -x*a[j] \n\nWe need 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > -prev \u2192 since a[j] is positive, this is always true for any x. \n\nWait, that can't be. \n\nWait, the current b[j] is 0. To have it less than prev, we just need 0 < prev. \n\nBut prev is the value of the next element (j+1). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is that the next element's value is prev, so the current element must be less than that. \n\nThe current element's value is 0, so if prev is positive, then it's already okay. \n\nWait, this suggests that the left side requires no steps. \n\nBut that can't be right. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's approach. \n\nWait, the code's approach for the right side is to set each element to be at least prev+1. \n\nFor the left side, perhaps the code is ensuring that each element is at most prev-1. \n\nBut how? \n\nWait, the code's left loop is trying to compute the steps needed to make sure that b[j] < b[j+1]. \n\nThe next element (j+1) has a value of prev. \n\nThe current element (j) must be less than prev. \n\nThe current b[j] is 0. \n\nSo, if prev is greater than 0, then 0 is already less than prev. So no steps needed. \n\nBut if prev is 0, then we need to make b[j] <0. \n\nIn that case, we have to subtract some multiple of a[j]. \n\nThe minimal steps would be 1 step (subtract a[j], making it -a[j]). \n\nThus, the code's left loop must handle cases where prev is 0. \n\nWait, the code's left loop is processing elements from i-1 down to 0. \n\nInitially, for j =i-1, the next element (j+1 =i) has a value of 0 (since t is initialized to 0). \n\nSo prev is 0. \n\nThus, the current element (j =i-1) must be less than 0. \n\nThe current b[j] is 0. \n\nSo we need to subtract at least once. \n\nThe steps needed are ceil( (0 - (prev-1))/a[j] )? \n\nWait, prev is 0, so prev-1 is -1. \n\nThe desired value is less than 0 \u2192 can be -1, -2, etc. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach -1 is 1 step (subtract a[j] once). \n\nThus, the steps needed are 1. \n\nSo the code's left loop must compute this. \n\nThe code's left loop has:\n\nprev =0 \n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\n    j -=1\n\nSo inside the loop, for each j, we need to compute the steps required to make b[j] < prev. \n\nThe current b[j] is 0. \n\nThe required value is < prev. \n\nThe minimal steps are the minimal x such that 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > -prev \u2192 since a[j] is positive, this is always true for x >=0. \n\nWait, but if prev is negative, then this could require steps. \n\nWait, prev is the value of the next element (j+1). \n\nInitially, for j =i-1, the next element is i, which has b[i] =0. \n\nThus, prev is 0. \n\nSo for j =i-1, the required is b[j] <0 \u2192 so steps needed are ceil( (0 - (prev-1))/a[j] )? \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is similar to the right side but in reverse. \n\nFor the right side, each element must be at least prev+1. \n\nFor the left side, each element must be at most prev-1. \n\nThus, the required value for b[j] is at most prev-1. \n\nThe current value is 0. \n\nThus, the required delta is (prev-1) -0 \u2192 but since we can only subtract, the steps needed are (prev-1)/a[j], but since it's subtraction, the steps are (prev-1)/a[j], rounded up. \n\nWait, the steps needed to reach a value of (prev-1) is (prev-1)/a[j], but since each step subtracts a[j], the steps are (prev-1)/a[j], but since it's subtraction, the steps are (prev-1)/a[j], but if it's not divisible, you need to round up. \n\nWait, the formula would be steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ), but only if prev-1 is positive. \n\nWait, if prev is 0, then prev-1 is -1. \n\nSo steps needed to reach -1 is 1 step (subtract a[j] once). \n\nThus, the formula would be steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ), but since prev-1 can be negative, we need to take the ceiling of a negative number. \n\nWait, let's think of the steps needed to reach a value <= prev-1. \n\nThe current value is 0. \n\nWe need 0 - x*a[j] <= prev-1 \u2192 x*a[j] >= -(prev-1) \u2192 x >= ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j]. \n\nSince x must be an integer >=0, the minimal x is ceil( ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] ). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev is 0 \u2192 -(prev-1) =1 \u2192 x >= 1/a[j]. \n\nSince a[j] is at least 1, so x >=1 \u2192 x=1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: prev is 5 \u2192 -(prev-1) =-4 \u2192 x >= -4/a[j]. \n\nBut since a[j] is positive, this is x >= negative number \u2192 x can be 0. \n\nThus, steps needed is 0. \n\nThus, the formula for steps is ceil( ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] ). \n\nWait, but since prev-1 can be negative, -(prev-1) is positive when prev <1. \n\nThus, the steps needed are ceil( ( (prev-1) ) / a[j] ) if prev-1 is negative? \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 >=0, else 0. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the required is to have b[j] =0 -x*a[j] <= prev-1. \n\nThe minimal x is the smallest integer such that x >= (0 - (prev-1))/a[j]. \n\nBecause:\n\n0 -x*a[j] <= prev-1 \u2192 -x*a[j] <= prev-1 \u2192 x*a[j] >= -(prev-1) \u2192 x >= ceil( ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] )\n\nWait, since x must be an integer >=0. \n\nThus, the steps needed are x = max(0, ceil( ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] ) )\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev is 0 \u2192 -(prev-1) =1 \u2192 x >= 1/a[j]. \n\nSince a[j] is at least 1, x must be at least 1 \u2192 steps 1. \n\nprev is 5 \u2192 -(prev-1) =-4 \u2192 x >= -4/a[j]. \n\nSince a[j] is positive, this is x >= -4/a[j], which is always true for x>=0. \n\nThus, steps needed is 0. \n\nprev is 1 \u2192 -(prev-1)=0 \u2192 x >=0 \u2192 steps can be 0. \n\nThus, the formula is steps = ceil( ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] ), but since a[j] is positive, and we need to take the ceiling of a positive number when prev-1 is negative. \n\nWait, but ( -(prev-1) ) / a[j] is (1 - prev)/a[j]. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 >=0, else 0. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the steps needed are the minimal x such that 0 -x*a[j] <= prev-1 \u2192 x >= (0 - (prev-1))/a[j] \u2192 x >= (1 - prev)/a[j]. \n\nSince x must be an integer >=0, the minimal x is the ceiling of (1 - prev)/a[j], but only if (1 - prev)/a[j] is positive. \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the steps needed are the minimal x such that 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > (0 - (prev-1)) \u2192 x > (prev-1)/a[j]. \n\nWait, the inequality is 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > -prev \u2192 x > -prev/a[j]. \n\nSince a[j] is positive, this is always true for x >=0 when prev is positive. \n\nThus, when prev is positive, no steps are needed. \n\nOnly when prev is 0 or negative, steps are needed. \n\nWait, prev is the value of the next element (j+1). \n\nInitially, for j =i-1, the next element is i, which has b[i] =0. \n\nThus, prev is 0. \n\nSo steps needed are to make b[j] <0 \u2192 subtract at least once. \n\nThus, steps = ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) \u2192 (0-1)/a[j] \u2192 -1/a[j]. \n\nTaking the ceiling of that would give 0, but that's not correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula for the left side is similar to the right side but in reverse. \n\nFor the right side, each element must be at least prev+1. \n\nThe steps needed are ceil( (prev+1)/a[k] ), since the current is 0. \n\nFor the left side, each element must be at most prev-1. \n\nThe steps needed are ceil( (prev-1 -0)/ (-a[j]) ), but since steps can only be positive integers (subtracting a[j] each step). \n\nWait, the required delta is (prev-1) -0 \u2192 but since we can only subtract, the steps needed to reach prev-1 is (0 - (prev-1)) / a[j] \u2192 (1 - prev)/a[j]. \n\nBut since steps can't be negative, if prev-1 is negative (i.e., prev <1), then steps needed are ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] ). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev is 0 \u2192 (1-0)/a[j] \u2192 1/a[j]. \n\nThus steps needed is ceil(1/a[j]). \n\nSince a[j] is at least 1, this is 1. \n\nprev is -1 \u2192 (1 - (-1))/a[j] \u2192 2/a[j]. \n\nSteps needed is ceil(2/a[j]). \n\nBut prev can't be negative because it's the value of the next element, which is being processed in the right loop. \n\nWait, the next element's value is being built up. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's left loop is tracking the previous value (prev) and updating it as it goes. \n\nLet me think of the code's left loop:\n\nInitially, prev is 0 (for j =i-1, the next element is i, which has b[i] =0). \n\nThen, for j =i-1:\n\nWe need to compute the steps needed to make b[j] < prev (0). \n\nThe steps are ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) \u2192 (0-1)/a[j] \u2192 -1/a[j]. \n\nTaking the ceiling of that would give 0, but that's not correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is different. \n\nAlternatively, the steps needed are the minimal x such that 0 -x*a[j] < prev \u2192 x*a[j] > (0 - prev) \u2192 x > -prev/a[j]. \n\nSince prev is 0, this is x>0 \u2192 x>=1. \n\nThus steps needed is 1. \n\nThus, the formula is steps = max(1, ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ))? \n\nNo, that's not general. \n\nAlternatively, the steps needed are ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 >=0, else 1. \n\nWait, when prev is 0, prev-1 is -1 \u2192 steps needed is 1. \n\nWhen prev is 1 \u2192 prev-1 is 0 \u2192 steps needed is 0. \n\nWhen prev is 2 \u2192 steps needed is ceil(1/a[j]). \n\nWait, for prev=2, a[j]=3 \u2192 steps needed is 0.5 \u2192 ceil(0.5)=1 \u2192 but 0-3*1 =-3 <2 \u2192 yes. \n\nBut the maximum allowed is 1 (prev-1=1). \n\nTo reach 1, steps needed is (1)/3 \u2192 0.333 \u2192 ceil(0.333) is 1 \u2192 but 0-3*1 =-3 <1. \n\nWait, but the maximum allowed is 1, so the minimal steps to reach 1 is 0.333 \u2192 but you can't do that. \n\nThus, the minimal steps to reach a value <=1 is 0 steps (0 is already less than 2). \n\nAh! So when prev is 2, the current b[j] is 0, which is already less than 2. So no steps needed. \n\nThus, the steps needed are only when prev is 0 or negative. \n\nThus, the steps needed are ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 <0 \u2192 i.e., when prev <1. \n\nWait, when prev is 0 \u2192 steps needed is ceil( (0-1)/a[j] ) \u2192 ceil(-1/a[j]). \n\nSince a[j] is positive, this is -1/a[j], which is negative. The ceiling of a negative number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to it. \n\nFor example, if a[j] is 2 \u2192 -0.5 \u2192 ceiling is -0 \u2192 0? \n\nWait, no. The ceiling of -0.5 is -0 \u2192 but in integers, it's -0 is 0. \n\nWait, ceil(-0.5) is -0 \u2192 but in integers, it's -0 is 0. \n\nThus, the steps would be 0, but that's incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct formula for the left side is similar to the right side but with a different sign. \n\nFor the right side, the required value is at least prev+1 \u2192 steps = ceil( (prev+1)/a[k] )\n\nFor the left side, the required value is at most prev-1 \u2192 steps = ceil( (prev-1 -0)/ (-a[j]) ) \u2192 but since steps can only be positive (subtracting), the formula is steps = ceil( (0 - (prev-1))/a[j] ) \u2192 ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\nThus, the steps needed are ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\nBut only if this is positive. \n\nThus, steps = max(0, ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] ) )\n\nWait, let's test this formula:\n\nprev=0 \u2192 (1-0)/a[j] \u2192 1/a[j]. \n\nIf a[j] is 2 \u2192 0.5 \u2192 ceil(0.5)=1 \u2192 correct. \n\nprev=1 \u2192 (1-1)/a[j] \u21920 \u2192 steps 0 \u2192 correct. \n\nprev=2 \u2192 (1-2)/a[j] \u2192-1/a[j] \u2192 ceil(-0.5) is -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 correct. \n\nprev=-1 \u2192 (1 - (-1))/a[j] \u21922/a[j]. \n\nIf a[j]=3 \u2192 2/3 \u2192 ceil(0.666)=1 \u2192 steps 1 \u2192 which would make b[j] =0-3*1 =-3 < -1 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, this formula seems correct. \n\nThus, the steps needed for the left side are ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] ), and we add this to the temp variable. \n\nAlso, after computing the steps, the new value of b[j] is 0 - steps*a[j]. \n\nBut we need to update prev to this new value for the next iteration. \n\nWait, the next element (j+1) has a value of prev. \n\nThe current element's new value is 0 - steps*a[j]. \n\nThis new value must be less than prev. \n\nThus, the new prev for the next iteration (j-1) is the current b[j]'s new value. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe next element (j+1) has a value of prev. \n\nThe current element (j) is being processed, and its new value is 0 - steps*a[j]. \n\nThe next element (j+1) is already processed, so the previous element (j-1) must be less than the current element's new value. \n\nThus, after processing j, the new prev is the current element's new value. \n\nThus, in the code's left loop:\n\nsteps = ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\ntemp += steps \n\nnew_b_j = 0 - steps*a[j]\n\nprev = new_b_j \n\nThus, the code's left loop should be:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = (1 - prev) \n\n    steps_needed = math.ceil( required / a[j] )\n\n    if steps_needed <0:\n\n        steps_needed =0 \n\n    temp += steps_needed \n\n    new_val = 0 - steps_needed * a[j]\n\n    prev = new_val \n\n    j -=1 \n\nWait, but the code has to import math for ceil. \n\nThe code provided for program2.py has from math import ceil. \n\nThus, the missing code in the left loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = (1 - prev)\n\n    steps_needed = ceil( required / a[j] )\n\n    if steps_needed <0:\n\n        steps_needed =0 \n\n    temp += steps_needed \n\n    prev = 0 - steps_needed * a[j]\n\n    j -=1 \n\nWait, but required is (1 - prev). \n\nWait, the formula is steps_needed = ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\nBut if (1 - prev) is negative, then steps_needed could be negative. \n\nThus, we need to take max(0, steps_needed). \n\nAlternatively, the steps_needed is max(0, ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )). \n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    delta = (1 - prev)\n\n    steps = delta // a[j]\n\n    if delta % a[j] !=0:\n\n        steps +=1 \n\n    steps = max(0, steps)\n\n    temp += steps \n\n    prev = 0 - steps * a[j]\n\n    j -=1 \n\nAlternatively, using math.ceil:\n\nsteps_needed = max(0, math.ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] ) )\n\nThus, the code's missing part for the left loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    steps_needed = ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\n    if steps_needed <0:\n\n        steps_needed =0 \n\n    temp += steps_needed \n\n    prev = 0 - steps_needed * a[j]\n\n    j -=1 \n\nThus, the missing code for program2's left loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    steps_needed = ceil( (1 - prev)/a[j] )\n\n    if steps_needed <0:\n\n        steps_needed =0 \n\n    temp += steps_needed \n\n    prev = 0 - steps_needed * a[j]\n\n    j -=1 \n\nBut in code, it's written as:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThus, the missing code is the four lines above. \n\nNow for program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to compute the area of the red region in a convex polygon where all interior angles are at least 90 degrees. The red region consists of all points Q such that there exists a chord of length \u22641 passing through Q. \n\nThe code provided has a lot of complex functions and seems to be using some geometric formulas. \n\nThe code's get_area function has a lot of math involving angles and binary search. \n\nThe problem requires finding the area of the region covered by all points within distance 0.5 from any chord of length \u22641. \n\nThe red region is the union of all such points. \n\nThe area can be computed as the area of the polygon minus the area of the regions not covered by any such chords. \n\nAlternatively, the red region is the Minkowski sum of the polygon with a disk of radius 0.5, but clipped to the polygon. \n\nBut the problem states that the red region is the set of points inside the polygon that are on some chord of length \u22641. \n\nThe area is the union of all such points. \n\nThe code's approach seems to involve calculating the area contribution from each edge and corner. \n\nThe code's get_area function is called for each edge or vertex, and the total area is summed. \n\nThe binary_find function is a helper for some geometric computation. \n\nThe code's binary_find function has a TODO in the first if condition. \n\nLooking at the code for binary_find:\n\nwhile math.fabs(cy -

alpha_1. \n\nThe mid_a is computed as (ra + la)/2. \n\nIf yy < mid_y \u2192 the current mid_a is too small, so we need to increase la. \n\nThus, the code should set la = mid_a. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nla = mid_a \n\nThus, the code inside the first if block is:\n\nla = mid_a \n\nSo the missing code for program3's binary_find function is:\n\nif yy < mid_y:\n\n    la = mid_a \n\nThus, the code's missing part is simply \"la = mid_a\".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe three missing parts are:\n\nProgram1: \n\nInside the loop for each i:\n\nx_i = xs[i]\n\ns_i = cum\n\nterm = a * x_i + b * ( (2*i -
