The edges are:\n\nTop and bottom (length 5 each). Left and right (length 3 each). The total boundary area is 2*(3+5) -4 = 12. Suppose a=4. The tiles can be arranged as follows: Along the top edge (length 5), perhaps place a tile of length 4 (since a=4) and another of length 1 (since 4+1=5).

Thus, the only constraint is that the boundary area must be divisible by a. But then why in the first test case, a=4 is not allowed? Wait the boundary area is 12. 12 mod 4 is 0. So a=4 should be allowed. But the sample's first case includes a=3 but not 4. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait the sample's first case's answer includes a=3. Let's see:\n\nThe boundary area is 12. 12 mod 3 is 0. But the vertical edges are length 3. So for a=3, the vertical edges can be covered with tiles of length 3 (so one tile per edge). The horizontal edges (length 5) can be covered with tiles of length 1 (since 5 mod 1 is 0). Thus, it works. For a=4, the boundary area is divisible by 4 (12/4=3). The vertical edges (3) can be covered with tiles of length 1 (since 3 mod 1 is 0). The horizontal edges (5) can be covered with tiles of length 1 (5 mod 1=0).

So a tile of length 12 can't be placed along them. Ah! So the tiles must have their length (a) not exceeding the edge's length. Thus, the a must be a divisor of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and also a must be <= the minimum of (w, l). Wait, but in the first test case, a=4 is a divisor of 12, but 4 is larger than the vertical edge's length (3). So a=4 can't be used. Ah! That's probably the missing condition. Thus, the valid a's are the divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and also a must be <= the minimum of (w, l). Wait, but in the first test case, the minimum of w and l is 3. So a must be <=3. Thus, the valid a's are the divisors of 12 that are <=3. Those are 1,2,3. Which matches the sample. Similarly, a=4 is a divisor but exceeds 3, so it's excluded. Ah! So the conditions are:\n\na must divide the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and a must be <= min(w, l). Wait, but what about the other edges? For example, in the first case, the horizontal edges are length 5. So a=4 is allowed for those edges (since 5 >=4?), but the vertical edges are 3. Thus, the a must be <= the minimum of the edge lengths. Wait, the edges have lengths w and l. So the minimum between w and l. Thus, the a must be a divisor of the boundary area and also a <= min(w, l). So the code must find all divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and then filter those divisors to be <= min(w, l). Wait, but the code in program2.py is currently using half_perimeter (w + l -2) as the value to find divisors. Wait, the boundary area is 2*(half_perimeter). So the code should be finding divisors of 2*(half_perimeter). The current code is looping over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nHmm, so the code is incorrect. The correct approach is to compute the boundary area as 2*(w + l -2), then find all its divisors, then filter those divisors to be <= min(w, l). But the code in program2.py is using half_perimeter (w + l -2) and finding its divisors. So the code is incorrect. The problem requires that a must divide the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and a must be <= min(w, l). Thus, the code should first compute the boundary area as 2*(w + l -2). Then find all its divisors. Then filter those divisors to be <= min(w, l).",

The tiles placed along them must have their length (a) such that w mod a is 0. But the code's condition is mod_a <=2. Hmm, perhaps the code is trying to allow some flexibility. Alternatively, the code is trying to ensure that the remainder is small enough to be covered by the interior. This is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps the correct approach for the missing code in program2 is to add a to the solutions if mod_a <=2. The code's current line is:\n\nif mod_a <=2:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nPerhaps the code should add a to the solutions set.

So returns True \u2192 \"YES\". The second sample case is [1,2,3]. The function checks 2 mod1 ==0 (yes), 3 mod1 ==0 (yes). So returns True \u2192 \"YES\". The third test case is [3,6,9,12]. The function checks 6 mod3=0, 9 mod3=0, 12 mod3=0 \u2192 returns True \u2192 \"YES\". But what about a case like [2,3]. The function would return 3 mod2=1 \u2192 not divisible \u2192 returns False \u2192 \"NO\". But what is the correct answer? The allowed operations are to subtract a_i-1 from a_i. For [2,3], the initial a is [2,3]. We can do a_i=2: subtract 2 from 3 \u2192 becomes 1. Then again subtract 2 \u2192 becomes -1. But the problem allows any number of operations, but the array elements must be non-negative? Wait the problem says the array consists of positive integers. But after operations, can they be zero?

So the operations can be done until a_i becomes zero. Thus, for [2,3], the first operation gives [2,1], then another gives [2,-1], which is invalid. Thus, the correct answer is \"NO\". The function returns False, which is correct. Another test case: [5, 10]. The function returns True, which is correct. Another test case: [4,6]. The function returns 6 mod4=2 \u2192 no.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "text": "Your code here\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n\n        print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n\nThe code's problem is in reading the test cases. The first element of input_arr is t (number of test cases). Then, for each test case, the first line is n, followed by n numbers. The current code reads the first element as n (the first test case's n?), which is wrong. The code's current code has:\n\nn = input_arr[0]\n\ntest_cases = []\n\npos =1\n\nwhile pos <= len_input -1:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is incorrect. The correct way to read the input is:\n\nThe first element is t. Then, for each test case:\n\n- read n, then read n numbers. Thus, the code should be:\n\npos = 0 \n\nt = input_arr[pos]\n\npos +=1 \n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    pos +=1 \n\n    a = input_arr[pos: pos +n]\n\n    pos +=n \n\n    test_cases.append(a) Thus, the missing code in the TODO is to read the test cases properly. The current code's pos starts at 1, but the first element is t. The code's current code has:\n\ninput_arr[0] is t. \n\nThe code's first line after reading input is:\n\nn = input_arr[0]\n\nWhich is wrong. The correct code should read t first. Thus, the code's missing part is:\n\nt = input_arr[0]\n\npos =1 \n\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    pos +=1 \n\n    arr = input_arr[pos: pos +n]\n\n    test_cases.append(arr)\n\n    pos +=n \n\nThus , the code's TODO section should be replaced with this. So the missing code for program3 is:\n\nt = input_arr[0]\n\npos = 1\n\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    pos +=1\n\n    case = input_arr[pos:pos+n]\n\n    test_cases.append(case)\n\n    pos +=n\n\nThus, the code reads the test cases correctly. Putting it all together:\n\nFor program1's missing code: In the else block:\n\nelse: x_val, y_val = xy[0], xy[1]\n\n    ans.append( prices[x_val-1] - prices[x_val - y_val -1] ) For program2's missing code: In the if mod_a <=2 block:\n\nsolutions.add(a)\n\nFor program3's missing code:\n\nThe code after the TODO is:\n\nt = input_arr[0]\n\npos = 1\n\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    pos +=1\n\n    case = input_arr[pos:pos+n]\n\n    test_cases.append(case)\n\n    pos +=n\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\nprogram1: the else block's code.\n\nprogram2: adding a to solutions when mod_a <=2.\n\nprogram3: the code to read the test cases properly.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about calculating the maximum total value of free items based on queries of x and y. The code provided sorts the prices in reverse and then computes a prefix sum. The idea is probably to select the y cheapest items when you buy at least x items. Wait, but since the prices are sorted in reverse, the first elements are the most expensive. Hmm, maybe the approach is to take the sum of the y smallest in the x items. Wait, the problem says that when a customer buys at least x items, the y cheapest of them are free. To maximize the total free, the customer would buy exactly x items (since buying more than x would allow taking more y, but y is fixed per query). Wait no, the query's x and y are parameters. For each query, the customer can choose to buy any number of items >=x, but to maximize the free sum, they would buy exactly x items, because taking more would require choosing y from a larger set, but maybe the y cheapest in x items is better. Wait, actually, if you buy more than x items, say x+k, then you can choose the y cheapest among all x+k items, which would be better. Wait, but the problem says \"if a customer makes one purchase\" \u2014 so the customer can choose any number of items >=x, but to maximize the free sum, they would choose exactly x items? Or maybe more? Let me think again. The free is the sum of the y cheapest items among the purchased items. To maximize this sum, the customer would want to select the x items where the y cheapest among them are as large as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the y cheapest items would be the smallest in the purchased items. To maximize their sum, you want those y items to be as large as possible. So the optimal strategy is to choose the x most expensive items, then among those, take the y cheapest (which are the y smallest in the x items). Because if you take more than x items, the y cheapest would be even smaller. So the best is to pick exactly x items, the most expensive ones. Then, among those x items, the y cheapest (i.e., the last y in the sorted list) would give the maximum possible sum. \n\nSo the approach is: sort the prices in non-decreasing order? Wait, the code in program1.py sorts in reverse (descending order). Let me see the code again. The code sorts prices in reverse (so highest first), then computes a prefix sum. Wait, the code's first line after sorting is:\n\nprices.sort(reverse=True)\nfor i in range(1, arr[0]):\n    prices[i] = prices[i] + prices[i-1]\n\nSo this is building a prefix sum array where prices[i] is the sum of the first i elements (since it's cumulative). Wait, no, the loop starts from i=1 to n-1 (since arr[0] is n). So after the loop, prices[i] is the sum of the first i elements in the sorted list. Because for each i, it adds the current to the previous sum. So the prefix sum array is correct. \n\nNow, for a query x and y, the idea is that the customer buys x items. The y cheapest among them are the last y in the sorted list (since the first x items are the most expensive). The sum of those y would be the sum of the (x - y +1)th to xth elements? Wait, let's see. The sorted list in reverse (so highest first). The first x items are the x most expensive. The y cheapest among them are the last y elements in those x. So the sum would be the sum of the x elements minus the sum of the first (x - y) elements. Because the first (x - y) elements are the most expensive, so subtracting them from the total sum of x elements leaves the sum of the last y elements. \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose the first x elements are [a1, a2, ..., ax], sorted in descending order. The y cheapest are the last y elements: a_{x - y +1} ... ax. The sum of those is (sum of first x elements) minus (sum of first x - y elements). \n\nSo for a query x and y, the answer is sum(x) - sum(x - y). \n\nWait, but in the code, the current code handles the case when x == y by returning sum(x-1) (since prices[x-1] is the sum of first x elements). Wait, no. Wait, the code's first part is:\n\nif (xy[0] == xy[1]):\n    ans.append(prices[xy[0]-1])\n\nWhich is correct because when x = y, all x items are free. The sum is the sum of the first x elements (since prices[x-1] is the prefix sum up to x). \n\nBut when x != y, the code has a TODO. So the correct approach is to compute sum(x) - sum(x - y). \n\nWait, the sum of the first x elements is prices[x-1], and the sum of the first (x - y) elements is prices[x - y -1]. So the difference is prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1]. \n\nWait, let's see. For example, if x is 3 and y is 2, then the sum of the first 3 elements is prices[2], and the first (3-2)=1 elements is prices[0]. The difference is prices[2] - prices[0], which would be (a1 + a2 + a3) - a1 = a2 + a3, which are the two cheapest of the three. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the code for the else part should be:\n\nsum_x = prices[x-1]\nsum_x_minus_y = prices[x - y - 1] if (x - y) > 0 else 0\nans.append(sum_x - sum_x_minus_y)\n\nWait, but when x - y is zero? Like when y equals x, but that's already handled in the if clause. So in the else case, since x > y, x - y is at least 1. Wait, because the problem says 1 \u2264 y_i \u2264 x_i \u2264 n. So when x and y are not equal, y can be less than x, so x - y is at least 1. So the code can safely do:\n\nsum_x_minus_y = prices[x - y - 1]\n\nThus, the code for the else part would be:\n\nelse:\n    x_val = xy[0]\n    y_val = xy[1]\n    total = prices[x_val -1] - (prices[x_val - y_val -1] if (x_val - y_val) >=1 else 0)\n    ans.append(total)\n\nWait, but when x_val - y_val is 0, that would be when y equals x, but that's already handled in the if. So in the else case, x_val - y_val is at least 1. So the code can be written as:\n\nelse:\n    x_val, y_val = xy[0], xy[1]\n    ans.append( prices[x_val -1] - prices[ (x_val - y_val) -1 ] )\n\nWait, (x_val - y_val) -1 is x_val - y_val -1. So the code would be:\n\nans.append( prices[x_val -1] - prices[x_val - y_val -1] )\n\nSo in the code, the TODO part should be replaced with that. \n\nSo the missing code in program1 is:\n\nxy[0] and xy[1] are x and y. So:\n\nx, y = xy\nans.append( prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1] )\n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are called xy[0] and xy[1]. So:\n\nx_val = xy[0], y_val = xy[1]\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nans.append( prices[x_val -1] - prices[ (x_val - y_val) -1 ] )\n\nWait, (x_val - y_val) is the number of elements to subtract. So the index is (x_val - y_val -1). \n\nSo the code for the else block is:\n\nelse:\n    x, y = xy[0], xy[1]\n    ans.append( prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1] )\n\nWait, but what if x - y is zero? But in the else clause, since x != y, and y <=x, so x - y is at least 1. So the index is valid. \n\nSo that's the code for program1's missing part. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is about tiling a bathroom. The interior uses 1x1 tiles, and the boundary uses 1xa tiles. The boundary area is the perimeter minus the corners? Wait, the problem says that the interior is (w-2)*(l-2). The boundary is the remaining area. The total area is w*l. So the boundary area is w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2w + 2l -4. \n\nThe boundary must be tiled with 1xa tiles. Each such tile covers a area of a. So the total boundary area must be divisible by a. Also, the tiles can be rotated, so the tile can be a x1. So the length of the boundary's edges must be multiples of a. Wait, perhaps the tiles must fit along the edges. \n\nWait, the boundary is the perimeter minus the inner part. The boundary is the outer edge. The tiles must cover the boundary area. The tiles are 1xa, so they can be placed either horizontally or vertically. The key is that the total boundary area must be divisible by a. Because each tile has area a. So the area of the boundary is (2*(w + l) -4) must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, the boundary area is 2*(w + l) -4. Because:\n\nTotal area: w*l\n\nInterior area: (w-2)*(l-2) = wl -2w -2l +4\n\nSubtracting gives boundary area: 2w + 2l -4. \n\nSo the a must divide this value. So a must be a divisor of (2(w + l) -4). \n\nBut also, the tiles must fit along the edges. For example, the tiles along the top and bottom edges (length l) must have their length (either a or 1) fit into the length. Wait, perhaps the tiles must be arranged such that their length divides the length of the edges. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles can be placed along the edges such that their length (a) divides the length of the edge. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must fit along the edges. Let me think again. The boundary is the perimeter. The four sides. The top and bottom have length l, but the first and last rows. The left and right have length w, but the first and last columns. \n\nThe tiles must cover the boundary area. The tiles can be placed in any orientation. So the total area must be divisible by a. So a must divide the boundary area (2(w + l) -4). \n\nBut also, the tiles must fit along the edges. For example, the tiles along the top edge (length l) must have their length (either a or 1) such that the total length is covered. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles can be arranged in any way as long as their total area is correct, but the problem requires that the tiles can be placed without cutting. So the a must divide the length of each edge's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles can be arranged in any way as long as the total area is divisible by a. Because the problem allows any arrangement. \n\nWait the problem says \"the tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees\". So the tiles can be placed in any orientation. So the only condition is that the boundary area is divisible by a. \n\nWait, but the problem's note says in the first test case (3,5), the possible a's are 1,2,3. Let's see:\n\nThe boundary area is 2*(3+5) -4 = 2*8-4 = 12. So 12 must be divisible by a. The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. But the sample answer includes 1,2,3. So why not 4,6,12?\n\nHmm, that suggests that there's another condition. \n\nWait the sample input first case is 3 and 5. The possible a's are 1,2,3. Let's see:\n\nThe boundary area is 12. 12 mod a must be 0. So 12 must be divisible by a. So 4,6,12 are also divisors. But the sample answer doesn't include them. So there must be another condition. \n\nAh, perhaps the tiles must fit along the edges. For example, the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) divides the length of the edges. \n\nWait, the edges are of lengths w and l. Let me think of the four sides:\n\nThe top and bottom edges (length l) are part of the boundary. The left and right edges (length w) are also part of the boundary. \n\nWait, the boundary is the perimeter minus the inner part. The tiles must cover the perimeter's area. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles must be arranged along the edges such that their dimensions fit. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed along the edges such that their length (a) divides the length of the edges. \n\nWait, for example, in the first test case, the top and bottom edges are length 5. The left and right edges are length 3. \n\nSuppose a is 4. Then, the tiles of length 4 can't fit into the 3-length edges. \n\nWait, the tiles can be rotated. So a tile of size 1x4 can be placed as 4x1. So for the vertical edges (length 3), the tile's length (4) must be <= the edge's length? No, that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) divides the length of the edge. \n\nWait, for the vertical edges (left and right), their length is w. The tiles placed along them must have their length (a) such that a divides w. Or perhaps the tiles can be arranged in such a way that the total length along the edge is covered. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles must be arranged such that their length (a) divides the length of the edge. \n\nWait, let's think of the first test case. For a=3:\n\nThe boundary area is 12. 12 mod 3 is 0. \n\nNow, the vertical edges (left and right) are of length 3. So if a is 3, then the tiles can be placed vertically (1x3) along the vertical edges. \n\nThe horizontal edges (top and bottom) are length 5. 5 mod 3 is 2, so that's a problem. Wait, but the tiles can be arranged in other ways. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tiles can be arranged in such a way that the total length along each edge is covered. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles can be placed in any orientation, but the total area must be divisible by a. The sample's first case includes a=3, which divides 12. So why are 4,6,12 excluded?\n\nWait the sample's first case's answer includes a=3. Let's see:\n\nIf a=4, the area is 12 divisible by 4 (3 times). But how to arrange the tiles. \n\nThe vertical edges (length 3) can't be covered by tiles of length 4. Unless they are placed horizontally. \n\nWait, the tiles can be rotated. So a tile of 1x4 can be placed as 4x1. \n\nThe vertical edges (left and right) are 3 units long. So if the tiles are placed vertically (along the vertical edges), their length (a) must be <=3. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must fit along the edges. For example, the tiles along the vertical edges (left and right) must have their length (a) such that a divides the edge's length (w). \n\nWait, the vertical edges (left and right) have length w. The tiles placed along them must have their length (a) such that a divides w. \n\nSimilarly, the horizontal edges (top and bottom) have length l, so a must divide l. \n\nWait, but that would require a to divide both w and l. But in the first test case, w=3 and l=5. The GCD of 3 and 5 is 1. So the only a that divides both is 1. But the sample includes a=2 and 3. \n\nHmm, that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tiles can be arranged in such a way that along each edge, the tiles' length (either a or 1) must fit into the edge's length. \n\nWait, the tiles can be placed in any orientation. So for a given edge of length L, the tiles along that edge must have their length (either a or 1) such that the total length is L. \n\nWait, but the tiles can be placed in any way. For example, along a length L edge, you can have some tiles placed horizontally (length a) and others vertically (length 1). But that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) divides the length of each edge. \n\nWait, the problem says that the tiles can be rotated, so the tile can be placed as 1xa or ax1. So the length of the tile can be either a or 1. \n\nTherefore, for each edge, the length must be divisible by either a or 1. Since 1 divides any length, the only constraint is that the edge's length must be divisible by a or 1. Since 1 is always possible, the only constraint is that the total area must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, but that would mean that any a that divides the boundary area is acceptable. But in the first test case, the boundary area is 12. The divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. But the sample answer includes 1,2,3. So why not 4,6,12?\n\nHmm, so there must be another condition. \n\nLooking at the note's first example: the possible a's are 1,2,3. Let's see for a=4:\n\nThe boundary area is 12, so 12/4=3 tiles. But how to arrange them. \n\nThe edges are:\n\nTop and bottom (length 5 each). Left and right (length 3 each). \n\nThe total boundary area is 2*(3+5) -4 = 12. \n\nSuppose a=4. The tiles can be arranged as follows: \n\nAlong the top edge (length 5), perhaps place a tile of length 4 (since a=4) and another of length 1 (since 4+1=5). But the tile of length 1 is allowed (since a can be rotated to 1x4, so the 1 is the other dimension). Wait, but the tile's area is a, so each tile must have area 4. So each tile is either 1x4 or 4x1. \n\nSo for the top edge (length 5), the tiles along it must be arranged such that their total length (along the edge) is 5. \n\nSuppose the edge is horizontal. The tiles can be placed vertically (so their length is 1 in the horizontal direction, and 4 in the vertical). But that would not cover the horizontal length. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles are placed horizontally. Each tile's horizontal length is 4 (since a=4). So along the 5-length edge, you can place one tile of 4, and then a 1-length part. But that 1-length part can't be covered by a tile of area 4. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the tiles must be arranged such that their length (either a or 1) divides the edge's length. \n\nWait, the edge's length must be divisible by either a or 1. Since 1 divides everything, the only constraint is that the edge's length must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, but for a=4, the vertical edges (length 3) are not divisible by 4. So the tiles can't be placed along those edges. \n\nWait, the vertical edges (left and right) have length 3. To cover them with tiles of a=4, the tiles must be placed vertically (so their length is 4, but the edge is only 3 units long. So that's impossible. \n\nAh! So the tiles must be placed such that their length (either a or 1) divides the edge's length. \n\nWait, the tiles can be placed in any orientation, but their length (the longer side?) must fit into the edge. \n\nAlternatively, for each edge, the length of the edge must be divisible by either a or 1. Since 1 is always possible, but the tiles must have their length (a) such that the edge's length is a multiple of a. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their length (the dimension along the edge) divides the edge's length. \n\nFor example, along a vertical edge of length w, the tiles placed along it must have their length (either a or 1) such that the edge's length is divisible by that length. \n\nWait, but since the tiles can be rotated, the length along the edge can be either a or 1. So the edge's length must be divisible by a or by 1. Since 1 divides everything, the only constraint is that the edge's length must be divisible by a or 1. But since 1 is always possible, the only constraint is that the edge's length must be divisible by a or 1. \n\nWait, but that would allow any a that divides the boundary area. But the sample shows that a=4 is not allowed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their length (the dimension along the edge) is exactly a. Because otherwise, if you use 1, then the other dimension (a) would have to be in the perpendicular direction, but that might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that all tiles must be placed in the same orientation. But the problem says they can be rotated. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) divides the length of each edge. \n\nWait, let's think of the first test case with a=3. \n\nThe vertical edges (length 3) can be divided by 3 (3/3=1). The horizontal edges (length 5) can't be divided by 3, but since the tiles can be placed with length 1 (rotated), then the horizontal edges can be covered with tiles of length 1 (along the edge). \n\nWait, the horizontal edges (length 5) can be covered with tiles placed vertically (so their length along the edge is 1, and the other dimension is 3). So each tile along the horizontal edge would have length 1 along the edge (so 5 tiles of length 1, each with height 3). But the total area per tile is 3, so 5 tiles would give 15, but the horizontal edge's area is 5 (since the top and bottom are each 5 units long, but the width is 1 (since the interior is subtracted). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) divides the length of the edge. \n\nWait, the problem's note says that for a=3 in the first case, it's possible. Let's see:\n\nThe vertical edges (length 3) can be covered with tiles of length 3 (so 1 tile per edge). The horizontal edges (length 5) can be covered with tiles of length 1 (since 5 mod 1 is 0). \n\nThus, the tiles can be arranged in such a way that along the vertical edges, the tiles are placed vertically (length 3), and along the horizontal edges, placed horizontally (length 1). \n\nThus, the condition is that a must divide either the width or the length. \n\nWait, but the edges are of two types: those of length w and those of length l. \n\nThe vertical edges (left and right) have length w. The horizontal edges (top and bottom) have length l. \n\nThe tiles must be placed along these edges such that their length (either a or 1) divides the edge's length. \n\nThus, for each edge, the length must be divisible by either a or 1. Since 1 is always possible, the only constraint is that the edge's length must be divisible by a or 1. \n\nWait, but the tiles can be placed in any orientation. So for each edge, the length of the edge must be divisible by either a or 1. Since 1 is always possible, the only constraint is that the edge's length must be divisible by a or 1. \n\nWait, but that would allow any a that divides the boundary area. But the sample shows that a=4 is not allowed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) divides the length of the edge. \n\nWait, the problem says the tiles are of size 1xa. So the length can be a or 1. \n\nThus, for each edge, the length must be divisible by either a or 1. Since 1 divides everything, the only constraint is that the edge's length must be divisible by a or 1. \n\nWait, but that would allow any a that divides the boundary area. But the sample shows that a=4 is not allowed. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: \n\nThe interior uses 1x1 tiles. The boundary uses tiles of size 1xa (can be rotated). \n\nThe total area of the boundary must be divisible by a. \n\nAdditionally, the tiles must fit along the edges. \n\nWait, the boundary is the perimeter's area. The tiles must cover that area. \n\nThe tiles can be placed in any orientation, but their dimensions must fit along the edges. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) is along the edge's direction. \n\nFor example, along a vertical edge (length w), the tiles must be placed vertically, so their length (a) must divide w. \n\nAlong a horizontal edge (length l), the tiles must be placed horizontally, so their length (a) must divide l. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles can be placed in any orientation, but their length (a) must divide the edge's length. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) divides the length of the edge. \n\nThus, for each edge, the length must be divisible by a. \n\nWait, but then in the first test case, a=2:\n\nThe vertical edges (3) must be divisible by 2? 3 mod 2 is 1. So that's not possible. \n\nWait but the sample includes a=2 as a valid option. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait the first test case's sample includes a=2. Let's see:\n\nIf a=2, then the vertical edges (3) must be divisible by 2? 3 mod 2 is 1. So that's not possible. \n\nBut the sample says a=2 is allowed. \n\nHmm, so my previous assumption is wrong. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the first test case with a=2. \n\nThe boundary area is 12. 12 mod 2 is 0. \n\nThe vertical edges (length 3) can be covered with tiles of length 2 (but 3 mod 2 is 1). \n\nWait, but maybe the tiles are placed in a way that combines both orientations. \n\nFor example, along the vertical edge of length 3, you can place one tile of length 2 (vertically) and then a tile of length 1 (rotated to be 1x2, placed horizontally). \n\nWait, but the tiles must be placed along the edge. \n\nAlternatively, the tiles can be arranged in such a way that their combined lengths along the edge add up to the edge's length. \n\nFor example, along a vertical edge of length 3, you can have a tile of length 2 (vertical) and another of length 1 (vertical). The total is 3. \n\nThe tiles can be placed in any orientation as long as their length along the edge direction adds up to the edge's length. \n\nThus, the only requirement is that the edge's length can be expressed as a sum of multiples of a and 1. \n\nBut since a and 1 can be combined, any edge length can be covered as long as a divides the edge length or not? \n\nWait, but since 1 is allowed, any edge length can be covered. \n\nThus, the only constraint is that the boundary area must be divisible by a. \n\nBut then why in the first test case, a=4 is not allowed? \n\nWait the boundary area is 12. 12 mod 4 is 0. So a=4 should be allowed. But the sample's first case includes a=3 but not 4. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait the sample's first case's answer includes a=3. Let's see:\n\nThe boundary area is 12. 12 mod 3 is 0. \n\nBut the vertical edges are length 3. So for a=3, the vertical edges can be covered with tiles of length 3 (so one tile per edge). The horizontal edges (length 5) can be covered with tiles of length 1 (since 5 mod 1 is 0). \n\nThus, it works. \n\nFor a=4, the boundary area is divisible by 4 (12/4=3). \n\nThe vertical edges (3) can be covered with tiles of length 1 (since 3 mod 1 is 0). \n\nThe horizontal edges (5) can be covered with tiles of length 1 (5 mod 1=0). \n\nThus, the tiles can be placed with length 1 along all edges, so a=4 is allowed. But the sample's first case does not include it. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my understanding is wrong. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the first test case, the valid a's are 1,2,3. \n\nWait, perhaps the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) is at least 1, but the problem allows a=1. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the tiles must be placed in such a way that their length (a) is exactly the length of the edge. \n\nNo, that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) divides the length of the edge. \n\nWait, for a=2 in the first case:\n\nThe vertical edges (3) must be divisible by 2? 3 mod 2 is 1. So that's not possible. \n\nBut the sample includes a=2 as valid. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nPerhaps I should look at the code provided for program2.py. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l - 2 \n\nWait, the boundary area is 2*(w + l) -4. So half_perimeter is (w + l -2). \n\nThe code initializes solutions as {1,2}. \n\nThen loops over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nWait, the code is trying to find all divisors of the half_perimeter (since the boundary area is 2*(w + l -2)), so the area is 2*(half_perimeter). Wait no, the boundary area is 2*(w + l) -4 = 2*(w + l -2). So the boundary area is 2*(half_perimeter). \n\nWait, the code's half_perimeter is w + l -2. So the boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter. \n\nThus, the a must divide 2 * half_perimeter. \n\nThe code is trying to find all divisors of the half_perimeter multiplied by 2? \n\nWait, the code's current approach is to iterate over possible divisors of the half_perimeter. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find all divisors of the boundary area (2*(half_perimeter)), but the code is using half_perimeter. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect. \n\nThe problem requires that a divides the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)). \n\nThus, the valid a's are the divisors of this value. \n\nBut the sample's first case has 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. The divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. But the sample's answer includes 1,2,3. \n\nSo why are 4,6,12 excluded? \n\nAh! Because the tiles must be placed along the edges, and the tiles' length (a) must be at least 1, but also, the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) is at least 1. \n\nWait, the problem says \"for some positive integer a\". So a can be any positive integer. \n\nBut the sample's first case excludes 4,6,12. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's an additional constraint that the tiles must be placed such that their length (a) is at most the edge's length. \n\nWait, for a=12, the boundary area is 12. So one tile of 12x1. But the edges are of length 3 and 5. \n\nThe tiles can be placed along the edges, but the length of the tile (12) must be <= the edge's length. \n\nWait, but the edges are only 3 or 5 units long. So a tile of length 12 can't be placed along them. \n\nAh! So the tiles must have their length (a) not exceeding the edge's length. \n\nThus, the a must be a divisor of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and also a must be <= the minimum of (w, l). \n\nWait, but in the first test case, a=4 is a divisor of 12, but 4 is larger than the vertical edge's length (3). So a=4 can't be used. \n\nAh! That's probably the missing condition. \n\nThus, the valid a's are the divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and also a must be <= the minimum of (w, l). \n\nWait, but in the first test case, the minimum of w and l is 3. So a must be <=3. \n\nThus, the valid a's are the divisors of 12 that are <=3. Those are 1,2,3. Which matches the sample. \n\nSimilarly, a=4 is a divisor but exceeds 3, so it's excluded. \n\nAh! So the conditions are:\n\na must divide the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and a must be <= min(w, l). \n\nWait, but what about the other edges? For example, in the first case, the horizontal edges are length 5. So a=4 is allowed for those edges (since 5 >=4?), but the vertical edges are 3. \n\nThus, the a must be <= the minimum of the edge lengths. \n\nWait, the edges have lengths w and l. So the minimum between w and l. \n\nThus, the a must be a divisor of the boundary area and also a <= min(w, l). \n\nSo the code must find all divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and then filter those divisors to be <= min(w, l). \n\nWait, but the code in program2.py is currently using half_perimeter (w + l -2) as the value to find divisors. \n\nWait, the boundary area is 2*(half_perimeter). So the code should be finding divisors of 2*(half_perimeter). \n\nThe current code is looping over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nHmm, so the code is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the boundary area as 2*(w + l -2), then find all its divisors, then filter those divisors to be <= min(w, l). \n\nBut the code in program2.py is using half_perimeter (w + l -2) and finding its divisors. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nThe problem requires that a must divide the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and a must be <= min(w, l). \n\nThus, the code should first compute the boundary area as 2*(w + l -2). \n\nThen find all its divisors. \n\nThen filter those divisors to be <= min(w, l). \n\nThe code in program2.py is currently using half_perimeter (w + l -2) as the value to find divisors, which is wrong. \n\nSo the code's first step is wrong. \n\nThe code's current line:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2 \n\nBut the boundary area is 2 * half_perimeter. \n\nThus, the code should compute the boundary area as 2*(w + l -2), then find its divisors. \n\nThe code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nSo the code's first line should be:\n\nboundary_area = 2 * (w + l - 2)\n\nThen, find all divisors of boundary_area. \n\nThen, collect all divisors a where a <= min(w, l). \n\nThe code's current approach is using half_perimeter (w + l -2) as the value to find divisors, which is wrong. \n\nSo the code's first line should be:\n\nboundary_area = 2 * (w + l -2)\n\nThen, the code should find all divisors of boundary_area. \n\nThe current code's loop is iterating over divisors of half_perimeter. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nNow, looking at the code provided for program2.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l - 2\n\nsolutions = {1,2}\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0: continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, this is very confusing. \n\nThe code is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2), but the boundary area is twice that. \n\nThe code's current approach is not correct. \n\nThe correct approach is to find all divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), then filter those divisors to be <= min(w, l). \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nboundary_area = 2*(w + l -2)\n\ndivisors = set()\n\nfor i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(boundary_area)) +1):\n\n    if boundary_area %i ==0:\n\n        divisors.add(i)\n\n        divisors.add(boundary_area//i)\n\nThen, filter the divisors to be <= min(w,l). \n\nThe code's current approach is not doing this. \n\nThe code's current code is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2), but that's not the correct value. \n\nSo the code's missing part is probably to compute the correct boundary area and find its divisors. \n\nBut given the code's current structure, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), but the code is using half_perimeter (w + l -2) instead. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct but the logic is different. \n\nWait, the code's current code has:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0: continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of the boundary area (2*(half_perimeter)), but the code is using half_perimeter. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of the boundary area, but the code is using half_perimeter multiplied by 2. \n\nWait, the code's current approach is to iterate over divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2), and then for each divisor i, the corresponding a is i or div (which is (half_perimeter)/i). \n\nBut the boundary area is 2*half_perimeter, so the divisors of the boundary area are the divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\nThus, the code is not considering the factor of 2. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute all divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), then filter those divisors to be <= min(w,l). \n\nThe code's current approach is not doing this. \n\nThe code's current code is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2), but that's not the correct value. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is to compute the correct boundary area and find its divisors. \n\nBut given the code's current structure, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), but the code is using half_perimeter (w + l -2) and then multiplying by 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct but the logic is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find divisors of the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), but the code is using half_perimeter multiplied by 2. \n\nWait, the code's current code has:\n\nhalf_perimeter = w + l -2 \n\nThen, for each divisor i of half_perimeter, the code considers a = i or a = (half_perimeter)/i. \n\nBut the boundary area is 2*half_perimeter, so the divisors of the boundary area are the divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\nThus, the code is missing the factor of 2. \n\nSo the code should be considering divisors of 2*half_perimeter. \n\nThus, the code's first line should be:\n\nboundary_area = 2*(w + l -2)\n\nThen, find all divisors of boundary_area. \n\nThe current code is using half_perimeter instead of boundary_area. \n\nThus, the code's first line should be changed, but since the user wants only the missing code, perhaps the code's current approach is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct but the logic is different. \n\nThe code's current code has:\n\nsolutions = {1,2}\n\nThen, for each divisor i of half_perimeter (w + l -2), it checks if w mod a is <=2. \n\nWait, the code's current code has:\n\nmod_a = w % a \n\nif mod_a <=2:\n\n    # add to solutions?\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThe code's current approach is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to find a such that a divides the boundary area (2*(w + l -2)), and also a divides (w) or (l) or something else. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find a such that a divides the boundary area and also a divides (w) or (l). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look at the code's current structure and see what the missing part is. \n\nThe code has:\n\nfor i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) +1):\n\n    div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n\n    if mod_i !=0: continue\n\n    for a in [i, div]:\n\n        mod_a = w % a \n\n        if mod_a <=2:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code is trying to find divisors of half_perimeter (w + l -2). \n\nThe current code's solutions are initialized with 1 and 2. \n\nThe loop is for each divisor i of half_perimeter. \n\nThen, for a in [i, div], which are the divisors. \n\nThen, mod_a = w % a \n\nif mod_a <=2: \n\n    # add to solutions?\n\nPerhaps the condition is that the remainder when w is divided by a must be <=2. \n\nBut why? \n\nThe problem requires that the tiles can be placed along the edges. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to ensure that the tiles can fit along the edges. \n\nFor example, the vertical edges have length w. The tiles placed along them must have their length (a) such that w mod a is 0. \n\nBut the code's condition is mod_a <=2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to allow some flexibility. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to ensure that the remainder is small enough to be covered by the interior. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach for the missing code in program2 is to add a to the solutions if mod_a <=2. \n\nThe code's current line is:\n\nif mod_a <=2:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nPerhaps the code should add a to the solutions set. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nsolutions.add(a)\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nif mod_a <=2:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\nBut also, perhaps the same check for l? \n\nWait, the code is only checking w mod a. \n\nPerhaps the code should also check l mod a. \n\nAlternatively, the code is only checking one of them. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to ensure that the remainder when divided by a is small enough to be covered by the interior. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the sample's first case, when a=2:\n\nw=3, mod_a = 3%2 =1 <=2 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, a=2 is added. \n\nFor a=3:\n\n3%3=0 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, added. \n\nFor a=1:\n\n1 is already in the initial set. \n\nThus, the code's approach would include a=1,2,3. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nFor a=4:\n\nw=3 mod4 is 3 \u2192 which is >2 \u2192 so not added. \n\nThus, the code's condition is correct. \n\nThus, the missing code is to add a to the solutions set when mod_a <=2. \n\nSo the code should have:\n\nif mod_a <=2:\n\n    solutions.add(a)\n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is:\n\nsolutions.add(a)\n\nSo the code's TODO is replaced with that. \n\nNow, program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to determine if it's possible to make all elements after the first zero by performing operations where you subtract a_i-1 from a_i any number of times. \n\nThe code provided has a function diff_ops which checks if all elements are divisible by a[0]. \n\nThe sample's first case is [5,10]. \n\nThe function checks if 10 mod5 ==0 \u2192 yes. So returns True \u2192 \"YES\". \n\nThe second sample case is [1,2,3]. \n\nThe function checks 2 mod1 ==0 (yes), 3 mod1 ==0 (yes). So returns True \u2192 \"YES\". \n\nThe third test case is [3,6,9,12]. \n\nThe function checks 6 mod3=0, 9 mod3=0, 12 mod3=0 \u2192 returns True \u2192 \"YES\". \n\nBut what about a case like [2,3]. \n\nThe function would return 3 mod2=1 \u2192 not divisible \u2192 returns False \u2192 \"NO\". \n\nBut what is the correct answer? \n\nThe allowed operations are to subtract a_i-1 from a_i. \n\nFor [2,3], the initial a is [2,3]. \n\nWe can do a_i=2: subtract 2 from 3 \u2192 becomes 1. \n\nThen again subtract 2 \u2192 becomes -1. But the problem allows any number of operations, but the array elements must be non-negative? \n\nWait the problem says the array consists of positive integers. But after operations, can they be zero? \n\nThe problem says to make a_i=0 for all 2<=i<=n. \n\nSo the final array must have a_2=0, a_3=0, etc. \n\nIn the case of [2,3], the first operation would subtract 2 from 3 \u2192 [2,1]. \n\nThen subtract again \u2192 [2,-1], but that's invalid. \n\nWait, the problem says you can perform the operation any number of times, but the array elements must remain non-negative? \n\nThe problem's input specifies that the array consists of positive integers. But during operations, can a_i become negative? \n\nThe problem's note's first example ends with [5,0], which is allowed. \n\nSo the operations can be done until a_i becomes zero. \n\nThus, for [2,3], the first operation gives [2,1], then another gives [2,-1], which is invalid. \n\nThus, the correct answer is \"NO\". \n\nThe function returns False, which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: [5, 10]. \n\nThe function returns True, which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: [4,6]. \n\nThe function returns 6 mod4=2 \u2192 no. \n\nBut can we do it? \n\nThe allowed operations: subtract 4 from 6 \u2192 2. Then subtract again \u2192 -2 \u2192 no. \n\nThus, the answer is \"NO\". \n\nThus, the function's logic is correct. \n\nThe code's problem is in the part where it reads the test cases. \n\nThe code has:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef diff_ops(arr):\n\n    result = True\n\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n\n        result = result and (arr[i] % arr[0] ==0)\n\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\n    len_input = len(input_arr)\n\n    n = input_arr[0]\n\n    test_cases = []\n\n    pos =1\n\n    while pos <= len_input -1:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n\n        print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n\nThe code's problem is in reading the test cases. \n\nThe first element of input_arr is t (number of test cases). \n\nThen, for each test case, the first line is n, followed by n numbers. \n\nThe current code reads the first element as n (the first test case's n?), which is wrong. \n\nThe code's current code has:\n\nn = input_arr[0]\n\ntest_cases = []\n\npos =1\n\nwhile pos <= len_input -1:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct way to read the input is:\n\nThe first element is t. \n\nThen, for each test case:\n\n- read n, then read n numbers. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\npos = 0 \n\nt = input_arr[pos]\n\npos +=1 \n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    pos +=1 \n\n    a = input_arr[pos: pos +n]\n\n    pos +=n \n\n    test_cases.append(a)\n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO is to read the test cases properly. \n\nThe current code's pos starts at 1, but the first element is t. \n\nThe code's current code has:\n\ninput_arr[0] is t. \n\nThe code's first line after reading input is:\n\nn = input_arr[0]\n\nWhich is wrong. \n\nThe correct code should read t first. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\nt = input_arr[0]\n\npos =1 \n\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    pos +=1 \n\n    arr = input_arr[pos: pos +n]\n\n    test_cases.append(arr)\n\n    pos +=n \n\nThus, the code's TODO section should be replaced with this. \n\nSo the missing code for program3 is:\n\nt = input_arr[0]\n\npos = 1\n\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    pos +=1\n\n    case = input_arr[pos:pos+n]\n\n    test_cases.append(case)\n\n    pos +=n\n\nThus, the code reads the test cases correctly. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFor program1's missing code:\n\nIn the else block:\n\nelse:\n\n    x_val, y_val = xy[0], xy[1]\n\n    ans.append( prices[x_val-1] - prices[x_val - y_val -1] )\n\nFor program2's missing code:\n\nIn the if mod_a <=2 block:\n\nsolutions.add(a)\n\nFor program3's missing code:\n\nThe code after the TODO is:\n\nt = input_arr[0]\n\npos = 1\n\ntest_cases = []\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    pos +=1\n\n    case = input_arr[pos:pos+n]\n\n    test_cases.append(case)\n\n    pos +=n\n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\nprogram1: the else block's code.\n\nprogram2: adding a to solutions when mod_a <=2.\n\nprogram3: the code to read the test cases properly."
