The key is to track the minimum moves after each query. The code provided has some missing parts. Let me look at the code structure. The code uses a list p to track which cells have icons. The variables c and cc are probably counting something. The function query(y, x) toggles the state of a cell. The main issue is in the part where an icon is removed. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\" in the else clause when p[i] was true before.",

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the code provided in program1.py is trying to track the current best k and compute the minimal moves quickly. Looking back at the code:\n\nThe function returns c - cc. The variables c and cc are initialized to 0. When adding an icon, the code does:\n\nif p[i] was False before:\n\n    if i < c: then cc +=1 \n\n    c +=1 \n\n    if p[c-1] is True (now, since we added the icon at i, which is now c-1?), then cc +=1 \n\nWait, perhaps c is the current maximum index where an icon exists. For example, when you add an icon at position i, then c is set to max(c, i+1). Wait, perhaps c is the current maximum index of any icon plus 1. So, the maximum index of any icon is c-1. Then, the current \"good\" arrangement's k is determined by the first k columns being full. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to track the current maximum column where icons are present. Alternatively, the code's variables c and cc are not the right approach, and the problem requires a different approach.",

But with q up to 2e5, this approach would be too slow. So we need an O(1) or O(log m) per query approach. The code provided in program1.py seems to be trying to track some variables to compute this quickly. Looking back at the code:\n\nThe variables c and cc are initialized as 0. The function query(y, x) is called for each initial * and then for each query. The code for adding an icon (p[i] becomes True):\n\nif p[i]:\n    if i < c:\n        cc +=1\n    c +=1\n    if p[c-1]:\n        cc +=1\n\nWait, perhaps c is the current maximum index where an icon is present. So when you add an icon at position i, if i is less than c, then it's within the current maximum, so cc increases. Then c is increased to i+1? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe c is the current number of icons. But that doesn't fit with the code. Alternatively, perhaps c is the current \"current\" position where the icons are supposed to be up to. Alternatively, the code's variables might be tracking the current \"good\" arrangement's required columns. Alternatively, the code's return value is c - cc. Let's see what that would mean.",

The problem is to find the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that their total weights are equal. The approach in the code is to compute the prefix sums and suffix sums. The code uses a dictionary d to store the prefix sums and their indices. The code loops through the array, accumulating the prefix sum s. If s exceeds x (half of the total sum), then it breaks. The dictionary d stores s: index. Then, it loops through the suffix sums, accumulating s, and checks if it's in d. The maximum is the sum of the indices. The missing part is in the line: \n\nif s > x: # TODO:",

Thus, the sum from y=0 to k of C(m+y, m) = C(m +k+1, m+1). Thus, for each x, the sum of C(x+y, x) for y from 0 to a_x-1 is C(x + a_x, x+1). Thus, the total is the sum over x of C(x + a_x, x+1). Thus, the code needs to compute this sum. The code's line is: \n\nd += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],-1,m)*(z>0);x+=1 \n\nWait, z is a_x. The term is f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1]) \n\nWhich is C(z+x-1, x) Wait, because C(z+x-1, x) = (z+x-1)!/(x! (z-1)! )) Which is exactly f[z+x-1]/(f[x] * f[z-1]). But the code has f[z+x] divided by (f[x+1] * f[z-1]). Hmm, perhaps there's an off-by-one error. Wait, the correct term is C(x + a_x, x+1) = (x + a_x)! / ( (x+1)! (a_x-1)! ) Thus, the numerator is f[x + a_x], denominator is f[x+1] * f[a_x -1]. Thus, the code's term is correct. But the code uses z as a_x. Thus, the code's line is correct except for the condition (z>0). Because when a_x is 0, the term is zero (since there are no white cells for that x). Thus, the code's line is correct. The missing part in the first line is the loop for precomputing factorials up to the maximum needed. The first line has: \n\nfor i in range(1,9**6): This is probably to precompute factorials up to (x + a_x) for all x. The maximum possible x is n (up to 2e5), and a_x can be up to 2e5. Thus, the maximum needed factorial is up to 4e5. The loop should run up to (n + max_a). But the code uses 9**6 which is 531441, which is sufficient for n up to 2e5. Thus, the missing code is to precompute the factorials up to the required maximum. The initial code has f = [1], and the loop for i in range(1, 9**6): \n\nProbably, the loop is missing the code to compute f[i] = f[i-1] * i mod m. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\nf.append(f[-1] * i % m)",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about rearranging icons on a desktop so that it's \"good\". The key is to track the minimum moves after each query. The code provided has some missing parts. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nThe code uses a list p to track which cells have icons. The variables c and cc are probably counting something. The function query(y, x) toggles the state of a cell. The main issue is in the part where an icon is removed. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\" in the else clause when p[i] was true before. \n\nWait, the code's logic for c and cc might be tracking the count of icons and the number of \"good\" positions. Let me think. The initial code for query: when you add an icon (p[i] becomes True), if it's before the current c (which might be the current end?), then cc increases. Hmm, maybe c is the current position where the icons are supposed to be up to, and cc is the count of icons in that area. \n\nWait, the function returns c - cc. That suggests that the minimal moves needed are the difference between the current end position (c) and the count of icons in that area (cc). Because the required is that all icons are in the first few columns, so the number of icons not in that area would be total_icons - cc, but maybe the formula is different. \n\nLooking at the code, when you toggle an icon at position i (x,y converted to a 1D index), the code adjusts c and cc. The problem is in the else block when removing an icon. The code subtracts from cc if the icon was in the current c area, but then when c is decremented, there's a missing part. The comment says to fix that part. \n\nWait, when you remove an icon that was part of the current \"good\" area (i < c), then cc decreases by 1. But when you decrement c, if the new c position (c-1) has an icon, then maybe we need to adjust cc again? Or perhaps the code is trying to track the current maximum column where icons are present, and cc is the count of icons in the prefix up to that column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe c is the current number of icons, and cc is the number of icons in the \"good\" region. Not sure. The code's logic is a bit unclear. The missing part is in the else clause when the icon is removed. The code has:\n\nelse:\n    if i < c:\n        cc -= 1\n    c -= 1\n    if p[c]:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nHmm, perhaps when we remove an icon from a position before c, we decrease cc. Then, after decrementing c, if the new c (which is now the previous c-1) has an icon, then we need to add 1 to cc? Because the new c might now include that icon. Wait, maybe the code is trying to track the current \"good\" column's end. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the current number of icons (c) and the number of icons in the \"good\" area (cc). But I'm not sure. The return value is c - cc, which would be the number of icons not in the good area, but that might not be exactly the moves needed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal moves required is the number of icons outside the good area plus the number of empty spots in the good area. Wait, the problem requires that all icons are in a prefix of columns, with possibly some in the next column. The minimal moves would be the number of icons outside the current best prefix plus the number of empty spots in the prefix. \n\nHmm, maybe the code's variables are not correctly tracking this. The missing part in the else block is probably to check if the new c (after decrementing) has an icon, and adjust cc accordingly. For example, when we remove an icon, after decrementing c, if the new c (the previous c-1) has an icon, then we need to add 1 to cc? Or subtract?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic for cc is incorrect. Let me think again. \n\nThe initial code for adding an icon (if p[i] becomes True):\n\nif p[i]:\n    if i < c:\n        cc +=1\n    c +=1\n    if p[c-1]:\n        cc +=1\n\nWait, when adding an icon at position i, which is before the current c (the end?), then cc increases. Then c is increased, and if the new position (c-1) has an icon, then cc increases again. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe c is the current maximum index where icons are present. So when you add an icon at position i, if i is beyond the current c, then c is set to i+1? Not sure. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for the correct approach for the problem. \n\nThe problem requires after each query, to compute the minimal moves to make the desktop good. The desktop is good if all icons are in a prefix of columns, with possibly some in the next column. \n\nThe minimal moves would be the number of icons outside the best possible good arrangement plus the number of empty spots in the good area. \n\nThe best arrangement is determined by choosing a column k such that all icons are in columns 0..k-1 (full columns) and some in column k. The minimal moves would be the total icons minus the maximum possible icons that can fit in the good arrangement (since each icon not in the good area must be moved, and each empty spot in the good area must be filled by an icon from outside). \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves is the total number of icons minus the maximum possible icons that can be in the good arrangement. Because each icon outside the good area must be moved into the good area, and each empty spot in the good area must be filled by an icon from outside. So total moves = (icons_outside) + (empty_in_good) = (total_icons - icons_in_good) + (good_capacity - icons_in_good) ) = total_icons + good_capacity - 2*icons_in_good. \n\nWait, that's an interesting formula. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the good area can hold up to G icons. The current number of icons in the good area is C. Then the number of icons outside is (total_icons - C). The empty spots in the good area are (G - C). The total moves needed would be (total_icons - C) + (G - C) = total_icons + G - 2C. \n\nTo minimize this, we need to choose G (the capacity of the best possible good arrangement) such that G is as large as possible, and C is as large as possible. \n\nThe best G is determined by the current arrangement of icons. The good arrangement is determined by the rightmost column that is fully filled, plus some in the next column. \n\nAlternatively, the good arrangement is determined by the minimal k such that all icons are in columns 0..k, with column k not completely filled. \n\nWait, the problem says that the good desktop has all icons in a prefix of full columns and possibly some in the next column. So the arrangement is such that there exists some k where all columns 0..k-1 are completely filled with icons, and column k has some icons (but not all), and no icons beyond column k. \n\nWait, no. The problem says \"some amount of first columns will be filled with icons and, possibly, some amount of first cells of the next (after the last full column) column will be also filled with icons (and all the icons on the desktop belong to this figure)\". \n\nSo the good arrangement is that all icons are in columns 0..k, where columns 0..k-1 are completely filled, and column k has some icons (possibly none, but then k can be considered as k-1). \n\nWait, perhaps the best way to model this is to find for each possible k (the number of full columns), then the next column can have some icons. \n\nThe maximum possible G for a given k is (k * n) + (number of rows in column k that are filled). \n\nWait, but the problem allows the next column (k) to have some icons, but not necessarily all. So for each possible k (number of full columns), the maximum possible G is (k * n) + the number of icons in column k. \n\nWait, no. The arrangement must have all icons in columns up to k, where columns 0..k-1 are full, and column k has some icons (but not necessarily all). \n\nWait, the arrangement must have all icons in columns 0..k, where columns 0..k-1 are completely filled, and column k has some icons (possibly zero, but then k can be considered as k-1). \n\nWait, perhaps the best way to compute the minimal moves is to find for each possible k (the number of full columns), then the next column (k) can have up to some icons. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal k is the minimal such that all icons are in columns 0..k, with columns 0..k-1 full. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal moves can be computed by finding the best k where the current icons are arranged such that the first k columns are full, and the next column has some. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves can be found by considering all possible k (from 0 to m) and compute the required moves for each, then take the minimum. \n\nBut with q up to 2e5, this approach would be too slow. So we need an O(1) or O(log m) per query approach. \n\nThe code provided in program1.py seems to be trying to track some variables to compute this quickly. \n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nThe variables c and cc are initialized as 0. The function query(y, x) is called for each initial * and then for each query. \n\nThe code for adding an icon (p[i] becomes True):\n\nif p[i]:\n    if i < c:\n        cc +=1\n    c +=1\n    if p[c-1]:\n        cc +=1\n\nWait, perhaps c is the current maximum index where an icon is present. So when you add an icon at position i, if i is less than c, then it's within the current maximum, so cc increases. Then c is increased to i+1? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe c is the current number of icons. But that doesn't fit with the code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps c is the current \"current\" position where the icons are supposed to be up to. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables might be tracking the current \"good\" arrangement's required columns. \n\nAlternatively, the code's return value is c - cc. Let's see what that would mean. \n\nSuppose that c is the total number of icons, and cc is the number of icons in the good area. Then the minimal moves would be (total_icons - cc) + (good_area_size - cc). But that's total_icons + good_area_size - 2*cc. \n\nHmm, but the code returns c - cc. So perhaps the code is assuming that the good area's size is exactly c, so the formula would be (c - cc) is the number of icons outside the good area (since c is the size of the good area?), but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the current best k (number of full columns) and the current column's filled rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a prefix sum approach. \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to track the current \"good\" arrangement's required columns. Let me think of the code's variables:\n\nThe code has a list p which is a flat array of the grid. The grid is stored in row-major order (y varies first, then x). So for a cell (y, x), the index is x*h + y. \n\nThe variables c and cc are probably related to the current \"good\" columns. \n\nThe function query(y, x) toggles the cell (y,x). \n\nThe initial code for adding an icon (when p[i] becomes True):\n\nif p[i] was False before, then:\n\nif i < c: then the new icon is within the current c (maybe the current end?), so cc increases. \n\nThen c is increased by 1. \n\nThen, if the new c-1 (the previous c) has an icon (p[c-1] is now True?), then cc increases again. \n\nWait, perhaps c is the current maximum index where an icon is present. So when you add an icon at position i, if i is less than c, then it's within the current maximum, so cc (count of icons in the good area?) increases. Then c is set to max(c, i+1)? \n\nAlternatively, maybe c is the current number of icons. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the current \"good\" arrangement's required columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the current \"good\" arrangement's required columns by keeping track of the current \"frontier\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nThe missing part in the else clause (when removing an icon) is after decrementing c. The code has:\n\nelse:\n    if i < c:\n        cc -=1\n    c -=1\n    if p[c]:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo after removing an icon, if the icon was in the current c area (i < c), then cc decreases. Then c is decremented. Now, if the new c (the previous c-1) has an icon, then perhaps we need to add 1 to cc? Because the new c is now the new maximum, and that position has an icon. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is that c is the current maximum index where an icon exists. So when you remove an icon at position i, if i was the current c-1, then c needs to be adjusted. \n\nWait, perhaps c is the current maximum index of any icon. So when you remove an icon at position i, if that was the current maximum (i == c-1), then you need to find the new maximum. \n\nBut that would be O(1) per query? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables are not correctly tracking this. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables c and cc are not the right approach, and the problem requires a different approach. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to track for each column, the number of icons in it, and then compute the minimal moves based on that. \n\nThe minimal moves can be computed by finding the best k (number of full columns) such that the first k columns are completely filled, and the (k+1)th column has some icons. \n\nThe total icons in the good arrangement would be (k * n) + the number of icons in column k+1 that are in the first (number of rows) of that column. \n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to precompute the prefix sums of the columns. \n\nLet me think of the problem again. \n\nThe good arrangement requires that all icons are in columns 0..k, where columns 0..k-1 are completely filled (each has n icons), and column k has some icons (possibly 0, but then k can be considered as k-1). \n\nThe minimal moves required is the total number of icons outside this arrangement plus the number of empty spots in the arrangement. \n\nWait, the total moves needed would be (total_icons - (k * n + s)) ) + ( (k * n + s) - (current icons in the arrangement) ), where s is the number of icons in column k. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the best k is chosen such that the first k columns are full, and the (k+1)th column has some icons. \n\nWait, the arrangement must have all icons in columns 0..k, where columns 0..k-1 are full, and column k has some icons (but not necessarily all). \n\nWait, the arrangement can have up to (k * n) + (some in column k). \n\nWait, the arrangement's capacity is (k * n) + (number of rows in column k that are filled). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is (k * n) + the number of icons in column k (since column k can have any number up to n). \n\nWait, the arrangement must have all icons in columns 0..k, with columns 0..k-1 completely filled. \n\nSo the maximum possible icons in the good arrangement is (k * n) + (number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, no. Because column k can have any number of icons (but the arrangement requires that all icons are in columns 0..k, with columns 0..k-1 full). \n\nSo the total icons in the good arrangement is (k * n) + (icons_in_column_k). \n\nThe minimal moves required would be the total_icons minus the maximum possible icons in the good arrangement (since those icons not in the arrangement must be moved out of their current positions, and the empty spots in the arrangement must be filled by those icons). \n\nWait, no. The moves required are the number of icons outside the good arrangement (they need to be moved into the arrangement) plus the number of empty spots in the arrangement (they need to be filled by moving icons from outside). \n\nSo total moves = (total_icons - (k*n + s)) ) + ( (k*n + s) - (current icons in the good arrangement) ) \n\nWait, that's (total_icons - (k*n + s)) + (k*n + s - (current icons in the good arrangement)) \n\nBut that simplifies to total_icons - (current icons in the good arrangement). \n\nWait, that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, the moves needed are the number of icons outside the good arrangement (must be moved into the good area) plus the number of empty spots in the good area (must be filled by moving icons from outside). \n\nSo total moves = (icons_outside) + (empty_in_good) \n\n= (total_icons - icons_in_good) + ( (k*n + s) - icons_in_good ) \n\n= total_icons + (k*n + s) - 2 * icons_in_good \n\nTo minimize this, we need to choose k and s (the number of icons in column k) such that the arrangement is valid (columns 0..k-1 are full, and column k has s icons). \n\nThe minimal moves would be the minimum over all possible valid k of (total_icons + (k*n + s) - 2 * icons_in_good). \n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves can be computed by finding the best k where the first k columns are full, and the next column has some icons. \n\nThe best k is the one where the first k columns are completely filled, and the (k+1)th column has some icons. \n\nWait, perhaps the best k is the maximum possible such that the first k columns are completely filled. \n\nWait, let me think of the columns in order. Let's compute for each column the number of icons in it. \n\nLet col_counts be an array where col_counts[i] is the number of icons in column i. \n\nThe total_icons is sum(col_counts). \n\nThe best k is the largest possible such that for all columns 0..k-1, col_counts[i] == n. \n\nWait, no. Because the arrangement can have some columns not full but still be part of the good arrangement. \n\nWait, the arrangement requires that all icons are in columns 0..k, with columns 0..k-1 completely filled. \n\nSo the best k is the minimal such that the first k columns are completely filled, and the next column has some icons. \n\nAlternatively, the best k is the maximum possible where the first k columns are completely filled. \n\nWait, perhaps the best k is the maximum possible such that the first k columns are completely filled. Then, the next column (k) can have any number of icons. \n\nWait, but the arrangement can have k as any value. \n\nAlternatively, the best k is the maximum possible where the first k columns are completely filled. \n\nThen, the arrangement's capacity is (k * n) + col_counts[k]. \n\nWait, but the arrangement can choose any k. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal k is the maximum possible such that the first k columns are completely filled. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose columns 0 has 3 icons (n=3), column 1 has 3 icons, column 2 has 2 icons. \n\nThen the maximum k where first k columns are full is 2 (since column 2 has 2 <3). \n\nWait, no. The first two columns (0 and 1) are full. So k can be 2 (so columns 0 and 1 are full, and column 2 can have up to its icons. \n\nThe arrangement would be columns 0,1,2. The first two are full, and column 2 has 2 icons. \n\nThe capacity is 3*2 + 2 = 8. \n\nThe total_icons is 3+3+2=8. So moves needed would be 0. \n\nAnother example: if column 0 has 2 icons (n=3), then the maximum k where first k columns are full is 0 (since column 0 isn't full). \n\nSo the arrangement can choose k=0, so the first 0 columns are full (none), and column 0 can have up to its icons. \n\nThe capacity is 0*3 + 2 = 2. \n\nThe total_icons is 2, so moves needed 0. \n\nHmm, so the best k is the maximum possible where the first k columns are completely filled. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Find the maximum k such that for all columns 0..k-1, col_counts[i] == n. \n\nThen, the arrangement's capacity is (k * n) + col_counts[k]. \n\nWait, but the arrangement can choose any k up to m-1. \n\nWait, the maximum possible k is the largest index where all columns before it are full. \n\nSo to compute this k, we can precompute a prefix array. \n\nLet's compute for each column i, whether it is full. \n\nThen, the maximum k is the largest i where all columns 0..i-1 are full. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose columns 0,1 are full, column 2 has 2 icons (n=3). \n\nThen the maximum k where the first k columns are full is 2 (since columns 0 and 1 are full, so k can be 2 (since columns 0..1 are full). \n\nWait, the maximum k is the number of full columns. \n\nWait, the maximum k is the number of full columns. \n\nWait, the maximum k is the largest number such that the first k columns are all full. \n\nSo the maximum k is the count of full columns. \n\nWait, for example, if columns 0,1 are full, column 2 is not, then the maximum k is 2 (since first 2 columns are full). \n\nWait, no, the first 2 columns (0 and 1) are full, so the maximum k is 2. \n\nSo the maximum k is the number of full columns. \n\nWait, yes. \n\nSo the maximum k is the number of full columns. \n\nSo the arrangement's capacity is (k * n) + col_counts[k]. \n\nWait, but the arrangement can choose any k up to the maximum possible. \n\nWait, the arrangement can choose any k (the number of full columns) up to the maximum possible. \n\nWait, the arrangement must choose a k such that the first k columns are full. \n\nSo the best k is the maximum possible such that the first k columns are full. \n\nThus, the capacity is (k * n) + col_counts[k]. \n\nWait, but the arrangement can choose any k up to that maximum. \n\nWait, no. The arrangement must choose the maximum possible k, because that gives the largest possible capacity. \n\nBecause the capacity is maximized when k is as large as possible. \n\nThus, the best k is the maximum possible where the first k columns are full. \n\nSo the capacity is (k * n) + col_counts[k]. \n\nWait, but the arrangement can choose to have k less than that maximum. \n\nBut since we want to maximize the capacity (to minimize the moves), we should choose the maximum possible k. \n\nThus, the minimal moves is total_icons - (k * n + col_counts[k]) + ( (k * n + col_counts[k]) - current_icons_in_good_area )? \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. \n\nThe minimal moves required is the total number of icons outside the good arrangement plus the empty spots in the good arrangement. \n\nThe good arrangement's capacity is (k * n) + s, where s is the number of icons in column k. \n\nWait, no. The good arrangement's capacity is (k * n) + s, where s is the number of icons in column k (since column k can have any number of icons). \n\nWait, the arrangement requires that all icons are in columns 0..k, with columns 0..k-1 full. \n\nThus, the maximum possible icons in the good arrangement is (k * n) + s, where s is the number of icons in column k. \n\nWait, but the arrangement can have any s (the number of icons in column k can be anything, but all icons must be in columns 0..k). \n\nWait, the arrangement's capacity is exactly the number of icons in the first k+1 columns, provided that the first k columns are full. \n\nWait, no. The arrangement must have all icons in columns 0..k, with the first k columns full. \n\nThus, the total icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k columns (each full) plus the icons in column k. \n\nWait, no. The first k columns are full (each has n icons), so their total is k * n. The column k can have any number of icons (but the arrangement must include them). \n\nWait, the arrangement's capacity is exactly the sum of the first k columns (each full) plus the icons in column k. \n\nWait, but the arrangement must include all icons in columns 0..k. \n\nThus, the total icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k+1 columns. \n\nWait, no. The arrangement requires that all icons are in columns 0..k, so the total is the sum of all icons in those columns. \n\nBut the first k columns must be full. \n\nAh, right. So the first k columns must be full (each has exactly n icons), and the (k+1)th column can have any number of icons. \n\nWait, no. The arrangement is defined as follows: \n\nThe first k columns are completely filled (each has n icons), and the (k+1)th column has some icons (possibly zero). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement is that all icons are in columns 0..k, with columns 0..k-1 completely filled. \n\nSo the first k columns (0 to k-1) are full, and the k-th column can have any number of icons. \n\nThus, the total icons in the good arrangement is (k * n) + (number of icons in column k). \n\nBut the arrangement must include all icons in columns 0..k. \n\nThus, the total icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k columns (each full) plus the icons in column k. \n\nWait, but the first k columns (0 to k-1) are full, so their total is k * n. The column k can have any number of icons (but the arrangement must include them). \n\nThus, the total icons in the good arrangement is (k * n) + col_counts[k]. \n\nThe minimal moves required is the number of icons outside this arrangement (which is total_icons - (k*n + col_counts[k])) plus the number of empty spots in the arrangement (which is (k*n + col_counts[k]) - (current icons in the arrangement)). \n\nWait, no. The empty spots in the arrangement are (k*n + col_counts[k]) - (current icons in the arrangement). \n\nWait, the current icons in the arrangement are exactly the sum of the first k columns (each full) plus the icons in column k. \n\nWait, no. The current icons in the arrangement are exactly the sum of all icons in columns 0..k. \n\nBecause the arrangement requires that all icons are in those columns. \n\nThus, the empty spots in the arrangement are (k*n + col_counts[k]) - (sum of first k+1 columns). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is (k*n) + col_counts[k] (since the first k columns are full, and the k-th column has col_counts[k] icons). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is (k*n) + (number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, the arrangement's capacity is exactly the number of icons in the first k+1 columns. \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is the maximum possible icons that can be in the good arrangement. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the moves required. \n\nThe moves needed are the number of icons outside the good arrangement (must be moved into it) plus the number of empty spots in the good arrangement (must be filled by moving icons into them). \n\nThe good arrangement's capacity is (k * n) + s, where s is the number of icons in column k. \n\nWait, no. The good arrangement must have all icons in columns 0..k, with the first k columns full. \n\nThus, the total icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k columns (each full) plus the icons in column k. \n\nWait, the first k columns are full (each has n icons), so their total is k * n. The column k can have any number of icons (but the arrangement must include them). \n\nWait, the arrangement's total is (k * n) + col_counts[k]. \n\nThe total_icons is the sum of all columns. \n\nThe number of icons outside the good arrangement is total_icons - (k*n + col_counts[k]). \n\nThe empty spots in the good arrangement are (k*n + col_counts[k]) - (current icons in the good arrangement). \n\nWait, the current icons in the good arrangement are exactly the sum of the first k+1 columns. \n\nThus, the empty spots are (k*n + col_counts[k]) - (sum of first k+1 columns). \n\nWait, no. The good arrangement's capacity is (k*n) + col_counts[k], but the current icons in the good arrangement are the sum of the first k+1 columns. \n\nWait, the first k columns are full (each has n icons), so their sum is k*n. The column k has col_counts[k] icons. \n\nThus, the total in the good arrangement is exactly k*n + col_counts[k]. \n\nWait, but the first k columns are full, so their sum is k*n. The column k can have any number of icons. \n\nThus, the total in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k+1 columns. \n\nWait, no. The first k columns are full (each has n icons), so their sum is k*n. The column k (the (k+1)th column?) \n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the indices. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose k is the number of full columns. \n\nThen the first k columns (0 to k-1) are full. \n\nThe next column (k) can have any number of icons. \n\nThus, the total in the good arrangement is (k * n) + col_counts[k]. \n\nThe total_icons is the sum of all columns. \n\nThe number of icons outside the good arrangement is total_icons - (k*n + col_counts[k]). \n\nThe empty spots in the good arrangement are (k*n + col_counts[k]) - (current icons in the good arrangement). \n\nWait, the current icons in the good arrangement are exactly the sum of the first k columns (each full) plus the icons in column k. \n\nWait, the first k columns are full, so their sum is k*n. The column k has col_counts[k] icons. \n\nThus, the current icons in the good arrangement is exactly (k*n + col_counts[k]). \n\nWait, then the empty spots would be zero? \n\nNo, that can't be. \n\nWait, the arrangement requires that all icons are in the first k+1 columns. \n\nThus, the current icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of all icons in the first k+1 columns. \n\nWait, but the first k columns are full (so their sum is k*n), and the (k+1)th column has col_counts[k+1] icons. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the indices. \n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nLet the arrangement choose k as the number of full columns. \n\nThen, the first k columns (0 to k-1) are full (each has n icons). \n\nThe next column (k) can have any number of icons (but all icons must be in columns 0..k). \n\nThus, the total icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k columns (each full) plus the icons in column k. \n\nThe total_icons is the sum of all columns. \n\nThe number of icons outside the good arrangement is total_icons - (sum of first k columns + column k's icons). \n\nThe empty spots in the good arrangement are (k*n + column_k's icons) - (sum of first k columns + column k's icons) \n\nWait, no. The good arrangement's capacity is (k*n) + (the maximum possible in column k, which is n). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is the maximum possible icons that can be in the good arrangement. \n\nWait, the arrangement's capacity is (k*n) + (number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is the total number of icons that can be in the good arrangement. \n\nThe good arrangement requires that the first k columns are full (each has n icons), and the (k+1)th column can have any number of icons. \n\nThus, the maximum possible capacity for this arrangement is (k*n) + (number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, but the arrangement must include all icons in columns 0..k. \n\nThus, the current icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k+1 columns. \n\nThe empty spots in the good arrangement are (k*n + column_k's capacity) - current icons. \n\nWait, the column k can have up to n icons. \n\nThus, the maximum possible capacity for the arrangement is (k*n) + (number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is the total number of icons that can be in the good arrangement. \n\nThe good arrangement's capacity is (k*n) + (the number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is the total number of icons that can be in the good arrangement. \n\nThe good arrangement requires that the first k columns are full (each has n icons), and the (k+1)th column can have any number of icons. \n\nThus, the total capacity is (k*n) + (number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, but the arrangement must include all icons in columns 0..k. \n\nThus, the current icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k+1 columns. \n\nThe empty spots in the good arrangement are (k*n + column_k's capacity) - current icons. \n\nWait, the column k can have up to n icons. \n\nThus, the maximum possible capacity for the arrangement is (k*n) + (number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, no. The arrangement's capacity is the total number of icons that can be in the good arrangement. \n\nThe good arrangement's capacity is (k*n) + (the number of icons in column k). \n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. \n\nPerhaps the minimal moves required is (total_icons - (k*n + s)) + ( (k*n + s) - (current icons in the good arrangement) ), where s is the number of icons in column k. \n\nWait, but the current icons in the good arrangement is exactly (k*n + s). \n\nThus, the second term is zero. \n\nHmm, that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the moves needed are the number of icons outside the good arrangement plus the number of empty spots in the good arrangement. \n\nThe number of icons outside is (total_icons - (k*n + s)), where s is the number of icons in column k. \n\nThe empty spots in the good arrangement are (k*n + s) - (current icons in the good arrangement). \n\nWait, but the current icons in the good arrangement is exactly (k*n + s). \n\nThus, the empty spots are zero. \n\nThis suggests that the moves needed are (total_icons - (k*n + s)), but that can't be right. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nThe problem says that the good arrangement requires that all icons are in the first k columns (with first k-1 full) plus possibly some in the next column. \n\nWait, the arrangement must have all icons in columns 0..k, with columns 0..k-1 full. \n\nThus, the total icons in the good arrangement is exactly the sum of the first k columns (each full) plus the icons in column k. \n\nThe total_icons is the sum of all columns. \n\nThe number of icons outside the good arrangement is total_icons - (k*n + col_counts[k]). \n\nThe empty spots in the good arrangement are (k*n + col_counts[k]) - (sum of first k columns + col_counts[k]). \n\nWait, the first k columns are full (sum is k*n), so the total in the good arrangement is exactly k*n + col_counts[k]. \n\nThus, the empty spots are zero. \n\nThus, the moves needed are (total_icons - (k*n + col_counts[k])) + 0 = total_icons - (k*n + col_counts[k]). \n\nWait, but that can't be right. \n\nWait, the moves needed are the number of icons outside the good arrangement (must be moved into the good area) plus the number of empty spots in the good area (must be filled by moving icons into them). \n\nBut if the good arrangement's capacity is exactly the current icons in it, then there are no empty spots. \n\nThus, the moves needed are the number of icons outside the good arrangement. \n\nBut that would mean that the minimal moves is the number of icons outside the good arrangement. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. \n\nSuppose the good arrangement has capacity 5, and there are 3 icons in it. Then the empty spots are 2. \n\nThe icons outside are (total_icons - 5). \n\nThe moves needed would be (total_icons -5) + 2 = total_icons -3. \n\nWhich is (total_icons - (5 -3)) = total_icons - (current icons in good arrangement). \n\nHmm, so the formula is (total_icons - current_icons_in_good) + (capacity - current_icons_in_good) \n\n= total_icons + capacity - 2 * current_icons_in_good \n\nThus, the minimal moves is total_icons + capacity - 2 * current_icons_in_good \n\nTo minimize this, we need to choose the capacity (for the best k) that maximizes (capacity - 2 * current_icons_in_good + total_icons). \n\nWait, but how do we compute this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves is the minimal over all possible k of (total_icons - (k*n + col_counts[k])) + ( (k*n + col_counts[k]) - (sum of first k columns + col_counts[k]) ) \n\nWait, no. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code provided in program1.py is trying to track the current best k and compute the minimal moves quickly. \n\nLooking back at the code:\n\nThe function returns c - cc. \n\nThe variables c and cc are initialized to 0. \n\nWhen adding an icon, the code does:\n\nif p[i] was False before:\n\n    if i < c: then cc +=1 \n\n    c +=1 \n\n    if p[c-1] is True (now, since we added the icon at i, which is now c-1?), then cc +=1 \n\nWait, perhaps c is the current maximum index where an icon exists. \n\nFor example, when you add an icon at position i, then c is set to max(c, i+1). \n\nWait, perhaps c is the current maximum index of any icon plus 1. \n\nSo, the maximum index of any icon is c-1. \n\nThen, the current \"good\" arrangement's k is determined by the first k columns being full. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the current maximum column where icons are present. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables c and cc are not the right approach, and the problem requires a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the missing code in the else block (when removing an icon) is to check if the new c (after decrementing) has an icon, and adjust cc accordingly. \n\nIn the else clause (when removing an icon):\n\nif i < c: then cc -=1 \n\nc -=1 \n\nif p[c]: \n\n    # need to add 1 to cc? \n\nBecause the new c is now the previous c-1, and if that position has an icon, then it should be counted in cc. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's cc is the number of icons in the current \"good\" area. \n\nThe good area is up to c. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's c is the current maximum index of any icon. \n\nThen, the good arrangement's k is determined by the first columns up to c. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's c is the current number of icons. \n\nBut then, the return value c - cc would be the number of icons not in the good area. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the code's cc is the number of icons in the good area. \n\nThe minimal moves is the number of icons outside the good area (c - cc) plus the empty spots in the good area (which would be (good_area_size - cc)). \n\nBut the code returns c - cc, which would be the first part. \n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and the missing part is to add 1 to cc if p[c] is true. \n\nIn the else block after decrementing c:\n\nif p[c] is true, then since the new c is now the previous c-1, and that position has an icon, then we need to add 1 to cc. \n\nWait, the code's logic for adding an icon was:\n\nWhen adding an icon at position i:\n\nif i < c: then the icon is within the current c (which is the previous maximum?), so cc increases. \n\nThen c is increased by 1. \n\nThen, if the new c-1 (which is the previous c) has an icon (now p[c-1] is true), then cc increases again. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's c is the current maximum index of any icon plus 1. \n\nSo, the maximum index of any icon is c-1. \n\nThus, when you add an icon at position i, if i is less than c (the previous maximum +1), then the new maximum is still c-1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's c is the current maximum index of any icon plus 1. \n\nSo, when you add an icon at position i, the new maximum is max(c-1, i). \n\nThus, the new c would be max(c, i+1). \n\nBut in the code, when adding an icon, c is increased by 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the current maximum index of any icon. \n\nThe initial code for adding an icon:\n\nif p[i] was False before:\n\n    if i < c: \n\n        cc +=1 \n\n    c +=1 \n\n    if p[c-1]: \n\n        cc +=1 \n\nWait, perhaps c is the current maximum index of any icon plus 1. \n\nInitially, c is 0. \n\nWhen you add an icon at position i, then the new maximum is max(c-1, i). \n\nThus, the new c would be max(c, i+1). \n\nBut in the code, c is increased by 1. \n\nThis suggests that the code is not correctly tracking the maximum index. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect and the missing part is to add 1 to cc if p[c] is true. \n\nIn the else block (when removing an icon):\n\nAfter decrementing c, if p[c] is true, then since the new c is now the previous c-1, and that position has an icon, then we need to add 1 to cc. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ncc +=1 \n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nelse:\n    if i < c:\n        cc -= 1\n    c -= 1\n    if p[c]:\n        cc += 1\n\nThis way, when we remove an icon and decrement c, if the new c has an icon, then it's part of the current good area (up to c), so cc increases. \n\nThis makes sense. \n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to add \"cc +=1\" in that block. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that their total weights are equal. \n\nThe approach in the code is to compute the prefix sums and suffix sums. \n\nThe code uses a dictionary d to store the prefix sums and their indices. \n\nThe code loops through the array, accumulating the prefix sum s. \n\nIf s exceeds x (half of the total sum), then it breaks. \n\nThe dictionary d stores s: index. \n\nThen, it loops through the suffix sums, accumulating s, and checks if it's in d. \n\nThe maximum is the sum of the indices. \n\nThe missing part is in the line: \n\nif s > x: # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe idea is that once the prefix sum exceeds x (half the total), there's no point in continuing because Alice can't take more candies than that. \n\nSo the code should break the loop. \n\nThus, the missing code is \"break\". \n\nSo the line becomes:\n\nif s > x: break \n\nNow for program3.py. \n\nThe problem involves a grid where white cells are those with y < a_x. \n\nThe goal is to make all white cells have zero dolls through operations. \n\nThe minimal number of operations mod 1e9+7. \n\nThe code provided has a loop for i in range(1, 9**6), which is way too big. \n\nThe code's variables are not clear. \n\nThe problem's note says that the minimal operations are 5 for the first example. \n\nThe code's first line is: \n\nn,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n\nThen a loop for i in range(1, 9**6): \n\nThis loop is incomplete. \n\nThe next line is for z in map(...): \n\nThe code is probably trying to compute some combinatorial values using factorials. \n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal number of operations to move all dolls out of white cells. \n\nThe key insight is that each operation splits a doll into two, so the total number of dolls increases by 1 each time. \n\nThe initial doll is at (0,0). \n\nThe white cells are those where y < a_x. \n\nThe operations must move dolls out of white cells. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all white cells of the number of times a doll must be moved out of them. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) multiplied by the number of times they are in the white cell. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) multiplied by the number of times they are in the white cell. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of paths to (x,y) from (0,0) multiplied by the number of times they are in the white cell. \n\nThe number of paths to (x,y) is the binomial coefficient (x+y choose x). \n\nBut since the sequence a is non-increasing, the white cells form a certain region. \n\nThe minimal operations required is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the binomial coefficient (x+y choose x). \n\nBecause each time a doll reaches a white cell, it must be split until it's moved out. \n\nWait, the problem requires that all white cells have zero dolls. \n\nEach operation on a doll at (x,y) produces two dolls at (x+1,y) and (x,y+1). \n\nThus, the number of operations needed is the number of times a doll is present in a white cell. \n\nThe total number of operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) multiplied by the number of times the doll is present there. \n\nWait, each time a doll is present in a white cell, it must be operated on, so each such occurrence contributes 1 to the total operations. \n\nThus, the total operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y). \n\nBecause each path corresponds to a doll that must be operated on until it leaves the white cell. \n\nThe white cells are those where y < a_x. \n\nThus, the answer is the sum for all x and y where y < a_x of C(x+y, x), modulo 1e9+7. \n\nThe problem requires to compute this sum. \n\nThe code's initial lines are trying to compute factorials mod m. \n\nThe code has f = [1], which is the factorial array. \n\nThe loop for i in range(1, 9**6) is probably to precompute factorials up to some maximum needed. \n\nBut 9**6 is 531441, which is larger than the constraints (n up to 2e5). \n\nThe next line is for z in the a array: \n\nd += f[z+x] * ... \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the sum using combinatorial terms. \n\nThe formula for the binomial coefficient C(n, k) is f[n] / (f[k] * f[n-k]) mod m. \n\nBut since we need to compute C(x+y, x), it's f[x+y] / (f[x] * f[y]). \n\nThe code's line: \n\nd += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],-1,m)*(z>0);x+=1 \n\nWait, perhaps this is trying to compute the sum for each x. \n\nWait, the input is a_0, a_1, ..., a_n. \n\nThe loop for z in the input array: \n\nEach z is a_x for x from 0 to n. \n\nThe variable x starts at 0 and increments each iteration. \n\nThe term f[z+x] is f[a_x + x]. \n\nThe denominator is f[x+1] * f[z-1]. \n\nWait, perhaps this is the binomial coefficient C(a_x + x -1, x). \n\nBecause C(a_x +x -1, x) = (a_x +x-1 choose x) = (a_x +x-1)!/(x! (a_x-1)! )) \n\nThus, the term would be f[a_x +x-1] / (f[x] * f[a_x-1]). \n\nBut the code has f[z+x] (z is a_x) divided by (f[x+1] * f[z-1]). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the sum of C(x + y, x) for y from 0 to a_x-1. \n\nBecause for each x, the white cells are y < a_x. \n\nThus, the sum for x is the sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} C(x+y, x). \n\nThe sum_{y=0}^k C(n, y) is C(n+1, k+1) -1? \n\nWait, the sum_{y=0}^k C(x+y, x) = C(x + k +1, x+1). \n\nBecause the sum_{y=0}^k C(n, y) = C(n+1, k+1) -1? \n\nWait, the identity is sum_{y=0}^k C(x+y, x) = C(x +k+1, x+1). \n\nYes, this is a combinatorial identity. \n\nThus, for each x, the contribution is C(x + a_x, x+1). \n\nThus, the total sum is the sum over x from 0 to n of C(x + a_x, x+1). \n\nBecause the white cells for x are y from 0 to a_x-1. \n\nThe sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} C(x+y, x) = C(x + a_x, x+1) -1? \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nsum_{y=0}^k C(n, y) = C(n+1, k+1) -1? \n\nWait, the identity is sum_{y=0}^k C(m + y, m) = C(m +k+1, m+1). \n\nYes, because each term C(m+y, m) is the number of ways to choose m items from m+y, which is the same as the number of ways to have the last item at position m+y. \n\nThus, the sum from y=0 to k of C(m+y, m) = C(m +k+1, m+1). \n\nThus, for each x, the sum of C(x+y, x) for y from 0 to a_x-1 is C(x + a_x, x+1). \n\nThus, the total is the sum over x of C(x + a_x, x+1). \n\nThus, the code needs to compute this sum. \n\nThe code's line is: \n\nd += f[z+x] * pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],-1,m)*(z>0);x+=1 \n\nWait, z is a_x. \n\nThe term is f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1]) \n\nWhich is C(z+x-1, x) \n\nWait, because C(z+x-1, x) = (z+x-1)!/(x! (z-1)! )) \n\nWhich is exactly f[z+x-1]/(f[x] * f[z-1]). \n\nBut the code has f[z+x] divided by (f[x+1] * f[z-1]). \n\nHmm, perhaps there's an off-by-one error. \n\nWait, the correct term is C(x + a_x, x+1) = (x + a_x)! / ( (x+1)! (a_x-1)! ) \n\nThus, the numerator is f[x + a_x], denominator is f[x+1] * f[a_x -1]. \n\nThus, the code's term is correct. \n\nBut the code uses z as a_x. \n\nThus, the code's line is correct except for the condition (z>0). \n\nBecause when a_x is 0, the term is zero (since there are no white cells for that x). \n\nThus, the code's line is correct. \n\nThe missing part in the first line is the loop for precomputing factorials up to the maximum needed. \n\nThe first line has: \n\nfor i in range(1,9**6): \n\nThis is probably to precompute factorials up to (x + a_x) for all x. \n\nThe maximum possible x is n (up to 2e5), and a_x can be up to 2e5. \n\nThus, the maximum needed factorial is up to 4e5. \n\nThe loop should run up to (n + max_a). \n\nBut the code uses 9**6 which is 531441, which is sufficient for n up to 2e5. \n\nThus, the missing code is to precompute the factorials up to the required maximum. \n\nThe initial code has f = [1], and the loop for i in range(1, 9**6): \n\nProbably, the loop is missing the code to compute f[i] = f[i-1] * i mod m. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\nf.append(f[-1] * i % m) \n\nThus, the first line's loop should be: \n\nfor i in range(1, 9**6): \n\n    f.append(f[-1] * i % m) \n\nThis way, f[i] holds i! mod m. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3.py is to add this line inside the loop. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is adding \"cc +=1\" in the else block. \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is \"break\". \n\nFor program3.py, the missing code is the loop to compute factorials. \n\nThus, the final answers are:\n\nprogram1: \n\nIn the else clause after c -=1:\n\nif p[c]:\n    cc += 1\n\nprogram2: \n\nThe line after the if s >x: is break. \n\nprogram3: \n\nThe loop for precomputing factorials:\n\nfor i in range(1, 9**6):\n    f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\n\nThus, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"cc += 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"break\",\n  \"program3\": \"f.append(f[-1] * i % m)\"\n}"
