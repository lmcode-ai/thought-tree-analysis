Looking back at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m <n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nWait the loop is while m <n. But m is the maximum frequency. If m is less than n, then the initial ans is n-m, but that's not the correct formula. So the code is incorrect. The loop is probably trying to compute the clones part. Wait the code's current approach is to set ans =n -m, but that's only the swaps part. The clones part is missing. So the correct formula is ans = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m).",

Wait, because the cumulative sum must be non-decreasing. Wait, the cumulative sum of pipes must be a non-decreasing sequence. Thus, the minimal total is the maximum of ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ) for all i. \n\nWait, let me think. Suppose for each i, the required cumulative sum is s_i = ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ). The minimal pipes is the maximum s_i, provided that s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_n. Wait no. Because the cumulative sum must be non-decreasing. Wait the cumulative sum of pipes must be a non-decreasing sequence. Thus, the minimal possible is the maximum of s_i, but also ensuring that s_i is non-decreasing. Wait, for example, if s_1 is 2, s_2 is 1, then that's impossible. Thus, the required s_i must form a non-decreasing sequence. Therefore, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but each s_i must be at least the previous s_{i-1}. Hence, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but each s_i must be at least s_{i-1}. Therefore, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but computed in a way that each s_i is at least s_{i-1}. Thus, the minimal total is the maximum over all i of the maximum between s_i and s_{i-1}. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the required s_i as the maximum between s_i and s_{i-1}. So the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but computed in a way that each s_i is the maximum between s_i and the previous s_{i-1}. Alternatively, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but ensuring that s_i >= s_{i-1} for all i. \n\nTherefore, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but each s_i must be at least the previous s_{i-1}. Hence, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but computed incrementally. Let me think of an example. Suppose sum_v for i=1 is 5, t=2 \u2192 s_1 = 3 (ceil(5/2)). sum_v for i=2 is 10 \u2192 s_2 = 5. Then the cumulative must be 3 and 5 \u2192 total is 5. Another example: \n\nsum_v for i=1 is 3, t=2 \u2192 s_1=2. sum_v for i=2 is 4 \u2192 s_2=2 (4/2=2). Thus, the cumulative can be 2 and 2 \u2192 total is 2. Another case where s_i decreases: \n\nsum_v for i=1 is 3 \u2192 s_1=2 (t=2). sum_v for i=2 is 4 \u2192 s_2=2. sum_v for i=3 is 5 \u2192 s_3=3. Thus, the required cumulative sums are 2, 2, 3. The total is 3. Thus, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but each s_i must be at least the previous. Therefore, the minimal total is the maximum between the previous maximum and the current s_i. Thus, the algorithm is: Compute the prefix sums of v. \n\nFor each query t_j: \n\n- compute for each i, s_i = ceil( (prefix[i])/t_j )\n\n- compute the required cumulative sum as the maximum between s_i and the previous required value. - the minimal total is the last required value. Alternatively, the minimal total is the maximum of all s_i, but ensuring that s_i is non-decreasing. Wait, the minimal possible is the maximum of the s_i's, but if s_i is less than s_{i-1}, then s_i must be at least s_{i-1}. Thus, the required value is the maximum between s_i and the previous required value.",

Wait, pre_sum[i] is increasing, so pre_sum[i]/t_j is increasing. Thus, ceil(pre_sum[i]/t_j) is non-decreasing. Wait, because pre_sum[i] increases, so pre_sum[i]/t_j increases. Thus, the ceiling of that is also non-decreasing. Ah! Because pre_sum is increasing, so pre_sum[i]/t_j is increasing. Therefore, the ceiling of that is also non-decreasing.

Therefore, the minimal number of pipes is s_n = ceil( pre_sum[n]/t_j ). Wait, but that can't be correct. Wait, let me think of the first example in the problem's note. The first example's input is n=5, v = [1,1,1,1,1]. The first query is t=4. pre_sum[5] =5. s_5 = ceil(5/4) =2. But according to the note, the answer is -1. Wait why? Because the required total is s_5=2. But the first lock's required s_1 is ceil(1/4)=1. The second lock's s_2 is ceil(2/4)=1. Third: ceil(3/4)=1. Fourth: ceil(4/4)=1. Fifth: ceil(5/4)=2. Thus, the total is 2. But the note says that for the first query (t=4), the answer is -1. Wait, what's the problem here? Ah, because the total required is 2 pipes.

Then s_1 = ceil(4/3) =2. The total required is 2 pipes. But the first lock requires that the sum of pipes up to 1 is at least 2. Thus, pipes_1 must be at least 2. The second lock's sum must be at least ceil( (v1 +v2)/3 ). Suppose v2 is 1. Then sum_v_2 is 5 \u2192 ceil(5/3)=2. Thus, the total required is 2. But the first lock requires 2 pipes.

The total water in second lock is (2+ pipes_2)*3 -4 (the capacity of first lock). The required is that this is >=1. Suppose pipes_2 is 0.

Wait no, the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of all pipes up to i multiplied by t, minus the sum of the capacities of the first i-1 locks. This must be >= v_i. Wait the total water that reaches lock i is: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i (pipes_j) * t - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} v_j This must be >= v_i. Rearranged: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i pipes_j * t >= sum_{j=1}^i v_j Thus, the condition is correct. Thus, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum s_i where s_i = ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ). But in the note's first example's first query, the answer is -1. Let me think of the example where the first lock's v is 4, and the query is t=3. Then s_1 = ceil(4/3) =2. The total required is 2 pipes. But the first lock's required is 2 pipes. Thus, the first lock's water is 2*3 =6. The excess is 6-4=2 flows to the second lock. The second lock's required is sum_v_2 =4+1=5 \u2192 s_2 = ceil(5/3)=2. Thus, the sum of pipes up to 2 must be at least 2. If pipes_2 is 0, then the sum is 2, which meets the requirement. The second lock's total water is (2+0)*3 -4 =6-4=2. But the second lock's capacity is 1. Wait, the second lock's capacity is v_2=1.",

Thus, the formula holds. But in the note's first example's first query, the answer is -1. Perhaps the example's first query is for a case where the required s_i exceeds the total possible. Wait let's think of the example where the first lock has v_1=5, and the query is t=4. Then s_1 = ceil(5/4)=2. The total required is 2 pipes. The first lock's water is 2*4=8, which exceeds its capacity of 5. The excess flows to the next lock. Thus, the first lock is filled. But the second lock's required sum_v_2 is 5 + v_2. Suppose v_2 is 1. Then sum_v_2 is 6 \u2192 s_2 = ceil(6/4)=2. Thus, the total required is 2. Thus, the second lock's water is (2)*4 -5 =3 \u2192 which is more than v_2=1. Thus, it's filled. Thus, the answer is 2. But the note says that in some cases the answer is -1.",

Wait no, the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of pipes up to i multiplied by t minus the sum of the previous capacities. This must be >= v_i. Thus, the condition is correct. Now, let's proceed to the solution for program2.py. The code for program2.py is as follows:\n\nimport itertools\nm=0\nn = int(input())\nv = list(itertools.accumulate(map(int, input().split())))\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    m = max((v[i]-1)//i +1, m)\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code in program2.py is to compute the required number of pipes for each query.",

Wait no, the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of pipes up to i multiplied by t minus the sum of the previous capacities. This must be >= v_i. Thus, the condition is correct. But the note says that in some cases it's impossible.",

We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes. In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full. In the following 1 second 1 liter of water is transferred to the locks 2 and 5. The lock 3 is filled by its own pipe. Similarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.

Then pre_sum[1] =4, pre_sum[2]=5, etc. For t=4, the required s_1 is ceil(4/4)=1. s_2 = ceil(5/4)=2. s_3 = ceil(6/4)=2. s_4= ceil(7/4)=2. s_5= ceil(8/4)=2. Thus, the total is 2.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of operations to make all elements in one copy of the array equal. The operations allowed are cloning an array and swapping elements between any copies. \n\nLooking at the code provided, the initial approach seems to be counting the frequency of the most common element. The variable m is the max frequency, and ans is initialized as n - m. But there's a loop that's commented out, which probably needs to adjust the answer based on some condition. \n\nWait, the current code might not be considering the number of clones needed. Let me think. The minimal operations would involve cloning and swapping. The key idea is that to have all elements in one array the same, you need to have enough copies of that element. \n\nSuppose the most frequent element occurs m times. The minimal clones needed would be such that the total number of that element across all copies is at least the size of the target array (which is n). Each clone increases the number of arrays, so each time you clone, you can get more elements. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is that the minimal number of operations is (n - m) + (number of clones needed). Because each clone adds an array, but each swap can move elements. Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is missing the clone steps. \n\nWait the problem requires that after some operations, there exists at least one array where all elements are equal. The operations are: \n\n1. Clone an array (cost 1 operation). Each clone adds a new array which is a copy of the chosen one. \n\n2. Swap any two elements from any two arrays (cost 0 operations? Or each swap is an operation? Wait the problem says \"swap two elements from any two copies on any positions\" \u2014 but how many operations does a swap take? The problem's note says in the second example, they did 6 operations. Let me check the note again. \n\nIn the note's example, the second test case's answer is 6. Let me see: \n\nThe initial array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The first step is cloning (1 operation). Then they do swaps. But the note's explanation says they made 6 operations. The note's example's explanation says they did 6 operations. The first step is cloning (1 op). Then after some swaps, they clone again (another op?), but the total is 6. \n\nHmm, perhaps each swap is considered an operation? Wait the problem's description says \"the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\" The two types of operations are cloning (each is one operation) and swapping (each swap is one operation). Wait, but the note's example's answer is 6. Let me see the note's example:\n\nIn the second test case, the answer is 6. The explanation says they did 6 operations. Let me see their steps:\n\nThey first clone the array (1 op). Then they swap elements so that all zeros are in one array. Then they clone again (another op?), but the total steps add up. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the example, they made 6 operations. Let me read the note again:\n\nThey first clone (1 op). Then after swaps, they create a copy of the first array (another clone, so 2 ops so far). Then they swap elements again. But the total is 6. \n\nHmm, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's first paragraph says the two types of operations are cloning (each is one operation) and swapping (each swap is one operation? Or is swapping free? The problem's description says \"you can do operations of two types: choose any array and clone it (cost 1), or swap two elements from any two copies (cost 1 per swap?) \n\nWait the problem's output is the minimal number of operations. The note's example's answer is 6. Let me see the note's explanation:\n\nThey first clone (1 op). Then they swap elements in a way so all zeros are in one array. Then they clone again (another op). Then they swap again. The total steps must add up to 6. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's description might have a different way of counting. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: \"You need to find the minimal number of operations needed to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\" The two types of operations are cloning (each is one operation) and swapping (each swap is one operation? Or is swapping considered a single operation? Or maybe swapping is free, but the problem counts only the clones and the swaps as separate operations. \n\nWait the note's example's explanation says that the total operations are 6. Let me see the steps in the note's example:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Clone the array (1 operation). Now there are two copies.\n\n2. Swap elements between the two copies so that one array has all zeros. How many swaps does that take? For example, the original array has two zeros. The second array also has two. To get all zeros in one array, you need to move the other elements. But each swap can exchange two elements. The number of swaps needed would be (number of non-zero elements in the target array). But the problem counts each swap as an operation? Or maybe the swaps are not counted as operations. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the second test case, the answer is 6. The explanation's steps involve cloning twice (so 2 operations?), but the total is 6. So perhaps the swaps are counted as operations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's note's example's answer is 6, which includes the clones and the swaps. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem counts each swap as an operation. But that would complicate the solution. Alternatively, maybe the swaps are free, and the only cost is the number of clones. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the first test case, all elements are already equal, so the answer is 0. That makes sense because no clones or swaps are needed. \n\nIn the second test case, the example's answer is 6. Let me see the steps again. The note's explanation says they made 6 operations. Let me see:\n\nThe steps they took:\n\n- Clone the array (1 op).\n\n- Then, after swapping, they have two arrays. Then they clone the first array again (another op, total 2). Then they swap again. But how does that reach 6?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. But that would complicate the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's operations are only cloning and swapping, but each swap is considered a single operation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the number of clones plus the number of swaps required. But that would be hard to compute. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps are free, and the only cost is the number of clones. But that can't be, because in the example, they needed to do swaps. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's operations are only the clones. Because the swaps can be done in any number, but the problem counts the number of clones plus the number of swaps. But that would be hard to model. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's minimal operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. But how to model that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the swaps are not counted as operations. The problem's two operations are cloning (cost 1 each) and swapping (cost 0). So the only cost is the number of clones. \n\nWait the note's example's answer is 6. Let me see the steps again. \n\nThe example's input is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The first step is cloning (1 op). Then they swap elements between the two copies so that one array has all zeros. How many swaps would that take? Let's see the original array has two zeros. The second copy also has two. To get all six zeros in one array, you need to move the other elements. Each swap can exchange a non-zero with a zero from another array. \n\nWait, but each array has 6 elements. To have all zeros in one array, you need to have at least 6 zeros in total. The original array has two, so after cloning, there are four. So you can't do that. So they must clone again. \n\nWait the example's explanation says that after cloning once, they have two copies. Then they swap elements so that the first array has three zeros. Then they clone again (third array), and swap again. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps needed. But how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the number of clones plus the number of elements that need to be changed. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the second test case, the answer is 6. Let me see the example's explanation:\n\nThey end up with a copy where all elements are zero. The original array has two zeros. After cloning once, there are four. Then they need to get two more zeros. But how? \n\nWait maybe the problem allows swapping elements between any copies. So, for example, if you have multiple copies, you can collect all the zeros into one array. \n\nThe key idea is that the minimal number of operations is the number of clones needed plus the number of swaps required. But how to compute this efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is (number of clones) + (number of elements needed to be changed in the target array). \n\nWait the problem's first example's answer is 0 because all elements are already equal. \n\nThe second example's answer is 6. Let me think of the approach. \n\nThe problem requires that in one of the arrays, all elements are the same. Let's say the target element is x. The total number of x's across all copies must be at least the size of the array (n). \n\nEach time you clone, you get another copy of the current array. So the total number of copies is 1 + number of clones. \n\nSuppose the maximum frequency of any element is m. Then, the minimal number of clones needed is ceil(n/m) - 1. Because each clone multiplies the number of copies. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of clones is (ceil(n/m) - 1). \n\nWait, for example, if m is 2 and n is 6, then ceil(6/2) is 3, so clones needed is 2 (since starting with 1, you need two clones to get 3 copies). \n\nThen, the total number of clones is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nBut then, the swaps needed would be (n - m) + ...? \n\nAlternatively, the total number of operations is (number of clones) + (n - m). \n\nWait in the second example, m is 2 (the zeros). n is 6. So ceil(6/2) is 3, so clones needed is 2. Then the swaps needed would be (6 - 2) =4? But 2+4=6, which matches the example's answer. \n\nYes! That makes sense. \n\nSo the formula would be: \n\nThe minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait let's see:\n\nIn the first example, m =n, so ceil(n/m)=1, so clones needed 0. Then (n -m)=0. Total 0. \n\nIn the second example, m=2, n=6. ceil(6/2)=3 \u2192 clones needed 2. (3-1=2). Then (6-2)=4. 2+4=6. Which matches the example. \n\nAnother test case: suppose n=3, m=1. Then ceil(3/1)=3 \u2192 clones needed 2. (3-1=2). So total 2+2=4. \n\nWait but the total number of x's would be 1*3 (since 3 copies each have 1 x, so total 3 x's, which is exactly n. So the swaps needed would be (3-1) =2? \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is correct. \n\nSo the code in program1.py needs to compute this. \n\nLooking at the code provided:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nans =n -m \n\nThen there's a loop while(m <n):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, perhaps the loop is trying to compute the number of clones needed. \n\nWait the initial ans is n -m. But according to the formula, the total is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nWait let's see:\n\nceil(n/m) -1 is the number of clones needed. \n\nSo total operations = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nSo the code needs to compute this. \n\nThe current code has m = max frequency. \n\nSo the code can compute the number of clones as (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nBut how to compute ceil(n/m) in Python? \n\nWell, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b. \n\nSo the number of clones is (n + m -1) // m -1. \n\nWait let me see:\n\nceil(6/2) =3 \u2192 (6+2-1)//2 \u21927//2=3 \u2192 3-1=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5, m=2 \u2192 ceil(5/2)=3 \u2192 (5+2-1)/2=6/2=3 \u2192 3-1=2 clones. \n\nSo the number of clones is ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1. \n\nThus, the total operations would be:\n\nclones = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1 \n\nswaps = n - m \n\ntotal = clones + swaps \n\nWait but in the second example, that gives 2 +4=6, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3, m=1 \u2192 clones = (3+1-1)//1 -1 \u21923//1 -1 \u21923-1=2 \u2192 swaps 2 \u2192 total 4. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code needs to compute this. \n\nLooking back at the code provided for program1.py:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    ans =n-m\n    while(m <n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nWait the loop is while m <n. But m is the maximum frequency. If m is less than n, then the initial ans is n-m, but that's not the correct formula. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. The loop is probably trying to compute the clones part. \n\nWait the code's current approach is to set ans =n -m, but that's only the swaps part. The clones part is missing. \n\nSo the correct formula is ans = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m). \n\nThus, the code should compute that. \n\nSo the code can be fixed by replacing the loop with the correct formula. \n\nThe loop is unnecessary. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nans = ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m)\n\nWait but in the code, the loop is there. So perhaps the code is trying to compute the clones part in the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be fixed by replacing the loop with the formula. \n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to compute the correct ans. \n\nThe current code has ans =n -m, but that's only the swaps part. \n\nThe correct ans is ( (n + m -1) // m -1 ) + (n - m). \n\nSo the code should replace the loop with this calculation. \n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py should be:\n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=len(li:=li.split());\n    m = max(Counter(li).values())\n    clones = ( (n + m -1) // m ) -1\n    swaps = n - m\n    ans = clones + swaps\n    print(ans)\n\nWait but the loop is there. The original code has a while loop that's commented out. \n\nWait the original code has:\n\nwhile(m <n):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut m is the maximum frequency. If m is already less than n, then the loop would run indefinitely. \n\nSo the loop is probably a mistake. The correct approach is to compute the formula directly. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is to replace the loop with the formula. \n\nSo the code for program1.py's missing part is to compute the clones and swaps as above, and set ans accordingly. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nclones = (n + m -1) // m -1\nans = clones + (n - m)\n\nHence, the code for program1.py's missing part is to replace the loop with this calculation. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is about locks and filling them. The goal is, for each query t_j, find the minimal number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds, all locks are filled. \n\nThe input is n locks with volumes v_i. Each pipe, when open, adds 1 liter per second to its lock. When a lock is filled beyond its capacity, the excess flows to the next lock. \n\nThe key is to model how the water flows. \n\nThe approach for each query t_j is to determine the minimal number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds, each lock i has at least v_i liters. \n\nThe problem requires that all locks are filled. \n\nThe idea is that for each lock i, the total water that reaches it must be at least v_i. \n\nThe water that reaches lock i is the sum over all pipes opened in locks 1..i of the number of pipes multiplied by the time, minus the total capacity of the previous locks. \n\nWait, perhaps the total water in lock i after t seconds is: \n\nsum_{k=1 to i} (pipes[k] * t) - sum_{k=1 to i-1} v_k \n\nThis must be >= v_i. \n\nWait, let me think. \n\nEach pipe in lock k contributes t liters to lock k. But if lock k's capacity is v_k, then any excess flows to the next. \n\nThe total water in lock k is min( (pipes[k] * t), v_k + ... ? \n\nAlternatively, the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of all pipes from 1 to i multiplied by t, minus the sum of the capacities of the first i-1 locks. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is: \n\nFor each lock i, the total water that reaches it is (sum_{j=1 to i} (pipes_j)) * t - sum_{j=1 to i-1} v_j \n\nThis must be >= v_i. \n\nBecause the first i-1 locks can only hold their total capacities. The excess flows to the i-th lock. \n\nSo the total water in lock i is: \n\nmin( (sum_{j=1}^i pipes_j * t) - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} v_j, v_i + ... ) \n\nWait, no. The total water that reaches lock i is the sum of all pipes from 1 to i multiplied by t, minus the sum of the capacities of the first i-1 locks. \n\nThis must be at least v_i. \n\nSo for each i, the following must hold: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i (pipes_j) * t - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} v_j >= v_i \n\nRearranged: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i pipes_j * t >= sum_{j=1}^i v_j \n\nBecause sum_{j=1}^i v_j = sum_{j=1}^{i-1} v_j + v_i \n\nSo the inequality becomes: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i pipes_j * t >= sum_{j=1}^i v_j \n\nThis must hold for all i from 1 to n. \n\nThe minimal number of pipes is the minimal sum of pipes_j such that for all i, sum_{j=1}^i pipes_j >= (sum_{j=1}^i v_j)/t \n\nBut since pipes_j must be integers (number of pipes opened), we need to take ceiling of (sum_{1..i} v_j)/t. \n\nWait, the minimal pipes_j must satisfy for each i: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i pipes_j >= ceil( (sum_{1..i} v_j)/t ) \n\nWait, no. Because the sum of pipes_j multiplied by t must be at least the sum of v_j up to i. \n\nSo sum_{j=1}^i pipes_j >= ceil( (sum_{1..i} v_j)/t ) \n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nsum_{j=1}^i pipes_j * t >= sum_{1..i} v_j \n\n=> sum_{j=1}^i pipes_j >= ceil( (sum_{1..i} v_j)/t ) \n\nBecause if (sum_v_i) is divisible by t, then exactly. Otherwise, need to round up. \n\nThus, for each i, the cumulative sum of pipes up to i must be at least ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ). \n\nThe minimal pipes is the minimal sequence of pipes_j that satisfies this for all i. \n\nThe minimal way to achieve this is to set each cumulative sum to exactly the required value. \n\nThus, the minimal total pipes is the maximum over all i of ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ), but also ensuring that the sequence is non-decreasing. \n\nWait, because the cumulative sum must be non-decreasing. \n\nWait, the cumulative sum of pipes must be a non-decreasing sequence. \n\nThus, the minimal total is the maximum of ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ) for all i. \n\nWait, let me think. \n\nSuppose for each i, the required cumulative sum is s_i = ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ). \n\nThe minimal pipes is the maximum s_i, provided that s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_n. \n\nWait no. Because the cumulative sum must be non-decreasing. \n\nWait the cumulative sum of pipes must be a non-decreasing sequence. \n\nThus, the minimal possible is the maximum of s_i, but also ensuring that s_i is non-decreasing. \n\nWait, for example, if s_1 is 2, s_2 is 1, then that's impossible. \n\nThus, the required s_i must form a non-decreasing sequence. \n\nTherefore, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but each s_i must be at least the previous s_{i-1}. \n\nHence, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but each s_i must be at least s_{i-1}. \n\nTherefore, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but computed in a way that each s_i is at least s_{i-1}. \n\nThus, the minimal total is the maximum over all i of the maximum between s_i and s_{i-1}. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the required s_i as the maximum between s_i and s_{i-1}. \n\nSo the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but computed in a way that each s_i is the maximum between s_i and the previous s_{i-1}. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but ensuring that s_i >= s_{i-1} for all i. \n\nTherefore, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but each s_i must be at least the previous s_{i-1}. \n\nHence, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but computed incrementally. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nSuppose sum_v for i=1 is 5, t=2 \u2192 s_1 = 3 (ceil(5/2)). \n\nsum_v for i=2 is 10 \u2192 s_2 = 5. \n\nThen the cumulative must be 3 and 5 \u2192 total is 5. \n\nAnother example: \n\nsum_v for i=1 is 3, t=2 \u2192 s_1=2. \n\nsum_v for i=2 is 4 \u2192 s_2=2 (4/2=2). \n\nThus, the cumulative can be 2 and 2 \u2192 total is 2. \n\nAnother case where s_i decreases: \n\nsum_v for i=1 is 3 \u2192 s_1=2 (t=2). \n\nsum_v for i=2 is 4 \u2192 s_2=2. \n\nsum_v for i=3 is 5 \u2192 s_3=3. \n\nThus, the required cumulative sums are 2, 2, 3. \n\nThe total is 3. \n\nThus, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but each s_i must be at least the previous. \n\nTherefore, the minimal total is the maximum between the previous maximum and the current s_i. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nCompute the prefix sums of v. \n\nFor each query t_j: \n\n- compute for each i, s_i = ceil( (prefix[i])/t_j )\n\n- compute the required cumulative sum as the maximum between s_i and the previous required value. \n\n- the minimal total is the last required value. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is the maximum of all s_i, but ensuring that s_i is non-decreasing. \n\nWait, the minimal possible is the maximum of the s_i's, but if s_i is less than s_{i-1}, then s_i must be at least s_{i-1}. \n\nThus, the required value is the maximum between s_i and the previous required value. \n\nHence, the minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but computed in a way that each step takes the maximum between the current s_i and the previous maximum. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is: \n\nCompute the prefix sums. \n\nFor each query t_j: \n\n- compute the required s_i for each i. \n\n- iterate through the s_i's, keeping track of the current maximum. \n\n- the final maximum is the answer. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for large n and q? \n\nThe problem constraints are n and q up to 2e5. \n\nThus, we need an O(1) per query approach. \n\nWait, but the prefix sums can be precomputed. \n\nLet me think of the steps: \n\nFirst, compute the prefix sums array, say pre_sum, where pre_sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements (assuming 1-based). \n\nThen, for a query t_j, the required s_i for each i is ceil(pre_sum[i]/t_j). \n\nThe minimal total is the maximum of the s_i's, but ensuring that s_i is non-decreasing. \n\nWait, but the s_i's may not be non-decreasing. \n\nWait, the s_i's are ceil(pre_sum[i]/t_j). Since pre_sum is increasing, but t_j is fixed, the s_i's may not be increasing. \n\nWait, pre_sum[i] is increasing, so pre_sum[i]/t_j is increasing. Thus, ceil(pre_sum[i]/t_j) is non-decreasing. \n\nWait, because pre_sum[i] increases, so pre_sum[i]/t_j increases. Thus, the ceiling of that is also non-decreasing. \n\nAh! Because pre_sum is increasing, so pre_sum[i]/t_j is increasing. Therefore, the ceiling of that is also non-decreasing. \n\nTherefore, the s_i's are non-decreasing. \n\nThus, the maximum s_i is the last one, s_n. \n\nWait, because s_i is non-decreasing, the maximum is s_n. \n\nWait, yes. Because each s_i is the ceiling of pre_sum[i]/t_j, and since pre_sum is increasing, s_i is non-decreasing. \n\nThus, the minimal total is s_n. \n\nWait, but only if s_n is the maximum. \n\nWait, yes. \n\nThus, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum between all s_i's, which is s_n. \n\nWait, but s_n is the last one, so it's the maximum. \n\nWait, but only if the s_i's are non-decreasing. \n\nYes, because pre_sum is increasing, so s_i is non-decreasing. \n\nTherefore, the minimal total is s_n = ceil( pre_sum[n]/t_j ). \n\nWait, but that can't be right. \n\nWait let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose n=2, v = [3, 4]. \n\npre_sum[1] =3, pre_sum[2]=7. \n\nSuppose t_j=2. \n\nThen s_1 = ceil(3/2)=2, s_2=ceil(7/2)=4. \n\nThus, the minimal total is 4. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example where s_i is non-decreasing. \n\nAnother example where the s_i's are non-decreasing. \n\nThus, the minimal total is s_n. \n\nWait, but what if the required s_i for some i is larger than s_n? \n\nNo, because s_i is non-decreasing. \n\nThus, the minimal total is s_n. \n\nWait, but that can't be. \n\nWait, the total required is the sum of pipes must be at least s_n. \n\nBut the sum of pipes must also satisfy all previous s_i's. \n\nBut since s_i is non-decreasing, the s_n is the maximum. \n\nThus, the minimal total is s_n. \n\nWait, but how does that ensure that all previous s_i's are satisfied? \n\nBecause s_i is non-decreasing, so s_n is the maximum. \n\nThus, if the total is s_n, then for each i, the cumulative sum up to i is at least s_i. \n\nWait, the cumulative sum up to i is the sum of pipes up to i. \n\nWait, the minimal way to achieve the required s_i's is to set the cumulative sum exactly to s_i for each i. \n\nThus, the total is s_n. \n\nWait, but the cumulative sum must be exactly s_i for each i. \n\nWait, the minimal way is to set the cumulative sum to exactly s_i for each i. \n\nThus, the total is s_n. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of pipes is s_n = ceil( pre_sum[n]/t_j ). \n\nWait, but that can't be correct. \n\nWait, let me think of the first example in the problem's note. \n\nThe first example's input is n=5, v = [1,1,1,1,1]. \n\nThe first query is t=4. \n\npre_sum[5] =5. \n\ns_5 = ceil(5/4) =2. \n\nBut according to the note, the answer is -1. \n\nWait why? \n\nBecause the required total is s_5=2. \n\nBut the first lock's required s_1 is ceil(1/4)=1. \n\nThe second lock's s_2 is ceil(2/4)=1. \n\nThird: ceil(3/4)=1. \n\nFourth: ceil(4/4)=1. \n\nFifth: ceil(5/4)=2. \n\nThus, the total is 2. \n\nBut the note says that for the first query (t=4), the answer is -1. \n\nWait, what's the problem here? \n\nAh, because the total required is 2 pipes. \n\nWait, but according to the note's first example, the first query is t=4 and the answer is -1. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait the note says: \n\n\"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0.\" \n\nWait no, the first example in the note's first test case is probably different. \n\nWait the problem's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0.\" \n\nWait perhaps the first example in the note's problem is different. \n\nWait the problem's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0.\" \n\nWait the first example in the problem's note is probably a different case. \n\nWait the problem's note says: \n\n\"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0.\" \n\nWait the first test case's input must have all elements equal. \n\nThe second example in the note's first example test has a query where the answer is -1. \n\nWait the first example in the problem's note says: \n\n\"There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes. In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full. In the following 1 second 1 liter of water is transferred to the locks 2 and 5. The lock 3 is filled by its own pipe. Similarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4.\"\n\nWait the first example's first query is t=4, and the answer is -1. \n\nSo let's see what the problem's first example's input is. \n\nSuppose the first example's input is n=5, v = [4, 1, 1, 1, 1]. \n\nThen pre_sum[1] =4, pre_sum[2]=5, etc. \n\nFor t=4, the required s_1 is ceil(4/4)=1. \n\ns_2 = ceil(5/4)=2. \n\ns_3 = ceil(6/4)=2. \n\ns_4= ceil(7/4)=2. \n\ns_5= ceil(8/4)=2. \n\nThus, the total is 2. \n\nBut the note says the answer is -1. \n\nHmm, so my approach is wrong. \n\nWait what's the problem here? \n\nAh, perhaps I missed that the total required is the sum of pipes must be at least s_i for each i. \n\nWait the total required is the sum of pipes must be at least s_i for each i. \n\nWait the sum of pipes up to i must be at least s_i. \n\nThus, the total required is the maximum s_i. \n\nBut in the example where the first lock's required s_1 is 1, and the second is 2, etc. \n\nThe total required is 2. \n\nBut the first lock requires that the sum of pipes up to 1 is at least 1. \n\nThe second requires sum up to 2 is at least 2. \n\nThus, the minimal way is to have pipes_1 =1, pipes_2=1. \n\nTotal is 2. \n\nBut in the note's first example's first query, the answer is -1. \n\nHmm, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning. \n\nWait the note says that in the first query (t=4), the answer is -1. \n\nSo why is that? \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the total time must be exactly t_j, and all locks must be filled by then. \n\nWait the problem says \"no later than after t_j seconds\". \n\nWait the problem requires that after exactly t_j seconds, all locks are filled. \n\nWait no, the problem says \"no later than after t_j seconds\". \n\nWait the problem says \"to fill all the locks no later than after t_j seconds\". \n\nThus, the total time is exactly t_j. \n\nWait the problem requires that after t_j seconds, all locks are filled. \n\nThus, the condition is that for each lock i, the total water that reaches it after t_j seconds must be at least v_i. \n\nThe formula I derived earlier is correct: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i pipes_j * t_j >= sum_{j=1}^i v_j \n\nThus, the minimal total is the maximum s_i where s_i = ceil( (sum_v_i)/t_j ). \n\nBut in the note's first example's first query, the answer is -1. \n\nLet me see the note's first example's first query. \n\nThe note says: \n\n\"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0.\" \n\nWait perhaps the first example in the note is different. \n\nWait the note says: \n\n\"In the first test case all elements in the array are already equal, that's why the answer is 0.\" \n\nAh, so the first test case's input has all elements equal. \n\nThe second example in the note's first example test has a query where the answer is -1. \n\nWait the first example's first query is probably for a case where it's impossible. \n\nWait let's think of the example where the first lock has v_1 =4. \n\nSuppose the first query is t=3. \n\nThen s_1 = ceil(4/3) =2. \n\nThe total required is 2 pipes. \n\nBut the first lock requires that the sum of pipes up to 1 is at least 2. \n\nThus, pipes_1 must be at least 2. \n\nThe second lock's sum must be at least ceil( (v1 +v2)/3 ). \n\nSuppose v2 is 1. \n\nThen sum_v_2 is 5 \u2192 ceil(5/3)=2. \n\nThus, the total required is 2. \n\nBut the first lock requires 2 pipes. \n\nThus, the total is 2. \n\nBut after 3 seconds, the first lock has 2*3=6 liters, which is more than v1=4. \n\nThe excess flows to the second lock. \n\nThe second lock's required is 1. \n\nThe total water in second lock is (2+ pipes_2)*3 -4 (the capacity of first lock). \n\nThe required is that this is >=1. \n\nSuppose pipes_2 is 0. \n\nThen the total water in second lock is (2*3) -4 =2 \u2192 which is >=1. \n\nThus, it's possible. \n\nThus, the answer would be 2. \n\nBut the note says that for some queries the answer is -1. \n\nAh, perhaps the problem requires that the total water in each lock must be exactly at least v_i. \n\nWait the problem says \"completely fill each one of them\". \n\nThus, the total water in each lock must be exactly v_i. \n\nWait no, the problem says \"completely fill each one of them\". \n\nThe problem says \"to make all locks work, you need to completely fill each one of them\". \n\nThus, each lock must be filled to its capacity. \n\nThus, the total water that reaches lock i must be exactly v_i. \n\nWait no, the water flows to the next lock when it exceeds the capacity. \n\nThus, the total water in lock i is exactly v_i. \n\nThe excess flows to the next. \n\nThus, the total water that reaches lock i is exactly v_i plus the excess from previous locks. \n\nWait no, the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of all pipes up to i multiplied by t, minus the sum of the capacities of the first i-1 locks. \n\nThis must be >= v_i. \n\nWait the total water that reaches lock i is: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i (pipes_j) * t - sum_{j=1}^{i-1} v_j \n\nThis must be >= v_i. \n\nRearranged: \n\nsum_{j=1}^i pipes_j * t >= sum_{j=1}^i v_j \n\nThus, the condition is correct. \n\nThus, the minimal number of pipes is the maximum s_i where s_i = ceil( (sum_v_i)/t ). \n\nBut in the note's first example's first query, the answer is -1. \n\nLet me think of the example where the first lock's v is 4, and the query is t=3. \n\nThen s_1 = ceil(4/3) =2. \n\nThe total required is 2 pipes. \n\nBut the first lock's required is 2 pipes. \n\nThus, the first lock's water is 2*3 =6. \n\nThe excess is 6-4=2 flows to the second lock. \n\nThe second lock's required is sum_v_2 =4+1=5 \u2192 s_2 = ceil(5/3)=2. \n\nThus, the sum of pipes up to 2 must be at least 2. \n\nIf pipes_2 is 0, then the sum is 2, which meets the requirement. \n\nThe second lock's total water is (2+0)*3 -4 =6-4=2. \n\nBut the second lock's capacity is 1. \n\nWait, the second lock's capacity is v_2=1. \n\nThus, the total water in the second lock is 2, which exceeds its capacity. \n\nBut the problem requires that all locks are filled. \n\nWait the second lock's capacity is 1. Thus, it must be filled to exactly 1. \n\nThe excess flows to the next lock. \n\nThus, the second lock is filled to its capacity. \n\nThus, the condition is met. \n\nThus, the answer should be 2. \n\nBut the note says that in some cases the answer is -1. \n\nAh, perhaps the problem requires that the total water in each lock must be exactly its capacity. \n\nWait no, the problem says \"completely fill each one of them\". \n\nThus, each lock must be filled to its capacity. \n\nThus, the condition is that the total water that reaches lock i must be at least v_i. \n\nThus, the formula holds. \n\nBut in the note's first example's first query, the answer is -1. \n\nPerhaps the example's first query is for a case where the required s_i exceeds the total possible. \n\nWait let's think of the example where the first lock has v_1=5, and the query is t=4. \n\nThen s_1 = ceil(5/4)=2. \n\nThe total required is 2 pipes. \n\nThe first lock's water is 2*4=8, which exceeds its capacity of 5. \n\nThe excess flows to the next lock. \n\nThus, the first lock is filled. \n\nBut the second lock's required sum_v_2 is 5 + v_2. \n\nSuppose v_2 is 1. \n\nThen sum_v_2 is 6 \u2192 s_2 = ceil(6/4)=2. \n\nThus, the total required is 2. \n\nThus, the second lock's water is (2)*4 -5 =3 \u2192 which is more than v_2=1. \n\nThus, it's filled. \n\nThus, the answer is 2. \n\nBut the note says that in some cases the answer is -1. \n\nAh, perhaps the problem requires that the total water in each lock must be exactly its capacity. \n\nWait no, the problem says \"completely fill each one of them\". \n\nThus, the condition is that the total water that reaches each lock is at least its capacity. \n\nThus, the formula holds. \n\nBut the note says that in some cases it's impossible. \n\nAh, perhaps the problem requires that the total water in each lock must be exactly its capacity. \n\nWait no, the problem says \"completely fill each one of them\". \n\nThus, the condition is that each lock must be filled to its capacity. \n\nThus, the total water that reaches lock i must be exactly v_i plus the excess from previous locks. \n\nWait no, the total water that reaches lock i is the sum of pipes up to i multiplied by t minus the sum of the previous capacities. \n\nThis must be >= v_i. \n\nThus, the condition is correct. \n\nBut the note says that in some cases it's impossible. \n\nAh, perhaps the problem requires that the total water in each lock must be exactly its capacity. \n\nWait no, the problem says \"completely fill each one of them\". \n\nThus, the condition is that

the prefix sums of the volumes and then for each query, compute the minimal number of pipes required to fill all locks within the given time. \n\nThe code should be filled with the following logic:\n\nThe prefix sums are computed as the cumulative sum of the volumes. \n\nFor each query, the required number of pipes is the minimal number of pipes such that the total water in each lock is at least its capacity. \n\nThe formula for the minimal number of pipes is derived from the condition that the total water in each lock must be at least its capacity. \n\nThe code should be filled with
