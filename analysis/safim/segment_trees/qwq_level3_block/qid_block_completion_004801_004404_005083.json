So the two conditions are necessary and sufficient. Therefore, the algorithm can be: For each test case: \n\n- Check that all characters in s have frequency 1 or 2. \n\n- For each character that appears twice, check that the two occurrences are not adjacent. If both conditions are met, output YES, else NO. Now, how to implement this efficiently. First, for the frequency check: \n\nWe can count the frequency of each character. If any has count >2 \u2192 no. Then, for each character with count 2, check the positions of their two occurrences. The distance between them must be at least 2 (i.e., indices differ by at least 2). Wait, the positions are 0-based or 1-based? Let's say the string is s. For a character c with two occurrences at indices i and j (i < j), then j -i must be \u22652. Because if they are adjacent (j =i+1), then the substring s[i..j] is \"cc\", which has counts 2 for c and 0 for others.",

If yes, then check the positions of the two c's. The two positions must not be adjacent. If any such c fails this, output NO. \n\nElse, output YES. So that's manageable. Now, how to code this. In program1.py, the code starts with: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nSo inside the loop, read the string s. Then, first, count the frequency. We can use a Counter for that. Then, check if any count >2 \u2192 output NO. Then, for each character in the Counter with count 2: \n\n   Check if the length of the set of characters is >1. If yes, then check the positions of the two occurrences. How to get the positions? We can precompute for each character the list of indices where it occurs. For example, for each c in s, store a list of indices. So for each c in the frequency dict: \n\n   if count[c] ==2: \n\n      indices = list of positions where c occurs. first = indices[0], second = indices[1]. if (second - first ==1) and (len(set(s))>1): \n\n          return NO. So that's the plan. Now, coding this. First, in the loop: \n\ns = input().strip() \n\nfrom collections import Counter \n\nfreq = Counter(s) \n\nfor c in freq: if freq[c]>2: \n\n        print(\"NO\") \n\n        break \n\nelse: \n\n    # all counts are <=2 \n\n    # now check the second condition \n\n    has_others = (len(freq) >1) \n\n    valid = True \n\n    for c in freq: \n\n        if freq[c] ==2: \n\n            indices = [i for i, ch in enumerate(s) if ch ==c] \n\n            if len(indices)!=2: \n\n                # shouldn't happen since freq is 2 \n\n                pass \n\n            first, second = indices \n\n            if (second - first ==1) and has_others: \n\n                valid = False \n\n                break \n\n    if valid: \n\n        print(\"YES\") \n\n    else: \n\n        print(\"NO\") Wait, but this could be optimized. But for the constraints given (sum of |s| up to 2e5), this should be okay. Wait, but for each character with count 2, we have to scan the entire string to find the indices. That would be O(n) per such character. Alternatively, we can precompute the indices for each character. Like: \n\npositions = defaultdict(list) \n\nfor idx, c in enumerate(s): \n\n    positions[c].append(idx) Then, for each c in positions: \n\nif len(positions[c]) ==2: \n\n   first, second = positions[c] \n\n   ... This would be O(n) for building the positions. So the code can be written as: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    s = input().strip() \n\n    from collections import defaultdict \n\n    freq = defaultdict(int) \n\n    pos = defaultdict(list) \n\n    for i, c in enumerate(s): \n\n        freq[c] +=1 \n\n        pos[c].append(i) # check frequencies \n\n    valid = True \n\n    for c in freq: if freq[c]>2: \n\n            valid = False \n\n            break \n\n    if not valid: \n\n        print(\"NO\") \n\n        continue \n\n    # check the second condition \n\n    has_others = (len(freq) >1) \n\n    for c in freq: \n\n        if freq[c] ==2: \n\n            indices = pos[c] \n\n            first, second = indices[0], indices[1] \n\n            if (second - first ==1) and has_others: \n\n                valid = False \n\n                break \n\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")",

But I'm not sure. The problem requires to find the minimal time. The code's approach seems to be based on the following idea: The time needed is determined by the maximum number of children a node has, but adjusted for the spreading process. The key idea might be that for a node with m children, the time required to infect all its children is ceil(m/2) + ... Alternatively, the minimal time is the ceiling of the maximum (ceil(c/2) for each node's children count). Wait, but the code's approach is more involved. The code's incomplete part is in the else clause of the binary search loop. The code has: \n\nelse: \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe correct code here should be L = mid. Because in binary search, when the current mid does not satisfy the condition (check returns False), we need to set L = mid +1? Or L = mid? \n\nWait, the loop is while R-L>1. Suppose the current mid is (L+R)//2. If check(mid) is False, then the required k must be larger than mid. So set L = mid. \n\nWait, let me think of the binary search structure. Initially, L is 0, R is the maximum of count. We want to find the minimal R such that check(R) is true. Wait, the code's check function returns True when the sum of (max(0, b[i] -k)) is <=k. \n\nThe binary search is trying to find the minimal k where this holds. Wait, the code's R is initialized to the maximum of count. The loop is trying to find the minimal R where check(R) is true. Wait, perhaps the code is using binary search to find the minimal k where check(k) is true. The initial L is 0, R is the maximum of count. The loop runs while R-L>1. At each step, mid is (L+R)//2. If check(mid) is true \u2192 we can try to find a smaller k \u2192 set R=mid. \n\nElse \u2192 set L=mid. Wait, but in the code's current code, the else clause (when check is false) is missing. So the missing code is L = mid. Therefore, the completion for program2.py is to add L = mid in the else clause. So the code's missing part is: \n\nelse: L = mid \n\nNow, moving to program3.py. The problem is to compute for each vertex i in a tree (with n odd), the number of trees where i is a centroid. A centroid is a vertex whose removal leaves all subtrees with size \u2264 (n-1)/2.

But the main missing part is the inv function. So the completion for program3.py is to fill in the inv function with the modular inverse using pow. Thus, the inv function should be: \n\ndef inv(x): \n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) So putting it all together. Now, compiling the answers for each program. Program1: The missing code is the code inside the for loop to check the conditions. Wait, the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. Looking back at program1.py's code: The code starts with: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe missing code is the entire block inside the loop. The code I wrote earlier is the completion. So the completion for program1 is the code inside the loop. Similarly for program2 and program3. So the final answers are: \n\nprogram1: The code inside the loop. program2: the missing line in the else clause of the binary search loop. program3: the inv function. So the JSON should be: \n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"\"\"\n    s = input().strip()\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int) pos = defaultdict(list)\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        freq[c] += 1\n        pos[c].append(i)\n    valid = True\n    for c in freq:\n        if freq[c] > 2:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    has_others = len(freq) > 1\n    for c in freq:\n        if freq[c] == 2:\n            indices = pos[c]\n            first, second = indices[0], indices[1]\n            if (second - first == 1) and has_others:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n    \"\"\",\n    \"program2\": \"\"\"\n    L = mid\n    \"\"\",\n    \"program3\": \"\"\"\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) \"\"\"\n}\n\nWait, but the code for program1 must be the code that replaces the TODO. Wait, the original program1's code is: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nSo the completion is the entire block inside the loop. The code I wrote earlier is the correct block. Similarly, program2's missing part is the line in the else clause of the binary search loop. The code in program2's solve function's binary search loop has: \n\nelse: \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe correct line is L = mid. For program3, the inv function is missing. The code's inv function is a TODO. So the completion for program3 is the inv function's code.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to determine if a string is perfectly balanced. The condition is that for every substring, the difference between any two characters' frequencies in that substring is at most 1. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me think about the examples given. \n\nThe first example, \"aba\" is okay. Let's see: any substring like \"a\", \"b\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\" all have frequencies where the difference between any two is at most 1. But \"abb\" fails because the substring \"bb\" has a's count 0 and b's 2, difference 2. \n\nSo the key is to check all possible substrings. But checking all substrings directly would be O(n^3) which is way too slow for n up to 2e5. That's impossible. So there must be a smarter way.\n\nWait, maybe the condition can be rephrased. For any substring, all characters present in it must have counts differing by at most 1. So, in any substring, the maximum frequency minus the minimum frequency (among the present characters) must be \u22641. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must have all characters appearing in a way that their counts are either equal or differ by 1. But that's not sufficient. For example, \"abac\" might have counts 2,1,1, but a substring like \"aa\" would have a difference of 2. So that's not enough. \n\nHmm, maybe the string must be such that all characters are in a sequence where they alternate. Like \"abcabca\" or something where no two same characters are adjacent except in a way that allows the condition. Wait, but even that might not be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the string can only have at most two different characters, and their counts differ by at most 1. Because if there are three different characters, then a substring containing all three would require each to have count 1, but maybe that's not possible. Wait, the example \"abc\" is allowed. Let's see: in \"abc\", any substring like \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"ab\", \"bc\", \"abc\" all have frequencies where the difference between any two present is at most 1. So that works. \n\nWait, but if the string has three different characters, then any substring that includes all three must have each appearing exactly once. So the entire string must be such that all characters are in a sequence where each new character alternates between the existing ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire string must be a permutation of a string where each character appears exactly once or twice, but arranged in a way that no two same characters are too close. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only possible perfectly balanced strings are those where all characters are the same (so any substring has all counts equal, so difference 0), or strings with exactly two different characters with counts differing by at most 1, arranged in an alternating fashion. Or maybe even three characters but arranged in a way that every substring has counts within 1. \n\nWait, the example \"abc\" is okay. Let's see: any substring of length 3 has all three, so each has count 1. Substrings of length 2 have two characters, each count 1. So that's okay. \n\nAnother example: \"abba\". Let's see substring \"bb\" has a's 0 and b's 2. The difference is 2, so that's invalid. So the string must not have two same characters in a row unless there's another character in between. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition can be rephrased as: the string must be such that between any two occurrences of the same character, there is at least one different character. Wait, but that might not be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the string must be such that for any two occurrences of the same character, the distance between them is at least the number of other characters present. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way this condition holds is if the string is a \"balanced\" sequence where each character alternates with others. For example, the string can be of the form a b a b ... or a b c a b c ... etc. \n\nWait, let's think of the necessary conditions. For any substring, the maximum and minimum counts of the characters present must differ by at most 1. \n\nSuppose the string has more than two distinct characters. Let's say three: a, b, c. Then, the entire string must have each character appearing exactly once, because otherwise, a substring containing two a's and no b or c would have a difference of 2. Wait, but in the example \"abc\", the entire string has each once, so that's okay. \n\nWait, but if the string is \"abca\", then the substring \"aa\" (if it exists) would be a problem. Wait, \"abca\" has two a's. The substring \"aa\" would have a difference of 2 between a and others (since others are 0). So that's invalid. So the string can't have any character appearing more than twice? Or maybe even two occurrences must be spaced properly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum frequency of any character in the entire string is at most 2. Because if a character appears three times, then the substring consisting of those three would have a count of 3 for that character and 0 for others, which would have a difference of 3. \n\nAh! That's a key insight. So for the entire string, each character can appear at most twice. Because otherwise, a substring consisting of three of the same character would fail. \n\nWait, but in the example \"aba\", the 'a' appears twice. The substring \"aa\" (if it existed) would be a problem, but in \"aba\", the a's are separated by a 'b', so there's no substring with two a's except the entire string? Wait, the substring \"aa\" isn't present. The substrings with two a's would be \"ab\" (a and b), \"ba\" (b and a), and the entire string. Wait, the entire string has two a's and one b. So the difference between a and b is 1, which is okay. \n\nSo the maximum frequency of any character in the entire string must be at most 2. Because if any character has frequency 3, then there exists a substring (the three occurrences) where that character's count is 3, and others are 0, which would have a difference of 3. \n\nSo first condition: all characters in the string must have frequency 1 or 2. \n\nSecond, even if that's true, we need to ensure that no two occurrences of the same character are adjacent. Because if two a's are adjacent, then the substring consisting of those two a's would have a count of 2 for a and 0 for others, so difference 2. Which is invalid. \n\nSo the two conditions are: \n\n1. Each character appears at most twice. \n\n2. No two same characters are adjacent. \n\nWait, but let's test this. \n\nTake \"aba\" which is valid. Each a appears twice, but they are not adjacent. So that's okay. \n\nAnother example: \"abba\" has two b's adjacent. The substring \"bb\" would have a difference of 2 between b and a (since a's count is 0 here). So that's invalid. \n\nAnother example: \"abc\" has each character once. So that's okay. \n\nAnother case: \"abac\". Each character appears once except a (twice). The a's are separated by b and c. So the substrings with two a's would be \"abac\" (counts a:2, others 1 each), which is okay. The substring \"aa\" doesn't exist. So that's okay. \n\nSo the two conditions are necessary. Are they sufficient? \n\nSuppose a string meets both conditions. Let's see if any substring would satisfy the condition. \n\nTake any substring. Let's say it has some characters. For any two characters in the substring, their counts can differ by at most 1. \n\nSuppose in the substring, a character appears twice. Then, since in the original string, those two are not adjacent, so between them there are other characters. So in the substring, the two a's are separated by at least one other character. \n\nWait, but in the substring, maybe they are adjacent? Like if the substring is \"aa\" but in the original string they are not adjacent. Wait, but the original string can't have two a's adjacent, so the substring can't have two a's adjacent either. So the two a's in the substring must be separated by at least one other character. \n\nWait, but the substring could be \"a...a\" with other characters in between. So in that substring, the count of a is 2, and other characters have counts at least 1. So the difference between a and any other character in the substring would be 1 (since others have at least 1). \n\nWait, but suppose the substring is \"a\" followed by another a with some other characters in between. For example, in \"abac\", the substring \"abac\" has a's count 2, b and c count 1 each. So the difference between a and others is 1. \n\nAnother case: a substring that includes one a and one b. Their counts are 1 each, so difference 0. \n\nAnother case: a substring with only one character. Then, the difference between that and any other character (which has 0) is 1, which is okay. \n\nWait, but the problem states that u and v are characters present in s. Wait, the problem says \"for all possible triplets (t,u,v) such that t is a substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\". Wait, so even if u or v are not present in the substring t, but are present in s, then the difference between their frequencies in t is considered. \n\nOh! That's a crucial point. \n\nWait, the problem says that u and v are characters present in s (the entire string), but not necessarily in the substring t. \n\nSo for example, if the entire string has three characters a, b, c, but a substring t has only a and b, then for u = a and v = c (which is present in s but not in t), the difference between their frequencies in t is (count of a) - 0 = count of a. Which must be \u22641. \n\nWait, so in that case, the count of a in t must be \u22641. Because the difference between a and c (which is 0 in t) must be \u22641. \n\nSo this complicates things. \n\nSo the problem requires that for any substring t, and any two characters u and v present in the entire string s, the absolute difference between their counts in t is at most 1. \n\nWait, that's a much stricter condition. \n\nSo even if a character is not present in the substring, but exists in s, then the difference between its count (0) and another character's count in the substring must be \u22641. \n\nSo for example, if the substring has two a's, then for any other character v present in s (but not in the substring), the difference between a's count (2) and v's (0) is 2, which is over the limit. \n\nTherefore, the substring cannot have any character appearing more than once. \n\nWait, that's a big realization. \n\nBecause if any character appears twice in a substring, then for any other character present in s but not in that substring, the difference between the two counts (2 and 0) would be 2, which violates the condition. \n\nTherefore, the only way this can be satisfied is that every substring has all characters present in it appearing exactly once. \n\nWait, but that's impossible unless the entire string is of length 1. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the entire string has all characters appearing exactly once. Then any substring is a subset of those characters, so each character in the substring appears once. So for any two characters in s, if they are both in the substring, their counts are 1, difference 0. If one is in the substring and the other isn't, the difference is 1 (since one is 1, the other 0). So that's okay. \n\nSo a string with all unique characters (each appearing once) is okay. \n\nAnother case: if the entire string has two characters, each appearing once. Then same as above. \n\nBut if the entire string has a character appearing twice, then any substring that includes both instances of that character would have that character's count as 2. Then, for any other character present in s but not in that substring, the difference between 2 and 0 is 2, which is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the only way the condition holds is that every character in the entire string appears exactly once. \n\nWait, that can't be right because the first example given is \"aba\", which has two a's. \n\nWait, the first example says \"aba\" is perfectly balanced. Let me check that. \n\nIn \"aba\", the entire string has a:2, b:1. \n\nTake the substring \"aba\". The characters present are a and b. \n\nFor u = a and v = b: difference is 1 (2-1=1). \n\nFor u = a and v = any other character not present in s? Wait, the problem says u and v are characters present in s. Since s is \"aba\", the only characters are a and b. \n\nSo in the substring \"aba\", the difference between a and b is 1, which is okay. \n\nNow consider a substring like \"aa\" \u2014 but that doesn't exist in \"aba\". \n\nWait, the substring \"ab\" has a and b each once. \n\nThe substring \"ba\" same. \n\nThe substring \"a\" (first character) has a count 1. For u = a and v = b (present in s but not in the substring), the difference is 1-0 =1, which is okay. \n\nThe substring \"aa\" doesn't exist. \n\nWait, but in \"aba\", the two a's are separated by a b. So the substring \"a\" (the first a) and \"a\" (the third a) are not adjacent. \n\nWait, but the substring from first to third character is \"aba\", which includes both a's. \n\nIn that substring, the a count is 2, and b is 1. \n\nThe difference between a and b is 1, which is okay. \n\nBut what about a substring that includes both a's and excludes the b? \n\nWait, can such a substring exist? \n\nThe substring from first to third character is \"aba\", which includes the b. \n\nThe substring from first to second is \"ab\", which includes the first a and the b. \n\nThe substring from second to third is \"ba\", which includes the second a and the b. \n\nThe only way to have a substring with two a's is the entire string. \n\nIn that case, the difference between a and b is 1, which is okay. \n\nBut what about a substring that has two a's and no b? \n\nThat can't exist in \"aba\", so it's okay. \n\nAh, so the key is that whenever a character appears twice in the entire string, any substring that includes both must also include at least one other character. \n\nWait, so in \"aba\", the two a's are separated by a b, so any substring that includes both a's must also include the b. \n\nTherefore, in such a substring, the count of a is 2, and the count of b is 1. The difference between a and b is 1, which is okay. \n\nBut for any other character present in s (but there are none), the difference would be 2-0, but since there are no other characters, that's not an issue. \n\nSo the problem's condition is satisfied. \n\nSo the problem's condition requires that for any two occurrences of the same character in the string, there must be at least one other character between them. \n\nAdditionally, the entire string can't have any character appearing more than twice. \n\nWait, but if a character appears three times, then there must be two instances with no other characters between them? Or not? \n\nWait, if a character appears three times, then between the first and third occurrence, there must be at least one other character. But between the first and second, there must also be at least one other character. \n\nWait, but if a character appears three times, then the first and second must be separated by at least one other character, and the second and third must also be separated by at least one other character. \n\nBut then the total length would be at least 1 (first a) + 1 (other) + 1 (second a) + 1 (other) + 1 (third a) \u2192 total 5 characters. \n\nBut even so, the substring from first to third a would include those three a's and the other characters. The count of a would be 3, and the other characters would have counts at least 2. \n\nWait, let's see: suppose the string is \"a x a y a\". The substring from first to last a is \"a x a y a\". The count of a is 3, and x and y each 1. \n\nThen, for u = a and v = x, the difference is 3-1 = 2, which is over the limit. \n\nSo that's invalid. \n\nTherefore, any character can appear at most twice. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n1. Each character appears at most twice. \n\n2. Any two occurrences of the same character are separated by at least one different character. \n\nAdditionally, for any substring that includes two occurrences of a character, it must also include at least one other character. \n\nWait, but how do we ensure that? \n\nThe first two conditions ensure that. Because if two occurrences are separated by at least one other character, then any substring that includes both must include that other character. \n\nSo the two conditions are necessary and sufficient. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm can be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Check that all characters in s have frequency 1 or 2. \n\n- For each character that appears twice, check that the two occurrences are not adjacent. \n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES, else NO. \n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently. \n\nFirst, for the frequency check: \n\nWe can count the frequency of each character. If any has count >2 \u2192 no. \n\nThen, for each character with count 2, check the positions of their two occurrences. The distance between them must be at least 2 (i.e., indices differ by at least 2). \n\nWait, the positions are 0-based or 1-based? Let's say the string is s. For a character c with two occurrences at indices i and j (i < j), then j -i must be \u22652. \n\nBecause if they are adjacent (j =i+1), then the substring s[i..j] is \"cc\", which has counts 2 for c and 0 for others. Then, for any other character present in s (but not in this substring), the difference between c's count (2) and that character's (0) would be 2, which is invalid. \n\nWait, but if the other character is not present in the entire string, then it's okay. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that for all u and v present in s. So if the entire string has only c, then the two occurrences can be adjacent? \n\nWait, if the entire string is \"aa\", then the substring \"aa\" has counts a:2. Since there are no other characters in s, the only possible pairs are (a,a), which difference is 0. So that would be okay? \n\nWait, the problem says \"for all possible triplets (t,u,v) such that t is a substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\". \n\nIf s is \"aa\", then the only characters present are a. So u and v must both be a. The difference between their counts is zero. So it's okay. \n\nSo in that case, the two a's can be adjacent. \n\nAh! So the second condition (separated by at least one other character) is only required when there are other characters in the string. \n\nWait, this complicates things. \n\nHmm, so the problem's condition is that for any substring t, and any two characters u and v present in s (regardless of whether they are in t), the difference between their counts in t must be \u22641. \n\nSo in the case of s being \"aa\", the substring \"aa\" has counts a:2. Since there are no other characters in s, the only possible pairs are (a,a), which is okay. \n\nSo \"aa\" would be considered perfectly balanced. \n\nBut according to the first example, \"aba\" is okay. \n\nWait, but in \"aa\", the substring \"aa\" has a count of 2. For any other characters in s (there are none), so no problem. \n\nSo the two conditions are: \n\n1. All characters have frequency \u22642. \n\n2. For any two occurrences of the same character, if there exists another character in the entire string, then the two occurrences must be separated by at least one other character. \n\nWait, that's a bit more complex. \n\nAlternatively, the second condition can be rephrased as: \n\nFor any character c that appears twice, and if there exists another character in the string, then the two occurrences of c must not be adjacent. \n\nBecause if there are other characters, then the substring consisting of the two c's (if they are adjacent) would have a count of 2 for c and 0 for others. The difference between c and any other character (which exists in s) would be 2, which is invalid. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nCheck for each test case: \n\n- All characters have count \u22642. \n\n- For every character c with count 2: \n\n   - If there exists at least one other character in the string, then the two occurrences of c must not be adjacent. \n\n   - If the string is composed of only c (count 2), then it's okay. \n\nSo how to implement this. \n\nFirst, for each test case: \n\nRead the string s. \n\nCompute the frequency of each character. \n\nCheck if any frequency exceeds 2 \u2192 if yes, output NO. \n\nElse, for each character c with frequency 2: \n\n   Check if there are other characters (i.e., the total number of distinct characters is more than 1). \n\n   If yes, then check the positions of the two c's. \n\n   The two positions must not be adjacent. \n\n   If any such c fails this, output NO. \n\nElse, output YES. \n\nSo that's manageable. \n\nNow, how to code this. \n\nIn program1.py, the code starts with: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nSo inside the loop, read the string s. \n\nThen, first, count the frequency. \n\nWe can use a Counter for that. \n\nThen, check if any count >2 \u2192 output NO. \n\nThen, for each character in the Counter with count 2: \n\n   Check if the length of the set of characters is >1. \n\n   If yes, then check the positions of the two occurrences. \n\n   How to get the positions? \n\nWe can precompute for each character the list of indices where it occurs. \n\nFor example, for each c in s, store a list of indices. \n\nSo for each c in the frequency dict: \n\n   if count[c] ==2: \n\n      indices = list of positions where c occurs. \n\n      first = indices[0], second = indices[1]. \n\n      if (second - first ==1) and (len(set(s))>1): \n\n          return NO. \n\nSo that's the plan. \n\nNow, coding this. \n\nFirst, in the loop: \n\ns = input().strip() \n\nfrom collections import Counter \n\nfreq = Counter(s) \n\nfor c in freq: \n\n    if freq[c]>2: \n\n        print(\"NO\") \n\n        break \n\nelse: \n\n    # all counts are <=2 \n\n    # now check the second condition \n\n    has_others = (len(freq) >1) \n\n    valid = True \n\n    for c in freq: \n\n        if freq[c] ==2: \n\n            indices = [i for i, ch in enumerate(s) if ch ==c] \n\n            if len(indices)!=2: \n\n                # shouldn't happen since freq is 2 \n\n                pass \n\n            first, second = indices \n\n            if (second - first ==1) and has_others: \n\n                valid = False \n\n                break \n\n    if valid: \n\n        print(\"YES\") \n\n    else: \n\n        print(\"NO\") \n\nWait, but this could be optimized. \n\nBut for the constraints given (sum of |s| up to 2e5), this should be okay. \n\nWait, but for each character with count 2, we have to scan the entire string to find the indices. That would be O(n) per such character. \n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the indices for each character. \n\nLike: \n\npositions = defaultdict(list) \n\nfor idx, c in enumerate(s): \n\n    positions[c].append(idx) \n\nThen, for each c in positions: \n\nif len(positions[c]) ==2: \n\n   first, second = positions[c] \n\n   ... \n\nThis would be O(n) for building the positions. \n\nSo the code can be written as: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    s = input().strip() \n\n    from collections import defaultdict \n\n    freq = defaultdict(int) \n\n    pos = defaultdict(list) \n\n    for i, c in enumerate(s): \n\n        freq[c] +=1 \n\n        pos[c].append(i) \n\n    # check frequencies \n\n    valid = True \n\n    for c in freq: \n\n        if freq[c]>2: \n\n            valid = False \n\n            break \n\n    if not valid: \n\n        print(\"NO\") \n\n        continue \n\n    # check the second condition \n\n    has_others = (len(freq) >1) \n\n    for c in freq: \n\n        if freq[c] ==2: \n\n            indices = pos[c] \n\n            first, second = indices[0], indices[1] \n\n            if (second - first ==1) and has_others: \n\n                valid = False \n\n                break \n\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\") \n\nWait, but in the case where the string is \"aa\", then has_others is False (since only one character), so even if the two a's are adjacent, it's okay. \n\nYes. \n\nThis should handle all cases. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. \n\nThe problem is about infecting a tree in minimal time. \n\nThe process is each second: \n\n1. Spreading: for each vertex v, if any child of v is infected, you can infect at most one other child of v. \n\n2. Then, you can choose any healthy vertex to infect (injection). \n\nWe need to find the minimal number of seconds to infect all. \n\nHmm, the approach in the given code seems to be using some kind of BFS or level-based approach. \n\nLooking at the code provided: \n\nThe code reads the input, and for each test case, the solve function is called with a list a (the parents). \n\nThe code uses a counter to count the number of nodes at each level? \n\nWait, the code has: \n\ndef solve(a): \n\n    for ai in a: \n\n        counter[ai] +=1 \n\n    count = list(counter.values()) \n\n    count.sort() \n\n    for i in range(num_level): \n\n        count[i] = max(count[i] - i -2, 0) \n\n    L =0; R = max(count) \n\n    if R ==0: \n\n        return num_level +1 \n\n    ... \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of children at each level. \n\nWait, the problem's input is given as p_2 ... p_n, where p_i is the parent of i. \n\nThe root is 1. \n\nThe code is probably building a tree and then calculating the number of children per level. \n\nWait, the code's solve function is passed a list a which is the list of parents (excluding the root). \n\nWait, in the code's main loop: \n\nfor a in [*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    counter.clear() \n\n    res = solve(a.split()) \n\n    print(res) \n\nWait, the input is read as lines. The first line is t, then each test case has n followed by the p_2 ... p_n. \n\nThe code is taking every second line starting from the second line (since [2::2] would be the lines after the first test case's n). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is not correctly parsing the input. \n\nBut the problem is to complete the code. \n\nLooking at the code's solve function: \n\nThe code is trying to compute something related to the number of children per level. \n\nThe initial code for solve(a) loops over ai in a (the parents of nodes 2..n). \n\nThe counter is a defaultdict(int). \n\nSo for each parent ai, it increments counter[ai]. \n\nWait, that counts the number of children each node has. \n\nBecause for each node i (from 2 to n), its parent is ai. So the number of children of ai is the count in counter. \n\nSo the count list is the list of the number of children each node has. \n\nWait, but the code then sorts the count. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to model the problem as layers and find the minimal time. \n\nThe problem requires that each second, during spreading, for each node v, if any child is infected, you can infect one more child. \n\nThe injection step allows choosing any healthy node to infect. \n\nThe minimal time is the minimal number of steps required. \n\nThe approach in the code seems to be considering the maximum number of children in any node's subtree, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal time is determined by the maximum number of children a node has, but adjusted for some constraints. \n\nThe code's solve function is trying to compute this. \n\nLooking at the code's incomplete part: \n\nIn the binary search part: \n\nwhile R - L >1: \n\n    mid = (R + L)//2 \n\n    if check(mid): \n\n        R = mid \n\n    else: \n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\nProbably, the missing code is L = mid. \n\nBecause in binary search, if the check fails, you need to increase the lower bound. \n\nSo the line should be L = mid. \n\nWait, the code's check function is probably checking if a certain value mid is sufficient. \n\nThe code's check function: \n\ndef check(k): \n\n    b = count.copy() \n\n    for i in range(len(b)): \n\n        b[i] = max(b[i] -k, 0) \n\n    if sum(b) <=k: \n\n        return True \n\n    return False \n\nHmm, the count array is sorted. \n\nWait, the code's count array is the list of the number of children per node, sorted. \n\nWait, the code first sorts the count array. \n\nThen, for each element in count, it subtracts (i + 2) and takes max(0, ...). \n\nWait, the code's line: \n\ncount[i] = max(count[i] - i -2, 0) \n\nThis is done for each i in 0..num_level-1. \n\nWait, perhaps the count array after this step represents some residual values that need to be handled. \n\nThe code then does a binary search between L and R. \n\nThe initial R is the maximum of the count array. \n\nThe check function takes a k and subtracts k from each element of the count array, then sums the remaining. \n\nIf the sum is <=k, then it's possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the minimal k such that the sum over (max(0, c_i -k)) <=k. \n\nWait, the code's approach is to compute the required time as the minimal k where this holds. \n\nThe code's final return is num_level +1 + R. \n\nWait, the initial code's solve function returns num_level +1 + R. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThe problem requires to find the minimal time. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be based on the following idea: \n\nThe time needed is determined by the maximum number of children a node has, but adjusted for the spreading process. \n\nThe key idea might be that for a node with m children, the time required to infect all its children is ceil(m/2) + ... \n\nAlternatively, the minimal time is the ceiling of the maximum (ceil(c/2) for each node's children count). \n\nWait, but the code's approach is more involved. \n\nThe code's incomplete part is in the else clause of the binary search loop. \n\nThe code has: \n\nelse: \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe correct code here should be L = mid. \n\nBecause in binary search, when the current mid does not satisfy the condition (check returns False), we need to set L = mid +1? Or L = mid? \n\nWait, the loop is while R-L>1. \n\nSuppose the current mid is (L+R)//2. \n\nIf check(mid) is False, then the required k must be larger than mid. So set L = mid. \n\nWait, let me think of the binary search structure. \n\nInitially, L is 0, R is the maximum of count. \n\nWe want to find the minimal R such that check(R) is true. \n\nWait, the code's check function returns True when the sum of (max(0, b[i] -k)) is <=k. \n\nThe binary search is trying to find the minimal k where this holds. \n\nWait, the code's R is initialized to the maximum of count. \n\nThe loop is trying to find the minimal R where check(R) is true. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using binary search to find the minimal k where check(k) is true. \n\nThe initial L is 0, R is the maximum of count. \n\nThe loop runs while R-L>1. \n\nAt each step, mid is (L+R)//2. \n\nIf check(mid) is true \u2192 we can try to find a smaller k \u2192 set R=mid. \n\nElse \u2192 set L=mid. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the else clause (when check is false) is missing. \n\nSo the missing code is L = mid. \n\nTherefore, the completion for program2.py is to add L = mid in the else clause. \n\nSo the code's missing part is: \n\nelse: \n\n    L = mid \n\nNow, moving to program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to compute for each vertex i in a tree (with n odd), the number of trees where i is a centroid. \n\nA centroid is a vertex whose removal leaves all subtrees with size \u2264 (n-1)/2. \n\nThe input is n (odd), and the output is n numbers. \n\nThe code provided has some functions for combinatorics modulo 998244353. \n\nLooking at the code: \n\nThe code starts by defining modmul and inv (inverse). \n\nThen precomputes fact and invfact arrays up to MAX (1e6). \n\nThen defines comb and invcomb functions. \n\nThe inv function is incomplete. \n\nThe code's inv function is supposed to compute the modular inverse of x mod MOD. \n\nThe code's inv function is a TODO. \n\nThe code's inv function can be implemented using Fermat's little theorem since MOD is prime. \n\nThe inverse of x mod MOD is pow(x, MOD-2, MOD). \n\nSo the inv function should be: \n\ndef inv(x): \n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) \n\nThat's the first missing part. \n\nNext, looking at the code's main part: \n\nThe code reads n, then initializes out as [0]*n. \n\nThen loops over i in range((n+1)//2). \n\nWait, the loop is for i in range((n+1)//2). \n\nThen, base is fact[n-1]. \n\nfrac is modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)). \n\nWait, the code's comb and invcomb functions are defined as: \n\ncomb(x,y) returns modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y])) \n\ninvcomb(x,y) returns modmul(fact[y], modmul(fact[x-y], invfact[x])) \n\nWait, the code's comb function is the standard combination formula C(x,y) mod MOD. \n\nThe invcomb function is 1/C(x,y) mod MOD. \n\nWait, the code's invcomb is defined as modmul(fact[y], modmul(fact[x-y], invfact[x])) \n\nWhich is (y! * (x-y)! ) / x! \u2192 which is 1/C(x,y). \n\nSo the code's frac is C(n//2, i) * invcomb(n-1, i) \u2192 which is [C(n//2, i) * ( (i! (n-1 -i)! ) / (n-1)! ) ) ] mod MOD. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nThe code then computes out[i] = modmul(base, frac). \n\nThen, there's a rem variable and some loop to compute the final out array. \n\nThe code's logic is unclear, but the problem requires to compute for each vertex i the number of trees where it is a centroid. \n\nThe code's approach might be based on some combinatorial formula. \n\nThe first missing part is the inv function. \n\nThe second missing part is perhaps in the loop for the rem variable. \n\nWait, looking at the code's incomplete part: \n\nThe code has: \n\nfor i in range((n + 1) // 2): \n\n    base = fact[n - 1] \n\n    frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i)) \n\n    out[i] = modmul(base, frac) \n\nThen, rem is initialized to 0. \n\nThen, for i in range(n-1, -1, -1): \n\n    oldrem = rem \n\n    rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i)) \n\n    out[i] -= oldrem \n\n    rem %= MOD \n\n    out[i] %= MOD \n\nWait, the invs function is defined as modmul(fact[x-1], invfact[x]). \n\nWhich is (x-1)! * inv(x!) \u2192 which is 1/x. \n\nWait, invs(x) = 1/x mod MOD. \n\nBecause invfact[x] is 1/x! mod MOD. \n\nSo fact[x-1] * invfact[x] = (x-1)! * (1/x!) ) = 1/x. \n\nSo invs(x) is 1/x mod MOD. \n\nThe code's rem loop is doing some kind of inclusion-exclusion or correction. \n\nBut the main missing part is the inv function. \n\nSo the completion for program3.py is to fill in the inv function with the modular inverse using pow. \n\nThus, the inv function should be: \n\ndef inv(x): \n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) \n\nSo putting it all together. \n\nNow, compiling the answers for each program. \n\nProgram1: The missing code is the code inside the for loop to check the conditions. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says to output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\nLooking back at program1.py's code: \n\nThe code starts with: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe missing code is the entire block inside the loop. \n\nThe code I wrote earlier is the completion. \n\nSo the completion for program1 is the code inside the loop. \n\nSimilarly for program2 and program3. \n\nSo the final answers are: \n\nprogram1: \n\nThe code inside the loop. \n\nprogram2: the missing line in the else clause of the binary search loop. \n\nprogram3: the inv function. \n\nSo the JSON should be: \n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"\"\"\n    s = input().strip()\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    pos = defaultdict(list)\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        freq[c] += 1\n        pos[c].append(i)\n    valid = True\n    for c in freq:\n        if freq[c] > 2:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    if not valid:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    has_others = len(freq) > 1\n    for c in freq:\n        if freq[c] == 2:\n            indices = pos[c]\n            first, second = indices[0], indices[1]\n            if (second - first == 1) and has_others:\n                valid = False\n                break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n    \"\"\",\n    \"program2\": \"\"\"\n    L = mid\n    \"\"\",\n    \"program3\": \"\"\"\n    def inv(x):\n        return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nWait, but the code for program1 must be the code that replaces the TODO. \n\nWait, the original program1's code is: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nSo the completion is the entire block inside the loop. \n\nThe code I wrote earlier is the correct block. \n\nSimilarly, program2's missing part is the line in the else clause of the binary search loop. \n\nThe code in program2's solve function's binary search loop has: \n\nelse: \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe correct line is L = mid. \n\nFor program3, the inv function is missing. \n\nThe code's inv function is a TODO. \n\nSo the completion for program3 is the inv function's code. \n\nThus, the JSON should have those three parts. \n\nBut the user requires the output to be in JSON format with the keys as program1, program2, program3, and the values are the code completions. \n\nThe code for program1 is the entire block inside the loop. \n\nThe code for program2 is the line \"L = mid\" in the else clause. \n\nThe code for program3 is the inv function's definition. \n\nSo the final answer is as above. \n\nWait, but in program3's code, the inv function is inside the code's initial part. \n\nThe code provided for program3 has: \n\ndef inv(x): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nSo the completion is the line inside the inv function. \n\nThus, the completion for program3 is the line: \n\nreturn pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) \n\nSo the inv function's code is: \n\ndef inv(x): \n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) \n\nHence, the program3's completion is the line inside the inv function. \n\nSo the JSON entries are: \n\nprogram3's completion is \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\" \n\nWait, but the user says to output the missing code, not the entire function. \n\nThe original code for program3's inv function is: \n\ndef inv(x): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nSo the missing part is the return statement. \n\nHence, the completion for program3 is the line \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\". \n\nSo the JSON entries are: \n\nprogram1: the entire code block inside the loop. \n\nprogram2: the line \"L = mid\" \n\nprogram3: the line \"return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\" \n\nThus, the final JSON is: \n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    s = input().strip()\\n    from collections import defaultdict\\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\\n    pos = defaultdict(list)\\n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\\n        freq[c] += 1\\n        pos[c].append(i)\\n    valid = True\\n    for c in freq:\\n        if freq[c] > 2:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    if not valid:\\n        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        continue\\n    has_others = len(freq) > 1\\n    for c in freq:\\n        if freq[c] == 2:\\n            indices = pos[c]\\n            first, second = indices[0], indices[1]\\n            if (second -
