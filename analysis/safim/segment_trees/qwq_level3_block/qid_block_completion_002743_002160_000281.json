Hmm, so this approach would give 26, but the correct answer is 31. So that approach is wrong. Hmm, so my previous reasoning was incorrect. Wait, the first example's input is s = \"11010\" (the first example's first input?), but the example's explanation says choosing the substrings 11010 (26) and 101 (5) gives OR 31.

Wait, the third character is the third from the left, which is the third bit (since the first is the highest). Wait, the string is \"11010\", so the bits are: Position 4: 1 (first character)\n\n3: 1 (second)\n\n2: 0 (third)\n\n1: 1 (fourth)\n\n0: 0 (fifth?) Wait, the fifth character is the last, which is 0.

Hmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the maximum possible OR by considering all possible substrings that start with a '1', and track the maximum value. Alternatively, the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits present in any of the substrings. To compute this, we can track for each bit whether it is set in any substring. The maximum possible OR is the OR of all bits that are set in any substring. To compute this, we can iterate through the string and track the current OR. Wait, here's an idea: \n\nInitialize max_or to 0. We can keep track of all possible current ORs as we process each character. Wait, perhaps the following approach: \n\nInitialize current_or to 0. For each character in the string:\n\n   current_or = (current_or << 1) | (current_char == '1')\n\n   max_or |= current_or \n\nThis way, current_or is the value of the current prefix.",

Ah! So the OR of all prefixes gives the correct answer of 31. Ah! So the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible prefixes. Because any substring can be part of a prefix or suffix, but the prefixes cover all possible starting points. Wait, but what about substrings that are not prefixes? For example, the substring '101' in the first example is not a prefix, but its value is 5 (101), which has bit 2 set. The OR of all prefixes includes that bit because the third prefix (110) has a value of 6 (110), which has bit 2 set. Wait, the third prefix is '110', which is 6 (110), so bit 2 is set. So the OR of all prefixes would include that bit. The fourth prefix is '1101' (13 \u2192 1101), which has bit 3 set. The fifth prefix is 26 (11010), which has bits 4,3,1,0. The OR of all prefixes would be 26 | 13 |6 |3 |1 \u2192 let's compute step by step:\n\nStart with 0. After first prefix (1): OR is 1.\n\nSecond prefix (3): OR is 3.\n\nThird (6): OR is 3 |6 = 7 (0111). Fourth (13 \u2192 1101): 7 |13 = 15 (1111). Fifth (26 \u2192 11010): 15 |26 = 31 (11111). Yes! So the OR of all prefixes gives the correct answer. So the approach is to compute the OR of all prefixes. This can be done in O(n) time. The code in program2.py currently has a loop for i in 1 to 7, but that's probably not the right approach. The correct code would be to compute the OR of all prefixes. The initial code has s1 = int(s,2), which is the value of the entire string. But the correct approach is to compute the OR of all prefixes. So the code should be:\n\nInitialize current = 0 and max_or =0. Then, for each character in s:\n\n   current = current * 2 + (char == '1')\n\n   max_or |= current \n\nThen, the result is max_or. So the code in program2.py should replace the loop with this. The given code has a loop for i in range(1,8), which is probably a wrong approach. The correct code would be:\n\ncurrent = 0\n\nmax_or =0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    current = current *2 + (c == '1')\n\n    max_or |= current \n\nres = max_or Then, print bin(res)[2:]. So the missing code in program2.py's loop is not needed.",

The conditions for a non-degenerate triangle are that the sum of any two sides must exceed the third. The note says that for the triple (0,3,5), the XORs are 3,6,5. The conditions are 3+6>5 (9>5 yes), 3+5>6 (8>6 yes), 6+5>3 (11>3 yes). The problem requires counting all such triples modulo 998244353.

The code loops over each character in s (converted to integers), and for each bit, updates the dp array. The code has a TODO in the elif (k & i) ==0: part. The code's structure is a bit unclear. The problem's note says that the answer for n=5 (binary 101) is 12. The code's approach seems to be using a bitmask DP. The DP array is of size 8, and the transitions involve some transformation. The TRANS array is [6,3,7,4,1,0]. Hmm, perhaps the DP is tracking some state related to the bits of a, b, c.

But this seems difficult to handle directly. The problem's note says that the triple (a,b,c) must satisfy that the three XORs form a valid triangle. The code's approach seems to use a dynamic programming approach where the state is a bitmask of some properties. The DP array is of size 8 (so states 0-7). The TRANS array has 6 elements. The code's initial dp is set to [0]*7 + [1], so the initial state is 7 (since index 7 is 1). The loop over each bit of s (the binary digits) processes each bit from left to right. The code's DP transitions are based on the current bit and the transitions in TRANS. The TODO is in the else clause (when c is 0) and when (k & i) ==0. The code's current line for the else case (c is 0) is:\n\nelif (k & i) ==0:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code's current code for the else (c is 0) part has a loop over k in TRANS, and for each, if (k & i) ==0, then do something. The code's current line for the c=0 case is:\n\nelif (k & i) ==0:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each c in the binary digits:\n\n    dp1 is initialized to 0s. for i in 0..7:\n\n        for k in TRANS:\n\n            if c is 1:\n\n                dp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\n            else:\n\n                if (k & i) ==0:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n    then dp is updated to dp1 modulo MOD. Hmm, perhaps the code is trying to model the bits of a, b, c in some way. The TRANS array is [6,3,7,4,1,0]. The code's DP is likely tracking some state related to the bits of a, b, c up to the current bit. The missing code in the else case (c is 0) and (k & i) ==0 is probably adding to dp1[k & i] or something similar. Wait, the code for the c=1 case is adding to dp1[k & i]. For c=0, perhaps when (k & i) is 0, then we can add to dp1[k & i] (which is 0) but that might not be correct. Alternatively, the code's logic for c=0 is that when the current bit is 0, then the transition can only be taken if the new state's bit is 0. Alternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[k & i] += dp[i]\n\nBut why the condition (k & i) ==0? Wait, perhaps the code is trying to model the bits of a, b, c such that the current bit is 0.",

Alternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[0] += dp[i] But this is just a guess. Alternatively, the code's logic for c=0 is that the current bit must be 0, so the new state must have the current bit as 0. The k & i represents the new state's bit. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to track the state of the current bit in a, b, c. The TRANS array might represent possible transitions for the next bit. The code's initial state is 7 (binary 111), which might represent that all bits are set. The code's DP is likely tracking the state of the current bit's possible values for a, b, c. The missing line is probably adding to dp1[0], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[0] += dp[i] But this is just a guess. Alternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nBut only when (k & i) is 0. Wait, the condition is (k & i) ==0, so the new state would be 0.

Alternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nBecause when c is 0, the current bit must be 0, so the new state's bit must be 0. Thus, the code for the else case (c is 0) would be:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nBut only when (k & i) ==0. Wait, the condition is (k & i) ==0, so the new state's bit is 0. Thus, the code should add to dp1[0] the value of dp[i]. But the code's current line for c=1 is adding to dp1[ (k & i) ] which could be any value. Hmm, this is quite unclear. Alternatively, the code's missing line is the same as the c=1 case, but only when (k & i) is 0. Thus, the code should have:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nBut since (k & i) is 0, this would add to dp1[0]. Thus, the missing line is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nSo the code's TODO should be filled with that line. Therefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nThus, the code for the else case (c is 0) and (k & i) ==0 is to add to dp1 at the position (k & i) the current dp[i]. So the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nThus, the three missing parts are:\n\nFor program1.py: the missing line is a1.append(pai).",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the maximum possible bitwise AND of the XORs of corresponding elements after reordering array b. The code provided seems to be trying a bit-based approach. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nIn the solve function, there's a loop over each bit from 30 down to 0. For each bit k, they split the current partitions of a and b indices into a0/a1 and b0/b1 based on whether the bit is set. The idea is probably to decide for each bit whether it can be set in the final result. \n\nLooking at the code's TODO in the a's loop: for the a array, when a[pai] has the k-th bit set, it should go to a1. The current code has a0 for when the bit is 0, else the TODO. So the missing line is probably appending to a1. So the code should be:\n\nelse: a1.append(pai)\n\nThen, after splitting, the code checks if the number of a0 elements equals the number of b1 elements. If so, they set the res bit and proceed. Wait, the logic here is a bit unclear. The current code's condition is len(a0) == len(b1). If that's true, then maybe we can pair a0 with b1 (since their XOR would have the k-th bit set, since a0 has 0 and b1 has 1, so XOR is 1). But since the AND of all c_i needs to have this bit set, we need all c_i's to have this bit set. So to maximize the AND, we want as many bits as possible set. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is greedy: for each bit from highest to lowest, decide whether it can be set in the result. To set this bit, we need that in every pair (a_i, b_j), the XOR has this bit set. So for each bit k, we need that for all pairs, a_i's k-th bit XOR b_j's k-th bit is 1. \n\nWait, but how do we arrange the pairs so that for all pairs, the XOR has the k-th bit set? That requires that for each a_i, the corresponding b_j's bit is the opposite of a_i's. So for each a_i, if a_i has bit k set, then the paired b_j must not have it, or vice versa. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of a's with bit k set (call this cnt_a1) plus the number without (cnt_a0) must be such that when paired with b's bits, the XOR's bits can all be 1. \n\nWait, to have all c_i's have the k-th bit set, the XOR of a_i and b_j must have that bit set. So for each pair, either a_i has the bit and b_j doesn't, or vice versa. \n\nSo for all pairs, the a and b elements must be in such a way that their bits at k are different. \n\nThe total number of a's with bit k set is cnt_a1, and those without is cnt_a0. Similarly for b's bits, cnt_b1 and cnt_b0. \n\nTo have all pairs have differing bits, the possible pairings are: a0 with b1, and a1 with b0. The counts must satisfy that the number of a0's equals the number of b1's, and the number of a1's equals the number of b0's. Because then, each a0 can pair with a b1, and each a1 with a b0. \n\nWait, but the total a0 + a1 = n, and b0 + b1 = n. So if a0 = b1 and a1 = b0, then that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, if a0 + a1 = n, and b0 + b1 = n, then the condition a0 = b1 and a1 = b0 must hold. \n\nSo for the current bit k, if the current partitions (from previous bits) can be split such that this is possible, then we can set the bit in the result. \n\nThe code in the problem1's solve function is trying to track possible partitions. The initial ps is a list of possible (a_partitions, b_partitions) pairs. \n\nWait, the code starts with ps as [(list(range(n)), list(range(n)))]. So initially, all a indices are in the first partition, and all b indices in the second. \n\nThen, for each bit k, they split the current partitions into a0/a1 and b0/b1. \n\nThe code then checks if len(a0) == len(b1). If so, then this bit can be set. \n\nWait, the code's logic here is a bit unclear. Let me see:\n\nIn the code, after splitting a into a0 and a1 (based on whether a's bit is 0 or 1), and similarly for b into b0 and b1, the code checks if len(a0) == len(b1). \n\nIf that's true, then the code sets res |= (1 <<k), but the line is written as res = res & (res | (1 <<k)), which is redundant because res | (1<<k) is at least as big as res, so the AND would just be res | (1<<k). Wait, maybe that's a typo. The original code has:\n\nres = (1<<30) -1 initially. Then, for each bit, if the condition is met, they do res = res & (res | (1<<k)), which is equivalent to res | (1<<k). Because res | (1<<k) is the OR, and then AND with res would leave it as the OR. So that line is effectively setting the bit if possible. \n\nWait, but the code's logic here is a bit confusing. Let me think again. \n\nThe code's approach is trying to track possible partitions of a and b indices such that the current bit can be set. \n\nThe code's next_ps is built by considering possible splits. \n\nIf the condition len(a0) == len(b1) holds, then this bit can be set. Because then, pairing a0 with b1 (each has opposite bits) and a1 with b0 (also opposite) would give all XORs having the bit set. \n\nSo in that case, the bit can be set, so we add (a0, b1) and (a1, b0) to next_ps. \n\nWait, but the code's next_ps is appending (a0, b1) and (a1, b0) only if their lengths are non-zero. \n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif len(a0) == len(b1):\n\n    res = res & (res | (1 <<k))  # which is res | (1<<k)\n\n    if len(a0) >0 and len(b1) >0: next_ps.append( (a0, b1) )\n\n    if len(a1) >0 and len(b0) >0: next_ps.append( (a1, b0) )\n\nElse, the bit cannot be set, so res is cleared for that bit, and next_ps is the same as previous? \n\nWait, else part:\n\nelse:\n\n    res = res & ~(1 <<k)\n\n    next_ps.append( (pa, pb) )\n\nWait, but in the else case, the current partitions can't be split to allow this bit to be set. So the next_ps is just the original partition, but the bit is not set. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track possible partitions that can still allow the remaining bits to be set. \n\nThe problem is that the code's logic may have some errors. But the user's code has a TODO in the a's loop. The missing line is the else part for a's loop. \n\nLooking back at the code for the a loop:\n\nfor pai in pa:\n\n    if a[pai] & (1<<k) ==0: a0.append(pai)\n\n    else: # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the else case is when the a's bit is set. So the code should append to a1. \n\nSo the missing line is a1.append(pai). \n\nThat's the first part. \n\nNow, moving to program2.py. The problem is to choose two substrings of a binary string, compute their integer values, and find the maximum OR of those two, then output in binary. \n\nThe code given starts by reading n and s, then s1 is the integer of the entire string. The initial res is set to that. Then there's a loop for i in 1 to 7 (since 1 to 8?), but the code is incomplete. \n\nThe approach here is probably to find the maximum possible OR. The maximum possible OR would be achieved by taking the two largest possible numbers from the string. Since OR is maximized when the bits are set, the best is to take the two longest possible substrings starting with 1, preferably the entire string. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of the entire string (as a number) with itself, which would just be the same number. But maybe there's a way to get a higher value by combining two different substrings. \n\nWait, the maximum possible OR would be the OR of the two largest possible numbers in the string. The largest possible number is the entire string. So the maximum OR is that number. But perhaps there's a case where two different substrings can set different bits. \n\nWait, for example, if the string is '101', the entire string is 5 (101). But if you take '10' (2) and '1' (1), their OR is 3, which is less than 5. So the maximum is indeed the entire string. \n\nWait, but maybe if the string has leading 1s and some 0s, but another substring can set higher bits. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible bits in the string. Because if any bit is set in any substring, it can be included in the OR. \n\nWait, the OR of two numbers can have a bit set if either of the numbers has that bit set. So the maximum possible OR is the bitwise OR of all possible bits present in any substring. \n\nBut how to compute that? \n\nThe maximum possible OR is the bitwise OR of all possible substrings. But since any substring can be chosen, the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. Wait, no. For example, the string '101' has bits at positions 0, 2. The OR of all possible substrings would include all bits present in any substring. \n\nWait, the maximum possible OR is the OR of the entire string's value and the maximum possible other substring. But perhaps the best way is to take the two substrings that each have the highest possible bits. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of the maximum possible number in the string and the second maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. Because if any bit is set in any position in the string, then there exists a substring that includes that bit, so the OR can have that bit set. \n\nWait, for example, if the string is '101', the maximum OR would be 5 (the entire string) OR any other substring. But 5 is already the maximum possible. \n\nWait, but if the string is '1001', the entire string is 9. But if you take the first '1' (1) and the last '1' (1), their OR is 1, but the entire string is 9. So the maximum is 9. \n\nHmm, so the maximum possible OR is the maximum possible value of a single substring, since OR-ing with another can't exceed that. Wait, no. Wait, if you have two numbers, their OR can be larger than either. For example, if the string is '1010', the entire string is 10 (1010). But if you take '101' (5) and '010' (2), their OR is 7 (111), which is higher than 10? Wait no, 10 is 1010 (binary), which is 10 in decimal. 7 is 0111, which is smaller. Wait, no, 10 is 1010 (binary) which is 10 decimal. 1010 OR 0111 would be 1111 (15). Wait, but how to get that? \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum OR is the OR of the two largest possible numbers. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. Because any bit set in the string can be part of at least one substring, so the OR can have all those bits set. \n\nWait, for example, in the string '101', the bits set are 2 and 0. The OR of the entire string (5) and the substring '10' (2) gives 5 | 2 = 7 (111), which includes all bits present in the string. \n\nWait, but the entire string is 5 (101), which already has those bits. So the maximum OR is 5. \n\nHmm, maybe the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible bits in the entire string. Because any bit present in the string can be included in at least one substring, so the OR can have all those bits set. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. \n\nWait, how to compute that? \n\nThe OR of all possible substrings would be the same as the OR of all the prefixes. Because the first occurrence of a bit in the string can be part of a prefix. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the numbers formed by the prefixes. \n\nWait, let me think of the example given in the first note: the first example's input is '11010' and '101', but the example's explanation says choosing those two gives 26 |5 = 31 (11111). The entire string is '11010' which is 26, but the maximum OR is 31. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So the entire string's value is 26 (11010), but the maximum OR is 31. \n\nAh, so the maximum is not just the maximum single substring. \n\nWait, in that example, the two substrings chosen are '11010' (26) and '101' (5). Their OR is 26 |5 = 27? Wait no, 26 is 11010, 5 is 00101. OR is 11111 (31). Oh right, so the two substrings together set all the bits from 0 to 4. \n\nSo the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits present in the entire string. \n\nWait, the entire string is '11010', which has bits 4,3,1,0 set. The substring '101' (the last three characters?) gives bits 2,0,1? Wait, maybe the example's first substring is the entire string (11010) which is 26 (binary 11010), and the second is 101 (binary 101 which is 5). The OR is 11010 | 00101 = 11111 (31). \n\nSo the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits present in the entire string. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible OR is the bitwise OR of all the bits in the entire string. \n\nSo to compute this, we can compute the OR of all possible prefixes. Because each time a new bit is set, it contributes to the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. \n\nWait, the entire string's bits are all the bits present in any position. So the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. \n\nWait, but how to compute that? \n\nThe maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. \n\nWait, the bits present in the entire string are all the bits that are set in any position. So the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. \n\nWait, for example, in the first example, the entire string is '11010', which has bits 4,3,1,0. The substring '101' (the last three characters) has bits 2,1,0. So the OR of the two substrings includes bits 4,3,2,1,0, which is 31. \n\nSo the maximum OR is indeed the OR of all the bits present in the entire string. \n\nTherefore, the approach is to compute the OR of all the bits in the entire string. \n\nTo compute this, we can iterate through each bit position in the string and track whether it's set anywhere. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the value of the entire string's OR with all possible substrings. But that's equivalent to the OR of all the bits in the string. \n\nWait, the OR of all possible substrings would be the same as the OR of all the bits in the string. Because any bit that is set in the string can be part of some substring. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits in the entire string. \n\nSo how to compute that? \n\nWe can compute the OR of all the prefixes. Because each time a new bit is set, it contributes to the maximum. \n\nWait, let's see. Let's process the string from left to right, keeping track of the current OR. \n\nInitialize current_or to 0. \n\nFor each character in the string:\n\n   current_or = (current_or << 1) | (current_char == '1')\n\n   max_or |= current_or\n\nWait, no. Wait, the current_or here would be the value of the current prefix. \n\nWait, for example, the first character is '1', so current_or is 1. The max_or is 1. \n\nNext character is '1', so current_or becomes 3 (11), so max_or is 3. \n\nThird character is '0', current_or becomes 6 (110), max_or is 6. \n\nFourth is '1', current becomes 13 (1101), max_or 13. \n\nFifth is '0', current becomes 26 (11010), so max_or is 26. \n\nBut in the first example, the maximum OR is 31. \n\nHmm, so this approach would give 26, but the correct answer is 31. \n\nSo that approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so my previous reasoning was incorrect. \n\nWait, the first example's input is s = \"11010\" (the first example's first input?), but the example's explanation says choosing the substrings 11010 (26) and 101 (5) gives OR 31. \n\nThe bits set in 31 are all 5 bits (since 31 is 11111). \n\nSo the entire string has bits 4,3,1,0. The substring '101' (the last three characters?) gives bits 2,1,0. So combining those two gives all bits up to 4. \n\nSo the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits present in any substring. \n\nWait, the bits present in the entire string are 4,3,1,0. The substring '101' (the last three characters) has bits 2,1,0. So the OR of all possible bits in any substring would be 4,3,2,1,0. \n\nSo the maximum OR is 31. \n\nTherefore, the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits present in any position in the string. \n\nSo to compute this, we can track for each bit whether it's present in the string. \n\nWait, but the bits in the string are the bits in each position. For example, the first character is the highest bit. \n\nWait, the string is a binary string, so each character is a bit. The first character is the most significant bit. \n\nWait, the string is given as s, so for example, \"11010\" is 11010 in binary, which is 26. \n\nBut the bits present in the entire string are the bits that are set in any position. \n\nWait, the first character is the leftmost, so the bits are from highest to lowest. \n\nWait, the bits present in the entire string are all the bits that are set in any of the characters. \n\nWait, for example, in the first example's string \"11010\", the bits set are positions 4 (the first '1'), 3 (second '1'), 1 (fourth '1'), and 0 (last '0'? No, the last character is 0, so the bits are positions 4,3,1,0? Wait, the string is 5 characters, so the bits are positions 4 down to 0. \n\nWait, the first character is the 4th bit (since 2^4 is 16). \n\nSo the bits set in the entire string are 4,3,1,0. \n\nThe substring '101' (the last three characters: '0','1','0')? Wait, maybe the substring is the third, fourth, fifth characters: '0','1','0'? No, that would be 010 which is 2. \n\nWait, perhaps the substring '101' is the third, fourth, fifth characters? \n\nWait, the example's first substring is 11010 (the entire string), and the second is 101 (maybe the substring starting at position 1 (0-based?), so characters 1,2,3: '1','0','1'? \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits present in the entire string. \n\nWait, in the first example, the maximum OR is 31 (11111), which requires that all bits from 0 to 4 are set. \n\nBut the original string has bits 4,3,1,0 set. The missing bit is 2. \n\nAh, so the substring '101' (the third, fourth, fifth characters?) would have the third character (position 2) as '0'? \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum OR is the OR of all possible bits in the entire string. \n\nWait, the example's answer is 31, which requires that all bits from 0 to 4 are set. \n\nSo the string must have a '1' in the third position (bit 2). \n\nLooking at the first example's input: the first example's input is probably \"11010\", which is 5 bits. The third character (index 2) is '0', so that bit is not set. \n\nHmm, so how does the example get the bit 2 set? \n\nWait, maybe the second substring is a different part. \n\nWait, the example says the second substring is 101. Let's see: the string is \"11010\". The substring \"101\" could be the second, third, fourth characters: '1','0','1'? \n\nWait, the second character is '1', third is '0', fourth is '1'? \n\nYes, that would be '101', which is 5 (101). \n\nSo the bits set in that substring are bits 2 (from the first '1' in the substring?), wait, the substring '101' is three bits, so the first bit is the highest (bit 2 in the substring's own value). \n\nWait, the value of '101' is 5 (101 in binary), which has bits 2 and 0 set. \n\nSo the OR of 26 (11010) and 5 (00101) is 11111 (31), which has all bits up to 4 set. \n\nAh, so the 4th bit (from the first substring) and the 2nd bit (from the second substring) are both set. \n\nSo the maximum OR is the combination of all bits set in any of the two substrings. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits present in any substring. \n\nTo compute this, we can track for each bit whether it is present in the string. \n\nWait, but the bits in the string are the bits in each position. For example, the first character is the highest bit. \n\nWait, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits present in the entire string. Because any bit that is set in the string can be part of a substring. \n\nWait, in the first example, the string has a '0' in the third position (bit 2). So that bit is not set in the entire string. But the example's answer includes that bit. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, the first example's input must be different. Let me recheck the problem's first example note:\n\n\"In the first example, you can choose the substrings 11010 and 101. f(s1)=26, f(s2)=5, their OR is 31 (binary 11111).\"\n\nAh, the second substring is '101', which is 5 (binary 101). The bits set are 2 and 0. \n\nThe first substring is 26 (binary 11010), which has bits 4,3,1,0. \n\nThe OR of 26 and 5 is 31 (binary 11111), which has bits 4,3,2,1,0. \n\nSo the bit 2 comes from the second substring. \n\nBut the original string is '11010', which has a '0' in the third position (bit 2). \n\nWait, the third character is the third from the left, which is the third bit (since the first is the highest). \n\nWait, the string is \"11010\", so the bits are:\n\nPosition 4: 1 (first character)\n\n3: 1 (second)\n\n2: 0 (third)\n\n1: 1 (fourth)\n\n0: 0 (fifth?)\n\nWait, the fifth character is the last, which is 0. \n\nWait, the third character is the third from the left, which is the third bit (counting from 0 starting at the right). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the bit positions. Let me clarify:\n\nThe string \"11010\" is 5 characters long. The first character is the most significant bit (bit 4), then bit 3, 2, 1, 0. \n\nSo the third character (index 2) is the third bit (bit 2), which is 0. \n\nSo the entire string does not have bit 2 set. \n\nBut the substring '101' (the second, third, fourth characters: '1','0','1') would be '101', which is 5 (binary 101). The third character in the substring is the '1' at position 4 in the original string? \n\nWait, the substring '101' is the second, third, fourth characters of the original string. \n\nThe second character is '1' (bit 3), third is '0' (bit 2), fourth is '1' (bit 1). \n\nSo the substring '101' is the bits 3,2,1? \n\nWait, the substring's value is computed as a binary number. The first character of the substring is the most significant bit. \n\nSo the substring '101' (characters 1,2,3 in 0-based indices) would be '1' (bit 2 of the substring's value), '0' (bit 1), '1' (bit 0). So the value is 5 (101). \n\nThe bits set in this substring are bits 2 and 0 of the substring's own value, but in the original string's bits, the third character (bit 2) is 0. \n\nWait, but the substring's value's bits are independent of their positions in the original string. \n\nAh, right! The value of a substring is the binary number formed by its characters, so the bits in the substring's value are not tied to their positions in the original string. \n\nTherefore, the maximum OR can include bits that are not present in the original string's higher bits. \n\nSo the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible bits that can be set in any substring. \n\nTo find this, we need to find the maximum possible OR of any two numbers formed by any two substrings. \n\nThe maximum possible OR would be the maximum possible value achievable by any two numbers from the substrings. \n\nThe best way to maximize the OR is to have as many high bits set as possible. \n\nThe maximum possible OR is the OR of the two largest possible numbers in the string. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of the maximum possible number and the second maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits that can be set in any substring. \n\nWait, the maximum possible OR can be as high as 2^m -1, where m is the length of the string. \n\nFor example, if the string is all 1's, then the maximum OR is 2^m -1. \n\nSo how to compute this? \n\nThe approach is to find all possible bits that can be set in any substring. \n\nEach bit position in the binary number can be set if there exists a substring that has that bit set. \n\nThe maximum OR is the OR of all such bits. \n\nTo find this, we can track for each bit position (from 0 to the maximum possible in the string) whether it can be set in any substring. \n\nThe maximum possible bit is the length of the string minus 1. \n\nFor each bit position k (starting from 0 as the least significant), we can check if there's a substring that has a 1 in the k-th bit of its value. \n\nWait, but how to do this efficiently? \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the possible numbers formed by the substrings. \n\nThe maximum possible OR is the maximum possible value of a single substring, OR with another substring's maximum. \n\nWait, but the maximum single substring is the entire string. So the maximum OR would be the maximum between the entire string's value OR with any other substring's value. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum OR is the OR of the entire string and the second largest possible substring. \n\nHmm, but this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of the two largest possible numbers in the string. \n\nSo the approach is to find the two largest numbers in all possible substrings and compute their OR. \n\nBut for large n (like 1e6), enumerating all substrings is impossible. \n\nSo we need an O(n) or O(n^2) approach, but for n=1e6, O(n^2) is impossible. \n\nWait, the problem's note says that for test cases 21-40, n is 1e6, so the code must be O(n) or O(n log n). \n\nThe code given in program2.py starts with s1 = int('0b' + s, 2), which is the entire string's value. Then res is initialized to that. \n\nThen there's a loop for i in 1 to 7 (since range(1,8) gives 1-7). The code is incomplete. \n\nThe code's current approach is probably trying to find other substrings that can contribute higher bits. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to consider all possible prefixes and suffixes. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum OR can be obtained by taking the entire string (max possible number) and the next best possible number. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum OR is the OR of the entire string and the maximum possible number from the remaining parts. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of the entire string and the maximum possible number formed by any substring that has a 1 in a higher bit than the entire string. \n\nWait, but the entire string is the maximum possible number. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the maximum possible OR by considering all possible substrings that start with a '1', and track the maximum value. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum OR is the OR of all the bits present in any of the substrings. \n\nTo compute this, we can track for each bit whether it is set in any substring. \n\nThe maximum possible OR is the OR of all bits that are set in any substring. \n\nTo compute this, we can iterate through the string and track the current OR. \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nInitialize max_or to 0. \n\nWe can keep track of all possible current ORs as we process each character. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach: \n\nInitialize current_or to 0. \n\nFor each character in the string:\n\n   current_or = (current_or << 1) | (current_char == '1')\n\n   max_or |= current_or \n\nThis way, current_or is the value of the current prefix. \n\nThe max_or will be the maximum between all prefixes. \n\nBut in the first example, this would give 26 (the entire string's value), but the correct answer is 31. \n\nHmm, so that approach is insufficient. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe maximum OR can be obtained by taking two substrings that together cover all the 1's in the string. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible OR is the OR of all the bits that are set in any position of the string. \n\nWait, the bits in the string are the individual bits of each character. \n\nWait, the bits in the entire string are the bits of each character. For example, the string '11010' has bits set at positions 4,3,1,0. \n\nThe maximum OR can't have a bit set that isn't present in any of the characters. \n\nWait, no. Because a substring can have a bit set that is not present in the original string's bits. \n\nWait, no. The bits in a substring's value are determined by the bits in the substring. \n\nWait, for example, the substring '101' in the first example has a bit 2 set (since its value is 5, which is 101 in binary). The original string's third character is 0, but the substring's third character (the middle '0') is part of a different position in the substring's value. \n\nAh, right! The bits in the substring's value are not tied to their positions in the original string. \n\nSo the maximum possible OR can have bits set up to the length of the longest substring. \n\nWait, the maximum possible value of a substring is the value of the entire string. \n\nThe second substring can be any other substring, but their OR can have bits set in any position up to the maximum possible length. \n\nWait, the maximum possible OR is the OR of the two largest possible numbers. \n\nThe largest possible number is the entire string. The second largest could be the entire string minus the first character, or another large substring. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum OR is the OR of the entire string and the second largest possible substring. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nAnother idea: the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible bits that can be set in any substring. \n\nTo find this, for each bit position k (from 0 to the maximum possible in the string), check if there exists a substring where the k-th bit is set. \n\nThe maximum OR is the OR of all such bits. \n\nTo compute this, for each bit position k, determine if there's a substring where the k-th bit is set. \n\nThe maximum possible bit is the length of the string minus 1. \n\nFor example, in the first example, the string is 5 characters long, so the maximum bit is 4. \n\nThe first example's answer includes bit 2 (since 31 has all bits up to 4 set). \n\nSo how to check if bit k is set in any substring? \n\nA bit k is set in a substring's value if the substring has a '1' in the (k+1)-th position from the end. \n\nWait, the substring's value is a binary number. The k-th bit (starting from 0) is set if there's a '1' in the (k+1)th position from the right in the substring. \n\nSo for a substring of length L, the maximum bit it can have is L-1. \n\nTo have bit k set in some substring, there must exist a substring of length at least k+1, and in that substring, the (k+1)th character from the end is '1'. \n\nAlternatively, for each bit position k, we can check if there exists a '1' in the string such that there are at least k+1 characters to the right (or left?) of it. \n\nWait, perhaps for each position in the string, the bits that can be set in a substring including that '1' are up to the length of the substring. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible numbers formed by all possible prefixes. \n\nWait, let's think of the following: \n\nThe maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible prefixes. \n\nBecause each new prefix adds new bits. \n\nWait, let's see for the first example: \n\nThe prefixes are:\n\n'1' \u2192 1 (bit 0)\n\n'11' \u2192 3 (bits 0 and 1)\n\n'110' \u21926 (bits 1 and 2)\n\n'1101' \u219213 (bits 0, 2, 3)\n\n'11010' \u219226 (bits 0,1,3,4)\n\nThe OR of all these is 26 | 13 |6 |3 |1 \u2192 26 |13 is 27, then 27 |6 is 30, then 30 |3 is 31, then 31 |1 is still 31. \n\nAh! So the OR of all prefixes gives the correct answer of 31. \n\nAh! So the maximum possible OR is the OR of all possible prefixes. \n\nBecause any substring can be part of a prefix or suffix, but the prefixes cover all possible starting points. \n\nWait, but what about substrings that are not prefixes? \n\nFor example, the substring '101' in the first example is not a prefix, but its value is 5 (101), which has bit 2 set. \n\nThe OR of all prefixes includes that bit because the third prefix (110) has a value of 6 (110), which has bit 2 set. \n\nWait, the third prefix is '110', which is 6 (110), so bit 2 is set. \n\nSo the OR of all prefixes would include that bit. \n\nThe fourth prefix is '1101' (13 \u2192 1101), which has bit 3 set. \n\nThe fifth prefix is 26 (11010), which has bits 4,3,1,0. \n\nThe OR of all prefixes would be 26 | 13 |6 |3 |1 \u2192 let's compute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nAfter first prefix (1): OR is 1.\n\nSecond prefix (3): OR is 3.\n\nThird (6): OR is 3 |6 = 7 (0111).\n\nFourth (13 \u2192 1101): 7 |13 = 15 (1111).\n\nFifth (26 \u2192 11010): 15 |26 = 31 (11111). \n\nYes! So the OR of all prefixes gives the correct answer. \n\nSo the approach is to compute the OR of all prefixes. \n\nThis can be done in O(n) time. \n\nThe code in program2.py currently has a loop for i in 1 to 7, but that's probably not the right approach. \n\nThe correct code would be to compute the OR of all prefixes. \n\nThe initial code has s1 = int(s,2), which is the value of the entire string. \n\nBut the correct approach is to compute the OR of all prefixes. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nInitialize current = 0 and max_or =0. \n\nThen, for each character in s:\n\n   current = current * 2 + (char == '1')\n\n   max_or |= current \n\nThen, the result is max_or. \n\nSo the code in program2.py should replace the loop with this. \n\nThe given code has a loop for i in range(1,8), which is probably a wrong approach. \n\nThe correct code would be:\n\ncurrent = 0\n\nmax_or =0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    current = current *2 + (c == '1')\n\n    max_or |= current \n\nres = max_or \n\nThen, print bin(res)[2:]. \n\nSo the missing code in program2.py's loop is not needed. The entire loop is wrong and should be replaced. \n\nBut the user's code has a loop for i in 1 to 7, which is probably a placeholder. \n\nThe correct code would replace the for loop with the above approach. \n\nSo the code for program2.py should be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ncurrent = 0\n\nmax_or = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    current = current * 2 + (1 if c == '1' else 0)\n\n    max_or |= current\n\nprint(bin(max_or)[2:])\n\nBut the original code has a loop for i in 1 to 8, which is probably a mistake. \n\nSo the missing code in program2.py is to replace the loop with the above code. \n\nBut the user's code has a TODO in the for loop. \n\nWait, the code given for program2.py is:\n\nfor i in range(1,8):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the user's code is incomplete here. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the OR of all prefixes, so the loop is not needed. \n\nTherefore, the code should remove the loop and replace it with the current/max_or approach. \n\nBut since the user's code has a loop there, perhaps the intended approach is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to consider all possible pairs of substrings. \n\nAlternatively, the code's initial approach is to compute the maximum possible OR by considering all possible pairs of substrings. \n\nBut for large n (like 1e6), this is impossible. \n\nHence, the correct approach is to compute the OR of all prefixes. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program2.py is to replace the loop with the code that computes the OR of all prefixes. \n\nBut since the user's code has a loop there, perhaps the code is structured differently. \n\nAlternatively, the code's initial approach is to compute the maximum possible OR by considering all possible starting points for the second substring. \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is to compute the maximum OR between the entire string and other substrings. \n\nBut I think the correct solution is to compute the OR of all prefixes. \n\nSo the code for program2.py should be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ncurrent = 0\n\nmax_or = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    current = current * 2 + (c == '1')\n\n    max_or |= current\n\nprint(bin(max_or)[2:])\n\nThus, the missing code in program2.py is to replace the loop with this code. \n\nNow, moving to program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to count the number of triples (a,b,c) with 0 \u2264 a,b,c \u2264n such that the XORs a^b, b^c, a^c form the sides of a non-degenerate triangle. \n\nThe conditions for a non-degenerate triangle are that the sum of any two sides must exceed the third. \n\nThe note says that for the triple (0,3,5), the XORs are 3,6,5. \n\nThe conditions are 3+6>5 (9>5 yes), 3+5>6 (8>6 yes), 6+5>3 (11>3 yes). \n\nThe problem requires counting all such triples modulo 998244353. \n\nThe input is the binary string of n. \n\nThe code provided uses a dynamic programming approach. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code reads the binary string s, then initializes a dp array. \n\nThe code loops over each character in s (converted to integers), and for each bit, updates the dp array. \n\nThe code has a TODO in the elif (k & i) ==0: part. \n\nThe code's structure is a bit unclear. \n\nThe problem's note says that the answer for n=5 (binary 101) is 12. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be using a bitmask DP. \n\nThe DP array is of size 8, and the transitions involve some transformation. \n\nThe TRANS array is [6,3,7,4,1,0]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the DP is tracking some state related to the bits of a, b, c. \n\nThe code's loop for each character in the binary string (c in map(int, s)):\n\nfor each current state i in 0..7:\n\n   for each transition k in TRANS:\n\n      if c is 1:\n\n          dp1[k & i] += dp[i]\n\n      else:\n\n          if (k & i) ==0:\n\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code's logic is unclear. \n\nThe problem requires counting triples (a,b,c) such that the three XORs form a valid triangle. \n\nThe XORs are x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. \n\nNote that x^y = a^b ^ b^c = a^c = z. \n\nSo the three XORs are related. \n\nThe conditions for a valid triangle are x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z >x. \n\nBut since x, y, z are all positive, the three conditions are equivalent to the sum of any two being greater than the third. \n\nAlternatively, the necessary and sufficient condition is that the sum of the smallest two is greater than the largest. \n\nBut how to express this in terms of the XORs? \n\nAlternatively, note that the three XORs must satisfy x + y > z, etc. \n\nBut since x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. \n\nWe can express the conditions in terms of a, b, c. \n\nAlternatively, note that x + y > z can be written as (a^b) + (b^c) > (a^c). \n\nBut this seems difficult to handle directly. \n\nThe problem's note says that the triple (a,b,c) must satisfy that the three XORs form a valid triangle. \n\nThe code's approach seems to use a dynamic programming approach where the state is a bitmask of some properties. \n\nThe DP array is of size 8 (so states 0-7). \n\nThe TRANS array has 6 elements. \n\nThe code's initial dp is set to [0]*7 + [1], so the initial state is 7 (since index 7 is 1). \n\nThe loop over each bit of s (the binary digits) processes each bit from left to right. \n\nThe code's DP transitions are based on the current bit and the transitions in TRANS. \n\nThe TODO is in the else clause (when c is 0) and when (k & i) ==0. \n\nThe code's current line for the else case (c is 0) is:\n\nelif (k & i) ==0:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code's current code for the else (c is 0) part has a loop over k in TRANS, and for each, if (k & i) ==0, then do something. \n\nThe code's current line for the c=0 case is:\n\nelif (k & i) ==0:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each c in the binary digits:\n\n    dp1 is initialized to 0s.\n\n    for i in 0..7:\n\n        for k in TRANS:\n\n            if c is 1:\n\n                dp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\n            else:\n\n                if (k & i) ==0:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n    then dp is updated to dp1 modulo MOD.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model the bits of a, b, c in some way. \n\nThe TRANS array is [6,3,7,4,1,0]. \n\nThe code's DP is likely tracking some state related to the bits of a, b, c up to the current bit. \n\nThe missing code in the else case (c is 0) and (k & i) ==0 is probably adding to dp1[k & i] or something similar. \n\nWait, the code for the c=1 case is adding to dp1[k & i]. \n\nFor c=0, perhaps when (k & i) is 0, then we can add to dp1[k & i] (which is 0) but that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic for c=0 is that when the current bit is 0, then the transition can only be taken if the new state's bit is 0. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[k & i] += dp[i]\n\nBut why the condition (k & i) ==0? \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to model the bits of a, b, c such that the current bit is 0. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is that when the current bit of n is 0, then the bits of a, b, c must be such that the current bit is 0. \n\nThe code's DP is likely tracking the state of the bits of a, b, c up to the current position. \n\nThe TRANS array might represent possible transitions for the next bit. \n\nThe code's missing line is probably adding to dp1[0] or something else. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing line is the same as the c=1 case, but only when (k & i) is 0. \n\nWait, the code's current code for c=0 is:\n\nelif (k & i) ==0:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the code's structure is:\n\nfor each k in TRANS:\n\n    if c is 1:\n\n        dp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\n    else:\n\n        if (k & i) ==0:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code is only adding to dp1 when (k & i) is 0 when c is 0. \n\nThe missing line is probably adding to dp1[0] or something else. \n\nAlternatively, the code should add to dp1[0], but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[0] += dp[i]\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic for c=0 is that the current bit must be 0, so the new state must have the current bit as 0. \n\nThe k & i represents the new state's bit. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the state of the current bit in a, b, c. \n\nThe TRANS array might represent possible transitions for the next bit. \n\nThe code's initial state is 7 (binary 111), which might represent that all bits are set. \n\nThe code's DP is likely tracking the state of the current bit's possible values for a, b, c. \n\nThe missing line is probably adding to dp1[0], but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[0] += dp[i]\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nBut only when (k & i) is 0. \n\nWait, the condition is (k & i) ==0, so the new state would be 0. \n\nSo the code should add to dp1[0] the value of dp[i]. \n\nThus, the missing line is:\n\ndp1[0] += dp[i]\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nBecause when c is 0, the current bit must be 0, so the new state's bit must be 0. \n\nThus, the code for the else case (c is 0) would be:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nBut only when (k & i) ==0. \n\nWait, the condition is (k & i) ==0, so the new state's bit is 0. \n\nThus, the code should add to dp1[0] the value of dp[i]. \n\nBut the code's current line for c=1 is adding to dp1[ (k & i) ] which could be any value. \n\nHmm, this is quite unclear. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing line is the same as the c=1 case, but only when (k & i) is 0. \n\nThus, the code should have:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nBut since (k & i) is 0, this would add to dp1[0]. \n\nThus, the missing line is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nSo the code's TODO should be filled with that line. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program3.py is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nThus, the code for the else case (c is 0) and (k & i) ==0 is to add to dp1 at the position (k & i) the current dp[i]. \n\nSo the code's missing line is:\n\ndp1[ (k & i) ] += dp[i]\n\nThus, the three missing parts are:\n\nFor program1.py: the missing line is a1.append(pai).\n\nFor program2.py: the code should replace the loop with the prefix OR approach. But since the user's code has a loop there, perhaps the correct code is to compute the OR of all prefixes. \n\nWait, the user's code for program2.py has:\n\nfor i in range(1,8):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe correct approach is to compute the OR of all prefixes, so the loop is not needed. \n\nBut the user's code requires filling the missing code in the loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to consider all possible pairs of substrings of length up to 7, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, the code's initial approach is to compute the maximum possible OR by considering all possible pairs of substrings of length up to 7, but that's not feasible for large n. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is a mistake and the correct code is to compute the OR of all prefixes. \n\nBut the user's instructions say to output only the missing code, not the entire program. \n\nThe user's code for program2.py has a loop for i in 1 to 7, and the TODO is inside that loop. \n\nBut
