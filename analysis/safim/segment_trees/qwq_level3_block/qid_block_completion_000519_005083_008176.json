The sum of the first x elements is S = prices[x-1]. The sum of the first (x - y) elements is prices[x - y -1], assuming x - y >=0. So the sum of the last y elements would be S - prices[x - y -1]. Wait, let's see. For example, x=5, y=2. The first 5 elements sum to prices[4]. The first 3 elements (5-2=3) sum to prices[2]. So the last two elements (positions 3 and 4) sum to prices[4] - prices[2] = (10+9+8+7+6) - (10+9+8) = 40 - 27 = 13, which matches the example. So the formula for the sum when given x and y is: if x == y, then all x items are free, so the sum is the sum of the first x elements (since all are taken). But when x>y, then it's the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements, which is prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1]. So in the code, the TODO part is when xy[0] != xy[1]. So in that case, x is the first element, y the second. So the code should compute:\n\nsum = prices[x-1] - (prices[x - y -1] if (x - y) >0 else 0) Wait, but when x - y is 0, then x - y -1 is -1, which would be invalid. So when x - y ==0, that means y =x, so the sum is prices[x-1], which is handled by the if condition. But in the else block, since x>y, so x - y is at least 1. Wait, no, the condition is if (xy[0] == xy[1]). So in the else block, x is not equal to y, but since y <=x, so y can be less than x. So in that case, the formula is correct. So the code should be:\n\nif x_i == y_i: then the sum is prices[x_i-1]\n\nelse:\n\nsum = prices[x_i -1] - (prices[x_i - y_i -1] if (x_i - y_i) > =1 else 0) Wait, but when x_i - y_i is 0, then x_i = y_i, but that's already handled by the if condition. So in the else block, since x_i > y_i, so x_i - y_i is at least 1. So the code can safely do:\n\nsum_val = prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1] Wait, let me see:\n\nSuppose x=5, y=2. x - y is 3, so x - y -1 is 2. So prices[4] - prices[2] = 40 -27 =13, which is correct. Another example: in the first sample input given in the problem's note, the first query is x=3, y=2. The first 3 items (sorted in reverse) are 5,5,3. The sum of the first 3 is 13. The first (3-2)=1 elements sum to 5. So 13-5=8, which matches the note's example. So the code in the else block should be:\n\nans_val = prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0] - xy[1] -1]\n\nBut need to make sure that xy[0] - xy[1] -1 is >=0. Since xy[0] > xy[1], so xy[0] - xy[1] is at least 1, so subtracting 1 gives 0 or more. So in the code, the TODO part is:\n\nans_val = prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0] - xy[1] -1]\n\nThen append that to ans. So the code in the else block would be:\n\nelse:\n\n    x = xy[0]\n\n    y = xy[1]\n\n    ans.append( prices[x-1] - prices[ x - y -1 ] )",

Wait, the modmul function is defined as modmul(x, y, c=0) returns (x*y +c) mod MOD. So when building fact, for each i from 1 to MAX-1, fact[i] = modmul(i, fact[i-1]). Which is equivalent to (i * fact[i-1]) mod MOD. So that's correct for factorial mod MOD. The invfact array is initialized with invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1]). Then for i from MAX-2 down to 0, invfact[i] = modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1]). Since invfact[i] = inv(fact[i]) mod MOD. Because fact[i] = fact[i+1]/(i+1), so inv(fact[i]) = inv(fact[i+1]) * (i+1).

So the code for inv is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) That's straightforward. Now, looking at the rest of the code. Let me see the sample input. Sample input 1: n=3. The output is 1 1 0. The code's code for n=3:\n\nout is initialized as [0,0,0]. The loop runs for i in range(2) (since (3+1)//2 = 2). So i=0 and 1. For i=0:\n\nbase = fact[2] (since n-1 is 2). frac = comb(1, 0) * invcomb(2, 0). comb(1,0) is 1. invcomb(2,0) is inv( (2 choose 0) )? Wait, invcomb is modmul(fact[y] * fact[x - y] ) / fact[x]? Not sure. Wait, the invcomb function is defined as modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]). Because the code says:\n\ndef invcomb(x, y):\n    return modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]) Wait, no, the code's invcomb is written as:\n\ndef invcomb(x, y):\n    return modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]) Wait, that's not the inverse of combination. The combination is (x choose y) = fact[x]/(fact[y] fact[x-y]). So the inverse would be (fact[y] fact[x-y])/fact[x]. So invcomb(x,y) is (fact[y] * fact[x-y]) mod MOD. So in the code's frac calculation, comb(n//2, i) is ( (n//2 choose i) ), multiplied by invcomb(n-1, i). Wait, n//2 for n=3 is 1. So for i=0, comb(1,0) is 1. invcomb(2,0) is fact[0] * fact[2] (since x is 2, y is 0. So fact[0] is 1, fact[2] is 2. So invcomb(2,0) is 1 * 2 = 2. So frac is 1 * 2 mod MOD. Then out[0] = base (fact[2] = 2) multiplied by frac (2) \u2192 2 * 2 =4 mod MOD. But the sample's first element is 1. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the code is incorrect. Wait, the sample's first case has output 1,1,0. So for i=0 (vertex 1?), the code's out[0] is 4, which is wrong.",

So a3 must already be zero. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the operations can be done in any order. Wait, maybe the order of operations matters. Suppose in the example [3,6,9], you first process a3. Wait, but you can't process a3 before a2. Because to process a3, you need to subtract a2 (which is 6) from a3. So first, you can process a3 multiple times. Let me see:\n\nOriginal array: [3,6,9]\n\nFirst, process a3: subtract a2 (6) from a3 \u2192 9-6=3 \u2192 array becomes [3,6,3]\n\nThen process a3 again: subtract a2 (6) again \u2192 but a3 is now 3, which is less than a2 (6). So you can't subtract 6 from 3. So you can't do that. Alternatively, you can process a2 first. Process a2: subtract a1 (3) from a2 \u2192 6-3=3 \u2192 array [3,3,9]\n\nThen process a2 again \u2192 3-3=0 \u2192 array [3,0,9]\n\nNow, a2 is zero. Now, processing a3 can't do anything because a2 is zero. So a3 remains 9. So it's impossible. Thus, the initial approach of checking divisibility by a1 is insufficient. Hmm, so what's the correct condition? Let me think recursively. The problem requires that after all operations, a2, a3,... an are zero. The process can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a1 is fixed. To make a2 zero, the initial a2 must be a multiple of a1. Let's say a2 = k1 * a1. Then, to make a3 zero, after making a2 zero, you can't do anything to a3. So a3 must be zero already. Wait, that's not possible unless a3 is already zero. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the process must be done in such a way that each a_i is a multiple of a_{i-1} after processing the previous elements. Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that each a_i must be divisible by a_{i-1} after the previous steps. Wait, but how to model that. Alternatively, the problem is equivalent to the following: \n\nThe final array must be [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. The operations allowed are subtracting any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. The process can be done in any order. The key is that for each a_i (starting from the end?), you can subtract multiples of a_{i-1} to make it zero. Wait, let's think of the process from the end. Suppose we want to make a_n zero. To do that, we can subtract a_{n-1} from a_n any number of times. But to do that, a_{n} must be a multiple of a_{n-1} after processing the previous elements. Wait, but the a_{n-1} can be modified by operations on a_{n-1} and earlier elements. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a_i must be zero for i >=2. The operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. The key is that the sequence must allow for all a_i (i>1) to be reduced to zero through such operations. The necessary and sufficient condition is that each a_i must be divisible by a_1. Wait, but in the example [3,6,9], all are divisible by 3, but it's impossible. Hmm, so that's not sufficient.",

So in that case, the condition would be met only if the sequence is such that each term is a multiple of the previous one. But how does that help? Alternatively, the problem requires that the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence must be such that each a_i is divisible by a_{i-1} (the original a_{i-1} before any operations). Wait, but that's not possible because the a_{i-1} can be changed. Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the GCD of all elements is a_1. Wait, in the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a_1. But it's still impossible. Hmm. Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final array must be [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. The operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. The process can be done in any order. The key is that for each a_i (starting from the end), we can subtract multiples of a_{i-1} to make it zero. But to do that, a_i must be a multiple of a_{i-1} after processing the previous elements. Wait, but the a_{i-1} can be modified by operations on earlier elements. This seems recursive. Let me think recursively. Suppose we want to make a_n zero. To do that, we can subtract a_{n-1} from a_n any number of times. But to do that, a_{n} must be a multiple of a_{n-1} after processing the first n-1 elements. But the processing of the first n-1 elements must leave a_{n-1} as some value. This is getting too tangled. Perhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be such that each a_i is divisible by a_{i-1} (the original a_{i-1} before any operations).",

So according to this condition, the answer would be NO, but the sample says it's possible. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait the second sample's input is [1,2,3]. The sample says it's possible. Let me see how: \n\nThe steps are: \n\nChoose i=3 (a3=3), subtract a2 (2) \u2192 becomes 1. Then choose i=2 (a2=2), subtract a1 (1) \u2192 becomes 1. Then choose i=3 again (a3=1), subtract a2 (1) \u2192 0. Then choose i=2 again (a2=1), subtract a1 (1) \u2192 0. Final array is [1,0,0]. So it works. But according to the condition that each a_i must be divisible by a_{i-1}, the original a_3 (3) is not divisible by a_2 (2). So the condition is not met, but the answer is YES. Thus, that condition is not correct. Hmm, so what's the correct condition? Let me think of the process as follows: \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. The final a_i must be zero. The key is that the sequence must allow for all a_i to be reduced to zero through such operations. The process can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a_1 is fixed. For a_2 to be zero, it must be possible to subtract a multiple of a_1 from it. So a_2 must be divisible by a_1. For a_3 to be zero, after making a_2 zero, you can't do anything to a_3. So a_3 must be zero already. Wait, but in the second sample, a_3 is 3, which is not zero. Wait, but in the second sample's solution, they first modified a_3 before making a_2 zero. Ah, so the order of operations matters. So the process can be done in any order. Thus, the key is that for each a_i (i>1), the value must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence must allow for the operations to be done in such a way that each a_i can be reduced to zero by subtracting multiples of a_{i-1}, which itself can be reduced to zero. This seems recursive. Let me think recursively. Suppose we have the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. To make all a_i (i>1) zero, we can proceed as follows: 1. Make sure a_2 is divisible by a_1. 2. Make sure a_3 is divisible by a_2 (after a_2 has been reduced to zero?), but that's not possible.",

Perhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be such that each a_i is divisible by the GCD of a_1 and a_{i-1}. Not sure.

Perhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be such that each a_i is divisible by a_{i-1} after dividing by a_1. Wait, let's see: In the second sample, a_2 is 2 (divided by a_1=1 \u2192 2), a_3 is 3 (divided by 1 \u21923). The sequence 2 and 3: 3 is not divisible by 2. But the sample is possible. Hmm. Alternatively, the problem is equivalent to the following: \n\nThe final a_i must be zero for i>1. The operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. The process can be done in any order. The key is that the initial array must be such that the GCD of all elements is a_1. Wait, in the second sample, the GCD is 1, which is a_1. In the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a_1. But it's impossible. Hmm, so that's not sufficient.",

Wait, the GCD of the initial array must be a1. Because, the operations don't change the GCD. Wait, the GCD of the array remains the same after any operation.

The necessary and sufficient condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1. Because, even if the example [3,6,9] meets this condition, but it's impossible, then the condition is not sufficient.

Then process the first element: subtract 2 from 2 \u2192 0. Then process the second element again: subtract 0 \u2192 no change. Thus, the final array is [0,2]. Wait, no. Wait, after making the first element zero, the second element can't be reduced further. Thus, it's not possible. Thus, the condition is that the GCD of the entire array must be 1. In the case of [2,4], GCD is 2 \u2192 not possible. In the case of [2,3], GCD is 1 \u2192 possible. Thus, the condition for the reduced array of length 2 is that the GCD of the two elements is 1. Thus, the recursive condition is that the GCD of the reduced array must be 1. Thus, the overall condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the GCD of the reduced array (a_i/a_1) is 1. Wait, but in the example [3,6,9], the reduced array is [2,3]. GCD is 1 \u2192 thus, the condition would say it's possible, but it's not. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait, the example [3,6,9] reduced array is [2,3]. The GCD is 1. But the original array can't be reduced to zero. Wait, let's try to see: \n\nOriginal array: [3,6,9]. Reduced array: [2,3]. The reduced array's GCD is 1. Thus, according to the condition, it should be possible. But earlier analysis says it's not possible. Let me try to find a way to reduce it: \n\nProcess the second element (9) first. Subtract a_2 (6) from it once \u2192 3. Now the array is [3,6,3]. Process the second element again: subtract 6 from 3 \u2192 can't. Process the first element (6) by subtracting a_1 (3) twice \u2192 0. Now the array is [3,0,3]. Now, the third element is 3. Process it by subtracting a_2 (0) \u2192 no change. Thus, it's impossible. Thus, the condition is not sufficient. Hmm.",

Wait, this contradicts. In the second sample, the reduced array is [2,3]. To make the second element zero, you need to subtract multiples of the first element (2). 3 mod 2 is 1 \u2192 can't reduce to zero. But the sample's solution involves first reducing the first element. Ah, because the operations can be done in any order. Thus, the recursive approach must allow for processing the first element first. Thus, the condition is that the sequence can be reduced to zero through any order of operations. This is equivalent to the GCD of the sequence being 1. Wait, the GCD of the sequence [2,3] is 1. Thus, the condition is that the GCD of the sequence a_i/a_1 must be 1. In the second sample, this holds. In the example [3,6,9], the sequence is [2,3], GCD 1 \u2192 but it's impossible. Hmm, but the example [3,6,9] has a_3 =9, a_2=6. The reduced sequence is [2,3]. The GCD is 1. But it's impossible. Thus, this condition is not sufficient. Hmm.",

Another example: [5,10,5]. a1=5. a2=10 divisible by 5. a3=5 divisible by 5. But a3 is not divisible by a2 (10). So the sequence would be 2,1. So the second term is not divisible by the first.

Thus, the code for program3's missing part is the loop to read the test cases. The function diff_ops is incorrect, but the problem requires to fill in the missing parts of the code. The problem says to output only the missing code. The user's instruction says to output the missing code, not the entire program. The missing code in program3 is the part inside the while loop to read the test cases.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about calculating the maximum total value of free items based on queries of x and y. The given code has some parts missing. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nThe input is read, and the prices are sorted in reverse order (so highest first). Then there's a loop that seems to compute a prefix sum. Wait, the code does prices.sort(reverse=True), so the list is in descending order. Then for i from 1 to n-1, it adds the current price to the previous sum. Wait, that would make the prefix sum array where each element is the sum of the first i elements in the sorted list. Wait, no, because if it's reverse sorted, the first element is the largest. Wait, the code is:\n\nprices are sorted in reverse (so highest first). Then for i in 1 to n-1 (since the loop is range(1, arr[0]), which is n?), the code does prices[i] += prices[i-1]. Wait, that's building a prefix sum array. So after this, prices[i] will be the sum of the first i elements. Wait, no, because the initial prices array is modified here. Wait, the original prices array is being overwritten with the prefix sums. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe the code should have a separate array for the prefix sums. But perhaps the code is correct as written. Let me think.\n\nThe problem requires for each query (x,y), to find the maximum total of the y cheapest items when the customer buys at least x items. The way to maximize the sum of the free items (the y cheapest) is to choose the x items with the highest prices, so that the y cheapest among them are as large as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the y cheapest items in the purchased items. To maximize the sum of the y cheapest, you want those y items to be as large as possible. So the optimal is to select the x most expensive items, then take the y smallest among them. Because if you take the x most expensive, then the y smallest in that group will be the y smallest of those x, which are the largest possible possible for the y cheapest. \n\nSo for a given x and y, the sum would be the sum of the y smallest elements in the top x elements. Since the prices are sorted in descending order, the first x elements are the top x. The y smallest among them are the last y elements in those x. So the sum would be the sum of the elements from position x - y to x-1 (since the array is 0-based and sorted descending). Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the sorted array is [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]. If x is 5, then the top 5 are [10,9,8,7,6]. The y cheapest among them would be the last y elements. For example, if y is 2, then the two cheapest are 7 and 6, sum is 13. The indices here would be 3 and 4 (since 0-based). So the sum from index (x - y) to x-1? Wait, x is 5, so x - y = 5-2=3. So elements 3 and 4 (7 and 6) sum to 13. So the sum is the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements. \n\nThe prefix sum array here is built as the cumulative sum. Wait, the current code's prefix array is built as:\n\nAfter sorting in reverse, the first element is the largest. The prefix sum array (stored in prices) would be:\n\nprices[0] = 10\n\nprices[1] = 10 +9 =19\n\nprices[2] = 19 +8=27, etc. Wait, no. Wait, the code is:\n\nprices are sorted in reverse. Then for i from 1 to n-1 (since the loop is range(1, arr[0]). Wait, arr[0] is n. So the loop runs from 1 to n-1. So for each i, prices[i] += prices[i-1]. So after this, the prices array becomes the prefix sum array. So prices[i] is the sum of the first i elements. \n\nWait, so the sum of the first x elements is prices[x-1]. But how do we get the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements?\n\nThe sum of the first x elements is S = prices[x-1]. The sum of the first (x - y) elements is prices[x - y -1], assuming x - y >=0. So the sum of the last y elements would be S - prices[x - y -1]. \n\nWait, let's see. For example, x=5, y=2. The first 5 elements sum to prices[4]. The first 3 elements (5-2=3) sum to prices[2]. So the last two elements (positions 3 and 4) sum to prices[4] - prices[2] = (10+9+8+7+6) - (10+9+8) = 40 - 27 = 13, which matches the example. \n\nSo the formula for the sum when given x and y is: if x == y, then all x items are free, so the sum is the sum of the first x elements (since all are taken). But when x>y, then it's the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements, which is prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1]. \n\nSo in the code, the TODO part is when xy[0] != xy[1]. So in that case, x is the first element, y the second. So the code should compute:\n\nsum = prices[x-1] - (prices[x - y -1] if (x - y) >0 else 0)\n\nWait, but when x - y is 0, then x - y -1 is -1, which would be invalid. So when x - y ==0, that means y =x, so the sum is prices[x-1], which is handled by the if condition. But in the else block, since x>y, so x - y is at least 1. Wait, no, the condition is if (xy[0] == xy[1]). So in the else block, x is not equal to y, but since y <=x, so y can be less than x. So in that case, the formula is correct. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif x_i == y_i: then the sum is prices[x_i-1]\n\nelse:\n\nsum = prices[x_i -1] - (prices[x_i - y_i -1] if (x_i - y_i) >=1 else 0)\n\nWait, but when x_i - y_i is 0, then x_i = y_i, but that's already handled by the if condition. So in the else block, since x_i > y_i, so x_i - y_i is at least 1. So the code can safely do:\n\nsum_val = prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1]\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose x=5, y=2. x - y is 3, so x - y -1 is 2. So prices[4] - prices[2] = 40 -27 =13, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: in the first sample input given in the problem's note, the first query is x=3, y=2. The first 3 items (sorted in reverse) are 5,5,3. The sum of the first 3 is 13. The first (3-2)=1 elements sum to 5. So 13-5=8, which matches the note's example. \n\nSo the code in the else block should be:\n\nans_val = prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0] - xy[1] -1]\n\nBut need to make sure that xy[0] - xy[1] -1 is >=0. Since xy[0] > xy[1], so xy[0] - xy[1] is at least 1, so subtracting 1 gives 0 or more. \n\nSo in the code, the TODO part is:\n\nans_val = prices[xy[0]-1] - prices[xy[0] - xy[1] -1]\n\nThen append that to ans.\n\nSo the code in the else block would be:\n\nelse:\n\n    x = xy[0]\n\n    y = xy[1]\n\n    ans.append( prices[x-1] - prices[ x - y -1 ] )\n\nWait, but in the code, the prices array is the prefix sum. So that's correct. \n\nSo the missing code in program1 is replacing the TODO with that line.\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is about counting the number of trees where each vertex (except root) has exactly one parent with a smaller index, and for each vertex i, count how many such trees have i as a centroid. The answer must be modulo 998244353.\n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a lot of combinatorics here. The code uses factorial and inverse factorial arrays. The inv function is missing, which is needed for modular inverses. The code's first part is setting up fact and invfact arrays up to MAX (1e6), but the problem's n can be up to 2e5, so maybe that's okay. \n\nThe problem requires for each vertex i, the number of trees where i is the centroid. The centroid is a node whose removal leaves all subtrees with size at most (n-1)/2. Since n is odd, (n-1)/2 is an integer. \n\nThe code's approach seems to involve some combinatorial formulas. Let me look at the code's structure. \n\nThe code defines functions modmul (for multiplication with carry?), inv (to compute inverse mod MOD?), fact and invfact arrays. Then comb and invcomb functions. \n\nThe main part starts with n = int(input()), then initializes out array. Then loops over i in range((n+1)//2). The variable base is fact[n-1], which is (n-1)!.\n\nThe frac is modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)). Hmm, not sure. \n\nWait, the code's logic might be based on the fact that the centroid must be in the middle. For a tree to have centroid at i, the tree must be structured such that when i is removed, all components have size <= (n-1)/2. \n\nThe approach might involve choosing the centroid and then distributing the nodes into subtrees such that each subtree has size at most (n-1)/2. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using some known formula. \n\nLooking at the code's current state, the inv function is missing. The inv function is needed to compute the modular inverse. Since MOD is a prime (998244353 is a known prime), the inverse of x mod MOD is pow(x, MOD-2, MOD). So the inv function can be implemented as:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nThat's the first missing part. \n\nThen, the code's fact array is built with modmul. Wait, the modmul function is defined as modmul(x, y, c=0) returns (x*y +c) mod MOD. So when building fact, for each i from 1 to MAX-1, fact[i] = modmul(i, fact[i-1]). Which is equivalent to (i * fact[i-1]) mod MOD. So that's correct for factorial mod MOD. \n\nThe invfact array is initialized with invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1]). Then for i from MAX-2 down to 0, invfact[i] = modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1]). Since invfact[i] = inv(fact[i]) mod MOD. Because fact[i] = fact[i+1]/(i+1), so inv(fact[i]) = inv(fact[i+1]) * (i+1). So that's correct. \n\nThe comb function is combination(n choose k) mod MOD, which is fact[n] * invfact[k] * invfact[n-k] mod MOD. The code's comb function uses modmul(fact[n], modmul(invfact[k], invfact[n - y])). Wait, looking at the code's comb function:\n\ndef comb(x, y):\n    return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n\nWait, the parameters are x and y, so it's x choose y? So the code's comb function is for combinations of x choose y. \n\nSimilarly, invcomb is the inverse of combination? Not sure. \n\nThe code's main loop for i in range((n+1)//2) is probably iterating over possible positions for the centroid. \n\nThe variable base is fact[n-1], which is (n-1)!.\n\nThe frac is modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)). \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is using some combinatorial approach where the number of trees where the centroid is at position i is calculated using some product of combinations. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Since the problem is quite complex, perhaps the code is correct except for the missing inv function. \n\nWait, the code's inv function is missing. So the first thing to do is to fill in the inv function. \n\nSo the missing part in program2 is the inv function. \n\nThe code's inv function is supposed to return the modular inverse of x mod MOD. So the code for inv is:\n\ndef inv(x):\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nThat's straightforward. \n\nNow, looking at the rest of the code. Let me see the sample input. \n\nSample input 1: n=3. The output is 1 1 0. \n\nThe code's code for n=3:\n\nout is initialized as [0,0,0]. \n\nThe loop runs for i in range(2) (since (3+1)//2 = 2). So i=0 and 1. \n\nFor i=0:\n\nbase = fact[2] (since n-1 is 2). \n\nfrac = comb(1, 0) * invcomb(2, 0). \n\ncomb(1,0) is 1. invcomb(2,0) is inv( (2 choose 0) )? Wait, invcomb is modmul(fact[y] * fact[x - y] ) / fact[x]? Not sure. \n\nWait, the invcomb function is defined as modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]). Because the code says:\n\ndef invcomb(x, y):\n    return modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y])\n\nWait, no, the code's invcomb is written as:\n\ndef invcomb(x, y):\n    return modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y])\n\nWait, that's not the inverse of combination. The combination is (x choose y) = fact[x]/(fact[y] fact[x-y]). So the inverse would be (fact[y] fact[x-y])/fact[x]. So invcomb(x,y) is (fact[y] * fact[x-y]) mod MOD. \n\nSo in the code's frac calculation, comb(n//2, i) is ( (n//2 choose i) ), multiplied by invcomb(n-1, i). \n\nWait, n//2 for n=3 is 1. So for i=0, comb(1,0) is 1. invcomb(2,0) is fact[0] * fact[2] (since x is 2, y is 0. So fact[0] is 1, fact[2] is 2. So invcomb(2,0) is 1 * 2 = 2. \n\nSo frac is 1 * 2 mod MOD. \n\nThen out[0] = base (fact[2] = 2) multiplied by frac (2) \u2192 2 * 2 =4 mod MOD. \n\nBut the sample's first element is 1. Hmm, that suggests that perhaps the code is incorrect. \n\nWait, the sample's first case has output 1,1,0. So for i=0 (vertex 1?), the code's out[0] is 4, which is wrong. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a mistake in the code's logic. But since the problem requires only to fill in the missing parts, perhaps the inv function is the only missing part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct except for the inv function. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's invcomb is supposed to compute the inverse of combination, but the code's current invcomb is not that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, but the problem requires more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct except for the inv function. Let me proceed. \n\nThe missing part in program2 is the inv function. \n\nNow, program3.py. The problem is to determine if it's possible to make all elements from a[2] to a[n] zero by repeatedly subtracting a[i-1] from a[i]. \n\nThe code's current approach is to check if all elements are divisible by a[0]. The function diff_ops returns whether all a[i] mod a[0] ==0. \n\nWait, but the sample input 1 is [5,10], which gives a[1] mod a[0] is 0, so returns true \u2192 \"YES\". Which matches the first sample. \n\nThe second sample input is [1,2,3]. The a[0] is 1. All elements mod 1 are 0, so returns true \u2192 \"YES\". Which matches the second sample. \n\nThird test case? Let's see the third sample in the note: the third test case's input is not given, but the note says that the answer is possible. \n\nWait, the code's approach is that the necessary and sufficient condition is that all elements are divisible by a[0]. \n\nIs that correct? \n\nLet me think. \n\nThe operations allowed are to subtract a[i-1] from a[i], any number of times. \n\nThe process can be thought of as follows: \n\nEach operation on a[i] reduces a[i] by k*a[i-1], where k is any non-negative integer (but since you can do it multiple times, effectively you can subtract any multiple of a[i-1] from a[i]. \n\nThe goal is to make all a[2..n] zero. \n\nLet me think of the process in reverse. Suppose we want to reach the target where a[2] =0, a[3]=0, etc. \n\nAlternatively, the process can be viewed as a series of steps where each step reduces a[i] by a multiple of a[i-1]. \n\nThe key insight is that the final a[1] must remain as the initial a[1] minus some multiple of a[0], but perhaps the invariant is that the GCD of all elements must be a[0]. \n\nWait, let's think of the problem in terms of the initial array. \n\nSuppose the initial array is a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. \n\nEach operation on a_i (i >=2) subtracts a multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe key is that the final a_i (for i >=2) must be zero. \n\nLet me think of the process as follows: \n\nThe final a_1 remains as the original a_1 minus some multiple of a_1 (but no, since you can't change a_1 except through operations on later elements). Wait, no. The a_1 can only be changed if you perform operations on a_2, but those operations only affect a_2. \n\nWait, the operations only allow changing a_i (i >=2) by subtracting a multiple of a_{i-1}. So the a_1 remains unchanged. \n\nWait, the problem says you can perform the operation any number of times. The operation is: choose an index i (2<=i<=n), and set a_i = a_i - a_{i-1}. \n\nWait, each operation subtracts a_{i-1} from a_i. So the a_{i-1} is not changed. \n\nTherefore, the a_1 is fixed throughout the process. \n\nThe final a_1 must be the same as the initial a_1. \n\nThe other elements must be reduced to zero. \n\nLet me think of the process for the array [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]. \n\nThe final a2 must be zero. To do that, you can subtract a1 from a2 multiple times. The number of times you can do this is floor(a2 / a1). But since you can do it any number of times, you can subtract exactly (a2 / a1) times, but only if a2 is divisible by a1. \n\nWait, but after each subtraction, a2 becomes a2 - k*a1, but the a1 remains the same. So to reach zero, a2 must be a multiple of a1. \n\nSimilarly, for a3: after handling a2, a3 can be reduced by multiples of a2 (which is now zero?), but wait, no. \n\nWait, the process can be done in any order. Let me think step by step. \n\nSuppose we first process a2. To make a2 zero, a2 must be divisible by a1. \n\nOnce a2 is zero, then when processing a3, the a2 is zero, so subtracting a2 (which is zero) from a3 has no effect. So to make a3 zero, it must already be zero. \n\nWait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the operations can be done in any order, but the key is that the a_i's after earlier steps affect the later steps. \n\nAlternatively, the process is similar to the Euclidean algorithm for GCD. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the final a1. Since a1 is fixed, the other elements must be made zero through operations that subtract multiples of their previous elements. \n\nThe process can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a2 must be zero. To do that, the initial a2 must be a multiple of a1. \n\nThen, for a3, after making a2 zero, the only way to affect a3 is by subtracting a2 (which is zero) from it, so a3 must already be zero. \n\nWait, that can't be right. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of the problem in reverse. \n\nSuppose the final array is [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. \n\nTo reach this, the last operation must have been on a_n, subtracting a_{n-1} (which is zero) from a_n, so a_n must have been zero already. \n\nThis suggests that the only way to get all zeros is if all elements after a1 are multiples of a1, and also the subsequent elements must be multiples of the previous ones. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that all elements are divisible by a1, and the GCD of all elements is a1. \n\nWait, let's see the first sample: [5,10]. a1 is 5. a2 is 10 divisible by 5 \u2192 yes. So possible. \n\nSecond sample: [1,2,3]. a1 is 1. All elements are divisible by 1 \u2192 yes. \n\nThird test case in the note (not given, but the example says that the answer is possible). \n\nAnother test case: suppose a = [3,6,9]. \n\nThen a2 is 6 divisible by 3 \u2192 yes. a3 is 9 divisible by 3 \u2192 yes. \n\nBut how to make a3 zero? \n\nFirst, make a2 zero by subtracting 2 times a1 (3*2=6 \u2192 a2 becomes 0). \n\nThen, for a3, since a2 is now zero, any operation on a3 would subtract a2 (0) from it, so a3 remains 9. So that's a problem. \n\nWait, so in this case, the condition (all divisible by a1) is met, but it's impossible. \n\nHmm, so the initial approach is wrong. \n\nWait, so what's wrong here? \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], according to the current code's logic, it would return YES, but actually it's impossible. \n\nBecause after making a2 zero, a3 can't be reduced because a2 is zero. \n\nSo the condition must be stronger. \n\nHmm, so the problem requires that after making a2 zero, then a3 must be a multiple of a2 (which is zero?), but that's impossible. \n\nWait, so the problem requires that after each step, the previous element is non-zero? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a1, and also the GCD of all elements must be a1. \n\nWait, in the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a1. But the problem is that a3 is 9, which is divisible by a1, but after making a2 zero, you can't do anything with a3. \n\nHmm, so the problem requires that after each step, the previous element is non-zero until you process the current one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that each a_i must be divisible by a_1, and also the a_i must form a non-increasing sequence when divided by a_1. \n\nWait, let me think of the process as follows: \n\nThe process is similar to the steps in the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nThe key idea is that the final a1 remains the same. \n\nThe process can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a2 must be zero, so the initial a2 must be a multiple of a1. Let's say a2 = k1 * a1. \n\nThen, for a3, after making a2 zero, you can't do anything to a3 except subtract a2 (which is zero). So a3 must already be zero. \n\nWait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the operations can be done in any order. \n\nWait, maybe the order of operations matters. \n\nSuppose in the example [3,6,9], you first process a3. \n\nWait, but you can't process a3 before a2. Because to process a3, you need to subtract a2 (which is 6) from a3. \n\nSo first, you can process a3 multiple times. \n\nLet me see:\n\nOriginal array: [3,6,9]\n\nFirst, process a3: subtract a2 (6) from a3 \u2192 9-6=3 \u2192 array becomes [3,6,3]\n\nThen process a3 again: subtract a2 (6) again \u2192 but a3 is now 3, which is less than a2 (6). So you can't subtract 6 from 3. So you can't do that. \n\nAlternatively, you can process a2 first. \n\nProcess a2: subtract a1 (3) from a2 \u2192 6-3=3 \u2192 array [3,3,9]\n\nThen process a2 again \u2192 3-3=0 \u2192 array [3,0,9]\n\nNow, a2 is zero. Now, processing a3 can't do anything because a2 is zero. \n\nSo a3 remains 9. So it's impossible. \n\nThus, the initial approach of checking divisibility by a1 is insufficient. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition? \n\nLet me think recursively. \n\nThe problem requires that after all operations, a2, a3,... an are zero. \n\nThe process can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a1 is fixed. \n\nTo make a2 zero, the initial a2 must be a multiple of a1. Let's say a2 = k1 * a1. \n\nThen, to make a3 zero, after making a2 zero, you can't do anything to a3. So a3 must be zero already. \n\nWait, that's not possible unless a3 is already zero. \n\nWait, that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process must be done in such a way that each a_i is a multiple of a_{i-1} after processing the previous elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that each a_i must be divisible by a_{i-1} after the previous steps. \n\nWait, but how to model that. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is equivalent to the following: \n\nThe final array must be [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. \n\nThe operations allowed are subtracting any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe process can be done in any order. \n\nThe key is that for each a_i (starting from the end?), you can subtract multiples of a_{i-1} to make it zero. \n\nWait, let's think of the process from the end. \n\nSuppose we want to make a_n zero. To do that, we can subtract a_{n-1} from a_n any number of times. \n\nBut to do that, a_{n} must be a multiple of a_{n-1} after processing the previous elements. \n\nWait, but the a_{n-1} can be modified by operations on a_{n-1} and earlier elements. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a_i must be zero for i >=2. \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe key is that the sequence must allow for all a_i (i>1) to be reduced to zero through such operations. \n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition is that each a_i must be divisible by a_1. \n\nWait, but in the example [3,6,9], all are divisible by 3, but it's impossible. \n\nHmm, so that's not sufficient. \n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that each a_i must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2/a_1, a_3/a_1, etc. must form a sequence where each term is divisible by the previous term's quotient. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [3,6,9]. \n\na1 =3. \n\na2/3 =2, a3/3=3. \n\nThe sequence 2,3. \n\nThe second term (3) is not divisible by the first (2). So that's a problem. \n\nIn this case, the process can't proceed. \n\nAnother example: [2,4,8]. \n\na1=2. \n\na2/2=2, a3/2=4. \n\nThe sequence 2,4. \n\n4 is divisible by 2. \n\nSo possible. \n\nHow? \n\nProcess a3 first: subtract a2 (4) from a3 (8 \u2192 4). Then again subtract a2 (4) \u2192 0. \n\nThen process a2: subtract a1 (2) twice \u2192 0. \n\nResult: [2,0,0]. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the condition is that the sequence of a_i / a_1 must form a sequence where each term is divisible by the previous term. \n\nWait, but in the first example [3,6,9], the sequence is 2,3. 3 is not divisible by 2. \n\nSo the condition would be that the sequence a_i / a_1 must be such that each term is divisible by the previous term. \n\nWait, but the order might not matter. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must be such that each a_i is divisible by a_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but the a_{i-1} can be changed by previous operations. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the GCD of all elements must be a_1, and also each a_i must be divisible by a_1. \n\nWait, in the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a_1. But it's still impossible. \n\nHmm, so that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must form a sequence where each term is a multiple of the previous term. \n\nWait, in the example [3,6,9], the terms are 6 (divisible by 3), 9 (divisible by 6? No. 9/6 is 1.5. So no. So that's why it's impossible. \n\nIn the example [2,4,8], 4 is divisible by 2, 8 divisible by 4 \u2192 yes. \n\nAnother example: [5,10,5]. \n\na1=5. a2=10 divisible by 5. a3=5 divisible by 5. \n\nBut a3 is not divisible by a2 (10). \n\nSo the sequence would be 2,1. \n\nSo the second term is not divisible by the first. \n\nThus, it's impossible. \n\nSo the condition is that the sequence a_i/a_1 must be non-increasing? Or each term must be divisible by the previous term's quotient. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must form a sequence where each term is divisible by the previous term. \n\nWait, but in the first example [3,6,9], the terms are 6 and 9. 6 divides 6, but 9 is not divisible by 6. \n\nSo the condition would require that each term is divisible by the previous term. \n\nWait, but that would require a_2 divides a_3, which is not the case here. \n\nSo the condition would be that the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be such that each term is divisible by the previous term. \n\nWait, but that would require a_2 divides a_3, which is not the case in the first example. \n\nSo in that case, the condition would be met only if the sequence is such that each term is a multiple of the previous one. \n\nBut how does that help? \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence must be such that each a_i is divisible by a_{i-1} (the original a_{i-1} before any operations). \n\nWait, but that's not possible because the a_{i-1} can be changed. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the GCD of all elements is a_1. \n\nWait, in the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a_1. But it's still impossible. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final array must be [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe process can be done in any order. \n\nThe key is that for each a_i (starting from the end), we can subtract multiples of a_{i-1} to make it zero. \n\nBut to do that, a_i must be a multiple of a_{i-1} after processing the previous elements. \n\nWait, but the a_{i-1} can be modified by operations on earlier elements. \n\nThis seems recursive. \n\nLet me think recursively. \n\nSuppose we want to make a_n zero. To do that, we can subtract a_{n-1} from a_n any number of times. \n\nBut to do that, a_{n} must be a multiple of a_{n-1} after processing the first n-1 elements. \n\nBut the processing of the first n-1 elements must leave a_{n-1} as some value. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be such that each a_i is divisible by a_{i-1} (the original a_{i-1} before any operations). \n\nWait, but in the first example [3,6,9], a_2 is divisible by a_1 (3 divides 6), but a_3 is not divisible by a_2 (6 doesn't divide 9). \n\nSo the condition would require that a_3 is divisible by a_2 (original a_2 is 6). 9 is not divisible by 6 \u2192 so the condition is not met, so the answer is NO. \n\nWhich matches the example I thought of earlier. \n\nSo the condition would be that for all i from 2 to n, a_i must be divisible by a_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but that's a stricter condition. \n\nWait, let's see the first sample: [5,10]. \n\na_2 is 10 divisible by a_1 (5 \u2192 yes). So condition holds \u2192 YES. \n\nSecond sample: [1,2,3]. \n\na_2 is 2 divisible by 1 \u2192 yes. a_3 is 3 divisible by 2 \u2192 no. So according to this condition, the answer would be NO, but the sample says it's possible. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait the second sample's input is [1,2,3]. \n\nThe sample says it's possible. \n\nLet me see how: \n\nThe steps are: \n\nChoose i=3 (a3=3), subtract a2 (2) \u2192 becomes 1. \n\nThen choose i=2 (a2=2), subtract a1 (1) \u2192 becomes 1. \n\nThen choose i=3 again (a3=1), subtract a2 (1) \u2192 0. \n\nThen choose i=2 again (a2=1), subtract a1 (1) \u2192 0. \n\nFinal array is [1,0,0]. \n\nSo it works. \n\nBut according to the condition that each a_i must be divisible by a_{i-1}, the original a_3 (3) is not divisible by a_2 (2). \n\nSo the condition is not met, but the answer is YES. \n\nThus, that condition is not correct. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition? \n\nLet me think of the process as follows: \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe final a_i must be zero. \n\nThe key is that the sequence must allow for all a_i to be reduced to zero through such operations. \n\nThe process can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a_1 is fixed. \n\nFor a_2 to be zero, it must be possible to subtract a multiple of a_1 from it. So a_2 must be divisible by a_1. \n\nFor a_3 to be zero, after making a_2 zero, you can't do anything to a_3. So a_3 must be zero already. \n\nWait, but in the second sample, a_3 is 3, which is not zero. \n\nWait, but in the second sample's solution, they first modified a_3 before making a_2 zero. \n\nAh, so the order of operations matters. \n\nSo the process can be done in any order. \n\nThus, the key is that for each a_i (i>1), the value must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence must allow for the operations to be done in such a way that each a_i can be reduced to zero by subtracting multiples of a_{i-1}, which itself can be reduced to zero. \n\nThis seems recursive. \n\nLet me think recursively. \n\nSuppose we have the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. \n\nTo make all a_i (i>1) zero, we can proceed as follows: \n\n1. Make sure a_2 is divisible by a_1. \n\n2. Make sure a_3 is divisible by a_2 (after a_2 has been reduced to zero?), but that's not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the GCD of all elements must be a_1, and also each a_i must be divisible by a_1. \n\nWait, in the second sample, the GCD is 1, which is a_1. \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a_1. But it's impossible. \n\nHmm, so that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the sequence can be reduced step by step. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nThe process is equivalent to the following: \n\nThe final a_1 is fixed. \n\nThe other elements must be zero. \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe key is that for each a_i (starting from the end), we can subtract multiples of a_{i-1} to make it zero. \n\nBut to do that, a_{i} must be a multiple of a_{i-1} after processing the previous elements. \n\nBut the previous elements can be processed in any order. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be such that each a_i is divisible by the GCD of a_1 and a_{i-1}. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final array must be [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe process can be done in any order. \n\nThe key is that for each a_i (i>1), the value must be divisible by a_1. \n\nBecause, to make a_i zero, you can subtract a multiple of a_{i-1} (which is eventually zero) but that's not possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1. \n\nBut in the second sample, that holds and it works. \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], it holds but it doesn't work. \n\nSo why is that? \n\nAh, because in the example [3,6,9], the a_3 is 9, which is divisible by a_1 (3). \n\nBut to make a_3 zero, you need to subtract multiples of a_2 (which is 6). \n\nBut to make a_2 zero, you have to subtract multiples of a_1 (3). \n\nSo after making a_2 zero, you can't do anything with a_3. \n\nThus, the problem is that a_3 must be divisible by a_2's final value (which is zero), which is impossible. \n\nThus, the condition must also require that a_3 is divisible by a_2's value after processing a_2. \n\nBut since a_2 can be reduced to zero, that's not possible. \n\nThus, the only way to make a_3 zero is if a_3 is already a multiple of a_2's value before processing a_2. \n\nBut this is getting too recursive. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be such that each a_i is divisible by a_{i-1} after dividing by a_1. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIn the second sample, a_2 is 2 (divided by a_1=1 \u2192 2), a_3 is 3 (divided by 1 \u21923). \n\nThe sequence 2 and 3: 3 is not divisible by 2. \n\nBut the sample is possible. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is equivalent to the following: \n\nThe final a_i must be zero for i>1. \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe process can be done in any order. \n\nThe key is that the initial array must be such that the GCD of all elements is a_1. \n\nWait, in the second sample, the GCD is 1, which is a_1. \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a_1. But it's impossible. \n\nHmm, so that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the sequence can be reduced to zero by repeatedly subtracting multiples of previous elements. \n\nThis is similar to the problem of whether the array can be reduced to [a1,0,0,...0] through such operations. \n\nThe key insight is that the final a1 must be the GCD of all elements. \n\nWait, the GCD of the initial array must be a1. \n\nBecause, the operations don't change the GCD. \n\nWait, the GCD of the array remains the same after any operation. \n\nBecause subtracting a multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i doesn't change the GCD. \n\nFor example, GCD(a, b) = GCD(a, b - k*a). \n\nThus, the GCD of the initial array must be equal to the GCD of the final array, which is a1. \n\nThus, the necessary condition is that the GCD of all elements must be a1. \n\nBut also, a1 must be the first element. \n\nSo the condition is that the GCD of the entire array is a1. \n\nIn the first example, GCD(5,10) is 5 \u2192 yes. \n\nSecond example: GCD(1,2,3) is 1 \u2192 yes. \n\nThird example [3,6,9], GCD is 3 \u2192 yes. But it's impossible. \n\nAh, so this condition is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong with the third example? \n\nThe GCD is 3, which is a1. \n\nBut it's impossible to make all other elements zero. \n\nThus, the condition must be stronger. \n\nWait, perhaps the first element must be the GCD of the entire array. \n\nYes, that's necessary. \n\nBut in the third example, it is. \n\nSo why is it impossible? \n\nBecause the third element (9) is not divisible by the second element (6). \n\nBut the second element can be reduced to zero. \n\nThus, the problem requires that the GCD is a1, and also that each element after the first is divisible by a1. \n\nWhich is already implied by the GCD condition. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps the initial approach of the code is correct for the problem's test cases, but the example I thought of is not a valid test case. \n\nWait, in the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a1. \n\nThe code's current approach would return YES, but the correct answer is NO. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nSo what is the correct condition? \n\nLet me think of the process as follows: \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe final a_i must be zero. \n\nThe process can be done in any order. \n\nThe key is that for each a_i (i>1), the value must be divisible by a_1. \n\nBecause, to make a_i zero, you can subtract multiples of a_{i-1} (which eventually becomes zero), but that's not possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence a_2, a_3, ..., a_n must be such that each a_i is divisible by the previous element's value after processing. \n\nBut this is recursive. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe final a_1 is fixed. \n\nTo make a_2 zero, it must be divisible by a_1. \n\nTo make a_3 zero, it must be divisible by a_2's value after processing a_2. \n\nBut after processing a_2, a_2 is zero. \n\nThus, a_3 must be zero. \n\nThus, the only way to make a_3 zero is if it is already zero. \n\nThis suggests that the condition is that all elements after a_1 must be divisible by a_1, and also the elements after a_2 must be zero. \n\nBut that's not the case in the second sample. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and the sequence of a_i/a_1 must form a non-increasing sequence. \n\nWait, in the second sample: \n\na_2/a_1 = 2, a_3/a_1 =3 \u2192 not non-increasing. \n\nBut the sample is possible. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is equivalent to the following: \n\nThe final array is [a1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. \n\nThe operations allow us to subtract any multiple of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\nThe process can be done in any order. \n\nThe key is that the initial array must be such that the sequence can be reduced to this form. \n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1. \n\nBecause, even if the example [3,6,9] meets this condition, but it's impossible, then the condition is not sufficient. \n\nThus, there must be another condition. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the sequence can be reduced step by step. \n\nFor example, to make a_3 zero, you can first process a_3 by subtracting a_2 (6) from it until it's less than a_2. \n\nBut then you can process a_2 to zero, and then process a_3 again. \n\nWait, let's try the example [3,6,9]. \n\nInitial array: [3,6,9]. \n\nProcess a3: subtract a2 (6) once \u2192 9-6=3 \u2192 array [3,6,3]. \n\nThen process a3 again: subtract a2 (6) \u2192 but 3-6 is negative. Can't do that. \n\nSo can't reduce further. \n\nThen process a2: subtract a1 (3) twice \u2192 6-3*2=0 \u2192 array [3,0,3]. \n\nNow, a2 is zero. \n\nNow, process a3: can't subtract a2 (0) from it. \n\nThus, a3 remains 3. \n\nThus, it's impossible. \n\nThus, the condition is that all elements must be divisible by a_1, and also the sequence of a_i/a_1 must be such that each a_i/a_1 is divisible by the previous a_{i-1}/a_1. \n\nWait, in the example [3,6,9], a_2/a_1 is 2, a_3/a_1 is 3. 3 is not divisible by 2 \u2192 thus, condition not met \u2192 answer is NO. \n\nIn the second sample: a_2/a_1 is 2, a_3/a_1 is 3. 3 is not divisible by 2 \u2192 but the sample is possible. \n\nHmm, this contradicts. \n\nWait, the second sample's solution involves processing a3 first. \n\nLet me see: \n\nInitial array [1,2,3]. \n\nProcess a3: subtract a2 (2) \u2192 3-2=1 \u2192 array [1,2,1]. \n\nProcess a2: subtract a1 (1) \u2192 2-1=1 \u2192 array [1,1,1]. \n\nProcess a3 again: subtract a2 (1) \u2192 1-1=0 \u2192 array [1,1,0]. \n\nProcess a2 again: subtract a1 (1) \u2192 0 \u2192 array [1,0,0]. \n\nThus, it works. \n\nThe sequence a_i/a_1 is [2,3]. \n\nThe second term (3) is not divisible by the first (2). \n\nBut the process works because the a_2 was reduced first. \n\nThus, the condition must not require that each term is divisible by the previous one. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the GCD of all elements is a_1. \n\nBut in the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 3, which is a_1. \n\nBut it's impossible. \n\nThus, this is not sufficient. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the sequence of a_i/a_1 must be such that the GCD of the entire sequence is 1. \n\nIn the second sample, the sequence is 2 and 3 \u2192 GCD 1 \u2192 yes. \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], the sequence is 2 and 3 \u2192 GCD 1 \u2192 but it's impossible. \n\nHmm, no. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the sequence of a_i/a_1 must be such that the GCD of all elements in this sequence is 1. \n\nBut in the second sample, it's 2 and 3 \u2192 GCD 1 \u2192 yes. \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], the sequence is 2 and 3 \u2192 GCD 1 \u2192 but it's impossible. \n\nThus, this is not sufficient. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the sequence of a_i/a_1 can be reduced to zero through the same operations. \n\nThis is recursive. \n\nThe problem reduces to whether the array [a_2/a_1, a_3/a_1, ..., a_n/a_1] can be reduced to all zeros with the same operations. \n\nThus, the problem is recursive. \n\nThe base case is when n=2: the array [a_2/a_1]. \n\nTo make it zero, it must be divisible by a_1 (which it is), so yes. \n\nFor n=3: the array [a_2/a_1, a_3/a_1]. \n\nThe problem reduces to whether this array can be reduced to [0,0]. \n\nWhich requires that a_3/a_1 must be divisible by a_2/a_1. \n\nBecause: \n\nTo make the second element (a_3/a_1) zero, you can subtract multiples of the first element (a_2/a_1). \n\nThus, a_3/a_1 must be divisible by a_2/a_1. \n\nThus, the condition for n=3 is that a_3 must be divisible by a_2. \n\nIn the second sample, a_3 is 3, a_2 is 2 \u2192 3 is not divisible by 2 \u2192 but the sample is possible. \n\nWait, this contradicts. \n\nIn the second sample, the reduced array is [2,3]. \n\nTo make the second element zero, you need to subtract multiples of the first element (2). \n\n3 mod 2 is 1 \u2192 can't reduce to zero. \n\nBut the sample's solution involves first reducing the first element. \n\nAh, because the operations can be done in any order. \n\nThus, the recursive approach must allow for processing the first element first. \n\nThus, the condition is that the sequence can be reduced to zero through any order of operations. \n\nThis is equivalent to the GCD of the sequence being 1. \n\nWait, the GCD of the sequence [2,3] is 1. \n\nThus, the condition is that the GCD of the sequence a_i/a_1 must be 1. \n\nIn the second sample, this holds. \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], the sequence is [2,3], GCD 1 \u2192 but it's impossible. \n\nHmm, but the example [3,6,9] has a_3 =9, a_2=6. \n\nThe reduced sequence is [2,3]. \n\nThe GCD is 1. \n\nBut it's impossible. \n\nThus, this condition is not sufficient. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the sequence of a_i/a_1 must be such that the GCD of the entire sequence is 1. \n\nBut in the example [3,6,9], the GCD is 1, but it's impossible. \n\nThus, this is not sufficient. \n\nI'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps the initial code's approach is correct for the problem's test cases, but the example I thought of is not a valid test case. \n\nWait, the example I thought of [3,6,9] has a_1=3. \n\nThe code's function diff_ops would return True because all elements are divisible by 3. \n\nBut the correct answer is NO. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nSo what is the correct condition? \n\nThe correct condition must be that all elements are divisible by a_1, and also the sequence of a_i/a_1 must be such that the GCD of the entire sequence is 1. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the condition is that the sequence of a_i/a_1 must be such that the first element is the GCD of the entire sequence. \n\nIn the second sample, the sequence is [2,3]. The GCD is 1, which is not the first element. \n\nThus, this is not. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the sequence of a_i/a_1 can be reduced to zero through the operations. \n\nThis is equivalent to the problem being solvable for the reduced array. \n\nThus, the problem is recursive. \n\nThe function is possible if and only if all elements are divisible by a_1, and the reduced array (a_2/a_1, a_3/a_1, ..., a_n/a_1) can be reduced to all zeros. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to the same problem for the reduced array. \n\nThe base case is when the array has length 1 (n=2), then it's possible if the element is zero (but since it's divided by a_1, it must be zero). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, for the reduced array of length 1 (n=2), the array is [a_2/a_1]. \n\nTo make it zero, it must be possible to subtract multiples of a_1 (which is the first element of the original array) from a_2. \n\nBut the reduced array's first element is a_2/a_1. \n\nTo make it zero, you can subtract a_2/a_1 times a_1 from a_2, resulting in zero. \n\nThus, it's possible. \n\nThus, for the reduced array of length 1, it's always possible. \n\nFor the reduced array of length 2: [x, y]. \n\nTo make them zero, you can first process the second element: subtract x from y until it's zero. \n\nThus, y must be divisible by x. \n\nThus, the condition is that y must be divisible by x. \n\nThus, the reduced array of length 2 is possible if and only if y is divisible by x. \n\nThus, the recursive condition is: \n\nThe array is possible if all elements are divisible by a_1, and the reduced array (a_2/a_1, a_3/a_1, ..., a_n/a_1) is possible. \n\nThe reduced array's possibility is determined recursively. \n\nThus, the condition is that the reduced array must be possible. \n\nThus, the problem can be solved recursively. \n\nFor the example [3,6,9], the reduced array is [2,3]. \n\nThe reduced array has length 2. \n\nTo be possible, 3 must be divisible by 2 \u2192 no. Thus, the answer is NO. \n\nFor the second sample's reduced array [2,3], the length is 2. \n\n3 is not divisible by 2 \u2192 thus, the reduced array is not possible. \n\nBut the sample's answer is YES. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nWait, the second sample's reduced array is [2,3]. \n\nThe recursive condition says it's not possible. But the sample's answer is YES. \n\nThus, the recursive condition is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe sample's solution involves processing the first element of the reduced array (2) first. \n\nWait, the reduced array is [2,3]. \n\nTo make the first element zero, you can't because it's the first element. \n\nWait, the first element of the reduced array is the second element of the original array divided by a_1. \n\nThe first element of the reduced array is x = a_2/a_1 = 2. \n\nThe second element is y = a_3/a_1 =3. \n\nTo make the reduced array's elements zero: \n\nWe can process the second element first. \n\nSubtract x (2) from y (3) once \u2192 1. \n\nThen process the first element: subtract a_0 (which is 1) from x (2) \u2192 1. \n\nThen process the second element again: subtract the new first element (1) from the second (1) \u2192 0. \n\nThen process the first element again: subtract 1 \u2192 0. \n\nThus, the reduced array can be reduced to zero. \n\nThus, the condition is not that y must be divisible by x. \n\nThus, the recursive approach must allow for processing the first element first. \n\nThus, the condition for the reduced array of length 2 is that the GCD of x and y is 1? \n\nNo, in this case, GCD(2,3) is 1. \n\nBut the example [2,3] can be reduced to zero. \n\nThus, the condition for the reduced array of length 2 is that the GCD of x and y is 1. \n\nWait, but the example [2,3] has GCD 1 and can be reduced. \n\nThe example [2,4] has GCD 2. \n\nCan it be reduced? \n\nYes: \n\nProcess the second element: subtract 2 from 4 \u2192 2. \n\nThen process the first element: subtract 2 from 2 \u2192 0. \n\nThen process the second element again: subtract 0 \u2192 no change. \n\nThus, the final array is [0,2]. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, after making the first element zero, the second element can't be reduced further. \n\nThus, it's not possible. \n\nThus, the condition is that the GCD of the entire array must be 1. \n\nIn the case of [2,4], GCD is 2 \u2192 not possible. \n\nIn the case of [2,3], GCD is 1 \u2192 possible. \n\nThus, the condition for the reduced array of length 2 is that the GCD of the two elements is 1. \n\nThus, the recursive condition is that the GCD of the reduced array must be 1. \n\nThus, the overall condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the GCD of the reduced array (a_i/a_1) is 1. \n\nWait, but in the example [3,6,9], the reduced array is [2,3]. GCD is 1 \u2192 thus, the condition would say it's possible, but it's not. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, the example [3,6,9] reduced array is [2,3]. \n\nThe GCD is 1. \n\nBut the original array can't be reduced to zero. \n\nWait, let's try to see: \n\nOriginal array: [3,6,9]. \n\nReduced array: [2,3]. \n\nThe reduced array's GCD is 1. \n\nThus, according to the condition, it should be possible. \n\nBut earlier analysis says it's not possible. \n\nLet me try to find a way to reduce it: \n\nProcess the second element (9) first. \n\nSubtract a_2 (6) from it once \u2192 3. \n\nNow the array is [3,6,3]. \n\nProcess the second element again: subtract 6 from 3 \u2192 can't. \n\nProcess the first element (6) by subtracting a_1 (3) twice \u2192 0. \n\nNow the array is [3,0,3]. \n\nNow, the third element is 3. \n\nProcess it by subtracting a_2 (0) \u2192 no change. \n\nThus, it's impossible. \n\nThus, the condition is not sufficient. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the GCD of the entire array must be a_1, and the GCD of the reduced array must be 1. \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], the GCD of the reduced array is 1, but it's impossible. \n\nThus, this is not sufficient. \n\nI'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the sequence of a_i/a_1 can be reduced to zero through the same operations. \n\nThis requires that the GCD of the reduced array is 1. \n\nBut in the example [3,6,9], the reduced array's GCD is 1, but it's impossible. \n\nThus, I'm missing something. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the sequence of a_i/a_1 must be such that the first element is the GCD of the entire sequence. \n\nIn the second sample's reduced array [2,3], the first element is 2, the GCD is 1 \u2192 no. \n\nThus, this is not. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1, and the sequence of a_i/a_1 must be such that the first element is the GCD of the entire sequence. \n\nIn the example [3,6,9], the reduced array's first element is 2, the GCD is 1 \u2192 no. \n\nThus, this is not. \n\nI think I need to look for another approach. \n\nThe problem's note says that the third test case's answer is possible. \n\nThe third test case's input is not given, but the note says that the answer is possible by choosing indices in the order 4,3,2. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that all elements are divisible by a_1. \n\nThe code's current approach is to check this condition. \n\nThe example [3,6,9] would return YES, but it's impossible. \n\nThus, the code is incorrect. \n\nBut the problem requires to fill in the missing parts of the code. \n\nThe code's current function diff_ops returns True if all elements are divisible by a_1. \n\nThe missing part is the code to read the test cases. \n\nThe code's current main part reads the input into input_arr, then tries to read the test cases but the code is missing. \n\nThe problem says that the input consists of multiple test cases. \n\nThe code's current main part has:\n\ntest_cases = []\n\npos =1 \n\nwhile pos <= len_input -1:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe code needs to read the test cases. \n\nThe first line is the number of test cases t. \n\nThen for each test case: \n\nThe first line is n, then the next line has n integers. \n\nBut the input is read as a single list. \n\nThe code's current input is read as input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())). \n\nThe first element is t. \n\nThen for each test case: \n\nThe first element is n, then the next n elements are the array. \n\nThus, the code should read the test cases as follows: \n\nAfter reading the first element (t), the pos starts at 1. \n\nThen for each test case: \n\nRead n from input_arr[pos], then read the next n elements as the array. \n\nAdd the array to test_cases. \n\nThen increment pos by n+1. \n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO is: \n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 +n]\n\n    test_cases.append(arr)\n\n    pos += n+1 \n\nBut the code's current loop is a while loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as: \n\npos =1 \n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 +n]\n\n    test_cases.append(arr)\n\n    pos += n+1 \n\nBut the code's current structure uses a while loop. \n\nThe code's current code is:\n\npos =1 \n\nwhile pos <= len_input -1:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThus, the missing code should be:\n\nn = input_arr[pos]\n\narr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 +n]\n\ntest_cases.append(arr)\n\npos += n+1 \n\nBut this needs to be in a loop that runs t times. \n\nWait, the first element of input_arr is t. \n\nThus, the code should first read t = input_arr[0]. \n\nThen, the loop runs for _ in range(t): \n\nThus, the code's current code has:\n\nn = input_arr[0]\n\ntest_cases = []\n\npos =1 \n\nwhile pos <= len_input -1:\n\n    # read each test case \n\n    current_n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    current_arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 + current_n]\n\n    test_cases.append(current_arr)\n\n    pos += current_n +1 \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\ncurrent_n = input_arr[pos]\n\ncurrent_arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 + current_n]\n\ntest_cases.append(current_arr)\n\npos += current_n +1 \n\nBut this needs to be in a loop that runs t times. \n\nAlternatively, the while loop continues until pos exceeds the input length. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nwhile pos <= len_input -1:\n\n    current_n = input_arr[pos]\n\n    current_arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 + current_n]\n\n    test_cases.append(current_arr)\n\n    pos += current_n +1 \n\nThus, the missing code is the above lines. \n\nThus, the code for program3's missing part is the loop to read the test cases. \n\nThe function diff_ops is incorrect, but the problem requires to fill in the missing parts of the code. \n\nThe problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output the missing code, not the entire program. \n\nThe missing code in program3 is the part inside the while loop to read the test cases. \n\nThus, the code for program3's missing part is:\n\ncurrent_n = input_arr[pos]\n\ncurrent_arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 + current_n]\n\ntest_cases.append(current_arr)\n\npos += current_n +1 \n\nBut this needs to be inside the while loop. \n\nThus, the code for the TODO is:\n\ncurrent_n = input_arr[pos]\n\ncurrent_arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 + current_n]\n\ntest_cases.append(current_arr)\n\npos += current_n +1 \n\nBut the while loop will run until pos exceeds the input length. \n\nThus, the missing code is the three lines inside the while loop. \n\nThus, the code for program3's missing part is the three lines above. \n\nThus, the three programs' missing parts are:\n\nProgram1: the else block's code to compute the sum. \n\nProgram2: the inv function. \n\nProgram3: the code to read the test cases. \n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nFor program1.py:\n\nThe missing code is in the else block:\n\nelse:\n\n    x = xy[0]\n\n    y = xy[1]\n\n    ans.append(prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1])\n\nThus, the code for program1 is:\n\nelse:\n\n    x, y = xy[0], xy[1]\n\n    ans.append(prices[x-1] - prices[x - y -1])\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nThe missing code is the inv function:\n\ndef inv(x):\n\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nFor program3.py:\n\nThe missing code is inside the while loop:\n\ncurrent_n = input_arr[pos]\n\ncurrent_arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 + current_n]\n\ntest_cases.append(current_arr)\n\npos += current_n +1 \n\nThus, the code for program3 is:\n\ncurrent_n = input_arr[pos]\n\ncurrent_arr = input_arr[pos+1 : pos+1 + current_n]\n\ntest_cases.append(current_arr)\n\npos += current_n +1 \n\nThus, the final answer is the JSON with these three parts."
