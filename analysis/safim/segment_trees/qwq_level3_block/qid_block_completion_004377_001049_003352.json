Wait, but how? Alternatively, for even v, it's better to divide by 2 (step count 1 + steps(v/2)). For odd v, you have to subtract 1 first (step count 1 + steps(v-1)). This is the same as the recurrence I had before. But in the case of v=2, the recurrence gives steps[2] = steps(1)+1 = 2, but the correct answer is 14. So the recurrence is not working. Hmm, this suggests that the recurrence is not considering the path of multiplying by 2 multiple times. Wait, the recurrence is considering steps(v) as the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nFor v=2, the path of multiplying by 2 14 times would require 14 steps. But according to the recurrence, steps(2) = min( steps(1)+1 (2), steps(1)+1 (same) \u2192 2. \n\nSo the recurrence is not considering the path of multiplying by 2. Ah!

So the recurrence is correct. So the steps for v=2 is 2 steps. So the recurrence is correct. So the problem with my earlier example was a misunderstanding. So the recurrence is correct. Thus, the dynamic programming approach with the recurrence steps[v] = min( steps[v-1]+1, steps[v//2]+1 if even else infinity ) \n\nThis can be computed using dynamic programming. Now, the order to compute steps is important. We can compute steps from 0 to 32767. Initialize steps array with steps[0] =0. For v from 1 to 32767:\n\nsteps[v] = steps[v-1] +1 \n\nif v is even:\n\n    steps[v] = min( steps[v], steps[v//2] +1 )\n\nThis way, for each v, we first consider the option of subtracting 1 (steps[v-1]+1), then if even, compare with dividing by 2 (steps[v//2]+1). This should work. Let's test this for v=2: steps[1] = steps[0]+1 =1 \n\nsteps[2] = steps[1]+1 =2 \n\nsince even, steps[2] = min(2, steps[1]+1 \u2192 2 \u2192 no change. So steps[2] is 2. For v=3:\n\nsteps[3] = steps[2]+1 =3 \n\nsince it's odd, no even option. So steps[3] is 3. For v=4:\n\nsteps[4] = steps[3]+1 =4 \n\nthen since even, steps[4//2=2] \u2192 steps[2] is 2 \u2192 steps[4] = min(4, 2+1=3 \u2192 so steps[4] is 3. \n\nWhich is correct: 4 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920 (3 steps). Yes. For v=19 (example):\n\nsteps[19] = steps[18]+1 \n\nsteps[18] = min( steps[17]+1, steps[9]+1 )\n\nsteps[9] = steps[8]+1 \u2192 steps[8] is 3 (steps[4] is 3 \u2192 steps[8] = min( steps[7]+1, steps[4]+1 \u2192 steps[7] is 7 \u2192 steps[4]+1 is 4 \u2192 steps[8] is 4? Wait, let's compute steps for 8:\n\nsteps[8] = steps[7]+1 = 8 (steps[7] is 7 \u2192 8 steps). But since even, steps[4] +1 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 so steps[8] is 4. So steps[9] = steps[8]+1 \u21925 \n\nsteps[18] = min( steps[17]+1 (18 steps), steps[9]+1 (6 steps) \u21926 \n\nsteps[18] is 6 \n\nsteps[19] =6+1=7 But the example says the minimal steps for 19 is 14. Wait, this is conflicting. Wait the example says for a_i=19, the minimal steps are 14. But according to this recurrence, steps[19] is 7. This suggests a problem. Wait what's the correct minimal steps for 19?",

Wait, the allowed operations are adding 1 or multiplying by 2. The minimal steps to reach 0 from v is the minimal number of steps using these operations. The BFS approach should consider all possible paths. The BFS should be done as follows: \n\nEach node is a value between 0 and 32767. The distance array is initialized to infinity except dist[0]=0. For each node u, the possible next nodes are: \n\nnext1 = (u+1) % 32768 \n\nnext2 = (2*u) % 32768 For each of these next nodes, if dist[next] > dist[u]+1, then update and add to the queue. This way, the BFS explores all possible paths and finds the minimal steps. This approach should work. Let me test this for v=2: \n\nThe BFS starts with 0. \n\n0's next nodes are 1 and 0. Processing 0: \n\ndist[0] is 0. next1 is 1 \u2192 dist[1] =1 \n\nnext2 is 0 \u2192 already 0. Then process 1: \n\nnext1 is 2 \u2192 dist[2] =2 \n\nnext2 is 2 \u2192 dist[2] is min(2, 1+1=2 \u2192 no change. So dist[2] is 2. \n\nWhich is correct.

Total steps:14. But how does the BFS find this path? The BFS would process nodes in order of their distance. The distance for 20 is 20 (steps via adding from 0). But the path from 19 to 20 is one step. So the distance for 20 can also be computed as distance[19]+1 =19+1=20. Then, the distance for 40 would be min(20+1 (21), or other paths). The path of multiplying from 20 would take 13 steps, but the distance for 0 would be 20+13=33. But the example's path is 14 steps. This suggests that the BFS approach is not finding the optimal path.

                                                                                                                                                                                                        "text": "When processing the predecessors of 0, we first process 0's predecessors. But to compute the distance for 20, we need to process the predecessors of 20. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the example for v=19: \n\nThe path to reach 0 from 19 is: \n\n19 \u219220 (add 1 \u2192 reverse step is subtract 1 from 20 to get 19) \n\n20 \u21920 via multiplying 13 times (reverse steps are dividing by 2 13 times). The reverse path is: \n\n19 \u219220 \u219210 \u21925 \u2192 ... \u21920 Wait, no. The reverse path for the example's path is: \n\nThe forward path is 19 \u219220 \u2192 multiply 13 times \u21920. The reverse path is: \n\n0 can be reached from 0 (multiply by 2) or from 1 (subtract 1). The path for 20 is: \n\n20 can be reached from 19 (subtract 1) or from 10 (multiply by 2). The minimal path for 20 is to divide by 2 13 times to reach 0. The distance for 20 would be 13 steps (dividing by 2 13 times). Then, the distance for 19 is 1 (step to 20) +13 steps \u219214 steps. Thus, the BFS approach should compute this. Let's see how this would work: \n\nThe BFS starts with 0 (distance 0). Process 0's predecessors: \n\nv1 =32767 \u2192 distance 1 \n\nv2 =0 \u2192 distance 0 (already processed) \n\nAdd 32767 to the queue. Next, process 32767 (distance 1): Its predecessors are 32766 (v1) and no v2 (since odd). Set distance[32766] =2 \n\nAdd to queue. Continue this until we reach 20. But this would take a long time. Alternatively, let's consider the path for 20: \n\nThe distance for 20 is the minimal steps to reach 0 from 20. The best path is dividing by 2 13 times (steps 13). The predecessors of 20 are 19 and 10. The distance for 20 can be computed as min( distance[19]+1, distance[10]+1 ). To get distance[20] =13, we need distance[10] to be 12. distance[10] = distance[5]+1 (since 10 is even \u2192 predecessor is 5). distance[5] = distance[2]+1 (since 5 is odd \u2192 predecessor is 4). distance[4] = distance[2]+1 \u2192 and so on. This suggests that the BFS approach will eventually compute the correct distance for 20 as 13 steps. Then, the distance for 19 would be min( distance[20]+1 (14), distance[9]+1 (if 19 is even? No, 19 is odd \u2192 only predecessor is 18). distance[18] would be distance[9]+1 \u2192 but this path would be longer than 14. Thus, the BFS approach should compute the correct distance of 14 for v=19. This suggests that the BFS approach using the reverse steps is correct. Thus, the correct way to compute the distance array is to use this BFS approach. Now, implementing this in code: \n\nWe can represent the distance array as an array of size 32768. Initialize all to -1 except dist[0] =0. Use a queue. Start with 0. For each node u in the queue: \n\n    compute its predecessors: \n\n    v1 = (u-1) % 32768 \n\n    v2 = u//2 if u is even \n\n    for each of these predecessors: \n\n        if dist[v] is not set or can be improved: \n\n            set dist[v] = dist[u]+1 \n\n            add to queue \n\nWait, but the predecessors are the nodes that can reach u in one step. Thus, the distance for v is dist[u]+1. This way, the BFS propagates the distance from 0 outward. The code would look like this: \n\nmax_v = 32768 \n\ndist = [inf] * max_v \n\ndist[0] =0 \n\nfrom collections import deque \n\nq = deque() \n\nq.append(0) \n\nwhile q: \n\n    u = q.popleft() \n\n    v1 = (u-1) % max_v \n\n    if dist[v1] > dist[u]+1: \n\n        dist[v1] = dist[u]+1 \n\n        q.append(v1) \n\n    if u %2 ==0: \n\n        v2 = u//2 \n\n        if dist[v2] > dist[u]+1: \n\n            dist[v2] = dist[u]+1 \n\n            q.append(v2) \n\nThis should compute the correct distances. Now, the code for program3.py needs to precompute this array and then process the input. The given code for program3.py is: \n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in s.split():\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is incorrect. The correct code should read the input properly. The correct way to read the input is: \n\nRead n from the first line. Read the next line as the list of a_i. Thus, the code should be something like: \n\nimport sys \n\ndef main(): \n\n    max_v = 32768 \n\n    # precompute dist array \n\n    dist = [float('inf')] * max_v \n\n    dist[0] =0 \n\n    q = deque() \n\n    q.append(0) \n\n    while q: \n\n        u = q.popleft() \n\n        v1 = (u-1) % max_v \n\n        if dist[v1] > dist[u]+1: \n\n            dist[v1] = dist[u]+1 \n\n            q.append(v1) \n\n        if u %2 ==0: \n\n            v2 = u//2 \n\n            if dist[v2] > dist[u]+1: \n\n                dist[v2] = dist[u]+1 \n\n                q.append(v2) \n\n    # read input \n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline()) \n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())) \n\n    for x in a: \n\n        print(dist[x]) But the given code for program3.py is incomplete. The user's code for program3.py starts with: \n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in s.split():\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is incorrect. The correct code should precompute the distance array first, then read the input. Thus, the missing code for program3.py is the precomputation of the distance array and the proper reading of the input. But the user's code for program3.py has the first line as n,s = open(0), which is incorrect. The correct code would involve precomputing the distance array first, then reading the input. However, the user's code for program3.py is given as: \n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in s.split():\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is probably incorrect.",

But the user's code for program3.py is incomplete, and the missing part is the precomputation and the input reading. But according to the problem statement, the user must fill in the missing lines or blocks. The code given for program3.py starts with: \n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in s.split():\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe first line is incorrect. The correct way to read the input is to read n from the first line, then the next line contains the a_i's. Thus, the missing code for program3.py should be the precomputation of the distance array and the proper input reading. But the user's code for program3.py has the first line as n,s = open(0), which is incorrect. The correct code would be something like: \n\nimport sys \n\ndef main(): \n\n    max_v = 32768 \n\n    # precompute dist array \n\n    dist = [float('inf')] * max_v \n\n    dist[0] =0 \n\n    from collections import deque \n\n    q = deque() \n\n    q.append(0) \n\n    while q: \n\n        u = q.popleft() \n\n        v1 = (u-1) % max_v \n\n        if dist[v1] > dist[u]+1: \n\n            dist[v1] = dist[u]+1 \n\n            q.append(v1) \n\n        if u %2 ==0: \n\n            v2 = u//2 \n\n            if dist[v2] > dist[u]+1: \n\n                dist[v2] = dist[u]+1 \n\n                q.append(v2) \n\n    # read input \n\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split() \n\n    n = int(data[0]) \n\n    a = list(map(int, data[1:n+1])) \n\n    for x in a: \n\n        print(dist[x]) But the user's code for program3.py is different.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. Starting with program1.py. The problem is to find the optimal cell in a matrix such that the maximum Manhattan distance to all black cells is minimized. \n\nLooking at the code provided for program1, I see that they're trying to compute some variables l1, l2, l3, l4. These might be related to the min and max of certain sums or differences of coordinates. The code then calculates r and c using those variables. But there's a loop at the end where they check nearby cells (i and j in -1,0,1) and compute the maximum distance. The missing part is the inner loop where for each (x,y) in the black cells, they need to compute the Manhattan distance from (cr, cc) to (x,y), then take the max of those, and compare to find the best.\n\nSo the missing code in the inner loop for (x,y) in b should be something like:\n\ncurrent_distance = abs(cr - x) + abs(cc - y)\nmadist = max(madist, current_distance)\n\nBut initially, madist is set to 0. Wait, that's a problem. Because if all distances are negative (which they can't be), but actually, the first distance would set it to that. Wait, no, since Manhattan distance is always non-negative. So initializing madist to 0 is okay, but then for each (x,y), we take the max between current and the distance. So the code should be:\n\nmadist = 0\nfor x,y in b:\n    d = abs(cr - x) + abs(cc - y)\n    if d > madist:\n        madist = d\n\nSo that's the missing part in the TODO block.\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to partition an array into subarrays such that the sum of their values is maximized. The value of a subarray is (length) if sum>0, 0 if sum=0, -length if sum<0. The code provided seems to be using some Fenwick trees and dynamic programming. The missing part is in the loop where after updating dp[i], they need to update the dmx dictionary if the current dp[i] is better than the existing value for that prefix sum. The comment says \"TODO: Your code here\".\n\nLooking at the code, dmx is a dictionary that probably keeps track of the maximum dp value for each prefix sum. So if dp[i] is greater than the existing value in dmx for pref[i], then we need to update dmx[pref[i]] to dp[i], and also update the Fenwick trees. The code might be:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n                # Also, need to update Fenwick trees here? Or maybe not, since the Fenwick trees are already modified in the next lines.\n\nWait, the code after the if statement is part of the loop. The Fenwick trees are being modified with the current dp[i] values. The dmx is probably to track the maximum dp for each sum, so that when the same sum occurs again, we don't need to keep lower values. So the code here would be:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nSo the missing line is dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nNow for program3.py. The problem is to find the minimum number of operations to reduce each a_i to 0. The allowed operations are increment by 1 mod 32768, or multiply by 2 mod 32768. Since 32768 is 2^15, perhaps we can precompute the steps for each possible value. \n\nThe code given starts with reading n and s, but the line \"n,s=open(0)\" might not be correct. Wait, in Python, open(0) reads from stdin. But splitting that would give the entire input as lines. The code for the loop is incomplete. The user needs to compute for each x (the a_i) the minimal steps. \n\nThe approach here is to precompute for each possible value (0 to 32767) the minimal steps required. Since 32768 is 2^15, perhaps we can work backwards. For each value v, the minimal steps can be found by considering the reverse operations. \n\nLet's think of it as BFS. For 0, steps are 0. For other numbers, we can see:\n\nIf v is even, then one possible path is to divide by 2 (reverse of multiply by 2). The steps would be 1 + steps(v/2). Alternatively, if you came via adding 1, then steps would be 1 + steps((v-1) mod 32768). But since we want the minimal steps, perhaps BFS is the way to go. \n\nAlternatively, precompute the steps for all values using dynamic programming. Let's create an array dp where dp[v] is the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0. For other values, we can compute it as follows:\n\nFor each v from 1 to 32767:\n\nOption 1: The last step was a multiply by 2. So previous value was v//2 if v is even, but only if v is even. Then steps would be 1 + dp[v//2].\n\nOption 2: The last step was an increment. So previous value was (v-1) mod 32768. Steps would be 1 + dp[(v-1)%32768].\n\nBut since we can also have other paths, we need to choose the minimal between these options. However, this approach might not capture all possibilities, so BFS is better.\n\nAlternatively, since the operations can be reversed, except for the mod, perhaps we can model it as a BFS starting from 0 and propagating steps. But since the mod complicates things, maybe it's better to precompute for all possible v.\n\nAlternatively, since the operations are mod 32768, which is a power of two, perhaps we can represent the number in binary and find the minimal steps by working backwards. \n\nLet me think of the reverse process. To reach 0 from v, we can reverse the operations. The reverse of multiply by 2 is dividing by 2 (if even). The reverse of adding 1 is subtracting 1 (mod 32768). \n\nSo for a given v, the minimal steps can be found by trying to divide by 2 as much as possible, or adding 1 until it's even, etc. \n\nAlternatively, for each v, the minimal steps can be found by considering the binary representation. Let's see:\n\nFor example, take v=19. The example says the minimal steps are 14. Let's see:\n\n19 \u2192 20 (add 1, 1 step), then multiply 13 times (each multiply by 2). 20 * 2^13 = 20 * 8192 = 163840 mod 32768. Wait, 2^15 is 32768, so 2^14 is 16384. 20 * 2^14 is 327680 mod 32768 is 0. So 13 multiplies (since 2^14 would be 14 steps?), but the example says 13 multiplies plus 1 step gives 14 total. So that works. \n\nAnother example: 32764. Adding 4 times to reach 32768 mod 32768 is 0. So 4 steps. \n\nSo the approach is to find for each number the minimal steps by considering the path of dividing by 2 as much as possible, or adding until it's even, etc. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all numbers up to 32767?\n\nWe can precompute the steps for all possible values using BFS. Since 32768 is manageable (only 32768 entries), this is feasible. \n\nLet me think of the BFS approach. We can create an array dist of size 32768, initialized to -1. Set dist[0] = 0. Then, for each value v in a queue, we can compute the possible previous steps. \n\nWait, but since we need to find the minimal steps to reach 0, perhaps we can model it as BFS from 0 and see how to reach other nodes. Wait, no, because the operations are additive and multiplicative. Alternatively, we can model the problem as starting from v and trying to reach 0 with minimal steps. \n\nAlternatively, let's model it as a graph where each node is a value from 0 to 32767. The edges are the reverse operations. For each node v, the possible predecessors are:\n\n- (v * 2) mod 32768 (reverse of multiply by 2)\n- (v -1) mod 32768 (reverse of adding 1)\n\nWait, no. The reverse of adding 1 would be subtracting 1. So the previous step could have been (v-1) mod 32768, then adding 1 to get to v. \n\nAlternatively, the reverse steps would be:\n\nTo reach v, the previous step could have been:\n\nEither:\n\n1. The last operation was a multiply by 2. So the previous value was (v // 2) if v is even. Because if you multiply by 2, you get v. So the previous value is v//2. \n\nOR \n\n2. The last operation was an increment. So the previous value was (v-1) mod 32768. \n\nSo for each v, the minimal steps would be 1 + min( steps of (v//2 if even), steps of (v-1 mod 32768) )\n\nBut this is a recursive approach, which might be slow for 3e4 numbers. \n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the steps using BFS. Let's start from 0 and propagate the steps. \n\nWait, but how? Let's think of the steps as the number of steps to reach 0. So for each node v, the distance is the minimal steps to reach 0. \n\nWe can model this as BFS starting from 0, and for each node, we can find the nodes that can reach it in one step. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in reverse. Let me think of the problem as starting from v and trying to reach 0. \n\nWe can use BFS where each node's distance is the minimal steps to reach 0. \n\nInitialize a distance array with all -1. Set dist[0] =0. \n\nWe can use a queue. Start with 0. \n\nFor each current node u, we can find all nodes that can reach u in one step. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the possible ways to reach it in one step are:\n\nEither:\n\n- v was obtained by adding 1 to (v-1 mod 32768). So the previous step was (v-1 mod 32768), then add 1. \n\nOR \n\n- v was obtained by multiplying some number by 2. So the previous number was (v//2) if v is even. \n\nWait, but the previous number could also be (v//2 + 32768) // 2? No, because mod 32768. \n\nHmm, perhaps the reverse approach is better. Let me think of the BFS as starting from 0 and propagating steps. \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach 0 from v is the same as the minimal steps to reach v from 0 using the reverse operations. \n\nWait, no. Because the allowed operations are adding 1 or multiplying by 2. The reverse operations would be subtracting 1 or dividing by 2 (if even). \n\nAlternatively, the BFS can be done starting from 0, and for each step, we can generate all possible next nodes via the allowed operations. But since we want to reach v from 0, but the problem is to reach 0 from v, this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as a BFS where we start from each v and try to reach 0. But doing this for all v would be O(N^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHence, the BFS approach must be done in a way that propagates from 0 outward. \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nThe minimal steps to reach 0 from v is the same as the minimal steps to reach v from 0 using the reverse operations. \n\nWait, no. Because the allowed operations are adding 1 or multiplying by 2. The reverse operations would be subtracting 1 or dividing by 2 (if even). \n\nSo, to find the minimal steps from v to 0, we can model it as a BFS where each node can transition via the reverse operations. \n\nLet me think of the BFS as starting from v and trying to reach 0. \n\nThe BFS would proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize a distance array dist where dist[v] is the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nSet dist[0] =0. \n\nWe can use a queue. \n\nFor each node u in the queue, we can find all nodes that can reach u in one step via the reverse operations. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of the transitions as:\n\nFor each node u, the possible previous nodes (in the reverse path) are:\n\n1. u-1 mod 32768 (since adding 1 to u-1 gives u). \n\n2. (u * 2) mod 32768 (since multiplying by 2 gives u only if u is even? Wait no. Wait, if the previous step was multiplying by 2, then the previous value would be u//2 if u is even. \n\nWait, the reverse of multiplying by 2 is dividing by 2. So if you have a value v, then the previous step could have been v//2 (if v is even). \n\nSo for each node u, the possible predecessors in the reverse path are:\n\n- (u -1) mod 32768 (if the last step was adding 1)\n\n- (u // 2) if u is even (if the last step was multiplying by 2)\n\nSo, to compute the distance for all nodes, we can start from 0 and propagate the distances. \n\nWait, but how? Let me think of it as a BFS where we start from 0 and for each node, we can reach nodes that can be reached via the forward operations. \n\nWait, the forward operations from a node u are:\n\n- u+1 mod 32768 (add 1)\n\n- (2*u) mod 32768 (multiply by 2)\n\nSo, the distance from u to 0 is the minimal steps. \n\nAlternatively, the BFS can be done in reverse. Let me think of the problem as starting from 0 and trying to reach all other nodes, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem as a BFS where we start from all nodes and find the minimal steps to reach 0. \n\nBut doing this for each node individually would be O(N^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the BFS can be done in a way that propagates the distance from 0 outward. \n\nWait, here's an alternative approach. Let's precompute the distance for all nodes using BFS. \n\nInitialize a distance array with all -1 except dist[0] =0. \n\nWe can use a queue and start with 0. \n\nFor each node u in the queue, we can compute the nodes that can reach u in one reverse step. \n\nWait, the reverse steps are:\n\nThe predecessors of u are (u-1) mod 32768 and (u//2) if even. \n\nWait, no. The predecessors are the nodes that can reach u in one step via the forward operations. \n\nWait, the forward operations from a node v can lead to u. So the predecessors of u in the reverse path are the nodes v such that v can reach u in one step. \n\nSo the predecessors are:\n\nv1 = (u-1) mod 32768 (since adding 1 to v1 gives u)\n\nv2 = (u//2) if u is even (since multiplying v2 by 2 gives u)\n\nSo for each u, the predecessors are v1 and v2 (if applicable). \n\nTherefore, to compute the distance for all nodes, we can start from 0 and propagate the distance to its predecessors. \n\nWait, but how? Let me think of it as a BFS where we start from 0 and for each node, we can find the nodes that can reach it in one step (i.e., the predecessors). \n\nWait, perhaps the BFS should be done in reverse. Let me think of the distance as the minimal steps to reach 0. \n\nInitialize dist[0] =0. \n\nFor each node u, the distance can be computed as 1 + min( dist of predecessors). \n\nBut to compute this efficiently, we can use a BFS-like approach where we process nodes in order of their distance. \n\nAlternatively, here's a way to compute it using BFS:\n\nInitialize a queue with 0. \n\nFor each node u in the queue, we can compute the possible next nodes in the reverse path (i.e., the nodes that can reach u in one step). \n\nWait, perhaps the BFS should be done in the reverse direction. Let me think of the transitions as follows:\n\nEach node u can reach its next nodes via the forward operations. \n\nThe distance from u to 0 is the minimal steps. \n\nSo, to compute the distance for all nodes, we can start from 0 and propagate the distance. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the BFS can be done as follows:\n\nInitialize dist array with all infinity except dist[0] =0. \n\nUse a queue. \n\nFor each node u in the queue, we can consider the nodes that can be reached from u via the forward operations (u+1 mod 32768 and 2*u mod 32768). \n\nFor each such node v, if dist[v] > dist[u] +1, then set dist[v] = dist[u]+1 and add to the queue. \n\nThis way, the BFS propagates the minimal steps from 0 to all other nodes. \n\nWait, but this is the minimal steps to reach v from 0 using the forward operations. But the problem requires the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nAh, right, so this approach would give the steps from 0 to v, but we need the steps from v to 0. \n\nHmm, so this approach is not correct. \n\nAlternative idea: Let's model the problem as starting from each v and trying to reach 0. \n\nThe minimal steps can be found by considering the reverse operations. \n\nLet me think of the problem as a BFS where each node's distance is the minimal steps to reach 0. \n\nInitialize dist[0] =0. \n\nFor all other nodes, we can compute their distance by considering their possible predecessors. \n\nThe predecessors of a node v are:\n\n- (v-1) mod 32768 (since adding 1 to this gives v, so the reverse step is subtracting 1)\n\n- (v//2) if v is even (since multiplying this by 2 gives v, so the reverse step is dividing by 2)\n\nSo, for each node v, the minimal distance is 1 + min( dist of predecessors). \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nWe can use a BFS approach where we process nodes in order of their distance. \n\nStart with 0. \n\nThen, for each node u, when we process it, we can look at the nodes that can reach u in one step (i.e., the nodes v where u is a predecessor of v). \n\nWait, perhaps the BFS should be done in reverse. Let me think of the transitions as follows:\n\nEach node v can be reached from its predecessors (v-1 mod 32768 and v//2 if even). \n\nSo, the distance of v is 1 + min( distance of (v-1 mod 32768), distance of (v//2 if even) )\n\nBut this requires that those predecessors have their distances computed first. \n\nThis suggests a BFS approach where we start from 0 and propagate the distance to nodes that can be reached via the reverse steps. \n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nInitialize a distance array with all -1 except dist[0] =0. \n\nUse a queue and start with 0. \n\nFor each node u in the queue, we can compute the nodes that can be reached via the forward steps (i.e., the nodes that can be reached from u in one step). \n\nWait, but how does that help? \n\nAlternatively, for each node u, the nodes that can reach u in one reverse step are its predecessors. \n\nWait, perhaps the BFS should be done in the following way:\n\nFor each node u, when we process it, we can look at the nodes that can reach u via the reverse steps (i.e., the nodes that can be predecessors of u). \n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of it as a BFS where the distance is the minimal steps to reach 0. \n\nThe distance for a node v is the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nThe base case is dist[0] =0. \n\nFor other nodes, the distance can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal steps to reach 0 from v is 1 plus the minimal steps from any of its predecessors. \n\nThe predecessors are (v-1 mod 32768) and (v//2 if even). \n\nSo, for each v, dist[v] = 1 + min( dist[ (v-1) mod 32768 ], dist[ v//2 ] if even else infinity )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nWe can use a BFS-like approach where we process nodes in order of their distance. \n\nStart with 0. \n\nThen, for each node u, we can look at the nodes that can reach u via a reverse step. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to do this is to process nodes in a way that when we have the distance for a node u, we can update the distance for nodes that can reach u in one step. \n\nWait, let me think of it as follows:\n\nEach node v can be reached from its predecessors (v-1 and v//2 if even). \n\nSo, the distance of v is 1 + min( distance of (v-1), distance of (v//2) if even )\n\nSo, to compute this, we can use a BFS approach where we process nodes in order of their distance. \n\nInitialize all distances to infinity except 0. \n\nSet a queue with 0. \n\nThen, for each node u in the queue, we can look at the nodes that can be reached from u via forward steps (i.e., the nodes that can be reached by adding 1 or multiplying by 2). \n\nWait, perhaps the forward steps from u can be considered as the nodes that can be reached in one step from u. \n\nWait, the forward steps from u are:\n\nnext1 = (u +1) mod 32768 \n\nnext2 = (2*u) mod 32768 \n\nThese are the nodes that can be reached from u in one step. \n\nThe distance to reach 0 from next1 would be 1 + distance[u], since you can go from next1 to u (reverse step) and then to 0. \n\nWait, no. The distance for next1 would be 1 + distance[u], because to reach 0 from next1, you can take the step to u (reverse step) and then the steps from u to 0. \n\nSo, the distance for next1 is 1 + distance[u]. \n\nSimilarly for next2. \n\nTherefore, the BFS can be done as follows:\n\nInitialize dist[0] =0. \n\nFor all other nodes, set dist to infinity. \n\nUse a queue. \n\nStart with 0. \n\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n\n    u = dequeue()\n\n    for each next in [ (u+1) mod 32768, (2*u) mod 32768 ]:\n\n        if dist[next] > dist[u] +1:\n\n            dist[next] = dist[u]+1\n\n            enqueue(next)\n\nThis way, the distance array will store the minimal steps to reach 0 from each node. \n\nWait, this makes sense! Because the forward steps from u are the steps you can take from u to reach next nodes. The distance to reach 0 from next is the distance from u plus 1 (since you can go from next to u in one reverse step, then proceed). \n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance for next is the minimal steps to reach 0 from next. \n\nIf you can reach next via a forward step from u, then the path from next to 0 can be next \u2192 u \u2192 ... \u21920, which takes 1 (step from next to u) plus the distance of u. \n\nHence, the distance for next is min( current distance[next], 1 + distance[u] )\n\nSo this BFS approach should work. \n\nYes! So this way, the BFS propagates the minimal steps correctly. \n\nNow, since 32768 is manageable (only 32768 nodes), this is feasible. \n\nSo the code for program3.py would precompute this distance array. \n\nNow, the code given for program3.py starts with:\n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in s.split():\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the first line is probably incorrect. Because in Python, open(0) reads from stdin as a file. So the first line would read the entire input as a file object. But the code is written as n,s = open(0), which would assign the file object to n and s? That's not correct. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to read the input. Let me think. The correct way to read the inputs would be:\n\nRead n from the first line, then the second line has n numbers. \n\nThe code given for program3.py is incomplete. The user needs to read the inputs properly and then for each a_i, output the precomputed distance. \n\nSo the correct code would first precompute the distance array using BFS as above, then read the inputs and output the distances. \n\nSo the steps for program3 are:\n\n1. Precompute the distance array for all 0..32767.\n\n2. Read n, then the list of a_i's, and for each, output distance[a_i].\n\nNow, implementing this in code. \n\nThe code given for program3 starts with:\n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in s.split():\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, that's probably wrong. Because open(0) returns a file object. So perhaps the code should read the first line as n, then the second line as the list of a_i. \n\nAlternatively, the code should read all the input first. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    # precompute the distance array\n    # then for each x in a, print dist[x]\n\nBut the user's code for program3 is incomplete. The missing part is the code to precompute the distance array and then process the input. \n\nSo the code for program3.py should first precompute the distance array. \n\nLet me outline the code steps for program3:\n\nFirst, precompute the distance array:\n\nmax_v = 32768\n\ndist = [infinity] * max_v\n\ndist[0] =0 \n\nfrom collections import deque \n\nq = deque()\n\nq.append(0)\n\nwhile q is not empty:\n\n    u = q.popleft()\n\n    for each next in (u+1) % max_v, (2*u) % max_v:\n\n        if dist[next] > dist[u]+1:\n\n            dist[next] = dist[u]+1\n\n            q.append(next)\n\nWait, but this might not cover all nodes. Because for some nodes, the minimal path might come from the other direction (like subtracting 1). \n\nWait, no. Because the BFS is propagating forward steps. For example, the node 1 can be reached from 0 via adding 1. So dist[1] =1. \n\nBut what about a node like 32767? To reach 0 from it, the best path is to add 1 (32767+1 mod 32768 is 0, so one step. So dist[32767] should be 1. \n\nIn the BFS approach above, when processing 0, the next nodes are 1 and 0 (since 2*0 mod 32768 is 0). \n\nWait, 2*0 mod 32768 is 0, so the next nodes for 0 are 1 and 0. \n\nBut 0 is already in the queue. \n\nSo when processing 0, the next nodes are 1 and 0. \n\nThe 0 is already processed, so when we process 1, we can generate next nodes 2 and 2 mod 32768 (2). \n\nWait, but for 32767, the path would be adding 1 to get to 0. So the distance is 1. \n\nIn the BFS approach, when processing 32766, the next nodes would be 32767 and (2*32766 mod 32768). \n\nWait, but how does 32767 get its distance? \n\nThe BFS starts at 0. \n\nThe first step processes 0, which adds 1 and 0 (but 0 is already in the queue). \n\nThen, when processing 1, the next nodes are 2 and 2 (since 2*1=2 mod 32768). \n\nContinuing this way, the BFS will eventually reach all nodes via forward steps. \n\nWait, but for 32767, the minimal path is to add 1, which is one step. \n\nThe BFS would reach 32767 via the path 0 \u21921 \u21922 \u2192 ... \u219232766 \u219232767. \n\nThe distance for 32767 would be 32767 steps (since each step adds 1). But that's not optimal. \n\nAh, here's the problem. The BFS approach as described is not considering the reverse steps. \n\nWait, the BFS approach I outlined earlier is incorrect. Because it only considers the forward steps (adding 1 or multiplying by 2), but the minimal path might involve dividing by 2 (reverse step) when possible. \n\nFor example, take v=2. The minimal steps are 2 (add 1 twice to get to 0?), no. Wait, 2 can be multiplied by 2 to get 4, but that's not helpful. Wait, the minimal steps for 2 would be to multiply by 2 until it wraps around. \n\nWait, let's think of v=2. \n\nOption 1: add 1 32766 times to reach 0. That's 32766 steps. \n\nOption 2: multiply by 2 until it reaches 0. \n\n2 \u21924 \u21928 \u2192 ... \u2192 2^14 = 16384 \u2192 2^15 mod 32768 is 0. \n\nSo 15 steps (since 2*2^14 = 2^15 mod 32768 is 0. So 15 steps of multiply. \n\nSo the minimal steps for 2 is 15 steps. \n\nBut the BFS approach I described earlier would compute the distance as 2 (steps via adding 1 twice to reach 0?), but that's not correct. \n\nWait, no. The BFS approach I described earlier is propagating forward steps. So for v=2, the distance would be computed as follows:\n\nThe BFS starts at 0. \n\n0's next nodes are 1 and 0. \n\nProcessing 1: next nodes are 2 and 2 (since 2*1=2 mod 32768). \n\nSo when processing 1, the distance for 2 is set to 2 (distance[1] +1 =1+1=2). \n\nBut the correct minimal steps for 2 is 15 (multiply 15 times). \n\nSo the BFS approach is not working. \n\nAh, right! The BFS approach I thought of is incorrect because it only considers the forward steps (adding 1 or multiplying by 2), but the minimal path might involve dividing by 2 (reverse step) when possible. \n\nSo the BFS approach I thought of is not correct. \n\nHmm, so I need to think of a different approach. \n\nAlternative idea: For each number v, the minimal steps can be found by working backwards. \n\nLet me think recursively. \n\nThe minimal steps for v is the minimum between:\n\n1. 1 + steps(v-1 mod 32768) (if we subtract 1 first)\n\nOR \n\n2. If v is even, 1 + steps(v//2) (if we divide by 2 first)\n\nOR \n\n3. The other option is to add 1 until it's even, then divide by 2, etc. \n\nWait, but this is a recursive approach which would be too slow for 3e4 numbers. \n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the steps for all v using dynamic programming with memoization. \n\nBut even that might be feasible for 32768 numbers. \n\nLet me try to think of the steps for v as follows:\n\nThe minimal steps for v can be computed as follows:\n\nIf v is 0, steps is 0. \n\nElse:\n\nOption 1: subtract 1 (steps is 1 + steps(v-1 mod 32768))\n\nOption 2: if v is even, divide by 2 (steps is 1 + steps(v//2))\n\nWe choose the minimum between these options. \n\nBut for odd numbers, option 2 is not available. \n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\nsteps(v) = min( steps(v-1) +1, (steps(v//2)+1 if even else infinity) )\n\nThis can be computed using dynamic programming. \n\nWe can compute steps for all v from 0 to 32767 in order. \n\nBut what order to process them? \n\nWe can process them in reverse order, from 32767 down to 0. \n\nWait, no. Because steps(v) depends on steps(v-1) and steps(v//2). \n\nSo processing from 0 upwards may not work. \n\nAlternatively, process in order of increasing v. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsteps[0] =0 \n\nFor v=1:\n\nsteps[1] = min( steps(0)+1, ... (since it's odd, no option 2) \u2192 1 \n\nv=2:\n\nsteps[2] = min( steps(1)+1=2, steps(1)+1 (since 2//2=1 \u2192 steps(1)+1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 same as first option. \n\nWait, but the minimal steps for 2 is 15 (as earlier example). \n\nHmm, this approach is not working. \n\nWait, what's the minimal steps for v=2?\n\nThe optimal path is to multiply by 2 14 times (since 2*2^14 = 2^15 mod 32768 is 0. So 14 steps of multiply. \n\nWait, 2 \u21924 \u21928 \u2192 ... \u2192 32768 mod 32768 is 0. \n\nWait, 2^15 is 32768, so multiplying 14 times (since 2^1 (2) \u2192 2^2 (4) \u2192 ... \u2192 2^15 is 32768 mod 32768 is 0. So 14 steps. \n\nSo steps[2] should be 14. \n\nBut according to the recurrence above, steps[2] would be min( steps(1)+1 (2), steps(1)+1 (same) \u2192 2. Which is wrong. \n\nSo the recurrence is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the recurrence is not considering the path of multiplying by 2 multiple times. \n\nThe issue is that the recurrence only considers one step back, but the optimal path might involve multiple steps of dividing by 2. \n\nSo the recurrence needs to consider all possible paths. \n\nAlternative idea: \n\nThe minimal steps for v can be found by considering the binary representation of v. \n\nLet me think of the steps required to reach 0 by dividing by 2 as much as possible. \n\nFor example, for v=2, the best path is to multiply by 2 14 times (since 2^15 mod 32768 is 0). \n\nThe number of steps is 14. \n\nFor v=3, the best path is to subtract 1 (steps 1) to get to 2, then multiply 14 times (total 15 steps). \n\nAlternatively, subtract 1 three times to get to 0 (3 steps). \n\nWait, subtracting 3 times would give 0 in 3 steps. That's better. \n\nSo the minimal steps for 3 is 3. \n\nHmm, so the optimal path depends on whether it's better to subtract until reaching 0 or to multiply until reaching a power of two. \n\nThis suggests that the minimal steps can be found by considering both options: \n\nEither subtract until reaching 0 (steps v steps), \n\nOr subtract until reaching an even number, then divide by 2, and repeat. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be computed by finding the minimal steps between the path of subtracting all the way, or the path of dividing by 2 as much as possible. \n\nLet me think of the following approach for a given v:\n\nOption 1: subtract 1 v times \u2192 steps v. \n\nOption 2: find the highest power of 2 that divides v. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps can be computed as follows:\n\nFor v, the minimal steps is the minimum between:\n\n- v (subtract all the way)\n\n- the number of steps required to reach a power of two and then multiply until 0. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, for even v, it's better to divide by 2 (step count 1 + steps(v/2)). \n\nFor odd v, you have to subtract 1 first (step count 1 + steps(v-1)). \n\nThis is the same as the recurrence I had before. \n\nBut in the case of v=2, the recurrence gives steps[2] = steps(1)+1 = 2, but the correct answer is 14. \n\nSo the recurrence is not working. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the recurrence is not considering the path of multiplying by 2 multiple times. \n\nWait, the recurrence is considering steps(v) as the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nFor v=2, the path of multiplying by 2 14 times would require 14 steps. \n\nBut according to the recurrence, steps(2) = min( steps(1)+1 (2), steps(1)+1 (same) \u2192 2. \n\nSo the recurrence is not considering the path of multiplying by 2. \n\nAh! Because the recurrence is based on the reverse steps. \n\nThe recurrence assumes that the last step must be either subtracting 1 or dividing by 2. \n\nBut the path of multiplying by 2 multiple times is a forward path, not a reverse path. \n\nWait, the recurrence is for the reverse path. \n\nThe steps(v) is the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nThe path of multiplying by 2 multiple times is a forward path (i.e., you multiply by 2 each step until you reach 0). \n\nBut in terms of reverse steps, this path would be dividing by 2 each step until reaching 0. \n\nWait, the path of multiplying by 2 14 times from v=2 is equivalent to the reverse path of dividing by 2 14 times. \n\nSo for v=2, the reverse path would be dividing by 2 14 times. \n\nBut how does that fit into the recurrence? \n\nThe steps for v=2 would be 1 (divide by 2) + steps(1). \n\nSteps(1) is 1 (divide by 2 is not possible, so subtract 1 to get 0). \n\nWait, steps(1) would be 1 (subtract 1). \n\nSo steps(2) would be 1 (divide) + steps(1) (1) \u2192 total 2 steps. \n\nBut the actual path of multiplying by 2 14 times requires 14 steps. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nAh! I see the problem now. \n\nThe reverse path for multiplying by 2 multiple times is not possible because dividing by 2 repeatedly from 2 would give 1, then 0.5 (which is not an integer). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the reverse path for multiplying by 2 is dividing by 2. \n\nSo for v=2, the reverse path is dividing by 2 to get 1, then subtract 1 to get 0. \n\nThat's two steps. \n\nBut the forward path of multiplying by 2 14 times would take 14 steps. \n\nSo the minimal path is the reverse path of dividing by 2 and subtracting, which takes 2 steps. \n\nWait, but that's not possible. \n\nWait, the forward path for v=2 is:\n\n2 \u21924 \u21928 \u2192 ... \u2192 32768 mod 32768 is 0. \n\nEach step is multiply by 2. \n\nThe number of steps needed is 14 steps (since 2*2^14 = 2^15 mod 32768 is 0). \n\nBut the reverse path would be dividing by 2 each step until reaching 1, then subtract 1. \n\nSo the reverse path steps are:\n\n2 \u21921 (divide by 2) \u21920 (subtract 1). \n\nThat's two steps. \n\nSo the minimal steps for v=2 is 2 steps. \n\nBut earlier I thought it was 14 steps. \n\nAh! I made a mistake earlier. \n\nThe minimal steps for v=2 is indeed 2 steps: \n\nDivide by 2 (step 1) to get 1, then subtract 1 (step 2) to get 0. \n\nSo the recurrence is correct. \n\nMy earlier mistake was thinking that multiplying by 2 would be the path, but the reverse path is better. \n\nSo the recurrence is correct. \n\nSo the steps for v=2 is 2 steps. \n\nSo the recurrence is correct. \n\nSo the problem with my earlier example was a misunderstanding. \n\nSo the recurrence is correct. \n\nThus, the dynamic programming approach with the recurrence steps[v] = min( steps[v-1]+1, steps[v//2]+1 if even else infinity ) \n\nThis can be computed using dynamic programming. \n\nNow, the order to compute steps is important. \n\nWe can compute steps from 0 to 32767. \n\nInitialize steps array with steps[0] =0. \n\nFor v from 1 to 32767:\n\nsteps[v] = steps[v-1] +1 \n\nif v is even:\n\n    steps[v] = min( steps[v], steps[v//2] +1 )\n\nThis way, for each v, we first consider the option of subtracting 1 (steps[v-1]+1), then if even, compare with dividing by 2 (steps[v//2]+1). \n\nThis should work. \n\nLet's test this for v=2:\n\nsteps[1] = steps[0]+1 =1 \n\nsteps[2] = steps[1]+1 =2 \n\nsince even, steps[2] = min(2, steps[1]+1 \u2192 2 \u2192 no change. \n\nSo steps[2] is 2. \n\nFor v=3:\n\nsteps[3] = steps[2]+1 =3 \n\nsince it's odd, no even option. \n\nSo steps[3] is 3. \n\nFor v=4:\n\nsteps[4] = steps[3]+1 =4 \n\nthen since even, steps[4//2=2] \u2192 steps[2] is 2 \u2192 steps[4] = min(4, 2+1=3 \u2192 so steps[4] is 3. \n\nWhich is correct: 4 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920 (3 steps). \n\nYes. \n\nFor v=19 (example):\n\nsteps[19] = steps[18]+1 \n\nsteps[18] = min( steps[17]+1, steps[9]+1 )\n\nsteps[9] = steps[8]+1 \u2192 steps[8] is 3 (steps[4] is 3 \u2192 steps[8] = min( steps[7]+1, steps[4]+1 \u2192 steps[7] is 7 \u2192 steps[4]+1 is 4 \u2192 steps[8] is 4? \n\nWait, let's compute steps for 8:\n\nsteps[8] = steps[7]+1 = 8 (steps[7] is 7 \u2192 8 steps). \n\nBut since even, steps[4] +1 \u2192 3+1=4 \u2192 so steps[8] is 4. \n\nSo steps[9] = steps[8]+1 \u21925 \n\nsteps[18] = min( steps[17]+1 (18 steps), steps[9]+1 (6 steps) \u21926 \n\nsteps[18] is 6 \n\nsteps[19] =6+1=7 \n\nBut the example says the minimal steps for 19 is 14. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. \n\nWait the example says for a_i=19, the minimal steps are 14. \n\nBut according to this recurrence, steps[19] is 7. \n\nThis suggests a problem. \n\nWait what's the correct minimal steps for 19? \n\nThe example says:\n\n19 \u219220 (add 1, 1 step), then multiply 13 times (13 steps) \u2192 total 14 steps. \n\nBut according to the recurrence, the minimal steps would be 7 steps via the reverse path. \n\nLet me see what the reverse path would be for 19:\n\nThe reverse path would be subtracting 1 each step until reaching 0. \n\nsteps[19] = steps[18]+1 \u2192 steps[18] is 6 \u2192 steps[19] =7. \n\nThe path would be 19 \u219218 \u219217 \u2192 ... \u21920, which is 19 steps. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait the steps array is computed as follows:\n\nsteps[v] is the minimal steps to reach 0 from v via the reverse path (subtracting or dividing). \n\nThe example's path is a forward path of adding and multiplying. \n\nThe reverse path for the example's path would be:\n\n0 is reached via multiplying 13 times (reverse is dividing by 2 13 times) from 20, then subtracting 1 from 20 to get 19. \n\nSo the reverse path for 19 would be:\n\n19 \u219220 (add 1 \u2192 reverse is subtract 1? No, the reverse path is the path from v to 0. \n\nWait, the example's path is forward steps: \n\n19 \u219220 (add 1) \u2192 multiply 13 times \u2192 20 * 2^13 mod 32768. \n\nWait 2^15 is 32768 mod 32768 is 0. \n\n20 * 2^13 = 20 * 8192 = 163840 mod 32768 is 163840 - 5*32768 = 163840-163840=0. \n\nSo after 13 multiplies, it reaches 0. \n\nTotal steps: 1+13=14. \n\nThe reverse path for this path would be: \n\n0 is reached via multiplying 13 times from 20, then subtracting 1 from 20 to get 19. \n\nSo the reverse path for 19 is: \n\n19 \u219220 (add 1 \u2192 reverse is subtract 1? No, the reverse path is the path from 19 to 0. \n\nThe reverse path would be: \n\n19 \u219220 (reverse of adding 1 is subtracting 1 from 20 to get 19. \n\nThen, the path from 20 to 0 is 13 steps of dividing by 2. \n\nSo the total steps for 19 would be 1 (subtract 1 from 20 to get 19) plus 13 steps from 20 to 0 \u2192 total 14 steps. \n\nBut according to the recurrence, steps[19] is 7 steps. \n\nThis suggests that the recurrence is not considering this path. \n\nAh! Because the recurrence only considers the path of subtracting 1 or dividing by 2. \n\nThe path of adding 1 (forward) is not considered in the reverse path. \n\nThe reverse path for the example's path is not considered in the recurrence. \n\nThe recurrence only considers the reverse steps (subtracting or dividing), but the example's path uses an add step (forward) which is not considered in the reverse path. \n\nSo the recurrence is not considering the possibility of adding 1 in the forward path. \n\nThis is the crux of the problem. \n\nThe recurrence is based on the reverse steps (subtracting or dividing), but the forward steps (adding or multiplying) can also be used. \n\nThe minimal steps can be achieved by either path. \n\nThe recurrence only considers the reverse steps, but the forward steps (like adding) can lead to shorter paths. \n\nThus, the recurrence is not sufficient. \n\nThis means that the problem requires considering both forward and reverse paths. \n\nThis complicates things. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe minimal steps can be found by considering both options: \n\nEither subtract until reaching 0 (steps v), \n\nOr find the minimal steps by finding the closest power of two and then dividing. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be computed by considering the binary representation of v. \n\nLet me think of the following approach for a given v: \n\nThe minimal steps are the minimum between: \n\n1. v (subtract all the way). \n\n2. The number of steps required to reach a power of two and then divide down. \n\nFor example, for v=19: \n\nThe closest power of two greater than 19 is 32 (2^5). \n\nTo reach 32 from 19 requires adding 13 times (steps 13), then dividing by 2 five times (steps 5). Total steps 13+5=18, which is worse than the example's 14. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the example's path uses adding 1 to reach 20 (steps 1), then multiplying 13 times (steps 13). \n\nTotal steps 14. \n\nThe path of subtracting 19 times would be 19 steps. \n\nThe example's path is better. \n\nSo the minimal steps can be found by finding the minimal steps between subtracting all the way, or adding to reach a number that can be divided down to 0 with fewer steps. \n\nThis suggests that the problem requires considering both directions. \n\nThis is getting quite complex. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to precompute the steps for all v using BFS where the allowed steps are both forward and reverse. \n\nWait, the allowed operations are adding 1 or multiplying by 2. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach 0 from v is the minimal number of steps using these operations. \n\nThe BFS approach should consider all possible paths. \n\nThe BFS should be done as follows: \n\nEach node is a value between 0 and 32767. \n\nThe distance array is initialized to infinity except dist[0]=0. \n\nFor each node u, the possible next nodes are: \n\nnext1 = (u+1) % 32768 \n\nnext2 = (2*u) % 32768 \n\nFor each of these next nodes, if dist[next] > dist[u]+1, then update and add to the queue. \n\nThis way, the BFS explores all possible paths and finds the minimal steps. \n\nThis approach should work. \n\nLet me test this for v=2: \n\nThe BFS starts with 0. \n\n0's next nodes are 1 and 0. \n\nProcessing 0: \n\ndist[0] is 0. \n\nnext1 is 1 \u2192 dist[1] =1 \n\nnext2 is 0 \u2192 already 0. \n\nThen process 1: \n\nnext1 is 2 \u2192 dist[2] =2 \n\nnext2 is 2 \u2192 dist[2] is min(2, 1+1=2 \u2192 no change. \n\nSo dist[2] is 2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nFor v=19: \n\nThe BFS would find the path 19 \u219220 \u219240 \u219280 \u2192 ... \u2192 32768 mod 32768 is 0. \n\nWait, but 20 * 2^13 is 20*8192 = 163840 mod 32768 is 163840 - 5*32768 = 163840-163840=0. \n\nSo the steps would be 1 (add to 20) +13 (multiply) \u219214 steps. \n\nThe BFS should find this path. \n\nLet's see how the BFS would compute dist[19]: \n\nThe BFS starts at 0. \n\nThe path to 19 would be: \n\n0 \u21921 \u21922 \u2192 ... \u219219 (steps 19). \n\nBut there's a shorter path via adding 1 to 20 and then multiplying. \n\nThe BFS would also explore the path: \n\n0 \u21921 \u21922 \u2192 ... \u219219 \u219220 (steps 20). \n\nThen from 20, multiply steps: \n\n20 \u219240 \u219280 \u2192 ... \u2192 20*2^13 mod 32768 is 0. \n\nThe steps for 20 would be 1 (from 19) +13 steps of multiply \u2192 total 14 steps. \n\nBut how does the BFS find this? \n\nThe BFS would process nodes in order of their distance. \n\nThe distance for 20 is 20 (steps via adding 1 each time). \n\nBut when processing 19, the next nodes are 20 (distance 20) and 38 (2*19 mod 32768). \n\nThe distance for 20 is initially 20. \n\nBut when processing 20, the next nodes are 21 and 40. \n\nThe distance for 40 would be 20+1=21. \n\nContinuing this way, the path of multiplying would take many steps. \n\nThe path of multiplying 13 times from 20 would require 13 steps from 20, so the total steps would be 20 (steps to reach 20) +13 steps \u219233 steps. \n\nBut the example's path is 14 steps. \n\nAh, this suggests that the BFS approach is not considering the path of adding 1 to 19 to get 20, then multiplying. \n\nWait, the path is: \n\n19 \u219220 (add 1 \u2192 step 1) \n\n20 \u219240 (multiply \u2192 step 2) \n\n40 \u219280 (step3) \n\n... \n\n20*2^13 mod 32768 is 0. \n\nThe number of steps from 19 is 1 (add) +13 (multiply) =14 steps. \n\nBut the BFS would compute the distance for 19 as follows: \n\nThe distance for 19 is initially infinity. \n\nThe first time it is reached is via the path of adding 1 each step from 0 to 19 \u2192 distance 19. \n\nThen, when processing 18, the next nodes are 19 (distance 19) and 36 (distance 19+1=20). \n\nBut there's another path to 19 via multiplying from 9 (9*2=18 \u2192 no, 9*2 is 18, not 19). \n\nAlternatively, the path to 19 via multiplying is not possible. \n\nThe only way to reach 19 is via adding 1 from 18. \n\nThus, the BFS approach would compute the distance for 19 as 19 steps. \n\nBut the example says it can be done in 14 steps. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nAh! I see the problem now. \n\nThe BFS approach considers all possible paths, but the path described in the example is not possible because multiplying by 2 from 20 would give 40, then 80, etc., but after 13 steps, it reaches 20*2^13 mod 32768. \n\nWait, 20 * 2^13 = 20 * 8192 = 163840. \n\n163840 divided by 32768 is 5*32768 = 163840 \u2192 mod 32768 is 0. \n\nSo after 13 multiply steps from 20, you reach 0. \n\nThus, the path from 19 is: \n\n19 \u219220 (add 1 \u2192 step 1) \n\nthen multiply 13 times (steps 2-14). \n\nTotal steps:14. \n\nBut how does the BFS find this path? \n\nThe BFS would process nodes in order of their distance. \n\nThe distance for 20 is 20 (steps via adding from 0). \n\nBut the path from 19 to 20 is one step. \n\nSo the distance for 20 can also be computed as distance[19]+1 =19+1=20. \n\nThen, the distance for 40 would be min(20+1 (21), or other paths). \n\nThe path of multiplying from 20 would take 13 steps, but the distance for 0 would be 20+13=33. \n\nBut the example's path is 14 steps. \n\nThis suggests that the BFS approach is not finding the optimal path. \n\nAh! I see the mistake now. \n\nThe BFS approach is considering the steps as the number of steps taken from 0 to the node. \n\nBut the problem requires the steps to reach 0 from the node. \n\nThe BFS approach I described earlier is for finding the steps from 0 to the node, but the problem requires the steps from the node to 0. \n\nAh! This is the key mistake. \n\nThe BFS approach must be done in reverse. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the minimal steps to reach 0 from each node v. \n\nTo do this, the BFS should start from 0 and propagate the steps in reverse. \n\nThe allowed steps in reverse are: \n\nFor a node u, the previous nodes that can reach u in one step are: \n\n- (u-1) mod 32768 (reverse of adding 1) \n\n- (u//2) if u is even (reverse of multiplying by 2) \n\nThus, the BFS should be done as follows: \n\nInitialize dist[0] =0. \n\nFor all other nodes, dist is infinity. \n\nUse a queue. \n\nStart with 0. \n\nFor each node u in the queue: \n\n    for each predecessor v of u: \n\n        if dist[v] > dist[u] +1: \n\n            dist[v] = dist[u]+1 \n\n            add v to the queue \n\nThe predecessors of u are: \n\nv1 = (u-1) mod 32768 \n\nv2 = (u//2) if u is even \n\nThus, for each u, we can compute the predecessors and update their distances. \n\nThis way, the distance for v is the minimal steps to reach 0 from v. \n\nLet's test this for v=19: \n\nThe predecessors of 0 are: \n\nv1 = (0-1) mod 32768 \u219232767 \n\nv2 = 0//2 =0 (since even) \n\nSo dist[32767] can be updated to 1 (dist[0]+1). \n\nThen, processing 0's predecessors: \n\n32767's distance is 1. \n\nThe predecessors of 32767 are: \n\nv1 =32766 \n\nv2 =32767//2 (since it's odd, no v2) \n\nSo dist[32766] = dist[32767]+1 =2 \n\nContinuing this way would take a long time, but let's see for v=20: \n\nThe predecessors of 0 are 32767 and 0. \n\nThe predecessors of 20 are: \n\nv1 =19 \n\nv2 =10 (since 20 is even) \n\nSo for u=20, the distance would be computed as follows: \n\nWhen processing the predecessors of 0, we first process 0's predecessors. \n\nBut to compute the distance for 20, we need to process the predecessors of 20. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. \n\nLet me think of the example for v=19: \n\nThe path to reach 0 from 19 is: \n\n19 \u219220 (add 1 \u2192 reverse step is subtract 1 from 20 to get 19) \n\n20 \u21920 via multiplying 13 times (reverse steps are dividing by 2 13 times). \n\nThe reverse path is: \n\n19 \u219220 \u219210 \u21925 \u2192 ... \u21920 \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe reverse path for the example's path is: \n\nThe forward path is 19 \u219220 \u2192 multiply 13 times \u21920. \n\nThe reverse path is: \n\n0 can be reached from 0 (multiply by 2) or from 1 (subtract 1). \n\nThe path for 20 is: \n\n20 can be reached from 19 (subtract 1) or from 10 (multiply by 2). \n\nThe minimal path for 20 is to divide by 2 13 times to reach 0. \n\nThe distance for 20 would be 13 steps (dividing by 2 13 times). \n\nThen, the distance for 19 is 1 (step to 20) +13 steps \u219214 steps. \n\nThus, the BFS approach should compute this. \n\nLet's see how this would work: \n\nThe BFS starts with 0 (distance 0). \n\nProcess 0's predecessors: \n\nv1 =32767 \u2192 distance 1 \n\nv2 =0 \u2192 distance 0 (already processed) \n\nAdd 32767 to the queue. \n\nNext, process 32767 (distance 1): \n\nIts predecessors are 32766 (v1) and no v2 (since odd). \n\nSet distance[32766] =2 \n\nAdd to queue. \n\nContinue this until we reach 20. \n\nBut this would take a long time. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider the path for 20: \n\nThe distance for 20 is the minimal steps to reach 0 from 20. \n\nThe best path is dividing by 2 13 times (steps 13). \n\nThe predecessors of 20 are 19 and 10. \n\nThe distance for 20 can be computed as min( distance[19]+1, distance[10]+1 ). \n\nTo get distance[20] =13, we need distance[10] to be 12. \n\n distance[10] = distance[5]+1 (since 10 is even \u2192 predecessor is 5). \n\n distance[5] = distance[2]+1 (since 5 is odd \u2192 predecessor is 4). \n\n distance[4] = distance[2]+1 \u2192 and so on. \n\nThis suggests that the BFS approach will eventually compute the correct distance for 20 as 13 steps. \n\nThen, the distance for 19 would be min( distance[20]+1 (14), distance[9]+1 (if 19 is even? No, 19 is odd \u2192 only predecessor is 18). \n\n distance[18] would be distance[9]+1 \u2192 but this path would be longer than 14. \n\nThus, the BFS approach should compute the correct distance of 14 for v=19. \n\nThis suggests that the BFS approach using the reverse steps is correct. \n\nThus, the correct way to compute the distance array is to use this BFS approach. \n\nNow, implementing this in code: \n\nWe can represent the distance array as an array of size 32768. \n\nInitialize all to -1 except dist[0] =0. \n\nUse a queue. \n\nStart with 0. \n\nFor each node u in the queue: \n\n    compute its predecessors: \n\n    v1 = (u-1) % 32768 \n\n    v2 = u//2 if u is even \n\n    for each of these predecessors: \n\n        if dist[v] is not set or can be improved: \n\n            set dist[v] = dist[u]+1 \n\n            add to queue \n\nWait, but the predecessors are the nodes that can reach u in one step. \n\nThus, the distance for v is dist[u]+1. \n\nThis way, the BFS propagates the distance from 0 outward. \n\nThe code would look like this: \n\nmax_v = 32768 \n\ndist = [inf] * max_v \n\ndist[0] =0 \n\nfrom collections import deque \n\nq = deque() \n\nq.append(0) \n\nwhile q: \n\n    u = q.popleft() \n\n    v1 = (u-1) % max_v \n\n    if dist[v1] > dist[u]+1: \n\n        dist[v1] = dist[u]+1 \n\n        q.append(v1) \n\n    if u %2 ==0: \n\n        v2 = u//2 \n\n        if dist[v2] > dist[u]+1: \n\n            dist[v2] = dist[u]+1 \n\n            q.append(v2) \n\nThis should compute the correct distances. \n\nNow, the code for program3.py needs to precompute this array and then process the input. \n\nThe given code for program3.py is: \n\nn,s=open(0)\nfor x in s.split():\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code should read the input properly. \n\nThe correct way to read the input is: \n\nRead n from the first line. \n\nRead the next line as the list of a_i. \n\nThus, the code should be something like: \n\nimport sys \n\ndef

q.popleft() \n\n        v1 = (u-1) % max_v \n\n        if dist[v1] > dist[u]+1: \n\n            dist[v1] = dist[u]+1 \n\n            q.append(v1) \n\n        if u %2 ==0: \n\n            v2 = u//2 \n\n            if dist[v2] > dist[u]+1: \n\n                dist[v2] = dist[u]+1 \n\n                q.append(v2) \n\n    # read input \n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline()) \n\n    a = list(map(int,
