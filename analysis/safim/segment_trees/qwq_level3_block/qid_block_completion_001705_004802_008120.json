Wait, but the code's current code doesn't track the character. Hmm, perhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be fixed. Alternatively, the code's missing part is to set p = i when the length is odd and p is 0. Wait, in the code's current code, when the length is odd and p is 0 (meaning no previous p), then the else clause (p=0) would set p =i. Then, when another odd run comes, if p is set, then r += (i-p), and p is reset. The total r is the sum of these differences. But what does this represent? Suppose we have two odd runs at positions 1 and 3. The difference is 2, so adding 2 to r. \n\nNot sure. Alternatively, the code is trying to count the number of pairs of odd runs and adding the distance between them.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about counting the number of distinct preorder strings possible by swapping children of non-leaf nodes. The code provided has a function calc(u) that returns a tuple. The first element seems to be a count, and the second a hash. The root of the problem is that when you can swap the children of a node, the order of the left and right subtrees can be swapped, so the possible combinations for each subtree need to account for that.\n\nLooking at the code, the base case for leaves (when u is beyond the 2^n threshold) is missing. So for a leaf node, the preorder string is just its own character. So the calc function for a leaf should return (0, s[u-1]), since there are no swaps possible here. Wait, the first element in the tuple is probably the number of bits or something else. Wait, the current code's return line for non-leaves is (t1[0] + t2[0] + (t1[1] != t2[1]), ...). Hmm, maybe the first element is the number of bits needed to represent the possibilities? Or perhaps it's the number of choices that can be made here. Let me think again.\n\nThe code's return line for non-leaves adds t1[0] and t2[0], then adds 1 if t1[1] != t2[1]. The final print is pow(2, calc(1)[0], MOD). So the total is 2^count mod MOD. So the count is the number of independent choices that can be made. Each time when the left and right subtrees have different hashes, you can choose to swap them or not, adding a bit (so +1 to the count). \n\nTherefore, for a leaf node, since there are no children to swap, the first element (the count) should be 0, and the second element (the hash) is just the character of the node. So the missing code for the leaf case is:\n\nreturn (0, s[u-1])\n\nBecause the leaves have no children, so no swaps possible, so the count doesn't increase here. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to check if a string is perfectly balanced. The code given has a loop over test cases. The code checks if the number of unique characters is 1 or the length equals the number of unique (so all unique, but that's only possible if length is 1?), but then for other cases, it loops from i=1 to a (the length). \n\nWait, the code's logic seems a bit off. Let me read the problem again. The condition is that for every substring t of s, and any two characters u and v present in s, the difference between their frequencies in t is at most 1. \n\nThe code's current approach is: if the string has all unique characters (like length 1, or all unique?), then it's yes. Else, for the first occurrence where a character repeats (i.e., s[i] is in the previous part), then it creates a string w by repeating the substring up to i, and checks if s equals that. If so, print yes, else no. \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that the string must be a repetition of a base substring where each character appears exactly once? Like, for example, \"abcabc\" would have each character appearing twice in each part, but maybe that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the only way the condition holds is if the string is a repetition of a base string with all unique characters. For example, \"abc\" repeated would have each substring's frequencies balanced. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait the sample input given in the problem's note: \"aba\" is acceptable. Let's see. The substring \"ab\" has a and b each once. \"aba\" has a:2, b:1. The difference between a and b is 1, which is okay. The substring \"bb\" isn't present here. Wait \"aba\" has substrings like \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"b\", \"ba\", \"a\". The \"b\" substring has a difference of 1 with a (since in \"b\", a's count is 0, so difference is 1). So that's okay. \n\nBut the problem's second example \"abb\" is invalid because the substring \"bb\" has a's count 0 and b's 2, so difference 2. \n\nSo the condition requires that in every substring, for any two characters present, their counts differ by at most 1. \n\nThis seems very restrictive. How can a string satisfy this? Let's think of possible cases. \n\nCase 1: All characters are the same. Then any substring has counts of that character, so differences are 0. So \"aaa\" is okay. \n\nCase 2: The string alternates between two characters, like \"ababab\". Let's see a substring like \"aba\" has a:2, b:1. The difference between a and b is 1. \"abab\" has a:2, b:2. So okay. But a substring like \"ababab\" has a and b counts equal. But what about a substring like \"ababa\"? a:3, b:2. The difference is 1. So that's okay. \n\nWait, but if the string is \"ababa\", then any substring would have counts differing by at most 1. \n\nWait, but what about a longer string like \"abcabc\"? Let's see a substring like \"abc\" is okay. But a substring like \"abca\" has a:2, b:1, c:1. The difference between a and b is 1, a and c is 1, so okay. \n\nHmm, but how can we check this efficiently? The problem requires that for every possible substring and every pair of characters in the substring, their counts differ by at most 1. \n\nThe brute-force approach would be O(n^3) which is impossible for n up to 2e5. So there must be a smarter way. \n\nLooking at the code provided, the current approach is: \n\nIf the string has all unique characters (like length 1, or all unique?), then yes. \n\nElse, for the first i where s[i] is in s[:i], then check if the string is a repetition of s[:i]. \n\nWait, perhaps the only way the condition holds is if the string is a repetition of a base string where each character appears exactly once. For example, \"abc\" repeated. Because then, any substring would have counts of each character in the base string either equal or differing by 1. \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose the base is \"abc\", then the full string is \"abcabc\". Any substring of length 3 would have exactly one of each. A substring of length 4 would have two of one character and one of others? Wait no. For example, \"abca\" has a:2, b:1, c:1. The differences between a and b is 1, which is okay. \n\nBut if the base is longer, like \"abcd\", then a substring of \"abca\" would have a:2, b:1, c:1, d:0. The difference between a and d is 2, which is invalid. So that's not allowed. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the only valid strings are those where the entire string is a repetition of a base string with all unique characters, and the length is a multiple of the base length. \n\nIn that case, the code's approach is trying to check if the string is a repetition of some base string that has all unique characters. \n\nThe code's logic is: \n\nIf the number of unique characters is 1, then yes. \n\nElse, if the length equals the number of unique (so all unique, but that's only possible if length is equal to the number of unique, which for a string longer than 1 would require all characters distinct, but then the problem's first condition would require that in any substring, the counts of any two characters differ by at most 1. For example, \"abc\" has a substring \"ab\" which has counts 1 and 1, so okay. But \"abcd\" would have a substring \"abc\" with counts 1 each, but \"abcd\" has all 1's. So maybe that's okay. Wait, but \"abcd\" would have a substring \"ab\" which is okay, but \"abcd\" itself has all counts 1, so differences are 0. So \"abcd\" would be acceptable. Wait but according to the problem's note, the third example \"abc\" is acceptable. \n\nWait the third example in the problem's note is \"abc\", which is considered perfectly balanced. So that's okay. \n\nSo the code's first condition is correct for when all characters are the same (so yes) or when all characters are unique (so yes). \n\nBut for other cases, the code is trying to find the first occurrence where a character repeats. Then, it checks if the string is a repetition of the prefix up to that point. \n\nWait, the code does:\n\nfor i in range(1, a):\n\n    if s[i] in s[:i]:\n\n        w = (s[:i] * a)[:a]\n\n        if s == w:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        break\n\nSo once it finds the first i where s[i] is in the previous characters, it takes the prefix up to i (exclusive?), and checks if the entire string is made by repeating that prefix. \n\nWait, the code uses s[:i], which is the substring from 0 to i (exclusive). So for example, if the first duplicate is at position i, then the prefix is s[0..i-1]. \n\nIf the entire string is a repetition of that prefix, then it would satisfy the condition. \n\nBut why? Because each occurrence of the prefix ensures that the counts of each character are equal in each block, so any substring would have counts differing by at most 1. \n\nWait, but the prefix must have all unique characters. Because otherwise, the first duplicate would have been found earlier. \n\nWait, the first time a character is repeated is at i. So the prefix s[:i] has all unique characters except the last character (s[i-1]?) Wait no. Let me think. \n\nSuppose the first duplicate is at position i. So s[i] is present in s[0..i-1]. So the prefix up to i (exclusive) is s[0..i-1], which has all unique characters except the new character at i. Wait, no. The first occurrence of a duplicate is at i, so the first i characters (indices 0 to i-1) must have all unique except the new one. Wait, the first duplicate is at i, so s[i] is in s[0..i-1]. So the first i+1 characters (0 to i) have a duplicate. \n\nSo the prefix s[:i] (0 to i-1) has all unique characters. Because otherwise, the first duplicate would have been found earlier. \n\nTherefore, the prefix s[:i] has all unique characters. So if the entire string is a repetition of this prefix, then each block has exactly one of each character in the prefix. \n\nThus, any substring would have counts of each character in the prefix either equal or differing by at most 1. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is to check if the string is a repetition of such a prefix. \n\nIf that's the case, then the code can print \"YES\", else \"NO\". \n\nBut in the code, after checking if s equals w (the repeated prefix), if not, then the code needs to print \"NO\". \n\nSo the missing code in the else clause (when s != w) is to print \"NO\". \n\nWait, but the code breaks after the first i where a duplicate is found. So if the first duplicate is found, and the string is not a repetition of the prefix, then the answer is \"NO\". \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to print \"NO\" in that case. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nBut let me check the code structure again. The code is in the else clause of the outer else (when b !=1 and a !=b). So the code loops over i from 1 to a (the length). The first time a character is found in the previous part, it checks if the string is a repetition of the prefix. If yes, print \"YES\", else \"NO\", then breaks. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to print \"NO\" there. \n\nNow moving to program3.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of changes to make the binary string \"good\". A good string is divided into contiguous subsegments of same characters, each of even length. The division must be into the minimal number of subsegments (so whenever the current character changes, a new segment starts). \n\nThe goal is to make all those segments even in length with minimal changes. \n\nThe code provided is using regular expressions to split the string into runs of 0s and 1s. For each run, if its length is odd, then some action is taken. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nfor each test case, the code reads the string s, then uses re.findall to split into '0+' or '1+' groups. \n\nThen, for each group in the list of groups (t in the for loop), the code tracks variables i, p, r. \n\nThe code's variables: \n\ni is the count of current runs? \n\np is perhaps a flag? \n\nr is the result. \n\nThe code's logic for each group t is: \n\ni +=1 (counting the number of groups so far). \n\nif the length of t is odd: \n\n   if p is non-zero, then add (i-p) to r, set p=0. \n\n   else: \n\n      # TODO: code here \n\nWait, the code's structure is a bit unclear. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe minimal number of operations: \n\nEach segment must have even length. The division is into the minimal number of segments, which is determined by the original string's transitions. \n\nWait, the division is into the minimal number of segments, which is exactly the number of runs (since each time the character changes, a new segment starts). So the problem requires that each of these runs must have even length. \n\nWait, no. The division is into the minimal number of segments, which is exactly the number of runs. Because you can't merge runs of different characters. So each run must be even in length. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to making each run's length even, with minimal changes. \n\nBut how? \n\nEach run can be adjusted by changing some bits. \n\nFor a run of length L: \n\nIf L is even, do nothing. \n\nIf L is odd, you have to change it to even. \n\nBut how? \n\nOption 1: Change one of the bits in the run to the other character, splitting the run into two parts. For example, a run of 3 1's can be changed to 2 1's followed by a 0, making two even runs (2 and 1?), but that might not be optimal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to merge with adjacent runs. \n\nWait, but the division is fixed as the minimal number of segments. So the runs can't be merged. Therefore, each run must be even. \n\nWait, the problem says that after changing some bits, the string must be divided into minimal number of segments (so the same as the original runs, but adjusted to have even lengths). \n\nWait, no. The division is into the minimal number of segments possible after the changes. \n\nWait the problem says: \n\n\"Tokitsukaze divides s into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same. After that, s is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.\"\n\nSo the division is done after the changes, into the minimal possible number of segments (i.e., whenever the character changes, a new segment starts). \n\nTherefore, the problem requires that after changes, all the runs (the minimal segments) have even length. \n\nThe minimal changes required to achieve this. \n\nSo the approach is to process each run, and decide whether to adjust its length to even by merging with the next run or previous, but that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, for each run, if its length is odd, we have to make it even. But how? \n\nWait, the runs are determined by the final string. So the runs can be altered by changing bits. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal way is to process the runs in pairs. \n\nLet me think of the runs as a list of lengths. For each run, if its length is even, no problem. If it's odd, we can pair it with the next run (if it's of the same character?), but that might not be possible. \n\nAlternatively, for each run of odd length, you can either: \n\n- Increase its length by 1 (by changing the next character to the same, but that would merge with the next run, which may complicate things). \n\nOr decrease by 1 (changing one character to the other, splitting into two runs, but then the next run's length must also be adjusted). \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal changes can be found by considering each run and whether to adjust it by merging with the next run. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by dynamic programming. \n\nLet me think of the runs as a list of lengths and characters. \n\nSuppose the runs are R1, R2, ..., Rk. \n\nEach Ri has length Li and character Ci. \n\nWe need all Li to be even. \n\nThe minimal changes required can be computed by considering each run and whether to adjust it. \n\nBut how? \n\nFor a run of odd length, you can either: \n\n1. Change one character in the run to the other, making it even. This splits the run into two parts (if the changed character is in the middle?), but actually, changing a single character in the run would split it into two runs (if the character is different from the original). \n\nWait, for example, a run of 3 1's: changing the middle to 0 would split into two runs: 1 and 1, but separated by a 0. So the total runs would increase by 1. \n\nAlternatively, changing the last character to 0 would make the run length 2 (even), and the next run (originally the next run) would start with 0. \n\nHmm, this complicates the problem because changing a run can affect adjacent runs. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal changes can be found by considering that for each run of odd length, you can either: \n\n- Make it even by adding one (by merging with the next run, but only if the next run is of the same character). \n\nWait, but merging requires that the next run is of the same character. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nEach run must have even length. \n\nFor each run of odd length, you have two options: \n\na) Change one character in the run to the other character, splitting it into two runs. The first part has length L-1 (even?), and the second part (the changed character) is a new run of length 1 (which is odd, so that's bad). So this might not help. \n\nAlternatively, changing a character in the middle would split into two runs of (L-1)/2 and (L+1)/2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to pair consecutive runs of the same character. \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nSuppose we have a run of odd length. To make it even, we can either: \n\n- Change one character in the run to the other, which would split it into two runs (so the first part is even, but the second is a single character, which is odd. So that's worse. \n\nAlternatively, merge with the next run (if it's the same character). \n\nWait, if the next run is of the same character, then merging them would make a run of L1 + L2. If both were odd, their sum is even. \n\nSo for example, two consecutive runs of 3 and 3 (same character) can be merged into 6, which is even. \n\nSo the cost would be 0 (no changes needed) if they are merged. \n\nAlternatively, if they are separate, each would need to be adjusted. \n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to pair up consecutive runs of the same character when their lengths are odd. \n\nThis suggests a greedy approach: \n\nIterate through the runs, and whenever you have two consecutive runs of the same character with odd lengths, merge them (no cost), and their combined length is even. \n\nBut if a run is odd and the next is different, then you have to fix it by changing a character. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach: \n\nWe can model the problem as follows. \n\nEach run must have even length. \n\nFor each run, if its length is even, do nothing. \n\nIf it's odd, then we have to either: \n\n- Merge it with the next run (if same character), but that requires the next run's length to be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost is to change one character in the run to the other, which would split it into two runs. But that might not be better. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost for an odd run is 1 (change one character to make it even). But that would split the run into two runs (if the changed character is different), so the next run's length would be 1 (if the change is at the end). \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code provided is trying to track the parity of the runs and decide when to merge. \n\nLooking at the code's current code: \n\nThe code has variables i (number of runs so far?), p (some flag?), and r (result). \n\nThe code loops over each run t in the list of runs. \n\nFor each run: \n\ni +=1 \n\nif the length of t is odd: \n\n   if p is not zero: \n\n      r += (i - p) \n\n      p =0 \n\n   else: \n\n      # TODO \n\nWait, perhaps p is tracking the previous run's index where a problem occurred. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track when an odd-length run occurs and decide whether to merge with the next. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is: \n\nWhenever a run has an odd length, we can choose to merge it with the next run (if same character?), but this requires some cost. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to count the number of times we have to \"flip\" a run's parity by merging. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables: \n\ni is the current number of runs. \n\np is the position where an odd run was found. \n\nWhen a run is odd, if p is 0 (meaning no previous odd run), then set p to the current run's index (i). \n\nIf another odd run comes and it's the next run (same as p+1?), then we can merge them, so the cost is (current i - p) which is 1, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to pair up consecutive runs. \n\nWait, let's look at the code's structure again. \n\nThe code is: \n\nfor t in re.findall(...):\n\n    i +=1 \n\n    if len(t) %2 ==1:\n\n        if p:\n\n            r += (i - p)\n\n            p =0 \n\n        else:\n\n            p = i \n\n    else:\n\n        # do nothing \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that whenever an odd run is found, if there was a previous odd run (p is set), then the distance between them is (i-p), and adding that to the result. Then reset p. \n\nWait, but why? \n\nSuppose we have two consecutive odd runs. \n\nThen, merging them (if they are same character) would make an even length. \n\nBut the cost would be 0. \n\nAlternatively, the code is counting the number of pairs of odd runs and adding the distance between them. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to count the number of times you have to merge two runs, and the cost is the number of runs between them. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is that whenever an odd run is found, if there was a previous odd run (p is set), then the number of runs between them (i-p) is added to the result, and then p is reset. \n\nThis might be counting the number of runs that need to be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the positions of odd-length runs and whenever two are found, the cost is the number of runs between them. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that all runs must be even. So for each run of odd length, you have to either merge it with the next run (if same character) or change a character. \n\nThe minimal changes would be to merge as much as possible. \n\nThe code's approach might be to track when two consecutive runs of the same character have odd lengths, allowing them to be merged. \n\nWait, but the code's current code doesn't track the character. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing part is to set p = i when the length is odd and p is 0. \n\nWait, in the code's current code, when the length is odd and p is 0 (meaning no previous p), then the else clause (p=0) would set p =i. \n\nThen, when another odd run comes, if p is set, then r += (i-p), and p is reset. \n\nThe total r is the sum of these differences. \n\nBut what does this represent? \n\nSuppose we have two odd runs at positions 1 and 3. The difference is 2, so adding 2 to r. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of pairs of odd runs and adding the distance between them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of changes is the number of odd-length runs divided by 2, but that's not necessarily correct. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal changes required is the number of odd-length runs divided by 2, but only if they can be paired. \n\nWait, each pair of consecutive odd runs of the same character can be merged into one even run (sum is even). \n\nSo for each such pair, no cost. \n\nBut if they are of different characters, then you can't merge, so each must be fixed by changing a character (cost 1 each). \n\nThus, the minimal cost is the number of odd runs minus the number of pairs of consecutive same-character odd runs. \n\nHmm, but how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to track the positions of the odd runs and whenever two are found, the cost is the number of runs between them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the following: \n\nEach time an odd run is found, if there was a previous odd run (p is set), then merging them would require changing the runs in between to allow merging. \n\nWait, this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at the sample input. \n\nSample Input 1: \n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n2\n\n11\n\n4\n\n1111\n\n4\n\n0101\n\n6\n\n1110011000\n\nSample Output 1:\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\nWait, the first case is \"11\" which is already even. So output 0. \n\nThe fourth test case is \"1110011000\". The runs are: \n\n111 (length 3, odd), 00 (2 even), 11 (2 even), 000 (3 odd). \n\nSo two odd runs. \n\nThe minimal changes: \n\nWe can change the first run (111) to 110 (making it two 1's and one 0?), but that would split into 11 and 0, but then the next run is 00. \n\nAlternatively, the best way is to change the first run to 11 (even) by removing one 1 (cost 1), and the last run (000) to 00 (cost 1). Total cost 2. But the sample output is 3. \n\nWait the sample output for the fourth case is 3. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nThe fourth test case's input is \"1110011000\". \n\nThe original runs are: \n\n\"111\" (3), \"00\" (2), \"11\" (2), \"000\" (3). \n\nThe minimal changes needed to make all runs even. \n\nThe first run (3) is odd. The last run (3) is odd. \n\nTo fix them: \n\nOption 1: \n\nChange the first run to 2 (cost 1), and the last to 2 (cost 1). Total 2. \n\nBut the sample output is 3. \n\nWait the sample says the fourth test case's output is 0? Wait the sample input given in the problem's note says the fourth test case's output is 0. Wait the problem's note says: \n\n\"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\nWait the fourth test case's input is \"1110011000\". \n\nWait the original division is into runs of 3, 2, 2, 3. \n\nThe lengths are 3 (odd), 2 (even), 2 (even), 3 (odd). \n\nSo the fourth test case's output is 3? Or the sample says it's 0? \n\nWait the problem's note says: \n\n\"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\nAh, so the fourth test case must be good. But according to the input given in the note's fourth example, perhaps the input is different. \n\nWait the note's fourth example is \"1110011000\" which is not good. But the note says the fourth is good. \n\nWait perhaps I'm confused. Let me recheck the problem's note. \n\nThe note says: \n\n\"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is ... \n\nIn the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\nAh, so the fourth test case's input must be a good string. \n\nWait the fourth example's input must be a string that is already good. \n\nWait perhaps the fourth example's input is \"1100\" or something else. \n\nBut according to the problem's sample input given in the code's comment, perhaps the fourth test case's input is \"11001100\" which would have runs of 2, 2, 2, 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nBack to the code. \n\nThe code for program3.py is: \n\nimport re\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n    i=p=r=0\n\n    for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n\n        i+=1\n\n        if len(t)&1:\n\n            if p:\n\n                r +=i-p\n\n                p=0\n\n            else:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        else:\n\n            pass\n\n    print(r)\n\nThe missing code is in the else clause (when len(t) is odd and p is 0). \n\nThe code's logic is: \n\nWhen encountering an odd-length run, if p is not set (0), then set p to the current run's index (i). \n\nIf another odd run comes later, then the distance between them (i-p) is added to r, and p is reset. \n\nThe total r is the sum of these distances. \n\nThe question is, what should be done when p is 0 and the current run is odd. \n\nThe missing code is to set p = i. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\np = i \n\nThus, the missing code is p = i \n\nSo the code for program3.py's missing part is p = i \n\nPutting it all together: \n\nThe three missing parts are: \n\nprogram1: return (0, s[u-1])\n\nprogram2: print(\"NO\")\n\nprogram3: p = i \n\nSo the JSON should be: \n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"return (0, s[u-1])\",\n  \"program2\": \"print('NO')\",\n  \"program3\": \"p = i\"\n}"
