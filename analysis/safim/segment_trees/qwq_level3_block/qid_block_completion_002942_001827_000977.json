So for position i, the g[i] is the sum of all the falls you would get if you move from i to the end (but moving left, which would be towards lower indices). Wait, maybe not. Let me think of an example. Suppose the array is [5,3,4,2]. Then c is [5,3,4,2]. The f array would be:\n\nf[0] =0 \n\nf[1] = max(0,5-3) =2 \n\nf[2] = f[1] + max(0,3-4) \u2192 2 +0 \u21922 \n\nf[3] = f[2] + max(0,4-2)=2+2=4 So f[3] is 4. The g array:\n\nStarting from the end. Let's see:\n\ng[3] is 0 (initial). For i=1 (since range(1,4) for n=4):\n\ni=1: \n\ng[-1-1] = g[-1] + max(0, c[-1] - c[-2]). Wait, c[-1] is 2 (index3), c[-2] is4 (index2). So 2-4 is negative, so max(0, -2) \u21920. So g[2] = g[3] (0) +0 \u21920. Then i=2: \n\ni=2 \u2192 -i is -2 (index2), so -i-1 is -3 (index1). g[1] = g[2] (0) + max(0, c[2] - c[1]). c[2] is4, c[1] is3 \u21924-3=1 \u2192 so g[1] =0+1=1. i=3: i=3 \u2192-i is -3 (index1), so -i-1 is -4 (index0). g[0] = g[1] (1) + max(0, c[1] - c[0]). c[1] is3, c[0]5 \u21923-5 is -2 \u21920.

Looking at the code, when x < y, the code uses f[y-1] - f[x-1], which for example, if x=1 (index0) and y=4 (index3), the difference is f[3] - f[0] \u21924-0=4. Which is correct because moving from 0 to3, the path's fall is 2 (from 0\u21921) and then 2 (from 2\u21923). Now, when x>y, like x=4 (index3) and y=1 (index0), then the path is moving left. The total fall would be the sum of the steps from 3 to 0. Wait, moving from 3 to 0, each step left:\n\n3\u21922: a[3]=2, a[2]=4 \u2192 since 2 <4, so no fall. 2\u21921: a[2]=4 vs a[1]=3 \u21924>3 \u2192 fall of 1. \n\n1\u21920: a[1]=3 vs a[0]=5 \u21923 <5 \u2192 no fall.

The g array for the example is [1,1,0,0]. g[0] is 1. \n\ng[1] is 1. \n\ng[2] is 0. g[3] is 0. So for position 0, the cumulative is 1. What does that represent?

So in the example, when moving from 3 (x=4) to 0 (y=1), the damage is g[0] - g[3] \u21921-0=1. Which is correct. Another test case: suppose the array is [5,4,3,2,1].

The code given starts with handling n=1, which requires swapping first two characters. The code then enters a loop where i starts at 2 and j at 3n. The loop is while i<j. The TODO is inside this loop. The approach here is probably to find a way to break all possible \"BAN\" subsequences. Since the original string is \"BAN\" repeated n times, each \"BAN\" contributes to possible subsequences. The minimal swaps would involve disrupting the structure. One possible way is to swap certain characters so that the Bs, As, Ns are not in the right order. The note in the second example shows that swapping positions 2 and 6 (for n=2, the string is 6 characters) converts it to BNNBAA. Looking at the code's approach, perhaps the idea is to pair the B's with N's and A's in a way that breaks the sequence. The code's current approach is to have i starting at 2 (the second B in the first \"BAN\"), and j at the end. Wait, the code's loop is while i < j. The variables i and j are indices? Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to swap the second character of each \"BAN\" block with some other character. Alternatively, the code may be trying to swap the A's and N's in some positions. Looking at the sample input for n=2, the solution swaps position 2 (the 'A' of the first BAN) with position 6 (the 'N' of the second BAN). This would turn the string into BNNBAA.",

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the code's approach is to swap every second A with an N from the end. The code's loop is designed to swap the A's (position 2,5,8) with N's (positions3,6,9). Wait, perhaps the code is trying to swap the A's with N's in the same \"BAN\" block. Alternatively, the code is trying to pair the A's with N's from later blocks. The code's loop is:\n\ni starts at 2 (the first A in the first BAN), j starts at 3n (the last N in the last BAN). Each iteration swaps i and j, then increments i by 3 and decrements j by 3. This way, each swap is between an A and an N from a later block. This would turn the A into an N and the N into an A, so that the \"BAN\" can't form. For example, in the first sample (n=2):\n\nswap positions 2 (A) and 6 (N). The first BAN becomes B N N, and the second BAN becomes B A A. Thus, there's no B followed by A followed by N. This approach would require n-1 swaps? Or for n=2, it's 1 swap. The code's loop would run (n//something) times. The code's loop is while i <j. \n\nEach iteration, i increases by 3, j decreases by 3. The number of swaps would be floor((j -i)/6) or something. Wait, for n=1, the code already handles it. For n=3, the first swap is between 2 and9, then 5 and6 (since 2+3=5, 9-3=6). Wait, 5 and6 are in the same block (the third BAN). Swapping them would turn the third BAN into B N A. \n\nHmm, but then the third BAN's A and N are swapped. This way, the B is followed by N, so the subsequence BAN can't form. Overall, this approach might work. So the code's missing part is:\n\nans.append( (i, j) ) then i +=3, j -=3. Wait, the code's loop is while i <j:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nans.append( (i, j) ) i +=3\n\nj -=3\n\nSo the code would be: while i < j:\n\n    ans.append( (i, j) ) i +=3\n\n    j -=3\n\nWait, but the indices in the problem are 1-based. Yes, because the problem says \"swap indices i and j (1-based)\". So in the code, the variables i and j are 1-based. Thus, the code's loop is correct.",

Alternatively, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be (prev -1) divided by a[j], rounded down or up. Hmm, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but in reverse. Let me think of the forward loop's logic again. In the forward loop, for each k, the required b[k] must be at least prev +1. The minimal steps to reach that is ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] ), because each move adds a_k. Wait, the code's forward loop uses:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nThis ensures that b[k] = a[k] *x, which is the minimal possible value >= prev+1. Similarly, for the backward loop, the current element's b[j] must be less than the next element's b[j+1]. Let me denote next_val as the value of b[j+1]. Then, the current b[j] must be < next_val.

Alternatively, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be as large as possible but less than next_val. The maximum possible value is next_val -1. The minimal steps to reach that is ceil( (next_val -1)/a[j] ), but only if that is possible. Wait, but if next_val is 5, and a[j] is 3, then the maximum possible b[j] is 4. To get there, you can add 3 once (3) or twice (6 which is over). So the maximum possible is 3 (1 move). Wait, 3*1=3 <5. Alternatively, you can add once (3) or subtract once (-3). The minimal steps would be to choose the closest to next_val-1. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

To achieve this, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to next_val-1. The steps needed would be ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ), but only if that is possible. Wait, but if next_val is 0, then next_val-1 is -1, so we can subtract once. Alternatively, the steps would be the minimal steps to reach a value less than next_val. The minimal steps would be to set b[j] to next_val-1. The steps needed would be the minimal steps to reach that value. The minimal steps would be the minimal between adding or subtracting.",

Thus, the code for the backward loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = prev -1 \n\n    if required <0:\n\n        required = -float('inf')\n\n    # compute x as the minimal steps to reach required \n\n    if a[j] ==0:\n\n        # but a[j] is given as positive \n\n    x = (required + a[j] -1 ) // a[j] \n\n    # ceil division \n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nWait, but how to handle when required is negative.",

Wait, looking back at the code given for program3.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\nprev =0 \n\nj =i-1 while j>=0:\n\n    # TODO Then, after the backward loop, the forward loop starts with prev=0 again. Wait, this suggests that the backward loop is using prev as the next element's value. Wait, perhaps the initial prev is set to the value of the next element (b[j+1]). Wait, the code's backward loop is processing elements before i. The first element in the backward loop is j =i-1. The next element (j+1) is i. The value of b[i] is determined by the forward loop. Wait, perhaps the initial prev is the value of b[j+1], which is the next element. Thus, the code should track the previous value as the next element's value.

The forward loop ensures that each element is at least prev+1. The backward loop should ensure that each element is less than the next element. Thus, the backward loop's prev represents the maximum allowed value for the current element. The maximum allowed value is the next element's value minus 1. Thus, the backward loop's code would be:\n\nprev = next_val \n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nx = ceil( required / a[j] ) \n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[j] *x But how to track next_val.

For example, when processing j =i-1, the next element is i. The value of the next element (i) is determined by the forward loop. But the forward loop hasn't been executed yet.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about calculating the minimum fall damage for moving between two columns in an array. The given code has some parts filled but the else block when x > y is missing. \n\nLooking at the code, the variables f and g are precomputed. The f array seems to store cumulative fall damage when moving forward (from left to right). The g array might be for moving backward (right to left). Wait, in the code, for f, they are adding max(0, c[i-1] - c[i]) each step. So f[i] is the total fall damage from 0 to i. Similarly, g is built from the end. The code for when x < y uses f[y-1] - f[x-1], which makes sense because that's the cumulative from x to y. But when x > y, we need to compute the damage going the other way. So perhaps the g array is for the reverse direction. Let me think: the g array is built by going from the end. For example, g[-i-1] = g[-i] + ... So maybe g[i] is the cumulative fall damage from i to the end? Or maybe the g array is similar but in reverse. \n\nWait, the code for g is: for i in range(1, n), then g[-i-1] = g[-i] + max(0, c[-i] - c[-i-1]). Hmm, maybe the g array is storing the cumulative fall when moving to the left. Let me see. Let's say the array is 0-based. For the g array, starting from the end, each step to the left (i.e., from position j to j-1), the fall damage would be if the current (c[j] is higher than c[j-1], then the difference. Wait, no. Wait, when moving left, the direction is from higher index to lower. So moving from x to x-1: the current position is x, next is x-1. The fall damage is max(0, a[x] - a[x-1]). Because if a[x] is higher than a[x-1], then moving left would result in a fall. So the g array might be storing the cumulative fall when moving left. \n\nWait, the code for f is for moving forward (i from 1 to n-1), each step adds the fall from i-1 to i. So f[i] is the total fall damage from 0 to i. So for a query from s_j to t_j where s_j < t_j, the damage is f[t_j-1] - f[s_j-1]. \n\nBut when s_j > t_j, we need to compute the path from s_j to t_j moving left. So the damage would be the sum of the falls along the path from s_j to t_j. But how is that stored in the g array? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the g array is the cumulative fall when moving from the end towards the start. Let me think: the code for g is:\n\ng is initialized as [0]*n. Then for i in range(1, n):\n\nWait, the loop is for i in range(1, n). Then, the line is g[-i-1] = g[-i] + max(0, c[-i] - c[-i-1]). \n\nHmm, let's see for example, if n is 5. The indices are 0,1,2,3,4. \n\nFor i=1: \n\n- i=1: -i is -1 (the last element, index4). So -i-1 is -2 (index3). \n\nSo g[3] = g[4] + max(0, c[4] - c[3]). \n\nWait, but initially, all g are 0. So for the first iteration (i=1), g[4] is 0, so g[3] becomes max(0, c[4]-c[3]). \n\nThen for i=2: \n\n- -i is -2 (index3), so -i-1 is -3 (index2). \n\ng[2] = g[3] + max(0, c[3] - c[2]). \n\nContinuing this way, the g array is built from the end backwards. So g[i] represents the total fall damage from position i to the end? Or from i to the end when moving left? \n\nWait, perhaps the g array is the cumulative fall when moving from the end towards the start. So for position i, the g[i] is the sum of all the falls you would get if you move from i to the end (but moving left, which would be towards lower indices). Wait, maybe not. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the array is [5,3,4,2]. \n\nThen c is [5,3,4,2]. \n\nThe f array would be:\n\nf[0] =0 \n\nf[1] = max(0,5-3) =2 \n\nf[2] = f[1] + max(0,3-4) \u2192 2 +0 \u21922 \n\nf[3] = f[2] + max(0,4-2)=2+2=4 \n\nSo f[3] is 4. \n\nThe g array:\n\nStarting from the end. Let's see:\n\ng[3] is 0 (initial). \n\nFor i=1 (since range(1,4) for n=4):\n\ni=1: \n\ng[-1-1] = g[-1] + max(0, c[-1] - c[-2]). \n\nWait, c[-1] is 2 (index3), c[-2] is4 (index2). So 2-4 is negative, so max(0, -2) \u21920. So g[2] = g[3] (0) +0 \u21920. \n\nThen i=2: \n\ni=2 \u2192 -i is -2 (index2), so -i-1 is -3 (index1). \n\ng[1] = g[2] (0) + max(0, c[2] - c[1]). \n\nc[2] is4, c[1] is3 \u21924-3=1 \u2192 so g[1] =0+1=1. \n\ni=3: \n\ni=3 \u2192-i is -3 (index1), so -i-1 is -4 (index0). \n\ng[0] = g[1] (1) + max(0, c[1] - c[0]). \n\nc[1] is3, c[0]5 \u21923-5 is -2 \u21920. So g[0] =1+0=1. \n\nSo the g array is [1,1,0,0]. \n\nHmm, so what does this represent? \n\nLooking at the code, when x < y, the code uses f[y-1] - f[x-1], which for example, if x=1 (index0) and y=4 (index3), the difference is f[3] - f[0] \u21924-0=4. Which is correct because moving from 0 to3, the path's fall is 2 (from 0\u21921) and then 2 (from 2\u21923). \n\nNow, when x>y, like x=4 (index3) and y=1 (index0), then the path is moving left. The total fall would be the sum of the steps from 3 to 0. \n\nWait, moving from 3 to 0, each step left:\n\n3\u21922: a[3]=2, a[2]=4 \u2192 since 2 <4, so no fall. \n\n2\u21921: a[2]=4 vs a[1]=3 \u21924>3 \u2192 fall of 1. \n\n1\u21920: a[1]=3 vs a[0]=5 \u21923 <5 \u2192 no fall. \n\nTotal fall is 1. \n\nLooking at the g array, the g[3] is 0, but how to get the sum from 3 to 0? \n\nWait, perhaps the g array is built such that g[i] is the total fall from i to the end (but moving left?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the g array is the cumulative from the right. \n\nWait, in the code for the else case (x>y), we need to compute the damage when moving from x to y (since x>y, moving left). The path is from x-1 (since input is 1-based) to y-1. \n\nWait, the variables x and y are 1-based. So in code, x and y are read as integers, so for example, if x is 4 and y is 1 (n=4), then in 0-based indices, it's 3 and 0. \n\nThe desired damage is the sum of the falls when moving left from x-1 (3) to y-1 (0). \n\nIn the example above, the total fall is 1. \n\nLooking at the g array, the g[3] is 0, but the g[1] is 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the g array is storing the cumulative fall from the end to the current position. Wait, maybe the g array is such that g[i] is the total fall when moving from i to the end (but moving left). Wait, but in the example, moving from 3 to 0 (the start) would require going all the way left. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the g array is the cumulative from the right. Let me think of the code for g. \n\nThe code for g is:\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    g[-i-1] = g[-i] + max(0, c[-i] - c[-i-1])\n\nWait, let's see for the example:\n\nc is [5,3,4,2]\n\nThe indices are 0,1,2,3.\n\nThe loop runs for i from 1 to 3 (since n=4, range(1,4) is 1,2,3).\n\ni=1:\n\n- i=1 \u2192 -i is -1 (index3). \n\n- -i-1 is -2 (index2). \n\nSo g[2] = g[3] (0) + max(0, c[3] - c[2]) \u2192 2-4 is -2 \u21920. So g[2] becomes 0.\n\ni=2:\n\n- -i is -2 (index2). \n\n- -i-1 is -3 (index1). \n\ng[1] = g[2] (0) + max(0, c[2] - c[1]) \u21924-3=1 \u2192 so g[1] =1.\n\ni=3:\n\n- -i is -3 (index1). \n\n- -i-1 is -4 (index0). \n\ng[0] = g[1] (1) + max(0, c[1] - c[0]) \u21923-5 \u2192-2 \u21920. So g[0] =1+0=1.\n\nSo the g array is [1,1,0,0].\n\nNow, if we want to compute the damage from position 3 (x=4) to 0 (y=1), the path is moving left. The total fall is 1 (from position1 to 0, but no, wait in the example, the path from 3 to 0:\n\nsteps:\n\n3\u21922: no fall (2 <4 \u21920)\n\n2\u21921: 4>3 \u2192 fall of 1.\n\n1\u21920: 3 <5 \u2192 no fall. \n\nTotal is 1. \n\nLooking at the g array, the difference between g[3] and g[0]? \n\nWait, g[3] is 0, g[0] is 1. So 0 -1 would be -1, which is not correct. \n\nHmm, maybe the g array is storing the cumulative from the right. Let me think of another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the g array is the cumulative fall when moving to the left. So for position i, the g[i] is the total fall from i to the end (moving left). Wait, but in the example, moving from 3 to the end (which is already at 3) would have 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the g array is the cumulative from the right, so that the damage from i to j (when i>j) is g[j] - g[i]. \n\nWait in the example, when moving from 3 to 0 (x=4 to y=1), the desired damage is 1. \n\nLooking at the g array, the g[3] is 0, and the g[0] is 1. \n\nIf we do g[j] - g[i], where j is 0 and i is3 \u2192 1-0=1. That matches. \n\nWait, so perhaps when x>y (so in 0-based, i is x-1 and j is y-1, and i>j), the damage is g[j] - g[i]. \n\nWait in the example, the damage is 1, which is g[0] - g[3] \u21921-0=1. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nSo in the code, when x>y, the code should compute the damage as g[y-1] - g[x-1]. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nIn the code's else block (x>y), the variables x and y are 1-based. So x-1 is the starting index (higher), y-1 is the ending index (lower). \n\nSo the damage would be the cumulative from x-1 down to y-1. \n\nThe g array is built such that g[i] is the cumulative fall from i to the end (but moving left). Wait, but how does that work? \n\nAlternatively, the g array is built so that g[i] is the total fall when moving from i to the end (i.e., moving left all the way to the end, but that's not helpful). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the g array is the cumulative from the right, so that the damage from i to j (i>j) is g[j] - g[i]. \n\nSo in the code's else block, when x>y, the code should print g[y-1] - g[x-1]. \n\nWait, in the example, x is 4 (so x-1=3), y is1 (y-1=0). So g[0] - g[3] =1-0=1. Which is correct. \n\nSo the missing code in program1's else block is:\n\nprint(g[y-1] - g[x-1])\n\nSo the code for program1's else block is:\n\nprint(g[y-1] - g[x-1])\n\nWait, but in the code, the g array is built as follows. Let me check the code again. \n\nThe code for g is:\n\ng = [0]*n\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    g[-i-1] = g[-i] + max(0, c[-i] - c[-i-1])\n\nWait, in the example, the g array is [1,1,0,0]. \n\nWait, the first element (g[0]) is 1, which is the cumulative from the left? Or from the right? \n\nHmm, perhaps the g array is the cumulative from the right. Let me see:\n\nThe way the loop is structured, for each i from 1 to n-1, the code is processing the elements from the end. \n\nThe first iteration (i=1) processes the second to last element (since -i is -1, which is the last element, and -i-1 is -2, the second last). \n\nSo for each step, the code is building the g array from the end towards the start. \n\nThe g array at position k is the sum of all the falls from k to the end (moving left). \n\nWait, for example, in the first example, the g[0] is 1. That would mean that moving from 0 to the end (positions 0,1,2,3) the total fall is 1. \n\nWait, moving from 0 to 3 (leftwards?), but that's not the direction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the g array is the cumulative fall when moving from position i to the right? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the g array is the cumulative fall when moving to the left. \n\nWait, the way the code is written, for each step, the current position is -i-1, and the value is based on the next position (to the right). \n\nWait, perhaps the g array is the cumulative fall when moving from the end to the current position. \n\nWait, let me think of the example again. \n\nThe g array for the example is [1,1,0,0]. \n\ng[0] is 1. \n\ng[1] is 1. \n\ng[2] is 0. \n\ng[3] is 0. \n\nSo for position 0, the cumulative is 1. \n\nWhat does that represent? \n\nLooking at the code's logic for the else case, when x>y, the code should compute the damage as g[y-1] - g[x-1]. \n\nSo in the example, when moving from 3 (x=4) to 0 (y=1), the damage is g[0] - g[3] \u21921-0=1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: suppose the array is [5,4,3,2,1]. \n\nThen, moving from 0 to 4 (x=1 to y=5, so x<y, so using f array). \n\nThe f array would be:\n\nf[0] =0 \n\nf[1] =5-4=1 \n\nf[2] =1 + (4-3)=2 \n\nf[3] =2 + (3-2)=3 \n\nf[4] =3 + (2-1)=4 \n\nSo for x=1 (0-based 0) to y=5 (4), the damage is f[4] - f[0] =4. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nNow, if moving from 4 (position3) to 0 (position0), the damage would be the sum of each step's fall when moving left. \n\nEach step: \n\n3\u21922: 2 vs3 \u2192 no fall. \n\n2\u21921:3 vs4 \u2192 no, wait 3 is less than 4? Wait the array is [5,4,3,2,1]. \n\nWait, moving from 4 (position3) to 0 (position0):\n\nWait, the path is 4 (position3) \u21923 (position2) \u21922 (position1) \u21921 (position0). \n\nWait, the steps are moving left each time. \n\nThe fall damage for each step:\n\nAt step from 3 (value2) to 2 (3): 2 <3 \u2192 no fall. \n\nThen from 2 (3) to 1 (4): 3 <4 \u2192 no fall. \n\nThen from 1 (4) to 0 (5):4 <5 \u2192 no fall. \n\nTotal damage is 0. \n\nThe g array for this case would be:\n\nLet me compute it. \n\nc is [5,4,3,2,1]. \n\nn=5. \n\ng is initialized to [0,0,0,0,0]. \n\nLoop for i from 1 to 4 (since n=5, range(1,5) is 1,2,3,4). \n\ni=1:\n\n- -i is -1 (position4, value1). \n\n- -i-1 is -2 (position3, value2). \n\ng[3] = g[4] (0) + max(0, 1-2 \u2192-1 \u21920. So g[3] remains 0. \n\ni=2:\n\n- -i is -2 (position3, value2). \n\n- -i-1 is -3 (position2, value3). \n\ng[2] = g[3] (0) + max(0, 2-3 \u2192-1 \u21920. So g[2] is 0. \n\ni=3:\n\n- -i is -3 (position2, value3). \n\n- -i-1 is -4 (position1, value4). \n\ng[1] = g[2] (0) + max(0, 3-4 \u2192-1 \u21920. So g[1] is 0. \n\ni=4:\n\n- -i is -4 (position1, value4). \n\n- -i-1 is -5 (position0, value5). \n\ng[0] = g[1] (0) + max(0,4-5 \u2192-1 \u21920. So g[0] is 0. \n\nThus, the g array is [0,0,0,0,0]. \n\nSo when moving from position3 (x=4) to 0 (y=1), the damage is g[0] - g[3] \u21920-0=0, which is correct. \n\nSo the code for the else block is correct with that line. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1 is to print g[y-1] - g[x-1]. \n\nSo the program1's missing part is:\n\nprint(g[y-1] - g[x-1])\n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of swaps to prevent \"BAN\" from being a subsequence in the concatenated string. \n\nThe code given starts with handling n=1, which requires swapping first two characters. \n\nThe code then enters a loop where i starts at 2 and j at 3n. The loop is while i<j. The TODO is inside this loop. \n\nThe approach here is probably to find a way to break all possible \"BAN\" subsequences. Since the original string is \"BAN\" repeated n times, each \"BAN\" contributes to possible subsequences. \n\nThe minimal swaps would involve disrupting the structure. One possible way is to swap certain characters so that the Bs, As, Ns are not in the right order. \n\nThe note in the second example shows that swapping positions 2 and 6 (for n=2, the string is 6 characters) converts it to BNNBAA. \n\nLooking at the code's approach, perhaps the idea is to pair the B's with N's and A's in a way that breaks the sequence. \n\nThe code's current approach is to have i starting at 2 (the second B in the first \"BAN\"), and j at the end. \n\nWait, the code's loop is while i < j. The variables i and j are indices? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to swap the second character of each \"BAN\" block with some other character. \n\nAlternatively, the code may be trying to swap the A's and N's in some positions. \n\nLooking at the sample input for n=2, the solution swaps position 2 (the 'A' of the first BAN) with position 6 (the 'N' of the second BAN). \n\nThis would turn the string into BNNBAA. \n\nIn this modified string, there's no B followed by A followed by N. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to pair the A's and N's so that they are not in the correct order. \n\nAlternatively, the code may be trying to swap every second 'A' with an 'N' from later. \n\nAlternatively, the code may be trying to swap the A's with N's in such a way that all B's are followed by N's instead of A's. \n\nThe code's current loop is:\n\ni starts at 2, j at 3n. \n\nThe loop runs while i < j. \n\nInside the loop, the code needs to perform swaps. \n\nThe sample for n=2: \n\n3n is 6. \n\nInitially, i=2, j=6. \n\nThe loop runs once (since 2 <6). \n\nThe code would need to swap i and j. \n\nWait, in the sample solution, they swapped 2 and 6. \n\nSo perhaps the code is doing ans.append( (i, j) ), then incrementing i and decrementing j by 3 each time? \n\nWait, let's see for n=2:\n\nAfter the first swap (2 and6), then i becomes 2+3=5, j becomes6-3=3. Now i (5) is not less than j (3), so loop ends. \n\nThus, the swap count is 1, which matches the sample. \n\nAnother example: n=3. \n\nThe string is BANBANBAN (9 characters). \n\nThe code would start with i=2, j=9. \n\nFirst iteration: swap 2 and9 \u2192 then i becomes 5, j=6. \n\nThen, since 5 <6, next swap 5 and6 \u2192 then i becomes 8, j=3. \n\nWait, perhaps the step is to swap i and j, then add 3 to i and subtract 3 from j each time. \n\nWait, let's see for n=3:\n\nThe loop:\n\nInitially i=2, j=9. \n\nswap (2,9) \u2192 added to ans. \n\nThen i +=3 \u21925, j -=3 \u21926. \n\nNow i=5 <6 \u2192 swap (5,6). \n\nAdd to ans. \n\nNow i becomes 8, j=3 \u2192 loop ends. \n\nTotal swaps: 2. \n\nBut what's the effect? \n\nThe original string is positions 1-9: \n\n1:B, 2:A,3:N,4:B,5:A,6:N,7:B,8:A,9:N. \n\nAfter swapping 2 and9: \n\nposition2 is N, position9 is A. \n\nThen swapping 5 and6: \n\nposition5 (A) and6 (N) \u2192 swapped \u2192 position5 becomes N, 6 becomes A. \n\nThe new string would have:\n\npositions 2: N, 9:A. \n\npositions5:N,6:A. \n\nThis might break all BAN subsequences. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to swap every second A with an N from the end. \n\nThe code's loop is designed to swap the A's (position 2,5,8) with N's (positions3,6,9). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to swap the A's with N's in the same \"BAN\" block. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to pair the A's with N's from later blocks. \n\nThe code's loop is:\n\ni starts at 2 (the first A in the first BAN), j starts at 3n (the last N in the last BAN). \n\nEach iteration swaps i and j, then increments i by 3 and decrements j by 3. \n\nThis way, each swap is between an A and an N from a later block. \n\nThis would turn the A into an N and the N into an A, so that the \"BAN\" can't form. \n\nFor example, in the first sample (n=2):\n\nswap positions 2 (A) and 6 (N). \n\nThe first BAN becomes B N N, and the second BAN becomes B A A. \n\nThus, there's no B followed by A followed by N. \n\nThis approach would require n-1 swaps? Or for n=2, it's 1 swap. \n\nThe code's loop would run (n//something) times. \n\nThe code's loop is while i <j. \n\nEach iteration, i increases by 3, j decreases by 3. \n\nThe number of swaps would be floor((j -i)/6) or something. \n\nWait, for n=1, the code already handles it. \n\nFor n=3, the first swap is between 2 and9, then 5 and6 (since 2+3=5, 9-3=6). \n\nWait, 5 and6 are in the same block (the third BAN). \n\nSwapping them would turn the third BAN into B N A. \n\nHmm, but then the third BAN's A and N are swapped. \n\nThis way, the B is followed by N, so the subsequence BAN can't form. \n\nOverall, this approach might work. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nans.append( (i, j) )\n\nthen i +=3, j -=3. \n\nWait, the code's loop is while i <j:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nans.append( (i, j) )\n\ni +=3\n\nj -=3\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nwhile i < j:\n\n    ans.append( (i, j) )\n\n    i +=3\n\n    j -=3\n\nWait, but the indices in the problem are 1-based. \n\nYes, because the problem says \"swap indices i and j (1-based)\". \n\nSo in the code, the variables i and j are 1-based. \n\nThus, the code's loop is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2 is to append (i,j) to ans, then increment i by 3 and decrement j by 3. \n\nSo the code inside the while loop is:\n\nans.append( (i,j) )\n\ni +=3\n\nj -=3\n\nNow, program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. \n\nThe code given has a loop over i in range(len(a)), then for each i, it initializes t and temp. \n\nThe code then has two loops: one going backward (j =i-1) and another forward (k =i+1). \n\nThe forward loop (k) is filled, but the backward loop (j) is missing. \n\nThe problem requires that each element in b is strictly greater than all previous. \n\nThe approach here is to model the constraints. \n\nThe key idea is that for each position i, the value of b[i] must be greater than b[i-1]. \n\nSince each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i, the minimal steps would involve adjusting the b array such that each b[i] is as small as possible but still satisfying the constraints. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be trying all possible starting points (the for loop over i in range(len(a))). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to set the i-th element as a pivot and compute the required steps from there. \n\nLooking at the code's forward loop (k =i+1):\n\nprev is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, the code's forward loop:\n\nprev is 0. \n\nWait, the code for the forward part:\n\nprev is 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the required steps for the elements after i. \n\nWait, the code's forward loop:\n\nk starts at i+1. \n\nx is ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nThis seems to be ensuring that b[k] is at least prev +1. \n\nBecause each step, the previous element's value (prev) must be less than the current. \n\nThe minimal way to achieve this is to set b[k] to be at least prev +1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that is ceil( (prev +1 - b_prev)/a[k] ), but since b starts at 0, perhaps the code is assuming that the previous elements have been adjusted so that their b value is prev. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps required for the elements after i, assuming that the elements before i are fixed. \n\nThe backward loop (j =i-1) is missing. \n\nThe backward loop probably needs to compute the required steps for the elements before i. \n\nThe backward loop is while j >=0:\n\nIn this loop, we need to adjust b[j] so that it is less than the next element (b[j+1]). \n\nWait, but since we are going backward, perhaps the code is ensuring that each b[j] is as small as possible but still allows the next elements to be larger. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop is trying to compute the minimal steps required for the elements before i. \n\nThe code's forward loop for k starts with prev=0. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is to set the i-th element as a pivot, and compute the required steps for the elements before and after. \n\nThe backward loop (j =i-1) would need to track the previous required value. \n\nLet me think of the backward loop. \n\nSuppose we are processing elements before i. \n\nWe start from j =i-1 and go down to 0. \n\nThe idea is that for each j, the b[j] must be less than b[j+1]. \n\nBut since we are going backward, perhaps we need to track the minimal required value for b[j]. \n\nLet me think of the variables. \n\nIn the code, prev is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the backward loop is trying to compute the required steps for the elements before i. \n\nSuppose that for the j-th element (before i), the next element (j+1) has a certain value. \n\nThe current element's b[j] must be less than that. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to set b[j] as low as possible, but still allowing the next elements to be higher. \n\nAlternatively, the code may be trying to track the minimal required value for b[j], given the constraints from the next elements. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the array a is [1,2,3]. \n\nSuppose we choose i=2 (third element, 0-based). \n\nThen, the backward loop starts at j=1 (second element, 0-based?), and goes down to 0. \n\nWait, the code's variables are a bit confusing. \n\nThe code's backward loop is:\n\nprev =0 \n\nj =i-1 \n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    # TODO \n\nThe forward loop for k starts with prev=0. \n\nWait, perhaps the backward loop is trying to compute the required steps for the elements before i, ensuring that each b[j] is less than b[j+1]. \n\nThe code's forward loop for the elements after i is handling the forward direction. \n\nThe backward loop needs to handle the elements before i. \n\nThe backward loop's logic would be similar to the forward loop but in reverse. \n\nIn the forward loop, for each k, the required b[k] must be at least prev +1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that is ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] ), since b starts at 0. \n\nWait, the code's forward loop does:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nThis ensures that b[k] = a[k] *x, which is the minimal possible value >= prev+1. \n\nSimilarly, for the backward loop, we need to ensure that b[j] < b[j+1]. \n\nBut since we are going backward, perhaps the previous element (j) must be less than the next (j+1). \n\nLet me think of the backward loop. \n\nSuppose we have the next element (j+1) has a value of next_val. \n\nThen, the current element (j) must be less than next_val. \n\nThe minimal steps to achieve this would be to set b[j] as low as possible, but since we can subtract or add, perhaps the minimal steps are to set b[j] to be as small as possible but still less than next_val. \n\nWait, but since we can choose to subtract, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be as small as possible (so that it doesn't restrict the previous elements). \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop needs to track the maximum possible value that b[j] can have, given the constraints from the next elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but in reverse. \n\nSuppose that for the backward loop, we track the maximum possible value that b[j] can have, given that it must be less than b[j+1]. \n\nLet me think of variables. \n\nIn the backward loop, starting from j =i-1 down to 0. \n\nWe can track the maximum allowed value for b[j], which is (prev) -1, where prev is the value of b[j+1]. \n\nWait, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but in reverse. \n\nLet me see:\n\nIn the forward loop, the next element must be at least prev +1. \n\nIn the backward loop, the current element must be less than the next element. \n\nSo for the backward loop, the current element's b[j] must be less than the next element's b[j+1]. \n\nLet me denote next_val as the value of b[j+1]. \n\nThen, the maximum possible value for b[j] is next_val -1. \n\nBut since we can choose to subtract or add, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be as small as possible (so that it doesn't restrict the previous elements). \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be as large as possible but still less than next_val. \n\nWait, perhaps the backward loop is trying to compute the minimal steps required to ensure that b[j] is as large as possible but still less than b[j+1]. \n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but in reverse. \n\nSuppose that in the backward loop, we track the minimal required value for b[j], which must be less than the next element's value. \n\nLet me think of variables. \n\nSuppose that for the backward loop, we have a variable 'prev' which represents the minimal value that the next element (j+1) has. \n\nThen, the current element (j) must be less than prev. \n\nThe minimal steps to achieve this would be to set b[j] to be as large as possible but still less than prev. \n\nWait, but since we can choose to subtract or add, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be as close as possible to prev-1. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be (prev -1) divided by a[j], rounded down or up. \n\nHmm, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but in reverse. \n\nLet me think of the forward loop's logic again. \n\nIn the forward loop, for each k, the required b[k] must be at least prev +1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that is ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] ), because each move adds a_k. \n\nWait, the code's forward loop uses:\n\nx = ceil( (prev +1)/a[k] )\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[k] *x \n\nThis ensures that b[k] = a[k] *x, which is the minimal possible value >= prev+1. \n\nSimilarly, for the backward loop, the current element's b[j] must be less than the next element's b[j+1]. \n\nLet me denote next_val as the value of b[j+1]. \n\nThen, the current b[j] must be < next_val. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be as large as possible but still less than next_val. \n\nThe maximum possible value for b[j] is next_val -1. \n\nTo achieve this, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to next_val -1. \n\nBut since b starts at 0, the steps needed would be (next_val -1 - 0)/a[j], but since we can also subtract, perhaps it's better to compute the minimal steps to reach a value less than next_val. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be as large as possible but less than next_val. \n\nThe maximum possible value is next_val -1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that is ceil( (next_val -1)/a[j] ), but only if that is possible. \n\nWait, but if next_val is 5, and a[j] is 3, then the maximum possible b[j] is 4. \n\nTo get there, you can add 3 once (3) or twice (6 which is over). So the maximum possible is 3 (1 move). \n\nWait, 3*1=3 <5. \n\nAlternatively, you can add once (3) or subtract once (-3). \n\nThe minimal steps would be to choose the closest to next_val-1. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop should track the maximum possible value that b[j] can have, which is next_val -1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that value is the minimal number of moves to reach (next_val -1) from 0, using additions and subtractions. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the minimal between ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ) or something else. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps to reach a value less than next_val is to set b[j] to next_val -1, which requires ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ) additions. \n\nWait, but if next_val is small, like 1, then next_val-1 is 0, so no steps needed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but in reverse, with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nSo for the backward loop, the 'prev' variable would represent the maximum allowed value for the current element. \n\nWait, let's think of the backward loop variables. \n\nSuppose we have a variable 'prev' which is the value of b[j+1]. \n\nThen, the current element's b[j] must be less than prev. \n\nThe maximum possible value for b[j] is prev-1. \n\nTo achieve this, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to prev-1. \n\nThe number of steps is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ), since each move adds a[j]. \n\nWait, but if prev-1 is negative, then we can subtract. \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop should track the minimal required steps to ensure that b[j] < b[j+1]. \n\nThe code's forward loop uses prev to track the minimal required value for the next element. \n\nIn the backward loop, perhaps we need to track the maximum allowed value for the current element. \n\nLet me try to model this. \n\nInitialize prev as the value of b[j+1]. \n\nThe current element's b[j] must be less than prev. \n\nThe maximum possible value for b[j] is prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that value is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ), but only if that is possible. \n\nWait, but if prev-1 is negative, then we can subtract. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps would be the minimal steps to reach a value less than prev. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to set b[j] to be as large as possible but less than prev. \n\nThe maximum possible value is prev-1. \n\nThe steps needed to reach that is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ), but only if that is non-negative. \n\nAlternatively, if prev-1 is negative, then the minimal steps would be to subtract as much as possible. \n\nWait, this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the backward loop should be similar to the forward loop but in reverse, with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nSo, in the backward loop, for each j from i-1 down to 0:\n\nThe next element (j+1) has a value of next_val. \n\nThe current element's b[j] must be less than next_val. \n\nThe maximum possible value for b[j] is next_val -1. \n\nTo achieve this, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to next_val-1. \n\nThe steps needed are ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ), but only if that is possible. \n\nWait, but if next_val-1 is negative, then we can set b[j] to a negative number, which requires subtracting. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the minimal between adding or subtracting. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps to reach a value less than next_val is the minimal steps to reach next_val-1. \n\nThe steps would be the minimal between:\n\nceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ) \u2192 if next_val-1 is positive. \n\nOr, if next_val-1 is negative, then the minimal steps would be to subtract as much as possible. \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nSo, in the backward loop, the 'prev' variable represents the maximum allowed value for the current element. \n\nWait, let me think of the forward loop's variables. \n\nIn the forward loop, prev starts at 0. \n\nFor each k, the next element must be at least prev+1. \n\nThe current element's b[k] is set to a[k] *x, where x is the minimal steps to reach at least prev+1. \n\nThus, the forward loop ensures that each step is as small as possible but still meets the requirement. \n\nFor the backward loop, the current element must be less than the next element's value. \n\nSuppose that the next element's value is next_val. \n\nThen, the current element's b[j] must be less than next_val. \n\nThe maximal possible value for b[j] is next_val-1. \n\nTo achieve this, the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to next_val-1. \n\nThe steps needed would be ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ), but only if that is possible. \n\nWait, but if next_val is 0, then next_val-1 is -1, so we can subtract once. \n\nAlternatively, the steps would be the minimal steps to reach a value less than next_val. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to set b[j] to next_val-1. \n\nThe steps needed would be the minimal steps to reach that value. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the minimal between adding or subtracting. \n\nWait, but since we can choose to add or subtract, the minimal steps to reach a target value is ceil( |target| / a[j] ), but the direction depends on the target. \n\nWait, the target is next_val-1. \n\nIf next_val-1 is positive, then we need to add a[j] x times to reach it. \n\nThe minimal x is ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ). \n\nIf next_val-1 is negative, then we need to subtract a[j] x times. \n\nThe minimal x is ceil( (abs(next_val-1))/a[j] ). \n\nThus, the steps would be ceil( abs(next_val-1)/a[j] ). \n\nBut how to track this in the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop can track the maximum allowed value for the current element. \n\nLet me try to model this. \n\nInitialize prev as the value of the next element (b[j+1]). \n\nThe current element's b[j] must be less than prev. \n\nThe maximum possible value is prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that value is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 is positive. \n\nIf prev-1 is negative, then the minimal steps is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) but since it's negative, we can subtract. \n\nWait, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nprev = next_val \n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nif required <0: \n\n    required = -inf \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the steps needed are the minimal steps to reach a value less than prev. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to set b[j] to the maximum possible value less than prev. \n\nThe maximum possible value is prev-1. \n\nThe steps needed to reach that is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 >=0. \n\nElse, we can set it to a very low value (like -infinity) with steps 0? \n\nAlternatively, the steps are ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 is non-negative. \n\nElse, the steps are 0 (since we can set it to 0 by not doing anything, but that might not be less than prev. \n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps the backward loop should be similar to the forward loop but with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nThus, the backward loop would track the maximum allowed value for the current element. \n\nLet me try to write the code for the backward loop. \n\nIn the code's backward loop:\n\nprev is initialized to 0. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the code's forward loop starts with prev=0. \n\nBut in the backward loop, perhaps the initial prev is the value of the next element. \n\nWait, let me think of the backward loop variables. \n\nThe backward loop starts at j =i-1, and goes down to 0. \n\nThe next element (j+1) has a certain value. \n\nLet me denote next_val as the value of b[j+1]. \n\nThe current element's b[j] must be less than next_val. \n\nThe maximum possible value for b[j] is next_val-1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that value is ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ), but only if next_val-1 is non-negative. \n\nElse, we can set it to a lower value with fewer steps. \n\nAlternatively, the steps needed are the minimal steps to reach a value less than next_val. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to set b[j] to next_val-1. \n\nThe steps needed are ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ) if next_val-1 is positive. \n\nIf next_val-1 is negative, then the steps are ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ), but since it's negative, the minimal steps would be to subtract. \n\nWait, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nrequired = next_val -1 \n\nx = ceil( required / a[j] ) \n\nBut if required is negative, then x can be negative, but since steps can't be negative, perhaps we need to take the absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, the steps are the minimal steps to reach a value less than next_val. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to set b[j] to next_val-1. \n\nThe steps needed are ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ) if next_val-1 is positive. \n\nIf next_val-1 is negative, then the steps are ceil( (next_val-1)/a[j] ), but since that would be negative, we can set it to 0 steps (since we can have b[j] =0, which is less than next_val if next_val is positive). \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nThus, the backward loop would track the maximum allowed value for the current element. \n\nLet me try to write the code for the backward loop. \n\nIn the backward loop:\n\nprev is initialized to the value of the next element (b[j+1]). \n\nThe current element's b[j] must be less than prev. \n\nThe maximum possible value is prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that value is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ) if prev-1 is non-negative. \n\nElse, the steps are 0 (since we can set it to 0, which is less than prev). \n\nWait, but how to track this. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop can be written as:\n\nprev = next_val \n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nif required <0: \n\n    required = -infinity \n\nx = ceil( required / a[j] ) \n\nBut this might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop's code is similar to the forward loop but with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nThus, the backward loop would have:\n\nprev = next_val \n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nx = ceil( required / a[j] ) \n\nBut if required is negative, then the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to a value less than prev, which can be done with 0 steps (if prev is positive). \n\nAlternatively, the code for the backward loop is:\n\nprev = next_val \n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nif required <0: \n\n    required = -infinity \n\nx = ceil( (required)/a[j] ) \n\nBut this might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop's code is:\n\nprev = next_val \n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nif required <0: \n\n    required = -infinity \n\nx = ceil( (required)/a[j] ) \n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[j] *x \n\nWait, but this would set b[j] to a[j]*x, which must be less than prev. \n\nThus, a[j]*x < prev \u2192 x < prev/a[j]. \n\nSo x is the floor( (prev-1)/a[j] ). \n\nWait, perhaps the code should be:\n\nx = (prev-1) // a[j] \n\nif (prev-1) % a[j] !=0: \n\n    x +=1 \n\nBut this is equivalent to ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ). \n\nThus, the code for the backward loop would be:\n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nx = ceil( required / a[j] ) \n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[j] *x \n\nBut this would ensure that b[j] = a[j]*x \u2264 required. \n\nThus, the code for the backward loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = prev -1 \n\n    if required <0:\n\n        required = -float('inf')\n\n    # compute x as the minimal steps to reach required \n\n    if a[j] ==0:\n\n        # but a[j] is given as positive \n\n    x = (required + a[j] -1 ) // a[j] \n\n    # ceil division \n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nWait, but how to handle when required is negative. \n\nIf required is negative, then the maximum possible value is required (which is negative), so the minimal steps would be to set b[j] to required. \n\nBut since required is negative, the steps would be ceil( required / a[j] ), which would be negative. \n\nBut steps can't be negative. \n\nHmm, perhaps when required is negative, the minimal steps is 0, because we can set b[j] to 0 (by not doing any moves), which is less than prev. \n\nWait, if prev is the next element's value, then if prev is positive, then 0 is less than prev. \n\nThus, in this case, the steps needed are 0. \n\nSo when required is negative (prev-1 <0 \u2192 prev <=0), then the steps needed are 0. \n\nThus, the code for the backward loop would be:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    next_val = prev \n\n    required = next_val -1 \n\n    if required <0: \n\n        # can set to 0 \n\n        x =0 \n\n    else: \n\n        x = ceil( required / a[j] ) \n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nWait, but how to compute ceil( required /a[j] ). \n\nIn Python, ceil can be done via (required + a[j] -1 ) // a[j] \n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    next_val = prev \n\n    required = next_val -1 \n\n    if required <0: \n\n        x =0 \n\n    else: \n\n        x = (required + a[j] -1 ) // a[j] \n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nWait, but initially, prev is set to 0 before the loop. \n\nWait, looking back at the code given for program3.py:\n\nThe code has:\n\nprev =0 \n\nj =i-1 \n\nwhile j>=0:\n\n    # TODO \n\nThen, after the backward loop, the forward loop starts with prev=0 again. \n\nWait, this suggests that the backward loop is using prev as the next element's value. \n\nWait, perhaps the initial prev is set to the value of the next element (b[j+1]). \n\nWait, the code's backward loop is processing elements before i. \n\nThe first element in the backward loop is j =i-1. \n\nThe next element (j+1) is i. \n\nThe value of b[i] is determined by the forward loop. \n\nWait, perhaps the initial prev is the value of b[j+1], which is the next element. \n\nThus, the code should track the previous value as the next element's value. \n\nWait, the code's backward loop is:\n\nprev is initialized to 0 before the loop. \n\nBut that might be incorrect. \n\nWait, the code's initial setup is:\n\nprev =0 \n\nj =i-1 \n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    # TODO \n\nSo the first iteration is j =i-1. \n\nThe next element (j+1) is i. \n\nThe value of b[i] is not yet computed. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's maximum allowed value. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's backward loop is supposed to track the maximum allowed value for the current element, which is the next element's value minus 1. \n\nThus, the code's backward loop should start with prev being the value of the next element. \n\nBut how is that tracked? \n\nPerhaps the code should initialize prev to the value of the next element (b[j+1]). \n\nBut since the next element's value is determined by the forward loop, which hasn't been computed yet, this is a problem. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to choose a pivot i and compute the required steps for the elements before and after. \n\nThe forward loop computes the steps for elements after i, ensuring they are increasing. \n\nThe backward loop computes the steps for elements before i, ensuring they are less than the next element. \n\nThe initial prev for the backward loop should be the value of the next element (b[j+1]). \n\nBut since the next element's value is determined by the forward loop, which hasn't been computed yet, this is a problem. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's backward loop is using the forward's prev as the initial value. \n\nWait, the code's forward loop starts with prev=0. \n\nThis suggests that the backward loop is not properly tracking the previous values. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach for the backward loop is to track the maximum allowed value for the current element, which is the previous element's value minus 1. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop should track the minimal required value for the current element. \n\nWait, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but in reverse. \n\nThe forward loop ensures that each element is at least prev+1. \n\nThe backward loop should ensure that each element is less than the next element. \n\nThus, the backward loop's prev represents the maximum allowed value for the current element. \n\nThe maximum allowed value is the next element's value minus 1. \n\nThus, the backward loop's code would be:\n\nprev = next_val \n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nx = ceil( required / a[j] ) \n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[j] *x \n\nBut how to track next_val. \n\nThe next_val is the value of the next element (j+1). \n\nThus, the backward loop should start with prev being the value of the next element. \n\nBut since the next element's value is determined by the forward loop, which hasn't been computed yet, this is a problem. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's value. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's value and ensure that the current element is less than it. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the code's backward loop is processing the elements before the pivot i, and the forward loop processes after. \n\nThe pivot i is treated as a starting point, and the backward loop ensures that the elements before i are less than the pivot's value. \n\nThe forward loop ensures that elements after are increasing. \n\nThus, the backward loop's prev should be the value of the current element's next (j+1). \n\nFor example, when processing j =i-1, the next element is i. \n\nThe value of the next element (i) is determined by the forward loop. \n\nBut the forward loop hasn't been executed yet. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's value. \n\nAlternatively, the code's backward loop is supposed to track the maximum allowed value for the current element, which is the previous element's value minus 1. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. \n\nPerhaps the correct code for the backward loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    x = (prev -1) // a[j]\n\n    if (prev -1) % a[j] !=0:\n\n        x +=1\n\n    temp +=x\n\n    prev = a[j] *x\n\n    j -=1\n\nBut this assumes that the next element's value is prev. \n\nWait, perhaps the backward loop is similar to the forward loop but with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nThus, the backward loop's prev is the value of the next element. \n\nThe current element's maximum allowed value is prev-1. \n\nThe minimal steps to reach that value is ceil( (prev-1)/a[j] ). \n\nThus, the code for the backward loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = prev -1 \n\n    if required <0:\n\n        x =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        x = (required + a[j] -1) // a[j]\n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nBut the initial prev is set to 0 before the loop. \n\nThis would mean that for the first iteration (j =i-1), the next element's value is 0. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThus, the initial prev should be the value of the next element (b[j+1]). \n\nBut since the next element's value is determined by the forward loop, which hasn't been computed yet, this is a problem. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's value. \n\nAlternatively, the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's value and ensure that the current element is less than it. \n\nWait, the backward loop is going from j =i-1 down to 0. \n\nThe next element (j+1) is the element after j. \n\nThe current element's b[j] must be less than b[j+1]. \n\nThus, the backward loop's prev should be the value of b[j+1]. \n\nBut since the forward loop hasn't been run yet, the value of b[j+1] is not known. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's value. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to set the pivot i's value to zero and compute the required steps for the elements before and after. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct code for the backward loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    x = (prev -1 + a[j] -1) // a[j]\n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nBut this is a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the backward loop should be similar to the forward loop but with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nThus, the backward loop's code is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = prev -1 \n\n    if required <0:\n\n        required = -float('inf')\n\n    x = (required + a[j] -1) // a[j] \n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nBut the initial prev is set to 0. \n\nThis would mean that for the first iteration (j =i-1), the required is -1. \n\nThus, x is 0. \n\nprev becomes 0. \n\nThen, the next iteration (j =i-2) would have prev=0. \n\nThis would set the required to -1 again. \n\nThis would set all elements before i to 0. \n\nThis might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the backward loop should start with prev being the value of the next element. \n\nBut since the next element's value is determined by the forward loop, which hasn't been computed yet, this is not possible. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the backward loop in a different way. \n\nThe minimal steps for the backward loop would be to ensure that each element is as small as possible but still allows the next elements to be larger. \n\nThe backward loop should track the maximum possible value for the current element, which is the next element's value minus 1. \n\nThus, the code for the backward loop is:\n\nprev = next_val \n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nx = ceil( required / a[j] ) \n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[j] *x \n\nBut since next_val is the value of the next element, which is determined by the forward loop, this requires that the backward loop is processed after the forward loop. \n\nBut in the code, the backward loop is processed before the forward loop. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's value. \n\nAlternatively, the code's backward loop is supposed to track the previous element's value and ensure that the current element is less than it. \n\nThus, the backward loop's prev is the value of the previous element. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the backward loop should be similar to the forward loop but with the condition that the current element must be less than the next. \n\nThus, the code for the backward loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = prev -1 \n\n    if required <0:\n\n        x =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        x = (required + a[j] -1) // a[j] \n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nThis is the code that would be placed in the backward loop's TODO section. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = prev -1 \n\n    if required <0:\n\n        x =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        x = (required + a[j] -1) // a[j]\n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nBut in code terms, this would be written as:\n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nif required <0:\n\n    x =0 \n\nelse:\n\n    x = (required + a[j] -1) // a[j]\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[j] *x \n\nj -=1 \n\nWait, but this is inside the loop. \n\nThus, the code for the backward loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = prev -1 \n\n    if required <0:\n\n        x =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        x = (required + a[j] -1) // a[j]\n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is this loop's body. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe missing code for program3's backward loop is:\n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nif required <0:\n\n    x =0 \n\nelse:\n\n    x = (required + a[j] -1) // a[j]\n\ntemp +=x \n\nprev = a[j] *x \n\nj -=1 \n\nBut this is inside the while loop. \n\nThus, the code for the backward loop is:\n\nwhile j >=0:\n\n    required = prev -1 \n\n    if required <0:\n\n        x =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        x = (required + a[j] -1) // a[j]\n\n    temp +=x \n\n    prev = a[j] *x \n\n    j -=1 \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is this loop's body. \n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nProgram1: print(g[y-1] - g[x-1])\n\nProgram2: ans.append( (i,j) ), then i +=3, j -=3 \n\nProgram3: the backward loop's code as above. \n\nNow, formatting the answers as JSON:\n\nFor program1's missing part: \n\nThe else block's code is print(g[y-1] - g[x-1])\n\nFor program2's missing part: \n\nInside the while loop:\n\nans.append( (i,j) )\n\ni +=3 \n\nj -=3 \n\nThus, the code is:\n\nans.append( (i,j) )\n\ni +=3\n\nj -=3 \n\nFor program3's missing part: \n\nThe code inside the while loop (j >=0):\n\nrequired = prev -1 \n\nif
