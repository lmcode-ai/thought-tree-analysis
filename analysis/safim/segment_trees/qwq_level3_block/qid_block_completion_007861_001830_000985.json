Similarly, if a_i is negative, then the multiples go in the negative direction. Wait, but the problem requires s_i to be strictly greater than s_{i-1}. So for each i, given s_{i-1}, we need to choose s_i such that s_i > s_{i-1}, and s_i is a multiple of a_i. The minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing the closest multiple of a_i to zero that is still greater than s_{i-1}. Wait, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, the minimal |k_i| is achieved when s_i is as close as possible to s_{i-1} but still greater. Let me formalize this. Suppose a_i is positive.

Similarly, if a_i is negative, then m must be such that m*a_i > s_{i-1}. Since a_i is negative, m must be less than s_{i-1}/a_i (since dividing by a negative flips the inequality).

Another example: s_prev =-5, a_i=3: -5/3 is ~-1.666, floor is -2. So m =-2 +1 =-1. Wait, but m=-1 gives -3, which is not greater than -5. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, in this case, s_prev is -5, a_i is 3. We need m*3 >-5. The minimal m is the smallest integer m where m*3 >-5. Possible m can be -1 (since -3 >-5?), yes. Wait, -3 is greater than -5.

Alternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer m where m > s_prev/a_i, and m is as close to zero as possible. Let me think of the following steps: \n\nLet x = s_prev / a_i \n\nWe need m >x. The minimal |m| is achieved by the smallest m in integers greater than x, closest to zero. So possible candidates are: If x is negative: \n\nThe minimal m is 0 if 0 >x. \n\nElse, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nWait, for example, x =-1.666, then m can be -1, 0, etc. The minimal |m| is 0. So in this case, m=0 is better than m=-1. So the correct m is 0. Another example: x=1.333 \u2192 m must be 2. Another example: x=2 \u2192 m must be 3. Another example: x= -0.5 \u2192 m can be 0 (since 0 >-0.5). So the algorithm is: \n\nIf a_i is positive : \n\nCompute x = s_prev / a_i \n\nWe need m >x.",

Alternative approach: \n\nThe minimal moves are achieved by setting each b_i to the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, while minimizing the |k_i|.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about rearranging icons on a desktop so that it's \"good\". The key is to find the minimal moves after each query. The code provided has some missing parts, especially in the query function. Let me look at the code again.\n\nThe variables c and cc are being used. From the code, c seems to track the total number of icons, and cc the count of icons in the correct positions? The function query(y, x) toggles the presence of an icon at (y,x). The problem is that when an icon is removed, especially if it was part of the current 'good' prefix, we need to adjust cc properly. \n\nIn the else clause (when p[i] is set to False), if the icon was part of the current 'good' columns (i < c), then removing it would decrease cc. But the code has a comment there. The current code subtracts 1 from c, but maybe we need to adjust cc here. Wait, the code for when we remove an icon: if the icon was part of the first c columns (since i < c), then cc would have counted it, so we need to subtract 1 from cc. Then, after decrementing c, check if the new c-th position (since c is now one less) is still an icon. Hmm, maybe the code is incomplete here. \n\nThe main issue is that when an icon is removed from a position before c, the current cc might have included it, so we need to subtract that. The code currently has a TODO there. So the missing line would be something like: if p[i] was true before, then subtract 1 from cc. Wait, but since p[i] is being set to false, perhaps before the toggle, we need to check the previous state. Wait, the function is called with query(y,x), which toggles p[i]. So before the toggle, the previous value was p[i], and after, it's flipped. \n\nWait, the code starts with p[i] = not p[i]. So before that line, the original value was stored. Wait, no: the line is p[i] = not p[i], so the new value is the opposite of the old. So when we are in the else clause (the icon was present before, now being removed), then before the toggle, p[i] was True. So in the else clause, the previous value was True, so if i < c, then that icon was part of the count cc, so we need to subtract 1 from cc here. So the missing code is: if p[i] was True before (since now it's being set to False), and if i < c, then subtract 1 from cc. \n\nWait, but in the code, the 'else' clause is when the icon is being removed. So before the toggle, the icon was present. So the code should have:\n\nprev = p[i]\np[i] = not prev\n\nWait, but in the code, the line is p[i] = not p[i], so the previous value was p[i], and after the toggle, it's the opposite. So in the else clause (the new value is False, so previous was True), so the code should check if the previous was True and i < c, then subtract 1 from cc. \n\nSo in the else block, after the toggle, the previous value was True. So the code should have:\n\nif i < c:\n    cc -= 1\n\nThen, after that, c is decremented. Then, check if the new c (after decrement) has p[c] as True, so adjust cc accordingly. \n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nelse:\n    if i < c:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    c -= 1\n    if p[c]:\n        cc -= 1\n\nWait, but after setting p[i] to False, the code is in the else clause. So the previous value was True, so if i was in the first c columns (i < c), then that icon was part of the count. So the missing code here is to subtract 1 from cc. So the code should be:\n\nif i < c:\n    cc -= 1\n\nSo the missing line is \"cc -= 1\".\n\nThen, after that, when we decrement c, we check if the new c (the previous c-1) has p[c] (since c is now decreased by 1) as True. So if p[c] is True, then since we are moving the end of the good columns back, that icon is now part of the current count. Wait, perhaps the code is correct here. \n\nSo the missing code in the else block's first if is to subtract 1 from cc. \n\nSo the program1's missing code is that line. \n\nNow moving to program2.py. The problem is to find the minimal swaps to remove all \"BAN\" subsequences from the string formed by n repetitions of \"BAN\". \n\nThe approach here is to break the string into parts so that there's no way to form the subsequence \"B\", \"A\", \"N\" in order. The minimal swaps would involve disrupting the structure. \n\nThe sample for n=1: swap first two characters to get \"ABN\", so the B comes after A, so the subsequence can't form. \n\nFor n=2, the sample swaps the second character (A in first \"BAN\") with the sixth (the last A?), resulting in \"BNNBAA\". Now, there's no B followed by A followed by N. \n\nThe code for n>2 has a loop that runs d = ceil(n/2) times, and swaps the first and last characters? Or some pattern. \n\nThe code's current structure for n>2 is to print d (ceil(n/2)), then loop d times, swapping i and j starting from 1 and 3n. \n\nWait, the code initializes i=1 and j=3*n. Then for each iteration, perhaps swapping the first B with the last N, then moving inward. \n\nThe idea might be to pair each \"BAN\" block and swap the B with the N of another block, so that the Bs and Ns are not in the right order. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal swaps would be to pair each B with a N from a later block, so that the B's are after the N's, preventing the subsequence. \n\nFor example, for n=3, the string is BANBANBAN. To prevent any B followed by A followed by N, perhaps swap the first B with the last N, so the first character becomes N, and the last becomes B. Then the string becomes N...B. Then the Bs are not in the right order. \n\nEach swap would handle two BANs? Or each swap reduces the number of possible BANs. \n\nThe code's approach for n>2 is to do ceil(n/2) swaps. For example, when n=3, ceil(3/2)=2. So two swaps. \n\nThe first swap would be between 1 and 9 (positions 1 and 9 in 1-based). The second between 4 and 6? Or maybe between 2 and 8? \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\ni starts at 1, j at 3*n. Then for each iteration, swap i and j, then perhaps increment i and decrement j. \n\nWait, the code's current code for the loop is:\n\nfor _ in range(d):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe code needs to output the swaps. The sample for n=2 uses swapping position 2 and 6 (the second character of first BAN and the sixth of the second BAN). \n\nHmm, perhaps the general approach is to swap the A in each BAN with the N in another BAN, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of swaps is ceil(n/2). The way to do this is to pair each BAN block with another, swapping their B and N. \n\nWait, for n=3, the first BAN and the third BAN can be swapped so that the first B becomes N and the third N becomes B. This way, the first BAN becomes N... and the third becomes B... So the Bs are not in the right order. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to swap the first character (B) with the last character (N), then the second B with the second last N, etc. \n\nSo for n=3, the first swap is between 1 and 9 (positions 1 and 9), the second between 4 and 6 (since 3*3=9, so next would be 4 and 6? Wait, 3n is 9, so after first swap, next i would be 4, j=8? \n\nWait, the code's initial i and j are 1 and 3n. Then, in each iteration, swap i and j, then increment i by 3, decrement j by 3? \n\nWait, perhaps the code is supposed to swap the first B with the last N, then the next B (position 4) with the previous N (position 6), etc. \n\nSo for each pair of B and N from opposite ends, swap them. \n\nSo for n=3, the first swap is 1 and 9 (positions 1 and 9), the second swap is 4 and 6 (positions 4 and 6). \n\nThis way, each B is paired with an N from the end, so that the B comes after the N, preventing the subsequence. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is ceil(n/2). For n=3, ceil(3/2)=2. \n\nSo the code's loop should output these pairs. \n\nThe code's variables i and j start at 1 and 3n. Then, in each iteration, swap i and j, then i +=3, j -=3. \n\nWait, in the code, the loop is for _ in range(d), and in each iteration, the code needs to print the current i and j, then update i and j. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor _ in range(d):\n    print(i, j)\n    i +=3\n    j -=3\n\nWait, but the code's variables are outside the loop. So after each iteration, i and j are updated. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport math\n\nfor _ in [0]*int(input()):\n    n=int(input())\n    if n==1:\n        print(\"1\")\n        print(\"1 2\")\n    elif n==2:\n        print(\"1\")\n        print(\"2 6\")\n    else:\n        d=math.ceil(n/2)\n        print(d)\n        i=1\n        j=3*n\n        for _ in range(d):\n            print(i, j)\n            i +=3\n            j -=3\n\nWait, but let's test for n=3. The swaps would be (1,9), (4,6). \n\nThe first swap swaps the first B with the last N. The second swaps the second B (position 4) with the sixth character (which is the N of the second BAN). \n\nAfter these swaps, the string would be N A N B A N B A B? Not sure, but the idea is that the Bs and Ns are swapped so that the B comes after N, so the subsequence can't form. \n\nThis seems plausible. \n\nNow for program3.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. \n\nThe code provided has some functions f and e, but the main part is the c function which is supposed to compute the minimal moves. The code is incomplete in the loop inside e. \n\nThe approach for this problem is similar to the classic problem where you have to make the array non-decreasing with minimal increments. But here, each element can be adjusted by multiples of a_i (since each move adds or subtracts a_i). \n\nWait, the problem allows adding or subtracting a_i any number of times. So the minimal moves for each b_i is to reach a certain value, but the constraints are that each b_i must be strictly greater than all previous. \n\nThe key is to model the required constraints. Let's think of the required b array. Let's denote the required b array as b1, b2, ..., bn. \n\nEach b_i can be written as b_i = initial (0) plus k_i * a_i, where k_i can be any integer (positive or negative). \n\nThe constraints are b_i > b_{i-1} for all i >=2. \n\nWe need to find the minimal total |k_1| + |k_2| + ... + |k_n|. \n\nAlternatively, since each step is adding or subtracting a_i, the minimal steps are the sum of |delta_i / a_i|, where delta_i is the change needed. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nThe standard approach for such problems is to work from left to right, ensuring that each b_i is at least b_{i-1} +1. \n\nWait, but since each b_i can be adjusted by multiples of a_i, perhaps we can model the required b_i in terms of the previous. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nWe need to choose for each i a value b_i such that:\n\nb_i = 0 + k_i * a_i \n\nand \n\nb_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n \n\nThe minimal total |k_1| + |k_2| + ... + |k_n|. \n\nHmm, but how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, since each b_i can be any multiple of a_i (since you can add or subtract any number of times), but the constraints are that each b_i must be strictly greater than the previous. \n\nWait, but the problem allows any b_i, as long as each is strictly larger than the previous. The minimal steps would be to choose the minimal possible adjustments so that the sequence is increasing. \n\nThis seems similar to the problem where each element has a certain \"step\" and you have to adjust them to form an increasing sequence with minimal cost. \n\nThe standard approach for such problems is dynamic programming, but given the constraints (n up to 5000), that might not be feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a greedy approach can work. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required b_i. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nWe need to set b_1 to some value, then b_2 must be at least b_1 +1, and must be a multiple of a_2 (since it's 0 plus k_2 *a_2). Wait no, the b_i can be any value, but the steps are adding or subtracting a_i each time. So the minimal steps to reach a certain value is the minimal number of steps (each step is +/- a_i) to reach that value. \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach a target value for b_i is |target / a_i|, but only if target is a multiple of a_i. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, no. Because each step adds or subtracts a_i. So the possible values of b_i are exactly the integers congruent to 0 mod a_i. Wait, no, because each step adds or subtracts a_i. So the possible values are all integers of the form 0 + k*a_i, where k is any integer. So the possible b_i must be multiples of a_i. \n\nWait, the problem says that each move can add or subtract a_i. So the total change for b_i is k_i * a_i, where k_i is any integer (positive or negative). So the final b_i must be equal to k_i * a_i. \n\nTherefore, the constraints are that for all i>1, k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. \n\nWe need to choose integers k_1, k_2,...,k_n such that this holds, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nThis is the key. \n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing k_i's such that a_1 k_1 < a_2 k_2 < ... < a_n k_n, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nHmm, how to model this? \n\nLet me think of the variables in terms of the previous terms. \n\nLet me denote the required sequence as s_1 = a_1 k_1, s_2 = a_2 k_2, etc. \n\nWe need s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_n. \n\nThe goal is to choose s_i such that s_i is a multiple of a_i, and the sum of |s_i/(a_i)| is minimized. \n\nAlternatively, since s_i = a_i * k_i, the sum is sum |k_i|. \n\nSo the problem is to choose k_i's such that a_1 k_1 < a_2 k_2 < ... < a_n k_n, and the sum of |k_i| is as small as possible. \n\nThis seems challenging. \n\nPerhaps a dynamic programming approach where for each position i, we track the minimal sum up to i given that s_i is some value. But with n up to 5000, this might be too slow. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this greedily. \n\nLet me think of the process step by step. \n\nStart with the first element. \n\nWe can choose k_1 to be any integer. The minimal |k_1| is 0, but then s_1 =0. However, the next element must have s_2 >0. \n\nWait, but the second element's s_2 must be greater than s_1. \n\nSuppose we choose k_1 as 0. Then s_1 =0. Then s_2 must be at least a_2 *1 (since it has to be greater than 0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing k_1 as -1 would allow s_1 = -a_1, so s_2 can be 0 (if a_2 is positive). \n\nHmm, but the minimal steps would be to choose the smallest possible k_i's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to set each s_i as the minimal possible value that is greater than s_{i-1}, and also a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, but how to do that? \n\nLet me think of the first element. \n\nSuppose we set s_1 as the minimal possible (to minimize |k_1|). \n\nSuppose s_1 is 0 (k_1=0). Then s_2 must be at least 1. The minimal s_2 is the smallest multiple of a_2 greater than 0. That would be a_2 *1 (if a_2 is positive). \n\nBut then the cost is 1. \n\nAlternatively, if a_2 is negative, then the minimal s_2 would be a_2 * (-1), but that might be less than 0. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into choosing s_i such that s_i is the minimal possible (in absolute terms) given the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem of making an array non-decreasing with minimal increments: \n\nWe can process the array from left to right, ensuring that each s_i is at least s_{i-1} +1. \n\nBut since s_i must be a multiple of a_i, we need to find the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than s_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but the direction depends on the sign of a_i. \n\nAlternatively, for each i, given the previous s_{i-1}, we can compute the minimal possible s_i that is a multiple of a_i and greater than s_{i-1}, and also has the minimal |k_i|. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nLet me think of s_i as the minimal possible value greater than s_{i-1}, but also a multiple of a_i. \n\nSuppose a_i is positive. Then the minimal s_i is the smallest multiple of a_i greater than s_{i-1}. \n\nSimilarly, if a_i is negative, then the multiples go in the negative direction. \n\nWait, but the problem requires s_i to be strictly greater than s_{i-1}. \n\nSo for each i, given s_{i-1}, we need to choose s_i such that s_i > s_{i-1}, and s_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing the closest multiple of a_i to zero that is still greater than s_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but that might not be possible. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal |k_i| is achieved when s_i is as close as possible to s_{i-1} but still greater. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nSuppose a_i is positive. \n\nWe need s_i = m * a_i, where m is an integer, and m * a_i > s_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal |m| would be achieved by the smallest m such that m*a_i > s_{i-1}. \n\nSimilarly, if a_i is negative, then m must be such that m*a_i > s_{i-1}. Since a_i is negative, m must be less than s_{i-1}/a_i (since dividing by a negative flips the inequality). \n\nWait, this is getting a bit too involved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by greedily choosing the minimal possible s_i each time. \n\nLet me try an example. \n\nTake the first sample input from the problem's note: \n\nExample 1: \n\nInput array a is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. \n\nThe solution is to subtract a_1 (1) from b_1 (so k_1 = -1, s_1 = -1), and add a_3, a_4, a_5 to their respective b's. \n\nSo s_1 = -1, s_2 =0 (k_2=0), s_3 =3 (k_3=1), s_4=4 (k_4=1), s_5=5 (k_5=1). \n\nThe total moves are 1 (for k_1) + 1 +1 +1 =4. \n\nWait, but the moves are the sum of |k_i|. \n\nWait, the moves are the number of steps. Each step is adding or subtracting a_i once. So the total steps for each b_i is |k_i|. \n\nSo the total is |k_1| + |k_2| + ... + |k_n|. \n\nIn the example, the steps are |-1| + 0 +1 +1 +1 = 4, which matches. \n\nSo the approach here was to set s_1 as low as possible (so that s_2 can be 0, which is higher than s_1). \n\nHmm, so the key is to choose s_i as small as possible (in terms of |k_i|) while still being greater than s_{i-1}. \n\nLet me think of the algorithm step by step. \n\nInitialize s_prev = -infinity (or 0 for the first element). \n\nWait, for the first element, there's no previous. So s_1 can be any multiple of a_1. To minimize |k_1|, we can set s_1 to 0 (k_1=0). \n\nBut then s_2 must be greater than 0. \n\nAlternatively, maybe setting s_1 to a lower value allows s_2 to be smaller. \n\nWait, in the first example, setting s_1 to -1 (k_1=-1) allows s_2 to be 0 (k_2=0), which is better than if s_1 was 0, requiring s_2 to be at least 1 (k_2=0.5? No, but a_2 is 2, so s_2 must be a multiple of 2. So the minimal s_2 would be 2 (k_2=1), leading to a total of 1 (for k_1=0) +1 (k_2=1) + ... which would be higher. \n\nAh, so choosing s_1 as -1 allows s_2 to be 0 (which is a multiple of 2?), no. Wait, a_2 is 2. So s_2 must be a multiple of 2. So 0 is allowed (k_2=0). \n\nSo in that case, s_2 can be 0, which is greater than s_1 =-1. \n\nThus, the minimal steps are better. \n\nSo the algorithm must choose s_i as the minimal possible (in terms of |k_i|) such that s_i > s_{i-1}. \n\nThe way to do this is for each i, given s_{i-1}, find the minimal |k_i| such that a_i *k_i > s_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be the smallest integer m where a_i *m > s_{i-1}, and also the closest to zero. \n\nWait, but how to compute this m? \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nGiven a_i and s_prev (s_{i-1}), find the smallest m (in absolute terms) such that a_i * m > s_prev. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the smallest m where this holds. \n\nLet me consider cases based on the sign of a_i. \n\nCase 1: a_i >0 \n\nWe need m * a_i > s_prev. \n\nThe minimal m is ceil( (s_prev +1)/a_i ). \n\nWait, because m must be an integer. \n\nWait, for example, if s_prev is 5 and a_i is 3, then m must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6>5). \n\nSo m = ceil( (5+1)/3 ) = 2. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nBut since a_i is positive, m must be at least floor(s_prev/a_i) +1. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer m where m > s_prev/a_i. \n\nThus, m = floor(s_prev/a_i) +1. \n\nBut we need to choose the m with the smallest absolute value. \n\nWait, but if s_prev is negative, then m could be smaller. \n\nFor example, if a_i is 3 and s_prev is -5. \n\nThen m can be 0 (0*3=0 >-5). \n\nSo m=0 is better. \n\nAh, so the minimal m is the smallest integer m such that m*a_i > s_prev. \n\nSo for a_i positive, m can be as low as possible. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer m where m > s_prev/a_i. \n\nSo m = floor(s_prev/a_i) +1. \n\nBut if s_prev is negative, then m could be 0. \n\nWait, let's compute m as the minimal integer such that m*a_i > s_prev. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nSo m = floor(s_prev/a_i) +1. \n\nBut if s_prev/a_i is not an integer, then floor(s_prev/a_i) +1 is the next integer. \n\nWait, for example, s_prev=5, a_i=3: 5/3 is ~1.666, floor is 1, so m=2. \n\nAnother example: s_prev =-5, a_i=3: -5/3 is ~-1.666, floor is -2. So m =-2 +1 =-1. \n\nWait, but m=-1 gives -3, which is not greater than -5. \n\nWait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, in this case, s_prev is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nWe need m*3 >-5. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer m where m*3 >-5. \n\nPossible m can be -1 (since -3 >-5?), yes. \n\nWait, -3 is greater than -5. \n\nSo m can be -1, 0, 1, etc. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved at m=0 (0*3=0> -5). \n\nSo m=0 is better. \n\nHmm, so the formula floor(s_prev/a_i) +1 may not give the minimal m. \n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to compute m as the smallest integer such that m*a_i > s_prev, and then choose the m with the smallest absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nBut to find the minimal |m|, perhaps we can compute m as the ceiling of (s_prev +1)/a_i. \n\nWait, let's think of it as m must be the smallest integer where m > s_prev/a_i. \n\nSo m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nThus, m = floor(s_prev/a_i) +1. \n\nBut in the case where s_prev is -5 and a_i is 3, s_prev/a_i is -1.666..., so floor is -2. So m =-2 +1 =-1. \n\nBut m=-1 gives -3 which is greater than -5. \n\nBut m=0 is better (smaller |m|). \n\nAh, so the formula gives m=-1, but there is a better m (0). \n\nSo the formula is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct approach is to compute m as the minimal integer such that m*a_i > s_prev, and then choose the m with the smallest absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m can be found by considering the possible candidates around s_prev/a_i. \n\nLet me think of the possible m candidates. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nBut to minimize |m|, we can choose the m closest to zero. \n\nSo for example, in the case of s_prev =-5 and a_i=3, the minimal m is 0 (since 0*3=0> -5, and |0| is smaller than |-1|). \n\nSo the correct m is 0. \n\nThe formula floor(s_prev/a_i) +1 gives m=-1, but the correct m is 0. \n\nSo the formula is not correct. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the correct way is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i, but also check m=0 if possible. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer m where m > s_prev/a_i, and m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nSo the steps would be: \n\nCompute the minimal m such that m > s_prev/a_i. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the m closest to zero. \n\nSo for example, when s_prev/a_i is negative, then m can be 0 if 0*a_i > s_prev. \n\nWait, in the example s_prev =-5, a_i=3: 0*3=0> -5 \u2192 yes. So m=0 is valid. \n\nSo the minimal m is 0. \n\nAnother example: s_prev=4, a_i=3 \u2192 s_prev/a_i =1.333. So m must be >1.333 \u2192 m=2. \n\nAnother example: s_prev=2, a_i=3 \u2192 m can be 1 (3>2). \n\nSo m=1. \n\nHmm, so the correct approach is to compute m as the minimal integer greater than s_prev/a_i, but also check if there's a smaller m (closer to zero) that satisfies the condition. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nWait, but in the first example, s_prev/a_i is -5/3 \u2248-1.666. The minimal m greater than that is m=-1, but m=0 is also greater and has a smaller absolute value. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i, but also the closest to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute m as the ceiling of (s_prev +1)/a_i. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nFor s_prev =-5, a_i=3: \n\n(s_prev +1)/a_i = (-4)/3 \u2248-1.333. The ceiling is -1. \n\nSo m=-1. \n\nBut that's not better than 0. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer m where m*a_i > s_prev, and m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nTo find this, we can compute m0 = ceil( (s_prev +1)/a_i ), but also check m0-1, m0, m0+1 to see which gives the minimal |m|. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i, but also the closest to zero. \n\nLet me think of the general approach: \n\nWe need m such that m > s_prev / a_i. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the m closest to zero. \n\nSo the possible candidates are the floor(s_prev/a_i) +1, and maybe floor(s_prev/a_i) +0, but only if that is greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nWait, let's compute m_candidate = floor(s_prev/a_i) +1. \n\nBut also check if m_candidate-1 is possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nSo m = floor(s_prev/a_i) +1. \n\nBut in the case where s_prev/a_i is not an integer, this is correct. \n\nWait, in the case where s_prev =-5, a_i=3: \n\ns_prev/a_i =-5/3 \u2248-1.666. \n\nfloor is -2. \n\nSo m_candidate =-2 +1 =-1. \n\nBut m=0 is also valid and has a smaller absolute value. \n\nSo the formula gives m=-1, but there is a better m. \n\nHmm, so the formula is not sufficient. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nWe can compute m as the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nBut to find the minimal |m|, we can compute m as the integer closest to zero that satisfies m > s_prev/a_i. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nCompute the lower bound: m must be > s_prev/a_i. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the smallest m in absolute terms that satisfies this. \n\nSo possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\n- The integer closest to zero that is greater than s_prev/a_i. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than s_prev/a_i, but also check if there's a smaller m (closer to zero) that still satisfies the condition. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer m where m > s_prev/a_i, and m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nLet x = s_prev / a_i \n\nWe need m >x. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the smallest m in integers greater than x, closest to zero. \n\nSo possible candidates are: \n\nIf x is negative: \n\nThe minimal m is 0 if 0 >x. \n\nElse, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nWait, for example, x =-1.666, then m can be -1, 0, etc. \n\nThe minimal |m| is 0. \n\nSo in this case, m=0 is better than m=-1. \n\nSo the correct m is 0. \n\nAnother example: x=1.333 \u2192 m must be 2. \n\nAnother example: x=2 \u2192 m must be 3. \n\nAnother example: x= -0.5 \u2192 m can be 0 (since 0 >-0.5). \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nIf a_i is positive: \n\nCompute x = s_prev / a_i \n\nWe need m >x. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (closer to zero) that is still greater than x. \n\nWait, but how to compute this? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nBut in cases where x is negative, there might be a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nWait, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nBut the minimal |m| is the minimal between all possible m's greater than x. \n\nSo the minimal |m| is the minimal between all m's greater than x. \n\nThe minimal |m| is achieved by the m closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the closest to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute m as the ceiling of (s_prev +1)/a_i. \n\nWait, let's see for the example where s_prev =-5, a_i=3: \n\n(s_prev +1)/a_i = (-4)/3 \u2248-1.333. \n\nCeiling is -1. \n\nSo m=-1. \n\nBut that's not better than 0. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and 0 if possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute m as the minimal between ceil(x) and floor(x)+1, but I'm getting stuck. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal m as follows: \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x (s_prev/a_i) such that m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nSo the possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than x. \n\n- The integer 0, if 0 is greater than x. \n\n- The integer 1, if 1 is greater than x. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nCompute x = s_prev / a_i \n\nIf x is not an integer, then the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nBut if x is an integer, then m must be x+1. \n\nWait, but in the case where x is negative, like x =-1.666, the minimal m is 0 (since 0 is greater than x and has a smaller absolute value than -1). \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the best way is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if m can be 0 or 1 or -1, etc. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following approach: \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x (s_prev/a_i) such that m is as close to zero as possible. \n\nSo the possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than x. \n\n- The integer 0, if 0 >x. \n\n- The integer 1, if 1 >x. \n\n- The integer -1, if -1 >x. \n\nWe can compute all possible candidates and choose the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nBut this might be computationally feasible. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThis is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nLet me try to code this logic. \n\nFor a given s_prev and a_i: \n\nx = s_prev / a_i \n\nWe need m >x. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nBut if a_i is positive: \n\nm_candidate = math.ceil(x) \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, math.ceil(x) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. \n\nWait, if x is not an integer, then math.ceil(x) is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nIf x is an integer, then math.ceil(x) is x, but we need m >x, so m must be x+1. \n\nSo m_candidate = math.ceil(x) if x is not integer, else x+1. \n\nWait, but math.ceil(x) when x is integer is x. \n\nSo m_candidate = math.ceil(x) if x is not integer, else x+1. \n\nAlternatively, m_candidate = math.floor(x) +1. \n\nYes, because if x is an integer, then floor(x) =x, so m_candidate =x+1. \n\nIf x is not integer, floor(x) is the integer part, so floor(x)+1 is the smallest integer greater than x. \n\nSo m_candidate = floor(x) +1. \n\nBut in the case where a_i is positive and s_prev is negative, this may not give the minimal |m|. \n\nExample: s_prev =-5, a_i=3 \u2192 x =-5/3 \u2248-1.666. \n\nfloor(x) is -2 \u2192 m_candidate =-1. \n\nBut m=0 is better. \n\nAh, so the problem is that m_candidate is the smallest integer greater than x, but there are smaller m's (like 0) that are also greater than x. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal m is 0. \n\nSo the correct approach is to compute m_candidate as the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThis requires checking all possible m's between 0 and m_candidate. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nCompute m_candidate = floor(x) +1 \n\nThen, check if there exists an m between 0 and m_candidate (or negative numbers) that is still greater than x. \n\nFor example, in the case where x is -1.666, m_candidate is -1. \n\nBut m=0 is also greater than x and has a smaller absolute value. \n\nSo the minimal m is 0. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThus, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nTo find this, we can compute the minimal m as the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nCompute m_candidate = floor(x) +1 \n\nThen, check if there exists an m between 0 and m_candidate (or negative) that is still greater than x. \n\nThe minimal m is the smallest such m. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the closest to zero. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThis requires checking all possible m's between 0 and m_candidate. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThis is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than x, but also check if there's a smaller m (like 0) that is still greater than x. \n\nSo the minimal m is the smallest between m_candidate and any smaller m that is still greater than x. \n\nThus, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThis requires checking all possible m's between 0 and m_candidate. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than x, but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than x. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the code provided. \n\nThe code has a function e(b, i) which is supposed to compute something. \n\nThe code for e has a loop over the array b (which is a copy of the a array?), and for each position, it's trying to compute something. \n\nThe code for e is incomplete. \n\nThe problem requires the minimal number of moves. \n\nThe code's current structure is: \n\ndef e(b, i):\n\n    if b == []:\n\n        return 0\n\n    count =0\n\n    ggg = [0] * len(b)\n\n    for i in range(len(b)):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    return count\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal moves by greedily adjusting each element based on the previous. \n\nAlternatively, the code may be using dynamic programming. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nWe need to choose for each element b_i a value such that b_i = k_i * a_i, and b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n. \n\nThe minimal sum of |k_i|. \n\nThis is an optimization problem. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nWe can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each position i, we track the minimal cost up to i given that the current value is s_i. \n\nBut with n up to 5000 and a_i up to 1e9, this is not feasible. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe minimal moves are achieved by setting each b_i to the smallest possible value greater than b_{i-1}, while minimizing the |k_i|. \n\nThis suggests a greedy approach where we process each element in order and choose the minimal possible k_i. \n\nLet me try to formalize this: \n\nInitialize previous = -infinity \n\ntotal =0 \n\nfor i from 1 to n: \n\n    a_i = current a value \n\n    # find the minimal k_i such that a_i *k_i > previous \n\n    # and |k_i| is minimized \n\n    # compute the minimal k_i \n\n    # compute the minimal k_i \n\n    x = previous / a_i \n\n    if a_i >0: \n\n        m = math.ceil(x) \n\n    else: \n\n        m = math.floor(x) \n\n    # but need to ensure that a_i *m > previous \n\n    # also, check if there is a smaller m \n\n    # this is getting complicated \n\n    # perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer m where a_i *m > previous \n\n    # and |m| is minimal \n\n    # compute m as the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # but also check for possible smaller m \n\n    # perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # but also check if m can be 0 \n\n    # this is tricky \n\n    # for now, let's assume that m is the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # then compute the minimal |m| \n\n    # but how? \n\n    # perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # but also the closest to zero \n\n    # so compute m_candidate = ceil(previous / a_i) if a_i positive \n\n    # or floor(previous /a_i) if a_i negative \n\n    # but this may not be correct \n\n    # perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # and then choose the minimal between that and any smaller m that still satisfies \n\n    # this is getting too involved \n\n    # perhaps the code's approach is to track the required b_i as the minimal possible \n\n    # given the previous \n\n    # let's think of the first example \n\n    # a = [1,2,3,4,5] \n\n    # previous starts at -infinity \n\n    # for first element: \n\n    # a_i =1 \n\n    # previous is -inf \n\n    # so any k_1 is allowed, but to minimize |k_1|, set k_1=0 \u2192 s_1=0 \n\n    # previous becomes 0 \n\n    # second element a_i=2 \n\n    # need s_2>0 \u2192 minimal k_2 is 0 \u2192 s_2=0 \u2192 no, that's not greater than 0 \n\n    # so k_2 must be at least 1 \u2192 s_2=2 \u2192 cost 1 \n\n    # but in the example, the solution uses k_2=0 \n\n    # wait, in the example, the second element's b is 0, which is not greater than the first's -1. \n\n    # So the example's first element is set to -1 (k_1=-1), so previous is -1 \n\n    # then second element can be 0 (k_2=0 \u2192 0> -1 \u2192 yes \n\n    # so the minimal k_i is chosen to allow the previous to be as small as possible \n\n    # thus, the greedy approach must choose the minimal possible s_i (the minimal possible value greater than previous) \n\n    # which requires choosing the minimal k_i such that a_i *k_i is just above previous \n\n    # and the minimal |k_i| \n\n    # thus, the algorithm is: \n\n    # for each i in 1..n: \n\n    # compute the minimal k_i such that a_i *k_i > previous \n\n    # and |k_i| is as small as possible \n\n    # then set previous = a_i *k_i \n\n    # add |k_i| to the total \n\n    # the question is how to compute k_i \n\n    # let's proceed with this approach \n\n    # compute the minimal k_i \n\n    # the minimal k_i is the smallest integer m where a_i *m > previous \n\n    # and |m| is minimal \n\n    # so m can be computed as follows: \n\n    if a_i ==0: \n\n        # but the problem states a_i >=1 \n\n    # so a_i is positive or negative \n\n    # compute the minimal m \n\n    # case 1: a_i >0 \n\n    # we need m such that m > previous /a_i \n\n    # minimal m is ceil(previous /a_i) \n\n    # but also check if m=0 is possible \n\n    # for example, previous =-5, a_i=3 \u2192 m can be 0 \n\n    # which is better than ceil(-5/3)=ceil(-1.666)= -1 \n\n    # so the minimal m is 0 \n\n    # thus, the formula is not sufficient \n\n    # so perhaps the correct approach is to compute m as the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # but also check if there is a smaller m (closer to zero) that still satisfies the condition \n\n    # so the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # but also the closest to zero \n\n    # thus, the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # but also the minimal between that and any smaller integers that are still greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # this requires checking all possible m's between 0 and the computed m_candidate \n\n    # but this is time-consuming \n\n    # perhaps the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # but also check if m=0 is possible \n\n    # let's try to compute m as follows: \n\n    # compute the minimal m such that a_i *m > previous \n\n    # and |m| is minimal \n\n    # the minimal m is the smallest integer greater than previous/a_i \n\n    # but also check if there is a smaller m (like 0) that also satisfies the condition \n\n    # so the minimal m is the smallest between the computed m_candidate and any smaller m that still satisfies \n\n    # this can be done by checking m_candidate and m_candidate-1, etc. \n\n    # but this is getting too involved \n\n    # perhaps the code's approach is to track the required s_i as the minimal possible \n\n    # given the previous \n\n    # let's think of the code's function e(b, i) \n\n    # the
