Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i from b_i. The initial code seems to have a loop structure but the inner part is missing. Let me think about the approach here. Hmm, the problem requires that each b_i must be strictly greater than b_{i-1}. Since each b_i starts at 0, and each move can adjust it by \u00b1a_i. The key is to find the minimal steps to adjust each b_i such that the sequence is increasing. Wait, maybe a dynamic programming approach would work here. Let's think of the minimal steps required up to each position. For each position i, the value of b_i must be at least b_{i-1} + 1.",

The adjustment needed would be based on the current a_i and the previous value. Wait, the initial code in program1 has some loops but it's unclear. Let me look at the code again. The code starts with m = int(input()), but the input is n. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Wait the first line of program1 is m=int(input()), but according to the problem description, the first input is n. So that's probably a mistake. Oh right, the code might have a variable name error. Let me check the code again. Looking at program1's code:\n\nm=int(input()) a=[int(i)for i in input().split()]\nt1,min=0,10**20\nwhile(t1<m):\n    ...",

But the problem is to fill in the missing parts. Let's see the code structure. The code is trying to loop through some possibilities. The outer loop is while(t1 < m), but m is n here. The inner loops are trying to compute some t and k variables. The missing part is in the second while loop where t2 starts at t1 and goes backward.",

So the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. Wait, but that might not be the case. For example, if a_i is large, maybe choosing a negative multiple could be better. Wait, but the constraint is that b_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. Suppose b_{i-1} is 5, and a_i is 10. Then the minimal possible b_i is 10 (since 10 is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than 5). Steps would be 10/10 = 1. Alternatively, if a_i is 3 and b_{i-1} is 4, then the minimal b_i is 6 (steps 2). But if we could choose a negative multiple, but that would be less than 4, which is not allowed. So in this case, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. Therefore, the minimal steps for b_i would be (b_i)/a_i, since b_i is positive. Wait, but what if a_i is negative? No, the problem states that a_i are positive integers. So, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. So, the steps for b_i would be (b_i)/a_i. Wait, but what if the minimal b_i is negative? No, because it has to be greater than b_{i-1}. Wait, let's see. Suppose b_{i-1} is -5, and a_i is 3. Then the minimal b_i is 0 (since 0 is a multiple of 3 and greater than -5). Steps would be 0, which is better than 3 (steps 1). Ah, right! So in this case, choosing 0 is better. So the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. The minimal steps would be |b_i| / a_i. Wait, but how to compute that. Let me formalize this. Given b_{i-1}, the minimal b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i such that b_i > b_{i-1}. Let me denote this as: \n\nLet target = b_{i-1} \n\nWe need to find the smallest x such that x * a_i > target. The minimal x is ceil( (target + 1) / a_i ). Wait, because x must be an integer. Wait, for example, if target is 5 and a_i is 3, then x must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6>5). So x = ceil( (5+1)/3 ) = 2. Yes. So the minimal b_i is x * a_i, where x = ceil( (target + 1)/a_i ). The steps for this b_i is x (since it's positive). Alternatively, if the minimal b_i can be achieved with a negative x? Wait, no, because the minimal b_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. Wait, let's see another example. Suppose b_{i-1} is -5, a_i is 3. Then the minimal b_i is 0 (since 0 is a multiple of 3 and greater than -5). x would be 0, since 0*3 =0 >-5. So x can be zero. So the formula for x is the smallest integer x such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}. So x is the minimal integer where x > (b_{i-1}) / a_i. So x = floor( (b_{i-1}) / a_i ) + 1. Wait, let's see. If b_{i-1} is 5, a_i is 3: \n\n(5)/3 = 1.666..., so floor is 1, so x=2. If b_{i-1} is -5, a_i is 3: \n\n-5/3 is -1.666..., floor is -2. So x = -2 +1 = -1. Wait, but then x*a_i = -3, which is not greater than -5. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, so the formula needs to be adjusted. The correct x is the smallest integer such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}. So solving for x: \n\nx > b_{i-1}/a_i \n\nSince a_i is positive. So x must be the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1}/a_i). So x = floor( (b_{i-1} ) / a_i ) + 1. Wait, let's test with b_{i-1} =-5, a_i=3. b_{i-1}/a_i = -5/3 \u2248 -1.666. \n\nfloor(-1.666) is -2. So x = -2 +1 = -1. Then x*a_i = -3, which is greater than -5? Yes, because -3 is greater than -5. But then, the b_i would be -3, which is a valid value. But in this case, the steps would be |x| = 1 (since x is -1, so steps are |-1| =1). Alternatively, if we choose x=0, then 0*3=0 which is also greater than -5. x=0 is smaller than x=-1? Wait, the minimal x is the smallest integer such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}. So in this case, x can be 0, which is better. Hmm, so the formula is not correct. Wait, the minimal x is the smallest integer x where x*a_i > b_{i-1}. So for the case where b_{i-1} is -5 and a_i is 3, the possible x can be 0 (0*3=0> -5), so x=0 is the minimal possible. So the formula needs to find the minimal x (could be negative, zero, or positive) such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}. The minimal x is the smallest integer x where x > (b_{i-1}/a_i). Wait, but x can be any integer as long as it's greater than (b_{i-1}/a_i). The minimal x is the ceiling of (b_{i-1}/a_i). Wait, let me think again. Let me denote t = b_{i-1}/a_i. We need x > t. The minimal x is the smallest integer greater than t. So x = floor(t) +1 if t is not integer. Wait, for example, if t is 1.2, then floor(t)=1, so x=2. If t is exactly 2, then x must be 3? Wait, no. If t is exactly 2, then x must be greater than 2, so the minimal x is 3. Wait, but in that case, x=2 would give x*a_i = 2*a_i = 2a_i, which is equal to b_{i-1} (since b_{i-1}=2a_i). So that's not allowed. So yes, x must be greater than t. So the minimal x is floor(t) +1. Wait, let's see for the case where t is -1.666 (b_{i-1} =-5, a_i=3). t = -5/3 \u2248-1.666. floor(t) is -2. So x = -2 +1 = -1. But then x*a_i =-3, which is greater than -5. But there is a smaller x (like 0) which also satisfies the condition. Ah, so this formula gives x=-1, but there is a smaller x (0) which is better. Hmm, so the formula is not correct.",

So in this case, the minimal x is -1. So the minimal b_i is -3, which requires 1 step (since x is -1 \u2192 steps |-1| =1). Alternatively, choosing x=0 gives b_i=0, which requires 0 steps. Wait, but that's better. Hmm, this is a contradiction. Wait, what's the problem here? Ah! Because the formula gives x = -1, but x=0 is also valid and gives a better (smaller) steps. So the formula is not correct. Hmm, so perhaps the formula is not the way to go. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's constraints. Wait, the problem allows us to choose any multiple of a_i (positive or negative) for b_i. So in the case where b_{i-1} is -5 and a_i is 3, the minimal steps would be achieved by choosing x=0 (steps 0) which is better than x=-1 (steps 1). So why is the formula not capturing this? Because the formula is trying to find the minimal x such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}, but the steps are |x|. So the minimal steps would be achieved by the x with the smallest absolute value that satisfies the condition. Ah! So the problem is not just to find the minimal x (in terms of integer value), but the x that minimizes |x|. So the formula needs to find the x that is the closest to zero, but still satisfies x*a_i > b_{i-1}. Ah, this complicates things. So the problem is to choose x such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}, and |x| is as small as possible. So how do we find such an x? \n\nLet me think of the possible x values. We need x*a_i > b_{i-1} \u2192 x > b_{i-1}/a_i. We want to choose x with minimal |x|. So the optimal x is the one closest to zero that satisfies the inequality. Let me denote t = b_{i-1}/a_i. We need x > t. The possible candidates are the integers just above t.",

Wait, let's see: Case 1: t is negative. Suppose t = -2.5. Then, the non-negative integers greater than t are 0,1,2,... The smallest is 0. So x=0 is better. Case 2: t = -0.5. The non-negative integers greater than t are 0,1, etc. \n\nx=0 is better. Case 3: t = 1.2. The non-negative integers greater than t are 2,3,... The smallest is 2. Case 4: t = 2. Then, the minimal x is 3 (non-negative). Case 5: t = 3. Then x must be 4. Case 6: t = 0.5. The minimal x is 1. Case 7: t = -3. The non-negative integers greater than t are 0,1, etc. So x=0 is better than the ceil(t) of -2 (since -2 is greater than -3, but |x| is smaller for 0). Wait, but in this case, x=-2 is also greater than t (-3). But the minimal |x| is 0. So the algorithm would choose x=0. So the approach is: \n\nFind the smallest non-negative integer x such that x > t. If such an x exists, then that's the optimal. Otherwise, the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t (which would be negative). So how to compute this. The smallest non-negative x greater than t is ceil(t) if t is negative and ceil(t) is non-negative. Wait, let me think: \n\nThe smallest non-negative x greater than t is the smallest integer x where x >=0 and x > t. So if t <0, then x=0 is a candidate. If 0 > t \u2192 then x=0 is valid. So in that case, the minimal x is 0. Wait, but only if 0 > t. \n\nWait, if t is -1.666, then 0 is greater than t. So x=0 is valid. So the minimal non-negative x is 0.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i from b_i. The initial code seems to have a loop structure but the inner part is missing. Let me think about the approach here.\n\nHmm, the problem requires that each b_i must be strictly greater than b_{i-1}. Since each b_i starts at 0, and each move can adjust it by \u00b1a_i. The key is to find the minimal steps to adjust each b_i such that the sequence is increasing. \n\nWait, maybe a dynamic programming approach would work here. Let's think of the minimal steps required up to each position. For each position i, the value of b_i must be at least b_{i-1} + 1. The minimal steps would involve adjusting b_i to the smallest possible value that satisfies this condition, then calculating the required moves. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a greedy approach. Let's process the array from left to right. For each element, we adjust it to be just one more than the previous. The adjustment needed would be based on the current a_i and the previous value. \n\nWait, the initial code in program1 has some loops but it's unclear. Let me look at the code again. The code starts with m = int(input()), but the input is n. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Wait the first line of program1 is m=int(input()), but according to the problem description, the first input is n. So that's probably a mistake. Oh right, the code might have a variable name error. Let me check the code again.\n\nLooking at program1's code:\n\nm=int(input())\na=[int(i)for i in input().split()]\nt1,min=0,10**20\nwhile(t1<m):\n    ... \n\nWait, the first line reads m as the first input, but according to the problem, the first input is n. So that's a bug. The variable m should be n. So the first line should be n = int(input()), but in the code it's m. So that's an error. But since the user wants us to complete the code, perhaps the code has other issues. \n\nBut the problem is to fill in the missing parts. Let's see the code structure. The code is trying to loop through some possibilities. The outer loop is while(t1 < m), but m is n here. The inner loops are trying to compute some t and k variables. The missing part is in the second while loop where t2 starts at t1 and goes backward. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model some DP approach where for each possible starting point, it calculates the required steps. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires a greedy approach where we track the minimal required steps by adjusting each b_i to be as small as possible given the previous constraints. \n\nLet me think of the problem again. Let's denote the current b_i as the minimal possible value given the constraints. Starting from the first element, we can set b_1 to be anything (since there's no prior element), but to minimize steps, perhaps we can set it to 0. Wait, but the next elements must be larger. \n\nWait, the problem allows adding or subtracting a_i any number of times. So for each b_i, the possible values are b_i = initial (0) + k*a_i, where k can be any integer (positive or negative). The goal is to choose these k's such that the sequence is strictly increasing, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nHmm, this sounds like an optimization problem. Let me think of the constraints. For each i from 2 to n, b_i must be > b_{i-1}. \n\nLet me model this step by step. Let's process the array from left to right. \n\nSuppose we have already determined the value of b_{i-1}. Then, for b_i, the minimal steps would be to choose the smallest possible b_i such that it's greater than b_{i-1}, and the adjustment from 0 (since initial b_i is 0) requires the least moves. \n\nWait, the moves for b_i are the absolute value of (b_i - 0)/a_i, since each move adds or subtracts a_i. So the number of moves for b_i is |b_i| / a_i. Wait, no, because each move can add or subtract a_i once. So the total moves for b_i is |b_i| / a_i, but only if b_i is a multiple of a_i. Wait, actually, since each move can add or subtract a_i, the minimal steps to reach b_i from 0 is exactly |b_i| / a_i. Because each step contributes \u00b1a_i. So the total steps for b_i is |b_i| / a_i. \n\nWait, for example, if a_i is 3 and b_i is 6, then 6/3 = 2 steps (add twice). If b_i is -3, then 3/3 = 1 step (subtract once). So yes, the number of steps for each b_i is |b_i| / a_i. \n\nTherefore, the total steps is the sum over all i of |b_i| / a_i. \n\nThe problem is to choose b_i such that b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n, and each b_i is a multiple of a_i (since they can only be adjusted by adding or subtracting a_i each time). Wait, no, actually, the b_i can be any integer, but each step changes it by a_i. So the possible values of b_i are 0 + k*a_i, where k is any integer (positive or negative). So b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, no. Because each move adds or subtracts a_i. So the total change is k*a_i, so b_i must be equal to k*a_i. So yes, b_i must be a multiple of a_i. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nk_1*a_1 < k_2*a_2 < ... < k_n*a_n,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nWait, the total steps are sum |k_i|. Because each k_i is the number of steps (each step adds or subtracts a_i once). \n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal sum of |k_i| such that the sequence k_1*a_1, k_2*a_2, ..., k_n*a_n is strictly increasing. \n\nHmm, how to model this? \n\nLet me think of the constraints. For each i from 2 to n:\n\nk_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n\nWe need to choose k_i's such that this holds, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think of DP[i][k] as the minimal sum up to the i-th element with k_i = k. But since a_i can be up to 1e9 and n is 5000, this approach might not be feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a greedy approach can work. Let's process the elements from right to left. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let's start from the end and work backwards. \n\nSuppose we process the elements from the end to the beginning. For each position i, we can determine the minimal possible value of b_i given the constraints from the next element. \n\nLet me think: \n\nStarting from the last element, there's no constraint except that it must be greater than the previous one. \n\nWait, let's start from the first element. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal possible b_i given the previous constraints. \n\nLet me try to model this step by step. \n\nSuppose we have already determined the value of b_{i-1}. Then, for b_i, the minimal possible value is the smallest possible multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nBut since we want to minimize the total steps, perhaps we can set b_i as small as possible given the constraints. \n\nWait, but the steps depend on how far b_i is from 0. So maybe setting b_i as small as possible (but still satisfying the constraints) would minimize the sum. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nLet me denote the current minimal possible b_i as follows. \n\nWe can process the array from left to right. \n\nInitialize b_1 can be any multiple of a_1. To minimize the steps, we can set it to 0 (since that requires 0 steps). But then, the next element must be greater than 0. \n\nWait, but maybe that's not optimal. For example, if a_2 is very small, maybe we need to set b_1 to a negative value so that b_2 can be smaller. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, here's a standard approach for such problems. \n\nThe problem is similar to the problem where you have to make an array non-decreasing with minimal cost, where each element can be adjusted by some steps. \n\nWait, perhaps the optimal solution can be found by greedily adjusting each element to the minimal possible value given the previous element. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can start by setting b_1 to 0. Then, for each subsequent element i, we need to choose the minimal possible b_i such that b_i > b_{i-1}, and b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nBut this might not be optimal because sometimes adjusting earlier elements could lead to a better total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the minimal possible value of b_i given the constraints from the previous elements. \n\nLet\u2019s process from left to right. \n\nInitialize b_0 = -infinity (since there's no element before the first). \n\nFor the first element, the minimal steps would be to choose b_1 as the smallest possible multiple of a_1 such that it's greater than b_0 (which is -infinity, so any value is allowed). To minimize steps, set b_1 to 0. \n\nThen for the second element, b_2 must be > b_1. The minimal steps would be to set b_2 to the smallest multiple of a_2 that is greater than b_1. \n\nWait, but the steps for b_2 would be |b_2| / a_2. \n\nWait, but if b_1 is 0, then b_2 must be at least a_2 (since it has to be greater than 0). So the minimal steps for b_2 would be 1 (since a_2 *1 = a_2). \n\nBut maybe there's a better way by adjusting b_1 to a lower value. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the greedy approach of setting each b_i to the minimal possible given previous choices might not be optimal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution can be found by working backwards. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by some similar problems. \n\nSuppose we process the array from the end to the beginning. \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the minimal possible value of b_i given that b_{i} must be less than b_{i+1}. \n\nWait, but since we are going backward, perhaps we can track the minimal required value. \n\nLet me think step by step. \n\nStart from the last element. There's no constraint on it except that it must be greater than the previous element. \n\nWait, but when going backward, perhaps we can set each b_i to the minimal possible value that allows the next elements to be as small as possible. \n\nLet me try this approach. \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each i, the minimal possible value of b_i given that b_{i} must be less than b_{i+1}. \n\nWait, but since we are going backward, perhaps we can track the minimal required value. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nInitialize the last element's value as 0. But then the previous element must be less than 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is to set each b_i as small as possible given the constraints from the next element. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nLet\u2019s start from the end. \n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the minimal possible value of b_i given that b_i must be less than b_{i+1}. \n\nWait, but when moving backward, the constraints are that b_i < b_{i+1}. \n\nLet me think of the process as follows: \n\nWe start from the end. \n\nSet b_n to be as small as possible. But since there's no constraint after it, except that it must be greater than b_{n-1}. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, here's a standard approach for such problems. \n\nThe problem requires that the sequence is strictly increasing. Let's denote that for each i, b_i must be at least b_{i-1} + 1. \n\nBut since each b_i must be a multiple of a_i, perhaps we can model this as follows: \n\nLet\u2019s process the array from left to right. \n\nWe can track the minimal possible value of b_i given the constraints. \n\nLet\u2019s denote that after processing the first i elements, the current b_i must be at least some value. \n\nLet me try to formalize this. \n\nInitialize prev = -infinity (since there's no element before the first). \n\nFor the first element, the minimal steps would be to choose b_1 as the closest multiple of a_1 to 0, but such that it can allow the next elements to be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by greedily choosing each b_i as the smallest possible value that is greater than the previous b_{i-1}, and also a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, but how to compute that. \n\nLet me think of the first element. \n\nSuppose we set b_1 to 0. Then, for the second element, it must be at least 1. The minimal possible b_2 is the smallest multiple of a_2 that is greater than 0. That would be a_2. So steps for b_2 is 1. \n\nBut maybe if we set b_1 to -a_1, then b_2 can be 0, which is better. \n\nWait, but then b_2 must be greater than b_1. \n\nIf b_1 is -a_1, then b_2 must be greater than -a_1. The minimal possible b_2 is 0 (if a_2 divides 0). \n\nWait, but 0 is a multiple of a_2 (since 0 = 0 * a_2). So yes. \n\nIn that case, the steps for b_1 would be 1 (since subtracting a_1 once gives -a_1), and steps for b_2 is 0 (since 0 is the starting value). \n\nTotal steps would be 1, which is better than the previous approach. \n\nAh, so this shows that the greedy approach of setting each b_i to the minimal possible given previous choices may not be optimal. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that we need a dynamic programming approach. \n\nLet me think of the DP state. \n\nLet\u2019s define dp[i] as the minimal total steps required up to the i-th element, along with the value of b_i. \n\nThe state would need to track the current value of b_i, but since a_i can be up to 1e9 and n is 5000, this might not be feasible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can track the minimal possible value of b_i given the previous constraints, and compute the steps accordingly. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's process the array from left to right, and for each position i, we track the minimal possible value of b_i such that the sequence up to i is valid, and also track the minimal steps required. \n\nLet me see. \n\nInitialize for the first element: \n\nThe minimal steps for b_1 is 0 (set to 0). But then the next element must be >0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be achieved by choosing b_1 as the minimal possible (could be negative) so that the next elements can be as small as possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to choose each b_i as small as possible given the previous constraints. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nLet\u2019s denote that after processing the first i elements, the current b_i must be at least some value. \n\nLet\u2019s denote that for each i, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest possible value such that it is greater than b_{i-1}, and it is a multiple of a_i. \n\nWait, but how to compute this. \n\nLet me think step by step. \n\nSuppose we have processed up to i-1, and the current b_{i-1} is known. \n\nFor the i-th element, we need to choose b_i such that b_i > b_{i-1}, and b_i is a multiple of a_i. \n\nThe minimal steps for b_i would be the minimal |b_i| / a_i. \n\nTo minimize the total steps, we want to choose the smallest possible b_i (in absolute terms) that satisfies the constraints. \n\nSo the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nWait, but that might not be the case. For example, if a_i is large, maybe choosing a negative multiple could be better. \n\nWait, but the constraint is that b_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nSuppose b_{i-1} is 5, and a_i is 10. Then the minimal possible b_i is 10 (since 10 is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than 5). Steps would be 10/10 = 1. \n\nAlternatively, if a_i is 3 and b_{i-1} is 4, then the minimal b_i is 6 (steps 2). But if we could choose a negative multiple, but that would be less than 4, which is not allowed. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nTherefore, the minimal steps for b_i would be (b_i)/a_i, since b_i is positive. \n\nWait, but what if a_i is negative? No, the problem states that a_i are positive integers. \n\nSo, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nSo, the steps for b_i would be (b_i)/a_i. \n\nWait, but what if the minimal b_i is negative? No, because it has to be greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose b_{i-1} is -5, and a_i is 3. Then the minimal b_i is 0 (since 0 is a multiple of 3 and greater than -5). Steps would be 0, which is better than 3 (steps 1). \n\nAh, right! So in this case, choosing 0 is better. \n\nSo the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal steps would be |b_i| / a_i. \n\nWait, but how to compute that. \n\nLet me formalize this. \n\nGiven b_{i-1}, the minimal b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i such that b_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nLet me denote this as: \n\nLet target = b_{i-1} \n\nWe need to find the smallest x such that x * a_i > target. \n\nThe minimal x is ceil( (target + 1) / a_i ). \n\nWait, because x must be an integer. \n\nWait, for example, if target is 5 and a_i is 3, then x must be at least 2 (since 2*3=6>5). \n\nSo x = ceil( (5+1)/3 ) = 2. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the minimal b_i is x * a_i, where x = ceil( (target + 1)/a_i ). \n\nThe steps for this b_i is x (since it's positive). \n\nAlternatively, if the minimal b_i can be achieved with a negative x? \n\nWait, no, because the minimal b_i must be greater than b_{i-1}. \n\nWait, let's see another example. Suppose b_{i-1} is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen the minimal b_i is 0 (since 0 is a multiple of 3 and greater than -5). \n\nx would be 0, since 0*3 =0 >-5. \n\nSo x can be zero. \n\nSo the formula for x is the smallest integer x such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nSo x is the minimal integer where x > (b_{i-1}) / a_i. \n\nSo x = floor( (b_{i-1}) / a_i ) + 1. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nIf b_{i-1} is 5, a_i is 3: \n\n(5)/3 = 1.666..., so floor is 1, so x=2. \n\nIf b_{i-1} is -5, a_i is 3: \n\n-5/3 is -1.666..., floor is -2. So x = -2 +1 = -1. \n\nWait, but then x*a_i = -3, which is not greater than -5. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nWait, so the formula needs to be adjusted. \n\nThe correct x is the smallest integer such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nSo solving for x: \n\nx > b_{i-1}/a_i \n\nSince a_i is positive. \n\nSo x must be the smallest integer greater than (b_{i-1}/a_i). \n\nSo x = floor( (b_{i-1} ) / a_i ) + 1. \n\nWait, let's test with b_{i-1} =-5, a_i=3. \n\nb_{i-1}/a_i = -5/3 \u2248 -1.666. \n\nfloor(-1.666) is -2. \n\nSo x = -2 +1 = -1. \n\nThen x*a_i = -3, which is greater than -5? \n\nYes, because -3 is greater than -5. \n\nBut then, the b_i would be -3, which is a valid value. \n\nBut in this case, the steps would be |x| = 1 (since x is -1, so steps are |-1| =1). \n\nAlternatively, if we choose x=0, then 0*3=0 which is also greater than -5. \n\nx=0 is smaller than x=-1? \n\nWait, the minimal x is the smallest integer such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nSo in this case, x can be 0, which is better. \n\nHmm, so the formula is not correct. \n\nWait, the minimal x is the smallest integer x where x*a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nSo for the case where b_{i-1} is -5 and a_i is 3, the possible x can be 0 (0*3=0> -5), so x=0 is the minimal possible. \n\nSo the formula needs to find the minimal x (could be negative, zero, or positive) such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal x is the smallest integer x where x > (b_{i-1}/a_i). \n\nWait, but x can be any integer as long as it's greater than (b_{i-1}/a_i). \n\nThe minimal x is the ceiling of (b_{i-1}/a_i). \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nLet me denote t = b_{i-1}/a_i. \n\nWe need x > t. \n\nThe minimal x is the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nSo x = floor(t) +1 if t is not integer. \n\nWait, for example, if t is 1.2, then floor(t)=1, so x=2. \n\nIf t is exactly 2, then x must be 3? \n\nWait, no. If t is exactly 2, then x must be greater than 2, so the minimal x is 3. \n\nWait, but in that case, x=2 would give x*a_i = 2*a_i = 2a_i, which is equal to b_{i-1} (since b_{i-1}=2a_i). So that's not allowed. \n\nSo yes, x must be greater than t. \n\nSo the minimal x is floor(t) +1. \n\nWait, let's see for the case where t is -1.666 (b_{i-1} =-5, a_i=3). \n\nt = -5/3 \u2248-1.666. \n\nfloor(t) is -2. \n\nSo x = -2 +1 = -1. \n\nBut then x*a_i =-3, which is greater than -5. \n\nBut there is a smaller x (like 0) which also satisfies the condition. \n\nAh, so this formula gives x=-1, but there is a smaller x (0) which is better. \n\nHmm, so the formula is not correct. \n\nWait, the minimal x is the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nWait, the minimal x is the smallest integer such that x > t. \n\nSo for t =-1.666, the minimal x is -1 (since -1 is greater than -1.666). \n\nBut 0 is also greater than -1.666, but it's larger than -1. \n\nWait, the minimal x is the smallest possible integer greater than t. \n\nSo the minimal x is the ceiling of t. \n\nWait, ceiling of -1.666 is -1. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the minimal x is ceil(t). \n\nWait, ceil(-1.666) is -1. \n\nSo x = ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ). \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nYes, because ceil(t) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to t. \n\nWait, but we need x > t. \n\nSo ceil(t) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to t. \n\nIf t is not an integer, then ceil(t) is the first integer above t. \n\nIf t is an integer, then ceil(t) = t, but then x must be greater than t, so the minimal x is t+1. \n\nAh, right. \n\nSo the correct formula is: \n\nx = ceil( b_{i-1}/a_i ) \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, if t is an integer, then ceil(t) = t, but x must be greater than t. \n\nSo in that case, x must be t+1. \n\nSo the correct formula is x = floor( (b_{i-1} ) / a_i ) +1. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nIf t is an integer, then floor(t) = t, so x = t+1. \n\nIf t is not an integer, then floor(t) is the integer part, so adding 1 gives the next integer. \n\nYes, so x = floor( (b_{i-1}) / a_i ) +1. \n\nWait, let's test with the previous examples. \n\nExample 1: b_{i-1}=5, a_i=3. \n\n5/3 = 1.666, floor is 1. \n\nx = 1+1=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nExample 2: b_{i-1} =-5, a_i=3 \u2192 -5/3 =-1.666 \u2192 floor is -2 \u2192 x =-2+1 =-1. \n\nBut in this case, x can be 0, which is better. \n\nWait, but according to the formula, x is -1. \n\nBut then, the minimal x is -1, but there is a smaller x (0) which is better? \n\nWait, no. Because x is the minimal integer greater than t. \n\nWait, in this case, t is -1.666. \n\nThe minimal x is the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nThe smallest integer greater than -1.666 is -1. \n\n0 is larger than -1.666 but is not the minimal. \n\nAh, right! So the minimal x is -1. \n\nSo the minimal b_i is x*a_i = -3. \n\nWhich is greater than -5. \n\nThe steps for this would be |x| = 1. \n\nAlternatively, choosing x=0 gives b_i=0, steps 0. \n\nWait, but that's better. \n\nWait, why is that possible? \n\nBecause x=0 is also greater than t (since 0 > -1.666). \n\nAh, so the formula gives x=-1, but there are smaller x's (like 0) that are also valid. \n\nWait, no. The minimal x is the smallest possible integer greater than t. \n\nWait, the minimal x is the smallest integer that is greater than t. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal x is -1, because it's the smallest integer greater than -1.666. \n\nBut x can be any integer greater than t. \n\nSo the minimal x is indeed -1. \n\nBut then, why is x=0 also valid? \n\nYes, but it's not the minimal x. \n\nWait, the minimal x is the smallest possible integer that satisfies the condition. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal x is -1. \n\nSo the minimal b_i is -3, which requires 1 step (since x is -1 \u2192 steps |-1| =1). \n\nAlternatively, choosing x=0 gives b_i=0, which requires 0 steps. \n\nWait, but that's better. \n\nHmm, this is a contradiction. \n\nWait, what's the problem here? \n\nAh! Because the formula gives x = -1, but x=0 is also valid and gives a better (smaller) steps. \n\nSo the formula is not correct. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula is not the way to go. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's constraints. \n\nWait, the problem allows us to choose any multiple of a_i (positive or negative) for b_i. \n\nSo in the case where b_{i-1} is -5 and a_i is 3, the minimal steps would be achieved by choosing x=0 (steps 0) which is better than x=-1 (steps 1). \n\nSo why is the formula not capturing this? \n\nBecause the formula is trying to find the minimal x such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}, but the steps are |x|. \n\nSo the minimal steps would be achieved by the x with the smallest absolute value that satisfies the condition. \n\nAh! So the problem is not just to find the minimal x (in terms of integer value), but the x that minimizes |x|. \n\nSo the formula needs to find the x that is the closest to zero, but still satisfies x*a_i > b_{i-1}. \n\nAh, this complicates things. \n\nSo the problem is to choose x such that x*a_i > b_{i-1}, and |x| is as small as possible. \n\nSo how do we find such an x? \n\nLet me think of the possible x values. \n\nWe need x*a_i > b_{i-1} \u2192 x > b_{i-1}/a_i. \n\nWe want to choose x with minimal |x|. \n\nSo the optimal x is the one closest to zero that satisfies the inequality. \n\nLet me denote t = b_{i-1}/a_i. \n\nWe need x > t. \n\nThe possible candidates are the integers just above t. \n\nThe minimal |x| would be the smallest among the integers greater than t. \n\nSo the candidates are ceil(t) and floor(t)+1 (if t is not integer). \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose t is 1.2 \u2192 ceil(t)=2. \n\nThe minimal x is 2 (steps 2). \n\nAlternatively, if t is -1.666, then ceil(t) is -1. \n\nx=-1 gives steps 1. \n\nx=0 gives steps 0. \n\nWait, but x=0 is greater than t (-1.666). \n\nSo x=0 is also a candidate. \n\nSo the minimal |x| is 0. \n\nAh, so in this case, the optimal x is 0. \n\nSo the formula needs to find the minimal x in the set of integers greater than t, with minimal |x|. \n\nHmm, so how to compute that. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nCompute the minimal x such that x > t, and |x| is minimized. \n\nThe possible candidates are the integers just above t. \n\nThe minimal |x| would be the smallest between the ceiling of t and the floor of t plus 1? \n\nWait, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the integer closest to zero that is greater than t. \n\nSo to find this, we can consider the floor of t and the ceiling of t. \n\nWait, let me think of t as a real number. \n\nThe minimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the closest to zero. \n\nSo for example, if t is negative, like -1.666, then the minimal x is -1 (since it's the first integer greater than t, and closer to zero than 0?), but in this case, 0 is also greater than t and has a smaller |x|. \n\nAh, so in this case, the minimal |x| is achieved by x=0. \n\nHmm, so the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t with the smallest absolute value. \n\nSo the algorithm would be: \n\nFind all integers x where x > t. \n\nAmong them, choose the one with the smallest |x|. \n\nSo how to compute this. \n\nLet me think of t as a real number. \n\nThe minimal |x| is achieved by the x closest to zero. \n\nSo the possible candidates are the integers just above t, and possibly zero or positive numbers. \n\nLet me see: \n\nThe minimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the closest to zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the integer closest to zero that is greater than t. \n\nSo the steps to compute this are: \n\nCompute the minimal x such that x > t, and |x| is as small as possible. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nCompute the candidate x values as follows: \n\nThe candidate x can be either ceil(t) or floor(t) +1 (if t is not integer). \n\nWait, but that might not be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nLet me think of t = -1.666. \n\nThe integers greater than t are -1, 0, 1, etc. \n\nThe minimal |x| is 0 (x=0). \n\nSo the optimal x is 0. \n\nAnother example: t = 1.2 \u2192 x must be 2. \n\nAnother example: t = 2 \u2192 x must be 3. \n\nAnother example: t = -0.5 \u2192 x can be 0 (since 0 > -0.5). \n\nSo the minimal |x| is 0. \n\nAnother example: t = 0.5 \u2192 x must be 1. \n\nHmm, so the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nWait, the minimal x in terms of absolute value is the smallest possible. \n\nSo the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nSo the steps to compute this are: \n\nFind the minimal x such that x > t, and |x| is minimized. \n\nThe possible candidates are the integers just above t. \n\nThe minimal x is the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nCompute the minimal x as follows: \n\nIf there exists an integer x such that x > t and x is between -1 and 1 (i.e., x=0 or 1), then choose the smallest possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the closest to zero. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nCompute the minimal x as the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nBut then, if that x is positive, but there is a smaller x (like zero) that also satisfies the condition, then that is better. \n\nWait, but the minimal x (in terms of integer value) is the smallest possible integer greater than t. \n\nBut the minimal |x| may be achieved by a larger x (in terms of integer value) but closer to zero. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the one closest to zero among all integers greater than t. \n\nSo to find this, we can compute the candidate x as the floor(t) +1, but also check if there is a smaller x (closer to zero) that is still greater than t. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the minimal between ceil(t) and the first integer greater than t that is closer to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to compute the candidate x as the smallest integer greater than t, and also check if there is a smaller x (in absolute terms) that is also greater than t. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one with the minimal absolute value. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nCompute the minimal x as follows: \n\nLet x_candidate = ceil(t). \n\nBut also check if there is an x between 0 and x_candidate that is greater than t. \n\nWait, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the minimal between ceil(t) and the first integer greater than t that is closest to zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to compute the minimal x as the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the one closest to zero among all integers greater than t. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nFind all integers x where x > t. \n\nAmong them, choose the one with the smallest |x|. \n\nIf there are multiple, pick the smallest one. \n\nTo compute this, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nCompute the minimal x as follows: \n\nLet x_min = the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nThen, check if there exists an integer between -infinity and x_min that is greater than t and has a smaller absolute value. \n\nWait, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the one with the smallest absolute value among all integers greater than t. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nFind the minimal x such that x > t, and |x| is as small as possible. \n\nTo compute this, we can consider the following candidates: \n\nThe integer just above t (ceil(t)), and also any integers between 0 and that value. \n\nWait, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t, but also the one closest to zero. \n\nLet me think of t = -1.666. \n\nThe integers greater than t are -1, 0, 1, etc. \n\nThe minimal |x| is 0 (x=0). \n\nSo the optimal x is 0. \n\nBut ceil(t) is -1. \n\nSo the minimal |x| is achieved by x=0. \n\nHmm, so the algorithm must consider all possible candidates. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal x is the smallest non-negative integer greater than t. \n\nWait, but in the case where t is negative, like -1.666, the smallest non-negative integer greater than t is 0. \n\nWhich is better than the ceil(t) of -1. \n\nSo perhaps the optimal x is the smallest non-negative integer greater than t. \n\nIf that exists, then that's better. \n\nOtherwise, we have to take the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nCheck if there exists a non-negative integer x such that x > t. \n\nIf yes, then the minimal x is the smallest such x (starting from 0 upwards). \n\nOtherwise, the minimal x is the smallest integer greater than t (which would be negative). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nCase 1: t is negative. \n\nSuppose t = -2.5. \n\nThen, the non-negative integers greater than t are 0,1,2,... \n\nThe smallest is 0. \n\nSo x=0 is better. \n\nCase 2: t = -0.5. \n\nThe non-negative integers greater than t are 0,1, etc. \n\nx=0 is better. \n\nCase 3: t = 1.2. \n\nThe non-negative integers greater than t are 2,3,... \n\nThe smallest is 2. \n\nCase 4: t = 2. \n\nThen, the minimal x is 3 (non-negative). \n\nCase 5: t = 3. \n\nThen x must be 4. \n\nCase 6: t = 0.5. \n\nThe minimal x is 1. \n\nCase 7: t = -3. \n\nThe non-negative integers greater than t are 0,1, etc. \n\nSo x=0 is better than the ceil(t) of -2 (since -2 is greater than -3, but |x| is smaller for 0). \n\nWait, but in this case, x=-2 is also greater than t (-3). \n\nBut the minimal |x| is 0. \n\nSo the algorithm would choose x=0. \n\nSo the approach is: \n\nFind the smallest non-negative integer x such that x > t. \n\nIf such an x exists, then that's the optimal. \n\nOtherwise, the optimal x is the smallest integer greater than t (which would be negative). \n\nSo how to compute this. \n\nThe smallest non-negative x greater than t is ceil(t) if t is negative and ceil(t) is non-negative. \n\nWait, let me think: \n\nThe smallest non-negative x greater than t is the smallest integer x where x >=0 and x > t. \n\nSo if t <0, then x=0 is a candidate. \n\nIf 0 > t \u2192 then x=0 is valid. \n\nSo in that case, the minimal x is 0. \n\nWait, but only if 0 > t. \n\nWait, if t is -1.666, then 0 is greater than t. \n\nSo x=0 is valid. \n\nSo the minimal non-negative x is 0. \n\nIf t is 0.5, then the minimal non-negative x is 1. \n\nIf t is 2, then the minimal non-negative x is 3. \n\nSo the minimal non-negative x is ceil(t) if t is not an integer. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, for t=0.5, ceil(t) is 1. \n\nFor t=2, ceil(t) is 2, but we need x>2 \u2192 so x=3. \n\nAh, so when t is an integer, the minimal non-negative x is t+1. \n\nSo the minimal non-negative x is ceil(t) if t is not integer, else t+1. \n\nWait, ceil(t) when t is an integer is t. \n\nSo the minimal non-negative x is ceil(t) if t is not integer, else t+1. \n\nSo the minimal non-negative x is ceil(t) if t is not integer, else t+1. \n\nSo the minimal non-negative x is ceil(t) if t is not integer, else t+1. \n\nSo the minimal non-negative x is ceil(t) if t is not integer, else t+1. \n\nSo the minimal non-negative x is
