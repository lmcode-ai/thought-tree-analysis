The given code has a part for n=1 missing. Let's think about that case. For n=1, the original string is \"BAN\" itself. To prevent \"BAN\" from being a subsequence, we need to break it. The minimal swap here is 1. For example, swapping the first two characters gives \"ABN\", which doesn't have \"BAN\" as a subsequence. So the code for n=1 should output 1 swap between positions 1 and 2. The existing code for other n's seems to swap every third character from the start and end. Maybe that's part of a strategy to break all possible \"BAN\" sequences. But I need to make sure that the code for n=1 is filled correctly. Next, program2.py. The problem is to find the minimum operations to turn all elements to zero. The code provided is incomplete in the while loop. The approach seems to be counting pairs. Let me think: the code is popping elements and checking if there's another occurrence. Maybe when a duplicate is found, some operation count is adjusted.",

Maybe I should think of the problem differently. The problem requires that all elements become zero with minimal steps. Each operation can be of two types:\n\n1. If the two elements are equal: choose one to set to zero. This reduces the count of that number by one. 2. If they are different: both become the minimum of the two. The goal is to find the minimal steps. The minimal steps would be the sum over all elements of (count_i -1), where count_i is the count of each number. Because for each number, you need (count_i -1) operations to reduce all to zero. Wait, let's see: For example, in the first case [1,1,3], the counts are 2 for 1, 1 for 3. Sum (2-1)+(1-1) =1 \u2192 but the correct answer is 4. So that's not. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros. In the first example, 3-0=3, but the answer is 4. Hmm.",

Because if a1 and a2 are equal (both 1), then the operation would set one to zero. Ah, perhaps the example's first operation is between a1 and a3 (1 and 3). Since they are different, they become min(1,3)=1. So a1 and a3 become 1 and 1. So the array becomes [1,1,1]. Wait that would make sense. Wait the example's first step explanation says \"a1 < a2\", so perhaps they chose a1 and a3 (since a1 is 1 and a3 is 3). Then after the operation, both become 1. So the array becomes [1,1,1]. Then step 2: pair a1 and a2 (both 1), set one to 0 \u2192 [0,1,1]. Step3: pair a2 and a3 \u2192 set one to 0 \u2192 [0,0,1].",

In the first example, this gives 3 +1 -0 =4 \u2192 correct. In the [2,2] case, after processing, a is empty, and c was 0 \u2192 so 2+1-0=3 \u2192 which is wrong. Ah, so the problem is that in the [2,2] case, the code's formula overcounts by 1. The code's logic is that when there are no zeros initially (c==0), and all elements are processed (a is empty), then add 1. But in the [2,2] case, the correct answer is 2, but the code gives 3. So why is this happening? The code's formula is adding 1 when there were no initial zeros and all elements are processed. But in the [2,2] case, the correct answer is 2, but the formula gives 2+1-0=3. So the code's formula is wrong. Therefore, the missing code in the while loop must be adjusting something. The code's loop is processing elements and popping them. The code's logic is that when a duplicate is found (a.count(q) >0), then something should be done. Perhaps the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. Wait, in the [2,2] case, the loop processes the first element (2). a is [2]. a.count(q) is 1>0 \u2192 enters the if clause. The missing code here might be to do something like decrement a count. Alternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are not duplicates. Alternatively, the code is trying to track the number of elements that are left after pairing duplicates. Alternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. Wait, in the [2,2] case, after processing both elements, the a list is empty.",

Looking at the code for program3: \n\nThe code has a loop for i in range((n+1)//2): \n\nbase = fact[n-1] \n\nfrac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)) \n\nout[i] = modmul(base, frac) Then, the rem variable is used in a loop. But I'm not sure if this is correct. However, the problem says to complete the missing inv function. So the only missing part is the inv function. Thus, the answers are: \n\nprogram1's missing code is for the n==1 case. program2's missing code is nothing (pass). program3's missing code is the inv function returning pow(x, MOD-2, MOD). But I'm not sure about program2. Alternatively, perhaps the missing code in program2 is to do a.pop() again when a duplicate is found. But I'm not sure.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the minimal number of swaps needed so that the string formed by repeating \"BAN\" n times doesn't have \"BAN\" as a subsequence. The given code has a part for n=1 missing. Let's think about that case. For n=1, the original string is \"BAN\" itself. To prevent \"BAN\" from being a subsequence, we need to break it. The minimal swap here is 1. For example, swapping the first two characters gives \"ABN\", which doesn't have \"BAN\" as a subsequence. So the code for n=1 should output 1 swap between positions 1 and 2. The existing code for other n's seems to swap every third character from the start and end. Maybe that's part of a strategy to break all possible \"BAN\" sequences. But I need to make sure that the code for n=1 is filled correctly.\n\nNext, program2.py. The problem is to find the minimum operations to turn all elements to zero. The code provided is incomplete in the while loop. The approach seems to be counting pairs. Let me think: the code is popping elements and checking if there's another occurrence. Maybe when a duplicate is found, some operation count is adjusted. The note in the code shows that the output formula is b + ... so perhaps the code is trying to track the number of required steps based on duplicates. The missing part might involve decrementing the count when a pair is found. Alternatively, maybe when a duplicate exists, we can reduce the number of required steps. Wait, the current code's loop is: while a: q = a.pop(), then if a.count(q) >0, then... but the code is incomplete here. The idea might be that when there's a duplicate, we can perform an operation to turn one into zero, but the exact steps are unclear. The example given in the note shows that when there are duplicates, you can pair them. Maybe the code needs to track the number of unique elements and the steps required. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are calculated based on the number of elements and their duplicates. Hmm, perhaps the missing code is supposed to handle when a pair is found, so that the count is adjusted. Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to count the number of elements that are not zero and then compute the steps based on that. The existing code's print line is a bit cryptic. Let me think again. The output is supposed to be the minimal steps. The code's current print line is \"print(b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c)\". Maybe 'b' is the original length, and 'c' is the count of zeros. But I'm not sure. The correct approach for the problem might involve considering that each pair of equal elements can be turned into a zero in one operation if they are the same, but otherwise, merging them into the minimum. The minimal steps would depend on the number of distinct elements and their frequencies. Alternatively, the minimal steps can be calculated as the total number of elements minus the number of zeros, but adjusted for pairs. Maybe the code is trying to track the number of elements that need to be processed. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum over all elements of (count-1) for each distinct value, but I'm not sure. The example given in the note has 3 elements, and the steps were 4. Let me see: the example input was [1,1,3]. The steps were 4. The formula in the code's print line for that case would be b (3) + (a is empty? yes) * (c==0? c was 0 initially, so 1) - c (0). So 3 +1 -0 =4, which matches. So the formula works here. So the code's logic is that the minimal steps are (original length) plus 1 if there were no zeros initially and all elements are processed, minus the count of zeros. The while loop is trying to process elements and track something. The missing code in the while loop might be to remove the duplicate when found, but perhaps the code is trying to count the number of duplicates. Alternatively, the code is trying to process pairs. Maybe when a duplicate is found, we can do something like remove one of them from the list, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are not zero and have duplicates. Hmm, perhaps the code is trying to process the elements and when a pair is found, it reduces the count. But the code is incomplete. The line after 'if a.count(q) >0' is missing. Maybe the code should remove the duplicate, but since a is being popped, perhaps it's better to track the counts. Alternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that can form pairs. Maybe the code is supposed to, when a duplicate is found, do something like subtract 1 from the total steps? Not sure. Alternatively, the code is correct except for the missing part, which might be a pass or a break. Wait, the code is in a while loop that pops elements. The code's logic might be to process each element and check if there's another occurrence. If so, then we can pair them, so the count is adjusted. But without the code, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. Maybe the missing code is to remove the duplicate. But since the list is being popped, perhaps the code is trying to process pairs. Alternatively, the code is correct except for the missing part, which might be a pass. Maybe the code is just counting the number of duplicates, but the existing code's print statement already works. Wait, the code for program2 is supposed to be completed. The code given is:\n\nfor n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n    *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0)\n    while a:\n        q=a.pop()\n        if a.count(q)>0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    print(b+(a==[])*(c==0)-c)\n\nThe loop is popping elements. The condition is if there's another occurrence of q in the remaining a. So when a has another q, then we can do something. But the code is missing here. Perhaps when a duplicate is found, we can remove one of them (since they can be paired), so the code should do a.pop() again? Or maybe the code is supposed to do nothing here, and the rest of the code works. But in the example given, the code's print statement gives the correct answer. Let me see the example input: first test case input is [1,1,3]. The code's variables: b is 3, c is 0. The while loop processes each element. Let's see:\n\nFirst iteration: q is 3 (since a was [1,1,3], then after pop, q is 3, and a is [1,1]. Then a.count(3) is 0, so the if clause is false. So nothing happens. Next iteration: q is 1 (a is [1], so after pop, q is 1, a is empty. a.count(1) is 0. So loop ends. The print is 3 + (a is empty (yes) and c was 0 \u2192 so +1) minus c (0). So 3+1-0=4, which matches. So the code works for this case even without the missing code. Wait, but what if there are duplicates? Let's take another example. Suppose the input is [2,2]. Then c is 0. The loop: first pop 2, a is [2]. a.count(2) is 1>0. So enter the if clause. But what code is missing here? The code is incomplete here. But the code's print statement would be b (2) + (a is empty after processing? Let's see: after first iteration, q is 2, a is [2]. Then the if clause is true. But the code does nothing here. Then the next iteration: pop the remaining 2, a becomes empty. So after the loop, a is empty. So the print is 2 + (True)*(0==0 \u2192 yes, since c was 0) \u2192 2+1 -0 \u2192 3. But what is the correct answer here? Let's see: the minimal steps for [2,2]. The first operation can be to swap them (since they are equal). Then one becomes 0, the other remains 2. Then next step, you have to pair the 2 with another number (but there's only one left). Wait, but the problem requires all to be zero. Wait, the operation when two equal numbers are selected: you change one to 0. So for [2,2], first operation: pick both, turn one to 0. Now the array is [0,2]. Then next operation: pick 0 and 2. Since they are different, change both to min(0,2)=0. So that's two operations. So the correct answer is 2. But according to the code's formula, it would give 2 +1 (since a is empty and c was 0) -0 \u2192 3, which is wrong. So the code is incorrect. Therefore, the missing code must be doing something here. \n\nAh, so the code's current approach is wrong. The missing code must handle the case when a duplicate is found. The problem is that the code's current logic doesn't account for the fact that when duplicates are present, they can be paired to reduce the steps. The code's formula is not correct. Therefore, the missing code must be adjusting some variable here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to count the number of elements that are not zero and have duplicates. Maybe the missing code is to remove the duplicate. For example, when a.count(q) >0, then we can pair them, so we can remove one of them from the list. But since we popped q, perhaps we need to pop another occurrence. But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the code is supposed to track the number of elements that can form pairs. Maybe the code should, when a duplicate is found, decrease the count of required steps. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach for the problem is that the minimal number of operations is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of zeros, plus 1 if there were no zeros initially. Wait, in the first example, 3 elements, 0 zeros \u2192 3-0 +1? 4, which matches. The second example with [2,2], the answer is 2. The formula would be 2 (elements) -0 (zeros) +1 (since no zeros) \u2192 3, which is wrong. So that's not it. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum over all elements of (count of each number -1). For example, in the first example, counts are 2 for 1, 1 for 3. So (2-1)+(1-1) =1 \u2192 but the answer was 4. So that's not. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of distinct elements. For the first example, 3 elements, 2 distinct \u2192 1, but the answer is 4. Not matching. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the number of elements minus 1. For the first example, 3-1=2, but the answer is 4. Not. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each pair of equal elements can be turned into a zero in one operation, but when they are not equal, you have to merge them into the minimum. The process continues until all are zero. The minimal steps would be the sum of (each element's value) divided by something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be calculated as follows: \n\nEach time you perform an operation on two elements a and b:\n\n- If a == b: you can turn one into 0. This takes 1 operation and reduces the count of non-zero elements by 1 (since one becomes 0, the other remains a). \n\n- Else: you turn both into min(a, b). This takes 1 operation and may reduce the maximum elements but not necessarily the count. \n\nThe goal is to minimize the number of operations. \n\nThe optimal strategy might be to pair elements with the same value first, then handle others. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps can be determined by the number of elements minus the number of zeros, plus some adjustment. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros, plus the number of elements that are not zero and have duplicates. \n\nAlternatively, the problem's solution is that the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros, plus 1 if there were no zeros initially. \n\nWait, in the first example, 3 elements, 0 zeros \u2192 3-0 +1 =4 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the second example [2,2], the answer is 2. The formula would give 2-0 +1 =3 \u2192 wrong. \n\nHmm, so that's not. \n\nWait the correct answer for [2,2] is 2 steps:\n\nFirst operation: pair the two 2's. You can choose to turn one into 0. Now the array is [0,2]. \n\nSecond operation: pair 0 and 2. Since they are different, you turn both into 0. So two steps. \n\nThe formula would need to give 2. \n\nThe code's current formula gives 2 (b) + (a is empty \u2192 yes) * (c was 0 \u2192 yes) \u2192 so 2 +1 -0 \u2192 3. Which is wrong. \n\nSo the code's formula is incorrect. Therefore, the missing code in the while loop must be adjusting some variable. \n\nLooking back at the code's variables: \n\nThe code has variables b (original length), c (count of zeros initially). \n\nThe loop is processing elements and popping them. The code's logic might be trying to count the number of elements that are not zero and have duplicates. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nWait, in the while loop, for each element q, if there is another occurrence in the remaining a, then perhaps we can pair them, so we don't need to count them as separate. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nWait, the code's loop is popping elements and checking if there's another occurrence. If there is, then perhaps that element can be paired, so it doesn't contribute to the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that cannot be paired. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of elements that are unique. \n\nLet me think of the example [2,2]. \n\nThe loop processes the first popped element (2). At that point, a is [2]. a.count(2) is 1, which is >0. So the if clause is true. The missing code here might be to do something like decrement a count. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are not duplicates. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the number of elements that are left after pairing duplicates. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nWait, in the first example, after processing all elements, the a list is empty. The code's formula is b + (a is empty and c was 0) - c. \n\nThe problem is that in the [2,2] case, the code's formula gives 3, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nSo the code's formula is wrong. Therefore, the missing code must be adjusting some variable. \n\nPerhaps the code is supposed to track the number of elements that are not zero and have no duplicates. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nWait, in the [2,2] case, after processing, the a list is empty. So the formula adds 1 because a is empty and c was 0. \n\nBut the correct answer is 2, which is (2 elements) - 0 (zeros) \u2192 2, but the formula gives 3. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is wrong and the missing code is supposed to adjust the 'c' variable. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to realize that the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros, plus 1 if there were no zeros. But that doesn't work for the [2,2] case. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the number of elements minus the number of zeros, plus the number of elements that are not zero and have an odd count. \n\nWait, in the first example, counts are 2 (for 1), 1 (for 3). The non-zero elements with odd counts are 3 (count 1). So 3-0 (zeros) +1 \u2192 4. \n\nIn the [2,2] case, counts are 2 (even). So 2-0 +0 \u2192 2. That works. \n\nSo the formula would be (total elements - zeros) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts). \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor the first example, non-zero elements are 1 (count 2 even?), 3 (count 1 odd). So the number of non-zero elements with odd counts is 1. So (3-0) +1 =4. \n\nFor [2,2], non-zero counts are 2 (even). So (2-0) +0 \u2192 2. \n\nAnother example: [1,1,3]. The non-zero counts are 2 (even) and 1 (odd). So 3-0 +1 \u21924. \n\nAnother test case: [0,0]. Then zeros are 2. So (2-2) +0 \u21920. Which is correct, since they are already zeros. \n\nAnother test case: [1,1,1]. The counts for 1 is 3 (odd). So (3-0) +1 \u21924. Let's see what steps would be needed. \n\nFirst, pair two 1's \u2192 turn one to 0. Now [0,1,1]. \n\nThen pair the two 1's \u2192 turn one to 0 \u2192 [0,0,1]. \n\nThen pair 0 and 1 \u2192 turn both to 0. So total steps: 3. But according to the formula, it would be 3+1 (since initial zeros were 0) \u2192 4. Hmm discrepancy. \n\nWait, the steps for [1,1,1]:\n\nStep 1: pair first two 1's \u2192 one becomes 0. Now [0,1,1]. \n\nStep 2: pair the two 1's \u2192 one becomes 0 \u2192 [0,0,1]. \n\nStep 3: pair 0 and 1 \u2192 both become 0. So total 3 steps. \n\nThe formula would give (3-0) +1 (since count of 1 is 3, odd) \u2192 4. Which is wrong. \n\nHmm, so that formula is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is (total elements - zeros) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts -1). \n\nIn the [1,1,1] case, that would be 3 + (1-1) =3 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the first example, 3 + (1-1) \u21923? No, that's not. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the problem differently. \n\nThe problem requires that all elements become zero with minimal steps. \n\nEach operation can be of two types:\n\n1. If the two elements are equal: choose one to set to zero. This reduces the count of that number by one. \n\n2. If they are different: both become the minimum of the two. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal steps. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the sum over all elements of (count_i -1), where count_i is the count of each number. Because for each number, you need (count_i -1) operations to reduce all to zero. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor example, in the first case [1,1,3], the counts are 2 for 1, 1 for 3. \n\nSum (2-1)+(1-1) =1 \u2192 but the correct answer is 4. So that's not. \n\nHmm, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros. \n\nIn the first example, 3-0=3, but the answer is 4. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of distinct non-zero elements. \n\nIn the first example, 3-0 +1 (since 1 and 3 are two distinct non-zero elements?) \u2192 3+2=5? No. \n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that each time you have two elements of the same value, you can eliminate one of them in one step. For different values, you can merge them into the smaller one, which may allow further pairings. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the total number of elements minus the number of zeros. \n\nWait, in the first example, 3 elements, 0 zeros \u2192 3 steps. But the correct answer is 4. \n\nHmm, no. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of elements that are not zero and have an even count. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros. \n\nWait, in the [2,2] case, that would be 2 steps, which matches. \n\nIn the first example, 3 steps, but the correct answer is 4. \n\nHmm, discrepancy. \n\nWait the first example's correct answer is 4 steps. Let me recheck:\n\nThe example's steps were:\n\n1. Pair a1 and a2 (1 and 1) \u2192 they become 1 and 1 (since they are equal, one becomes 0. So after first step, the array is [1,0,3]. \n\nWait no, the first step in the example's explanation was choosing a1 and a2 (1 and 1). Since they are equal, you can change one to 0. So the array becomes [1,0,3]. \n\nThen step 2: pair a1 and a2 (1 and 0). They are different, so both become 0. Now array is [0,0,3]. \n\nStep 3: pair a3 (3) with another (but there are only two zeros). So pair a3 with a1 (0). They become 0 and 0. So that's step 3? Wait the example's explanation says 4 steps. \n\nWait the example's explanation says:\n\nStep 1: a becomes [1,1,3] \u2192 after operation, a2 becomes 1, so array is [1,1,3]? Or wait the first operation in the example's explanation was changing a2 to 1 (so they were already equal?), then the operation makes one of them 0. \n\nWait the first step in the example's explanation:\n\n\"In the 1-st operation, a1 < a2, after the operation, a2 = a1 =1. Now the sequence a is [1,1,3].\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. Because if a1 and a2 were both 1, then they are equal, so the operation would turn one into 0. But the example says that after the first operation, they are still 1 and 1. \n\nAh, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's operation. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe operation is: select two distinct indices i and j. \n\nIf a_i = a_j, then change one of them to 0. \n\nElse, change both to min(a_i, a_j). \n\nAh! So when the two are equal, you can choose to set one to zero. \n\nIn the first step of the example, the initial a is [1, 1, 3]. \n\nThey choose a1 and a2 (both 1). Since they are equal, they can set one to zero. The example says after the operation, the array becomes [1,1,3]. Wait that can't be. \n\nWait the example's explanation says: \n\n\"In the 1-st operation, a1 < a2, after the operation, a2 = a1 =1. Now the sequence a is [1,1,3].\"\n\nWait that's conflicting. Because if a1 and a2 are equal (both 1), then the operation would set one to zero. \n\nAh, perhaps the example's first operation is between a1 and a3 (1 and 3). Since they are different, they become min(1,3)=1. So a1 and a3 become 1 and 1. So the array becomes [1,1,1]. \n\nWait that would make sense. \n\nWait the example's first step explanation says \"a1 < a2\", so perhaps they chose a1 and a3 (since a1 is 1 and a3 is 3). \n\nThen after the operation, both become 1. So the array becomes [1,1,1]. \n\nThen step 2: pair a1 and a2 (both 1), set one to 0 \u2192 [0,1,1]. \n\nStep3: pair a2 and a3 \u2192 set one to 0 \u2192 [0,0,1]. \n\nStep4: pair a3 with a1 (0 and 1 \u2192 min is 0 \u2192 both become 0. \n\nTotal 4 steps. \n\nSo the first step was an operation between different elements, turning them into the same. \n\nSo the minimal steps depend on merging elements into smaller values to allow pairing. \n\nThis suggests that the minimal steps are not straightforward to compute. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of elements that are not zero and have an odd count. \n\nWait in the first example, the counts are 3 (after first step, but initial counts are 2 for 1 and 1 for 3). \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of distinct non-zero elements minus 1. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros. \n\nIn the first example, 3-0=3, but the answer is 4. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of elements that are not zero and have an odd count. \n\nWait in the first example, the non-zero elements are 1 (count 2 even) and 3 (count 1 odd). So 3-0 +1 =4 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the [2,2] case, non-zero counts are even \u2192 2-0 +0 \u21922 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the [1,1,1] case, count is 3 (odd). So 3-0 +1 \u21924, but the correct answer is 3. \n\nHmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait for [1,1,1], the steps would be:\n\nStep1: pair first two \u2192 one becomes 0 \u2192 [0,1,1]. \n\nStep2: pair the two 1's \u2192 one becomes 0 \u2192 [0,0,1]. \n\nStep3: pair the 1 with a 0 \u2192 both become 0. \n\nTotal 3 steps. \n\nThe formula gives 3+1=4. So it's wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is (total elements - zeros) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts -1). \n\nIn the [1,1,1] case, that would be 3 + (1-1) =3 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the first example, 3 + (1-1) \u21923 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is (total elements - zeros) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts) // 1. \n\nWait not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the correct formula is the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of non-zero elements with odd counts minus 1. \n\nIn the first example, 3+1-1=3 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for another approach. \n\nThe problem's note says that the answer can be computed as the sum over all elements of (count_i -1), where count_i is the count of each non-zero element. \n\nWait for the first example, counts are 2 and 1 \u2192 (2-1)+(1-1)=1 \u2192 but the answer is 4. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the sum over all elements of (count_i) divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nFor the first example, (2+1)/2 \u2192 1.5 \u2192 2 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros. \n\nIn the first example, 3 steps, but the correct answer is 4. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that each time you have two elements of the same value, you can eliminate one in one step. For different values, you can merge them into the smaller one, which may allow further pairings. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the total number of elements minus the number of zeros. \n\nWait in the first example, the steps needed are 4, but that formula gives 3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps are the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of elements that are not zero and have an odd count. \n\nWait in the first example, that gives 3+1=4 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the [1,1,1] case, it would be 3+1=4, but the correct answer is 3. \n\nHmm, so that formula is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is (total elements - zeros) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts -1). \n\nIn the first example, 3+ (1-1)=3 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the correct formula is the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of non-zero elements with odd counts minus 1 if there is at least one. \n\nWait in the first example, 3+1-1=3 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I should look back at the code's current approach. \n\nThe code's print statement is: \n\nprint(b + (a == []) * (c == 0) - c)\n\nWhere b is the original length, c is the initial count of zeros. \n\nThe term (a == [])*(c ==0) is 1 if after processing all elements, a is empty and there were no initial zeros. \n\nThe -c subtracts the initial zeros. \n\nIn the first example, this gives 3 +1 -0 =4 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the [2,2] case, after processing, a is empty, and c was 0 \u2192 so 2+1-0=3 \u2192 which is wrong. \n\nAh, so the problem is that in the [2,2] case, the code's formula overcounts by 1. \n\nThe code's logic is that when there are no zeros initially (c==0), and all elements are processed (a is empty), then add 1. \n\nBut in the [2,2] case, the correct answer is 2, but the code gives 3. \n\nSo why is this happening? \n\nThe code's formula is adding 1 when there were no initial zeros and all elements are processed. \n\nBut in the [2,2] case, the correct answer is 2, but the formula gives 2+1-0=3. \n\nSo the code's formula is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the while loop must be adjusting something. \n\nThe code's loop is processing elements and popping them. The code's logic is that when a duplicate is found (a.count(q) >0), then something should be done. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nWait, in the [2,2] case, the loop processes the first element (2). a is [2]. a.count(q) is 1>0 \u2192 enters the if clause. \n\nThe missing code here might be to do something like decrement a count. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are not duplicates. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the number of elements that are left after pairing duplicates. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nWait, in the [2,2] case, after processing both elements, the a list is empty. \n\nThe code's formula adds 1 because there were no initial zeros and a is empty. \n\nBut the correct answer is 2, so the formula is adding an extra 1. \n\nPerhaps the code should not add 1 in this case. \n\nThe condition (a == [] and c ==0) is true, but in this case, the correct answer is 2, but the formula gives 3. \n\nSo the code's formula is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the missing code must be adjusting the variables in the loop to prevent this. \n\nPerhaps the code should not add 1 in cases where the number of elements is even. \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is incorrect and the missing code is supposed to track the number of elements that are not duplicates. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is supposed to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nWait, in the [2,2] case, the elements are not unique. \n\nThe code's loop is popping elements and checking if there are duplicates. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nIn the [2,2] case, after processing both elements, the count of unique elements is zero. \n\nBut how does that help? \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nThe code's variables are: \n\nInitially, a is the list of elements. \n\nThe loop pops elements and checks if there are duplicates. \n\nIf there are duplicates, then the element is not unique. \n\nThe code's missing part might be to track the number of unique elements. \n\nPerhaps the code should have a variable 'unique' that counts the number of elements that are unique. \n\nBut the code's current variables are b, c, and a. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are not duplicates. \n\nWait, the code's loop is popping elements. For each element q, if there is another occurrence in the remaining a, then it's not unique. \n\nSo the code could be counting the number of unique elements. \n\nIn the [2,2] case, both elements are not unique. So the number of unique elements is zero. \n\nThe formula would then be: \n\nsteps = (original length - zeros) + (if there are no zeros and all elements are processed, then add 1 if there are any unique elements?) \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's formula is correct except for cases where the number of elements is even and all are duplicates. \n\nIn the [2,2] case, the formula gives 3, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nThe difference is 1. \n\nPerhaps the code should subtract 1 in such cases. \n\nAlternatively, the code's formula is correct except when all elements are the same and even in count. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the code's formula is correct except when the number of elements is even and all are the same. \n\nIn that case, the formula overcounts by 1. \n\nSo the missing code in the while loop must be handling this case. \n\nPerhaps the code should, when a duplicate is found, decrement some variable. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is supposed to count the number of elements that are not duplicates. \n\nWait, the code's loop is popping elements and checking if there are duplicates. \n\nSuppose the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nThe code could have a variable 'unique_count' initialized to 0. \n\nThen, for each element q popped: \n\nif a.count(q) ==0 \u2192 it's unique. \n\nWait, but after popping q, the remaining a is checked. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing part is to break the loop early when a duplicate is found. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing code is to do nothing, but the formula is wrong. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct completion for program2's missing code is to do nothing (pass), but the formula is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's missing part is to remove the duplicate. \n\nWait, in the [2,2] case, when the first element is popped (2), and a has another 2. \n\nThen, the code could do a.pop() again to remove the duplicate. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the code should, when a.count(q) >0, then remove another occurrence. \n\nBut since the list is being popped, it's hard to track. \n\nAlternatively, the code should, when a duplicate is found, do a.pop() again, but this might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the code is supposed to count the number of elements that are not duplicates. \n\nPerhaps the code's missing part is to do a.pop() again, but that would require knowing the index. \n\nAlternatively, the code is supposed to track the number of elements that are unique. \n\nBut I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for another way. \n\nThe problem's note says that the answer can be computed as the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus 1 if there were no zeros initially and all elements are processed. \n\nWait, in the [2,2] case, the code's formula gives 2+1-0=3, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nSo the formula is wrong. \n\nThe correct answer is 2, which is the total elements (2) minus zeros (0) \u2192 2. \n\nSo perhaps the formula should be (b - c) + (a == [] and c ==0 ? 0 : 0). \n\nWait, then the formula would be b -c. \n\nIn the first example, 3-0=3, but the correct answer is 4. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the correct formula is (b - c) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts). \n\nIn the first example, 3-0 +1=4 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the [2,2] case, 2-0 +0=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nIn the [1,1,1] case, 3-0 +1=4 \u2192 but correct answer is 3. \n\nHmm, discrepancy again. \n\nWait the [1,1,1] case has count 3 (odd). So formula gives 4, but correct is 3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is (b - c) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts -1). \n\nIn the first example, 3+0 \u21923 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is (b - c) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts) // 1. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is (b - c) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts) if there are any, else 0. \n\nIn the [1,1,1] case, that would be 3+1=4 \u2192 wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct formula is (b - c) + (number of non-zero elements with odd counts) if there are any, else 0. \n\nBut that doesn't work for the first example. \n\nAlternatively, the correct formula is the total number of elements minus the number of zeros plus the number of non-zero elements with odd counts minus 1 if there is at least one. \n\nIn the first example, 3+1-1=3 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is taking too long. Maybe I should proceed to the third program and come back. \n\nProgram3.py: The problem is to compute for each vertex i the number of trees where i is the centroid. The code provided has an incomplete inv function. The inv function is needed for modular inverse. \n\nThe code has a function modmul which multiplies two numbers and adds a third, then mod MOD. \n\nThe inv function is needed to compute the modular inverse of x modulo 998244353. \n\nThe code's inv function is incomplete. \n\nThe standard way to compute the modular inverse is using Fermat's little theorem, since MOD is prime. \n\nThe inverse of x mod MOD is pow(x, MOD-2, MOD). \n\nSo the inv function should return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD). \n\nSo the missing code for inv is: \n\nreturn pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\nThat's straightforward. \n\nNow back to program2. \n\nPerhaps the correct completion for the missing code is to do nothing, but the formula is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is supposed to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nThe code's loop is popping elements and checking if there are duplicates. \n\nIf there are duplicates, then the element is not unique. \n\nThe code could be counting the number of unique elements. \n\nThe variable 'unique' could be initialized to 0. \n\nThen, in the loop: \n\nif a.count(q) ==0 \u2192 then it's unique. \n\nWait, but after popping q, the remaining a is checked. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of unique elements. \n\nThe code could have a variable 'unique' initialized to 0. \n\nThen, for each q popped: \n\nif a.count(q) ==0 \u2192 then it's unique. \n\nunique +=1 \n\nBut the code's loop is popping elements one by one. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of elements that are unique. \n\nThe code's loop is processing elements and checking if there are duplicates. \n\nIf there are duplicates, then the element is not unique. \n\nSo the code could be counting the number of unique elements. \n\nThe code's missing part could be: \n\nif a.count(q) >0: \n\n    a.remove(q) \n\nBut this would modify the list. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to count the number of unique elements. \n\nThe code's loop is popping elements and checking if there are duplicates. \n\nThe number of unique elements is the count of elements that have no other occurrences. \n\nThe code could track this by: \n\nunique =0 \n\nfor each element q popped: \n\n    if a.count(q) ==0 \u2192 unique +=1 \n\n    else \u2192 not unique \n\nBut the code's loop is popping elements one by one. \n\nAlternatively, the code's loop is trying to count the number of unique elements. \n\nThe code's missing part could be: \n\nif a.count(q) >0: \n\n    a.remove(q) \n\nBut this would remove one occurrence, so that the next check would have a.count(q) reduced. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing part is to do nothing, and the formula is correct except for the case when all elements are the same and even in count. \n\nIn the [2,2] case, the formula gives 3, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nThe difference is 1. \n\nPerhaps the code should subtract 1 in such cases. \n\nThe code's print statement could be: \n\nprint(b + (a == [] and c ==0 and (b %2 ==1)) -c) \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's formula is correct except when the number of elements is even and all are the same. \n\nIn such cases, the formula overcounts by 1. \n\nSo the code's missing part could be to track whether all elements are the same. \n\nBut how to do that in the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing part is to break the loop early when a duplicate is found. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct completion for program2's missing code is to do nothing (pass), and the formula is correct except for some cases. \n\nBut the example with [2,2] would fail. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing part is to do a.pop() again when a duplicate is found. \n\nFor example: \n\nif a.count(q) >0: \n\n    a.pop(a.index(q)) \n\nBut this would remove another occurrence of q. \n\nIn the [2,2] case: \n\nFirst iteration: q is 2 (popped from [2,2]). \n\na is now [2]. \n\na.count(q) is 1>0 \u2192 enter the if clause. \n\nThen, a.pop(a.index(2)) \u2192 removes the remaining 2. \n\nNow a is empty. \n\nThe loop continues. \n\nNext iteration: a is empty \u2192 loop ends. \n\nThe final a is empty. \n\nThe formula would be 2 + (True and c==0) \u2192 2+1-0=3 \u2192 still wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing part is to do nothing, but the formula is correct except when the number of elements is even and all are the same. \n\nIn such cases, the formula overcounts by 1. \n\nSo the code's formula should subtract 1 in such cases. \n\nBut how to detect that. \n\nThe code's loop could track whether all elements are the same. \n\nBut this requires additional variables. \n\nAlternatively, the code's missing part is to do nothing, and the correct answer is to use the formula as is, but the test case [2,2] is not part of the input constraints. \n\nThe problem's input constraints allow n>=2. \n\nBut the code's formula is incorrect for this case. \n\nPerhaps the correct completion for the missing code is to do nothing, and the formula is correct except for cases where all elements are the same and even in count. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to fill in the missing parts as best as I can. \n\nFor program1.py: \n\nThe missing part for n==1 is to output 1 swap between positions 1 and 2. \n\nThe code for n==1 should be: \n\nif n ==1: \n\n    print(1) \n\n    print(1,2) \n\n    continue \n\nFor program2.py: \n\nThe missing code in the while loop is perhaps to do nothing. \n\nThe code's formula is correct except for cases where all elements are the same and even in count. \n\nBut since the problem requires the code to work for all test cases, perhaps the missing code is to do nothing. \n\nFor program3.py: \n\nThe inv function should return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD). \n\nSo the missing code for inv is: \n\nreturn pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) \n\nNow, putting it all together. \n\nThe final answers are: \n\nprogram1: \n\nif n ==1: \n\n    print(1) \n\n    print(1,2) \n\n    continue \n\nprogram2: \n\nThe missing code is pass (no code needed). \n\nprogram3: \n\nreturn pow(x, MOD-2, MOD) \n\nWait, but the code for program3 has other issues? \n\nLooking at the code for program3: \n\nThe code has a loop for i in range((n+1)//2): \n\nbase = fact[n-1] \n\nfrac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)) \n\nout[i] = modmul(base, frac) \n\nThen, the rem variable is used in a loop. \n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. However, the problem says to complete the missing inv function. \n\nSo the only missing part is the inv function. \n\nThus, the answers are: \n\nprogram1's missing code is for the n==1 case. \n\nprogram2's missing code is nothing (pass). \n\nprogram3's missing code is the inv function returning pow(x, MOD-2, MOD). \n\nBut I'm not sure about program2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the missing code in program2 is to do a.pop() again when a duplicate is found. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with these answers."
