Hmm, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is the entire array except the first or last element. Let me try to think of the first example's case. The first example's array must have a global max of 6 and min of 1. The optimal subsegment excludes the global max (6) and includes the global min (1). The subsegment's max is 5. So the total is (6-1)+(5-1)=9. If the subsegment is the entire array except the global max (6), then the subsegment's max would be 5, min 1. The first term is (6's value is excluded, so the outside is just 6. So the first term is 0. The second term is 5-1=4. Total is 4. \n\nWhich is worse than the optimal.

The second term is (max_sub - min_sub). The maximum of this is the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length n-1. For case 2: \n\nThe subsegment is length 1.

This approach would require O(n) time for each case. Let me see for the first example's case: \n\nThe optimal subsegment is length 2. So case 3 would include it. The first term would be (max_outside - min_outside) = (6-1) =5. The second term is (5-1)=4. Total 9. Which is correct. The second example's optimal subsegment is length 3. Hmm, this approach would miss it. But perhaps the maximum is achieved in one of the cases considered. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved in case 1 or 3. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Perhaps this is the best approach given time constraints. So the plan is: For each test case: \n\n1. Compute the global_max and global_min of the array. 2. Compute the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length n-1. 3. Compute the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) for all single elements. 4. Compute the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside + max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length 2. \n\n5. The answer is the maximum of these three values. Now, how to compute these efficiently. For step 2: \n\nFor subsegments of length n-1, there are n possible subsegments (each missing one element). For each element i (0-based), the subsegment is the array excluding a[i]. The max and min of the subsegment can be computed using prefix and suffix arrays.",

But without knowing the exact input, it's hard to say. But given time constraints, this approach is the best I can think of. So now, to write the code for program1.py. First, for each test case: \n\nRead n and the array a. \n\nCompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min. Compute global_max and global_min. Then compute the three cases. Case 1: \n\nmax_case1 = max( (max_sub - min_sub) for all i in 0..n-1 ) \n\nwhere max_sub is max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]) \n\nmin_sub is min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1]) Case 2: \n\nmax_case2 = max( (max_outside - min_outside) for all i in 0..n-1 ) \n\nwhere max_outside is max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]) \n\nmin_outside is min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1]) Case3: \n\nmax_case3 = max over i from 0 to n-2 of: \n\nmax_outside = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+2]) \n\nmin_outside = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+2]) \n\nmax_sub = max(a[i], a[i+1]) min_sub = min(a[i], a[i+1]) \n\ntotal = (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub) The maximum of case1, case2, case3 is the answer. Wait, but the problem requires the subsegment to be proper. A proper subsegment must have length <n. So for case1, the subsegments of length n-1 are proper. For case2, the subsegments of length 1 are proper. For case3, length 2 is proper. Thus, this approach is valid. Now, implementing this in code. First, the prefix and suffix arrays. For prefix_max: \n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0] \n\nfor i from 1 to n-1: \n\nprefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i]) \n\nprefix_min similarly. suffix_max[n-1] = a[n-1] \n\nfor i from n-2 down to 0: \n\nsuffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i]) \n\nSimilarly for suffix_min.

Wait, the problem requires the subsegment to be a proper subsegment. So the entire array is not allowed. The beauty is (max of the outside - min of the outside) + (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment). The maximum of this expression. Let me think of the outside as the array excluding the subsegment. The outside is the elements before l and after r. The outside's max and min are the maximum and minimum of the elements not in the subsegment. The subsegment's max and min are the max and min of the subsegment. The total is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). Hmm, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. In that case, the outside is just that one element. So the first term is zero. The second term is the max and min of the subsegment.",

So the maximum possible subsegment length is n-1. So, perhaps the optimal subsegment is of length n-1. Let's see. Suppose the subsegment is from 0 to n-2 (excluding the last element). Then the outside is the last element. The outside's max and min are just the last element. So the first term is (last element - last element) = 0. The second term is (max of the first n-1 elements minus their min). Alternatively, if the subsegment is from 1 to n-1 (excluding the first element), then the outside is the first element. The first term is (a[0] - a[0]) = 0. The second term is (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment).

To compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each position the prefix and suffix max and min arrays. Let me think of the steps again: First, precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. prefix_max[i] is the maximum of the first i elements. Wait, perhaps better to have prefix_max[i] as the maximum from the start up to index i (assuming 0-based). Similarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum from index i to the end. Wait, let's define:\n\nprefix_max[i] = max(a[0.. i])\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(a[0.. i])\n\nsuffix_max[i] = max(a[i..n-1])\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(a[i..n-1]) Then, for a subsegment from l to r (0-based?), the outside elements are the elements before l and after r. The max_outside would be the maximum between the prefix_max[l-1] and suffix_max[r+1]. Similarly, the min_outside is the minimum between prefix_min[l-1] and suffix_min[r+1].",

The minimal number of clones is the number of copies needed to have enough elements of x. \n\nSuppose we have k copies. The total number of x's across all copies is m * k. We need at least one copy to have all n elements as x. So, the number of x's in all copies must be at least n. Thus, m * k >= n \u2192 k >= ceil(n/m). The number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). Because initially there is 1 copy. The number of swaps needed is (n - m) * (number of copies needed) ? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, the minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). Because: \n\n- The number of clones is (ceil(n/m) -1). - The number of swaps is (n - m). Because each non-x element in the target array must be replaced by an x from another copy. Each swap can move one x into the target array. Thus, the total is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). But let's see the example. Second example: The array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The most frequent element is 0 and 3, both with count 2. Wait, the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. The counts are: \n\n0: 2 \n\n1:1 \n\n3:2 \n\n7:1 So the maximum is 2. \n\nn=6. \n\nceil(6/2) =3. So clones needed: 3-1=2. Swaps needed: 6-2=4. Total 2+4=6, which matches the example. Yes! So the formula is: \n\nans = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m) But wait, the initial ans in the code is n -m. The while loop is probably trying to compute ceil(n/m). Wait, the code has: \n\nm = max(Counter(li).values()) \n\nans =n -m \n\nwhile(m <n): \n\n    # TODO \n\nThe loop is while m <n. \n\nPerhaps the loop is trying to compute the number of clones needed. The number of clones needed is ceil(n/m) -1. But how to compute that. Alternatively, the number of clones needed is (n-1)//m. Because ceil(n/m) = (n +m-1)//m \n\nThus, ceil(n/m) -1 = (n +m-1)//m -1 = (n-1)//m So the number of clones is (n-1)//m \n\nThus, the total operations is (n-1)//m + (n -m) Wait, let's see: \n\nIn the example, n=6, m=2. (n-1)//m =5//2=2. (n -m)=4. Total 2+4=6. Yes. Another example: If m =n, then (n-1)//m =0, and (n-m)=0 \u2192 total 0. Which is correct. Another example: \n\nn=5, m=3 \u2192 ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 clones needed 1. Total 1 + (5-3)=3. Yes. Thus, the formula is correct. So the code should compute: k = (n-1) // m \n\nans = k + (n -m) Thus, the missing code in program2.py is to compute this. The while loop is not needed. The code currently has: \n\nfrom collections import Counter \n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    n=len(li:=li.split()); \n\n    m = max(Counter(li).values()) \n\n    ans =n-m \n\n    while(m <n): \n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\n    print(ans) The while loop is unnecessary. The correct code should compute k = (n-1)//m \n\nans = (n-1)//m + (n -m) Thus, the missing code is to replace the while loop with this calculation. But the code currently has a while loop. Perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of clones needed. Alternatively, the code can be fixed by replacing the while loop with the correct formula. Thus, the completion for program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation of k and ans. The code should be: \n\nfrom collections import Counter \n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    n=len(li:=li.split()); \n\n    m = max(Counter(li).values()) \n\n    ans = ( (n-1) // m ) + (n - m) \n\n    print(ans) But the original code has a while loop.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the maximum beauty of a proper subsegment. The beauty is calculated as the difference between max and min of the remaining elements outside the subsegment plus the difference between max and min of the subsegment itself. Hmm, so for each possible subsegment (l to r), we need to compute this value and find the maximum. But with n up to 1e5, a brute-force approach would be way too slow. \n\nWait, the key here is to find an efficient way to compute the max and min for the entire array except the subsegment, and also for the subsegment. Maybe precomputing prefix and suffix max/min arrays would help. Let me think: For any l and r, the outside elements are the elements before l and after r. So the max of the outside is the max between the prefix up to l-1 and the suffix from r+1. Similarly for the min. \n\nSo, let's precompute for each position the prefix max, prefix min, suffix max, and suffix min. Then, for any l and r, the outside max is max(prefix_max[l-1], suffix_max[r+1]), and similarly for the min. \n\nFor the subsegment's max and min, we can precompute a 2D array for ranges, but that's O(n^2) which is not feasible. Alternatively, using a segment tree or sparse table for range max and min queries. Since n is up to 1e5, a sparse table might be better here. \n\nThe plan is: \n\n1. Precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n2. Precompute a sparse table for range max and min queries. \n3. Iterate over all possible l and r (but how?), but even that would be O(n^2). \n\nWait, but the problem requires considering all possible proper subsegments. So O(n^2) is impossible. Need a smarter approach. \n\nWait, the maximum possible beauty would come from certain candidates. Let's think of the maximum possible terms. The beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). To maximize this, each term should be as large as possible. \n\nThe first term (max_outside - min_outside) is maximized when the outside has a large spread. The second term (max_sub - min_sub) is also maximized when the subsegment has a large spread. \n\nPerhaps the optimal subsegment is either the entire array except the first element, or the last, or some other edge cases. Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. Wait, but the problem states it's a proper subsegment, so the subsegment can't be the entire array. So the maximum possible subsegment length is n-1. \n\nWait, but even considering all possible l and r where the subsegment is of length n-1, that's O(n) possibilities. Maybe the maximum is achieved in such cases. Let me check the examples given. \n\nIn the first example's note, the optimal subsegment is l=7, r=8 (assuming n is 8?), so the subsegment is of length 2. Hmm, so maybe the maximum can come from smaller subsegments. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) minus the min or max of a single element? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty can be found by considering the maximum between (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). Wait, but when the subsegment is excluded, the outside's max and min would be the same as the entire array except the subsegment. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible positions where the subsegment is either the first element, last element, or some other specific positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). But how to compute this efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible beauty would be (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). But when the subsegment is excluded, the outside's max and min would be the same as the entire array except the subsegment. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beauty is (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). But when the subsegment is excluded, the outside's max and min could be the same as the entire array's max and min, except if the subsegment contains the global max or min. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of the problem differently. \n\nSuppose we have the entire array's max and min. If we exclude a subsegment that contains the global max, then the outside's max would be the next highest value. Similarly for the min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is achieved when the subsegment is a single element. Let's see: \n\nSuppose the subsegment is a single element a_i. Then the outside is the entire array except a_i. The outside's max and min would be the global max and min except a_i. The subsegment's max and min are a_i. So the beauty would be (max_without_a_i - min_without_a_i) + (a_i - a_i) = (max_without_a_i - min_without_a_i). \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is two elements, then the outside's max and min could be the global max and min except those two. \n\nHmm, but how do we find the best possible combination? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). But the subsegment's max and min can be up to the global max and min. \n\nWait, but when the subsegment is the entire array except one element, then the outside's max and min would be the global max and min (if the excluded element isn't the global max or min). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). But the subsegment can't be the entire array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). But how to compute this efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible beauty is the maximum over all possible subsegments of ( (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub) ). \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each position the prefix and suffix max and min arrays. \n\nLet me think of the steps again:\n\nFirst, precompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min arrays. \n\nprefix_max[i] is the maximum of the first i elements. \n\nWait, perhaps better to have prefix_max[i] as the maximum from the start up to index i (assuming 0-based). Similarly, suffix_max[i] is the maximum from index i to the end. \n\nWait, let's define:\n\nprefix_max[i] = max(a[0..i])\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(a[0..i])\n\nsuffix_max[i] = max(a[i..n-1])\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(a[i..n-1])\n\nThen, for a subsegment from l to r (0-based?), the outside elements are the elements before l and after r. \n\nThe max_outside would be the maximum between the prefix_max[l-1] and suffix_max[r+1]. \n\nSimilarly, the min_outside is the minimum between prefix_min[l-1] and suffix_min[r+1]. \n\nThe subsegment's max and min can be found using the range max and min. \n\nBut how to compute the max and min of a subsegment a[l..r] quickly? \n\nWe can use a segment tree for range queries, but building a segment tree for each test case might be feasible since n is up to 1e5 and t is up to 1e3, but the sum of n is 1e5. \n\nAlternatively, using a sparse table for range max and min. \n\nOnce we have these structures, for each possible l and r, we can compute the four terms. \n\nBut even with O(1) per query, iterating over all possible l and r would be O(n^2), which is way too big. \n\nHmm, so we need a smarter way. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beauty can be found by considering certain candidates for l and r. For example, the subsegment that excludes the global min or max. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). \n\nWait, but when the subsegment is the entire array except one element, then the outside's max and min would be the global max and min (unless the excluded element was the global max or min). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). \n\nWait, but the outside's max and min could be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nWait, but the problem requires a proper subsegment, so the subsegment can't be the entire array. So the maximum possible subsegment length is n-1. \n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subsegment is of length n-1. Let's see. \n\nSuppose the subsegment is from 0 to n-2 (excluding the last element). Then the outside is the last element. The outside's max and min are just the last element. So the first term is (last element - last element) = 0. The second term is (max of the first n-1 elements minus their min). \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is from 1 to n-1 (excluding the first element), then the outside is the first element. The first term is (a[0] - a[0]) = 0. The second term is (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment). \n\nHmm, but maybe the best is when the subsegment excludes an element that is either the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nWait, but in that case, the outside's max and min would be the excluded element. So the first term would be (excluded element's value minus itself) which is zero. So the total would be the subsegment's max - min. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is the entire array except the first element, then the outside is the first element. So the first term is (a[0] - a[0]) = 0. The second term is the max and min of the subsegment. \n\nHmm, but maybe there's a better scenario where the subsegment is not the entire array except one element. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is a single element. \n\nWait, in that case, the outside's max and min would be the global max and min except that element. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to realize that the maximum possible beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nWait, but the first term would be (max of the outside minus min of the outside). The outside is the excluded element. So if the excluded element is not the global max or min, then the outside's max and min would be the same as the global. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose the array is [1,3,2,4]. The global max is 4, min is 1. \n\nIf the subsegment is the first three elements (indices 0-2), then the outside is the last element (4). The first term is (4 -4) =0. The second term is (3-1)=2. Total is 2. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is the last three elements (indices 1-3), then the outside is the first element (1). The first term is (1-1)=0. The second term is (4-2)=2. Total is 2. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is the entire array except the first element (indices 1-3), then the outside is the first element (1). The first term is (max of outside (1) - min (1)) =0. The second term is (4-2)=2. \n\nHmm, but what if the subsegment is the first element (indices 0-0). The outside is the rest. The outside's max is 4, min is 2. So first term is 4-2=2. The subsegment's max and min are 1. So total is 2 +0 =2. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is the last element (indices 3-3). The outside is the first three elements. Their max is 3, min is 1. So first term is 3-1=2. The subsegment's term is 4-4=0. Total is 2. \n\nHmm, so in this case, the maximum is 2. \n\nBut what if the array is [1,5,3,2]. The global max is 5, min 1. \n\nSuppose the subsegment is the first three elements (indices 0-2). The outside is the last element (2). The first term is 2-2=0. The subsegment's max is 5, min 1. So total is 4. \n\nThat's better. \n\nSo in this case, the maximum is 4. \n\nSo the maximum can be achieved when the subsegment is the first n-1 elements, excluding the last element. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nWait, in the example above, when the subsegment is the first three elements (excluding the last element 2), the outside is 2. The first term is 0. The second term is (5-1)=4. So total is 4. \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is the entire array except the second element (5), then the outside includes 5? No, because the subsegment is excluding that element. \n\nWait, the subsegment is the entire array except one element. So when we exclude the element 5 (the second element), the subsegment is the first, third, and fourth elements. The outside is the excluded element (5). The first term is (5-5)=0. The subsegment's max is max(1,3,2)=3, min 1. So the second term is 2. Total is 2. \n\nSo the best is when we exclude the last element. \n\nHmm, so the maximum is achieved when the excluded element is the one that allows the subsegment to have a large max-min. \n\nSo perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum over all possible elements to exclude (so the subsegment is the entire array except that element) of ( (max of the outside (which is the excluded element's value) minus min of the outside (same value) ) + (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) ). \n\nWait, but the outside when excluding an element is just that element. So the first term is 0. So the total is the max of (max_sub - min_sub) for all possible subsegments of length n-1. \n\nWait, but in the example where the array is [1,5,3,2], the subsegment of length 3 (excluding the last element) gives a max of 5 and min 1, so 4. \n\nAlternatively, if we exclude the first element (1), the subsegment is [5,3,2]. The max is 5, min 2. So 5-2=3. \n\nSo the maximum is 4. \n\nSo the maximum is the maximum of (max of the subsegment of length n-1 minus min of that subsegment) over all possible positions where the subsegment is missing one element. \n\nWait, but what if there's a better subsegment that is not of length n-1? \n\nSuppose the array is [1, 6, 2, 3, 4]. The global max is 6, min 1. \n\nIf the subsegment is the first two elements (indices 0-1), then the outside is the rest. The outside's max is 4, min 2. So first term is 4-2=2. The subsegment's max is 6, min 1. So total is 2 +5 =7. \n\nWhich is better than any subsegment of length n-1. \n\nHmm, so in this case, the maximum is 7. \n\nSo the previous approach of only considering subsegments of length n-1 is insufficient. \n\nHmm, so this complicates things. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe beauty is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nWe need to maximize this. \n\nLet me think of the terms: \n\nThe first term (max_outside - min_outside) can be as large as possible when the outside has a large spread. \n\nThe second term (max_sub - min_sub) can also be large. \n\nSo the maximum is the sum of these two terms. \n\nTo maximize this, perhaps the best is to have the subsegment exclude the elements that are the global max and min. \n\nWait, but that might not be possible. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible value of the first term is (global_max - global_min). \n\nThe second term can also be (global_max - global_min). \n\nSo the total would be 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nBut this is only possible if the subsegment excludes neither the global max nor the global min. \n\nWait, for example, if the subsegment is the entire array except the global max. Then the outside's max is the global max, but the subsegment's max is the next highest. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus (global_max - global_min) = 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nBut how to achieve this? \n\nSuppose the array has elements [a, b, c, d], where a is the global min and d is the global max. \n\nIf the subsegment is the middle two elements (b and c), then the outside is a and d. The first term is (d - a). The subsegment's max and min could be (max(b,c) - min(b,c)). \n\nIf the subsegment's max and min are such that their difference is (d - a), then the total would be 2*(d -a). \n\nBut that requires that the subsegment includes both the global max and min, which is not possible if the subsegment is excluding them. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is (global_max - global_min) plus (some other max-min). \n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering all possible subsegments where the subsegment's max and min are as large as possible, and the outside's max and min also as large as possible. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nWait, but in the example I thought of earlier where the subsegment is the first two elements, the first term is (max of the outside (4) - min (2)) = 2, and the second term is (6-1)=5, totaling 7. \n\nThe global max and min are 6 and 1. So the first term (2) plus the second (5) gives 7. \n\nThe global max - min is 5, so 5+5 would be 10, but that's not achievable. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum can be achieved in a subsegment that is not of length n-1. \n\nThis suggests that we need a way to find the best possible subsegment quickly. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering all possible subsegments where the subsegment's max and min are as large as possible, and the outside's max and min are also as large as possible. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can precompute for each position the prefix and suffix max and min arrays, and also precompute the range max and min for any interval. \n\nThen, for each possible l and r, compute the four terms. \n\nBut even with O(1) per query, iterating over all l and r is O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is either the first k elements, last k elements, or some other specific positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nWait, but in the example where the subsegment is the first two elements, the outside includes the global max and min. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum can be found by considering all possible subsegments of length 1 or 2, but that's still O(n) possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nWait, the first term (max_outside - min_outside) can be written as (max of (prefix_max[l-1], suffix_max[r+1]) - min of (prefix_min[l-1], suffix_min[r+1])). \n\nThe second term is (range_max(l, r) - range_min(l, r)). \n\nSo the total is (max_outside - min_outside) + (range_max(l, r) - range_min(l, r)). \n\nWe need to find the maximum of this over all l <= r, where the subsegment is proper (so r - l +1 < n). \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is a single element. Let's see: \n\nSuppose the subsegment is a single element a[i]. \n\nThen the outside is the rest of the array. \n\nThe max_outside is the global max except a[i], and the min_outside is the global min except a[i]. \n\nThe second term is 0 (since max and min of a single element are the same). \n\nSo the total is (max_outside - min_outside). \n\nAlternatively, if the subsegment is two elements, then the second term is their max - min, and the first term is the outside's max - min. \n\nHmm, but how to find the best combination. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering all possible positions where the subsegment is between l and r, and the outside's max and min are as large as possible. \n\nPerhaps the maximum is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus (max_sub - min_sub) when the subsegment does not include either the global max or min. \n\nWait, but then the outside would include both, so the first term would be (global_max - global_min). \n\nSo the total would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nTo maximize this, the subsegment's max and min should also be as large as possible. \n\nHmm, but how to find such a subsegment. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible beauty is (global_max - global_min) plus (global_max - global_min) = 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nThis would require that the subsegment's max and min are also global_max and global_min. But that would require the subsegment to include both, but then the outside would exclude them, so the first term would be (something else). \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix arrays, and also the range max and min using a sparse table. Then, iterate over all possible l and r, but in a way that reduces the number of iterations. \n\nWait, but with n up to 1e5, even O(n) is manageable, but O(n^2) is not. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering the best possible subsegment where the subsegment is either the first k elements, last k elements, or some other specific positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nWait, but in the example where the subsegment is the first two elements, the first term is (max of the outside (4) - min (2)) = 2, and the second term is (6-1)=5, totaling 7. \n\nThe global max and min are 6 and 1. So the first term (2) plus the second (5) gives 7. \n\nThe maximum possible when excluding one element would be when excluding the last element (4), the subsegment is the first four elements (assuming n=5?), but I'm getting confused. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to realize that the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nWait, but in that case, the first term would be (max of the outside minus min of the outside). The outside is the excluded element. So the first term is zero. So the total is the subsegment's max minus min. \n\nSo the maximum would be the maximum of (max of the subsegment of length n-1 minus min of that subsegment) over all possible positions. \n\nBut in the example where the subsegment is the first two elements (length 2), the total is higher. \n\nHmm, so this approach would miss that case. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array minus min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is any possible subsegment. \n\nWait, but how to compute this efficiently. \n\nThe first term (max_outside - min_outside) can be up to (global_max - global_min) if the subsegment doesn't include either. \n\nThe second term can also be up to (global_max - global_min) if the subsegment includes both. \n\nSo the total could be up to 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nTo achieve this, the subsegment must include both the global max and min, and the outside must also include both. \n\nWait, but if the subsegment includes both, then the outside excludes them. So the outside's max and min would be the next highest and lowest. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix arrays and the range max and min, then iterate over all possible l and r in O(n) time by considering certain candidates. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) when the subsegment is the entire array except the first or last element. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments where the subsegment is the first k elements or last k elements. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments of length 1, 2, or n-1. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nWait, the first term (max_outside - min_outside) can be written as (max of (prefix_max[l-1], suffix_max[r+1]) - min of (prefix_min[l-1], suffix_min[r+1])). \n\nThe second term is (range_max(l, r) - range_min(l, r)). \n\nSo the total is (max_outside - min_outside) + (range_max(l, r) - range_min(l, r)). \n\nWe need to find the maximum of this over all l <= r where the subsegment is proper. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the subsegment is the entire array except the first or last element. \n\nLet me think of the first example given in the problem: \n\nSample Input 1: \n\nSuppose the array is such that the optimal subsegment is l=7, r=8 (assuming 1-based). The outside's max and min are 6 and 1. The subsegment's max and min are 5 and 1. So the total is (6-1)+(5-1)=5+4=9. \n\nThe global max and min would be 6 and 1. So the first term is (6-1)=5, the second term is (5-1)=4. \n\nSo the total is 9. \n\nIn this case, the subsegment is of length 2. \n\nHmm, so the maximum can be achieved with a small subsegment. \n\nThis suggests that we need to consider all possible subsegments. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe maximum beauty can be found by considering all possible subsegments where the subsegment's max and min are as large as possible, and the outside's max and min are also as large as possible. \n\nTo compute this, perhaps we can precompute for each position the prefix and suffix max and min arrays, and also precompute the range max and min using a sparse table. \n\nThen, iterate over all possible l and r, but in a way that reduces the number of iterations. \n\nWait, but even with O(n^2) time, it's impossible for n=1e5. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is either the first or last element, or some other specific cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments of length 1, 2, or n-1. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum can be found by considering the following candidates: \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the first element. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the last element. \n\n- The subsegment is the first element. \n\n- The subsegment is the last element. \n\n- The subsegment is the first two elements. \n\n- The subsegment is the last two elements. \n\n- The subsegment is the middle two elements. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the global max. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except the global min. \n\n- The subsegment is the entire array except both the global max and min. \n\nBut this is still a lot of possibilities, but perhaps manageable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments of length 1, 2, or n-1. \n\nThis would require O(n) time. \n\nLet me see: \n\nFor subsegments of length 1: \n\nEach element is a subsegment. The outside is the rest. \n\nThe first term is (max of the outside - min of the outside). \n\nThe second term is 0. \n\nSo the total is (max_outside - min_outside). \n\nFor subsegments of length 2: \n\nEach pair of consecutive elements. \n\nThe first term is (max of the outside - min of the outside). \n\nThe second term is (max of the two elements - min of them). \n\nFor subsegments of length n-1: \n\nEach possible subsegment missing one element. \n\nThe first term is 0 (since the outside is the excluded element). \n\nThe second term is (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment). \n\nSo the maximum among all these candidates could be the answer. \n\nThis approach would require O(n) time for each test case. \n\nLet me see if this would work for the examples. \n\nFirst example's note: \n\nThe optimal subsegment is length 2. So it would be considered in the length 2 case. \n\nSecond example's note: \n\nThe optimal subsegment is length 3 (r-l+1 = 3?), but n is 6. So length 3 is less than 6. \n\nWait, the second example's note says the optimal is l=2, r=4 (assuming 1-based). So the length is 3. \n\nHmm, so this approach would miss that case. \n\nHmm, so this approach would not work. \n\nHmm, so this is a problem. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment minus min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nBut to compute this efficiently, we can precompute for each possible l and r the max and min of the subsegment, and the max and min of the outside. \n\nBut how to do this in O(n) or O(n log n) time. \n\nWait, the outside's max is the maximum between the prefix_max[l-1] and suffix_max[r+1]. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nThe subsegment's max and min can be found using a sparse table. \n\nSo for each possible l and r, the computation is O(1). \n\nBut iterating over all l and r is O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum can be found by considering the following: \n\nThe maximum beauty is the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nWe can split this into two terms. \n\nThe first term (max_outside - min_outside) can be up to (global_max - global_min) if the subsegment doesn't include either. \n\nThe second term can also be up to (global_max - global_min) if the subsegment includes both. \n\nSo the maximum possible is 2*(global_max - global_min). \n\nTo achieve this, the subsegment must include both the global max and min, and the outside must also include both. \n\nWait, but if the subsegment includes both, then the outside excludes them. So the outside's max and min would be the next highest and lowest. \n\nHmm, so this is not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum is (global_max - global_min) plus (max_sub - min_sub), where the subsegment includes the global max and min. \n\nThen the first term would be the outside's max and min, which could be smaller. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nWait, the problem requires the subsegment to be a proper subsegment. So the entire array is not allowed. \n\nThe beauty is (max of the outside - min of the outside) + (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment). \n\nThe maximum of this expression. \n\nLet me think of the outside as the array excluding the subsegment. \n\nThe outside is the elements before l and after r. \n\nThe outside's max and min are the maximum and minimum of the elements not in the subsegment. \n\nThe subsegment's max and min are the max and min of the subsegment. \n\nThe total is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is the entire array except one element. \n\nIn that case, the outside is just that one element. So the first term is zero. \n\nThe second term is the max and min of the subsegment. \n\nThe maximum of this over all possible excluded elements would be the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length n-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum between this and other cases where the first term is large. \n\nFor example, if the subsegment is small, then the outside could have a large spread. \n\nSuppose the subsegment is a single element which is the global min. \n\nThen the outside's max is global_max, min is the next smallest. \n\nSo the first term is (global_max - next_min). \n\nThe second term is zero. \n\nThis could be better than the case where the first term is zero but the second term is large. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the maximum is the maximum between the two cases: \n\n1. The subsegment is of length n-1 (so first term is zero, second term is max_sub - min_sub). \n\n2. The subsegment is a single element (so first term is (max_outside - min_outside), second term is zero). \n\n3. The subsegment is two elements, which allows both terms to contribute. \n\nHmm, but how to compute this efficiently. \n\nPerhaps the maximum is the maximum between the following three values: \n\na) The maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length n-1. \n\nb) The maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) for all subsegments of length 1. \n\nc) The maximum of (max_outside - min_outside + max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length 2. \n\nThis would require O(n) time. \n\nLet me see if this would work for the first example. \n\nFirst example's optimal subsegment is length 2. \n\nSo case c would include it. \n\nSecond example's optimal subsegment is length 3. \n\nHmm, so this approach would miss that case. \n\nHmm, so this approach is not sufficient. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nPerhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the following two terms: \n\n- The maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all possible subsegments (since the first term can be zero when the subsegment is n-1). \n\n- The maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) for all possible subsegments (since the second term can be zero when the subsegment is a single element). \n\n- The maximum of (max_outside - min_outside + max_sub - min_sub) for all possible subsegments. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nThe first two terms can be computed in O(n) time using prefix and suffix arrays and sparse tables. \n\nThe third term requires considering all possible subsegments, which is O(n^2). \n\nHmm, this is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the first two terms. \n\nBut in the first example, the optimal is 9, which is the third case (both terms contribute). \n\nSo this approach would miss it. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps I should look for hints in the problem's note. \n\nThe first note says that in the first test case, the optimal subsegment is l=7, r=8 (assuming 1-based). The outside's max and min are 6 and 1. The subsegment's max and min are 5 and 1. \n\nSo the first term is 5, the second term is 4. Total 9. \n\nThe global max and min are 6 and 1. \n\nThe first term is (6-1) =5, which is the global max minus min. \n\nThe second term is (5-1)=4. \n\nSo the total is 9. \n\nThis suggests that the first term can be the global max minus min, and the second term can be another value. \n\nSo the subsegment must exclude the global max or min. \n\nWait, in this case, the subsegment is from 7 to 8 (assuming 1-based). The outside includes the global max (6) and the global min (1). \n\nSo the outside's max and min are global. \n\nThe subsegment's max is 5 (less than global max), min is 1 (same as global min). \n\nSo the first term is global max - min. \n\nThe second term is 5-1=4. \n\nSo the total is 5+4=9. \n\nThis suggests that the maximum can be achieved when the first term is the global max - min, and the second term is as large as possible. \n\nTo achieve this, the subsegment must not include the global max or min. \n\nWait, no. In this case, the subsegment includes the global min (1) but not the global max (6). \n\nHmm, so the outside includes the global max. \n\nSo the first term is global max - min. \n\nThe second term is the subsegment's max minus min. \n\nSo the total is (global_max - global_min) + (subsegment_max - subsegment_min). \n\nTo maximize this, we need the subsegment's max and min to be as large as possible. \n\nSo the maximum would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum possible (subsegment_max - subsegment_min) for subsegments that do not include the global max. \n\nHmm, but how to find this. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum between (global_max - global_min) plus (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments that do not include the global max or min. \n\nBut this is still not clear. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix arrays and the range max and min, then iterate over all possible l and r in O(n) time by considering certain candidates. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beauty can be found by considering all possible subsegments where the subsegment is between the first and last occurrence of the global max or min. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can precompute for each position the prefix and suffix max and min arrays, and also precompute the range max and min using a sparse table. \n\nThen, for each possible l and r, compute the four terms. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, this is O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum is achieved when the subsegment is the entire array except the first or last element. \n\nLet me try to think of the first example's case. \n\nThe first example's array must have a global max of 6 and min of 1. \n\nThe optimal subsegment excludes the global max (6) and includes the global min (1). \n\nThe subsegment's max is 5. \n\nSo the total is (6-1)+(5-1)=9. \n\nIf the subsegment is the entire array except the global max (6), then the subsegment's max would be 5, min 1. \n\nThe first term is (6's value is excluded, so the outside is just 6. So the first term is 0. \n\nThe second term is 5-1=4. Total is 4. \n\nWhich is worse than the optimal. \n\nHmm, so this approach would not work. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the solution approach elsewhere. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nThe first term is (max_outside - min_outside). \n\nThe second term is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum of this sum. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps the maximum is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments that do not include the global max or min. \n\nBecause then the first term would be (global_max - global_min). \n\nSo the total would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nTo maximize this, we need the subsegment's max and min to be as large as possible. \n\nSo the maximum would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for subsegments that exclude the global max and min. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max_sub - min_sub) for all possible subsegments. \n\nThe first term is fixed as the global max and min. \n\nThe second term is the subsegment's max and min. \n\nSo the maximum would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment. \n\nBut this is only possible if the subsegment does not include the global max or min. \n\nHmm, but the subsegment can include them. \n\nWait, if the subsegment includes the global max and min, then the outside's max and min would be smaller. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the solution code structure. \n\nThe user provided the code for program1.py as: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing code is the part that reads the array and computes the maximum beauty. \n\nThe problem requires for each test case to compute the maximum beauty over all proper subsegments. \n\nThe key is to find an O(n) or O(n log n) solution. \n\nPerhaps the solution is to realize that the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nWait, but how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nThe first term is fixed as the global max and min. \n\nThe second term is the subsegment's max and min. \n\nSo the maximum would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment. \n\nBut this would require that the subsegment does not include the global max or min. \n\nHmm, but this is not necessarily the case. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) plus (max_outside - min_outside). \n\nThe maximum of this can be found by considering all possible subsegments. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. \n\nPerhaps the maximum is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nThe first term is fixed as the global max and min. \n\nThe second term is the subsegment's max and min. \n\nSo the maximum would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment. \n\nBut this would require that the subsegment does not include the global max or min. \n\nHmm, but this is not necessarily true. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nThe first term is the global max and min. \n\nThe second term is the subsegment's max and min. \n\nSo the total is (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum of this over all subsegments. \n\nThis would be the case when the subsegment does not include the global max or min. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nThe maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) over all subsegments is the maximum possible for any subsegment. \n\nSo the total would be (global_max - global_min) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum of this would be when the subsegment's max and min are as large as possible. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum beauty is the maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) for all possible subsegments. \n\nThe first term is fixed as the global max and min. \n\nThe second term is the subsegment's max and min. \n\nSo the maximum would be (global_max - global_min) plus the maximum (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment. \n\nThis would be the case when the subsegment does not include the global max or min. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nThe maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) over all subsegments can be computed in O(n) time using Kadane-like algorithms. \n\nWait, but the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) over all subsegments can be found by finding the maximum and minimum for all possible subsegments. \n\nThis can be done in O(n) time using a sliding window approach. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for any subsegment is simply the global_max - global_min. \n\nBecause the entire array's max and min give the largest possible difference. \n\nBut the subsegment must be proper. \n\nSo the maximum possible (max_sub - min_sub) for a proper subsegment is the global_max - global_min if there exists a proper subsegment that includes both the global max and min. \n\nOtherwise, it would be the next possible maximum. \n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to precompute the prefix and suffix arrays and the range max and min using a sparse table. \n\nThen, for each possible l and r, compute the four terms and track the maximum. \n\nBut with n up to 1e5, this is O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum beauty is the maximum between the following two values: \n\n1. The maximum of (max of the entire array - min of the entire array) plus (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) for all subsegments of length n-1. \n\n2. The maximum of (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) plus (max of the outside - min of the outside) for all subsegments of length 1. \n\n3. The maximum of (max of the subsegment - min of the subsegment) plus (max of the outside - min of the outside) for all subsegments of length 2. \n\nThis would require O(n) time. \n\nLet me see: \n\nFor case 1: \n\nThe subsegment is of length n-1. The outside is one element. \n\nThe first term is (outside's max - min) = 0. \n\nThe second term is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum of this is the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length n-1. \n\nFor case 2: \n\nThe subsegment is length 1. \n\nThe first term is (max_outside - min_outside). \n\nThe second term is 0. \n\nThe maximum of this is the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) for all single elements. \n\nFor case 3: \n\nThe subsegment is length 2. \n\nThe first term is (max_outside - min_outside). \n\nThe second term is (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum of this over all pairs. \n\nThis approach would require O(n) time for each case. \n\nLet me see for the first example's case: \n\nThe optimal subsegment is length 2. \n\nSo case 3 would include it. \n\nThe first term would be (max_outside - min_outside) = (6-1) =5. \n\nThe second term is (5-1)=4. \n\nTotal 9. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThe second example's optimal subsegment is length 3. \n\nHmm, this approach would miss it. \n\nBut perhaps the maximum is achieved in one of the cases considered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum is achieved in case 1 or 3. \n\nHmm, but I'm not sure. \n\nPerhaps this is the best approach given time constraints. \n\nSo the plan is: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n1. Compute the global_max and global_min of the array. \n\n2. Compute the maximum of (max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length n-1. \n\n3. Compute the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside) for all single elements. \n\n4. Compute the maximum of (max_outside - min_outside + max_sub - min_sub) for all subsegments of length 2. \n\n5. The answer is the maximum of these three values. \n\nNow, how to compute these efficiently. \n\nFor step 2: \n\nFor subsegments of length n-1, there are n possible subsegments (each missing one element). \n\nFor each element i (0-based), the subsegment is the array excluding a[i]. \n\nThe max and min of the subsegment can be computed using prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nFor example, the max of the subsegment excluding a[i] is the maximum between prefix_max[i-1] and suffix_max[i+1]. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nSo for each i, compute max_sub = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]) \n\nmin_sub = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1]) \n\nthen the difference is max_sub - min_sub. \n\nThe maximum of these is the value for case 1. \n\nFor step 3: \n\nFor each single element a[i], the outside is the array excluding a[i]. \n\nThe max_outside is the global_max if a[i] is not the global_max, else the next highest. \n\nWait, no. The max_outside is the maximum of the entire array except a[i]. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can precompute for each position the maximum excluding that element. \n\nSimilarly for the minimum. \n\nThis can be done with prefix and suffix arrays. \n\nFor example, the max excluding a[i] is the maximum between prefix_max[i-1] and suffix_max[i+1]. \n\nSimilarly for the min. \n\nSo for each i, compute max_outside = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]) \n\nmin_outside = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1]) \n\nthen the difference is max_outside - min_outside. \n\nThe maximum of these is the value for case 2. \n\nFor step 4: \n\nFor each subsegment of length 2 (i and i+1), compute the outside's max and min, and the subsegment's max and min. \n\nThe outside's max is the maximum of prefix_max[i-1] and suffix_max[i+2]. \n\nThe outside's min is the minimum of prefix_min[i-1] and suffix_min[i+2]. \n\nThe subsegment's max is max(a[i], a[i+1]). \n\nThe subsegment's min is min(a[i], a[i+1]). \n\nThe total is (max_outside - min_outside) + (max_sub - min_sub). \n\nThe maximum of this over all i from 0 to n-2 is the value for case 3. \n\nThis requires O(n) time. \n\nThus, the total time per test case is O(n), which is acceptable. \n\nThis approach would handle the first example's case correctly. \n\nThe second example's case: \n\nThe optimal subsegment is length 3. \n\nBut according to this approach, it would not be considered. \n\nHmm, but perhaps the maximum is still captured in one of the cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subsegment of length 3 would have a higher value than the cases considered. \n\nBut without knowing the exact input, it's hard to say. \n\nBut given time constraints, this approach is the best I can think of. \n\nSo now, to write the code for program1.py. \n\nFirst, for each test case: \n\nRead n and the array a. \n\nCompute prefix_max, prefix_min, suffix_max, suffix_min. \n\nCompute global_max and global_min. \n\nThen compute the three cases. \n\nCase 1: \n\nmax_case1 = max( (max_sub - min_sub) for all i in 0..n-1 ) \n\nwhere max_sub is max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]) \n\nmin_sub is min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1]) \n\nCase 2: \n\nmax_case2 = max( (max_outside - min_outside) for all i in 0..n-1 ) \n\nwhere max_outside is max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1]) \n\nmin_outside is min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1]) \n\nCase3: \n\nmax_case3 = max over i from 0 to n-2 of: \n\nmax_outside = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+2]) \n\nmin_outside = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+2]) \n\nmax_sub = max(a[i], a[i+1]) \n\nmin_sub = min(a[i], a[i+1]) \n\ntotal = (max_outside -

Clone any array (cost 1). \n\n2. Swap any two elements from any two copies (cost 1 per swap). \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal number of operations. \n\nThe code provided has a loop over the test cases, and for each, it reads the array, computes n and the frequency of the most common element m. \n\nThe initial ans is n - m. \n\nThen there is a while loop that runs while m <n. \n\nThe code is incomplete. \n\nThe note says that in the second example, the answer is 6. \n\nThe approach seems to be: \n\nThe minimal number of operations is (n - m) + (number of clones needed). \n\nWait, the initial ans is n - m, which is the number of elements to change. \n\nBut since we can swap elements between copies, perhaps the minimal operations is the number of clones needed plus the number of swaps. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal operations is the number of clones plus the number of swaps. \n\nThe problem requires to find the minimal number of operations. \n\nThe operations are: \n\nEach clone costs 1. \n\nEach swap costs 1. \n\nThe process is: \n\nInitially, there is one array. \n\nEach clone increases the number of arrays by 1. \n\nEach swap can exchange two elements from any two arrays. \n\nThe goal is to have at least one array with all elements equal. \n\nThe minimal steps: \n\nThe key is to find the minimal number of clones and swaps needed. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to choose the most frequent element, say x with count m. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is (number of clones) + (number of swaps). \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (n - m), since each swap can move one element to the desired array. \n\nBut how to compute the minimal number of clones. \n\nThe minimal number of clones is the number of copies needed to have enough elements of x. \n\nSuppose we have k copies. \n\nThe total number of x's across all copies is m * k. \n\nWe need at least one copy to have all n elements as x. \n\nSo, the number of x's in all copies must be at least n. \n\nThus, m * k >= n \u2192 k >= ceil(n/m). \n\nThe number of clones needed is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\nBecause initially there is 1 copy. \n\nThe number of swaps needed is (n - m) * (number of copies needed) ? \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nBecause: \n\n- The number of clones is (ceil(n/m) -1). \n\n- The number of swaps is (n - m). \n\nBecause each non-x element in the target array must be replaced by an x from another copy. \n\nEach swap can move one x into the target array. \n\nThus, the total is (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m). \n\nBut let's see the example. \n\nSecond example: \n\nThe array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. \n\nThe most frequent element is 0 and 3, both with count 2. \n\nWait, the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0]. \n\nThe counts are: \n\n0: 2 \n\n1:1 \n\n3:2 \n\n7:1 \n\nSo the maximum is 2. \n\nn=6. \n\nceil(6/2) =3. \n\nSo clones needed: 3-1=2. \n\nSwaps needed: 6-2=4. \n\nTotal 2+4=6, which matches the example. \n\nYes! \n\nSo the formula is: \n\nans = (ceil(n/m) -1) + (n - m) \n\nBut wait, the initial ans in the code is n -m. \n\nThe while loop is probably trying to compute ceil(n/m). \n\nWait, the code has: \n\nm = max(Counter(li).values()) \n\nans =n -m \n\nwhile(m <n): \n\n    # TODO \n\nThe loop is while m <n. \n\nPerhaps the loop is trying to compute the number of clones needed. \n\nThe number of clones needed is ceil(n/m) -1. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nAlternatively, the number of clones needed is (n-1)//m. \n\nBecause ceil(n/m) = (n +m-1)//m \n\nThus, ceil(n/m) -1 = (n +m-1)//m -1 = (n-1)//m \n\nSo the number of clones is (n-1)//m \n\nThus, the total operations is (n-1)//m + (n -m) \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIn the example, n=6, m=2. \n\n(n-1)//m =5//2=2. \n\n(n -m)=4. \n\nTotal 2+4=6. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: \n\nIf m =n, then (n-1)//m =0, and (n-m)=0 \u2192 total 0. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: \n\nn=5, m=3 \u2192 ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 clones needed 1. \n\nTotal 1 + (5-3)=3. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the formula is correct. \n\nSo the code should compute: \n\nk = (n-1) // m \n\nans = k + (n -m) \n\nThus, the missing code in program2.py is to compute this. \n\nThe while loop is not needed. \n\nThe code currently has: \n\nfrom collections import Counter \n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    n=len(li:=li.split()); \n\n    m = max(Counter(li).values()) \n\n    ans =n-m \n\n    while(m <n): \n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\n    print(ans) \n\nThe while loop is unnecessary. \n\nThe correct code should compute k = (n-1)//m \n\nans = (n-1)//m + (n -m) \n\nThus, the missing code is to replace the while loop with this calculation. \n\nBut the code currently has a while loop. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to compute the number of clones needed. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be fixed by replacing the while loop with the correct formula. \n\nThus, the completion for program2.py is to replace the while loop with the calculation of k and ans. \n\nThe code should be: \n\nfrom collections import Counter \n\nfor li in[*open(0)][2::2]: \n\n    n=len(li:=li.split()); \n\n    m = max(Counter(li).values()) \n\n    ans = ( (n-1) // m ) + (n - m) \n\n    print(ans) \n\nBut the original code has a while loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the while loop is trying to compute the number of clones needed. \n\nWait, the initial ans is n-m. \n\nThe while loop is while m <n: \n\nPerhaps inside the loop, they increment the number of clones and update m. \n\nWait, but m is the maximum count of any element. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal number of clones needed to get enough copies of the most frequent element. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the correct completion is to replace the while loop with the formula. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2.py is to compute ans as ( (n-1)//m ) + (n -m) \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nans = ( (n-1) // m ) + (n - m) \n\nSo the completion for program2 is to replace the while loop with this line. \n\nNow, program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of cells that can be left dirty such that the robot doesn't malfunction. \n\nThe robot starts at (1,1), which is clean. \n\nThe robot will always choose the closest dirty cell. \n\nIf there are multiple closest cells, it malfunctions. \n\nWe can clean some cells before launching the robot to ensure that the robot never has a choice between multiple closest cells. \n\nThe goal is to maximize the number of dirty cells left. \n\nThe code provided has a DP approach. \n\nThe code reads the grid, and for each position, it tries to compute the maximum number of cells that can be left dirty. \n\nThe current code has a DP array, and for each position, it's trying to compute the maximum possible. \n\nThe incomplete part is in the else clause of the code. \n\nThe code is: \n\ndef solve(): \n\n    N = int(input()) \n\n    G = [[int(x) for x in input()] + [0] for _ in range(2)] \n\n    dp = [[0] * 2  for _ in range(N + 1)] \n\n    for j in range(2): \n\n        dp[N - 1][j] = G[1 - j][N - 1] \n\n    for i in range(N - 2, -1, -1): \n\n        for j in range(2): \n\n            dp[i][j] = G[j][i + 1] + dp[i + 1][j]   # can always ignore row 1 - j and proceed right \n\n            if G[1 - j][i]: \n\n                if G[j][i + 1]: \n\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + G[1 - j][i + 1] + G[1 - j][i + 2] + dp[i + 2][1 - j]) \n\n                else: \n\n                    # TODO: Your code here \n\n    print(dp[0][0]) \n\n    return \n\nThe problem is to fill in the else clause. \n\nThe DP approach is trying to track the maximum number of dirty cells that can be left. \n\nThe current code's logic is: \n\nFor each position (i,j), the DP[i][j] represents the maximum number of dirty cells that can be left starting from column i, row j. \n\nThe base case is the last column (N-1). \n\nThe transition for the current cell (i,j) considers two possibilities: \n\n1. Proceed to the right (i+1,j), adding the current cell's dirty status (G[j][i+1] is 1 if dirty). \n\n2. If the cell in the other row (1-j) at column i is dirty, then there might be a path that goes up/down. \n\nThe first case is handled by the initial assignment. \n\nThe second case is when the other row's current column is dirty. \n\nIf the current row's next cell (i+1,j) is dirty, then the robot might have to choose between moving right or down/up. \n\nThe code's current logic for when G[j][i+1] is true (i.e., the current row's next cell is dirty) is to consider taking the other row's next two cells. \n\nThe else clause is when G[j][i+1] is false. \n\nIn this case, the robot cannot move right in the current row, so it must move to the other row's current cell. \n\nThus, the path would be to take the current cell (G[1-j][i] is dirty), then proceed to the next columns in the other row. \n\nSo the contribution would be 1 (for the current cell) plus the DP value from the next column in the other row. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\ndp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j]) \n\nWait, but also need to account for the current cell's dirty status. \n\nWait, the current cell (i, 1-j) is dirty (since G[1-j][i] is true). \n\nSo the robot must clean this cell. \n\nThus, the contribution is 1 (for this cell) plus the DP[i+1][1-j]. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nelse: \n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j]) \n\nBut also, the current cell's dirty status is counted. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\ndp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j]) \n\nSo the completion for program3 is to add this line in the else clause. \n\nPutting it all together: \n\nThe three completions are: \n\nprogram1: the code I wrote earlier. \n\nprogram2: replace the while loop with ans = ( (n-1)//m ) + (n -m) \n\nprogram3: add the line in the else clause. \n\nNow, formatting the answer as JSON. \n\nThe user requires the output to be a JSON with the three completions. \n\nThe code for program1 is the code I wrote earlier, but since the user says to output only the missing code, not the entire program. \n\nWait, the user says: \n\n\"Output only the missing code so that 'python3 program1.py | program2.py | program3.py' runs correctly. Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nThus, for each program, we need to output the missing lines. \n\nFor program1.py: \n\nThe missing code is the code inside the for loop. \n\nThe original code has: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe completion is the entire block of code I wrote earlier. \n\nBut the user wants only the missing code. \n\nThus, the completion for program1 is the code that fills the for loop. \n\nSimilarly for the other programs. \n\nThus, the JSON should have the missing code for each program. \n\nFor program1: \n\nThe missing code is the entire block inside the for loop. \n\nThe code I wrote earlier is the completion. \n\nFor program2: \n\nThe missing code is the replacement of the while loop with the calculation of ans. \n\nThe original code has: \n\nwhile(m <n): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe completion is to remove the while loop and compute ans as ( (n-1)//m ) + (n -m). \n\nThus, the completion is to replace the while loop with the line: \n\nans = ( (n-1) // m ) + (n - m) \n\nBut the code currently has the while loop. \n\nThus, the missing code is to replace the while loop with that line. \n\nBut the user wants the missing code to be filled in. \n\nThe original code has the while loop, so the completion is to replace the while loop with the line. \n\nThus, the completion for program2 is to replace the while loop with the line. \n\nBut the user wants the missing code, so the code to fill in the TODO is to compute ans as ( (n-1)//m ) + (n -m). \n\nThus, the completion for program2 is to set ans to that value. \n\nThe code currently has ans =n-m, then the while loop. \n\nThus, the missing code is to replace the while loop with the line ans = ... \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output the missing code. \n\nThe code for program2 has the line: \n\nans =n-m \n\nwhile(m <n): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe completion is to replace the while loop with the line ans = ( (n-1)//m ) + (n -m) \n\nBut the user wants the missing code to be filled in. \n\nThe missing code is the line that computes ans correctly. \n\nThus, the completion for program2 is to replace the while loop with the line ans = ( (n-1)//m ) + (n -m) \n\nThus, the missing code is the line ans = ... \n\nFor program3: \n\nThe missing code is the line inside the else clause. \n\nThe code has: \n\nelse: \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe completion is: \n\ndp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i+1][1-j]) \n\nThus, the missing code is that line. \n\nThus, the JSON should be: \n\n{ \n\n\"program1\": \"    # code for reading n and a \\n    # compute prefix and suffix arrays \\n    # compute cases 1,2,3 and output the max\", \n\nWait, but the user wants the actual code. \n\nThe exact code for program1 is the code I wrote earlier. \n\nBut the user wants the missing code. \n\nThe original program1 has: \n\nfor _ in range(int(input())): \n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe completion is the entire block of code I wrote earlier. \n\nThus, the missing code for program1 is the entire block inside the for loop. \n\nSimilarly for the others. \n\nThus, the JSON should have the missing code for each program. \n\nThe final answer is: \n\n{\n\"program1\": \"\"\"\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    prefix_max = [0]*n\n    prefix_min = [0]*n\n    prefix_max[0] = a[0]\n    prefix_min[0] = a[0]\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n    suffix_max = [0]*n\n    suffix_min = [0]*n\n    suffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\n    suffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\n    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], a[i])\n    global_max = prefix_max[-1]\n    global_min = prefix_min[-1]\n    max_case1 = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if i ==0:\n            max_sub = suffix_max[1]\n            min_sub = suffix_min[1]\n        elif i ==n-1:\n            max_sub = prefix_max[n-2]\n            min_sub = prefix_min[n-2]\n        else:\n            max_sub = max(prefix_max[i-1], suffix_max[i+1])\n            min_sub = min(prefix_min[i-1], suffix_min[i+1])\n        current = max_sub -
