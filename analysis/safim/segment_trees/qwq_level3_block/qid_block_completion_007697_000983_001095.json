Wait, actually, the sum of x and y for diagonals going one way, and the difference for the other. Looking at the code, they have two dictionaries, dic_l and dic_r. The code is trying to accumulate the sum for each diagonal. For each cell (x,y), they check if x+y is in dic_l. If not, they set it to the cell's value. Else, they have a TODO. Oh right, so the TODO is probably adding the current cell's value to the existing sum. Because for each diagonal, the sum should accumulate all the cells along it. So the line should be dic_l[x+y] += check[x][y]. Same for the other dictionary. Wait, the code for dic_r has the same structure.",

Looking at the code's structure, for each i, they compute p as the total moves needed. The first loop is for the elements after i (a[i+1:]). The code does d = ceil((t+1)/k), then t = k*d, p +=d. Not sure what this is doing. Maybe trying to compute the required steps for the elements after i to be increasing? Wait, perhaps the idea is to set b_i to some value, and then compute the required steps for the subsequent elements. Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to model the constraints between elements. Alternatively, the problem requires that each b_j must be strictly greater than all previous elements. Wait, no, strictly greater than the previous one. Because \"every element is strictly greater than every element before it\" implies that each b_{j} > b_{j-1}. So it's a strictly increasing sequence.

The minimal |k_1| is 0 (since k_1 can be 0, but then the next term must be greater than 0. Wait, but if k_1 is 0, then the next term must be positive.

The minimal k_i is ceil( (prev +1)/a_i ), since (prev +1) is the smallest integer greater than prev. Wait, let's see:\n\nprev =5, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(6/3)=2 \u2192 correct. prev=4, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 2*3=6>4 \u2192 yes. prev=3, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(4/3)=2 \u2192 2*3=6>3 \u2192 yes. \n\nprev=2, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(3/3)=1 \u2192 3>2 \u2192 yes.

For example, prev =-5, a_i=3. Then k_i can be 0 \u2192 0 >-5 \u2192 yes. So that's correct. Another example: prev =-5, a_i=3. k_i=0 \u2192 total +=0. prev becomes 0. Next element, say a_{i+1}=2. prev is 0 \u2192 required is 1 \u2192 ceil(1/2)=1 \u2192 k=1 \u2192 total +=1. prev becomes 2. This seems okay. But what if prev is negative and a_i is such that even k_i=0 is not enough? Wait, no. Because if prev is negative, then 0 is greater than prev. So the minimal k_i is 0. So this approach should work. Now, the problem is to implement this. But how does this relate to the given code?",

The minimal steps would be the absolute value of k_j. Wait, but how to compute this. The minimal steps would be the minimal |k_j| such that k_j * a_j < t. \n\nThe best k_j is the largest possible integer less than t/a_j. The minimal |k_j| is achieved when k_j is as close to zero as possible. For example, if t is positive (0 in this case), then the maximal k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ) \u2192 floor(-1/a_j). Since a_j is positive, this is -1 if a_j is 1, or 0 if a_j>1. Wait, let's see:\n\nSuppose a_j is 3, t is 0. Then (t-1)/a_j = -1/3 \u2192 floor is -1. So k_j can be -1 \u2192 -3 <0 \u2192 yes. The steps are |k_j|=1. Alternatively, k_j could be 0 \u2192 0 is not less than 0 \u2192 no. So the minimal steps is 1. Another example: a_j=2, t=0 \u2192 (t-1)/a_j = -0.5 \u2192 floor is -1. \n\nk_j =-1 \u2192 -2 <0 \u2192 steps 1. \n\nAlternatively, k_j =-2 \u2192 -4 <0 \u2192 steps 2 \u2192 worse. So the minimal is 1. So the formula for k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ). The steps added are |k_j|. The new t is k_j * a_j.

So the final answers are:\n\nprogram1: the missing line is the else clause for dic_l:\n\nelse: dic_l[x + y] += check[x][y]\n\nprogram2: the missing code in the before loop is: d = (t -1) // k \n\np += abs(d) t = d * k \n\nprogram3: the missing code is to fill the ijs list with the sorted cells by age:\n\ncells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2]) But in the code's current structure, the loop over i and j is present but not used. So the correct code would be to first collect the cells, sort them, then assign to ijs. Thus, the code for program3's missing part is:\n\ncells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2]) But since the code's current loop is iterating over i and j, perhaps the code should be written as:\n\n# the loop over i and j is not needed for this part. # the correct code is to first collect all cells and sort them. Thus, the missing code for program3 is the code to fill the ijs list with the sorted coordinates.

No, the code for program3's missing part is the loop over i and j is not needed. The code should first collect all cells, sort them, then fill the ijs list.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is to find the maximum sum a bishop can attack by placing it on any cell. The approach here seems to involve precomputing sums for diagonals. The bishop's attack covers all four diagonals, but the key is that each diagonal can be identified by x+y (for one set) and y-x (for the other). Wait, actually, the sum of x and y for diagonals going one way, and the difference for the other. \n\nLooking at the code, they have two dictionaries, dic_l and dic_r. The code is trying to accumulate the sum for each diagonal. For each cell (x,y), they check if x+y is in dic_l. If not, they set it to the cell's value. Else, they have a TODO. Oh right, so the TODO is probably adding the current cell's value to the existing sum. Because for each diagonal, the sum should accumulate all the cells along it. So the line should be dic_l[x+y] += check[x][y]. Same for the other dictionary. \n\nWait, the code for dic_r has the same structure. The initial check for y-x not in dic_r, then set to check[x][y], else add. So the missing part for the else clause in dic_l is adding the current cell's value. So the first TODO in program1 is to replace the else block with adding to the existing sum. \n\nSo the code for the first program's missing part is:\n\nelse:\n    dic_l[x + y] += check[x][y]\n\nSame for the dic_r part, but that part is already handled correctly? Wait, looking at the code for dic_r:\n\nif y-x not in dic_r:\n    dic_r[y-x] = check[x][y]\nelse:\n    dic_r[y-x] += check[x][y]\n\nSo that part is okay. So the only missing line is in the dic_l's else clause. So the first program's missing code is that line.\n\nMoving on to program2.py. The problem is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. The moves are adding or subtracting a_i to b_i each step. Wait, the problem says each move is choosing an i and add or subtract a_i to b_i. So each move increments or decrements b_i by a_i. The goal is to make the array b strictly increasing with minimal moves.\n\nHmm, the code given is trying to loop through each position i, and compute something. Let me think. The approach here might be similar to the greedy approach for making an array non-decreasing with minimal increments, but here the operations are different. \n\nThe code's variables: c is the minimum moves so far. The loop is over each i, perhaps considering the i-th element as a pivot? The inner loops are for the elements after and before. \n\nLooking at the code's structure, for each i, they compute p as the total moves needed. The first loop is for the elements after i (a[i+1:]). The code does d = ceil((t+1)/k), then t = k*d, p +=d. Not sure what this is doing. Maybe trying to compute the required steps for the elements after i to be increasing? \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is to set b_i to some value, and then compute the required steps for the subsequent elements. Alternatively, maybe the code is trying to model the constraints between elements. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that each b_j must be strictly greater than all previous elements. Wait, no, strictly greater than the previous one. Because \"every element is strictly greater than every element before it\" implies that each b_{j} > b_{j-1}. So it's a strictly increasing sequence. \n\nThe minimal moves would involve setting each b_i such that b_i > b_{i-1}, with minimal steps. Since each move on b_i can add or subtract a_i any number of times, the problem is to find the minimal steps (number of operations) to reach such a sequence. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is similar to the problem where you have to adjust the array so that each element is at least the previous plus 1, but here the adjustments are constrained by the a_i's. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal steps required. Let's model the required b array. Let's denote the required b array as b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. The constraints are b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n. \n\nEach b_i can be written as initial 0 plus some multiple (could be negative) of a_i, since each move adds or subtracts a_i. So b_i = k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (could be positive or negative). Wait, no, each move is adding or subtracting a_i once. So the total for b_i is the sum of all the moves applied to it. So each move on i contributes +a_i or -a_i. So the total b_i is equal to the number of times you added a_i minus the number of times you subtracted a_i, multiplied by a_i. So b_i can be any integer of the form (add_count - subtract_count)*a_i. But since each move is a single addition or subtraction, the total moves for i is add_count + subtract_count. \n\nAlternatively, the total b_i can be written as (k_i)*a_i, where k_i is any integer (positive or negative), and the number of moves for i is |k_i|. Because each step contributes +1 or -1 to k_i. Wait, no. Each move on i is either adding a_i (so k_i increases by 1) or subtracting (k_i decreases by 1). So the total moves for i is the absolute value of the total steps taken, which is |k_i|. Because each step is a move. So the total moves is the sum over all |k_i|. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose for i, you add a_i three times and subtract once. Then the total b_i is (3-1)*a_i = 2a_i. The number of moves is 3+1 =4. So the total moves is the sum of the absolute values of the number of additions and subtractions. Wait, but that's equivalent to the total number of moves, which is the sum over all (number of additions + number of subtractions) for each i. \n\nAlternatively, the total moves for each i is the absolute value of (k_i), where k_i is the net number of additions minus subtractions? No, that's not right. Let me see: \n\nSuppose you have k_i = (add_count - subtract_count). Then the total moves for i is add_count + subtract_count. Which is equal to (k_i + subtract_count) + subtract_count = k_i + 2*subtract_count. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the total moves for i is the number of times you choose i, which is add_count + subtract_count. \n\nSo the problem is to choose for each i a value b_i = (add_i - subtract_i)*a_i, such that the sequence is strictly increasing, and the sum over (add_i + subtract_i) is minimized. \n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, since each b_i can be any integer, but the constraints are that b must be strictly increasing, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by greedily setting each b_i to the minimal possible value that satisfies the constraints, given the previous elements. \n\nWait, but how does the a_i factor into this? Because the b_i can be adjusted by multiples of a_i. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into variables. Let me think of the required b array. Let's denote the required b array as b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. The constraints are:\n\nb_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n.\n\nEach b_i can be written as b_i = k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (since each move adds or subtracts a_i, so the total is a multiple of a_i). Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each move adds or subtracts a_i, so the total change for b_i is (number of adds - number of subtracts) * a_i. So the total b_i is (k_i) * a_i, where k_i is any integer (positive or negative). The number of moves for i is (number of adds + number of subtracts) = |k_i + s| + |s|? Not sure. Wait, the number of moves for i is the total number of times you choose it, which is (adds + subtracts). Let's denote adds as x_i and subtracts as y_i. Then, the total moves for i is x_i + y_i, and b_i = (x_i - y_i)*a_i. \n\nWe need to choose x_i and y_i (non-negative integers) such that the sequence is strictly increasing, and the sum of (x_i + y_i) is minimized. \n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Maybe there's a way to model this as a dynamic programming problem, but with n up to 5000, that might not be feasible. \n\nLooking at the code provided, perhaps the approach is to iterate over each possible position as a starting point and compute the required steps. The code has a loop over i in the array, and for each i, it calculates the moves needed if the current element is the pivot. \n\nWait, the code's outer loop is for i in range(len(a)), which is from 0 to n-1. For each i, they compute p as the total moves. The first inner loop is over a[i+1:], which are the elements after i. The code does:\n\nfor k in a[i+1:]:\n    d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n    t = k*d\n    p +=d\n\nHmm, perhaps this is trying to compute the required steps for the elements after i. Let me think: \n\nSuppose that the current element's b_i is fixed, and then for the next elements, they must be at least b_i +1. But how does this relate to the a's? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to model the minimal steps required for the elements after i to form an increasing sequence given some constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute for each position i, the minimal steps required if we set b_i to some value, and then compute the required steps for the elements before and after. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to set b_i to a certain value, and then compute the required steps for the elements before and after. \n\nWait, the code's first loop for the elements after i (a[i+1:]):\n\nThe variable t starts at 0. For each k in a[i+1:], which is a_j for j>i, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps to make b_j >= previous +1. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose that the previous required value is t. Then, the current b_j must be at least t+1. Since b_j can be any multiple of a_j (since b_j = k_j * a_j), the minimal k_j such that k_j * a_j >= t+1. \n\nThe minimal k_j is ceil( (t+1)/a_j ), but since a_j is positive. \n\nWait, but the code uses math.ceil( (t+1)/k ), where k is the a_j. So d is the minimal number of steps (since k_j is d, so the required steps would be d, but perhaps the code is accumulating the sum of d's. \n\nWait, the code's variable p is accumulating d. So for each element after i, the required steps are d, which is the minimal k_j such that k_j * a_j >= t+1. \n\nThen, the new t becomes k_j * a_j, which is the minimal possible value for b_j. \n\nThis way, the sequence after i is built in a way that each subsequent b_j is the minimal possible value that is at least the previous +1. \n\nSimilarly, for the elements before i, the code has a loop over reversed(a[:i]). \n\nWait, the code's second loop is for the elements before i. The code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". \n\nSo the code's approach is, for each i, compute the minimal steps required if we set b_i to some value, and then compute the steps needed for the elements before and after. \n\nThe first part (after i) is handled, but the second part (before i) is missing. \n\nThe code's variable t is initialized to 0 again, and then loops over the elements before i in reverse order. \n\nWait, perhaps for the elements before i, we need to ensure that their b values are strictly increasing towards b_i. \n\nLet me think: \n\nSuppose we are considering the elements before i. Let's process them in reverse order (from i-1 down to 0). \n\nThe required condition is that b_{i-1} < b_i. \n\nBut how does this work? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the steps for the elements before i such that their b values form an increasing sequence up to the current b_i. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is to set b_i to some value, then compute the minimal steps for the elements after i to be increasing from that value, and the elements before to be increasing up to that value. \n\nBut how exactly?\n\nLet me think of the code's first part (after i):\n\nThe initial t is 0. Then for each element after i (starting from i+1 to end), the code computes the minimal k such that k * a_j >= t +1. The required b_j is k * a_j, and the steps added are k. Then t is set to k * a_j. \n\nWait, but the initial t is 0. So for the first element after i (j = i+1), the required b_j must be at least 0 +1 =1. So the minimal k is ceil(1/a_j). But since a_j is at least 1, so if a_j is 1, then k=1. \n\nBut this seems to be building the sequence after i such that each subsequent b_j is the minimal possible value that is at least previous +1. \n\nSimilarly, for the elements before i, we need to ensure that their b values are strictly increasing up to b_i. \n\nSo for the elements before i, we process them in reverse order (from i-1 down to 0). \n\nLet me think: \n\nSuppose the current b_i is set to some value. Let's say the required b_{i-1} must be less than b_i. \n\nBut how do we model this? \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach for the elements before i is similar but in reverse. \n\nSuppose that the current required value for the previous element (before the current one in the reversed loop) must be less than the next one. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose we process the elements before i in reverse order (starting from i-1, then i-2, etc). \n\nLet me denote the elements as a_0, a_1, ..., a_{i-1}, a_i, a_{i+1}, ... \n\nProcessing the elements before i in reverse order (starting from a_{i-1}, then a_{i-2}, etc). \n\nThe initial t for the before loop is 0? Or perhaps the current b_i's value? \n\nWait, in the code's first part (after i), the initial t is 0, but that might not be correct. Wait, perhaps the code is assuming that the b_i is set to some value, but in the code's current structure, it's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps for the entire array given that the b_i is set to the minimal possible value given the constraints from both sides. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is to consider each i as the point where the sequence is \"fixed\" and then compute the minimal steps required for the elements before and after. \n\nWait, the code's variable t in the first loop (after i) starts at 0. But that might not be correct. Because the b_i's value must be greater than the previous elements. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is flawed, but given the problem's constraints, I need to fix the missing part. \n\nLooking at the code's second loop for the elements before i:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe variable t is initialized to 0 again. \n\nThe code for the after loop was:\n\nfor k in a[i+1:]:\n    d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n    t = k*d\n    p +=d\n\nSo for the before loop, perhaps the code needs to do something similar but in reverse. \n\nThe idea is that for the elements before i, their b values must be strictly increasing up to b_i. \n\nSuppose that the current b_i is set to some value. Let's say that the previous elements must be less than b_i. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach for the before loop is to start from the end (i-1) and work backward, ensuring that each b_j is less than the next one. \n\nWait, let's think of the elements before i as needing to form an increasing sequence up to the current b_i. \n\nSuppose that the current b_i is set to some value. Let's say that the previous element (i-1) must be less than b_i. \n\nBut how do we compute the steps for the elements before i? \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is similar to the after loop but in reverse. \n\nSuppose that for the elements before i, we process them in reverse order (from i-1 down to 0). \n\nLet me denote the current element as a_j (where j < i). \n\nThe required b_j must be less than the next element (which is either the next in the sequence or the current b_i). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's before loop is trying to compute the steps needed for the elements before i to form an increasing sequence up to the current b_i. \n\nLet me think of the before loop:\n\nInitially, the required next value (the one after j) is the current b_j's next element. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's before loop starts with the current b_i's value. \n\nWait, in the after loop, the initial t is 0, but that might not be correct. Maybe the code is wrong here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is to set the b_i to the minimal possible value given the constraints from both sides, and then compute the steps. \n\nAlternatively, the code's before loop should start with the current b_i's value and work backward. \n\nWait, let's think of the before loop:\n\nSuppose that the current b_i is set to some value. The elements before must form an increasing sequence up to that value. \n\nSo for the elements before i (processed in reverse order), each element's b_j must be less than the next one (which is the next in the sequence, or the current b_i). \n\nLet me think of the elements before i as j = i-1, i-2, ..., 0. \n\nThe first element to process is j = i-1. \n\nThe required b_{i-1} must be less than b_i. \n\nThe minimal steps for b_{i-1} would be to set it to the maximum possible value that is less than b_i, but also considering the a_{i-1} steps. \n\nAlternatively, the code's before loop should start with the current b_i's value as the initial t, and then for each previous element, compute the required steps to ensure that their b_j is less than the next one. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's before loop should be similar to the after loop but in reverse. \n\nIn the after loop, the code starts with t=0, and for each next element, the required b_j must be at least t+1. \n\nIn the before loop, perhaps the code starts with t = current b_i's value (but how?), and for each previous element, the required b_j must be less than the next one (which is the previous t). \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose that the after loop's t is the value of b_i (since the after loop builds up to the elements after i). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is that the after loop computes the minimal steps for the elements after i, assuming that the current b_i is 0. But that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps for the entire array given that the b_i is set to 0, but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to consider each i as the position where the sequence is \"fixed\" and the minimal steps are computed for the elements before and after. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's variable t in the after loop is the required minimal value for the next element. \n\nWait, in the after loop, the first element after i (j = i+1) must be at least t+1 (where t starts at 0). So the minimal b_j is ceil( (0+1)/a_j ) * a_j. \n\nThen, the next element (j = i+2) must be at least (previous b_j) +1. \n\nSo the after loop builds the minimal possible sequence starting from 0, but that might not be correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal steps for the entire array if we set b_i to 0, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute for each i the minimal steps required if the b_i is set to the minimal possible value given the constraints from the previous elements and the next elements. \n\nThis is getting a bit too tangled. Let me look at the code's structure again. \n\nThe code for the after loop:\n\nfor k in a[i+1:]:\n    d = math.ceil( (t+1)/k )\n    t = k*d\n    p +=d\n\nSo for each element after i, the required b_j must be at least t+1. The minimal k_j (number of steps?) is ceil( (t+1)/k ), but k here is the a_j. \n\nWait, the variable k here is a_j. So the required b_j is k_j * a_j >= t+1. The minimal k_j is ceil( (t+1)/a_j ), so d is that value. \n\nThe steps added are d, which is the number of moves (since each step is adding a_j once, so to reach k_j * a_j, you need k_j steps of adding. Wait, but if k_j is positive, then the steps would be k_j (since starting from 0, adding a_j k_j times gives k_j * a_j). \n\nWait, but the initial b_j can be anything. The problem allows adding or subtracting. So perhaps the minimal steps to reach a certain value is the absolute value of the required k_j. \n\nWait, but in this code's approach, they are assuming that the minimal steps are the k_j (the number of additions needed to reach the required value). \n\nBut if the required value is positive, then you can just add a_j k_j times. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is assuming that all the required b values are non-negative, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is to compute the minimal steps required to make the sequence strictly increasing, assuming that each b_i is set to the minimal possible value given the previous elements. \n\nIn that case, the after loop is building the minimal possible sequence starting from 0, but that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute for each i the minimal steps required if the b_i is set to 0, and then the elements before and after are adjusted accordingly. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThe problem is that the code's before loop is missing. Let's think of what the before loop should do. \n\nSuppose that after processing the elements after i, the current b_i must be less than the first element after i's b value. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's before loop should start with the current b_i's value (which is the t from the after loop?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the before loop needs to process the elements before i in reverse order, ensuring that each b_j is less than the next one. \n\nLet me think of the before loop:\n\nSuppose that the current b_i is set to some value. The elements before must form an increasing sequence up to that value. \n\nProcessing the elements before i in reverse order (from i-1 down to 0). \n\nLet's denote the current required value as t, which starts as the value of b_i. \n\nFor each element j (starting from i-1, then i-2, etc), the required b_j must be less than the next element (which is the previous t). \n\nWait, the next element in the sequence is the one after j, which is j+1. \n\nWait, the elements before i are j = 0 to i-1. \n\nProcessing in reverse order (starting from j = i-1, then i-2, etc). \n\nThe first element to process is j = i-1. \n\nThe required b_j must be less than the next element (which is b_i). \n\nThe minimal steps to achieve this would be to set b_j to the maximum possible value less than b_i, but also considering the a_j. \n\nAlternatively, the required b_j must be less than the next value (which is the current t, initially set to b_i). \n\nSo for each j in reversed(a[:i]):\n\nWe need to choose b_j such that b_j < t (the next value). \n\nThe minimal steps to reach such a b_j would be to set it to the maximum possible value less than t, which is floor( (t-1)/a_j ) * a_j. \n\nWait, but how does that translate into steps? \n\nAlternatively, the required b_j must be less than t. The maximum possible value is (k_j)*a_j < t. The maximum k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ). \n\nThe minimal steps would be the absolute value of k_j (if k_j is positive) or the steps needed to reach that value. \n\nWait, but the steps are the number of additions or subtractions. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the code's before loop should be similar to the after loop but in reverse, with the condition that the current b_j must be less than the next value (t). \n\nSo for the before loop:\n\nt starts as the value of the next element (which is the current b_i's value, which is the t from the after loop? Or perhaps the after loop's t is the value of the last element after i, and the before loop starts with the current b_i's value). \n\nWait, perhaps the code's after loop's t is the value of the last element after i. \n\nWait, in the after loop, the t is being updated to k*d each time. So after processing all elements after i, the final t is the value of the last element's b. \n\nThen, the current b_i must be less than this t. \n\nBut how is that handled? \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute the minimal steps for the elements after i assuming that the current b_i is 0, and then the elements before must be less than 0. \n\nBut that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's before loop should start with the current b_i's value (which is 0?), and then for each previous element, compute the steps needed to ensure that their b_j is less than the next one. \n\nWait, let's think of the before loop's code. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe variable t is initialized to 0 again. \n\nWait, perhaps the before loop should start with the current b_i's value (which is the t from the after loop?), but in the code's current structure, the after loop's t is not saved. \n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for the correct approach for the problem. \n\nThe problem requires that the array b is strictly increasing. Each b_i can be any integer, but each step is adding or subtracting a_i. The minimal steps are the sum of the absolute values of the number of times you add or subtract for each element. \n\nWait, the total steps for each element is the number of times you choose it, which is (number of adds + number of subtracts). \n\nThe problem is to choose for each element a value b_i such that the sequence is strictly increasing, and the total steps (sum over (adds + subtracts) for each element) is minimized. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by greedily setting each b_i to the minimal possible value given the previous elements. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as follows. Let's denote the required b array as b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. \n\nThe constraints are:\n\nb_1 < b_2 < ... < b_n. \n\nEach b_i can be any integer, but the cost for b_i is the minimal number of steps to reach it from 0, which is |k_i| where k_i is the number of times you added minus subtracted (since each step is either +a_i or -a_i, so the total is (adds - subtracts)*a_i = b_i. The total steps for i is (adds + subtracts) = (adds - subtracts) + 2*subtract = |k_i| + 2*min(adds, subtracts). Wait, no. \n\nWait, the total steps for i is adds + subtracts. Let's denote adds as x, subtracts as y. Then, b_i = (x - y)*a_i. The total steps is x + y. \n\nWe need to minimize the sum over all (x + y) for each i, given that the sequence is strictly increasing. \n\nThis seems challenging. \n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for each i, the minimal steps to reach a certain b_i is ceil( |b_i| / a_i ), but that's not exactly right. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps to reach a desired b_i is the minimal number of moves (each move is \u00b1a_i) to reach that value. The minimal steps would be |b_i| / a_i rounded up, but only if the direction is correct. \n\nWait, the minimal steps to reach b_i is exactly |b_i| / a_i if b_i is a multiple of a_i. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, no, because each step adds or subtracts a_i. So the possible b_i must be multiples of a_i. \n\nAh! Wait a second. Because each move adds or subtracts a_i, the total b_i must be a multiple of a_i. So b_i = k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (can be positive or negative). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nk_1 * a_1 < k_2 * a_2 < ... < k_n * a_n,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nAh! That's a crucial insight. \n\nSo the problem is now to choose integers k_i such that the sequence k_1 a_1, k_2 a_2, ..., k_n a_n is strictly increasing, and the sum of |k_i| is as small as possible. \n\nThis is a key simplification. \n\nNow, how to model this? \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. \n\nWe need to choose k_i such that for all i < j, k_i a_i < k_j a_j. \n\nThe goal is to minimize the sum of |k_i|. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this greedily. \n\nLet me think of the sequence step by step. \n\nStart with k_1. The minimal |k_1| is 0 (since k_1 can be 0, but then the next term must be greater than 0. \n\nWait, but if k_1 is 0, then the next term must be positive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by setting each k_i as small as possible. \n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each position i, we track the minimal sum up to i given the current value of b_i. \n\nBut with n up to 5000, this might be too slow. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to compute the minimal steps by considering each element in sequence and adjusting the k_i based on the previous terms. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nInitialize k_1 to 0. \n\nThen for each subsequent element i from 2 to n:\n\nWe need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > previous term (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}).\n\nThe minimal |k_i| is desired. \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > previous. \n\nBut since k_i can be negative or positive, but we want minimal |k_i|, perhaps the best is to choose the smallest possible k_i (in absolute terms) that satisfies the inequality. \n\nWait, but the previous term is k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. \n\nSuppose the previous term is P. \n\nWe need k_i * a_i > P. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be achieved by the smallest k_i (in absolute terms) such that this holds. \n\nBut k_i can be positive or negative. \n\nWait, but if a_i is positive (as per the input constraints), then to have k_i * a_i > P, the sign of k_i depends on P. \n\nFor example, if P is negative, then even a small positive k_i could work. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by greedily choosing the smallest possible k_i such that the sequence is increasing. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nStart with k_1 = 0. \n\nThen for each i from 2 to n:\n\nWe need to choose the minimal possible k_i (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > previous term. \n\nThe previous term is the value of the previous element's b_{i-1} = k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. \n\nLet me denote the previous value as prev. \n\nWe need to find the minimal |k_i| such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal k_i can be either the smallest integer greater than prev / a_i, or the largest integer less than prev / a_i but still allows the next term to be larger. \n\nWait, let's compute the minimal k_i. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal k_i is ceil( (prev + 1)/a_i ). \n\nWait, because (prev +1) is the minimal value that is larger than prev. \n\nSo k_i must be at least ceil( (prev +1)/a_i ). \n\nBut this gives the minimal k_i in the positive direction. \n\nAlternatively, if a_i is large, maybe a negative k_i could be better? \n\nWait, no. Because if a_i is positive, then a negative k_i would give a negative value, which might not be larger than the previous term. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nSo the minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer (could be positive or negative) that satisfies the inequality. \n\nBut how to find that? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal |k_i| is achieved when k_i is as small as possible. \n\nLet me think of the minimal possible k_i. \n\nSuppose prev is the previous value. \n\nWe need k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is achieved when k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) satisfying this. \n\nThe minimal possible k_i can be either ceil( (prev +1)/a_i ), or if a_i is large enough, maybe a negative k_i could work if prev is negative. \n\nWait, for example, if prev is -5 and a_i is 3. \n\nThen k_i can be 0 (0*3 =0 >-5 \u2192 yes. So k_i=0 is acceptable. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal |k_i| is 0. \n\nAh! So in this case, the minimal k_i is 0. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the smallest possible integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize prev =0 (since k_1 can be 0). \n\nFor each i from 2 to n:\n\nFind the minimal possible k_i (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer (could be negative, zero, or positive) that satisfies this. \n\nOnce k_i is chosen, the new prev is k_i * a_i. \n\nThe total steps are the sum of |k_i| for all i. \n\nThe problem is to choose these k_i's such that the total is minimized. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nLet me think of the possible candidates for k_i. \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe possible candidates are:\n\n- The smallest integer greater than prev / a_i. \n\n- The largest integer less than prev / a_i but still allows the product to be larger than prev. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the ceiling of (prev +1)/a_i. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose prev =5, a_i=3. \n\nThen the minimal k_i is 2 (2*3=6>5). \n\nWhich is ceil( (5+1)/3 ) = 2. \n\nAnother example: prev =-5, a_i=3. \n\nThen any k_i >=0 would work. The minimal is 0. \n\nWhich is ceil( (-5+1)/3 ) = ceil(-4/3) = -1. But that gives k_i =-1 \u2192 -3 which is not >-5. \n\nHmm, so that formula doesn't work in this case. \n\nAh, right. So the formula ceil( (prev +1)/a_i ) works only when a_i is positive. \n\nWait, but in the case where prev is negative, the minimal k_i could be zero. \n\nSo the formula needs to be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nThe minimal possible k_i can be found by considering the following:\n\nIf prev is negative, then k_i can be zero (if 0 > prev), which is possible. \n\nIf prev is negative and a_i is positive, then k_i can be zero, which gives 0>prev. \n\nSo in that case, the minimal k_i is zero. \n\nIf prev is negative and a_i is negative (but the problem states a_i are positive), so we can ignore that. \n\nSo for a_i positive:\n\nCase 1: prev is negative. \n\nThen the minimal k_i is 0 (since 0 > prev). \n\nCase 2: prev is non-negative. \n\nThen we need k_i * a_i > prev \u2192 k_i > prev/a_i. \n\nThe minimal k_i is ceil( (prev +1)/a_i ), since (prev +1) is the smallest integer greater than prev. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev =5, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(6/3)=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nprev=4, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(5/3)=2 \u2192 2*3=6>4 \u2192 yes. \n\nprev=3, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(4/3)=2 \u2192 2*3=6>3 \u2192 yes. \n\nprev=2, a_i=3 \u2192 ceil(3/3)=1 \u2192 3>2 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo that works. \n\nSo the formula for k_i when prev is non-negative is ceil( (prev +1)/a_i ). \n\nWhen prev is negative, k_i can be zero. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize prev =0 (since k_1 can be zero). \n\ntotal =0 \n\nfor i from 2 to n:\n\n    if prev <0:\n\n        k_i =0 \n\n    else:\n\n        required = prev +1 \n\n        k_i = ceil( required / a_i )\n\n    total += abs(k_i)\n\n    prev = k_i * a_i \n\nWait, but what about when prev is negative and a_i is positive? \n\nFor example, prev =-5, a_i=3. \n\nThen k_i can be 0 \u2192 0 >-5 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nAnother example: prev =-5, a_i=3. \n\nk_i=0 \u2192 total +=0. \n\nprev becomes 0. \n\nNext element, say a_{i+1}=2. \n\nprev is 0 \u2192 required is 1 \u2192 ceil(1/2)=1 \u2192 k=1 \u2192 total +=1. \n\nprev becomes 2. \n\nThis seems okay. \n\nBut what if prev is negative and a_i is such that even k_i=0 is not enough? \n\nWait, no. Because if prev is negative, then 0 is greater than prev. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is 0. \n\nSo this approach should work. \n\nNow, the problem is to implement this. \n\nBut how does this relate to the given code? \n\nThe given code loops over each i (from 0 to n-1), and for each i, computes p as the total steps needed if we set the current element as the starting point. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to consider each element as the starting point and compute the minimal steps from there. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to choose a pivot i and compute the steps required for the elements before and after. \n\nWait, the code's outer loop is for each i in 0..n-1. \n\nFor each i, it computes p as the sum of steps for the elements after i and before i. \n\nThe after loop is for the elements after i (a[i+1:]). \n\nThe code's after loop is:\n\nt starts at 0. \n\nfor each k in a[i+1:]:\n\n    d = ceil( (t+1)/k )\n\n    t = k*d \n\n    p +=d \n\nThis seems to be following the formula for the case when prev is non-negative. \n\nThe initial t is 0 (prev for the first element after i is 0). \n\nWait, but the first element after i is j =i+1. \n\nThe previous value for j is the current b_i's value. \n\nWait, but in the code's approach, the current b_i is set to 0? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is assuming that the current element i is set to 0, and then the elements after must be greater than 0. \n\nThe after loop computes the steps for the elements after i assuming that the current b_i is 0. \n\nThen the before loop must compute the steps for the elements before i, ensuring that their b values are less than 0. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nThe before loop is for the elements before i (reversed). \n\nThe code's before loop is missing. \n\nThe before loop should process the elements before i in reverse order (from i-1 down to 0). \n\nFor each element j in reversed(a[:i]):\n\nThe previous value (the next element in the sequence) is the current t. \n\nThe required b_j must be less than t. \n\nThe minimal steps for this element would be to choose the largest possible k_j such that k_j * a_j < t. \n\nThe minimal |k_j| is achieved by the largest possible k_j that is less than t/a_j. \n\nWait, the minimal steps would be the minimal |k_j| such that k_j * a_j < t. \n\nThe maximal possible k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ). \n\nThe minimal |k_j| is the closest to zero. \n\nSo for example, if t is positive, then the maximal k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ), but we want the minimal |k_j|. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the before loop should compute the steps needed for the elements before i to form an increasing sequence up to the current b_i (which is set to 0 in this case). \n\nWait, the current b_i is set to 0. \n\nThe elements before must have b_j <0. \n\nSo for each element j before i, we need to choose k_j such that k_j * a_j <0. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to set k_j to the largest possible negative integer such that k_j * a_j is as close to 0 as possible. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal steps would be to set k_j to 0 if possible, but that would give b_j=0 which is not less than 0. \n\nSo the minimal possible is k_j =-1, but that depends on a_j. \n\nWait, this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the before loop should be similar to the after loop but in reverse, with the condition that the current b_j must be less than the next value (t). \n\nThe code's after loop for the elements after i:\n\nThe initial t is 0 (the current b_i's value). \n\nFor each element after i (k = a[j], j from i+1 to n-1):\n\nThe required b_j must be > t. \n\nThe minimal steps are ceil( (t+1)/k ), and the new t is k*d. \n\nFor the before loop, the elements before i must have b_j < current b_i (0). \n\nSo for each element j in reversed(a[:i]):\n\nThe next value (the one after j) is the current t (initially set to 0). \n\nThe required b_j must be < t. \n\nThe minimal steps would be to choose the largest possible k_j such that k_j * a_j < t. \n\nThe maximal possible k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ). \n\nThe minimal steps would be the absolute value of k_j. \n\nWait, but how to compute this. \n\nThe minimal steps would be the minimal |k_j| such that k_j * a_j < t. \n\nThe best k_j is the largest possible integer less than t/a_j. \n\nThe minimal |k_j| is achieved when k_j is as close to zero as possible. \n\nFor example, if t is positive (0 in this case), then the maximal k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ) \u2192 floor(-1/a_j). \n\nSince a_j is positive, this is -1 if a_j is 1, or 0 if a_j>1. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose a_j is 3, t is 0. \n\nThen (t-1)/a_j = -1/3 \u2192 floor is -1. \n\nSo k_j can be -1 \u2192 -3 <0 \u2192 yes. \n\nThe steps are |k_j|=1. \n\nAlternatively, k_j could be 0 \u2192 0 is not less than 0 \u2192 no. \n\nSo the minimal steps is 1. \n\nAnother example: a_j=2, t=0 \u2192 (t-1)/a_j = -0.5 \u2192 floor is -1. \n\nk_j =-1 \u2192 -2 <0 \u2192 steps 1. \n\nAlternatively, k_j =-2 \u2192 -4 <0 \u2192 steps 2 \u2192 worse. \n\nSo the minimal is 1. \n\nSo the formula for k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ). \n\nThe steps added are |k_j|. \n\nThe new t is k_j * a_j. \n\nSo the before loop would be:\n\nt =0 \n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n    required = t-1 \n\n    d = required //k \n\n    # but wait, k is a_j, which is positive. \n\n    # So required is t-1. \n\n    # So k_j = floor( (t-1)/a_j )\n\n    # but since a_j is positive, \n\n    # d = (t-1) // a_j \n\n    # but need to ensure that k_j * a_j < t \n\n    # so k_j = floor( (t-1)/a_j )\n\n    k_j = (t-1) // a_j \n\n    steps += abs(k_j) \n\n    t = k_j * a_j \n\nWait, but this would give the maximal possible k_j such that k_j *a_j <t. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code's before loop should be:\n\nt =0 \n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n    d = (t-1) //k \n\n    steps += abs(d) \n\n    t = d *k \n\nBut in the code's variables, the before loop's code is missing. \n\nThe code's before loop is:\n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n    # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe variable t is initialized to 0 again. \n\nThe code's variable p is the total steps for this i. \n\nSo the code's before loop should compute the steps for the elements before i, and add them to p. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n    d = (t-1) // k \n\n    p += abs(d) \n\n    t = d *k \n\nWait, but in the code's after loop, the variable p is accumulating the steps from the after loop. \n\nSo the before loop should also add to p. \n\nSo the code's before loop should be:\n\nt =0 \n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n    d = (t-1) // k \n\n    p += abs(d) \n\n    t = d *k \n\nWait, but the initial t for the before loop should be the current b_i's value (which is 0 in this case). \n\nYes. \n\nSo the missing code for the before loop is:\n\nt =0 \n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n    d = (t-1) // k \n\n    p += abs(d) \n\n    t = d *k \n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the before loop is inside the for i loop. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n\n    p =0 \n\n    t =0 \n\n    for k in a[i+1:]:\n\n        ... \n\n    t =0 \n\n    for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n        # TODO \n\nSo the before loop's t is initialized to 0. \n\nThus, the missing code is the lines inside the before loop. \n\nSo the code for the before loop is:\n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n    d = (t -1) // k \n\n    p += abs(d)\n\n    t = d * k \n\nWait, but in the after loop, the code uses math.ceil( (t+1)/k ), but here it's using integer division. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the after loop, the required is to have k_j * a_j > t. \n\nThe minimal k_j is ceil( (t+1)/a_j ), which is the same as (t+1 + a_j -1) // a_j \u2192 ceil division. \n\nIn the before loop, the required is k_j * a_j < t. \n\nThe maximal possible k_j is floor( (t-1)/a_j ). \n\nSo the code for the before loop's d is (t-1) // a_j. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the missing code for program2 is the lines inside the before loop's TODO. \n\nSo the code for program2's missing part is:\n\nd = (t -1) // k \n\np += abs(d)\n\nt = d * k \n\nThus, the code for the before loop is:\n\nfor k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n    d = (t -1) // k \n\n    p += abs(d)\n\n    t = d * k \n\nNow, moving to program3.py. \n\nThe problem is to count the number of rectangles (axis-aligned) such that the two diagonals form parallel and non-crossing poles. \n\nThe conditions are that the four points form a rectangle, and the two pairs of opposite corners form the poles. \n\nThe poles must be parallel and not cross. \n\nThe problem states that the four points must form the vertices of an axis-aligned rectangle. \n\nThe two pairs of points are (a, b) and (c, d), where the rectangle is formed by (x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y1), (x2,y2). \n\nThe two poles are the pairs of opposite corners. \n\nThe poles must be parallel and not cross. \n\nThe poles are parallel if they are either both horizontal or both vertical. \n\nWait, no. The poles are the two diagonals of the rectangle. \n\nWait, the problem says the poles are the two pairs of opposite corners. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\nThe two younger contestants hold one pole, and the two older hold the other. \n\nThe poles must be parallel and not cross. \n\nThe poles are the two diagonals of the rectangle. \n\nFor the diagonals to be parallel, they must be the same line, but that's only possible if the rectangle is a square with zero area, which is not possible. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. \n\nThe problem says the four contestants are on the vertices of an axis-aligned rectangle. \n\nThe two poles are the two pairs of opposite corners. \n\nThe poles must be parallel and not cross. \n\nThe poles are the two diagonals of the rectangle. \n\nWait, the diagonals of a rectangle are not parallel. They are perpendicular unless it's a square, but even then they are perpendicular. \n\nAh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's description. \n\nThe problem says: \n\nThe two younger contestants hold one of the poles, while the two older contestants hold the other pole. \n\nThe poles are parallel and do not cross. \n\nThe poles are the two pairs of opposite corners. \n\nWait, perhaps the poles are the two sides of the rectangle? \n\nNo, the problem says the four contestants are on the vertices of a rectangle. \n\nThe two poles are the two pairs of opposite corners. \n\nThe poles must be parallel and not cross. \n\nWait, the two diagonals of a rectangle are not parallel. \n\nSo perhaps the poles are the two sides of the rectangle? \n\nNo, the problem says the four contestants are on the vertices. \n\nThe two poles are the two pairs of opposite corners. \n\nWait, perhaps the poles are the two edges connecting the pairs of opposite corners. \n\nThe two diagonals of the rectangle are the two poles. \n\nBut diagonals are not parallel. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nLooking at the problem's note:\n\nIn the first sample, there is only one way to choose four contestants (the four corners of the rectangle), but the poles cross. \n\nThe answer is 0. \n\nIn the second sample, the same four contestants but the poles don't cross, so the answer is 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the poles are the two sides of the rectangle. \n\nWait, the problem says the poles are held by two pairs of contestants. \n\nThe two younger contestants hold one pole (a line between them), and the two older hold the other. \n\nThe poles must be parallel and not cross. \n\nThe four points form a rectangle. \n\nThe two pairs of points must form two lines that are parallel and do not cross. \n\nThe two lines are the two sides of the rectangle. \n\nFor example, in a rectangle, the two horizontal sides are parallel and do not cross. \n\nSimilarly for the vertical sides. \n\nWait, but the four corners are (x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y1), (x2,y2). \n\nThe two horizontal sides are between (x1,y1)-(x1,y2) and (x2,y1)-(x2,y2). \n\nThese are parallel and do not cross. \n\nThe two vertical sides are between (x1,y1)-(x2,y1) and (x1,y2)-(x2,y2). \n\nThese are also parallel and do not cross. \n\nThe diagonals are between (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) and (x1,y2)-(x2,y1), which cross each other. \n\nSo the valid configurations are when the two pairs of points form the two horizontal sides or the two vertical sides. \n\nThus, the problem requires that the four points form a rectangle, and the two pairs of points are the two horizontal sides or the two vertical sides. \n\nThe two pairs must be parallel and not cross. \n\nThus, the valid configurations are those where the four points form a rectangle, and the two pairs are either the two horizontal sides or the two vertical sides. \n\nThe two pairs are the two pairs of opposite edges. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of rectangles where the two pairs of opposite edges are chosen such that the pairs are parallel and non-crossing. \n\nBut how to count this? \n\nThe problem requires that the four points are the four corners of a rectangle. \n\nFor each such rectangle, there are two possible ways to choose the pairs of points: either the horizontal sides or the vertical sides. \n\nBut the problem counts each such choice as a valid configuration. \n\nWait, the problem says that two choices are different if at least one contestant is included in one but not the other. \n\nBut for a rectangle, the four corners are fixed. \n\nThe two possible choices (horizontal or vertical pairs) are different configurations. \n\nThus, for each rectangle, there are two valid configurations. \n\nBut the problem's first sample has one rectangle but the answer is 0. \n\nWait, the first sample's note says that the four contestants form a rectangle, but the poles cross. \n\nAh, perhaps the problem requires that the two pairs of points form lines that are parallel and do not cross. \n\nThe horizontal sides are parallel and do not cross. \n\nThe vertical sides are also parallel and do not cross. \n\nThus, for each rectangle, both choices are valid. \n\nBut the first sample's answer is 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's conditions. \n\nThe first sample's note says that the four contestants are arranged such that the poles cross. \n\nWait, perhaps the first sample's rectangle is such that the two pairs chosen are the diagonals, which cross. \n\nAh! The problem says that the two pairs are the two younger and two older. \n\nThe two younger contestants are the two with the smallest ages, and the two older are the two with the largest. \n\nThe poles are the lines connecting the two younger and the two older. \n\nThe poles must be parallel and not cross. \n\nAh! This changes everything. \n\nThe four points are the four corners of a rectangle. \n\nThe two younger contestants are the two with the smallest ages among the four. \n\nThe two older are the two with the largest. \n\nThe two poles are the line between the two younger and the line between the two older. \n\nThese two lines must be parallel and not cross. \n\nThus, the problem is to count the number of rectangles where the two youngest and two oldest form two parallel, non-crossing lines. \n\nThe steps to solve this are:\n\nFor each rectangle (four corners), we need to:\n\n1. Find the two youngest and two oldest among the four corners. \n\n2. The two youngest form one line (the pole), and the two oldest form the other. \n\n3. These two lines must be parallel and not cross. \n\nThe count is the number of such rectangles. \n\nThe challenge is to compute this efficiently for large n (up to 1500). \n\nThe approach in the given code is to precompute for each cell (i,j) the number of cells less than it in its row and column, and similarly for greater. \n\nThe code's current structure has:\n\nijs = [0]*(N^2). \n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), they are being added to ijs in some order. \n\nThen, the answer is computed by iterating over the cells in the order of their ages. \n\nThe code's variables l_row, g_row, etc. are counts of how many cells have been processed before in the row and column. \n\nThe formula used is answer += l_col * g_row + g_col * l_row. \n\nThe final answer is divided by 2. \n\nThe idea seems to be that for each cell, when processed in order of increasing age, the number of valid pairs where this cell is the second youngest or something like that. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThe problem requires that for a rectangle's four corners, the two youngest and two oldest form two parallel, non-crossing lines. \n\nThe lines must be parallel, so they must be either both horizontal or both vertical. \n\nAlso, they must not cross. \n\nFor the lines to be parallel and not cross, they must be either both horizontal and at the same y-coordinate (but then they would be the same line), or separated. \n\nWait, perhaps the two lines are the two horizontal sides of the rectangle. \n\nIn that case, they are parallel and do not cross. \n\nSimilarly for vertical sides. \n\nThus, the valid configurations are those where the two youngest are on one horizontal line and the two oldest on the other horizontal line, or similarly for vertical. \n\nAlternatively, the two youngest are on one vertical line and the two oldest on the other vertical line. \n\nThus, for a rectangle with corners (x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y1), (x2,y2), the two youngest could be (x1,y1) and (x1,y2) (the top row), and the two oldest could be (x2,y1) and (x2,y2) (the bottom row). \n\nThe lines between them are horizontal, parallel, and non-crossing. \n\nSimilarly, the two youngest could be (x1,y1) and (x2,y1) (left column), and the two oldest (x1,y2) and (x2,y2) (right column). \n\nThe lines are vertical and parallel. \n\nThus, for each rectangle, there are two valid configurations if the ages allow it. \n\nThe problem is to count all such rectangles where the four corners' ages allow this. \n\nThe key is to find for each rectangle whether the two youngest are on one horizontal/vertical line and the two oldest on the other. \n\nThe approach in the code seems to be based on the order of the ages. \n\nThe code's ijs list is filled with the coordinates of the cells in the order of their ages. \n\nThe cells are processed in increasing order of age. \n\nFor each cell (i,j), when it is processed, the variables l_row and g_row represent the number of cells in the row before and after this cell. \n\nSimilarly for columns. \n\nThe formula answer += l_col * g_row + g_col * l_row \n\nThis might be counting the number of valid pairs where this cell is the second youngest or something. \n\nThe final answer is divided by 2, possibly because each configuration is counted twice. \n\nThe code's current missing part is the initialization of the ijs list. \n\nThe code has:\n\nijs = [0]*(N^2)\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe code needs to fill the ijs list with the coordinates (i,j) sorted in the order of increasing age. \n\nBecause the cells are processed in the order of their ages. \n\nThe missing code is to sort the cells based on their age. \n\nThe current loop is iterating over all cells (i,j), but they need to be stored in ijs in the order of increasing a[i][j]. \n\nThus, the code should first collect all the cells with their coordinates and ages, sort them by age, then store the coordinates in ijs. \n\nThe missing code is:\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        ijs.append( (a[i][j], i, j) )\n\nThen, sort ijs by the first element (age), and then extract the (i,j) pairs. \n\nBut the current code has ijs initialized as a list of size N^2. \n\nAlternatively, the code should first collect all the cells, sort them by age, then assign to ijs. \n\nThe code's current structure has:\n\nijs = [0]*(N**2)\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\nThe correct code would be to fill ijs with the coordinates in the order of increasing age. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nThe cells are stored in a list, sorted by their age, then assigned to ijs. \n\nThe code should be:\n\ncells = []\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        cells.append( (As[i][j], i, j) )\n\ncells.sort()\n\nijs = [ (i,j) for (age, i,j) in cells ]\n\nBut since the initial ijs is a list of length N^2, the code can be written as:\n\nk =0 \n\nfor age, i,j in sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) ):\n\n    ijs[k] = (i,j)\n\n    k +=1 \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\ncells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nThus, the missing code in program3 is to fill the ijs list with the coordinates in order of increasing age. \n\nThe current code's loop over i and j is iterating through all cells, but they need to be sorted by age. \n\nThus, the missing code is to collect all the cells, sort them by age, and then assign their coordinates to ijs. \n\nThe code's current loop is iterating over i and j, but the TODO is to fill the ijs list. \n\nThe correct code for the TODO is to first collect all the cells with their coordinates and ages, sort them by age, then assign to ijs. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is:\n\nThe code should first collect all the cells, sort them by their age, then fill the ijs list with their coordinates in that order. \n\nThe code's current loop is iterating over i and j, but the TODO is to fill the ijs list. \n\nThe correct code would be:\n\ncells = []\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        cells.append( (As[i][j], i, j) )\n\ncells.sort()\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nBut since the code is in the loop over i and j, perhaps the code should be written as:\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        # append to a list \n\nBut the current code's structure has the loop over i and j inside the for loop for each test case. \n\nWait, the code for program3 is:\n\nimport sys\n\ninput = sys.stdin.buffer.readline\n\nN = int(input())\n\nAs = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]\n\nijs = [0] * (N ** 2)\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\nanswer =0 \n\nrow_sum = [0]*N \n\ncol_sum = [0]*N \n\nfor i,j in ijs:\n\n    ... \n\nThus, the missing code is to fill the ijs list with the coordinates in the order of increasing age. \n\nThe correct way is to first collect all the cells, sort them by age, then assign to ijs. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\ncells = []\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        cells.append( (As[i][j], i, j) )\n\ncells.sort()\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nBut since the code is in Python, the list comprehensions can be used. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\ncells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is the code to fill the ijs list with the coordinates in order of increasing age. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe missing code for program1 is the line in the else clause of dic_l:\n\nelse:\n\n    dic_l[x + y] += check[x][y]\n\nThe missing code for program2 is the lines in the before loop:\n\nd = (t -1) // k \n\np += abs(d)\n\nt = d * k \n\nThe missing code for program3 is filling the ijs list with the sorted coordinates by age:\n\ncells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nBut in the code's current structure, the loop over i and j is present, so perhaps the code should be written as:\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        # append to a list \n\nBut the code needs to collect all cells first, then sort them. \n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO in program3 is:\n\ncells = []\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        cells.append( (As[i][j], i, j) )\n\ncells.sort()\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nBut since the code's current loop is iterating over i and j, perhaps the code should be written as:\n\n# collect all cells first \n\ncells = []\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        cells.append( (As[i][j], i, j) )\n\ncells.sort()\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nBut the code's current loop over i and j is not needed for this part. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is the code to fill the ijs list with the sorted coordinates. \n\nSo the final answers are:\n\nprogram1: the missing line is the else clause for dic_l:\n\nelse:\n    dic_l[x + y] += check[x][y]\n\nprogram2: the missing code in the before loop is:\n\nd = (t -1) // k \n\np += abs(d)\n\nt = d * k \n\nprogram3: the missing code is to fill the ijs list with the sorted cells by age:\n\ncells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nBut in the code's current structure, the loop over i and j is present but not used. So the correct code would be to first collect the cells, sort them, then assign to ijs. \n\nThus, the code for program3's missing part is:\n\ncells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nBut since the code's current loop is iterating over i and j, perhaps the code should be written as:\n\n# the loop over i and j is not needed for this part. \n\n# the correct code is to first collect all cells and sort them. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is the code to fill the ijs list with the sorted coordinates. \n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"dic_l[x + y] += check[x][y]\",\n    \"program2\": \"d = (t -1) // k \\n p += abs(d)\\n t = d * k\",\n    \"program3\": \"cells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\\n for idx in range(N*N):\\n     ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\"\n}\n\nWait, but the code for program3's missing part is inside the loop over i and j? \n\nNo, the code for program3's missing part is the loop over i and j is not needed. The code should first collect all cells, sort them, then fill the ijs list. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nfor i in range(N):\n\n    for j in range(N):\n\n        # TODO: Your code here \n\nBut the correct code doesn't need this loop. \n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO is to replace the loop with the code to fill the ijs list. \n\nBut the problem states that the user must fill in the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe code for program3's missing part is the block that fills the ijs list. \n\nThe current code has the loop over i and j, but the correct code should replace that with the code to fill the ijs list. \n\nBut the problem says to fill in the missing lines or blocks. \n\nThe code's current structure has the loop over i and j with a TODO. \n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO is to replace that loop with the code to fill the ijs list. \n\nBut since the user must output only the missing code, not the entire program, the missing code is the code to fill the ijs list. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is:\n\ncells = sorted( (As[i][j], i, j) for i in range(N) for j in range(N) )\n\nfor idx in range(N*N):\n\n    ijs[idx] = (cells[idx][1], cells[idx][2])\n\nBut since the code's current loop is iterating over i and j, perhaps the code should be written as:\n\n# the loop over i and j is not needed. \n\n# the correct code is to first collect all cells and sort them. \n\nThus, the missing code for program3 is the code to fill the ijs list as above. \n\nSo the final JSON is as above."
