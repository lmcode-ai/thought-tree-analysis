Wait, the a array is initialized as [-1] followed by the p_i's. So for node 1 (1-based), a[1] is -1. For node 2, a[2] is p_2 (which is 1-based?), but stored as 0-based. Wait, the code's a is [int(o)-1 for o in input().split()]. So for example, if the input for p_2 is 1, then a[2] is 0 (since 1-1=0). So the nodes are 1-based, but stored in 0-based arrays. Wait, the code's variables f and dp are of size n. So for node i (1-based), the index in f is i-1. Wait, perhaps the code is using 0-based indices for the nodes. Wait, the code's first loop is for i in range(n-1, 0, -1).",

So p_5 is 4. So the input for p_5 is 4. So the second line would be 1 1 2 4 2. Then, the code's a array for node5 (index5 in 1-based) would be 4-1=3 (0-based). So the children array for node4 (0-based) would include node5. But regardless, the code must have a way to track children. Assuming that the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between its children's f plus 1, then the missing code would be:\n\nfor each node i in reverse order (from n-1 down to 1):\n\n    f[i] = 1  # base case for leaves\n\n    for child in children[i]:\n\n        if f[child] +1 > f[i]:\n\n            f[i] = f[child]+1\n\nBut without the children array, this can't be done. Therefore, the code must have a children array. The code's first loop is missing the code to build the children array. Wait, but the first loop is inside the code. Ah, perhaps the first loop is supposed to build the children array. Wait, no. Alternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to look at its parent and update f[i].",

The first loop processes nodes from 5 down to 1. For node5 (i=5 in 1-based?), which is index4 in 0-based. The children of node5 are those j where a[j] ==4 (since node5's index is4). Wait, no.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle these three programs one by one. \n\nStarting with program1.py. The problem is about finding the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the sequence s generated through specific operations. The code provided has some missing parts in the loops. The key here is to model the dependencies of the cards and track the best possible DP values. \n\nLooking at the code structure, there's a loop from n-1 down to 1. The first loop is for initializing f and dp arrays. The second loop is propagating the dp values. The missing part in the first loop probably involves calculating f[i], which might be the maximum contribution from the subtree rooted at i. Since each card i (except 1) is hanging from p_i, the structure is a tree with 1 as the root. \n\nThe approach might involve dynamic programming where for each node, we consider the best possible value by either taking the node's own contribution or combining with its children. The f array might store the maximum dp value for the subtree, and the dp array tracks the current maximum. The missing code in the first loop (for i in range(n-1,0,-1)) probably updates f[i] based on its children. Since each node's parent is p_i, perhaps f[i] is the maximum between its own value and the f of its children. Wait, but the code's structure is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe f[i] is the maximum dp value in the subtree rooted at i. \n\nWait, the code's second loop does dp[i] = max(dp[i], f[i]+1), then adds dp[i] to the parent's dp. So perhaps f[i] is the maximum value from the subtree, and the DP is being built bottom-up. The first loop's missing part might be initializing f[i] as the maximum between its children's f values plus 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe f[i] is the maximum possible contribution from the subtree when considering the node's value. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that when a node is removed, if its parent's value is larger, the parent's value is replaced. This suggests that the values on the cards can be adjusted downwards as we remove leaves. The optimal strategy would be to arrange the permutation such that the sequence s has as long a non-decreasing subsequence as possible. \n\nThe key insight might be that the maximum length is the size of the largest antichain in the tree, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming where each node's contribution is tracked. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's f array is storing the maximum dp value for the subtree. The first loop (the one with TODO) might be traversing each node and updating f[i] based on its children. Since the nodes are processed in reverse order (from n down to 1), each node's children would have already been processed. Wait, but the parent of node i is p_i, which is less than i. So for node i, its children are those nodes j where p_j = i. \n\nWait, the tree is built such that each node except 1 has a parent p_i < i. So the tree is a forest where each node's parent is smaller, so the root is 1. So for each node i, its children are all j where p_j = i. \n\nIn the first loop (for i from n-1 down to 1), perhaps for each node i, we need to look at its parent and update f[i] and dp[i]. Alternatively, maybe the first loop is for initializing f[i] as the maximum between its children's f plus 1, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop might be calculating for each node the maximum possible contribution from its subtree. The code's second loop propagates the dp values upwards. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute for each node i the maximum between its own value (maybe 1) plus the maximum of its children's dp. \n\nWait, looking at the code's second loop:\n\nfor i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n    dp[i] = max(dp[i], f[i]+1)\n    dp[a[i]] += dp[i]\n\nWait, a is the list of p_i's. Wait, the input for a is given as p_2 to p_n. The code does a = [-1] + [int(o)-1 for o in input().split()]. So a[i] is p_i (but stored as 0-based index?), since the input is p_2 to p_n. So for i from 2 to n, a[i] is p_i (but stored as 0-based? Or maybe 1-based? Let me see: the first line is n = int(input()), then the second line has n-1 numbers, which are p_2 to p_n. So for i from 2 to n, p_i is given. The code's a is initialized as [-1] followed by the list of p_i's (but converted to integers minus 1?), so perhaps a is 0-based. \n\nWait, the code's a is [int(o)-1 for o in input().split()]. So for example, if the input for p_2 is 1, then a[2] is 0 (since 1-1=0). So the parent of node i (1-based) is a[i], which is 0-based. \n\nThe code's variables f and dp are arrays of size n (since n is the number of nodes). \n\nThe first loop is for i in range(n-1, 0, -1). Wait, n is the number of nodes. So for example, if n is 6, then the loop runs from 5 down to 1 (since range(5,0,-1)). \n\nWait, the code's first loop is for i in range(n-1, 0, -1). Wait, the range is from n-1 (since in Python, the end is exclusive). Wait, the code says:\n\nfor i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWait, the nodes are numbered from 1 to n. So the loop is iterating over i from n-1 down to 1. Wait, but n-1 is the index for the node n? Because the nodes are 1-based. For example, if n is 6, then the nodes are 1-6. The loop starts at 5 (since n-1 is 5?), but that's the index for node 6? Hmm, perhaps the code uses 0-based indices. Wait, the a array is 0-based. The first element is -1 (for node 0, which doesn't exist). The rest are the p_i's. \n\nWait, perhaps the nodes are 1-based, and the a array is 1-based. So a[1] is p_1, but p_1 is not given (since p_i is only for i>1). So a[1] is -1. \n\nThe first loop is for i from n-1 down to 1. Wait, n-1 is the index for node n? Because the nodes are 1-based. So for node n, the index in a is n. Wait, perhaps the code is using 1-based indices for the nodes. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is processing each node in reverse order (from n down to 1). For each node i, we need to process its children first. \n\nThe code's first loop is where the missing part is. The variables f and dp are initialized to 0. \n\nThe second loop is propagating the dp values. \n\nThe final output is the maximum between dp[0] and f[0]+1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the f array is storing the maximum dp value in the subtree rooted at i. \n\nWait, the code's second loop does:\n\ndp[i] = max(dp[i], f[i]+1) \n\nThen adds dp[i] to the parent's dp. \n\nSo for each node i, the dp[i] is the maximum between its current value and f[i]+1. Then, the dp of the parent (a[i]) is increased by dp[i]. \n\nThis suggests that f[i] is the maximum value from the subtree, and the dp[i] is the contribution of this node to its parent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps f[i] is the maximum possible value for the subtree rooted at i. \n\nThe first loop's missing code must compute f[i] and dp[i] based on the children. \n\nWait, the first loop is for i from n-1 down to 1. Wait, perhaps the first loop is for each node, and for each node, we look at its parent and update f and dp. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node except the root (since the root is 1?), and for each node, we process its children. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node, and for each node, we look at its children (those nodes j where p_j = i). \n\nWait, the parent of node j is a[j]. So for each node i, the children are all j where a[j] == i. \n\nSo in the first loop, for each node i (processed in reverse order), we can collect all children and compute f[i] as the maximum of (f[child] + 1) or something similar. \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between its children's f plus 1, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is initializing f[i] as 1 (the base case for a leaf node), and then for each node, considering its children. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node, and for each node, we need to compute f[i] as the maximum between its children's f values plus 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum of (f[j] for all children j of i) plus 1. \n\nBut how to track the children? \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node, and for each node, we look at its parent and update f and dp. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node, and for each node, we need to process its children first. Since the loop is going from n down to 1, each node's children (which have higher indices) would have been processed already. \n\nWait, the children of node i are those j where a[j] = i. Since j must be larger than i (since p_j < j, so a[j] = p_j < j, so j can be any node after i. \n\nWait, for example, if i is 3, then any j where a[j] = 3 must be j>3. \n\nSo when processing i in reverse order (from n down to 1), all children of i (which are larger than i) have already been processed. \n\nTherefore, for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] = i. \n\nSo in the first loop, for each i, we can iterate over its children and compute f[i] as the maximum between its current value and (f[j] + 1). \n\nWait, but how to track the children? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute for each node i, the maximum f value among its children plus 1. \n\nBut how to track the children? \n\nAlternatively, the code might have a list of children for each node. \n\nWait, the code as given doesn't have such a list. So perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, looks at its children (those j where a[j] == i) and updates f[i] and dp[i]. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and for each node, we can look at its parent (a[i]) and do something. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is supposed to initialize f[i] as 1 (the base case for leaves), and then for each node, the f[i] is the maximum between its children's f plus 1. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node, and for each node, we can compute f[i] as the maximum of f[j] for all children j of i, plus 1. \n\nBut how to track the children? \n\nAlternatively, the code might have a list of children for each node. Since the nodes are processed in reverse order, perhaps for each node i, we can iterate through all j where a[j] == i (children of i) and then compute f[i] as the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1. \n\nWait, but how to track the children? \n\nThe code doesn't have a children array. So perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, loops through all possible children (but how?), or perhaps the code is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] + 1? No, that might not be right. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its parent plus 1. But that would be for the parent, not the children. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe problem requires that the sequence s is built by removing leaves (nodes with no children left) each time, appending their value, and possibly updating the parent's value. The goal is to maximize the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of s. \n\nThe key is to choose the permutation a such that when the process is done, the sequence s has the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence. \n\nThe optimal strategy would involve arranging the numbers such that whenever a node's value is lower than its parent, the parent's value gets updated to the child's value. This way, the parent's value can be as small as possible, allowing for longer non-decreasing sequences. \n\nThe DP approach might track for each node the maximum possible contribution to the subsequence. \n\nPerhaps the DP[i] represents the maximum length of the non-decreasing subsequence that can be formed up to node i. \n\nAlternatively, the DP[i] could be the maximum length achievable in the subtree rooted at i. \n\nThe code's variables f and dp might be related to this. \n\nLooking at the code's second loop:\n\nfor i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n    dp[i] = max(dp[i], f[i]+1)\n    dp[a[i]] += dp[i]\n\nThis suggests that dp[i] is being updated based on f[i], and then added to the parent's dp. \n\nThe final answer is the maximum between dp[0] and f[0]+1. \n\nPerhaps f[i] is the maximum possible length contributed by the subtree rooted at i, and dp[i] is the accumulated value. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop (the one with the TODO) is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum of the f values of its children plus 1. \n\nWait, let's think of the first loop. \n\nSuppose for each node i (processed in reverse order), we look at all its children (those j where a[j] = i). \n\nThen, for each child j of i, the f[i] would be the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1. \n\nThis way, f[i] represents the length of the longest path in the subtree, which could correspond to the maximum possible contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the f array might track the maximum possible value of the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the subtree. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is initializing f[i] as 1 (the base case for leaves), and then for each node, after processing its children, f[i] is the maximum of all f[j] (children) plus 1. \n\nSo the code for the first loop would be something like:\n\nchildren = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\nfor j in range(2, n+1):\n    p = a[j]\n    children[p].append(j)\n\nThen, for each i in reverse order (from n down to 1), f[i] = 1, and for each child j in children[i], f[i] = max(f[i], f[j] + 1)\n\nBut the code doesn't have a children array. So perhaps the code is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, since the nodes are processed in reverse order, for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, the a array is such that a[j] is the parent of j. So for each j from 2 to n, a[j] is the parent. \n\nSo for each i, the children are all j where a[j] == i. \n\nBut how to track that in the loop? \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each i from n down to 1, and for each i, we can look at its parent (a[i]) and do something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] + 1. But that would be for the parent, not the children. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i (except the root), we look at its parent and update f[i] based on the parent's f value. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between its children's f values plus 1. \n\nBut without a children array, how to do that? \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to look at all nodes j where a[j] == i (children of i) and then compute f[i] as the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1. \n\nBut how to track those j's? \n\nAlternatively, the code can precompute for each node its children. \n\nWait, the code doesn't have that. So perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, loops through all possible children (but how?), but that's not feasible. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] + 1. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's f value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut how to track the children? \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is supposed to process each node and for each node, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but in the first loop, the nodes are processed in reverse order (from n down to 1). So for each i, the children (which are j > i) have already been processed. \n\nTherefore, for each i, we can iterate over all j where a[j] == i (children of i) and then compute f[i] as the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1. \n\nBut how to track those j's? \n\nThe code doesn't have a children array. So perhaps the code is using a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its parent plus 1. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's f value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut without knowing the children, how can this be done? \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the f[i] is initialized to 1, and then for each child j of i, f[i] is updated to the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1. \n\nBut how to track the children? \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using a list of children for each node. Let me think: \n\nThe code can precompute a children array. \n\nchildren = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\nfor j in range(2, n+1):\n    p = a[j]\n    children[p].append(j)\n\nThen, in the first loop, for each i in reverse order (from n down to 1), we can compute f[i] as the maximum of (f[j] for j in children[i]) plus 1. \n\nBut the code doesn't have this. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using the a array to track the parent, and the first loop is for each node i, and for each node, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nBut in the first loop, the code is iterating over i from n-1 down to 1 (assuming 0-based indices?), but perhaps the code is using 1-based indices. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to look at all nodes j where a[j] == i (children of i) and then compute f[i] as the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1. \n\nBut how to do that without a children array? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using a different approach. \n\nWait, the code's first loop is for i in range(n-1, 0, -1). \n\nWait, the nodes are numbered from 1 to n. So the loop is iterating from n-1 down to 1. Wait, but n-1 is the index for node n? \n\nWait, perhaps the code uses 0-based indices for the nodes. \n\nWait, the a array is initialized as [-1] followed by the p_i's. So for node 1 (1-based), a[1] is -1. For node 2, a[2] is p_2 (which is 1-based?), but stored as 0-based. \n\nWait, the code's a is [int(o)-1 for o in input().split()]. So for example, if the input for p_2 is 1, then a[2] is 0 (since 1-1=0). \n\nSo the nodes are 1-based, but stored in 0-based arrays. \n\nWait, the code's variables f and dp are of size n. So for node i (1-based), the index in f is i-1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using 0-based indices for the nodes. \n\nWait, the code's first loop is for i in range(n-1, 0, -1). \n\nWait, n is the number of nodes. So for example, if n is 6, the loop runs from 5 down to 1 (since range(5,0,-1)). \n\nSo the nodes are 0-based here. \n\nWait, the nodes are 0-based? \n\nWait, the first node is 0 (since a[0] is -1?), but the first node is 1. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first loop is for each node i (0-based from 1 to n-1), since the loop starts at n-1 (which is the last node). \n\nWait, the code's a is of length n (since it starts with -1 and then n-1 elements). \n\nSo the nodes are 0-based. \n\nSo node 0 is the root (since p_i < i for all i>1, so node 0's parent is -1, which is the root). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using 0-based indices. \n\nSo for each node i (0-based from 1 to n-1), the parent is a[i], which is less than i. \n\nThe first loop is for i from n-1 down to 1 (since the loop is range(n-1, 0, -1)). \n\nSo for each node i (starting from the last node), we need to process its children. \n\nBut how to find the children? \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut without knowing the children, perhaps the code is using the parent's information. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] + 1. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's f value. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, f[i] is initialized to 1 (the base case for leaves), and then for each node, we look at its children and update f[i] as the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1 for each child j. \n\nBut how to track the children? \n\nAlternatively, the code is using a different approach. \n\nWait, the problem requires the maximum length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. \n\nThe key insight might be that the maximum possible length is the size of the largest antichain in the tree. \n\nAn antichain is a set of nodes where no two are comparable in the tree's parent-child hierarchy. \n\nThe size of the largest antichain in a tree is equal to the maximum number of nodes in any level of the tree. \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nEach time a node is removed, its value is added to s. The process of replacing the parent's value with the child's value when the parent's value is larger can be thought of as propagating the minimum possible value upwards. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to assign the numbers such that whenever a node is removed, its value is as small as possible, allowing the parent's value to be updated. \n\nThe longest non-decreasing subsequence would then be the maximum number of nodes in a chain where each node's value is <= the next. \n\nAlternatively, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of nodes in a path from the root to a leaf, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the DP approach in the code is trying to track for each node the maximum possible contribution to the subsequence. \n\nThe code's second loop propagates the dp values upwards. \n\nPerhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between the f of its children plus 1. \n\nSo the missing code in the first loop is something like:\n\nmax_child = 0\nfor child in children[i]:\n    if f[child] > max_child:\n        max_child = f[child]\nf[i] = max_child + 1\n\nBut without the children array, how to do this? \n\nAlternatively, the code can precompute the children array. \n\nWait, the code doesn't have that. So perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, the a array holds the parent of each node. So for each node j (from 1 to n-1 in 0-based?), the parent is a[j]. \n\nSo for each node i, the children are all j where a[j] == i. \n\nTherefore, in the first loop, for each i in reverse order (from n-1 down to 1), we can iterate over all j where a[j] == i (children of i) and compute f[i] as the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1. \n\nBut how to do this without a children array? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code can loop through all nodes j from i+1 to n-1 and check if a[j] == i. \n\nBut that would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5. \n\nSo that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the code must have a way to track the children for each node. \n\nAh, right! The code must have a children array. \n\nWait, the code as given doesn't have that. So perhaps the first loop is missing code that builds the children array first. \n\nWait, the code's first loop is the only place where the a array is used. \n\nWait, the code's a is the list of parents. \n\nSo perhaps the first step is to build a children array. \n\nThe code's first loop is missing the code to build the children array. \n\nWait, but the first loop is inside the code. \n\nAlternatively, the code is supposed to precompute the children array before the loops. \n\nWait, the code starts with:\n\nn=int(input())\na=[-1]+[int(o)-1 for o in input().split()]\nf=[0]*n\ndp=[0]*n\n\nThen the first loop is for i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n\nWait, the a array is 1-based? Because the first element is -1 (for node 1?), and then the next elements are p_2 to p_n. \n\nWait, the a array is 1-based. \n\nSo for node i (1-based), a[i] is its parent (also 1-based?), but stored as 0-based? \n\nWait, the code's a is initialized as [-1] followed by the list of p_i's. \n\nWait, the input for p_2 is the parent of node 2. \n\nSo for node 2, a[2] is p_2 (which is 1-based?), but stored as p_2 -1 (since the code does int(o)-1). \n\nSo the a array is 1-based, with a[1] being -1 (since node 1 has no parent), and a[i] for i>1 is the parent's index (0-based?). \n\nWait, perhaps the nodes are 1-based, and the a array is 1-based. \n\nSo for node i (1-based), a[i] is the parent's index (1-based?), but stored as 0-based. \n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute for each node i, the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] + 1. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's f value. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut without knowing the children, this is impossible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but how to find those j's? \n\nThe code can precompute a children array. \n\nSo the code should have something like:\n\nchildren = [[] for _ in range(n)]\nfor j in range(2, n+1):\n    p = a[j]\n    children[p].append(j)\n\nWait, but in the code's a array, a is 1-based. \n\nWait, the code's a is [-1] followed by the p_i's. \n\nWait, the code's a is of length n (since the first element is -1, then n-1 elements for p_2 to p_n). \n\nSo for node j (1-based), a[j] is the parent's index (1-based?), but stored as 0-based? \n\nWait, the code's a is built as:\n\na = [-1] + [int(o)-1 for o in input().split()]\n\nSo for example, if the input for p_2 is 1, then a[2] is 0 (since 1-1=0). \n\nSo the a array is 1-based, with a[1] being -1 (no parent), and a[i] for i>1 is the parent's index (0-based). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the input for p_2 is the parent of node 2, which is given as an integer. \n\nSuppose the input for p_2 is 1 (the first node). \n\nThen, the code's a[2] is (1) -1 = 0. \n\nSo the parent of node 2 (1-based) is stored as 0 (0-based). \n\nThus, the nodes are 1-based, but their parents are stored as 0-based indices. \n\nTherefore, the children array should be built as follows:\n\nchildren = [[] for _ in range(n)]  # 0-based indices for parents\nfor j in range(2, n+1):  # j is 1-based node number\n    p = a[j]  # which is 0-based parent index\n    children[p].append(j)  # j is 1-based node number\n\nWait, but the children array's indices are 0-based (since the parent is stored as 0-based). \n\nSo for each node j (1-based), its parent is a[j], which is 0-based. \n\nThus, the children array can be built as:\n\nchildren = [[] for _ in range(n)]\nfor j in range(2, n+1):\n    p = a[j]\n    children[p].append(j)\n\nThen, in the first loop, for each node i (processed in reverse order), we can iterate over its children and compute f[i] as the maximum between its current value and f[j] + 1. \n\nBut the code doesn't have this children array. \n\nTherefore, the first loop's missing code must include this. \n\nWait, but the code's first loop is the only place where the a array is used. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] + 1. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's f value. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i (starting from the end), and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as 1 plus the maximum f of its children. \n\nBut without the children array, how to do that? \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but how to find those j's? \n\nThe code can loop through all nodes j from i+1 to n and check if a[j] == i. \n\nBut that would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5. \n\nThus, the code must have a children array. \n\nTherefore, the first loop's missing code must include building the children array. \n\nWait, but the code's first loop is the first place where the a array is used. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is missing the children array's initialization. \n\nThe code's first loop is for i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] + 1. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's f value. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut without the children array, this is not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but how to track that? \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to look at its parent and update f[i] based on the parent's f value. \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] + 1. \n\nBut then, the parent's f value would be considered. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut without knowing the children, this is impossible. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let's think of the sample input. \n\nSample input 1:\n\n6\n\n1 1 2 5 2 \n\nWait, the p_2 to p_6 are 1,1,2,5,2. \n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\n1 is the root. \n\n2 and 3 are children of 1. \n\n4 is a child of 2. \n\n5 is a child of 4. \n\n6 is a child of 2. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, p_2 is 1 (so node 2's parent is 1). \n\np_3 is 1 (node 3's parent is 1). \n\np_4 is 2 (node4's parent is 2). \n\np_5 is 5? Wait, no. \n\nWait, p_5 is the fifth element in the input (since p_2 is first, p_3 second, etc. \n\nWait, the input for p_2 to p_6 is 1,1,2,5,2. \n\nSo p_2 =1, p_3=1, p_4=2, p_5=5, p_6=2. \n\nWait, p_5 is 5? That can't be, because p_i must be less than i. \n\nWait, p_5 is the fourth element in the list (since the second line has n-1 elements). \n\nWait, for n=6, the second line has 5 numbers: p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6. \n\nSo p_5 is the fourth element. \n\nIn the sample input, the first example's input is:\n\n6\n\n1 1 2 5 2 \n\nWait, that's five numbers. \n\nWait, p_5 is 5? But that would mean the parent of node5 is 5, which is not less than 5. \n\nAh, no, the input for p_5 is 5? That can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, the sample input's first example has the first line as 6, then the second line is 1 1 2 5 2. \n\nWait, p_2 is 1, p_3 is 1, p_4 is 2, p_5 is 5, p_6 is 2. \n\nWait, p_5 is 5, which is less than 5? No, 5 is equal to the node's number. \n\nWait, that's impossible. \n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the input. \n\nWait, the sample input's first example's second line is 1 1 2 5 2. \n\nWait, p_5 is the fourth element, which is 5. \n\nBut node5's parent must be less than 5. \n\nAh, this is a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the input is 1 1 2 4 2. \n\nThen p_5 is 4, which is less than 5. \n\nAh, perhaps I misread the sample input. \n\nThe sample explanation says that in the first example, the structure is such that card5 is hanging onto card4. \n\nSo p_5 is 4. \n\nSo the input for p_5 is 4. \n\nSo the second line would be 1 1 2 4 2. \n\nThen, the code's a array for node5 (index5 in 1-based) would be 4-1=3 (0-based). \n\nSo the children array for node4 (0-based) would include node5. \n\nBut regardless, the code must have a way to track children. \n\nAssuming that the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between its children's f plus 1, then the missing code would be:\n\nfor each node i in reverse order (from n-1 down to 1):\n\n    f[i] = 1  # base case for leaves\n\n    for child in children[i]:\n\n        if f[child] +1 > f[i]:\n\n            f[i] = f[child]+1\n\nBut without the children array, this can't be done. \n\nTherefore, the code must have a children array. \n\nThe code's first loop is missing the code to build the children array. \n\nWait, but the first loop is inside the code. \n\nAh, perhaps the first loop is supposed to build the children array. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to look at its parent and update f[i]. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the f[i] is initialized to 1, and then for each node, the f[i] is the maximum between its current value and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's f value. \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nBut then, the parent's f value would be considered. \n\nWait, but this would be for the parent's contribution. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nBut then, the parent's f value is considered. \n\nWait, but this would be for the path from the root to the node. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut without the children array, this is not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but how to find them? \n\nThe code can loop through all nodes j from i+1 to n and check if a[j] == i. \n\nBut that's O(n^2), which won't work for n=1e5. \n\nThus, the code must have a children array. \n\nTherefore, the first loop's missing code must include building the children array. \n\nBut the code doesn't have that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nWait, let's think of the sample input. \n\nIn the first example, the root is 1. \n\nThe children of 1 are 2 and 3. \n\nThe children of 2 are 4 and 6. \n\nThe children of 4 are 5. \n\nThe children of 5 are none. \n\nThe children of 3 are none. \n\nThe children of 6 are none. \n\nThe f array for each node would be the maximum path length in the subtree. \n\nFor node5, f[5] =1. \n\nNode4's f is max(f[5]+1, ...) \u2192 2. \n\nNode2's f is max(f[4]+1, f[6]+1) \u2192 max(3, 2) \u21923. \n\nNode1's f is max(f[2]+1, f[3]+1) \u2192 max(4, 2) \u21924. \n\nWhich matches the sample's answer of 4. \n\nSo the f array holds the maximum path length in the subtree. \n\nThus, the first loop must compute f[i] as the maximum of f[j] for all children j of i plus 1. \n\nTo do this, the code must have a children array. \n\nTherefore, the first loop's missing code must include building the children array. \n\nBut the code doesn't have that. \n\nAh! The code's first loop is for i in range(n-1,0,-1). \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is for each node i (starting from the end), and the code is supposed to look at its parent and update f[i]. \n\nWait, but that would be for the parent's f value. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to look at its children. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to compute f[i] as 1 plus the maximum f of its children. \n\nBut without the children array, this is not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but how to find them? \n\nThe code can precompute the children array before the first loop. \n\nSo the code should have something like:\n\nchildren = [[] for _ in range(n)]\nfor j in range(2, n+1):\n    p = a[j]\n    children[p].append(j)\n\nBut the code doesn't have this. \n\nTherefore, the first loop's missing code must include this. \n\nBut the first loop is the first place where the a array is used. \n\nWait, the code's first loop is the first loop after the a array is read. \n\nSo the missing code in the first loop is probably the children array's initialization. \n\nWait, but the first loop is inside the code. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nWait, let's see what happens in the sample. \n\nFor node5 (i=5 in 1-based?), the parent is 4. \n\nSo f[5] = f[4] +1? \n\nBut that would be for the path from parent to child. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nBut then, for node5, f[5] would be f[4]+1. \n\nFor node4, f[4] would be f[2]+1. \n\nFor node2, f[2] would be f[1]+1. \n\nFor node1, f[1] is 1. \n\nThis would give f[5] = 1+1+1+1 =4? \n\nNo, that's not right. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nBut then, the f array would represent the longest path from the root to the node. \n\nIn the sample, the longest path from root to node5 is 4 (1-2-4-5), so f[5] would be 4. \n\nBut the sample's answer is 4, which is the maximum f[i] plus 1? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nThen, the second loop propagates the dp values. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut without the children array, this is not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but how to do that in the loop? \n\nThe first loop is iterating over i from n-1 down to 1. \n\nFor each i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nBut j must be greater than i (since a[j] < j). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, a[j] is the parent of j, which is less than j. \n\nSo for node i, the children are all j where a[j] == i. \n\nThus, for each j in the range (i+1, n), if a[j] == i, then j is a child of i. \n\nBut checking this for each i would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nThus, the code must have a children array. \n\nTherefore, the first loop's missing code must include building the children array. \n\nBut the code doesn't have that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but how to do that in the loop? \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is for each node i, and the code is supposed to look at its parent and update f[i]. \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nThen, the f array would represent the longest path from the root to the node. \n\nIn the sample, the longest path is 4 (1-2-4-5), so f[5] is 4. \n\nThe root's f would be 1. \n\nThe second loop then propagates the dp values. \n\nThe final answer is the maximum between dp[0] and f[0]+1. \n\nHmm, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and the f of its children plus 1. \n\nBut without the children array, this is not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is missing code that for each node i, the children are those j where a[j] == i. \n\nWait, but how to track them? \n\nThe code can precompute the children array before the first loop. \n\nSo the missing code in the first loop is the children array's initialization. \n\nBut the first loop is the first loop in the code. \n\nThus, the first loop's missing code must include the children array's initialization. \n\nBut the first loop is inside the code. \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is not the first loop. \n\nThe code has two loops after the first loop. \n\nWait, the code's first loop is the first for loop after the a array is read. \n\nThe code's first loop is:\n\nfor i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n    # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe missing code here must be the computation of f[i] based on its children. \n\nBut without the children array, this is not possible. \n\nThus, the code must have a children array. \n\nTherefore, the first loop's missing code must include building the children array. \n\nBut the code doesn't have that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first loop is supposed to compute f[i] as the maximum between f[i] and f[a[i]] +1. \n\nLet me try to see what happens in the sample. \n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=6 \n\np array is [1,1,2,5,2] (but stored as 0-based). \n\nWait, the a array is [-1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1]. \n\nBecause:\n\na[1] = -1 (node1's parent is none). \n\na[2] = 1-1=0 (parent is node1). \n\na[3] =1-1=0 (parent is node1). \n\na[4] =2-1=1 (parent is node2). \n\na[5] =5-1=4? Wait, no. \n\nWait, the fourth element in the input is p_5. \n\nThe input for p_5 is 5 (assuming the sample's input is as described). \n\nWait, but p_5 must be less than 5. \n\nAh, perhaps the input for p_5 is 4. \n\nThen a[5] =4-1=3 (node4). \n\nSo the children array for node4 (index3) would have node5 (index4). \n\nThen, for node5 (index4), its parent is node4 (index3). \n\nThe children array for node4 (index3) is [5]. \n\nThe first loop processes nodes from 5 down to 1. \n\nFor node5 (i=5 in 1-based?), which is index4 in 0-based. \n\nThe children of node5 are those j where a[j] ==4 (since node5's index is4). \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe children array for node4 (index3) would have node5 (index4). \n\nSo for node5 (index4), its children are none. \n\nThus, f[4] (node5) is 1. \n\nThen node4 (index3) has children [5]. \n\nSo f[3] = max(0, f[4]+1) \u2192 2. \n\nNode2 (index1) has children 4 and 6 (index5). \n\nSo f[1] = max(f[3]+1, f[5]+1) \u2192 max(3, 2) \u21923. \n\nNode1 (index0) has children 1 and 2 (nodes2 and3). \n\nWait, node1's children are nodes2 and3 (indices1 and2). \n\nThus, f[0] = max(f[1]+1, f[2]+1) \u2192 max(4, 2) \u21924. \n\nThe final answer is max(dp[0], f[0]+1). \n\nThe second loop propagates the dp values. \n\nThe second loop is:\n\nfor i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n    dp[i] = max(dp[i], f[i]+1)\n    dp[a[i]] += dp[i]\n\nInitially, dp is all zeros. \n\nStarting with i=5 (0-based index4):\n\ndp[4] = max(0, f[4]+1) \u21921+1=2. \n\nThen, a[4] is3 (node4's parent is node4's parent is node4's parent is node4's parent is node4's parent is node4's parent is
