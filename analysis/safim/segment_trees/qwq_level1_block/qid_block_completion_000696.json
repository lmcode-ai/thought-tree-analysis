So for i=2 (third element, which is position 3 in problem's terms, which is odd), it's checking if it has the same parity as a[0], which is the first element (position 1). So this loop is checking whether all odd indices (since stepping by 2) have the same parity as the first element.

So the code is checking that all odd indices (starting from 0, 2, 4, etc.) have the same parity as the first element. But what about the even indices? The code's current approach is only checking the parity of the odd indices. Because the loop starts at i=2 (third element, which is an odd position in 1-based), and steps by 1? Wait, no, the loop is for i from 2 to lenArray-1, and each step increments i by 1. Wait, no, the loop is written as for (int i=2; i < lenArray; i++), so each step increases i by 1. So the indices being checked are 2,3,4,... So the code is not just checking the odd indices. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the code's current logic is:\n\nres starts as 1. Then, for each i from 2 to lenArray-1 (assuming 0-based), it checks if a[i] &1 equals a[i-2] &1. So for example, for i=2 (third element in 1-based), it compares with a[0], which is first element. Then i=3 (fourth element) compares with a[1], which is second element. Then i=4 (fifth element) compares with a[2], which is third element. So this is checking that every element's parity is same as the element two before. So for the odd indices (0,2,4, etc.), they are compared with previous odds.

Second element (index1, even position2): parity a[1]%2. Third element (index2, position3, odd): parity a[2]%2. Fourth (index3, even position4): a[3]%2. So for i=2 (third element), the code checks a[2] and a[0] (both odd positions). So that's okay. For i=3 (fourth element, even position4), it checks a[3] and a[1] (both even positions). So that's okay. i=4 (fifth element, odd position5) checks a[4] and a[2], which are both odd. So the loop is effectively checking that all elements at odd indices (0,2,4...) have the same parity as the first element (so all odds have same parity), and all even indices (1,3,5...) have same parity as the second element (so all evens have same parity). Because for even indices, like i=3 (index3, even position4), it's compared to a[1], which is the first even element. So the code's current logic is correct in checking that all odds have same parity and all evens have same parity. Wait, but the loop starts at i=2. So for arrays of length 2, like n=2, the loop doesn't run (since i starts at 2 and lenArray is 2, so i<2 is false). So for n=2, the code's res remains 1.

So all odds have same parity (odd), evens have same (odd). So the condition is met. So the code would output yes, which is correct. Another example: array [1,2]. Odds (1) and evens (2). The odds are odd, evens even. So the condition holds (all odds same, evens same). So the code would output yes.",

Wait, let's see:\n\nWe need all elements to be odd. The current parities are O, E, O.\n\nWe can choose x and y such that: For odds (positions 1 and 3):\n\n(1 +x) mod2 =1 \u2192 x mod2=0.\n\n(3 +x) mod2 = (3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 1 +x mod2 =1 \u2192 x mod2=0.

The code has:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < lenArray; i++) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n} So that loop is supposed to read the elements into the vector a.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code so that it correctly determines whether it's possible to make all elements of the array have the same parity after any number of the given operations. Let me start by understanding the problem again.\n\nThe problem says we can perform two types of operations any number of times. The first operation adds 1 to all elements at odd indices (like 1st, 3rd, etc.), and the second adds 1 to even indices (2nd, 4th, etc.). We need to check if after some combination of these operations, all elements become even or all odd.\n\nHmm, so the key is to find out the conditions under which this is possible. Let me think about the parity changes. Each operation affects the parities of certain elements. Let's consider the parity of each element after some operations.\n\nLet me think in terms of how many times each operation is applied. Let's say we perform the first operation (add to odds) x times, and the second (add to evens) y times. Then, for each element's position:\n\n- For an odd index (like 1-based), the number of times it's increased by 1 is x (from the first operation) plus any even operations? Wait no, the even operations don't affect the odd indices. Wait, the first operation affects all odd indices, the second affects even. So for an element at position i (1-based):\n\nIf i is odd: its value is a_i + x (since each first operation adds 1, done x times) plus 0 from the even operations. Wait no, the even operations add to even indices. So for odd indices, only the first operation affects them. So total added is x.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first operation adds 1 to all odd indices each time it's done. So after x times, each odd index gets x added. Similarly, even indices get y added from the second operation done y times.\n\nSo for any element at position i (1-based):\n\nIf i is odd: the total added is x.\n\nIf even: the total added is y.\n\nSo the final value's parity depends on the original a_i plus x or y, depending on the position.\n\nWe need all elements to have the same parity. Let's think in terms of parity. Let me denote the parity of a_i as (a_i mod 2). The final parity of each element will be:\n\nFor odd positions: (a_i + x) mod 2.\n\nFor even positions: (a_i + y) mod 2.\n\nWe want all these to be equal, either all 0 (even) or all 1 (odd).\n\nSo the condition is that for all elements, (a_i + x) mod 2 equals (a_j + (x if j is odd else y)) mod 2 for all j. Wait, perhaps a better way is to set up equations.\n\nLet me think of the desired parity as either all even or all odd. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: All elements must be even.\n\nSo for each element at position i (odd or even):\n\nIf i is odd: (a_i + x) mod 2 == 0 \u2192 (a_i mod 2) + x mod 2 must be 0 mod 2 \u2192 (a_i mod 2) + x \u2261 0 mod 2 \u2192 x \u2261 (-a_i mod 2) mod 2.\n\nSimilarly, for even positions: (a_j + y) mod 2 ==0 \u2192 y \u2261 (-a_j mod 2) mod 2.\n\nSo for all odd positions, x must be congruent to ( -a_i mod 2 ), and for all even positions, y must be congruent to ( -a_j mod 2 ). But since x and y can be any non-negative integers (since you can perform the operations any number of times, including zero), the congruence must hold modulo 2. Because x can be chosen as any number, so the congruence must be consistent across all odd positions and even positions respectively.\n\nWait, but x is the same for all odd positions. So for all odd indices, the required x mod 2 must be the same. Similarly for even indices, the required y mod 2 must be the same.\n\nSo for all odd indices i, (a_i mod 2) must have the same value mod 2 when considering their required x. Let me see:\n\nSuppose for all odd indices, (a_i mod 2) must be such that x \u2261 ( - (a_i mod 2) ) mod 2. But since x is the same for all, all the (a_i mod 2) must have the same required x mod 2. So for all odd indices, (a_i mod 2) must be the same. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for each odd index i, the equation is x \u2261 (-a_i mod 2) mod 2. So all these equations must agree. So for all odd indices i and j, (-a_i mod 2) \u2261 (-a_j mod 2) mod 2 \u2192 a_i mod 2 \u2261 a_j mod 2. So all the a_i at odd indices must have the same parity. Similarly, for even indices, all a_j at even indices must have the same parity. Because for even indices, the required y mod 2 must be the same for all even positions. So for even indices, (a_j mod 2) must all be the same.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So in order for case 1 (all even) to be possible, the following must hold:\n\nAll odd-indexed elements have the same parity, and all even-indexed elements have the same parity. Additionally, the required x and y must satisfy the equations such that when you add x to the odd elements and y to the even, they all become even.\n\nWait, but even more precisely, the required x mod 2 must be the same for all odd elements, and similarly for even elements. So for all odd elements, (a_i mod 2) must be the same. Because if two odd elements have different parities, then their required x mod 2 would be different, which is impossible. So the first condition is that all odd elements have the same parity, and all even elements have the same parity.\n\nWait, but even that's not sufficient. Let me see. Let's say all odd elements have the same parity, and all even elements have the same parity. Then, for case 1 (all even), we can set x to be such that (a_odd + x) mod 2 =0, and y such that (a_even + y) mod 2 =0. Since all odds have same parity, x can be chosen as (even - a_odd mod 2). Similarly for y. So that's possible.\n\nSimilarly for case 2 (all odd), the required equations would be (a_i +x) mod2 =1 for odds, and (a_j +y) mod2 =1 for evens. So again, the same conditions on the parities of the original elements.\n\nWait, so the necessary and sufficient condition for the problem is that either:\n\nEither:\n\nAll the odd-indexed elements have the same parity, and all even-indexed elements have the same parity, and the difference between the parities of the odd and even elements can be adjusted via x and y.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the difference between the parities of the first odd and first even elements must allow for some x and y to make all same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of (a_odd + x) must equal the parity of (a_even + y). Because all odds must have same parity as evens in the final array.\n\nWait, in the problem, the final array must be all even or all odd. So for case 1 (all even), the parity of (a_odd +x) must be even, and (a_even + y) must also be even. So (a_odd +x) mod2 =0 and (a_even + y) mod2=0. So x must be -a_odd mod2, and y must be -a_even mod2. But also, the parity of (a_odd +x) must equal (a_even + y) mod2, which in this case they are both 0, so that's okay.\n\nBut for the case where all are odd, then (a_odd +x) mod2 =1, and (a_even + y) mod2=1. So x must be (1 - a_odd mod2), and y must be (1 - a_even mod2).\n\nBut in both cases, the key is that the required x mod2 and y mod2 must be consistent. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the problem allows any number of operations, so x and y can be any non-negative integers. So their mod2 can be chosen as needed. So the only constraints are that:\n\nFor all odd indices, their a_i mod2 must be the same. Because otherwise, the required x mod2 would have to satisfy conflicting equations. For example, if two odd elements have different parities, then x mod2 must be both (say) 0 and 1, which is impossible. So all odd elements must have the same parity. Similarly, all even elements must have the same parity.\n\nAdditionally, the parity of the odd elements plus x must equal the desired parity (either even or odd), and similarly for the even elements plus y. But since x and y can be chosen, the only constraint is that the desired parity for the odds and evens must be the same. Wait, but the desired parity for all elements must be the same. So the parity of (a_odd +x) must equal the parity of (a_even + y). Since x and y can be chosen, this can be arranged as long as the difference between the required parities can be adjusted via x and y.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me suppose that all odd elements have the same parity (say, p_odd) and all even elements have the same parity (p_even). Then, to make all elements even:\n\nWe need:\n\np_odd + x \u2261 0 mod2 \u2192 x \u2261 -p_odd mod2\n\np_even + y \u22610 mod2 \u2192 y \u2261 -p_even mod2\n\nSo x and y can be chosen as such. So this is possible as long as the required x and y can be set. Since x and y can be any numbers, their mod2 can be set as needed. So this is possible.\n\nSimilarly, to make all elements odd:\n\np_odd +x \u22611 mod2 \u2192 x \u2261 (1-p_odd) mod2\n\np_even + y \u22611 mod2 \u2192 y \u2261 (1-p_even) mod2\n\nAgain, possible as long as x and y can be set. So the only constraints are that all odds have same parity, and all evens have same parity. Because then, regardless of their parities, you can choose x and y to adjust to the desired parity (either even or odd for all).\n\nWait, but what if the parities of the odds and evens are different? Let's see:\n\nSuppose all odds are even (p_odd=0), and all evens are odd (p_even=1). Then, to make all even:\n\nWe need x mod2 =0 (so x even), and y mod2=1 (so y odd). So possible. Then, the odds become even (0+0=0 mod2), evens become 1 +1 mod2=0. So all even.\n\nAlternatively, to make all odd: x mod2 must be 1 (so odds become 0+1=1 mod2), and y mod2 must be 0 (so evens 1+0=1 mod2). So that works.\n\nSo in this case, it's possible.\n\nWait, so the only condition is that all odds have same parity, and all evens have same parity. Then, regardless of their relation, you can choose x and y to make all even or all odd.\n\nWait, but what if the parities of the odds and evens are already the same? Like all odds are even and evens are even. Then you can choose x=0 and y=0, so all even. So that's okay.\n\nHmm, so the conclusion is that the answer is \"YES\" if and only if all the elements at odd indices have the same parity, and all elements at even indices have the same parity. Because then, you can choose x and y to adjust both groups to the desired parity (either even or odd).\n\nWait, but let me test this with the sample inputs given in the problem's note.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nSample 1: [1,2,1]\n\nOriginal array: indices 1 (odd), 2 (even), 3 (odd).\n\nThe odd indices (1 and 3) have a1=1 (odd), a3=1 (odd) \u2192 same parity. Even index (2) has a2=2 (even). So all odds same, evens same. So answer is yes. Which matches the note.\n\nSecond sample: the second test case's answer is no. Let's see why. Suppose in that case, the array has odds with different parities or evens with different.\n\nSuppose the array is like [1, 3, 2]. Then the odds (1 and 3) are 1 (odd) and 2 (even). So their parities differ. So the condition fails \u2192 answer no. Which matches the note.\n\nThird test case: all elements already have same parity. So odds and evens each have same parity (since all same). So yes.\n\nFourth test case: let's see. The array is [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. The odds (positions 1,3,5) are 1000 (even), 1000 (even), 1000 (even). Evens (positions 2,4) are 0 (even) and 0 (even). So all same. So yes. But the note says they used the first operation once. So after adding 1 to odds, they become 1001 (odd), etc. So all odds become 1001, evens remain 0. Wait, but in that case, the evens are even (0) and odds are odd. So the final array would have mixed parities. Wait, but the note says they made all odd. Wait, maybe the original array was different. Let me check the note's fourth example:\n\nThe note says: \"fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all elements at odd positions by 1, thus obtaining the array [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001], and all elements become odd so the answer is YES.\"\n\nAh, so the original array must have been [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. The odds (positions 1,3,5) are even, evens (2,4) are even. So all same. So the condition holds. So yes.\n\nSo the condition seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to checking whether all elements at odd indices have the same parity, and all elements at even indices have the same parity.\n\nIf that's true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo the code needs to check this condition.\n\nNow, looking at the given code:\n\nThe code reads the array, but in the loop for reading the elements, there's a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". So the first missing part is to read the elements into the vector a.\n\nThe next part is the loop:\n\nfor (int i = 2; i < lenArray; i++) {\n    res &= ((a.at(i) & 1) == (a.at(i - 2) & 1));\n}\n\nWait, the initial res is 1. Then, for each i starting at 2, it checks if the current element's parity is equal to the element two before. So for example, for i=2 (third element, since 0-based?), but wait, the array is 1-based in the problem, but in code, the vector is 0-based. Wait, in the code, the vector a is 0-based. So the first element is a[0], which is the first element of the array (position 1 in the problem's terms). So the code is checking for the parity of a[i] (0-based) and a[i-2]. So for i=2 (third element, which is position 3 in problem's terms, which is odd), it's checking if it has the same parity as a[0], which is the first element (position 1). So this loop is checking whether all odd indices (since stepping by 2) have the same parity as the first element. Similarly, for even indices?\n\nWait, but the code's loop starts at i=2, so for the third element (index 2 in 0-based, which is the third element, which is an odd position in the problem's 1-based numbering). So the code is checking that all odd indices (starting from 0, 2, 4, etc.) have the same parity as the first element. But what about the even indices?\n\nThe code's current approach is only checking the parity of the odd indices. Because the loop starts at i=2 (third element, which is an odd position in 1-based), and steps by 1? Wait, no, the loop is for i from 2 to lenArray-1, and each step increments i by 1. Wait, no, the loop is written as for (int i=2; i < lenArray; i++), so each step increases i by 1. So the indices being checked are 2,3,4,... So the code is not just checking the odd indices. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the code's current logic is:\n\nres starts as 1. Then, for each i from 2 to lenArray-1 (assuming 0-based), it checks if a[i] &1 equals a[i-2] &1. So for example, for i=2 (third element in 1-based), it compares with a[0], which is first element. Then i=3 (fourth element) compares with a[1], which is second element. Then i=4 (fifth element) compares with a[2], which is third element. So this is checking that every element's parity is same as the element two before. So for the odd indices (0,2,4, etc.), they are compared with previous odds. For even indices (1,3,5), they are compared with previous evens?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTake the first element (index 0, odd position 1): parity is a[0]%2.\n\nSecond element (index1, even position2): parity a[1]%2.\n\nThird element (index2, position3, odd): parity a[2]%2.\n\nFourth (index3, even position4): a[3]%2.\n\nSo for i=2 (third element), the code checks a[2] and a[0] (both odd positions). So that's okay.\n\nFor i=3 (fourth element, even position4), it checks a[3] and a[1] (both even positions). So that's okay.\n\ni=4 (fifth element, odd position5) checks a[4] and a[2], which are both odd.\n\nSo the loop is effectively checking that all elements at odd indices (0,2,4...) have the same parity as the first element (so all odds have same parity), and all even indices (1,3,5...) have same parity as the second element (so all evens have same parity). Because for even indices, like i=3 (index3, even position4), it's compared to a[1], which is the first even element. So the code's current logic is correct in checking that all odds have same parity and all evens have same parity.\n\nWait, but the loop starts at i=2. So for arrays of length 2, like n=2, the loop doesn't run (since i starts at 2 and lenArray is 2, so i<2 is false). So for n=2, the code's res remains 1. Then, the code outputs \"Yes\".\n\nWait, but let's see for n=2. Suppose the array is [1,3]. Then the odds (index0) is 1 (odd), evens (index1) is 3 (odd). So all odds have same parity (odd), evens have same (odd). So the condition is met. So the code would output yes, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1,2]. Odds (1) and evens (2). The odds are odd, evens even. So the condition holds (all odds same, evens same). So the code would output yes. Because the code's res is 1 (since the loop doesn't run). So the code would output yes, which is correct because you can perform the even operation once (adding 1 to even indices, making evens 3, so both are odd).\n\nWait, but according to the code's logic, for n=2, the code would output \"Yes\" because res is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1,2,3]. The odds are 1 and 3 (both odd), evens 2 (even). So the code's loop runs for i=2 (third element, index2). It checks a[2] (3 mod2=1) and a[0] (1 mod2=1 \u2192 same. So res remains 1. Then, the code outputs yes. Which is correct because you can do the even operation once (adding 1 to even indices, making 2\u21923. So array becomes [1+0 (since x?), wait let me think again.\n\nWait, the operations can be done any number of times. Let me see:\n\nWe need to make all elements even or all odd.\n\nCurrent array is [1,2,3]. Let's see:\n\nTo make all odd:\n\nWe can do first operation (add 1 to odds) once. Then odds (positions 1 and 3) become 2 and 4. Wait, no, original a1 is 1 (position1, odd). Adding 1 gives 2 (even). Hmm, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe adding even operations.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe need all elements to be odd. The current parities are O, E, O.\n\nWe can choose x and y such that:\n\nFor odds (positions 1 and 3):\n\n(1 +x) mod2 =1 \u2192 x mod2=0.\n\n(3 +x) mod2 = (3 mod2 is 1 \u2192 1 +x mod2 =1 \u2192 x mod2=0.\n\nFor evens (position2):\n\n(2 + y) mod2 =1 \u2192 y mod2=1.\n\nSo x even, y odd. So possible. So after x=0, y=1:\n\nOdds: 1+0=1 (odd), 3+0=3 (odd).\n\nEvens: 2+1=3 (odd). So all odd. So yes.\n\nSo the code's output would be yes, which is correct.\n\nSo the code's current logic seems correct. Wait, but the code's loop is for i from 2 to lenArray-1, and the initial res is 1. So the code is checking that all elements (both odds and evens) have the same parity as their two steps back. Which ensures that all odds are same and all evens are same.\n\nWait, but what if the array has length 4, and the even indices have varying parities?\n\nLike array [1,2,3,4]. The even indices (positions 2 and 4, which are indices1 and 3 in 0-based) are 2 (even) and 4 (even). So their parities are same. The code's loop for i=3 (index3, which is even position4) would check a[3] (4 mod2=0) and a[1] (2 mod2=0 \u2192 same. So res remains 1. So code outputs yes. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example where evens have different parities: array [1,2,3,5]. The evens are 2 (even) and 5 (odd). So their parities differ. Let's see:\n\nThe code's loop for i=3 (index3, which is even position4) would check a[3] (5 mod2=1) vs a[1] (2 mod2=0 \u2192 different. So res becomes 0. So code outputs no, which is correct.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct. But wait, the code's current output is \"Yes\" if res is 1, else \"No\". So that's exactly the condition we need. So the code is correct except for the missing part of reading the array.\n\nWait, the code's first missing part is in the loop where the elements are read. The code has:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < lenArray; i++) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo that loop is supposed to read the elements into the vector a. So the missing code here is:\n\nstd::cin >> a[i];\n\nSo that's the first missing part.\n\nThe second missing part is in the output. The problem says to output \"YES\" or \"NO\", but the code currently outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\". So the code's output is in lowercase, but the problem allows any case. However, the problem's sample outputs probably expect uppercase. Wait, the problem says \"you can output the answer in any case\". So the code's current output is \"Yes\" and \"No\", which is acceptable. Wait, the problem's note's examples have outputs like \"YES\", but the code's current code outputs \"Yes\" which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but looking at the code's output:\n\nif (res) {\n    std::cout << \"Yes\" << std::endl;\n} else {\n    std::cout << \"No\" << std::endl;\n}\n\nSo the code outputs \"Yes\" or \"No\", which is acceptable. The problem allows any case, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the only missing code is the line to read the elements into the array. So the code inside the for loop for reading the array should be:\n\nstd::cin >> a[i];\n\nSo the missing code is that line.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The code's vector is declared as std::vector<int> a(lenArray); then in the loop, for each i from 0 to lenArray-1, we need to read a[i]. So yes, the missing code is std::cin >> a[i];.\n\nTherefore, the code should be filled with that line."
