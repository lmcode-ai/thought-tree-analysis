So whenever the current_sum is zero after processing each element, we can count it. Wait, let's see:\n\nInitialize current_sum = 0, answer = 0. For each element a[i] in the array:\n\n- If a[i] is zero:\n\n   - We can set it to x such that current_sum + x = 0 \u2192 x = -current_sum. - So after setting, the new current_sum is 0. \n\n   - So after this step, the current_sum is zero, so we add 1 to the answer. \n\n- Else:\n\n   - current_sum += a[i]\n\n   - If current_sum is zero, add 1 to the answer. Wait, but this approach would only count the current index if the current_sum is zero. Wait, but in the first example, let's walk through this:\n\nOriginal array: [2,0,1,-1,0]\n\nProcessing each element:\n\ni=0 (element 2):\n\nNot zero. current_sum +=2 \u2192 2. Not zero \u2192 answer remains 0.\n\ni=1 (element 0):\n\nSet to -current_sum (which is -2). Now current_sum becomes 0. So answer +=1 \u2192 answer is 1.\n\ni=2 (element 1): Add to current_sum \u2192 0 +1 =1. Not zero \u2192 answer remains 1.\n\ni=3 (element -1):\n\nAdd \u2192 1-1=0 \u2192 current_sum is 0 \u2192 answer +=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\ni=4 (element 0):\n\nSet to -current_sum (which is 0 \u2192 so set to 0. current_sum remains 0 \u2192 answer +=1 \u2192 total 3. \n\nWhich matches the example. Another test case: second example in the problem:\n\nInput array [0, 2000000000]\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0 (0):\n\nSet to -current_sum (0 \u2192 so set to 0. current_sum becomes 0 \u2192 answer 1.\n\ni=1 (2000000000): Add to current_sum \u2192 0 + 2e9 \u2192 not zero. So total is 1. Which matches the example's output of 1. Third test case: array [0,0,0]. Processing:\n\ni=0: set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 answer 1.\n\ni=1: set to -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 answer 2.\n\ni=2: set to -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 answer 3. Which would be the maximum possible. This seems to work. So the algorithm is: Initialize current_sum =0, ans=0. For each element in the array:\n\n   if element is 0:\n\n      set it to -current_sum \u2192 so current_sum becomes 0. \n\n      ans +=1 (since current_sum is now zero)\n\n   else:\n\n      current_sum += element\n\n      if current_sum ==0 \u2192 ans +=1\n\nWait, but in the case where the element is non-zero, after adding it to current_sum, if the sum is zero, we count it. This approach would give the maximum possible score. Wait, but why is this the case?",

The code's current code after the if-else block has:\n\nif(mp.get(need) > fokat){\n\n   val = need;\n\n   fokat = mp.get(need);\n\n} But this would require that after updating the count, we check. Alternatively, after updating the count (whether it was present or not), we can check. So the code inside the loop for j should be:\n\nlong need = pre_sum[j] + temp;\n\nif (mp.containsKey(need)) {\n\n    int cnt = mp.get(need) + 1;\n\n    mp.put(need, cnt);\n\n} else {\n\n    mp.put(need, 1);\n\n    cnt = 1;\n\n}\n\n// then check if cnt > fokat:\n\nif (cnt > fokat) {\n\n    val = need;\n\n    fokat = cnt;\n\n}\n\nWait, but how to get the current count after the update. Alternatively, after updating the map, we can get the current count and compare. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\nlong need = pre_sum[j] + temp;\n\nint cnt = 1;\n\nif (mp.containsKey(need)) {\n\n    cnt = mp.get(need) + 1;\n\n    mp.put(need, cnt);\n\n} else {\n\n    mp.put(need, 1);\n\n} if (cnt > fokat) {\n\n    val = need;\n\n    fokat = cnt;\n\n}\n\nThis way, after updating the count for 'need', we check if it's the new maximum. Thus, the code's missing part is to increment the count and update val and fokat if needed. The code's current TODO is inside the if (mp contains need) block. So the code inside the if block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nand then, after that, check if the new count is larger than fokat. Alternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nif (mp.containsKey(need)) {\n\n    int currentCount = mp.get(need);\n\n    mp.put(need, currentCount + 1);\n\n    if (currentCount + 1 > fokat) {\n\n        val = need;\n\n        fokat = currentCount + 1;\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    mp.put(need, 1);\n\n    if (1 > fokat) { // which is only possible if fokat was 0, but initially fokat is 1.\n\n        // but initially, val is set to pre_sum[i]+temp, which is the first need (j=i?)\n\n        // perhaps this is not needed.\n\n    }\n\n} Wait, but the initial 'val' is set to pre_sum[i]+temp (the need for j=i). The first j is i+1, so the first need is for j=i+1. The initial fokat is 1 (from the initial val). Wait, the initial val is pre_sum[i]+temp \u2192 which is the need for j=i. But j starts from i+1. Hmm, perhaps the initial val is for j=i, but the loop starts at j=i+1. Wait, the code's initial val is pre_sum[i]+temp \u2192 which is the need for j=i. But the loop for j starts at i+1. So the initial val is for j=i. The code's initial fokat is 1 (count for that need). Then, for each j from i+1 to next zero, the code processes their needs. Thus, the code's initial val is the need for j=i, which is counted as 1. Then, for each j, the code processes their need and updates the count. The maximum count among all these needs (including j=i) is tracked in fokat.",

Alternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nif (mp.containsKey(need)) {\n\n    int cnt = mp.get(need) + 1;\n\n    mp.put(need, cnt);\n\n    if (cnt > fokat) {\n\n        val = need;\n\n        fokat = cnt;\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    mp.put(need, 1);\n\n    if (1 > fokat) { // this is only possible if fokat is 0, but initially it's 1.\n\n        // so this block is not needed.\n\n    }\n\n} But since the initial fokat is 1, the else block won't trigger. Thus, the code inside the if block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nint cnt = mp.get(need);\n\nif (cnt > fokat) {\n\n    val = need;\n\n    fokat = cnt;\n\n} So the missing code is:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nand then the check. Therefore, the code inside the if (mp contains need) block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nand then the code after the if-else block should check the count. Wait, but the code's current structure is:\n\nif (mp contains need):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   mp.put(need,1);\n\nThen, after that, the code has:\n\nif(mp.get(need) > fokat){\n\n    val=need;\n\n    fokat=mp.get(need);\n\n} Wait, but this code is outside the if-else block. Wait, the code's current code after the if-else block has:\n\nif(mp.get(need) > fokat){\n\n    val=need;\n\n    fokat=mp.get(need);\n\n} But this is inside the loop over j. \n\nWait, the code's current code after the if-else block has:\n\nif(mp.get(need) > fokat){\n\n    val=need;\n\n    fokat=mp.get(need);\n\n} So, after either branch of the if-else, this code is executed. Thus, the code inside the if block (when need is present) should do the increment, and then the code after will check. The code inside the if block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nThen, the code after the if-else block will get the current count (mp.get(need)), which is now incremented. Thus, the missing code is simply:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1); So the code inside the if block is to increment the count. The rest of the code (the if statement after) will handle updating val and fokat. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1); So the code inside the if block is that line. Therefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1); Thus, the missing code is that line. Testing this logic:\n\nIn the first example, when processing the second element (i=1, which is zero):\n\nThe initial val is pre_sum[1] + temp. pre_sum[1] is 2 (original array's first element is 2, second is 0 \u2192 pre_sum[1] = 2+0=2. temp is initially 0. So val = 2+0 =2. Then, the loop for j starts at i+1=2. \n\nj=2 (element 1):\n\nneed = pre_sum[2] + temp \u2192 pre_sum[2] is 2+0+1=3 \u2192 3 +0 =3. Since not in the map (initial map has val=2 with count 1), so add to map. Then, check if 1> fokat (which is 1 \u2192 no. \n\nj=3 (element -1):\n\nneed = pre_sum[3] + temp \u2192 pre_sum[3] is 2+0+1-1=2 \u2192 2+0=2. Now, need is 2, which is in the map (count 1). So in the if block, we do mp.put(2, 2). Then, after the if-else, check if 2>1 \u2192 yes. So val becomes 2, fokat becomes 2. \n\nj=4 (element 0 \u2192 break loop. Thus, after the loop, val is 2. So arr[i] (i=1) is set to -2. temp becomes 0 + (-2) \u2192 -2. Then, the code proceeds. The next elements are processed with the new temp. This seems correct. Thus, the missing code is the line inside the if block: \n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to maximize the score of the array after replacing zeros with arbitrary integers. The score is the number of indices where the prefix sum up to that index is zero. \n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves looking at the prefix sums and figuring out where to place the zeros optimally. The code provided seems to be trying some approach with a loop over each element, especially when it's zero. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nLooking at the existing code: \n\nThe code reads the array and computes the prefix sums. Then, for each element in the array, if it's zero, it does some processing with a HashMap. The idea might be to track possible target values for the current zero so that the prefix sums can hit zero at certain points. \n\nWait, the problem allows replacing a zero with any integer. So whenever we encounter a zero, we can choose a value for it such that it helps in maximizing the number of prefix sums that are zero. \n\nThe existing code's loop for when arr[i] is zero is a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nInside the loop over each element i:\n- If arr[i] is zero, then they create a HashMap and set val to pre_sum[i] + temp. Then they start a loop from j = i+1 to n-1. \n\nWait, temp is some accumulated value? Maybe temp is the sum of changes made so far? Because when they set arr[i] to -val, they add that to temp. \n\nThe inner loop for j starts at i+1. The code checks if arr[j] is zero, which would break the loop. So perhaps they are trying to look ahead until the next zero? \n\nThe need variable is pre_sum[j] + temp. The idea might be that when choosing the value for the current zero (at i), we can set it such that the prefix sums up to j can be zero. \n\nBut I'm not sure exactly how the current code is handling this. Let me think of the example given in the problem. \n\nIn the first example, the array after modification has a score of 3. The steps involved setting a_2 to -2. The prefix sums at 2, 4, and 5 are zero. \n\nThe code's approach might be trying to track possible target values for the current zero so that choosing a value here can create multiple zeros in the prefix sums. \n\nLooking at the code's inner loop for j from i+1 to n-1:\n\nThey compute 'need' as pre_sum[j] + temp. Then, if the current 'need' is in the map, they do something. Else, they add it to the map. \n\nWait, the initial 'val' is pre_sum[i] + temp. The first entry in the map is val with count 1. Then for each j, they compute need = pre_sum[j] + temp. \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that when choosing the value for the current zero (at i), we can set it such that the prefix sum up to i becomes some value, and then the subsequent prefix sums can be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to find a value for the current zero such that the number of times the prefix sum reaches zero is maximized. \n\nWait, the code's current approach might be trying to track possible \"targets\" for the current zero's value. For instance, when we set arr[i] to a certain value, the prefix sum up to i becomes (pre_sum[i] - original a[i] + new value). Since the original a[i] was zero, the new value is whatever we choose. \n\nWait, the original a[i] is zero, so when we replace it with x, the new prefix sum up to i is (pre_sum[i] - 0 + x) = pre_sum[i] + x. \n\nThe goal is to choose x such that this new prefix sum can lead to as many zeros as possible in the subsequent prefix sums. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the best x (the value to set at i) such that the number of j's (after i) where the new prefix sum up to j equals zero is maximized. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track for each possible x (the value chosen for the current zero), how many times the prefix sums can hit zero. \n\nBut the current code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me think of the variables:\n\nThe 'temp' variable is being used to track the accumulated changes made so far. Because when you set arr[i] to some value, you add that to temp. \n\nWait, the code does:\n\narr[i] = -val;\ntemp += arr[i];\n\nSo the temp is the sum of all the changes made so far. Because when you replace a zero (originally 0) with x, the difference is x - 0 = x. So the total change added to the prefix sums from that point onward is x. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'temp' variable is the total adjustment made so far. \n\nThe pre_sum array is the original prefix sums. So when we make changes, the actual prefix sum up to i would be pre_sum[i] + temp (since temp is the sum of all changes made before or at i). \n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Because each change affects the prefix sums from that point onward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'temp' variable is the cumulative adjustment up to the current position. \n\nThe code's approach for handling a zero at position i is:\n\n- We can choose a value x for arr[i], which will affect the prefix sums from i onwards. \n\nThe goal is to choose x such that the number of indices j >= i where the adjusted prefix sum up to j is zero is maximized. \n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Let's consider that when we have a zero at position i, we can choose x (the new value) such that:\n\nThe new prefix sum up to i is S_i + x (where S_i is the original prefix sum up to i, since the original a[i] was zero, so the original contribution was zero, and now it's x). \n\nThen, for the next positions j > i, the new prefix sum up to j would be S_j + x + (sum of changes made to positions after i but before j). \n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe the optimal approach is to greedily choose x for each zero such that it allows as many subsequent prefix sums to be zero as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible score is the number of times the prefix sum can be zero, considering that we can set zeros to any value. \n\nWait, the key insight here might be that whenever there's a zero in the array, we can choose its value to \"reset\" the prefix sum to zero at that point, and then also possibly at later points. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nThe maximum possible score is the maximum number of times the prefix sum can be zero, considering that we can set any zero in the array to any value. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing values for the zeros such that the number of indices where the prefix sum is zero is maximized. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal way is to set the zeros in such a way that the prefix sum can be zero at as many points as possible. \n\nLet me think of the prefix sum array. Let's denote the original prefix sums as S_0, S_1, ..., S_n (with S_0 = 0). Wait, actually, the problem's prefix sum starts at a_1. Wait, the problem says the score is the number of indices i (1-based) where the sum from a_1 to a_i is zero. \n\nWait, the original array's prefix sum up to i (1-based) is S_i = a_1 + ... + a_i. \n\nWhen we can replace zeros in the array with any value, the new array's prefix sums can be adjusted. \n\nThe goal is to choose the values for the zeros such that as many S'_i (the new prefix sums) are zero as possible. \n\nThe key idea here is that whenever there is a zero in the array, we can choose its value to adjust the prefix sum up to that point. \n\nSuppose we have a zero at position i. Let's say before this position, the current prefix sum (after previous adjustments) is P. Then, by choosing the value x for this zero, the new prefix sum up to i becomes P + x. \n\nWe can set x to whatever we want. So, to make the prefix sum at i zero, we can set x = -P. \n\nBut then, the next prefix sums will be built on this new value. \n\nThe challenge is to choose these x's in a way that maximizes the total number of zeros in the new prefix sums. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal approach is to make as many of the prefix sums zero as possible by setting the zeros in such a way that whenever possible, the prefix sum at that point is zero, and also allows subsequent points to also be zero. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible score is the number of times the prefix sum can be zero, considering that whenever there's a zero in the array, we can choose its value to \"reset\" the current sum to whatever we want. \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nThe maximum possible score is the number of times the prefix sum can be zero, which can be as high as the number of zeros in the array plus some existing zeros. Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible score is the maximum number of indices where the prefix sum can be zero, which can be up to n (if all prefix sums are zero). But that's only possible if we can set the array such that each prefix sum is zero. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the process step by step. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Whenever we encounter a zero, we can choose its value to set the current prefix sum to zero. Then, the next elements can be adjusted similarly. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nWe can track the current \"target\" for the prefix sum. Let's say that whenever we have a zero, we can set it so that the prefix sum up to that point is zero. Then, the next elements can be adjusted to allow the next prefix sums to also be zero. \n\nBut how does this work?\n\nLet me think of the example given in the first test case:\n\nOriginal array: [2, 0, 1, -1, 0]\n\nThe optimal solution is to set the second element (0) to -2, making the array [2, -2, 1, -1, 0]. The prefix sums are:\n\nAfter 1: 2 \u2192 not zero.\n\nAfter 2: 0 \u2192 count 1.\n\nAfter 3: 1 \u2192 not.\n\nAfter 4: 0 \u2192 count 2.\n\nAfter 5: 0 \u2192 count 3.\n\nSo the zeros are at positions 2,4,5. \n\nWait, but how was that achieved? The second element was set to -2 so that the sum up to 2 is zero. Then, the third element is 1, so the sum up to 3 is 1. The fourth is -1, so sum up to 4 is 0. The fifth is 0, so we can set it to 0 (or any value that makes the total sum zero). \n\nWait, the fifth element is zero, so we can set it to whatever. To make the total sum zero, we set it to 0. \n\nSo the key idea is that whenever there's a zero in the array, we can choose its value to set the current prefix sum to zero, which allows subsequent elements to also contribute to more zeros. \n\nSo the strategy is to greedily set each zero to a value that allows the current prefix sum to be zero, thereby maximizing the number of zeros. \n\nBut how do we track this?\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nWe can track the current \"required\" value for the next zero. \n\nAlternatively, here's an algorithm idea:\n\nInitialize a variable current_sum = 0. \n\nWe iterate through the array from left to right. \n\nAt each position i:\n\n- If the current element is not zero, then we have no choice but to keep it as is. So we add it to current_sum. \n\n- If the current element is zero, then we can choose its value. We want to choose it such that the current_sum plus this value equals zero. So we set the value to -current_sum. This way, the current_sum becomes zero. \n\n- Then, we add this chosen value to current_sum (which becomes zero). \n\n- Additionally, whenever the current_sum is zero, we can increment the answer. \n\nWait, but this might not account for all possibilities. Let me see:\n\nWait, the answer counts all indices where the prefix sum is zero. So whenever the current_sum is zero after processing each element, we can count it. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitialize current_sum = 0, answer = 0.\n\nFor each element a[i] in the array:\n\n- If a[i] is zero:\n\n   - We can set it to x such that current_sum + x = 0 \u2192 x = -current_sum. \n\n   - So after setting, the new current_sum is 0. \n\n   - So after this step, the current_sum is zero, so we add 1 to the answer. \n\n- Else:\n\n   - current_sum += a[i]\n\n   - If current_sum is zero, add 1 to the answer. \n\nWait, but this approach would only count the current index if the current_sum is zero. \n\nWait, but in the first example, let's walk through this:\n\nOriginal array: [2,0,1,-1,0]\n\nProcessing each element:\n\ni=0 (element 2):\n\nNot zero. current_sum +=2 \u2192 2. Not zero \u2192 answer remains 0.\n\ni=1 (element 0):\n\nSet to -current_sum (which is -2). Now current_sum becomes 0. So answer +=1 \u2192 answer is 1.\n\ni=2 (element 1):\n\nAdd to current_sum \u2192 0 +1 =1. Not zero \u2192 answer remains 1.\n\ni=3 (element -1):\n\nAdd \u2192 1-1=0 \u2192 current_sum is 0 \u2192 answer +=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\ni=4 (element 0):\n\nSet to -current_sum (which is 0 \u2192 so set to 0. current_sum remains 0 \u2192 answer +=1 \u2192 total 3. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nAnother test case: second example in the problem:\n\nInput array [0, 2000000000]\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0 (0):\n\nSet to -current_sum (0 \u2192 so set to 0. current_sum becomes 0 \u2192 answer 1.\n\ni=1 (2000000000):\n\nAdd to current_sum \u2192 0 + 2e9 \u2192 not zero. So total is 1. Which matches the example's output of 1. \n\nThird test case: array [0,0,0]. \n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 answer 1.\n\ni=1: set to -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 answer 2.\n\ni=2: set to -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 answer 3. \n\nWhich would be the maximum possible. \n\nThis seems to work. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_sum =0, ans=0.\n\nFor each element in the array:\n\n   if element is 0:\n\n      set it to -current_sum \u2192 so current_sum becomes 0. \n\n      ans +=1 (since current_sum is now zero)\n\n   else:\n\n      current_sum += element\n\n      if current_sum ==0 \u2192 ans +=1\n\nWait, but in the case where the element is non-zero, after adding it to current_sum, if the sum is zero, we count it. \n\nThis approach would give the maximum possible score. \n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because whenever we have a zero, we can choose to set it such that the current_sum becomes zero, which gives us a point. Then, proceeding further, any subsequent elements can contribute to more points if their addition brings the sum back to zero. \n\nThis seems to be the optimal approach. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the array, then iterate through each element, keeping track of current_sum and ans. \n\nBut the problem is that the code provided in the question is not following this approach. The existing code is trying a different approach with hashmaps and temp variables, which might be more complicated. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to implement this greedy method. \n\nWait, but the problem allows us to perform multiple operations. So we can replace any zero with any value, not just once. But in the greedy approach above, we are replacing each zero once, which is allowed. \n\nWait, the problem says you can perform the operation multiple times. But each operation can only replace a zero with some value. So you can choose to replace a zero multiple times, but each time you can set it to any value. However, the optimal choice would be to set it once to the best possible value, since subsequent changes would just overwrite it. \n\nTherefore, the greedy approach of setting each zero to -current_sum as we go through the array is optimal. \n\nSo the code should be straightforward. \n\nBut the existing code in the problem is not doing this. The code provided is trying a different approach, perhaps with some backtracking or considering multiple possibilities. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is more complex. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the greedy approach I thought of may not always work. Let me see another example. \n\nSuppose the array is [0, 0]. \n\nGreedy approach:\n\nFirst element (0) is set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 ans 1. \n\nSecond element (0) is set to -0 \u2192 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 ans 2. \n\nTotal 2, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: [0, -1, 0]. \n\nGreedy approach:\n\nFirst zero set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 ans 1. \n\nSecond element is -1 \u2192 current_sum becomes -1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nThird zero: set to -current_sum (1) \u2192 current_sum becomes 0 \u2192 ans +=1 \u2192 total 2. \n\nBut what if we set the first zero to 1, then the second element is -1 \u2192 sum becomes 0 (1-1=0), then third zero set to 0 \u2192 sum 0. \n\nThen the prefix sums would be:\n\nAfter first: 1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nAfter second: 0 \u2192 count 1. \n\nAfter third: 0 \u2192 count 2. \n\nSo total 2 again. \n\nHmm, same result. \n\nAnother example: [0, 3, -3, 0]. \n\nGreedy approach:\n\nFirst zero set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 ans 1. \n\nSecond element 3 \u2192 current_sum 3 \u2192 not zero. \n\nThird element -3 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 ans 2. \n\nFourth zero set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 ans 3. \n\nTotal 3. \n\nAlternatively, if we set first zero to -3, then:\n\nAfter first: -3 \u2192 current_sum -3. \n\nSecond element 3 \u2192 sum 0 \u2192 ans 1. \n\nThird element -3 \u2192 sum -3 \u2192 not. \n\nFourth zero set to 3 \u2192 sum 0 \u2192 ans 2. \n\nSo the greedy approach gives a better result. \n\nSo the greedy approach seems to work. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to process each element, and whenever you hit a zero, set it to -current_sum, which allows the current prefix sum to be zero, and then proceed. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nInitialize current_sum =0, ans=0.\n\nLoop over each element in the array:\n\n   if element is 0:\n\n      ans +=1\n\n      current_sum =0\n\n   else:\n\n      current_sum += element\n\n      if current_sum ==0:\n\n          ans +=1\n\nWait, but wait, when the element is zero, we set it to -current_sum, so the new current_sum is 0. \n\nWait, the code above does that implicitly. \n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nWhen the element is zero, we can choose to set it to -current_sum, so the new current_sum is 0. \n\nThus, the current_sum becomes 0, and we add 1 to the answer (since the prefix sum up to this index is zero). \n\nThen, for the next elements, the current_sum starts from 0 again. \n\nYes, this seems correct. \n\nSo the code can be written in Java as follows:\n\nRead t test cases. For each case:\n\nRead n and the array. \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, ans=0.\n\nLoop over each element in the array:\n\n   if a[i] ==0:\n\n      ans +=1\n\n      current_sum =0\n\n   else:\n\n      current_sum += a[i]\n\n      if current_sum ==0:\n\n          ans +=1\n\nThen print ans. \n\nWait, but let me test this with the first example:\n\nFirst test case array [2,0,1,-1,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nelement 2 (not zero):\n\ncurrent_sum +=2 \u2192 2. Not zero \u2192 ans remains 0.\n\nelement 0 (zero):\n\nans becomes 1. current_sum set to 0.\n\nelement 1 (not zero):\n\ncurrent_sum +=1 \u2192 1. Not zero \u2192 ans remains 1.\n\nelement -1 (not zero):\n\ncurrent_sum +=-1 \u2192 0 \u2192 ans +=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nelement 0 (zero):\n\nans becomes 3. current_sum set to 0. \n\nTotal ans is 3 \u2192 correct. \n\nSecond test case [0, 2000000000]:\n\nProcessing:\n\nelement 0 \u2192 ans 1, current_sum 0.\n\nelement 2e9 \u2192 current_sum +=2e9 \u2192 2e9 \u2192 not zero. \n\nTotal ans 1 \u2192 correct. \n\nThird test case [0,0,0]:\n\nProcessing each zero:\n\nEach step adds 1 and sets current_sum to 0. \n\nTotal 3 \u2192 correct. \n\nAnother test case: [0, -1, 0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst zero \u2192 ans 1, current 0.\n\nSecond element -1 \u2192 current becomes -1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nThird zero \u2192 ans 2, current 0. \n\nTotal 2 \u2192 correct. \n\nAnother test case: [0,3,-3,0]\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst zero \u2192 ans 1, current 0.\n\n3 \u2192 current 3 \u2192 no.\n\n-3 \u2192 current 0 \u2192 ans 2.\n\nZero \u2192 ans 3, current 0. \n\nTotal 3 \u2192 correct. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nTherefore, the correct code is much simpler than the provided code. The provided code seems to be trying a different approach with hashmaps and temp variables, which might be incorrect. \n\nThe problem is that the user is asking to complete the given code, not to write a new one. \n\nHmm, so the existing code is probably incorrect, but the user wants us to fix it. \n\nLooking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code has a loop over each element. For each element, if it's zero, it does some processing with a hashmap. \n\nThe code's approach seems to be trying to track possible values for the current zero so that the number of zeros in the prefix sums can be maximized. \n\nBut perhaps the correct approach is the greedy one, so the existing code is wrong, and the user wants us to fix it. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code in the given code. \n\nLooking at the code's current state:\n\nIn the loop over each element i:\n\nif arr[i] ==0:\n\n   then they create a hashmap, and do some processing with j from i+1 to n-1. \n\nThe code's inner loop for j starts at i+1 and breaks when arr[j] is zero. \n\nThe code's logic is unclear. \n\nThe problem is that the code's current approach is not the greedy one, so perhaps the missing code is part of that approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the possible values for the current zero so that the maximum number of zeros can be achieved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find for each zero the best value to set it to so that the maximum number of subsequent prefix sums can be zero. \n\nBut the code's current approach is not working. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the possible prefix sums and see how many can be made zero by choosing the current zero's value. \n\nThe code's inner loop for j from i+1 to n-1:\n\nThey compute 'need' as pre_sum[j] + temp. \n\nWait, temp is the accumulated changes so far. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find a value for the current zero (i) such that the number of j's where (pre_sum[j] + temp + x) equals zero, where x is the value chosen for the current zero. \n\nWait, the current zero's value is x. The prefix sum up to i would be pre_sum[i] (original) + x (since the original a[i] was zero). \n\nThen, the prefix sum up to j (j>i) would be (pre_sum[j] + x) + (sum of changes made to other zeros after i but before j). \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is trying to find the best x for the current zero so that the number of j's where the new prefix sum up to j is zero is maximized. \n\nThe code's inner loop for j starts at i+1 and breaks when it hits another zero. \n\nThe idea might be that between two zeros, the optimal x can be chosen to maximize the number of zeros in the prefix sums between them. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is trying to track the possible values of the prefix sum after choosing x for the current zero. \n\nThe code's current approach is not working, so perhaps the correct way is to replace the entire code with the greedy approach. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code in the given code. \n\nLooking at the code's current state:\n\nThe code has a loop over each element. \n\nInside the loop, when arr[i] is zero, they create a hashmap and do some processing. \n\nThe code's inner loop for j from i+1 to n-1:\n\nThey compute 'need' as pre_sum[j] + temp. \n\nThe initial 'val' is pre_sum[i] + temp. \n\nThe code's 'temp' is the accumulated changes made so far. \n\nWait, temp is initially 0. \n\nWhen they set arr[i] to -val, then temp += arr[i]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the current prefix sum up to i, and then see how many times the prefix sums can be zero. \n\nBut the code's logic is unclear. \n\nThe problem is that the code's current approach is not working, and the correct approach is the greedy one. \n\nBut since the user wants us to complete the given code, perhaps the missing code is part of the greedy approach. \n\nWait, looking at the code's current code:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++){\n\n   if(arr[i] ==0){\n\n      ... \n\n      arr[i] = -val;\n\n      temp += arr[i];\n\n   }\n\n   if(pre_sum[i] + temp ==0){\n\n      ans++;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, the 'temp' variable is the sum of all changes made so far. \n\nThe 'pre_sum[i]' is the original prefix sum up to i. \n\nThe actual prefix sum up to i after changes is pre_sum[i] + temp (since temp is the sum of all changes made before or at i). \n\nWait, no. Because temp is the sum of all changes made so far. \n\nWait, when you change a zero at position k, the change is (new value - 0) = new value. \n\nSo the total change up to position i is the sum of all changes made to elements before or at i. \n\nThus, the actual prefix sum up to i is original pre_sum[i] plus the sum of all changes made up to i. \n\nThe 'temp' variable is the sum of all changes made so far. \n\nWait, but in the code, when you process element i (a zero), you set arr[i] to some value, then add that to temp. \n\nSo temp is the total change made so far. \n\nThus, the actual prefix sum up to i is pre_sum[i] + temp. \n\nThe code's condition after processing each element is:\n\nif (pre_sum[i] + temp ==0) \u2192 ans++. \n\nSo the code is counting the number of indices where the adjusted prefix sum is zero. \n\nThe problem is that the code's way of choosing the value for the current zero (arr[i]) is not correct. \n\nThe code's current approach for choosing the value of arr[i] (when it's zero) is:\n\nThey create a hashmap, and loop j from i+1 to n-1, until they hit another zero. \n\nThe code's logic here is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the correct way to choose the value for the current zero is to set it to - (pre_sum[i] + temp) so that the adjusted prefix sum up to i is zero. \n\nWait, the current adjusted prefix sum up to i before setting the value is pre_sum[i] (original) + temp (sum of previous changes). \n\nThe new value for arr[i] is x. \n\nThe new adjusted prefix sum up to i is (pre_sum[i] + temp) + (x - 0) \u2192 because the original a[i] was zero, so the change is x. \n\nWait, the total change up to i would be temp + x. \n\nWait, the previous temp is the sum of changes before i. \n\nWhen you set arr[i] to x, the new temp becomes temp + x. \n\nThe adjusted prefix sum up to i is pre_sum[i] + (temp + x - x) ? \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, the adjusted prefix sum up to i is the original pre_sum[i] plus the sum of all changes made up to i. \n\nThe sum of changes up to i is temp (before processing i) plus the new x (the value chosen for arr[i]). \n\nSo the adjusted prefix sum up to i is pre_sum[i] + (temp + x). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the original pre_sum[i] is the sum of the original array up to i. \n\nThe changes made so far (before processing i) are stored in temp. \n\nWhen you process i (a zero), you choose x as the new value. \n\nThe change for this element is x (since it was 0 before). \n\nSo the new temp becomes temp + x. \n\nThe adjusted prefix sum up to i is (original a_1 + ... + a_i) + (sum of changes up to i) \n\n= pre_sum[i] + (temp + x). \n\nWait, but the sum of changes up to i is the previous temp (sum of changes before i) plus x (the change at i). \n\nSo the adjusted prefix sum up to i is pre_sum[i] + (temp + x). \n\nWe want this to be zero. \n\nSo setting x = - (pre_sum[i] + temp) \n\nThen, the adjusted prefix sum up to i is zero. \n\nThen, the new temp becomes temp + x = temp - (pre_sum[i] + temp) = -pre_sum[i]. \n\nWait, but this is the correct way to set x. \n\nSo the code should set arr[i] = - (pre_sum[i] + temp). \n\nThen, the adjusted prefix sum up to i is zero. \n\nThen, the code's condition after processing i would check if the adjusted prefix sum is zero (which it is), so ans is incremented. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is to set arr[i] to - (pre_sum[i] + temp). \n\nLooking at the code's current code for when arr[i] is zero:\n\nInside the if(arr[i]==0) block:\n\nThey have:\n\nlong val = pre_sum[i] + temp;\n\nThen, they set arr[i] = -val. \n\nWhich is exactly what we want. \n\nWait, val is pre_sum[i] + temp. \n\nSo arr[i] = -val \u2192 which is - (pre_sum[i] + temp). \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nThen, the code adds this to temp: temp += arr[i] \u2192 which is temp += (-val) \u2192 temp becomes temp - val \u2192 which is temp - (pre_sum[i] + temp) \u2192 -pre_sum[i]. \n\nWait, but after setting arr[i] to -val, the new temp is temp + arr[i] \u2192 which is temp + (-val) \u2192 temp + (- (pre_sum[i] + temp)) \u2192 -pre_sum[i]. \n\nHmm, but then the next elements will have their adjusted prefix sums computed as pre_sum[j] + temp (the new temp). \n\nWait, but the code's logic for the rest of the elements is that the adjusted prefix sum up to j is pre_sum[j] + temp. \n\nSo after setting the current zero's value, the temp is updated, and the next elements' adjusted prefix sums are computed with the new temp. \n\nThus, the code's approach for handling a zero is correct. \n\nBut then why is the code's inner loop (the one with the hashmap) present? \n\nLooking at the code's current code for the zero case:\n\nInside the if(arr[i]==0) block:\n\nThey create a hashmap and loop j from i+1 to n-1. \n\nThe code's inner loop is:\n\nfor(int j=i+1; j <n; j++){\n\n   if(arr[j]==0) break;\n\n   long need = pre_sum[j] + temp;\n\n   if(mp contains need \u2192 do something, else add to map.\n\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, they set arr[i] = -val, and temp += arr[i]. \n\nWait, but the code's current approach is not using the hashmap's information. \n\nThe code's current approach is to set arr[i] to -val (pre_sum[i] + temp), but the inner loop is trying to do something else. \n\nPerhaps the inner loop is trying to find the best possible value for arr[i] such that the number of zeros in the prefix sums is maximized. \n\nThe code's current approach may be trying to track possible 'need' values and choose the one that allows the maximum number of zeros. \n\nBut the code's current code for the inner loop is incomplete. \n\nThe problem says that the code has a TODO comment inside the if(mp contains need) block. \n\nThe code's current code for the inner loop is:\n\nfor(int j=i+1; j <n; j++){\n\n   if(arr[j]==0) break;\n\n   long need = pre_sum[j] + temp;\n\n   if(mp contains need \u2192 do something, else add to map.\n\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, they set arr[i] = -val (which is pre_sum[i]+temp). \n\nBut perhaps the code is trying to find the best 'val' such that the number of j's where need is in the map is maximized. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track how many times a certain 'need' value occurs, so that choosing val to be that need would allow multiple zeros. \n\nWait, the code's initial 'val' is pre_sum[i] + temp. \n\nThen, in the inner loop, for each j, they compute need = pre_sum[j] + temp. \n\nThe idea might be that when choosing the value for the current zero (i), we can set it to a value such that the adjusted prefix sum up to j is zero. \n\nThe adjusted prefix sum up to j would be (pre_sum[j] + temp) + (x - 0) \u2192 where x is the new value of arr[i]. \n\nWait, the x is the value chosen for arr[i]. \n\nThe adjusted prefix sum up to j is (original pre_sum[j] + temp (before processing i) + x) \u2192 because the change at i is x. \n\nWait, the temp after processing i is temp + x. \n\nThe adjusted prefix sum up to j is pre_sum[j] + (temp + x). \n\nWe want this to be zero \u2192 x = - (pre_sum[j] + temp). \n\nSo for each j after i (until next zero), the x that would make the prefix sum at j zero is x = - (pre_sum[j] + temp). \n\nThe code's inner loop is trying to track all possible x's (the 'need's) that would make the prefix sum at j zero. \n\nThe code's 'need' is pre_sum[j] + temp \u2192 so x = -need. \n\nThe code is using a hashmap to count how many times each 'need' occurs. \n\nThe idea is that if a certain 'need' value occurs multiple times, choosing x = -need would set the prefix sum to zero at all those j's. \n\nThus, the maximum number of zeros contributed by this choice of x is the count of that 'need' in the map plus 1 (for the current i). \n\nThe code's 'mp' is storing the count of each 'need' value. \n\nInitially, the 'val' is pre_sum[i] + temp \u2192 which is the need for j =i. \n\nWait, the initial 'val' is pre_sum[i] + temp \u2192 which is the need for j =i. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track all possible 'need's (the x's that would make the prefix sum at j zero) for all j from i to the next zero. \n\nThe maximum number of zeros achievable by choosing x is the maximum count of any 'need' in the map plus 1 (the current i). \n\nThus, the code should choose the 'need' with the highest count, set x to -need, and then the number of zeros added would be the count plus 1. \n\nThe code's current code has a variable 'fokat' initialized to 1. \n\nInside the loop over j, for each need:\n\nif the need is already in the map, then the count increases. \n\nWait, the code's current code for the inner loop is:\n\nif(mp contains need):\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\nelse:\n\n   mp.put(need,1);\n\nThen, after the loop, the code sets arr[i] = -val (the initial val). \n\nBut perhaps the correct code is to choose the need with the highest frequency. \n\nThe code's 'fokat' is supposed to track the maximum frequency. \n\nThe code's initial 'val' is pre_sum[i]+temp \u2192 which is the need for j=i. \n\nThen, for each j, the need is pre_sum[j]+temp. \n\nThe code should track how many times each need occurs. \n\nThe maximum frequency among all these needs is the best choice, because choosing x = -need would set the prefix sum to zero at all those j's. \n\nThus, the code should select the need with the highest count, then set val to that need. \n\nThe code's 'val' is initially set to pre_sum[i]+temp (the need for j=i). \n\nThen, during the loop over j, for each need, if it's already in the map, then the count increases. \n\nWait, the code's current code for the inner loop is:\n\nif(mp contains need):\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\nelse:\n\n   mp.put(need,1);\n\nSo the code is not incrementing the count when the need is already present. \n\nThe correct code should be:\n\nif(mp contains need):\n\n   mp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nelse:\n\n   mp.put(need,1);\n\nThen, after processing all j's, we need to find the need with the maximum count. \n\nThe code's 'fokat' is supposed to track the maximum count. \n\nInitially, fokat is set to 1 (since the initial val is counted once). \n\nThen, for each j's need:\n\nif it's in the map, then the count is increased, and we check if this count is larger than fokat. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should track the maximum count and the corresponding need. \n\nThe code's current code has:\n\nint fokat=1;\n\nfor each j:\n\n   compute need.\n\n   if in map:\n\n      // do something, like increment count and check if it's the new max.\n\n   else:\n\n      add to map with count 1.\n\n   then, if the current count of need is greater than fokat:\n\n      update val to need, and fokat to the count.\n\nBut the code's current code has a comment where the TODO is. \n\nSo the missing code inside the if (mp contains need) block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nthen, check if the new count is greater than fokat. \n\nAlternatively, after updating the count, we can check if the current count is larger than fokat, and update val and fokat accordingly. \n\nThe code's current code after the if-else block has:\n\nif(mp.get(need) > fokat){\n\n   val = need;\n\n   fokat = mp.get(need);\n\n}\n\nBut this would require that after updating the count, we check. \n\nAlternatively, after updating the count (whether it was present or not), we can check. \n\nSo the code inside the loop for j should be:\n\nlong need = pre_sum[j] + temp;\n\nif (mp.containsKey(need)) {\n\n    int cnt = mp.get(need) + 1;\n\n    mp.put(need, cnt);\n\n} else {\n\n    mp.put(need, 1);\n\n    cnt = 1;\n\n}\n\n// then check if cnt > fokat:\n\nif (cnt > fokat) {\n\n    val = need;\n\n    fokat = cnt;\n\n}\n\nWait, but how to get the current count after the update. \n\nAlternatively, after updating the map, we can get the current count and compare. \n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\nlong need = pre_sum[j] + temp;\n\nint cnt = 1;\n\nif (mp.containsKey(need)) {\n\n    cnt = mp.get(need) + 1;\n\n    mp.put(need, cnt);\n\n} else {\n\n    mp.put(need, 1);\n\n}\n\nif (cnt > fokat) {\n\n    val = need;\n\n    fokat = cnt;\n\n}\n\nThis way, after updating the count for 'need', we check if it's the new maximum. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is to increment the count and update val and fokat if needed. \n\nThe code's current TODO is inside the if (mp contains need) block. \n\nSo the code inside the if block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nand then, after that, check if the new count is larger than fokat. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nif (mp.containsKey(need)) {\n\n    int currentCount = mp.get(need);\n\n    mp.put(need, currentCount + 1);\n\n    if (currentCount + 1 > fokat) {\n\n        val = need;\n\n        fokat = currentCount + 1;\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    mp.put(need, 1);\n\n    if (1 > fokat) { // which is only possible if fokat was 0, but initially fokat is 1.\n\n        // but initially, val is set to pre_sum[i]+temp, which is the first need (j=i?)\n\n        // perhaps this is not needed.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but the initial 'val' is set to pre_sum[i]+temp (the need for j=i). \n\nThe first j is i+1, so the first need is for j=i+1. \n\nThe initial fokat is 1 (from the initial val). \n\nWait, the initial val is pre_sum[i]+temp \u2192 which is the need for j=i. \n\nBut j starts from i+1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the initial val is for j=i, but the loop starts at j=i+1. \n\nWait, the code's initial val is pre_sum[i]+temp \u2192 which is the need for j=i. \n\nBut the loop for j starts at i+1. \n\nSo the initial val is for j=i. \n\nThe code's initial fokat is 1 (count for that need). \n\nThen, for each j from i+1 to next zero, the code processes their needs. \n\nThus, the code's initial val is the need for j=i, which is counted as 1. \n\nThen, for each j, the code processes their need and updates the count. \n\nThe maximum count among all these needs (including j=i) is tracked in fokat. \n\nThus, the code's missing code inside the if (mp contains need) block is to increment the count and possibly update val and fokat. \n\nSo the code inside the if block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nint cnt = mp.get(need);\n\nif (cnt > fokat) {\n\n    val = need;\n\n    fokat = cnt;\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nand then checking the count. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as:\n\nif (mp.containsKey(need)) {\n\n    int cnt = mp.get(need) + 1;\n\n    mp.put(need, cnt);\n\n    if (cnt > fokat) {\n\n        val = need;\n\n        fokat = cnt;\n\n    }\n\n} else {\n\n    mp.put(need, 1);\n\n    if (1 > fokat) { // this is only possible if fokat is 0, but initially it's 1.\n\n        // so this block is not needed.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut since the initial fokat is 1, the else block won't trigger. \n\nThus, the code inside the if block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nint cnt = mp.get(need);\n\nif (cnt > fokat) {\n\n    val = need;\n\n    fokat = cnt;\n\n}\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nand then the check. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the if (mp contains need) block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nand then the code after the if-else block should check the count. \n\nWait, but the code's current structure is:\n\nif (mp contains need):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   mp.put(need,1);\n\nThen, after that, the code has:\n\nif(mp.get(need) > fokat){\n\n    val=need;\n\n    fokat=mp.get(need);\n\n}\n\nWait, but this code is outside the if-else block. \n\nWait, the code's current code after the if-else block has:\n\nif(mp.get(need) > fokat){\n\n    val=need;\n\n    fokat=mp.get(need);\n\n}\n\nBut this is inside the loop over j. \n\nWait, the code's current code after the if-else block has:\n\nif(mp.get(need) > fokat){\n\n    val=need;\n\n    fokat=mp.get(need);\n\n}\n\nSo, after either branch of the if-else, this code is executed. \n\nThus, the code inside the if block (when need is present) should do the increment, and then the code after will check. \n\nThe code inside the if block should be:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nThen, the code after the if-else block will get the current count (mp.get(need)), which is now incremented. \n\nThus, the missing code is simply:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nSo the code inside the if block is to increment the count. \n\nThe rest of the code (the if statement after) will handle updating val and fokat. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nSo the code inside the if block is that line. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);\n\nThus, the missing code is that line. \n\nTesting this logic:\n\nIn the first example, when processing the second element (i=1, which is zero):\n\nThe initial val is pre_sum[1] + temp. \n\npre_sum[1] is 2 (original array's first element is 2, second is 0 \u2192 pre_sum[1] = 2+0=2. \n\ntemp is initially 0. \n\nSo val = 2+0 =2. \n\nThen, the loop for j starts at i+1=2. \n\nj=2 (element 1):\n\nneed = pre_sum[2] + temp \u2192 pre_sum[2] is 2+0+1=3 \u2192 3 +0 =3. \n\nSince not in the map (initial map has val=2 with count 1), so add to map. \n\nThen, check if 1> fokat (which is 1 \u2192 no. \n\nj=3 (element -1):\n\nneed = pre_sum[3] + temp \u2192 pre_sum[3] is 2+0+1-1=2 \u2192 2+0=2. \n\nNow, need is 2, which is in the map (count 1). \n\nSo in the if block, we do mp.put(2, 2). \n\nThen, after the if-else, check if 2>1 \u2192 yes. So val becomes 2, fokat becomes 2. \n\nj=4 (element 0 \u2192 break loop. \n\nThus, after the loop, val is 2. \n\nSo arr[i] (i=1) is set to -2. \n\ntemp becomes 0 + (-2) \u2192 -2. \n\nThen, the code proceeds. \n\nThe next elements are processed with the new temp. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nThus, the missing code is the line inside the if block: \n\nmp.put(need, mp.get(need)+1);"
