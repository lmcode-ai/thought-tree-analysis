Alternatively, let's consider the parity differences between elements. Let's look at the first two elements, for example. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first element is at position 1 (odd), and the second is even. The parity after operations for element 1 is (a1_parity + a) mod2. For element 2, it's (a2_parity + b) mod2. We want these two to be equal. So:\n\n(a1_parity + a) \u2261 (a2_parity + b) mod2. Which can be rewritten as a - b \u2261 (a2_parity - a1_parity) mod2. Hmm, but this is just for the first two elements. For all elements, similar conditions must hold. Wait, perhaps the key is that for all elements, the parity after operations must be the same. Let me think of the parity of each element in terms of a and b.\n\nLet me consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: All elements must be even (T=0). Then for each element i:\n\noriginal_parity_i + (a if i is odd else b) \u2261 0 mod2. So:\n\na \u2261 (-original_parity_i) mod2 for odd i,\n\nb \u2261 (-original_parity_i) mod2 for even i.\n\nSimilarly, for T=1, the equations would be:\n\na \u2261 (1 - original_parity_i) mod2 for odd i,\n\nb \u2261 (1 - original_parity_i) mod2 for even i. So for the problem to have a solution, there must exist a and b such that for all odd i, a is equal to (desired value based on their parity and T), and similarly for even i's and b. But since T can be either 0 or 1, we can check both possibilities.",

The code currently has:\n\nfor each element:\n\nif (n is odd):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i is even \u2192 y++ else m++;\n\nThe variables x and k are for counting odd elements in odd and even indices respectively. Thus, the missing code in the TODO block should be:\n\nif (i%2 ==1) \u2192 x++;\n\nelse \u2192 k++;\n\nBecause when the element is odd and the index is odd \u2192 x increments. If the element is odd and index is even \u2192 k increments. Thus, the code inside the TODO block should be:\n\nif (i%2 ==1) x++;\n\nelse k++;\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif (i % 2 == 1) x++; else k++; So that's what needs to be filled in the TODO block. Thus, the correct code for the TODO block is:\n\nif (i % 2 == 1) x++; else k++;\n\nThis way, x counts the number of odd elements in odd indices, and k counts the number of odd elements in even indices.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if, after any number of operations, we can make all elements in the array have the same parity (all even or all odd). The two operations allowed are adding 1 to all odd indices or all even indices. \n\nHmm, the key here is to model the effect of these operations and see under what conditions the array can be made uniform in parity. Let's think about the parity changes.\n\nEach operation affects the parities of the elements. Let's consider each element's parity modulo 2. Let me think of the operations in terms of how they change the parities.\n\nLet me note that each operation of type 1 (adding 1 to odd indices) flips the parity of those elements. Similarly, type 2 flips the even indices. But since we can do these any number of times, maybe we can model the number of times each operation is done modulo 2, because doing an operation twice is equivalent to not doing it at all (since adding 2 doesn't change parity). Wait, but the problem allows any number of operations, but since we only care about parity, the number of times each operation is done mod 2 is what matters. Because adding 1 an even number of times to an element is the same as not adding, and odd is same as adding once.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding some combination of a (number of type 1 operations mod 2) and b (number of type 2 operations mod 2) such that all elements end up with the same parity.\n\nLet me think for each element:\n\nFor an element at position i (1-based?), let's see:\n\nThe total added to it from type 1 operations is a (if i is odd) because each type 1 adds 1 each time, so mod 2, it's a. Similarly, type 2 adds b if the position is even.\n\nSo the total added mod 2 is:\n\nFor position i (odd):\n\nadded = a + 0 (from type 2 unless even). Wait, no. Wait, for position i:\n\nIf it's odd, then each type 1 operation adds 1, so total from type1 is a (mod 2). Type2 doesn't affect it. So total added is a.\n\nIf it's even, then type2 adds 1 each time, so total added is b (mod2). Type1 doesn't affect it.\n\nSo the new parity of element i is:\n\noriginal_parity_i + (a if i is odd else b) mod 2.\n\nWe want all elements to have the same parity. Let's denote the desired parity as either 0 (even) or 1 (odd). But since we can choose a and b, perhaps the condition is that for all elements, their (original_parity_i + (a if odd else b)) mod2 must be equal.\n\nLet me think of the required conditions. Let's suppose that after choosing a and b, all elements have parity equal to some target (either 0 or 1). Let's see what constraints this imposes on a and b.\n\nAlternatively, for all elements, the expression (original_parity_i + (a if i is odd else b)) mod2 must be the same for all elements. Let's denote that target as T (either 0 or 1). So for each element, (original_parity_i + (a if odd else b)) \u2261 T mod2. \n\nRearranged, this gives:\n\n(original_parity_i - T) \u2261 (a if odd else b) mod2.\n\nBut since T can be 0 or 1, perhaps we can consider both possibilities and see if there exists a and b that satisfy the constraints for either T.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that for all elements, the difference between their parity and the others must be compatible with the possible a and b choices.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the parity differences between elements. Let's look at the first two elements, for example. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the first element is at position 1 (odd), and the second is even.\n\nThe parity after operations for element 1 is (a1_parity + a) mod2.\n\nFor element 2, it's (a2_parity + b) mod2.\n\nWe want these two to be equal. So:\n\n(a1_parity + a) \u2261 (a2_parity + b) mod2.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as a - b \u2261 (a2_parity - a1_parity) mod2.\n\nHmm, but this is just for the first two elements. For all elements, similar conditions must hold.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for all elements, the parity after operations must be the same. Let me think of the parity of each element in terms of a and b.\n\nLet me consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: All elements must be even (T=0). Then for each element i:\n\noriginal_parity_i + (a if i is odd else b) \u2261 0 mod2.\n\nSo:\n\na \u2261 (-original_parity_i) mod2 for odd i,\n\nb \u2261 (-original_parity_i) mod2 for even i.\n\nSimilarly, for T=1, the equations would be:\n\na \u2261 (1 - original_parity_i) mod2 for odd i,\n\nb \u2261 (1 - original_parity_i) mod2 for even i.\n\nSo for the problem to have a solution, there must exist a and b such that for all odd i, a is equal to (desired value based on their parity and T), and similarly for even i's and b. \n\nBut since T can be either 0 or 1, we can check both possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that the parities of the first element (odd) and second (even) must satisfy certain conditions. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have the first element (odd) and second (even). Let their parities be p1 and p2.\n\nFor all elements to have the same parity after some a and b, the following must hold:\n\nFor any odd position i, the required a must be such that (p_i + a) mod2 equals the target T.\n\nSimilarly, for even positions, (p_j + b) mod2 equals T.\n\nSo for all odd i, a must be equal to (T - p_i) mod2.\n\nSimilarly, for all even j, b must be equal to (T - p_j) mod2.\n\nTherefore, for all odd positions, the (T - p_i) mod2 must be the same (since a is a single variable). Similarly, for even positions, the (T - p_j) mod2 must be the same (since b is a single variable).\n\nTherefore, for a given T (either 0 or 1), we can check:\n\n- All odd positions have the same (T - p_i) mod2.\n\n- All even positions have the same (T - p_j) mod2.\n\nIf this is true for either T=0 or T=1, then the answer is YES.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Check for T=0:\n\n   a. For all odd indices, check if (0 - p_i) mod2 is the same for all of them. Let's call this value a0.\n\n   b. For all even indices, check if (0 - p_j) mod2 is the same for all of them. Let's call this value b0.\n\n   If both a0 and b0 are consistent (i.e., all odd positions agree on a0, and all even on b0), then possible.\n\n2. Check for T=1 similarly:\n\n   a. For all odd indices, (1 - p_i) mod2 must be same (a1).\n\n   b. For all even indices, (1 - p_j) mod2 must be same (b1).\n\n   If both a1 and b1 are consistent, then possible.\n\nIf either T=0 or T=1 case is possible, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo the code needs to compute this.\n\nNow, looking at the given code skeleton, the current code is trying to count something. Let me see:\n\nIn the code, for each element in the array (for i from 1 to p, where p is the array length?), the code reads n (the element's value). Then, if n is odd, it enters the TODO block. Else, if the index i is even, it increments y, else m.\n\nWait, the variables x, k, y, m are initialized to 0. The code inside the loop for each element:\n\nWait, the code's variables are a bit unclear. Let me look again:\n\nThe code's variables:\n\nfor(j=1;j<=t;j++){\n\n    p= obj.nextInt(); // p is the array length n?\n\n    x=0; k=0; y=0; m=0;\n\n    for(i=1;i<=p;i++){\n\n        n=obj.nextInt(); // n here is the element's value. But the original variable n was declared as int n, but in the loop, it's being overwritten. That's probably a mistake. Because in the outer loop, n is declared but then in the inner loop, they read into n again. That's a problem. Because in the code, the variable n is being reused here, which might be an error. But perhaps the code is incorrect, but the user wants us to fix the TODO part.\n\nWait, the code's variables are a bit confusing. Let me see:\n\nThe code's variables in the outer loop:\n\nint t,n,i,p,j,k,x,y,m;\n\nWait, the variables are declared at the top. So in the for loop for each test case, the code does:\n\np=obj.nextInt(); // p is the array length.\n\nThen, for each element in the array (i from 1 to p):\n\nn=obj.nextInt(); // here, n is the element's value. But the variable n was declared as an int in the outer scope. So this overwrites the n variable. But in the code, perhaps the array elements are stored in some variables, but the code is incomplete.\n\nThe code then has:\n\nif(n%2==1) { /* TODO */ }\n\nelse {\n\n   if(i%2==0) y++;\n\n   else m++;\n\n}\n\nSo for even elements, if the index is even, they count y, else m? Not sure. Then after processing all elements, the code checks if (k>0 and y>0) \u2192 print NO, or (x>0 and m>0) \u2192 NO, else YES.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original code is trying to track the counts of odd and even elements in certain positions, but it's not clear. The TODO part is in the case when the element is odd. So perhaps the code is trying to track variables x and k, but it's unclear.\n\nThe current code's logic is probably incorrect, so we need to replace the TODO part with the correct logic.\n\nThe correct approach, as per earlier analysis, is to check for T=0 and T=1 possibilities.\n\nLet me think of how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nWe can first collect the parities of all elements. Let's make two arrays or variables:\n\n- For all odd indices (1-based), collect their parities (0 or 1).\n\n- For even indices, collect their parities.\n\nThen, check for T=0 and T=1.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible T (0 and 1):\n\nCheck:\n\nFor all odd indices, (T - parity_i) mod2 must be the same for all of them. Let's call this required_a.\n\nSimilarly, for all even indices, (T - parity_j) mod2 must be the same, required_b.\n\nIf both required_a is consistent across all odd indices, and required_b is consistent across all even indices, then it's possible with this T.\n\nSo for each T in {0,1}:\n\nCheck:\n\n- For all odd indices i: (T - (a[i]%2)) %2 must be same for all.\n\n- For all even indices j: (T - (a[j]%2))%2 must be same for all.\n\nIf either T=0 or T=1 satisfies both conditions, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to code this?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nRead the array elements, store their parities (0 or 1).\n\nThen, for T in 0 and 1:\n\nCheck the conditions.\n\nLet me code this in Java.\n\nBut in the given code skeleton, the variables are not set up for this. So perhaps the code needs to be restructured.\n\nAlternatively, let's see how to fit into the existing code.\n\nLooking at the code's current structure:\n\nInside the loop over each element (i from 1 to p):\n\nn = obj.nextInt();\n\nif (n is odd):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i is even) y++;\n\n   else m++;\n\nThen after processing all elements, the code checks:\n\nif (k>0 && y>0 \u2192 NO)\n\nelse if (x>0 && m>0 \u2192 NO)\n\nelse YES.\n\nHmm, perhaps the variables x and k are meant to track something related to the odd elements. Let me see:\n\nIn the code, when the element is odd (n%2==1), the code is in the TODO block. The variables x and k are initialized to 0. Maybe the code is trying to track the parity differences between the first element and others?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the counts of odd elements in odd and even positions. Let me think:\n\nSuppose for the TODO block (when the element is odd):\n\nif (i is odd):\n\n   x +=1 ?\n\nelse:\n\n   k +=1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the number of odd elements in odd and even positions. Let me see:\n\nSuppose:\n\nFor each element:\n\nif it's odd:\n\n   if it's in an odd index (i is odd), then x increments?\n\n   else (even index), k increments?\n\nElse (even element):\n\n   if even index \u2192 y increments (count of even elements in even indices?)\n\n   else (odd index) \u2192 m increments (count of even elements in odd indices?)\n\nWait, perhaps the variables x and k are counts of odd elements in odd and even positions respectively. Let me see:\n\nSuppose:\n\nx counts the number of odd elements in odd indices.\n\nk counts the number of odd elements in even indices.\n\nThen, the code's logic after that is:\n\nif (k>0 and y>0 \u2192 meaning there are some even elements in even indices and some odd elements in even indices? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to see if the parities can be made uniform by checking some conditions based on counts.\n\nBut perhaps the current code's approach is incorrect, and the correct way is to implement the T check.\n\nSo, to proceed, perhaps the code needs to be restructured. Let me think of the correct approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each test case:\n\n1. Read n (array length) and the array elements.\n\n2. For each element, note its parity (0 or 1) and its position (odd or even).\n\n3. Check for T=0:\n\n   a. For all odd positions, compute (0 - parity) mod2. Check if all are the same.\n\n   b. For all even positions, compute (0 - parity) mod2. Check if all are the same.\n\n   If both a and b are true \u2192 possible with T=0.\n\n4. Check for T=1 similarly:\n\n   a. For all odd positions, (1 - parity) mod2 must be same.\n\n   b. For all even positions, same.\n\n   If both a and b \u2192 possible with T=1.\n\n5. If either T=0 or T=1 is possible \u2192 output YES, else NO.\n\nSo, in code, for each test case:\n\nWe can first collect the parities of the elements in two arrays: one for odd indices and even indices.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nWe can have two arrays: odd_parity and even_parity.\n\nWait, but for efficiency, perhaps just track the required conditions.\n\nAlternatively, for each element, track its position (odd or even) and parity.\n\nLet me code this step by step.\n\nFirst, in the code, for each test case:\n\nRead p (n in the problem's terms), then read p numbers.\n\nWe can store the parities in two lists: for odd indices and even indices.\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps:\n\nInitialize variables for T0 and T1.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nFor T=0:\n\nCheck for all odd indices:\n\nCompute (0 - parity) mod2. Let's call this a_val.\n\nAll must be equal to a_val (so first element's a_val is the reference, then check others).\n\nSimilarly for even indices, compute (0 - parity) mod2 \u2192 b_val. All must be same.\n\nSimilarly for T=1.\n\nAlternatively, code for T=0:\n\nboolean possible0 = true;\n\nint a0 = -1, b0 = -1;\n\nfor (each odd index i):\n\n   parity = a[i]%2;\n\n   current = (0 - parity) %2;\n\n   if (a0 == -1) a0 = current;\n\n   else if (current != a0) possible0 = false;\n\nfor (each even index j):\n\n   parity = a[j]%2;\n\n   current = (0 - parity) %2;\n\n   if (b0 == -1) b0 = current;\n\n   else if (current != b0) possible0 = false;\n\nSimilarly for T=1.\n\nIf possible0 or possible1 \u2192 output YES.\n\nSo in code, perhaps:\n\nBut in the given code skeleton, variables are not set up for this. So perhaps the code needs to be restructured.\n\nAlternatively, let's see how to fit into the existing code's structure.\n\nLooking at the code's current variables:\n\nIn the inner loop (for each element):\n\nif (n is odd):\n\n   // TODO\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i is even \u2192 y++ else m++.\n\nThe variables x and k are initialized to 0 but not used in the TODO block yet.\n\nPerhaps the code is trying to track the parity differences between the first element and others, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the difference between the parity of the first element (odd index) and the second (even index), and see if all other elements follow that pattern.\n\nWait, let me think of the parity conditions again.\n\nSuppose that after some a and b, all elements have the same parity T.\n\nThen for any two elements, their parities must satisfy:\n\nFor element i (odd):\n\nparity_i + a \u2261 T mod2 \u2192 a \u2261 (T - parity_i) mod2.\n\nFor element j (even):\n\nparity_j + b \u2261 T mod2 \u2192 b \u2261 (T - parity_j) mod2.\n\nSo for all odd elements, the required a must be the same. Similarly for even elements and b.\n\nThus, for all odd elements, (T - parity_i) mod2 must be the same. Let's call this value a_val.\n\nSimilarly for even elements, (T - parity_j) mod2 must be the same \u2192 b_val.\n\nThus, for T to be possible, the a_val must be same across all odd elements, and b_val same across all even elements.\n\nTherefore, for T=0:\n\nCheck all odd elements have (0 - parity_i) mod2 equal to the first odd element's value.\n\nSame for even elements.\n\nSimilarly for T=1.\n\nThus, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead the array, store the parities.\n\nCheck for T=0 and T=1.\n\nNow, in the given code, perhaps the variables x and k can be used to track the required conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let's see how to code this in the existing code's structure.\n\nThe current code's variables:\n\nIn the inner loop (for each element):\n\nif (n is odd):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i is even \u2192 y++ else m++;\n\nThe variables x and k are initialized to 0 but not used yet.\n\nPerhaps the code is trying to track the parity of the first element in odd and even positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the difference between the parities of odd and even elements.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach:\n\nThe key is that the difference between the parity of the first element (odd index) and the second (even index) must be consistent with the rest of the array.\n\nWait, let me think of the parity of the first element (odd index) and second (even index).\n\nSuppose the first element has parity p1, second p2.\n\nFor all elements to reach the same parity T, then:\n\nFor the first element (odd):\n\np1 + a \u2261 T mod2 \u2192 a = (T - p1) mod2.\n\nFor the second (even):\n\np2 + b \u2261 T mod2 \u2192 b = (T - p2) mod2.\n\nNow, for other elements:\n\nTake an odd element at position i (third element, etc.):\n\nits parity p_i must satisfy p_i + a \u2261 T mod2 \u2192 a must be (T - p_i) mod2. But a is already determined by the first element. So (T - p_i) mod2 must equal a, which is (T - p1) mod2.\n\nThus, (T - p_i) \u2261 (T - p1) mod2 \u2192 p_i \u2261 p1 mod2.\n\nSo all odd elements must have the same parity as the first element.\n\nSimilarly, for even elements, all must have the same parity as the second element.\n\nWait, that's an important point.\n\nWait, for all odd indices, their parities must be equal to p1 mod2. Because a is fixed once T is chosen, so for all odd elements, their parity plus a must equal T. Since a is (T - p1), then p_i + (T-p1) \u2261 T mod2 \u2192 p_i \u2261 p1 mod2. So all odd elements must have the same parity as the first element.\n\nSimilarly, for even elements, all must have the same parity as the second element.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight. Because:\n\nSuppose that for all odd indices, their parities must be equal to p1. Because otherwise, when you choose a, you can't have all of them satisfy p_i + a \u2261 T mod2.\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nSuppose that for T to be possible, all odd elements must have the same parity as the first element. Because a is determined by the first element (a = T - p1 mod2). Then for any other odd element i, p_i + a must equal T mod2 \u2192 p_i must equal p1 mod2. So all odd elements must have the same parity as the first.\n\nSimilarly, all even elements must have the same parity as the second element.\n\nWait, but the second element is the first even element. So for all even elements, their parity must equal the second element's parity.\n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\nEither:\n\nAll odd elements have the same parity as the first element, and all even elements have the same parity as the second element.\n\nOR\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly. Because the second element's parity must be such that when you choose b, which is (T - p2), then all even elements must have parity equal to p2.\n\nWait, the parity of even elements must be equal to p2, because for any even element j, p_j + b must equal T mod2. Since b is (T - p2), then p_j + (T-p2) \u2261 T mod2 \u2192 p_j \u2261 p2 mod2. So all even elements must have parity equal to p2.\n\nThus, the necessary conditions are:\n\nAll odd elements have the same parity as the first element (p1).\n\nAll even elements have the same parity as the second element (p2).\n\nAdditionally, the parities p1 and p2 must be such that either:\n\nEither (p1 and p2 can be adjusted via a and b to reach the same T).\n\nWait, but even if all odd elements are same as p1 and even same as p2, then we can choose T such that:\n\nEither:\n\nT = (p1 + a) mod2, and T must also equal (p2 + b) mod2.\n\nBut a and b can be chosen as needed. So the key is that the difference between p1 and p2 must allow for a and b to make T the same.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose all odd elements have parity p1, and all even have p2.\n\nWe can choose a and b such that:\n\nFor T to be same for all:\n\np1 + a \u2261 T mod2,\n\np2 + b \u2261 T mod2.\n\nWe can choose a and b as needed. So the equations are:\n\na = T - p1 mod2,\n\nb = T - p2 mod2.\n\nThese are possible for some T if and only if the difference between p1 and p2 can be adjusted via a and b.\n\nWait, substituting T from the first equation into the second:\n\nb = (p1 + a) - p2 mod2.\n\nBut a can be 0 or 1. So for any a, b can be set to (p1 +a - p2) mod2.\n\nThus, as long as the first and second elements' parities are compatible, then it's possible.\n\nWait, but the key is that the first and second elements can be adjusted via a and b to have the same T.\n\nWait, the first element's parity after a is p1 + a mod2.\n\nThe second's is p2 + b mod2.\n\nWe need these to be equal. So:\n\np1 + a \u2261 p2 + b mod2 \u2192 a - b \u2261 (p2 - p1) mod2.\n\nBut since a and b can be chosen freely (0 or 1), this equation can be satisfied. Because for any desired a and b, we can choose them to satisfy this equation.\n\nWait, but since a and b are variables we can choose, the equation can be satisfied. So as long as all odd elements are same as p1 and all even same as p2, then it's possible.\n\nWait, so the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\nAll odd elements have the same parity as the first element.\n\nAll even elements have the same parity as the second element.\n\nIf this is true, then the answer is YES, else NO.\n\nWait, that's a much simpler condition!\n\nBecause if all odd elements are same as first, and even same as second, then we can choose a and b to make all parities equal.\n\nLet me see with examples.\n\nTake the first sample input's first test case:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the array is [0, 2, 0] (assuming 1-based indices).\n\nWait, the first example's note says after one even increment, the array becomes [1,3,1], all odd. The original array was [1,2,1], perhaps?\n\nWait, the first test case's note says:\n\n\"For the first test case, we can increment the elements with an even index, obtaining the array [1, 3, 1], which contains only odd numbers, so the answer is YES.\"\n\nOriginal array must have been [1, 2, 1]. \n\nThe first element (odd index) is 1 (odd), second (even) is 2 (even), third (odd) is 1 (odd).\n\nAll odd indices (1 and 3) have parity 1 (same as first element).\n\nEven indices (2) has parity 0 (same as second element). So the conditions are met \u2192 answer is YES.\n\nAnother example: the second test case's note says the answer is NO. Suppose the array has elements with varying parities not meeting the conditions.\n\nSo the condition is that all odd elements have the same parity as the first, and all even as the second.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCheck that all odd indices have the same parity as the first element.\n\nAND all even indices have the same parity as the second element.\n\nIf this is true \u2192 YES, else NO.\n\nWait, that's a much simpler condition. So this is the key!\n\nSo the code can be structured to check this.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the given code.\n\nLooking at the current code's variables:\n\nIn the inner loop (for each element):\n\nif (n is odd):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i is even \u2192 y++ else m++;\n\nThe variables x and k are initialized to 0 but not used.\n\nPerhaps the code can be modified to track the first element's parity and check others.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\n- first_parity: parity of first element (odd index 1).\n\n- second_parity: parity of second element (even index 2).\n\nThen, for all other odd indices (i is odd and >1):\n\nCheck if their parity matches first_parity.\n\nFor all even indices (i even and >2):\n\nCheck if their parity matches second_parity.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nInitialize flags:\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nThen, for each element:\n\nfor (i from 1 to p):\n\n   n = element.\n\n   parity = n%2;\n\n   if (i ==1):\n\n       first_parity = parity;\n\n   else if (i ==2):\n\n       second_parity = parity;\n\n   else:\n\n       if (i%2 ==1):\n\n           if (parity != first_parity) \u2192 valid = false;\n\n       else:\n\n           if (parity != second_parity) \u2192 valid = false;\n\nAfter processing all elements, if valid \u2192 YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what if the array has length 1? But the problem states n \u22652.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nThus, the code can be adjusted to track first_parity and second_parity, and check the rest.\n\nNow, looking back at the given code's structure:\n\nThe code currently has variables x, k, y, m. Perhaps we can use these variables to track the counts of mismatches.\n\nAlternatively, let's see how to fit into the existing code.\n\nThe current code's variables:\n\nIn the inner loop (for each element):\n\nif (n is odd):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i is even \u2192 y++ else m++;\n\nThe variables x and k are initialized to 0 but not used.\n\nPerhaps the code can be modified as follows:\n\nInside the TODO block (when the element is odd):\n\nif (i is odd):\n\n   if (it's the first element \u2192 set first_parity to 1 (since it's odd).\n\n   else:\n\n       check if parity matches first_parity (which is 1 for first element).\n\n       if not \u2192 set some flag to false.\n\nWait, but the code's variables are not set up for this. So perhaps the code needs to be restructured.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the current code's logic:\n\nThe code's current logic after processing all elements is:\n\nif (k>0 && y>0 \u2192 NO)\n\nelse if (x>0 && m>0 \u2192 NO)\n\nelse YES.\n\nHmm, perhaps the variables x and k count the number of odd elements in odd and even positions respectively, and y and m count even elements in even and odd positions.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nThe code's variables:\n\nfor each element:\n\nif (n is odd):\n\n   // in the TODO block.\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i is even \u2192 y++ (even element in even position?)\n\n   else \u2192 m++ (even element in odd position?)\n\nSo y counts even elements in even indices, m counts even elements in odd indices.\n\nThe variables x and k are for the odd elements:\n\nIn the TODO block (when the element is odd):\n\nif (i is odd \u2192 x increments?\n\nelse \u2192 k increments?\n\nBut the code's current TODO block is empty. So perhaps the code is trying to track:\n\nx counts the number of odd elements in odd indices.\n\nk counts the number of odd elements in even indices.\n\nThus:\n\nfor each element:\n\nif it's odd:\n\n   if (i is odd \u2192 x +=1\n\n   else \u2192 k +=1\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i even \u2192 y +=1 (even in even)\n\n   else \u2192 m +=1 (even in odd)\n\nThen, after processing all elements:\n\nThe counts are:\n\nx: number of odd elements in odd indices.\n\nk: number of odd elements in even indices.\n\ny: even elements in even indices.\n\nm: even elements in odd indices.\n\nThen, the code's condition is:\n\nif (k>0 and y>0 \u2192 meaning there are some odd elements in even indices and even elements in even indices \u2192 so the even indices have mixed parities \u2192 thus can't be made uniform \u2192 so output NO.\n\nSimilarly, if x>0 and m>0 \u2192 meaning odd indices have both odd and even elements \u2192 can't be made uniform \u2192 output NO.\n\nElse \u2192 output YES.\n\nWait, this logic would work only if the following holds:\n\nThe even indices must be all odd or all even. Similarly for odd indices.\n\nWait, the condition is:\n\nIf in even indices, there are both odd and even elements (k>0 and y>0 \u2192 because k counts odd elements in even indices, y counts even elements in even indices \u2192 so if both exist \u2192 mixed \u2192 can't be made uniform.\n\nSimilarly for odd indices: x counts odd elements in odd indices, m counts even elements in odd indices. So if both x and m are >0 \u2192 mixed \u2192 can't be made uniform.\n\nThus, the code's logic is:\n\nIf either the even indices have mixed parities (k and y both >0) OR the odd indices have mixed (x and m both >0) \u2192 then output NO. Else YES.\n\nWait, but the code's condition is:\n\nif (k>0 && y>0 \u2192 NO)\n\nelse if (x>0 && m>0 \u2192 NO)\n\nelse \u2192 YES.\n\nWait, but this is not exactly OR. It's checking first if even indices are mixed (k and y both >0 \u2192 output NO). Else, check if odd indices are mixed (x and m both >0 \u2192 output NO). Else, output YES.\n\nThis would work only if the conditions are that both even and odd indices must be homogeneous (all even or all odd).\n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, the correct condition is that all odd indices have the same parity as the first element, and all even indices have the same as the second.\n\nWait, but the code's current logic may not capture that.\n\nLet me test with the first sample input.\n\nSample 1: array [1,2,1].\n\nOdd indices (1 and 3) have elements 1 (odd) and 1 (odd). So x (count of odd in odd indices) is 2. m (even in odd indices) is 0.\n\nEven indices (2) has element 2 (even). So y (even in even indices) is 1. k (odd in even indices) is 0.\n\nThus, the code's conditions:\n\nk>0 and y>0 \u2192 0 and 1 \u2192 no.\n\nThen check x>0 and m>0 \u2192 2>0 and 0 \u2192 no. So output YES \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where the first element is odd, second even, but third odd has different parity.\n\nSuppose array [1,2,0].\n\nThird element is even (0) at odd index 3.\n\nThen x (odd in odd indices) is 1 (only first element), m (even in odd indices) is 1 (third element).\n\nThus, x and m are both >0 \u2192 the second condition (x>0 and m>0 \u2192 yes \u2192 output NO \u2192 which is correct because the odd indices have mixed parities (1 and 0).\n\nThus, the code's logic seems to work for this case.\n\nAnother test case where the first element is even, second is even, but third is even (all odd indices even):\n\narray [2,4,6].\n\nThen x (odd in odd indices) is 0. m (even in odd indices) is 3 (all are even in odd indices).\n\nThus, x is 0, m is 3 \u2192 x>0 is false \u2192 so condition not met \u2192 output YES.\n\nWhich is correct, since all can be made even (already even).\n\nAnother case where even indices have mixed:\n\narray [1,3, 5]. \n\nEven indices (second element is 3 (odd). So even indices (only index 2) has odd. \n\nThus, even indices: k (odd in even indices) is 1, y (even in even indices) is 0 \u2192 so first condition (k>0 and y>0 \u2192 no. \n\nThus, output YES? But what's the actual possibility?\n\nWait, the array is [1,3,5]. All are odd. So already all odd \u2192 answer is YES. So code's output is correct.\n\nAnother case where even indices have mixed:\n\narray [1,2,3].\n\nEven indices (second element is even (2). So even indices are all even (only one element). So no problem. \n\nOdd indices: all are odd (1 and 3). So code outputs YES \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where even indices have mixed:\n\narray [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nEven indices (2 and 4) are 2 (even) and 4 (even). So even indices are all even. \n\nOdd indices (1,3) are odd. So code outputs YES \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case where even indices have mixed:\n\narray [1, 3, 5, 4].\n\nEven indices (2 and 4) are 3 (odd) and 4 (even). So even indices have mixed (k=1 (odd in even indices: index 2), y=1 (even in even indices: index4). Thus, k>0 and y>0 \u2192 first condition \u2192 output NO.\n\nWhich is correct because even indices can't be made uniform.\n\nThus, the code's logic seems to work.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the first element is even and the second is odd, but all other elements follow?\n\nLike array [2,3,2,3].\n\nOdd indices (1 and 3) are even and even \u2192 so x (odd in odd indices) is 0 (since first element is even, third is even \u2192 so m (even in odd indices) is 2. \n\nEven indices (2 and4) are odd and odd \u2192 so k (odd in even indices) is 2, y (even in even indices) is 0.\n\nThus, the code's first condition (k>0 and y>0 \u2192 2 and 0 \u2192 no. \n\nSecond condition: x>0 (0) \u2192 no. So output YES.\n\nBut can this array be made uniform?\n\nThe first element is even (2), second is odd (3).\n\nWe need to choose a and b such that all elements have same parity.\n\nLet's see:\n\nWe want all to be even or all odd.\n\nLet's see for T=0 (all even):\n\nFor odd indices (positions 1 and 3):\n\nTheir current parities are even (0). So a must be 0 (since 0 + a \u22610 mod2 \u2192 a=0).\n\nEven indices (positions 2 and4):\n\nCurrent parity is 1 (odd). So b must be 1 (1 + b \u22610 mod2 \u2192 b=1).\n\nThus, a=0, b=1.\n\nThen:\n\nElement 1: 2 +0 \u2192 even.\n\nElement2:3 +1 \u21924 \u2192 even.\n\nElement3:2+0 \u2192 even.\n\nElement4:3+1 \u21924 \u2192 even. So all even \u2192 possible. Thus answer is YES. So code's output is correct.\n\nAnother case where the first and second elements are different, but the rest follow.\n\nThus, the code's logic seems to work.\n\nSo the code's current logic is correct, but the TODO block is missing the code to count x and k.\n\nAh! The code's current code for the TODO block is empty. So the problem is that in the case when the element is odd, the code must update x and k.\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor each element:\n\nif (n is odd):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   if (i is even \u2192 y++ else m++;\n\nThe variables x and k are for counting odd elements in odd and even indices respectively.\n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO block should be:\n\nif (i%2 ==1) \u2192 x++;\n\nelse \u2192 k++;\n\nBecause when the element is odd and the index is odd \u2192 x increments.\n\nIf the element is odd and index is even \u2192 k increments.\n\nThus, the code inside the TODO block should be:\n\nif (i%2 ==1) x++;\n\nelse k++;\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nif (i % 2 == 1) x++; else k++;\n\nSo that's what needs to be filled in the TODO block.\n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO block is:\n\nif (i % 2 == 1) x++; else k++;\n\nThis way, x counts the number of odd elements in odd indices, and k counts the number of odd elements in even indices.\n\nThe rest of the code's logic is correct.\n\nTesting this:\n\nIn the first sample case:\n\nelements are 1 (odd, index1 \u2192 x becomes 1), 2 (even, index2 \u2192 y becomes1), 1 (odd, index3 \u2192 x becomes 2).\n\nThus, after processing:\n\nx=2, k=0, y=1, m=0.\n\nThe conditions:\n\nk>0 (0) \u2192 no. \n\nThen check x>0 (yes) and m>0 (0 \u2192 no \u2192 so condition not met \u2192 output YES.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case where the first element is even and second is odd, and others follow:\n\narray [2,3,2,3].\n\nFirst element (even, index1 \u2192 even in odd \u2192 m increments (since in the else clause for n even, and i is odd \u2192 m++.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst element is 2 (even):\n\nIn the else clause (since n is even):\n\ni is 1 (odd \u2192 m++ \u2192 m becomes 1.\n\nSecond element is 3 (odd \u2192 enters the TODO block.\n\ni is 2 (even \u2192 so k increments \u2192 k becomes 1.\n\nThird element is 2 (even, index3 (odd \u2192 m increments again (since in else clause, i is odd \u2192 m becomes 2.\n\nFourth element is 3 (odd \u2192 TODO block.\n\ni is even (4 \u2192 even \u2192 k increments \u2192 k becomes 2.\n\nThus, after processing:\n\nx is 0 (since the odd elements in odd indices are none (first element is even, third is even).\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the third element is 2 (even), so in the else clause. So for third element (index3, odd):\n\nn is even \u2192 so in else clause \u2192 if i is odd \u2192 m increments (since it's even in odd index).\n\nThus, the variables:\n\nx counts the number of odd elements in odd indices.\n\nIn this case, the first element is even (so not counted in x), third is even \u2192 so x remains 0.\n\nThe second element (3, odd, even index \u2192 k increments (k=1 for second element, then fourth element (3, odd, even index \u2192 k becomes 2).\n\nThus, x is 0, k is 2.\n\ny counts even elements in even indices:\n\nSecond element is 3 (odd \u2192 not counted in y. Fourth element is 3 (odd \u2192 not counted in y. So y is 0.\n\nm counts even elements in odd indices: first element (2 \u2192 yes \u2192 m=1, third (2 \u2192 m=2).\n\nThus, variables:\n\nx=0, k=2, y=0, m=2.\n\nThe conditions:\n\nFirst condition: k>0 (2>0) and y>0 (0 \u2192 no \u2192 first condition not met.\n\nSecond condition: x>0 (0 \u2192 no \u2192 so output YES.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code's logic works with the missing code filled in.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the line inside the TODO block: if (i%2 ==1) x++; else k++;"
