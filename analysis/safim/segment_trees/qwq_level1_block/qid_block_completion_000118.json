The robots move all at the same time with each command. If any robot steps outside, it explodes, so we have to avoid that in all steps. The code provided seems to be trying to process each test case. Let me look at the variables and the loops. The variables a and b are the rows and columns. The loop for a (rows) starts from a down to 0. Wait, the input has n rows, so each test case starts with n and m. The code is using a and b for those. The inner loop for b1 is going from b down to 0, so for each row, it's reading each column from the end? Hmm, the code is processing each row, and for each character in the row (the cells), it's checking if it's an 'R'.",

Wait, let's think again. Let's parse the code step by step. The loops for each test case:\n\nThey read a and b (n and m). Then for each a (rows), they process each row.

In this case, during processing:\n\nThe rows are processed from bottom to top. The top row is the last row processed. Suppose the top row's rightmost is column 1 (since the robot is in (1,1)). The bottom rows, if any, would have their rightmost columns >=1, but not exceeding previous minx. Thus, the check would remain 1, so output is YES. Another example: the first test case where the command is left. Suppose the robots are in, say, column 2. The first row (top row) has robots in column 2. Processing from bottom to top, but suppose there are only two rows. Assuming the bottom row has a rightmost, say, column 3, but the top row has a robot in column 2. Then the top row's rightmost is 2, which is <= previous minx (3). So check remains 1. Thus, the code would print YES. Another case: if in the top row, there is a robot in column 1, then after processing all rows, check remains 1 \u2192 YES. Now, what about the sixth test case, where any move causes explosion. Maybe in that case, there is a robot in a column that would require other robots to move out. The code's check would have been set to 0. Thus, the code's logic is correct. Now, looking back at the code:\n\nThe code initializes check=1.

So if in the top row, there's a robot in column 2, then a move left would take it to column 1. But if there's a robot in column 0 (impossible), but in practice, moving left from column 1 would be invalid. So to have a robot reach column 1, in their current column must be at least 1, but when you move left, they move to column current-1. So to reach column 1, you need that in some command sequence, you can move until they are at column 1. But all robots must not explode in any step. So in every move, when you issue a command, all robots must stay within the grid. Suppose you want to move left until one robot reaches column 1. For that, in each step until then, all robots must be in columns >=1. But since all robots move together, perhaps the minimal column among all robots in any row must be at least 1, but that's already true. Wait, but the problem requires that after some number of commands, at least one robot is at (1,1).",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this code and how to complete it. Let me start by understanding the problem again. The task is to determine if any robot can reach the upper left corner (0,0 or the top-left cell) without any robot exploding. The robots move all at the same time with each command. If any robot steps outside, it explodes, so we have to avoid that in all steps.\n\nThe code provided seems to be trying to process each test case. Let me look at the variables and the loops. The variables a and b are the rows and columns. The loop for a (rows) starts from a down to 0. Wait, the input has n rows, so each test case starts with n and m. The code is using a and b for those. The inner loop for b1 is going from b down to 0, so for each row, it's reading each column from the end?\n\nHmm, the code is processing each row, and for each character in the row (the cells), it's checking if it's an 'R'. The minx variable is initialized to 0 and when a robot is found, if minx is 0, then minx is set to b1 (the current column number, but since it's counting down from b to 0, maybe b1 represents the original column index? Wait, maybe the loop is written in a way that b1 starts at the current row's length (m) and decrements, so when b1 is m, it's the first character (column 1?), or maybe columns are numbered from 1 to m. Wait, the problem says the upper left corner is the first cell. So perhaps the code is trying to track the minimal column position for robots?\n\nWait, the code's comments mention that minx is actually a max because it's reading the array in reverse. Oh right, because in the loops, for each row, the columns are processed from the end (b1 starts at b and goes down). So for each robot in the row, the code is tracking the maximum column (since moving from right to left). Wait no, if minx is initially 0, and when a robot is found, minx is set to b1 (which is the original column number?), then if another robot is to the right (since we're going from right to left, then that's lower b1?), no, maybe I'm confused here.\n\nWait, let's think again. Let's parse the code step by step. The loops for each test case:\n\nThey read a and b (n and m). Then for each a (rows), they process each row. The inner loop for b1 starts at b, then decrements to 0. For each character in the row (since each row has m characters), they read the character. \n\nThe code does:\n\nfor (each row from a down to 1?)\n\nWait, the loop for a starts with a being the number of rows, and loops while a>0. So for each row, starting from the first (since it's the first row?), but maybe the first row is read first. But the rows are processed in order? So the first row is the top row (since rows are numbered from 1 to a, perhaps). But the problem's upper left corner is the top left cell, which would be row 1, column 1 (assuming 1-based index).\n\nThe code's for loops for each row:\n\nfor (a starts at n; a>0, decreasing each time, so the first iteration is the first row (since when a is n, then a decreases to n-1... so the loop runs from row n down to 1, meaning that the code is processing the rows in reverse order? Like the first row comes last?)\n\nHmm, that might complicate things. Wait, perhaps the code is processing rows from bottom to top. Because if a starts at n (the total number of rows), and we decrement a each time, then the first row processed is the nth row (the bottom row), then the n-1, etc. So when the code is reading rows, it's processing them in reverse order of the input. That's important. So the first row (top row) is read last.\n\nThe code's variables:\n\nminx is initialized to 0. Then, for each character in each row, when it's an 'R', they check if minx is 0. If so, they set minx to b1 (the current column position in the loop). Otherwise, if minx is less than b1, then the TODO is here. So, perhaps minx is tracking the minimal column coordinate (since b1 is the current column, which is moving from right to left, so higher b1 would be leftwards?), but I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the inner loop for each row is for b1 starting at b (the m value) down to 1? Because the loop is for(b1 = b; b1>0; --b1). So each iteration of b1 is going from m down to 1. So for the first character in a row (the first column, when b1 = m?), no, wait, suppose m is 5. Then when b1 starts at 5 and goes down to 1. So the first character in the row (column 1) would be read when b1 is 5? Wait no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the row's string is \"ABCDE\" (columns 1 to 5). The first character (column 1) is 'A', but if b1 starts at m=5 and decreases, then the first loop iteration (b1=5) would be the fifth character, which is 'E', which is column 5. Then next b1=4 is 'D' (column4), etc. So the loop is processing the columns from right to left. So in each row, the code is processing each column from right to left (from the last column to the first). \n\nNow, the code checks for 'R's. For each R found:\n\n- The first R encountered in the processing (starting from the right) will set minx to b1 (the column number). Then, if another R is found further to the left (smaller b1?), then since minx was already set to a higher value, the condition \"if minx < b1\" would not hold. Wait, no. Wait, in the first occurrence of an R, minx was 0, so we set minx = b1. Then, in the next R, since minx is now b1 (the previous column), which is higher than this new b1 (since we are moving left, so current b1 is smaller?), then minx < new_b1 is false. So the condition is \"if minx < b1\", which would only be true if the new R is to the right (higher b1 than minx). But since we're processing right to left, any R encountered after the first would have a lower b1. \n\nWait, the first R found in a row (processing from right to left) would have the largest column (since we start from the right). So minx is tracking the maximum column position of any robot in that row? Or maybe the minimal column? Not sure. \n\nHmm, perhaps the variable minx is intended to track the minimal column position (the leftmost column in which any robot exists in the current row). Because the code is processing left to right? Or in the way it's written, the minx is set to the first robot's column (rightmost robot in the row). Then, any next R in that row would be to the left of that robot. So for example, in a row with robots at columns 3 and 5 (assuming m is 5), first the code would process column 5 (b1=5) first (since that's the first in the loop), so minx is set to 5. Then, when it processes column 3 (b1=3), since minx (5) is not less than current b1 (3), so the condition would not trigger. So minx would remain at 5. \n\nBut then, the code's comment says minx is actually a max, since it's reading in reverse. Wait, the comment says \"minx is actually max as we read array in reverse\". So perhaps minx is storing the maximum column (the rightmost robot in that row). \n\nThe code is processing each row from bottom to top (since the outer loop is going from a down to 1). So for each row, starting from the bottom (the last row in the input, first processed), then moving up. \n\nThe idea here might be to track for each row whether the robots can move in such a way that eventually, one can reach the top-left corner. \n\nWait, the problem requires that at least one robot can reach the upper left corner, without any robot exploding during any move. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the leftmost and topmost positions of the robots. But I'm not sure how the current code's logic is connected to solving the problem.\n\nLooking at the code's structure, after processing all rows, there's a check variable (check=1 initially), and if check remains 1, then the output is \"YES\", else \"NO\". So the code is trying to set check to 0 if it's impossible. \n\nSo the TODO is in the line where minx is compared to b1, and if the condition is true, then what code is needed here. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nif (c == 'R') then:\n\nif minx ==0 \u2192 set minx to b1 (the column of the first R in this row). \n\nElse if (minx < b1) \u2192 do something here (the code is here). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the minimum column (leftmost) position of robots across the rows. But not sure. Let me think differently. \n\nThe upper left corner is cell (1,1) assuming 1-based indexing. For a robot to get there, it must be able to move left and up steps such that in some command sequence, it ends up there. \n\nThe key idea is that all robots must not move outside the grid in any step, and that at least one robot can reach the target. \n\nLet me think of the constraints. \n\nSuppose the robot is in (x,y). To reach (1,1), the robot needs to move left (decrease column) and up (decrease row). \n\nBut all robots move simultaneously each step. \n\nWait, the problem requires that after some sequence of commands, at least one robot is in (1,1). Also, during all steps, no robot steps outside.\n\nSo the idea is to choose a sequence of moves such that after each move, all robots stay within the grid, and at least one ends up at (1,1).\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to find whether there exists a position (x,y) such that all robots are to the right (y \u2265 1) and below (x \u2265 1) their current positions, but can reach (1,1) via movements without stepping out. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nFor a robot to reach the top-left corner, it must have a path of moves that, in the sequence chosen, ends there. But all other robots must not explode during any step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the robots can be considered in such a way that their paths are compatible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal column for all robots in each row must be at least 1 (so they can move left) and the rows must be such that the robot can move up. \n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to check whether all robots are in positions such that their columns are \u2265 some value, and rows are \u2265 some value, such that after moving left and up steps, one can reach (1,1) without any robot moving outside in any step. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is that the robot must be able to get to (1,1) by moving only left and up commands. But for that, perhaps the minimal column for any robot in a row must be at least 1, and the rows must be at least 1, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following condition must hold: For every robot in a row, the robot's column must be \u2265 the target column (1) and the row must be \u2265 target row (1). \n\nWait, more precisely, suppose that in each row, the leftmost robot (the smallest column in that row) is to the right of or equal to 1, and all robots in that row can be moved left to reach column 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the robot to reach (1,1), it must be possible that when moving left and up, all robots' paths do not cause any to go out of bounds.\n\nWait, perhaps the key condition is that for all robots, their starting positions must allow them to move left and up without ever stepping out of the grid when moving towards (1,1). \n\nWait, but since all robots move at once, if you choose to move left, all robots move left. So, for a robot to reach (1,1), perhaps the robot must have a path where, for each direction chosen in the commands, all robots stay within the grid. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be rephrased as follows: there must exist a set of commands (directions) such that after executing them in some order, one robot reaches (1,1), and in every step before that, no robot steps outside the grid.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key insight is that the leftmost robot in every row must be at least column 1 (which they already are) but also that the rows must be arranged in a way that the robots can move up. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: the minimal column of all robots in each row must be at least 1 (which it is) but also, the robot must be able to move into the target without any robot in higher rows (lower row numbers) being blocked. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that there exists a row (the top one, row 1), and in that row, there is at least one robot in column 1. If so, then the answer is \"YES\". Otherwise, for the robot to reach the top-left, all robots must be able to move in such a way that their paths don't cause any to step outside. \n\nWait, maybe the key is to track for each row, the minimal column of the robots in that row. Let me think of the rows from top to bottom. \n\nSuppose in the top row (row 1), there is a robot in column 1: then the answer is yes. \n\nOtherwise, if there is a robot in row 1, but not in column 1, then perhaps they can move left, but must not have other robots in lower rows (rows below) that would prevent their movement. \n\nAlternatively, the critical point is that in order to have a robot move left into column 1, any robot in the same row must also be able to move left to at least column 1, but since they can move in any sequence, perhaps the leftmost robot in each row must be at least 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the necessary condition is that for all robots in rows above or equal to some row, their columns must be >= 1, but that's trivial. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to see that for all robots, their column is >=1 and row >=1 (obviously true), but also that the leftmost column in each row is at least 1, which is always true.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that in the first row (the top row), there's at least one robot in column 1, or else, in order to bring a robot to the first column, all robots in that row must be able to move left without any of them going beyond column 1. \n\nWait, when moving left, all robots move left. So if in the top row, there's a robot in column 2, then a move left would take it to column 1. But if there's a robot in column 0 (impossible), but in practice, moving left from column 1 would be invalid. So to have a robot reach column 1, in their current column must be at least 1, but when you move left, they move to column current-1. So to reach column 1, you need that in some command sequence, you can move until they are at column 1. \n\nBut all robots must not explode in any step. So in every move, when you issue a command, all robots must stay within the grid. \n\nSuppose you want to move left until one robot reaches column 1. For that, in each step until then, all robots must be in columns >=1. \n\nBut since all robots move together, perhaps the minimal column among all robots in any row must be at least 1, but that's already true. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that after some number of commands, at least one robot is at (1,1). \n\nMaybe the key is to find that the leftmost robot in the top row is exactly at column 1, or can be moved there without any robot in other rows moving out. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as:\n\nThere exists a direction sequence such that:\n\n- After all moves, one robot is at (1,1).\n\n- For each move in the sequence, all robots move into the grid.\n\nSo, for this to be possible, there must be a robot which can, when moving left and up steps, reach (1,1) without any of their move steps causing any robot to go out of bounds. \n\nWait, perhaps the critical point is to find a robot whose row is at least 1 (obviously) and column is at least 1. To get to (1,1), the robot needs to move left (column -1 each step) until it reaches column 1, and move up (row -1 each step) until it reaches row 1. \n\nBut all other robots must not step outside during those moves. \n\nSo for the robot to be able to move up and left, the path must not cause any robot (including itself) to go out. \n\nFor example, suppose there's a robot in row 3, column 5. To reach the top-left, they must move up two times and left four times. \n\nBut during those moves, all other robots must also move up/down/left/right (depending on the commands) such that none step out. \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to consider that in order for any robot to reach (1,1), all robots must be in positions where their rows are >=1, columns >=1, and also such that there exists a column c and row r where some robot is at (r, c), and for every step towards (1,1), the moves are possible without any robot exiting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be thought of as for a robot to reach (1,1), all robots in rows above it must be able to be moved without going out of bounds. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the code's current structure. The code is processing rows in reverse (from bottom to top) and for each row's robots, tracking the minimal column (or the leftmost). \n\nWait, the code has a variable minx, which is initialized to 0. For each robot in a row (processed from right to left), when minx is 0 (meaning this is the first robot in this row encountered), then minx is set to the current column (b1). Then, for other robots in the same row, if their column (b1) is less than minx (since we are processing from right to left, the next robot is to the left, so lower b1), then the condition minx < b1 is false, so nothing is done. \n\nWait, so minx is set to the first robot's column (rightmost in the row), then subsequent robots in the row are to the left (smaller b1), so minx remains as the rightmost robot's column. \n\nWait, so the code is tracking, for each row, the rightmost robot's column. \n\nThen, when processing the next rows (the rows above the current one, since we're going from bottom to top), perhaps the code is checking that the rightmost robot in the current row is not to the left of the rightmost robot in the previous rows. Because if so, then when moving left, robots in upper rows might be blocked?\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that for each row, the rightmost robot in that row is not to the right of the rightmost robot in the rows above. Because if that's the case, then when moving left, the robots in lower rows are further to the right, which might not allow the upper robots to move enough to reach the target without others stepping out. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think of the rows in reverse (bottom to top). For each row, the rightmost robot's column must be <= the rightmost robot's column of the row above. \n\nBecause, if in a lower row (processed first in bottom to top) there's a robot to the right of a robot in an upper row, then when moving left, the lower row's robot can move left, but the upper row's robot, which is to the left, can't move past certain points. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary condition is that for each row (starting from the bottom upwards), the rightmost robot in that row must be to the left of or equal to the rightmost robot in the rows above. \n\nBecause, imagine that in a lower row, there is a robot further to the right than the upper rows. When moving left, the lower robot can move left but the upper ones can't, so the upper robots would block the path? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the critical observation is that in order to have all robots not explode when moving left, all robots must be able to move left until they are at column 1. \n\nWait, let's think: To reach (1,1), you need to move all robots (for those that can) to the left until one is in column 1. But during that process, every time you issue a left command, all robots must not go beyond column 0. \n\nSo, if in any row, there is a robot whose current column is less than the minimal column of some row above it, then when moving left, that robot might be blocked. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal column (the leftmost) in the rows must be non-increasing as you move up. \n\nWait, here's an idea from the problem's examples. Let's look at the second test case in the notes: \n\n\"In the second test case, if you try to send any command, at least one robot explodes.\"\n\nSuppose the scenario is that there are robots in positions that, when moving any direction, cause at least one to go out. \n\nAnother example: in the first test case, the command is left, so all robots must move left, but none can go out. \n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is that the rightmost robot in each row must be at position >= their row's column's constraints. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the code's approach. The code processes each row from bottom to top and for each row, tracks the rightmost robot (the maximum column in that row). \n\nThe code's variables 'minx' (but the comment says minx is actually the max because of the reverse reading) might be tracking the maximum column (rightmost) among all previous rows (since we're processing bottom up). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum column of the rightmost robot encountered so far. \n\nInitially, minx is 0. For each row (starting from bottom), when processing that row, if the row has a robot, then the current row's rightmost robot's column is compared to the previous minx. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe code is for each row (starting from bottom to top):\n\nFor each row's columns from right to left (so first processing the rightmost column in the row):\n\nWhen a robot is found, the first robot (rightmost in the row) sets minx to its column (b1). \n\nThen, for other robots in the same row (to the left), since their b1 is smaller than minx (since minx is the rightmost column found so far in this row), so the condition (if minx < b1) is false, so nothing is done. \n\nWait, so after processing that row, the minx is the column of the rightmost robot in this row. \n\nWait, but the code's minx variable is initialized to 0 at the start of each test case. Then, for the first row (bottom row), the minx is set to the rightmost robot's column. \n\nThen, moving up to the next row (the one above the bottom), the code processes this row, and for each robot in it:\n\nIf it's the first robot (rightmost in this row), then minx is set to its column. \n\nWait, but previously, minx was set to the bottom row's rightmost position. So, for example, if the current row's rightmost is to the right of the previous minx (i.e., current b1 > previous minx), then minx would be set to that value? Or not? \n\nWait, no. Let's walk through step by step:\n\nSuppose the first row processed (bottom row) has a rightmost robot at column 5 (b1=5). Then minx becomes 5. \n\nThen, moving to the next row (row above bottom). Suppose this row's rightmost robot is at column 3 (b1=3). \n\nWhen processing this row's first robot (rightmost, so b1=3):\n\nThe code checks if minx is 0 (it's not, since it's 5), then checks if minx (5) < current b1 (3). Since 5 < 3 is false, so the code does nothing. \n\nWait, so in this case, the minx remains at 5. \n\nHmm, but that's not tracking the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be tracking the maximum column of all the rightmost robots encountered so far. \n\nWait, in this case, the new row's rightmost is 3, which is less than previous 5. The maximum remains 5. \n\nBut suppose the new row's rightmost is 6 (assuming m is 6). Then, since minx is 5, and the new b1 is 6, then the condition minx (5) < b1 (6) is true. So in that case, the code would need to set minx to 6. \n\nAh, so the code's condition is: for each row, the current row's rightmost robot's column (b1) must be <= the previous minx (the maximum so far). \n\nWait, no. The code has:\n\nif (c == 'R') \u2192 first robot in this row (rightmost):\n\n   if minx ==0 \u2192 set minx = b1.\n\nElse:\n\n   if (minx < b1) \u2192 then we have a problem, so set check to 0?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's intention is: \n\nThe minx variable represents the maximum column that any robot has been allowed to be in previous rows (since we process from bottom up). \n\nFor each new row (processing upwards), the current row's rightmost robot must be to the left (<=) of that max column (minx). \n\nBecause, otherwise, if the current row's rightmost is to the right of minx (previous max), then when moving left, that robot would have to move past minx's limit, but previous rows' robots are to the left of that? Not sure. \n\nThe condition would be that the current row's rightmost robot's column is greater than the previous max (minx), meaning that this row's robot is to the right of the previous max, which might cause a problem when moving left. \n\nAh, so here's the idea: \n\nWe need all robots to be able to move left until their column is 1. \n\nTo ensure that, the rightmost robot in each row must be to the left of or equal to the previous rows' rightmost. \n\nWait, that way, as we process rows from bottom to top, the rightmost robot can't be to the right of the rows above. \n\nWait, no, because when processing bottom-up, the first row (bottom) has a certain rightmost. The row above could have a rightmost to the right of it, which would mean that when moving left, that upper row's robot is further right and would require the lower row's robots to also move left, but they can't go beyond the current minx. \n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that each row's rightmost must not exceed the previous maximum (the minx). \n\nSo the code's check is: \n\nWhen processing a row, if the current row's rightmost (b1) is greater than the current minx (which is the maximum so far), then it's impossible. \n\nSo the code can set check to 0 in that case. \n\nTherefore, the code should do:\n\nIn the TODO section (the else if part), where if minx < b1, then we have a problem. \n\nSo the code should set check = 0. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose, after the first row (bottom) has rightmost 5, so minx =5. \n\nSecond row's rightmost is 6. \n\nThen, in that case, the code would check if (minx < b1 \u2192 5 <6 \u2192 yes). Then the code would do the TODO: which is setting check to 0. So check would become 0, and the answer would be NO. \n\nBut why is that a problem?\n\nBecause in order to move robots left, the upper row's robot is at column 6. When moving left, that robot would reach column 5, then 4, etc. But the lower row's robot is at 5. \n\nWait, but the lower row's robot is okay. But if the upper row's robot is to the right of the lower row's previous max, then when moving left, the upper robot can move left, but why is that a problem? \n\nHmm, maybe the issue is that for the upper rows, their rightmost must be <= the rightmost of the lower rows. Because otherwise, when you move left, the upper robot will need to move left multiple times, but in some steps, the robot in the lower row may have already moved to the left beyond the current position, but that's okay?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is that when moving left, if an upper row has a robot to the right of lower rows' robots, then when moving left, that upper row's robot might need to move further left than the lower rows' robots, but that's allowed as long as they don't go out of bounds. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition. \n\nMaybe the idea is that the rightmost robot in any row must not be to the right of the rightmost robot in the rows below it. Because otherwise, when moving left, the upper robot would need to move past the lower row's rightmost position, but the lower rows' robots are already as far left as possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the following scenario:\n\nRow 2 (lower row) has a rightmost at column 3. \n\nRow 1 (upper row) has a rightmost at column 4. \n\nThen, when you try to move left to get the upper robot to column 1, you have to move left until you reach column 1. \n\nThe row 1's robot starts at 4, so after moving left three times, it's at column 1. \n\nThe row 2 robot starts at 3, so after three left moves, it would be at 0, which is invalid. \n\nAh! Oh right! Because the lower row's robot might not be able to move enough steps to the left without stepping out. \n\nSo that scenario is invalid, so in this case, the upper row's rightmost is to the right of the lower row's rightmost. So the rightmost column (4 for upper) is larger than the lower's (3). \n\nThis would mean that when moving left enough times to get the upper robot to column 1, the lower robot would go to 0, which explodes. \n\nTherefore, in such a case, it would be impossible. \n\nTherefore, the condition is that for every row, the rightmost robot in that row must be <= the rightmost robot in the row below. \n\nSo processing from bottom to top (since rows are processed in reverse), the maximum rightmost so far (minx) must be >= the current row's rightmost. \n\nThus, when processing a row, we can compute its rightmost (current_max = b1 of the first R encountered in this row's right-to-left processing). \n\nThen, if current_max > minx (the previous maximum), then this is invalid \u2192 set check to 0. \n\nOtherwise, we update minx to be the minimum between current_max and minx? Wait no, since minx is the maximum so far. \n\nWait, no: the previous minx holds the maximum rightmost of all the rows processed so far (since we are going from bottom up). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nInitially, minx is 0. \n\nProcessing the first row (bottom row):\n\ncurrent_max is the rightmost R in this row's columns. \n\nSet minx to current_max. \n\nThen next row (row above it):\n\ncurrent_max is the rightmost R in this row. \n\nCheck if current_max > minx. \n\nIf yes \u2192 set check to 0. \n\nElse, minx remains as the previous max (since current_max is smaller or equal to previous minx \u2192 the new max is still the previous minx). \n\nWait, but then we need to store the current_max as the new minx? Or not? \n\nWait, no. Because minx should be the previous maximum. \n\nWait, for example, if minx is 5 (previous rows' max), and current_max is 3 \u2192 the new max remains 5. \n\nBecause the previous rows below have a rightmost at 5, and the current row has 3, so the maximum across all processed rows is 5. \n\nThus, minx should remain 5. \n\nTherefore, the condition is:\n\nfor each row, if current_max > minx \u2192 invalid \u2192 check=0. \n\nOtherwise, proceed, and minx remains as it was. \n\nWait, but then the minx is not changing. \n\nWait, that's correct. Because the max of all previous rows is the maximum so far, so if current row's current_max is less than that, the maximum remains the same. \n\nOnly when current_max exceeds the previous minx, then it's bad. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic should be:\n\nFor each row processed from bottom to top:\n\n- compute current_max as the rightmost R in this row (the first R encountered when processing the row from right to left). \n\n- if current_max > minx (the previous maximum):\n\n   set check to 0. \n\n- else:\n\n   set minx to current_max (no, wait, no. Because if current_max is less than previous minx, the max is still the previous minx. So we shouldn't set minx to current_max. \n\nWait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, the current row's rightmost must be <= previous rows' maximum (minx). \n\nSo, the new maximum (after considering this row) is min(minx, current_max)? \n\nNo, that would be incorrect. \n\nBecause the previous rows' max was minx, which was the maximum of all rows below. \n\nNow, this row's current_max must be <= minx. \n\nThus, the new maximum (the maximum of all rows processed so far) is still minx. \n\nThus, minx should not be updated. \n\nAh! Oh right. \n\nThus, the code should not update minx in the case where current_max is smaller or equal. \n\nOnly when current_max is larger (which is invalid and thus we set check to 0). \n\nTherefore, the code's variables:\n\nminx starts as 0. \n\nFor each row in bottom to top:\n\n   compute current_max (the rightmost R in this row). \n\n   if current_max > minx \u2192 check =0, break (or continue processing but check remains 0). \n\n   else \u2192 nothing, minx remains as it is. \n\nWait, but how is current_max computed?\n\nThe code currently has: \n\nFor each row, the first R found in the row's processing (right to left) is the rightmost. So the first R encountered in the row is the rightmost. \n\nThus, the code can store that as current_max. \n\nThe code's current code is: \n\nIn the first R in the row, when minx is 0 (meaning it's the first row processed), then minx is set to b1. \n\nElse, if minx < b1 \u2192 then current_max (b1) is larger than previous minx \u2192 invalid. \n\nThus, in the \"else if (minx < b1)\" case, we can set check=0. \n\nWait, but this only checks for the first R in the row, but the other robots in the same row may not be considered. \n\nWait, no. Because the current_max is the first R encountered (rightmost), so the other robots in the row are to the left (smaller b1), so their positions are automatically <= current_max. \n\nTherefore the rightmost robot of this row is current_max. \n\nThus, the code's logic is:\n\nWhen processing the row, the first R (rightmost) sets the current_max. \n\nIf minx is 0 (i.e., first row being processed), then minx becomes current_max. \n\nElse, if current_max (b1) > minx \u2192 then we set check=0. \n\nElse, do nothing, since the current_max is within the permissible limit. \n\nAh, but the code's current code has:\n\nThe first R in the row (rightmost) sets minx to b1 only when minx is 0. \n\nFor other rows, when processing another R (but it's the first in that row), it will compare if minx < b1. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose:\n\nRow 1 (bottom row) has a rightmost at column 5 \u2192 minx is set to 5.\n\nRow 2 (next up) has a rightmost at column 3. \n\nWhen processing that row's first R (column 3):\n\nminx is 5, which is not zero. \n\nCheck if minx < b1 (5 < 3 \u2192 no). So the condition is false, so nothing happens. So minx stays at 5. \n\nWhich is correct, since current_max (3) is less than previous minx (5). \n\nThen, the code proceeds. \n\nAnother example where current_max is larger than previous minx:\n\nRow 1 (bottom) has a rightmost at 3 \u2192 minx is 3. \n\nRow 2 (above) has a rightmost at 4 \u2192 then, when processing that row's first R (b1=4), since minx (3) <4 \u2192 the condition is true. \n\nThus, in the TODO section, we should set check to 0. \n\nSo the missing code is to set check = 0. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nelse if (minx < b1) { check = 0; }\n\nWait, but why do we set check to 0 here? Because it's impossible. \n\nYes, because in this case, the row's rightmost is to the right of the previous rows' max. \n\nHence, any left command that would allow the upper rows' R to reach column 1 would require that the lower rows' robots move left enough steps to not go beyond their columns. \n\nWait, let's take the example where row 2 (upper) has rightmost at 4, while row 1 (lower) has 3. \n\nSuppose we want to move left until the upper R is at column 1. \n\nThe upper R would move left 3 steps (4-1=3 steps). \n\nLower R is at 3 \u2192 moving left 3 steps would take it to 0 \u2192 which is outside \u2192 explosion. \n\nHence it's impossible. \n\nThus, the code correctly sets check to 0 in this case. \n\nThus, the missing code is \"check = 0;\". \n\nNow, what about the initial condition where there's already a robot in the top-left corner?\n\nLike the fourth test case in the note: \n\n\"In the fourth test case, there is already a robot in the upper left corner.\" \u2192 answer is YES. \n\nIn this case, during processing:\n\nThe rows are processed from bottom to top. The top row is the last row processed. \n\nSuppose the top row's rightmost is column 1 (since the robot is in (1,1)). \n\nThe bottom rows, if any, would have their rightmost columns >=1, but not exceeding previous minx. \n\nThus, the check would remain 1, so output is YES. \n\nAnother example: the first test case where the command is left. \n\nSuppose the robots are in, say, column 2. The first row (top row) has robots in column 2. \n\nProcessing from bottom to top, but suppose there are only two rows. \n\nAssuming the bottom row has a rightmost, say, column 3, but the top row has a robot in column 2. \n\nThen the top row's rightmost is 2, which is <= previous minx (3). So check remains 1. \n\nThus, the code would print YES. \n\nAnother case: if in the top row, there is a robot in column 1, then after processing all rows, check remains 1 \u2192 YES. \n\nNow, what about the sixth test case, where any move causes explosion. \n\nMaybe in that case, there is a robot in a column that would require other robots to move out. \n\nThe code's check would have been set to 0. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nNow, looking back at the code:\n\nThe code initializes check=1. \n\nFor each row (from bottom to top):\n\n   For each column in the row, processed from right to left:\n\n      if the character is 'R':\n\n         if minx ==0 (first R in this row \u2192 rightmost):\n\n             minx = b1.\n\n         else if (minx < b1) \u2192 meaning this row's current R is to the right of previous max \u2192 set check=0. \n\n         else \u2192 do nothing. \n\nWait, but how does this track all rows? Because for subsequent rows, the first R encountered (rightmost) is compared to the previous minx. \n\nWait, but the code only checks the first R (the rightmost) of each row. So this correctly captures the current_max for each row. \n\nThus, the missing code is \"check = 0;\". \n\nAdditionally, in the case where there are no robots in a row (but the problem states that each test case has at least one robot). \n\nThus, the code should do as above. \n\nTherefore, the missing line is:\n\ncheck = 0;\n\nThus, putting it in the code's TODO section: \n\nelse if (minx < b1) check = 0;\n\nWait, but in the code's structure, it's an if statement inside the 'if(c==82)' (R). \n\nSo the code's current line is:\n\nelse     if(minx < b1) {/* TODO: Your code here */}\n\nThus, the missing code is simply \"check = 0;\". \n\nSo the complete line is: \n\nelse if (minx < b1) check = 0;\n\nHence, the missing code is \"check = 0;\"\n\nYes, that should be the answer."
