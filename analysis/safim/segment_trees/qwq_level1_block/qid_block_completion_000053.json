The first test case had n=7, m=5 (since Megan went to (7,3) which is in a 7 row). The total energy was 15. Let's compute the formula for that case:\n\nThe original total without portals would be (7+5-2)*2= 10 *2=20. The actual is 15, so a saving of 5. Hmm. Let's see 20 -5=15. Another example, for 3x3: the original is 8, and the saving can be 1 gives 7. Which matches the example I thought of earlier. So how to find the saving? Wait, what's the maximum possible saving?",

But maybe there's a better option where Megan takes a different path. Wait, perhaps Megan can choose to go to her destination via another route so that both can save more steps. Alternatively, maybe the minimal total is the minimum between n +2m -2 and m +2n - 2. Wait in the first example, n=7 and m=5, the first option (n+2m-2) is 7 + 10-2 =15, which matches. If we had n=5 and m=7, then the first option would be 5 + 14-2=17, while the second option (m +2n-2) would be7 +10-2=15, so better.

Wait yes. So the minimal between those two terms. So which one is smaller? It depends on whether n is smaller or larger than m. \n\nFor example, when n=7 and m=5: 7+10=17 vs 14+5=19 \u2192 the first is better. So min is 17, subtract 2 gives 15 (as before). When n=5 and m=7: 5+14=19 vs 10+7=17 \u2192 the second is better, so 17-2=15. So yes, the minimal between the two gives the correct result. So the formula is min(n + 2*m, 2*n + m) - 2.

So the formula isn't perfect. Let's see what the problem says for this case. In the problem statement, when n=1 and m=1:\n\nStanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (1,1), so 0.",

The formula is derived from the case where both can teleport to Megan's starting point or Megan's path allows for that. But when n=1 and m=1, Megan's path is trivial (start is end), so she doesn't move, so the portals are just at (1,1). Thus, both are already at their destinations, so the total is 0. Hmm, so maybe the formula's edge case is when either n or m is 1. Alternatively, perhaps there is another condition: when either n or m is 1, then the minimal total is (something else). Wait let me think of when m=1. If m=1, then the grid is n rows and 1 column. Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (n, 1). So his path is (n-1) steps down. Megan starts at (n,1) and needs to go to (1,1). So her path is (n-1) steps up. Total without portals would be 2*(n-1). With portals: Megan's path is the vertical line.

Megan's path is 1. Total 2. So yes. So the formula holds. The only case it fails is when n and m are both 1. So in code, we can handle the case when n ==1 and m ==1, output 0, else compute the min of (n+2m, 2n+m) minus 2. Wait another edge case: when n=1 and m=3:\n\nThen, according to formula: min(1+6, 2*1 +3)= min(7,5) \u21925 \u21925-2=3. Let's see:\n\nMegan's path is from (1,1) to (1,3). So two steps right. Her path length is 2. Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) \u2192 cost 1. Total: 1+2 =3, which is correct. Yes. So the formula seems to work except when both are 1. Therefore, the code should be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nif n ==1 and m ==1 \u2192 output 0\n\nelse \u2192 output min(n+2*m, 2*n + m) -2\n\nLet me confirm with the first example:\n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 min(7+10=17, 14+5=19 \u219217 \u219217-2=15. Correct. Another test case: n=3,3 \u2192 min(3+6=9 vs 6+3=9 \u21929-2=7 \u2192 correct. Another case where n=5 and m=7: the formula gives min(5+14=19 vs 10+7=17 \u219217-2=15. So now, the code can be written as follows: In the code, for each test case, read n and m. \n\nif n ==1 and m ==1 \u2192 print 0\n\nelse:\n\ncompute the two terms (n + 2*m) and (2*n +m), take the minimum between them, subtract 2, and print that. So now, implementing this in code. The code given is Java. The current code has the main loop, and inside the loop, we need to compute this. So inside the loop:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nint m = sc.nextInt();\n\nif (n ==1 && m ==1) System.out.println(0);\n\nelse {\n\n    int a = n + 2*m;\n\n    int b = 2*n + m;\n\n    int res = Math.min(a, b) -2;\n\n    System.out.println(res);\n\n} Wait but wait, what about when n=1 and m>1?\n\nLike n=1, m=2: the code would compute min(1+4=5, 2 +2=4 \u21924-2=2 \u2192 correct. Similarly, m=1 and n>1: works. So yes, this should handle all cases except the n=1 and m=1. Thus, the missing code is the part inside the while loop. So the code will be:\n\nimport java.util. *;\npublic class Main\n{\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tScanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);\n\t\tint t=sc.nextInt();\n\t\twhile(t-->0)\n\t\t{\n\t\t    int n = sc.nextInt();\n\t\t    int m = sc.nextInt();\n\t\t    if(n == 1 && m ==1){\n\t\t        System.out.println(0);\n\t\t        continue;\n\t\t    }\n\t\t    int a = n + 2*m;\n\t\t    int b = 2*n + m;\n\t\t    int ans = Math.min(a, b) - 2;\n\t\t    System.out.println(ans);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n} Wait, let me check the n=1 and m=1 case again. Yes, in that case, the code outputs 0, which is correct. Another case n=2, m=2 \u2192 outputs min(2+4=6, 4+2=6 \u21926-2=4 \u2192 correct. Another test case where n=1 and m=1, outputs 0. Thus this should be correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the minimal total energy required for Stanley and Megan to reach their destinations. Hmm, the problem statement says they can use portals left by Megan's path. Oh right, Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So whenever either of them is in a cell with a portal, they can teleport to any other portal cell with 1 unit of power. \n\nThe key here is to figure out the optimal path where they use the portals in such a way that the total energy is minimized. Let's think about their paths and how portals can help.\n\nFirst, let's model their movements. Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to get to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and needs to go to (1,m). \n\nThe portals are placed along Megan's path. Since Megan can choose her path, we can choose her path such that the portals are placed in positions that help both of them save energy. \n\nThe problem is to find the best paths for both so that the sum of their individual minimal energies is as small as possible. But since Megan leaves portals along her path, the order in which they move and the timing might not matter here. The portals are left in all cells she visits, so the key is to choose Megan's path such that both can take advantage of the portals.\n\nWait, the note in the problem gives an example. Let me look at that. In the first test case, Megan moves to (7,3), then to (1,3). So her path is from (n,1) to (7,3) to (1,3) then to (1,m). The portals are in those cells. Stanley uses the portal at (1,3) to teleport to (7,3), then proceeds. \n\nHmm, so the idea is that the portals allow both to teleport between points, which can reduce the distance they have to walk. The minimal total energy would involve making optimal use of these portals.\n\nSo, how do we model this? Let's think of the minimal path for both, considering the portals.\n\nLet me think of the minimal total energy as the sum of Stanley's path and Megan's path, but with the portals allowing teleportation. But since Megan's path determines the portals available, we need to choose her path such that both can take advantage of them optimally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy can be found by considering certain key points where they can teleport, such that their paths can be optimized.\n\nLet me think of the coordinates. Since they can move in any direction, perhaps the optimal path involves them meeting at some intermediate point where they can teleport.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total energy is a function of the grid dimensions. Let's see what the minimal possible total energy would be.\n\nLet me first calculate the minimal possible energy without any portals. For Stanley, the minimal steps would be moving right and down, so (n-1)+(m-1). Similarly for Megan, moving up and right: (n-1)+(m-1). The total would be 2*(n-1 + m-1). But with portals, they can do better.\n\nThe portals can be used to teleport between any two portal cells, so using portals can save on the distance. The key is to choose Megan's path so that the portals are placed in a way that allows both to minimize their steps.\n\nWait, Megan's path is the one that leaves the portals. So Megan's path must be chosen in such a way that the combination of their paths and the portals gives the minimal total. So we need to model the minimal total as the sum of their individual minimal paths, considering the portals along Megan's path.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total energy can be derived by considering the best possible scenario where they can teleport as much as possible. \n\nLet me think of the minimal possible total energy. Let's see:\n\nSuppose both can teleport as much as possible. The minimal possible would be when they can teleport directly to their destinations. But Megan's path must include the necessary portals for that. But Megan's path has to take her from (n,1) to (1,m). So the portals along her path must include at least the start and end points, but she can choose any path in between.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) minus some savings from the portals. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (S + M), where S is Stanley's minimal steps with the help of portals, and similarly for Megan. But to find the minimum possible, we need to choose Megan's path so that both can use portals optimally.\n\nLet me think of the problem as choosing Megan's path such that the sum of both their minimal paths (with portals) is minimized.\n\nLet me think of the optimal scenario. The best case for both is that they can teleport as much as possible. Let's see:\n\nSuppose Megan's path includes key points such that:\n\n- Stanley can teleport from his starting point to a point near his destination, and Megan can teleport similarly.\n\nBut Megan's path must be a path from (n,1) to (1,m). So perhaps the optimal is to choose Megan's path so that her path includes the intersection point of their paths, allowing both to teleport from there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (2*(n + m - 2) ) - some maximum possible saving. Let's think of the best case.\n\nWait, let's think of the minimal total energy. Let me consider the example given in the note. The first test case's input must have been n=7, m=5 (since Megan went to (7,3)), but the total energy was 15. Let's see:\n\nIn that case, the total without portals would have been (7+5-2)*2 = (10)*2=20. The actual total was 15, which is 5 less. So the portals saved 5 units.\n\nHmm, so how does that come about?\n\nIn that example, Megan's path includes (7,1) to (7,3) then to (1,3), then (1,5). \n\nStanley starts at (1,1), goes to (1,3) (using steps right 2 steps: cost 2 units), then uses the portal to teleport to (7,3) (cost 1). From there, he goes down to (7,5) (2 steps, cost 2). So total for Stanley: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5?\n\nWait, the note says Stanley's part was (2+6) + ...? Oh I might be miscalculating.\n\nWait the note says the total for Stanley is (2 + 6) + (2 +1 +2) + (2) = 15? Wait maybe I'm getting confused. Let me read again:\n\nThe note says Megan first moves to (7,3) (so that's moving right from (7,1) to (7,3), which is 2 steps, costing 2. Then she goes to (1,3): that's moving up 6 steps (since from row 7 to 1, that's 6 steps). So Megan's first part is 2+6 =8? Then Megan proceeds further.\n\nWait the total given in the note was 15, which is the sum of all their steps and portal uses. The breakdown is (Megan's 2+6) + (Stanley's 2+1+2) + (Megan's 2). Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. \n\nBut regardless, the example shows that choosing the right path for Megan can lead to significant savings.\n\nNow, the problem requires that for given n and m, find the minimal total energy. Let me think of the general case.\n\nLet me consider that the minimal total is (S + M), where S is Stanley's steps and M Megan's steps, but with the portals allowing them to teleport. The key is to model how the portals can reduce their path lengths.\n\nLet me think of the minimal total as (a + b) where a and b are their individual path costs, considering the best possible use of portals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is the Manhattan distance for Stanley plus that for Megan minus some overlaps where they can use the portals. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) ) - (some value). \n\nWait maybe there's a pattern here. Let me consider some small test cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=1, m=1. Both start and end at the same cell. So their energy is 0. But according to problem constraints, n and m can be 1. \n\nWait, in that case, Stanley's start and end are the same (1,1) so 0. Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, so Megan's start is (1,1) and end (1,1) as well. So total 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStanley needs to go from (1,1) to (2,2). The minimal steps without portals: 2 (right and down, or down then right). Megan has to go from (2,1) to (1,2). Her minimal steps are also 2 (up then right, or right then up). Total without portals would be 2+2=4.\n\nWith portals: Let's see. Megan's path can be (2,1) to (1,1) (moving up, then to (1,2). So her path is moving up (1 step), then right (1 step). So Megan's path length is 2. The portals are at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). \n\nSo Stanley can go from (1,1) (using the portal) to (2,1) but that might not help. Alternatively, Stanley's path: he can start at (1,1), then use portal to (1,2), but that's his destination? No, his destination is (2,2). Wait, in the case of 2x2 grid, Stanley needs to go to (2,2). \n\nWait perhaps the optimal path here is for Megan to take a path that allows both to teleport.\n\nSuppose Megan goes to (1,1) then (1,2). Then the portals are at those points. \n\nStanley's path: he can go from (1,1) directly, but he needs to reach (2,2). \n\nWait, he can walk down then right (cost 2). Alternatively, can he teleport? Let me see:\n\nIf Megan's path includes (2,1) (start), (1,1), (1,2). So the portals are at those points. \n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can go directly to (2,2) via moving down and right: 2 steps. But perhaps a better path: He can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) (cost 1), then move down to (2,2): that's a cost of 1 + 1 = 2, same as before. \n\nHmm, so no improvement here. So maybe in a 2x2 grid, the minimal energy is still 4?\n\nWait but Megan's path length is 2, so the total is 2 (Megan's) + 2 (Stanley's), totaling 4. So same as without portals. So maybe in this case, portals don't help. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a different way. Maybe Megan takes a different path?\n\nAlternatively, Megan's path could be (2,1) -> (2,2) (right) then up? Wait, no, since she needs to reach (1,2). Let me see:\n\nIf Megan takes path (2,1) to (2,2) (1 step right), then up to (1,2) (1 step up). Then her path length is 2. \n\nThen the portals are at (2,1), (2,2), (1,2). \n\nThen Stanley can go from (1,1) to (2,2) via:\n\nHe can go to (1,2) (cost 1 step right), then teleport to (2,2) (cost 1). Total cost 2, same as before. \n\nSo no gain. So the total is still 2+2=4. \n\nHmm. So perhaps in some cases, the portals don't help, but in other cases they do.\n\nWait let's think of a 3x3 grid. Let's say n=3, m=3.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1), needs to get to (3,3). Megan starts at (3,1) to (1,3).\n\nWithout portals, their total would be ( (3+3-2)*2 ) = 4*2=8. \n\nBut with portals, perhaps they can do better.\n\nSuppose Megan's path is (3,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,3). \n\nHer path length is 2 (right-up step?) or more precisely, moving from (3,1) to (2,2) is moving up and right, which takes two steps: up then right. So that's 2 steps, then to (1,3): another up and right, so two steps. Total Megan's path is 4 steps.\n\nThe portals are placed along her path. So the cells (3,1), (2,2), (1,3). \n\nNow Stanley can take the path:\n\n(1,1) -> use portal to (2,2) (cost 1), then from there move down to (3,2) (1 step), then right to (3,3) (1 step). Total for Stanley: 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nMegan's path: 4 steps. Total is 4+3 =7, which is better than 8. \n\nSo that's better. \n\nSo the key is to choose Megan's path such that the portals allow both to reduce their paths. \n\nHmm, how can I model this in code?\n\nPerhaps the minimal total energy can be found as follows:\n\nThe minimal total is (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) - (some function of n and m).\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy can be found by choosing the optimal point where they can teleport. The optimal point would be somewhere along their paths where the combined steps saved are maximized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (2*(n + m) - 4) minus the minimal of some terms.\n\nWait, let me think of the general case.\n\nSuppose Megan chooses a path that allows both to teleport through an intermediate point (a, b). \n\nThe idea is that both can use the portals present along Megan's path. The best point would be where the sum of the steps saved by using the portal is maximized.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is (Stanley's minimal path + Megan's minimal path) minus the maximum possible savings from the portals.\n\nBut how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( (n-1) + (m-1) ) + ( (n-1)+(m-1) ) - (distance between their paths' intersection and some points). Not sure.\n\nWait, the problem says that Megan can leave a portal in each cell she visits. So the portals form the path that Megan takes. So the portals are along Megan's path. \n\nSo whenever either can reach a portal along that path, they can teleport to any other portal in that path.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing Megan's path such that both can use portals to minimize their own paths.\n\nLet me think of the minimal total energy as the sum of the minimal path for Stanley and Megan, considering that they can use the portals along Megan's path.\n\nNow, to model this, the key is to find the optimal path for Megan such that the sum of their paths (with portals considered) is minimized.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nThe minimal total would be the minimal possible over all possible paths Megan can take, of (Stanley's path cost with the portals in Megan's path) + (Megan's path cost).\n\nSo we need to find the minimal over all Megan's paths of (S + M), where S is the minimal steps for Stanley using the portals along M's path, and M is the steps Megan took.\n\nBut since n and m can be up to 1e5, we can't iterate over all possible paths. We need a formula.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal path for Megan is such that her path allows both to use the portal at some point which is the most beneficial.\n\nLet me think of the minimal total energy as follows:\n\nThe minimal total is ( (distance_S) + (distance_M) ), where:\n\ndistance_S is the minimal steps for Stanley considering the portals.\n\ndistance_M is Megan's path distance (since that's the cost Megan pays to place the portals).\n\nBut the problem is to choose Megan's path to minimize the sum.\n\nWe need to model this in terms of n and m.\n\nLet me think of Megan's path. Let's assume that Megan's path is the optimal one, so we can model it in a way that allows us to compute the minimal sum.\n\nLet me think of Megan's path as moving from (n,1) to (1,m) through some points. The best path would be one that allows both Stanley and Megan to minimize their steps.\n\nSuppose Megan takes a path that goes from (n,1) to (1,1) then to (1,m). Let's see what that gives.\n\nIn this case, the portals are along her path: all the steps from (n,1) to (1,1) (moving up), then right to (1,m). \n\nThen, for Stanley, he can go from (1,1) (start) to his destination (n,m). But he can take the portal at (1,1) to any of the portals. Wait the portals along Megan's path include (1,1) and (1,m). So he can teleport from (1,1) directly to (1,m), which is his destination? Wait no, his destination is (n, m), not (1,m). Oh right. Wait Stanley's destination is (n,m), Megan's is (1,m).\n\nHmm. So in that case, the portals along Megan's path would help Stanley reach (n,m) via some point.\n\nWait, perhaps the best path for Megan is to cross through a point that allows both to minimize their paths. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal possible energy is ( (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) ) - ( (distance between Megan's path and Stanley's optimal path) ) but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be expressed as (2*(n + m - 2) - (n - 1) - (m - 1)) ? Not sure.\n\nWait, let me think of the example given. The first test case had n=7, m=5 (since Megan went to (7,3) which is in a 7 row). The total energy was 15. Let's compute the formula for that case:\n\nThe original total without portals would be (7+5-2)*2= 10 *2=20. The actual is 15, so a saving of 5.\n\nHmm. Let's see 20 -5=15.\n\nAnother example, for 3x3: the original is 8, and the saving can be 1 gives 7. Which matches the example I thought of earlier.\n\nSo how to find the saving?\n\nWait, what's the maximum possible saving?\n\nThe saving is the difference between the original (without portals) and the minimal possible.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal total is (2*(n+m-2) - (some value)).\n\nLet me think of the minimal total as ( (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) ) - ( (n-1) + (m-1) -1 ) ?\n\nWait, in the first example, 20 - (7-1 +5-1 -1) = 20 - (6+4-1) = 20-9=11. No, that's not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total is (2*(n + m - 2)) - (something else).\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the minimal total energy is the sum of the two paths, but when using portals, some of their paths can be covered via teleportation. The minimal sum would be when the portals allow them to 'jump' over some distance.\n\nSuppose that both can teleport to a common point.\n\nThe best case scenario is that they can teleport to an intermediate point that is on both their paths, thus saving steps.\n\nWait let's think of the Manhattan distance. Let me consider that Megan's path can be chosen such that her path allows both to teleport to a point that cuts their paths in half or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is:\n\nThe minimal possible energy is (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) minus the minimal between (n-1 + m-1) and something else. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (2*(m + n) - 4). Wait for the first example, 7+5=12, 2*12-4= 20, which is original. But that's not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 1) + (n + m - 1) - some function. Not sure.\n\nWait let me think of the problem in terms of the path of Megan.\n\nSuppose that Megan's path is such that she first goes up to (1,1) then to (1,m). Her path length is (n-1) + (m-1) steps. The portals are along that path. \n\nStanley's path can then be:\n\nFrom (1,1), he can teleport to (1,m) (cost 1) then go down to (n,m). The distance from (1,m) to (n,m) is (n-1) steps. So total for Stanley is 1 + (n-1) steps. So total for him is n steps. \n\nMegan's path is (n-1)+(m-1). \n\nTotal is (n) + (n +m -2) = 2n + m -2. \n\nWait for the first example, n=7, m=5. That gives 2*7 +5-2=14+3=17, which is more than the example's 15. So not optimal.\n\nHmm, so that path isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, suppose Megan takes a path that allows both to teleport to a point in the middle.\n\nSuppose Megan's path is such that she goes from (n,1) to (1,1) (moving up), then to (1, m). Then, Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,m) (cost 1), then go down to (n,m). So his total is 1 + (n-1) steps. Megan's path cost is (n-1)+(m-1).\n\nTotal is (n) + (n+m-2) = 2n + m-2.\n\nAlternatively, what's better is if Megan takes a path that allows them to teleport to a point which is on both paths.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal path for Megan is such that she and Stanley cross paths at some point, allowing both to teleport.\n\nSuppose Megan goes to (a,b) which is a point that allows both to save steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is the minimum of ( (distance_S) + distance_M ), where distance_M is the path Megan chooses. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be found by the formula (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) - (the minimal between (distance between Megan's start and Stanley's start) or similar).\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I need to find a formula.\n\nLet me think differently. Let me think of the minimal possible total energy.\n\nEach of them can use the portals, so perhaps the minimal total is (distance_S + distance_M) where distance_S is the minimal steps for Stanley when he can teleport through Megan's path.\n\nThe path that gives the minimal total must be when Megan's path is such that she can place portals that both can use.\n\nThe key is that the best point is where they can teleport to minimize their steps.\n\nLet me think of the optimal scenario where both can teleport at a certain point, say (a,b), then the total energy can be calculated as follows:\n\nStanley's path: from (1,1) to (a,b) via moving or teleporting, then teleport to another point, etc., until reaching (n,m). But perhaps the optimal is to teleport to the best possible point.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible total is the Manhattan distance of each, but reduced by the best possible teleport steps.\n\nSuppose that both can teleport once. The best teleport point for Stanley would be the point farthest along Megan's path, so that he can teleport to near his destination. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal total energy as the minimum between the following options:\n\nOption A: Both move normally, no portals: total is 2*(n+m-2).\n\nOption B: They use a portal at Megan's starting point (n,1). \n\nWait, Megan starts there. Stanley could teleport from his start (1,1) to Megan's start (n,1), costing 1. Then he can move down (since he needs to get to (n,m). So Stanley's path would be: teleport to (n,1) (cost 1), then move right (m-1) steps. Total steps: 1 + (m-1) = m.\n\nMegan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). Her path length is (n-1) + (m-1). So total would be m + (n+m-2). = m + n + m -2 = n + 2m - 2. \n\nCompare with original 2*(n+m-2). \n\nFor example, in the first test case (n=7, m=5):\n\nOriginal: 2*(7+5-2) = 2*10=20.\n\nOption B gives 7+10-2 = 15? Wait wait:\n\nWait Megan's path length is (n-1)+(m-1) = 6+4=10. \n\nTotal for option B would be (m) + 10 \u2192 5+10=15. Which matches the example's answer. \n\nAh! So this is promising. \n\nSo in this scenario, Megan takes the straight path from her start to her destination (moving up and then right), and Stanley teleports to her starting point, then proceeds to his destination. \n\nSo the total would be:\n\nStanley's path: 1 (teleport to (n,1)) + (m-1) steps right \u2192 total: m steps.\n\nMegan's path: (n-1)+(m-1) steps \u2192 (n+m-2) steps.\n\nTotal is m + (n+m-2) = n + 2m -2. \n\nBut in another scenario, maybe Megan can choose a different path which allows even better savings. \n\nWait let's see another case. Suppose n=3, m=3:\n\nOption B gives total 3 + (3+3-2) =3 +4 =7, which matches the earlier example where the minimal was achieved with that total. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example, n=2, m=2:\n\nOption B gives 2 + (2+2-2) = 2+2=4. Which matches the earlier case where no saving was possible. So it works.\n\nHmm, so maybe the formula is n + 2m -2 vs m + 2n -2?\n\nWait wait, no. Wait the option B described here is when Megan's path is the standard path (moving up then right), and then Stanley teleports to Megan's starting point (n,1), then proceeds to his destination. \n\nBut maybe there's a better option where Megan takes a different path.\n\nWait, perhaps Megan can choose to go to her destination via another route so that both can save more steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is the minimum between n +2m -2 and m +2n - 2. \n\nWait in the first example, n=7 and m=5, the first option (n+2m-2) is 7 + 10-2 =15, which matches. \n\nIf we had n=5 and m=7, then the first option would be 5 + 14-2=17, while the second option (m +2n-2) would be7 +10-2=15, so better. \n\nSo perhaps the minimal total is the minimum between (n + 2*m - 2) and (m + 2*n - 2), whichever is smaller. \n\nWait but n and m are interchangeable in this formula. Let me see:\n\nThe minimal between (n+2m-2) and (m+2n-2) is the same as the minimal between (n+2m) and (2n +m), minus 2. \n\nWhich can be written as min(n+2m, 2n+m) - 2. \n\nWait yes. So the minimal between those two terms. So which one is smaller?\n\nIt depends on whether n is smaller or larger than m. \n\nFor example, when n=7 and m=5: 7+10=17 vs 14+5=19 \u2192 the first is better. So min is 17, subtract 2 gives 15 (as before). \n\nWhen n=5 and m=7: 5+14=19 vs 10+7=17 \u2192 the second is better, so 17-2=15. \n\nSo yes, the minimal between the two gives the correct result.\n\nSo the formula is min(n + 2*m, 2*n + m) - 2. \n\nLet me test another case: n=3, m=3 \u2192 min(3+6, 6+3)=9. 9-2=7, which matches.\n\n n=2, m=2 \u2192 min(2+4, 4+2)=6 \u2192 6-2=4. \n\nAnother example: n=1, m=1 \u2192 min(1+2*1, 2*1 +1)=3 \u2192 3-2=1. But the correct answer should be 0. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait when n=1 and m=1, the starting positions for both are their destinations. So the total should be 0. \n\nAh, so there's an edge case here. The formula gives 1, but correct is 0. \n\nHmm, need to see why. \n\nLooking at the formula for n=1 and m=1:\n\nmin(1+2*1, 2*1 +1) = min(3,3) \u2192 3, minus 2 gives 1. But actual answer is 0. \n\nSo the formula isn't perfect. Let's see what the problem says for this case. \n\nIn the problem statement, when n=1 and m=1:\n\nStanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (1,1), so 0.\n\nMegan starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (1,1), so 0. Total is 0. \n\nSo the formula needs to account for when n and m are 1. \n\nLet me see what's wrong with the formula. \n\nThe formula is derived from the case where both can teleport to Megan's starting point or Megan's path allows for that. But when n=1 and m=1, Megan's path is trivial (start is end), so she doesn't move, so the portals are just at (1,1). \n\nThus, both are already at their destinations, so the total is 0. \n\nHmm, so maybe the formula's edge case is when either n or m is 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is another condition: when either n or m is 1, then the minimal total is (something else).\n\nWait let me think of when m=1. \n\nIf m=1, then the grid is n rows and 1 column. \n\nStanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (n, 1). So his path is (n-1) steps down.\n\nMegan starts at (n,1) and needs to go to (1,1). So her path is (n-1) steps up. \n\nTotal without portals would be 2*(n-1). \n\nWith portals: Megan's path is the vertical line. So the portals are along that. \n\nStanley can teleport from his start to Megan's start (cost 1), then he is already at (n,1), so total is 1. \n\nMegan's path is (n-1). \n\nTotal is 1 + (n-1) = n. \n\nThe formula would give min(n+2*1, 2*n +1) -2. \n\nLet me see for n=2, m=1:\n\nFormula: min(2+2=4, 4+1=5) \u2192 4-2=2. \n\nBut according to the scenario above, the total is 2 (1 +1). So correct. \n\nWait for n=3, m=1: \n\nThe formula says min(3+2=5 vs 6+1=7 \u2192 5-2=3). \n\nActual total would be 1 (teleport) + 2 (Megan's path steps) \u2192 3. So correct. \n\nWhat about n=1, m=1: formula gives 1, but actual is 0.\n\nSo the formula holds except when n and m are both 1. \n\nSo the formula could be written as:\n\nif n ==1 and m ==1: 0 \n\nelse: min(n+2*m, 2*n +m) - 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's also the case when n=1 or m=1, but let's see:\n\nTake n=1 and m=2. \n\nThen, the formula would give min(1 +4=5, 2 + 2=4 \u2192 min is 4 \u2192 4-2=2. Let's see:\n\nStanley needs to go from (1,1) to (1,2). So he can go directly (1 step), or teleport. \n\nMegan's path is from (1,1) to (1,2) (since n=1, Megan starts at (1,1) which is the same as her end? Wait Megan's start is (n,1) which is (1,1), her end is (1, m)= (1,2). \n\nSo Megan's path is one step to the right. \n\nHer path is length 1.\n\nNow, Stanley can take 1 step (without using portal) \u2192 total 1 +1 = 2, which matches the formula. \n\nAlternatively, Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) (cost 1), so his path is 1. Megan's path is 1. Total 2. So yes. \n\nSo the formula holds. \n\nThe only case it fails is when n and m are both 1. \n\nSo in code, we can handle the case when n ==1 and m ==1, output 0, else compute the min of (n+2m, 2n+m) minus 2. \n\nWait another edge case: when n=1 and m=3:\n\nThen, according to formula: min(1+6, 2*1 +3)= min(7,5) \u21925 \u21925-2=3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMegan's path is from (1,1) to (1,3). So two steps right. \n\nHer path length is 2. \n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) \u2192 cost 1. \n\nTotal: 1+2 =3, which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the formula seems to work except when both are 1. \n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nif n ==1 and m ==1 \u2192 output 0\n\nelse \u2192 output min(n+2*m, 2*n + m) -2\n\nLet me confirm with the first example:\n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 min(7+10=17, 14+5=19 \u219217 \u219217-2=15. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=3,3 \u2192 min(3+6=9 vs 6+3=9 \u21929-2=7 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother case where n=5 and m=7: the formula gives min(5+14=19 vs 10+7=17 \u219217-2=15. \n\nSo now, the code can be written as follows:\n\nIn the code, for each test case, read n and m. \n\nif n ==1 and m ==1 \u2192 print 0\n\nelse:\n\ncompute the two terms (n + 2*m) and (2*n +m), take the minimum between them, subtract 2, and print that.\n\nSo now, implementing this in code. \n\nThe code given is Java. The current code has the main loop, and inside the loop, we need to compute this. \n\nSo inside the loop:\n\nint n = sc.nextInt();\n\nint m = sc.nextInt();\n\nif (n ==1 && m ==1) System.out.println(0);\n\nelse {\n\n    int a = n + 2*m;\n\n    int b = 2*n + m;\n\n    int res = Math.min(a, b) -2;\n\n    System.out.println(res);\n\n}\n\nWait but wait, what about when n=1 and m>1?\n\nLike n=1, m=2: the code would compute min(1+4=5, 2 +2=4 \u21924-2=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nSimilarly, m=1 and n>1: works. \n\nSo yes, this should handle all cases except the n=1 and m=1.\n\nThus, the missing code is the part inside the while loop.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nimport java.util.*;\npublic class Main\n{\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tScanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);\n\t\tint t=sc.nextInt();\n\t\twhile(t-->0)\n\t\t{\n\t\t    int n = sc.nextInt();\n\t\t    int m = sc.nextInt();\n\t\t    if(n == 1 && m ==1){\n\t\t        System.out.println(0);\n\t\t        continue;\n\t\t    }\n\t\t    int a = n + 2*m;\n\t\t    int b = 2*n + m;\n\t\t    int ans = Math.min(a, b) - 2;\n\t\t    System.out.println(ans);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nWait, let me check the n=1 and m=1 case again. \n\nYes, in that case, the code outputs 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother case n=2, m=2 \u2192 outputs min(2+4=6, 4+2=6 \u21926-2=4 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother test case where n=1 and m=1, outputs 0. \n\nThus this should be correct."
