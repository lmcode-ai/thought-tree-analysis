Hmm, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the rating inside the while loop. 2. Check the value of the rating against the divisions. 3. Output the correct division string. Let me think about the order of checks. Since the divisions are in ranges that don't overlap, I can check from the highest division down. Like first check if rating >=1900, then else if 1600 <= rating <=1899, etc. That way, once a condition is met, it can break out of the checks. So, variables needed: inside the loop, declare an integer for the rating. Let's say 'rating'. Then, after reading it, set a variable for the division. Maybe use if-else statements. Wait, code structure inside the loop:\n\ncin >> rating;\n\nThen:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n} else if (rating >=1600) { // because if it's 1600-1899, then division 2\n    cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n} else if (rating >=1400) { // 1400-1599 is division3\n    cout << \"Division3\" << endl;\n} else { // everything else (<=1399) is division4\n    cout << \"Division4\" << endl;\n} Wait, let me check the conditions again. Let's see:\n\nDivision 2 is 1600 to 1899. So after checking division1 (>=1900), the next condition is if the rating is between 1600 and 1899. But since the first condition failed, we know it's less than 1900, so the else if can just check if it's >=1600. Because 1600 <= x <=1899 is the same as x >=1600 and x <1900, which is already covered by the first condition's negation. Similarly for division3: after division2's condition (so x is less than 1600), check if it's >=1400. Then division3. Else, division4. Yes, that should work. Wait, let me test with some examples from the notes:\n\nTest case with 1399: it would go to else after division3's check (since 1399 <1400), so division4.\n\n1400: the else if (>=1400) is true, so division3.\n\n1679: after division1 (no), then check >=1600 \u2192 yes, so division2.\n\n2300 \u2192 division1. -789 \u2192 goes to else, division4. Yes, that seems correct. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\nint rating;\ncin >> rating;\n\nThen the if-else chain as above.",
