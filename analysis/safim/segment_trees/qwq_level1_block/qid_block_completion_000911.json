The problem is about determining if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells. Each stamp can be either RB or BR, and each application changes both cells to those colors. The key is to check if the given string can be achieved through any number of such stamps. Hmm, the approach here probably involves looking at the constraints of the stamps. Since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, the final string must follow certain patterns. Let me think about the conditions that would make it impossible. First, any occurrence of a single R or B (not paired with the other) might be a problem. Because each stamp introduces either an R and B pair.",

Wait, but the example's final string has a B followed by R followed by B followed by B. The last B is part of a pair with the previous B. So that's okay. Hmm, maybe the problem can be broken down by looking at the runs of non-W characters. Let me think of the code given. The code splits the string into runs of non-W characters, separated by W's. For each such run (stored in vector a), it checks some conditions. In the code, for each run x in a, they loop through each character in x and have some conditions.",

So the missing code in the TODO is to set r and b flags. Let me see:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor (auto &x : a) {\n    bool r = false, b = false;\n    for (auto &v : x) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    } if ((r && !b) || (b && !r)) {\n        cout << \"NO\\n\"; return;\n    }\n} So inside the loop over each character v in the current run x, we need to set r to true if v is 'R', and b to true if v is 'B'. So the code should be:\n\nif (v == 'R') r = true;\nif (v == 'B') b = true;\n\nAlternatively, since the run is made of non-W characters, so each v is either R or B. So for each character in the run, check if it's R or B and set the flags accordingly. Yes, that's the missing code. So the TODO section should have:\n\nif (v == 'R') r = true;\nif (v == 'B') b = true;\n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are named r and b. So for each character in the string x (which is a run of non-W), we check if it's R or B, and set the flags.",

That makes sense. So the code is correct except for that part. Wait, but let me think of some test cases. Test case where the run is \"RB\" \u2192 r and b are both true \u2192 okay. Test case \"RR\" \u2192 r is true, b is false \u2192 condition (r && !b) \u2192 output NO.\n\nTest case \"B\" \u2192 b is true, r is false \u2192 output NO.\n\nTest case \"BRB\" \u2192 both R and B \u2192 okay. Another case: \"BRBB\" \u2192 has R and B \u2192 okay. So this logic should work. Therefore, the missing code is to set the r and b flags based on the current character. So the code inside the loop over v should be:\n\nif (v == 'R') r = true;\nif (v == 'B') b = true;\n\nAlternatively, using a single line with a switch or something, but that's the idea. Therefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is those two lines.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells. Each stamp can be either RB or BR, and each application changes both cells to those colors. The key is to check if the given string can be achieved through any number of such stamps.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves looking at the constraints of the stamps. Since each stamp affects two adjacent cells, the final string must follow certain patterns. Let me think about the conditions that would make it impossible.\n\nFirst, any occurrence of a single R or B (not paired with the other) might be a problem. Because each stamp introduces either an R and B pair. Wait, but since you can stamp over the same cells multiple times, maybe overlapping stamps can change things. But maybe the key is that every non-white character must be part of some pair in a way that they can be built up through these stamps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence of non-white characters must form certain patterns. Let me think of the test cases mentioned. For example, the second, third, and fourth test cases where the answer is NO probably have single R or B. Like if the string is \"R\", then you can't do it because a stamp requires two cells. So any single non-W character would be impossible. So that's one condition: if there's a single R or B, then it's impossible.\n\nAnother case: the fifth test case example given works. Let's see their example: \"BRBW\" (or similar). Wait, the example given in the problem's note has a sequence where the stamps can be applied in steps. So maybe the key is that the non-white regions must form blocks where each block has even length? Or maybe not exactly even, but some other condition.\n\nWait, let's think of each stamp as adding an R and B in some order. But since you can stamp multiple times, overlapping, maybe the final string's non-W parts must form a sequence where every R and B is part of a pair that can be built through these steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-white parts must form a sequence where every run of non-W must have even length? Because each stamp affects two cells. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the final string is BRBBW. Wait, the third and fourth characters are B and B. How did that happen?\n\nLooking at the example steps:\n\nThe steps were:\n\nStart with WWWW W.\n\nFirst stamp at positions 4-5 (assuming 1-based?), making RB there. So the string becomes WW RB W.\n\nThen stamp at positions 1-2, making BR there. So B R R B W.\n\nWait, then the third step stamps at positions 2-3 (the R and R?), but that would turn them into either RB or BR. Wait, maybe I need to retrace the example steps again. The example's final string is B R B B W. Hmm, perhaps the third step was stamping positions 2-3 (the R and R?), but that would require that those two cells can be turned into either RB or BR. But two R's can't be formed by a single stamp. Wait, maybe overlapping stamps can lead to such a situation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that in the final string, every occurrence of a non-W must be part of a pair that can be traced back through the stamps. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that each stamp operation can be thought of as toggling two adjacent cells into R and B in some order. But since each stamp can be applied multiple times, maybe the order and overlapping can lead to certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the sequence of non-W characters must form a pattern where every R and B must alternate in some way, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the constraints. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells. Each time you apply a stamp, you set those two cells to either RB or BR. But since you can apply the stamp multiple times, the colors can be overwritten. However, the initial state is all W, so any cell that ends up as non-W must have been part of at least one stamp.\n\nWait, but the problem allows stamping over the same cells multiple times. So for example, if you stamp a pair as RB, then stamp them again as BR, they would become BR. So the final color depends on the last stamp applied to each cell.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every non-W must be part of a pair of adjacent non-W's? Or maybe not exactly, but there's some condition on the arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W regions must form runs where each run's length is at least 1, but with certain parity conditions. Let me think of possible invalid cases.\n\nTest case 2,3,4 in the note have answers NO because they can't be done with a single cell. So if the string has a single R or B, it's impossible. So that's one condition: any isolated non-W (i.e., a single R or B not adjacent to another non-W?) would be invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe even if they are adjacent but in a way that can't be formed by the stamps. Let's think of the example where the string is \"RB\". That's exactly one stamp, so that's possible. So that's okay. But \"RR\" would be impossible because each stamp can only create one R and one B. So to have two R's, you would need some way to get them. Let's see: suppose you stamp the first two cells as BR (so first is B, second R). Then stamp again on the same two cells as RB (so first R, second B). So after two stamps, they would be R and B again. Hmm, so you can't get two R's. So any occurrence of two R's in a row would be impossible? Or maybe not?\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose the desired string is \"RR\". How could that be formed?\n\nEach stamp on positions 1-2 would set them to either RB or BR. So after one stamp, they are either RB or BR. To get RR, you need both to be R. But each stamp can only set one to R and the other to B. So it's impossible. So any occurrence of two R's in a row is invalid. Similarly for two B's?\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem's first case, the final string has two B's in a row. Let me check that example again. The final string is B R B B W. Wait, the third and fourth characters are B and B. How did that happen?\n\nLooking at the steps:\n\nThe third step was stamping positions 2-3 (the R and R?), but that would turn them into either RB or BR. Wait, maybe I need to retrace the example steps again.\n\nThe example steps:\n\nStart with WWWWW.\n\nFirst stamp at positions 4-5 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), making RB there. So the string becomes WW RB W.\n\nWait, maybe the first stamp is applied at positions 3-4 (if 0-based), so the string becomes \"WW\" followed by RB and then W. So the string is \"WWRBW\".\n\nThen the second stamp is applied at positions 0-1 (the first two W's?), turning them into BR. So the first two become BR, so the string becomes BR R B W. Wait, that would be B R R B W? Then the third step is stamping positions 1-2 (the two R's?), which would turn them into either RB or BR. Let's say they choose RB. Then the string becomes B R B B W. So the third and fourth are B and B. Wait, how did that happen?\n\nWait, after the third step, the two R's (positions 1 and 2) are stamped as RB. So position 1 becomes R, position 2 becomes B. Wait, but that would make the string B (position0), then R (position1), then B (position2), then B (position3?), so the third and fourth would be B and B? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices, but the point is that two B's in a row can be formed. So how is that possible?\n\nAh, because the two B's are not adjacent to each other via a single stamp. Let me see: the third step's stamp on positions 1-2 (the two R's) would turn them into RB or BR. Let's say they choose RB. Then position1 is R, position2 is B. Then the next step (if any) could be another stamp on positions 2-3 (the B and B?), but that would require that they are turned into either RB or BR. Wait, but in the example's final string, the third and fourth are B and B. So how did that happen?\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the example's steps. Let me re-examine the problem's example:\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nInitial: WWWW W (5 cells)\n\nFirst stamp at positions 4-5 (but that would be beyond the 5 cells?), maybe it's 0-based. Let me think again. The example's first step is:\n\nWWWWW \u2192 WW followed by underlined RB and then W. So the first two W's are still W, then the next two are RB, then a W. So the string after first step is \"WWRBW\".\n\nSecond step: stamp at positions 0-1 (the first two W's), turning them into BR. So the first two become B and R. So the string becomes BR R B W. Wait, that would be B R R B W. Then the third step is stamping positions 1-2 (the two R's). Let's say they choose BR (so first of the pair is B, second R). Wait, no, the stamp can be either BR or RB. So if they stamp as BR, then position1 becomes B and position2 becomes R. But that would not help. Alternatively, if they stamp as RB, then position1 becomes R and position2 becomes B. So the string after third step would be B (position0), R (position1), B (position2), B (position3), W (position4). So the third and fourth are B and B. So how did that happen?\n\nAh, because the third and fourth cells (positions 2 and 3) were originally B (from the first stamp) and then the third step's stamp on positions 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) turned position2 into B. So the third cell (position2) is B, and the fourth (position3) was already B from the first stamp. So two B's in a row can be formed. So that's allowed. So two B's in a row is okay.\n\nHmm, so the problem is not that two same colors can't be adjacent. So what's the condition?\n\nLet me think of the possible patterns. Each stamp adds an R and B in some order. But since you can apply stamps multiple times, overlapping, perhaps the key is that the non-W parts must form a sequence where every R and B can be paired in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must be such that every non-W character is part of a pair that can be formed by some stamp, but considering that overlapping stamps can affect the same cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-W regions must form a sequence where every run of non-W must have even length? Let's see:\n\nIn the first example's final string, the non-W parts are B R B B (length 4, even). The fifth test case example (WWW \u2192 becomes RB \u2192 then BRB, which is length 3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the fifth test case's example:\n\nThe fifth test case's desired string is BRBB. The length is 4, which is even. So that works. The example with two B's is okay.\n\nAnother test case: if the desired string is \"BRB\", that's length 3, which is odd. Would that be possible?\n\nLet's see: can we form BRB?\n\nStart with WWW.\n\nStamp at positions 0-1: set to BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nThen stamp at positions 1-2: set to RB \u2192 B R becomes R B, then the third becomes B. So the result is R B B. Not BRB.\n\nAlternatively, first stamp at 0-1 (BR), then stamp at 0-1 again as RB \u2192 R B W. Then stamp at 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B B. Hmm, not getting BRB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's impossible. So a run of length 3 would be invalid. So perhaps the runs of non-W must have even length?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the desired string is \"BRB\". The run length is 3 (odd). So according to that idea, it would be invalid. Let's see if it can be formed.\n\nAnother approach: each stamp affects two cells. So the total number of non-W cells must be even? Because each stamp adds two non-W (but since they can be overwritten, maybe not). Wait, no, because you can stamp over existing non-W cells, so the total count can be anything. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every occurrence of a non-W must be part of a pair that can be traced back through the stamps. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W regions must form a sequence where every R and B alternates in some way. For example, you can't have two R's in a row unless they are part of overlapping stamps.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the possible transitions. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, but the final colors depend on the last stamp applied to each cell.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every pair of adjacent non-W must be either RB or BR, or WB, BW, etc. But that's not necessarily the case. For example, the example's final string has B followed by R, then B followed by B. The B and B are adjacent, which is allowed.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that each non-W character must be part of a pair that can be formed by some stamp. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must be such that every non-W character is part of a pair of adjacent non-W's, except possibly the first and last. Wait, but that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the process in reverse. Suppose we start from the desired string and try to remove stamps. Each stamp can be \"undone\" by applying it again. So the process is reversible. The initial state is all W. So the desired string must be reachable through a series of stamp applications. To check this, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nThe stamp operations can be applied in any order, but each operation toggles two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. Since the order doesn't matter (because applying a stamp twice cancels its effect on those cells), perhaps the key is that the final string must satisfy certain parity conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by looking at the sequence of non-W characters and ensuring that they can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B in some way.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: the non-W regions must form a sequence where every R and B must alternate in some way. Let me think of the example where the string is \"BRBB\". The sequence is B, R, B, B. The last two B's can be formed by overlapping stamps. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every occurrence of a non-W must be part of a pair of adjacent non-W's, except possibly the first and last. Wait, but the example's final string has a B followed by R followed by B followed by B. The last B is part of a pair with the previous B. So that's okay.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem can be broken down by looking at the runs of non-W characters. Let me think of the code given. The code splits the string into runs of non-W characters, separated by W's. For each such run (stored in vector a), it checks some conditions.\n\nIn the code, for each run x in a, they loop through each character in x and have some conditions. The current code has a loop over each character in x, and then checks if (r and not b) or (b and not r), which would output NO.\n\nSo the idea is that for each run of non-W characters, certain conditions must hold. The variables r and b are probably tracking whether there are R's and B's in the run.\n\nWait, the code's current approach is to split the string into groups of non-W separated by W. Then for each group (string x), they check if the group contains both R and B. Because if a group has only R's or only B's, then it's impossible. Because each stamp must have one R and one B. So a run of all R's or all B's can't be formed.\n\nAh! That's probably the key. Because each stamp adds an R and a B. So any run of non-W must contain at least one R and at least one B. Otherwise, if a run is all R's or all B's, it's impossible.\n\nSo for example, a run like \"RR\" would have only R's, so it's invalid. Similarly, \"BBB\" is invalid. But \"BRB\" has both R and B, so it's okay.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem's first case, the run is B R B B. That has both R and B, so it's okay. The two B's at the end are allowed as long as there's at least one R in the run.\n\nSo the code's current approach is to check for each run whether it has both R and B. The code's variables r and b are probably flags indicating whether the run has at least one R and B. So in the loop over each character in x, they set r to true if any R is found, and similarly for b. Then, if the run has only R's (r is true and b is false) or only B's (b is true and r is false), then it's invalid.\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is to set r and b flags. Let me see:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor (auto &x : a) {\n    bool r = false, b = false;\n    for (auto &v : x) {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n    if ((r && !b) || (b && !r)) {\n        cout << \"NO\\n\"; return;\n    }\n}\n\nSo inside the loop over each character v in the current run x, we need to set r to true if v is 'R', and b to true if v is 'B'.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif (v == 'R') r = true;\nif (v == 'B') b = true;\n\nAlternatively, since the run is made of non-W characters, so each v is either R or B. So for each character in the run, check if it's R or B and set the flags accordingly.\n\nYes, that's the missing code. So the TODO section should have:\n\nif (v == 'R') r = true;\nif (v == 'B') b = true;\n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are named r and b. So for each character in the string x (which is a run of non-W), we check if it's R or B, and set the flags. Then, after processing all characters, if the run has only R's or only B's, then output NO.\n\nThat makes sense. So the code is correct except for that part.\n\nWait, but let me think of some test cases.\n\nTest case where the run is \"RB\" \u2192 r and b are both true \u2192 okay.\n\nTest case \"RR\" \u2192 r is true, b is false \u2192 condition (r && !b) \u2192 output NO.\n\nTest case \"B\" \u2192 b is true, r is false \u2192 output NO.\n\nTest case \"BRB\" \u2192 both R and B \u2192 okay.\n\nAnother case: \"BRBB\" \u2192 has R and B \u2192 okay.\n\nSo this logic should work.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is to set the r and b flags based on the current character.\n\nSo the code inside the loop over v should be:\n\nif (v == 'R') r = true;\nif (v == 'B') b = true;\n\nAlternatively, using a single line with a switch or something, but that's the idea.\n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is those two lines."
