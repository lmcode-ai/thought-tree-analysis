        "text": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code for the given problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully. The problem is about determining whether a given array can be obtained through a series of specific operations. The operations involve moving a pointer and incrementing/decrementing elements. The key points are:\n\n- The pointer starts at the first element. - You can do two types of operations any number of times:\n   1. If not on the last element, increase current element by 1, then move to next. 2. If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous.\n- After all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element. Hmm, the goal is to check if the given array a can be formed under these constraints. Let me think about the approach. The initial code provided seems to be trying some kind of cumulative sum approach, but it's incomplete. Let me see what the code is doing so far. Looking at the code:\n\nThe code reads t test cases. For each test case, it reads n and then the array elements. It uses variables stt, sum, etc. The loop is from i=1 to n, but the indices might be 1-based here. Wait, the loop is written as loop(i,1,n+1), which with the loop macro defined as for(int q = st; q < ed ; q++), so i starts at 1 and goes up to n (since ed is n+1, so i < n+1). So the elements are being read one by one, perhaps in a 1-based array. The code is accumulating sum += in (the current element). Then, if sum <0, it sets stt=1 (which probably means \"flag to say no\"). If sum is 0, then it loops from j=i+1 to n+1, reading the remaining elements. If any of those are non-zero, then... the code has a comment \"TODO\" here. Then breaks. Wait, the logic here is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The code's current approach seems to be checking the cumulative sum. Let me see:\n\nThe sum variable is the sum of the elements up to the current index.",

The total displacement must be zero (since it starts and ends at the first element). Let me think of the pointer's movement as a path. Each step is either +1 (moving right) or -1 (moving left). The total displacement must be zero. But each step also affects the array elements. Wait, each time you move right (operation 1), you increment the current element before moving. Each time you move left (operation 2), you decrement the current element before moving. Hmm, perhaps the key is to model the required changes in the array and the path of the pointer. Let me think of the array as being built through the operations. Let's consider that each time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell, then move. Each time you move left, subtract 1 from current cell, then move. The pointer starts at position 1 (assuming 1-based), and must end at position 1.",

Wait, the code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me parse it step by step. The code's loop is over each element (i from 1 to n). For each element, it reads 'in' (the current a[i]). sum += in. Then, if sum <0: set stt=1 (flag to output no). Else if sum ==0: \n\n   then, it loops from j=i+1 to n, reading the remaining elements.

Wait, the code's loop is over i from 1 to n. But when sum reaches zero, it enters the else if clause, then loops from j=i+1 to n+1 (so j starts at i+1, up to n). Wait, the inner loop is loop(j,i+1, n+1). Inside that loop, for each j, it reads 'in' (but the elements have already been read in the outer loop? Because the outer loop is reading each element in order. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the code's outer loop is reading the elements one by one. Wait, the code's outer loop is:\n\nloop(i,1,n+1) { \n\n   cin >> in; \n\n   ... \n\n} So for each i from 1 to n, it reads the next input. But then, when in the else if (sum ==0) clause, it does a loop from j=i+1 to n+1, and inside that loop, it does cin >> in again. This would read the same elements again, which is wrong.

So this is a bug. Therefore, the code's current approach is flawed. Hmm, so I need to fix this. The correct approach must be different. Let me think again. The problem requires that the pointer ends at the first position. Let me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's constraints: The array must satisfy two conditions: \n\n1. The sum of all elements must be zero. 2. The cumulative sum from the left must never be negative. 3. The cumulative sum from the right must never be positive. Wait, perhaps the second and third conditions are necessary. Let me think of the cumulative sum from the left. Suppose we process the array from left to right, and track the cumulative sum. Each step, the cumulative sum must be non-negative. Because, the pointer can't move left from the first position until it has moved right first. Wait, maybe the cumulative sum represents the number of times the pointer has moved right minus left up to that point. Alternatively, the cumulative sum up to position i must be non-negative. Similarly, when processing from the right, the cumulative sum must be non-positive. Wait, let me think of the following: \n\nLet me define the cumulative sum S[i] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[i]. The first condition is that S[n] =0. The second condition is that for all i from 1 to n, S[i] >=0. The third condition is that for all i from 1 to n, the cumulative sum from the end must be <=0. Wait, perhaps the third condition is that the reverse cumulative sum (starting from the end) must be <=0. Alternatively, let me think of the reverse cumulative sum. Let me define T[i] = a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[n]. Then, T[i] must be <=0 for all i from 1 to n. \n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. Let me see with the sample test case 2: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The cumulative sum S[i] is: \n\nS[1] =2, S[2]=1, S[3]=0, S[4]=0. All are non-negative. The reverse cumulative sum T[i] for each position: T[1] =2 + (-1) + (-1) +0 =0 \n\nT[2] =-1 + (-1)+0 =-2 \n\nT[3] =-1 +0 =-1 \n\nT[4] =0 \n\nAll are <=0. So that works. Another example: the array [1, -1]. S[1]=1, S[2]=0. T[1] =0, T[2]=-1. All conditions met. Another example: [1, -2]. S[1]=1, S[2]=-1 (which violates the first condition, so it's rejected). Another example: [3, -1, -2]. Sum is 0. S[1]=3, S[2]=2, S[3]=0. T[1] =0, T[2]=-2-1 (wait, let me compute T[i] as the sum from i to end. Wait, T[1] =3 + (-1) + (-2) =0 \n\nT[2] =-1 + (-2) =-3 \n\nT[3] =-2 \n\nAll are <=0. So this array would be accepted. But can it be formed? Let me see: \n\nWe need to get a[1]=3, a[2]=-1, a[3]=-2. Hmm, let's see. The pointer starts at 1. To get a[1] =3, you must have moved right 3 times from position 1, but each time you move right, you add 1 to a[1]. Wait, but moving right from 1 would take you to 2, then you can move left back. Wait, perhaps the path is: \n\nMove right 3 times from 1 (each time adding 1 to a[1], then moving to 2. Wait, but moving right from 1 three times would take you to position 4 (if n=3?), but in this case n=3. Wait, let's see for n=3. Wait, the array is [3, -1, -2]. Hmm, let's try to construct it. Start at 1. Move right (a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. Move right again (a[2] becomes 1, move to 3. Move right again (a[3] becomes 1, move to 4 (but n=3, so can't do that. So this approach won't work. Hmm, maybe I need a different path. Alternatively, perhaps the path is: \n\nMove right from 1 to 2 (a[1] +=1 \u2192 1). Then move left back to 1 (a[2] -=1 \u2192 0). Then move right again to 2 (a[1] +=1 \u2192 2, then move to 2. Then move right to 3 (a[2] +=1 \u2192 1, move to 3. Then move left to 2 (a[3] -=1 \u2192 -1, move to 2. Then move left to 1 (a[2] -=1 \u2192 0, move to 1. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the conditions are necessary but not sufficient. Wait, maybe the conditions are sufficient. Let me think of the conditions again: \n\nThe array must satisfy: \n\n1. Sum of all elements is zero. 2. The cumulative sum from the left (S[i]) is non-negative for all i. \n\n3. The cumulative sum from the right (T[i]) is non-positive for all i. If these conditions are met, then it's possible. So the algorithm would be:",

This should work. Now, let's see the sample test case 2: The array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. Prefix sums: 2, 1, 0, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. Suffix sums: \n\nStarting from the end: \n\n0 \u2192 T[4] =0 \u2192 okay. -1 +0 =-1 \u2192 T[3] =-1 \u2192 okay. -1 + (-1 ) +0 =-2 \u2192 T[2] =-2 \u2192 okay. 2 + (-1) + (-1) +0 =0 \u2192 T[1] =0 \u2192 okay. All suffix sums are <=0. Thus, yes. Another test case: [1, -1]. Prefix sums: 1, 0 \u2192 okay. Suffix sums: \n\n-1 \u2192 T[2] =-1 \u2192 okay. \n\n1 + (-1) =0 \u2192 T[1] =0 \u2192 okay. Thus, yes.

Hmm, let's see. The array is [3, -1, -2]. We need to get a[1] =3, a[2]=-1, a[3]=-2. Let me try to find a path. Start at 1. We need to have a[1] =3. Each time we move right from 1, we add 1 to a[1]. Each time we move left from 1, we subtract 1 (but can't move left from 1). So to get a[1] =3, we must have moved right from 1 exactly 3 times, and never moved left from 1. But moving right from 1 takes us to 2. So the path must involve moving right 3 times from 1, but each time you move right, you have to move to the next position. Wait, but moving right from 1 three times would take you to position 4 (if n=3, that's beyond the array). Wait, n is 3 here. So moving right from 1 three times is impossible. Hmm, so this suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. Wait, this is a problem. Hmm, so my previous approach might be incorrect. Wait, in this case, the array",

Initially, pos =1. The path is a sequence of moves. Each move is either R or L. The final pos must be 1. The array a[i] is the number of times the pointer was at i and moved R minus the number of times it moved L from i. The problem is to determine if such a sequence exists. This seems difficult to model directly. Perhaps the correct conditions are the following: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and also the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nAlternatively, the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, let me think of the example where the array is [3, -1, -2]. The cumulative sum from the left up to i=1 is 3. The cumulative sum from the right starting at i=1 is 0 (3-1-2=0). 3 >=0 \u2192 okay. At i=2: cumulative left sum is 2. Cumulative right sum from i=2 is -3 ( -1-2 =-3). 2 >=-3 \u2192 okay. At i=3: cumulative left sum is 0. Cumulative right sum from i=3 is -2 \u2192 0 >=-2 \u2192 okay. So this condition is met, but the array is impossible. Hmm, so this doesn't help. Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem differently. The pointer starts at 1 and must end at 1. Each time you move right from position i, you add 1 to a[i]. Each time you move left from position i, you subtract 1 from a[i]. The total number of right moves from i is R[i], left moves L[i]. Thus, a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. The total displacement is zero: sum over all (R[i] - L[i]) =0. The path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 1. The path can be represented as a sequence of moves. The key is to find R and L arrays such that the above conditions are met and the path is valid. The path must never go out of bounds. The path's position after each move must be between 1 and n. The path's position after each move can be tracked as follows: \n\nLet me denote the path as a sequence of positions: pos_0, pos_1, ..., pos_k, where pos_0 =1 and pos_k =1. Each move from pos_j to pos_{j+1} is either +1 or -1. The net displacement is zero. The array a[i] is the number of times the move from i was to the right minus the number of times it was to the left. Hmm, perhaps the following approach can work: The array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and also the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [3, -1, -2]. The cumulative sum from the left up to i=1 is 3. The cumulative sum from the right starting at i=1 is 0. \n\n3 >=0 \u2192 okay. At i=2: cumulative left sum is 2. Cumulative right sum from i=2 is -3 \u2192 2 >=-3 \u2192 okay. At i=3: cumulative left sum is 0. Cumulative right sum from i=3 is -2 \u2192 0 >=-2 \u2192 okay. But the array is impossible. Hmm, so this condition is not sufficient. Hmm, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. But in the example, this holds but the array is impossible. Hmm, so perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the example I thought of is actually possible? Wait, let me try to find a path for the array [3, -1, -2]. The array is [3, -1, -2]. We need to have a[1] =3, a[2]=-1, a[3]=-2. Let me try to construct the path. Start at 1. We need to have R[1] - L[1] =3.",

So R[1] must be at least 3. Each time you move right from 1, you add 1 to a[1]. So to get a[1] =3, you must have moved right from 1 three times. But each time you move right from 1, you move to 2. So after the first right move from 1: \n\na[1] =1, position 2. Second right move from 2: \n\na[2] =1, position 3. Third right move from 3: can't move right (n=3). So this is impossible. Thus, the array is impossible. So the conditions are not sufficient. Hmm, so what's the missing condition? Perhaps the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1. Wait, let me think of the example: For the array [3, -1, -2], the cumulative sum from the left up to i=1 is 3. The cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1 (i=1 \u2192 i+1=2) is -3 (a[2]+a[3] =-3). 3 >=-3 \u2192 okay. At i=2: cumulative left sum is 2. Cumulative right from i+1=3 is -2 \u2192 2 >=-2 \u2192 okay. At i=3: cumulative left sum is 0. Cumulative right from i+1=4 (which is beyond the array, so 0). \n\n0 >=0 \u2192 okay. Hmm, this condition also holds. Hmm, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 1 and must end at 1.",

Each time you move right, you increase the current cell and move right. Each time you move left, you decrease the current cell and move left. The final position is 1. The array a is the result of all these operations. The net number of right moves from position i minus left moves from i is a[i]. The path must form a closed walk.

Because each right move increases the position by 1, and each left move decreases by 1. The net displacement after processing up to position i is the cumulative sum of a[1] to a[i]. Wait, because a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. The net displacement from position 1 is the sum of a[1] to a[i]. Thus, the current position after processing up to position i is 1 + sum_{k=1 to i} a[k]. This must be between 1 and n. Thus, the following conditions must hold: For all i from 1 to n: \n\n1 <= 1 + S[i] <= n \n\nwhere S[i] is the cumulative sum up to i. \n\nAdditionally, the total sum must be zero. This is a crucial insight! Ah! This is the missing condition. The current position after processing up to position i must be between 1 and n. \n\nThus, the cumulative sum S[i] must satisfy: \n\nS[i] >=0 (because 1 + S[i] >=1 \u2192 S[i] >=0) \n\nand \n\nS[i] <= n-1 (because 1 + S[i] <=n \u2192 S[i] <=n-1). Wait, but the cumulative sum S[i] is the sum of a[1] to a[i]. Thus, the conditions are: For all i from 1 to n: \n\nS[i] >=0 \n\nand \n\nS[i] <= (n-1) Additionally, the total sum must be zero. Wait, but also, the final position must be 1, so the total sum must be zero. This is a crucial condition I missed earlier. So the correct conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum of the array is zero. 2. For all i from 1 to n: \n\n   a. The cumulative sum S[i] = a[1] + ... + a[i] must be >=0 \n\n   b. S[i] <= (n-1) Wait, but why the upper bound? Because the current position after processing up to i is 1 + S[i], which must be <=n. \n\nThus, S[i] <=n-1. This is the missing condition. Let me test this with the previous example: \n\nExample 1: [3, -1, -2]. Sum is 0. Cumulative sums: \n\nS[1] =3 \u2192 which must be <=n-1 =2 (since n=3). \n\n3>2 \u2192 this violates the condition. Thus, this array is rejected. Ah! This is the missing condition. So the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array must be zero. For all i from 1 to n: \n\nS[i] >=0 \n\nS[i] <=n-1 \n\nThus, the algorithm should be: For each test case: \n\n- Compute the sum of the array. If not zero \u2192 no. \n\n- Compute the cumulative sums S[i]. \n\n- Check that all S[i] are between 0 and n-1 inclusive. If all conditions are met \u2192 yes, else no. This would correctly reject the previous example. Let me test this with other examples. Sample test case 2: [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nn=4. Cumulative sums: \n\nS[1]=2 \u2192 0<=2<=3 \u2192 yes. S[2]=1 \u2192 yes. S[3]=0 \u2192 yes. S[4]=0 \u2192 yes. Thus, accepted. Another example: [1, -1]. \n\nn=2. S[1]=1 <=1 \u2192 yes. S[2]=0 \u2192 yes. Accepted. Another example: [1, -2]. Sum is -1 \u2192 rejected. Another example: [3, -1, -2]. Sum is 0. S[1]=3 > 2 (n-1=2) \u2192 rejected. Thus, this condition works. Another test case: [2, -2]. Sum is 0. \n\nS[1]=2 \u2192 n=2 \u2192 n-1=1 \u2192 2>1 \u2192 rejected. Thus, the array [2, -2] is rejected. But can this array be formed? Let me see: \n\nThe array is [2, -2]. The pointer starts at 1. To get a[1]=2, you must have moved right twice from 1. First move right: a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. Second move right: a[2] becomes 1, move to 3 (but n=2 \u2192 can't). Thus, impossible. Thus, the condition correctly rejects it. Another example: [1, 0, -1]. Sum is 0. Cumulative sums: \n\nS[1]=1 <=2 \u2192 yes. S[2]=1 \u2192 yes. S[3]=0 \u2192 yes. Thus, accepted. Can this array be formed? Yes. Path: \n\nStart at 1. Move right to 2 (a[1] becomes 1). Move right to 3 (a[2] becomes 1). Move left to 2 (a[3] becomes -1). Move left to 1 (a[2] becomes 0). Final array: [1,0,-1]. Yes. Thus, the conditions are correct. Thus, the correct approach is to check the sum is zero, and all cumulative sums are between 0 and n-1. Now, the code needs to implement this. The code currently has a loop that reads the elements and computes the sum, but it's not checking the upper bound.",

The correct code would be: \n\nRead the array into an array. Compute the total sum. If sum ! =0 \u2192 output no. Else compute the cumulative sum, and check for each step. Thus, the code should be rewritten. Now, the original code's loop is incorrect. The correct code would be: \n\nInside the test case loop: Read n. \n\nRead the array. Compute the total sum. If sum ! =0 \u2192 output no. Else compute the cumulative sum and check. Thus, the code should be: \n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h> \n\nusing namespace std; \n\nint main() { \n\n    int t; \n\n    cin >> t; \n\n    while (t--) { \n\n        int n; \n\n        cin >> n; \n\n        vector<long long> a(n); \n\n        long long total =0; \n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { \n\n            cin >> a[i]; \n\n            total += a[i]; \n\n        } if (total ! =0) { \n\n            cout << \"NO\" << endl; \n\n            continue; \n\n        } \n\n        long long current =0; \n\n        bool valid = true; \n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { \n\n            current += a[i]; \n\n            if (current <0 || current > (n-1)) { \n\n                valid = false; \n\n                break; \n\n            } \n\n        } \n\n        if (valid) \n\n            cout << \"YES\" << endl; \n\n        else \n\n            cout << \"NO\" << endl; \n\n    } \n\n    return 0; \n\n} This should work. Now, the original code's loop is incorrect. The original code's loop is trying to read the elements in a way that causes re-reading. The correct approach is to read all elements first, then compute the cumulative sum. Thus, the missing code in the original code's TODO section is not the right approach. The original code's logic is incorrect. The correct code should be as above. Thus, the user's code needs to be completely rewritten. But the problem says to complete the given code. The user's code has a loop that reads the elements and accumulates sum. The code's current logic is: \n\nloop(i,1,n+1) { \n\n   cin >> in; \n\n   sum += in; \n\n   if (sum <0) \u2192 set stt=1. \n\n   else if (sum ==0) \u2192 then check remaining elements. \n\n} But this is incorrect. The correct approach is to compute the cumulative sum and check for each step whether it is between 0 and n-1. Thus, the code should be modified to do that. The original code's loop is not suitable. The user's code's current approach is incorrect.",

Thus, the code should be modified to: \n\nInitialize stt=0. sum =0. \n\nloop(i,1,n+1) { \n\n   cin >> in; \n\n   sum += in; \n\n   if (sum <0 || sum > (n-1)) \u2192 stt=1; \n\n} \n\nThen, also check if the total sum is zero. Thus, the code should be: \n\nif (stt==0 && sum ==0 \u2192 yes else no. Thus, the code's current loop can be modified to this.

This would work. Thus, the missing code in the original code's TODO section is not needed. The original code's loop has an else if (sum ==0) block which is incorrect. Thus, the correct approach is to remove that block and instead check the bounds in the loop.

But the problem requires to complete the given code. The user's code has a loop that reads the elements and accumulates sum. The code's current logic is: \n\nAfter reading each element, add to sum. If sum <0 \u2192 set stt=1. Else if sum ==0 \u2192 then check remaining elements. The code then breaks out of the loop. The code's logic is incorrect. The correct approach is to check for all elements whether the cumulative sum is within 0 and n-1. Thus, the code should be modified to do that. The code's current loop is not suitable. The user's code's loop is: \n\nloop(i,1,n+1) { \n\n   cin >> in; \n\n   sum += in; \n\n   if (sum <0) \u2192 set stt=1. \n\n   else if (sum ==0) \u2192 then check remaining elements. \n\n} The code's logic is to break when sum reaches zero and check the remaining elements. But this is not the correct approach. The correct approach is to check for all elements whether the cumulative sum is within the bounds. Thus, the code should be modified to track the cumulative sum and check for each step.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code for the given problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given array can be obtained through a series of specific operations. The operations involve moving a pointer and incrementing/decrementing elements. The key points are:\n\n- The pointer starts at the first element.\n- You can do two types of operations any number of times:\n   1. If not on the last element, increase current element by 1, then move to next.\n   2. If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous.\n- After all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element.\n\nHmm, the goal is to check if the given array a can be formed under these constraints.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The initial code provided seems to be trying some kind of cumulative sum approach, but it's incomplete. Let me see what the code is doing so far.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe code reads t test cases. For each test case, it reads n and then the array elements. It uses variables stt, sum, etc. The loop is from i=1 to n, but the indices might be 1-based here. Wait, the loop is written as loop(i,1,n+1), which with the loop macro defined as for(int q = st; q < ed ; q++), so i starts at 1 and goes up to n (since ed is n+1, so i < n+1). So the elements are being read one by one, perhaps in a 1-based array.\n\nThe code is accumulating sum += in (the current element). Then, if sum <0, it sets stt=1 (which probably means \"flag to say no\"). If sum is 0, then it loops from j=i+1 to n+1, reading the remaining elements. If any of those are non-zero, then... the code has a comment \"TODO\" here. Then breaks.\n\nWait, the logic here is a bit confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe code's current approach seems to be checking the cumulative sum. Let me see:\n\nThe sum variable is the sum of the elements up to the current index. The idea might be that the operations can only affect the array in a way that the cumulative sum from the start must be non-negative? Or something like that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled by considering the path of the pointer. Each operation moves the pointer either right or left. The total displacement must be zero (since it starts and ends at the first element). \n\nLet me think of the pointer's movement as a path. Each step is either +1 (moving right) or -1 (moving left). The total displacement must be zero. But each step also affects the array elements. \n\nWait, each time you move right (operation 1), you increment the current element before moving. Each time you move left (operation 2), you decrement the current element before moving. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required changes in the array and the path of the pointer. \n\nLet me think of the array as being built through the operations. Let's consider that each time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell, then move. Each time you move left, subtract 1 from current cell, then move. \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1 (assuming 1-based), and must end at position 1. \n\nThe total number of right moves must equal the number of left moves, since the net displacement is zero. \n\nBut how does this affect the array?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array's elements can be determined by the number of times the pointer passed through each cell in a certain direction. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the required conditions. Let me think of the array a as the result after all operations. Let me think of the process as a sequence of moves. \n\nEach time you move right from position i to i+1, you add 1 to a[i]. Each time you move left from position i to i-1, you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nThe total number of times you pass through each cell in each direction must result in the final a[i]. \n\nWait, but each time you pass through a cell in a direction, you either add or subtract. \n\nAlternatively, the net change for each cell a[i] is equal to (number of times you moved right into it from the left) minus (number of times you moved left into it from the right). Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when moving right from i to i+1, you first add 1 to a[i], then move. So each right move from i contributes +1 to a[i]. \n\nWhen moving left from i to i-1, you subtract 1 from a[i], then move. So each left move from i contributes -1 to a[i]. \n\nTherefore, the value of a[i] is equal to the number of times you moved right from i minus the number of times you moved left from i. \n\nWait, but the starting point is all zeros, so the final a[i] is exactly the net of right moves from i minus left moves from i. \n\nNow, the path of the pointer must form a walk that starts and ends at position 1. Let me model the path as a sequence of steps. \n\nLet me denote the path as a sequence of positions. The pointer starts at 1, and each step is either +1 (right) or -1 (left), but can't go beyond the array's bounds. \n\nThe total displacement is zero. \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times you move right from i is R[i], and the number of times you move left from i is L[i]. \n\nThen, the a[i] is R[i] - L[i]. \n\nAdditionally, the path must form a valid walk. \n\nThe total steps: the sum over all R[i] and L[i] must form a path that starts and ends at 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required R and L variables such that:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n:\n\na[i] = R[i] - L[i]\n\nAlso, the path must start at 1 and end at 1. \n\nAdditionally, the movement constraints must be satisfied. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the differences between consecutive elements. \n\nWait, let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me think of the net movement. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the required conditions on the array. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nSuppose we model the required path. Let me think of the pointer's position over time. Each step is either R or L. \n\nThe total displacement must be zero. \n\nNow, the a[i] is the number of times the pointer was at position i and moved right, minus the number of times it moved left from i. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a array must satisfy certain conditions. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nEach time you move right from position i, you add 1 to a[i]. \n\nEach time you move left from position i, you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nThe total number of times you move right from i must be R[i], and left from i is L[i], so a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. \n\nThe path must start and end at 1. \n\nNow, the path can be represented as a sequence of moves. Let me think of the path as a walk that starts at 1 and ends at 1. \n\nThe key is to find R and L arrays such that the above conditions are met, and the walk is valid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into some constraints on the array a. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we traverse the array from left to right, keeping track of some variable. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the required conditions. \n\nSuppose we model the path as a series of steps. Let me think of the cumulative \"height\" or something. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let me consider the differences between adjacent elements. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let me think of the required movement. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer can only move right or left, but must end at the first position. \n\nLet me consider the total number of right moves and left moves. Since the net displacement is zero, the total right moves must equal the total left moves. \n\nBut how does that relate to the array? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach: \n\nThe key idea is that the array must satisfy certain conditions. \n\nLet me consider the following: \n\nLet me denote the required path's movement. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. \n\nEach time you move right from position i, you add 1 to a[i]. \n\nEach time you move left from position i, you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nThe total a[i] is R[i] - L[i]. \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 1. \n\nLet me think of the path as a walk that starts at 1 and ends at 1. \n\nThe total number of right steps must equal the left steps. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the sum of all a[i] must be zero? \n\nWait, the sum of a[i] is sum (R[i] - L[i]) for all i. \n\nBut the total R[i] is the total number of right steps (since each right step is from some i). Similarly, total L[i] is the total left steps. \n\nSo sum a[i] = (total R) - (total L). \n\nBut since the total R must equal total L (because the net displacement is zero), then sum a[i] must be zero. \n\nAh, that's a necessary condition. So if the sum of the array is not zero, then it's impossible. \n\nWait, but the problem's sample input might have that. Let me check the note in the problem. \n\nIn the note, the second test case example: the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The sum is 2-1-1+0 =0. So that's okay. \n\nThe first test case's note says that the array can be obtained but the pointer isn't on first element. So perhaps the sum is zero but other conditions are not met. \n\nSo sum being zero is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nSo first, the code must check that the sum of all elements is zero. \n\nLooking at the current code, in the code's loop, it's accumulating sum += in. Then, if sum <0, it sets stt=1 (which would lead to output \"No\"). \n\nWait, but the code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me see:\n\nThe code's loop is over each element, adding to sum. \n\nIf at any point the sum becomes negative, it sets stt=1 (flag to output no). \n\nWait, but why? \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that the cumulative sum up to position i must be non-negative. \n\nWait, maybe the approach is similar to the classic \"balance\" problem, like valid parentheses. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by that: \n\nSuppose we model the movement as a path where moving right is like +1 and moving left is -1. \n\nBut the path must start and end at position 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start up to each position is non-negative, and the total sum is zero. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me think of the required path. \n\nEach time you move right, you are increasing the current element. \n\nEach time you move left, you are decreasing the current element. \n\nThe pointer must end at the first position. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required path's \"height\" or some variable. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet me consider the required path's movement. Let me think of the number of times the pointer has moved right minus left up to each position. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me denote the current position as pos. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1. \n\nEach right move increases pos by 1, each left decreases by 1. \n\nThe total displacement must be zero. \n\nThe array a[i] is equal to the number of times the pointer was at position i and moved right, minus the number of times it moved left from there. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a system of equations. \n\nAlternatively, here's another approach inspired by some similar problems: \n\nLet me think of the required conditions. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nWait, but how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer can only move right or left, but must end at 1. \n\nThe total number of right moves must equal the left moves. \n\nThe array a[i] must be equal to (number of times the pointer was at i and moved right) minus (number of times it moved left from i). \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required path such that the cumulative steps can form the array. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample explanation. \n\nIn the sample, the second test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe process involves moving right, then left, then right again, etc. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nEach time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell and move. \n\nEach time you move left, subtract 1 from current cell and move. \n\nThe final position must be 1. \n\nThe array a is the result of all these operations. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. \n\nSuppose the path is a sequence of moves: R, R, L, R, L, L, etc. \n\nThe final position is 1. \n\nThe a[i] is the net of R and L moves from each position. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required a array such that the following holds: \n\nThe cumulative sum of a[1..i] must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end must also be non-positive? \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach that might work: \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet me process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me track a variable 'balance' which represents the number of steps needed to move right or left. \n\nWait, perhaps the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nTo reach position i, the pointer must have moved right (i-1) times more than left moves. \n\nAlternatively, the balance can be thought of as the current position. \n\nWait, maybe the following approach: \n\nLet me model the required path as a walk where the pointer's position must never go below 1 or above n. \n\nBut how does that relate to the array? \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's note. \n\nThe sample's second test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe process is: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right (so a[1] becomes 1, then move to 2. \n\nThen move left (so a[2] becomes -1, move to 1. \n\nThen move right again (a[1] becomes 2, move to 2. \n\nThen move right again (a[2] becomes 0, move to 3. \n\nThen move left (a[3] becomes -1, move to 2. \n\nThen move left again (a[2] becomes -1, move to 1. \n\nWait, but the final array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nHmm, the a[1] is 2, which is the number of times you moved right from 1 minus left moves from 1. \n\nIn the example, moving right from 1 twice (first step and third step), and moving left from 1 zero times. So 2-0=2. \n\nSimilarly, for position 2: \n\nNumber of right moves from 2: once (third step, moving from 2 to 3). \n\nNumber of left moves from 2: two times (second step and fifth step). \n\nSo 1-2 = -1. \n\nSo that works. \n\nNow, how to model this in code? \n\nPerhaps the key is to track the required path's movement and ensure that the cumulative steps can form the array. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach that might work: \n\nLet me think of the required path as a series of steps. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1. \n\nEach time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell. \n\nEach time you move left, subtract 1 from current cell. \n\nThe final position is 1. \n\nThe array a must be the result of all these operations. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me denote the current position as pos. \n\nThe total steps must form a path that starts and ends at 1. \n\nThe a[i] is the net of R and L moves from i. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nWe can model the required conditions as follows: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the start up to each position is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the end backwards is non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of this: \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me track a variable 'current' which represents the current position. \n\nWait, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's code's current approach. \n\nThe code is accumulating the sum of the array elements. \n\nWait, in the code, the loop is over each element, adding to sum. \n\nIf sum becomes negative, it sets stt=1 (flag to output no). \n\nThen, when sum reaches zero again, it checks the remaining elements. \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that the cumulative sum must never be negative, and when it reaches zero again, all subsequent elements must be zero. \n\nWait, let me think of the sample test case 2: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum after first element is 2 (sum=2). \n\nSecond element: sum becomes 1. \n\nThird: 0. \n\nFourth: 0. \n\nSo the sum never goes negative. \n\nAnother example: suppose the array is [1, -1]. \n\nSum after first element is 1, then 0. \n\nThe cumulative sum never negative. \n\nBut can this array be formed? \n\nLet me see: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right (a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. \n\nThen move left (a[2] becomes -1, move to 1. \n\nSo the array is [1, -1], which is possible. \n\nSo the code's approach would accept this. \n\nAnother test case: array [1, -2]. \n\nSum after first element is 1, then -1. \n\nSo the code would set stt=1, output no. \n\nWhich is correct because the second element is -2. \n\nWait, can that array be formed? \n\nSuppose trying to form [1, -2]. \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right (a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. \n\nThen move left twice: \n\nFirst left: a[2] becomes -1, move to 1. \n\nSecond left: can't move left from 1. \n\nSo can't do that. \n\nHence, the array [1, -2] is impossible, so the code's approach would reject it. \n\nSo the code's logic seems to be checking that the cumulative sum never goes negative, and when it reaches zero again, the rest must be zero. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, when the sum reaches zero again (sum ==0), it loops through the remaining elements and checks if any are non-zero. \n\nWait, in the code's loop, after reading the first i elements (up to when sum becomes zero again?), then it checks the remaining elements. \n\nWait, the code's loop is written as:\n\nloop(i,1,n+1) { ... }\n\nInside, for each element, it adds to sum. \n\nIf sum <0, set stt=1. \n\nElse if sum ==0, then it loops from j=i+1 to n+1, reading the remaining elements. \n\nWait, but in the code, after the first i elements, when sum reaches zero, it reads the remaining elements (from i+1 to n) and checks if any are non-zero. \n\nIf any are non-zero, then the code does something (the TODO part). \n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, when sum reaches zero, it breaks out of the loop. \n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me parse it step by step. \n\nThe code's loop is over each element (i from 1 to n). \n\nFor each element, it reads 'in' (the current a[i]). \n\nsum += in. \n\nThen, if sum <0: set stt=1 (flag to output no). \n\nElse if sum ==0: \n\n   then, it loops from j=i+1 to n, reading the remaining elements. \n\n   For each of those elements, if any is non-zero, then the code has a TODO. \n\n   Then, it breaks out of the loop. \n\nWait, but after that, the code breaks out of the loop. \n\nWait, the code's loop is over i from 1 to n. \n\nBut when sum reaches zero, it enters the else if clause, then loops from j=i+1 to n+1 (so j starts at i+1, up to n). \n\nWait, the inner loop is loop(j,i+1, n+1). \n\nInside that loop, for each j, it reads 'in' (but the elements have already been read in the outer loop? Because the outer loop is reading each element in order. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the code's outer loop is reading the elements one by one. \n\nWait, the code's outer loop is:\n\nloop(i,1,n+1) { \n\n   cin >> in; \n\n   ... \n\n}\n\nSo for each i from 1 to n, it reads the next input. \n\nBut then, when in the else if (sum ==0) clause, it does a loop from j=i+1 to n+1, and inside that loop, it does cin >> in again. \n\nThis would read the same elements again, which is wrong. \n\nAh, this is a mistake in the code. \n\nSo the code is incorrect here. \n\nThe problem is that the inner loop is trying to read the remaining elements again, but they have already been read in the outer loop. \n\nSo this is a bug. \n\nTherefore, the code's current approach is flawed. \n\nHmm, so I need to fix this. \n\nThe correct approach must be different. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that the pointer ends at the first position. \n\nLet me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's constraints: \n\nThe array must satisfy two conditions: \n\n1. The sum of all elements must be zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum from the left must never be negative. \n\n3. The cumulative sum from the right must never be positive. \n\nWait, perhaps the second and third conditions are necessary. \n\nLet me think of the cumulative sum from the left. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right, and track the cumulative sum. \n\nEach step, the cumulative sum must be non-negative. \n\nBecause, the pointer can't move left from the first position until it has moved right first. \n\nWait, maybe the cumulative sum represents the number of times the pointer has moved right minus left up to that point. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum up to position i must be non-negative. \n\nSimilarly, when processing from the right, the cumulative sum must be non-positive. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nLet me define the cumulative sum S[i] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[i]. \n\nThe first condition is that S[n] =0. \n\nThe second condition is that for all i from 1 to n, S[i] >=0. \n\nThe third condition is that for all i from 1 to n, the cumulative sum from the end must be <=0. \n\nWait, perhaps the third condition is that the reverse cumulative sum (starting from the end) must be <=0. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the reverse cumulative sum. \n\nLet me define T[i] = a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[n]. \n\nThen, T[i] must be <=0 for all i from 1 to n. \n\nWait, perhaps that's the case. \n\nLet me see with the sample test case 2: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe cumulative sum S[i] is: \n\nS[1] =2, S[2]=1, S[3]=0, S[4]=0. \n\nAll are non-negative. \n\nThe reverse cumulative sum T[i] for each position: \n\nT[1] =2 + (-1) + (-1) +0 =0 \n\nT[2] =-1 + (-1)+0 =-2 \n\nT[3] =-1 +0 =-1 \n\nT[4] =0 \n\nAll are <=0. \n\nSo that works. \n\nAnother example: the array [1, -1]. \n\nS[1]=1, S[2]=0. \n\nT[1] =0, T[2]=-1. \n\nAll conditions met. \n\nAnother example: [1, -2]. \n\nS[1]=1, S[2]=-1 (which violates the first condition, so it's rejected). \n\nAnother example: [3, -1, -2]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nS[1]=3, S[2]=2, S[3]=0. \n\nT[1] =0, T[2]=-2-1 (wait, let me compute T[i] as the sum from i to end. \n\nWait, T[1] =3 + (-1) + (-2) =0 \n\nT[2] =-1 + (-2) =-3 \n\nT[3] =-2 \n\nAll are <=0. \n\nSo this array would be accepted. \n\nBut can it be formed? \n\nLet me see: \n\nWe need to get a[1]=3, a[2]=-1, a[3]=-2. \n\nHmm, let's see. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1. \n\nTo get a[1] =3, you must have moved right 3 times from position 1, but each time you move right, you add 1 to a[1]. \n\nWait, but moving right from 1 would take you to 2, then you can move left back. \n\nWait, perhaps the path is: \n\nMove right 3 times from 1 (each time adding 1 to a[1], then moving to 2. \n\nWait, but moving right from 1 three times would take you to position 4 (if n=3?), but in this case n=3. \n\nWait, let's see for n=3. \n\nWait, the array is [3, -1, -2]. \n\nHmm, let's try to construct it. \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right (a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. \n\nMove right again (a[2] becomes 1, move to 3. \n\nMove right again (a[3] becomes 1, move to 4 (but n=3, so can't do that. So this approach won't work. \n\nHmm, maybe I need a different path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path is: \n\nMove right from 1 to 2 (a[1] +=1 \u2192 1). \n\nThen move left back to 1 (a[2] -=1 \u2192 0). \n\nThen move right again to 2 (a[1] +=1 \u2192 2, then move to 2. \n\nThen move right to 3 (a[2] +=1 \u2192 1, move to 3. \n\nThen move left to 2 (a[3] -=1 \u2192 -1, move to 2. \n\nThen move left to 1 (a[2] -=1 \u2192 0, move to 1. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conditions are necessary but not sufficient. \n\nWait, maybe the conditions are sufficient. \n\nLet me think of the conditions again: \n\nThe array must satisfy: \n\n1. Sum of all elements is zero. \n\n2. The cumulative sum from the left (S[i]) is non-negative for all i. \n\n3. The cumulative sum from the right (T[i]) is non-positive for all i. \n\nIf these conditions are met, then it's possible. \n\nSo the algorithm would be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Check if the total sum is zero. \n\n- Compute the cumulative sum from left to right, ensuring all are non-negative. \n\n- Compute the cumulative sum from right to left, ensuring all are non-positive. \n\nWait, but how to compute the right cumulative sum? \n\nAlternatively, the right cumulative sum can be computed as follows: \n\nLet me define T[i] as the sum of a[i] + a[i+1] + ... + a[n]. \n\nThis must be <=0 for all i. \n\nSo for each i from 1 to n, T[i] <=0. \n\nTo compute T[i], we can compute the reverse cumulative sum. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute it by starting from the end. \n\nSo the steps for the code would be: \n\nRead the array. \n\nCheck sum is zero. \n\nCheck that all prefix sums (S[i]) are non-negative. \n\nCheck that all suffix sums (T[i]) are non-positive. \n\nIf all three conditions are met, output yes, else no. \n\nThis seems manageable. \n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently. \n\nThe constraints are n up to 2e5, but with sum of n over test cases up to 2e5, so O(n) per test case is acceptable. \n\nSo the steps for code: \n\nFor each test case: \n\nRead n and the array. \n\nCompute the total sum. If not zero, output no. \n\nElse compute the prefix sums. \n\nCheck if any prefix sum is negative. If yes, output no. \n\nThen compute the suffix sums. \n\nWait, but how to compute the suffix sums efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, the suffix sum T[i] = sum from a[i] to a[n]. \n\nWe can compute this by starting from the end and accumulating backwards. \n\nInitialize a variable suffix_sum =0. \n\nLoop from i =n downto 1: \n\n   suffix_sum += a[i]; \n\n   if (suffix_sum >0) \u2192 invalid. \n\n   store or check here. \n\nWait, but T[i] is the sum from a[i] to a[n]. \n\nSo when we go from the end, the suffix_sum after adding a[i] is exactly T[i]. \n\nThus, we can loop from the end, accumulating the sum, and check if any of these sums exceeds zero. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\nRead the array. \n\nCheck sum is zero. \n\nCheck all prefix sums are non-negative. \n\nCheck all suffix sums (from the end) are non-positive. \n\nIf all conditions met \u2192 yes, else no. \n\nThis should work. \n\nNow, let's see the sample test case 2: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nPrefix sums: 2, 1, 0, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nSuffix sums: \n\nStarting from the end: \n\n0 \u2192 T[4] =0 \u2192 okay. \n\n-1 +0 =-1 \u2192 T[3] =-1 \u2192 okay. \n\n-1 + (-1) +0 =-2 \u2192 T[2] =-2 \u2192 okay. \n\n2 + (-1) + (-1) +0 =0 \u2192 T[1] =0 \u2192 okay. \n\nAll suffix sums are <=0. \n\nThus, yes. \n\nAnother test case: [1, -1]. \n\nPrefix sums: 1, 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSuffix sums: \n\n-1 \u2192 T[2] =-1 \u2192 okay. \n\n1 + (-1) =0 \u2192 T[1] =0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThus, yes. \n\nAnother test case [3, -1, -2]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nPrefix sums: 3, 2, 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSuffix sums: \n\n-2 \u2192 T[3] =-2 \u2192 okay. \n\n-1 + (-2) =-3 \u2192 T[2] =-3 \u2192 okay. \n\n3 + (-1) + (-2) =0 \u2192 T[1] =0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThus, it would be accepted. \n\nBut can this array be formed? \n\nHmm, let's see. \n\nThe array is [3, -1, -2]. \n\nWe need to get a[1] =3, a[2]=-1, a[3]=-2. \n\nLet me try to find a path. \n\nStart at 1. \n\nWe need to have a[1] =3. \n\nEach time we move right from 1, we add 1 to a[1]. \n\nEach time we move left from 1, we subtract 1 (but can't move left from 1). \n\nSo to get a[1] =3, we must have moved right from 1 exactly 3 times, and never moved left from 1. \n\nBut moving right from 1 takes us to 2. \n\nSo the path must involve moving right 3 times from 1, but each time you move right, you have to move to the next position. \n\nWait, but moving right from 1 three times would take you to position 4 (if n=3, that's beyond the array). \n\nWait, n is 3 here. \n\nSo moving right from 1 three times is impossible. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nHmm, so my previous approach might be incorrect. \n\nWait, in this case, the array [3, -1, -2] would be accepted by the conditions but is actually impossible. \n\nSo the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so I need to rethink. \n\nWhat's wrong here? \n\nLet me see the array [3, -1, -2]. \n\nThe sum is 0. \n\nPrefix sums are 3, 2, 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSuffix sums are -2, -3, 0 \u2192 all <=0. \n\nBut can this array be formed? \n\nLet me try to find a path. \n\nWe need a[1] =3. \n\nEach time you move right from 1, you add 1 to a[1]. \n\nTo get 3, you must have moved right from 1 three times. \n\nEach time you move right from 1, you go to 2. \n\nSo after first right move: a[1] is 1, position 2. \n\nSecond right move from 2: a[2] becomes 1, position 3. \n\nThird right move from 3: can't, since it's the last element. \n\nSo you can't move right three times from 1. \n\nHmm, so this array is impossible. \n\nThus, the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nSo my previous approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so I need to find another approach. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that the pointer ends at position 1. \n\nThe path must start and end at 1. \n\nThe array a[i] is the net of R[i] - L[i], where R[i] is the number of right moves from i, L[i] the left moves from i. \n\nThe total R[i] must equal total L[i], since the net displacement is zero. \n\nThe sum of a[i] is zero. \n\nNow, the path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 1. \n\nThe key is to model the path such that the net moves from each position give the a[i]. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and also the sum is zero. \n\nBut in the previous example, the cumulative sums are okay, but the array is impossible. \n\nHmm, so what's the problem with that example? \n\nThe array [3, -1, -2]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left is 3, 2, 0. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the right is -2, -3, 0. \n\nBut the problem is that the third element's cumulative sum from the right is -2, but the third element's a[3] is -2. \n\nWait, but how to get a[3] =-2. \n\nThe a[3] is R[3] - L[3]. \n\nTo have a[3] =-2, R[3] - L[3] =-2 \u2192 L[3] = R[3] +2. \n\nBut the pointer can only move left from 3 if it has moved there from the right. \n\nSo the number of left moves from 3 must be equal to the number of times the pointer was at 3 and moved left. \n\nBut to move left from 3, the pointer must have come from 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the path can't reach position 3 enough times to allow the required moves. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sums from left and right, but also the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive. \n\nAdditionally, the cumulative sum from the right must be <= the cumulative sum from the left. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the path as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1. \n\nEach move to the right increases the current cell and moves right. \n\nEach move to the left decreases the current cell and moves left. \n\nThe final position is 1. \n\nThe total number of right moves must equal the left moves. \n\nThe array a[i] is R[i] - L[i]. \n\nThe path must form a closed walk. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of steps. \n\nThe path can be represented as a series of moves: R, R, L, etc. \n\nThe net displacement is zero. \n\nThe key is to model the path such that the net moves from each position give the a[i]. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the path's movement and track the required conditions. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me track the current position pos. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1. \n\nThe path must end at 1. \n\nThe array a[i] must be the net of R[i] - L[i]. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe net moves from each position must be a[i]. \n\nThe path must start and end at 1. \n\nThe problem is to determine whether such a path exists. \n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a way to model it with the following conditions: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and also the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to position i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at position i. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nThe path must be such that the pointer never goes beyond the array's bounds. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i must be the number of times the pointer has moved right up to that point minus left moves. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum S[i] = a[1] + ... + a[i] must be the number of times the pointer has been at position i and moved right, minus the number of times moved left from i. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the cumulative sum S[i] represents the net displacement up to position i. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum S[i] must be the current position after processing up to i. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nEach right move increases the position by 1. \n\nEach left move decreases by 1. \n\nThe path must end at 1. \n\nThe cumulative sum of the moves (R - L) must be zero. \n\nThe path's position after each step must be between 1 and n. \n\nThe array a[i] is the net of R[i] - L[i]. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the path's position and ensure that it never goes out of bounds. \n\nBut how to do that with the given array? \n\nAlternatively, the following approach: \n\nThe pointer's position can be tracked as follows: \n\nLet me denote the current position as pos. \n\nInitially, pos =1. \n\nThe path is a sequence of moves. \n\nEach move is either R or L. \n\nThe final pos must be 1. \n\nThe array a[i] is the number of times the pointer was at i and moved R minus the number of times it moved L from i. \n\nThe problem is to determine if such a sequence exists. \n\nThis seems difficult to model directly. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are the following: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and also the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nAlternatively, the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, let me think of the example where the array is [3, -1, -2]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i=1 is 3. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the right starting at i=1 is 0 (3-1-2=0). \n\n3 >=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=2: cumulative left sum is 2. \n\nCumulative right sum from i=2 is -3 ( -1-2 =-3). \n\n2 >=-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=3: cumulative left sum is 0. \n\nCumulative right sum from i=3 is -2 \u2192 0 >=-2 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo this condition is met, but the array is impossible. \n\nHmm, so this doesn't help. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nLet me think of the problem differently. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1 and must end at 1. \n\nEach time you move right from position i, you add 1 to a[i]. \n\nEach time you move left from position i, you subtract 1 from a[i]. \n\nThe total number of right moves from i is R[i], left moves L[i]. \n\nThus, a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. \n\nThe total displacement is zero: sum over all (R[i] - L[i]) =0. \n\nThe path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 1. \n\nThe path can be represented as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe key is to find R and L arrays such that the above conditions are met and the path is valid. \n\nThe path must never go out of bounds. \n\nThe path's position after each move must be between 1 and n. \n\nThe path's position after each move can be tracked as follows: \n\nLet me denote the path as a sequence of positions: pos_0, pos_1, ..., pos_k, where pos_0 =1 and pos_k =1. \n\nEach move from pos_j to pos_{j+1} is either +1 or -1. \n\nThe net displacement is zero. \n\nThe array a[i] is the number of times the move from i was to the right minus the number of times it was to the left. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and also the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, let me think of the example [3, -1, -2]. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i=1 is 3. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the right starting at i=1 is 0. \n\n3 >=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=2: cumulative left sum is 2. \n\nCumulative right sum from i=2 is -3 \u2192 2 >=-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=3: cumulative left sum is 0. \n\nCumulative right sum from i=3 is -2 \u2192 0 >=-2 \u2192 okay. \n\nBut the array is impossible. \n\nHmm, so this condition is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nBut in the example, this holds but the array is impossible. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the example I thought of is actually possible? \n\nWait, let me try to find a path for the array [3, -1, -2]. \n\nThe array is [3, -1, -2]. \n\nWe need to have a[1] =3, a[2]=-1, a[3]=-2. \n\nLet me try to construct the path. \n\nStart at 1. \n\nWe need to have R[1] - L[1] =3. \n\nSince L[1] can't be more than R[1], because you can't move left from 1 until you've moved right. \n\nSo R[1] must be at least 3. \n\nEach time you move right from 1, you add 1 to a[1]. \n\nSo to get a[1] =3, you must have moved right from 1 three times. \n\nBut each time you move right from 1, you move to 2. \n\nSo after the first right move from 1: \n\na[1] =1, position 2. \n\nSecond right move from 2: \n\na[2] =1, position 3. \n\nThird right move from 3: can't move right (n=3). \n\nSo this is impossible. \n\nThus, the array is impossible. \n\nSo the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so what's the missing condition? \n\nPerhaps the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1. \n\nWait, let me think of the example: \n\nFor the array [3, -1, -2], the cumulative sum from the left up to i=1 is 3. \n\nThe cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1 (i=1 \u2192 i+1=2) is -3 (a[2]+a[3] =-3). \n\n3 >=-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=2: cumulative left sum is 2. \n\nCumulative right from i+1=3 is -2 \u2192 2 >=-2 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=3: cumulative left sum is 0. \n\nCumulative right from i+1=4 (which is beyond the array, so 0). \n\n0 >=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nHmm, this condition also holds. \n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 1 and must end at 1. \n\nThe net number of right moves from each position must be a[i] plus the number of left moves from that position. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of right moves from position i is R[i], and left moves from i is L[i]. \n\nThus, a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. \n\nThe path must form a closed walk. \n\nThe total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves. \n\nThe path's position changes must be valid. \n\nThe key is to model the path such that the net moves from each position give the a[i]. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the path as follows: \n\nThe path can be represented as a sequence of moves that starts and ends at 1. \n\nThe net moves from each position must be a[i]. \n\nThe path must never go out of bounds. \n\nThe problem is to determine whether such a path exists. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a greedy approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nWe can model the path as a series of moves that can be represented as a sequence of steps. \n\nThe net moves from each position must be a[i]. \n\nThe path must start and end at 1. \n\nThe path must be such that the pointer never goes out of bounds. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can work: \n\nWe can track the current position and the required moves. \n\nBut this might be too slow for large n. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions are necessary and sufficient: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and the sum is zero. \n\nBut the example I had earlier shows that this is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in that example. \n\nWait, the array [3, -1, -2] has a sum of zero. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the left are 3, 2, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThe cumulative sums from the right are -2, -3, 0 \u2192 all non-positive. \n\nBut the array is impossible. \n\nSo the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so what's the missing condition? \n\nPerhaps the cumulative sum from the left must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at the same position. \n\nWait, for each position i, the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nIn the example: \n\nAt i=1: left sum is 3, right sum is 0 \u2192 3 >=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=2: left sum is 2, right sum is -3 \u2192 2 >=-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=3: left sum is 0, right sum is-2 \u2192 0 >=-2 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo this condition holds. \n\nHmm, so what's the problem? \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be >= the cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nFor the example: \n\nAt i=1: left sum is 3, right sum starting at i+1=2 is -3 \u2192 3 >=-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=2: left sum is 2, right sum starting at 3 is-2 \u2192 2 >=-2 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=3: left sum is 0, right sum starting at 4 is 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo this condition holds. \n\nBut the array is impossible. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nEach time you move right, you increase the current cell and move right. \n\nEach time you move left, you decrease the current cell and move left. \n\nThe final position is 1. \n\nThe array a is the result of all these operations. \n\nThe key is to model the path such that the net changes in each cell are correct. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe path must form a closed walk that starts and ends at 1. \n\nThe net number of times the pointer moves right from position i minus the number of times it moves left from i must be a[i]. \n\nThe path must never go out of bounds. \n\nThe problem is to determine whether such a path exists. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can work: \n\nThe path can be represented as a series of moves that can be decomposed into segments between the first and last positions. \n\nAlternatively, the following approach inspired by the problem's note: \n\nThe pointer must move in such a way that the cumulative sum from the left never drops below zero, and the cumulative sum from the right never exceeds zero. \n\nAdditionally, the cumulative sum from the left must be greater than or equal to the cumulative sum from the right starting at the same position. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct conditions are the following: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and for all i, the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be greater than or equal to the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nWait, let me see the example: \n\nFor the array [3, -1, -2], the cumulative sum from the left up to i=1 is 3, and the cumulative sum from the right starting at i=1 is 0. \n\n3 >=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=2: left sum is 2, right sum is-3 \u2192 2 >=-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=3: left sum is 0, right sum is-2 \u2192 0 >=-2 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo this condition holds, but the array is impossible. \n\nHmm, so this isn't sufficient. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be greater than or equal to the cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nFor the example: \n\nAt i=1: left sum is 3, right sum starting at i+1=2 is-3 \u2192 3 >=-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=2: left sum is 2, right sum starting at 3 is-2 \u2192 2 >=-2 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=3: left sum is 0, right sum starting at 4 is0 \u2192 okay. \n\nStill holds. \n\nHmm, I'm not making progress. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 1. \n\nThe net number of times it moves right from position i minus left moves from i is a[i]. \n\nThe path must form a closed walk. \n\nThe total number of right moves must equal the number of left moves. \n\nThe path must never go out of bounds. \n\nThe key is to model the path such that the net moves from each position give the a[i]. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can work: \n\nThe path can be represented as a series of moves that can be decomposed into a sequence of loops. \n\nEach loop starts and ends at the same position. \n\nThe net effect of each loop must contribute to the a array. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach is correct: \n\nThe array must satisfy that the cumulative sum from the left is non-negative, the cumulative sum from the right is non-positive, and the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be greater than or equal to the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nBut the example still passes this. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be greater than or equal to the cumulative sum from the right starting at i. \n\nBut the example passes this. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the initial approach is correct and the example I thought of is actually possible. \n\nWait, let me try again to find a path for the array [3, -1, -2]. \n\nThe array is [3, -1, -2]. \n\nWe need a[1] =3, a[2]=-1, a[3]=-2. \n\nLet me try to construct the path: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right three times from 1: \n\nFirst move right: a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. \n\nSecond move right from 2: a[2] becomes 1, move to 3. \n\nThird move right from 3: can't move right (n=3). \n\nSo this is impossible. \n\nThus, the array is impossible. \n\nSo the conditions are not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so what's the missing condition? \n\nPerhaps the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, and the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and also the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be greater than or equal to the cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nFor the example: \n\nAt i=1: left sum is 3, right sum starting at i+1=2 is-3 \u2192 3 >=-3 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=2: left sum is 2, right sum starting at 3 is-2 \u2192 2 >=-2 \u2192 okay. \n\nAt i=3: left sum is 0, right sum starting at 4 is0 \u2192 okay. \n\nStill holds. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct conditions are the cumulative sum from the left must be non-negative, the cumulative sum from the right must be non-positive, and the cumulative sum from the left up to i must be greater than or equal to the cumulative sum from the right starting at i+1. \n\nBut this still holds for the example. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nEach time you move right, you increase the current cell and move right. \n\nEach time you move left, you decrease the current cell and move left. \n\nThe final position is 1. \n\nThe array a is the result of all these operations. \n\nThe net number of right moves from position i minus left moves from i is a[i]. \n\nThe path must form a closed walk. \n\nThe key is to model the path such that the net moves from each position give the a[i]. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can work: \n\nThe path must be such that the cumulative sum from the left up to i is the current position. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nThe cumulative sum from the left up to i is the net number of right moves minus left moves up to that point. \n\nThis would be the current position. \n\nWait, the current position after processing up to i is 1 + (R[i] - L[i]). \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the current position after processing up to i is the initial position plus the net moves up to that point. \n\nWait, the pointer's position after each move is determined by the moves made. \n\nThe cumulative sum of the moves (each right is +1, each left is -1) must be zero. \n\nThe path's position must never go below 1 or above n. \n\nThe array a[i] is the number of right moves from i minus left moves from i. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a path that starts and ends at 1, never goes out of bounds, and for each position i, the net moves from i is a[i]. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a greedy approach. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can work: \n\nWe can model the path as follows: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 1. \n\nWe can track the current position and the required moves. \n\nThe path must be such that the net moves from each position give the a[i]. \n\nThe path must be constructed in such a way that the pointer never goes out of bounds. \n\nThe algorithm would be: \n\nInitialize current position to 1. \n\nThe total required moves from each position are a[i]. \n\nWe can process the array from left to right, and track the current position. \n\nAt each step, we can decide whether to move right or left based on the required a[i]. \n\nBut this is vague. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work: \n\nThe path must be such that the cumulative sum from the left up to i is the current position. \n\nWait, let me think of the following: \n\nThe current position after processing up to position i is equal to the cumulative sum of the first i elements plus 1. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the current position after processing up to position i is 1 plus the cumulative sum of the first i elements. \n\nBecause each right move increases the position by 1, and each left move decreases by 1. \n\nThe net displacement after processing up to position i is the cumulative sum of a[1] to a[i]. \n\nWait, because a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. \n\nThe net displacement from position 1 is the sum of a[1] to a[i]. \n\nThus, the current position after processing up to position i is 1 + sum_{k=1 to i} a[k]. \n\nThis must be between 1 and n. \n\nThus, the following conditions must hold: \n\nFor all i from 1 to n: \n\n1 <= 1 + S[i] <= n \n\nwhere S[i] is the cumulative sum up to i. \n\nAdditionally, the total sum must be zero. \n\nThis is a crucial insight! \n\nAh! This is the missing condition. \n\nThe current position after processing up to position i must be between 1 and n. \n\nThus, the cumulative sum S[i] must satisfy: \n\nS[i] >=0 (because 1 + S[i] >=1 \u2192 S[i] >=0) \n\nand \n\nS[i] <= n-1 (because 1 + S[i] <=n \u2192 S[i] <=n-1). \n\nWait, but the cumulative sum S[i] is the sum of a[1] to a[i]. \n\nThus, the conditions are: \n\nFor all i from 1 to n: \n\nS[i] >=0 \n\nand \n\nS[i] <= (n-1) \n\nAdditionally, the total sum must be zero. \n\nWait, but also, the final position must be 1, so the total sum must be zero. \n\nThis is a crucial condition I missed earlier. \n\nSo the correct conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum of the array is zero. \n\n2. For all i from 1 to n: \n\n   a. The cumulative sum S[i] = a[1] + ... + a[i] must be >=0 \n\n   b. S[i] <= (n-1) \n\nWait, but why the upper bound? \n\nBecause the current position after processing up to i is 1 + S[i], which must be <=n. \n\nThus, S[i] <=n-1. \n\nThis is the missing condition. \n\nLet me test this with the previous example: \n\nExample 1: [3, -1, -2]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: \n\nS[1] =3 \u2192 which must be <=n-1 =2 (since n=3). \n\n3>2 \u2192 this violates the condition. \n\nThus, this array is rejected. \n\nAh! This is the missing condition. \n\nSo the correct conditions are: \n\nThe sum of the array must be zero. \n\nFor all i from 1 to n: \n\nS[i] >=0 \n\nS[i] <=n-1 \n\nThus, the algorithm should be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Compute the sum of the array. If not zero \u2192 no. \n\n- Compute the cumulative sums S[i]. \n\n- Check that all S[i] are between 0 and n-1 inclusive. \n\nIf all conditions are met \u2192 yes, else no. \n\nThis would correctly reject the previous example. \n\nLet me test this with other examples. \n\nSample test case 2: [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nn=4. \n\nCumulative sums: \n\nS[1]=2 \u2192 0<=2<=3 \u2192 yes. \n\nS[2]=1 \u2192 yes. \n\nS[3]=0 \u2192 yes. \n\nS[4]=0 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, accepted. \n\nAnother example: [1, -1]. \n\nn=2. \n\nS[1]=1 <=1 \u2192 yes. \n\nS[2]=0 \u2192 yes. \n\nAccepted. \n\nAnother example: [1, -2]. \n\nSum is -1 \u2192 rejected. \n\nAnother example: [3, -1, -2]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nS[1]=3 > 2 (n-1=2) \u2192 rejected. \n\nThus, this condition works. \n\nAnother test case: [2, -2]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nS[1]=2 \u2192 n=2 \u2192 n-1=1 \u2192 2>1 \u2192 rejected. \n\nThus, the array [2, -2] is rejected. \n\nBut can this array be formed? \n\nLet me see: \n\nThe array is [2, -2]. \n\nThe pointer starts at 1. \n\nTo get a[1]=2, you must have moved right twice from 1. \n\nFirst move right: a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. \n\nSecond move right: a[2] becomes 1, move to 3 (but n=2 \u2192 can't). \n\nThus, impossible. \n\nThus, the condition correctly rejects it. \n\nAnother example: [1, 0, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: \n\nS[1]=1 <=2 \u2192 yes. \n\nS[2]=1 \u2192 yes. \n\nS[3]=0 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, accepted. \n\nCan this array be formed? \n\nYes. \n\nPath: \n\nStart at 1. \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 1). \n\nMove right to 3 (a[2] becomes 1). \n\nMove left to 2 (a[3] becomes -1). \n\nMove left to 1 (a[2] becomes 0). \n\nFinal array: [1,0,-1]. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the conditions are correct. \n\nThus, the correct approach is to check the sum is zero, and all cumulative sums are between 0 and n-1. \n\nNow, the code needs to implement this. \n\nThe code currently has a loop that reads the elements and computes the sum, but it's not checking the upper bound. \n\nThe current code's logic is incorrect, but the correct approach is to compute the cumulative sum and check for each step whether it is within 0 and n-1. \n\nThus, the code should be modified as follows: \n\nFor each test case: \n\nRead n and the array. \n\nCompute the total sum. \n\nIf sum !=0 \u2192 output no. \n\nElse compute the cumulative sum S[i] for each i from 1 to n. \n\nCheck that all S[i] are between 0 and n-1. \n\nIf yes \u2192 yes, else no. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows: \n\nRead the array into a vector. \n\nCompute the total sum. \n\nIf sum !=0 \u2192 no. \n\nElse compute the cumulative sum, and check for each element. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nIn the code provided, the current loop is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code would be: \n\nRead the array into an array. \n\nCompute the total sum. \n\nIf sum !=0 \u2192 output no. \n\nElse compute the cumulative sum, and check for each step. \n\nThus, the code should be rewritten. \n\nNow, the original code's loop is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code would be: \n\nInside the test case loop: \n\nRead n. \n\nRead the array. \n\nCompute the total sum. \n\nIf sum !=0 \u2192 output no. \n\nElse compute the cumulative sum and check. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h> \n\nusing namespace std; \n\nint main() { \n\n    int t; \n\n    cin >> t; \n\n    while (t--) { \n\n        int n; \n\n        cin >> n; \n\n        vector<long long> a(n); \n\n        long long total =0; \n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { \n\n            cin >> a[i]; \n\n            total += a[i]; \n\n        } \n\n        if (total !=0) { \n\n            cout << \"NO\" << endl; \n\n            continue; \n\n        } \n\n        long long current =0; \n\n        bool valid = true; \n\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) { \n\n            current += a[i]; \n\n            if (current <0 || current > (n-1)) { \n\n                valid = false; \n\n                break; \n\n            } \n\n        } \n\n        if (valid) \n\n            cout << \"YES\" << endl; \n\n        else \n\n            cout << \"NO\" << endl; \n\n    } \n\n    return 0; \n\n} \n\nThis should work. \n\nNow, the original code's loop is incorrect. \n\nThe original code's loop is trying to read the elements in a way that causes re-reading. \n\nThe correct approach is to read all elements first, then compute the cumulative sum. \n\nThus, the missing code in the original code's TODO section is not the right approach. \n\nThe original code's logic is incorrect. \n\nThe correct code should be as above. \n\nThus, the user's code needs to be completely rewritten. \n\nBut the problem says to complete the given code. \n\nThe user's code has a loop that reads the elements and accumulates sum. \n\nThe code's current logic is: \n\nloop(i,1,n+1) { \n\n   cin >> in;

\n\nif (sum <0 || sum > (n-1)) \u2192 set stt=1. \n\nAlso, after processing all elements, check if the total sum is zero. \n\nThus, the code should be modified to: \n\nInitialize stt=0. \n\nsum =0. \n\nloop(i,1,n+1) { \n\n   cin >> in; \n\n   sum += in; \n\n   if (sum <0 || sum > (n-1)) \u2192 stt=1; \n\n} \n\nThen, also check if the total sum is zero. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nif (stt==0 && sum ==0 \u2192 yes else no. \n\nThus, the code's current loop can be modified to this. \n\nThe code's current loop has an else if (sum ==0) block which is incorrect. \n\nThus, the correct code would be: \n\nInside the test case loop: \n\nstt=0;
