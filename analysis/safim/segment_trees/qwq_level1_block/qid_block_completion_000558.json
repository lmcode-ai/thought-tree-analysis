There are n+1 benches in a row, numbered 1 to n+1. The distances between consecutive benches are given as a1 to an. The person starts at bench 1 and needs to reach bench n+1. They have an initial energy m. Each meter walked uses 1 energy. They can sit on benches to restore any amount of energy (so sitting longer gives more). The goal is to find the minimal total energy they need to restore (sum of all the times they sit) to reach the end. Hmm, the key here is to determine when and how much to sit to minimize the total energy added. Let's think of the process step by step. The person starts at bench 1. To get to bench 2, they need to walk a1 meters. So they spend a1 energy.",

The minimal added energy is the maximum between 0 and (sum of a_i - m). Therefore, the code can be written as: For each test case:\n\nRead n and m. \n\nRead the array a. \n\nCompute sum of a. The answer is max(0, sum - m). So the code's current structure is almost there. Looking at the code given:\n\nIn the solve function:\n\nsum is initialized to 0. Then, the loop over i from 0 to len (n) -1:\n\nInside the loop, the code is missing. Probably, the code should be adding the a_i's to sum. Then, after the loop, the code outputs max(0, sum - energy). Which is exactly what the current code is doing. Wait, the code's output line is:\n\ncout << max(0,sum-energy) << endl; Yes. So the missing code is simply to read the a_i's and add them to sum. The code currently has:\n\nLOOP(i,0,len) { / * TODO: Your code here */ }\n\nSo inside the loop, we need to read the a_i's and add to sum. Wait, the code's variables: In the solve function:\n\nint len, energy, seet; \n\nWait, the code has:\n\ncin >> len >> energy; \n\nThen sum is initialized to 0. Then the loop over i from 0 to len-1. The a_i's are n numbers (since len is n). So inside the loop, we need to read each a_i and add to sum. So the code should be:\n\nsum += a_i. But how to read a_i? The code currently doesn't have a variable for a_i. So inside the loop, we can do:\n\nint a; \n\ncin >> a; \n\nsum += a; Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint a; \n\ncin >> a; \n\nsum += a; \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a temporary variable. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\ncin >> a; sum += a; But since the variable a isn't declared yet, we need to declare it. Wait, the code's current variables in solve() are:\n\nint energy, len, seet; Wait, the code has:\n\nint len, energy, seet; Wait, the variables are declared as:\n\nint len, energy, seet; Wait, the first line in solve is:\n\ncin >> len >> energy; \n\nThen sum is declared as int sum =0; \n\nSo the variables are okay. So the code inside the loop should read each a_i and add to sum. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint a;\n\ncin >> a;\n\nsum += a; Alternatively, perhaps using a temporary variable. Alternatively, perhaps the code can read each a_i and add to sum without a variable. Like:\n\nsum += (a_i); \n\nBut to get a_i, you have to read it. So the code inside the loop must read each a_i. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\ncin >> a; sum += a; But since a is not declared, we need to declare it. Wait, the code inside the loop can be:\n\nint a; \n\ncin >> a; \n\nsum += a; So the code inside the loop is three lines. Therefore, the answer is to fill in those lines. So the code's missing part is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint a;\n\ncin >> a;\n\nsum += a; Alternatively, perhaps the code can read all a's into a variable, but since we don't need to store them, just sum, this is okay. Therefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is those three lines. Testing this with the first example:\n\nFirst test case: n=3, m=1. The a's are 1,2,1. sum becomes 4. \n\n4-1=3 \u2192 correct. Another test case where m is 10 and sum is 5 \u2192 answer 0. Yes. So the code is correct. Therefore, the missing code is those three lines.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code for the given problem. Let's read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about walking between benches. There are n+1 benches in a row, numbered 1 to n+1. The distances between consecutive benches are given as a1 to an. The person starts at bench 1 and needs to reach bench n+1. They have an initial energy m. Each meter walked uses 1 energy. They can sit on benches to restore any amount of energy (so sitting longer gives more). The goal is to find the minimal total energy they need to restore (sum of all the times they sit) to reach the end.\n\nHmm, the key here is to determine when and how much to sit to minimize the total energy added. Let's think of the process step by step.\n\nThe person starts at bench 1. To get to bench 2, they need to walk a1 meters. So they spend a1 energy. If their current energy is enough, they can proceed. But if not, they have to sit before starting that walk to get enough energy. Wait, but they can only sit on the benches. Wait, when can they sit? They can sit on the benches they are currently on. So the process is: they start on bench 1. They can choose to sit there, adding some energy. Then they walk to the next bench. But walking requires that they have enough energy for the distance. So the steps are:\n\nAt each bench i (starting from 1), they can sit and restore some energy (any amount, possibly zero). Then they must walk to the next bench (i+1), which requires a_i meters. But they can't walk if their current energy is less than a_i. So the order is: sit on current bench (to gain energy), then walk. So the sitting must be done before each walk.\n\nWait, the problem says: you can restore energy by sitting on benches. So whenever you are on a bench, you can sit there to restore energy. So the process is: you start on bench 1. You can sit there, then walk to bench 2. Then sit on bench 2 (if needed), then walk to 3, etc. So each time before walking between i and i+1, you can sit on bench i to gain energy. \n\nThe minimal total energy to add is the sum of all the energy added at each bench. The goal is to choose how much to add at each bench so that you can make all the walks, and the sum is minimized.\n\nHmm, how to model this. Let's think of the process step by step. Let's track the current energy. \n\nInitially, energy is m. \n\nFor each segment a_i (distance between bench i and i+1):\n\n- Before walking this segment, you can sit on bench i to add some energy. Let's say you add x_i energy here. Then, the total energy becomes (current_energy + x_i). \n\n- Then, you need to subtract a_i from that to walk. So after walking, the energy is (current_energy + x_i - a_i). \n\nBut you can't have negative energy after walking. Wait, but the problem says you can't walk if you have no energy. So the energy before walking must be at least a_i. \n\nWait, the process is: you can only walk if you have enough energy. So before each walk, the current energy (after sitting) must be >= a_i. \n\nThe key is to decide how much to add at each bench so that each a_i can be covered, and the sum of all x_i is minimized.\n\nThe minimal total x is the sum of all x_i. \n\nSo how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think of the process step by step. Let's track the current energy after each step. \n\nInitially, current_energy = m.\n\nFor each a_i in the sequence a_1 to a_n:\n\n1. Before walking a_i, you can sit on bench i, adding x_i energy. The total energy after sitting is (current_energy + x_i). \n\n2. Then, you must subtract a_i. So after walking, the energy is (current_energy + x_i - a_i). \n\nBut the requirement is that (current_energy + x_i) >= a_i. \n\nWe need to choose x_i such that this holds, and the sum of x_i is minimized. \n\nThe minimal x_i for each step would be the maximum between 0 and (a_i - current_energy). Because if current_energy is already >= a_i, then x_i can be 0. Otherwise, you need to add (a_i - current_energy) to reach exactly a_i, so that after using a_i, the energy becomes 0. But wait, maybe adding more could be better for future steps?\n\nWait, but adding more than needed here would allow you to have more energy for the next steps, which might reduce the need to add in the future. So perhaps it's better to add as much as needed here, but not more, but maybe sometimes adding more now can save more in the future.\n\nHmm, this seems like a greedy problem. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose m is 3, and the a's are [4, 5]. \n\nFirst step: a1 is 4. Current energy is 3. So to walk, you need at least 4. So you have to add 1 here. Then after sitting, you have 4, subtract 4, so energy is 0. \n\nThen next step a2 is 5. You have 0, so you need to add 5 here. Total added is 6. \n\nAlternatively, if in the first step you added 4 (so total energy becomes 7, then subtract 4 gives 3. Then for the second step, you can add 2 (since 3 +2 =5, subtract 5 gives 0. Total added is 4+2=6. Same total. \n\nWait, but in this case, adding more in the first step doesn't help. Hmm. \n\nWait another example: m=3, a's are [3, 4]. \n\nFirst step: a1 is 3. Current energy is 3. So x1 can be 0. After walking, energy is 0. \n\nSecond step: a2 is 4. Need to have at least 4. So must add 4. Total is 4. \n\nAlternatively, if in first step, you add 1 (so energy becomes 4, then subtract 3 gives 1. Then for a2, you need 4, so need to add 3. Total is 4. Same. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal is achieved by taking the minimal x_i each time. \n\nWait, but maybe sometimes adding more now can save in the future. Let me think of another example. \n\nSuppose m=5, a's are [6, 1]. \n\nFirst a is 6. Current energy is 5. So need to add 1 (so total 6, subtract 6 gives 0. Then next a is 1, need to add 1. Total 2. \n\nAlternatively, if in first step, add 2 (so energy becomes 7, subtract 6 gives 1. Then next a is 1, so can do without adding. Total 2. Same. \n\nHmm, same total. \n\nAnother example: m=2, a's are [3, 3]. \n\nFirst step: need to add 1 (so energy becomes 3, subtract 3 \u2192 0. Then next step needs 3, so add 3. Total 4. \n\nAlternatively, if first step add 4 (so energy 6, subtract 3 \u2192 3. Then next step can subtract 3 \u2192 0. So total added is 4. Same. \n\nHmm, so maybe the minimal is indeed achieved by taking the minimal x_i each time. \n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is to, at each step, add just enough to cover the current a_i, and then proceed. Because adding more would not help in reducing the total, since the next steps can be handled by their own minimal additions. \n\nTherefore, the greedy approach of taking the minimal required at each step is optimal. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_energy = m.\n\ntotal_added = 0.\n\nfor each a_i in a_1 to a_n:\n\n    if current_energy < a_i:\n\n        needed = a_i - current_energy\n\n        total_added += needed\n\n        current_energy += needed\n\n    // Now, subtract a_i from current_energy\n\n    current_energy -= a_i\n\n    // but if current_energy becomes negative? No, because we added needed to make it at least a_i before subtracting.\n\n    // So after adding needed, current_energy is exactly a_i, so subtract a_i gives 0.\n\nWait, but what if after adding needed, current_energy is more than a_i? Like, if you have some leftover energy from previous steps. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose current_energy is 5, a_i is 3. Then you don't need to add anything. Subtract 3 \u2192 2. \n\nSo the key is, for each a_i, the required is max(0, a_i - current_energy). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nAt each step:\n\nif current_energy < a_i:\n\n   add (a_i - current_energy) \u2192 total_added += (a_i - current_energy)\n\n   current_energy = a_i \n\nthen subtract a_i \u2192 current_energy becomes (a_i - a_i) = 0? \n\nWait no, because after adding, current_energy is (current_energy + added) = a_i. Then subtract a_i \u2192 0. \n\nAlternatively, if current_energy was already >= a_i, then subtract a_i \u2192 current_energy becomes (current_energy - a_i). \n\nWait, that's right. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_energy = m.\n\ntotal_added = 0.\n\nfor each a in a_list:\n\n    if current_energy < a:\n\n        needed = a - current_energy\n\n        total_added += needed\n\n        current_energy += needed\n\n    current_energy -= a\n\nSo after each step, current_energy is (current_energy - a). \n\nWait, but in the case where current_energy was sufficient, then after subtracting a, it's current_energy - a. \n\nThis way, the next steps can use the remaining energy. \n\nYes, this seems correct. \n\nSo the code needs to loop through each a_i, and compute this. \n\nNow, looking at the given code:\n\nThe code in solve() reads len (n) and energy (m). Then sum is initialized to 0. Then a loop over i from 0 to len-1 (since len is n). \n\nThe TODO is inside the loop. \n\nWait, the code's current setup is:\n\nsum is initialized to 0. \n\nThen, in the loop over the a_i's, the code is missing. \n\nThe output is cout << max(0, sum - energy) << endl; \n\nWait, that's confusing. Because the current code's output is max(0, sum - energy). But according to the problem, the required output is the total_added, which is the sum of all the needed added. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the code is trying to compute sum as the total needed, but maybe the code is structured differently. \n\nWait, let me see. The code's current structure is:\n\nsum is 0. \n\nThen, in the loop over the a_i's, perhaps the code is accumulating the needed. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, after the loop, it outputs max(0, sum - energy). \n\nHmm, that suggests that perhaps the code is trying to compute the total needed as sum, but maybe the approach is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the total required energy, and subtract the initial m. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the total energy needed to walk all the a_i's, which is the sum of all a_i's. \n\nThe minimal total energy required is sum(a_i). Since you start with m, the required added is max( sum(a_i) - m, 0 ). \n\nBut that can't be right, because the example given in the problem's note shows that this approach would be wrong. \n\nWait, let's look at the first example in the note. \n\nFirst test case example:\n\nSuppose the input is n=3, m=1. \n\nThe a's are [1, 2, 3]. \n\nThe sum of a_i is 6. \n\nSo sum(a_i) - m = 6-1=5. But according to the note, the answer is 3. \n\nWait, the example's first case says the answer is 3. \n\nWait, the example's first test case must have different numbers. Let me think. \n\nThe note says: \n\nIn the first test case of the example, you can walk to bench 2 (distance 1, using 1 energy, leaving 0. Then restore 2 units on bench 2 (so now 2), walk 2 meters (distance 2, so energy becomes 0. Then restore 1 on bench 3, walk 3 meters (but wait, the a_i's must be 1, 2, 1? Or maybe the example's a's are 1,2,1? Let me see the note's example:\n\nThe note says: \n\nIn the first test case, the path is: \n\nbench1 \u2192 bench2 (distance 1, uses 1 energy. Then restore 2 on bench2. Then walk to bench3 (distance 2, uses 2 \u2192 total added so far is 2. Then restore 1 on bench3, walk to bench4 (distance 1? Or maybe the third a_i is 3? \n\nWait the note's example's path is: \n\nAfter bench2, they restore 2, then walk to bench3 (distance 2, so that's okay. Then restore 1 on bench3, then walk to bench4 (distance 1). \n\nSo the a's would be [1,2,1]. \n\nThe total added is 2 +1 =3. \n\nThe sum of a_i is 4. \n\nThe initial m is 1. \n\nsum(a_i) is 4. 4-1=3, which matches the answer. \n\nHmm, so in that case, the formula sum(a_i) - m would give the correct answer. \n\nWait, but what about another example where that formula would fail?\n\nSuppose m is 3, and a's are [4,5]. \n\nsum(a_i) is 9. 9-3=6. Which matches the first example I thought of. \n\nAnother example: m=5, a's [6,1]. sum is 7. 7-5=2, which matches the example. \n\nHmm, so maybe the correct answer is simply the maximum between 0 and (sum of all a_i - m). \n\nWait, but why would that be the case? Because the minimal added energy is the total needed to cover the deficit between the total required (sum a_i) and the initial m. \n\nWait, but how does that work with the steps? Because in the process, you can choose when to add energy, but the total added must be at least (sum a_i - m). \n\nBecause the total energy used is sum a_i. The initial m plus the added energy must be >= sum a_i. So the minimal added is max(0, sum a_i - m). \n\nWait, that's a much simpler approach. \n\nWait, but why does the first example's note work with that? \n\nIn the first example, sum a_i is 1+2+1=4. m is 1. 4-1=3, which matches. \n\nAnother example: m=2, a's [3,3]. sum is 6. 6-2=4, which matches the example. \n\nHmm, so maybe the problem can be solved by just computing the total required energy (sum a_i) and subtract the initial m. If that's positive, that's the answer, else 0. \n\nBut why does this work? Because the problem allows you to sit on any bench, so you can choose to sit only once at the beginning. \n\nWait, for example, if you have enough initial energy to cover the first steps, but not the total. \n\nWait, let's take an example where the sum is S, and m is less than S. \n\nThe minimal added is S - m. \n\nBecause you can sit at the first bench and add (S - m) energy. Then you have m + (S - m) = S. Then you can walk all the a_i's, using exactly S, ending with 0. \n\nSo that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, you could distribute the added energy in different steps, but the total would still be S - m. \n\nSo the minimal possible is indeed S - m if S > m, else 0. \n\nWait, this seems to be the case. \n\nSo the problem reduces to simply calculating the sum of all a_i, subtract m, and if that's positive, that's the answer. \n\nBut why did the problem mention the benches and the process of sitting on each bench? Because maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nWait, let me think of a case where the sum is S, but you can't just add all at the beginning. \n\nSuppose m is 1, and a's are [3, 3]. \n\nSum is 6. So S - m =5. \n\nIf you add 5 at the start, you have 6. Then walk 3 \u2192 3 left. Then walk 3 \u2192 0. That works. \n\nAlternatively, if you can't add all at once? No, the problem says you can sit on any bench and add any amount. So you can choose to add all at the first bench. \n\nSo the minimal is indeed S - m. \n\nAnother example: \n\nSuppose m is 4, and a's are [5, 1]. \n\nSum is 6. 6-4=2. \n\nIf you add 1 at the first bench (total 5), walk 5 \u2192 0. Then you need to add 1 at bench 2 to walk 1. Total added 2. \n\nAlternatively, adding 2 at the first bench (total 6). Then walk 5 \u2192 1, then walk 1 \u2192 0. Total added 2. \n\nEither way, the total is 2. \n\nSo the formula holds. \n\nHmm, so the problem is actually simpler than I thought. The minimal added energy is the maximum between 0 and (sum of a_i - m). \n\nTherefore, the code can be written as: \n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n and m. \n\nRead the array a. \n\nCompute sum of a. \n\nThe answer is max(0, sum - m). \n\nSo the code's current structure is almost there. \n\nLooking at the code given:\n\nIn the solve function:\n\nsum is initialized to 0. \n\nThen, the loop over i from 0 to len (n) -1:\n\nInside the loop, the code is missing. \n\nProbably, the code should be adding the a_i's to sum. \n\nThen, after the loop, the code outputs max(0, sum - energy). \n\nWhich is exactly what the current code is doing. \n\nWait, the code's output line is:\n\ncout << max(0,sum-energy) << endl;\n\nYes. \n\nSo the missing code is simply to read the a_i's and add them to sum. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nLOOP(i,0,len) { /* TODO: Your code here */ }\n\nSo inside the loop, we need to read the a_i's and add to sum. \n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nIn the solve function:\n\nint len, energy, seet; \n\nWait, the code has:\n\ncin >> len >> energy; \n\nThen sum is initialized to 0. \n\nThen the loop over i from 0 to len-1. \n\nThe a_i's are n numbers (since len is n). \n\nSo inside the loop, we need to read each a_i and add to sum. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nsum += a_i. \n\nBut how to read a_i? \n\nThe code currently doesn't have a variable for a_i. \n\nSo inside the loop, we can do:\n\nint a; \n\ncin >> a; \n\nsum += a; \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint a; \n\ncin >> a; \n\nsum += a; \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a temporary variable. \n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\ncin >> a; sum += a; \n\nBut since the variable a isn't declared yet, we need to declare it. \n\nWait, the code's current variables in solve() are:\n\nint energy, len, seet; \n\nWait, the code has:\n\nint len, energy, seet; \n\nWait, the variables are declared as:\n\nint len, energy, seet; \n\nWait, the first line in solve is:\n\ncin >> len >> energy; \n\nThen sum is declared as int sum =0; \n\nSo the variables are okay. \n\nSo the code inside the loop should read each a_i and add to sum. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint a;\n\ncin >> a;\n\nsum += a;\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a temporary variable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can read each a_i and add to sum without a variable. \n\nLike:\n\nsum += (a_i); \n\nBut to get a_i, you have to read it. \n\nSo the code inside the loop must read each a_i. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\ncin >> a; sum += a; \n\nBut since a is not declared, we need to declare it. \n\nWait, the code inside the loop can be:\n\nint a; \n\ncin >> a; \n\nsum += a; \n\nSo the code inside the loop is three lines. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill in those lines. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nInside the loop:\n\nint a;\n\ncin >> a;\n\nsum += a;\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can read all a's into a variable, but since we don't need to store them, just sum, this is okay. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is those three lines. \n\nTesting this with the first example:\n\nFirst test case: n=3, m=1. \n\nThe a's are 1,2,1. \n\nsum becomes 4. \n\n4-1=3 \u2192 correct. \n\nAnother test case where m is 10 and sum is 5 \u2192 answer 0. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is those three lines."
