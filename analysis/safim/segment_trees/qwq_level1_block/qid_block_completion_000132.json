So for the robot (x,y):\n\nIt can only reach (0,0) if:\n\n- It can move left to column 0 (y >=0 \u2192 always true). Wait, but moving left from y to 0 requires that during the move steps, the robot doesn't move outside. Wait, to move left, the robot must be in a column >= 1. So to move to column 0, it starts at column y >=0 \u2192 but must have y \u22651? No, if it's already at 0, then no move needed. Wait, the robot's path to column 0 must have it not moving left beyond. Let me think of all robots' positions.

Perhaps the following conditions must be met for some robot (i,j):\n\n- The robot can reach row 0 by moving up (i.e., its current row is >=0 \u2192 it is). So row can be reduced to 0 by moving up steps. - The robot can reach column 0 by moving left (i.e., its column is >=0 \u2192 but it must be possible to move left to 0. i.e., current column >=0 \u2192 which it is). Wait, but the robot's column must be >=0, which it is. But the problem is that other robots may block the path. Alternatively, the following condition is necessary:\n\nThe robot (i,j) must have:\n\ni <=0 \u2192 no, since it can be in lower rows.",

Wait no, because the robot can move left to 0. Wait, the robot must be able to move left to column 0. So for any robot in the top row (row 0), then the column must be >=0 (which it is). So to move left to 0, the robot must be in column >=0 \u2192 which it is. But the move is allowed as long as they don't go beyond. So the problem is not about the robot's starting column.

But in the previous example where the code failed, the top row's leftmost is 2, and the leftmost overall is 0. So the condition (2>0) \u2192 code outputs NO. But the correct answer is YES.

So the presence of the lower-row robot to the left of the top-most's leftmost is okay. Thus, the initial condition is not correct. Hmm. Perhaps the correct condition is that the leftmost column among all robots in the top row is <=0. But in the first example, it's 1, and the answer is yes. So that\u2019s not correct. Hmm.",

So it can be in row 0 already or moved there. If it\u2019s in row 0 already: then it can move left to 0. But must not be blocked by other robots in row 0 to the left. Alternatively, the robot's column must be >= the desired column (0), and there must be no robot to the left of it in the same row. Wait, no. Alternatively, when you decide to move left, all robots in the same row must have columns >=1 to not explode. Thus, the presence of a robot in (0,0) is already sufficient. Otherwise, to move some robot in row 0 to column 0 via left command: all other robots in row 0 must have columns >=1. Thus, the robot that is to be moved left must be in row 0, and its column must be >=0, and there's no other robot to the left of it in row 0. Thus, the condition for a robot in row 0 to reach (0,0) is that it's the leftmost in its row. If there exists any robot in row 0 with column 0 \u2192 yes. Otherwise, there must be a robot in row 0 whose column is the leftmost among that row, and that column is 0's column? No. Alternatively, if the leftmost robot in the top row (which could be row 0) has a column <=0 \u2192 but they can't have a column less than 0. Thus, the leftmost robot in the top row's column must be 0. Or, the column must be such that it can be moved left to 0. Wait, the leftmost robot's column is the smallest column in the top row. For example, if the top row has robots in columns 1 and 2. the leftmost is 1.",

No, the leftmost robot's column must be the smallest\uff0c so to reach 0, that robot must be able to move left to 0. The leftmost robot in the top row has column, say, c.

The commands can be any sequence of directions, but the final position must be (0,0) for the robot. Perhaps the minimal way to reach (0,0) is to move up i times and left j times in any order. But the order matters. For example, a robot in (2,3) must move up twice and left three times. The order could be all ups first then lefts. Or any permutation. Thus, we can try the following approach for a given robot (i,j): The required steps are to move up i times (if the robot is in row i), and left j times to reach (0,0). The sequence of commands must include 'up' exactly i times and 'left' exactly j times.",

We can try both approaches and see if any of them works. Alternatively, the following conditions must be met for the robot to reach (0,0):\n\n1. It can move up to row 0 (i.e., i <= n-1 \u2192 always true). 2. It can move left to column 0 (j <= m-1 \u2192 true). 3. During the process of moving up and left, no other robot is moved out of bounds. The third condition is tricky.",

Thus, perhaps the correct condition is that the leftmost column of the top row is <= the leftmost column of all robots in the same or lower rows. Wait, no.",

So the condition (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) is 1>0 \u2192 yes \u2192 output NO. But the robot at row 1 can move up to (0,0), which would be allowed. Thus, the condition would still give incorrect result. Hmm. This is really tricky. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. The correct condition must be that there exists a robot such that: \n\n- The robot's row is the topmost row (or lower). - The robot can move up to the top row (0). - The robot can move left to column 0. - The leftmost column among all robots in the top row is <= the robot's column.

Which is the opposite of what I just said.

The minimal way to do this is to first move all ups first, then lefts, or vice versa. Try both and see if either works. For example, for the robot (i,j) to reach (0,0):\n\n Option 1: move up i times first, then left j times. During the ups: \n\n After each up command, the robot moves up, and others move up if possible. The other robots must not move past row 0. For example, a robot in row 0 cannot move up. Thus, after moving up i times, the robot is in row 0. Then, moving left j times: all robots move left. The other robots' columns after each left must \u22650. Option 2: first move left j times, then up i times. During the left moves, all columns must decrease, but must remain \u22650. Then the ups must not move any robot past row 0. Thus, if either of these two paths works, then the answer is yes. We can test both paths for the robot and see if any is valid. Thus, the algorithm is: For each test case: \n\n For each robot (i,j): \n\n   Check path 1: move up i times then left j times. Check if during all steps of this path, all robots stay within bounds. If yes, return YES. Check path 2: move left j times then up i times. If yes, return YES. If any robot passes either path, return YES. Else, check if there's a robot already at (0,0). If none of the above, return NO. This seems promising.",

But given the time constraints, perhaps the correct condition is that there is a robot in row 0, and its column is the leftmost among all robots in row 0. Or the robot can move up and left without causing others to explode. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the initial code is nearly correct but needs to track the top row's leftmost column properly. The original code has a missing part in the first if clause (i < topMostRobot). The missing code should set topMostRobot = i, and then set topMostRobotCol to the current j, but also track the minimal j in that row. Thus, the code in the first if clause should be:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nThen, in the else clause (when i == topMostRobot), check if j < topMostRobotCol \u2192 then update topMostRobotCol. Thus, the code for the first if clause should be:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j; Then, in the remaining part of the loop:\n\nif(j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n}\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nif(currentRow.charAt(j)=='R'){\n\n   if (i < topMostRobot) { \n\n       // this is the first time we encounter a row less than current topMostRobot.\n\n       // So set topMostRobot to i.\n\n       topMostRobot = i;\n\n       // Also, the current j is the only R in this new top row so far, so set topMostRobotCol to j.\n\n       topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n   } else if (i == topMostRobot){\n\n       // now, this is in the current top row. // check if this j is smaller than current topMostRobotCol.\n\n       if(j < topMostRobotCol)\n\n           topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n   }\n\n   // and the code also has:\n\n   if(j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n       leftMostRobot = j;\n\n   }\n\nWait, perhaps the leftMostRobot variable is not needed. Maybe the condition should compare the leftmost of the top row with the overall leftmost. Thus, the code should track the overall leftmost among all robots.",

Because when you issue the left command: \n\n The robot at (0,1) moves to (0,0). All other robots in row 0 must have columns >=1 to avoid going out. For robots in other rows, they can move any direction as long as they don't go out. Thus, the condition for this scenario: \n\n\u5b58\u5728 robots in (0,1) \n\n\u6240\u6709 other robots in row 0 must have columns >=1. \n\n All other robots not in row 0 can be in any column. Thus, this can be checked. Similarly for the third condition: \n\n There is a robot in (1,0). All other robots in column 0 must be in rows >=1. Because when you issue an up command, the robot moves to (0,0). Other robots in column 0 must not be in row 0 (or they stay there). Thus, all other robots in column 0 must be in rows >=1. Or perhaps other conditions. This is getting too complicated. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to fill the missing code with the original TODO block. The code has in the first if block (i < topMostRobot): The missing code must set topMostRobot to i, and also track the leftmost column in that row. Thus, the missing code should be:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\n And then in the else if (i == topMostRobot)\u90e8\u5206\uff0c we need to update the topMostRobotCol if this j is smaller. Thus the complete code would be:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<numberOfRows; i++){\n\n    String currentRow = scan.next();\n\n    for(int j=0; j<currentRow.length(); j++){\n\n        if(currentRow.charAt(j)=='R'){\n\n            if(i < topMostRobot){\n\n                // This is the new top row. topMostRobot = i;\n\n                topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n            } else if (i == topMostRobot) {\n\n                if (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n                    topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            // Update leftMostRobot. if (j < leftMostRobot) {\n\n                leftMostRobot = j;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code in the first if block is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nThis would correctly track the top row's row and the leftmost column in that row. The leftMostRobot variable should be tracking the overall leftmost across all robots. Thus, the leftMostRobot should be updated whenever a robot's j is smaller than the current leftMostRobot. The code currently has:\n\nif(j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n    leftMostRobot = j;\n\n}\n\nThis is incorrect.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether any robot can reach the upper left corner (which is position (0,0) assuming rows and columns are 0-indexed) without any robot exploding. The key here is figuring out under what conditions this is possible.\n\nHmm, the code provided has some variables like leftMostRobot, topMostRobot, and topMostRobotCol. Wait, the initial code might have some errors here. Let me look again.\n\nThe original code's variables are initialized to 5, which is probably because the maximum n and m are 5. So maybe the idea is to track the topmost robot's row and the leftmost column among those robots in the topmost row?\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the loop over rows and columns, when a robot is found:\n\n- If the current row (i) is less than topMostRobot (since rows start at 0, lower i means higher up), then that's a new top row. So maybe they are updating topMostRobot here. But in the code's current state, the comment says \"TODO\" in the if statement for i < topMostRobot. The code inside that block is missing. Also, the code then checks if j < topMostRobotCol, and sets leftMostRobot to j. Wait, perhaps the variables are not properly named. Let me think again.\n\nThe variables:\n\nleftMostRobot is initialized to 5 (max possible is 4 since m can be up to 5). But maybe leftMostRobot is tracking the smallest column (i.e., the leftmost position) among all robots. But the code's logic may not be correct.\n\nThe code's current approach is probably trying to find the topmost row where any robot exists, and among those robots in that top row, find the leftmost column. If the leftmost column is not 0, then maybe it's impossible?\n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nif(i < topMostRobot) { /* missing code */ }\n\nAh right! The original code is incomplete here. The idea here is probably to update the topMostRobot variable when a robot is found in a row above the current top. So for the first part, when a robot's row is less than the current topMostRobot's row, then we need to set topMostRobot to i, and also track the leftmost column among those robots in that top row. Because the topmost row's leftmost robot's column determines if they can reach the upper left corner. \n\nWait, maybe the variables are supposed to be:\n\ntopMostRobot is the row number of the topmost row with a robot.\n\nThen, among all robots in that top row, the leftmost column (so topMostRobotCol might be the leftmost column in that top row). Because if any robot is in the top row, but their leftmost is at column 0, then that robot is already there. Otherwise, you can move left until they reach column 0, provided that in moving left, they don't go out of bounds. Wait, but when moving all robots at once, so if a robot is in the top row, to get to (0,0), it needs to be in that row and column 0. So the topmost row must be 0, and the leftmost in that row must be 0. Or, even if other robots are below, but the robots in top row can reach column 0 without any of them moving left beyond the grid.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the leftmost robot in the top row must be at column 0. Or wait, the problem requires at least one robot to reach the upper left corner. So if there's a robot in the top row (row 0) and can move left to column 0, then that's possible only if that robot is in column 0 already, or can move left until it gets there without others exploding. Wait, but when moving, all robots move at the same time. So for example, if a robot in (0,1) can move left to (0,0). That's okay. But if there is another robot in (0,2), then when moving left, all move left. The first would reach (0,0), which is okay. The second would go to (0,1), which is okay. So that's allowed. So in this case, the leftmost robot in the top row can reach (0,0) if their starting column is >=0, but they can move left. Wait, but if the leftmost robot in the top row is at column 1, then moving left once would get to column 0, so that's okay. So the problem is, can there be a direction of moves such that at least one robot reaches (0,0) without any robot stepping outside.\n\nWait, the key is that in order for a robot to reach the upper left corner (0,0), it must be possible to move all robots in such a way that one of them ends up there, and in all steps, no robot moves outside the grid.\n\nSo first, the robot that reaches (0,0) must be able to get there. Let's consider the robot's path. To reach (0,0):\n\nIts starting position (i,j) must satisfy that by moving up some steps and left some steps, but since moving all at once, perhaps the robot can be in a position where after certain commands, it moves into (0,0). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the only way a robot can reach (0,0) without exploding is if it can be moved there in such a way that no robot is pushed out.\n\nHmm, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that there exists at least one robot which is in a position where, in its current row, it can move left to column 0, and in its column, it can move up to row 0. But since all robots move at the same time, this requires that the robot's row is >=0 (obviously) and column >=0, but when moving, their path must not cause any robot to step outside. \n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: To get a robot to (0,0), we need to move all robots such that at some command steps, the robot moves to (0,0) without any of them going out. So for example, the robot's path must not require moving left beyond column 0. \n\nWait, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nThe uppermost row must be 0 (so that the robot can be in the top row, so that moving up isn't needed). Also, in that top row, the leftmost column of any robot must be 0. Wait, but even if there's a robot in row 0, column 1, then moving left once would bring it to 0,0. That would be okay. So the leftmost column in the top row must be <= the desired column? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the robot can reach (0,0) only if in its initial position, the row is <=0 (can't go up beyond) and column <=0 (can't go left beyond). Wait, that's impossible except if it's already there. Wait no, that can't be.\n\nWait, the robot can move up only if it is in a lower row. So to reach row 0, the robot must start in row 0 or higher (but moving up is towards row 0). Wait, rows: row 0 is the top. So moving up from row 0 would cause explosion. So any robot to reach (0,0) must start in row 0, or in a row below? No, if it's in row 1, then moving up once would bring it to row 0. But moving all robots at the same time. So if there's a robot in row 1, moving up would move it to row 0, which is okay. So the robot can be in a lower row. \n\nHmm, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the following approach:\n\nThe upper left corner is (0,0). For a robot to reach there, it must be possible to have it move there without any robot stepping out. \n\nThe key insight from the problem's note examples may help. Let me think about the first test case example:\n\nFirst test case: Suppose the robot is in (0,1). So moving left once brings it to (0,0) which is okay, so output yes.\n\nSecond example: Maybe robots are in positions where any move causes some to go out. \n\nThe third example: similar to first. \n\nFourth example: Robot already at (0,0).\n\nIn the fifth example, the robot might be at (2,0). So moving up twice would take it to row 0. But moving left isn't needed here. Wait, if it's already in column 0, then moving up can get to (0,0). So yes.\n\nThe sixth case: perhaps some robot's path requires moving left but another robot would go beyond, causing explosion.\n\nHmm, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nThe leftmost robot in the topmost row must be at column 0. Wait:\n\nWait the topmost row is the smallest row (row 0 if there's a robot there). Among the robots in that top row, the leftmost (smallest column) must be column 0. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the top row is 0 and the robot is at column 1. The leftmost is column 1. But the example says it can be done. So that contradicts that idea. \n\nWait in the first test case's example: the robot is in (0,1). The leftmost robot in the top row is 1. So according to that condition, it would be required to have leftmost column <=0, but here it's 1, so that can't be. But the example works. So that approach must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so the initial code's condition is:\n\nif(topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) then output NO. Else YES.\n\nWait perhaps the variables are named incorrectly. Let me see the code again:\n\nThe code has variables:\n\nleftMostRobot = 5 (starting value)\n\ntopMostRobot =5 (maybe the row number?)\n\ntopMostRobotCol=5.\n\nThen in the loops:\n\nfor each cell (i,j):\n\nif currentRow's j is 'R', then:\n\nif i < topMostRobot \u2192 then, this is a new top row. So need to update topMostRobot's value to i. Also, then, in this row, we need to track the leftmost column (the minimum j for this row). So maybe the code should set topMostRobotCol to the minimum j found in the top row.\n\nWait but in the code's current code, inside the first if (i < topMostRobot):\n\nthe missing code should probably be:\n\ntopMostRobot = i; \n\nand then, for the columns in this row, the leftmost among those robots here.\n\nWait, but in the code, after checking if i is smaller, then, for the columns, perhaps the code also needs to track the leftmost column among all robots in the top row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the leftmost column of the topmost row.\n\nWait, the code's variables may be:\n\n- topMostRobot is the row number (0-based) of the topmost robot.\n\n- topMostRobotCol is the leftmost column (smallest j) among all robots in the top row.\n\nWait, let me re-express.\n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor each row i from 0 to numberOfRows-1:\n\n   for each column j:\n\n      if it's an R:\n\n         if i is less than current topMostRobot (so, this is a new top row):\n\n              then, set topMostRobot to i.\n\n              and set topMostRobotCol to the current j (since this is the first R in this row, maybe?), but then we need to track the minimum j in this row.\n\n         else if i equals topMostRobot:\n\n             check if j is less than the current topMostRobotCol \u2192 if so, set the topMostRobotCol to j.\n\n         then, also, the leftMostRobot variable is being tracked as well, but perhaps it's a separate variable for all robots.\n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the code after the i < topMostRobot block (which is empty because of the TODO), there's an if (j < topMostRobotCol) { leftMostRobot = j; }\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the leftmost column of the topMostRobot's row. But the initial code is not properly tracking that. Because the code as written may not be properly setting topMostRobotCol.\n\nThe current code:\n\nInitially, topMostRobot is set to 5. So when the first R is found, say in row 0, then since 0 <5, it will enter the first if block. But the code there is missing. So the code needs to set topMostRobot to i (0). Then, for the topMostRobotCol, perhaps we need to track the minimum j in that row. So in that first R, the code would set topMostRobotCol to j (the current j). Then, for other Rs in the same row (i=0), if their j is smaller, then the code would set it again.\n\nWait, looking at the code's existing code:\n\nThe code has:\n\nif(currentRow.charAt(j)=='R') {\n\n   if (i < topMostRobot) { // then we found a new top row.\n\n      /* here, we need to set topMostRobot to i. Also, set the topMostRobotCol to the minimal j in this row. But how? Because this may be the first R in this row, but there could be others.\n\n      So, in this case, we set topMostRobot = i, and then, for the current j, set topMostRobotCol to j, but maybe need to keep track of the minimum.\n\n      So the code here should set topMostRobot = i, and set topMostRobotCol to 5 (the initial value?), but then, in the same iteration, the code will check the next condition.\n\n   }\n\n   if (j < topMostRobotCol) { // maybe this is for the top row's columns?\n\n      leftMostRobot = j;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nHmm, perhaps the variable 'leftMostRobot' is not the correct variable here. Because the variable leftMostRobot is the minimum column among all robots (not just the top row). But the output condition in the code is:\n\nif (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) \u2192 output NO else YES.\n\nWait, in the first example, where the robot is at (0,1), the leftMostRobot would be 1 (since it's the only robot). So topMostRobotCol would be 1 (since it's the only in the top row). So topMostRobotCol (1) is not greater than leftMostRobot (1) \u2192 so the condition is false, so output YES. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: suppose there's a robot in (0,2) and another in (0,1). Then, topMostRobot is 0, topMostRobotCol would be 1 (the min of 1 and 2). leftMostRobot would be 1. So the condition (1>1 \u2192 no \u2192 output yes.\n\nAnother test case where in the top row, the leftmost is column 1, but another robot is in (0,0) \u2192 then output is yes.\n\nWait but how does the code track this?\n\nWait in the code, the leftMostRobot variable is initialized to 5. Then, whenever j (current column) is less than the current topMostRobotCol (which is 5 initially?), then the code would set leftMostRobot to j. Wait, perhaps the code's approach is not correct here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's logic is to track the leftmost robot among all robots (leftMostRobot is the minimal column of any robot). The topMostRobot is the minimal row of any robot. The topMostRobotCol is the minimal column among all robots in the topmost row.\n\nThen, the condition is: if the leftmost column (leftMostRobot) is less than the leftmost column in the top row (topMostRobotCol), then output NO. Wait, no, the code currently has the condition if (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) then print NO else YES. \n\nWait, the condition is \"if the leftmost column of the top row is greater than the overall leftmost column of any robot\", that would mean that there exists a robot not in the top row which is further left than the leftmost in the top row. Which would mean that this robot is below the top row but to the left of the leftmost in the top row. In that case, moving up might require them to step into the top row, but perhaps that's impossible.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think of the condition.\n\nThe code's current output condition is:\n\nif (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) \u2192 print NO.\n\nElse \u2192 YES.\n\nIn other words, if the leftmost column of the top row is greater than the leftmost column of all robots, then output NO. Otherwise, YES.\n\nWait, that would mean that if there is any robot to the left of the leftmost in the top row, then it's a problem. Because that robot is in a lower row, so when moving up, that robot would move into the top row's row. But since they are in a column to the left of the top row's leftmost robot, which is the leftmost in their row, then when moving up, they might be moving into a column that is left of the current top row's robots' positions. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that for a robot to reach (0,0), it must be in the top row (row 0), and also able to move left to column 0. However, any robot in a lower row that is to the left of the top row's leftmost robot would prevent this. Because when you move left to get the top row's robot to 0, you might have to move the lower row robot upwards first, but moving up would take them into the top row's row. But if they are in a column to the left of the top row's leftmost robot, then when moving left, they might not interfere?\n\nHmm, maybe the condition is that the leftmost column of the top row is <= 0 (i.e., there's a robot in (0,0)), but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the leftmost column in the top row must be 0, so that at least one robot can reach the upper left corner by moving left. But in the first example, that's not the case, but it can be done. \n\nWait in the first test case, the robot is in (0,1). The top row is 0, so to reach (0,0) you can move left once. That works even though the leftmost in the top row is 1. So the condition must not be that. \n\nHmm. Maybe the correct approach is to consider that all robots in the top row must have their columns >= the desired column (0), but also, any robot not in the top row must be to the right of the leftmost in the top row. Because otherwise, when moving left to get the top row robots to 0, the lower robots might have to move up, but that would cause them to move into the top row. But perhaps their column is not left enough?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the leftmost robot in the top row must be able to reach column 0, and all other robots must be able to move in such a way that they don't get pushed out. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the problem's solution.\n\nThe problem requires that at least one robot can be moved to (0,0) through a sequence of commands, without any explosion. So:\n\nAt some point, after a series of moves, one robot is at (0,0). All moves must not cause any robot to step outside.\n\nLet's consider that for a robot to reach (0,0):\n\n- It must be in row 0 (since you can't move up from row 0 without exploding). So the robot must be in row 0 eventually. \n\nWait, but how does it get there? \n\nWait, to reach (0,0), the robot must be in row 0, so it can't have been in a row above (since moving up would cause explosion). So the robot must have been in row 0, or moved up from row 1 to row 0. But moving up from row 1 requires that in that move, the robot doesn't go beyond row 0, which it can do. \n\nWait, but other robots might be in lower rows. \n\nHmm, perhaps the only way is to have all robots that are in rows above the desired robot's path not cause explosions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following condition is necessary and sufficient:\n\nThe leftmost robot in the topmost row (the smallest row among all robots) has a column \u2264 0 (so 0). Because then you can move left to reach it. Wait but that's not the case in the first example where the robot is at (0,1). \n\nWait the first example's robot is at (0,1), so the top row is 0. The leftmost column there is 1. So the leftmost is 1. But in that case, moving left once gets it to 0, so that works. So the condition must not require that the leftmost column in the top row is 0. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that the leftmost column in the top row can be any column, but the robot itself must be able to move left to 0 without causing other robots to explode in that process. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that there exists a direction of moves where at least one robot ends up at (0,0), and for every move, no robot moves out.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to find whether there exists a robot in the first row (row 0), and also that the leftmost robot in the first row has a column \u2264 any robot's starting column in the first row. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of all robots:\n\nFor a robot to reach (0,0), it must start in a row that allows it to move up to row 0 (so any row \u22650, but to get there, you can move up only from rows below). \n\nBut the robot must be able to move left to column 0.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is that in the top row (the smallest row among all robots), the leftmost column in that row must be \u2264 0 ?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the key is:\n\nThe robots must be arranged such that there exists a direction sequence where one robot can reach (0,0), while all other robots' paths don't go out of bounds.\n\nLet me think of the first example again:\n\nRobot at (0,1). To get to (0,0), move left once. That's safe. \n\nSecond case: Suppose there's a robot at (0,0), then output is yes.\n\nThird case: R at (0,2), moving left twice would get to 0, but that's okay. \n\nFourth case: robot already there.\n\nNow, if there's a robot in (0,1) and another in (1,0). Let's see. \n\nThe top row is 0. The leftmost in the top row is 1. \n\nThe robot at (1,0) is in row 1, column 0. \n\nCan this robot reach (0,0)?\n\nTo do so, you have to move up to row 0. So send an \"up\" command. \n\nWhen you send \"up\", the first robot (in (0,1)) tries to move up to row -1 \u2192 explodes. So that's bad. So can't do that. \n\nSo the only way for the (1,0) robot to get to (0,0) is to move up, but that would cause the robot in (0,1) to explode. Hence, the answer is no.\n\nHmm, so in this scenario, even though the robot at (1,0) could move up to (0,0) if done in a way that the other robot isn't there. \n\nWait but all robots move at the same time. So when you send 'up' command, the (0,1) robot can't move up, so it explodes, so this move is invalid. Thus, the only way to have the (1,0) robot reach (0,0) would require that when moving up, the other robot is not there. \n\nBut that's impossible. \n\nSo in this case, it's impossible. \n\nThe problem requires that no robot explodes during any command. Thus, any command must not cause any robot to move outside. \n\nSo the only way to have the robot in (1,0) reach (0,0) is to somehow, in some sequence of moves, first move left? No, he's already in column 0. \n\nAlternatively, the robot must move up, but that requires that the top row's robot (0,1) is not there. But since they are moving at the same time, we can't get rid of that robot (unless it moves left first). \n\nIf we first move left once: the (0,1) robot moves to 0,0. The (1,0) moves left to (-1, 0) \u2192 which explodes. So that's bad. \n\nHmm, so in this case, it's impossible. \n\nNow, according to the code's condition:\n\nIn the scenario with two robots at (0,1) and (1,0):\n\nThe topMostRobot is row 0. \n\nThe leftmost robot in the top row is 1 (since the R is at column 1). \n\nThe leftMostRobot (the minimal column among all robots) is 0 (from the (1,0) robot). \n\nSo topMostRobotCol (1) > leftMostRobot (0). \n\nThe code's condition would print \"NO\", which is correct. \n\nIn the first example, the leftMostRobot is 1, so the code's condition (topMostRobotCol (1) > leftMostRobot (1) \u2192 1>1 \u2192 no \u2192 print YES. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: robots at (0,0) \u2192 topMostRobotCol is 0. leftMostRobot is 0 \u2192 so condition is 0>0 \u2192 no \u2192 print yes.\n\nAnother test case where robot is at (1,0):\n\nThe top row is 1 (since there's no robot in row 0). So topMostRobot is 1. So to reach (0,0), the robot is in row 1, so can move up once. That would take it to row 0, column 0 \u2192 which is okay. So the commands would be \"up\". \n\nSo the code's variables:\n\nThe topMostRobot is 1 (the robot is in row 1). The leftMostRobot is 0 (since that's the column). The topMostRobotCol would be 0 (since the robot in the top row (row 1) is at column 0 \u2192 the minimal column in that row is 0. \n\nSo the condition is (topMostRobotCol (0) > leftMostRobot (0 \u2192 no \u2192 print YES. Which is correct. \n\nBut what if the robot is at row 2, column 0. Then top row is 2, so to get to row 0, you need to move up twice. Each time, moving up is allowed. So sending \"up\" twice. \n\nSo that would be okay. So the code's condition would be:\n\ntopMostRobotCol is 0. leftMostRobot 0 \u2192 so condition is okay \u2192 output yes. \n\nWhat if the robot is at (0,2) and (1,0):\n\nThe top row is 0, leftmost in top row is 2. \n\nleftMostRobot is 0 (from row 1's robot). So topMostRobotCol (2) > leftMostRobot (0 \u2192 yes, so condition is true \u2192 print NO. Which is correct, because the robot at (1,0) can't reach (0,0) without exploding. For example, to move the (1,0) robot, you have to move up, but then the (0,2) robot can move left, but when you move up, the (1,0) is okay (moves to 0,0). The robot at (0,2) would move up (no, moving up from row 0 is impossible). Wait, when sending \"up\" command:\n\nThe robot in row 1, column 0: moves up to row 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe robot in row 0, column 2 stays in row 0 (can't move up), so the move is allowed. \n\nThen, after that move, the robot is now at (0,0) \u2192 so it's okay! \n\nWait, what's happening here?\n\nSo in this case, the robot in (1,0) can move up to (0,0), while the other robot in (0,2) stays there. \n\nSo the command sequence is: send \"up\". \n\nSo that's allowed. \n\nThen the code's condition would have topMostRobotCol =2 (leftmost in row 0 is 2?), but the leftMostRobot is 0 (since there's a robot in column 0 in row 1. \n\nWait, the leftMostRobot is the minimum column among all robots, which includes the robot in row 1, column 0. So the leftMostRobot is 0. \n\nThe topMostRobot is row 0. The leftmost column in the top row is 2. \n\nSo the condition is 2>0 \u2192 yes \u2192 the code would output NO. But in reality, it's possible. \n\nSo this would be a problem. \n\nHmm, the code would give a wrong answer here. \n\nWait let me walk through that example:\n\nTest case where two robots: (0,2) and (1,0). \n\nThe desired condition is that you can send an \"up\" command. \n\nWhen you do that:\n\n- The robot at (1,0) moves up to (0,0) \u2192 good. \n\n- The robot at (0,2) is in row 0, so can't move up \u2192 stays there. \n\nNo explosions, and the robot reached (0,0). So the answer should be YES. \n\nBut according to the code's condition:\n\ntopMostRobotCol (the leftmost in row 0 is 2 (since that's the only robot there), so topMostRobotCol is 2. \n\nleftMostRobot (overall) is 0 (from row 1). \n\nSo the code's condition is 2>0 \u2192 YES \u2192 so output is NO. But correct answer is YES. \n\nThus the code's logic is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the initial approach in the code is incorrect, so the TODO part must be corrected. \n\nHmm, so the current approach must be wrong. So the missing code can't just be the code that sets topMostRobot and topMostRobotCol. \n\nWhat is the correct condition?\n\nLet me think of the example I just considered:\n\nThe code's condition would wrongly output NO, but the correct answer is YES. \n\nSo the condition must be different. \n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe problem requires that there exists at least one robot which can reach (0,0) without any explosion. \n\nTo reach (0,0), the robot must be able to move in such a way that:\n\n- It can be moved to (0,0) via a series of commands, and in all steps, no robot moves outside.\n\nThe key point is that for any robot to reach (0,0):\n\nIt must be in row 0, and column 0. \n\nTo be in row 0, it must have been in row 0 or moved up from below. \n\nBut when moving up, the robot in row 1 can move to row 0, but all other robots must not move outside. \n\nHowever, the problem allows multiple steps. So perhaps the sequence of commands must be chosen such that:\n\nFor the robot to reach (0,0):\n\n- The robot must be in column 0 (or can reach it by moving left), and in row 0 (or can move up to row 0).\n\nBut all other robots must not have any step that causes them to move outside. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternative: think of all possible robots and their positions. For each robot, check if there exists a path that gets it to (0,0) without any other robot being pushed out. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently given the small constraints (n and m up to 5).\n\nMaybe we can model the conditions as follows:\n\nFor a robot at (i,j) to reach (0,0), it must satisfy that:\n\n- The robot can move left to column 0 (so j >=0 \u2192 which it is, but not sure). \n\nWait, the robot can move left any number of times, but must end up at column 0, and in row 0. \n\nWait, the robot can reach (0,0) only if:\n\n- Its row is >=0 (obviously, it is).\n\n- The row of the robot can be reduced to 0 via moving up. \n\nBut moving up requires that for each step where it moves up, it doesn't go below row 0. \n\nThe robot must be able to move up (i times) to get to row 0. \n\nMeanwhile, during the moves, all other robots must not move into negative rows or etc. \n\nBut since all robots move at the same time, the commands must be chosen such that for all steps, no robot is pushed out. \n\nThe key insight might be that:\n\nThe robot can reach (0,0) only if:\n\n- The robot is already in row 0, and column 0 \u2192 then yes.\n\nElse:\n\n- The robot must be able to move up to row 0 (i.e., it can be in some row below, but must be moved up without causing any explosion. \n\nWait, maybe the following conditions must be met:\n\nThe robot must be able to get to (0,0) in some move sequence, and for all other robots, their paths do not require any move that would cause them to go out of bounds. \n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe minimal requirements for a robot to reach (0,0) are:\n\n- It must be possible for it to move to (0,0) through some sequence of commands, while all other robots' positions are such that they don't move out of bounds in any step.\n\nSo for the robot (x,y):\n\nIt can only reach (0,0) if:\n\n- It can move left to column 0 (y >=0 \u2192 always true). \n\nWait, but moving left from y to 0 requires that during the move steps, the robot doesn't move outside. \n\nWait, to move left, the robot must be in a column >= 1. \n\nSo to move to column 0, it starts at column y >=0 \u2192 but must have y \u22651? No, if it's already at 0, then no move needed. \n\nWait, the robot's path to column 0 must have it not moving left beyond. \n\nLet me think of all robots' positions. \n\nThe necessary and sufficient condition is: \n\nThere exists at least one robot such that:\n\n1. The robot can reach (0,0) through a series of moves where all commands are chosen such that during each move:\n\n   a. The robot itself can reach (0,0) eventually.\n\n   b. No robot moves outside the grid in any of the steps. \n\nBut how to find such a condition.\n\nPerhaps the following conditions must be met for some robot (i,j):\n\n- The robot can reach row 0 by moving up (i.e., its current row is >=0 \u2192 it is). \n\nSo row can be reduced to 0 by moving up steps. \n\n- The robot can reach column 0 by moving left (i.e., its column is >=0 \u2192 but it must be possible to move left to 0. i.e., current column >=0 \u2192 which it is). \n\nWait, but the robot's column must be >=0, which it is. \n\nBut the problem is that other robots may block the path.\n\nAlternatively, the following condition is necessary:\n\nThe robot (i,j) must have:\n\ni <=0 \u2192 no, since it can be in lower rows. \n\nWait, perhaps the robot can reach row 0, and the path to row 0 must not require other robots to move beyond their bounds. \n\nThis seems too involved. \n\nAlternative Idea inspired by the code's condition:\n\nThe code's condition is based on the top most robot's leftmost column and the overall leftmost robot. \n\nIn the previous example where the code failed:\n\nWe had a robot at (0,2) (top row 0, leftmost in top row is 2), and another robot at (1,0) (leftMostRobot is 0). \n\nThe code would output NO, but the correct answer is YES. \n\nIn this case, the robot at (1,0) can be moved up to (0,0) by issuing an 'up' command. \n\nIn that move, the other robot (0,2) is already in the top row and can't move up, so stays there. No explosions. \n\nSo the problem arises because the code considers the leftmost robot (0) which is below the top row. \n\nThe code's condition is that the leftmost robot (the overall leftmost) is not to the left of the leftmost in the top row. \n\nBecause in this case, the leftmost robot is (1,0) which is to the left of the top row's leftmost (2). \n\nThe condition (topMostRobotCol (2) > leftMostRobot (0) ) \u2192 2>0 \u2192 yes \u2192 output NO \u2192 which is wrong. \n\nThus, the condition is incorrect. \n\nSo what's the correct condition?\n\nPerhaps the condition must be that the leftmost column in the top row must be <=0 (i.e., there is a robot in column 0 of the top row). \n\nBut in the first example (0,1), that's not the case, but the answer is yes. \n\nSo that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the leftmost in the top row's column must be equal to 0?\n\nBut first example's leftmost is 1 but answer is yes. \n\nHmm, so maybe the correct condition is that the leftmost robot in the top row has column <= the desired column (0). \n\nWait no, because the robot can move left to 0. \n\nWait, the robot must be able to move left to column 0. So for any robot in the top row (row 0), then the column must be >=0 (which it is). So to move left to 0, the robot must be in column >=0 \u2192 which it is. But the move is allowed as long as they don't go beyond. \n\nSo the problem is not about the robot's starting column. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that there exists a robot in row 0, and its column is <= any other robot's column in row 0. \n\nWait, no, but in the first example, the robot is in (0,1). \n\nThe key is: For the robot to move left to (0,0), it must not cause any other robot in the same row to move left beyond that. \n\nWait, when you issue a left command, all robots move left. So if there is a robot in (0,0), then moving left would make it go to -1 \u2192 explode. \n\nWait, no. The robot in (0,0) would try to move left to column -1 \u2192 which is outside, so it explodes. \n\nThus, the command 'left' can only be issued if all robots are in columns >=1, so that when moving left, they don't go beyond. \n\nThus, the first example's robot is at (0,1). To reach (0,0), you can issue a left command. After that, the robot is at (0,0), and no other robots are present (assuming only one robot), so this is allowed. \n\nThus, the command is valid. \n\nSo the condition is that there exists a command sequence where at least one robot reaches (0,0) and no robot steps outside in any command. \n\nThe way to model this is that for some robot, there exists a command sequence such that:\n\n- After executing the sequence, that robot is at (0,0). \n\n- The sequence consists of commands that ensure all moves are valid (no explosions during any step). \n\nThis seems hard to compute directly for each test case, but given that n and m are small (up to 5), perhaps we can model it.\n\nAnother approach: For a robot to be able to reach (0,0):\n\nIt must be possible to have it move up to row 0 (if not already there), and move left to column 0 (if not already there), and during this process, no other robot is forced to move outside. \n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the robot's path to (0,0) involves moving up and left. \n\nFor example, if the robot is at (2,3):\n\nIt can move up twice to get to row 0, and left three times to get to column 0. \n\nBut during these steps, the commands could be issued in any order, but all must ensure no robot steps out. \n\nThe key is that for the robot to move up to row 0, it must be possible to do so without forcing any robot below to move up into a negative row. \n\nWait\uff0c but when you issue an 'up' command, all robots attempt to move up. So any robot in row 0 will not move. \n\nThus, during the process:\n\nTo move a robot from row 2 to row 0, you need to issue two 'up' commands. \n\nBut in the first 'up' command, the robot moves to row 1. \n\nIn the second, to row 0. \n\nOther robots must not be in row 0 in between? \n\nNo, other robots can be in row 0. \n\nBut any robot in row 0 will stay there. \n\nThus, moving up is allowed as long as the robot is in row >=1. \n\nThe problem is that other robots may be in lower rows. \n\nFor example, if there is a robot in row 1 and column 0. \n\nIf you issue 'up' command:\n\nThe robot in row 1 moves to row 0 \u2192 fine. \n\nThe robot in row 0 stays. \n\nThus that's okay. \n\nThus, the main issue is whether there is any robot that can reach (0,0) while the other robots' paths don't require them to move into negative columns or rows. \n\nThe critical condition may be that for the desired robot to reach (0,0), there exists a path where all other robots do not have to move into forbidden areas. \n\nThis is complex. \n\nAlternative idea inspired by the notes:\n\nThe note says in the fifth example: sequence \"move up, move left, move up\" leads one robot to the upper left. \n\nLet me see: the robot\u2019s path:\n\nAssume initial position was (2,1). \n\nMove up: to (1,1).\n\nMove left: to (1,0).\n\nMove up: to (0,0). \n\nSo after each command, no robot explodes. \n\nThus, the condition must be that the robot can reach (0,0) by a path of moves, and during each command in the path, no robot moves out. \n\nThe problem is to find whether any such path exists. \n\nPerhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nFor some robot (i,j):\n\n- It can reach row 0 by moving up (i.e., i >=0 \u2192 it is).\n\n- It can reach column 0 by moving left (j >=0 \u2192 it is).\n\n- The path from (i,j) to (0,0) requires that for all moves to the left, the robot\u2019s current column is >=1, and similarly for other directions. \n\nBut this is still vague. \n\nPerhaps the key is that all robots must be able to be moved in such a way that the desired robot gets to (0,0), while all other robots are moved in a way that they don't go out. \n\nAn alternative approach inspired by the sample's first case:\n\nThe code's condition is that the leftmost in the top row must be <= the leftmost overall. \n\nBut in the previous example where the code failed, the top row's leftmost is 2, and the leftmost overall is 0. \n\nSo the condition (2>0) \u2192 code outputs NO. But the correct answer is YES. \n\nSo this indicates that the code's current condition is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the leftmost in the top row must be <= the column of any robot below it. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nThe upper left corner is (0,0). \n\nFor the robot to reach there, it must be possible to move all robots such that one reaches (0,0), and no robot steps out. \n\nThe robot must be able to reach (0,0) by moving left and/or up. \n\nThe critical point is that any robot not in the top row must not be to the left of the top row's leftmost robot. \n\nBecause if there is a robot below the top row and to the left of the leftmost in the top row, then when moving left to get the top robot to (0,0), that lower robot would have to move left as well, possibly causing it to go out. \n\nWait, let's see the previous example where robot is at (0,2) and (1,0):\n\nThe robot (1,0) is below the top row (0) and to the left of the top row's leftmost (2). \n\nWhen issuing the 'up' command to move it to (0,0), the other robot is at (0,2) doesn't move up, but the robot at (1,0) moves up. \n\nThis is allowed. \n\nBut the problem in this case is that the robot can reach (0,0), so the condition must allow this. \n\nSo the presence of the lower-row robot to the left of the top-most's leftmost is okay. \n\nThus, the initial condition is not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the leftmost column among all robots in the top row is <=0. \n\nBut in the first example, it's 1, and the answer is yes. \n\nSo that\u2019s not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe robot must be able to reach (0,0) by issuing commands that move all robots in such a way that their paths stay within bounds. \n\nFor this to be possible, the following must hold for at least one robot:\n\nThe robot's row is such that it can move up to row 0 (i.e., row is \u22650 \u2192 always true).\n\nThe robot's column is such that it can move left to column 0. So it's column is \u22650 \u2192 which it is. \n\nBut also, during the process, no other robot is pushed out. \n\nThe critical thing is that all other robots must not be forced to move into invalid positions when the commands are executed. \n\nThus, the necessary conditions for a robot (i,j) to be able to reach (0,0) is that:\n\nFor all robots (x,y):\n\nIf they are in a row above the desired robot's path, then their movement won't cause them to explode. \n\nThis is too vague. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to track whether there exists a robot that is in a position such that:\n\nThe leftmost column of all robots in the top row is \u2264 the leftmost column of all robots. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the following condition:\n\nThe robot that is in the top row and the leftmost of that top row must have a column <=0? But no.\n\nAlternatively, the following:\n\nThe leftmost column among all robots must be <= the leftmost column in the top row. \n\nBecause that means that all robots to the left of the top row's leftmost are in rows below. \n\nSo when moving left to get the top row's leftmost to 0, the others can move left without going beyond. \n\nWait, maybe the condition is:\n\nleftMostRobot (the overall leftmost) is <= the leftmost column in the top row. \n\nThen, the robot in the leftmost column of the top row can move left to 0 only if their column allows that.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the correct condition is that the leftmost column among all robots must be <= the column of any robot in the top row. \n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. \n\nMaybe it's better to think of the problem as follows:\n\nFor a robot to reach (0,0), it must be in row 0 eventually. So it can be in row 0 already or moved there. \n\nIf it\u2019s in row 0 already: then it can move left to 0. But must not be blocked by other robots in row 0 to the left. \n\nAlternatively, the robot's column must be >= the desired column (0), and there must be no robot to the left of it in the same row. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, when you decide to move left, all robots in the same row must have columns >=1 to not explode. \n\nThus, the presence of a robot in (0,0) is already sufficient. \n\nOtherwise, to move some robot in row 0 to column 0 via left command: all other robots in row 0 must have columns >=1. \n\nThus, the robot that is to be moved left must be in row 0, and its column must be >=0, and there's no other robot to the left of it in row 0. \n\n Thus, the condition for a robot in row 0 to reach (0,0) is that it's the leftmost in its row. \n\nIf there exists any robot in row 0 with column 0 \u2192 yes. \n\nOtherwise, there must be a robot in row 0 whose column is the leftmost among that row, and that column is 0's column? No. \n\nAlternatively, if the leftmost robot in the top row (which could be row 0) has a column <=0 \u2192 but they can't have a column less than 0. \n\nThus, the leftmost robot in the top row's column must be 0. Or, the column must be such that it can be moved left to 0. \n\nWait, the leftmost robot's column is the smallest column in the top row. For example, if the top row has robots in columns 1 and 2. the leftmost is 1. \n\nThen, to move this leftmost robot to column 0, you need to issue a left command. But that would move it to 0, and other robots in the same row would also move left, so the robot at 2 would move to 1. \n\nThis is allowed. \n\nThus, the robot can reach 0,0. \n\nThus, the condition is that there exists a robot in the top row (the smallest row), whose column is >=0, and the leftmost robot in the top row has column \u2264 the desired column (0). \n\nNo, the leftmost robot's column must be the smallest\uff0c so to reach 0, that robot must be able to move left to 0. \n\nThe leftmost robot in the top row has column, say, c. \n\nThen, to reach 0, you need to move left (c) times. \n\nBut during those steps, all other robots in the top row must have columns >= their current column minus the steps taken. \n\nWait, but each left command reduces all columns by 1. \n\nSo for example, if the leftmost robot in the top row is at column c, then after c left commands, it reaches 0. \n\nBut during those commands, other robots in the same row must have their columns >=1 in the first step, >=2 in the second, etc. \n\nThus, for all robots in the top row, their column must be \u2265 their initial column minus the number of left commands they undergo (which is the desired steps). \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the minimal condition is that the leftmost robot in the top row has a column \u22640 \u2192 which is only possible if it\u2019s already there. \n\nBut in the first example, it wasn't, but it was possible. \n\nSo this approach is not working. \n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe code's condition is almost correct but missing a case when there is a robot below the top row that can reach (0,0). \n\nFor example, the robot at (1,0) in the example I described earlier is below the top row (row 0) but can be moved up to row 0, then the command's result is okay. \n\nThus, the code's condition is missing those cases where a robot in a lower row can move up to the top row, reach (0,0), and other robots' paths are okay. \n\nSo the problem with the code's current condition is that it doesn't consider the possibility of moving robots from lower rows into the top row. \n\nThus, the code's current approach only considers the top row robots. \n\nTherefore, the initial approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe robot must be able to reach (0,0) by:\n\n- There exists a robot that can reach row 0 and column 0 through some commands. \n\nTo reach row 0 from a lower row, the robot must be able to move up without causing any explosion during the move. \n\nFor example, if a robot is in row 2, column 0. then moving up twice would reach (0,0). \n\nThus, the robot can move up twice. \n\nDuring each move up command:\n\n- The robot moves up one row each time. \n\n- All other robots must not move out of bounds during these commands. \n\nThe first move up command: \n\nThe robot in row 2 moves to 1. \n\nOther robots must not move up beyond their current rows. \n\nIf another robot is in row 0, then it stays. \n\nThus, this is okay. \n\nThe second move up: the robot moves to row 0, column 0 \u2192 which is allowed. \n\nThus, this is valid. \n\nThus, the code's current condition does not account for this scenario. \n\nSo the code's approach is not correct. \n\nThus, perhaps the initial approach is completely wrong and needs to be rethought. \n\nAlternative Idea inspired by the problem's note examples:\n\nThe problem's fourth example says that if there is a robot in (0,0), then yes. \n\nThe first example's robot is in (0,1), and the answer is yes. \n\nThe second example has all robots such that any command causes explosion. \n\nThe third example is similar to first. \n\nThe fifth example has a robot in row 2, column 0, which can reach (0,0) by moving up twice. \n\nThus, the condition must allow robots in lower rows to move up to row 0. \n\nThus, the correct condition must consider whether any robot is in a position where:\n\n- It can move up to row 0 (i.e., it's row is greater than or equal to 0, which it is, but the key is that to move up, it can't be in row 0 already but moving up would cause explosion. \n\nTo move up to row 0, the robot must be in row 1 or lower (row 0 can't move up). \n\nWait, the robot must be able to move up from lower rows to row 0. \n\nThe problem is that other robots in the same column or other columns must not be moved out of bounds during the commands. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that there exists a robot where: \n\n1. The robot can reach row 0 (either already there or can move up from below). \n\n2. The robot can reach column 0 (either already there or can move left from the right). \n\n3. All other robots, when the commands are issued to move this robot to (0,0), do not move out of bounds during any of the steps. \n\nThe question is, how to model this efficiently. \n\nGiven that the field is small (n and m up to 5), perhaps we can iterate over all robots and see if any of them can reach (0,0) without causing any explosion. \n\nFor each robot (x,y):\n\nCheck whether there exists a sequence of commands that moves this robot to (0,0) without any explosion. \n\nTo do this, we can model the possible paths for this robot and check whether all other robots' movements during those commands are within the grid. \n\nBut how to do this efficiently. \n\n~ approach:\n\nFor each robot (i,j):\n\nWe need to see if there is a path of commands that moves it to (0,0), and all other robots' moves during those commands are safe. \n\nThe commands can be any sequence of directions. \n\nThe minimal steps required for this robot would be to move up (i) times to reach row 0, and left j times to reach column 0. \n\nBut the order of moves can vary. \n\nFor example, moving left first and then up, or any combination. \n\nBut the key is that during the execution of these commands, all other robots must not move outside. \n\n Thus, the path for the robot can be any sequence of commands that results in it being at (0,0), and for all commands in this sequence, all robots' movements are within the field. \n\n This seems computationally intensive, but given the small constraints, perhaps it's feasible. \n\nPerhaps for each test case:\n\n1. Iterate over all robots. \n\n2. For each robot (i,j): \n\n   a. Determine the required movements to reach (0,0). \n\n   b. Find a sequence of commands that will move this robot to (0,0) without causing any explosion. \n\n   c. If any such sequence exists, return YES. \n\n   d. If none of the robots can do this, return NO. \n\nTo find such a sequence:\n\nThe sequence of commands must meet the following:\n\n- The robot's final position after all commands is (0,0). \n\n- Every command in the sequence must not cause any robot to move outside the grid. \n\nThe commands can be any sequence of directions, but the final position must be (0,0) for the robot. \n\nPerhaps the minimal way to reach (0,0) is to move up i times and left j times in any order. \n\nBut the order matters. \n\nFor example, a robot in (2,3) must move up twice and left three times. \n\nThe order could be all ups first then lefts. \n\nOr any permutation. \n\nThus, we can try the following approach for a given robot (i,j):\n\nThe required steps are to move up i times (if the robot is in row i), and left j times to reach (0,0). \n\nThe sequence of commands must include 'up' exactly i times and 'left' exactly j times. \n\nThe order can be any permutation. \n\nBut for each step in the sequence (each command), we must ensure that no robot is pushed out of the grid. \n\nThus, for each possible permutation of the required moves, we can simulate the steps and check if all moves are safe. \n\nHowever, this could be time-consuming, but with n and m up to 5, the maximum i is 4, j is 4 \u2192 the total steps per sequence is up to 8, and the number of permutations is (i+j)!/(i!j!) which is reasonable for small numbers. \n\nAlternatively, we can find a valid sequence of commands that achieves the desired result without causing any explosions. \n\nFor example, for the robot at (i,j):\n\n- First move all required lefts, then ups. \n\n- Or first move ups, then lefts. \n\n- Or some combination. \n\nWe can try both approaches and see if any of them works. \n\nAlternatively, the following conditions must be met for the robot to reach (0,0):\n\n1. It can move up to row 0 (i.e., i <= n-1 \u2192 always true). \n\n2. It can move left to column 0 (j <= m-1 \u2192 true). \n\n3. During the process of moving up and left, no other robot is moved out of bounds. \n\nThe third condition is tricky. \n\nPerhaps the following approach:\n\nThe robot must be able to move to (0,0) without any other robots being pushed out during the required commands. \n\nThus, for the robot's path, the commands must be chosen such that for every step, all other robots are within the grid. \n\nThus, the steps for the required commands can be represented as: \n\nThe required steps are to move up \u0394x times (where \u0394x = i) and move left \u0394y times (j). \n\nThese steps can be done in any order. \n\nFor each direction in the sequence of commands, we must ensure that every robot, after the move, remains in the grid. \n\nThus, for each other robot (x', y'), their new position after each command must be within the grid. \n\nThe problem can be viewed as whether there is any sequence of up/down/left/right commands that results in the target robot reaching (0,0) and no other robot leaving the grid in any step. \n\nBut since all commands are applied to all robots, the steps must be such that all robots' paths are within the grid. \n\nThis sounds computationally intensive, but perhaps for small n and m, it's feasible. \n\nHowever, given that the code is supposed to be completed in Java, perhaps there is a smarter condition that can be derived. \n\nLet me think of the example where robot is at (1,0):\n\nThe robot can move up once to reach (0,0). \n\nDuring this move, other robots must not be pushed out. \n\nFor example, a robot in row 0, column 2 will stay in place (can't move up). So the move is allowed. \n\nThus, the condition is met. \n\nSo the code's condition is not considering this case. \n\nThe initial code's condition is based on the leftmost in the top row vs the overall leftmost. \n\nThus, perhaps the correct condition is that the leftmost column of the top row is <= the leftmost column of all robots in the same or lower rows. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the correct condition is that the leftmost column of all robots is less than or equal to the leftmost column of the top row. \n\nWait, no, in the example where the robot is at (1,0) and the other at (0,2), the overall leftmost is 0 (the column of the (1,0) robot). The top row's leftmost is 2. \n\n0 \u2264 2 \u2192 the condition would be (topMostRobotCol (2) >= leftMostRobot (0)), so the code's condition would have topMostRobotCol (2) > leftMostRobot (0) \u2192 2>0 \u2192 yes \u2192 output NO. \n\nWhich is wrong. \n\nSo this approach is not working. \n\nAnother Idea: \n\nThe upper left corner is (0,0). For any robot to reach there, it must be able to move into that spot, and during the process, other robots must not be pushed out. \n\nThe key is that the robot must be able to move into (0,0) without any other robot moving into a position that would explode them during any of the steps. \n\nThe minimal condition for a robot (i,j) to reach (0,0) is: \n\n- Its row is >=0, and column >=0. \n\n- It must have a path where when moving to (0,0), all other robots don't move outside. \n\n But how to determine this? \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that there exists a robot such that: \n\n- The robot is in row 0, and can move left to column 0. \n\nOR \n\n- The robot is in column 0, and can move up to row 0. \n\nOR \n\n- The robot is in a position where it can move both up and left to reach (0,0). \n\n And in all cases, during these moves, no other robot is pushed out. \n\nBut this is still vague. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that all robots are in positions such that their column is >= the column of the leftmost robot in the top row. \n\n For example:\n\n~ The top row is the smallest row among all robots. \n\n~ The leftmost robot in the top row is at column c. \n\n~ All other robots in the top row must be to the right or same column. \n\n~ Any robot below the top row must be in columns >=c. \n\nThis way, when moving left to get the top row robots to column 0, the other robots can also move left without going out. \n\nThus, the condition would be: \n\n* The leftmost column among all robots in the top row must be the leftmost column overall. \n\nThat is, the leftmost column of the top row's robots is the smallest among all robots. \n\n Thus, the leftMostRobot is the leftmost of the top row. \n\n Thus, the condition would be: \n\nThe leftMostRobot == the leftmost column of the top row. \n\n Then, the code's condition would be that the topMostRobotCol (the leftmost of the top row) is less than or equal to the overall leftMostRobot. \n\n But this would require the leftMostRobot is the same as the top row's leftmost. \n\n Thus, the condition (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) would be false only when the leftmost of the top row is the leftmost of all. \n\n In this case, it's possible to move all to the left. \n\n For example: \n\n If there is a robot in row 1, column 0 (leftMostRobot is 0), and the top row has a robot at row 0, column 1. \n\n The top row's leftmost is 1. \n\n Thus, the leftMostRobot (0) is less than the top row's leftmost. So the condition (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) is 1>0 \u2192 yes \u2192 output NO. \n\n But the robot at row 1 can move up to (0,0), which would be allowed. \n\n Thus, the condition would still give incorrect result. \n\nHmm. This is really tricky. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nThe correct condition must be that there exists a robot such that: \n\n- The robot's row is the topmost row (or lower). \n\n- The robot can move up to the top row (0). \n\n- The robot can move left to column 0. \n\n- The leftmost column among all robots in the top row is <= the robot's column. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the following approach inspired by the problem's note examples:\n\nThe key is that the leftmost robot in the top row must be able to move left to column 0 without any other robot below being to the left of it. \n\nThus, the condition is: \n\nThe leftmost column of the top row must be the leftmost among all robots. \n\nThus, the leftMostRobot is the leftmost in the top row. \n\n Thus, the condition is that the leftmost of all robots is the same as the leftmost of the top row. \n\nIn this case, the code's current condition is checking whether the top row's leftmost is greater than the overall leftmost. \n\nThe code outputs YES only if topMostRobotCol <= leftMostRobot. \n\n Wait, the code's condition is: \n\nif (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) \u2192 output NO else YES. \n\n Which is the opposite of what I just said. \n\nWait, if the leftMostRobot (the overall leftmost) is the same as the top row's leftmost, then topMostRobotCol == leftMostRobot \u2192 so the condition is false \u2192 YES. \n\n Which is correct. \n\nIn the example with robot at (1,0) and another at (0,2), the leftMostRobot is 0 (from row 1), so the top row's leftmost is 2. \n\nThus, the condition is 2>0 \u2192 YES \u2192 output NO. Which is wrong. \n\n Thus this approach also doesn't work. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the leftmost column among all robots is the same as the leftmost column in the top row. \n\n In that case, the code would output YES. \n\n But in the example where the top row's leftmost is 2 and the overall leftmost is 0, it would output NO, which is correct. \n\n But in the scenario where the robot at (1,0) can move up to (0,0), the top row's leftmost is 2, and the overall leftmost is 0, the condition is not met. \n\nThus the code would output NO, but the correct answer is YES. \n\nThis suggests that the condition must include cases where the leftmost is in a lower row. \n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect and I need to find another way. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that there exists a robot in row 0 (top row) whose column is 0, or can reach there via left moves without any other robot in the row being to the left. \n\n Or the robot can be in a lower row and move up to the top row's column 0. \n\n This is getting too vague. \n\n Perhaps the correct condition is whether there's any robot that can reach (0,0) by moving left and/or up, and during this process, the other robots don't explode. \n\n The following steps can be taken: \n\n For a robot (i,j) to reach (0,0):\n\n The required moves are to move up i times and left j times. \n\n We need to choose a sequence of commands (each command is up, down, left, or right), but to reach the target, the number of ups must be i, lefts j. \n\n But the order must be such that: \n\n For every command step: \n\n All robots must not move outside the field. \n\n Thus, for all robots (x,y):\n\n After applying all previous commands plus the current command, their new position must be within bounds. \n\n Thus, we can model this as follows: \n\n For each robot (i,j), check if there exists a sequence of commands that includes exactly i ups and j lefts (in any order) such that for every command in the sequence, all robots are within bounds after the command. \n\n The minimal way to do this is to first move all ups first, then lefts, or vice versa. \n\n Try both and see if either works. \n\n For example, for the robot (i,j) to reach (0,0):\n\n Option 1: move up i times first, then left j times. \n\n During the ups: \n\n After each up command, the robot moves up, and others move up if possible. \n\n The other robots must not move past row 0. \n\n For example, a robot in row 0 cannot move up. \n\n Thus, after moving up i times, the robot is in row 0. \n\n Then, moving left j times: all robots move left. \n\n The other robots' columns after each left must \u22650. \n\n Option 2: first move left j times, then up i times. \n\n During the left moves, all columns must decrease, but must remain \u22650. \n\n Then the ups must not move any robot past row 0. \n\n Thus, if either of these two paths works, then the answer is yes. \n\n We can test both paths for the robot and see if any is valid. \n\n Thus, the algorithm is: \n\n For each test case: \n\n For each robot (i,j): \n\n   Check path 1: move up i times then left j times. \n\n   Check if during all steps of this path, all robots stay within bounds. \n\n   If yes, return YES. \n\n   Check path 2: move left j times then up i times. \n\n   If yes, return YES. \n\n If any robot passes either path, return YES. \n\n Else, check if there's a robot already at (0,0). \n\n If none of the above, return NO. \n\n This seems promising. \n\n Thus, the code needs to implement this logic. \n\n But given the time constraints, perhaps the correct condition is that there is a robot in row 0, and its column is the leftmost among all robots in row 0. \n\n Or the robot can move up and left without causing others to explode. \n\n But I'm not sure. \n\n Alternatively, the initial code is nearly correct but needs to track the top row's leftmost column properly. \n\n The original code has a missing part in the first if clause (i < topMostRobot). \n\n The missing code should set topMostRobot = i, and then set topMostRobotCol to the current j, but also track the minimal j in that row. \n\n Thus, the code in the first if clause should be:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nThen, in the else clause (when i == topMostRobot), check if j < topMostRobotCol \u2192 then update topMostRobotCol. \n\n Thus, the code for the first if clause should be:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nThen, in the remaining part of the loop:\n\nif(j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n   topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n}\n\nWait, the code has:\n\nif(currentRow.charAt(j)=='R'){\n\n   if (i < topMostRobot) { \n\n       // this is the first time we encounter a row less than current topMostRobot.\n\n       // So set topMostRobot to i.\n\n       topMostRobot = i;\n\n       // Also, the current j is the only R in this new top row so far, so set topMostRobotCol to j.\n\n       topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n   } else if (i == topMostRobot){\n\n       // now, this is in the current top row.\n\n       // check if this j is smaller than current topMostRobotCol.\n\n       if(j < topMostRobotCol)\n\n           topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n   }\n\n   // and the code also has:\n\n   if(j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n       leftMostRobot = j;\n\n   }\n\nWait, perhaps the leftMostRobot variable is not needed. Maybe the condition should compare the leftmost of the top row with the overall leftmost. \n\nThus, the code should track the overall leftmost among all robots. \n\n Thus, in the loop:\n\nFor any R, update the leftMostRobot as the minimum of current j and previous leftMostRobot. \n\n Thus:\n\nleftMostRobot = Math.min(leftMostRobot, j);\n\nSimilarly, topMostRobotCol is the leftmost in the top row. \n\n Thus, the initial code has variables leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol. \n\n The condition is if (topMostRobotCol > leftMostRobot) \u2192 NO else YES. \n\n But in the case where a robot can come from below, this condition is not sufficient. \n\n However, in the scenario where a robot can move up from below: \n\n For example, robot is at (1,0), and the top row has a robot at (0,2). \n\n The leftMostRobot is 0 < topMostRobotCol 2 \u2192 condition is 2 >0 \u2192 YES \u2192 output NO. \n\n But the correct answer is YES. \n\n Thus, this condition is incorrect. \n\n Thus the correct condition must be different. \n\n This suggests that the code's logic is incorrect, and the correct solution requires a different approach. \n\n Unfortunately, I'm stuck. \n\n Perhaps I should look for a different angle. \n\n The problem requires that at least one robot reaches (0,0). \n\n To do this, the robot must be able to move to (0,0) via some commands, and during all those commands, no robot is pushed out. \n\n The key observation is that any robot that reaches (0,0) must do so in the final command. \n\n Thus, the final command must move that robot to (0,0), and all other commands must not cause any explosion. \n\n Thus, in the final command step, the robot is moving to (0,0). \n\n Thus, in the final move, the robot must be coming from (0,1) or (1,0) or (1,1) etc. \n\n Wait, but the final move must move the robot into (0,0). \n\n So the robot must be in a position where the command's direction brings it to (0,0). \n\n For example:\n\n previous position is (0,1) and the final command is left. \n\n Or (1,0) and command is up. \n\n Or (1,1) and command is up followed by left. \n\n Thus, the robot's position before the final command must be adjacent to (0,0) in the direction of the final command. \n\n Thus, the final command must be such that the robot can move into (0,0) without other robots being pushed out. \n\n Thus, the robot must be in either (0,1), (1,0), or (0,0) already. \n\n If the robot is already in (0,0), then YES. \n\n Else, for it to be in (0,1), all other robots must be able to move left without any exploding. \n\n Or, to be in (1,0), then other robots must be able to move up without any explosions. \n\n Thus, the problem can be reduced to checking if any of the following is true:\n\n1. There is a robot already at (0,0) \u2192 YES. \n\n2. There is a robot in (0,1) and all other robots are in columns >=1 (so that a left command won't cause any other robot to go out). \n\n3. There is a robot in (1,0) and all other robots are in rows >=1 (so that an up command won't cause any robot in row 0 to move up (they can't) and the others can move up. \n\n4. Or other combinations of paths leading to a final command that brings a robot to (0,0) without causing any explosions. \n\n Thus, the problem requires checking for these conditions. \n\n The first condition is easy to check. \n\n The second condition: \n\n If there's a robot in (0,1), then to use a left command to move it to (0,0) \u2014 the other robots must not be in any row above (which they can't) and their columns must be at least 1. \n\n Because when you issue the left command: \n\n The robot at (0,1) moves to (0,0). \n\n All other robots in row 0 must have columns >=1 to avoid going out. \n\n For robots in other rows, they can move any direction as long as they don't go out. \n\n Thus, the condition for this scenario: \n\n\u5b58\u5728 robots in (0,1) \n\n\u6240\u6709 other robots in row 0 must have columns >=1. \n\n All other robots not in row 0 can be in any column. \n\n Thus, this can be checked. \n\n Similarly for the third condition: \n\n There is a robot in (1,0). \n\n All other robots in column 0 must be in rows >=1. \n\n Because when you issue an up command, the robot moves to (0,0). \n\n Other robots in column 0 must not be in row 0 (or they stay there). \n\n Thus, all other robots in column 0 must be in rows >=1. \n\n Or perhaps other conditions. \n\n This is getting too complicated. \n\n Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to fill the missing code with the original TODO block. \n\n The code has in the first if block (i < topMostRobot):\n\n The missing code must set topMostRobot to i, and also track the leftmost column in that row. \n\n Thus, the missing code should be:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\n And then in the else if (i == topMostRobot)\u90e8\u5206\uff0c we need to update the topMostRobotCol if this j is smaller. \n\n Thus the complete code would be:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<numberOfRows; i++){\n\n    String currentRow = scan.next();\n\n    for(int j=0; j<currentRow.length(); j++){\n\n        if(currentRow.charAt(j)=='R'){\n\n            if(i < topMostRobot){\n\n                // This is the new top row.\n\n                topMostRobot = i;\n\n                topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n            } else if (i == topMostRobot) {\n\n                if (j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n                    topMostRobotCol = j;\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            // Update leftMostRobot.\n\n            if (j < leftMostRobot) {\n\n                leftMostRobot = j;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code in the first if block is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\nThis would correctly track the top row's row and the leftmost column in that row. \n\nThe leftMostRobot variable should be tracking the overall leftmost across all robots. \n\nThus, the leftMostRobot should be updated whenever a robot's j is smaller than the current leftMostRobot. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nif(j < topMostRobotCol) {\n\n    leftMostRobot = j;\n\n}\n\nThis is incorrect. It should\u2014 instead, the leftMostRobot should be the minimum j among all robots. So replace that with:\n\nif (j < leftMostRobot) leftMostRobot = j;\n\n Thus, the code should be modified. \n\n Thus, the missing line in the first if block is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\n Thus, the correct code for the TODO is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;\n\n Also, in the code, the leftMostRobot is not properly being set. \n\n Thus, the correct code would be to set leftMostRobot and topMostRobotCol properly. \n\n But according to the problem's requirement, I must only fill the missing part. \n\n The missing code is in the first if block (i < topMostRobot), so the TODO line is missing the code to set topMostRobot and topMostRobotCol. \n\n Thus the missing code is:\n\ntopMostRobot = i;\n\ntopMostRobotCol = j;"
