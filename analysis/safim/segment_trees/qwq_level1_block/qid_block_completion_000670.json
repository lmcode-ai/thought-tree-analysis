A funny permutation must satisfy two conditions:\n1. Each element must have at least one neighbor differing by exactly 1.\n2. No element can be in its original position (no fixed points). The code provided has some special cases handled for n=2, 5, 1, and 9. For even n, it's generating a certain pattern, and for odd n (other than 3), there's a loop that's incomplete. The problem is to fill in the missing parts so that all cases are handled correctly. First, let's think about the cases where a funny permutation is possible. The examples given in the problem statement include n=4 (which is even) and n=5 (handled in the code). The note mentions that n=3 is impossible, so the code's else clause for n=3 would output -1. Wait, looking at the code, the else if(n==1) is there, but for n=3, since it's not covered in the existing conditions, it would fall into the else part which outputs -1. So that's correct.",

Let's see what the code is trying to do here. The first two elements are n-1 and n. Then, for the rest, it's looping from i=3 to n and trying to output n+1 -i. Wait, let's see for n=5.

Wait, let's see for n=7, the loop runs from i=3 to 7. The output for i=3 is 5 (since 7+1-3=5), i=4 gives 4, i=5 gives 3, etc. So the problem is at i=4 (the middle element), which is 4 at position4.

So when i=3, the code enters the TODO block. The idea is probably to swap or adjust that element to avoid the fixed point. Wait, the code's variable k is (n+1)/2. For n=7, k is 4.

But this leads to a fixed point in the middle. So the idea is to adjust the middle element. The code has a condition in the loop: if (i == k-1), where k is (n+1)/2. Let's see for n=7, k is 4. So k-1 is 3. So when i=3 (the third element in the loop, which is the third position in the permutation after the first two), the code needs to do something different here to avoid the fixed point. The problem is that when i=3, the current code would output n+1 -i =7+1-3=5. But in the permutation, the third element (position3) is 5. The position is 3, so 5 is not equal to 3 \u2192 okay. Wait, but in the previous example for n=7, the problem was at position4 (the fourth element). So maybe the code's approach is not the issue here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Wait, let's re-calculate for n=7 with the code's current approach (without the TODO part): The code would output:\n\n6 7 (first two elements) Then for i from 3 to 7:\n\ni=3 \u2192 7+1-3 =5 \u2192 third element is5 (position3 \u2192 5 vs3 \u2192 ok)\n\ni=4 \u2192 7+1-4=4 \u2192 fourth element is4 (position4 \u2192 4 vs4 \u2192 fixed point \u2192 problem)\n\ni=5 \u2192 3 \u2192 position5 \u2192 3 vs5 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=6 \u2192 2 \u2192 position6 \u2192 2 vs6 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=7 \u21921 \u2192 position7 \u21921 vs7 \u2192 ok. So the problem is at i=4 (the fourth element, which is position4). So the code's approach for odd n (other than 3 and 5) is to output 4 at position4, which is a fixed point. So the code needs to adjust that element. The code's current code has a condition when i ==k-1 (k is (n+1)/2 \u2192 for n=7, k=4 \u2192 k-1=3 \u2192 so when i=3, which is the third element in the loop (position3), but the problem is at i=4 (position4). So perhaps the condition should be when i ==k? Wait, let's see:\n\nk is (n+1)/2 \u2192 for n=7, k=4. So when i=4 (the fourth element in the loop, which is the fourth position in the permutation), that's the problematic element. So the condition should be when i ==k \u2192 then do something different. So the code's current condition is if (i ==k-1), but perhaps it should be if (i ==k). Alternatively, maybe the code needs to swap the middle element with another to avoid the fixed point. The code's current code has a loop that outputs n+1 -i for each i from 3 to n. So for i=4 (position4), the value is 4, which is the problem. To avoid this, perhaps when i is k (the middle position), we need to output a different value. So the idea is to, when i reaches the middle position (i=k), instead of outputting 4, output something else. For example, swap it with the next element. Alternatively, perhaps the code should output n+1 - (i+1) or something like that. Alternatively, maybe the code should output the next element first, then the current one. Wait, let's think of the code's current approach for n=7. The sequence after the first two elements is 5,4,3,2,1. The problem is the 4 at position4.",

Then the next element would be 4 (so the sequence would be 5,3,4,2,1 \u2192 but then the fourth element is4 at position4 \u2192 still fixed point. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the code should output the middle element as (k+1) but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the code should output the middle element as (k-1) and then swap the next elements. Alternatively, perhaps the code should handle the middle element by inserting a different number. Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to, when i reaches the middle (i=k), output a different value, like k-1, and then adjust the next elements accordingly.",

Looking at the code's special case for n=5: the permutation is 5 4 1 2 3. The middle element (position3) is1. So the code's approach for n=5 is different from the general case for odd n.\n\nPerhaps for odd n, the correct approach is to arrange the permutation as follows:\n\nStart with n-1 and n, then arrange the remaining numbers in a way that they form a sequence that goes down to 1, but with a break in the middle to avoid the fixed point. Wait, for n=5, after 5 and4, the remaining numbers are 3,2,1. But the code's permutation is 5,4,1,2,3. So after 4, it goes to 1, then 2, then3.",

No fixed points. So this works. So the permutation for n=7 is 6 7 2 1 3 4 5. How can this be generated? Looking at the code's structure for odd n:\n\nThe code starts with n-1 (6) and n (7). Then loops from i=3 to n (7). The loop is supposed to output n+1 -i for each i, except when i is k-1 (k is (n+1)/2 \u2192 for n=7, k=4 \u2192 k-1=3). In the current code's loop, for i=3 (third element in the loop, which is the third position in the permutation), the code has a condition if (i ==k-1 \u2192 3 ==3 \u2192 yes). So the code should do something here. The desired value for i=3 (third element) is 2. The current code would output n+1 -i =7+1-3=5. But we need to output 2 instead. So the code needs to, when i is k-1 (i=3 for n=7), output a different value. Let's see what 2 is in terms of n and i.\n\nFor n=7 and i=3, the desired value is 2. Let's see:\n\nn+1 -i =5 \u2192 not desired. Alternatively, perhaps the code should output (i - (k - (i - (k-1))) )? Not sure.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the given C++ code to solve the problem of generating a funny permutation. Let me start by understanding the problem again.\n\nA funny permutation must satisfy two conditions:\n1. Each element must have at least one neighbor differing by exactly 1.\n2. No element can be in its original position (no fixed points).\n\nThe code provided has some special cases handled for n=2, 5, 1, and 9. For even n, it's generating a certain pattern, and for odd n (other than 3), there's a loop that's incomplete. The problem is to fill in the missing parts so that all cases are handled correctly.\n\nFirst, let's think about the cases where a funny permutation is possible. The examples given in the problem statement include n=4 (which is even) and n=5 (handled in the code). The note mentions that n=3 is impossible, so the code's else clause for n=3 would output -1. Wait, looking at the code, the else if(n==1) is there, but for n=3, since it's not covered in the existing conditions, it would fall into the else part which outputs -1. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's see the existing code's approach for even n. For even n, the code starts with n-1 and n, then counts down from n-2. For example, when n=4, the output would be 3 4 2 1. Let's check if that works:\n\n3's neighbor is 4 (diff +1), so okay. 4's neighbor is 3 (diff -1), okay. 2's neighbor is 1 (diff -1), okay. 1's neighbor is 2 (diff +1). Also, no fixed points: 3\u22601, 4\u22602, 2\u22603, 1\u22604. So that works. So the even case seems okay.\n\nNow for odd n. The code has a section for n%2 !=0 and n !=3. Let's see what the code is trying to do here. The first two elements are n-1 and n. Then, for the rest, it's looping from i=3 to n and trying to output n+1 -i. Wait, let's see for n=5. The code's first part for n=5 is handled as a special case, so that's okay. Let's see for n=7. The code would start with 6 7, then for i from 3 to 7 (since n=7, the loop runs from 3 to 7 inclusive?), but the loop is written as for(int i=3; i<=n; i++). Let's see what the current code would do for n=7 (without the TODO part). The code would output 6 7 followed by n+1 -i for i from 3 to 7. Let's compute:\n\ni=3: 7+1 -3 =5 \u2192 5\ni=4: 7+1-4=4 \u21924\ni=5: 3 \u21923\ni=6: 2 \u21922\ni=7:1 \u21921\n\nSo the sequence would be 6 7 5 4 3 2 1. Let's check the conditions:\n\nCheck each element's neighbors:\n\n6 (first element) has neighbor 7 (diff +1 \u2192 okay)\n7 (second) has neighbor 6 (diff -1 \u2192 okay)\n5 (third) has neighbor 7 (diff -2 \u2192 not good) and 4 (diff -1 \u2192 okay. So okay)\n4 (fourth) has neighbors 5 (diff +1) and 3 (diff -1 \u2192 okay)\n3 (fifth) has neighbors 4 (diff +1) and 2 (diff -1 \u2192 okay)\n2 (sixth) has neighbors 3 (diff +1) and 1 (diff -1 \u2192 okay)\n1 (last) has neighbor 2 (diff +1 \u2192 okay)\n\nSo all elements meet the first condition. Now check fixed points:\n\nPositions are 1-based. The permutation is [6,7,5,4,3,2,1].\n\nCheck each position:\n\npos1:6\u22601 \u2192 ok\npos2:7\u22602 \u2192 ok\npos3:5\u22603 \u2192 ok\npos4:4 is at position4 \u2192 which is a fixed point! Oh no, that's a problem. So this permutation is invalid because the fourth element is 4, which is at position4. So the code's current approach for odd n (other than 3 and 5) is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so the code's approach for odd n is flawed. The problem is that when n is odd and not 5, the current code's approach would have a fixed point at the middle position. For example, in n=7, the middle element (position4) is 4. So that's a problem. So the code's current approach for odd n is not correct. Therefore, the missing code in the TODO section must fix this.\n\nThe problem is that in the current code's approach for odd n, the middle element is exactly the position's index. So we need to adjust that.\n\nLooking at the code's structure for the odd case:\n\nThe code starts with n-1 and n, then loops from i=3 to n, and in the loop, for each i, it outputs n+1 -i. Wait, let's see for n=7, the loop runs from i=3 to 7. The output for i=3 is 5 (since 7+1-3=5), i=4 gives 4, i=5 gives 3, etc. So the problem is at i=4 (the middle element), which is 4 at position4. So the code needs to avoid that.\n\nThe code has a condition in the loop: if (i == k-1), where k is (n+1)/2. Let's see what k is for n=7. (7+1)/2 =4. So k=4. So k-1 is 3. So when i=3, the code enters the TODO block. The idea is probably to swap or adjust that element to avoid the fixed point.\n\nWait, the code's variable k is (n+1)/2. For n=7, k is 4. So the middle position is at i=4 (since the first two elements are already placed, so the third element is i=3, which is the third position in the permutation. Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the permutation's indices.\n\nWait, the code's loop for the odd case starts after the first two elements (n-1 and n). The loop is for i from 3 to n, and each iteration corresponds to the next element in the permutation. So for n=7, the first two elements are 6 and7. Then the loop runs for i=3,4,5,6,7. Each i corresponds to the next position in the permutation. The third element (position3) is when i=3, which is 5 (n+1 -i =7+1-3=5). The fourth element (position4) is when i=4 \u2192 4. So that's the problem.\n\nThe code's idea is to handle the case when i is k-1 (k is the middle index?), but perhaps the code needs to adjust the value at that position to avoid the fixed point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to swap the middle element with another to prevent the fixed point. Let me think of possible patterns for odd n.\n\nLooking at the example given for n=5, the code outputs 5 4 1 2 3. Wait, let's check that permutation:\n\nWait, the code's output for n=5 is \"5 4 1 2 3\". Wait, but according to the problem statement's example, the correct permutation for n=4 is [4,3,1,2], but for n=5, the code's output is 5 4 1 2 3. Let me check if that permutation is valid.\n\nCheck the first condition:\n\n5 (position1) has neighbor 4 (diff -1 \u2192 okay)\n4 (position2) has neighbor 5 (diff +1) and 1 (diff -3 \u2192 but at least one is okay)\n1 (position3) has neighbors 4 (diff +3) and 2 (diff +1 \u2192 okay)\n2 (position4) has neighbors 1 (diff -1) and 3 (diff +1 \u2192 okay)\n3 (position5) has neighbor 2 (diff -1 \u2192 okay)\n\nAll elements meet the first condition. Now check fixed points:\n\nposition1:5 \u2192 which is 1? No, 5 is at position1, which is not 1 \u2192 okay.\nposition2:4 vs 2 \u2192 okay.\nposition3:1 vs3 \u2192 okay.\nposition4:2 vs4 \u2192 okay.\nposition5:3 vs5 \u2192 okay. So this permutation is valid. So the code's special case for n=5 is correct.\n\nHmm, so for n=5, the code's approach is different. So perhaps for other odd n, the approach needs to be adjusted to avoid the fixed point in the middle.\n\nLooking back at the code's structure for odd n (n%2 !=0 and n !=3):\n\nThe code starts with n-1 and n, then loops from i=3 to n, and in the loop, for each i, it outputs n+1 -i, except when i is k-1 (where k is (n+1)/2). The idea is probably to adjust that particular element to avoid the fixed point.\n\nLet me think of n=7 again. The middle position is at (n+1)/2 =4. The current code's approach would have the element at position4 as 4, which is a fixed point. So the code needs to change that element.\n\nSuppose when i is k-1 (i=3 for n=7, since k=4, so k-1=3), then instead of outputting n+1 -i (which would be 5), perhaps we need to swap it with the next element or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should output a different value here. Let me think of possible permutations for n=7.\n\nWe need a permutation where each element has a neighbor differing by 1, and no fixed points.\n\nLet me try to construct one for n=7.\n\nPossible approach: arrange the permutation in a way that avoids the fixed point in the middle.\n\nSuppose the permutation starts with 6,7, then the next elements need to be arranged such that the middle element isn't 4.\n\nLet me think of the following pattern for odd n:\n\nAfter the first two elements (n-1 and n), the rest of the elements are arranged in a way that the middle element is not its position. For example, maybe swap the middle element with another.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation can be constructed as follows:\n\nFor odd n, the permutation is [n-1, n, n-3, n-2, 1, 2, ..., up to the middle? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the permutation for n=7 as follows:\n\n6 7 5 4 3 2 1 \u2192 but this has the 4 at position4 (fixed point). So that's bad.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's try to make the middle element not be its position. For n=7, the middle is position4. So instead of 4, maybe 3?\n\nWait, let's try to construct a valid permutation for n=7.\n\nLet me try:\n\n6 7 5 3 4 2 1 \u2192 let's see:\n\nCheck each element's neighbors:\n\n6 (pos1) \u2192 neighbor 7 (diff +1 \u2192 ok)\n7 (pos2) \u2192 neighbor 6 (diff -1) and 5 (diff -2 \u2192 at least one is ok)\n5 (pos3) \u2192 neighbors 7 (diff +2) and 3 (diff -2 \u2192 no, so need another neighbor. Wait, 5's right neighbor is 3 (diff -2), left is 7 (diff +2). Neither is \u00b11. So this is invalid.\n\nHmm, that's not good.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's see the example for n=5. The permutation is 5 4 1 2 3. The middle element (position3) is 1. So maybe for n=7, the middle element can be 1?\n\nWait, let's try:\n\n6 7 5 3 1 2 4 \u2192 Not sure. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the permutation can be arranged as a sequence that alternates up and down, avoiding fixed points.\n\nAnother idea: For odd n, the permutation can be arranged as follows:\n\nStart with n-1, n, then arrange the remaining numbers in a way that they form a sequence where each is adjacent to its predecessor or successor, and no fixed points.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to reverse the sequence except for the middle element. Let me think of n=7:\n\nThe initial part is 6,7. Then the remaining numbers are 5,4,3,2,1. But arranged in a way that the middle (position4) is not 4.\n\nWait, maybe the sequence after 6,7 is 5,3,4,2,1. Let's see:\n\nThe full permutation would be 6,7,5,3,4,2,1.\n\nCheck each element:\n\n6 (pos1) \u2192 neighbor 7 (diff +1 \u2192 ok)\n7 (pos2) \u2192 neighbor 6 (diff -1) and 5 (diff -2 \u2192 ok)\n5 (pos3) \u2192 neighbors 7 (diff +2) and 3 (diff -2 \u2192 no. Wait, 5 and 3 differ by 2. So that's a problem. So this is invalid.\n\nHmm, not good.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's see for n=7, maybe the permutation is 6 7 5 4 2 3 1.\n\nCheck each element:\n\n6 \u2192 ok with 7.\n\n7 \u2192 ok with 6.\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 next is 4 (diff -1 \u2192 ok).\n\n4 (pos4) \u2192 next is 2 (diff -2 \u2192 but left neighbor is 5 (diff +1 \u2192 ok).\n\n2 (pos5) \u2192 next is 3 (diff +1 \u2192 ok), left is 4 (diff +2 \u2192 but at least one is ok.\n\n3 (pos6) \u2192 next is 1 (diff -2 \u2192 left is 2 (diff -1 \u2192 ok).\n\n1 (pos7) \u2192 left is 3 (diff +2 \u2192 but no right neighbor, so only left neighbor must have difference 1? Wait, the first condition requires that at least one neighbor (left or right) has difference 1. For the last element (pos7), the left neighbor is 3 (diff 2), so that's a problem. So this permutation is invalid.\n\nHmm, tricky.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the permutation as a sequence where elements are arranged in a way that each element is adjacent to either +1 or -1. This is similar to a permutation that forms a single \"chain\" where each element is next to its predecessor or successor. Such permutations are called \"linear\" or \"consecutive\" permutations.\n\nFor example, for n=5, the given permutation is 5 4 1 2 3. Let's see the chain:\n\n5 is next to 4 (diff -1), 4 next to 5 and 1 (diff -3 \u2192 but the first condition is satisfied because at least one neighbor is adjacent. Wait, 4's left neighbor is 5 (diff +1), so that's okay. Then 1 is next to 4 (diff -3) and 2 (diff +1 \u2192 okay). 2 next to 1 (diff -1) and 3 (diff +1 \u2192 okay). 3 next to 2 (diff -1).\n\nSo the chain is 5-4-1-2-3. Each element has at least one neighbor adjacent.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern for odd n is to arrange the permutation in a way that starts with n-1, n, then goes down to some point and then up again, but avoiding fixed points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the permutation can be constructed as follows for odd n:\n\nStart with n-1, n, then arrange the remaining numbers in a way that they form a sequence where each is adjacent to the previous, but also ensuring no fixed points.\n\nWait, let's think of n=7. The desired permutation should have all elements meeting the first condition and no fixed points.\n\nLet me try constructing it step by step.\n\nStart with 6,7 (positions 1 and 2).\n\nNext, after 7, we need a number that is adjacent to 7 (so 6 or 8, but 8 is beyond n). So the next number can be 6, but that's already used. So perhaps the next number is 5 (diff -2 from 7, but that's okay as long as it has another neighbor. Wait, but the first condition requires that at least one neighbor is adjacent. So 7's right neighbor (5) must be either 6 or 8. Since it's 5, that's not adjacent. So that's a problem. So the third element must be 6, but that's already used. Hmm, so maybe the third element can't be 5. So perhaps the third element should be 5, but then the second element (7) has a neighbor 5 (diff -2), but its left neighbor is 6 (diff -1 \u2192 okay). So that's okay.\n\nWait, the second element (7) has left neighbor 6 (diff -1 \u2192 okay), so it's okay. The third element (5) has left neighbor 7 (diff -2 \u2192 but must have at least one neighbor differing by 1. So the third element's right neighbor must be 4 or 6. Since 6 is already used, maybe 4.\n\nSo the sequence so far is 6,7,5,4.\n\nThen next element after 4 must be 3 or 5 (but 5 is already there). So 3.\n\nThen 3's next is 2 or 4 (4 is there). So 2.\n\nThen 2's next is 1 or 3 (3 is there). So 1.\n\nSo the full permutation would be 6,7,5,4,3,2,1. But this has the 4 at position4 (fixed point). So that's bad.\n\nHmm, so need to avoid that.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's swap the 4 and 3. So the sequence would be 6,7,5,3,4,2,1.\n\nCheck the elements:\n\nPosition4 is 3 (which is not 4 \u2192 okay). Position5 is 4 (position5 \u2192 4 vs5 \u2192 okay).\n\nCheck each element's neighbors:\n\n6 (pos1) \u2192 ok with 7.\n\n7 (pos2) \u2192 ok with 6.\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 left is7 (diff -2), right is3 (diff -2 \u2192 no. Wait, that's a problem. 5's neighbors are 7 and 3. Neither is adjacent. So this is invalid.\n\nHmm, so that's not good.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's try to make the middle element not be its position. For n=7, the middle is position4. Let's see if we can have 3 there instead of 4.\n\nLet me try the permutation: 6,7,5,3,2,4,1.\n\nCheck each element:\n\n6 \u2192 ok.\n\n7 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 neighbors 7 (diff -2) and 3 (diff -2 \u2192 no. Not good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: Let's try to arrange the permutation as follows for n=7:\n\n6,7,5,2,3,4,1.\n\nCheck:\n\n6 \u2192 ok.\n\n7 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 right is2 (diff -3 \u2192 but left is7 (diff -2 \u2192 neither adjacent. So invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the permutation as a cycle where each element is adjacent to its predecessor and successor, but arranged in a way that avoids fixed points. For example, for n=7, maybe the permutation is 2,3,4,5,6,7,1. But check fixed points:\n\nPosition1:2\u22601 \u2192 ok.\n\nPosition2:3\u22602 \u2192 ok.\n\nPosition3:4\u22603 \u2192 ok.\n\nPosition4:5\u22604 \u2192 ok.\n\nPosition5:6\u22605 \u2192 ok.\n\nPosition6:7\u22606 \u2192 ok.\n\nPosition7:1\u22607 \u2192 ok.\n\nNow check the first condition:\n\nEach element must have at least one neighbor differing by 1.\n\nCheck each element:\n\n2 (pos1) \u2192 neighbor is3 (diff +1 \u2192 ok).\n\n3 (pos2) \u2192 neighbors 2 and4 \u2192 both differ by 1 \u2192 ok.\n\n4 (pos3) \u2192 neighbors 3 and5 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos4) \u2192 neighbors4 and6 \u2192 ok.\n\n6 (pos5) \u2192 neighbors5 and7 \u2192 ok.\n\n7 (pos6) \u2192 neighbors6 and1 \u2192 1 is 6 away \u2192 but left neighbor is6 (diff -1 \u2192 ok).\n\n1 (pos7) \u2192 neighbor is7 (diff +6 \u2192 but left neighbor is7 \u2192 no. Wait, the right neighbor is nothing, so only left neighbor (7) which is 6 away. So this element (1) has no neighbor differing by 1. So this permutation is invalid.\n\nHmm, so that's not good.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's try to make a permutation where the elements are arranged in a way that they form a single \"snake\" where each element is adjacent to the next, but also ensuring no fixed points.\n\nFor example, for n=7:\n\nThe permutation could be 6,7,5,4,3,2,1 \u2192 but as before, the 4 is at position4 (fixed point).\n\nSo to fix that, swap 4 and 3:\n\n6,7,5,3,4,2,1 \u2192 check:\n\nPosition4 is3 (ok), position5 is4 (position5 \u2192 4 vs5 \u2192 ok).\n\nCheck each element's neighbors:\n\n6 (pos1) \u2192 ok.\n\n7 (pos2) \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 left is7 (diff -2), right is3 (diff -2 \u2192 neither. So invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: Let's try to make the permutation as follows for n=7:\n\n6,7,2,3,4,5,1.\n\nCheck fixed points:\n\nAll positions except maybe 5 (4 is at position4 \u2192 4 vs4 \u2192 no, position4 is 3? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait the permutation is 6,7,2,3,4,5,1.\n\nPosition4 is3 \u2192 ok.\n\nPosition5 is4 \u2192 ok (since 4 is at position5 \u2192 4 vs5 \u2192 ok).\n\nPosition6 is5 \u2192 ok (5 vs6 \u2192 ok).\n\nPosition7 is1 \u2192 ok.\n\nNow check the first condition:\n\n6 (pos1) \u2192 neighbor7 (diff+1 \u2192 ok).\n\n7 (pos2) \u2192 neighbor6 and2 \u2192 2 is -5 \u2192 but left neighbor is6 (diff-1 \u2192 ok).\n\n2 (pos3) \u2192 neighbors7 (diff+5) and3 (diff+1 \u2192 ok).\n\n3 (pos4) \u2192 neighbors2 (diff-1) and4 (diff+1 \u2192 ok).\n\n4 (pos5) \u2192 neighbors3 and5 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos6) \u2192 neighbors4 and1 \u2192 1 is -4 \u2192 but left neighbor is4 (diff+1 \u2192 ok).\n\n1 (pos7) \u2192 neighbor5 (diff+4 \u2192 but only left neighbor is5 \u2192 no. So this element (1) has no neighbor differing by 1. So invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to think of a different pattern.\n\nLooking back at the code's approach for even n, it's a simple reverse after the first two elements. For odd n, perhaps a similar approach but with an adjustment in the middle.\n\nThe code's current approach for odd n (other than 3 and 5) is to output n-1, n followed by n+1 -i for i from 3 to n. But this leads to a fixed point in the middle. So the idea is to adjust the middle element.\n\nThe code has a condition in the loop: if (i == k-1), where k is (n+1)/2. Let's see for n=7, k is 4. So k-1 is 3. So when i=3 (the third element in the loop, which is the third position in the permutation after the first two), the code needs to do something different here to avoid the fixed point.\n\nThe problem is that when i=3, the current code would output n+1 -i =7+1-3=5. But in the permutation, the third element (position3) is 5. The position is 3, so 5 is not equal to 3 \u2192 okay. Wait, but in the previous example for n=7, the problem was at position4 (the fourth element). So maybe the code's approach is not the issue here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate for n=7 with the code's current approach (without the TODO part):\n\nThe code would output:\n\n6 7 (first two elements)\n\nThen for i from 3 to 7:\n\ni=3 \u2192 7+1-3 =5 \u2192 third element is5 (position3 \u2192 5 vs3 \u2192 ok)\n\ni=4 \u2192 7+1-4=4 \u2192 fourth element is4 (position4 \u2192 4 vs4 \u2192 fixed point \u2192 problem)\n\ni=5 \u2192 3 \u2192 position5 \u2192 3 vs5 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=6 \u2192 2 \u2192 position6 \u2192 2 vs6 \u2192 ok.\n\ni=7 \u21921 \u2192 position7 \u21921 vs7 \u2192 ok.\n\nSo the problem is at i=4 (the fourth element, which is position4). So the code's approach for odd n (other than 3 and 5) is to output 4 at position4, which is a fixed point. So the code needs to adjust that element.\n\nThe code's current code has a condition when i ==k-1 (k is (n+1)/2 \u2192 for n=7, k=4 \u2192 k-1=3 \u2192 so when i=3, which is the third element in the loop (position3), but the problem is at i=4 (position4). So perhaps the condition should be when i ==k?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nk is (n+1)/2 \u2192 for n=7, k=4. So when i=4 (the fourth element in the loop, which is the fourth position in the permutation), that's the problematic element. So the condition should be when i ==k \u2192 then do something different.\n\nSo the code's current condition is if (i ==k-1), but perhaps it should be if (i ==k).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code needs to swap the middle element with another to avoid the fixed point.\n\nThe code's current code has a loop that outputs n+1 -i for each i from 3 to n. So for i=4 (position4), the value is 4, which is the problem. To avoid this, perhaps when i is k (the middle position), we need to output a different value.\n\nSo the idea is to, when i reaches the middle position (i=k), instead of outputting 4, output something else. For example, swap it with the next element.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should output n+1 - (i+1) or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should output the next element first, then the current one.\n\nWait, let's think of the code's current approach for n=7. The sequence after the first two elements is 5,4,3,2,1. The problem is the 4 at position4. To fix this, perhaps we can swap the 4 and 3, so the sequence becomes 5,3,4,2,1. Then the fourth element (position4) is4 \u2192 still a problem. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, swap the 4 and 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle element should be one less than it was. For example, instead of 4, output 3. But then the next element would be 4, but that would require adjusting the following elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should output the middle element as (k-1) instead of k. Let me see:\n\nFor n=7, the middle is position4. The current value is4. To avoid fixed point, we can make it 3. Then the next element would be 4 (so the sequence would be 5,3,4,2,1 \u2192 but then the fourth element is4 at position4 \u2192 still fixed point.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should output the middle element as (k+1) but that might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should output the middle element as (k-1) and then swap the next elements.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should handle the middle element by inserting a different number.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to, when i reaches the middle (i=k), output a different value, like k-1, and then adjust the next elements accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should output the middle element as (k-1), and then the next element as k, but then the sequence would have to be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the permutation for n=7 as follows:\n\n6,7,5,3,4,2,1 \u2192 let's see:\n\nPosition4 is3 (ok), position5 is4 (ok).\n\nCheck each element's neighbors:\n\n6 (pos1) \u2192 ok.\n\n7 (pos2) \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 left is7 (diff-2), right is3 (diff-2 \u2192 neither. So this is invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: Let's try to make the permutation for n=7 as 6,7,5,4,2,3,1.\n\nCheck:\n\nPosition4 is4 (fixed point \u2192 no good).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, 6,7,5,2,4,3,1.\n\nCheck:\n\nPosition4 is2 (position4 \u2192 2 vs4 \u2192 ok).\n\nPosition5 is4 (position5 \u21924 vs5 \u2192 ok).\n\nCheck each element's neighbors:\n\n6 \u2192 ok.\n\n7 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 left is7 (diff-2), right is2 (diff-3 \u2192 neither. So invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the code's existing cases and see what the correct approach is.\n\nLooking at the code's special case for n=5: the permutation is 5 4 1 2 3.\n\nThe middle element (position3) is1. So the code's approach for n=5 is different from the general case for odd n.\n\nPerhaps for odd n, the correct approach is to arrange the permutation as follows:\n\nStart with n-1 and n, then arrange the remaining numbers in a way that they form a sequence that goes down to 1, but with a break in the middle to avoid the fixed point.\n\nWait, for n=5, after 5 and4, the remaining numbers are 3,2,1. But the code's permutation is 5,4,1,2,3. So after 4, it goes to 1, then 2, then3.\n\nAh, so the idea is to split the remaining numbers into two parts: after the first two elements, the next elements are arranged in a way that they form a sequence that starts from 1 and goes up, but ensuring that the middle element is not fixed.\n\nSo for n=5, after 5 and4, the remaining numbers are 1,2,3. So the sequence is 1,2,3. This way, each element after 4 has a neighbor that is adjacent.\n\nFor n=7, perhaps the remaining numbers after 6 and7 are 5,4,3,2,1. The code's current approach is to arrange them in reverse (5,4,3,2,1), but that causes the fixed point at4. So instead, maybe split them into two parts: after 6 and7, go down to 1, but then swap the middle element with a lower one.\n\nAlternatively, after 6 and7, the next elements could be 5,3,4,2,1. Let's see:\n\nThe permutation would be 6,7,5,3,4,2,1.\n\nCheck each element's neighbors:\n\n6 \u2192 ok.\n\n7 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 left is7 (diff-2), right is3 (diff-2 \u2192 neither. So invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, 6,7,5,2,3,4,1.\n\nCheck:\n\n5 (pos3) \u2192 right is2 (diff-3 \u2192 no. Left is7 (diff-2 \u2192 no. So invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: Let's try to make the permutation for n=7 as follows:\n\n6,7,2,3,4,5,1.\n\nCheck:\n\nPosition3 is2 (ok), position4 is3 (ok), position5 is4 (ok), position6 is5 (ok).\n\nCheck each element's neighbors:\n\n6 \u2192 ok.\n\n7 \u2192 ok.\n\n2 (pos3) \u2192 left is7 (diff-5 \u2192 no, but right is3 (diff+1 \u2192 ok).\n\n3 (pos4) \u2192 left is2 (diff-1) and right4 (diff+1 \u2192 ok.\n\n4 (pos5) \u2192 neighbors3 and5 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos6) \u2192 neighbors4 and1 \u2192 left is4 (diff+1 \u2192 ok).\n\n1 (pos7) \u2192 left is5 (diff+4 \u2192 no. So this element has no neighbor differing by 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, 6,7,2,1,3,4,5.\n\nCheck:\n\nPosition3 is2 (ok), position4 is1 (ok).\n\nCheck each element:\n\n6 \u2192 ok.\n\n7 \u2192 ok.\n\n2 (pos3) \u2192 right is1 (diff-1 \u2192 ok.\n\n1 (pos4) \u2192 left is2 (diff+1 \u2192 ok, right is3 (diff+2 \u2192 ok.\n\n3 (pos5) \u2192 neighbors1 (diff+2) and4 (diff+1 \u2192 ok.\n\n4 (pos6) \u2192 neighbors3 and5 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos7) \u2192 left is4 (diff+1 \u2192 ok.\n\nNow check fixed points:\n\nAll positions except maybe 5 (3 at pos5 \u2192 ok), 6 (4 at pos6 \u2192 ok), 7 (5 at pos7 \u2192 5 vs7 \u2192 ok.\n\nSo this permutation is valid.\n\nWait, let's check all elements:\n\n6 (pos1) \u2192 ok.\n\n7 (pos2) \u2192 ok.\n\n2 (pos3) \u2192 neighbors7 (diff-5) and1 (diff-1 \u2192 ok.\n\n1 (pos4) \u2192 neighbors2 (diff+1) and3 (diff+2 \u2192 ok.\n\n3 (pos5) \u2192 neighbors1 (diff+2) and4 (diff+1 \u2192 ok.\n\n4 (pos6) \u2192 neighbors3 and5 \u2192 ok.\n\n5 (pos7) \u2192 neighbors4 \u2192 ok.\n\nAll elements meet the first condition. No fixed points. So this works.\n\nSo the permutation for n=7 is 6 7 2 1 3 4 5.\n\nHow can this be generated?\n\nLooking at the code's structure for odd n:\n\nThe code starts with n-1 (6) and n (7). Then loops from i=3 to n (7). The loop is supposed to output n+1 -i for each i, except when i is k-1 (k is (n+1)/2 \u2192 for n=7, k=4 \u2192 k-1=3).\n\nIn the current code's loop, for i=3 (third element in the loop, which is the third position in the permutation), the code has a condition if (i ==k-1 \u2192 3 ==3 \u2192 yes). So the code should do something here.\n\nThe desired value for i=3 (third element) is 2. The current code would output n+1 -i =7+1-3=5. But we need to output 2 instead.\n\nSo the code needs to, when i is k-1 (i=3 for n=7), output a different value. Let's see what 2 is in terms of n and i.\n\nFor n=7 and i=3, the desired value is 2. Let's see:\n\nn+1 -i =5 \u2192 not desired.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should output (i - (k - (i - (k-1))) )? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should output (i - (k -1)) \u2192 but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should output (i - (k -1)) \u2192 for i=3, k-1=3 \u2192 3-3=0 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should output (i - (k -1) -1) \u2192 3-3-1 =-1 \u2192 no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the desired value is (i - (k -1) -1) \u2192 but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should output (i - (k -1) -1) \u2192 but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the desired value is (i -

For example, the sequences $$$[3, 1, 4, 2]$$$, [$$$1, 2, 3, 4, 2]$$$, are permutations, but the permutation must satisfy two conditions:\n  For each element $$$p_i$$$, at least one of its neighbors has a value that differs by one.\n  the permutation must have no fixed points.\n Let's call the permutation that satisfies these requirements funny.\n\nFor example, let $$$n = 4$$$, the permutation is $$$4, 3, 1, 2$$$, which is a funny permutation, but output -1 if funny permutation of length $$$n$$$ does not exist.\n\nInput Specification: The first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nOutput Specification: For each test case, print on a separate line:\n    any funny permutation of length $$$n$$, or the number -1 if funny permutation of length $$$n$$$ does not exist.\n\nCode:\n\n#include<bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){\n    int t;\n    cin>>t;\n    while(t--){\n        int n;\n        cin>>n;\n        if(n==2){\n            cout<<\"2 1\"<<endl;\n            continue;\n        }\n        else if(n%2==0){\n            int arr[n-2];\n            cout<<n-1<<\" \";\n            for(int i=0;i<n-2;i++){\n                cout<<n-2-i<<\" \";\n            }\n            cout<<n-1<<\" \";\n            continue;\n        }\n        else{\n            int arr[n];\n            int k=(n+1)/2;\n            for(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n                if(i==k-1){\n                    /* TODO: Your code here */\n                }\n                cout<<n-2-i<<\" \";\n            }\n            cout<<n-1<<\" \";\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}"
