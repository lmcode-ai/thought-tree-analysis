The optimal strategy would involve minimizing the maximum possible days required. The code seems to be trying to model the minimal required days using some dynamic programming approach.

Then, the code's calculation would be: \n\nThe reversed edges: the edge is from 2 to 1 (since the original edge is 1->2, so in the reversed graph, it's stored as 2 pointing to 1). The out array for node 1 is 1 (since it has one outgoing edge). The dis array starts with dis[2] =0. Processing node 2 (since it's the starting point). Then, for the edge 2 ->1 (the reversed edge), the 'to' is 1. The out[to] (out[1] is 1). So x = dis[2] (0) + out[1] (1) +1 = 2. So dis[1] would be 2.

But in Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to process the node with the smallest distance first. So this is a mistake. Ah, that's a critical error. So the code is using a max-heap instead of a min-heap, which would lead to incorrect results. So the first thing to fix is the priority queue. The priority queue should be a min-heap. So the line \n\npriority_queue<PII> q;\n\nshould be \n\npriority_queue<PII, vector<PII>, greater<PII>> q;\n\nWait, but in the code, the distance is stored as the first element of the pair. Wait, the code's current setup is using a max-heap, so when you push {0, n}, the top is the largest distance. But since we want to process nodes in order of increasing distance, the priority queue should be a min-heap. Therefore, the code's priority queue is incorrect. So that's another error. Hmm, so the code has two errors: the formula for x and the priority queue type. Let me think again. The problem requires that the minimal d is the minimal number of days such that they can guarantee arrival. The approach here is to model the problem as a shortest path where each node's distance is the minimal required days. The correct formula for the distance would be: \n\nFor a node u, the minimal days to reach n is the minimal over all edges u -> v (in the original graph) of (number of edges to block to force the path through v) plus the days needed from v plus 1 (the day to move).",

But for Dijkstra's algorithm, we need a min-heap. So the first mistake is the priority queue type. The code should use a min-heap. So the priority queue should be declared as: \n\npriority_queue< PII, vector<PII>, greater<PII> > q;\n\nAlternatively, since the code uses pairs with distance stored as the first element, but in a max-heap, the smallest distance would be at the bottom, so the algorithm would not work. Therefore, the priority queue must be a min-heap. So the first correction is changing the priority queue to a min-heap. Second, the formula for x should be dis[now] + out[to], not + out[to] +1. Third, the code should push the new distance into the priority queue. So the missing code inside the if statement is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( { -x, to } ); Wait, no. Wait, the priority queue is a min-heap, so the elements should be stored with their distance as the first element. Wait, the code currently has the priority queue storing pairs with the first element being the distance. Wait, the code's current code has: \n\nq.push({0,n}); So the first element is the distance.",

But the code will still have the formula error and the priority queue error. Hmm, perhaps the problem's code has other errors but the user is only asking to fill in the missing lines. The problem's code has the following line: \n\nout[to]--;\n\nWait, in the code's loop over the edges: \n\nfor(int i = head[now]; i;i = e[i].nxt){\n\n    int to = e[i].to;\n\n    out[to]--;\n\n    int x = dis[now] + out[to] + 1;\n\n    //...\n\n}\n\nWait, this line out[to]-- is decrementing the out[to] variable. But the out array was initialized as the number of outgoing edges for each node. This is a mistake. Because the out array is supposed to represent the original out-degree of each node. But in the code, for each edge in the reversed graph (now -> to), which corresponds to an original edge to -> now, the code is decrementing out[to]. This is incorrect. The out array should not be modified. This is another error in the code. This is a big problem. The code's line out[to]--; is wrong. This line should be removed. But the problem says to output only the missing code. The code's current code has this line as part of the existing code. Therefore, the user's code has multiple errors, but the question is to fill in the missing lines. The missing lines are the two lines inside the if block. Therefore, the correct answer is the two lines: dis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( make_pair(x, to) ); But the code will still have other errors. However, the problem's instruction says to output only the missing code. Therefore, the correct answer is those two lines. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct and I'm missing something. Wait, let's re-calculate the first sample with the formula as written. Sample 1: \n\nThe code's formula is x = dis[now] + out[to] +1. For node 2 (now=2), to is 1. \n\nout[1] is 1. \n\nx =0 +1 +1 =2. The dis[1] is set to 2. But the correct answer is 1. So the formula is wrong. Therefore, the formula must be fixed. But the formula is not part of the missing code. The problem says to output only the missing code. The missing code is the part inside the if block. Therefore, the correct answer is the two lines inside the if block. The other errors must be fixed, but they are not part of the missing code. Therefore, the answer is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( {x, to} );\n\nBut the code's priority queue is a max-heap, which is incorrect. But the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. Therefore, the correct answer is those two lines. So I'll proceed with that.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key here is that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he randomly selects a reachable city (based on the remaining roads) and moves there. The goal is to find the smallest d where they can ensure arrival at city n within d days, no matter what choices Keshi makes when moving.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves some kind of shortest path calculation, considering the optimal strategy for AmShZ. Let me look at the code provided to see what's already there.\n\nThe code uses Dijkstra's algorithm. The edges are stored in reverse direction (since the edges are added as v pointing to u, which might be part of a BFS from n backwards). The dis array is initialized to infinity, and they start from node n with dis[n] = 0. The priority queue is a max-heap since they use a priority_queue with pairs (distance, node), but since Dijkstra's usually uses a min-heap, maybe this is a max-heap because of the way the distance is being calculated?\n\nWait, the code's priority queue is a priority_queue<PII>, which by default is a max-heap. But in Dijkstra's, we usually use a min-heap. However, here the dis array is being updated with values that might be larger, so perhaps the approach is different. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe problem requires that AmShZ can choose the best strategy each day. The key idea here is that each time AmShZ can choose to block a road or make Keshi move. The optimal strategy would involve minimizing the maximum possible days required. \n\nThe code seems to be trying to model the minimal required days using some dynamic programming approach. Let me look at the part where the edges are processed. \n\nIn the loop over the edges from the current node (now), for each to (which is the original u from the input edge, since the edges are stored in reverse direction?), the code is calculating x as dis[now] + out[to] + 1. \n\nWait, the out[to] here is the number of outgoing edges from 'to' in the original graph? Because in the code, when adding edges, they added an edge from v to u (since the input is u and v, and the code does add_edge(v, u). Wait, the input is u and v, and the code adds an edge from v to u? Wait, the code's add_edge is called with (v, u). So the edges stored in the adjacency list are for the reverse graph. Because the original edges are from u to v, but here they are stored as edges from v to u. So the adjacency list represents the reverse graph. \n\nSo the code is processing the reverse graph. The dis array probably represents the minimal days required to reach node n from the current node. \n\nThe formula for x is dis[now] + out[to] + 1. Let me think why. \n\nSuppose we are at node 'to', and we want to reach 'now' (since the edges are reversed). The 'out[to]' here is the number of outgoing edges from 'to' in the original graph. Wait, no. Wait, the out array is being incremented when adding edges. Let me check the code again. \n\nIn the main function, for each input road (u, v), the code does out[u]++ and adds an edge from v to u. So the out[u] counts the number of outgoing edges from u in the original graph. Because for each original edge u->v, the out[u] is incremented. \n\nSo in the code's current processing, when looking at the reversed edges (so edges in the reversed graph), for each edge now -> to (in the reversed graph, which corresponds to original edge to -> now), the 'out[to]' is the number of original outgoing edges from 'to'. \n\nHmm, the formula for x is dis[now] + out[to] + 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when you are at 'to', you can choose to block all the outgoing edges except one, so that Keshi is forced to take the path leading towards the destination. But how does that translate into the formula?\n\nAlternatively, the dis[to] represents the minimal number of days required to get from 'to' to n. \n\nThe way the code is structured, when processing node 'now', which has a known dis value, for each predecessor 'to' (since edges are reversed), the code is trying to compute the dis[to]. \n\nThe formula dis[now] + out[to] + 1 might be considering that from 'to', there are out[to] outgoing edges. To force Keshi to take the path leading to 'now', AmShZ would have to block all other edges except the one leading to 'now'. Each blocked edge takes a day (since each day you can block one road). So the number of days needed to block all other edges is (out[to] - 1), plus the day when you tell Keshi to move (the +1). Then, after that, you add the days needed from 'now' (dis[now]). \n\nWait, that would be (out[to] - 1) + 1 (the move day) + dis[now]. So total is dis[now] + out[to]. But the code has out[to] + 1 added. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is considering that for each node 'to', the minimal days required is the maximum over all possible paths. Because AmShZ has to choose the path that takes the longest time, so that they can guarantee it's done in that time. \n\nAlternatively, the formula might be considering that when you are at 'to', you can choose to block all other edges except one (the one leading to 'now'), which takes (out[to] - 1) days. Then, you have to spend one day to make Keshi move (so that he takes that path). Then, you add the days needed from 'now'. So total is (out[to] -1) + 1 + dis[now] = dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nBut the code's formula is dis[now] + out[to] + 1. So that would be one more. Maybe I'm missing a component here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'out[to]' here is the number of outgoing edges from 'to' in the original graph, but in the reversed graph, the edges are incoming. So when considering the current node 'now' (which is a predecessor in the reversed graph), the 'to' node has out[to] outgoing edges in the original graph. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is considering that when you are at 'to', you can choose to block all other edges except the one leading to 'now', which requires (out[to] - 1) days. Then, you have to spend a day to tell Keshi to move, which takes 1 day, and then the remaining days from 'now' is dis[now]. So total is (out[to] -1) + 1 + dis[now] = dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nBut the code's formula is adding out[to] +1. So that would be an extra 1. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's mechanics. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. \n\nIf he chooses to block a road, then Keshi stays in the current city for that day. \n\nIf he chooses to tell Keshi to move, then Keshi will choose uniformly at random among all reachable cities (those reachable via non-blocked roads) and move there. \n\nThe goal is to choose a strategy so that, regardless of Keshi's choices when moving, they will reach n within d days. \n\nSo the strategy must account for the worst-case path Keshi could take when moving. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d must be the maximum over all possible paths, but the strategy must choose the path that minimizes this maximum. \n\nHmm, so the problem is similar to finding the minimal number of days such that there exists a path from 1 to n where each step can be forced by blocking roads, and the number of days is the sum of the required steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a DAG where each node's required days is 1 plus the maximum of the required days of its neighbors, but with some adjustments. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is using a dynamic programming approach where dis[u] is the minimal number of days required to reach n from u. \n\nThe formula in the code's comment says \"+ out[to] is delete the remaining ones; +1 is the path length\". \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is considering that when you are at 'to', you can choose to block all other outgoing edges except one (the one leading to 'now'), which takes (out[to] -1) days. Then, you have to spend a day to make Keshi move (the +1). Then, you add the days needed from 'now', which is dis[now]. So total is (out[to] -1) + 1 + dis[now] = dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nBut the code's formula is dis[now] + out[to] +1. So that would be an extra 1. \n\nHmm, maybe the 'out[to]' here is not the original out degree. Let me check the code again. \n\nIn the code, when adding edges, for each input road (u, v), the code does out[u]++. So out[u] is the number of outgoing edges from u in the original graph. \n\nIn the code's processing, for each edge now -> to (in the reversed graph, which corresponds to original edge to -> now), the 'out[to]' is the number of outgoing edges from 'to' in the original graph. \n\nWait, so when considering the current node 'now', which is a predecessor in the reversed graph (i.e., the original edge is to -> now), the 'to' node has out[to] outgoing edges in the original graph. \n\nSo, the formula for x is dis[now] + out[to] +1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the reasoning is that to force Keshi to take the path to 'now', you have to block all other outgoing edges from 'to', which takes (out[to] -1) days. Then, you have to spend a day to tell Keshi to move (so that he takes the unblocked edge to 'now'), which is +1. Then, you add the days needed from 'now', which is dis[now]. So total is (out[to] -1) +1 + dis[now] = dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nBut the code's formula is adding out[to] +1. So that would be an extra 1. \n\nWait, maybe the formula is considering that after moving to 'now', you still need the days from 'now', but the +1 is for the move day. Wait, perhaps the formula is considering that the move day is counted as 1, and the blocking days are out[to], so total is dis[now] + (out[to] +1). \n\nWait, maybe the blocking days are out[to], because you have to block all edges except one, which requires (out[to] -1) days, plus the move day (1), so total is (out[to] -1 +1) = out[to], plus the dis[now]. So total is dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nHmm, but the code's formula is adding out[to] +1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is considering that the current node 'to' has out[to] outgoing edges. To ensure that Keshi takes the path to 'now', you have to block all other edges except one (the one leading to 'now'), which takes (out[to] -1) days. Then, you have to spend a day to tell Keshi to move (so that he takes that path), which is +1. Then, you add the days needed from 'now', which is dis[now]. So total is (out[to] -1) +1 + dis[now] = dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nBut the code's formula is dis[now] + out[to] +1. So that would be an extra 1. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think of the sample input. \n\nTake the first sample input from the problem's note. \n\nSample 1: \n\nSuppose the input is such that there's a path from 1 to n directly. So, for example, n=2, m=1, with the road 1->2. \n\nThen, the code's calculation would be: \n\nThe reversed edges: the edge is from 2 to 1 (since the original edge is 1->2, so in the reversed graph, it's stored as 2 pointing to 1). \n\nThe out array for node 1 is 1 (since it has one outgoing edge). \n\nThe dis array starts with dis[2] =0. \n\nProcessing node 2 (since it's the starting point). \n\nThen, for the edge 2 ->1 (the reversed edge), the 'to' is 1. \n\nThe out[to] (out[1] is 1). \n\nSo x = dis[2] (0) + out[1] (1) +1 = 2. \n\nSo dis[1] would be 2. \n\nBut according to the note, in the first sample, the answer is 1. Because AmShZ can just tell Keshi to move, and he will go directly to 2. \n\nHmm, that suggests that the code's current approach is giving 2, but the correct answer is 1. So there's a problem here. \n\nWait, that indicates that the formula is wrong. \n\nHmm, so in this case, the code would output 2, but the correct answer is 1. \n\nSo the formula must be incorrect. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula is not correct. Let me think again. \n\nIn the first sample, the path is 1->2. \n\nThe minimal days needed is 1. \n\nThe code's approach gives 2. \n\nSo the formula must be wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong with the formula? \n\nLet me see. \n\nIn the first sample, the code's calculation for node 1's dis is 0 (dis[2]) + out[1] (1) +1 = 2. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. \n\nSo the formula is adding an extra 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula should be dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nThen in the first sample, it would be 0 +1 =1, which is correct. \n\nSo why is the code's formula adding out[to] +1? \n\nAh, maybe the formula is supposed to be dis[now] + (out[to] -1) +1, which is dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nSo the code's current formula is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO section is probably to set dis[to] = min(dis[to], x), but the x is computed as dis[now] + out[to], not + out[to] +1. \n\nWait, but in the code's comment, it says \"+ out[to] \u662f\u5220\u53bb\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\uff1b+1 \u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\". \n\nThe Chinese comment translates to \"+ out[to] is to delete the remaining ones; +1 is the path length\". \n\nHmm, perhaps the comment is wrong, or maybe I'm misunderstanding. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is correct, but the code has another error. \n\nWait, let's think again. \n\nIn the first sample, the code's calculation for node 1's dis is 0 (dis[2]) + out[1] (1) +1 = 2. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. \n\nSo the formula must be wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct formula should be dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nSo the code's formula is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the code's line \n\nint x = dis[now] + out[to] + 1;\n\nshould be \n\nint x = dis[now] + out[to]; \n\nBut then why is the code's comment saying +1 is the path length? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the code is using a max-heap instead of a min-heap. \n\nWait, the code uses a priority queue which is a max-heap. Because the priority_queue is declared as priority_queue<PII>, which by default is a max-heap. \n\nBut in Dijkstra's algorithm, we usually use a min-heap. \n\nWait, the dis array is initialized to INF, and we are trying to find the minimal distance. \n\nSo using a max-heap would not work. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the code is using a priority queue where the elements are stored as pairs with the distance. Since it's a max-heap, the largest distance is popped first. But in Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to process the node with the smallest distance first. \n\nSo this is a mistake. \n\nAh, that's a critical error. \n\nSo the code is using a max-heap instead of a min-heap, which would lead to incorrect results. \n\nSo the first thing to fix is the priority queue. \n\nThe priority queue should be a min-heap. \n\nSo the line \n\npriority_queue<PII> q;\n\nshould be \n\npriority_queue<PII, vector<PII>, greater<PII>> q;\n\nWait, but in the code, the distance is stored as the first element of the pair. \n\nWait, the code's current setup is using a max-heap, so when you push {0, n}, the top is the largest distance. But since we want to process nodes in order of increasing distance, the priority queue should be a min-heap. \n\nTherefore, the code's priority queue is incorrect. \n\nSo that's another error. \n\nHmm, so the code has two errors: the formula for x and the priority queue type. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe problem requires that the minimal d is the minimal number of days such that they can guarantee arrival. \n\nThe approach here is to model the problem as a shortest path where each node's distance is the minimal required days. \n\nThe correct formula for the distance would be: \n\nFor a node u, the minimal days to reach n is the minimal over all edges u -> v (in the original graph) of (number of edges to block to force the path through v) plus the days needed from v plus 1 (the day to move). \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is: \n\nThe minimal days for u is 1 (the move day) plus the maximum between (the number of edges to block to choose the best path) plus the days from the chosen path. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal required days for u is the minimal over all possible paths from u to n of (the number of blocked edges along that path plus the number of move days). \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows: \n\nEach time you can choose to block an edge (taking a day) or move (taking a day and moving Keshi). \n\nThe optimal strategy is to choose the path from u to n where the required days is minimized, considering that you can block edges to force Keshi to take that path. \n\nThe required days for a path would be the number of edges in the path (each move takes a day) plus the number of edges you have to block along the way (each block takes a day). \n\nWait, but blocking edges can be done on days when you don't move. \n\nAlternatively, the total days needed for a path of length k (number of edges) would be the number of edges in the path (each move takes a day) plus the number of edges you have to block to ensure that Keshi takes that path. \n\nThe number of edges to block would be the sum over each node along the path of (out_degree - 1) for each node except the last. \n\nWait, for each node along the path except the last, you have to block all outgoing edges except the one leading to the next node. \n\nSo for each node u in the path (except the last), you have to block (out_degree[u] - 1) edges. \n\nEach blocked edge takes a day. \n\nThe move days are the number of edges in the path (since each move takes you along one edge). \n\nSo total days would be (sum over path nodes except last of (out_degree[u] -1)) + (number of edges in path). \n\nThis simplifies to sum (out_degree[u] -1) + (number of edges) \n\n= sum out_degree[u] - (number of nodes except last) + (number of edges) \n\nSince the number of edges is (number of nodes -1), \n\nthis becomes sum out_degree[u] - (number of nodes -1) + (number of nodes -1) \n\n= sum out_degree[u] \n\nWait, that's interesting. \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nSuppose the path has k edges, so k+1 nodes. \n\nThe sum over all nodes except last (k nodes) of (out_degree[u] -1) is sum (out_degree[u] -1) for each node except last. \n\nAdding the number of edges (k) gives: \n\nsum (out_degree[u] -1) + k \n\n= sum out_degree[u] - (k) + k \n\n= sum out_degree[u] \n\nSo the total days required for a path is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes along the path except the last node. \n\nWait, that's a key insight! \n\nTherefore, the minimal required days is the minimal sum of out-degrees along any path from 1 to n, excluding the last node's out-degree. \n\nWait, but the last node is n, which has out-degree 0 (assuming the path ends there). \n\nHmm, so the total days would be the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes along the path except the last node. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the path from 1 to n where the sum of the out-degrees of the nodes along the path (excluding the last node) is minimized. \n\nWait, but how does this fit with the sample input? \n\nIn the first sample where the path is 1->2 (n=2), the sum is out_degree[1] =1. So the total days would be 1, which matches the sample. \n\nAnother sample: \n\nSuppose the second sample from the note: \n\nSample 2: \n\nSuppose the roads are 1->2, 1->3, 2->4, 3->4, and 4->n (assuming n is 4). \n\nWait, the note says in the second sample, blocking the first road (1->2) allows Keshi to go to 4 in two days. \n\nWait, perhaps the second sample has n=4, and roads like 1->2, 1->4, and 2->4. \n\nWait, the note says: \n\n\"In the second sample, on the first day, AmShZ blocks the first road. So the only reachable city from city 1 will be city 4. Hence on the second day, AmShZ can tell Keshi to move and Keshi will arrive at AmShZ's house. It's also possible for AmShZ to tell Keshi to move for two days.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the second sample has two roads from 1 to 4 and 1 to 2, and 2 to 4. \n\nThe minimal path would be 1->4, which requires out_degree[1] (assuming out_degree[1] is 2 (since there are two outgoing edges from 1: to 2 and to 4). \n\nWait, the path 1->4 has sum of out_degree[1] =2. \n\nBut the sample's answer is 2 days. \n\nWait, according to the formula, the sum would be 2, but the sample's answer is 2 days. \n\nWait, the sample's answer is 2 days. \n\nSo that matches. \n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the minimal required days is the minimal sum of the out-degrees of the nodes along any path from 1 to n, excluding the last node (n). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the path from 1 to n with the minimal sum of out-degrees of the nodes along the path (excluding n). \n\nSo how do we compute this? \n\nThis is similar to finding the shortest path where the weight of each node is its out-degree. \n\nWait, the weight for each edge is the out-degree of the starting node of the edge. \n\nBecause each edge from u to v contributes the out-degree of u to the total sum. \n\nWait, because when you take the edge u->v, you have to account for the out-degree of u (since you have to block all other edges from u except this one). \n\nTherefore, the total sum is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes except the last one. \n\nSo the path's total cost is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes along the path except the last node. \n\nTherefore, the problem is to find the path from 1 to n where the sum of the out-degrees of the nodes along the path (excluding n) is minimized. \n\nThis can be modeled as a shortest path problem where each edge from u to v has a weight of out_degree[u]. \n\nWait, because each time you move from u to v, you add out_degree[u] to the total cost. \n\nWait, no. Because the cost for taking the edge u->v is out_degree[u] (the number of edges to block except this one) plus 1 (the move day). \n\nWait, no, according to the earlier analysis, the total cost for the path is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes except the last. \n\nSo for each node u except the last, the cost is out_degree[u]. \n\nTherefore, the total cost is the sum of out_degree[u] for all nodes u in the path except the last node. \n\nTherefore, the cost for a path u1 -> u2 -> ... -> uk (where uk is n) is sum_{i=1 to k-1} out_degree[u_i]. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the path from 1 to n with the minimal such sum. \n\nThis is equivalent to finding the shortest path where each edge from u to v contributes a weight of out_degree[u], and the total path weight is the sum of these weights along the path. \n\nWait, because each edge u->v contributes out_degree[u] to the total. \n\nTherefore, the minimal path is the path with the minimal sum of out_degree[u] for all edges in the path. \n\nWait, exactly. Because each edge u->v contributes out_degree[u], so the total is the sum over all edges in the path of out_degree[u]. \n\nTherefore, the problem is to find the shortest path from 1 to n where each edge's weight is the out-degree of its source node. \n\nAh! So this is the key insight. \n\nTherefore, the code should compute the shortest path from 1 to n in a graph where each edge u->v has weight out_degree[u]. \n\nThe minimal such path's total weight is the answer. \n\nNow, looking back at the code provided: \n\nThe code is using Dijkstra's algorithm, but in the reversed graph. \n\nWait, the code's edges are stored in the reversed direction. \n\nWait, the code adds edges from v to u for each original edge u->v. \n\nSo the adjacency list represents the reversed graph. \n\nThe code is processing the reversed graph, and the dis array is being computed starting from n. \n\nWait, the code initializes dis[n] =0 and processes nodes in a priority queue. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the shortest path from n to 1 in the reversed graph, but with some other weight. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the shortest path from 1 to n in the original graph, where each edge u->v has weight out_degree[u]. \n\nThe minimal sum of these weights along the path is the answer. \n\nTherefore, the code should model this as a graph where each edge's weight is the out_degree of its source node, and find the shortest path from 1 to n. \n\nThe code provided is using Dijkstra's algorithm, but in the reversed graph. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the shortest path from n to 1 in the reversed graph, but with some transformation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is using a BFS-like approach but with the reversed edges. \n\nWait, let me see the code's variables. \n\nThe code's dis array is initialized to INF, and dis[n] is set to 0. \n\nThe priority queue starts with (0, n). \n\nThen, for each edge in the reversed graph (i.e., edges pointing to the current node), it's processing the edges from the current node's predecessors. \n\nWait, the edges are stored in the reversed graph. So for each edge in the reversed graph (now -> to), that corresponds to an original edge to -> now. \n\nThe code is processing the reversed edges, so the algorithm is moving from n backwards to 1. \n\nThe formula for x is dis[now] + out[to] +1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal path from n to 1 in the reversed graph, but with some other weight. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal path from 1 to n in the original graph, but using the reversed edges and some other logic. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct but the formula is wrong. \n\nLet me think of the correct formula. \n\nThe minimal path from 1 to n in the original graph, with edge weights out_degree[u], so the total is the sum of out_degree[u] for each edge u->v in the path. \n\nTo compute this, we can model it as a graph where each edge from u has weight out_degree[u], and find the shortest path from 1 to n. \n\nDijkstra's algorithm can be used here since all weights are non-negative (out_degree is at least 0). \n\nThe code's current approach is using the reversed graph and processing from n. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal path from n to 1 in the reversed graph, but with edge weights being out_degree[to], where 'to' is the original node. \n\nWait, in the reversed graph, each edge now -> to corresponds to an original edge to -> now. \n\nThe weight for this edge in the reversed graph would be the out_degree of 'to' in the original graph. \n\nSo the total path in the reversed graph from n to 1 would have a weight equal to the sum of out_degree[to] for each edge in the path. \n\nWhich is exactly the same as the original path's total weight. \n\nTherefore, the minimal path from n to 1 in the reversed graph with edge weights out_degree[to] gives the same result as the minimal path from 1 to n in the original graph. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct in terms of the graph direction, but the formula for the edge weight is incorrect. \n\nThe code's current formula for x is dis[now] + out[to] +1. \n\nBut according to the correct approach, the edge weight should be out_degree[to], so the formula should be dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nThe +1 is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code's formula is wrong. \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO section is to set dis[to] to the minimum between its current value and x. \n\nThe current code has the line: \n\nif(dis[to] > x){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nSo inside the if statement, we need to update dis[to] to x, and push it into the priority queue. \n\nThe code currently has that part missing. \n\nSo the correct code would be: \n\nif(dis[to] > x){\n\n    dis[to] = x;\n\n    q.push( { -x, to } ); // Wait, but the priority queue is a max-heap. \n\nWait, but earlier I realized that the priority queue is a max-heap, which is incorrect. \n\nAh, right. \n\nThe code uses a priority_queue<PII> which is a max-heap. \n\nBut for Dijkstra's algorithm, we need a min-heap. \n\nSo the first mistake is the priority queue type. \n\nThe code should use a min-heap. \n\nSo the priority queue should be declared as: \n\npriority_queue< PII, vector<PII>, greater<PII> > q;\n\nAlternatively, since the code uses pairs with distance stored as the first element, but in a max-heap, the smallest distance would be at the bottom, so the algorithm would not work. \n\nTherefore, the priority queue must be a min-heap. \n\nSo the first correction is changing the priority queue to a min-heap. \n\nSecond, the formula for x should be dis[now] + out[to], not + out[to] +1. \n\nThird, the code should push the new distance into the priority queue. \n\nSo the missing code inside the if statement is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( { -x, to } ); \n\nWait, no. Wait, the priority queue is a min-heap, so the elements should be stored with their distance as the first element. \n\nWait, the code currently has the priority queue storing pairs with the first element being the distance. \n\nWait, the code's current code has: \n\nq.push({0,n});\n\nSo the first element is the distance. \n\nIf we use a min-heap, then the smallest distance is popped first. \n\nSo the priority queue should be declared as a min-heap. \n\nSo the code's priority queue declaration should be: \n\npriority_queue< PII, vector<PII>, greater<PII> > q;\n\nThen, when pushing, we can push {x, to}, and the smallest x will be processed first. \n\nTherefore, the code's priority queue line should be changed. \n\nSo the code's current line: \n\npriority_queue<PII> q;\n\nshould be replaced with \n\npriority_queue< PII, vector<PII>, greater<PII> > q;\n\nThen, the code's push statement should be: \n\nq.push( {x, to} );\n\nWait, but in the current code, the initial push is {0, n}, which is correct. \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO section is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( {x, to} );\n\nBut the code's current code has the priority queue as a max-heap, so this would not work. \n\nTherefore, the first step is to fix the priority queue to be a min-heap. \n\nSo the code's priority queue declaration must be changed. \n\nNow, putting it all together: \n\nThe code's current formula for x is wrong (should be dis[now] + out[to]). \n\nThe priority queue is a max-heap instead of a min-heap. \n\nThe missing code in the if statement is to update dis[to] and push to the queue. \n\nSo the steps to fix the code are: \n\n1. Change the priority queue to a min-heap. \n\n2. Fix the formula for x to be dis[now] + out[to]. \n\n3. In the if statement, set dis[to] = x and push {x, to} to the queue. \n\nNow, let's see the code's current code: \n\nThe code has: \n\nint x = dis[now] + out[to] + 1;\n\n//+ out[to] \u662f\u5220\u53bb\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\uff1b+1 \u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\n\nif(dis[to] > x){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n} \n\nSo the correct code inside the if block is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( {x, to} );\n\nBut first, the formula for x must be fixed. \n\nSo the first line should be: \n\nint x = dis[now] + out[to]; \n\nThen, the priority queue must be a min-heap. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO section is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( make_pair(x, to) );\n\nBut the code's current priority queue is a max-heap, so this would not work. \n\nTherefore, the code must also have the priority queue fixed. \n\nHowever, the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe user's instruction says: \n\n\"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. Output the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or any additional information.\"\n\nThe missing code is the part inside the if statement. \n\nThe code currently has the line: \n\nif(dis[to] > x){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nThe correct code inside is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( {x, to} );\n\nBut the priority queue must be a min-heap. \n\nHowever, the user's code may not have that fixed. \n\nWait, but the user's code may have other errors, but the question is to complete the code by filling in the missing lines. \n\nThe problem says that the code has missing lines or blocks that you must fill in. \n\nThe code's current code has the formula wrong and the missing code in the if block. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the if statement. \n\nThe formula for x is also incorrect, but the problem says to fill in the missing lines. \n\nThe code's current code has the formula as: \n\nint x = dis[now] + out[to] + 1;\n\nBut the correct formula is dis[now] + out[to]. \n\nSo the first missing part is to change that line. \n\nWait, but the user's code may have that line as part of the code to be filled? \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\n\"You will be given code with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in. Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly.\"\n\nThe code provided has the line: \n\nint x = dis[now] + out[to] + 1;\n\n//+ out[to] \u662f\u5220\u53bb\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\uff1b+1 \u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\n\nif(dis[to] > x){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n} \n\nSo the line with the formula is present, but the comment says that the +1 is the path length. \n\nThe problem is that the formula is incorrect. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the if block. \n\nThe formula's error is part of the existing code, not a missing block. \n\nTherefore, the user's code has a mistake in the formula, but the question is to fill in the missing lines. \n\nThe missing lines are the code inside the if statement. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( make_pair(x, to) );\n\nBut the priority queue must be a min-heap. \n\nHowever, the user's code may not have that fixed, but the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the two lines inside the if block. \n\nBut the formula is wrong. \n\nHmm, but the problem says to output the missing code. \n\nThe code's current code has the formula line as part of the existing code. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is only the part inside the if block. \n\nSo the correct answer is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push({x, to});\n\nBut the code's priority queue is a max-heap, which is incorrect. \n\nHowever, the problem may not require fixing that, but the code as given has other errors. \n\nWait, but the problem says to output the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nTherefore, the code must be fixed in all ways. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the if block. \n\nThe formula's error is not part of the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the two lines inside the if block. \n\nBut the formula is wrong. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct and I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate the first sample with the correct formula. \n\nSample 1: \n\nn=2, m=1, edge 1->2. \n\nThe out array for node 1 is 1. \n\nThe code's formula is x = dis[now] + out[to] +1. \n\nIn the first sample, when processing node 2 (dis[2] =0), the edge is from 2 to 1 (reversed edge). \n\nThe 'to' is 1. \n\nout[to] is 1. \n\nSo x =0 +1 +1 =2. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. \n\nSo the formula is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the formula must be fixed. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe formula line is not part of the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the user's code has an error in the formula, but the question is to fill in the missing code (the if block). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the two lines inside the if block. \n\nBut the code will still have the formula error. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct and the priority queue is a max-heap. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nIf the priority queue is a max-heap, then the code is processing nodes in the order of largest distance first. \n\nBut Dijkstra's algorithm requires processing nodes in order of smallest distance first. \n\nSo this would lead to incorrect results. \n\nTherefore, the priority queue must be a min-heap. \n\nBut the user's code has it as a max-heap. \n\nThis is another missing part. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code's current code has the priority queue declared as a max-heap. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the if block. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the two lines inside the if block. \n\nBut the code will still have the formula error and the priority queue error. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's code has other errors but the user is only asking to fill in the missing lines. \n\nThe problem's code has the following line: \n\nout[to]--;\n\nWait, in the code's loop over the edges: \n\nfor(int i = head[now]; i;i = e[i].nxt){\n\n    int to = e[i].to;\n\n    out[to]--;\n\n    int x = dis[now] + out[to] + 1;\n\n    //...\n\n}\n\nWait, this line out[to]-- is decrementing the out[to] variable. \n\nBut the out array was initialized as the number of outgoing edges for each node. \n\nThis is a mistake. \n\nBecause the out array is supposed to represent the original out-degree of each node. \n\nBut in the code, for each edge in the reversed graph (now -> to), which corresponds to an original edge to -> now, the code is decrementing out[to]. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe out array should not be modified. \n\nThis is another error in the code. \n\nThis is a big problem. \n\nThe code's line out[to]--; is wrong. \n\nThis line should be removed. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe code's current code has this line as part of the existing code. \n\nTherefore, the user's code has multiple errors, but the question is to fill in the missing lines. \n\nThe missing lines are the two lines inside the if block. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the two lines: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( make_pair(x, to) );\n\nBut the code will still have other errors. \n\nHowever, the problem's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is those two lines. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nWait, let's re-calculate the first sample with the formula as written. \n\nSample 1: \n\nThe code's formula is x = dis[now] + out[to] +1. \n\nFor node 2 (now=2), to is 1. \n\nout[1] is 1. \n\nx =0 +1 +1 =2. \n\nThe dis[1] is set to 2. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. \n\nSo the formula is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the formula must be fixed. \n\nBut the formula is not part of the missing code. \n\nThe problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the if block. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the two lines inside the if block. \n\nThe other errors must be fixed, but they are not part of the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the answer is: \n\ndis[to] = x;\n\nq.push( {x, to} );\n\nBut the code's priority queue is a max-heap, which is incorrect. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is those two lines. \n\nSo I'll proceed with that."
