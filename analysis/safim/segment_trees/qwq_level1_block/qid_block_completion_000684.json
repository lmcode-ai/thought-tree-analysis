So the odd indices have different parities. So the code would set flag to 0, so output NO. That would be the second test case. Yes, so in that case, the code would correctly output NO. So the code is correct. Now, putting all together, the missing code in the given code is: First, in the for loop for reading the array:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<n; i++) \n\n    cin >> a[i]; // this is the first missing part. Then, after that, the code needs to compute even_parity and odd_parity, and check all elements. So the code after the for loop (the reading loop) would be:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n} Wait, but in the code given, the code after the for loop (reading) is:\n\nif(flag) puts(\"YES\");\n\nelse puts(\"NO\"); So the code after reading the array must include the above code. So the missing code in the problem's code is: In the first TODO (the for loop for reading the array), the code is cin >> a[i];. Then, after that, the code must add the even_parity and odd_parity checks. So the code after the for loop (reading) would be:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n} So putting all together, the missing code is:\n\nIn the first loop (the for loop for reading the array), the code is:\n\ncin >> a[i];\n\nThen, after that, the code adds the even_parity and odd_parity checks. So the user's code has the first loop with the TODO, so the first missing code is the cin >> a[i]. Then, the rest of the code (the even_parity and checks) must be added after the for loop. So the code after the for loop (the reading loop) is:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) { if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the user's code currently has:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<n; i++) \n\n{\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n} So the first missing code is the cin >> a[i]; inside that loop.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if after any number of operations, the array can be made to have all even or all odd numbers. The operations are adding 1 to all odd indices or all even indices. Hmm, let's think about how these operations affect the elements.\n\nFirst, let me understand the operations. The first operation adds 1 to elements at positions 1,3,5 etc. (assuming 1-based index here, but in code arrays are 0-based). Wait, the problem says \"odd index\" but in programming terms, arrays are 0-based. Wait, the problem's description uses a_1, a_2, so the indices here are 1-based. So in code, when the array is stored as 0-based, the first element (a[0]) is the first element (a_1 in the problem), so the first operation affects a[0], a[2], etc. So the first operation is adding 1 to the elements at even indices (0,2,4...) and the second operation adds 1 to the odd indices (1,3,5...). Wait, no, the problem says \"even index\" in their terms. Let me clarify:\n\nProblem says for the first operation, add 1 to every element with an odd index (like a_1, a_3, etc). So in 1-based indices, the odd indices are 1,3,5..., so in 0-based, those are 0,2,4... So the first operation affects the 0-based even indices. The second operation adds 1 to even indices (like a_2, a_4 etc in 1-based, which are 1,3, etc in 0-based). So the first operation is adding to 0-based even indices, second to 0-based odd indices.\n\nSo each operation can be applied any number of times. The question is whether after some combination of these operations, all elements are even or all are odd.\n\nHmm, how can I model the effect of the operations?\n\nLet me think of each element's parity. Since adding 1 changes parity, each operation toggles the parity of certain elements. But since we can do the operations multiple times, the number of times each operation is done mod 2 is what matters for parity. Because doing an operation twice is equivalent to not doing it at all (since adding 2 doesn't change parity). Wait, but the problem allows any number of operations, so maybe considering modulo 2 is sufficient here?\n\nWait, but the problem requires that all elements have the same parity. So perhaps the key is to see if there's a way to choose the number of times each operation (even or odd) is applied (mod 2) such that all elements end up with the same parity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of each element can be adjusted by the number of times each operation is applied. Let me model each element's parity as a function of the number of times each operation is done.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x be the number of times we perform the first operation (add 1 to odd indices, i.e., 0-based even indices). Since each time we do this, the parity of those elements flips. So the total effect mod 2 is x mod 2.\n\nSimilarly, let y be the number of times we perform the second operation (add 1 to even indices, i.e., 0-based odd indices). The effect mod 2 is y mod 2.\n\nNow, for each element a_i (0-based index i):\n\nIf the element is at an even index (i is even, so it's part of the first operation's targets), then its parity is affected by x. So the total flips for this element is x mod 2.\n\nIf the element is at an odd index (i is odd, so part of the second operation's targets), then its parity is affected by y mod 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for each element at position i (0-based):\n\n- For the first operation (odd indices in problem's terms, which are even indices here), so if i is even, then each first operation adds 1, so the parity flips. So the number of times first operation is done (x) mod 2 affects this element's parity.\n\n- For the second operation (even indices in problem's terms, which are odd indices here), so if i is odd, then each second operation adds 1, so parity flips. So the number of times second operation (y) mod 2 affects this element's parity.\n\nTherefore, for each element a_i, its final parity is:\n\noriginal_parity_i + (x if i is even else 0) + (y if i is odd else 0) mod 2.\n\nWe want all elements to have the same parity. Let's denote the desired parity as either 0 (even) or 1 (odd). But since we can choose x and y, perhaps we can find x and y such that for all elements, their final parity is the same.\n\nAlternatively, the difference between any two elements' required parity must be compatible with x and y.\n\nLet me think of the parity equations for each element. Let me denote the original parity of a_i as p_i (0 or 1). The desired final parity for all elements is either 0 or 1. Let's see for each element:\n\nFor element i (0-based):\n\nfinal_parity = (p_i + (x if i even else 0) + (y if i odd else 0)) mod 2.\n\nWe need all final_parity to be equal. Let's say they must all be equal to some target (0 or 1). Let's see if there exists x and y (each 0 or 1) such that for all i, the above equation holds.\n\nAlternatively, since x and y can be 0 or 1, there are four possibilities. We can check for each possibility whether all elements can be made to have the same parity.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's consider the parity differences between elements.\n\nSuppose we have two elements, one at even index (i) and another at odd index (j). Let's see their equations:\n\nFor even index i (i is even):\n\nfinal_parity_i = (p_i + x) mod 2.\n\nFor odd index j (j is odd):\n\nfinal_parity_j = (p_j + y) mod 2.\n\nWe want these to be equal. So:\n\n(p_i + x) \u2261 (p_j + y) mod 2.\n\nWhich can be rearranged as x - y \u2261 (p_j - p_i) mod 2.\n\nHmm, but this must hold for all pairs of even and odd indices. Wait, perhaps the key is that for all even indices, their (p_i +x) must equal the same value, and for all odd indices, (p_j + y) must equal the same value, and those two values must be equal.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me consider that all even indices must have the same final parity, and all odd indices must have the same final parity. Wait, but the problem requires that all elements (both even and odd indices) have the same parity. So the final parity of even indices must equal the final parity of odd indices.\n\nSo for all even indices i:\n\nfinal_parity_i = (p_i + x) mod 2.\n\nFor all odd indices j:\n\nfinal_parity_j = (p_j + y) mod 2.\n\nWe need (p_i +x) \u2261 (p_j + y) mod 2 for all i even and j odd.\n\nSo, for any even i and odd j:\n\n(p_i +x) \u2261 (p_j + y) mod 2.\n\nRearranged: x - y \u2261 (p_j - p_i) mod 2.\n\nBut this must hold for all pairs of even and odd indices. Wait, but how can this be possible unless all (p_j - p_i) mod 2 are the same for all such pairs?\n\nAlternatively, let's pick two even indices and two odd indices and see.\n\nWait, perhaps the difference between the parity of even and odd elements must be consistent.\n\nLet me think of the difference between the parity of the first even element and the first odd element. Let's say the first even element (index 0) has parity p0, and the first odd element (index 1) has parity p1.\n\nThen, for their final parities to be equal:\n\n(p0 +x) \u2261 (p1 + y) mod 2.\n\nSimilarly, for another even index i and odd index j:\n\n(p_i +x) \u2261 (p_j + y) mod 2.\n\nBut substituting the first equation into the second, perhaps the difference between p_i and p_j must be the same as between p0 and p1?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose for even index i and odd index j:\n\n(p_i +x) - (p_j + y) \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\n=> (p_i - p_j) + (x - y) \u2261 0 mod 2.\n\nBut from the first pair (i=0, j=1):\n\n(p0 - p1) + (x - y) \u22610 mod2.\n\nSo (x - y) \u2261 (p1 - p0) mod2.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n(p_i - p_j) + (p1 - p0) \u22610 mod2.\n\n=> (p_i - p_j) \u2261 (p0 - p1) mod2.\n\nSo for all even i and odd j, the difference between p_i and p_j must be the same as between p0 and p1. Otherwise, there's no solution.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that for all even indices and odd indices, the parity differences between even and odd elements must be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parity of all even elements must have the same difference with the parity of all odd elements. Let me think of it this way:\n\nLet me denote D as the difference between the parity of an even element and an odd element. For all even and odd elements, this difference must be the same. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the parity of all even elements must be the same modulo 2, and similarly for all odd elements, and their difference must be such that x and y can adjust them to the same value.\n\nWait, let me think of the problem in terms of variables x and y. Let me suppose that we can choose x and y (each 0 or 1) such that:\n\nFor all even indices i: (p_i + x) mod2 = target.\n\nFor all odd indices j: (p_j + y) mod2 = target.\n\nThe target can be 0 or 1. So for each possible target (0 or 1), we can check if there exists x and y such that:\n\nFor all even i: p_i +x \u2261 target mod2 \u2192 x \u2261 (target - p_i) mod2.\n\nSimilarly, for all odd j: y \u2261 (target - p_j) mod2.\n\nSo for all even elements, the required x must be the same. Similarly, for all odd elements, the required y must be the same.\n\nSo, for a given target (0 or 1), check:\n\n- All even elements must have the same (target - p_i) mod2. That is, all even elements must have the same p_i mod2, or not?\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose target is 0. Then for even elements, x must be (0 - p_i) mod2. So for all even elements, (0 - p_i) mod2 must be the same. So all p_i must be the same mod2. Because if two even elements have different p_i, then (0-p_i) would differ, so x can't be both.\n\nSimilarly, for the odd elements, y must be (0 - p_j) mod2. So all p_j must be the same mod2.\n\nAlternatively, if target is 1, then for even elements, x must be (1-p_i) mod2. So all even elements must have the same (1-p_i) mod2 \u2192 same p_i mod2. Similarly for the odd elements.\n\nWait, so for a target to be possible, the following must hold:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: Target is 0.\n\nThen, all even elements must have the same p_i (so that x is fixed as (0-p_i) mod2 for all even elements). Also, all odd elements must have the same p_j (so that y is fixed as (0-p_j) mod2 for all odd elements). Additionally, the x and y must satisfy that (0-p_i) (for even) and (0-p_j) (for odd) can be chosen such that the equations hold. Wait, but x and y are determined by the even and odd elements respectively. So the only condition is that all even elements have the same p_i, and all odd elements have the same p_j. Then, x and y can be set accordingly, and then the target is 0. But also, the final parities must be equal. Wait, the target is the desired parity, so the even elements' final parity is (p_i +x) mod2 = target, and the odd's is (p_j + y) mod2 = target. So as long as all even elements have the same p_i, and all odd have same p_j, then x and y can be set to make their final parity target. But also, the target must be the same for both.\n\nWait, but even if all even elements have the same p_i and all odd have same p_j, then x and y can be set so that (p_i +x) = target and (p_j + y) = target. So for example, x = target - p_i mod2, y = target - p_j mod2. So that's possible. So in this case, the only condition is that all even elements have the same parity, and all odd elements have the same parity. Then, for either target (0 or 1), we can choose x and y accordingly. Wait, but the target must be the same for both even and odd. So the target can be chosen as either 0 or 1, but the required x and y must be such that both even and odd can reach that target.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the parities of the even elements must all be the same, and the parities of the odd elements must all be the same. Then, regardless of the target, we can choose x and y to set their parities to the same target. So in that case, the answer is yes.\n\nWait, but let me think of an example. Suppose even elements are all even (p_i =0), and odd elements are all odd (p_j=1). Then, to make all even:\n\nWe can set x=0 (so even elements stay even), and y=1 (so odd elements become even (1+1 mod2=0). So yes.\n\nAlternatively, to make all odd: x=1 (even elements become 1), y=0 (odd elements stay 1). So yes.\n\nSo in this case, it's possible.\n\nAnother example: even elements have mixed parities. Like even indices have p_i 0 and 1. Then, even if the odd elements are all same, the even elements can't be adjusted to a single parity. Because x can only be 0 or 1. So if some even elements are 0 and others 1, then choosing x=0 would leave some as 0 and others 1. Choosing x=1 would make them 1 and 0. So they can't all be same. So in that case, it's impossible.\n\nSo the condition is that all even elements have the same parity, and all odd elements have the same parity. Then, it's possible to choose x and y to make all even or all odd.\n\nWait, but what if the even elements are all even, and the odd elements are all even? Then, they already have same parity, so yes. Or if even elements are all odd and odd elements all even, then you can choose x and y to flip both to same.\n\nWait, so the necessary and sufficient condition is that all even-indexed elements have the same parity, and all odd-indexed elements have the same parity. Because then, you can choose x and y to adjust their parities to match each other.\n\nWait, but let me see another example. Suppose even elements are all even (parity 0), and odd elements are all even (parity 0). Then, they already have same parity, so yes.\n\nAnother case: even elements are all even (0), odd elements are all odd (1). Then, as before, possible.\n\nAnother case: even elements are all even, odd elements are all even. Then yes.\n\nAnother case: even elements have same parity, but odd elements have different parities. Wait, no, the condition requires that all odd elements have same parity. So if the odd elements have different parities, then the condition is not met, so answer is no.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether all elements at even indices have the same parity, and all elements at odd indices have the same parity. If that is true, then the answer is YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but let me test this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst test case: [1,2,1]. Let's see:\n\nIndices 0 (even), 1 (odd), 2 (even).\n\nParities: 1 (odd), 0 (even), 1 (odd).\n\nEven indices (0 and 2) have parities 1 and 1 \u2192 same. Odd index (1) has 0. So even elements are same, odd elements are same (only one element). So condition holds \u2192 answer is YES. Which matches the note.\n\nSecond test case: probably an array where even indices have different parities. Let's say like [1,2,3]. Even indices (0 and 2) have 1 and 1 \u2192 same. Odd index (1) has 0. So that would be okay. But the note says the second test case's answer is NO. Hmm, maybe I need to think of another example.\n\nWait the note says for the second test case, you can't make all same parity. Let me think of an example where even indices have same parity, but odd indices have same parity, but their parities are different. Then, can you make all same?\n\nSuppose even indices are all even (0), odd indices are all odd (1). Then, you can choose to set x=1 (so even indices become 1), and y=0 (so odd stay 1). So all become 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nAlternatively, if even indices are all 0, and odd are all 1, then you can choose to make all even (x=0, y=1 \u2192 odds become 0). So yes.\n\nWait, so in that case, the answer is yes. So when even and odd have same parities, then yes. But if even and odd have different parities, but their own groups are same, then you can choose to make all even or all odd. So the condition is that even and odd groups each have same parity. Then, the answer is yes.\n\nWait, so the only case when it's possible is when all even indices have same parity and all odd indices have same parity. Because then, you can choose x and y to set their parities to the same target.\n\nWait, so the problem reduces to checking whether all even indices have the same parity and all odd indices have the same parity. If that is true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but let me think of a case where even indices have same parity, odd indices have same parity, but different from even. Then, can you make all same?\n\nYes, as in the first example. So the condition is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the third note says all elements already have same parity. So even indices and odd indices each have same parity (since all same). So answer is yes.\n\nFourth test case: array like [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. The even indices (0,2,4) have parities even (0), and odd indices (1,3) have 0 (even). So even and odd groups are same. So you can choose to make all even (already are) or make all odd. To make all odd, you can do first operation once (add 1 to even indices). So their parities become 1, and the odds remain 0. Wait, no. Wait, after first operation (x=1), even indices (0,2,4) become 1001 (odd), and the odd indices (1,3) remain 0 (even). So then the parities are odd and even. Not all same. Wait, but according to the note, the fourth test case can be made all odd by doing one first operation. Wait, the note says the fourth test case's array is [1000,1,1000,1,1000]. Wait, original a_i are 1000,1,1000,1,1000. So even indices (0,2,4) have parities even (1000 is even, 1000 even, 1000 even). The odd indices (1,3) have 1 (odd) and 1 (odd). So even indices are all even, odd indices are all odd. So even and odd groups have same parity within their groups. So according to the condition, it's possible. The note says after first operation (add 1 to even indices), the even indices become 1001 (odd), so the array becomes [1001,1,1001,1,1001], all odd. So that works. So the condition holds.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Check if all elements at even indices (0,2,4...) have the same parity.\n\n- Check if all elements at odd indices (1,3,5...) have the same parity.\n\nIf both are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo now, how to code this.\n\nLooking at the given code:\n\nThe code has a loop over the test cases, and for each, reads n, then the array a[60], and a flag initialized to 1 (true). Then, in the for loop over the elements, the code is missing the part where the array is read. Wait, the code's for loop is for(int i=0; i<n; i++) { /* TODO: Your code here */ }\n\nSo first, the first missing part is to read the array elements. So inside the for loop, we need to read a[i], like cin >> a[i].\n\nBut after that, the code needs to check the parity conditions.\n\nSo after reading the array, we need to check:\n\nCheck even indices:\n\nTake the parity of a[0], then check all even indices (i even) have the same parity as a[0].\n\nSimilarly for odd indices: take the parity of a[1], then check all odd indices (i odd) have same parity as a[1].\n\nBut first, we have to handle the case when there are no odd indices (like n=1, but the problem says n >=2, so no). So for n >=2, there are at least one even and one odd.\n\nWait, n can be 2, so indices 0 and 1. So for even indices (0), and odd (1).\n\nSo steps:\n\nInitialize even_parity as a[0] %2.\n\nCheck all even indices (i even) have a[i]%2 == even_parity.\n\nSimilarly, odd_parity is a[1]%2.\n\nCheck all odd indices (i odd) have a[i]%2 == odd_parity.\n\nIf both checks pass, then flag remains 1, else set to 0.\n\nWait, but in code:\n\nThe flag is initially 1. So during the checks, if any condition fails, set flag to 0.\n\nSo the code after reading the array would need to:\n\nCheck even indices:\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i +=2) {\n\n   if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) flag=0;\n\n}\n\nSimilarly for odd indices:\n\nfor (int i=1; i <n; i +=2) {\n\n   if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) flag=0;\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, first compute even_parity and odd_parity, then loop through all elements.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n   if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n      if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n          flag=0;\n\n      }\n\n   } else {\n\n      if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n          flag=0;\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nWait, but this would work only if there is at least one even and one odd index. Since n >=2, so yes.\n\nWait, but what if n is 1? But the problem says n >=2, so no problem.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead the array first.\n\nThen compute even_parity as a[0]%2, odd_parity as a[1]%2.\n\nThen loop through all elements, checking each's parity against the respective group's parity.\n\nIf any element fails, set flag to 0.\n\nSo putting this into code.\n\nNow, the code given has the for loop for reading the array. The first missing part is to read the array elements. So inside the for loop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\ncin >> a[i];\n\nThen, after reading the array, compute even_parity and odd_parity.\n\nWait, but in the code structure, the for loop is already there for reading. So the first missing code is to read the array elements. So the first TODO is to read a[i].\n\nThen, after that, the code needs to check the parity conditions.\n\nSo the code after reading the array would have:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in code, the flag is initialized to 1. So once any of the conditions fail, flag is set to 0, and remains 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nAfter reading the array:\n\neven_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nfor (int i=2; i <n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n        flag=0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nodd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=3; i <n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n        flag=0;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but this requires that there is at least one element in the odd indices. Since n >=2, the first odd index (1) exists. So for the odd indices, starting from 3 may miss index 1? No, the first loop for even indices starts at 0, then 2, etc. The odd indices loop starts at 1, then 3, etc. So perhaps better to loop through all even indices except 0, and check against a[0]'s parity.\n\nAlternatively, the first approach of looping through all elements and checking each's parity is better.\n\nSo putting all together, the code after reading the array would be:\n\n// Read the array first.\n\nfor(int i=0; i<n; i++) \n\n    cin >> a[i]; // this is the first missing part.\n\nThen, after that:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but what if there are no elements in the odd indices? But n >=2, so at least one even and one odd.\n\nWait, for n=2, indices 0 and 1. So the code works.\n\nAnother case: n=3. indices 0,1,2. The even indices are 0 and 2, odd is 1.\n\nSo the code checks all even indices (0 and 2) against a[0]'s parity, and the odd (1) against a[1]'s parity.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, in the given code's structure, the for loop for reading the array is already present, so the first missing code is the cin >> a[i].\n\nThen, after that, the code needs to compute even_parity and odd_parity, and loop through the array to check.\n\nSo the code after the for loop (the reading loop) would have:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code given, after the for loop (the reading loop), the code is inside the while(t--) loop. So the code after reading the array would be:\n\nInside the while loop:\n\n...\n\nfor reading the array.\n\nThen:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the code given, the flag is initialized to 1. So this code would set flag to 0 if any element fails.\n\nWait, but what if the array has only even indices (like n=1, but n is at least 2). So no problem.\n\nWait, but in the case where there are no odd indices (n=1?), but the problem says n >=2, so okay.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let me check the sample input 2 from the note, which is supposed to output NO.\n\nSuppose the array is like [1,2,3]. Even indices (0 and 2) have parities 1 and 1 (same). Odd index (1) has 0. So even and odd groups are same within themselves \u2192 answer is YES. But the note says the second test case's answer is NO. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the second test case.\n\nWait the note says for the second test case, you can't make all same. Let me think of an example where even indices have same parity but odd indices have different.\n\nWait, for example, array [1,2,3,4]. Even indices (0,2) have 1 and 1 (parity 1 and 1 \u2192 same). Odd indices (1,3) have 0 and 0 (parity 0 \u2192 same). So answer is YES. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother example where even indices have same parity but odd indices have different parities. Like array [1,2,3,5]. The even indices (0,2) are 1 and 1 (parity 1). The odd indices (1,3) are 0 and 1 (parities 0 and 1). So the odd indices have different parities. So the code would set flag to 0, so output NO. That would be the second test case.\n\nYes, so in that case, the code would correctly output NO.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, putting all together, the missing code in the given code is:\n\nFirst, in the for loop for reading the array:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<n; i++) \n\n    cin >> a[i]; // this is the first missing part.\n\nThen, after that, the code needs to compute even_parity and odd_parity, and check all elements.\n\nSo the code after the for loop (the reading loop) would be:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code given, the code after the for loop (reading) is:\n\nif(flag) puts(\"YES\");\n\nelse puts(\"NO\");\n\nSo the code after reading the array must include the above code.\n\nSo the missing code in the problem's code is:\n\nIn the first TODO (the for loop for reading the array), the code is cin >> a[i];.\n\nThen, after that, the code must add the even_parity and odd_parity checks.\n\nSo the code after the for loop (reading) would be:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo putting all together, the missing code is:\n\nIn the first loop (the for loop for reading the array), the code is:\n\ncin >> a[i];\n\nThen, after that, the code adds the even_parity and odd_parity checks.\n\nSo the user's code has the first loop with the TODO, so the first missing code is the cin >> a[i].\n\nThen, the rest of the code (the even_parity and checks) must be added after the for loop.\n\nSo the code after the for loop (the reading loop) is:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the user's code currently has:\n\nfor(int i=0; i<n; i++) \n\n{\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the first missing code is the cin >> a[i]; inside that loop.\n\nThen, after that loop, the code must add the even_parity and odd_parity checks.\n\nSo the code after the for loop (the reading loop) is the code I wrote above.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nInside the first for loop (reading the array):\n\ncin >> a[i];\n\nThen, after the for loop, the code:\n\nint even_parity = a[0]%2;\n\nint odd_parity = a[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    if (i%2 ==0) {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != even_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if (a[i]%2 != odd_parity) {\n\n            flag =0;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the user's code's missing parts are these lines.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly.
