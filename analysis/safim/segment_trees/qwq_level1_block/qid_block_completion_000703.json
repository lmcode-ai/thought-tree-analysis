We need to choose x and y such that:\n\nFor odd indices (1): 1 +x mod2 =0 \u2192 x must be 1 mod2. For even indices (2): 0 + y mod2 =0 \u2192 y must be 0 mod2. So x is 1, y is 0.

So perhaps the initial array was [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. After adding 1 to odd indices (positions 1,3,5), the array becomes [1001,0,1001,0,1001]. The even indices (positions 2 and 4) are still 0 (even). So the note's example must have a different initial array. Ah, perhaps the fourth test case's initial array is [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000].",

Thus, the code's logic is correct. The earlier example I thought of (array [1,2]) would be a case where the code outputs YES, but the sample's second test case is different. Thus, the code's logic is correct. Thus, the missing code in the TODO is to set m to true when the even index element's parity doesn't match 'two'. In the code's loop:\n\nif (i%2 ==0) { // even index (1-based)\n\n   if (r != two) {\n\n      m = true;\n\n   }\n\n} else { ... } Thus, the missing code is to set m to true in that case. The current code has:\n\nif (i%2 ==0) {\n\n   if (r != two) {\n\n      /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   }\n\n} else {\n\n   if (r != one) {\n\n      m = true;\n\n   }\n\n} Thus, the TODO should be to set m = true. So the missing code is:\n\nm = true;\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nif (r != two) {\n\n    m = true;\n\n} Hence, the answer is to fill the TODO with m = true;\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nm = true; So the code's loop becomes:\n\nfor(int i=3; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    int p=s.nextInt();\n\n    int r=p%2;\n\n    if(i%2==0) {\n\n        if(r!=two) {\n\n            m = true;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if(r!=one) {\n\n            m=true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, the code will set m to true if any element's parity doesn't match the first or second element's parity for their respective indices. If m remains false, then all elements match the first and second's parities for their indices, so the answer is YES. Thus, the code is correct with this fix. The earlier confusion was due to a misinterpretation of the sample's second test case. The code's logic is correct.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this Java code to solve the problem. The problem is about determining if we can make all elements in an array have the same parity (all even or all odd) using two types of operations. The operations are adding 1 to all odd indices or all even indices any number of times.\n\nHmm, the existing code seems to read the inputs and starts processing. Let me look at what's there. The code reads t test cases. For each case, it reads n, then a and b (the first two elements of the array). Then it initializes one and two as 1, then checks if a (the first element) is even, setting one to 0. Similarly for b (the second element) and two. Then there's a loop from i=3 to n, reading each next element p. It checks if the current index i is even or odd. For even i, if the remainder r (p%2) isn't equal to two, then there's a TODO. For odd i, if r isn't equal to one, set m to true. Finally, if m is false, output YES else NO.\n\nWait, I think the approach here is trying to track the parity of the elements after some operations. But maybe the logic is flawed. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe key is to find if there's a way to apply the operations such that all elements end up with the same parity. Let's think about each operation's effect:\n\nEach time you do an odd-index operation (add 1 to all odd indices), it flips the parity of those elements. Similarly, even-index operation flips the parity of even indices. Because adding 1 changes even to odd and vice versa. So each operation toggles the parity of their respective indices.\n\nThe problem is to find if there exists some number of odd and even operations (let's call them x and y) such that after x odd operations and y even operations, all elements have the same parity.\n\nLet me model this. Let's consider each element's parity after x and y operations.\n\nFor an element at position i (1-based?), let's see:\n\nIf i is odd: the number of times it's been incremented is x (since each odd op adds 1, so parity flips x times). So the total parity change is x mod 2.\n\nSimilarly, for even i: the parity changes y mod 2 times (from even ops).\n\nThe initial parity of a_i is (a_i % 2). After the operations, the new parity is:\n\nFor odd i: (a_i_initial_parity + x) mod 2.\n\nFor even i: (a_i_initial_parity + y) mod 2.\n\nWe want all elements to have the same parity. Let's say the target parity is T (0 for even, 1 for odd). So for all elements:\n\nFor odd indices: (a_i_parity + x) mod 2 = T\n\nFor even indices: (a_j_parity + y) mod 2 = T\n\nWe can rearrange these equations:\n\nx \u2261 T - a_i_parity mod 2 (for all odd i)\n\ny \u2261 T - a_j_parity mod 2 (for all even j)\n\nSo for all odd indices, their required x must be the same. Similarly for even indices and y.\n\nSo, the idea is that all the odd indices must have the same required x (mod 2), and all even indices must have the same required y (mod 2). Then, we can choose x and y such that they satisfy these equations for some T (either 0 or 1).\n\nWait, but T can be either 0 or 1. So we need to check for both possibilities of T (all even or all odd) and see if there exists x and y that satisfy the conditions for that T.\n\nAlternatively, for each T in {0,1}, check if:\n\nAll odd elements' (a_i_parity + x) mod 2 == T, and all even elements' (a_j_parity + y) mod 2 == T.\n\nBut x and y must be chosen such that x \u2261 (T - a_i_parity) mod 2 for all odd i, and similarly for y and even j.\n\nSo for all odd indices, the (a_i_parity) must have the same value when subtracted from T mod 2. Similarly for even indices.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take T as the target parity. For all odd indices i:\n\n(a_i_parity + x) mod 2 = T \u2192 x \u2261 (T - a_i_parity) mod 2.\n\nThis must hold for all odd i. So all the (T - a_i_parity) mod 2 for odd i must be the same. Similarly, for even indices, (T - a_j_parity) mod 2 must be the same for all even j. Because y has to be the same for all even indices.\n\nTherefore, for a given T, the required x is determined by the first odd element, and all other odd elements must agree. Similarly for y and even elements.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCheck for both possible T (0 and 1). For each T:\n\n- Check if all odd elements have the same (T - a_i_parity) mod 2.\n\n- Check if all even elements have the same (T - a_j_parity) mod 2.\n\nIf for either T, both conditions are true, then it's possible. So the answer is YES.\n\nElse, check the other T. If neither works, answer is NO.\n\nSo the code needs to check these conditions for both T=0 and T=1.\n\nHmm, the existing code in the problem's code seems to be trying a different approach, perhaps tracking the parity of the first two elements and then checking others. But maybe it's not correct.\n\nLooking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code starts by reading the first two elements a and b. Then sets one and two to 1, then if a is even, sets one to 0. Similarly for two and b. Then in the loop for the rest of the elements (starting from i=3, which is the third element, so index 3 (assuming 1-based?), so that's an odd index again?), it checks if the current element's parity (r = p%2) matches one or two depending on the index.\n\nWait, the code's variables 'one' and 'two' are initialized as 1, then set to 0 if the first element (a) is even, and similarly for two (the second element b). Then for each next element (starting from i=3), which is the third element (index 3, which is odd), so for i%2 ==1 (since i starts at 3?), the code checks if r (the parity of p) is not equal to 'one', then sets m to true. Wait, but the code's logic here is unclear. The 'm' is a flag that if set to true, the answer is NO. But perhaps the code is trying to see if all elements have the same parity as the first two, but that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the required parity for odd and even indices. But perhaps the approach is incorrect, leading to wrong answers.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to check for both possible T (0 and 1) and see if the conditions hold. Let's think how to implement this.\n\nLet me outline the steps for each test case:\n\n1. Read the array elements.\n\n2. For each T in {0, 1}:\n\n   a. For all odd indices (1-based), check if (a_i_parity + x) mod 2 == T. Here, x must be the same for all odd indices. So the required x for each odd element is (T - a_i_parity) mod 2. All these must be the same. So collect all (T - a_i_parity) mod 2 for odd indices and check if they are all the same.\n\n   b. Similarly for even indices, check if all (T - a_j_parity) mod 2 are the same. Let's call that required y.\n\n   c. If both a and b are true, then this T is possible. So return YES.\n\n3. If either T=0 or T=1 satisfies the above, then answer is YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, for each test case, we can loop through the array, collect the parities of the elements. Then for each T, check the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, for each T, we can:\n\n- For all odd indices, compute (T - (a_i %2)) mod 2. All these must be equal (since x must be same for all).\n\n- For all even indices, compute (T - (a_j%2)) mod 2. All must be equal (y same for all).\n\nIf both groups have all same values, then possible.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nFirst, in code:\n\nRead the array as a list or array. Let's say we have an array arr of size n.\n\nThen for T in 0 and 1:\n\n   check_odd = true;\n\n   first_x = (T - (arr[0]%2)) %2; // since first element is index 0 (0-based?), or 1-based?\n\nWait, need to clarify indices. Let's assume the array is 0-based (since in Java, arrays are 0-based). So for 1-based in problem description, the first element is index 0 here.\n\nWait, the problem says the array is a_1, a_2,...a_n. So in code, when we read the elements, the first element is a[0], which is a_1 in the problem.\n\nSo for the first element (a_1), it's an odd index (1), so in code (0-based index 0) is odd index (1). So for all elements with (i+1) being odd, i.e., i is even (0-based), they are odd indices (1,3,5 etc). Wait, 0-based index 0 is position 1 (odd), index 1 is position 2 (even), etc.\n\nSo for each element at 0-based index i:\n\nif (i % 2 ==0) \u2192 it's an odd index (since 0 \u21921, 2\u21923, etc).\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe problem's indices are 1-based. So for the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, the first element is at position 1 (odd), second at 2 (even), third at 3 (odd), etc.\n\nIn code, when stored in an array as 0-based, the index i (0-based) corresponds to position (i+1) in the problem. So:\n\nposition is odd \u2192 (i+1) is odd \u2192 i is even (0,2,4...)\n\nposition is even \u2192 i is odd (1,3,5...)\n\nSo for each element in the array:\n\nif (i %2 ==0 \u2192 even index (0-based) \u2192 corresponds to odd position (1,3,5...)\n\nelse \u2192 even position (2,4,6...)\n\nSo for each element, we can check whether it's in an odd or even position (problem's terms) based on its 0-based index.\n\nSo for each T (0 or 1):\n\nCheck for all elements in odd positions (i even in 0-based):\n\nCompute required_x = (T - (arr[i]%2)) mod 2.\n\nAll these required_x must be the same. Let's call the first required_x as first_x. Then check all others are equal to first_x.\n\nSimilarly for even positions (i odd in 0-based):\n\nrequired_y = (T - (arr[i]%2)) mod 2. All must be same.\n\nIf both conditions are met for any T, then possible.\n\nSo in code, for each test case:\n\nRead n, then read the array.\n\nThen for T in 0 and 1:\n\n   boolean possibleForT = true;\n\n   // Check for odd positions (i even in 0-based)\n\n   int required_x = -1;\n\n   for (int i=0; i <n; i +=2) { // step by 2 to get all even indices (0,2,4...)\n\n       int current_parity = arr[i]%2;\n\n       int req = (T - current_parity +2) %2; // to handle negative mod?\n\n       if (required_x == -1) {\n\n           required_x = req;\n\n       } else {\n\n           if (req != required_x) {\n\n               possibleForT = false;\n\n               break;\n\n           }\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n   if (!possibleForT) continue;\n\n   // Now check even positions (i odd in 0-based)\n\n   int required_y = -1;\n\n   for (int i=1; i <n; i +=2) {\n\n       int current_parity = arr[i]%2;\n\n       int req = (T - current_parity +2) %2; // mod 2\n\n       if (required_y == -1) {\n\n           required_y = req;\n\n       } else {\n\n           if (req != required_y) {\n\n               possibleForT = false;\n\n               break;\n\n           }\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n   if (possibleForT) {\n\n       return \"YES\";\n\n   }\n\nIf either T=0 or T=1 passes, then output YES. Else, NO.\n\nSo the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nNow, looking back at the given code, the current code is not following this approach. The existing code is trying to track the first two elements and then check others, but perhaps it's not considering both T options.\n\nThe existing code's variables 'one' and 'two' are set based on the first two elements. Then for each next element (starting from i=3, which is the third element, which is index 2 in 0-based, so an odd position (since 2+1=3 is odd). Wait, the loop in the code is for i from 3 to n. Wait, the code's loop is written as for(int i=3; i<=n; i++), but in Java, arrays are 0-based. So perhaps the code is using 1-based indices here. Let me see:\n\nThe code reads the first element as a = s.nextInt(); then b = s.nextInt(); then the loop starts from i=3 (so third element, which would be the third element in the array, which is index 2 in 0-based). So the code is treating the elements as 1-based. So the first element is a_1 (stored in a), second a_2 (b), then the loop for i from 3 to n (since n is the length). So the code is using 1-based indices.\n\nIn that case, the code's variables 'one' and 'two' are tracking the parity of the first (odd) and second (even) elements. Then for each next element (i from 3 to n), which is the ith element (1-based), so if i is even (like 4), it's even index, so check against 'two', else check against 'one'.\n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nFor each element after the first two (starting at i=3, which is the third element, which is an odd index (3)), so for i%2 ==0 (even index?), no. Wait, the code's loop variable i is the 1-based index. So for i=3 (third element, which is an odd index (3)), so in the code's code:\n\nif (i%2 ==0) \u2192 even index \u2192 check against 'two' (which was set based on the second element's parity). Else (odd index), check against 'one' (first element's parity).\n\nThe code then checks if the current element's parity (r = p%2) matches the stored 'one' or 'two' variables. If not, then m is set to true. Wait, but the code's 'm' is set to true only when for an odd index, the parity doesn't match 'one'. For even indices, if it doesn't match 'two', there's a TODO.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nInside the for loop (i from 3 to n):\n\nint p = s.nextInt();\n\nint r = p%2;\n\nif (i%2 ==0) { // even index (since i is 1-based)\n\n   if (r != two) {\n\n      /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   }\n\n} else { // odd index\n\n   if (r != one) {\n\n      m = true;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nSo the code is trying to see if all elements at odd indices have the same parity as the first element (a's parity), and even indices same as the second (b's parity). If any element deviates, set m to true. Then, if m is false, output YES else NO.\n\nWait, but that's only checking if all elements have the same parity as their first element's parity. But that's not the right condition. Because the operations can change the parities. The code's approach is incorrect.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input given in the problem's note:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2 1\n\nThe first array is [1,2,1]. The first element is 1 (odd), second 2 (even). The third is 1 (odd). So according to the code's logic, the third element (i=3, odd index) has parity 1, which matches 'one' (since a was 1, so one was 1). So no problem. The second element (b) is even, so two is 0. So the code would set m to false, so output YES. Which matches the sample's answer. But that's correct here.\n\nAnother sample: the second test case in the note is:\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\nThe array is [1,2]. The code would check that the second element (even index) has parity 0 (even), which matches 'two' (since b was 2, so two is 0). So m remains false \u2192 output YES? But the sample says the answer is NO. Wait, that's a problem. Wait the sample's second test case's answer is NO. So according to the code's logic, it would output YES, which is wrong. So the code is incorrect.\n\nAh, so the code's approach is wrong. Hence, the code needs to be fixed.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to check for both T options as I thought earlier.\n\nSo the code needs to be rewritten. But the problem says to complete the given code, adding the missing parts. Let me look again at the code's structure.\n\nThe existing code's loop for the remaining elements (after the first two) has a TODO in the even index case. The code's variables 'one' and 'two' are set based on the first two elements' parity. The code's 'm' is set to true if any odd-indexed element (after the first) has a different parity than the first element. But for even indices, it's not handled (the TODO is there).\n\nSo perhaps the original code's intention was to track the parity of the first elements and ensure all others follow, but that's not sufficient. The correct approach requires checking for both T options.\n\nHmm, but given that the user wants to complete the existing code, perhaps the code's logic can be adjusted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be rephrased as follows: the operations can be applied any number of times, so the parity changes can be toggled any number of times. Since each operation toggles the parity of the elements in their indices, the number of times you apply the operation mod 2 determines the final parity.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to whether all elements can be made to have the same parity by choosing x (number of odd operations mod 2) and y (even operations mod 2).\n\nThe final parity for each element is:\n\nFor odd indices: initial_parity + x mod 2.\n\nFor even indices: initial_parity + y mod 2.\n\nWe want all elements to be equal to T (either 0 or 1).\n\nSo for all odd indices: (a_i_parity + x) mod 2 = T \u2192 x \u2261 (T - a_i_parity) mod 2.\n\nFor all even indices: (a_j_parity + y) mod 2 = T \u2192 y \u2261 (T - a_j_parity) mod 2.\n\nThus, for all odd indices, the required x must be the same. Similarly for even indices and y.\n\nSo for a given T, the required x is fixed (based on first odd element), and all other odd elements must agree. Same for even elements and y.\n\nThus, for each T in 0 and 1:\n\nCheck if all odd elements have the same (T - a_i_parity) mod 2.\n\nCheck if all even elements have the same (T - a_j_parity) mod 2.\n\nIf both are true for any T, then possible.\n\nSo the code needs to implement this.\n\nNow, how to do this in the existing code structure?\n\nThe existing code reads the first two elements (a and b). Then reads the rest in a loop. The variables 'one' and 'two' are set to 1 if the first element is odd, 0 otherwise. Similarly for two and the second element.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be adjusted to track the required conditions for both T options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be restructured to compute for both T options.\n\nLet me think of the code steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n, then read all elements into an array.\n\nThen, for T in 0 and 1:\n\n   check_odd = true;\n\n   required_x = (T - (arr[0]%2)) %2; // first element (odd index)\n\n   for each odd index (i even in 0-based):\n\n       current_parity = arr[i]%2;\n\n       req = (T - current_parity) %2;\n\n       if req != required_x \u2192 check_odd = false; break;\n\n   if check_odd is false \u2192 continue.\n\n   check_even = true;\n\n   required_y = (T - (arr[1]%2)) %2; // second element (even index)\n\n   for each even index (i odd in 0-based):\n\n       current_parity = arr[i]%2;\n\n       req = (T - current_parity) %2;\n\n       if req != required_y \u2192 check_even = false; break;\n\n   if check_even \u2192 then possible, return YES.\n\nIf neither T works \u2192 output NO.\n\nThus, the code can be written this way.\n\nBut the existing code is not structured this way. The current code's variables 'one' and 'two' are set based on the first two elements' parity. The loop for the remaining elements is checking if their parity matches the first or second's parity. But that's only considering T being the parity of the first element for odd indices and second for even indices. Which is only one of the possible T options.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to see if all elements can have the same parity as the first element (for odd indices) and second (for even indices). But that's not sufficient. Because maybe after some operations, the parities can be adjusted to another T.\n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is to see if all elements have the same parity as the first element (for odd indices) and second (for even indices). If so, then by not doing any operations (x=0, y=0), the array already has all elements with their current parities. But that's only one possibility (T being the first element's parity for odds and second for evens). But the problem allows any T.\n\nHmm, so the code's current approach is only checking if the array already has all elements with the same parity as their first element's parity (for odd indices) and second's (for even indices). But that's not sufficient. Because even if they don't, maybe applying some operations can make them all even or all odd.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect, and needs to be fixed.\n\nGiven that the user wants to complete the existing code, perhaps the missing part in the TODO is to set m to true when the even index element's parity doesn't match 'two'. But even that would only check if all elements have the same parity as their first element's parity for odd indices and second for even indices. Which is not sufficient.\n\nWait, looking at the code's current structure:\n\nThe code reads the first two elements a and b. Then sets one and two to 1 (assuming they are odd), then if a is even, sets one to 0. Similarly for two and b.\n\nThen, for each next element (starting from i=3, which is the third element, which is an odd index (3)), the code checks if it's parity matches 'one' (for odd indices) or 'two' (for even indices). If any of them don't match, m is set to true. Then, if m is false, output YES else NO.\n\nSo the code is checking whether all elements have the same parity as the first element (for odd indices) and second (for even indices). If so, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut this is only one possible scenario. For example, if the first element is even and the second is odd, then the code would require all odd indices to be even and even indices to be odd. But maybe we can apply operations to flip all to even or all to odd.\n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. So the correct approach requires checking both T options.\n\nTherefore, the existing code needs to be restructured. But since the user wants to complete the given code, perhaps the code can be adjusted to handle both T options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as follows:\n\nThe difference between the parities of the first and second elements must allow for a possible T.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's see what conditions must be met for the answer to be YES.\n\nSuppose after some x and y operations, all elements have the same parity T.\n\nThen for all odd indices: (a_i_parity + x) mod 2 = T \u2192 x \u2261 (T - a_i_parity) mod 2.\n\nFor all even indices: (a_j_parity + y) mod 2 = T \u2192 y \u2261 (T - a_j_parity) mod 2.\n\nThus, for all odd indices, the (T - a_i_parity) mod 2 must be the same (since x is fixed). Similarly for even indices.\n\nSo for all odd indices, the (a_i_parity) must have the same value mod 2 when subtracted from T. So the difference between T and a_i_parity must be the same for all odd indices.\n\nSimilarly for even indices.\n\nThus, the difference between the parities of any two odd indices must be the same as their difference from T. Wait, perhaps the key is that for all odd indices, their parities must be congruent mod 2 (i.e., all have the same parity) or something else?\n\nAlternatively, the difference between any two odd indices' parities must be the same as (T - a_i_parity) and (T - a_j_parity) must be the same. So (T - a_i_parity) mod 2 must equal (T - a_j_parity) mod 2 \u2192 (a_i_parity - a_j_parity) mod 2 must be 0 \u2192 a_i_parity == a_j_parity mod 2.\n\nWait, that's an important point. For all odd indices, their parities must be the same. Because (T - a_i_parity) mod 2 must be the same for all i (odd indices). So (T - a_i_parity) \u2261 (T - a_j_parity) mod 2 \u2192 a_i_parity \u2261 a_j_parity mod 2. So all odd indices must have the same parity.\n\nSimilarly, all even indices must have the same parity.\n\nIf that's the case, then it's possible to choose x and y such that:\n\nx = (T - a_odd_parity) mod 2,\n\ny = (T - a_even_parity) mod 2.\n\nThen, all odd indices will have parity T, and even indices will have parity T.\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition is that all odd indices have the same parity, and all even indices have the same parity.\n\nBecause then, we can choose T to be either the parity of the odd indices or the even indices, and adjust x and y accordingly.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose all odd indices have parity P, and all even indices have parity Q.\n\nThen, to make all elements have the same parity T:\n\nWe need:\n\nFor odd indices: P + x \u2261 T mod 2 \u2192 x \u2261 T - P mod 2.\n\nFor even indices: Q + y \u2261 T mod 2 \u2192 y \u2261 T - Q mod 2.\n\nWe can choose T to be either P or Q.\n\nIf P == Q, then choosing T = P (or Q) will require x =0 and y=0 (if T is P and Q equals P). So possible.\n\nIf P != Q, then we can choose T to be P or Q.\n\nIf we choose T = P:\n\nThen y must be (P - Q) mod 2. Since P != Q, this is 1 mod 2. So y must be 1. So even indices will have Q +1 mod 2 = (Q+1) mod 2. But since T is P, which is different from Q, this would require Q+1 mod2 = P \u2192 since P != Q, this holds. So yes.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose P is 0 (all odd indices even), Q is 1 (even indices odd).\n\nChoose T = P (0):\n\nThen for even indices: Q + y \u2261 T \u2192 1 + y \u22610 mod2 \u2192 y=1.\n\nThus, even indices become 1+1=2 mod2 \u21920, which matches T=0.\n\nThus, all elements would be 0 parity.\n\nSimilarly, if T is Q (1):\n\nThen x must be 1 -0 =1 mod2. So odd indices become 0+1=1 mod2.\n\nEven indices: 1 + y \u22611 \u2192 y=0. So even indices stay 1.\n\nThus, all elements are 1.\n\nThus, if all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity, then it is possible to choose T as either of their parities, and set x and y accordingly.\n\nThus, the condition is that all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity.\n\nAh! That's a much simpler condition. So the problem reduces to checking whether all elements at odd indices have the same parity, and all elements at even indices have the same parity. If that's true, then the answer is YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBecause then, you can choose T to be either the parity of the odd indices or the even indices, and adjust x and y accordingly.\n\nWait, let me test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nTest case 1: [1,2,1]\n\nOdd indices (positions 1 and 3) have parities 1 and 1 \u2192 same.\n\nEven index (position 2) has parity 0 \u2192 same (only one element).\n\nThus, condition holds \u2192 YES.\n\nSample 2: [1,2]\n\nOdd indices (1) has parity 1, even (2) has 0. All odd indices same (only one), even same (only one). So condition holds \u2192 but the sample's answer is NO. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, the second sample's answer is NO. But according to this condition, it would be YES. So there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait what's the second test case?\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 2 \u2192 array [1,2]\n\nThe problem says the answer is NO.\n\nAccording to the condition I just derived, since all odd indices (1) have parity 1, and even indices (2) have 0. So all odd indices are same, even indices same. So according to the condition, it should be possible. But the sample says NO.\n\nHmm, so my reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait let's see why the sample's answer is NO.\n\nThe array is [1,2]. We need to make all elements even or all odd.\n\nPossible operations:\n\nOption 1: Make all even.\n\nCurrent parities: 1 (odd), 0 (even).\n\nWe need to choose x and y such that:\n\nFor odd indices (1): 1 +x mod2 =0 \u2192 x must be 1 mod2.\n\nFor even indices (2): 0 + y mod2 =0 \u2192 y must be 0 mod2.\n\nSo x is 1, y is 0.\n\nThus, after x=1 (add 1 to odd indices once), and y=0 (no even operations):\n\nThe array becomes:\n\n1+1=2 (even), 2 +0=2 (even). So all even. So it should be possible. But the sample says NO.\n\nWait this contradicts the sample's note. Wait what's the sample's note for the second test case?\n\nThe note says: \"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\nBut according to this calculation, it is possible. So there's a mistake here.\n\nWait what's the actual problem's second test case?\n\nWait the second test case in the note's example is:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\nWait perhaps I misread the test case. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem's note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". For the third test case, all elements already have the same parity so the answer is \"YES\". For the fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all elements at odd positions by 1, thus obtaining the array [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001], and all elements become odd so the answer is \"YES\".\"\n\nWait the second test case must be different. Let me see the first sample input given in the problem's note:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2 1 \u2192 first test case (output YES)\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n2\n\n1 2 \u2192 output NO.\n\nBut according to my calculation, this should be possible. So why is the answer NO?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait let's re-calculate:\n\nThe array is [1,2].\n\nWe want to make all even.\n\nWe need x and y such that:\n\nFor the first element (odd index): (1 +x) mod2 =0 \u2192 x must be 1 mod2.\n\nFor the second element (even index): (2 + y) mod2 =0 \u2192 since 2 mod2 is 0, so 0 + y mod2 =0 \u2192 y must be 0 mod2.\n\nSo x is 1, y is 0.\n\nThus, applying x=1 (add 1 to odd indices once), and y=0 (no even operations):\n\nThe first element becomes 1+1=2 (even), the second remains 2 (even). So all even. So it should be possible. But the sample says it's NO. So there's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. What's the problem here?\n\nWait the problem's note says the second test case's answer is NO. So there must be an error in my approach.\n\nWait perhaps I misunderstood the problem's operations.\n\nThe operations are:\n\nAdd 1 to every element with an odd index. So each operation of type 1 adds 1 to all odd indices. Similarly for even.\n\nEach operation can be done any number of times. So the number of times you do each operation can be any non-negative integer.\n\nThe parity changes are toggled each time you do the operation. Because adding 1 flips the parity.\n\nThus, the number of times you do the operation mod 2 determines the final parity change.\n\nThus, the final parity for an odd index is initial_parity + (number of type 1 operations) mod2.\n\nSimilarly for even indices and type 2 operations.\n\nThus, in the second test case:\n\nThe first element (odd index) has initial parity 1 (odd).\n\nThe second (even) has 0 (even).\n\nTo make both even:\n\nWe need:\n\n1 + x \u22610 mod2 \u2192 x is 1 mod2.\n\n0 + y \u22610 mod2 \u2192 y is 0 mod2.\n\nThus, x must be odd, y even.\n\nSo possible. So why is the sample's answer NO?\n\nAh! Wait the sample's second test case must be different. Let me recheck the problem's note.\n\nWait the problem's note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". For the third test case, all elements already have the same parity so the answer is \"YES\". For the fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all elements at odd positions by 1, thus obtaining the array [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001], and all elements become odd so the answer is \"YES\".\"\n\nWait perhaps the second test case is not [1,2], but another array. Let me see the first sample input given in the problem's note:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1 2 1 \u2192 first test case (output YES)\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n2\n\n1 3 \u2192 perhaps?\n\nWait maybe I misread the sample input. Let me recheck the problem's note.\n\nThe problem's note says:\n\n\"For the first test case, we can increment the elements with an even index, obtaining the array [1, 3, 1], which contains only odd numbers, so the answer is \"YES\".\n\nFor the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\".\n\nFor the third test case, all elements already have the same parity so the answer is \"YES\".\n\nFor the fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all elements at odd positions by 1, thus obtaining the array [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001], and all elements become odd so the answer is \"YES\".\n\nWait the fourth test case's array is [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000], perhaps?\n\nBut the second test case's array must be such that it's impossible to make all parities same.\n\nSuppose the second test case is [1, 3]. Then:\n\nInitial parities: 1 (odd), 1 (even).\n\nWe want to make all even:\n\nFor odd indices: 1 +x mod2 =0 \u2192 x=1 mod2.\n\nFor even indices: 1 +y mod2 =0 \u2192 y=1 mod2.\n\nThus, x=1, y=1.\n\nAfter applying:\n\nOdd indices: 1+1=2 (even).\n\nEven indices:3+1=4 (even). So all even. So possible. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the second test case is [1, 2, 3].\n\nWait let's think of a case where it's impossible.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2, 3].\n\nOdd indices (1 and 3) have parities 1 and 1 \u2192 same.\n\nEven index (2) has parity 0.\n\nThus, according to the condition, it should be possible. Let's see:\n\nTo make all even:\n\nx must be 1 mod2 (to flip the odd indices' parity from 1 to 0).\n\ny must be 1 mod2 (to flip even index's parity from 0 to 1 \u2192 but that would make it odd. So that's not desired.\n\nWait, no. To make all even:\n\nFor even index (2) which is 2 (parity 0), we need to keep it even. So y must be even (0 mod2).\n\nThus:\n\nx=1 mod2, y=0 mod2.\n\nThen:\n\nOdd indices: 1+1=2 (even), 3+1=4 (even).\n\nEven index: 2+0=2 (even). So all even. So possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother example where it's impossible:\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nOdd indices (1,3) have parities 1 and 1 \u2192 same.\n\nEven indices (2,4) have 0 and 0 \u2192 same.\n\nThus, possible to make all even or all odd.\n\nWait, what about an array where the odd indices have different parities?\n\nLike [1, 2, 2].\n\nOdd indices are 1 (parity 1) and 3 (parity 0). So they are different. Thus, the condition (all odd indices same parity) is not met. Thus, the answer is NO.\n\nYes, in this case, it's impossible.\n\nSo the condition is correct: all odd indices must have the same parity, and all even indices must have the same parity.\n\nThus, the second test case in the problem's note must be an array where either the odd indices have different parities or the even indices do.\n\nFor example, let's say the second test case is [1, 2, 3].\n\nWait no, that's three elements. Let me think of a two-element array where the condition is not met.\n\nWait for a two-element array, the odd indices (first element) and even (second) must have their own parities, but the condition requires that all odd indices are same (which they are, since only one) and even indices same (only one). Thus, the condition is met. So why the sample's second test case is NO?\n\nAh! Now I see the mistake. The sample's second test case must be different. Let me recheck the problem's note.\n\nAh! The problem's note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". For the third test case, all elements already have the same parity so the answer is \"YES\". For the fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all elements at odd positions by 1, thus obtaining the array [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001], and all elements become odd so the answer is \"YES\".\"\n\nWait the fourth test case's array must have been [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. After adding 1 to odd indices, they become 1001 (odd), and even indices remain 0 (even). But the note says all become odd. So the even indices must have been 0, but after adding 1 to even indices? No, the operation was adding to odd indices. So the even indices remain 0. So that's a contradiction. Wait the note says after performing one operation (type 1: add to odd indices), the even indices are 1? No, the even indices are not changed. So perhaps the initial array was [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. After adding 1 to odd indices (positions 1,3,5), the array becomes [1001,0,1001,0,1001]. The even indices (positions 2 and 4) are still 0 (even). So the note's example must have a different initial array.\n\nAh, perhaps the fourth test case's initial array is [1000, 0, 1000, 0, 1000]. After one type 1 operation (add to odd indices), the odd indices become 1001 (odd), and even indices remain 0 (even). So the array has mixed parities. But the note says all become odd. So perhaps the initial array was [999, 0, 999, 0, 999]. Then adding 1 to odd indices gives 1000 (even), but that's not odd. Hmm, perhaps the note has a typo.\n\nRegardless, the key point is that the condition I derived (all odd indices have same parity and all even indices have same parity) must be correct. Thus, the sample's second test case must be an array where this condition is not met.\n\nFor example, let's say the second test case is [1, 3, 2].\n\nOdd indices (1 and 3) have parities 1 and 0 \u2192 different. Thus, the condition is not met \u2192 answer is NO.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to check whether all odd indices have the same parity and all even indices have the same parity.\n\nThus, the code should be modified to check this.\n\nNow, returning to the given code:\n\nThe existing code reads the first two elements, then for the remaining elements, it checks whether their parity matches the first or second element's parity (depending on their index). But this is only checking whether all elements have the same parity as the first element for odd indices and second for even indices. Which is a stricter condition than needed. The correct condition is that all odd indices have the same parity (not necessarily the first's), and all even indices have the same parity (not necessarily the second's).\n\nThus, the code needs to track the parity of the first odd and even indices, then ensure all others match.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead the array.\n\nCheck all odd indices have the same parity.\n\nCheck all even indices have the same parity.\n\nIf both are true \u2192 YES else NO.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the array.\n\nboolean allOddSame = true;\n\nint firstOddParity = arr[0]%2;\n\nfor (int i=2; i <n; i +=2) { // other odd indices (0-based indices 2,4 etc)\n\n    if (arr[i]%2 != firstOddParity) {\n\n        allOddSame = false;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nboolean allEvenSame = true;\n\nint firstEvenParity = arr[1]%2;\n\nfor (int i=3; i <n; i +=2) {\n\n    if (arr[i]%2 != firstEvenParity) {\n\n        allEvenSame = false;\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (allOddSame && allEvenSame) {\n\n    System.out.println(\"YES\");\n\n} else {\n\n    System.out.println(\"NO\");\n\n}\n\nBut in the given code's structure, the code reads the first two elements (a and b), then reads the rest in a loop. The variables 'one' and 'two' are set based on a and b's parity. The loop for the remaining elements (i from 3 to n) is processing each element, and for even indices (i%2==0 \u2192 1-based), it has a TODO.\n\nThus, to fix the code, the missing part in the TODO should set m to true when the even index element's parity doesn't match 'two'. But also, the code must check the even indices' parity against the first even element's parity, and the odd indices' against the first odd's.\n\nWait, the existing code's 'one' is the parity of the first element (odd index), and 'two' is the parity of the second (even index). The loop for the remaining elements (starting from i=3) checks for each element:\n\nif it's an even index (i%2==0 \u2192 1-based even index):\n\nthen check if its parity (r) matches 'two' (the second element's parity). If not, then set m to true.\n\nElse (odd index):\n\ncheck if r matches 'one' (first element's parity). If not, set m to true.\n\nThus, the code is checking whether all elements have the same parity as the first element for odd indices and second for even indices. Which is the stricter condition. But the correct condition is that all odd indices have the same parity (any value), and all even indices have the same parity (any value).\n\nThus, the code's current logic is incorrect. To fix it, the code should track the first even and odd parities and ensure all others match.\n\nBut given the code's structure, perhaps the following can be done:\n\nThe code's 'one' and 'two' variables are set to the parity of the first and second elements. Then, for each subsequent element:\n\nFor odd indices (i is odd in 1-based? No, i is the 1-based index. For example, i=3 is odd index (3), so in the code's code, the 'else' clause is taken. The code checks if the current element's parity (r) matches 'one' (first element's parity). If not, set m to true.\n\nFor even indices (i even in 1-based, like 4), the code checks if r matches 'two' (second element's parity). If not, set m to true.\n\nThus, the code's current logic is to check whether all odd indices have the same parity as the first element, and even indices same as the second. Thus, the code's logic is correct only if the first and second elements' parities are the same as the required parities for their groups. But the correct condition allows the groups to have any parity as long as they are consistent within themselves.\n\nThus, the code's logic is incorrect. To fix it, the code must allow the first element's parity to be the base for odd indices, but all others must match that, and similarly for even indices.\n\nThus, the code's current approach is correct only if the first and second elements' parities are the ones that all others must follow. Which is exactly what the code is doing. But this is not sufficient.\n\nWait, no. The code's approach is to check whether all elements have the same parity as the first element for odd indices and second for even indices. This is equivalent to checking whether all odd indices have the same parity (since they must match the first's) and all even indices have the same (match the second's). Thus, the code's logic is correct!\n\nWait, because if all odd indices have the same parity as the first element, then they are all the same. Similarly for even indices. Thus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nAh! I see now. Because the first element is an odd index. So if all other odd indices have the same parity as the first, then all odd indices have the same parity. Similarly for even indices.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nWait, then why the second test case in the problem's note gives a NO for the array [1,2]?\n\nBecause according to the code's logic, the first element (1) is odd parity (1), second (2) is even (0). The third element (if there was one) must match the first's parity for odd indices. But in the second test case, the array is [1,2], which has two elements. The first element's parity is 1 (odd), second is 0 (even). All odd indices (only first) have the same parity (1), and even indices (second) have the same (0). Thus, the code would set m to false, and output YES. But the sample says it's NO.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait the sample's second test case must be different. Let me recheck the problem's note.\n\nThe problem's note says:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can show that after performing any number of operations we won't be able to make all elements have the same parity, so the answer is \"NO\". For the third test case, all elements already have the same parity so the answer is \"YES\". For the fourth test case, we can perform one operation and increase all elements at odd positions by 1, thus obtaining the array [1001, 1, 1001, 1, 1001], and all elements become odd so the answer is \"YES\".\"\n\nAh! The second test case's array must be such that the odd indices have different parities or even indices have different.\n\nFor example, let's say the second test case is [1, 3, 2].\n\nThen the first element (odd index) is 1 (parity 1), third element (odd index) is 2 (parity 0). Thus, the odd indices have different parities \u2192 the code's m would be set to true \u2192 output NO.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nThe earlier example I thought of (array [1,2]) would be a case where the code outputs YES, but the sample's second test case is different.\n\nThus, the code's logic is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO is to set m to true when the even index element's parity doesn't match 'two'.\n\nIn the code's loop:\n\nif (i%2 ==0) { // even index (1-based)\n\n   if (r != two) {\n\n      m = true;\n\n   }\n\n} else { ... }\n\nThus, the missing code is to set m to true in that case.\n\nThe current code has:\n\nif (i%2 ==0) {\n\n   if (r != two) {\n\n      /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   }\n\n} else {\n\n   if (r != one) {\n\n      m = true;\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nThus, the TODO should be to set m = true.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nm = true;\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nif (r != two) {\n\n    m = true;\n\n}\n\nHence, the answer is to fill the TODO with m = true;\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nm = true;\n\nSo the code's loop becomes:\n\nfor(int i=3; i<=n; i++) {\n\n    int p=s.nextInt();\n\n    int r=p%2;\n\n    if(i%2==0) {\n\n        if(r!=two) {\n\n            m = true;\n\n        }\n\n    } else {\n\n        if(r!=one) {\n\n            m=true;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThus, the code will set m to true if any element's parity doesn't match the first or second element's parity for their respective indices. If m remains false, then all elements match the first and second's parities for their indices, so the answer is YES.\n\nThus, the code is correct with this fix.\n\nThe earlier confusion was due to a misinterpretation of the sample's second test case. The code's logic is correct."
