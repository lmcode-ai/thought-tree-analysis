So the code's logic is that reachable[i] contains all nodes that can be processed at step i, and their dp is set to i. Therefore, for each u in rev_adj[v], which are predecessors of v, the minimal days for u is i+1. Hence, the code should add u to reachable[i+1], so that when i+1 is processed, their dp will be set to i+1. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n} Wait, but in the code's current setup, the reachable array is being built in this way. Wait, but the code's loop is for each i from 0 to 2*m+5. Wait, but the problem is that the code's current code may not process the nodes in the correct order. Wait, let me think of an example. Suppose n is 2, and there is an edge from 1 to 2. Then, reachable[0] has 2. Processing i=0, v=2. Then, rev_adj[2] contains 1 (since the edge is 1->2). So for u=1, we add it to reachable[1]. Then, when i=1, processing reachable[1], which has 1. \n\nSetting dp[1] to 1. Thus, the answer would be 1, which is correct. Another example: suppose there are two paths from 1 to 2. Wait, but the code's approach seems to work. Therefore, the missing code is to add u to reachable[i+1] if it hasn't been processed yet. Wait, but in the code's current code, the check is if (dp[v] ! = inf) continue. So when processing v in reachable[i], we first set dp[v] to i. Then, for each u in rev_adj[v], we check if dp[u] is inf. If so, add to reachable[i+1]. Therefore, the code's missing part is exactly that. So the code should have:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) { if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n} Wait, but in the code's current structure, the reachable array is being built in this way. Therefore, the missing code is exactly that. Wait, but in the code's current code, the rev_adj is built as the reverse edges. Wait, the code's rev_adj is built as follows: for each edge a->b, rev_adj[b].push_back(a). So rev_adj[v] contains all the nodes u such that there is an edge from u to v. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. Therefore, the missing code is the loop over the predecessors and adding them to reachable[i+1]. So the code should be:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n} Wait, but in the code's current code, the reachable array is of size 2*m+5, which is more than enough since each step can add at most m edges. Therefore, the code should be filled with that loop. Wait, but in the code's current code, the reachable array is declared as vector<int> reachable[2*m+5]; but in C++, you can't have a variable-length array like that. Oh wait, the code is written in C++ and the way it's declared is as a vector of vectors. Wait, no, the code says:\n\nvector<int> rev_adj[n+1], block(n+1); Wait, the code's line:\n\nvector<int> rev_adj[n+1], block(n+1);\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in C++, you can't have variable-length arrays like that. The code is using C++11 or later, but the first part is okay because rev_adj is an array of vectors. Wait, the code's first line inside the test loop is:\n\nvector<int> rev_adj[n+1], block(n+1); Wait, that's a syntax error. Because the vector<int> rev_adj[n+1] is an array of vectors, but the second part block(n+1) is a vector. Wait, perhaps the code has a typo. The line should be:\n\nvector<int> rev_adj[n+1], block(n+1); Wait, but that's not correct syntax. Because the first part is an array of vectors, and the second is a vector.",

Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n} Wait, but in the code's current structure, the 'if (dp[v] ! = inf) continue;' ensures that we only process each node once. Therefore, the code should be correct with that. So the final answer is to write that loop in the TODO section.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key here is that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. Keshi, when told to move, randomly selects a reachable city (based on the remaining roads) and moves there. The goal is to find the smallest d where they can ensure that Keshi arrives at city n within d days, no matter what choices are made (since Keshi's movement is random, but AmShZ can choose the best strategy to minimize days).\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves some dynamic programming or BFS. Let me look at the code provided and see where the TODO is.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThey have a vector dp which is initialized to infinity. The reachable array is an array of vectors, where reachable[i] probably holds the nodes reachable at step i. The loop is iterating over i from 0 to 2*m+5, and for each i, they process the nodes in reachable[i]. For each such node v, if dp[v] is not set, they set it to i, then loop through the reverse adjacency list (rev_adj) of v's predecessors. The TODO is in that inner loop.\n\nWait, the reverse adjacency list is built such that rev_adj[b] contains all the a's where there's an edge a->b. So for each node v, rev_adj[v] gives all the nodes that can reach v directly via an edge. \n\nThe code seems to be trying to compute the minimal days required to reach each node. The idea might be to work backwards from node n. Because the problem requires that Keshi must reach n, so we can model this as the reverse: starting from n, and figuring out the minimal steps needed to get back to 1, considering the blocking and moving options.\n\nWait, maybe the DP approach here is to model the problem in reverse. Let me think: since we want to reach n as soon as possible, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the earliest day when Keshi can be forced to reach n. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is using reachable[i] to track nodes that can be reached (in reverse) in i steps. The DP[v] is the minimal day when node v can be part of the path leading to n. \n\nWait, the code initializes reachable[0] with n. Then, for each step i, they process all nodes in reachable[i], and for each such node v, they look at all predecessors (from rev_adj[v]). For each predecessor u, perhaps they need to add u to reachable[i+1], but with some conditions?\n\nWait, the code's structure is a bit unclear. Let me think again. The problem requires that AmShZ can choose each day to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. The optimal strategy would involve choosing when to block roads so that Keshi's path is forced towards n as quickly as possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the problem as a game where each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road (thereby reducing Keshi's options) or let Keshi move. The minimal days required would be the minimal number of steps needed to reach n, considering that each move can be optimized by blocking roads appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be thought of in terms of the maximum number of steps required in the worst case. Since AmShZ wants to minimize the days, they need to choose the best possible path, but Keshi's movement is random. Wait, but the problem says \"make sure that they will see each other after at most d days\". So the strategy must work regardless of Keshi's choices when moving. Therefore, the approach must ensure that no matter which path Keshi takes when moving, he will reach n within d days.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a BFS where each state is the current city and the set of blocked roads. But that's probably too big. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLooking at the code's structure, the code is trying to compute dp[v], which is the minimal day when v can be reached in reverse. Let me think of the problem in reverse. Let's imagine that we are starting from n and trying to reach 1. Each day, AmShZ can choose to either block an incoming edge (so that Keshi can't come through that edge) or allow Keshi to move back along an edge. Wait, maybe the reverse approach is better here.\n\nAlternatively, the DP[v] represents the minimal number of days required to get from v to n. Let me think of the problem in terms of the minimal days required for Keshi to reach n starting from v, given optimal blocking by AmShZ.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP[v] is the minimal number of days needed to reach n from v. Let me see:\n\nThe code initializes reachable[0] with n. So dp[n] is 0. Then, for each step i, they process all nodes in reachable[i], and for each such node v, they look at all predecessors u (from rev_adj[v]). The idea is that if you can reach v in i days, then u can reach v in i+1 days? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the minimal days required for each node to reach n. The reachable array is storing the nodes that can be reached in i steps. The DP[v] is the minimal steps required to reach n from v. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for each i from 0 to 2m+5. For each i, they process all nodes in reachable[i], and for each such node v, they set dp[v] to i (if not already set). Then, for each predecessor u of v (i.e., edges u -> v), they need to do something. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that if you can reach v in i days, then you can reach u in i+1 days, but only if you can block the other edges from u so that Keshi is forced to take the path to v. \n\nAlternatively, the DP[v] represents the minimal number of days required to get from v to n. The way to compute this is by considering that from v, you can choose to block some edges or let Keshi move. \n\nHmm, maybe the key is that for each node u, the minimal days required to reach n from u is 1 plus the minimal days of all possible next nodes. But since AmShZ can choose which edges to block, they can choose the path that gives the minimal days. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: the minimal days d[v] for node v is the minimal over all possible edges from v to some u, of (d[u] + 1), but with the option to block other edges. Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to choose the path with the minimal d[u], so that you can force Keshi to take that path. \n\nWait, perhaps the DP approach is to compute for each node v the minimal number of days required to reach n from v. The recurrence would be:\n\nd[v] = 1 + min{d[u] for all edges v->u} \n\nBut since AmShZ can block edges, they can choose which edges to block so that Keshi is forced to take the path with the minimal d[u]. \n\nWait, but how does blocking work here? Each day, AmShZ can choose to block a road, but they can do this strategically. The idea is that each day, they can either block a road (so that Keshi can't use it) or let Keshi move. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be thought of as a game where each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road (thereby reducing the options for Keshi) or let Keshi move. The goal is to minimize the number of days until Keshi reaches n. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal days required for node v is the minimal number of days such that, by optimally blocking roads, you can force Keshi to reach n in that many days. \n\nLet me think of the DP approach again. The code's current setup is trying to compute dp[v], which is the minimal days required to reach n from v. The code initializes dp[n] as 0. Then, for each node in reachable[i], they process their predecessors. \n\nWait, the code's reachable array is built in a way that for each i, reachable[i] contains nodes that can be reached in i steps. The code starts with reachable[0] = {n}, so dp[n] is 0. Then, for each i, they process all nodes in reachable[i], and for each such node v, they look at all predecessors u (i.e., edges u -> v). \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that if you can reach v in i days, then you can reach u in i+1 days. Because, from u, you can choose to let Keshi move to v (since that's an option), so the days would be i+1. \n\nBut how does blocking come into play here? Because AmShZ can block other edges from u, so that Keshi has no choice but to go to v. \n\nAh, right! The key insight here is that for each node u, the minimal days required is 1 plus the minimal days of any of its outgoing edges. Because AmShZ can block all other edges except the one leading to the minimal path. \n\nWait, more precisely, for each node u, the minimal days d[u] is 1 + the minimal d[v] among all outgoing edges from u. Because AmShZ can block all other edges except the one leading to the minimal d[v], so that when Keshi is told to move, he must take that path. \n\nTherefore, the recurrence is d[u] = 1 + min{d[v] for all edges u\u2192v}. \n\nThis makes sense because each time, you can choose to block all other edges except the one leading to the minimal d[v], so that Keshi is forced to take that path. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing the minimal path from 1 to n where each node's value is 1 plus the minimal of its children's values. \n\nWait, but the direction here is important. Since we are going from u to v, and the DP is computed in reverse. \n\nWait, actually, since we want to compute d[u], which is the minimal days from u to n, then for each edge u\u2192v, the minimal path would be 1 (for the day when Keshi moves) plus the minimal d[v]. \n\nTherefore, the DP can be computed by starting from n (d[n] = 0) and working backwards. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize d[n] = 0.\n\nFor all other nodes, compute d[u] as 1 + the minimum d[v] among all edges u\u2192v. \n\nWait, but how do we handle nodes that have multiple outgoing edges? \n\nYes, exactly. For each node u, the minimal days is 1 plus the minimal d[v] among all its outgoing edges. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal path in this reversed graph where each node's value is 1 plus the minimal of its children. \n\nWait, but how do we compute this? \n\nThis is similar to a topological sort problem. Since the graph may have cycles, but since there's a path from 1 to n, perhaps we can process the nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nAlternatively, since the graph is directed, we can process the nodes in reverse topological order. \n\nWait, but the code provided is using a BFS-like approach. Let me look again at the code's structure. \n\nThe code has a loop over i from 0 to 2*m+5. For each i, it processes the nodes in reachable[i]. \n\nInitially, reachable[0] has n. \n\nThen, for each node v in reachable[i], they process their predecessors (u in rev_adj[v]). \n\nWait, the rev_adj is built as the reverse edges. So for each edge u\u2192v, rev_adj[v] contains u. \n\nWait, so the code is processing nodes in reverse. \n\nWait, the code's approach is to compute dp[v] as the minimal days required to reach n from v. \n\nThe code starts with dp[n] = 0 (since reachable[0] has n, so when processing i=0, dp[n] is set to 0). \n\nThen, for each node v in reachable[i], they look at all predecessors u (i.e., nodes that have an edge to v). \n\nWait, but how does that help in computing dp[u]? \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that if v can be reached in i days, then u can reach n in i+1 days by moving through the edge u\u2192v. \n\nWait, but that would be the case if we can block all other edges from u except the one to v. \n\nTherefore, the minimal days for u is 1 + the minimal days of its children (the nodes reachable from u). \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the rev_adj[v] gives all the u's that can reach v. So for each v in reachable[i], the predecessors u can reach v, so their dp[u] can be set to i+1? \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to compute the minimal days for each node by propagating from n backwards. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose n is the destination. \n\nFor node v which has an edge from u to v, then the minimal days for u would be 1 + days[v]. \n\nSo, the code's approach is to process nodes in order of their dp value. \n\nThe code's reachable array is storing the nodes that can be processed at each step. \n\nWait, the code's reachable array is an array of vectors. reachable[i] contains all nodes that have dp value i. \n\nInitially, reachable[0] has n. \n\nThen, for each i, for each node v in reachable[i], we look at all predecessors u (i.e., nodes that have an edge to v). \n\nFor each such u, if dp[u] is not yet set, then the minimal days for u would be i+1, since from u, you can move to v in one day (by blocking other edges), so the total days would be 1 + i (since v takes i days). \n\nWait, that makes sense. So the dp[u] would be i+1. \n\nTherefore, the code should, for each u in rev_adj[v], add u to reachable[i+1], and set dp[u] to i+1. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the loop is for each i, and for each v in reachable[i], then for each u in rev_adj[v], we need to process those u's. \n\nSo the code's TODO section should be adding u to reachable[i+1], and setting dp[u] to i+1 if it hasn't been set yet. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the loop is:\n\nfor each i from 0 to 2*m+5:\n\n   for each v in reachable[i]:\n\n      if dp[v] is already set, skip.\n\n      else set dp[v] = i.\n\n      then for each u in rev_adj[v]:\n\n          // TODO: process u.\n\nSo the code is processing nodes in reachable[i], and for each such v, it's looking at all u that can reach v (i.e., edges u->v). \n\nWait, but the rev_adj[v] contains all u such that there is an edge from u to v. \n\nSo for each such u, the minimal days for u would be dp[v] + 1? \n\nWait, no. Because if v can be reached in i days, then u can reach n in (i+1) days. Because from u, you can choose to move to v (by blocking other edges), and then from v it takes i days. So total is 1 + i. \n\nTherefore, the dp[u] should be set to i+1. \n\nTherefore, the code should, for each u in rev_adj[v], check if dp[u] is still infinity. If so, then set dp[u] to i+1, and add u to reachable[i+1]. \n\nWait, but how is this being tracked? \n\nThe code's current structure is that reachable[i] holds all nodes with dp[v] = i. \n\nSo for each u in rev_adj[v], we can set dp[u] to i+1, and add u to reachable[i+1]. \n\nTherefore, the code's TODO section should be:\n\nfor each u in rev_adj[v], we check if dp[u] is still infinity. If yes, then we set dp[u] to i+1 and add it to reachable[i+1]. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the loop is for each v in reachable[i], and for each u in rev_adj[v], we need to process u. \n\nSo the code should have something like:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n        dp[u] = i+1;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the reachable array is being built as follows. \n\nWait, the code's reachable array is of size 2*m+5, which is probably to cover the maximum possible steps. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the loop is for each i, and for each v in reachable[i], then for each u in rev_adj[v], we need to process u. \n\nTherefore, the code's TODO section should be adding u to reachable[i+1], and setting their dp value. \n\nBut in the code's current code, the dp[v] is set to i when processing reachable[i]. \n\nWait, the code's code has:\n\nfor (auto v : reachable[i]) {\n    if (dp[v] != inf) continue;\n    dp[v] = i;\n    for (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n        // process u here\n    }\n}\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Because if the code is processing reachable[i], then the nodes in reachable[i] are those that can be processed at step i. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to process nodes in BFS order. \n\nWait, the code's reachable array is being used to track nodes at each level. \n\nWait, the code initializes reachable[0] with n. \n\nThen, for each i, it processes all nodes in reachable[i]. \n\nFor each such node v, if dp[v] is not set (inf), then it sets dp[v] to i. \n\nThen, for each predecessor u (i.e., edges u->v), we need to add u to reachable[i+1], so that in the next iteration, when i+1 is processed, those u's can be considered. \n\nTherefore, the code's TODO section should be adding u to reachable[i+1], but only if they haven't been processed yet. \n\nWait, but the code's current code is:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    // TODO: Your code here\n}\n\nSo the code needs to add u to reachable[i+1], but only if dp[u] is still infinity. \n\nTherefore, the code should be:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but then when processing reachable[i+1], the dp[u] will be set to i+1. \n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, when processing reachable[i], the code is setting dp[v] to i. \n\nSo the code's logic is that reachable[i] contains all nodes that can be processed at step i, and their dp is set to i. \n\nTherefore, for each u in rev_adj[v], which are predecessors of v, the minimal days for u is i+1. \n\nHence, the code should add u to reachable[i+1], so that when i+1 is processed, their dp will be set to i+1. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the reachable array is being built in this way. \n\nWait, but the code's loop is for each i from 0 to 2*m+5. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the code's current code may not process the nodes in the correct order. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose n is 2, and there is an edge from 1 to 2. \n\nThen, reachable[0] has 2. \n\nProcessing i=0, v=2. \n\nThen, rev_adj[2] contains 1 (since the edge is 1->2). \n\nSo for u=1, we add it to reachable[1]. \n\nThen, when i=1, processing reachable[1], which has 1. \n\nSetting dp[1] to 1. \n\nThus, the answer would be 1, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are two paths from 1 to 2. \n\nWait, but the code's approach seems to work. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to add u to reachable[i+1] if it hasn't been processed yet. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the check is if (dp[v] != inf) continue. \n\nSo when processing v in reachable[i], we first set dp[v] to i. \n\nThen, for each u in rev_adj[v], we check if dp[u] is inf. If so, add to reachable[i+1]. \n\nTherefore, the code's missing part is exactly that. \n\nSo the code should have:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the reachable array is being built in this way. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is exactly that. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the rev_adj is built as the reverse edges. \n\nWait, the code's rev_adj is built as follows: for each edge a->b, rev_adj[b].push_back(a). \n\nSo rev_adj[v] contains all the nodes u such that there is an edge from u to v. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the loop over the predecessors and adding them to reachable[i+1]. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the reachable array is of size 2*m+5, which is more than enough since each step can add at most m edges. \n\nTherefore, the code should be filled with that loop. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the reachable array is declared as vector<int> reachable[2*m+5]; but in C++, you can't have a variable-length array like that. Oh wait, the code is written in C++ and the way it's declared is as a vector of vectors. Wait, no, the code says:\n\nvector<int> rev_adj[n+1], block(n+1);\n\nWait, the code's line:\n\nvector<int> rev_adj[n+1], block(n+1);\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in C++, you can't have variable-length arrays like that. The code is using C++11 or later, but the first part is okay because rev_adj is an array of vectors. \n\nWait, the code's first line inside the test loop is:\n\nvector<int> rev_adj[n+1], block(n+1);\n\nWait, that's a syntax error. Because the vector<int> rev_adj[n+1] is an array of vectors, but the second part block(n+1) is a vector. \n\nWait, perhaps the code has a typo. The line should be:\n\nvector<int> rev_adj[n+1], block(n+1);\n\nWait, but that's not correct syntax. Because the first part is an array of vectors, and the second is a vector. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is written incorrectly. But since the user provided the code, perhaps it's a mistake, but we can ignore that for now. \n\nAssuming that the code is correct except for the missing part, the missing code is the loop over the predecessors and adding them to reachable[i+1]. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the TODO section is:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the reachable array is being built correctly. \n\nWait, but in the code's current code, the reachable array is being filled in this way. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is exactly that loop. \n\nSo the answer is to add that code in the TODO section. \n\nWait, but let me think again. \n\nThe code's dp[v] is set to i when processing reachable[i]. \n\nThen, for each u in rev_adj[v], which are the predecessors of v, the minimal days for u is i+1. \n\nTherefore, those u's should be added to reachable[i+1], so that when i+1 is processed, their dp will be set to i+1. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct with that loop. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the code's current code has the 'block' array. Looking back, the code has:\n\nblock[a]++;\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake. The block array is declared as a vector<int> block(n+1), but in the loop, for each edge a->b, they do block[a]++. \n\nHmm, perhaps that's part of a different approach, but in the code provided, the block array is not used elsewhere. So maybe that's a leftover from a previous attempt and can be ignored. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is the loop over the predecessors and adding them to reachable[i+1]. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nfor (auto u : rev_adj[v]) {\n    if (dp[u] == inf) {\n        reachable[i+1].push_back(u);\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the 'if (dp[v] != inf) continue;' ensures that we only process each node once. \n\nTherefore, the code should be correct with that. \n\nSo the final answer is to write that loop in the TODO section."
