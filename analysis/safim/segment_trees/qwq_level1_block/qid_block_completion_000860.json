But the actual number of pairs between these same strings and others with same second but different first would be (total_second_c2 -k) multiplied by k, but since each pair between same and others is counted once per same string. Wait, perhaps this approach is correct. Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct. Let me think of an example. Take the first sample input given in the problem's note:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst test case: n=5, the strings are \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\".",

                                                                                            "id": "thought_21",

So total 5 pairs. Let me see how the formula would compute this. First, let's compute for each string:\n\nTake \"ab\" (c1='a', c2='b'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['b'] is 2 (since \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\" have second 'b'? Wait wait, let me see",
                                                                                            "label": "mental_execution",

                                                                                            "id": "thought_22",

Wait the strings must be \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\". So the second characters for each:\n\nab: 'b'\n\ncb: 'b'\n\ndb: 'b'\n\naa: 'a'\n\ncc: 'c' So second_char_counts for 'b' is 3 (from ab, cb, db), 'a' is 1 (aa), 'c' is 1 (cc). first_char_counts:\n\na: 2 (ab and aa)\n\nc: 2 (cb and cc)\n\nd:1 (db) So for \"ab\" (c1='a', c2='b'):\n\ncontribution is (second_char_counts['b'] - freq[\"ab\"]) + (first_char_counts['a'] - freq[\"ab\"])\n\nfreq[\"ab\"] is 1. So (3-1) + (2-1) = 2 +1 =3. Similarly for \"cb\" (c1='c', c2='b'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['b'] is 3, so (3-1) (since freq[\"cb\"] is 1) plus first_char_counts['c'] is 2 (since \"cb\" and \"cc\"), so (2-1) =1. So total 2+1=3. \"db\" (c1='d', c2='b'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['b'] is 3, so (3-1) =2. first_char_counts['d'] is 1, so (1-1)=0. So total 2+0=2. \"aa\" (c1='a', c2='a'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['a'] is 1. (1-1)=0. first_char_counts['a'] is 2, so (2-1)=1. So total 0+1=1. \"cc\" (c1='c', c2='c'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['c'] is 1. (1-1)=0. first_char_counts['c'] is 2, so (2-1)=1. So 0+1=1. Now sum all contributions: 3 +3 +2 +1 +1 = 10. Then divide by 2 gives 5, which matches the sample. So the formula works here. Another test case: the second example in the note, which has 6 pairs. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the strings are \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\". Wait the note says the second test case's pairs are 6.",

So the code needs to have a vector to store the strings. Looking back at the code provided, the user's code currently has:\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nInside this loop, the code must read the string, store it in a vector, and update the maps. So first, in the code, after declaring m1, m2, m3, we need to declare a vector<string> v.\n\nSo inside the while(t--):\n\n   long long nu; cin >> nu;\n\n   vector<string> v;\n\n   map<string, int> m1;\n\n   map<char, int> m2, m3;\n\n   while(nu--){\n\n      string s; cin >> s;\n\n      v.push_back(s);\n\n      m1[s]++;\n\n      m2[s[0]]++;\n\n      m3[s[1]]++;\n\n   } Then, after reading all strings, compute the total. The total is initialized to 0.\n\nlong long total =0;\n\nfor each string s in v:\n\n   char c1 = s[0], c2 = s[1];\n\n   int cnt_s = m1[s];\n\n   int part1 = m3[c2] - cnt_s; // second_char_counts[c2] is m3[c2]\n\n   int part2 = m2[c1] - cnt_s;\n\n   total += (part1 + part2); Then, the answer is total / 2. So the code would be:\n\nAfter reading all the strings:\n\nlong long ans = total / 2;\n\ncout << ans << endl; So putting this together. Now, the code provided by the user has some variables named n and nu. Let me see:\n\nIn the code:\n\nint main(){ \nint t;cin>>t;\nwhile(t--){\n   long long nu,n=0;cin>>nu;\n  map<string,int>m1;\n  map<char ,int>m2,m3;\n  while(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n   }cout<<n<<endl;\n}\n} The variable n is initialized to 0, and the code is supposed to compute the answer and store it in n, then output n. So in the code, after computing the total, we need to set n = total / 2. So the steps are:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\n- Read nu (number of strings).\n\n- Initialize vector v.\n\n- Read each string, store in v, and update m1, m2, m3.\n\n- Compute total as sum over all s in v of ( (m3[s[1]] - m1[s]) + (m2[s[0]] - m1[s]) )\n\n- Then, n = total / 2.\n\n- Output n. So the code needs to be filled in with these steps.",

But to compute this efficiently, perhaps we can iterate over all possible pairs of strings that can form such pairs. But that's O(26^2 * 26^2), which is manageable since 26^4 is about 450k. Wait, each string is a pair of two characters (each from a to k, so 11 letters). So there are 11*11 = 121 possible strings. So for each possible string s, and for each possible string t that differs from s in exactly one character, the number of pairs between s and t is (count[s] * count[t]). But since we need to count pairs (i,j) with i<j, the total would be sum over all s < t (in some order) of (count[s] * count[t] if they differ in exactly one character) plus for each s, the number of pairs within the same s (but they can't contribute since they are same strings).",

No, perhaps it's better to compute all unordered pairs (s, t) where s != t and they differ in one character, then multiply by count[s] * count[t], and that's the total. Because for each such pair of strings s and t (s != t), the number of pairs (i,j) where the i-th string is s and j-th is t (i<j) plus the reverse (if s and t are different but the pair is counted once when s comes before t).",

Wait let's see:\n\nSuppose s and t are two different strings that are one-edit apart. When processing s, we add m1[s] * m1[t]. When processing t, we add m1[t] * m1[s]. So the total contribution from this pair is 2 * m1[s] * m1[t]. The desired total is m1[s] * m1[t], so dividing by 2 gives the correct value. Yes. Therefore, the algorithm is: Compute all possible pairs of strings s and t that are one-edit apart, and sum m1[s] * m1[t], then divide by 2.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position. Let's see the problem again. The input is multiple test cases. Each test case has n strings of length 2. For each pair (i,j) with i<j, I need to check if exactly one of the two characters is different. \n\nHmm, the key is to find all such pairs efficiently because n can be up to 1e5, so a O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. Each string is two characters. Let's represent each string as a pair (c1, c2). For two strings to differ in exactly one position, either their first characters are different and the second same, or the second characters are different and the first same.\n\nSo for each string, I can count how many other strings are there that differ in the first character but same in the second, and vice versa. Then sum all those, but since each pair is counted twice (once for each element), I need to be careful. Wait, maybe using a hash map to count frequencies would help.\n\nAlternatively, for each string s, the number of pairs it can form with others is equal to:\n\n(number of strings with same first character but different second) + (number of strings with same second but different first). But how to compute this efficiently?\n\nWait, perhaps we can group the strings by their first and second characters. Let me think:\n\nLet me consider all possible pairs. Let's use a frequency map where the key is the string itself, and the value is how many times it occurs. Then, for each string s, the number of strings that differ in exactly the first character would be the sum over all possible c (different from s[0]) of the count of strings starting with c and having s[1] as the second character. Similarly for the second character.\n\nBut calculating this for each string might be O(26*26) per string, which is manageable because 26*26 is 676, and with 1e5 strings, that's 6.7e7 operations, which might be okay. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each possible first character and second character how many times they occur. Let me think of two separate frequency maps:\n\n- For the first character: a map that counts how many strings have each first character. Similarly for the second.\n\nWait, but that might not be sufficient. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider that for each string s = a + b (like \"ab\"), the number of strings that differ in exactly the first character but same second is equal to (total count of strings with second character b) minus the count of strings that have first character a and second b (since those are the same as s in first character). Similarly, the number of strings differing in the second character but same first is (count of first a) minus the count of a and b together.\n\nWait, that's a good point. Let me formalize this:\n\nSuppose for a string s with first character c1 and second c2:\n\nThe number of strings that have the same second character (c2) but different first character is (total_c2 - count of (c1, c2)). Because total_c2 is the total number of strings with second character c2. Subtracting those that have the same first character (so same as s) gives the number of strings with same second but different first.\n\nSimilarly, the number of strings with same first (c1) but different second is (total_c1 - count of (c1, c2)).\n\nAdding these two gives the total number of strings that form a valid pair with s. However, since each pair is counted twice (once for each element), when we sum over all s, we have to divide the total by 2. Wait, no. Wait, when considering all s, each pair (s1, s2) where they are compatible will be counted once in s1's count and once in s2's count. So the total sum over all s of (their individual counts) will be twice the actual number of pairs. So the total would be (sum for all s of (count1 + count2)) / 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to precompute the counts in a way that allows us to compute the total without double-counting.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is as follows:\n\nWe can use a frequency map (like a hash map) that counts how many times each string occurs. Let's call this freq_map.\n\nAlso, we can have two other frequency maps:\n\n- first_char_counts: a map from each first character to the number of strings with that first character.\n\n- second_char_counts: a map from each second character to the number of strings with that second character.\n\nThen, for each string s (with first c1 and second c2), the number of strings that differ only in the first character is (second_char_counts[c2] - freq_map[s]). Because second_char_counts[c2] is the total number of strings with second character c2. Subtracting freq_map[s] (the count of strings with exactly c1 and c2) gives the number of strings with same second but different first.\n\nSimilarly, the number of strings differing only in the second is (first_char_counts[c1] - freq_map[s]).\n\nSo for each s, the contribution to the total is ( (second_char_counts[c2] - freq_map[s]) + (first_char_counts[c1] - freq_map[s]) )\n\nBut when we sum this over all s, each pair (s1, s2) that are compatible will be counted twice. Because if s1 and s2 form a valid pair, then s1's contribution includes s2, and s2's contribution includes s1. So the total sum would be 2 * the actual answer. Therefore, the total answer would be (sum over all s of (their contribution)) / 2.\n\nWait, but also, we have to subtract the cases where the two strings are the same. Wait, no, because if two strings are the same, then their difference is zero, so they don't contribute. So in the formula above, when s is the same as another string, then in the terms (second_char_counts[c2] - freq_map[s]) would subtract the count of same strings, so that part would not count those. Let me see:\n\nSuppose two strings are the same. Then for each of them, when calculating their contribution, the terms (second_char_counts[c2] - freq_map[s]) would subtract the count of the same string. So for example, if there are k copies of s, then for each of them, the first term would be (total_second_c2 - k). So for each of the k copies, the first term would contribute (total_second_c2 -k). But when summed over all k copies, that term would be k*(total_second_c2 -k). But the actual number of pairs between these same strings and others with same second but different first would be (total_second_c2 -k) multiplied by k, but since each pair between same and others is counted once per same string. Wait, perhaps this approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is correct. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input given in the problem's note:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst test case: n=5, the strings are \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\".\n\nWait, the first test case's example says the pairs are (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"cc\"). So total 5 pairs.\n\nLet me see how the formula would compute this.\n\nFirst, let's compute for each string:\n\nTake \"ab\" (c1='a', c2='b'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['b'] is 2 (since \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\" have second 'b'? Wait wait, let me see the example's first test case's note:\n\nWait the first test case's example says the pairs are:\n\n(\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\nWait the strings must be \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\". So the second characters for each:\n\nab: 'b'\n\ncb: 'b'\n\ndb: 'b'\n\naa: 'a'\n\ncc: 'c'\n\nSo second_char_counts for 'b' is 3 (from ab, cb, db), 'a' is 1 (aa), 'c' is 1 (cc).\n\nfirst_char_counts:\n\na: 2 (ab and aa)\n\nc: 2 (cb and cc)\n\nd:1 (db)\n\nSo for \"ab\" (c1='a', c2='b'):\n\ncontribution is (second_char_counts['b'] - freq[\"ab\"]) + (first_char_counts['a'] - freq[\"ab\"])\n\nfreq[\"ab\"] is 1.\n\nSo (3-1) + (2-1) = 2 +1 =3.\n\nSimilarly for \"cb\" (c1='c', c2='b'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['b'] is 3, so (3-1) (since freq[\"cb\"] is 1) plus first_char_counts['c'] is 2 (since \"cb\" and \"cc\"), so (2-1) =1. So total 2+1=3.\n\n\"db\" (c1='d', c2='b'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['b'] is 3, so (3-1) =2. first_char_counts['d'] is 1, so (1-1)=0. So total 2+0=2.\n\n\"aa\" (c1='a', c2='a'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['a'] is 1. (1-1)=0. first_char_counts['a'] is 2, so (2-1)=1. So total 0+1=1.\n\n\"cc\" (c1='c', c2='c'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['c'] is 1. (1-1)=0. first_char_counts['c'] is 2, so (2-1)=1. So 0+1=1.\n\nNow sum all contributions: 3 +3 +2 +1 +1 = 10. Then divide by 2 gives 5, which matches the sample. So the formula works here.\n\nAnother test case: the second example in the note, which has 6 pairs. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the strings are \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\".\n\nWait the note says the second test case's pairs are 6. Let me see:\n\nWait the note says the second test case's pairs are (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\"), (\"ca\", \"aa\") \u2014 but wait, but pairs are counted with i<j. So the actual pairs are (aa,ac), (aa,ca), (aa,cc?), but the note's example says the second test case's pairs are 6? Wait the note says:\n\n\"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\" Wait but that's 6 entries, but some are duplicates. Wait no, the pairs are unordered? Wait no, the problem says pairs (i,j) with i<j. So the pairs (ac, aa) would not be counted if ac comes after aa. So perhaps the actual test case has 4 strings: \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\".\n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose the four strings are \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\".\n\nThen for each string:\n\n\"aa\" (a,a):\n\nsecond_char_counts['a'] is 2 (aa and ac?), no, wait second character of \"aa\" is 'a', \"ac\" is 'c', \"ca\" is 'a', \"cc\" is 'c'.\n\nWait second_char_counts for 'a' would be 2 (aa and ca), 'c' is 2 (ac and cc).\n\nFirst_char_counts: a: 2 (aa and ac?), no, first character of \"aa\" is a, \"ac\" is a, \"ca\" is c, \"cc\" is c. So first_char_counts for 'a' is 2 (aa and ac), 'c' is 2 (ca and cc).\n\nSo for \"aa\":\n\ncontribution is (second_char_counts['a'] - freq[\"aa\"]) + (first_char_counts['a'] - freq[\"aa\"])\n\nsecond_char_counts['a'] is 2 (aa and ca?), wait \"aa\" has second 'a', \"ca\" has second 'a'? Yes. So second_char_counts['a'] is 2 (aa and ca). So (2-1) (since freq[\"aa\"] is 1) plus (2-1) (since first_char_counts['a'] is 2, minus 1 for \"aa\") \u2192 1 +1 =2.\n\n\"ac\" (a,c):\n\nsecond_char is 'c', so second_char_counts['c'] is 2 (ac and cc). So (2-1) =1. first_char_counts['a'] is 2, so (2-1)=1. So total 2.\n\n\"ca\" (c,a):\n\nsecond_char is 'a', so (2-1) (since freq[\"ca\"] is 1). first_char_counts['c'] is 2 (ca and cc). (2-1)=1. So total 1+1=2.\n\n\"cc\" (c,c):\n\nsecond_char_counts['c'] is 2 \u2192 (2-1)=1. first_char_counts['c'] is 2 \u2192 (2-1)=1. So total 2.\n\nTotal sum is 2+2+2+2 =8 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 4. But the sample says 6 pairs. Wait that's conflicting. Hmm, so maybe my approach is wrong here.\n\nWait the sample says the second test case has 6 pairs. Let me recheck the example's note:\n\n\"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\" Wait, but some of these are duplicates when considering i<j. For example, (\"ac\", \"aa\") would be invalid since i must be less than j. So perhaps the actual pairs are:\n\nAssuming the order of the strings is \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\".\n\nThen the valid pairs (i<j):\n\naa & ac \u2192 yes (diff in second character).\n\naa & ca \u2192 first characters differ (a vs c), second same (a). So yes.\n\naa & cc \u2192 first a vs c, second a vs c \u2192 two differences \u2192 no.\n\nac & ca \u2192 first a vs c, second c vs a \u2192 two differences \u2192 no.\n\nac & cc \u2192 first a vs c \u2192 different, second c vs c \u2192 same \u2192 yes (diff in first).\n\nca & cc \u2192 first same (c), second a vs c \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the valid pairs are:\n\n(aa,ac), (aa,ca), (ac,cc), (ca,cc), (ac, ca?) Wait no, ac and ca: first a vs c (diff), second c vs a (diff) \u2192 two differences \u2192 no.\n\nWait let me list all possible pairs:\n\nTotal 4C2 =6 pairs:\n\n1. (0,1) \u2192 aa & ac \u2192 same first, different second \u2192 yes \u2192 count.\n\n2. (0,2) \u2192 aa & ca \u2192 first different, second same \u2192 yes.\n\n3. (0,3) \u2192 aa & cc \u2192 first different (a vs c), second a vs c \u2192 two differences \u2192 no.\n\n4. (1,2) \u2192 ac & ca \u2192 first a vs c (diff), second c vs a (diff) \u2192 two \u2192 no.\n\n5. (1,3) \u2192 ac & cc \u2192 first a vs c (diff), second same \u2192 yes.\n\n6. (2,3) \u2192 ca & cc \u2192 first same (c), second a vs c \u2192 yes.\n\nSo total 4 valid pairs. But the note says 6. Wait that's conflicting. Wait the note's example says the second test case has 6 pairs. So perhaps I misunderstood the example's input.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\" \n\nWait that's 6 entries, but some are duplicates when considering i<j. For example, (\"ac\", \"aa\") is the same as (\"aa\", \"ac\") but reversed. So perhaps the note is wrong, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second test case has more strings. Let me re-read the note's second example's description:\n\n\"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\" \n\nWait that's 6 pairs, but some are duplicates. So perhaps the actual input has 5 strings? Or maybe I made a mistake in the example's analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case's input is different. Let me think again. Let me see the note's second example's pairs:\n\nThe pairs listed are:\n\n(\"aa\", \"ac\") \u2192 valid.\n\n(\"aa\", \"ca\") \u2192 valid.\n\n(\"cc\", \"ac\") \u2192 first c vs a (diff), second c vs c \u2192 no, wait first is c vs a? Wait \"cc\" is first 'c', \"ac\" first 'a' \u2192 different first, same second (c vs c). So yes, that's one difference \u2192 valid.\n\n(\"cc\", \"ca\") \u2192 first same (c), second c vs a \u2192 yes.\n\n(\"ac\", \"aa\") \u2192 same as first pair but reversed \u2192 but since i<j, this would not be counted unless ac comes before aa, which it wouldn't if the order is as I assumed.\n\nHmm, perhaps the actual input for the second test case has more strings. Let me think of the example's note's second case's pairs:\n\nThe pairs listed include (\"cc\", \"ac\") and (\"cc\", \"ca\"). So \"cc\" is paired with \"ac\" and \"ca\".\n\n\"ac\" has first 'a', second 'c'.\n\n\"cc\" has first 'c', second 'c'.\n\nSo their first characters differ, second same \u2192 yes.\n\n\"ca\" has first 'c', second 'a'.\n\nSo \"cc\" and \"ca\" have first same, second different \u2192 yes.\n\nSo those are valid.\n\nThen the pairs are:\n\naa-ac \u2192 yes.\n\naa-ca \u2192 yes.\n\ncc-ac \u2192 yes.\n\ncc-ca \u2192 yes.\n\nac-aa \u2192 no (since i must be less than j).\n\nca-aa \u2192 no.\n\nWait but the note lists 6 pairs. So perhaps there are more strings. Maybe the second test case has 5 strings?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case's input is \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\", and another string like \"ac\" again?\n\nWait maybe the second test case has 4 strings but the count is 6? That can't be. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my formula is incorrect. Let me recalculate for the second example.\n\nSuppose the second test case has 4 strings: \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\".\n\nThe total sum according to the formula would be:\n\nEach string's contribution:\n\n\"aa\" \u2192 2 (as before).\n\n\"ac\" \u2192 let's see:\n\nc1 is 'a', c2 is 'c'.\n\nsecond_char_counts['c'] is 2 (ac and cc). So (2-1) =1.\n\nfirst_char_counts['a'] is 2 (aa and ac). So (2-1)=1. So total 2.\n\n\"ca\" (c1 'c', c2 'a'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['a'] is 2 (aa and ca). (2-1)=1.\n\nfirst_char_counts['c'] is 2 (ca and cc). (2-1)=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\n\"cc\" (c1 'c', c2 'c'):\n\nsecond_char_counts['c'] is 2 \u2192 (2-1)=1.\n\nfirst_char_counts['c'] is 2 \u2192 (2-1)=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nTotal sum is 2+2+2+2 =8 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 4, but the sample says 6. So discrepancy here. So my approach must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample's second test case's answer is 6, but according to the formula, it gives 4. So there's a mistake in the approach.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: pairs (i,j) with i<j such that the two strings differ in exactly one position. So for two strings s and t, they must have exactly one differing character.\n\nIn the second example's note, the pairs listed include (\"cc\", \"ac\") \u2192 which is first characters differ (c vs a), second same (c vs c). So that's exactly one difference \u2192 valid.\n\n(\"cc\", \"ca\") \u2192 first same (c), second different (c vs a) \u2192 valid.\n\n(\"aa\", \"ac\") \u2192 first same, second different \u2192 valid.\n\n(\"aa\", \"ca\") \u2192 first different (a vs c), second same (a vs a) \u2192 valid.\n\n(\"ac\", \"cc\") \u2192 same as (\"cc\", \"ac\") but since i<j, if ac comes before cc, then it's counted once.\n\nWait in the example's note, the pairs listed include (\"cc\", \"ac\") and (\"cc\", \"ca\"), but also (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\") which would be invalid if the order is such that aa comes first. So perhaps the actual input has more strings?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second test case has 5 strings. Let me think of another possibility.\n\nSuppose the second test case has 5 strings: \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\", \"ac\".\n\nThen the count for \"ac\" would be higher.\n\nWait but the note's example says the second test case's pairs include (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\"), which would be duplicates if the order is considered. Hmm, perhaps the actual input has 5 strings, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my formula is missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait the formula counts for each string s, the number of other strings that differ in exactly one position. So the total sum over all s of (count1 + count2) is equal to twice the total number of valid pairs. Because each pair (s1, s2) is counted once in s1's contribution and once in s2's.\n\nSo in the second example, if the correct answer is 6, then the total sum would be 12. So perhaps my calculation was wrong.\n\nWait let me recalculate for the second example with 4 strings:\n\nThe four strings are \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\".\n\nThe valid pairs are:\n\n1. (aa, ac) \u2192 yes \u2192 contributes 1.\n\n2. (aa, ca) \u2192 yes \u2192 contributes 1.\n\n3. (aa, cc) \u2192 no.\n\n4. (ac, ca) \u2192 no.\n\n5. (ac, cc) \u2192 yes \u2192 contributes 1.\n\n6. (ca, cc) \u2192 yes \u2192 contributes 1.\n\nTotal 4 pairs. So the correct answer is 4, but the note says 6. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misunderstood the note's example.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\").\"\n\nWait that's 6 pairs, but some are duplicates. For example, (\"ac\", \"aa\") is the same as (\"aa\", \"ac\") but reversed. Since the problem requires i<j, those are considered the same pair and only counted once. So the note's example must have a different input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case has more strings. Let me think of another possibility.\n\nSuppose the second test case has 5 strings: \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\", \"ac\".\n\nThen the pairs would include:\n\nBetween the two \"ac\" strings: they are the same, so no contribution.\n\nBut the other pairs would add more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case's input is \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\", \"ac\".\n\nThen the valid pairs would be:\n\nBetween \"aa\" and each of the two \"ac\" \u2192 two pairs.\n\n\"aa\" and \"ca\" \u2192 1.\n\n\"aa\" and \"cc\" \u2192 no.\n\nBetween the two \"ac\" and \"ca\" \u2192 no.\n\nBetween the two \"ac\" and \"cc\" \u2192 each \"ac\" with \"cc\" \u2192 two pairs.\n\n\"ca\" and \"cc\" \u2192 1.\n\n\"ac\" (the first) and \"ca\" \u2192 no.\n\n\"ac\" (the second) and \"ca\" \u2192 no.\n\n\"ac\" (first) and \"ac\" (second) \u2192 no.\n\n\"cc\" and \"ac\" (each) \u2192 two.\n\n\"cc\" and \"ca\" \u2192 1.\n\nSo total pairs:\n\naa-ac1 \u2192 yes.\n\naa-ac2 \u2192 yes.\n\naa-ca \u2192 yes.\n\nac1-cc \u2192 yes.\n\nac2-cc \u2192 yes.\n\nca-cc \u2192 yes.\n\nac1 and ac2 \u2192 no.\n\nac1 and ca \u2192 no.\n\nac2 and ca \u2192 no.\n\nSo total 6 pairs. That would match the note's example. So the input must have 5 strings, including two \"ac\".\n\nIn that case, let's recalculate the formula.\n\nThe strings are \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\".\n\nSo first_char_counts:\n\na: 3 (aa, ac, ac).\n\nc: 2 (ca, cc).\n\nsecond_char_counts:\n\na: 2 (aa, ca).\n\nc: 3 (ac, ac, cc).\n\nNow for each string:\n\n\"aa\" (a,a):\n\nsecond_char_counts['a'] is 2 \u2192 (2-1) (since freq[\"aa\"]=1).\n\nfirst_char_counts['a'] is 3 \u2192 (3-1)=2.\n\nTotal contribution: 1+2 =3.\n\n\"ac\" (first occurrence):\n\nc1 is a, c2 is c.\n\nsecond_char_counts['c'] is 3 \u2192 (3 - 2) (since freq[\"ac\"] is 2? Wait, no. Wait the frequency of \"ac\" is 2 (since there are two \"ac\" strings). So for the first \"ac\", the freq[\"ac\"] is 2.\n\nSo (3 - 2) =1.\n\nfirst_char_counts['a'] is 3 \u2192 (3-2)=1 (since the count of \"ac\" is 2, so the first term is 3-2=1).\n\nSo contribution is 1+1=2.\n\nSecond \"ac\" (same as first):\n\nSame calculation \u2192 2.\n\n\"ca\" (c,a):\n\nsecond_char_counts['a'] is 2 \u2192 (2-1)=1 (since freq[\"ca\"]=1).\n\nfirst_char_counts['c'] is 2 \u2192 (2-1)=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\n\"cc\" (c,c):\n\nsecond_char_counts['c'] is 3 \u2192 (3-1)=2 (since freq[\"cc\"]=1).\n\nfirst_char_counts['c'] is 2 \u2192 (2-1)=1 \u2192 total 3.\n\nNow sum all contributions:\n\n3 (aa) + 2 (first ac) + 2 (second ac) + 2 (ca) + 3 (cc) \u2192 total 3+2+2+2+3 =12 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 6, which matches the sample.\n\nAh, so the formula works when the input has duplicates. So the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. So the plan is:\n\n- For each test case:\n\n   - Read n strings.\n\n   - Count the frequency of each string (using a map or unordered_map).\n\n   - Count the frequency of first characters (first_char_counts).\n\n   - Count the frequency of second characters (second_char_counts).\n\n   - For each string s in the list, compute its contribution as (second_char_counts[s[1]] - freq[s]) + (first_char_counts[s[0]] - freq[s]).\n\n   - Sum all contributions, then divide by 2 to get the answer.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nNow, looking at the code provided:\n\nThe code skeleton is:\n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\nusing namespace std;\nint main(){ \nint t;cin>>t;\nwhile(t--){\n   long long nu,n=0;cin>>nu;\n  map<string,int>m1;\n  map<char ,int>m2,m3;\n  while(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n   }cout<<n<<endl;\n}\n}\n\nHmm, the variables are named a bit confusingly. Let's see:\n\nThe code has variables nu (which is n for the test case), and n is initialized to 0. The code is supposed to compute n as the answer, but in the loop, it's using nu as the number of strings. So perhaps the code should be adjusted.\n\nWait the code's variables:\n\nIn the loop:\n\nlong long nu, n=0; cin>>nu;\n\nSo nu is the number of strings for the test case. The variable n is initialized to 0, and the code is supposed to compute the answer and store it in n, then output it.\n\nThe code has m1 as a map<string, int>, which can be used to store the frequency of each string.\n\nm2 and m3 are maps of char to int. Perhaps m2 is for first_char_counts and m3 for second_char_counts.\n\nThe loop over nu (the number of strings) is where we need to read each string, update the frequency maps.\n\nSo inside the loop where nu--:\n\nWe need to read the string s.\n\nThen, for each s:\n\n- Increment m1[s] by 1.\n\n- Increment m2[s[0]] by 1 (first character counts).\n\n- Increment m3[s[1]] by 1 (second character counts).\n\nOnce all strings are read, we can compute the total.\n\nThen, for each string s in the list of all strings, we need to compute its contribution and add to the total.\n\nWait but how to iterate over all the strings again? Because the code currently reads the strings but doesn't store them. So the problem is that the code reads the strings one by one, but to compute the contribution for each, we need to have all the strings stored.\n\nAh, right. The current code doesn't store the list of strings. So we need to store them in a vector or array.\n\nSo the code needs to be modified to store all the strings in a vector.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInside each test case:\n\n- Read nu (n).\n\n- Initialize m1, m2, m3 as before.\n\n- Also, create a vector<string> to store all the strings.\n\n- Then, for each of the nu strings:\n\n   read the string s.\n\n   add to the vector.\n\n   update m1, m2, m3.\n\n- After reading all strings, compute the total.\n\nSo the code needs to have a vector to store the strings.\n\nLooking back at the code provided, the user's code currently has:\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nInside this loop, the code must read the string, store it in a vector, and update the maps.\n\nSo first, in the code, after declaring m1, m2, m3, we need to declare a vector<string> v.\n\nSo inside the while(t--):\n\n   long long nu; cin >> nu;\n\n   vector<string> v;\n\n   map<string, int> m1;\n\n   map<char, int> m2, m3;\n\n   while(nu--){\n\n      string s; cin >> s;\n\n      v.push_back(s);\n\n      m1[s]++;\n\n      m2[s[0]]++;\n\n      m3[s[1]]++;\n\n   }\n\nThen, after reading all strings, compute the total.\n\nThe total is initialized to 0.\n\nlong long total =0;\n\nfor each string s in v:\n\n   char c1 = s[0], c2 = s[1];\n\n   int cnt_s = m1[s];\n\n   int part1 = m3[c2] - cnt_s; // second_char_counts[c2] is m3[c2]\n\n   int part2 = m2[c1] - cnt_s;\n\n   total += (part1 + part2);\n\nThen, the answer is total / 2.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nAfter reading all the strings:\n\nlong long ans = total / 2;\n\ncout << ans << endl;\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, the code provided by the user has some variables named n and nu. Let me see:\n\nIn the code:\n\nint main(){ \nint t;cin>>t;\nwhile(t--){\n   long long nu,n=0;cin>>nu;\n  map<string,int>m1;\n  map<char ,int>m2,m3;\n  while(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n   }cout<<n<<endl;\n}\n}\n\nThe variable n is initialized to 0, and the code is supposed to compute the answer and store it in n, then output n. So in the code, after computing the total, we need to set n = total / 2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\n- Read nu (number of strings).\n\n- Initialize vector v.\n\n- Read each string, store in v, and update m1, m2, m3.\n\n- Compute total as sum over all s in v of ( (m3[s[1]] - m1[s]) + (m2[s[0]] - m1[s]) )\n\n- Then, n = total / 2.\n\n- Output n.\n\nSo the code needs to be filled in with these steps.\n\nNow, the code currently has the while(nu--) loop where the user must read the strings and update the maps and store them in a vector.\n\nSo the missing code inside the while(nu--) loop is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nv.push_back(s);\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nm2[s[0]]++;\n\nm3[s[1]]++;\n\nBut the code currently doesn't have the vector v declared. So the user's code is missing that.\n\nWait the original code provided by the user has:\n\nmap<string,int>m1;\n\nmap<char ,int>m2,m3;\n\nBut no vector. So the user's code must be modified to include a vector to store the strings.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to be adjusted to include a vector<string> v; before the while(nu--) loop.\n\nSo the code inside the test case loop would be:\n\nvector<string> v;\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    v.push_back(s);\n    m1[s]++;\n    m2[s[0]]++;\n    m3[s[1]]++;\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, compute the total:\n\nlong long total =0;\n\nfor (const string& s : v) {\n    char c1 = s[0], c2 = s[1];\n    int cnt = m1[s];\n    total += (m3[c2] - cnt) + (m2[c1] - cnt);\n}\n\nn = total / 2;\n\ncout << n << endl;\n\nSo putting all together, the missing code inside the while(nu--) loop is the reading of the string and updating the maps and vector.\n\nBut the user's code currently has the while(nu--) loop with a comment. So the code to fill in is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nv.push_back(s);\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nm2[s[0]]++;\n\nm3[s[1]]++;\n\nBut the code also needs to declare the vector v before the loop.\n\nWait the original code's code block inside the test case is:\n\nmap<string,int>m1;\nmap<char ,int>m2,m3;\nwhile(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo to add the vector, the code must have:\n\nvector<string> v;\n\nbefore the while loop.\n\nSo the complete code for the test case would be:\n\nvector<string> v;\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    v.push_back(s);\n    m1[s]++;\n    m2[s[0]]++;\n    m3[s[1]]++;\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, compute the total and set n.\n\nBut the user's code currently has 'n' initialized to 0, and the code must compute the answer into n.\n\nSo after the while loop, the code must have:\n\nlong long total =0;\n\nfor (const auto& s : v) {\n    char c1 = s[0], c2 = s[1];\n    int cnt = m1[s];\n    total += (m3[c2] - cnt) + (m2[c1] - cnt);\n}\n\nn = total / 2;\n\ncout << n << endl;\n\nBut the user's code currently has 'cout << n << endl;' after the while loop, so the code must be inserted between the while loop and the cout.\n\nPutting all together, the code inside the test case loop would be:\n\nvector<string> v;\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    v.push_back(s);\n    m1[s]++;\n    m2[s[0]]++;\n    m3[s[1]]++;\n}\n\nlong long total =0;\n\nfor (const auto& s : v) {\n    char c1 = s[0], c2 = s[1];\n    int cnt = m1[s];\n    total += (m3[c2] - cnt) + (m2[c1] - cnt);\n}\n\nn = total / 2;\n\ncout << n << endl;\n\nBut the user's code currently has 'n' initialized to 0, and the code must compute the answer into n.\n\nNow, the problem is that the user's code may not have the vector declared. So the code must be filled in with the vector declaration and the loop code.\n\nBut the user's code's current code block inside the test case is:\n\nmap<string,int>m1;\nmap<char ,int>m2,m3;\nwhile(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nFirst, declare the vector:\n\nvector<string> v;\n\nThen, inside the while loop:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nv.push_back(s);\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nm2[s[0]]++;\n\nm3[s[1]]++;\n\nThen, after the loop, compute the total and set n.\n\nSo the code to fill in the TODO is the reading of the string and updating the maps and vector.\n\nBut the user's code also needs to have the vector declared before the loop.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the test case loop should be:\n\nvector<string> v;\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    v.push_back(s);\n    m1[s]++;\n    m2[s[0]]++;\n    m3[s[1]]++;\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, compute the total and set n.\n\nBut the user's code currently has the 'n' variable, so after the loop, the code must compute the total and set n = total / 2.\n\nSo the code after the loop would be:\n\nlong long total =0;\n\nfor (const auto& s : v) {\n    char c1 = s[0], c2 = s[1];\n    int cnt = m1[s];\n    total += (m3[c2] - cnt) + (m2[c1] - cnt);\n}\n\nn = total / 2;\n\ncout << n << endl;\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO is the part inside the while loop, which is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nv.push_back(s);\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nm2[s[0]]++;\n\nm3[s[1]]++;\n\nBut the vector v must be declared before the loop. So the code must also include the declaration of v.\n\nHowever, the user's code currently has the maps declared, but not the vector. So the code must be:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nvector<string> v; // declare the vector\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    v.push_back(s);\n    m1[s]++;\n    m2[s[0]]++;\n    m3[s[1]]++;\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, compute the total and set n.\n\nBut the user's code's current code block inside the test case has the maps declared, but not the vector. So the code must be filled with the vector declaration and the loop code.\n\nTherefore, the code to fill in the TODO is the code inside the while loop, which is the reading of the string and updating the maps and vector. But the vector must be declared before the loop.\n\nHowever, the user's code's current code block inside the test case is:\n\nmap<string,int>m1;\nmap<char ,int>m2,m3;\nwhile(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the code to fill in the TODO is the code inside the loop, but the vector must be declared before the loop. So the code must be:\n\nvector<string> v; // declare the vector before the loop\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    v.push_back(s);\n    m1[s]++;\n    m2[s[0]]++;\n    m3[s[1]]++;\n}\n\nBut the user's code's current code block has the maps declared, so the vector must be added there.\n\nTherefore, the complete code for the test case loop would be:\n\nvector<string> v;\n\nmap<string,int>m1;\nmap<char ,int>m2,m3;\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    v.push_back(s);\n    m1[s]++;\n    m2[s[0]]++;\n    m3[s[1]]++;\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, compute the total and set n.\n\nBut the user's code currently has the maps declared before the loop, so the vector must be added there.\n\nTherefore, the code to fill in the TODO is the code inside the loop, but the vector must be declared before the loop.\n\nHowever, the problem says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The user's code currently has the while loop with the TODO comment. The missing code inside the loop is the code to read the string and update the maps and vector. But the vector must be declared before the loop.\n\nTherefore, the code to be filled in the TODO is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nv.push_back(s);\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nm2[s[0]]++;\n\nm3[s[1]]++;\n\nBut the vector v must be declared before the loop. So the code must also include the declaration of v.\n\nBut the user's code currently has the maps declared before the loop. So the code must be:\n\nvector<string> v; // declare the vector before the loop\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    v.push_back(s);\n    m1[s]++;\n    m2[s[0]]++;\n    m3[s[1]]++;\n}\n\nBut the user's code's current code block inside the test case has the maps declared, so the vector must be added there.\n\nTherefore, the code to be filled in the TODO is the code inside the loop, but the vector must be declared before the loop. However, the problem says to output only the missing code that fills in the TODO block. The TODO is inside the while loop's body. So the code inside the loop is the part to be filled.\n\nBut the vector must be declared before the loop. So the user's code currently has the loop's body as the TODO, but the vector is not declared. So the code to fill in the TODO is the code inside the loop, but the vector must be declared before the loop. However, the problem requires to output only the missing code for the TODO block. So perhaps the vector is not part of the TODO's code, but the code inside the loop is.\n\nWait the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. Output the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or any additional information.\"\n\nThe user's code has the TODO inside the while loop's body. So the code to fill in the TODO is the code inside the loop. The vector must be declared before the loop, but that's not part of the TODO's code. So perhaps the user's code is missing the vector declaration, but the problem requires to fill in the TODO block only.\n\nWait the user's code currently has:\n\nmap<string,int>m1;\nmap<char ,int>m2,m3;\nwhile(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the code inside the loop is the TODO. The vector must be declared before the loop, but that's not part of the loop's body. So the user's code is missing the vector declaration, but the problem requires to fill in the code inside the loop.\n\nTherefore, the code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\nm1[s]++;\nm2[s[0]]++;\nm3[s[1]]++;\n\nBut this is missing the vector part. However, without storing the strings in a vector, the code can't compute the total later. So the code must store the strings in a vector. Therefore, the code inside the loop must also push the string into the vector. But the vector must be declared before the loop.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the loop must be:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\nv.push_back(s);\nm1[s]++;\nm2[s[0]]++;\nm3[s[1]]++;\n\nBut the vector v must be declared before the loop. Since the problem requires to output only the missing code for the TODO block (inside the loop), the code to be filled is the above lines, assuming that the vector v is declared before the loop.\n\nHowever, the user's code currently does not have the vector declared. So the code is incomplete. But the problem says to output only the missing code for the TODO block. So perhaps the user is expected to assume that the vector is declared, and the code inside the loop is the part to be filled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use a different approach without storing all the strings. For example, compute the total on the fly, but that would require more complex steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use a map to track the counts and compute the total without storing all the strings. Let me think:\n\nThe total can be computed by considering all pairs of strings that differ in exactly one character. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible pair of characters (c1, c2), we can compute how many strings have that pair, and then for each possible variation, compute the contributions.\n\nWait, perhaps the total can be computed using the frequency map.\n\nThe total number of pairs that differ in exactly one position is equal to:\n\nsum over all pairs of strings (s, t) where s comes before t, and they differ in exactly one position.\n\nBut to compute this efficiently, perhaps we can iterate over all possible pairs of strings that can form such pairs.\n\nBut that's O(26^2 * 26^2), which is manageable since 26^4 is about 450k.\n\nWait, each string is a pair of two characters (each from a to k, so 11 letters). So there are 11*11 = 121 possible strings.\n\nSo for each possible string s, and for each possible string t that differs from s in exactly one character, the number of pairs between s and t is (count[s] * count[t]).\n\nBut since we need to count pairs (i,j) with i<j, the total would be sum over all s < t (in some order) of (count[s] * count[t] if they differ in exactly one character) plus for each s, the number of pairs within the same s (but they can't contribute since they are same strings).\n\nWait, but this approach would require iterating over all pairs of strings (s, t) where s and t differ in exactly one character, and then adding count[s] * count[t], then dividing by 2 (since each unordered pair is counted twice).\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nThe total number of pairs between s and t (where s and t are different strings) that differ in exactly one character is count[s] * count[t]. But since each pair (i,j) with i<j is counted once, the total is the sum over all ordered pairs (s, t) where s and t are different and differ in one character, and s comes before t in some order? No, perhaps it's better to compute all unordered pairs (s, t) where s != t and they differ in one character, then multiply by count[s] * count[t], and that's the total.\n\nBecause for each such pair of strings s and t (s != t), the number of pairs (i,j) where the i-th string is s and j-th is t (i<j) plus the reverse (if s and t are different but the pair is counted once when s comes before t).\n\nWait, the total number of pairs between s and t (where s and t are different) is count[s] * count[t], but each such pair (i,j) where the i-th is s and j-th is t (i<j) is counted once. But if s and t are different strings, then the total pairs between them is count[s] * count[t], but only if they are compatible (differ in exactly one character). So the total is sum over all pairs of strings (s, t) where s and t differ in exactly one character, of (count[s] * count[t]).\n\nBecause for each such pair of strings s and t (regardless of order), the number of pairs (i,j) where the i-th is s and j-th is t (i<j) plus (i-th is t and j-th is s (i<j)) is exactly count[s] * count[t].\n\nWait no, because if s and t are different, then the number of pairs where one is s and the other is t is count[s] * count[t], but each such pair (i,j) with i<j is counted once. So the total is indeed count[s] * count[t].\n\nTherefore, the total number of valid pairs is the sum over all pairs of distinct strings s and t that differ in exactly one character of (count[s] * count[t]).\n\nThis approach would be O( (number of possible strings)^2 ), which is 121^2 = 14641 operations per test case, which is manageable.\n\nThis might be a better approach because it doesn't require storing all the strings, just the frequency map.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- For each test case:\n\n   - Read all the strings and count their frequencies in a map m1.\n\n   - Iterate over all possible pairs of strings (s, t) where s and t are different and differ in exactly one character.\n\n   - For each such pair, add m1[s] * m1[t] to the total.\n\n   - The final answer is the total.\n\nThis approach avoids storing all the strings, which is better for memory, especially when n is large (like 1e5).\n\nThis might be more efficient and easier to implement.\n\nSo let's see how to implement this.\n\nFirst, generate all possible strings of length 2 from 'a' to 'k' (since the problem says letters from 'a' to 'k', which is 11 letters).\n\nWe can precompute all possible strings, then for each pair of strings, check if they differ in exactly one character.\n\nAlternatively, for each string s in the frequency map, iterate over all possible variations of s that differ in exactly one character, and accumulate the product.\n\nBut to avoid double-counting, we can process each pair once.\n\nAlternatively, for each string s in the map:\n\n   for each possible variation t of s that differs in exactly one character:\n\n      if t is present in the map:\n\n          total += m1[s] * m1[t]\n\nBut this would count each pair (s, t) twice (once when processing s and once when processing t). So we need to divide the total by 2.\n\nWait, no. For example, when processing s, we consider all t that are one-edit away from s. For each such t, the contribution is m1[s] * m1[t]. But when processing t, we also consider s, so the total would be counted twice. So the total would be sum over all ordered pairs (s, t) where s and t are one-edit apart and s != t of m1[s] * m1[t]. So the total is exactly the desired value (since each unordered pair is counted twice, but the problem counts all ordered pairs where i<j, which is exactly half of the total).\n\nWait no, the problem requires counting all pairs (i,j) with i<j and the strings differ in exactly one character. The total number of such pairs is exactly the sum over all unordered pairs {s, t} (s != t) of (count[s] * count[t]) if they are one-edit apart. Because for each such pair, there are count[s] * count[t] pairs (i,j) where the i-th is s and j-th is t (i<j) plus the reverse (if s and t are different). Wait no, if s and t are different, then the number of pairs where the first is s and second is t is count[s] * count[t], but only if s and t are one-edit apart. So the total is exactly the sum over all pairs (s, t) where s and t are one-edit apart and s != t of (count[s] * count[t]).\n\nSo the approach of iterating over all possible pairs of strings (s, t) where they are one-edit apart and s != t, and adding count[s] * count[t], gives the correct total.\n\nThe number of possible strings is 11*11=121, so the number of pairs is 121*121 = 14641, which is manageable.\n\nSo this approach is feasible.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read all the strings and count their frequencies in m1.\n\n   Initialize total to 0.\n\n   For each string s in m1:\n\n      For each possible string t that differs from s in exactly one character:\n\n          if t is in m1:\n\n              total += m1[s] * m1[t]\n\n   The answer is total / 2.\n\nWait no, because for each pair (s, t), where s and t are one-edit apart, the pair (s,t) and (t,s) are both considered in the loops. So the total would be double the desired value. Hence, dividing by 2 gives the correct answer.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose s and t are two different strings that are one-edit apart.\n\nWhen processing s, we add m1[s] * m1[t].\n\nWhen processing t, we add m1[t] * m1[s].\n\nSo the total contribution from this pair is 2 * m1[s] * m1[t].\n\nThe desired total is m1[s] * m1[t], so dividing by 2 gives the correct value.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute all possible pairs of strings s and t that are one-edit apart, and sum m1[s] * m1[t], then divide by 2.\n\nThis approach is better because it doesn't require storing all the strings, just the frequency map.\n\nSo now, the code can be written as follows:\n\nInside each test case:\n\n- Read the strings and build the frequency map m1.\n\n- Iterate over all possible pairs of strings s and t that are one-edit apart.\n\nBut how to generate all possible strings s and their variations?\n\nAlternatively, for each string s in m1:\n\n   generate all possible variations of s that differ in exactly one character.\n\n   for each such variation t:\n\n      if t is present in m1:\n\n          total += m1[s] * m1[t]\n\nThen, the total is divided by 2.\n\nThis way, each pair (s,t) is counted twice (once when processing s, once when processing t), so dividing by 2 gives the correct count.\n\nThis approach requires generating all possible variations of s that are one-edit away.\n\nTo generate the variations:\n\nFor a given string s (like \"ab\"):\n\nThe variations are:\n\n- change the first character to any other character (a to b, c, etc.), keeping the second character the same.\n\n- change the second character to any other character, keeping the first the same.\n\nSo for each character position (0 and 1), iterate over all possible characters (a to k) except the current one, and create the new string.\n\nBut this can be done as follows:\n\nFor the string s (length 2):\n\nfor (int pos =0; pos <2; pos++){\n\n    char original = s[pos];\n\n    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'k'; c++){\n\n        if (c == original) continue;\n\n        string t = s;\n\n        t[pos] = c;\n\n        // check if t is in m1\n\n        if (m1.count(t)) {\n\n            total += m1[s] * m1[t];\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut this way, for each position, we iterate over all possible characters except the original, and create the new string.\n\nThis would generate all possible one-edit variations.\n\nBut this may generate duplicates. For example, changing the first character to 'b' and then to 'c' are separate iterations, but each is unique.\n\nThis approach would generate all possible variations for each position.\n\nSo for each s in m1:\n\n   for each position (0 and 1):\n\n      for each possible character c in 'a' to 'k' except the current character:\n\n          create t by changing s's pos to c.\n\n          if t is in m1, add m1[s] * m1[t] to total.\n\nThis way, all variations are considered.\n\nThis approach is manageable.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nmap<string, int> m1;\n\n// read the strings and build m1:\n\nvector<string> v; // not needed anymore.\n\nwhile(nu--){\n\n    string s; cin >> s;\n\n    m1[s]++;\n\n}\n\nThen, compute the total:\n\nlong long total =0;\n\nfor (const auto& p : m1){\n\n    string s = p.first;\n\n    int cnt_s = p.second;\n\n    for (int pos =0; pos <2; pos++){\n\n        char original = s[pos];\n\n        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'k'; c++){\n\n            if (c == original) continue;\n\n            string t = s;\n\n            t[pos] = c;\n\n            if (m1.count(t)){\n\n                total += (long long) cnt_s * m1[t];\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nlong long ans = total / 2;\n\ncout << ans << endl;\n\nThis approach is better because it doesn't require storing all the strings, just the frequency map. This is more memory efficient, especially for large n.\n\nNow, comparing the two approaches:\n\nThe first approach requires storing all the strings in a vector (O(n) space), but the second approach uses O(121) space for the frequency map.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 1e5, the second approach is better.\n\nTherefore, the second approach is better and should be used.\n\nNow, the user's code currently has the following code inside the test case loop:\n\nmap<string,int>m1;\nmap<char ,int>m2,m3;\nwhile(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nThe code needs to read the strings and update m1.\n\nSo the code inside the loop (the TODO) is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nThe other maps (m2 and m3) are not needed in this approach.\n\nSo the code inside the loop is simply reading the string and updating m1.\n\nThen, after the loop, compute the total as described.\n\nThe code for the test case would be:\n\nmap<string, int> m1;\n\nwhile(nu--){\n    string s; cin >> s;\n    m1[s]++;\n}\n\nlong long total =0;\n\nfor (const auto& p : m1) {\n    string s = p.first;\n    int cnt_s = p.second;\n    for (int pos =0; pos <2; pos++) {\n        char original = s[pos];\n        for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'k'; c++) {\n            if (c == original) continue;\n            string t = s;\n            t[pos] = c;\n            if (m1.count(t)) {\n                total += (long long) cnt_s * m1[t];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nlong long ans = total / 2;\n\ncout << ans << endl;\n\nThis is better.\n\nNow, the user's code currently has m2 and m3 declared, which are not needed in this approach. So the code can be adjusted to remove them.\n\nThe original code's code block inside the test case is:\n\nmap<string,int>m1;\nmap<char ,int>m2,m3;\nwhile(nu--){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the code should remove m2 and m3, and replace with the above code.\n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing code for the TODO block (inside the while loop).\n\nThe code inside the loop is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nSo the missing code for the TODO is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nThe rest of the code (computing the total) is outside the loop, so it's not part of the TODO block.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is to fill the TODO with the code to read the string and update m1.\n\nThe other parts (computing the total) are outside the loop and thus not part of the missing code in the TODO block.\n\nTherefore, the correct missing code for the TODO block is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nBut the user's code also has m2 and m3 declared, which are not needed. However, the problem says to output only the missing code for the TODO block. So the code to fill in the TODO is the two lines above.\n\nBut the user's code currently has m2 and m3 declared. To make the code work, those maps should be removed, but since the problem says to output only the missing code for the TODO block, perhaps the code can be filled as such.\n\nTherefore, the correct missing code for the TODO block is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nm1[s]++;\n\nThe other parts (computing the total) are outside the loop and thus not part of the TODO block. So the user's code must be modified to include those parts after the loop.\n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing code for the TODO block. So the answer is the two lines above.\n\nHowever, the initial approach using the vector and the first method requires more code in the loop, but the second approach is better.\n\nTherefore, the correct missing code for the TODO block is the two lines to read the string and update m1.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\nstring s; cin >> s;\n\nm1[s]++;"
