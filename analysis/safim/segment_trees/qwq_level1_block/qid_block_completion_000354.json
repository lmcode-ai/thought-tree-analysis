So the maximum s is the largest integer s where the sum of all the blocks' lengths (from 1 to n) is >= s\u00b2. Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to n, then finding the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum. So first, I need to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Let's see how to compute that sum efficiently. Let me think about the formula for the sum. The ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n can be written as: For each i, ceil(i/2) = (i +1)/2 when i is odd, and i/2 when even. Alternatively, ceil(i/2) = floor((i+1)/2). So the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2) \n\nLet me compute this sum. Let's see:\n\nLet me split into even and odd terms. Suppose n is even: n = 2k. Then the terms are:\n\ni=1: 1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:2, ..., i=2k-1: k, i=2k: k. \n\nEach pair (i=2m-1 and i=2m) contributes m + m = 2m. \n\nWait, for m from 1 to k. \n\nWait, for m=1, the pair (1,2) gives 1 and 1, sum 2. Wait, ceil(1/2) is 1, ceil(2/2)=1. So sum for first two terms is 2. Wait, for m=2, the pair (3,4) gives ceil(3/2)=2 and ceil(4/2)=2, so sum 4. So each pair (2m-1, 2m) contributes 2m. So for n even (2k), the total sum is sum_{m=1 to k} 2m. \n\nWait, sum_{m=1 to k} 2m = 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) ) = k(k+1). So when n is even (n=2k), sum is k*(k+1). Wait let me check with n=2 (k=1): sum is 1+1=2, which is 1*2=2. Correct. \n\nn=4 (k=2): 1+1+2+2 =6, which is 2*3=6. Correct. Now if n is odd, say n=2k+1. Then the sum is the same as for n=2k plus the next term (i=2k+1). The term for i=2k+1 is ceil( (2k+1)/2 ) = k+1. So the total sum would be k*(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. Wait let's see for n=5 (2k+1 where k=2, so 2*2+1=5). The sum is 1+1+2+2+3 =9. Which is (2+1)^2 =9. Correct. Another example: n=3 (k=1, since 2*1+1=3). Sum is 1+1+2=4, which is (1+1)^2=4. Correct. So the formula is:\n\nif n is even (n=2k), sum is k*(k+1). if n is odd (n=2k+1), sum is (k+1)^2. So now, given n, compute the sum S(n) as follows:\n\nLet me write code for that. Wait, let me see:\n\nLet me compute k for even and odd:\n\nIf n is even:\n\nk = n/2 \u2192 sum is k*(k+1). If n is odd:\n\nk = (n-1)/2 \u2192 sum is (k+1)^2. Alternatively, for n:\n\nk = (n)//2 (integer division). Wait, for even n=2k \u2192 yes, k = n/2. For odd n=2k+1 \u2192 (n-1)/2 =k \u2192 so k = (n-1)/2. Alternatively, for any n, k = floor(n/2). Wait, for even n: floor(n/2) = n/2 \u2192 yes. For odd n: floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2 \u2192 yes. So sum can be written as:\n\nif n is even: sum = k*(k+1)\n\nif n is odd: sum = (k+1)^2, where k = floor(n/2). Alternatively, since k = floor(n/2), then:\n\nsum = (k+1)^2 when n is odd, else k*(k+1). So the sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) + (n%2) )^2 ? Wait let me see:\n\nWait for even n:\n\nsum = k*(k+1) = k^2 +k.\n\nFor odd n:\n\nsum = (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 + 2k +1. Hmm, perhaps there's a way to combine the two cases. Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be written as ( (n+1)/2 ) * ( (n)/2 +1 ) ? Wait let me see for even n=2k:\n\nsum is k*(k+1) \u2192 (k)*(k+1) \u2192 which is ( (2k)/2 ) * ( (2k)/2 +1 ) \u2192 yes, (k)*(k+1). For odd n=2k+1:\n\nsum is (k+1)^2 \u2192 ( (2k+1 +1)/2 )^2 \u2192 ( (2k+2)/2 )^2 \u2192 (k+1)^2. So yes, the sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n +1)/2 ) * ( (n)/2 + 1 ) ? Wait, no. Wait for even n=2k:\n\n(n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 not integer. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n div 2) ) * ( (n +1) div 2 ) Wait let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\nn div 2 is k, (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 but (n+1) div 2 is k. So (k)*(k) \u2192 no, that's not right. Hmm, maybe better to stick with the original approach. So, given n, compute k = n//2 (integer division). Then, if n is even, sum is k*(k+1). If n is odd, sum is (k+1)^2. So, the sum can be written as:\n\nsum = (k + (n%2)) * (k +1) ? Wait let's see for even n:\n\nsum =k*(k+1). For odd n: (k+1)^2 = (k+1)*(k+1). So, (k + (n%2)) is k +1 when n is odd (since n%2 is 1), and k when even (since n%2 is 0). So yes, sum = (k + (n%2)) * (k+1) ?\n\nWait for even n:\n\nk + (n%2) =k +0 =k \u2192 so k*(k+1). For odd n: (k+1)*(k+1) \u2192 yes. So that formula works. Alternatively, sum = (k + (n%2))*(k+1). So that's a way to compute the sum.",

Because s^2 must be \u2264 sum. The largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum is floor(sqrt(sum)). Wait, but let me confirm with the example given. In the example where n=5, the sum is 9. sqrt(9) is 3, so s is 3. Which matches the sample output. Another example: n=1. The sum is ceil(1/2)=1. So s is 1. Which matches the note. Another test case: n=2. The sum is 1+1=2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so floor is 1. So the output is 1. Wait, but according to the code's current structure, when n is even, the code is in the if block (n%2==0), but the else part (for odd) is printing n/2+1. Wait, let's see. Wait the code currently has:\n\nif(n%2==0) { ... } else { System.out.println(n/2 +1); }\n\nWait, for n odd, the code is outputting (n/2 +1). Let's see for n=5, n/2 is 2 (since integer division), so 2+1=3, which is correct. For n=3, 3/2=1 \u2192 2 \u2192 correct. For n=1, 0+1=1 \u2192 correct. So for the odd case, the code is correct. But for even n, the code is in the if block, and the current code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". So the problem is to fill in the code for even n. So for even n, the sum is k*(k+1), where k = n/2. The maximum s is floor( sqrt( sum ) ). So for even n, the code should compute the sum, then compute s as (int)Math.sqrt(sum), but need to check if s squared is indeed <= sum. Wait, but how to compute s correctly. Alternatively, since sum is k*(k+1), which is k\u00b2 +k. \n\nWe can compute s as the integer part of sqrt(k*(k+1)). Let me see for even n=2k:\n\nsum =k*(k+1). What is sqrt(k*(k+1))? It's between k and k+1, since k\u00b2 <k(k+1) < (k+1)^2. Wait, k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. \n\n(k+0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25. So k(k+1) is less than (k+0.5)^2. Wait, so sqrt(k(k+1)) is less than k+0.5. Wait, let me see for k=2: sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)=~2.449, which is less than 2.5. So sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+0.5. Thus, the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)) is k. \n\nWait, but wait, let's see:\n\nWait for k=2, sqrt(6) is ~2.449 \u2192 floor is 2. So s would be 2. But the sum is 6, so s^2 is 4, which is less than 6. Wait, but the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u22646 is 2, since 3\u00b2 is 9>6. So that's correct. Another example: k=3 (n=6). sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. 3\u00b2=9 \u226412. Yes. Another example: k=1 (n=2). sum is 2 \u2192 sqrt(2)=1.414 \u2192 floor 1. Which is correct. Wait, but what if the sum is exactly a perfect square? Suppose k=0 (n=0? Not possible here). Wait, let's see for k=8 (n=16). sum is 8*9=72. sqrt(72)=8.485 \u2192 floor 8. 8\u00b2=64 \u226472. But 8.485's floor is 8. Wait, but 8\u00b2 is 64, which is less than 72. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Wait, the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum. So for even n, sum is k*(k+1). We can compute s as the integer part of sqrt(k*(k+1)), which is floor(sqrt(k*(k+1))). But let's see for k*(k+1). Let me think of s_max = floor( sqrt(k*(k+1)) ) But since k*(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2, the floor is k. \n\nWait, because (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 +2k +1. \n\nk*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. \n\nSo k\u00b2 +k < (k+1)^2 \u2192 so sqrt(k(k+1)) <k+1. Thus, the floor is k. \n\nWait, so for even n, the maximum s is k. \n\nWait, but let me check with k=3 (sum 12). s_max is 3, which is correct. \n\nk=2 (sum 6 \u2192 s_max 2). k=1 (sum 2 \u2192 s_max 1). Yes. So for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2. Wait, but wait, let me see another example. Suppose n=4 (k=2). sum is 6. s_max is 2. But 2\u00b2 is 4 \u22646. But could we get s=2.449? No, since s must be integer. So the maximum s is indeed 2. Wait, but what if the sum is 8? Let's see, for example, n=4, sum is 6. Wait, but let's take another example where sum is 8. Wait, for n=5 (odd), sum is 9 \u2192 s=3. Wait, but for even n=5? No, n must be even. Wait, let's think of n=6 (k=3). sum is 12. s_max is 3. \n\n3\u00b2 is 9 \u226412. Yes. So for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2. Wait, but then why does the code for the odd case output (n/2 +1)? Because for odd n, the sum is (k+1)^2, where k = (n-1)/2. So (k+1) is (n+1)/2. So the maximum s is (k+1) \u2192 which is exactly (n+1)/2. Wait, for n=5, (5+1)/2 =3 \u2192 correct. For n=3, (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 correct. So for odd n, the maximum s is (n+1)/2. Which is exactly what the code is outputting. Wait, the code for the else (odd) case is System.out.println(n/2 +1). Wait, n is odd, so n/2 is integer division, which truncates. For example, n=5 \u21925/2=2 \u2192 2+1=3. n=3 \u21923/2=1 \u21921+1=2. Yes, so that's correct. So for even n, the maximum s is k =n/2. So in the code's if block (when n is even), we can just output n/2. Wait, but let me check with n=6 (even). n=6 \u2192k=3 \u2192 output 3. Which is correct, since sum is 12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. Yes. Another example: n=2 \u2192 output 1. Correct. So the code for even n is simply to print n/2.",

Since each block is 1x length, when building a square, the square's height is 1, so the square's side length would be the same as its height? That can't be. Wait, maybe the square is built by arranging the blocks in such a way that the total area is s\u00b2, but arranged into a square of side s. Because each block's area is its length (since height is 1). So the sum of all selected blocks' lengths must be at least s\u00b2, and we need the maximum s where this is possible. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest s such that the sum of the lengths of some subset of the blocks (from 1 to n) is at least s\u00b2. But since we can choose any subset, the maximum possible s is the largest s where the sum of all blocks' lengths (up to n) is >= s\u00b2. Because using all blocks would give the maximum possible sum, so the maximum s is the largest s where the total sum of all blocks' lengths is >= s\u00b2. \n\nWait, the problem says \"you don't have to use all of the blocks\", but to maximize s, we would want to use as many as possible. So the maximum s is the largest integer s where the sum of all the blocks' lengths (from 1 to n) is >= s\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the lengths of all blocks up to n, then finding the maximum s where s\u00b2 <= sum. \n\nSo first, I need to compute the sum of ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n. Let's see how to compute that sum efficiently. \n\nLet me think about the formula for the sum. \n\nThe ceil(i/2) for i from 1 to n can be written as:\n\nFor each i, ceil(i/2) = (i +1)/2 when i is odd, and i/2 when even. \n\nAlternatively, ceil(i/2) = floor((i+1)/2). \n\nSo the sum S(n) = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(i/2) \n\nLet me compute this sum. Let's see:\n\nLet me split into even and odd terms. \n\nSuppose n is even: n = 2k. \n\nThen the terms are:\n\ni=1: 1, i=2:1, i=3:2, i=4:2, ..., i=2k-1: k, i=2k: k. \n\nEach pair (i=2m-1 and i=2m) contributes m + m = 2m. \n\nWait, for m from 1 to k. \n\nWait, for m=1, the pair (1,2) gives 1 and 1, sum 2. \n\nWait, ceil(1/2) is 1, ceil(2/2)=1. So sum for first two terms is 2. \n\nWait, for m=2, the pair (3,4) gives ceil(3/2)=2 and ceil(4/2)=2, so sum 4. \n\nSo each pair (2m-1, 2m) contributes 2m. \n\nSo for n even (2k), the total sum is sum_{m=1 to k} 2m. \n\nWait, sum_{m=1 to k} 2m = 2*(1+2+...+k) = 2*(k(k+1)/2) ) = k(k+1). \n\nSo when n is even (n=2k), sum is k*(k+1). \n\nWait let me check with n=2 (k=1): sum is 1+1=2, which is 1*2=2. Correct. \n\nn=4 (k=2): 1+1+2+2 =6, which is 2*3=6. Correct. \n\nNow if n is odd, say n=2k+1. \n\nThen the sum is the same as for n=2k plus the next term (i=2k+1). \n\nThe term for i=2k+1 is ceil( (2k+1)/2 ) = k+1. \n\nSo the total sum would be k*(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+1) = (k+1)^2. \n\nWait let's see for n=5 (2k+1 where k=2, so 2*2+1=5). \n\nThe sum is 1+1+2+2+3 =9. Which is (2+1)^2 =9. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3 (k=1, since 2*1+1=3). Sum is 1+1+2=4, which is (1+1)^2=4. Correct. \n\nSo the formula is:\n\nif n is even (n=2k), sum is k*(k+1).\n\nif n is odd (n=2k+1), sum is (k+1)^2.\n\nSo now, given n, compute the sum S(n) as follows:\n\nLet me write code for that. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLet me compute k for even and odd:\n\nIf n is even:\n\nk = n/2 \u2192 sum is k*(k+1).\n\nIf n is odd:\n\nk = (n-1)/2 \u2192 sum is (k+1)^2.\n\nAlternatively, for n:\n\nk = (n)//2 (integer division). \n\nWait, for even n=2k \u2192 yes, k = n/2.\n\nFor odd n=2k+1 \u2192 (n-1)/2 =k \u2192 so k = (n-1)/2. \n\nAlternatively, for any n, k = floor(n/2). \n\nWait, for even n: floor(n/2) = n/2 \u2192 yes. \n\nFor odd n: floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo sum can be written as:\n\nif n is even: sum = k*(k+1)\n\nif n is odd: sum = (k+1)^2, where k = floor(n/2). \n\nAlternatively, since k = floor(n/2), then:\n\nsum = (k+1)^2 when n is odd, else k*(k+1). \n\nSo the sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n//2) + (n%2) )^2 ?\n\nWait let me see:\n\nWait for even n:\n\nsum = k*(k+1) = k^2 +k.\n\nFor odd n:\n\nsum = (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 + 2k +1. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to combine the two cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be written as ( (n+1)/2 ) * ( (n)/2 +1 ) ?\n\nWait let me see for even n=2k:\n\nsum is k*(k+1) \u2192 (k)*(k+1) \u2192 which is ( (2k)/2 ) * ( (2k)/2 +1 ) \u2192 yes, (k)*(k+1). \n\nFor odd n=2k+1:\n\nsum is (k+1)^2 \u2192 ( (2k+1 +1)/2 )^2 \u2192 ( (2k+2)/2 )^2 \u2192 (k+1)^2. \n\nSo yes, the sum can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n +1)/2 ) * ( (n)/2 + 1 ) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait for even n=2k:\n\n(n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 not integer. Hmm, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula can be written as:\n\nsum = ( (n div 2) ) * ( (n +1) div 2 )\n\nWait let's see:\n\nFor even n=2k:\n\nn div 2 is k, (n+1)/2 is (2k+1)/2 \u2192 but (n+1) div 2 is k. So (k)*(k) \u2192 no, that's not right. \n\nHmm, maybe better to stick with the original approach. \n\nSo, given n, compute k = n//2 (integer division). \n\nThen, if n is even, sum is k*(k+1). \n\nIf n is odd, sum is (k+1)^2. \n\nSo, the sum can be written as:\n\nsum = (k + (n%2)) * (k +1) ?\n\nWait let's see for even n:\n\nsum =k*(k+1). \n\nFor odd n: (k+1)^2 = (k+1)*(k+1). \n\nSo, (k + (n%2)) is k +1 when n is odd (since n%2 is 1), and k when even (since n%2 is 0). \n\nSo yes, sum = (k + (n%2)) * (k+1) ?\n\nWait for even n:\n\nk + (n%2) =k +0 =k \u2192 so k*(k+1). \n\nFor odd n: (k+1)*(k+1) \u2192 yes. \n\nSo that formula works. \n\nAlternatively, sum = (k + (n%2))*(k+1). \n\nSo that's a way to compute the sum. \n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum s such that s\u00b2 \u2264 sum. \n\nSo the maximum s is the floor of the square root of the sum. \n\nWait, exactly. Because s^2 must be \u2264 sum. The largest s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum is floor(sqrt(sum)). \n\nWait, but let me confirm with the example given. \n\nIn the example where n=5, the sum is 9. sqrt(9) is 3, so s is 3. Which matches the sample output. \n\nAnother example: n=1. The sum is ceil(1/2)=1. So s is 1. Which matches the note. \n\nAnother test case: n=2. The sum is 1+1=2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so floor is 1. So the output is 1. \n\nWait, but according to the code's current structure, when n is even, the code is in the if block (n%2==0), but the else part (for odd) is printing n/2+1. Wait, let's see. \n\nWait the code currently has:\n\nif(n%2==0) { ... } else { System.out.println(n/2 +1); }\n\nWait, for n odd, the code is outputting (n/2 +1). Let's see for n=5, n/2 is 2 (since integer division), so 2+1=3, which is correct. For n=3, 3/2=1 \u2192 2 \u2192 correct. For n=1, 0+1=1 \u2192 correct. \n\nSo for the odd case, the code is correct. \n\nBut for even n, the code is in the if block, and the current code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". So the problem is to fill in the code for even n. \n\nSo for even n, the sum is k*(k+1), where k = n/2. \n\nThe maximum s is floor( sqrt( sum ) ). \n\nSo for even n, the code should compute the sum, then compute s as (int)Math.sqrt(sum), but need to check if s squared is indeed <= sum. \n\nWait, but how to compute s correctly. \n\nAlternatively, since sum is k*(k+1), which is k\u00b2 +k. \n\nWe can compute s as the integer part of sqrt(k*(k+1)). \n\nLet me see for even n=2k:\n\nsum =k*(k+1). \n\nWhat is sqrt(k*(k+1))? \n\nIt's between k and k+1, since k\u00b2 <k(k+1) < (k+1)^2. \n\nWait, k(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. \n\n(k+0.5)^2 =k\u00b2 +k +0.25. \n\nSo k(k+1) is less than (k+0.5)^2. \n\nWait, so sqrt(k(k+1)) is less than k+0.5. \n\nWait, let me see for k=2: sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(6)=~2.449, which is less than 2.5. \n\nSo sqrt(k(k+1)) is between k and k+0.5. \n\nThus, the floor of sqrt(k(k+1)) is k. \n\nWait, but wait, let's see:\n\nWait for k=2, sqrt(6) is ~2.449 \u2192 floor is 2. \n\nSo s would be 2. \n\nBut the sum is 6, so s^2 is 4, which is less than 6. \n\nWait, but the maximum s where s\u00b2 \u22646 is 2, since 3\u00b2 is 9>6. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nAnother example: k=3 (n=6). sum is 3*4=12. sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. 3\u00b2=9 \u226412. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: k=1 (n=2). sum is 2 \u2192 sqrt(2)=1.414 \u2192 floor 1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nWait, but what if the sum is exactly a perfect square? \n\nSuppose k=0 (n=0? Not possible here). \n\nWait, let's see for k=8 (n=16). sum is 8*9=72. sqrt(72)=8.485 \u2192 floor 8. 8\u00b2=64 \u226472. \n\nBut 8.485's floor is 8. \n\nWait, but 8\u00b2 is 64, which is less than 72. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. \n\nWait, the maximum s is the largest integer s where s\u00b2 \u2264 sum. \n\nSo for even n, sum is k*(k+1). \n\nWe can compute s as the integer part of sqrt(k*(k+1)), which is floor(sqrt(k*(k+1))). \n\nBut let's see for k*(k+1). \n\nLet me think of s_max = floor( sqrt(k*(k+1)) )\n\nBut since k*(k+1) is between k\u00b2 and (k+1)^2, the floor is k. \n\nWait, because (k+1)^2 =k\u00b2 +2k +1. \n\nk*(k+1) =k\u00b2 +k. \n\nSo k\u00b2 +k < (k+1)^2 \u2192 so sqrt(k(k+1)) <k+1. \n\nThus, the floor is k. \n\nWait, so for even n, the maximum s is k. \n\nWait, but let me check with k=3 (sum 12). s_max is 3, which is correct. \n\nk=2 (sum 6 \u2192 s_max 2). \n\nk=1 (sum 2 \u2192 s_max 1). \n\nYes. \n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2. \n\nWait, but wait, let me see another example. \n\nSuppose n=4 (k=2). sum is 6. s_max is 2. \n\nBut 2\u00b2 is 4 \u22646. \n\nBut could we get s=2.449? No, since s must be integer. \n\nSo the maximum s is indeed 2. \n\nWait, but what if the sum is 8? Let's see, for example, n=4, sum is 6. \n\nWait, but let's take another example where sum is 8. \n\nWait, for n=5 (odd), sum is 9 \u2192 s=3. \n\nWait, but for even n=5? No, n must be even. \n\nWait, let's think of n=6 (k=3). sum is 12. s_max is 3. \n\n3\u00b2 is 9 \u226412. \n\nYes. \n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is k = n/2. \n\nWait, but then why does the code for the odd case output (n/2 +1)? \n\nBecause for odd n, the sum is (k+1)^2, where k = (n-1)/2. \n\nSo (k+1) is (n+1)/2. \n\nSo the maximum s is (k+1) \u2192 which is exactly (n+1)/2. \n\nWait, for n=5, (5+1)/2 =3 \u2192 correct. \n\nFor n=3, (3+1)/2=2 \u2192 correct. \n\nSo for odd n, the maximum s is (n+1)/2. \n\nWhich is exactly what the code is outputting. \n\nWait, the code for the else (odd) case is System.out.println(n/2 +1). \n\nWait, n is odd, so n/2 is integer division, which truncates. \n\nFor example, n=5 \u21925/2=2 \u2192 2+1=3. \n\nn=3 \u21923/2=1 \u21921+1=2. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nSo for even n, the maximum s is k =n/2. \n\nSo in the code's if block (when n is even), we can just output n/2. \n\nWait, but let me check with n=6 (even). \n\nn=6 \u2192k=3 \u2192 output 3. \n\nWhich is correct, since sum is 12 \u2192 sqrt(12)=3.464 \u2192 floor is 3. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: n=2 \u2192 output 1. Correct. \n\nSo the code for even n is simply to print n/2. \n\nWait, but why is the code's else part (for odd) outputting n/2 +1, which is exactly (k+1) where k is (n-1)/2. \n\nSo for even n, the code should output n/2. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the if block (when n is even) is System.out.println(n/2); \n\nWait, but let me check with n=4. \n\nn=4 \u2192 even, output 4/2=2. The sum is 6, so s_max is 2. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code for the even case is straightforward. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is simply:\n\nSystem.out.println(n/2);\n\nSo the code inside the if(n%2==0) block should be that line. \n\nTherefore, the completed code would have in the if block that line. \n\nSo the user's code currently has the else block correct, and the if block needs to output n/2. \n\nThus, the missing code is \"System.out.println(n/2);\"."
