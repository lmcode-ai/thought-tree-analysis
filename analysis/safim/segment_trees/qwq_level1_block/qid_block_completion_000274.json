The variables fix and brk are arrays of size 8, which might be related to some state transitions. The DP array is of size 64, which probably represents different states based on the bits processed so far. The loop over each bit in the input string suggests that the DP is being updated bit by bit. The main part missing is the inner loop over 'rew' in the triple nested loops. Let me think about what each variable represents here. The outer loops are over 't' and 'l', which might be tracking some state. The 'rew' loop is probably iterating over possible next states or transitions.

For example, x XOR y = (a^b) XOR (b^c) = a^c = z. So, z is the XOR of x and y. Similarly, x XOR z = y, and y XOR z = x. So, the three variables are related through XOR. This suggests that the three variables are not independent. For instance, once two are chosen, the third is determined. So, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of two variables, and the third is derived. Let me think of variables x and y. Then z = x XOR y.

The conditions are x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x.

The loops over t and l (each up to 7) suggest that the state is represented by two 3-bit numbers. The variables fix and brk are arrays of size 8. The code's loops are over t and l (each 0-7), and then rew (0-7). Perhaps the 't' and 'l' are masks representing some state parameters. The 'rew' is the next state's contribution. The code's initial DP is set to dp[0] = 1. The loops for each bit process the current bit and update the DP array. The condition if (!bit && (t & l) ! = t) continue; suggests that when the current bit is 0, only transitions where (t & l) equals t are allowed.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the missing code in this C++ program. The problem is about counting the number of triples (a, b, c) such that the XORs of their pairs form the sides of a non-degenerate triangle. The input is a very large binary number, so we have to process it digit by digit.\n\nLooking at the code structure, it seems like a dynamic programming approach is being used. The variables fix and brk are arrays of size 8, which might be related to some state transitions. The DP array is of size 64, which probably represents different states based on the bits processed so far. The loop over each bit in the input string suggests that the DP is being updated bit by bit.\n\nThe main part missing is the inner loop over 'rew' in the triple nested loops. Let me think about what each variable represents here. The outer loops are over 't' and 'l', which might be tracking some state. The 'rew' loop is probably iterating over possible next states or transitions.\n\nWait, the problem requires that a XOR b, b XOR c, and a XOR c form a valid triangle. Let me recall that for three numbers x, y, z to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two must be greater than the third. Also, note that a XOR b, b XOR c, and a XOR c can be related to the pairwise differences. Alternatively, since XOR is involved, maybe there's a way to express these terms in terms of a, b, c.\n\nWait, actually, a XOR b, b XOR c, and a XOR c can be simplified. Let me see: Let me note that a XOR b XOR c XOR c = a XOR b, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, the three XOR terms can be written as (a^b), (b^c), (a^c). Let me see that (a^b) XOR (b^c) = a^c, so they are related. Hmm, perhaps there's a relationship between the three terms. Alternatively, maybe the three terms must satisfy the triangle inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the three XOR terms must satisfy the triangle conditions. Let me think of the three terms as x, y, z. The conditions are x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x. Since all are positive, the sum of any two must be greater than the third. The minimal condition is that the sum of the two smaller ones must be greater than the largest. So, the maximum of the three must be less than the sum of the other two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to model this. Let me think of the problem in terms of the variables a, b, c. Since XOR is involved, maybe there's a way to express the conditions in terms of the bits of a, b, c. But given the problem's constraints, especially with n being up to 2^200000, we need an O(number of bits) solution, which suggests that the DP approach here is the way to go.\n\nLooking back at the code, the DP array is of size 64, which is 2^6, so maybe each state is a combination of some bits. The fix and brk arrays have 8 elements each, which is 2^3, so perhaps each state is tracking three bits. The loops over t and l (each up to 8) might be part of the state transitions.\n\nThe code's structure is processing each bit of the binary string from left to right. For each bit, it's considering possible transitions based on the current bit and the previous state. The variables 't' and 'l' might represent some state parameters. The 'rew' loop is probably iterating over possible next states or transitions.\n\nWait, the code has a loop over 't' and 'l' from 0 to 7 (since 8 elements). The condition if (!bit && (t & l) != t) continue; suggests that when the current bit is 0, some transitions are not allowed. The 't' and 'l' might be masks representing some state bits. The 'rew' loop is inside, so perhaps 'rew' is the next state's contribution?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 't' and 'l' are part of the state transitions. Let me think of the DP state as tracking some information about the current bits of a, b, c. Since XOR is involved, perhaps the state tracks the XOR bits between a, b, and c up to the current bit. But since the problem requires the three XOR terms to form a triangle, maybe the state needs to track some information about the bits of these XOR terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP is tracking the possible combinations of the bits of a, b, c up to the current position, such that the constraints are maintained. Since the problem is about the XORs forming a triangle, maybe the DP state needs to track the bits of the three XOR terms (x, y, z) up to the current bit, but that might be too much. Alternatively, maybe the state tracks some properties that can help determine whether the triangle condition is satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed. Let me note that a XOR b, b XOR c, and a XOR c can be written as x, y, z. Also, note that x XOR y = (a^b) XOR (b^c) = a^c = z. So, the three variables x, y, z must satisfy x XOR y = z, x XOR z = y, and y XOR z = x. So they form a system where each is the XOR of the other two. This implies that exactly one of them is the sum of the other two in terms of bits, but perhaps this relationship can be used to simplify the problem.\n\nWait, but the triangle condition requires that the sum of any two is greater than the third. Since XOR is bitwise, perhaps the bits of the numbers play a role here. Let me think of the maximum of the three numbers. Suppose the maximum is x. Then the condition is x < y + z. But since x = y XOR z, perhaps there's a way to relate this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle condition can be rephrased in terms of the bits of the three numbers. For example, if the maximum of the three has a leading bit at position k, then the other two must have bits set such that their sum exceeds that. But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key insight is that the three XOR terms must satisfy that none of them is greater than the sum of the other two. Let me think of the three numbers x, y, z. The triangle condition is equivalent to x + y > z, x + z > y, and y + z > x. The first two inequalities can be rewritten as x + y > z and x + z > y, which simplifies to x > |y - z|. Similarly for the others. But perhaps the most restrictive condition is that the sum of the two smaller numbers must be greater than the largest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by noting that the three XOR terms must satisfy that the sum of any two is greater than the third. Let me think of the three terms as x, y, z. The sum x + y must be greater than z, etc. But since x, y, z are all non-negative integers, perhaps the key is that the maximum of the three must be less than the sum of the other two.\n\nHmm, but how does this help in counting the triples (a, b, c)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical way to express the count. Let me note that a XOR b, b XOR c, and a XOR c can be written as (a^b), (b^c), (a^c). Let me note that (a^b) + (b^c) + (a^c) = 2*(a + b + c) - 2*(a&b + b&c + a&c) + ... Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of variables a, b, c. Let me note that a, b, c can be any numbers between 0 and n. The total number of triples is (n+1)^3. The problem wants the number of triples where the three XORs form a valid triangle. So the answer is total triples minus the number of triples where the three XORs do not form a valid triangle.\n\nBut calculating the invalid cases might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the valid cases using some combinatorial approach with DP.\n\nLooking back at the code provided, the DP array is of size 64, which is 2^6. The loops over t and l (each up to 8) suggest that the state is represented by some combination of bits. The variables fix and brk are arrays of size 8, which might be used to track some transitions.\n\nThe code's outer loop is over each bit of the input string. For each bit, it's processing transitions from the current DP state to the next. The 'bit' variable is the current bit (0 or 1) of the input number. The loops over t and l (each from 0 to 7) might be iterating over possible previous states or masks. The condition if (!bit && (t & l) != t) continue; suggests that when the current bit is 0, some transitions are not allowed. The 't & l' part might be checking some condition related to the previous state and the current bit.\n\nThe inner loop over 'rew' is where the missing code is. The 'rew' variable is from 0 to 7, so perhaps it's iterating over possible next states. The code inside the loop probably updates the next DP state based on the current state and the current bit.\n\nThe fix and brk arrays are named, so maybe 'fix' represents some fixed contribution and 'brk' a broken or invalid contribution. The code might be tracking some parameters like the number of valid transitions or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP state tracks the current bits of a, b, c in some way. Since XOR is involved, maybe the state tracks the XOR of a, b, and c up to the current bit. But with three variables, that's 3 bits, but the DP size is 64, so maybe more.\n\nAlternatively, the DP state could be tracking the bits of the three XOR terms (x, y, z) up to the current position. Since each term is a XOR of two variables, their bits depend on the bits of a, b, c. But tracking all three bits for each position would be too much. Alternatively, maybe the state tracks some properties of the bits that are necessary for the triangle condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by noting that the three XOR terms must satisfy that the sum of any two is greater than the third. Let me think of the three terms as x, y, z. The triangle condition requires that x + y > z, x + z > y, and y + z > x. Adding all three inequalities gives x + y + z > x + y + z, which is always true, so the conditions are equivalent to each of the three inequalities holding. The most restrictive is that the sum of the two smaller terms must be greater than the largest.\n\nSuppose that the maximum of x, y, z is M. Then the condition is that the sum of the other two must be > M. Since M is the maximum, the sum of the other two must be greater than M. Let me note that the sum of the other two is (sum of all three) - M. So the condition becomes (sum - M) > M \u2192 sum > 2M. But sum = x + y + z. So sum > 2M \u2192 x + y + z > 2M. Since M is the maximum, this is equivalent to the sum of the other two terms being greater than M.\n\nHmm, but how does this help in counting?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that for the three numbers to form a triangle, none of them can be greater than or equal to the sum of the other two. So, for all three, the condition must hold. So, for each of the three terms, it must be less than the sum of the other two.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by considering that the three XOR terms must satisfy that the sum of any two is greater than the third. Let me think of the three terms as x, y, z. The conditions are x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x. Let me note that these can be rewritten as z < x + y, y < x + z, x < y + z. \n\nNow, considering that x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. Let me see if there's a relationship between these variables. For example, x XOR y = (a^b) XOR (b^c) = a^c = z. So, z is the XOR of x and y. Similarly, x XOR z = y, and y XOR z = x. So, the three variables are related through XOR. \n\nThis suggests that the three variables are not independent. For instance, once two are chosen, the third is determined. So, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of two variables, and the third is derived. \n\nLet me think of variables x and y. Then z = x XOR y. The conditions become:\n\nx + y > z \u2192 x + y > (x XOR y)\n\nx + z > y \u2192 x + (x XOR y) > y\n\ny + z > x \u2192 y + (x XOR y) > x\n\nHmm, perhaps these inequalities can be simplified. Let me see:\n\nFirst inequality: x + y > x XOR y. Let me note that x + y = (x XOR y) + 2*(x AND y). So, substituting, the first inequality becomes (x XOR y) + 2*(x AND y) > x XOR y \u2192 2*(x AND y) > 0 \u2192 x AND y > 0. So the first condition is equivalent to x and y having at least one bit in common.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\nx + y = (x XOR y) + 2*(x & y). So, x + y > (x XOR y) \u2192 2*(x & y) > 0 \u2192 x & y != 0. So the first condition is that x and y share at least one set bit.\n\nSimilarly, the second condition: x + z > y \u2192 x + (x XOR y) > y. Let's substitute z = x XOR y:\n\nx + (x XOR y) > y \u2192 (x + (x XOR y)) - y > 0. Let me compute x + (x XOR y) - y.\n\nLet me note that x XOR y = (x | y) - (x & y). So substituting:\n\nx + (x | y - x & y) - y = x + x | y - x & y - y \n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, let's see:\n\nx + (x XOR y) = x + (x ^ y) = (x | y) + (x & y) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, x + y = (x XOR y) + 2*(x & y). So x + (x XOR y) = x + (x + y - 2*(x & y)) \u2192 which is 2x + y - 2*(x & y). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second condition can be rewritten as x + z > y \u2192 x + (x XOR y) > y \u2192 (x XOR y) > y - x. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all three conditions can be simplified to x & y != 0, x & z !=0, and y & z !=0. Because if any two variables have no common set bits, then their sum would be equal to their XOR, so the sum would not exceed the third variable. \n\nWait, let's see: Suppose x and y have no common set bits. Then x & y =0, so x + y = x XOR y. So the first condition x + y > z (which is x XOR y) would require x XOR y > x XOR y \u2192 which is false. So the first condition would fail. So, the first condition requires that x and y share at least one set bit. Similarly, the second condition requires that x and z share a bit, and the third that y and z share a bit. \n\nWait, let me check the second condition: x + z > y. Since z = x XOR y, substituting gives x + (x XOR y) > y. Let me see when this holds. Let me suppose that x and y have some overlapping bits. Let me take an example. Let x = 3 (11), y = 1 (01). Then z = 2 (10). Then x + z = 5, which is greater than y (1). So that's okay. \n\nAnother example: x = 2 (10), y = 1 (01). Then z = 3 (11). x + z = 5 > y (1). \n\nBut if x and z have no common bits? Let's see: x = 2 (10), z = 1 (01). Then x + z = 3. Suppose y is 3 (11). Then the condition x + z > y would be 3 > 3 \u2192 no. So in that case, the condition would fail. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the conditions are equivalent to all three pairs (x,y), (x,z), (y,z) must have a non-zero bitwise AND. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose x and y have a common bit. Then x & y !=0. \n\nSimilarly, x and z must have a common bit. Since z = x XOR y, then x & z = x & (x XOR y). Let me see: \n\nx & (x XOR y) = x & (~y) (since XOR is 1 where bits differ). Wait, no. Let me think in terms of bits. For each bit, if x has a 1 and y has a 0, then x XOR y has a 1, so x & (x XOR y) will have that bit set. If x has a 1 and y has a 1, then x XOR y has 0, so that bit is 0. So x & (x XOR y) is the bits where x has 1 and y has 0. \n\nSimilarly, y & z = y & (x XOR y) \u2192 which is the bits where y has 1 and x has 0. \n\nSo, for x & z to be non-zero, there must be at least one bit where x has 1 and y has 0. Similarly, for y & z to be non-zero, there must be at least one bit where y has 1 and x has 0. \n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. x & y !=0 \u2192 there is at least one bit where both x and y have 1.\n\n2. x & z !=0 \u2192 there is at least one bit where x has 1 and y has 0 (since z is x XOR y).\n\n3. y & z !=0 \u2192 there is at least one bit where y has 1 and x has 0.\n\nSo combining all three conditions, the three variables must have overlapping bits in such a way that:\n\n- There exists a bit where both x and y are 1 (so x & y has that bit).\n\n- There exists a bit where x is 1 and y is 0 (so x & z has that bit).\n\n- There exists a bit where y is 1 and x is 0 (so y & z has that bit).\n\nThis implies that x and y must have at least one overlapping bit (condition 1), and also, they must have bits where one has a 1 and the other has 0 (conditions 2 and 3). \n\nWait, but if x and y have overlapping bits, then conditions 2 and 3 require that there are also bits where they differ. So overall, the three conditions together require that x and y have both overlapping bits and differing bits. \n\nAlternatively, the three conditions together imply that x and y are not subsets of each other. Because if x is a subset of y (all bits set in x are also set in y), then z = x XOR y would be y - x. Then, x & z would be x & (y -x) \u2192 but since x is a subset of y, y -x has bits where y has 1 and x has 0. So x & (y -x) would be 0. So condition 2 would fail. Similarly, if y is a subset of x, condition 3 would fail. \n\nSo the conditions require that neither x is a subset of y nor y is a subset of x, and they share at least one common bit. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps this is the key to formulating the problem in terms of the bits of a, b, c. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of the variables a, b, c. Let me note that the three XOR terms are x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. \n\nWe can express a, b, c in terms of x, y, z. For example, adding x and y gives a^b + b^c = a^c (since x XOR y = z). Not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed by noting that a, b, c can be expressed in terms of two variables. For example, let me set a as a base, then b and c can be expressed as a XOR x and a XOR y, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires that the three XOR terms form a valid triangle, perhaps the count can be expressed in terms of the total number of triples minus those that don't satisfy the conditions. But calculating the invalid cases might be easier. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the three XOR terms satisfy the triangle conditions. Let me think of the three terms as x, y, z. The conditions are x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x. \n\nBut since x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c, perhaps there's a way to express these conditions in terms of a, b, c. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the three terms must satisfy that none of them is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two. \n\nWait, but how can we model this in a DP approach? The given code seems to be using a DP with states that track some information about the bits processed so far. \n\nLooking back at the code's variables:\n\nThe DP array is of size 64, which is 2^6. The loops over t and l (each up to 7) suggest that the state is represented by two 3-bit numbers (t and l?), but I'm not sure. \n\nThe fix and brk arrays are of size 8 (so 3 bits). The code's comments mention \"TODO: Your code here\" inside a loop over rew from 0 to 7. \n\nPerhaps the DP state is tracking some parameters related to the current bits of a, b, c. For example, the state could track the current bits of a, b, c in some way. Since XOR is involved, maybe the state tracks the XOR of pairs up to the current bit. \n\nAlternatively, the DP might be tracking the bits of the three XOR terms (x, y, z) up to the current bit. Since each term is a XOR of two variables, their bits depend on the bits of a, b, c. \n\nAlternatively, the DP state could be tracking the current bits of a, b, c in such a way that allows us to compute the required conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be approached by noting that the three XOR terms must satisfy the triangle conditions, which can be rephrased as the maximum of the three terms must be less than the sum of the other two. \n\nSuppose the maximum term is M. Then the sum of the other two must be > M. Since M is the maximum, the sum of the other two is (sum of all three) - M. So the condition becomes (sum) > 2*M. \n\nBut the sum of all three terms is x + y + z. Since x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c, their sum can be expressed in terms of a, b, c. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to find the number of triples (a, b, c) where the three XOR terms do not form a degenerate triangle, and then compute this using DP. \n\nThe given code's structure suggests that the DP is being built bit by bit, processing each bit of the binary number n. The DP array's size is 64, which is 2^6, so perhaps the state is a 6-bit number. \n\nThe loops over t and l (each up to 7) might be iterating over possible previous states. The 'rew' loop is probably iterating over possible next states. \n\nThe variables fix and brk are arrays of size 8, which might be used to adjust the DP transitions based on the current bit. \n\nThe code's final answer is computed by summing dp[i +56] for i from 0 to 7, then multiplying by 3 mod MOD. \n\nHmm, perhaps the DP state tracks some information about the current bits of a, b, c. For example, the state could track the current bits of a, b, c in such a way that allows us to compute the required conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the DP might track the bits of the three XOR terms (x, y, z) up to the current bit. Since each term is a XOR of two variables, their bits depend on the bits of a, b, c. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into counting the number of triples (a, b, c) where the three XOR terms do not have any of them being the sum of the other two. \n\nWait, but how does this help in the DP approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by noting that the three XOR terms must satisfy that none of them is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two. \n\nLet me think of the three terms as x, y, z. The conditions are x + y > z, x + z > y, y + z > x. \n\nSuppose that the maximum of the three is M. Then the condition reduces to M < (sum of the other two). Since the sum of the other two is (sum of all three) - M, this implies that sum > 2*M. \n\nSo, the maximum term must be less than half of the total sum. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum term must be less than the sum of the other two. \n\nHmm, but how to model this in a DP?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the bits of the numbers from the most significant to least. For each bit position, we can track certain parameters that allow us to compute the valid counts. \n\nThe given code's DP array is of size 64, which is 2^6. The loops over t and l (each up to 7) suggest that the state is represented by two 3-bit numbers. \n\nThe variables fix and brk are arrays of size 8. The code's loops are over t and l (each 0-7), and then rew (0-7). \n\nPerhaps the 't' and 'l' are masks representing some state parameters. The 'rew' is the next state's contribution. \n\nThe code's initial DP is set to dp[0] = 1. \n\nThe loops for each bit process the current bit and update the DP array. \n\nThe condition if (!bit && (t & l) != t) continue; suggests that when the current bit is 0, only transitions where (t & l) equals t are allowed. \n\nHmm, perhaps 't' and 'l' are masks that track some bits of the current state. \n\nAlternatively, the 't' and 'l' could represent the current bits of a, b, c. For example, each of a, b, c has a bit at the current position, so three bits. But since the loops are up to 7 (3 bits), perhaps 't' and 'l' are each 3-bit masks. \n\nAlternatively, the state could be tracking the bits of a, b, c up to the current position. Since each of a, b, c can be up to n, which is given in binary, the DP must track whether the current a, b, c are less than or equal to n up to the current bit. \n\nThis is similar to digit DP problems where we track tight constraints. \n\nPerhaps the DP state includes information about whether the current a, b, c are already less than the corresponding bits of n, allowing more flexibility in the next bits. \n\nThe variables fix and brk might be used to adjust the transitions based on the current bit and the state. \n\nThe code's final answer is computed by summing dp[i +56] for i from 0 to 7. Since 56 is 7*8, perhaps the DP state is stored in a way that the valid states are in the higher indices. \n\nAlternatively, the DP array's indices might represent different states, and the final answer is the sum of certain states. \n\nThe problem requires that the three XOR terms form a non-degenerate triangle. To model this, the DP must track whether the current partial bits of the XOR terms satisfy the triangle conditions up to that bit. \n\nAlternatively, the DP state could track the current bits of the three XOR terms (x, y, z) and whether they satisfy the triangle conditions so far. \n\nBut with three terms each having a bit, that's 3 bits per term, so 9 bits, which is more than 64. So that's not feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to note that the three XOR terms must have certain properties. For example, the maximum of the three must be less than the sum of the other two. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into counting the number of triples (a, b, c) where the three XOR terms do not have any of them being the sum of the other two. \n\nWait, but the triangle condition requires that the sum of any two is greater than the third. So, if any of the terms is equal to the sum of the other two, then it's degenerate. \n\nWait, if x + y = z, then the triangle is degenerate. So the condition requires that x + y > z, etc. \n\nSo, the problem is to count all triples where none of the three terms is equal to or greater than the sum of the other two. \n\nHmm, but how to model this in DP?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased in terms of the variables a, b, c. Let me note that the three XOR terms are x = a^b, y = b^c, z = a^c. \n\nThe sum of any two of these terms must be greater than the third. \n\nLet me see if there's a relationship between a, b, c that ensures this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by noting that the three terms must satisfy that the sum of any two is greater than the third. \n\nLet me consider the three terms x, y, z. \n\nThe conditions are:\n\nx + y > z,\n\nx + z > y,\n\ny + z > x.\n\nAdding all three inequalities gives x + y + z > x + y + z \u2192 which is always true, so the conditions are equivalent to each individual inequality. \n\nThe most restrictive condition is that the sum of the two smaller terms must be greater than the largest. \n\nSuppose that the largest term is z. Then the condition is x + y > z. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to ensuring that for the three terms, the sum of the two smaller terms is greater than the largest. \n\nNow, how can this be modeled in terms of a, b, c?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to note that the three terms must have at least two bits set in their binary representations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the bits of the numbers and ensuring that certain conditions are met at each bit position. \n\nThe given code's DP approach likely tracks some state that allows it to compute the valid counts incrementally. \n\nThe code's loops over t and l (each up to 7) and rew (up to 7) suggest that the state is represented by three bits (since 8 is 2^3). \n\nThe variables fix and brk are arrays of size 8, so each element is an integer. \n\nThe code's initial DP is set to dp[0] = 1. \n\nThe loops for each bit process the current bit and update the DP array. \n\nThe condition if (!bit && (t & l) != t) continue; suggests that when the current bit is 0, only transitions where (t & l) equals t are allowed. \n\nPerhaps 't' and 'l' are masks representing the current state's bits. \n\nThe 'rew' loop is inside, so perhaps 'rew' is the next state's contribution. \n\nThe code's final answer is computed by summing dp[i +56] for i from 0 to 7. Since 56 is 7*8, perhaps the valid states are in the higher indices. \n\nThe code's final answer is multiplied by 3 mod MOD. \n\nHmm, perhaps the DP tracks the number of valid triples where the current bits up to this point satisfy certain conditions, and the final answer is the sum of all valid states multiplied by some factor. \n\nThe problem requires that the three XOR terms form a valid triangle. The code's final answer is 3 * ans mod MOD. \n\nWait, the sample input's first case has an answer of 12, which is 3 * 4. So perhaps the DP counts the number of ordered triples where a <= b <= c or something, and then multiplied by 3! (but 12 is 3*4, not 6*2). \n\nAlternatively, the code's final answer is multiplied by 3 because of some symmetry. \n\nNow, back to the missing code. The inner loop over 'rew' is where the code is missing. The code inside the loop is supposed to update the next DP state. \n\nThe variables 't' and 'l' are iterating over 0-7, and 'rew' is also 0-7. \n\nPerhaps the 'rew' variable represents the next state, and the code is supposed to compute the contribution to the next DP state based on the current state (t, l) and the current bit. \n\nThe fix and brk arrays might be used to determine whether a transition is valid or contributes to the count. \n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor (int rew = 0; rew < 8; ++rew) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nInside this loop, perhaps the code checks if the current transition (from t and l to rew) is valid given the current bit, and then adds to the next DP state. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the contribution. For example, if the transition is valid, then the contribution is added with some factor. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be something like:\n\nif (some condition based on t, l, rew, and the current bit) {\n    ndp[rew] += dp[t] * ...;\n}\n\nBut I need to figure out what exactly the conditions are. \n\nThe variables 't' and 'l' might represent the current state's parameters. The 'rew' is the next state. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays could be used to determine whether the transition is allowed and how much to add. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to compute the next state's contribution based on the current bit and the current state (t and l). \n\nThe 'rew' loop might be iterating over possible next states, and for each, the code checks if the transition from (t, l) to rew is valid, then adds the contribution to ndp[rew]. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the contribution. For example, fix[rew] could be a multiplier, and brk[rew] could be a flag for breaking or something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to compute the next state's value based on the current bit and the current state (t and l). \n\nThe code's current structure is inside a loop over t and l, and for each, it's considering the current bit. \n\nThe condition if (!bit && (t & l) != t) continue; suggests that when the current bit is 0, the transition is only allowed if (t & l) equals t. \n\nThis might be ensuring that the current state's bits do not exceed the current bit of n. \n\nPerhaps 't' and 'l' are masks representing the current state's bits of a, b, c. \n\nAlternatively, the 't' and 'l' could be masks for the current bits of a and b, and the current bit being processed. \n\nAlternatively, the 't' and 'l' could represent the current state's parameters related to the bits of the three XOR terms. \n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Let me think of the problem differently. \n\nThe problem requires that the three XOR terms form a valid triangle. The code's DP is likely tracking the necessary conditions for this. \n\nThe variables fix and brk are arrays of size 8. The names suggest that 'fix' might be a multiplier for valid transitions, and 'brk' for invalid ones. \n\nThe code's loops are over t and l (each 0-7), and for each, it checks if the current bit allows the transition. \n\nThe missing code inside the rew loop must update the next DP state based on the current state (t and l), the current bit, and the rew value. \n\nPerhaps the code is supposed to compute the next state's index as rew, and then add to ndp[rew] the product of dp[t] and some factor based on fix or brk. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be something like:\n\nndp[rew] = (ndp[rew] + dp[t] * (fix[rew] + brk[rew])) % MOD;\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the 'fix' and 'brk' arrays to determine whether the transition is valid and how much to add. \n\nAlternatively, the 'rew' could be the next state, and the code is supposed to compute the contribution based on the current bit and the current state (t and l). \n\nPerhaps the code is supposed to do something like:\n\nif (some condition based on t, l, rew, and the current bit) {\n    ndp[rew] = (ndp[rew] + dp[t] * ... ) % MOD;\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure what the condition is. \n\nAlternatively, the 'rew' could be the next state's value, and the code is supposed to compute the contribution based on the current state (t and l) and the current bit. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the contribution. For example, if the transition is valid, then add fix[rew], else add brk[rew]. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be:\n\nndp[rew] = (ndp[rew] + dp[t] * ( (bit ? fix[rew] : brk[rew]) )) % MOD;\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the 'rew' could be the next state's value, and the code is supposed to compute the contribution based on the current state (t and l) and the current bit. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the multiplier for the current transition. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be:\n\nif (some condition) {\n    ndp[rew] += dp[t] * (bit ? fix[rew] : brk[rew]);\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure what the condition is. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'rew' is the next state, and the code is supposed to compute the next state based on the current state (t and l) and the current bit. \n\nThe 't' and 'l' might represent the current state's parameters, and 'rew' is the next state. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the contribution based on whether the current bit is set or not. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be:\n\nndp[rew] = (ndp[rew] + dp[t] * ( (bit ? fix[rew] : brk[rew]) )) % MOD;\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'rew' is the next state's value, and the code is supposed to compute the contribution based on the current state (t and l) and the current bit. \n\nThe 't' and 'l' might be the current state's parameters, and the 'rew' is the next state. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the multiplier for the transition. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be:\n\nif ( (t & l) == rew ) {\n    // some condition\n    ndp[rew] += dp[t];\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'rew' is the next state's value, and the code is supposed to compute the next state based on the current state (t and l) and the current bit. \n\nThe 't' and 'l' might represent the current state's parameters, and the 'rew' is the next state. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the contribution based on whether the current bit is set or not. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be:\n\nif ( (t & l) == rew ) {\n    // some condition based on bit\n    ndp[rew] = (ndp[rew] + dp[t] * (bit ? 1 : 0)) % MOD;\n}\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nThis is getting quite stuck. Maybe I should look for patterns in the given code's variables. \n\nThe code has:\n\nvector<int> fix = {0, 2, 4, 1, 1, 4, 2, 0}, brk = {0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0};\n\nThese arrays have 8 elements each. \n\nLooking at the fix array: \n\nIndices 0-7: 0,2,4,1,1,4,2,0 \n\nbrk: 0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0 \n\nPerhaps these arrays are used to determine the contribution based on the current state and the bit. \n\nThe code's loops are over t and l (each 0-7), and then rew (0-7). \n\nThe condition if (!bit && (t & l) != t) continue; suggests that when the current bit is 0, the transition is only allowed if (t & l) equals t. \n\nThe 't' and 'l' might be masks representing the current state's parameters. \n\nPerhaps the 'rew' is the next state, and the code is supposed to compute the contribution based on the current state (t and l) and the current bit. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the multiplier for the transition. \n\nFor example, when the current bit is set (bit is 1), the contribution is multiplied by fix[rew], and when it's not set (bit is 0), multiplied by brk[rew]. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be:\n\nndp[rew] = (ndp[rew] + dp[t] * (bit ? fix[rew] : brk[rew])) % MOD;\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the 'rew' could be the next state's value, and the code is supposed to compute the next state based on the current state (t and l) and the current bit. \n\nThe 't' and 'l' might be the current state's parameters, and the 'rew' is the next state. \n\nThe 'fix' and 'brk' arrays might be used to determine the multiplier for the transition. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be:\n\nif ( (t & l) == rew ) {\n    // some condition based on bit\n    ndp[rew] = (ndp[rew] + dp[t] * (bit ?
