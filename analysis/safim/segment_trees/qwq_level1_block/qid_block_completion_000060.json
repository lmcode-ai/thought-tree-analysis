But that might not be possible unless the end has a portal. Ah, right! Megan's end is (1,m). So Megan will have a portal there at the end. But that depends on her path. Wait Megan's path must go from (n,1) to (1,m). So she must pass through (1,m) as her destination, so that cell has a portal. So if Stanley can reach a portal before Megan reaches her end, he can teleport to (1,m), but that may not be helpful for his path. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me think of some examples. Take the first test case example given in the note. The example says n=7, m=5? Because Megan moves to (7,3). Wait the note says Megan moves to (7,3) then to (1,3). The example's final answer is 15. Let me see what the code currently does. The original code in the problem has:\n\nres = m + n; then if n>m, ... else, res += n+1. Then if n==0 and m==0 set to 0. Wait let's see for n=7, m=5:\n\nn is 7, m is5. Original code first does n--; m--; so n becomes 6 and m 4. res = 6 +4 =10. Then since n>m (6>4), the code would enter the if(n>m) block. But the current code's if(n>m) block is commented as \"TODO\". So the code as given would proceed to the else part? Wait no, the code's structure is:\n\nif(n>m) { /* TODO */ }\n\nelse { res +=n+1 }\n\nWait in this case n=6>4, so it's in the first block. But since the code there is empty, it just does the 'res +=n+1'? No, the else is only for when n<=m. Wait no, the code is: \n\nAfter setting res = m +n (which after the decrement is 6+4=10), then:\n\nif (n >m) { /* todo */ }\n\nelse: res += n+1. So in the example of n=7, m=5 (after decrement, 6 and4) the if condition is true (6>4). So the code would enter the first block, but there is no code there. Thus, the res would remain as 10, then after adding the check for n==0 and m==0, it would print 10. But the correct answer is 15, so the code is not handling that correctly. Wait no, the correct answer in the note is 15, but according to the sample input, perhaps the first test case is n=7, m=5? Then the code as given produces 10? Which is wrong. So the code is incorrect, and the missing part is in the 'if (n>m)' block. Hmm, so the problem requires figuring out what code to put in that if(n>m) block to compute the correct res. Looking at the current code:\n\nThe code starts with n and m, then does n--; m--;. So perhaps they are 1-based to 0-based indices? Wait the problem states that the coordinates are 1-based. The code subtracts 1 from each? Maybe that's to make them 0-based for easier calculations. The initial res is m +n after the decrement. So for the first test case, 6+4=10. Then the else block adds n+1 (when n <=m). But in the note, the correct answer is 15. So in the case of n=7 and m=5, the code would have entered the 'if (n>m) block (since 6>4), so the code inside the if block must do something else to reach 15? Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is that when n and m are given, the minimal total is (n+m-1)*2 - (something).",

Subtract something to get 15. So 22 -7=15. So 7? Not sure. Alternatively, in the note's example, the correct answer is 15. Let me see what the code currently would give.

But this is S_total + M_total + 2, which again is the same as the original without savings, so that approach must be wrong. Wait perhaps the key is that when you use a portal, you can teleport to any other portal, not just one. So maybe they can teleport multiple times? Wait the problem says they can use the portal at any cell with a portal. So for example, Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So once Megan has visited a cell, any time after that (in their paths) they can use that portal.",

So the optimal path may involve multiple teleports, but the minimal path would probably use just one teleport each. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the minimal total is (n + m) * 2 - (something). Wait in the sample case, 7+5 is 12, 12*2 is 24. 24-9=15 \u2192 24-9=15. So 9 is the subtraction. What is 9? 7+2 \u2192 not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m -1) *2 - (min(n,m)*2). Let's see:\n\nFor the sample: (7+5-1)*2 - (5*2)= 11*2-10=22-10=12 \u2192 no. Hmm. Perhaps I should look for a pattern in the formula. The code given in the problem is:\n\nAfter n-- and m--:\n\nres = m +n (so (n+m after decrement)) Then, if n>m, do something, else add (n+1) to res. In the sample case (n=7 \u21926, m=5 \u21924), the else is not taken, so the code would do the if block's code. So what should be in there? Suppose that when n>m (after decrement, so original n was bigger than original m?), then the code should do something like res += m +1? Wait let's see:\n\nSample case: After decrement, n=6, m=4. If the code adds m +1 (4+1=5), then total res would be 10 +5 =15 which matches the sample answer. So perhaps the code inside the if (n>m) block should be res += m +1; Then in the else part (when n <= m), add n+1. Ah, that makes sense. So:\n\nThe formula is:\n\nres = (n + m (after decrement)) + (if n>m: m+1 else: n+1). Wait let's see:\n\nOriginal code's initial res is (n' + m'), where n' = original n-1, m' = original m-1. Then, if (n' > m') \u2192 then res += m' +1. Else res += n' +1. Wait let's see for the sample case:\n\nn' =6, m'=4. 6>4 \u2192 so res +=4+1 =5 \u2192 total res =10+5=15. Correct. Another test case where n=1, m=1.\n\nOriginal n=1, m=1 \u2192 after decrement 0 and 0 \u2192 n' and m' are 0. The if (n>m) is 0>0 \u2192 false. Enter else, add 0+1 \u2192 1 \u2192 but then code checks if n==0 and m==0 (they are 0 here), so set to 0. So correct. Another test case where n=1, m=2. Original n=1, m=2 \u2192 n'=0, m'=1. Since n' <= m', so add 0+1=1 \u2192 res = 0+1 (original res =0+1=1, then adding 0+1 gives 2? Wait initial res is m' +n' =0+1=1. Then add n' +1 (0+1=1 \u2192 total 2). But what is the correct answer here? Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to reach (1,2). So he can just move right once \u2192 1 energy.",

So the initial assumption may be incorrect. Wait what's the correct answer here? Wait let's compute the minimal total energy:\n\nThey can choose their paths to minimize their total. Alternative path for Megan: she goes directly from (2,1) to (1,2) in 2 steps. Stanley can go from (1,1) to (2,2) via any path. Let's see:\n\nIf Stanley takes his own path without using portals: 2 steps. Total 2+2=4. Which is better than the other path which gives 5. Ah, right! So the minimal total is 4. Because the portals are only useful if using them gives a shorter path. In that case, the formula's output of 4 is correct. Ah okay, so the formula is correct in that case. In the scenario where they don't use portals, the total is better. So the formula is correct. Thus, the formula proposed earlier seems to work. Let me think of the formula:\n\nres = (n' + m') + (if n' > m' then m'+1 else n' +1 )\n\nwhere n' = original n-1, m'=original m-1. Wait let me rephrase this: The formula is ( (n-1) + (m-1) ) + ( (min(n-1, m-1) +1) ) Because when n-1 > m-1 \u2192 then m-1 +1 = m.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nThe first term is (n-1 + m-1). The second term is if n>m then m else n.\n\nWait:\n\nn' = n-1 \n\nm' = m-1 \n\nif n' > m', then add (m' +1) \u2192 m.\n\nElse add (n' +1) \u2192n. Thus the total res would be (n-1 + m-1) + (min(n,m)). Wait simplifying:\n\nres = (n+m-2) + min(n, m) \n\nWait let me see:\n\nFor the sample case (n=7, m=5): \n\n7+5-2 =10, plus 5 \u2192 15, which matches. For the case n=2, m=2 \u2192 2+2-2 =2, plus min(2,2)=2 \u2192 total 4.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=2:\n\nn'=0, m'=1 \u2192 n' <= m', so add n' +1 =1. Total res is (0+1) +1 \u2192 2. Which is correct. Another test case: n=3, m=2 \u2192 original n=3, m=2 \u2192 n'=2, m'=1. Since 2>1 \u2192 add m' +1 (1+1=2). res is (2+1)=3 + 2 \u21925. Let's compute manually:\n\nMegan's path is from (3,1) \u2192 (1,2).",

So adding m is correct. Similarly when n <=m, then the min is original n, so add n. Thus the formula works. So, in the code's if block (if n>m):\n\nWe must add (m+1). Because m was decremented, so m+1 gives the original m.\n\nWait the code currently has:\n\nres = m +n; \n\nThen:\n\nif(n>m) { /* add m+1 here */ } \n\nelse { res +=n+1; }\n\nWait, no: the else part adds n+1 (which is original n). Yes, exactly. So inside the if(n>m) block, we need to add (m+1). So the code should be:\n\nif(n>m) \n\n    res += m +1;\n\nelse \n\n    res +=n+1;\n\nThus, the missing code is res += m+1;\n\nAdditionally, the code has a check for if(n==0 && m==0) \u2192 set res=0. Which handles the case where n and m are 1 (since after decrement they become 0). So putting it all together, the code's missing part is 'res += m +1;'. Therefore, the correct code for the if block is:\n\nif(n>m)\n\n    res += (m+1);\n\nElse part is already handled. So the missing code is:\n\nres += m+1;\n\nHence, the answer is to put that in the if block.",

But she can choose any path, so perhaps the best (x,y) is the point that gives the minimal sum. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal (x,y) is the point where the total of the four terms is minimized. Let me compute the four terms:\n\nLet's denote the coordinates as (x,y). Stanley's distance to (x,y) is (x-1) + (y-1). Then, from there to (n,m): (n -x) + (m - y). So Stanley's contribution without teleport would be (x-1 + y-1) + (n-x + m -y) = (x-1 + y-1 + n -x + m -y) = n + m - 2, which is the same as his Manhattan distance. So the teleport adds 1 and subtracts the distance between the two parts. Wait, no, when using the portal, Stanley can teleport instead of moving from (x,y) to ... well, he can choose to teleport to another portal. Wait, maybe I need to think again.",

But to minimize the total, perhaps the best is to teleport directly from (x,y) to the destination via a portal. Wait that might not always be possible. Hmm, perhaps the best scenario is that both use the same portal to teleport. For example, they both reach a common portal point (x,y) and then teleport to each other's destination? Not sure.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. The task is to find the minimal total energy required for Stanley and Megan to reach their destinations by moving optimally, possibly using the portals Megan leaves behind. \n\nHmm, the problem description says that Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So whenever either of them is in a cell with a portal, they can teleport to any other portal for 1 energy. The key here is to find a path where they can use these portals to minimize the total energy.\n\nLet me think about their paths. Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and goes to (1,m). The portals are placed along Megan's path. So the portals are in all the cells she visits. The optimal path probably involves them using these portals to teleport at some point to save steps.\n\nThe minimal total energy would be the sum of their individual path energies, but considering the teleport options. The challenge is to find the best point where they can use the portals to minimize the total.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal total energy can be calculated by finding the optimal point where they can meet or cross paths via a portal. Let me think of the problem in terms of coordinates.\n\nLet's consider their paths. Both are moving from opposite corners. Let me think of their paths as moving towards each other. The portals are created along Megan's path, so Stanley can use any of them once Megan has been there.\n\nThe minimal energy might be when they both reach a common portal as efficiently as possible, then teleport, and proceed to their destinations. The key is to choose the best point for this teleport.\n\nLet me think of the Manhattan distances. Without portals, the total would be (n+m-2) each (since each has to go from corner to opposite corner, distance is (n-1)+(m-1) steps, but multiplied by 2 for both). But with portals, they can save some steps.\n\nWait, but the portals can be used once each for moving. Let me think of the path as:\n\nSuppose Megan creates a portal at some point (x,y). Then, both can teleport through that. The idea is to choose a point where the combined cost is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is (distance of Stanley without portal) + (distance of Megan without portal) minus the overlapping cost? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is (a + b - c), where c is the savings from the portals. But how to calculate that?\n\nHmm, let's think of the minimal possible. Let me try to consider the best possible scenario. The best case is when they can teleport once each, so they can cover large distances for 1 energy each.\n\nSuppose Megan's path allows Stanley to teleport at a point that's optimal. Let me think of the minimal total as follows:\n\nThe total energy can be broken down into the steps before using the portal, the teleport step (each using 1), then the steps after.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is (distance for Stanley to reach a portal +1 + distance from portal to destination) + (distance Megan to reach portal +1 + her remaining distance). \n\nThe problem is to choose the portal position (x,y) such that this total is minimized.\n\nBut since Megan can choose any path, we can choose the path that gives the best possible portal positions. Since Megan can choose her path, the optimal path would be to choose the path that allows the best possible savings for both.\n\nAlternatively, since Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits, the best scenario is when Megan's path is such that there's a point which is optimal for both.\n\nPerhaps the minimal total energy is (Manhattan distance from Stanley's start to end) + (Manhattan distance for Megan) minus some overlapping path where the portals allow them to save steps. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is (n + m - 1) * 2 - (some path overlap). Wait, perhaps I need to model this differently.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy would be the sum of their individual minimal paths without any portals, minus some savings from using portals. Since using a portal can save the distance between two points, but each teleport uses 1 energy. So for example, if they can teleport once each, then the saving would be (distance between the portal and their destinations) minus 1 (for the teleport). \n\nHmm, maybe the minimal total is the sum of their Manhattan distances (each has (n-1)+(m-1) steps, but that's for a single route). Wait, actually, for Stanley, the Manhattan distance from (1,1) to (n,m) is (n-1)+(m-1) steps. Similarly for Megan, from (n,1) to (1,m), same distance. So total without using portals would be 2*(n+m-2). However, using portals can reduce this.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal possible sum when using portals optimally.\n\nLet me think of an example. Let's take the first test case from the note. The answer was 15. Let's see:\n\nIn their example, n=7, m=5? Wait the note says Megan moves to (7,3) then to (1,3). Wait perhaps n is 7 and m is 5? Let me see:\n\nThe note's first test case's total is 15. Let me see their example:\n\nMegan moves to (7,3). So that's part of her path. Then she goes to (1,3). So Megan's path must have included (7,3), (1,3). \n\nStanley goes to (1,3) as well, then teleports to (7,3). \n\nThe steps for Megan:\n\nHer path is from (7,1) to (1,5). \n\nWait Megan starts at (n,1) = (7,1) and needs to reach (1,5). \n\nShe first moves to (7,3): that's moving right 2 steps (cost 2). Then to (1,3): moving up 6 steps (cost 6). Then she goes to (1,5): moving right 2 steps (cost 2). So Megan's total is 2+6+2 = 10?\n\nWait in the note, the total is 15, which comes from (2+6) for Megan's first steps, then Stanley's steps: 2 (to reach (1,3)), then teleport (1), then 2 steps to (7,5). Megan also uses 2 for her last steps. So total is 8 (Megan's first two steps) + 5 (Stanley's steps) + 2 (Megan's last step) = 15? \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that when they use portals, they can teleport between any two portals. So the portals are all the cells Megan has visited. So the first portal Megan leaves is in her starting cell (n,1), and each subsequent step adds a new portal.\n\nThe problem is to choose paths for both so that their total energy is minimized by using the portals optimally.\n\nSo the minimal total energy would be the sum of their individual minimal paths, but with some reduction by using teleport steps.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of choosing a meeting point where they can teleport. Let's say they both reach a common portal point (x,y) then teleport, but perhaps the optimal is that they use a common portal at some point. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy can be found by considering the best point where Megan's path allows both to minimize their steps.\n\nLet me think of the minimal possible path. Let's think of the steps as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote Stanley's path as S and Megan's as M.\n\nThe total energy is (S's steps) + (M's steps).\n\nBut when they can use portals, they can teleport. The key is that once Megan has placed a portal at some point, Stanley can use it. The portals are placed in every cell Megan visits along her path. So Megan's path is important in choosing where the portals are.\n\nThe optimal path would probably involve them meeting at a point where they can teleport to save distance.\n\nSuppose Megan chooses a path that allows a portal at a certain point (x,y) such that both can teleport through there.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is (distance from S's start to portal + 1 + distance from portal to S's end) + (distance from M's start to portal + 1 + distance from portal to M's end). Then we have to choose the portal (x,y) that minimizes this sum. \n\nBut since Megan can choose her path, she can choose any path, so the minimal sum would be the minimal of all such possible (x,y) positions along any possible path.\n\nWait, but Megan's path must be from her start to her destination, so the portals are along her path. But since Megan can choose any path, the best scenario is when the portal points are chosen such that the optimal (x,y) is the best possible. So perhaps the minimal total would be the minimal possible over all possible (x,y) that are along some path from M's start to her destination.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to choosing the best possible (x,y) which is on some path of Megan (so she can reach it on her way), and then calculate the minimal sum over all such (x,y).\n\nThe minimal sum would then be the minimum over all possible (x,y) of ( Stanley's distance to (x,y) + 1 + Stanley's distance from (x,y) to end) + ( Megan's path distance to (x,y) + 1 + Megan's distance from (x,y) to end).\n\nWait, but Megan's path distance to (x,y) is part of her path, so the minimal path for Megan would be the shortest path, which is Manhattan distance. But since Megan can choose any path, perhaps the minimal path for Megan is her Manhattan distance. Similarly for Stanley.\n\nWait the minimal distance Megan can take is (n-1) + (m-2) steps? Wait Megan starts at (n,1) and ends at (1,m). So the Manhattan distance is (n-1) + (m-1) steps. So the minimal path would be moving up and right. \n\nHmm, so the best (x,y) would be along that minimal path. So the minimal (x,y) would be somewhere along that path. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to choosing a point (x,y) along the straight path (the minimal path) for Megan, and then compute the sum for that point, then find the minimal such sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best point is the one that minimizes the total of (S's path to x,y + 1 + S's remaining) plus (M's path to x,y + 1 + M's remaining).\n\nLet me think of the coordinates as 1-based. Let me denote:\n\nStanley's start is (1,1), his end is (n,m).\n\nMegan's start is (n,1), her end is (1, m).\n\nSuppose they use a common portal at (x,y). Then the total energy is:\n\nFor Stanley: \n\ndistance from (1,1) to (x,y) + 1 (teleport) + distance from (x,y) to (n,m)\n\nFor Megan:\n\ndistance from (n,1) to (x,y) + 1 (teleport) + distance from (x,y) to (1,m)\n\nThe total is the sum of both.\n\nWe need to choose (x,y) that is along Megan's path (so Megan can reach it on her way to her destination), so (x,y) must be on some path from (n,1) to (1,m). The best possible (x,y) would be the one that minimizes the sum.\n\nAlternatively, since Megan can choose any path, she can choose a path that allows any (x,y) along any path between start and end, so perhaps (x,y) can be anywhere along the minimal path. \n\nBut since the minimal path is the Manhattan path (moving up and right), the best point would be the one that gives the minimal total.\n\nSo let's model (x,y) as any point along Megan's minimal path. So Megan's path is moving up (from row n to 1) and right (from column 1 to m). \n\nWait Megan can take any path, but the minimal path is of length (n-1)+(m-1). But she can choose any path, so perhaps the best (x,y) is the point that gives the minimal sum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal (x,y) is the point where the total of the four terms is minimized.\n\nLet me compute the four terms:\n\nLet's denote the coordinates as (x,y). \n\nStanley's distance to (x,y) is (x-1) + (y-1).\n\nThen, from there to (n,m): (n -x) + (m - y).\n\nSo Stanley's contribution without teleport would be (x-1 + y-1) + (n-x + m -y) = (x-1 + y-1 + n -x + m -y) = n + m - 2, which is the same as his Manhattan distance. So the teleport adds 1 and subtracts the distance between the two parts. Wait, no, when using the portal, Stanley can teleport instead of moving from (x,y) to ... well, he can choose to teleport to another portal. Wait, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, the teleport allows Stanley to move from (x,y) to any other portal (including Megan's starting point, etc) for 1. So the idea is that instead of moving from (x,y) to (n,m), he can teleport to another portal closer to his destination. But to minimize the total, perhaps the best is to teleport directly from (x,y) to the destination via a portal. Wait that might not always be possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best scenario is that both use the same portal to teleport. For example, they both reach a common portal point (x,y) and then teleport to each other's destination? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total can be calculated as follows: \n\nThe combined minimal path is such that they can share some portals to minimize their paths. Let me think of the minimal possible scenario.\n\nThe minimal total energy is (distance S starts to end) + (distance M starts to end) - (the maximum of the overlapping path's savings). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is (n + m - 1) * 2 - something. Let me see:\n\nWithout any portals, the total would be 2*( (n-1)+(m-1) ), which is 2*(n+m -2). \n\nBut with portals, perhaps they can save some steps. \n\nSuppose they can meet at a common point where they can teleport. The maximum possible savings would be when they can teleport once each, saving the distance between their paths.\n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal possible total as (sum of their manhattan distances) minus (some overlap) plus 2 (for the two teleports). \n\nHmm perhaps the minimal total is (n + m -1) *2 - (some overlap) + 2.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible sum is ( (n + m -1) + (n + m -1) ) - (the minimal possible overlap distance between their paths).\n\nWait, perhaps the best they can do is to meet at a point that allows both of them to save as much as possible. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into finding the minimal value of (Stanley's path to the portal + 1 + Stanley's path from the portal to end) + (Megan's path to the portal + 1 + Megan's path from portal to end). \n\nLet me call the portal point (x,y). \n\nSo the total cost is:\n\n( (distance_S_start_to_portal) + 1 + (distance_S_portal_to_end) ) + \n\n( (distance_M_start_to_portal) + 1 + (distance_M_portal_to_end) )\n\nThis simplifies to \n\n[ (distance_S_start_to_portal + distance_S_portal_to_end ) + (distance_M_start_to_portal + distance_M_portal_to_end ) ] + 2 \n\nBecause each teleport adds 1, so total 2 added.\n\nNow, the terms in the brackets are the sum of Stanley's total path and Megan's total path, which is (S's Manhattan distance) + (M's Manhattan distance) = (n+m-2)+(n+m-2) = 2*(n+m-2). So adding 2 gives 2*(n+m-2)+2 = 2(n+m-1). \n\nWait that can't be right. That would mean that the total cost is the same as if they didn't use the portal. Because we added the two teleport steps. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait because, actually, by using the portal, they can skip part of their path. For example, if Stanley teleports from (x,y), then the path from (x,y) to end is replaced by teleport (cost 1). So the total for Stanley would be (distance to portal) + 1. Similarly for Megan?\n\nWait no. Let me re-express:\n\nSuppose Stanley chooses to teleport from (x,y) to some other portal (maybe Megan's start point?), but the best is to teleport directly to the end. But that might not be possible unless the end has a portal.\n\nAh, right! Megan's end is (1,m). So Megan will have a portal there at the end. But that depends on her path. \n\nWait Megan's path must go from (n,1) to (1,m). So she must pass through (1,m) as her destination, so that cell has a portal. So if Stanley can reach a portal before Megan reaches her end, he can teleport to (1,m), but that may not be helpful for his path.\n\nHmm, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me think of some examples.\n\nTake the first test case example given in the note. \n\nThe example says n=7, m=5? Because Megan moves to (7,3). \n\nWait the note says Megan moves to (7,3) then to (1,3). The example's final answer is 15. Let me see what the code currently does. \n\nThe original code in the problem has:\n\nres = m + n; then if n>m, ... else, res += n+1. Then if n==0 and m==0 set to 0.\n\nWait let's see for n=7, m=5:\n\nn is 7, m is5.\n\nOriginal code first does n--; m--; so n becomes 6 and m 4. \n\nres = 6 +4 =10.\n\nThen since n>m (6>4), the code would enter the if(n>m) block. But the current code's if(n>m) block is commented as \"TODO\". So the code as given would proceed to the else part? Wait no, the code's structure is:\n\nif(n>m) { /* TODO */ }\n\nelse { res +=n+1 }\n\nWait in this case n=6>4, so it's in the first block. But since the code there is empty, it just does the 'res +=n+1'? No, the else is only for when n<=m.\n\nWait no, the code is: \n\nAfter setting res = m +n (which after the decrement is 6+4=10), then:\n\nif (n >m) { /* todo */ }\n\nelse: res += n+1.\n\nSo in the example of n=7, m=5 (after decrement, 6 and4) the if condition is true (6>4). So the code would enter the first block, but there is no code there. Thus, the res would remain as 10, then after adding the check for n==0 and m==0, it would print 10. But the correct answer is 15, so the code is not handling that correctly. \n\nWait no, the correct answer in the note is 15, but according to the sample input, perhaps the first test case is n=7, m=5? Then the code as given produces 10? Which is wrong. So the code is incorrect, and the missing part is in the 'if (n>m)' block.\n\nHmm, so the problem requires figuring out what code to put in that if(n>m) block to compute the correct res.\n\nLooking at the current code:\n\nThe code starts with n and m, then does n--; m--;. So perhaps they are 1-based to 0-based indices?\n\nWait the problem states that the coordinates are 1-based. The code subtracts 1 from each? Maybe that's to make them 0-based for easier calculations.\n\nThe initial res is m +n after the decrement. So for the first test case, 6+4=10. Then the else block adds n+1 (when n <=m). \n\nBut in the note, the correct answer is 15. So in the case of n=7 and m=5, the code would have entered the 'if (n>m) block (since 6>4), so the code inside the if block must do something else to reach 15?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct formula is that when n and m are given, the minimal total is (n+m-1)*2 - (something). \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the minimal total as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is (n + m - 1) * 2 - ( (min(n-1, m-1) ) * 2 + 1 ), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m -1) *2 - (some value). Let's see the sample input.\n\nSample input (from note's first case):\n\nn=7, m=5. So n +m-1 = 7+5-1 =11. 2*11=22. Subtract something to get 15. So 22 -7=15. So 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in the note's example, the correct answer is 15. Let me see what the code currently would give. The code after decrementing n and m (6 and4), enters the if block (since 6>4). The code inside that block is missing. So whatever code is missing there must compute the correct result.\n\nThe else block (when n<=m) adds n+1 to the initial res (which was m +n). So for example, if n=4, m=6 (after decrement, n=3, m=5). Then the initial res is 3+5=8, then adding 3+1 =4, total 12. \n\nWait maybe the correct formula is when n <=m, the result is (m + n) + (n+1) = m + n + n +1 = m + 2n +1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal total as follows:\n\nThe minimal total is (a + b), where a is Stanley's path and b is Megan's path, but with optimal use of portals.\n\nThe minimal possible total is (n + m -1) + (n + m -1) - (the minimal possible overlap saved via portals).\n\nThe maximum possible saving comes from when they can teleport once each, saving (distance between the two paths). \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total can be found using the formula:\n\nThe minimal total is 2*(n + m -1) - (min(n, m) * 2) + 2; \n\nWait let's see for the sample:\n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 min(7,5)=5. So 2*(11) -10 +2 \u2192 22-10+2=14. Hmm, not 15. Not right.\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nLet me think again of the problem, trying to find a pattern.\n\nSuppose n and m are the grid dimensions.\n\nThe minimal total is computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal path without portals would be 2*(n+m-2). With portals, it can be reduced by choosing a point where they can teleport.\n\nThe optimal point to teleport is somewhere along the path where the combined savings are maximum.\n\nThe best point is probably where the Manhattan distances overlap.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the following approach:\n\nThe optimal path uses the portals such that both can teleport through a common point. The best point is the one that minimizes the total energy.\n\nLet me think of the minimal possible total as:\n\nmax(n, m) * 3 - 1 ?\n\nWait not sure. Let me think of the sample case:\n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 max is 7 \u2192 7*3-1 =20, which is higher than 15.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, when you can choose the best point (x,y) along Megan's path, the minimal total would be:\n\n(S's distance to (x,y) + 1 + S's remaining steps) + (M's distance to (x,y) + 1 + M's remaining steps).\n\nBut this is S_total + M_total + 2, which again is the same as the original without savings, so that approach must be wrong.\n\nWait perhaps the key is that when you use a portal, you can teleport to any other portal, not just one. So maybe they can teleport multiple times?\n\nWait the problem says they can use the portal at any cell with a portal. So for example, Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So once Megan has visited a cell, any time after that (in their paths) they can use that portal.\n\nThe portals can be used any number of times, but each teleport consumes 1 energy. So the optimal path may involve multiple teleports, but the minimal path would probably use just one teleport each.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is (n + m) * 2 - (something). \n\nWait in the sample case, 7+5 is 12, 12*2 is 24. 24-9=15 \u2192 24-9=15. So 9 is the subtraction. What is 9? 7+2 \u2192 not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m -1) *2 - (min(n,m)*2). Let's see:\n\nFor the sample: (7+5-1)*2 - (5*2)= 11*2-10=22-10=12 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern in the formula.\n\nThe code given in the problem is:\n\nAfter n-- and m--:\n\nres = m +n (so (n+m after decrement))\n\nThen, if n>m, do something, else add (n+1) to res.\n\nIn the sample case (n=7 \u21926, m=5 \u21924), the else is not taken, so the code would do the if block's code. So what should be in there?\n\nSuppose that when n>m (after decrement, so original n was bigger than original m?), then the code should do something like res += m +1?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSample case: After decrement, n=6, m=4. If the code adds m +1 (4+1=5), then total res would be 10 +5 =15 which matches the sample answer. \n\nSo perhaps the code inside the if (n>m) block should be res += m +1;\n\nThen in the else part (when n <= m), add n+1.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So:\n\nThe formula is:\n\nres = (n + m (after decrement)) + (if n>m: m+1 else: n+1).\n\nWait let's see:\n\nOriginal code's initial res is (n' + m'), where n' = original n-1, m' = original m-1.\n\nThen, if (n' > m') \u2192 then res += m' +1.\n\nElse res += n' +1.\n\nWait let's see for the sample case:\n\nn' =6, m'=4. 6>4 \u2192 so res +=4+1 =5 \u2192 total res =10+5=15. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where n=1, m=1.\n\nOriginal n=1, m=1 \u2192 after decrement 0 and 0 \u2192 n' and m' are 0.\n\nThe if (n>m) is 0>0 \u2192 false. Enter else, add 0+1 \u2192 1 \u2192 but then code checks if n==0 and m==0 (they are 0 here), so set to 0. So correct.\n\nAnother test case where n=1, m=2. \n\nOriginal n=1, m=2 \u2192 n'=0, m'=1.\n\nSince n' <= m', so add 0+1=1 \u2192 res = 0+1 (original res =0+1=1, then adding 0+1 gives 2? Wait initial res is m' +n' =0+1=1. Then add n' +1 (0+1=1 \u2192 total 2). \n\nBut what is the correct answer here?\n\nStanley starts at (1,1) and needs to reach (1,2). So he can just move right once \u2192 1 energy.\n\nMegan starts at (1,1) \u2192 her start is the same as Stanley's. So she is there already. Her destination is (1,2). So she can move right once \u2192 1. Total 2 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example where n=2, m=2 \u2192 after decrement, n'=1, m'=1. \n\nSo n' == m', so enter else: add 1+1=2. Initial res is 2 \u2192 total 4. \n\nThe correct total would be ?\n\nStanley's path: from (1,1) to (2,2): distance is 2 steps. Megan's path from (2,1) to (1,2): distance 2 steps. Total 4.\n\nBut if they can use portals:\n\nMegan can move to her starting cell (the first cell), then maybe she can use a portal. Let me see:\n\nSuppose Megan moves directly to her destination (1,2). Her path is moving up 1 step and right 1. So she leaves portals in (2,1), (2,2)? Or her path is (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) then (1,2) ?\n\nWait Megan's path can be (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2). So she leaves portals in (2,1), (2,2), (1,2). \n\nStanley can use the portal at (2,1) (if Megan has been there). \n\nWait Megan starts at (2,1) so that has a portal. So Stanley can go to (2,1) (distance 1 step up?), then teleport to Megan's other portals. Wait Stanley starts at (1,1). \n\nTo reach Megan's starting point (2,1), he needs to move down 1 \u2192 cost 1. Then he can teleport to (1,2) (Megan's destination). The teleport costs 1. Then he is at (1,2), but his destination is (2,2). So he needs to move down 1 (cost 1). \n\nTotal for Stanley: 1 (to portal) +1 (teleport) +1 (move down) \u2192 total 3.\n\nMegan's path: from (2,1) to (1,2) is 2 steps \u2192 her cost is 2.\n\nTotal is 3+2 =5, which is less than 4. Wait but according to the initial formula's output would give 4 \u2192 which contradicts this?\n\nHmm this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. \n\nWait what is the minimal total here?\n\nWait the problem says that Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So Megan's path is (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2). So portals are at (2,1), (2,2), and (1,2). \n\nStanley's path can be:\n\nGo to (2,1) (cost 1 down), then teleport to (1,2) (cost 1), then move to (2,2) (cost 1). Total 1+1+1=3.\n\nMegan's path is 2 steps \u2192 total 2. So total 5. \n\nBut according to the formula, when n=2 and m=2, the code would do:\n\nn' =1, m'=1.\n\nInitial res =1+1=2.\n\nThen since n' equals m', enter the else: add n' +1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 total res=2+2=4. Which contradicts the actual minimal of 5? Wait that can't be.\n\nHmm so there's a problem here. So the initial assumption may be incorrect. \n\nWait what's the correct answer here?\n\nWait let's compute the minimal total energy:\n\nThey can choose their paths to minimize their total. \n\nAlternative path for Megan: she goes directly from (2,1) to (1,2) in 2 steps. \n\nStanley can go from (1,1) to (2,2) via any path. Let's see:\n\nIf Stanley takes his own path without using portals: 2 steps. Total 2+2=4.\n\nWhich is better than the other path which gives 5.\n\nAh, right! So the minimal total is 4. Because the portals are only useful if using them gives a shorter path.\n\nIn that case, the formula's output of 4 is correct.\n\nAh okay, so the formula is correct in that case. \n\nIn the scenario where they don't use portals, the total is better. So the formula is correct.\n\nThus, the formula proposed earlier seems to work. \n\nLet me think of the formula:\n\nres = (n' + m') + (if n' > m' then m'+1 else n' +1 )\n\nwhere n' = original n-1, m'=original m-1.\n\nWait let me rephrase this:\n\nThe formula is ( (n-1) + (m-1) ) + ( (min(n-1, m-1) +1) )\n\nBecause when n-1 > m-1 \u2192 then m-1 +1 = m.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nThe first term is (n-1 + m-1). The second term is if n>m then m else n.\n\nWait:\n\nn' = n-1 \n\nm' = m-1 \n\nif n' > m', then add (m' +1) \u2192 m.\n\nElse add (n' +1) \u2192n.\n\nThus the total res would be (n-1 + m-1) + (min(n,m)).\n\nWait simplifying:\n\nres = (n+m-2) + min(n, m) \n\nWait let me see:\n\nFor the sample case (n=7, m=5): \n\n7+5-2 =10, plus 5 \u2192 15, which matches.\n\nFor the case n=2, m=2 \u2192 2+2-2 =2, plus min(2,2)=2 \u2192 total 4.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=2:\n\nn'=0, m'=1 \u2192 n' <= m', so add n' +1 =1. \n\nTotal res is (0+1) +1 \u2192 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=2 \u2192 original n=3, m=2 \u2192 n'=2, m'=1.\n\nSince 2>1 \u2192 add m' +1 (1+1=2). \n\nres is (2+1)=3 + 2 \u21925. \n\nLet's compute manually:\n\nMegan's path is from (3,1) \u2192 (1,2). \n\nThe minimal path is up two steps and right 1. Wait the Manhattan distance is 2 (up from 3 to1) +1 (right) \u2192 total 3 steps.\n\nStanley's path from (1,1) to (3,2): needs to go down 2 and right 1 \u2192 total 3 steps. Total without portals: 6.\n\nUsing the formula: 5 \u2192 how? \n\nLet me see the optimal path with portals:\n\nSuppose Megan chooses to place portals along her path. Let's see:\n\nMegan's path is (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). \n\nSo portals are at (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nStanley can use the portal at (1,1) (his starting point). Wait, but that's his starting cell. So he can teleport from there to any other portal for 1 energy. \n\nSuppose Stanley chooses to teleport to (3,1) (Megan's start) \u2192 that's free except for the 1 energy. Then he can proceed down to (3,2).\n\nWait his path would be:\n\nStart at (1,1). He can teleport (cost 1) to (3,1). Then move right to (3,2) (cost 1). Total: 1+1=2.\n\nMegan's path requires 3 steps. Total energy: 2+3=5 \u2192 which matches the formula's result. \n\nYes! That's better than the 6 without portals. \n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nSo the formula is:\n\nThe minimal total is (n + m - 2) + min(n, m).\n\nBecause:\n\n(n-1 + m-1) + (min(n, m)) \u2192 (n+m-2) + min(n,m).\n\nThus, how to code this.\n\nIn the code provided:\n\nAfter n-- and m--:\n\nres is set to (n + m). \n\nThen if n>m, then we need to add (m +1) \u2192 because m = (original m-1), so m+1 = original m.\n\nWait let me see:\n\nOriginal code after n-- and m--:\n\nres = (n + m) \u2192 which is (original n-1) + (original m-1).\n\nThen, if (n > m):\n\nthe addend is (m +1) \u2192 m+1 is (original m-1) +1 = original m.\n\nElse add (n+1) \u2192 (original n-1)+1 = original n.\n\nSo the total res becomes (n+m) + (min(n+1, m+1) ?)\n\nWait, no, the code's add is either m+1 or n+1. Which is exactly the min between original n and m?\n\nBecause when n>m (i.e. original n-1 > m-1 \u2192 original n > m) then original n is larger than m, so the min is m. So adding m is correct. \n\nSimilarly when n <=m, then the min is original n, so add n. \n\nThus the formula works.\n\nSo, in the code's if block (if n>m):\n\nWe must add (m+1). \n\nBecause m was decremented, so m+1 gives the original m.\n\nWait the code currently has:\n\nres = m +n; \n\nThen:\n\nif(n>m) { /* add m+1 here */ } \n\nelse { res +=n+1; }\n\nWait, no: the else part adds n+1 (which is original n). \n\nYes, exactly. \n\nSo inside the if(n>m) block, we need to add (m+1).\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nif(n>m) \n\n    res += m +1;\n\nelse \n\n    res +=n+1;\n\nThus, the missing code is res += m+1;\n\nAdditionally, the code has a check for if(n==0 && m==0) \u2192 set res=0. Which handles the case where n and m are 1 (since after decrement they become 0). \n\nSo putting it all together, the code's missing part is 'res += m +1;'.\n\nTherefore, the correct code for the if block is:\n\nif(n>m)\n\n    res += (m+1);\n\nElse part is already handled.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nres += m+1;\n\nHence, the answer is to put that in the if block."
