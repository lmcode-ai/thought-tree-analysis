To minimize the moves, we want to choose the smallest possible |k_1|. Since there's no previous term, the minimal is 0 (k_1=0, so b_1=0). Wait, but then for the next term, b_2 must be >0. So the minimal possible b_2 is a_2 (since k_2 must be at least 1, so |k_2|=1). But maybe there's a better way. Let me see. Wait, but perhaps choosing a negative k_1 could allow a smaller total. For example, if a_1 is 1, then choosing k_1 = -1 gives b_1 = -1, which allows b_2 to be 0 (k_2=0), but then b_2 must be greater than -1. So 0 is okay. But then the next term must be greater than 0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C# code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. Each move allows adding or subtracting a_i to b_i. The initial b is all zeros. \n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves dynamic programming or some greedy method. Let me think about the example given. Like in example 1, they subtract a_1 from b_1, so that the first element becomes -1, then the next is 0, and the rest are built up. The key is that each next element must be strictly larger than the previous. \n\nThe code provided seems to be trying a loop over possible starting points (maybe the peak?), but I'm not sure. Let me look at the existing code structure. \n\nThe outer loop is for i from 0 to n-1. For each i, they calculate a total count. Then, they have two loops: one going backward from i-1 to 0, and another forward from i+1 to n-1. \n\nWait, the forward loop part is partially filled. Let me see the forward part first. In the forward loop (ii from i+1 to n), they compute count as prevNumber / arrA[ii] plus 1, then add that to total. Then set prevNumber to count * arrA[ii]. \n\nWait, maybe the idea is that for each position after i, we need to ensure that the current b_ii is at least prevNumber + 1. The minimal steps would be to find the minimal number of a_ii additions needed to reach that. \n\nBut the backward loop is empty. The backward loop is for indices from i-1 down to 0. So perhaps the backward part is handling the elements before the current i. \n\nHmm, maybe the approach here is to choose a certain value for b[i], and then compute the minimal steps required for the elements before and after. The outer loop is iterating over possible positions i where the current element is set to some value, and then the minimal steps are calculated based on that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to fix the value of b[i] as 0, and then compute the required steps for the elements before and after. But I'm not sure. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the entire array b is strictly increasing. So each element must be greater than the previous. Let me think of the process step by step. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. For each position i, the value of b[i] must be at least b[i-1] + 1. Since initially b is all zeros, we can adjust each b[i] by adding or subtracting multiples of a_i. \n\nThe minimal moves would be to adjust each b[i] such that it's as small as possible but still satisfies the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the minimal required value for each b[i], given the previous elements. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of constraints. Let's denote the required b array as b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. \n\nThe constraints are: \nb_1 can be anything (since there's nothing before it), but then b_2 must be > b_1, b_3 > b_2, etc. \n\nEach b_i can be written as 0 + k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (since each move adds or subtracts a_i, so the total is k_i * a_i). Wait, no, actually each move can add or subtract a_i once. Wait, no, each move is either adding or subtracting a_i once. Wait, no, the problem says \"in one move you can choose an i and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i\". So each move contributes either +a_i or -a_i. So the total for b_i is the sum of all the moves made on it. So the total for b_i is (number of additions - number of subtractions) * a_i. Let me denote the number of additions as x_i and subtractions as y_i. Then the total is (x_i - y_i)*a_i. The number of moves for i is x_i + y_i. \n\nWe need to choose x_i and y_i for each i such that the resulting b array is strictly increasing, and the sum of (x_i + y_i) is minimized. \n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. \n\nAlternatively, since each move on i contributes either +a_i or -a_i, the total for b_i can be any integer multiple of a_i? Wait no, because each move is either adding or subtracting once. So the total for b_i is (k_i) * a_i, where k_i can be any integer (positive or negative). Because each move contributes \u00b1a_i, so the total is the sum of all those moves, which is (number of + moves - number of - moves) * a_i. So the total is indeed k_i * a_i, where k_i is any integer. \n\nWait, but the problem allows any number of moves. So the total for b_i can be any multiple of a_i. So the problem reduces to choosing integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that the sequence b_i = k_i * a_i is strictly increasing, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nWait, because each move contributes either +a_i or -a_i, so the number of moves for i is |k_i|. Because each step is a move. For example, if k_i is 3, that's 3 additions (3 moves). If it's -2, that's 2 subtractions (2 moves). So the total moves for each i is |k_i|, and the total is the sum of |k_i| for all i. \n\nAh, that's a crucial insight! So the problem is equivalent to choosing integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nk_1 * a_1 < k_2 * a_2 < ... < k_n * a_n,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nSo now the problem is transformed into finding such a sequence of k_i's with minimal sum of absolute values. \n\nNow, how do we model this? \n\nLet me think of the constraints. For each i from 2 to n, we must have k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. \n\nWe need to find the minimal sum of |k_i|. \n\nHmm, this seems like a dynamic programming problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this greedily. Let me think of the variables in order. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. For each position i, we need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > previous value (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}), and the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nBut how do we track the possible options? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the minimal possible k_i given the previous constraints. \n\nWait, let's think of the variables in terms of the previous term. Let me denote the previous term as prev = k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. \n\nThen, for the current term, we need k_i * a_i > prev. \n\nWe can choose k_i such that this holds, and |k_i| is as small as possible. \n\nBut how do we choose k_i optimally? \n\nAlternatively, for each i, given the previous value prev, the minimal |k_i| would be when k_i is as small as possible but still satisfies the inequality. \n\nWait, but the choice of k_i also affects the next terms. So this is a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current value of the previous term. \n\nHmm, the problem is that the possible values of prev can be very large (since a_i can be up to 1e9 and n up to 5000). So a DP approach with tracking the exact value might not be feasible. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think of the problem in terms of the minimal required k_i given the previous constraints. \n\nLet me consider the variables in terms of the previous term. Let me denote the previous term as x. Then, the current term must be at least x + 1. \n\nSo, for the current term, the minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nBut since we can choose k_i to be as small as possible (in absolute terms), perhaps we can model this as follows: \n\nWe can represent the minimal required k_i for each step, given the previous constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by greedily choosing the minimal possible k_i at each step, but ensuring that the constraints are met. \n\nWait, but the problem requires the minimal sum of |k_i|. So perhaps the optimal choice is to choose the minimal possible k_i such that the constraints are satisfied, but also considering the future steps. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as follows. \n\nWe can represent the required sequence of b_i as a strictly increasing sequence. Let me denote the required b_i as b_1, b_2, ..., b_n. \n\nEach b_i must be equal to some multiple of a_i (since b_i = k_i * a_i). \n\nThe constraints are b_i < b_{i+1} for all i. \n\nWe need to choose the k_i's such that the sum of |k_i| is minimized. \n\nLet me think of the variables in terms of the previous term. \n\nSuppose we have already chosen k_1, ..., k_{i-1}, and now we need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i (in absolute terms) that satisfies the inequality. \n\nBut how do we choose k_i such that it's as small as possible, but also allows the next terms to be as small as possible? \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the minimal possible value of b_i given the previous constraints, so that the next terms can be as small as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total moves can be found by greedily choosing the minimal possible b_i at each step, given the previous constraints. \n\nWait, let's think of the minimal possible b_i. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nStart with b_1 can be any multiple of a_1. To minimize the moves, we want to choose the smallest possible |k_1|. Since there's no previous term, the minimal is 0 (k_1=0, so b_1=0). \n\nWait, but then for the next term, b_2 must be >0. So the minimal possible b_2 is a_2 (since k_2 must be at least 1, so |k_2|=1). \n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let me see. \n\nWait, but perhaps choosing a negative k_1 could allow a smaller total. For example, if a_1 is 1, then choosing k_1 = -1 gives b_1 = -1, which allows b_2 to be 0 (k_2=0), but then b_2 must be greater than -1. So 0 is okay. But then the next term must be greater than 0. \n\nHmm, but in this case, the total moves would be 1 (for k_1) plus 0 (for k_2) plus whatever for the next terms. \n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing a negative k_1 can lead to a better total. \n\nSo the problem is that the choice of k_i affects the minimal possible choices for the next terms. \n\nThis suggests that a greedy approach might not work, and we need a dynamic programming approach. \n\nLet me think of dynamic programming. \n\nThe state can be the current index and the value of the previous b term. \n\nBut since the a_i can be up to 1e9 and n up to 5000, the state space would be too big. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to represent the state in terms of the previous term's value, but in a way that can be tracked efficiently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem in terms of the minimal possible b_i given the previous constraints, and track the minimal moves required up to that point. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's process the array from left to right. For each position i, we can track the minimal possible value of b_i and the minimal moves required to reach that. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, for each position i, the minimal moves would depend on the previous b_{i-1}. \n\nSuppose we have for position i-1, the minimal possible b_{i-1} is some value x. Then, for position i, the minimal possible b_i must be at least x + 1. \n\nThe minimal moves for i would be the minimal |k_i| such that k_i * a_i >= x + 1. \n\nWait, but k_i can be positive or negative. \n\nWait, the minimal |k_i| for k_i * a_i > x. \n\nWait, the minimal |k_i| would be the minimal integer such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nBut k_i can be positive or negative. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal |k_i| is achieved when k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nWait, but the direction (positive or negative) matters. \n\nLet me think of x as the previous term. \n\nWe need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the smallest positive k_i that satisfies the inequality, and the largest negative k_i that still allows the next terms to be possible. \n\nWait, but maybe the minimal |k_i| is achieved by choosing the smallest possible k_i (either positive or negative) that satisfies the inequality. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose x is the previous term. \n\nWe need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be the minimal between the ceiling of (x + 1)/a_i (if a_i is positive, which it is) and the floor of (x)/a_i minus 1? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i can be found as follows: \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nSince a_i is positive, this is equivalent to k_i > x / a_i. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is floor(x / a_i) + 1. \n\nWait, but that's only if we choose k_i to be positive. \n\nAlternatively, if x is negative, maybe a negative k_i could be better. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal |k_i| is achieved when k_i is as close as possible to x / a_i, but just enough to exceed it. \n\nWait, let me think numerically. \n\nSuppose x is 5, a_i is 3. \n\nThen, the minimal k_i is 2 (since 2*3=6>5). The |k_i| is 2. \n\nAlternatively, if x is 5 and a_i is 7, then k_i can be 1 (7>5), so |k_i|=1. \n\nIf x is -3 and a_i is 2, then the minimal k_i could be 0 (0*2=0 >-3, so that's acceptable. So |k_i|=0. \n\nAh, so in this case, choosing k_i=0 is better. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nSo to find the minimal |k_i|, we can compute the minimal possible k_i that satisfies the inequality, considering both positive and negative values. \n\nHmm, but how do we compute that? \n\nLet me think of possible candidates for k_i. \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the one that is closest to x/a_i but still satisfies the inequality. \n\nAlternatively, the possible candidates are the floor(x/a_i) +1, or the ceiling(x/a_i) +1? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal |k_i| can be found by considering the minimal between the ceiling of (x +1)/a_i and the floor of (x)/a_i +1? \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x/a_i. \n\nSo k_i_min = floor(x/a_i) +1. \n\nBut that's only if we choose positive k_i. \n\nAlternatively, if x is negative, maybe a negative k_i could be better. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose x is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nWe need k_i *3 > -5. \n\nPossible k_i can be 0 (0> -5, so yes). So |k_i|=0. \n\nThat's better than any positive or negative. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal is 0. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i can be zero if possible. \n\nWait, so the minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nSo the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the possible k_i's that satisfy the inequality. \n\nSo to find the minimal |k_i|, we can compute the possible k_i candidates and choose the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nThe possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than x/a_i (so that k_i *a_i >x). \n\n- The largest integer less than or equal to x/a_i, but then adding 1? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i can be found by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the one that is as close as possible to x/a_i, but still satisfies the inequality. \n\nLet me think of the equation: \n\nk_i * a_i > x \n\n=> k_i > x / a_i \n\nSince a_i is positive. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x/a_i. \n\nBut that's only if we choose positive k_i. \n\nAlternatively, if x/a_i is negative, then maybe a negative k_i could be better. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose x is 5, a_i is 3. \n\nx/a_i is ~1.666. So the minimal k_i is 2 (positive). \n\nIf x is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nx/a_i is -1.666. So the minimal k_i is -1 (since -1 *3 =-3 >-5? No, -3 is greater than -5. So yes. \n\nWait, but then k_i can be -1, which gives -3, which is greater than -5. \n\nWait, but then the minimal |k_i| is 1. \n\nAlternatively, k_i can be 0, which gives 0> -5, so that's better (|0|=0). \n\nAh right, so in this case, the minimal is 0. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i can be 0 if possible. \n\nWait, so the minimal k_i is the smallest integer (in absolute terms) such that k_i *a_i >x. \n\nSo the possible candidates are: \n\n- The floor(x/a_i) +1 (if that's positive). \n\n- The ceiling(x/a_i) (if that's negative). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal is the integer closest to x/a_i but just exceeding it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the ceiling of (x +1)/a_i and the floor of (x)/a_i +1? \n\nHmm, perhaps the best way is to compute the minimal possible k_i that satisfies the inequality, and then choose the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the possible k_i values that satisfy the inequality. \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer greater than x/a_i. \n\nBut that's only if we choose positive k_i. \n\nAlternatively, if x is negative, then k_i can be zero, which is better. \n\nWait, let's formalize this. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is the minimal between: \n\n- The smallest integer k such that k > x/a_i. \n\n- The largest integer k such that k <= x/a_i, but then adding 1? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal |k_i| can be found by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the one that is the closest to x/a_i but still satisfies the inequality. \n\nLet me think of the value x/a_i. \n\nSuppose x/a_i is not an integer. \n\nThen, the minimal k_i is the ceiling of (x/a_i). \n\nWait, no. Let me see. \n\nWait, for example, x=5, a_i=3. \n\nx/a_i is 1.666..., so the minimal k_i is 2. \n\nWhich is the ceiling of 1.666, which is 2. \n\nAnother example: x= -5, a_i=3. \n\nx/a_i is -1.666..., so the minimal k_i can be 0 (since 0> -5). \n\nWait, but 0 is less than x/a_i? \n\nWait, x/a_i is -1.666..., so k_i must be greater than that. \n\n0 is greater than -1.666, so yes. \n\nSo the minimal k_i here is 0, which is better than 1 (which would give 3> -5, but |1| is 1, which is worse than 0). \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i can be 0 in this case. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x/a_i, but also considering that 0 might be a better option. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer k such that k > x/a_i, and also considering that k can be as small as possible (including negative numbers). \n\nWait, but how do we find that? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the ceiling of (x/a_i) and the floor of (x/a_i) +1? \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k_i is the one that is the closest to x/a_i but still satisfies the inequality. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal |k_i| can be found by considering the following: \n\nLet me denote t = x / a_i. \n\nWe need k_i > t. \n\nThe possible candidates are the integers just above t. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the ceiling(t) and the floor(t) +1? \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal is the integer closest to t but still greater than t. \n\nWait, for example, if t is 1.2, then the minimal k_i is 2 (ceiling(1.2)=2). \n\nIf t is -1.2, then the minimal k_i can be -1 (since -1 > -1.2, and |k_i|=1, but 0 is even better (0> -1.2, so |0|=0). \n\nAh, so in that case, the minimal is 0. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal k_i can be 0 if possible. \n\nWait, so the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than t (x/a_i) with the smallest absolute value. \n\nSo the possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than t. \n\n- The largest integer less than or equal to t, but then adding 1? \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than t, but also considering that if t is negative, then 0 might be a better option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k_i is the minimal between the ceiling(t) and the floor(t) +1, but also considering 0 if possible. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too vague. Maybe there's a formula here. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal possible k_i as follows: \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the possible k_i's. \n\nSo to find the minimal |k_i|, we can compute the possible k_i candidates and choose the one with the smallest absolute value. \n\nThe possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than x/a_i. \n\n- The largest integer less than or equal to x/a_i, but then adding 1? \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x/a_i. \n\nBut in the case where x/a_i is negative, then 0 could be a better option. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose x is -5, a_i is 3. \n\nx/a_i is -1.666..., so the smallest integer greater than that is -1. \n\nBut then k_i = -1 gives -3, which is greater than -5. \n\nBut 0 is also a valid k_i (0> -5), and |0| is smaller. \n\nSo the minimal is 0. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i can be 0 even if it's not the next integer after x/a_i. \n\nSo perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x/a_i, but also considering that 0 is allowed if it satisfies the inequality. \n\nWait, but how do we find that? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the minimal between the ceiling of (x +1)/a_i and the floor of (x)/a_i +1? \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k_i can be found by considering the following: \n\nThe minimal possible k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > x. \n\nThe minimal |k_i| is the minimal between the possible k_i's. \n\nSo the possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than x/a_i. \n\n- The largest integer less than or equal to x/a_i, but then adding 1? \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than x/a_i. \n\nBut in the case where x/a_i is negative, then 0 is a better option. \n\nWait, let me think of the formula. \n\nLet me denote t = x / a_i. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nBut if t is negative, then 0 is a possible candidate. \n\nWait, so the minimal k_i is the minimal between the ceiling(t) and 0 (if 0 satisfies the inequality). \n\nWait, but how do I compute that? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the minimal between the ceiling(t) and the floor(t) +1? \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than t, but also considering that if t is negative, then 0 is a better option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k_i is the minimal between the ceiling(t) and 0 (if 0 is allowed). \n\nWait, let me think of the example where x is -5 and a_i is 3. \n\nt = -5/3 \u2248 -1.666. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than -1.666, which is -1. \n\nBut 0 is also allowed, and |0| is smaller. \n\nSo the minimal is 0. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal k_i is 0, which is better than -1. \n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i can be 0 even if it's not the next integer after t. \n\nSo perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than t, but also considering that 0 is allowed if it satisfies the inequality. \n\nWait, but how do I find that? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer k such that k > t, and |k| is minimized. \n\nSo the possible candidates are: \n\n- The smallest integer greater than t. \n\n- The largest integer less than or equal to t, but then adding 1? \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k_i is the integer closest to t but still greater than t. \n\nWait, but in the case where t is negative, 0 is closer to t than the ceiling(t). \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than t, but also considering that if t is negative, then 0 is a candidate. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the minimal between the ceiling(t) and 0 (if 0 is allowed). \n\nWait, but how do I compute that? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the minimal between the ceiling(t) and the floor(t) +1. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nLet me think of t = x/a_i. \n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nSo that's the ceiling of t. \n\nWait, no. The ceiling of t is the smallest integer greater than or equal to t. \n\nWait, if t is not an integer, then ceiling(t) is the smallest integer greater than t. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the ceiling(t). \n\nWait, but in the example where x is -5 and a_i is 3, t is -1.666..., so ceiling(t) is -1. \n\nBut 0 is better. \n\nAh, so that approach would give k_i = -1, but 0 is better. \n\nHmm, so that approach is not correct. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than t, but also considering that 0 is allowed. \n\nWait, but how do I know when 0 is allowed? \n\n0 is allowed if 0 * a_i > x. \n\nWhich is equivalent to 0 > x. \n\nSo if x <0, then 0 is allowed. \n\nSo in that case, the minimal k_i can be 0, which is better than the ceiling(t). \n\nSo the minimal k_i is the minimal between ceiling(t) and 0 (if x <0). \n\nWait, but how do I choose between them? \n\nLet me see. \n\nIn the example where x is -5 and a_i is 3: \n\nceiling(t) is -1. \n\n0 is allowed (since 0> -5). \n\nThe |k_i| for -1 is 1, for 0 is 0. \n\nSo 0 is better. \n\nAnother example: x is -2, a_i is 3. \n\nt is -0.666..., so ceiling(t) is -0 (since -0.666's ceiling is -0? Wait, no. \n\nWait, ceiling(-1.666) is -1. \n\nWait, ceiling(-0.666) is -0? No, ceiling(-0.666) is -0? \n\nWait, the ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer. \n\nSo for -0.666, the ceiling is -0.666 rounded up to -0.666's next integer, which is -0? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the ceiling of -0.666 is -0.666 rounded up, which is -0.666 \u2192 the smallest integer greater than or equal to it is -0.666 \u2192 the next integer is -0? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the ceiling of -0.666 is -0.666 rounded up to the nearest integer. \n\nThe integers around it are -1 and 0. \n\nThe ceiling is the smallest integer greater than or equal to -0.666. \n\nThat would be 0? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, -0.666 is between -1 and 0. \n\nThe ceiling is the smallest integer greater than or equal to -0.666. \n\nThat would be 0? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the ceiling of -0.666 is -0.666 rounded up, which is -0.666 \u2192 the next integer is -0.666 \u2192 the ceiling is -0.666 \u2192 the smallest integer greater than or equal to it is -0.666 \u2192 the next integer is -0.666
