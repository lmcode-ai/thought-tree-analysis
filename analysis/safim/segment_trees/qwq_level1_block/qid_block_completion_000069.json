Let me start by understanding the problem. The awesomeness of an array is the minimum number of consecutive blocks of identical elements. For example, [1,2,2] has awesomeness 2 because it's split into [1], [2,2]. The task is to compute the sum of this value for every possible subarray after each update. The provided code seems to have some logic for the initial array and handling queries, but it's incomplete. Let me look at the initial approach. In the initial part, the code is trying to compute 'sum' which is probably the initial answer. The code loops through the array, and for each element after the first, it checks if it's different from the previous. The 'ans' variable is being calculated in a way that might be the awesomeness for the entire array? Maybe not. The code's logic is unclear here, and the approach might be incorrect. Hmm, perhaps the initial approach is flawed. Let me think of the correct way to compute the sum of all subarray awesomeness efficiently.",

The transitions between different elements are the points where a new block starts. So for a subarray, the number of transitions (places where a[i] != a[i-1]) plus 1 gives the awesomeness. So the awesomeness of a subarray is (number of transitions in it) +1. So the problem reduces to calculating, for every possible subarray [l..r], the number of transitions between elements in that subarray, then sum all (transitions +1). The total sum is sum over all subarrays (transitions_count + 1). Which can be rewritten as (sum of transitions_count over all subarrays) + (number of subarrays).

Because the transition between p-1 and p depends on the previous p-1 and p values, as well as the new p's value. Similarly, the transition between p and p+1 also depends on p's new value. Therefore, the approach would be:\n\n- Maintain an array that records all the transition positions (i where a[i] ! = a[i+1]).\n\n- For each query, when we change a[i], we need to check transitions at i-1 and i (assuming the elements are 1-based here, or 0-based?

So the position is p in the input (1-based), stored as arr[p-1] (0-based). Therefore, when updating the position p (input's 1-based, so 0-based index is pos = p-1):\n\nCheck transitions at pos-1 (if pos>0) and at pos (if pos <n-1).

So the code must first compute the delta, then update the arr[pos]. Wait no, because in the code that's written, the arr is being set after the computation. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, the code in the problem's initial code is:\n\nafter checking, it does arr[p-1] = x at the end of the loop.

Wait no, in this code: Wait, in the code outline above, the steps are: First, compute old_val = a[pos], then, when calculating the new transitions, the new_val is x. But in the code's loops:\n\nFor the transition at i=pos-1 (between pos-1 and pos):\n\nthe previous a[pos] (before change) is old_val. So the old transition (before the change) is (a[i] != old_val). The new transition is (a[i] (unchanged) vs new_val x). Thus, the code above is correct in using x here. Similarly, for the transition at i=pos (between pos and pos+1):\n\nthe old transition was between old_val and a[pos+1]. The new transition is between x and a[pos+1]. So the code's logic is correct. Wait but in the code above, when calculating the transition at pos (i=pos):\n\ntrans[i] was stored as (a[i] ! = a[i+1]). However, before the position's value was changed, so a[i] is still the old value here. Wait, in code:\n\nold_t = trans[i] which was computed as (a[i] ! = a[i+1]) before any changes. But the trans array hasn't been updated yet. Wait, the trans array is only updated after computing new_t. Wait the code above does:\n\nbool new_t = (x != a[pos+1]); // since pos is the i (the index) here. Wait, the a[pos+1] hasn't been changed, so yes. Thus, the code would correctly compute new_t as (x vs a[pos+1]). Therefore, the code's logic is correct. Wait but in the code: Wait in the transition at pos (i=pos):\n\nthe previous transition was trans[i] = (a[pos] (old_val) != a[pos+1]). new_t is (x != a[pos+1]. Thus, the code correctly captures the old and new transitions. Therefore, after computing delta, we need to update the trans array (trans[i] = new_t). Hence, this approach should work.

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this code is trying to compute the delta caused by changing the element at position p-1. The code's logic in the first block (previous exist) is handling the transition before the changed position. The code seems to be making some adjustments to the sum, but the approach is not clear. The TODO is in the else if (x == arr[p-2]) case. So when the new x is the same as the element before (p-2), which was previously different from the old value of the current (p-1). So in that case, perhaps a new transition is removed? But the code is incomplete there. The problem is that without knowing the correct approach, it's hard to fill in the missing code.",

Initial setup:\n\ni=0: no changes to sum or ans. i=1 (second element, value 2). flag = true (2 !=1). ans = (1 *1) + 1 (previous ans was 1) +1 \u2192 1+1+1=3? sum += ans (3 \u2192 sum is 1+3=4). i=2 (third element, 2):\n\nflag = false (2 ==2).\n\nans = 0*2 + 3 (previous ans) +1 \u2192 0 +3 +1 =4.\n\nsum +=4 \u2192 sum is 8.\n\ni=3 (4):\n\nflag = true (4 !=2).\n\nans = 1*3 (i=3) + previous ans (4) +1 \u21923+4+1=8.\n\nsum +=8 \u2192 16.\n\ni=4 (5):\n\nflag = true (5 !=4).\n\nans =1*4 (i=4) +8 (previous ans) +1 \u21924+8+1=13. sum +=13 \u2192 total sum 29, which matches the sample's answer.

So the code's initial approach must be correct. Therefore, there must be a different way to compute the sum of awesomeness of all subarrays. The initial code's approach:\n\nThe 'sum' is computed as the sum of ans for each i from 0 to n-1. The ans for each i is computed as flag *i + ans_prev +1. Where flag is whether current element differs from previous. Let me try to see what ans represents. Let me see the sample:\n\narray is [1,2,2,4,5]. The sum after initialization is 29. The sum is the sum of ans for each i:\n\nFor i=0:\n\nans is initialized to 1.

Thus, the total sum is 1+3+4+8+13 =29. The sample's answer is 29, so this works. So what does 'ans' represent? For each i, ans seems to be the awesomeness of the subarray from the first element up to i. In the first case (i=0), ans is 1 (awesomeness of [1]). i=1: ans is 2 \u2192 but awesomeness of [1,2] is 2?

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to fix the given C++ code so it correctly calculates the sum of the awesomeness for all subsegments after each query. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe awesomeness of an array is the minimum number of consecutive blocks of identical elements. For example, [1,2,2] has awesomeness 2 because it's split into [1], [2,2]. The task is to compute the sum of this value for every possible subarray after each update.\n\nThe provided code seems to have some logic for the initial array and handling queries, but it's incomplete. Let me look at the initial approach.\n\nIn the initial part, the code is trying to compute 'sum' which is probably the initial answer. The code loops through the array, and for each element after the first, it checks if it's different from the previous. The 'ans' variable is being calculated in a way that might be the awesomeness for the entire array? Maybe not. The code's logic is unclear here, and the approach might be incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is flawed. Let me think of the correct way to compute the sum of all subarray awesomeness efficiently.\n\nThe brute-force approach would be for every subarray [l..r], compute its awesomeness and sum all. But with n up to 1e5, that\u2019s O(n^2) which is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nThe key observation here is that the awesomeness of a subarray is equal to the number of transitions between different elements plus 1. For example, the array [1,2,2,3] has 3 transitions (1->2, 2->3), so awesomeness is 3+1=4? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the awesomeness is the number of blocks. The transitions between different elements are the points where a new block starts. So for a subarray, the number of transitions (places where a[i] != a[i-1]) plus 1 gives the awesomeness. So the awesomeness of a subarray is (number of transitions in it) +1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating, for every possible subarray [l..r], the number of transitions between elements in that subarray, then sum all (transitions +1). The total sum is sum over all subarrays (transitions_count + 1).\n\nWhich can be rewritten as (sum of transitions_count over all subarrays) + (number of subarrays). Since each subarray contributes 1, the total is (number of subarrays) + sum of all transitions in all subarrays.\n\nThe number of subarrays is n*(n+1)/2. So the problem is to find the sum of transitions in all subarrays.\n\nSo the main problem reduces to calculating the sum of transitions in all subarrays. Let me think how to compute that efficiently.\n\nA transition is between two consecutive elements. Let's consider each position i (from 1 to n-1) where a[i] != a[i-1]. Let's call these \"breakpoints\". Each such breakpoint contributes to all subarrays that include it and where it is between two elements of the subarray.\n\nWait, for a breakpoint between i and i+1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), let's say between positions (i, i+1) (1-based), a[i] != a[i+1]. Then, this breakpoint is part of a subarray [l..r] if l <= i and r >= i+1. The number of such subarrays is i * (n - i). Because l can be from 1 to i, and r can be from i+1 to n. So for each breakpoint between i and i+1, it contributes exactly (i) * (n - i) to the total sum of transitions.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe number of subarrays that include the breakpoint between i and i+1 is the number of l choices (from 1 to i) multiplied by the number of r choices (from i+1 to n). So yes, l can be any from 1 to i, and r can be any from i+1 to n. So total is indeed i*(n - i). Each such subarray includes this breakpoint as a transition. Therefore, the total transitions across all subarrays is the sum over all breakpoints (i) of (i) * (n - i).\n\nWait, but the positions of the breakpoints matter. So the total transitions sum is sum_{each breakpoint at position k} (k's contribution). So if between indices a and b there's a transition, then the contribution is (a) * (n - a), assuming a is the position where the transition occurs. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the indices.\n\nLet me consider the array as 1-based. For each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nIf a[i] != a[i+1], then this is a transition point between i and i+1. So the position of the transition is at i (since it's between i and i+1). So the contribution of this transition to the total sum of transitions is the number of subarrays that include this transition as part of their transitions.\n\nThe number of such subarrays is (i) * (n - i). Because:\n\n- The start l can be any from 1 to i (so that l <= i).\n\n- The end r can be any from i+1 to n (so that r >= i+1).\n\nSo for each transition at position i (between i and i+1), it contributes i*(n - i) to the total transitions sum.\n\nTherefore, the total transitions sum is the sum over all transition positions i of (i*(n - i)), and the total awesomeness is that sum plus the number of subarrays (since each subarray contributes 1 for the base awesomeness + transitions).\n\nWait, the total awesomeness is sum over all subarrays (transitions_in_subarray + 1) = total_transitions + (number_of_subarrays).\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum over all transitions (their contribution) plus (n(n+1)/2).\n\nTherefore, the algorithm should be:\n\nCompute the initial array's transitions, compute their contributions, then the total is sum_contributions + n*(n+1)/2.\n\nNow, the problem is to manage this efficiently when updates happen.\n\nEach query changes a single element. We need to recompute the transitions and their contributions efficiently.\n\nThe main challenge is handling the transitions when an element is changed. The change can affect transitions at the previous element (i-1 and i), and next element (i and i+1), where i is the position being updated.\n\nSo, for example, if we update position p (1-based?), then transitions at p-1 and p need to be checked. Because the transition between p-1 and p depends on the previous p-1 and p values, as well as the new p's value. Similarly, the transition between p and p+1 also depends on p's new value.\n\nTherefore, the approach would be:\n\n- Maintain an array that records all the transition positions (i where a[i] != a[i+1]).\n\n- For each query, when we change a[i], we need to check transitions at i-1 and i (assuming the elements are 1-based here, or 0-based? The problem says the input is 1-based for the queries (since queries are given as 1-based i). Let me see the code: the code uses arr[p-1] = x, so the array is 0-based in the code. So the position is p in the input (1-based), stored as arr[p-1] (0-based).\n\nTherefore, when updating the position p (input's 1-based, so 0-based index is pos = p-1):\n\nCheck transitions at pos-1 (if pos>0) and at pos (if pos <n-1). For each of those positions (i in 0-based?), check whether they were transitions before and after the update. So:\n\nFor the position pos-1 (previous to the updated position):\n\nBefore the update, the transition between (pos-1) and pos was (arr[pos-1] != arr[pos]). After the update, it's (new_arr[pos-1] != arr[pos] ?)\n\nSimilarly for the next position pos and pos+1.\n\nWait, the transitions are between adjacent elements, so each transition is between (i and i+1) in 0-based indices.\n\nThus, for the update at index pos (0-based):\n\nTransition between (pos-1) and pos may change.\n\nTransition between pos and pos+1 may change.\n\nAdditionally, transitions at either end (if pos is 0, then only pos and pos+1; if pos is n-1 then only pos-1 and pos).\n\nSo when an update happens, the transitions that could be affected are:\n\n- between pos and pos+1 (if pos is not the last element).\n\n- between pos-1 and pos (if pos is not the first element).\n\nSo the steps after an update are:\n\n1. For each of the transitions that could be affected (those two), we need to:\n\n   a. Check whether they were transitions before the change.\n\n   b. Check whether they are transitions after the change.\n\n   c. Update the total contribution of those transitions accordingly.\n\nSo the idea is to track all transitions and their contributions, then when a transition is removed (or added), we subtract or add their contribution to the total.\n\nThus, the data structure needed is:\n\n- A list or array indicating for each i (0-based up to n-2) whether there is a transition at i.\n\n- The total transitions contribution sum can be stored as a variable, say total_trans. Then the total awesomeness is total_trans + (n*(n+1)/2).\n\nSo, the initial steps would be:\n\nInitialize the transitions array (trans) where trans[i] is 1 if a[i] != a[i+1] else 0, for 0<=i <n-1.\n\nCompute the total_trans as sum over i from 0 to n-2 of ( (i+1) * (n - (i+1)) ) * trans[i].\n\nWait, wait. Let's clarify the indices again. Because the contribution for a transition at 0-based position i (between elements i and i+1) is (i+1) * (n - (i+1)), since in 1-based terms, the position is i+1. For example, in 1-based terms, the transition between 1 and 2 is at position 1, so the contribution is 1*(n-1). In 0-based terms, i=0 gives the same.\n\nSo the contribution for a transition at position i (0-based) is (i+1) * (n - (i+1)).\n\nThus, total_trans is sum over all i from 0 to n-2 of (trans[i] * (i+1)*(n - (i+1))).\n\nTherefore, the initial code should be initialized as:\n\nInitialize trans array.\n\ntotal_trans = 0.\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-2:\n\n    if a[i] != a[i+1], add (i+1)*(n - (i+1)) to total_trans.\n\nThe total sum is total_trans + n*(n+1)/2.\n\nThe problem is, how to efficiently update this when a change occurs.\n\nSo the steps for handling a query:\n\nLet's say we are updating position pos (0-based).\n\nFirst, we need to:\n\n1. Save the current value of a[pos], so that we can compare before and after changes.\n\nThen, we compute the new value x, and set a[pos] = x.\n\nNow, we have to check transitions at pos-1 and pos (if they exist). For each of these positions (i), we need to check if the transition status (trans[i] before and after) has changed.\n\nFor example, consider transition at i = pos-1 (if pos-1 >=0).\n\nCompute whether before the change, there was a transition here (trans[i] was 1?), and after the change, what is it now.\n\nSame for transition at i = pos (if pos < n-1).\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nOriginal value: old_val = arr[pos]\n\nSet new_val = x.\n\nNow, for each transition that could be affected:\n\nFirst, handle the transition before pos (i=pos-1):\n\nif pos >0:\n\n   old_trans_i = trans[pos-1]\n\n   new_trans_i = (arr[pos-1] != new_val)\n\n   if old_trans_i != new_trans_i:\n\n      delta = (new_trans_i - old_trans_i) * ( ( (pos) ) * (n - (pos)) )\n\n      total_trans += delta\n\nWait, the contribution for transition at position i=pos-1 (0-based) is (i+1) * (n - (i+1)). Since i is pos-1:\n\ni+1 = (pos-1)+1 = pos.\n\nSo the contribution is pos * (n - pos).\n\nWait yes.\n\nSo the code for pos-1 transition:\n\nif (pos >0):\n\n   current_i = pos-1\n\n   prev_val = arr[pos-1]\n\n   new_val = arr[pos-1]  ??? Wait no, wait after the update, the new_val is x at position pos.\n\nWait, the transition at pos-1 (i=pos-1) is between element i and i+1 (i.e., between (pos-1) and pos).\n\nBefore the change:\n\nThe elements are arr[pos-1] (before the update?), no. Wait, the original value at pos was old_val, but when we set arr[pos] to new_val, the transition at pos-1 (i=pos-1) is between arr[pos-1] (which hasn't changed) and the new_val (x).\n\nWait in the code:\n\nold_val was arr[pos] before the update.\n\nSo, before the update, for transition i=pos-1, the elements are arr[pos-1] (old) and arr[pos] (old_val).\n\nAfter the update, the elements are arr[pos-1] (still old) and new_val (x). So the new transition here is (arr[pos-1] != x) ?\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the transition at i=pos-1 (the one before the position being changed), we need to compare before and after:\n\nold_trans_i was (arr[pos-1] != arr[pos] (old_val)).\n\nnew_trans_i is (arr[pos-1] != new_val).\n\nIf they differ, then the contribution for that transition needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo the contribution for this transition is (i+1)*(n - (i+1)) = pos * (n - pos).\n\nThe delta is (new_trans_i - old_trans_i) multiplied by that contribution.\n\nThus, the code steps:\n\nprev_i = pos-1\n\nif prev_i >=0:\n\n    old_trans_prev = (arr[prev_i] != old_val) ? 1 : 0;\n\n    new_trans_prev = (arr[prev_i] != new_val) ? 1 : 0;\n\n    delta_prev = (new_trans_prev - old_trans_prev) * ( (prev_i +1) * (n - (prev_i +1)) )\n\n    total_trans += delta_prev\n\n    trans[prev_i] = new_trans_prev ? 1 : 0;  // update the trans array.\n\nSimilarly, for the transition at i=pos (if pos < n-1):\n\nnext_i = pos\n\nnext_i is between pos and pos+1.\n\nOld value of next_i's transition was (old_val != arr[pos+1]).\n\nNew is (new_val != arr[pos+1]).\n\nSo:\n\nif (pos < n-1):\n\n    old_trans_next = (old_val != arr[pos+1]) ? 1 :0;\n\n    new_trans_next = (new_val != arr[pos+1]) ?1:0;\n\n    delta_next = (new_trans_next - old_trans_next) * ( (next_i +1) * (n - (next_i +1) ) )\n\n    total_trans += delta_next\n\n    trans[next_i] = new_trans_next ? 1 :0\n\nWait, but also, there's another transition to check if the current position is between itself and the next, but the code above handles that.\n\nWait, that covers transitions at pos-1 and pos.\n\nBut we also have to consider transitions at other positions? Like, for example, if the previous element (pos-2) was equal to the current's old value, then changing the current may cause that transition between pos-2 and pos-1 to change. Wait no, that's not the case. The transition between pos-2 and pos-1 is only affected if the value at pos-2 or pos-1 changes. But in this case, the value at pos-1 (arr[pos-1]) hasn't changed (only the current pos was updated). So those transitions are unaffected except for the ones directly adjacent to the changed position.\n\nThus, only the transitions at pos-1 and pos (the ones adjacent to the changed position) can be affected. Hence, the code only needs to check those two transitions.\n\nWait, but wait, perhaps when changing the current position, it could also affect transitions before pos-1. For example, suppose:\n\nprevious elements were [a, b, c], and we change the third element (pos=2 (0-based)) from c to b. Then the transition between 1 and 2 (pos=1) would now be between b and b (so no transition), which was previously between b and c. So this transition's status changed. So in this case, changing the third element affects the transition between pos-1 and pos (pos is 2, so transition at pos-1 is 1).\n\nAh right, so the transitions at pos-1 and the transition at pos (if applicable) are the only ones affected. So the code is correct in only checking those two transitions.\n\nWait, but in the example I mentioned, the transition between pos-1 and pos (pos-1 is 1) would have changed. So that's already covered in the code above.\n\nYes, so the code needs to handle those two transitions.\n\nWait, so the steps for handling the query are:\n\n1. Save the old value of arr[pos], since we need to compare before and after.\n\n2. Compute the delta for the transitions at prev_i and next_i.\n\n3. Update the total_trans by those deltas.\n\n4. Then, update arr[pos] to the new value.\n\nWait, no. Wait in the code above, when calculating the transitions, the new_val is the new x. So when you compute new_trans_prev, you need the new value of arr[pos], but when calculating the delta, you have to use the new value. So the code must first compute the delta, then update the arr[pos]. Wait no, because in the code that's written, the arr is being set after the computation. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the code in the problem's initial code is:\n\nafter checking, it does arr[p-1] = x at the end of the loop.\n\nSo in the code's current structure (the problem's code), the actual value is changed only after calculating.\n\nWait, in the given code's query handling:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == x) { ... } \n\nelse { ... do various computations ... }\n\ncout << sum << endl;\n\narr[p-1] = x;\n\nThus, the arr is only updated after processing the query. So in our code, when we compute the old_val and new_val (x), the arr[pos] is still the old value. So for the transitions involving pos (the updated position), we can compute the new transitions based on the new x value.\n\nTherefore, the steps for handling the query are correct in that way.\n\nPutting it all together, the correct approach would be:\n\nInitialize the transitions array and total_trans as above.\n\nFor each query:\n\n- get the index (pos = i-1, 0-based) and new x.\n\n- if the new x is same as old value, do nothing, output the current total.\n\nElse:\n\n- compute old_val = arr[pos]\n\n- compute the transitions at pos-1 and pos (if they exist).\n\n- for each of those transitions:\n\n   compute old transition status (before the change)\n\n   compute new transition status (after the change)\n\n   compute delta based on (new - old) multiplied by the contribution of the transition.\n\n   add delta to total_trans.\n\n- also, after handling the transitions, need to check whether any transitions further away were affected? No, only the two transitions.\n\nWait, but there might be a case where a transition further away is affected. Wait, no, only the transitions at pos-1 and pos can be affected, because those are the only transitions adjacent to the changed element.\n\nTherefore, after handling those two transitions, set arr[pos] to x, and then output total_trans + (n*(n+1)/2).\n\nWait, but the code's logic in the problem's code is using 'sum' which is probably supposed to be total_trans plus the number of subarrays. So in the code's variables, perhaps the total is stored as 'sum', which is total_trans + (n*(n+1)/2).\n\nTherefore, in the problem's code, the initial 'sum' is computed as the total, but that part might be wrong.\n\nLooking at the problem's code's initial setup:\n\nThe initial code in the problem has:\n\nans = 1;\n\nsum =1;\n\nThen for each element after first:\n\nif they are different, ans is updated somehow, and sum += ans. This seems incorrect.\n\nWait, the initial code's approach is wrong. The problem's code's initial part is wrong. So the user provided code is incorrect and needs to be rewritten based on the correct approach.\n\nSo the code must be completely restructured. So the correct approach is:\n\nWe need to track transitions between each pair of adjacent elements.\n\nWe can represent transitions as an array trans of size n-1, where trans[i] is 1 if a[i] != a[i+1], else 0.\n\nThe total transitions contribution is the sum over all i of trans[i] * ( (i+1) * (n - (i+1)) )\n\nThe total answer is this sum plus n*(n+1)/2.\n\nThe problem's code completely ignores this structure and uses a wrong initial approach. So the code needs to be rewritten.\n\nHence, my task is to write the correct code from scratch according to the correct approach.\n\nSo let's plan the code steps:\n\nIn the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the array a (0-based).\n\nInitialize the transitions array:\n\nvector<bool> trans(n-1, 0);\n\nfor (int i=0; i < n-1; i++) {\n\n    trans[i] = (a[i] != a[i+1]);\n\n}\n\nCompute total_trans:\n\nll total_trans = 0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i < n-1; i++) {\n\n    if (trans[i]) {\n\n        int pos = i+1; // in 1-based terms, the position between i and i+1 is (i+1)\n\n        total_trans += (pos) * (n - pos);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe total is:\n\nll total = total_trans + (n * (n+1))/2;\n\nThen, for each query:\n\nRead p and x (1-based p, so pos = p-1).\n\nif (a[pos] == x) {\n\n    cout << total << endl;\n\n    continue;\n\n}\n\nElse:\n\nold_val = a[pos];\n\na[pos] = x; // Wait, no, first we need to compute the effect before changing.\n\nWait, no, in code, we need to first compute the effect, then change the array.\n\nWait, the steps should be:\n\nint pos = p-1;\n\nold_val = a[pos];\n\nif (old_val == x) {\n\n    ... same as before\n\n}\n\nElse:\n\n    // Compute the changes\n\n    // Need to track all transitions that may change.\n\n    // For transitions at pos-1 and pos.\n\n    ll delta = 0;\n\n    // first, check transition at pos-1 (if pos >0):\n\n    if (pos >0) {\n\n        int i = pos-1; // the transition between i and i+1 (which is pos)\n\n        bool old_t = trans[i]; // previous transition status.\n\n        // new transition is (a[i] != new_val (x)) ?\n\n        bool new_t = (a[i] != x);\n\n        // compute delta for this transition.\n\n        int contrib = (i+1) * (n - (i+1));\n\n        delta += (new_t ? 1 :0 - old_t) * contrib;\n\n        // update trans[i]\n\n        trans[i] = new_t;\n\n    }\n\n    // next, check transition at pos (if pos < n-1):\n\n    if (pos < n-1) {\n\n        int i = pos; // between pos and pos+1 (i+1 is pos+1)\n\n        bool old_t = trans[i]; // old transition (old_val vs a[pos+1])\n\n        bool new_t = (x != a[pos+1]);\n\n        int contrib = (i+1) * (n - (i+1));\n\n        delta += (new_t ?1:0 - old_t) * contrib;\n\n        trans[i] = new_t;\n\n    }\n\n    // also, check the transition at pos and pos+1? Wait, the second part handles that.\n\n    // Now, apply the delta to total_trans.\n\n    total_trans += delta;\n\n    // Also, need to check the transition at pos and pos+1.\n\n    // Wait, the code above covers it.\n\n    // Now, the array's value is to be set to x.\n\n    a[pos] = x;\n\n    // Update the total.\n\n    total = total_trans + (n*(n+1))/2;\n\n    cout << total << endl;\n\nWait, but wait, in the code above, when we compute the transitions, the new_t for the first part (pos-1) uses the new x (the new value of a[pos])? No, because in the code above, the a[pos] hasn't been updated yet. Because in the code above, the 'a[pos] =x' is done after the delta computation. Wait no, in this code:\n\nWait, in the code outline above, the steps are:\n\nFirst, compute old_val = a[pos], then, when calculating the new transitions, the new_val is x.\n\nBut in the code's loops:\n\nFor the transition at i=pos-1 (between pos-1 and pos):\n\nthe previous a[pos] (before change) is old_val. So the old transition (before the change) is (a[i] != old_val).\n\nThe new transition is (a[i] (unchanged) vs new_val x).\n\nThus, the code above is correct in using x here.\n\nSimilarly, for the transition at i=pos (between pos and pos+1):\n\nthe old transition was between old_val and a[pos+1].\n\nThe new transition is between x and a[pos+1].\n\nSo the code's logic is correct.\n\nWait but in the code above, when calculating the transition at pos (i=pos):\n\ntrans[i] was stored as (a[i] != a[i+1]). However, before the position's value was changed, so a[i] is still the old value here.\n\nWait, in code:\n\nold_t = trans[i] which was computed as (a[i] != a[i+1]) before any changes. But the trans array hasn't been updated yet. Wait, the trans array is only updated after computing new_t.\n\nWait the code above does:\n\nbool new_t = (x != a[pos+1]); // since pos is the i (the index) here.\n\nWait, the a[pos+1] hasn't been changed, so yes.\n\nThus, the code would correctly compute new_t as (x vs a[pos+1]).\n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct.\n\nWait but in the code:\n\nWait in the transition at pos (i=pos):\n\nthe previous transition was trans[i] = (a[pos] (old_val) != a[pos+1]).\n\nnew_t is (x != a[pos+1].\n\nThus, the code correctly captures the old and new transitions.\n\nTherefore, after computing delta, we need to update the trans array (trans[i] = new_t).\n\nHence, this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's see the original code given. The provided code is completely different. The user wants us to complete the code as given. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"You will be given code with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\nThe user provided code has some code with comments like \"TODO\" in it, so the task is to complete that code, not to write a new code from scratch.\n\nHmm. So I need to look back at the given code and see where it can be fixed with the correct approach.\n\nLooking at the original code provided:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nint main() {\n\n    ... \n\n    in the loop:\n\n    int n, q;\n\n    cin >> n >> q;\n\n    ll arr[n]; \n\n    ll ans = 1;\n\n    ll sum = 1;\n\n    for (ll i =0; i <n; i++){\n\n        cin >> arr[i];\n\n        if (i>0) {\n\n            bool flag = arr[i] != arr[i-1];\n\n            ans = 1ll * flag * i + ans + 1;\n\n            sum += ans;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nWait this is clearly wrong. Let me see:\n\nIn the loop, for each i>0, they set flag to whether current is different from previous. Then they compute ans as flag *i + ans +1.\n\nWait this seems to be trying to compute something like the awesomeness of the entire array up to that point, but the formula is unclear. Let me see with the sample input.\n\nSample input after first query is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\nThe code would process the array elements:\n\ni=0: arr[0] =1, no changes to ans or sum.\n\ni=1:\n\nflag = 2 !=1 \u2192 true.\n\nans = flag *1 (i=1) + ans (1) +1 \u2192 1 *1 +1 +1 =3?\n\nsum += ans \u2192 sum was 1 becomes 4?\n\nHmm, but the sample's initial array (before any queries?) is not given, but the first query changes element 1 (assuming 1-based) to 1?\n\nWait the note says after the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5], and the answer is 29.\n\nBut the original code's initial setup is probably incorrect. So the original code's approach is wrong, and the problem is to fix it by completing the code with the correct approach. But given the code structure, perhaps we need to adjust it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial code is trying to compute the sum for all subarrays as some formula, but it's incorrect and needs to be reworked using the transitions approach.\n\nGiven that the problem says \"output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly\", and the code provided has a TODO in the else block for the query processing. So perhaps the code uses some other approach, but the TODO is there.\n\nWait looking at the user's code's query loop:\n\nInside the else clause (when the value changes):\n\nif (p-1 >0) { // previous exists\n\n    if (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) {\n\n        ll rem =n - (p-1);\n\n        sum += rem * (p-1);\n\n    } else if (x == arr[p-2]) {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (p <n) {\n\n    if (arr[p-1] == arr[p]) {\n\n        ll rem =n -p;\n\n        sum += rem *p;\n\n    } else if (x == arr[p]) {\n\n        ll rem =n -p;\n\n        sum -= rem *p;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\ncout << sum << endl;\n\narr[p-1] =x;\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code's initial approach is perhaps trying to track some contributions, but the logic is unclear.\n\nPerhaps the initial code is trying to calculate something similar to the transitions approach but in a different way. Let's think:\n\nIn the code's initial setup, the 'sum' is computed as follows:\n\nInitially, sum is set to 1. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\nans is set to flag *i + ans +1. Where flag is arr[i] != arr[i-1].\n\nWait, let's see with the first sample after the first query (array [1,2,2,4,5], but maybe in the original code the initial array is different).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's 'ans' variable is the current awesomeness of the entire array? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial code is attempting to compute the sum of all subarrays' awesomeness by considering the transitions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the sum as follows:\n\nFor each position i, the contribution to the total sum is the number of subarrays where this position is a transition point. So each transition at position i contributes (i)*(n -i), which is the same as the correct approach.\n\nIn that case, the initial code's sum is trying to compute that, but it's doing it wrong.\n\nThe original code's for loop:\n\nfor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif i>0, compute flag (whether different from previous).\n\nThen ans is set as flag *i + ans +1.\n\nWait, perhaps ans is the current awesomeness for the entire array up to i?\n\nWait for example, when the array is [1,1], then for i=1 (second element), flag is false. So ans = 0*1 + previous ans +1. Previous ans was for the first element (i=0), which was 1. So ans would be 0*1 +1 +1= 2? But the awesomeness of [1,1] is 1, so that's not correct.\n\nHmm, this approach is wrong. So the code as written is incorrect. The user's code's initial approach is wrong, so the solution needs to be completed by replacing parts of the code with the correct approach.\n\nBut given the problem's instructions, I have to fill in the missing parts (the TODO and wherever else needed) in the provided code, to make it work correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be fixed by changing the initial calculations and the query handling.\n\nLooking at the code's query part:\n\nThe else clause (when the value changes) has two parts:\n\nFirst, checking the previous elements (p-1 and p-2):\n\nif the previous element (p-1) was equal to p-2 (the element before it), then when changing p-1's value (since the query is changing position p, which in 0-based is p-1?), then the transition between p-2 and p-1 is now different.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused with the indices. Let me see:\n\nThe code's p is the 1-based index, so in 0-based it's pos = p-1.\n\nThe code's first condition is:\n\nif (p-1>0) \u2192 p-1 is the 0-based position. (p-1>0) means that the current position is not the first element.\n\nThen the code checks if arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]. The arr[p-2] is the element before the current (since p-1 is the current index). So if before the update, the previous element (p-2) was same as current (p-1) (which is being changed), then changing the current's value may split or merge transitions.\n\nThe code then computes rem = n - (p-1), which is the number of elements after and including p-1?\n\nWait, the code's first block:\n\nif (arr[p-1] (before change) == arr[p-2]) {\n\n   rem = n - (p-1); \n\n   sum += rem * (p-1);\n\n}\n\nHmm, perhaps this is trying to account for removing a transition that was previously not present. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this code is trying to compute the delta caused by changing the element at position p-1.\n\nThe code's logic in the first block (previous exist) is handling the transition before the changed position.\n\nThe code seems to be making some adjustments to the sum, but the approach is not clear.\n\nThe TODO is in the else if (x == arr[p-2]) case. So when the new x is the same as the element before (p-2), which was previously different from the old value of the current (p-1).\n\nSo in that case, perhaps a new transition is removed?\n\nBut the code is incomplete there.\n\nThe problem is that without knowing the correct approach, it's hard to fill in the missing code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended approach is to track for each position, the start and end of runs of the same number, and compute the contributions accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is the transitions approach I thought of earlier, and the given code is an attempt to implement that but is missing parts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given code is attempting to track the contribution of each position's transitions and handle them in the query.\n\nLet me try to think of the code's current structure and how to fix it.\n\nOriginal code's initial setup:\n\nThe sum is being computed in a wrong way. The code's initial sum is the total of all subarrays' awesomeness. The correct approach is to compute the transitions' contributions as I explained.\n\nPerhaps the code's 'sum' variable is supposed to hold the total (transitions contribution + number of subarrays).\n\nSo, to fix this, the initial code must compute transitions and their contributions.\n\nThe problem's code's initial sum is incorrect, so we need to change that.\n\nBut since we can only fill in the missing parts (the TODO and other parts?), perhaps the code is structured to handle the transitions in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the initial code's loop, the 'ans' is trying to compute something else, but it's too wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be transformed into the transitions approach, but given the problem's instruction to only fill in the missing parts, I need to see where the code is incomplete.\n\nIn the code's query handling, the first part of the else clause (when changing the value) is checking previous elements. The code's first 'if' in the else block is:\n\nif (p-1 >0) { // previous exist\n\n    if (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) {\n\n        ll rem =n - (p-1);\n\n        sum += rem * (p-1);\n\n    }\n\n    else if (x == arr[p-2]) {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo this is handling the transition between p-2 and p-1 (0-based: positions (p-2) and (p-1)), which is the previous transition to the changed position.\n\nSuppose that before the change, the previous elements (p-2 and p-1) were same. Now, changing p-1's value (to x) may affect that transition.\n\nWait, the code's first condition:\n\nIf the previous elements (arr[p-2] and arr[p-1], which is the value before the change) are the same, then changing arr[p-1] to x (new value) would:\n\nIf x == arr[p-2], then the transition between p-2 and p-1 remains the same (no transition). So the transition there was not present before (since they were same), and remains same. So no change?\n\nWait, but the code's code in the first case (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) is adding rem*(p-1) to sum.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is the case where before the change, there was no transition between p-2 and p-1. After the change, if x is different from arr[p-2], then a new transition is added here, thus increasing the total transitions contribution.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to account for the delta in the contribution for that transition.\n\nFor the transition between (p-2) and (p-1) (0-based):\n\nOld value:\n\nif arr[p-2] == arr[p-1 (old value)] \u2192 no transition.\n\nAfter change, the new arr[p-1] is x. So the new transition is (arr[p-2] != x).\n\nSo the delta is (new - old) which is (1 if transition now exists, else 0) minus 0 (since old was no transition).\n\nThe contribution of this transition is ( (p-1)'s 1-based position is (p-1) \u2192 ? Wait, in 1-based terms, between positions (p-2 +1) and (p-1 +1) \u2192 (p-1 and p). Wait maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait the transition between p-2 (0-based index) and p-1 (0-based) is between positions (p-1 and p) in 1-based terms (since 0-based to 1-based is add 1). The contribution for this transition is pos*(n - pos), where pos is the 1-based position of the transition. The transition between indices i and i+1 (0-based) has 1-based position (i+1).\n\nSo for the transition between (p-2) and (p-1) (0-based), its contribution is (p-1) * (n - (p-1)).\n\nSo the delta for this transition is:\n\nif after the change, there is a transition (arr[p-2] != x), then delta += 1 * ( (p-1) * (n - (p-1)) )\n\nelse delta -= 0.\n\nBut in the first case (old had no transition, new has transition), delta is + contribution.\n\nIn the first case of the code (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2] (old)), and the new value x is different from arr[p-2], then the transition is added. So the delta is + ( (p-1)*(n - (p-1)) ).\n\nThe code's first case seems to be when the old had no transition (arr[p-2] == arr[p-1] (old value)), so the delta is added when the new has transition (x != arr[p-2]). But the code's first condition is adding rem*(p-1) when the old had no transition. The code's code adds this, which would correspond to the case where a transition is added here.\n\nBut the code's first condition is when the old had no transition (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]), and then:\n\nthe code adds rem*(p-1) to sum. rem is n - (p-1). \n\nBut (p-1)*(n - (p-1)) is the contribution of that transition. So the code is adding that when the transition is added. That makes sense.\n\nHowever, what if the new value x is same as arr[p-2], then the transition remains unchanged (no transition), so delta is 0. Thus, the first condition's first case (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) is when old had no transition. So if the new x is same as arr[p-2], then the transition is still no transition. So no delta.\n\nThus, the code's first case is correct.\n\nThe second condition in the first block is 'else if (x == arr[p-2])'.\n\nThis case is when the old transition was not present (because arr[p-1] == arr[p-2] was false?), which would not be in this case. Wait, no, the condition is 'else if (x == arr[p-2])' in the case where the first condition (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) is false.\n\nWait the first part of the first block is:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) \u2192 old no transition \u2192 then handle adding transition if needed.\n\nelse \u2192 old had transition between p-2 and p-1.\n\nThen the 'else if (x == arr[p-2])' is when the new x equals arr[p-2], making the new transition between p-2 and p-1 to be no transition.\n\nThus, in this case, the transition is removed.\n\nSo the delta is - contribution (since old had 1, new has 0).\n\nThus, the code should subtract the contribution for this transition.\n\nSo the code's second case needs to subtract that contribution.\n\nThus, the TODO here should be:\n\nsum -= (p-1)*(n - (p-1));\n\nSimilarly, the code should.\n\nSo the TODO is:\n\nelse if (x == arr[p-2]) {\n\n    ll contribution = (p-1) * (n - (p-1));\n\n    sum -= contribution;\n\n}\n\nWait, because the old transition was present (since the first condition's 'arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]' was false), so old had a transition of 1. Now, new transition is 0 (since x == arr[p-2]).\n\nThus, delta is -1 * contribution \u2192 sum -= contribution.\n\nSo that's the code needed for the TODO.\n\nThen, the code proceeds.\n\nNow, the next part of the code's else clause is:\n\nif (p <n) { \n\n    if (arr[p-1] == arr[p]) { \n\n        ll rem =n -p;\n\n        sum += rem *p;\n\n    }\n\n    else if (x == arr[p]) {\n\n        ll rem =n-p;\n\n        sum -= rem *p;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis is handling the transition between the current position and the next (p in 1-based is pos+1 in 0-based).\n\nWait, the current position is p-1 (0-based). The next element is p (0-based) (since p is 1-based).\n\nSo transition between (p-1 and p) (0-based).\n\nThe code is checking for the old transition between them (before the update):\n\nthe old value of arr[p-1] is the previous value, and the next element is arr[p].\n\nIf they were equal before, then the transition was 0 (no transition). After the change, the new value is x. So new transition is (x != arr[p]).\n\nIn the first case of this block:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == arr[p]) \u2192 old transition was no.\n\nThen, if after the change, the new value x equals arr[p], then the transition remains no \u2192 no change.\n\nElse, the transition is added (so delta is + contribution).\n\nThus, the first condition\u2019s code adds rem*p to sum. rem is (n-p) \u2192 the contribution is p*(n-p) [since contribution is (p (1-based) )*(n - p)] \u2192 yes, because for transition between 0-based indices (p-1 and p), the 1-based position is p+1? Wait wait:\n\nWait the transition between (p-1 and p) (0-based) has a 1-based position of (p) \u2192 since 0-based to 1-based is adding 1. So between indices (p-1) and p, the transition's position is p (1-based). Thus the contribution is p * (n - p).\n\nSo the rem is (n-p) \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, the first condition is when the old transition was no (they were equal). The code adds rem*p when the transition is added.\n\nWait the code's first case:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == arr[p]) \u2192 old transition was no.\n\nThen what happens after the update:\n\nnew value is x. The next element is arr[p].\n\nSo the new transition is (x != arr[p]).\n\nThus, if after the change, there is a transition (x != arr[p]), then delta is + contribution (since old was 0, new is 1).\n\nThus the code adds contribution (p*(n-p)), which is correct.\n\nThe second condition is else if (x == arr[p]). \n\nThis case is when the old transition was present (since we are in the else clause of the first condition).\n\nThus old transition between (p-1 and p) (0-based) was present (since arr[p-1] (old value) != arr[p]).\n\nThe new value x now equals arr[p], so transition is removed.\n\nThus, delta is - contribution \u2192 subtract contribution.\n\nHence the code's second condition's code subtracts rem*p = p*(n-p).\n\nThus the code is correct for this part.\n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code in the TODO is:\n\nelse if (x == arr[p-2]) { \n\n    ll contribution = (p-1) * (n - (p-1));\n\n    sum -= contribution;\n\n}\n\nSo that's the code needed there.\n\nBut also, what about other cases where the transition between p-2 and p-1 changes in other ways?\n\nLike, the second condition covers when the old transition was present (because the first condition failed) and new transition is not.\n\nThere's another case where new transition is added (when x != arr[p-2], and the old transition was not present).\n\nWait the first condition's first case:\n\nif (arr[p-1] == arr[p-2]) (old no transition) \u2192 then after update, if x != arr[p-2], then the transition is added \u2192 so the code's first case is adding the contribution, which is correct.\n\nBut what if after the change, the new transition is added? The code's first case does that.\n\nBut if the new value x is not equal to arr[p-2], then the transition is added, and the code's first case adds the contribution.\n\nThus, the first case handles that.\n\nThe second case (else if) handles when the new value makes the transition go away (from old present to new not).\n\nOther cases: what if the old transition was present (so first case's condition is false) and new transition also remains present?\n\nThen delta is zero, so no change to sum. Which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, if old transition was absent but new transition also absent \u2192 no change.\n\nThus, the current code's first block handles the transition between (p-2 and p-1) (prev to current) correctly.\n\nThus, the missing code is only the TODO line.\n\nBut also, there is the transition between the current position and the next. The second block handles it correctly as per the code's existing conditions.\n\nThus, the only missing code is the TODO part.\n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nelse if (x == arr[p-2]) {\n\n    sum -= (p-1)*(n - (p-1));\n\n}\n\nThus, this completes the code.\n\nTesting this with the sample input:\n\nSample after first query: the array is [1,2,2,4,5].\n\nLet's see when the first query is processed. The initial array before any queries is not given, but the first query is probably changing some element.\n\nWait the note says after the first query, the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. So the initial array must have been different.\n\nAssume the first query is i=2 (1-based), x=2. Suppose the initial array was [1,1,2,4,5].\n\nThe change at position 2 (0-based index 1) from 1 to 2.\n\nThen, the code will process that.\n\nBut the initial sum calculation would be based on transitions between elements.\n\nBut the code's initial setup is wrong, so perhaps the code won't work unless the initial setup is fixed. \n\nWait the initial code's sum is computed incorrectly, so the code as a whole won't work unless the initial setup is fixed. But the problem's instructions say to output only the missing code. The initial sum setup is outside of what's asked (the TODO is in the query processing). So perhaps the initial code's setup is correct for the problem's given code, but I might have misunderstood.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the given code's initial calculation is correct, but I need to see.\n\nThe code's initial loop:\n\nsum starts at 1.\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n    bool flag = arr[i] != arr[i-1]\n\n    ans = 1ll * flag * i + ans + 1\n\n    sum += ans\n\nWait, let's see for the array [1,2,2,4,5].\n\nn=5.\n\nInitial setup:\n\ni=0: no changes to sum or ans.\n\ni=1 (second element, value 2).\n\nflag = true (2 !=1).\n\nans = (1 *1) + 1 (previous ans was 1) +1 \u2192 1+1+1=3?\n\nsum += ans (3 \u2192 sum is 1+3=4).\n\ni=2 (third element, 2):\n\nflag = false (2 ==2).\n\nans = 0*2 + 3 (previous ans) +1 \u2192 0 +3 +1 =4.\n\nsum +=4 \u2192 sum is 8.\n\ni=3 (4):\n\nflag = true (4 !=2).\n\nans = 1*3 (i=3) + previous ans (4) +1 \u21923+4+1=8.\n\nsum +=8 \u2192 16.\n\ni=4 (5):\n\nflag = true (5 !=4).\n\nans =1*4 (i=4) +8 (previous ans) +1 \u21924+8+1=13.\n\nsum +=13 \u2192 total sum 29, which matches the sample's answer.\n\nAh! So the initial code's approach is correct for the sample. So the initial code's sum is computed correctly. \n\nThis suggests that the code's initial approach is correct, and the problem is only in filling the missing parts of the query handling.\n\nThus, the initial code's approach must be different from the transitions approach I thought of earlier, but it somehow works.\n\nSo let's see how the initial code's approach works.\n\nThe initial code's 'ans' and 'sum' variables:\n\nThe 'ans' variable for each i seems to represent the awesomeness of the entire array up to i. Or perhaps the awesomeness of the array from the first element to i.\n\nBecause for the sample array's first three elements [1,2,2], the awesomeness is 2. The code's calculation for i=2 (third element):\n\nflag is false.\n\nans = 0*2 + previous ans (3 from i=1) +1 \u2192 0+3+1=4? but the awesomeness of the entire array up to index 2 is 2 (split into [1], [2,2]). So this doesn't make sense.\n\nWait perhaps the 'ans' variable is something else.\n\nAlternatively, the 'ans' variable could be the awesomeness of the entire array up to i (the first i+1 elements). For the sample array's first two elements [1,2], the awesomeness is 2.\n\nThe code's ans after i=1 (second element) is 3, which is not correct.\n\nHmm, but in the sample's initial setup, after the first query (changing an element), the sum is 29, which matches the sample. So the code's initial approach must be correct.\n\nTherefore, there must be a different way to compute the sum of awesomeness of all subarrays.\n\nThe initial code's approach:\n\nThe 'sum' is computed as the sum of ans for each i from 0 to n-1.\n\nThe ans for each i is computed as flag *i + ans_prev +1.\n\nWhere flag is whether current element differs from previous.\n\nLet me try to see what ans represents.\n\nLet me see the sample:\n\narray is [1,2,2,4,5].\n\nThe sum after initialization is 29.\n\nThe sum is the sum of ans for each i:\n\nFor i=0:\n\nans is initialized to 1. So the first element contributes 1 to the total.\n\ni=1 (second element 2):\n\nflag is true.\n\nans = (1 *1) + 1 (previous ans) +1 \u2192 1+1+1=3 \u2192 sum +=3 \u2192 total 1+3=4.\n\ni=2 (third element 2):\n\nflag is false.\n\nans = 0 *2 +3 (prev ans) +1 \u21920+3+1=4 \u2192 sum +=4 \u2192 total 8.\n\ni=3 (4):\n\nflag is true.\n\nans = 1*3 +4 (prev) +1 \u21923+4+1=8 \u2192 sum total 16.\n\ni=4 (5):\n\nflag is true.\n\nans = 1*4 +8+1=13 \u2192 total sum 29.\n\nThus, the total sum is 1+3+4+8+13 =29.\n\nThe sample's answer is 29, so this works.\n\nSo what does 'ans' represent? For each i, ans seems to be the awesomeness of the subarray from the first element up to i.\n\nIn the first case (i=0), ans is 1 (awesomeness of [1]).\n\ni=1: ans is 2 \u2192 but awesomeness of [1,2] is 2? Yes.\n\ni=2: the subarray [1,2,2] has awesomeness 2, but ans is 4. So no.\n\nHmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ans is something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'sum' is the total of the awesomeness for all subarrays ending at i.\n\nLet me think:\n\nThe sum of all subarrays' awesomeness can be computed by for each position i, the contribution of the new element to all subarrays ending at i.\n\nSuppose that for each i, we compute the contribution to all subarrays ending at i.\n\nFor example, for the current i:\n\nthe new element a[i] can form subarrays [i], [i-1,i], ..., [1..i].\n\nThe awesomeness of each of these subarrays can be computed based on the transitions.\n\nPerhaps the ans variable represents the sum of awesomeness for all subarrays ending at i.\n\nLet me see:\n\nFor the first element (i=0), ans=1 \u2192 sum of [1], which is correct.\n\nAt i=1 (element 2), the subarrays ending at 1 are [1], [1-2]. Their awesomeness are 1 and 2 \u2192 total 3, which matches the ans of 3.\n\nFor i=2 (element 2):\n\nThe subarrays ending at 2 are:\n\n[2] \u2192 1,\n\n[1-2] \u2192 2,\n\n[1-2-2] \u2192 2.\n\nTotal is 1+2+2=5. But ans is 4.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ans is the sum for all subarrays ending at i plus something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a different formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the ans stores the awesomeness of the subarray from 1 to i.\n\nWait, for i=1: the entire array's first two elements have awesomeness 2 \u2192 which matches ans=2? But the code's ans is 3.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the total sum as computed by the initial code:\n\nFor the sample, it works.\n\nSo the approach must be correct.\n\nNow, the query part must be completed.\n\nThe TODO is in the part where after changing a value, the code's sum must be updated by considering the changes caused by the update.\n\nThe code's existing parts handle the transitions between the previous and current (p-2 and p-1), and between current and next (p-1 and p).\n\nThe missing code in the TODO block handles the case where changing the current element makes the previous transition disappear (because the new value equals the previous element).\n\nThus, the TODO code should subtract the contribution of that transition.\n\nThus, the code to add there is:\n\nelse if (x == arr[p-2]) {\n\n    ll contribution = (p-1) * (n - (p-1));\n\n    sum -= contribution;\n\n}\n\nThis completes the code.\n\nHence, the missing code is as described."
