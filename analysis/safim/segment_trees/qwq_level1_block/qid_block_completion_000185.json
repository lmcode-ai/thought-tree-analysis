This makes sense. So the solution is to compute for every possible cell (row, column) the maximum distance from any chip to that cell, then take the minimum of those maxima. The distance between a chip at (r1, c1) and a target (r2, c2) is |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|. So the steps would be: \n\n1. For each test case, collect all the positions of the chips. 2. For each possible target position (r, c), compute the maximum distance from any chip to (r, c). 3. Find the minimal such maximum distance. This would give the minimal number of moves required. Now, how to compute this efficiently? The problem has n up to 2e5, so for each test case, we need an O(n) solution. The number of possible target positions is 2 * n (since two rows, n columns). For each target (r, c), we need to find the maximum distance from all chips to (r,c).",

In the first example with two chips at distance 2, the minimal maximum is 1, which is 2/2. In the three chips example (0,0), (0,3), (1,1), the pairwise distances are 3 (0-3), 2 (0-1), and 3 (3-1). The minimal pairwise distance is 2 (between first and third). The minimal maximum distance would be 2 (when choosing a point between them). Which is 2/1 = 2. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the minimal maximum distance is the minimal of the maximum between all pairs of chips divided by 2. Wait, the maximum between two chips is their distance. The minimal maximum distance would be the minimal over all pairs of (distance between them)/2. In the first example, 2/2 =1. In the three chips example, the minimal pairwise distance is 2, so 2/2 =1. But the actual minimal maximum is 2. So that doesn't work. Hmm, this is getting too stuck. Perhaps I should return to the original code and see what it's trying to do. The code uses a DP approach with states for each column. The DP[i][state] is the minimal moves to reach that state at column i. The mask is the current column's original chips. The transitions are supposed to be filled in the TODO section.",

The code has:\n\ndp[i][0b01] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b10], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b01] );\ndp[i][0b10] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b01], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b10] );\n\nThis suggests that for the current column's state 0b01 (only top has a chip), the minimal moves can be obtained by taking the minimum between its current value and the minimum of the other states (0b10 and 0b11) plus 1.",

So from (i-1,0) (top row of previous column), you can move to (i-1,1) (bottom row of previous column) in one move. But that's not part of the current column. To get to the current column's bottom row (i,1), you can move right to (i,0) then down to (i,1), which is two moves. Or down then right: (i-1,0) \u2192 (i-1,1) then \u2192 (i,1). Either way, two moves. Thus, the cost to move from previous top to current bottom is 2. Similarly, moving from previous bottom to current top is also two moves. Moving to the same row is one move. Thus, the cost between states can be computed as follows:",

The code after the loop for k has: \n\ndp[i][0b01] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b10], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b01] ); dp[i][0b10] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b01], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b10] ); \n\nThis suggests that if there are two chips in the current state (0b11), then moving one into the other's position would capture it, resulting in one chip with one move. Thus, the code is considering that from state 0b11, you can reach 0b01 or 0b10 with one move. This is why those lines are there. Thus, the complete code for the TODO section would be the loop over curr states and compute the cost as above. Putting it all together, the missing code inside the for (k) loop would be: \n\nfor (int curr = 0; curr < 4; curr++) { \n\n    if ((curr & mask) ! = mask) continue; \n\n    int cost = 0; \n\n    if ((k & 1) ! = 0) { \n\n        if ((curr & 1) ! = 0) cost += 1; \n\n        else if ((curr & 2) ! = 0) cost += 2; \n\n    } \n\n    if ((k & 2) ! = 0) { \n\n        if ((curr & 2) ! = 0) cost += 1; \n\n        else if ((curr & 1) ! = 0) cost += 2; \n\n    } \n\n    if (dp[i-1][k] + cost < dp[i][curr]) { \n\n        dp[i][curr] = dp[i-1][k] + cost; \n\n    } \n\n} This is the code that should be placed in the TODO section. Thus, the missing code is the loop over curr states and the cost calculation as above. The final code would look like this in the TODO section.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the given Java code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a 2xN board with chips ('*') and empty cells ('.'). The goal is to find the minimum number of moves required to leave exactly one chip. Each move allows moving a chip to an adjacent cell (left, right, up/down depending on the row), and when moving into a cell with another chip, that chip is captured (disappears). \n\nThe code provided is a dynamic programming approach. The DP array is 2D, where dp[i][mask] represents the minimum moves up to column i with a certain state (mask) indicating which cells in that column have chips. The mask can be 0 (no chips), 1 (top has a chip), 2 (bottom has a chip), or 3 (both have chips). But since the problem requires ending with exactly one chip, the final answer is the minimum of the last column's 0b01 and 0b10 states.\n\nLooking at the code structure, the DP is initialized, and for each column i from 1 to n, they process the current mask (based on the input) and update the DP transitions. The TODO section is where the transitions from the previous column's states to the current column's states need to be filled in.\n\nHmm, the current code has a loop over k (the previous state) and probably needs to consider transitions from each possible previous state (k) to the current possible states (current mask). Wait, but the code's structure might be a bit different. Let me think.\n\nThe mask for the current column is determined by the input (mask variable). The DP transitions would consider all possible previous states (k) and compute the transitions to the current possible states. But the code's current setup might be trying to compute transitions for each possible previous state and then update the current DP[i][new state] based on the transitions.\n\nWait, the code's loop for k is from 0 to 3 (since 4 possible states). For each previous state (k), we need to see how moving the chips from the previous column's state to the current column's state can be done, considering the current column's mask (the existing chips here). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mask here is the current column's existing chips, but the DP is tracking the state after processing up to column i, considering the moves made. Wait, maybe the mask variable here is the current column's original chips, but the DP's state is the current state after considering the moves up to this column. \n\nWait, the problem requires that after all moves, only one chip remains. The DP approach is likely tracking the possible states (which cells in the current column have chips) and the minimal moves required to reach that state. \n\nThe initial DP[0][...] is set, but the code initializes dp[0] as an array of 4 elements. Since the first column (i=1) would depend on the previous (i=0), which is the start. \n\nWait, the code starts with dp[0] as the initial state. Since the problem starts with the initial chips, perhaps the initial state (dp[0]) is all zeros except for the starting state? Or maybe the DP is built incrementally, considering each column's possible transitions.\n\nLet me think of the transitions. For each column i, the current state (mask) can be influenced by the previous column's state (k). The transitions would involve moving the chips from the previous column's positions to the current column's positions, considering the allowed moves and captures.\n\nAlternatively, the DP[i][current_mask] is the minimal moves to reach that state at column i. The transitions would consider all possible previous states (k) and compute the cost to transition to the current state (current_mask) based on the current column's mask (original chips here?), but I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the mask variable in the code is computed as the current column's existing chips. So for column i, the original chips are given by mask. But when moving chips, the current column's state can be modified by moving chips from previous columns. Hmm, perhaps the mask here is the original chips in column i, but the DP's state is the current state after considering the moves up to column i. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the mask is the current column's original chips, and the transitions must account for moving chips from the previous column's state into the current column's possible states, considering the existing chips here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP[i][state] represents the minimal moves to reach a certain state (which cells in column i have chips) considering the first i columns. The transitions would involve moving chips from the previous column's state (k) to the current column's state (current state). \n\nThe current code's loop for each i from 1 to n:\n\n- computes the mask for the current column (mask is 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the current column's original chips)\n- then for each possible previous state (k from 0 to 3), we need to compute transitions to the current possible states (current state can be 0,1,2,3?), but considering the current column's mask?\n\nWait, perhaps the mask here is the original chips in the current column. So when moving into this column, the existing chips (mask) can be part of the state. But the DP's state is the current state after processing up to column i, which may include the chips from previous moves plus the original chips here?\n\nHmm, maybe the mask is the original chips in column i, and the transitions must account for moving chips from the previous column's state into the current column's possible states, considering that the current column has some existing chips. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mask is the current column's original chips, and the DP's state is the current state (the chips present in column i after considering the moves). The transitions would need to consider moving chips from the previous column's state (k) into the current column's state (current state), and also account for the original chips in the current column. \n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of the DP transitions step by step.\n\nSuppose for each column i, the possible states are 0 (no chips), 1 (top has a chip), 2 (bottom has a chip), 3 (both have chips). The DP[i][state] is the minimal moves to reach that state at column i.\n\nThe transitions from DP[i-1][prev_state] to DP[i][curr_state] would involve moving chips from the previous column's positions to the current column's positions. \n\nEach chip in the previous column can be moved to adjacent cells in the current column. But since the board is 2 rows, moving from column i-1 to i would be moving right (since columns are in order). Wait, the columns are arranged from left to right. So moving a chip from column i-1 to column i would be moving right. \n\nWait, the movement can be in any direction, but the problem allows moving to adjacent cells. So a chip in column i-1 can move to column i (right), or left (column i-2?), but since we are processing column by column, perhaps the DP approach is considering moving from left to right, and the transitions are only considering moving from the previous column to current. \n\nAlternatively, the DP approach is considering that each step processes the current column, and the transitions are based on moving chips from the previous column's state into the current column's state. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that for each column, the chips can come from the previous column's positions, moving right, or from the current column's original chips. \n\nWait, the original chips in the current column (mask) are part of the state. So when moving into the current column, the existing chips (mask) can be part of the current state. \n\nAlternatively, the DP[i][state] represents the state after considering the first i columns, and the current state is the chips present in column i. The previous state (from column i-1) can influence how the current state is formed. \n\nLet me think of the transitions. For each previous state (prev_state) and current state (curr_state), the cost to transition from prev_state to curr_state would be the number of moves required to move the chips from the previous column's positions into the current column's positions, plus the existing chips in the current column. \n\nWait, but the existing chips in the current column (mask) are part of the initial setup. So when moving into the current column, the chips can be the original ones plus any moved from the previous column. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips in the current column, so when moving into the current column, the current state can be a combination of the original chips and the chips moved from the previous column. \n\nHmm, perhaps the mask is the original chips in column i, so when considering transitions, the current state must account for both the original chips and the chips moved from the previous column. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips, and the DP's state is the current chips after considering the moves. So the transitions must consider that the current state can be formed by moving chips from the previous column's state into the current column's positions, plus the original chips here. \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of an example. Suppose in column i-1, the previous state is 0b11 (both cells have chips). Then, moving those chips to column i. Each can move right (to column i's same row), or down/up (but since it's the same column, maybe only moving right? Wait, movement can be in any direction, but the columns are processed in order. \n\nWait, the movement can be in any direction, but the DP approach is processing column by column, so perhaps the transitions are considering moving from the previous column (i-1) to current (i). So a chip in the previous column can move to the current column's left, right, or same column but different row. \n\nWait, perhaps the movement from the previous column (i-1) to current (i) can be moving right (so from column i-1 to i), or moving up/down (same column, but different row). \n\nAlternatively, the DP approach is considering that each step, the chips can be moved from the previous column's positions into the current column's positions. \n\nHmm, perhaps the transitions are as follows: For each previous state (prev_state) and current state (curr_state), the cost is the number of moves required to transition from prev_state to curr_state, plus the existing chips in the current column. \n\nWait, but the existing chips in the current column (mask) must be considered. So the current state must include those chips. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips in the current column, so the current state must be the combination of the original chips and the chips moved from the previous column. \n\nWait, perhaps the mask is the original chips, so when moving into the current column, the current state is the combination of the original chips and the chips moved from the previous column. \n\nBut how do the moves work? Let me think of the possible transitions. \n\nSuppose in the previous column (i-1), the state is prev_state. Each chip in prev_state can move to adjacent cells in column i. \n\nFor example, a chip in the top row of column i-1 can move to the top row of column i (right), the bottom row of column i (down), or the left (but that's column i-2, which is not considered here). Wait, but the movement can be in any direction, but the DP is processing column by column, so perhaps the transitions only consider moving from the previous column to current. \n\nAlternatively, the movement from the previous column's chips can only move to the current column's cells (since moving left would go back, which is not part of the current processing). \n\nHmm, perhaps the DP approach is considering that each step, the chips can be moved from the previous column's positions into the current column's positions, and the current column's original chips are also present. \n\nWait, but the problem allows moving any chip in any direction, so perhaps the DP approach is considering that the current column's state is built by moving chips from the previous column into the current column's cells, plus the original chips here. \n\nAlternatively, the DP[i][curr_state] is the minimal moves to have curr_state in column i, considering all possible ways to move chips from the previous column's state into the current column's state, plus the original chips here. \n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Let me think of the code structure again. \n\nThe code initializes dp[i][...] as 1e9 (a large number), then for each i, it loops over k (previous state) and then computes transitions. \n\nThe mask variable is the current column's original chips. \n\nThe code has a loop over k (previous state) from 0 to 3. \n\nInside that loop, perhaps for each previous state (k), we need to compute the possible transitions to the current state (curr_state) considering the current column's mask. \n\nWait, perhaps the transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state (prev_state), and for each possible current state (curr_state), we can compute the cost of moving from prev_state to curr_state, and then update the DP[i][curr_state] accordingly. \n\nThe cost would be the number of moves required to transition from prev_state to curr_state, plus the existing chips in the current column. \n\nWait, but how do the existing chips in the current column (mask) affect this? \n\nAlternatively, the current state must be the combination of the original chips (mask) and the chips moved from the previous column. \n\nHmm, perhaps the mask is the original chips, so the current state must include those. So the current_state must be the OR of the original mask and the chips moved from the previous column. \n\nAlternatively, the original chips are part of the current state. So when moving chips from the previous column into the current column, they can land in the same column's cells, possibly overlapping with the original chips. \n\nWait, the problem says that when moving into a cell with another chip, that chip is captured. So moving a chip into a cell with an existing chip (original or moved) would remove that existing chip. \n\nThis complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, the DP approach is considering that the current state is the set of chips present in the current column after considering the moves from the previous column and the original chips. \n\nHmm, perhaps the transitions are as follows: \n\nThe previous state (prev_state) represents the chips in column i-1. \n\nEach chip in prev_state can move to adjacent cells in column i (since moving right is allowed). \n\nAdditionally, the current column has its own original chips (mask). \n\nThe current state (curr_state) is the combination of the chips moved from the previous column and the original chips, but with captures. \n\nWait, but captures happen when moving into a cell with a chip. So moving a chip into a cell with an existing chip (either original or from previous moves) would remove that existing chip. \n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe the DP approach is simplifying this by considering that the current state is the set of chips present in column i after all moves, and the transitions account for the minimal moves required to reach that state from the previous state. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP[i][curr_state] represents the minimal number of moves to have exactly the curr_state in column i, considering all possible ways to move chips from the previous column's state into this column, and the original chips here. \n\nThe transitions would need to consider all possible previous states (prev_state) and compute the cost to transition to curr_state. \n\nThe cost would be the number of moves required to move the chips from prev_state to curr_state, plus the existing chips in the current column. \n\nWait, but how do the existing chips in the current column (mask) affect the transitions? \n\nMaybe the mask is the original chips, so the current_state must be the combination of the original chips and the chips moved from the previous column, but with captures. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips, so when moving chips into the current column, they can land on top of the original chips, which would capture them. \n\nHmm, perhaps the mask is the original chips, so the current_state is the result of moving chips from the previous column into the current column's cells, considering that any overlapping with the original chips would capture them. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips, so the current_state must be the union of the moved chips and the original chips, but with captures. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Let me think of the code's structure again. \n\nThe code has for each i from 1 to n:\n\n- compute mask (current column's original chips)\n- for each k (previous state 0-3):\n   // TODO: Your code here\n- then, after the loop, there are lines that set dp[i][0b01] and dp[i][0b10] to the minimum of their current value and the min of other states plus 1. \n\nWait, the code after the loop for k has:\n\ndp[i][0b01] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b10], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b01] );\ndp[i][0b10] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b01], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b10] );\n\nThis suggests that for the current column's state 0b01 (only top has a chip), the minimal moves can be obtained by taking the minimum between its current value and the minimum of the other states (0b10 and 0b11) plus 1. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is handling transitions where moving from a state with two chips (0b11) to a single chip (0b01 or 0b10) requires one move (capturing the other). \n\nAlternatively, maybe this is part of the transition logic where moving from a state with two chips to a single one requires one move (since moving one into the other's position would capture it). \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think of the transitions. \n\nThe code's current structure is that for each previous state (k), we need to compute transitions to the current states. \n\nThe mask is the current column's original chips. \n\nPerhaps the transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state (prev_state), and for each possible current state (curr_state), we can compute the cost to transition from prev_state to curr_state, considering the current column's mask. \n\nThe cost would be the number of moves required to move the chips from prev_state to curr_state, plus the existing chips in the current column. \n\nWait, but how do the existing chips in the current column (mask) affect this? \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips, so the current_state must include those. \n\nWait, perhaps the current_state is the combination of the original chips (mask) and the chips moved from the previous column. \n\nBut when moving chips into the current column, they can land on the original chips, which would capture them. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nThe problem requires the minimal moves to end up with exactly one chip. The key insight might be that the minimal moves are determined by the positions of the chips. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of moves is the minimal distance between all pairs of chips, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves can be found by considering that the last remaining chip must be the one that can \"absorb\" all others with the least moves. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal moves is the minimal over all possible positions (i,j) of the final chip, of the sum of distances from all other chips to that position, minus some overlaps. \n\nBut since moving a chip can capture others, perhaps the minimal moves is the minimal over all positions of the maximum distance from any chip to that position. \n\nWait, that might be the case. Because to have one chip left, you can move all other chips to that position, but each move can capture others. \n\nWait, the minimal number of moves would be the minimal over all possible target positions (x,y) of the sum of the distances from each chip to (x,y), but since moving a chip can capture others, perhaps it's the maximum distance from any chip to the target, because you can move the farthest chip first, and others can be moved in parallel. \n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Let me think: \n\nSuppose all chips are moved to a single target position. The number of moves required would be the maximum distance from any chip to the target, because you can move the farthest chip first, and then others can be moved in steps that don't interfere. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves required is the minimal over all possible target positions of the maximum distance from any chip to that position. \n\nIf that's the case, then the solution would be to compute for all possible positions (each cell in the 2xN grid) the maximum distance from any chip to that position, and then take the minimal such maximum. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? \n\nThe problem's constraints are up to 2e5 n per test case, so we need an O(n) approach. \n\nHmm, but the code given is using a DP approach, so perhaps the DP is trying to model this. \n\nAlternatively, the DP approach is tracking the possible states (which cells in the current column have chips) and the minimal moves to reach that state. \n\nThe DP transitions would consider moving chips from the previous column's state into the current column's state, and the minimal moves required. \n\nLet me think of the DP transitions again. \n\nThe DP[i][state] is the minimal moves to reach that state at column i. \n\nThe state can be 0 (no chips), 1 (top has a chip), 2 (bottom has a chip), or 3 (both). \n\nThe transitions from the previous state (prev_state) to current state (curr_state) would involve moving the chips from the previous column's positions into the current column's positions. \n\nEach chip in the previous column can move to adjacent cells in the current column. \n\nWait, the movement from column i-1 to i is moving right (since columns are in order). So a chip in column i-1 can move to column i's same row (right), or to the other row (down/up). \n\nAdditionally, chips can stay in the same column (but that's not moving right). Wait, but the movement can be in any direction, but the DP is processing column by column, so perhaps the transitions only consider moving from the previous column to current. \n\nHmm, perhaps the transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state (prev_state), and for each possible current state (curr_state), we can compute the cost of moving from prev_state to curr_state. \n\nThe cost would be the number of moves required to move the chips from prev_state to curr_state. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think of prev_state as the chips in column i-1. \n\nEach chip in prev_state can move to adjacent cells in column i. \n\nFor example, if prev_state has a chip in the top row (i-1, 0), it can move to (i,0) (right), (i-1,0) (staying?), but since we are moving to column i, perhaps only moving to column i's cells. \n\nWait, the movement can be to any adjacent cell, so from column i-1's top row, the possible moves to column i are: \n\n- right (same row, column i's top)\n- down (to column i-1's bottom row? No, that's same column. Wait, adjacent by side. \n\nWait, the rows are two, so a chip in row 0 (top) can move to row 1 (down), but that's in the same column. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the DP approach is considering that each step, the chips can be moved into the current column's cells from the previous column's cells. \n\nAlternatively, the DP[i][state] represents the minimal moves to have the current column's state (after considering all moves up to this column), and the transitions are based on moving chips from the previous column's state into the current column's state. \n\nThe mask variable is the original chips in the current column. \n\nWait, perhaps the current state must include the original chips (mask) plus any chips moved from the previous column. \n\nBut when moving chips into the current column, they can land on the original chips, which would capture them. \n\nHmm, perhaps the mask is the original chips, so the current state is the combination of the original chips and the chips moved from the previous column, but with captures. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips, so the current state must be the union of the moved chips and the original chips, but with captures. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let me look at the code's existing lines after the TODO loop. \n\nThe code has:\n\ndp[i][0b01] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b10], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b01] );\ndp[i][0b10] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b01], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b10] );\n\nThis suggests that for the current column's state 0b01 (only top has a chip), the minimal moves can be obtained by taking the minimum between its current value and the minimum of the other states (0b10 and 0b11) plus 1. \n\nThis might be handling transitions where moving from a state with two chips (0b11) to a single chip (0b01 or 0b10) requires one move (capturing the other). \n\nAlternatively, this is part of the transition logic where moving from a state with two chips to a single one requires one move. \n\nPerhaps the transitions are considering that when you have two chips in the previous column, you can move one into the other's position, which would capture it, resulting in one chip. \n\nBut how does this fit into the DP transitions? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to handle transitions where moving from a previous state to the current state can be done by moving a chip from the previous column into the current column's cell, and the cost is 1 move. \n\nHmm, perhaps the transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state (prev_state), and for each possible current state (curr_state), the cost is the number of moves required to move the chips from prev_state to curr_state. \n\nThe transitions would loop over all possible curr_state (0-3), and for each, compute the minimal cost. \n\nBut how to compute the cost between prev_state and curr_state? \n\nLet me think of the possible transitions between states. \n\nSuppose the previous state is 0b01 (top has a chip in column i-1). \n\nThe current state can be: \n\n- 0b01: the chip stays in the same position (top row, column i). The move is moving right (distance 1). So cost is 1. \n\n- 0b11: the chip moves down to the bottom row of column i-1? No, that's same column. Wait, moving from column i-1's top to column i's bottom? \n\nWait, the movement from column i-1 to column i can be moving right (so same row, column i), or moving down (to the bottom row of column i-1, but that's not part of the current column). \n\nHmm, perhaps the movement from the previous column's top row can move to the current column's top row (right), or to the current column's bottom row (down-right?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the movement from the previous column's top row can move to the current column's top row (right), or to the current column's bottom row (down-right). \n\nWait, the adjacency is by side. So a cell in (row 0, column i-1) can move to (row 0, column i) (right), (row 0, column i-2) (left), (row 1, column i-1) (down). \n\nBut since we are processing column by column, perhaps the transitions only consider moving to the current column (i) from the previous (i-1). \n\nSo from the previous column's top row (i-1, 0), the possible moves to the current column (i) are: \n\n- right to (i,0) (top row, current column)\n- down to (i-1,1) (bottom row of previous column) \u2014 but that's not part of the current column. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the DP transitions are considering that each chip in the previous column can move to the current column's cells (either top or bottom row of current column), and the cost is 1 move per chip moved. \n\nWait, but each move is a single move per chip. \n\nAlternatively, the cost for moving a chip from the previous column to the current column is 1 move. \n\nSo for each chip in the previous state, moving it to the current column's cell requires 1 move. \n\nBut how does this affect the current state? \n\nSuppose previous state is 0b01 (top row of previous column has a chip). \n\nTo move to current column's top row (0b01), the cost is 1 (moving right). \n\nTo move to current column's bottom row (0b10), the cost is 1 (moving down-right? Or down then right?), but perhaps it's considered as one move. \n\nWait, the problem allows moving to any adjacent cell in one move. So moving from (i-1,0) to (i,1) would require two moves: first down to (i-1,1), then right to (i,1). Or maybe it's allowed in one move? \n\nWait, the problem says in one move, you can move to any adjacent cell. So from (i-1,0), you can move to (i,0) (right), (i-1,1) (down), or (i-2,0) (left). \n\nTo get to (i,1), you need to move down then right, which would take two moves. \n\nHmm, so moving from (i-1,0) to (i,1) requires two moves. \n\nThis complicates the cost calculation. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal moves to move a chip from (row r, column c) to (row r', column c') is the Manhattan distance between them. \n\nThe Manhattan distance between (r, c) and (r', c') is |r - r'| + |c - c'|. \n\nSo for example, moving from (0, i-1) to (1, i) would have a distance of 1 (row difference 1) + 1 (column difference 1) \u2192 total 2. \n\nBut since each move can only move one step, the minimal number of moves is exactly the Manhattan distance. \n\nTherefore, the cost to move a chip from a previous position to a current position is the Manhattan distance between them. \n\nBut in the DP approach, we need to track the minimal moves for all possible states. \n\nHmm, perhaps the DP[i][curr_state] is the minimal total moves to reach curr_state at column i, considering all possible ways to move chips from previous states. \n\nThe transitions would be: \n\nFor each previous state (prev_state), and for each possible current state (curr_state), compute the cost to move the chips from prev_state to curr_state, and update the DP[i][curr_state] as the minimum between its current value and DP[i-1][prev_state] + cost. \n\nThe cost would be the sum of the Manhattan distances for each chip in prev_state to their new positions in curr_state. \n\nBut how to model this for all possible transitions? \n\nThis seems computationally heavy, but since the state is only 4 possibilities (0-3), it might be manageable. \n\nLet me think of the possible transitions between states. \n\nThe previous state can be 0,1,2,3. \n\nThe current state can also be 0,1,2,3. \n\nFor each pair of prev_state and curr_state, we need to compute the minimal cost to transition between them. \n\nThe cost is the sum of the distances for each chip in prev_state to their new positions in curr_state. \n\nWait, but the curr_state may have chips that are not from the previous state, but from the current column's original chips (mask). \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips in the current column, so the current state must include those. \n\nWait, perhaps the current state is the combination of the original chips (mask) and the chips moved from the previous column. \n\nBut when moving chips into the current column, they can land on the original chips, which would capture them. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the original chips, so the current state is the union of the moved chips and the original chips, but with captures. \n\nThis is really tricky. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the intended solution's approach. \n\nThe problem requires the minimal moves to have exactly one chip left. \n\nThe key observation is that the minimal moves is the minimal over all possible positions of the final chip of the sum of the distances from all other chips to that position. \n\nWait, but since moving a chip can capture others, perhaps the minimal moves is the minimal over all positions of the maximum distance from any chip to that position. \n\nBecause you can move the farthest chip first, and then others can be moved in steps that don't require more moves than the maximum. \n\nFor example, if the farthest chip is distance D away, then you can move it to the target in D moves, and other chips can be moved in parallel, but their moves can be done in steps that don't exceed D. \n\nThus, the total moves needed would be the maximum distance from any chip to the target. \n\nTherefore, the minimal moves is the minimal maximum distance over all possible target positions. \n\nThis makes sense. \n\nSo the solution is to compute for every possible cell (row, column) the maximum distance from any chip to that cell, then take the minimum of those maxima. \n\nThe distance between a chip at (r1, c1) and a target (r2, c2) is |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|. \n\nSo the steps would be: \n\n1. For each test case, collect all the positions of the chips. \n\n2. For each possible target position (r, c), compute the maximum distance from any chip to (r, c). \n\n3. Find the minimal such maximum distance. \n\nThis would give the minimal number of moves required. \n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently? \n\nThe problem has n up to 2e5, so for each test case, we need an O(n) solution. \n\nThe number of possible target positions is 2 * n (since two rows, n columns). \n\nFor each target (r, c), we need to find the maximum distance from all chips to (r,c). \n\nThe maximum distance can be found by iterating over all chips and computing their distance to (r,c), then taking the maximum. \n\nBut with n up to 2e5 and t up to 2e4, this would be O(t * n^2), which is way too slow. \n\nHmm, so this approach is not feasible. \n\nAlternative idea: \n\nThe minimal maximum distance is the minimal over all possible target positions of the maximum distance from any chip to that position. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can find the optimal target position by considering the median or some other central point. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal target is the median of the chips' positions in some way. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal maximum distance is the minimal of the maximum distances between pairs of chips. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal maximum distance is the minimal of the maximum distances between any two chips. \n\nBecause if you choose a target between two chips, the maximum distance would be the distance between those two chips divided by 2. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal maximum distance is the minimal over all pairs of chips of the distance between them divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal maximum distance is the minimal of the maximum distance between any two chips divided by 2. \n\nFor example, if two chips are at distance D apart, then choosing a point midway between them would give a maximum distance of D/2. \n\nThus, the minimal maximum distance is the minimal over all pairs of chips of (distance between them)/2. \n\nBut this is only true if there are at least two chips. \n\nWait, but the problem states there is at least one chip. \n\nIf there's only one chip, then the answer is 0. \n\nOtherwise, the minimal maximum distance is the minimal over all pairs of chips of (distance between them)/2, rounded up. \n\nWait, let's see an example. \n\nSuppose two chips are at positions (0,0) and (0, 2). The distance between them is 2. \n\nThe optimal target is (0,1), which gives maximum distance 1. \n\nWhich is 2/2 = 1. \n\nAnother example: three chips at (0,0), (0,3), (1,2). \n\nThe pairwise distances are 3 (between first and second), sqrt( (1)^2 + (2)^2 ) but Manhattan distance is 1+2=3 between first and third, etc. \n\nThe minimal maximum would be choosing a point between the first and second chips, say (0,1.5), but since we can only choose integer positions, perhaps (0,1) or (0,2). \n\nThe maximum distance would be max(1, 2) = 2. \n\nWhich is 3/2 rounded up. \n\nHmm, this seems to hold. \n\nSo the minimal maximum distance is the minimal over all pairs of chips of ceil( distance / 2 ). \n\nThus, the solution would be: \n\n- If there is only one chip, the answer is 0. \n\n- Else, compute all pairwise distances between chips, take the minimal of (distance / 2) rounded up. \n\nWait, but this is only true if the optimal target is the midpoint between two chips. \n\nBut what if there are more than two chips? \n\nSuppose three chips are at positions (0,0), (0,2), and (0,4). \n\nThe pairwise distances are 2, 4, and 2. \n\nThe minimal pairwise distance is 2 (between first and second, or second and third). \n\nThe minimal maximum distance would be choosing the middle point (0,2), which gives maximum distance 2 (from first and third). \n\nWhich is 4/2 = 2. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nAnother example with three chips not in a line: \n\nChips at (0,0), (0,3), (1,1). \n\nThe pairwise distances are 3 (0,0 to 0,3), 2 (0,0 to 1,1), and sqrt( (1)^2 + (2)^2 ) Manhattan distance is 1+2=3 between (0,3) and (1,1). \n\nThe minimal pairwise distance is 2 (between first and third). \n\nThe optimal target would be between them, say (0.5, 0.5) but since we can only choose integer positions, perhaps (0,0) gives max distance 3 (from third chip), but that's worse. \n\nAlternatively, choosing (0,1) gives distances 1 (from first), 2 (from third), and 2 (from second). \n\nThe maximum is 2. \n\nWhich is the minimal possible. \n\nThe minimal pairwise distance is 2 (between first and third), so 2/2 = 1. But the maximum distance here is 2. \n\nHmm, this contradicts the earlier idea. \n\nWait, the pairwise distance between first and third is 2 (Manhattan distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is 2). \n\nSo the minimal pairwise distance is 2. \n\nThe minimal maximum distance would be 2 (as in the example). \n\nWhich is exactly the pairwise distance divided by 1. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal maximum distance is the minimal pairwise distance divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nWait, in this case, 2/2 = 1, but the actual maximum is 2. \n\nSo that idea is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the initial idea is not correct. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe minimal maximum distance is the minimal over all possible target positions of the maximum distance from any chip to that target. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can note that the optimal target must be one of the existing chips' positions. \n\nWait, why? \n\nSuppose there is a target position that is not a chip's position. \n\nThe maximum distance from any chip to this target could be less than the maximum distance to a nearby chip's position. \n\nBut perhaps the minimal maximum is achieved at one of the chips' positions. \n\nFor example, if all chips are at (0,0), then the optimal target is (0,0), with maximum distance 0. \n\nIf there are two chips at (0,0) and (0,2), then the optimal target is (0,1), giving maximum distance 1. \n\nBut if we choose (0,0), the maximum distance is 2. \n\nSo the optimal is not a chip's position. \n\nThus, the optimal target may not be a chip's position. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternative idea: \n\nThe minimal maximum distance is the minimal of the maximum distances between any two chips divided by 2, rounded up. \n\nIn the first example with two chips at distance 2, the minimal maximum is 1, which is 2/2. \n\nIn the three chips example (0,0), (0,3), (1,1), the pairwise distances are 3 (0-3), 2 (0-1), and 3 (3-1). \n\nThe minimal pairwise distance is 2 (between first and third). \n\nThe minimal maximum distance would be 2 (when choosing a point between them). \n\nWhich is 2/1 = 2. \n\nHmm, so that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal maximum distance is the minimal of the maximum between all pairs of chips divided by 2. \n\nWait, the maximum between two chips is their distance. \n\nThe minimal maximum distance would be the minimal over all pairs of (distance between them)/2. \n\nIn the first example, 2/2 =1. \n\nIn the three chips example, the minimal pairwise distance is 2, so 2/2 =1. But the actual minimal maximum is 2. \n\nSo that doesn't work. \n\nHmm, this is getting too stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should return to the original code and see what it's trying to do. \n\nThe code uses a DP approach with states for each column. \n\nThe DP[i][state] is the minimal moves to reach that state at column i. \n\nThe mask is the current column's original chips. \n\nThe transitions are supposed to be filled in the TODO section. \n\nThe code after the loop for k has lines that update the current state's DP value by taking the minimum between its current value and the minimum of other states plus 1. \n\nThis suggests that there are transitions where moving from a state with two chips to a single one requires one move. \n\nPerhaps the transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state (k), and for each possible current state (curr_state), the cost is the number of moves required to move the chips from the previous state to the current state. \n\nThe transitions would consider all possible ways to move the chips from the previous column's state into the current column's state, possibly capturing others. \n\nThe mask (current column's original chips) must be considered as part of the current state. \n\nWait, perhaps the current state must be the OR of the previous state's chips moved to the current column and the current column's original chips. \n\nBut captures happen when moving into a cell with a chip. \n\nAlternatively, the current state is the combination of the previous state's chips moved to the current column and the current column's original chips, but with captures. \n\nThis is very complex. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the current column's original chips, and the current state must include those. \n\nSo the current state is the OR of the previous state's chips moved to the current column and the mask. \n\nBut captures would mean that overlapping chips are removed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the current state is the XOR of the moved chips and the mask? \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code's DP is trying to track the minimal moves to have a certain state in the current column, considering that the current column's original chips are part of the state. \n\nThe transitions would be: \n\nFor each previous state (k), and for each possible current state (curr_state), the cost is the number of moves required to move the chips from the previous state to the current state, plus the moves needed to account for the current column's original chips. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the mask is the current column's original chips, and the current state must be the combination of the previous state's chips moved to the current column and the mask. \n\nThe cost is the number of moves to move the previous state's chips to the current column's positions, plus the number of moves needed to account for the mask's chips. \n\nBut this is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the code's DP is designed such that the current state is the state of the current column after processing all moves up to this column. \n\nThe transitions are computed by considering all possible previous states and the current column's mask. \n\nThe code's TODO section is where the transitions are computed. \n\nThe loop for k (previous state) is iterating over all possible previous states. \n\nFor each previous state (k), we need to compute the transitions to the current state (curr_state). \n\nThe current state can be any of the four possible states (0-3). \n\nThe cost for transitioning from k to curr_state would be the number of moves required to move the chips from the previous state to the current state, plus the moves needed to account for the current column's original chips. \n\nBut how to compute this cost? \n\nPerhaps the cost is the number of moves required to move the chips from the previous state to the current state's positions, plus the number of chips in the current column's mask that are not already accounted for. \n\nAlternatively, the cost is the number of moves required to move the previous state's chips into the current state's positions, plus the number of chips in the current column's mask that are not in the current state. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps the code's transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state (k), and for each possible current state (curr_state), the cost is the number of moves required to move the chips from the previous state to the current state. \n\nThe moves are calculated as follows: \n\n- For each chip in the previous state's positions (row 0 or 1 of column i-1), moving to the current state's positions (row 0 or 1 of column i) requires a move of 1 (since moving right is one step). \n\n- Additionally, if the current column has original chips (mask), those are already present and don't require moves. \n\nWait, but the mask is the current column's original chips. So the current state must include those. \n\nHmm, perhaps the current state must be the combination of the previous state's chips moved to the current column and the current column's original chips. \n\nBut captures would mean that overlapping chips are removed. \n\nThis is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the correct transitions in the DP. \n\nThe code's initial setup for dp[i][...] is filled with 1e9. \n\nThen, for each previous state (k), we can compute the transitions to the current state. \n\nThe mask is the current column's original chips. \n\nThe current state must be the combination of the previous state's chips moved to the current column and the mask's chips. \n\nBut captures would mean that overlapping chips are removed. \n\nAlternatively, the current state is the OR of the previous state's chips moved to the current column and the mask's chips. \n\nBut captures would mean that overlapping chips are removed. \n\nThis is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, the current state is the set of chips present in the current column after moving from the previous state and considering the original chips. \n\nThe cost is the number of moves required to move the previous state's chips to the current state's positions. \n\nThe mask's chips are already present, so they don't require moves. \n\nThus, the cost is the number of moves to move the previous state's chips to the current state's positions. \n\nThe transitions would be: \n\nFor each previous state (k), and for each possible current state (curr_state), the cost is the number of moves required to move the chips from the previous state to the current state. \n\nThe moves are calculated as follows: \n\n- For each chip in the previous state's positions (row 0 or 1 of column i-1), moving to the current state's positions (row 0 or 1 of column i) requires a move of 1 (since moving right is one step). \n\n- Additionally, if the current state has a chip in a position that is not in the previous state's moved chips, it must be part of the mask's original chips. \n\nThus, the cost is the number of chips in the previous state multiplied by 1 (since each chip can move right to the current column's same row, or down/up to the other row). \n\nWait, but moving to the other row would require an extra move. \n\nFor example, a chip in the previous column's top row can move to the current column's bottom row (down-right), which would require two moves: down then right. \n\nThus, the cost would be 2. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nPerhaps the minimal cost to move a chip from the previous column's top row to the current column's bottom row is 2 (down then right). \n\nBut the problem allows moving to any adjacent cell in one move. \n\nWait, the problem says in one move, you can move to any adjacent cell. \n\nSo from (i-1,0) (top row of previous column), you can move to (i-1,1) (bottom row of previous column) in one move. \n\nBut that's not part of the current column. \n\nTo get to the current column's bottom row (i,1), you can move right to (i,0) then down to (i,1), which is two moves. \n\nOr down then right: (i-1,0) \u2192 (i-1,1) then \u2192 (i,1). \n\nEither way, two moves. \n\nThus, the cost to move from previous top to current bottom is 2. \n\nSimilarly, moving from previous bottom to current top is also two moves. \n\nMoving to the same row is one move. \n\nThus, the cost between states can be computed as follows: \n\nFor each previous state (k) and current state (curr_state), the cost is the sum of the moves required for each chip in the previous state to reach their new positions in the current state. \n\nThe current state's chips must be a subset of the previous state's chips moved to the current column plus the mask's chips. \n\nBut this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps the code's transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state (k), and for each possible current state (curr_state), the cost is the number of chips in the previous state multiplied by 1 (assuming they move right to the same row), plus any additional moves needed to move to other rows. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's transitions are considering that moving a chip from the previous column to the current column's same row costs 1 move, and to the other row costs 2 moves. \n\nThus, for each previous state (k), and for each current state (curr_state), the cost is computed as follows: \n\n- For each chip in the previous state's top row (bit 0 set), if the current state has a top row chip (bit 0 set), then the cost is 1. \n\n- If the current state has a bottom row chip (bit 1 set), then the cost is 2. \n\n- Similarly for the bottom row chips in the previous state. \n\nThe total cost is the sum of the costs for each chip in the previous state. \n\nThen, the transitions would be: \n\nfor each previous state k: \n\n   for each current state curr_state: \n\n      cost = 0 \n\n      if (k & 0b01) != 0: // previous top has a chip \n\n          if (curr_state & 0b01) !=0: // moved to top \n\n              cost +=1 \n\n          else if (curr_state & 0b10) !=0: // moved to bottom \n\n              cost +=2 \n\n      if (k & 0b10) !=0: // previous bottom has a chip \n\n          if (curr_state & 0b10) !=0: // moved to bottom \n\n              cost +=1 \n\n          else if (curr_state & 0b01) !=0: // moved to top \n\n              cost +=2 \n\n      // also account for the current column's mask \n\n      // but how? \n\n      // then, the total cost is previous dp[i-1][k] + cost \n\n      // and update dp[i][curr_state] \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nThe mask is the current column's original chips. \n\nThe current state must include those chips. \n\nSo the current_state must have the bits set in the mask. \n\nThus, the current_state must be the OR of the moved chips and the mask. \n\nBut captures would mean that overlapping chips are removed. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code's transitions are designed such that the current state must include the mask's chips. \n\nThus, the current_state must have the bits set in the mask. \n\nSo for example, if the mask is 0b01 (top has a chip), then the current_state must have the top bit set. \n\nThus, the transitions are only allowed to current states that include the mask's bits. \n\nThis would mean that the current_state must be the OR of the moved chips and the mask. \n\nBut captures would mean that overlapping chips are removed. \n\nThis is very tricky. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for the correct code to fill in the TODO section. \n\nThe code's loop for k (previous state) is inside the loop for i. \n\nThe mask is computed as the current column's original chips. \n\nThe code's TODO section is inside the loop over k. \n\nThe code after the loop for k has lines that update the current state's DP values by taking the minimum between their current value and the minimum of other states plus 1. \n\nThis suggests that the transitions are considering that moving from a state with two chips to a single one requires one move. \n\nPerhaps the transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state k, and for each possible current state curr_state: \n\n   if the current_state can be reached from k by moving chips into the current column's cells, then the cost is computed and the DP is updated. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the code's transitions are considering that the current state can be formed by moving chips from the previous state into the current column's cells, and the cost is the number of moves required. \n\nThe cost for moving from k to curr_state is the number of chips in the previous state multiplied by 1 (since each can move right to the current column's same row), plus any additional moves needed to move to other rows. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code's transitions are as follows: \n\nFor each previous state k: \n\n   for each possible current state curr_state: \n\n      // compute the cost to move from k to curr_state \n\n      int cost = 0; \n\n      // check if the current_state can be formed from k \n\n      // considering the current column's mask \n\n      // but this is unclear \n\n      // then, the cost is computed based on the moves required \n\n      // then, dp[i][curr_state] = min(dp[i][curr_state], dp[i-1][k] + cost); \n\nBut without knowing the exact cost calculation, it's hard to proceed. \n\nPerhaps the code's transitions are designed such that the cost is the number of chips in the previous state plus the number of chips in the current state minus the overlap. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code's transitions are considering that each chip in the previous state can move to any of the current column's cells (top or bottom) with a cost of 1 or 2. \n\nThe minimal cost for each possible transition is computed and the DP is updated. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct code for the TODO section is: \n\nfor each previous state k: \n\n   for each possible current state curr_state: \n\n      // compute the cost to move from k to curr_state \n\n      int cost = 0; \n\n      // check if the current_state can be formed from k \n\n      // considering the current column's mask \n\n      // but this is unclear \n\n      // then, the cost is computed based on the moves required \n\n      // then, dp[i][curr_state] = min(dp[i][curr_state], dp[i-1][k] + cost); \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's transitions are as follows: \n\nfor each previous state k: \n\n   // the current state can be formed by moving the previous state's chips to the current column \n\n   // and possibly including the current column's mask \n\n   // but this is unclear \n\n   // the cost is the number of chips in the previous state (each moves right) \n\n   // plus any additional moves for moving to other rows \n\n   // for example, if previous state has a top chip and current has bottom, cost +=1 \n\n   // but this is just a guess \n\n   // then, the cost is computed and the DP is updated \n\nBut without knowing the exact cost calculation, it's hard to proceed. \n\nPerhaps the correct code for the TODO section is: \n\nfor (int curr = 0; curr < 4; curr++) { \n\n    int cost = 0; \n\n    // compute cost from k to curr \n\n    // for each bit set in k, compute the cost to move to curr's bits \n\n    // but this is unclear \n\n    // then, if (curr & mask) == mask) { \n\n    // because the current state must include the mask's chips \n\n    // then, dp[i][curr] = Math.min(dp[i][curr], dp[i-1][k] + cost); \n\n} \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code's transitions are considering that the current state must include the mask's chips. \n\nThus, the current_state must have the bits set in the mask. \n\nSo for example, if the mask is 0b01 (top has a chip), then the current_state must have the top bit set. \n\nThus, the transitions are only allowed to current states that include the mask's bits. \n\nThe cost is computed as the number of moves required to move the previous state's chips into the current state's positions. \n\nThe cost for each chip in the previous state is the distance to their new position. \n\nFor example, a chip in the previous top row (i-1,0) moving to current top row (i,0) costs 1. \n\nMoving to current bottom row (i,1) costs 2. \n\nSimilarly for bottom row. \n\nThus, the cost for each previous state's chip is computed and summed. \n\nThe code's TODO section would loop over all possible current states that include the mask's bits, compute the cost, and update the DP. \n\nThus, the code would look like this: \n\nfor (int curr = 0; curr < 4; curr++) { \n\n    if ((curr & mask) != mask) continue; // current state must include mask's chips \n\n    int cost = 0; \n\n    // compute cost from k to curr \n\n    // for each bit in k's top and bottom \n\n    if ((k & 1) != 0) { // previous top has a chip \n\n        if ((curr & 1) != 0) { // moved to top \n\n            cost += 1; \n\n        } else if ((curr & 2) != 0) { // moved to bottom \n\n            cost += 2; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    if ((k & 2) != 0) { // previous bottom has a chip \n\n        if ((curr & 2) != 0) { // moved to bottom \n\n            cost += 1; \n\n        } else if ((curr & 1) != 0) { // moved to top \n\n            cost += 2; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    // also account for the current column's mask's chips \n\n    // but they are already included in curr \n\n    // so the cost is the sum of the above \n\n    if (dp[i-1][k] + cost < dp[i][curr]) { \n\n        dp[i][curr] = dp[i-1][k] + cost; \n\n    } \n\n} \n\nThis is a possible implementation. \n\nThen, after considering all previous states and current states, the code's existing lines after the loop would handle some additional transitions. \n\nThe code after the loop for k has: \n\ndp[i][0b01] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b10], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b01] ); \n\ndp[i][0b10] = Math.min( Math.min(dp[i][0b01], dp[i][0b11]) + 1, dp[i][0b10] ); \n\nThis suggests that if there are two chips in the current state (0b11), then moving one into the other's position would capture it, resulting in one chip with one move. \n\nThus, the code is considering that from state 0b11, you can reach 0b01 or 0b10 with one move. \n\nThis is why those lines are there. \n\nThus, the complete code for the TODO section would be the loop over curr states and compute the cost as above. \n\nPutting it all together, the missing code inside the for (k) loop would be: \n\nfor (int curr = 0; curr < 4; curr++) { \n\n    if ((curr & mask) != mask) continue; \n\n    int cost = 0; \n\n    if ((k & 1) != 0) { \n\n        if ((curr & 1) != 0) cost += 1; \n\n        else if ((curr & 2) != 0) cost += 2; \n\n    } \n\n    if ((k & 2) != 0) { \n\n        if ((curr & 2) != 0) cost += 1; \n\n        else if ((curr & 1) != 0) cost += 2; \n\n    } \n\n    if (dp[i-1][k] + cost < dp[i][curr]) { \n\n        dp[i][curr] = dp[i-1][k] + cost; \n\n    } \n\n} \n\nThis is the code that should be placed in the TODO section. \n\nThus, the missing code is the loop over curr states and the cost calculation as above. \n\nThe final code would look like this in the TODO section."
