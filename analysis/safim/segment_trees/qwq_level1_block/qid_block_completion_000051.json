Alternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 2) * 2 - something. Let's see for the sample input. Wait in the note's example, n is 7 and m is 5? Because Megan moves to (7,3), then to (1,3). Wait the first test case must have n=7 and m=5? Let's see the sample's total energy is 15. Let's compute the initial code's formula: (m-1)+(n-1) + Math. Min(n,m). For n=7, m=5, that would be (4)+(6) +5 = 4+6=10, plus 5 gives 15. Which matches. So the sample is correct with that formula. Wait so maybe the code is correct? But let me check other cases. Let's see other scenarios. For example, when n=1 and m=2. Then Stanley needs to go from (1,1) to (1,2): 1 step. Megan needs to go from (1,1) (since n=1, her start is (1,1)) to (1,2). Wait Megan's start is (n,1) which when n=1 is (1,1). Her destination is (1,m) which is (1,2). So both are moving from (1,1) to (1,2). So their paths are the same. The total without portals would be 1+1=2. But with portals, since Megan leaves portals along her path. So Megan's path is just moving right, so she leaves a portal at (1,1) and (1,2). Wait Megan starts at (1,1), so the portal is already there. Then when she moves to (1,2), that cell gets a portal. So Stanley can use the portal in (1,2) but he's starting there. Hmm.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimal total energy Stanley and Megan need to reach their destinations, considering they can use portals. Hmm, the code provided has a Query method where they compute the answer as (m-1)+(n-1) + Math.Min(n,m). But the sample input's answer isn't matching that, right?\n\nWait, the note in the first test case says the total was 15. Let me think. Oh right, maybe the given code's formula is incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states that both can move, and they can use portals left by Megan's path. The key is figuring out the optimal path where they use portals to minimize the total energy.\n\nThe initial approach in the code might be wrong. Let me think of the correct approach.\n\nThe minimal total energy can be calculated by considering their paths and when they use the portals. The idea is that whenever they can use a portal, it's better to teleport instead of moving normally, except for the steps needed to place the portals.\n\nMegan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So the earliest a portal is available is along Megan's path. So the optimal path would involve them meeting at some point where they can teleport.\n\nLet me think of the Manhattan distances. Without portals, Stanley's path from (1,1) to (n,m) would take (n-1)+(m-1) steps. Similarly, Megan's path from (n,1) to (1,m) is also (n-1)+(m-1). So total would be 2*(n+m-2). But with portals, they can save some steps.\n\nThe best scenario is when they can share some portals. For instance, if they both reach a common portal point, then they can teleport the rest of the way.\n\nWait the problem says Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So the portals are along Megan's path. So Megan's path must be chosen such that the combined paths of both can take advantage.\n\nHmm, the minimal total energy formula might be (Stanley's distance without portals) + (Megan's distance without portals) minus some savings from the portals.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (Manhattan distance of Stanley) + (Manhattan of Megan) minus 2*(the minimal steps saved by using a portal once). Because using a portal can save the steps between two points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total energy is (Stanley's Manhattan + Megan's Manhattan) minus the minimal possible path that can be saved by using a portal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal is to have them meet at a point where the sum is minimized. Let me think of the problem as the sum of their individual minimal paths, but with possible overlaps where they can teleport.\n\nWait, the portals are placed along Megan's path. So Megan's path is important here. Her path must be such that the portals are placed in a way that both can use them optimally.\n\nLet me think of the minimal total. Since Megan can choose her path, perhaps the optimal path for Megan is to move in a way that the overlapping points between their paths allow maximum savings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 2) * 2 - something. Let's see for the sample input. Wait in the note's example, n is 7 and m is 5? Because Megan moves to (7,3), then to (1,3). Wait the first test case must have n=7 and m=5? Let's see the sample's total energy is 15. Let's compute the initial code's formula: (m-1)+(n-1) + Math.Min(n,m). For n=7, m=5, that would be (4)+(6) +5 = 4+6=10, plus 5 gives 15. Which matches. So the sample is correct with that formula.\n\nWait so maybe the code is correct? But let me check other cases. Let's see other scenarios.\n\nFor example, when n=1 and m=2. Then Stanley needs to go from (1,1) to (1,2): 1 step. Megan needs to go from (1,1) (since n=1, her start is (1,1)) to (1,2). Wait Megan's start is (n,1) which when n=1 is (1,1). Her destination is (1,m) which is (1,2). So both are moving from (1,1) to (1,2). So their paths are the same. The total without portals would be 1+1=2. But with portals, since Megan leaves portals along her path. So Megan's path is just moving right, so she leaves a portal at (1,1) and (1,2). \n\nWait Megan starts at (1,1), so the portal is already there. Then when she moves to (1,2), that cell gets a portal. So Stanley can use the portal in (1,2) but he's starting there. Hmm. Wait, maybe in this case, the minimal total is 1 (Stanley moves right) and Megan can just use the portal? Or wait:\n\nWait Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,2). So she has to move right, taking 1 step. Stanley also needs to go from (1,1) to (1,2), so he can just move right, 1 step. Total 2. But according to the formula (m-1)+(n-1) + min(n,m) \u2192 m=2, n=1. So (2-1)+(0) +1 \u2192 1+0 +1 = 2. Which matches.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2. Then the formula gives (2-1)+(1) + 2? Wait no, n=2, m=2. The formula: (m-1)+(n-1) \u2192 (1)+(1)=2, plus min(2,2)=2 \u2192 total 4.\n\nLet's see the actual paths. Stanley goes from (1,1) to (2,2). Manhattan is 2 steps. Megan from (2,1) to (1,2), which is also 2 steps. So total without portals 4. But can they use portals to save?\n\nMegan's path could be (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) (then portal there), then to (1,2). So Megan's path length is 1 (move up) then 1 (right), total 2 steps. Then Stanley's path: he can go to (1,1) using the portal? Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can use the portal there (since Megan placed it when she went through (1,1). Wait Megan's path: if she goes from (2,1) to (1,1), then that cell has a portal. So when Stanley is at (1,1), he can teleport anywhere else with portals. So perhaps Stanley can go from (1,1) to (2,2) via teleport. Wait, but Megan hasn't been to (2,2) yet. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, Megan's path is (2,1) to (1,2) via some path. Let's say she goes right then up. So her path is (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2). Then her path length is 2 steps, and the portals are at those cells. Then Stanley can take the path: from (1,1), he can move down to (2,1), but that may not be optimal. Alternatively:\n\nStanley can go to (2,2) by moving down and right, which is 2 steps. Megan's path uses 2 steps. Total 4. So formula gives 4. So it works here.\n\nAnother case: n=3, m=3. The formula would give (2)+(2) +3= 2+2=4 +3=7. Let's see: \n\nThe total would be 7. Let's see what's possible. The Manhattan for each is 4 (3+3-2), so total 8. But with the formula subtracting 1? Hmm, maybe the formula gives 7 which is 8-1. Not sure, but perhaps the formula is correct.\n\nSo maybe the code is correct. Wait, but why? Let me think of the formula (m-1)+(n-1) + Math.Min(n,m). \n\nWait the initial code's formula is (m-1)+(n-1) + min(n,m). So for the sample case, n=7 and m=5, min is 5. So 6+4=10 plus 5 gives 15 which matches.\n\nBut why does that formula work?\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total energy is (sum of Manhattan distances of both) minus (something), but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is the sum of their individual minimal paths minus the minimal distance between their paths, but I'm not sure. Let's think of the optimal path:\n\nThe idea is that once Megan creates a portal network, they can teleport. The minimal total energy is when they meet at a point where one can teleport to the other's destination. \n\nThe minimal total energy can be computed as follows: \n\nThe minimal total is (Stanley's Manhattan distance + Megan's Manhattan distance) - 2*(the minimal distance between their paths). Or perhaps the formula is derived from considering the best possible point where they can use the portals to save steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula comes from the observation that the minimal total is ( (n + m - 2) * 2 ) - (something). \n\nWait, let me think again. The initial code's formula is (m-1 + n-1) + min(n, m). So the sum of (m-1 + n-1) is (n+m-2), and adding min(n,m) gives (n+m-2 + min(n,m)). \n\nWait in the sample case, 7 and 5: 7+5-2 is 10, adding 5 gives 15. Which matches. \n\nAnother example: when n=1 and m=2. The formula gives (1-1) + (2-1) +1 \u2192 0+1=1, plus 1 \u2192 total 2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. The formula gives (1+1) +2 \u2192 2+2=4. Which works. \n\nHmm, so maybe this formula is correct. \n\nThen why was the initial code's Query function written like that? Let's see the code. \n\nThe code's current Query function does this:\n\nif n and m are 1, output 0. \n\nElse, ans = (m-1)+(n-1) + Math.Min(n,m). \n\nWait, so the formula is (n-1 + m-1) + min(n,m). \n\nWait, let me see for the case when n=3 and m=3: \n\nn-1 + m-1 is 4, min is 3 \u2192 total 7. \n\nWhich is (3+3-2)*2 - (something). Original sum would be 4+4=8, so subtract 1 gives 7. \n\nHmm, but how does this formula work? \n\nMaybe the idea is that one of them can use a portal to save steps equal to the minimum of n and m. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal path is when they meet at a point that allows them to teleport once, saving the distance between that point and their destination. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is (Manhattan distance of Stanley) + (Manhattan of Megan) minus (the minimal distance between their paths), but I'm not sure. \n\nBut according to the sample and other test cases, the formula seems correct. \n\nWait, but what about when n and m are very large?\n\nLet me think of n=1 and m=1e5. Then the formula gives (1e5-1) + (0) + 1 \u2192 (99999) +1 = 100,000? Wait no: (m-1)+(n-1) is (1e5-1 +0) = 99999. Then adding min(1, 1e5) \u2192 1. Total 100,000. \n\nWait Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,1e5). That's m-1 steps (99999). Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1) and needs to go to (1,1e5). So her path is the same as Stanley's, so her distance is also 99999. So total without any portals would be 199998. \n\nBut according to the formula, the answer would be 100,000. \n\nWait that's a big difference. How does that work?\n\nAh, in this case, Megan's path is along the same path as Stanley. She leaves portals along her path. So Megan can go directly, but perhaps they can use the portals to save steps. \n\nWait Megan's path must be from (n,1) to (1, m). But when n=1, Megan starts at (1,1), and needs to reach (1, m). So her path can be straight right. Along the way, every cell she steps on has a portal. \n\nSo when Stanley is moving from (1,1) to (1,m), he can use the portals. For example, once Megan reaches (1, x), Stanley can teleport there. \n\nWait but Megan has to move first. So the portals are available only up to the point Megan has visited. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal path is when they coordinate their paths such that they can teleport as soon as possible. \n\nAlternatively, the formula's answer for n=1 and m=1e5 is 1e5. How?\n\nThe formula gives (1e5-1)+(0) + 1 \u2192 99999 +1 = 100,000. But the formula is (m-1 + n-1) + min(n, m). \n\nWait 1e5-1 +0 is 99999. Adding min(1, 1e5)=1 \u2192 total 100,000. \n\nBut how is that possible?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nStanley's path: he can move right to (1,m) directly, but that's 99,999 steps. \n\nMegan's path is also moving right to (1,m) in 99,999 steps. So their total is 199,998. But according to the formula, it's 100,000. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula is incorrect here. \n\nWait there must be a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait in this scenario, Megan leaves portals in every cell she visits. So when she is moving along the path, the portals are getting placed. \n\nStanley can use the portals once they are placed. So, for example, suppose Megan moves first. \n\nSuppose Megan moves all the way to the end first. Then Stanley can teleport there. \n\nWait Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1, m). So she has to take m-1 steps. \n\nOnce she reaches (1,m), that cell has a portal. \n\nSo Stanley can start moving, but if Megan moves first, then:\n\nMegan's path is 99,999 steps. \n\nStanley can start by moving to (1,1), then use the portal to jump to (1,m) once Megan has placed it. But Megan needs to reach (1,m) first. \n\nSo Stanley would have to wait until Megan arrives there. \n\nWait but the problem says they can choose the time they move. Time doesn't affect energy. So the order of their moves doesn't matter in terms of energy, but the portals are placed in the cells Megan visits. So whenever Megan visits a cell, that cell has a portal. \n\nTherefore, when Stanley is at a cell with a portal (which Megan has already visited), he can use it to teleport to any other portal cell. \n\nSo in the case of n=1 and m=1e5, the optimal path could be:\n\nMegan's path: she goes straight to (1, m). That takes 99999 steps. \n\nStanley's path:\n\nHe can move to (1,1) (he starts there) then use the portal at (1,1) (since Megan started there) to teleport to (1, m), which has a portal only after Megan arrives. \n\nWait but Megan hasn't been to (1,m) yet until the end of her path. \n\nSo for Stanley to teleport to (1,m), Megan must have already been there. So the earliest he can do that is after Megan reaches (1,m). \n\nSo Stanley would have to move to some cell where there's a portal, and then teleport to (1,m) once Megan is there. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal path is:\n\nStanley takes the first step to (1,2) (using 1 step), then uses a portal (since Megan has passed there) to jump to (1,m). \n\nWait but Megan has to have gone through (1,2). \n\nWait the path of Megan is moving from (1,1) to (1,2) to ... to (1, m). So each step she takes adds a portal. \n\nSo whenever Megan is at (1, x), that cell has a portal. \n\nSo Stanley can at any time move to a cell that Megan has already passed (along her path) and use the portal there to jump to (1,m), provided Megan has reached (1,m). \n\nSo perhaps the optimal path is:\n\nMegan moves to (1, m) in m-1 steps. \n\nStanley's path: \n\nHe can move to (1,1) (starting point), then use the portal at (1,1) to jump to (1,m) once Megan has been there. But until Megan reaches (1,m), that cell doesn't have a portal. \n\nAlternatively, he can move along with Megan's path. \n\nWait, the problem allows them to move in any order, but the portals are placed whenever Megan visits a cell. \n\nSo to minimize the total energy, perhaps they can synchronize their paths such that Stanley can teleport early. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total is indeed the formula given. \n\nWait in the case n=1, m=1e5, the formula gives 1e5. \n\nThe total energy would be:\n\nStanley's energy: 1 (moving to (1,2), then teleport to (1,m) when Megan arrives there. Wait but how does that work?\n\nWait maybe the minimal path for Stanley is:\n\nHe moves to (1, x), where Megan has passed through, then uses the portal to teleport to (1,m) as soon as Megan is there. \n\nBut the total steps for Stanley would be: the steps to reach (1,x) plus 1 for the teleport. \n\nBut Megan must have already been to (1,m), so the teleport can only happen after Megan's full journey. \n\nWait that might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. \n\nWait, since Megan is moving from (1,1) to (1, m), the portals are along her path. So when Megan is at position x, that cell has a portal. \n\nSuppose Megan and Stanley take turns moving such that Megan leaves portals as she goes. \n\nStanley can start by moving right, and whenever he steps onto a portal (Megan has been there), he can teleport to any other portal. \n\nWait the key is that Megan can choose her path to optimize the portal placement. \n\nAh! Megan can choose any path she wants. So she doesn't have to go straight. She can choose a path that allows both to use portals early. \n\nAh, so the formula's approach might be based on choosing the best path for Megan such that the combined energy is minimized. \n\nThe formula (n + m - 2) + min(n, m) might be derived from the best possible path where Megan's path is such that they can save min(n, m) steps. \n\nWait the original code's formula is (m-1 + n-1) + min(n, m). Which is exactly (n + m - 2) + min(n, m). \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal added term comes from the best possible point where they can teleport. \n\nSuppose that the minimal distance between their paths is min(n, m). \n\nWait perhaps the formula is derived as follows: \n\nThe total distance without any portals is 2*(n+m-2). \n\nThe minimal saving they can get is (n + m - 2) \u2014 since they can use a portal once. \n\nWait no, perhaps the formula is the sum of the Manhattan distances plus the minimal of n and m? No, that's not. \n\nAlternatively, the formula could be (total steps without portals) - (some savings) = ( (n+m-2)*2 ) - (something). \n\nThe formula given is (n+m-2) + min(n,m). So the total is (n+m-2) plus min(n,m). Which is less than the original sum. \n\nWait if the formula gives 15 for the sample, which is correct. \n\nAnother test case where n=3, m=3. The formula gives 3+3-2 +3 \u2192 4+3 =7. \n\nLet's see. \n\nStanley's Manhattan is 4 (3+3-2), Megan's is also 4. Total would be 8. But with the formula it's 7. \n\nHow? \n\nSuppose Megan chooses a path that allows them to save a step. Let's say Megan goes up to (1,1) first, then to (1,3), then to (1,3). No, perhaps a different path. \n\nWait Megan starts at (3,1), needs to reach (1,3). \n\nSuppose Megan moves up to (2,1), then to (1,1), then right to (1,3). \n\nHer path length is 2 (up steps) + 2 (right steps) \u2192 total 4. \n\nStanley's path: he starts at (1,1). His destination is (3,3). \n\nHe can use the portal at (1,1) whenever Megan has placed it. \n\nWait Megan places a portal at (1,1) when she arrives there. So once she is there, Stanley can teleport to any portal. \n\nSuppose Stanley's path is: move down to (2,1), then (3,1), then right to (3,3). That would take 2 (down) + 2 (right) \u2192 4 steps. \n\nBut if he uses the portal: \n\nHe starts at (1,1). He can teleport to any portal Megan has placed. \n\nMegan's path includes (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). So when Megan reaches (1,1), he can choose to teleport to (1,3) (once Megan has gone there). \n\nHmm, but Megan's path must reach (1,3) for that to be a portal. \n\nAlternatively, if Megan chooses to go to (1,3) via a path that allows Stanley to use a portal early. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal steps saved is (n+m-2) minus the formula's total? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula's logic is that the minimal total is the sum of the Manhattan distances minus (the minimal path where they can meet and teleport once). \n\nHmm, maybe the minimal total is (Manhattan of Stanley) + (Manhattan of Megan) - (the minimal distance between their paths). \n\nThe minimal distance between their paths could be the minimal between the Manhattan of their starting points and destinations? \n\nWait, for example, in the sample case, the minimal distance between paths might be 5 (the min of 7 and 5). \n\nAlternatively, the formula seems to work for the test cases, so perhaps the code is correct and the initial approach is okay. \n\nTherefore, the original code provided may be correct, but let me check the problem again. \n\nWait the problem says Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So every cell on Megan's path has a portal. \n\nSo the optimal path is when they use the portals optimally. The formula's answer is correct. \n\nThus, the code provided may already be correct, but the user is asking to complete the code. Wait the initial code's Query function has the formula as (m-1)+(n-1) + Math.Min(n, m). \n\nWait in the code, the initial code's Query function has that. But why? Let me re-express the problem. \n\nThe minimal total energy required for both to reach their destinations using the portals optimally. \n\nThe formula seems to hold for the sample and other cases I tried. Thus the code may be correct. But why?\n\nPerhaps the minimal total is (Stanley's distance) + (Megan's distance) - (something). \n\nWait the formula is ( (n-1)+(m-1) ) + (n+m-2) - (something else?), no. \n\nWait no, the formula is (m-1 + n-1) + min(n,m). So the total is (n+m-2) + min(n,m). \n\nWait for the case n=3 and m=3, that gives 3+3-2=4 plus 3 \u2192 7, which is 7. \n\nThe sum of their Manhattan distances would be (4+4) =8. So the formula subtracts 1. \n\nSo the savings are 1. So saving 1 step. \n\nWhere does that come from? Maybe the portal allows them to save one step? \n\nAlternatively, the formula might be derived as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is (Stanley's distance) + (Megan's distance) - (the distance between their paths). \n\nThe distance between their paths is the minimal between n and m. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal energy is the sum of their Manhattan distances minus the minimal of the Manhattan between their starting points and destinations? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal path is when one of them uses a portal once to save (min(n, m) -1) steps? \n\nHmm, maybe the formula is correct. \n\nThus, the code seems to be correct. So perhaps the given code is correct and the problem is solved. \n\nWait the user's instruction says to complete the code. The code provided has the Query function with that formula. \n\nWait but the user is asking to complete the code to solve the problem. So the code is probably correct. \n\nWait looking at the code: \n\nIn the Query function, the code returns:\n\nif n==1 and m==1 \u2192 0. \n\nElse, ans = (m-1)+(n-1) + Math.Min(n,m). \n\nWait, but what about when n=1 and m=2? Then the formula gives (1-1)+(2-1) +1 \u2192 0 +1 +1 =2. Which is correct. \n\nWhen n=2 and m=1? Then n=2, m=1. \n\nThe formula gives (0)+(1) +1 \u2192 0+1=1 plus 1 \u2192 2. \n\nMegan's path is from (2,1) to (1,1). Her Manhattan distance is 1 (moving up). Stanley's is from (1,1) to (2,1), which is 1. So total 2. Which matches. \n\nSo yes, the formula seems correct. \n\nThus, the initial code is correct. But why is the user asking to complete the code? Maybe there was an error in the code's Query function? \n\nWait looking back at the problem's input specification, each test case has two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 1e5). So the code is handling that. \n\nWait maybe the initial code has a mistake in the formula. \n\nWait the problem says \"minimum total energy needed for them both to do that\". \n\nThe formula in the code is (m-1)+(n-1) + min(n, m). \n\nWait in the first case, that was correct. \n\nBut let's think of n=2 and m=3. \n\nFormula gives (2-1)+(3-1) +2 \u2192 1+2+2=5. \n\nWhat's the actual answer? \n\nStanley's path from (1,1) to (2,3): Manhattan is 2+2 (down once, right twice \u2192 steps 3?), no. Wait Manhattan distance between (1,1) and (2,3) is (2-1)+(3\u20131) =1+2=3 steps. Megan's path from (2,1) to (1,3): Manhattan is (2-1)+(3-1) =1+2 =3 steps. Total without portals is 6. But formula gives 5. \n\nSo the savings are 1. So they must save one step somehow. \n\nHow?\n\nMegan can choose a path that allows a portal to be used. \n\nSuppose Megan's path is: she goes from (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,3). \n\nHer path length is 1 (up) + 2 (right) \u2192 total of 3 steps. \n\nStanley's path: he can go from (1,1) to (2,3). \n\nHe can move down to (2,1), then right twice. That's 3 steps. \n\nAlternatively, when Megan reaches (1,1), that cell has a portal. So Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) (once Megan has gone there). \n\nWait Megan's path reaches (1,3) at step 3. \n\nSo Stanley can take this path: \n\nHe goes from (1,1) to (1,3) via teleport once Megan is there. \n\nWait he can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3) once Megan has visited (1,3). \n\nSo that would save him the steps from (1,1) to (1,3) (2 steps). He would only pay 1 unit (the teleport). \n\nSo his path would be: \n\nHe moves down to (2,1) \u2192 that's 1 step. Then teleport to (1,3) (using the portal there, which Megan placed when she went there). \n\nThen from (1,3) he needs to go to (2,3) \u2192 1 step down. \n\nTotal steps for Stanley: 1 (down) + 1 (teleport) +1 (down) \u2192 total 3? \n\nWait no. Wait, when he is at (2,1), can he use a portal? \n\nThe portals Megan has placed are along her path. \n\nAt (2,1), there is a portal (since Megan started there). \n\nSo he can teleport from (2,1) to any other portal. \n\nMegan's path includes (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). \n\nSo when Megan is at (1,3), that cell has a portal. \n\nSo Stanley can go from (2,1) \u2192 teleport to (1,3). That uses 1 unit for teleport. \n\nThen he moves down to (2,3) \u2192 1 step. \n\nTotal steps for Stanley: \n\nMoving to (2,1): 1 (down from start). \n\nTeleport: 1. \n\nMove down 1 step. \n\nTotal 3. \n\nMegan's steps are 3. \n\nTotal 3+3=6? Wait no, that's the same as original. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps a better path. \n\nAlternatively, Megan chooses a different path. \n\nSuppose Megan goes from (2,1) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (1,3). \n\nHer steps: 2 right steps, then 1 up. Total 3 steps. \n\nThen Stanley can do this: \n\nHe goes from (1,1) \u2192 down to (2,1) (step 1). \n\nThen teleport to (2,3) (since Megan has visited that cell). \n\nThen move down to (2,3) is destination? Wait no, Stanley's destination is (2,3). So after teleporting, he's there. So total steps: 1 (down) + 1 (teleport) \u2192 2 steps. \n\nThen Megan's steps are 3. \n\nTotal 2+3=5 \u2192 which matches the formula. \n\nAh, that's how. \n\nSo Megan's path allows Stanley to teleport to (2,3), which is his destination, saving steps. \n\nSo Megan's path includes (2,3), so Stanley can teleport there once Megan has visited. \n\nThus, the formula holds. \n\nSo the code is correct. Therefore, the given code is correct. \n\nThe user's question says to complete the code. But the code provided already has the Query function with that formula. Hmm. \n\nWait looking at the code: \n\nIn the Query function:\n\nlong ans = (m - 1) + (n - 1) + Math.Min(n, m);\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nWait let me see. The problem states that both have to reach their destinations. \n\nThe formula adds the Manhattan distances (m-1)+(n-1) which is the sum of the two Manhattan distances (each's distance). Wait no. \n\nWait Stanley's Manhattan distance is (n-1)+(m-1). Megan's is also (n-1)+(m-1). \n\nSo total would be 2*(n+m-2). \n\nThe formula in the code is (n-1 + m-1) + min(n, m) \u2192 which is (n+m-2) + min(n,m). \n\nSo this is less than the sum of their Manhattan by (n+m-2). \n\nWait so the formula is taking Stanley's distance plus Megan's distance minus (n+m-2) plus min(n,m). \n\nHmm, not sure, but the cases check out. \n\nThus the code as provided is correct, so the missing code is nothing? \n\nWait the user says \"complete the code in csharp to solve this programming problem\". The given code has the Query function with that formula. \n\nWait perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the initial code had a mistake and I have to correct it. \n\nWait let's re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe total energy is the sum of both energies. \n\nThe note in the first test case: \n\nThe total energy is 15. \n\nThe code's formula gives (7-1)+(5-1) + min(7,5) \u2192 (6 +4) +5 = 15. So that's correct. \n\nAnother example: n=2, m=3 \u2192 formula gives (1+2) +2 \u21923+2=5, which matches the correct scenario. \n\nSo I think the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the user's initial code is already correct, and there's no missing code? \n\nWait the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly\". \n\nAh, maybe the initial code has a mistake. Let me look carefully. \n\nThe code's Query function has:\n\nlong ans = (m - 1) + (n - 1) + Math.Min(n, m);\n\nWait, the first two terms are (m-1)+(n-1), which is the Manhattan for one of them. Because Stanley's distance is (n-1 + m-1). Megan's is also the same. So the first part of the formula is one Manhattan distance, then adding the min. \n\nThus the formula is (Manhattan distance of one person) + min(n,m). \n\nWhich would be (n+m-2) + min(n, m). \n\nWait for n=7 and m=5: 7+5-2 =10 plus5 gives 15, which is correct. \n\nBut for the case when n=2 and m=3, the formula gives 5, which is correct. \n\nBut why is this the correct formula? It seems to combine one person's Manhattan with min(n,m). \n\nThe reason must be that the minimal total is indeed that. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nBut why the user is asking to complete the code? Maybe the initial code had a different formula and the user wants to replace it. \n\nLooking back at the code provided: \n\nThe code's Query function has the formula as (m-1)+(n-1)+Math.Min(n,m). \n\nSo perhaps there's no missing code. \n\nWait the user's code is correct, so perhaps the code is correct and there's nothing to fix. \n\nWait the problem's note says that in the first test case, their total energy is 15. Which matches the formula. \n\nSo I think the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that there is no missing code, but maybe the initial code was missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the original code had a mistake in the formula. For example, maybe the formula should be (n-1)+(m-1) + min(n,m)*2? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a case where the formula is incorrect. \n\nWait when n=1 and m=2, the formula gives 2, which is correct. But let's think of n=3 and m=2. \n\nn=3, m=2. \n\nFormula: (2-1)+(3-1) + 2 \u2192 1+2+2=5. \n\nWhat is the correct answer?\n\nStanley's path is from (1,1) to (3,2). Manhattan is 2 (down) +1 (right) \u21923 steps. \n\nMegan's path is from (3,1) to (1,2). Manhattan: 2 up steps and 1 right \u2192 total3 steps. \n\nTotal:6. Formula gives 5. \n\nHmm, discrepancy. \n\nWait let's see. \n\nFormula gives 5. \n\nSo how to achieve 5 total steps? \n\nLet me think of their paths. \n\nMegan can choose a path to create portals that let them save steps. \n\nSuppose Megan's path is (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). Her steps are 2 up +1 right \u21923 steps. \n\nThen Stanley's path:\n\nHe starts at (1,1). His destination is (3,2). \n\nHe can go down to (2,1) (1 step). \n\nThen teleport to (1,2) (since Megan has been there). That uses 1 step. \n\nThen from (1,2), he can go down to (3,2) \u21922 steps. \n\nTotal steps:1 +1 (teleport) +2 =4. \n\nMegan's steps:3 \u2192 total 7. Not better. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better path for Megan. \n\nSuppose Megan goes to (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2). \n\nHer path is right then up twice \u2192 steps 1+2 =3. \n\nStanley's path:\n\nHe needs to go to (3,2). \n\nHe can go down twice to (3,1) (2 steps). \n\nThen teleport to (3,2) (which Megan visited). \n\nTotal steps:2 (down) +1 (teleport) \u21923 steps. \n\nTotal is 3+3=6 steps. Still not 5. \n\nHmm, so what's the issue here. \n\nThe formula says 5. \n\nHmm, so the formula must be wrong. \n\nWait what's the minimal possible? \n\nWait maybe the minimal total is 5. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nSuppose Megan's path is (3,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). \n\nSteps: 2 up, then right \u2192 3 steps. \n\nStanley's path: \n\nHe starts at (1,1). \n\nHe needs to go to (3,2). \n\nHe can teleport from (1,1) to (3,1) (Megan started there, so portal is there) \u21921 step. \n\nThen moving right to (3,2) \u21921 step. Total steps:1 (teleport) +1 \u21922. \n\nMegan's steps 3 \u2192 total 5. \n\nYes! \n\nAh, right! \n\nSo Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (3,1) (since Megan has already been there). \n\nThen he moves right to (3,2). \n\nThus, Stanley's path is teleport (cost 1) plus 1 step \u2192 total 2. \n\nMegan's path is 3 steps. \n\nTotal 5. \n\nYes, that works. \n\nAh, so the formula is correct. \n\nSo in this case, the formula gives 5, which is correct. \n\nSo the formula works. \n\nThus the initial code is correct. \n\nTherefore, there is no missing code. The provided code is already correct. \n\nWait but the user's question says to complete the code. So perhaps there's a missing part in the code. \n\nLooking back at the initial code provided by the user:\n\nIn the Scanner class's Next() function, there's a comment: /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\nAh! Right. The Scanner class's Next() function has incomplete code. \n\nThe Scanner's Next() function is supposed to read the next token, but the code inside the while loop is empty. \n\nThe code for Next() is: \n\npublic string Next()\n{\n    if (_index >= _line.Length)\n    {\n        string s;\n        do\n        {\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n        } while (s.Length == 0);\n\n        _line = s.Split(Separator);\n        _index = 0;\n    }\n\n    return _line[_index++];\n}\n\nThe \"TODO\" is where the code to read the next line should be. \n\nAh! That's the missing code. \n\nThe user's code has an incomplete Scanner class, which is necessary to read the inputs. \n\nSo the missing code is the part inside the do-while loop in the Next() method. \n\nThe code inside the do-while loop should read a line from the input. \n\nThe standard code for the Scanner's Next() function's missing part would be:\n\ns = Console.ReadLine();\n\nSo the complete Next() function would be:\n\npublic string Next()\n{\n    if (_index >= _line.Length)\n    {\n        string s;\n        do\n        {\n            s = Console.ReadLine();\n        } while (s.Length == 0);\n\n        _line = s.Split(Separator);\n        _index = 0;\n    }\n\n    return _line[_index++];\n}\n\nThus, the missing code is s = Console.ReadLine(); inside the do-while loop. \n\nThe user's code's Scanner's Next() function is missing that line. \n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is the line that reads the input line. \n\nThus, the answer should be that line. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\ns = Console.ReadLine();\n\ninside the do-while loop. \n\nSo the user needs to fill in that line. \n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is the line: \n\ns = Console.ReadLine();\n\nSo the output should be that line."
