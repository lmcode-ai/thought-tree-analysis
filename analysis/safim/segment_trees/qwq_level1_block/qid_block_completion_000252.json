But maybe we can do vertical stripes of two columns. 3 columns can be split into one stripe of two columns and one of one column. But the one column can't be used. Hmm, so in that case, it's not possible. Wait, but in the 3x3 grid, can we partition into regions that meet the condition? Suppose we have three vertical stripes of one column each. Each column is a region. But each cell in a column has two vertical neighbors (since n=3, so each cell has two vertical neighbors in the same column). So for a column of three cells, each cell has two vertical neighbors in the same column, and the horizontal neighbors (left and right columns). So, for a cell in the first column, its horizontal neighbors are columns 2 and 3. If those are different colors, then the cell has two same (vertical) and two different (horizontal). That's only two same, which is insufficient. So that's bad.",

So the problem reduces to: \n\nIf we choose to partition into horizontal stripes (when n even), then each stripe has size 2*m. We need to have enough pigments such that the sum of (a_i) > = (n/2)*2*m = n*m (which is already true if sum a_i >= n*m), but also, each stripe must be assigned to a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. Wait, no. Each stripe must be assigned to a pigment with a_i >= its size (2*m). So the total number of stripes is (n/2). Each stripe requires a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. But the same pigment can be used for multiple stripes, as long as the sum of their sizes is <= a_i. Wait, no. Because each stripe is a separate entity. Wait, the stripes are separate regions. Each stripe can be assigned to a pigment, but the total assigned to a pigment can't exceed a_i. Wait, the assignment is: each stripe is assigned to a pigment, and the sum of the sizes of stripes assigned to pigment j must be <= a_j. Thus, the problem becomes: can we partition the stripes into groups, each group assigned to a pigment, such that the sum of the group's stripe sizes is <= a_j for that pigment. The total sum of all stripes is n*m, so the sum of a_i's must be >= n*m. Additionally, each stripe's size must be <= the a_i of the pigment it is assigned to. Wait, but the stripe's size is 2*m (for horizontal stripes). Thus, for each stripe, the pigment assigned to it must have a_i >= 2*m. Wait, no. Because the stripe's size is 2*m, so the pigment assigned to it must have a_i >= 2*m. Wait, because the stripe's size is 2*m, so the pigment must have at least that much. Thus, the problem requires that there exists a way to assign each stripe to a pigment such that each stripe's size is <= the pigment's a_i. Therefore, the total number of stripes (n/2) must be covered by pigments where each stripe is assigned to a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. Wait, but the same pigment can be used for multiple stripes as long as the sum of their sizes is <= a_i. Ah, right! So for example, if a pigment has a_i = 4*m, then it can cover two stripes of size 2*m each. Thus, the problem reduces to: \n\nThe total number of stripes (n/2) multiplied by the stripe size (2*m) must be <= sum of a_i's. Wait, but that's already true because the total area is n*m. Wait, the sum of the stripe sizes is exactly n*m. So the sum of a_i's must be >= n*m. But also, the maximum stripe size (2*m) must be <= the maximum a_i. Wait, no. Because if all stripes are assigned to a single pigment with a_i >= n*m, then that's okay. Alternatively, the maximum stripe size must be <= the maximum a_i. Wait, no. Because if the stripes are assigned to multiple pigments, each stripe's size must be <= the a_i of its assigned pigment. Thus, the maximum stripe size must be <= the maximum a_i. Wait, because if the maximum stripe size is S, then there must be at least one pigment with a_i >= S. \n\nWait, no. Suppose there are two stripes of size S each, and two pigments each with a_i = S. Then each stripe can be assigned to a different pigment. Thus, the maximum a_i must be at least the maximum stripe size.",

So, the check function's logic would be: \n\nbool check(int n, int m) { \n\n    // Check if any a_i >= n*m (single color case) \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=k; i++) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= n*m) return true; \n\n    } \n\n    // Now check the partitioning case in this direction (horizontal) \n\n    if (n % 2 != 0) return false; // n must be even \n\n    // stripe size is 2*m \n\n    int stripe_size = 2 * m; \n\n    // check if there exists a pigment with a_i >= stripe_size \n\n    bool has_pigment = false; \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=k; i++) { if (a[i] >= stripe_size) { \n\n            has_pigment = true; \n\n            break; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    if (!has_pigment) return false; \n\n    // Also check that the sum of a_i >= n*m \n\n    long long total = 0; \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=k; i++) total += a[i]; \n\n    if (total < n * (long long)m) return false; \n\n    return true; \n\n} Wait, but the sum check is needed for both cases. Wait, in the first case (single color), the sum is automatically >= n*m because one a_i is >= n*m. In the partitioning case, the sum must be >= n*m.",

So the code for check would be as above. But in the code provided, the a array is global. Wait, the code's check function has access to the a array. So the code for check would be: \n\nbool check(int n, int m) { \n\n    // Check if any a_i >= n*m \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { if (a[i] >= 1LL * n * m) { \n\n            return true; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    // Check if partitioning is possible in this direction (horizontal) \n\n    if (n % 2 != 0) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    int stripe_size = 2 * m; \n\n    bool has_pigment = false; \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= stripe_size) { \n\n            has_pigment = true; \n\n            break; \n\n        } \n\n    } if (!has_pigment) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    // Check sum \n\n    long long total = 0; \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        total += a[i]; \n\n    } \n\n    if (total < 1LL * n * m) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    return true; \n\n} Wait, but the stripe_size is 2*m, and the number of stripes is n/2. Each stripe has size 2*m. The total area is (n/2)*2*m = n*m. Thus, the sum of a_i must be >= n*m. So the check for the sum is needed. Thus, this code would handle the horizontal case. Then, when the solve function calls check(n, m) || check(m, n), the second check(m, n) would handle the vertical case. Wait, in check(m, n), the parameters are swapped. Wait, the check function is called with (m, n) in the second call. So in that case, the first part checks if any a_i > = m*n (same as n*m). Then, the second part checks if m is even (since the first parameter is m now). stripe_size would be 2 * n (since the second parameter is n). Thus, the vertical case is handled. Thus, this code should work. Now, let's test this logic against the sample inputs. Sample Input 3: \n\nSuppose the third test case has n and m such that the entire grid can be colored with pigment 1. In that case, the first check (any a_i >= n*m) would return true, so the function returns yes. Another test case where n is even and m is even, but no a_i is large enough for the entire grid, but there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*m (for horizontal) and sum a_i >= n*m. Thus, the check would return true. Edge case: n=3, m=3. Then, neither n nor m is even. Thus, the only way is to have a pigment with a_i >= 9. If that exists, then yes. Else, no. Another case: n=4, m=3. Then, n is even. stripe_size is 2*3=6. We need a pigment with a_i >=6. Suppose a has a pigment with 6, and sum is 6 + ... > = 12. Then yes. Thus, the code should handle this. Now, the code in the problem's template has the check function to be filled. Thus, the missing code for check is as above. But in code, the variables are: \n\nThe a array is global. The function parameters are n and m. The code must loop through the a array to check for the first condition. Then check if n is even. Then check if any a_i >= 2*m. Then check the sum. Thus, the code for check is as written above. Now, in code, the variables are: \n\nThe a array is declared as int a[N], and k is a global variable. Wait, looking at the code given: \n\nThe code has: \n\nconst int N = 100005; \n\nint a[N], k; \n\nbool check(int n, int m) { \n\n    ... \n\n} \n\nvoid solve() { \n\n    int n, m; \n\n    std::cin >> n >> m >> k; \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=k; ++i) \n\n        std::cin >> a[i]; \n\n    std::cout << ((check(n, m) || check(m, n)) ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << '\\n'; \n\n} \n\nWait, the variable k is declared as a global variable. In the solve function, after reading k, it's stored in the global variable. Thus, in the check function, the k is accessible. Thus, the code for check is as I wrote. But in code, the loop for checking a[i] >= n*m must be in the check function. Thus, the code for check is as follows. Now, the code must also handle large numbers. The product n*m can be up to 1e9 * 1e9 = 1e18, which is larger than 2e9, so we need to use 64-bit integers. Thus, in the first loop, comparing a[i] (which is up to 1e9) to n*m (up to 1e18), we need to cast to long long. Thus, the condition should be: \n\nif (a[i] >= 1LL * n * m) \n\nSimilarly for the total sum. Thus, the code should be written with those considerations. Thus, the complete check function is as I outlined. So the missing code for check is: \n\nbool check(int n, int m) { \n\n    // Check if any a_i can cover the entire grid \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= 1LL * n * m) { \n\n            return true; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    // Check if partitioning into horizontal stripes (n even) is possible \n\n    if (n % 2 != 0) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    int stripe_size = 2 * m; \n\n    bool has_pigment = false; \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= stripe_size) { \n\n            has_pigment = true; \n\n            break; \n\n        } \n\n    } if (!has_pigment) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    // Check total sum \n\n    long long total = 0; \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        total += a[i]; \n\n    } \n\n    if (total < 1LL * n * m) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    return true; \n\n} \n\nThis should be the code for the check function. Now, let's see if there are any other edge cases. Test case where n=2, m=2. Then, n is even. stripe_size is 4. If a has a pigment with 4, and sum is 4, then yes. Another case where n=2, m=3. stripe_size is 6. If a has a pigment with 6, and sum is 6, then yes. Another case where n=4, m=4. Either direction works. stripe_size for horizontal is 8. If a has a pigment with 8, and sum is 16, then yes. Thus, the code should handle these cases. Thus, the missing code is as above.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the check function in this C++ code. The problem is about determining if it's possible to color an n x m grid with given pigments such that each cell has at least 3 toroidal neighbors of the same color. \n\nHmm, first, let's understand the toroidal neighbor condition. Each cell has exactly four neighbors, right? Because the grid wraps around both top/bottom and left/right. So for a cell to have at least 3 neighbors of the same color, it must have at least three of its four neighbors in the same color. \n\nWait, but how can that be arranged? Maybe the entire grid has to be colored in a way that large regions of the same color are formed. Like, maybe the entire grid is one color? Let me think. If all cells are the same color, then each cell has all four neighbors the same, so that would satisfy the condition. But the problem allows using multiple colors as long as each cell meets the condition. \n\nBut the key is the constraints on the pigments. Each pigment can be used up to a_i cells. So the sum of all a_i must be at least n*m, but that's necessary but not sufficient. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that each cell has at least 3 neighbors of the same color. So perhaps the coloring must be such that each color is used in regions where every cell in that region has at least three neighbors also in the region. \n\nHmm, maybe the only way this can be done is if the color regions form a pattern where each cell is part of a sufficiently large block. Alternatively, maybe the entire grid must be colored with a single color? Let me think. \n\nSuppose the entire grid is one color. Then each cell has four neighbors of the same color, which satisfies the condition. So in that case, if there exists a pigment with a_i >= n*m, then the answer is yes. But maybe there are other possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid can be divided into 2x2 blocks, but I'm not sure. Wait, let's think of possible patterns. \n\nAnother thought: For each cell to have at least three neighbors of the same color, the color must be arranged such that each cell is in a \"majority\" in its neighborhood. \n\nWait, perhaps the coloring must be such that each color is used in a checkerboard pattern? No, because in a checkerboard, each cell has two neighbors of the same color and two of another. That would not satisfy the condition. \n\nHmm, maybe the only possible way is that the entire grid is a single color. Because otherwise, how can each cell have three same-colored neighbors? Let me see. \n\nSuppose there are two colors. Let's say a cell is color A. To have three neighbors of A, three of its four neighbors must also be A. But then those neighbors would also need to have three A neighbors, leading to a large contiguous region. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid can be partitioned into regions where each region is a rectangle of size at least 2x2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid must be colored in such a way that each color forms a \"strip\" that's at least two rows or columns thick. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the grid can be tiled in a way that each color's regions are such that every cell has at least three neighbors of the same color. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that the grid can be colored with colors such that each color is used in a way that every cell of that color has at least three neighbors of the same color. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal case is when a color is used in a 2x2 block. Let's see: in a 2x2 block, each cell has two neighbors in the block (since the other two are outside). But that's only two, which is insufficient. So that's not enough. \n\nHmm, maybe the color regions must be at least 3x3? Let's see. For a cell in the center of a 3x3 block, all four neighbors are in the block. But for a cell on the edge of a 3x3 block, maybe? Wait, in a 3x3 block, the corner cells would have two neighbors in the block. Hmm, maybe that's not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way to satisfy the condition is that the entire grid is a single color. Because otherwise, any cell on the boundary between two colors would have fewer than three neighbors of the same color. \n\nWait, let's think of a possible scenario where two colors are used. Suppose the grid is divided into two equal parts. For example, if the grid is even in both dimensions, maybe split into two halves. But then cells on the boundary between the two halves would have two neighbors of each color. So that's not enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid is colored in stripes. For example, vertical stripes of width 2. Each cell in a stripe would have two neighbors in the same stripe (left and right), but the top and bottom would depend on the stripe's vertical arrangement. Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the grid is colored in a way that each color is used in a region where every cell has at least three neighbors of the same color. The simplest way is to have the entire grid one color. \n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to checking if there exists a pigment with a_i >= n*m. But the problem allows using multiple colors as long as each cell meets the condition. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Let me think of a 3x3 grid. Suppose all cells are color A except the center. The center is color B. Then the center cell has four neighbors of A, so that's okay. But the corner cells of A have three A neighbors (since their other neighbor is the center, which is B). Wait, let's see: a corner cell in a 3x3 grid has neighbors: for example, (1,1) has neighbors (2,1), (1,2), (3,1) (due to toroidal), and (1,3). Wait, in a 3x3 grid, (1,1)'s neighbors are (2,1), (3,1), (1,2), (1,3). So if the center (2,2) is B, then the corner (1,1) has three A neighbors (the other three are A except the center?), no. Wait, the center is (2,2). The corner (1,1) has neighbors (2,1) (A?), (3,1) (A?), (1,2) (A?), and (1,3) (A?), so all four are A except if the center is part of their neighbors? Wait no, the center is (2,2), so (1,1)'s neighbors are (2,1), (3,1), (1,2), (1,3). So all those are A except if any of them are B. So in this case, the corner cells have four A neighbors, so that's okay. The center cell (2,2) has four A neighbors, so that's okay. Wait, but in this case, the center is B, so its four neighbors are A. So the center cell would have zero B neighbors, which violates the condition. So that's bad. \n\nHmm, so that arrangement doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a checkerboard pattern with three colors? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only possible way is that all cells are the same color. Because otherwise, any cell on the boundary between two colors would have at most two neighbors of its own color. \n\nWait, let's think of a 4x4 grid. Suppose we color it in a 2x2 block pattern. Like, each 2x2 block is a different color. Then each cell in a 2x2 block has two neighbors of the same color (the other cell in the block's row and column?), but the other two neighbors are from adjacent blocks. So that would give only two same-colored neighbors, which is insufficient. \n\nHmm, so maybe the only way is to have the entire grid in one color. \n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to checking if there exists a pigment with a_i >= n*m. But the problem's sample input 3 says that in the third test case, they can color all cells with pigment 1. So that would be the case where a_1 >= n*m. \n\nWait, but the problem's output is \"Yes\" if possible. So the check function must determine whether there exists a color with a_i >= n*m, or perhaps some other condition. \n\nWait, but the problem's note says that in the third test case, all cells are colored with pigment 1. So that's the case where a_1 is at least n*m. \n\nBut what about other possibilities? Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the grid is 2x2. Wait, but the constraints say n and m are at least 3. So the minimal grid is 3x3. \n\nWait, in a 3x3 grid, if all cells are color A, then each cell has four neighbors of the same color. So that works. \n\nAnother scenario: suppose the grid is 4x4. Suppose we use two colors, each in a 2x2 block. Wait, but that's not enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid can be divided into regions where each region is a rectangle of size at least 3x1. For example, in a 3x4 grid, if each column is colored with the same color. Then each cell in a column has two neighbors (up and down) in the same column (since it's 3 rows, so each cell has two vertical neighbors in the same column, plus the left and right. Wait, in a column of 3 rows, each cell has two vertical neighbors (since it's toroidal). So for a column of 3, each cell has two vertical neighbors (the next and previous rows). So if the column is all the same color, then each cell has two vertical neighbors of the same color, and the left and right cells (same row) would need to be same color as well. \n\nHmm, maybe if the entire row is the same color. Let's see: in a row of m columns, each cell has two horizontal neighbors (left and right) in the same row. So if the entire row is the same color, then each cell in the row has two same-colored neighbors horizontally, but the vertical neighbors (above and below) would depend on the rows above and below. \n\nSo if all rows are the same color, then each cell has four same-colored neighbors. That works. \n\nAlternatively, if the rows alternate colors, but that might not work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid can be colored in stripes of two rows. For example, two rows of color A, then two rows of color B, etc. But then a cell in the first row of A would have a neighbor below (second row A) and above (last row of the previous stripe, which might be B). So that might not give enough same-colored neighbors. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the only way to satisfy the condition is that all cells are the same color, or arranged in a way that every cell has at least three neighbors of the same color. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grid can be colored in a way that each color forms a \"strip\" of at least two rows or columns. \n\nWait, let's think of a 3x3 grid. Suppose all rows are colored the same. Then each cell has four same-colored neighbors. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, if the grid is colored in a checkerboard pattern with three colors? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the grid can be partitioned into regions where each region is a rectangle of size at least 2x2. Wait, but even a 2x2 region would not satisfy the condition for the corner cells. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal region is a 3x3 block. But then, how to tile the grid with such blocks? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the grid can be colored in a way that each color is used in a region where every cell has at least three neighbors of the same color. The simplest way is to have all cells the same color. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows using two colors, but arranged in a way that each cell has three neighbors of the same color. For example, in a 4x4 grid, if the grid is divided into two 2x2 blocks of color A and two of color B arranged such that each cell has three neighbors of the same color. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the grid can be colored in a way that each color is used in a region that forms a \"dominant\" majority in their neighborhoods. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that each color must be used in a region where the number of cells of that color is at least ceil( (total cells) * 3/4 ), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that each color must be used in a way that every cell of that color has at least three neighbors of the same color. So for a color with c cells, each cell in that color must have at least three neighbors also in that color. \n\nHmm, perhaps the only way this can be done is if the color is used in a region where every cell has at least three neighbors in the same region. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to the following: the grid must be colored with colors such that each color is used in a region that is a \"solid\" block where every cell in the block has at least three neighbors also in the block. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal requirement is that the color is used in a region where every cell has at least three neighbors of the same color. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that each color must be used in a region that is a \"majority\" in its local area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the entire grid is colored with a single color. Because otherwise, any cell on the boundary between two colors would have at most two neighbors of its own color. \n\nWait, let's think of a scenario where two colors are used. Suppose the grid is divided into two equal halves. For example, in a 4x4 grid, the first two rows are color A and the last two rows are color B. \n\nTake a cell in the first row (row 1). Its neighbors are row 2 (A), row 4 (B), and the left/right cells (A). So the cell has three A neighbors (up, down (row 2?), wait, no. Wait, in a 4-row grid, the cell in row 1 has neighbors row 2 (below) and row 4 (above, because it's toroidal). So for a cell in row 1, column 1: \n\nNeighbors are row 2 (same column), row 4 (same column), and columns 2 and 4 (since m=4). \n\nWait, the vertical neighbors are rows 2 and 4 (since 1-2 mod 4? Wait, n is 4 here. So for row 1, the previous row is 4 (since 1-1 mod 4 is 0 mod 4? Wait, the toroidal neighbors for row x are x+1 mod n and x-1 mod n. \n\nWait, the vertical neighbors for a cell (x,y) are (x+1 mod n, y) and (x-1 mod n, y). \n\nSo for row 1, the previous row is 4 (since 1-1 mod 4 is 0, but mod 4, 0 is equivalent to 4?), or maybe mod n gives 0, but since rows are 1-based, perhaps it's (x-1) mod n, but adjusted. \n\nWait, perhaps the vertical neighbors are (x+1) mod n and (x-1) mod n, but since rows are 1-based, when mod n gives 0, it's n. \n\nSo for row 1, the previous row is row 4 (since 1-1 mod 4 is 0 \u2192 4). \n\nSo in the example where first two rows are A and last two are B: \n\nA cell in row 1 has vertical neighbors row 2 (A) and row 4 (B). The horizontal neighbors (columns) depend on the column. \n\nSuppose the columns are all A in the first two rows. \n\nSo for a cell in row 1, column 1: \n\nVertical neighbors: row 2 (A) and row 4 (B). \n\nHorizontal neighbors: column 2 (A) and column 4 (A, since in first two rows, column 4 is A). \n\nWait, in this case, the cell has three A neighbors (row2, column2, column4) and one B (row4). So that's three, which meets the requirement. \n\nThe cell in row 2, column 1: \n\nVertical neighbors are row 1 (A) and row 3 (B). \n\nHorizontal neighbors are columns 2 (A) and column4 (A). \n\nSo three A's and one B. That's okay. \n\nThe cell in row 3, column 1 (B): \n\nVertical neighbors are row 2 (A) and row4 (B). \n\nHorizontal neighbors are columns 2 (B?), assuming the last two rows are all B. \n\nWait, in row3, columns are B. So horizontal neighbors are columns 2 (B) and column4 (B). \n\nSo vertical neighbors: row2 (A) and row4 (B). \n\nSo total same color (B) neighbors: row4 (B), columns 2 and 4 (B). So three B's and one A. That's okay. \n\nSimilarly, row4, column1: \n\nVertical neighbors are row3 (B) and row1 (A). \n\nHorizontal neighbors are columns 2 (B) and 4 (B). \n\nSo three B's and one A. \n\nSo in this case, all cells have three neighbors of their own color. \n\nSo this arrangement works with two colors. \n\nHmm, so the initial assumption that the entire grid must be one color is incorrect. \n\nSo there are other possibilities. \n\nSo how can we model this? \n\nIn this example, the two colors are arranged in two horizontal stripes of two rows each. Each cell in a stripe has three neighbors of the same color. \n\nSo the key here is that each stripe has at least two rows. Because in a two-row stripe, each cell in the first row has a neighbor in the second row (same color), and the other vertical neighbor is from the other stripe. \n\nWait, in the two-row stripe example, each stripe has two rows. So for a cell in the first row of the stripe, the vertical neighbors are the second row (same stripe) and the last row of the other stripe. \n\nSo the vertical neighbors contribute one same color (the second row) and one different. The horizontal neighbors (same row) are all same color. \n\nSo for a cell in a two-row stripe, the horizontal neighbors (left and right) are same color, and one vertical neighbor (the next row) is same, and the other vertical is different. So total of three same. \n\nSo that works. \n\nSimilarly, if the stripe is two columns, then the same applies. \n\nSo the key is that the color is used in a stripe of at least two rows or two columns. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: can the grid be partitioned into regions where each region is a stripe of at least two rows or two columns, and the sum of the a_i's can cover the regions. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal requirement for a color to be used in a stripe of two rows is that the number of cells in that stripe is (2 * m). \n\nWait, but in the example above, each stripe of two rows has 2 * m cells. \n\nSo, for a color to be used in such a stripe, the a_i for that color must be at least 2*m. \n\nAlternatively, if the stripe is two columns, then the required cells are 2*n. \n\nSo, the problem can be approached by considering that the grid can be divided into horizontal or vertical stripes of two or more rows/columns. \n\nWait, but how do we model this for any n and m? \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the grid can be partitioned into regions where each region is a horizontal or vertical stripe of at least two rows or columns. \n\nThe total area must be covered by these regions, and each region's area must be covered by some a_i. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal area for a region is 2*min(n,m). Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nEach color must be assigned to a set of cells such that each cell in the set has at least three neighbors also in the set. \n\nThe simplest way to achieve this is to have regions where each region is a stripe of two or more rows or columns. \n\nSo, for a stripe of two rows, each cell in those rows has three same-colored neighbors (two from the same row, one from the next row). \n\nSimilarly for two columns. \n\nAlternatively, the regions can be of any size as long as they form a contiguous block in rows or columns of at least two. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to partitioning the grid into such regions, and the sum of the a_i's must be at least the total area, and each a_i must be at least the size of the region it's assigned to. \n\nBut how do we model this in code? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal requirement is that the grid can be partitioned into regions where each region has size at least 2*min(n,m) or something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be solved by considering that the minimal required area for a color is 2*min(n, m). Wait, perhaps not. \n\nAlternatively, the key is that each color's region must have an area of at least ceil( (total cells) * 3/4 ), but that might not be the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that the grid can be divided into horizontal or vertical stripes of two rows or columns. \n\nThe total area is n*m. \n\nSuppose we choose to partition the grid into horizontal stripes of two rows each. The number of such stripes would be ceil(n/2). But since n can be even or odd. \n\nWait, for example, if n is even, then n/2 stripes of two rows each. Each stripe has 2*m cells. \n\nIf n is odd, then (n-1)/2 stripes of two rows, and one stripe of 1 row. But a stripe of one row can't be used because each cell in that stripe would have only two same-colored neighbors (the left and right in the row, but the vertical neighbors would be from the previous and next stripes, which may be different). \n\nSo, in that case, the last row can't form a valid region. \n\nTherefore, to partition into horizontal stripes, n must be even. \n\nAlternatively, if n is odd, then we can have (n-1) rows divided into (n-1)/2 stripes of two rows, and the last row can be part of a vertical stripe. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be solved by considering that the grid can be partitioned into horizontal or vertical stripes of two rows or columns, but the total area must be covered. \n\nThe minimal way to do this is to choose between horizontal or vertical partitioning. \n\nFor example, if we choose horizontal partitioning, then the number of rows must be even. Otherwise, it's not possible. \n\nWait, but the problem allows any partitioning as long as each region meets the condition. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be solved by checking whether the grid can be partitioned into regions of size at least 2 rows or 2 columns. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal required for a region is that it has at least two rows or two columns. \n\nSo, the total area can be covered by regions each of which is a horizontal stripe of two rows, or vertical stripe of two columns, etc. \n\nThe key is that each region must have at least two rows or two columns. \n\nTherefore, the total area can be covered as follows: \n\nEither: \n\n- All regions are horizontal stripes of two rows. So n must be even. \n\nOR \n\n- All regions are vertical stripes of two columns. So m must be even. \n\nOR \n\n- A combination of horizontal and vertical stripes. \n\nWait, but even if n is odd, perhaps we can have some vertical stripes. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be solved by considering that the grid can be partitioned into regions where each region is a horizontal or vertical stripe of at least two rows or columns. \n\nThe total area is n*m. \n\nThe minimal way to do this is to have all regions as horizontal or vertical stripes of two rows or columns. \n\nSo, the total area must be covered by such regions. \n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that either n is even or m is even. \n\nWait, no. For example, if n is 3 and m is 3, then we can't partition into horizontal stripes of two rows (since 3 is odd). But maybe we can do vertical stripes of two columns. 3 columns can be split into one stripe of two columns and one of one column. But the one column can't be used. \n\nHmm, so in that case, it's not possible. \n\nWait, but in the 3x3 grid, can we partition into regions that meet the condition? \n\nSuppose we have three vertical stripes of one column each. Each column is a region. But each cell in a column has two vertical neighbors (since n=3, so each cell has two vertical neighbors in the same column). So for a column of three cells, each cell has two vertical neighbors in the same column, and the horizontal neighbors (left and right columns). \n\nSo, for a cell in the first column, its horizontal neighbors are columns 2 and 3. If those are different colors, then the cell has two same (vertical) and two different (horizontal). That's only two same, which is insufficient. \n\nSo that's bad. \n\nAlternatively, if the three columns are all the same color. Then each cell has four same-colored neighbors. That works. \n\nAh, right. So in that case, the entire grid can be one color. \n\nSo the key is that either the entire grid is one color, or it can be partitioned into regions of two or more rows/columns. \n\nWait, but the problem allows using multiple colors as long as each region meets the condition. \n\nSo the problem reduces to two possibilities: \n\nEither: \n\n1. The entire grid is one color. So there exists a pigment with a_i >= n*m. \n\nOR \n\n2. The grid can be partitioned into regions where each region is a horizontal stripe of two or more rows, or a vertical stripe of two or more columns. \n\nWait, but how do we check that? \n\nAlternatively, the second condition can be rephrased as: \n\nThe grid can be partitioned into regions where each region has at least two rows or two columns. \n\nThe total area must be covered. \n\nThe minimal way to do this is to have all regions as horizontal or vertical stripes of two rows or columns. \n\nBut how do we model this? \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be solved by checking whether the grid can be partitioned into regions where each region has an area of at least 2*min(n, m). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be solved by considering that the minimal required for each region is that it has at least two rows or two columns. \n\nTherefore, the total area can be covered by such regions. \n\nThe minimal way to do this is to have all regions as horizontal or vertical stripes of two rows or columns. \n\nSo, the total area must be covered by such regions. \n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that either n is even or m is even. \n\nWait, no. For example, if n is 3 and m is 4. \n\nThen, m is even. So we can partition into vertical stripes of two columns each. \n\n4 columns can be divided into two vertical stripes of two columns each. \n\nEach stripe has 3 rows * 2 columns = 6 cells. \n\nSo each stripe can be a color. \n\nEach cell in a vertical stripe of two columns has two horizontal neighbors (same column?), no. Wait, in a vertical stripe of two columns, each cell has two horizontal neighbors (left and right) within the stripe (since the stripe is two columns). \n\nWait, for a cell in column 1 of a two-column stripe (columns 1 and 2), its horizontal neighbors are columns 2 (same stripe) and column 3 (outside). \n\nWait, the vertical stripe is two columns. So for a cell in column 1, the horizontal neighbors are column 2 (same stripe) and column m (since it's toroidal). Wait, m is 4 here. So column 1's left neighbor is column 4 (since it's toroidal). \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, in a vertical stripe of two columns (columns 1 and 2), each cell in column 1 has a neighbor in column 2 (same stripe) and column 4 (outside). \n\nSo for a cell in column 1, the horizontal neighbors are column 2 (same) and column 4 (different). \n\nThe vertical neighbors are the same row's previous and next rows. \n\nWait, the vertical neighbors are in the same column, so they are in the same stripe. \n\nSo for a cell in column 1, row x: \n\nVertical neighbors are rows x-1 and x+1 (same column, so same stripe). \n\nHorizontal neighbors: column 2 (same stripe) and column 4 (different). \n\nSo the cell has three same-colored neighbors (vertical two and one horizontal) and one different. \n\nThus, this satisfies the condition. \n\nSimilarly for column 2. \n\nSo in this case, the vertical stripes of two columns work. \n\nThus, when m is even, we can partition into vertical stripes of two columns each. \n\nSimilarly, if n is even, we can do horizontal stripes of two rows. \n\nIf both are even, then either way works. \n\nIf neither is even, then we can't do this partitioning. \n\nWait, but what if n and m are both odd? \n\nFor example, n=3, m=3. \n\nThen, neither can be partitioned into even stripes. \n\nBut in this case, the entire grid can be one color. \n\nSo in that case, the first condition (all one color) is needed. \n\nSo the overall conditions are: \n\nEither \n\n1. There exists a pigment with a_i >= n*m, \n\nOR \n\n2. The grid can be partitioned into horizontal or vertical stripes of two rows or columns. \n\nThe second condition is possible if either n is even or m is even. \n\nWait, but if n is even, then horizontal stripes of two rows can be used. \n\nIf m is even, vertical stripes of two columns can be used. \n\nIf neither is even, then the second condition is not possible, so we have to rely on the first condition. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nFor each test case, check whether either: \n\na) There exists a pigment with a_i >= n*m, OR \n\nb) (n is even OR m is even) AND the sum of the a_i's is at least n*m, and also, the maximum a_i is at least the minimal required per stripe. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the second condition requires that the grid can be partitioned into stripes of two rows or columns. \n\nIn that case, the total area is n*m, and each stripe has an area of 2*m (for horizontal stripes of two rows) or 2*n (for vertical stripes of two columns). \n\nWait, for horizontal stripes of two rows: each stripe has 2 rows * m columns = 2m. \n\nThe number of such stripes is n/2 (since n must be even). \n\nThe total area is (n/2)*2m = n*m. \n\nSo the sum of the a_i's must be at least n*m. \n\nBut also, each stripe can be assigned to a pigment. \n\nThe minimal requirement is that the sum of a_i's is at least n*m, and each stripe's area (2m or 2n) must be covered by some a_i. \n\nWait, but the a_i's can be assigned to any stripe. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: \n\nIf condition b) is possible (i.e., n even or m even), then we can partition into stripes of two rows or columns. \n\nIn that case, the required is that the sum of a_i's is at least n*m, and also, the maximum a_i must be at least the size of the largest stripe. \n\nWait, no. Because each stripe can be assigned to a different pigment. \n\nWait, the stripes can be assigned to different pigments. \n\nSo the total sum of a_i's must be >= n*m. \n\nAdditionally, each stripe's area must be <= some a_i. \n\nWait, but the stripes can be assigned to any pigment. \n\nSo the problem is to partition the stripes into groups, each assigned to a pigment, such that the sum of the areas of the stripes in each group is <= a_i for that pigment. \n\nWait, but the stripes can be of varying sizes? No, in the case of horizontal stripes of two rows, each stripe has exactly 2m cells. \n\nSo if n is even, then there are n/2 stripes each of size 2m. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: \n\nWe have a list of stripes, each of size S (either 2m or 2n, depending on the direction chosen). \n\nWe need to assign these stripes to pigments such that for each stripe, its size is <= some a_i, and the sum of all stripe sizes is n*m (which it is). \n\nWait, but the sum is exactly n*m, so the sum of a_i's must be >= n*m. \n\nBut also, each stripe's size must be <= some a_i. \n\nWait, but the stripes can be assigned to different pigments. \n\nSo the necessary and sufficient conditions for case b) are: \n\nEither n is even or m is even, \n\nAND \n\nthe sum of a_i's >= n*m, \n\nAND \n\nthe maximum stripe size (which is 2*max(m, n) ? No, wait, the stripe size is either 2m (if horizontal) or 2n (if vertical). \n\nWait, if we choose to partition into horizontal stripes (when n is even), then each stripe has size 2*m. \n\nThe maximum stripe size is 2*m. \n\nSo for this to be possible, there must exist a pigment with a_i >= 2*m, or the stripes can be split among multiple pigments. \n\nWait, no. Each stripe can be assigned to any pigment, but the sum of the a_i's must be at least the total area. \n\nWait, but the stripes can be assigned to different pigments. \n\nThe problem is that each stripe must be assigned to a pigment whose a_i is at least the stripe's size. \n\nSo for example, if we have stripes of size S, then each stripe must be assigned to a pigment with a_i >= S. \n\nThus, the total number of stripes is (n/2) if we choose horizontal stripes (when n even). \n\nEach of those stripes must be assigned to a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. \n\nAlternatively, the stripes can be assigned to different pigments. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: \n\nIf we choose to partition into horizontal stripes (when n even), then each stripe has size 2*m. \n\nWe need to have enough pigments such that the sum of (a_i) >= (n/2)*2*m = n*m (which is already true if sum a_i >= n*m), but also, each stripe must be assigned to a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. \n\nWait, no. Each stripe must be assigned to a pigment with a_i >= its size (2*m). \n\nSo the total number of stripes is (n/2). \n\nEach stripe requires a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. \n\nBut the same pigment can be used for multiple stripes, as long as the sum of their sizes is <= a_i. \n\nWait, no. Because each stripe is a separate entity. \n\nWait, the stripes are separate regions. Each stripe can be assigned to a pigment, but the total assigned to a pigment can't exceed a_i. \n\nWait, the assignment is: each stripe is assigned to a pigment, and the sum of the sizes of stripes assigned to pigment j must be <= a_j. \n\nThus, the problem becomes: can we partition the stripes into groups, each group assigned to a pigment, such that the sum of the group's stripe sizes is <= a_j for that pigment. \n\nThe total sum of all stripes is n*m, so the sum of a_i's must be >= n*m. \n\nAdditionally, each stripe's size must be <= the a_i of the pigment it is assigned to. \n\nWait, but the stripe's size is 2*m (for horizontal stripes). \n\nThus, for each stripe, the pigment assigned to it must have a_i >= 2*m. \n\nWait, no. Because the stripe's size is 2*m, so the pigment assigned to it must have a_i >= 2*m. \n\nWait, because the stripe's size is 2*m, so the pigment must have at least that much. \n\nThus, the problem requires that there exists a way to assign each stripe to a pigment such that each stripe's size is <= the pigment's a_i. \n\nTherefore, the total number of stripes (n/2) must be covered by pigments where each stripe is assigned to a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. \n\nWait, but the same pigment can be used for multiple stripes as long as the sum of their sizes is <= a_i. \n\nAh, right! \n\nSo for example, if a pigment has a_i = 4*m, then it can cover two stripes of size 2*m each. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to: \n\nThe total number of stripes (n/2) multiplied by the stripe size (2*m) must be <= sum of a_i's. \n\nWait, but that's already true because the total area is n*m. \n\nWait, the sum of the stripe sizes is exactly n*m. \n\nSo the sum of a_i's must be >= n*m. \n\nBut also, the maximum stripe size (2*m) must be <= the maximum a_i. \n\nWait, no. Because if all stripes are assigned to a single pigment with a_i >= n*m, then that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum stripe size must be <= the maximum a_i. \n\nWait, no. Because if the stripes are assigned to multiple pigments, each stripe's size must be <= the a_i of its assigned pigment. \n\nThus, the maximum stripe size must be <= the maximum a_i. \n\nWait, because if the maximum stripe size is S, then there must be at least one pigment with a_i >= S. \n\nWait, no. Suppose there are two stripes of size S each, and two pigments each with a_i = S. Then each stripe can be assigned to a different pigment. \n\nThus, the maximum a_i must be at least the maximum stripe size. \n\nWait, the maximum stripe size is S. So the maximum a_i must be at least S. \n\nOtherwise, no single pigment can cover even one stripe. \n\nWait, but if the stripes can be split among multiple pigments, then the maximum a_i doesn't need to be >= S. \n\nWait, no. Each stripe must be assigned to a pigment with a_i >= its size. \n\nThus, for any stripe of size S, there must exist at least one pigment with a_i >= S. \n\nWait, no. Because the stripe can be assigned to a pigment with a_i >= S. \n\nThus, the maximum stripe size must be <= the maximum a_i. \n\nWait, no. Suppose the maximum stripe size is S, and there is no pigment with a_i >= S. Then it's impossible. \n\nYes, exactly. \n\nThus, the conditions for case b) (when choosing horizontal stripes) are: \n\n- n is even (or m even, but we have to choose the direction). \n\n- The maximum stripe size (2*m if horizontal, 2*n if vertical) must be <= the maximum a_i. \n\n- The sum of a_i's >= n*m. \n\nWait, but the direction can be chosen. \n\nSo for case b), we can choose between horizontal or vertical partitioning. \n\nThus, the conditions are: \n\nEither (n is even and there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*m, and sum a_i >= n*m), \n\nOR \n\n(m is even and there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*n, and sum a_i >= n*m). \n\nWait, but even if both are possible, we can choose whichever is better. \n\nAlternatively, the conditions are: \n\nEither (n is even and the maximum a_i >= 2*m and sum a_i >= n*m), \n\nOR \n\n(m is even and the maximum a_i >= 2*n and sum a_i >= n*m). \n\nWait, but the sum a_i >= n*m is required in any case. \n\nSo the overall algorithm is: \n\nFor each test case: \n\nCheck if any of the following is true: \n\n1. There exists a pigment with a_i >= n*m. \n\nOR \n\n2. (n is even AND (there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*m) AND (sum a_i >= n*m)), \n\nOR \n\n3. (m is even AND (there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*n) AND (sum a_i >= n*m)). \n\nIf any of these is true, output Yes, else No. \n\nWait, but what about when both n and m are even? Then both options 2 and 3 are possible. \n\nBut the conditions are OR, so it's okay. \n\nWait, but in case 2, the required is that there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. \n\nSimilarly for case 3. \n\nSo the code needs to check these conditions. \n\nNow, let's think about the code. \n\nThe function check(n, m) is called with check(n, m) || check(m, n). \n\nWait, looking at the code: \n\nThe solve function calls check(n, m) || check(m, n). \n\nHmm, perhaps the check function is designed to handle one direction. \n\nLike, check(n, m) would check the case where we partition into horizontal stripes (so n must be even, and the stripe size is 2*m). \n\nThen, check(m, n) would check the vertical case (m even, stripe size 2*n). \n\nWait, perhaps the check function is written to handle one direction. \n\nSo, the check function's parameters are (n, m), and it checks whether the following conditions are met: \n\n- n is even \n\nAND \n\n- there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*m \n\nAND \n\n- sum a_i >= n*m \n\nWait, but the sum a_i is needed to be checked in any case. \n\nWait, but the sum a_i is part of the input. \n\nWait, the code's check function is supposed to return true if the current direction (n even for horizontal) is possible. \n\nSo, the check function would need to: \n\nCheck if n is even. \n\nThen, check if there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*m. \n\nAlso, check if the sum of all a_i is >= n*m. \n\nWait, but the sum is required for both cases (1 and 2). \n\nHmm, but the first condition (case 1) is separate. \n\nWait, the code's check function is part of the OR with check(m, n). \n\nWait, perhaps the check function is designed to handle the case where the first condition (case 1) is not met, but the second condition (case 2 or 3) is. \n\nAlternatively, the check function may be handling the case where the direction is fixed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the check function is supposed to return true if the following is possible: \n\nEither the entire grid can be colored with one pigment (a_i >= n*m), \n\nOR \n\nthe grid can be partitioned into horizontal stripes (n even) with each stripe's size (2*m) can be covered by the pigments. \n\nWait, but the code's check function is called as check(n, m) || check(m, n). \n\nSo perhaps the check function is designed to handle one direction (horizontal or vertical). \n\nFor example, check(n, m) would check whether the horizontal partitioning is possible (n even, and the required conditions). \n\nThen, check(m, n) would check the vertical partitioning (m even, etc). \n\nAdditionally, the case where the entire grid is one color is covered by the first condition (if any a_i >= n*m, then check would return true). \n\nWait, but how does the check function account for the first condition? \n\nHmm, perhaps the check function is supposed to return true if either the entire grid can be colored with one pigment (a_i >= n*m) OR the partitioning in the given direction is possible. \n\nWait, but the code's check function is called in the solve function as (check(n,m) || check(m,n)), so perhaps each check function is responsible for checking both the single-color case and the partitioning in its direction. \n\nAlternatively, the check function may only check the partitioning in one direction, and the first condition (single color) is handled separately. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. \n\nLet me think of the code structure. \n\nThe code has a function check(n, m). \n\nThe solve function calls check(n, m) || check(m, n). \n\nThe check function's purpose is to determine whether, in the given direction (n rows, m columns), the partitioning is possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the check function is designed to return true if either: \n\n- there exists a pigment with a_i >= n*m (the single color case), \n\nOR \n\n- (n is even) and (there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*m) and (sum a_i >= n*m). \n\nWait, but the sum a_i must be >= n*m in any case. \n\nWait, the sum a_i is required for the single color case (if a_i >= n*m, then sum is at least that). \n\nBut for the partitioning case, the sum must be at least n*m. \n\nThus, the check function must also check that the sum of a_i is >= n*m. \n\nSo, the check function's logic would be: \n\nbool check(int n, int m) { \n\n    // Check if any a_i >= n*m (single color case) \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=k; i++) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= n*m) return true; \n\n    } \n\n    // Now check the partitioning case in this direction (horizontal) \n\n    if (n % 2 != 0) return false; // n must be even \n\n    // stripe size is 2*m \n\n    int stripe_size = 2 * m; \n\n    // check if there exists a pigment with a_i >= stripe_size \n\n    bool has_pigment = false; \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=k; i++) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= stripe_size) { \n\n            has_pigment = true; \n\n            break; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    if (!has_pigment) return false; \n\n    // Also check that the sum of a_i >= n*m \n\n    long long total = 0; \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=k; i++) total += a[i]; \n\n    if (total < n * (long long)m) return false; \n\n    return true; \n\n} \n\nWait, but the sum check is needed for both cases. \n\nWait, in the first case (single color), the sum is automatically >= n*m because one a_i is >= n*m. \n\nIn the partitioning case, the sum must be >= n*m. \n\nThus, the check function can first check the single color case, then check the partitioning case (if applicable). \n\nSo the code for check would be as above. \n\nBut in the code provided, the a array is global. \n\nWait, the code's check function has access to the a array. \n\nSo the code for check would be: \n\nbool check(int n, int m) { \n\n    // Check if any a_i >= n*m \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= 1LL * n * m) { \n\n            return true; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    // Check if partitioning is possible in this direction (horizontal) \n\n    if (n % 2 != 0) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    int stripe_size = 2 * m; \n\n    bool has_pigment = false; \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= stripe_size) { \n\n            has_pigment = true; \n\n            break; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    if (!has_pigment) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    // Check sum \n\n    long long total = 0; \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        total += a[i]; \n\n    } \n\n    if (total < 1LL * n * m) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    return true; \n\n} \n\nWait, but the stripe_size is 2*m, and the number of stripes is n/2. Each stripe has size 2*m. \n\nThe total area is (n/2)*2*m = n*m. \n\nThus, the sum of a_i must be >= n*m. \n\nSo the check for the sum is needed. \n\nThus, this code would handle the horizontal case. \n\nThen, when the solve function calls check(n, m) || check(m, n), the second check(m, n) would handle the vertical case. \n\nWait, in check(m, n), the parameters are swapped. \n\nWait, the check function is called with (m, n) in the second call. \n\nSo in that case, the first part checks if any a_i >= m*n (same as n*m). \n\nThen, the second part checks if m is even (since the first parameter is m now). \n\n stripe_size would be 2 * n (since the second parameter is n). \n\nThus, the vertical case is handled. \n\nThus, this code should work. \n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs. \n\nSample Input 3: \n\nSuppose the third test case has n and m such that the entire grid can be colored with pigment 1. \n\nIn that case, the first check (any a_i >= n*m) would return true, so the function returns yes. \n\nAnother test case where n is even and m is even, but no a_i is large enough for the entire grid, but there exists a pigment with a_i >= 2*m (for horizontal) and sum a_i >= n*m. \n\nThus, the check would return true. \n\nEdge case: n=3, m=3. \n\nThen, neither n nor m is even. \n\nThus, the only way is to have a pigment with a_i >= 9. \n\nIf that exists, then yes. \n\nElse, no. \n\nAnother case: n=4, m=3. \n\nThen, n is even. \n\n stripe_size is 2*3=6. \n\nWe need a pigment with a_i >=6. \n\nSuppose a has a pigment with 6, and sum is 6 + ... >= 12. \n\nThen yes. \n\nThus, the code should handle this. \n\nNow, the code in the problem's template has the check function to be filled. \n\nThus, the missing code for check is as above. \n\nBut in code, the variables are: \n\nThe a array is global. \n\nThe function parameters are n and m. \n\nThe code must loop through the a array to check for the first condition. \n\nThen check if n is even. \n\nThen check if any a_i >= 2*m. \n\nThen check the sum. \n\nThus, the code for check is as written above. \n\nNow, in code, the variables are: \n\nThe a array is declared as int a[N], and k is a global variable. \n\nWait, looking at the code given: \n\nThe code has: \n\nconst int N = 100005; \n\nint a[N], k; \n\nbool check(int n, int m) { \n\n    ... \n\n} \n\nvoid solve() { \n\n    int n, m; \n\n    std::cin >> n >> m >> k; \n\n    for (int i=1; i<=k; ++i) \n\n        std::cin >> a[i]; \n\n    std::cout << ((check(n, m) || check(m, n)) ? \"Yes\" : \"No\") << '\\n'; \n\n} \n\nWait, the variable k is declared as a global variable. \n\nIn the solve function, after reading k, it's stored in the global variable. \n\nThus, in the check function, the k is accessible. \n\nThus, the code for check is as I wrote. \n\nBut in code, the loop for checking a[i] >= n*m must be in the check function. \n\nThus, the code for check is as follows. \n\nNow, the code must also handle large numbers. \n\nThe product n*m can be up to 1e9 * 1e9 = 1e18, which is larger than 2e9, so we need to use 64-bit integers. \n\nThus, in the first loop, comparing a[i] (which is up to 1e9) to n*m (up to 1e18), we need to cast to long long. \n\nThus, the condition should be: \n\nif (a[i] >= 1LL * n * m) \n\nSimilarly for the total sum. \n\nThus, the code should be written with those considerations. \n\nThus, the complete check function is as I outlined. \n\nSo the missing code for check is: \n\nbool check(int n, int m) { \n\n    // Check if any a_i can cover the entire grid \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= 1LL * n * m) { \n\n            return true; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    // Check if partitioning into horizontal stripes (n even) is possible \n\n    if (n % 2 != 0) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    int stripe_size = 2 * m; \n\n    bool has_pigment = false; \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        if (a[i] >= stripe_size) { \n\n            has_pigment = true; \n\n            break; \n\n        } \n\n    } \n\n    if (!has_pigment) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    // Check total sum \n\n    long long total = 0; \n\n    for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) { \n\n        total += a[i]; \n\n    } \n\n    if (total < 1LL * n * m) { \n\n        return false; \n\n    } \n\n    return true; \n\n} \n\nThis should be the code for the check function. \n\nNow, let's see if there are any other edge cases. \n\nTest case where n=2, m=2. \n\nThen, n is even. \n\n stripe_size is 4. \n\nIf a has a pigment with 4, and sum is 4, then yes. \n\nAnother case where n=2, m=3. \n\n stripe_size is 6. \n\nIf a has a pigment with 6, and sum is 6, then yes. \n\nAnother case where n=4, m=4. \n\nEither direction works. \n\n stripe_size for horizontal is 8. \n\nIf a has a pigment with 8, and sum is 16, then yes. \n\nThus, the code should handle these cases. \n\nThus, the missing code is as above."
