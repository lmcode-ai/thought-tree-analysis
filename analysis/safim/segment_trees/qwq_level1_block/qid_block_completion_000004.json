So we set it back and break. But perhaps another constraint might have a j where j's bit is 1, so no problem. But by breaking, we don't check the next constraints. Hmm, but once the bit is set back, the other constraints are okay. So the code can proceed. Therefore, in the code, the missing part is setting the bit back. Alternatively, maybe the code has to set the bit back, and break out of the inner for loop. So the code would be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i],k);\n\nbreak; Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, in the code's missing part, the code should be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nbreak; Wait, but in the code's context, inside the loop over each A y (constraint):\n\nfor (A y : adjList[i]) {\n\n    int j = y.idx;\n\n    int val = y.val;\n\n    int bit = getBit(val, k);\n\n    if (bit == 1 && getBit(element[j],k) ==0) {\n\n        element[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n} Wait, but after setting the bit back, we break out of the for loop (over the adjacents of i). Alternatively, since once we have to set it back, further checks may not be needed. Therefore, the code in the TODO block is to set the element's bit back and break the loop. Hence, the missing code is:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k); \n\nbreak; Wait, but in the code's current structure, the code inside the loop is inside the block for (A y : adjList[i]), so the break will break out of that for loop. Alternatively, perhaps the break is not needed. Let me see. Alternatively, after reverting the bit, we can continue to check other constraints.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the lexicographically smallest array a that satisfies all the given OR conditions. The code provided seems to be a start, but some parts are missing. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nHmm, the key is to determine each bit of the array elements in a way that satisfies all the constraints. Since we need the lex smallest array, we should process the bits from the highest to the lowest? Or wait, maybe the other way around. Wait, lexicographic order depends on the first differing element. So to make the array lex smallest, we want the earliest elements to be as small as possible. But bits... perhaps we process bits from the highest (like 30th down to 0) and decide whether to set a bit or not, based on the constraints.\n\nWait, the code provided uses a method called getArray, which is supposed to compute the elements. Let's look at the existing code structure. The code loops over each bit position k from 0 to 30. For each bit, they process each element and its adjacent constraints.\n\nWait, the initial element array is filled with -2147483648 (since Arrays.fill with ~(1<<31), which is -2^30 in two's complement). But maybe the initial value is just a placeholder. Wait, the code initializes element as new int[n+1], filled with ~ (1 <<31). Wait 1<<31 is 2^31, but in Java, ints are 32-bit, so 1 <<31 is 0x80000000. ~ of that is 0x7FFFFFFF, which is 2^31-1. Wait, maybe they intended to set it to 0? Or perhaps the initial setup is incorrect. Wait, maybe the code has some errors here. But perhaps I should focus on the part that is missing.\n\nLooking at the existing code structure: For each bit k (starting at 0?), the first loop goes through each element, and for each A (which seems to be the adjacency list entries), it checks if the bit at position k in the constraint's value is 0. If it is, then they unset that bit in element[i], but break when they find such a constraint. Wait, this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, the approach here is trying to determine the bits of each element. Let me think again.\n\nEach OR constraint a_i | a_j = x implies that certain bits must be set or not. For a particular bit k (say, the k-th bit in x), if the bit is 0 in x, then both a_i and a_j must have their k-th bit unset. Because the OR of the bits would be 0 only if both are 0. But if the bit is set in x, then at least one of a_i or a_j must have that bit set.\n\nTherefore, for each constraint (i,j,x), the bits of x must be the OR of the bits of a_i and a_j. So for each bit k in 0..30:\n\nIf the k-th bit in x is 0, then both a_i's k-th bit and a_j's k-th bit must be 0.\n\nIf the k-th bit in x is 1, then at least one of a_i or a_j has the bit set.\n\nNow the problem is to find the lex smallest array that satisfies all these constraints.\n\nLex smallest means that for the earliest position where arrays differ, the element in a is smaller. So, to minimize the lex order, we should set bits as low as possible, but in a way that the earliest possible elements are as small as possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to process each bit from the highest to the lowest (starting with 30 down to 0) and decide whether to set each bit in each element. But how?\n\nWait, the code in the provided code seems to process bits in order from 0 to 30. Let me look at the code again.\n\nThe code starts with k=0, then increments until 30. The first loop for each bit k:\n\nFor each i from 1 to n, iterate through all the A entries (which are the constraints involving i and some j, with their x). For each such A (which is a pair j and val x):\n\nThe code checks if the bit in the val (x) is 0. If so, then they set element[i]'s bit k to 0, but break once any such constraint is found.\n\nWait, but that might not be correct. Because if any of the constraints for this i and j (in either direction) has x's k bit 0, then the element[i]'s bit must be 0 here. But perhaps not?\n\nWait, the constraints for (i,j,x) implies that, for that x's bits:\n\nfor each bit k, x's bit k is 1 iff at least one of a_i or a_j has that bit set.\n\nIf x's bit k is 0, then both a_i and a_j must have their bits unset.\n\nSo, for a given constraint (i,j,x), if the bit k in x is 0, then both a_i and a_j must have their k-th bits 0.\n\nThus, whenever any of the constraints for that i or j has x's bit k as 0, that element must have that bit 0.\n\nTherefore, in the code's first loop over all i and their constraints, when a constraint's x has bit k 0, then we must set element[i]'s bit to 0, but also for the j in that constraint. Wait, but in the code's current setup, it's only processing the i's constraints. So perhaps the code is missing handling the j's part as well?\n\nAlternatively, the adjacency list for i contains entries for each constraint involving i and some j. The code loops over all constraints for each i, and for each such constraint (j, val x), if the bit is 0, then that requires both a_i and a_j's bits to be 0. But the code is only unsetting the bit for the current i, maybe not the j?\n\nWait the code's first loop's inner for loop:\n\nfor (A y : adjList[i]) {\n\n    int j = y.idx; \n\n    int val = y.val; \n\n    int bit = getBit(val, k); \n\n    if (bit ==0) { \n\n        element[i] = unsetBit(element[i],k); \n\n        break; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, so for each constraint (i,j,val) stored in adjList[i], if the bit at position k in val is 0, then we set the current element[i]'s bit k to 0 and break. So once any such constraint is found (with x's bit 0), the element[i]'s bit is forced to 0. \n\nHowever, this would only process the i side. But the same applies to j's constraints. For example, the same (i,j,x) is stored in adjList[j], so when i is processed, j's element is not modified here, but when j is processed, that constraint will also force j's bit to 0 here.\n\nWait perhaps this is okay, because for each i, whenever there is any constraint involving i which requires that bit k to be 0 (i.e., any of the x's bits in its constraints is 0 here), then the current i's bit must be 0. So that part is covered here. \n\nBut when the bit is 1 in x, then either a_i or a_j can have it set. So in that case, the code does nothing here, but maybe proceeds to set bits where possible to minimize the lex order.\n\nWait the second loop in the code is for elements that have their bit k set. Let me see:\n\nIn the second loop after the first:\n\nfor (int i=1 to n) {\n\n    if (element[i] has bit k set) {\n\n        unset it, then check the constraints?\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Let me see the code again.\n\nThe second loop is:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n\n    if (getBit(element[i], k) == 1) {\n\n        element[i] = unsetBit(element[i], k);\n\n        for (A y : adjList[i]) {\n\n            int j = y.idx;\n\n            int val = y.val;\n\n            int bit = getBit(val, k);\n\n            if (bit ==1 && getBit(element[j],k) ==0) {\n\n                // TODO: Your code here\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, so in this part, if the current element's bit is set (1), then we try to unset it (since maybe we can, to keep the array lex smaller?), but then check the constraints. \n\nBut why would we want to unset it? Because maybe setting it to 0 can make the array lex smaller. But we have to ensure that the constraints are still satisfied. \n\nWait the idea here is probably: for a given bit k, once all the constraints that require the bit to be 0 are processed (from the first loop), then we can try to set bits to 0 (so that the array is lex smaller) unless it violates some constraints. \n\nThe problem is, if a bit is set, but maybe it's required because of a constraint where the x's bit is 1. \n\nWait, the second loop is trying to decide whether to leave the bit as 0 or set it. Because setting a bit to 1 can cause some constraints to fail if the other side (j) doesn't have it. Wait, perhaps the second loop is trying to see if we can turn off the bit (make it 0), but then check the constraints. If in any of the constraints involving this element and j's constraint, the x's bit is 1, then both cannot be 0. So if we set element[i]'s bit to 0, then we have to check that for any constraint (i,j,x) where x's bit is 1, the j's element must have the bit set. \n\nWait, the second loop is processing each element and seeing if they can turn off the bit (to make the array lex smaller) but ensuring that this doesn't violate any constraints. \n\nLet me think of the steps. \n\nThe first loop for each bit k:\n\n- For each i, check all constraints involving i. If any of those constraints have x's bit k as 0, then i's bit must be 0. So set element[i]'s bit to 0, but break once any such constraint is found. \n\nWait, but this might not cover all the constraints. For example, a constraint (i,j,x) with x's bit 0 would require both i and j to have bit 0. The first loop for i would process this and set i's bit to 0, but for j's processing, when checking its own constraints, the same (j,i,x) would also force j's bit to 0. \n\nSo the first loop ensures that if any constraint requires that a bit must be 0, then it is set to 0. \n\nThen, the second part: after that, for the bits that can be set or not (when the x's bits are 1), we want to set them to 0 if possible, but ensuring that for each constraint where x's bit is 1, at least one of i or j has it set. \n\nSo the second loop is trying to unset the bits (to make the array as small as possible lex-wise), but only if it doesn't violate the constraints. \n\nThe code in the second loop:\n\nFirst, for each element i, if the current bit k is set (1), then we try to set it to 0. \n\nWait, but why? Because we want to set it to 0 if possible. Then, after unsetting, we check all constraints involving i. \n\nWait, the code says:\n\nif the element[i]'s bit was 1, then unset it (to 0). Then, for each constraint (i,j,val) stored in the adjacency list:\n\n- if the val's bit is 1 (so the constraint requires that at least one of i or j's bits must be 1), but now both are 0 (since we just set i's bit to 0 and if j's bit is also 0), then this is a problem. \n\nWait, the code checks if the val's bit is 1, and if j's bit is 0. Then, in this case, the constraint is not satisfied because both are 0. So the code must revert the change (i's bit was set to 0, but that caused a violation, so we have to set it back to 1?), or perhaps not. \n\nWait, the code is in the \"if (bit ==1 && getBit(element[j],k) ==0)\" case. That implies that this constraint (i,j,x) has x's bit set (bit=1), but after unsetting i's bit, and j's bit is 0, then the OR would be 0, which violates the constraint. \n\nTherefore, this scenario is invalid, so the operation of unsetting i's bit is not allowed. Therefore, we must set the bit back to 1. \n\nHence, in this case, the code should set the bit back. \n\nBut how?\n\nThe code is in the following block:\n\nif (bit == 1 and getBit(element[j],k) == 0) {\n\n    // Need to handle this case.\n\n}\n\nSo the problem here is that after unsetting i's bit, we have a problem with this constraint. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to revert the unsetting of i's bit. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to set the bit again. \n\nBut how? \n\nThe code has already un-set element[i]'s bit to 0. But since this caused a violation, we have to set it back. \n\nWait, the code is in a loop over all the constraints of i. So perhaps in this case, the code should immediately revert the unset and break out of the loop for this i? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to mark that this i's bit cannot be unset. \n\nHmm, how to handle this. \n\nThe problem is that when we decide to unset element[i]'s bit (to make it 0), but there exists a constraint where x's bit is 1, and the j's element's bit is also 0, then the OR would be 0, which violates the constraint. \n\nHence, the unset of i's bit is invalid. Therefore, the code must not allow that. \n\nTherefore, in this case, we have to set the bit back. \n\nSo the code should do something like: \n\n// We have an invalid situation. \n\n// So revert the unset of i's bit. \n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nThen, perhaps break the loop, since we can't proceed further.\n\nWait, but then for that i, the bit was originally 1, then we tried to set it to 0 but found that it's invalid, so we have to leave it as 1. \n\nHence, the code should set the bit again. \n\nSo the missing code here is to set the element's bit back to 1. \n\nWait, but how to do that. \n\nIn the code's current structure:\n\nAfter un-setting the element's bit to 0, they loop over all the constraints (i,j,val). \n\nFor each such constraint, if the val's bit is 1, and the j's bit is 0, then the current situation (after unsetting i's bit) makes the OR of i and j's bits 0, but the x's bit is 1. So this is invalid. \n\nTherefore, this is a problem and we cannot leave the i's bit as 0. \n\nHence, we must revert the unset, by setting it again. \n\nTherefore, in the code's TODO section, the code should:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k); \n\nand then perhaps break out of the loop (since once we have to set it back, there's no point in checking other constraints). \n\nWait, but perhaps after setting it back, we can continue checking. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should immediately return the element's bit to 1, and then break out of the loop. Because once we set it back, the problem is resolved. \n\nAlternatively, after finding such a constraint, we need to immediately set the bit back and break, so that we don't process other constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the code should set the bit back and then break out of the inner loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can just set the bit back immediately and break out of the inner loop. \n\nBut how to do this in code. \n\nThe code here is inside the for loop over the A y elements. \n\nTherefore, in the case where this condition is met (bit ==1 and j's bit is 0), then we can do:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k); \n\nand break out of the for loop (over A y). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps just return to the outer loop and not process further? \n\nHmm. Let's think:\n\nSuppose that in the loop over the constraints of i, when we process a constraint that requires that the OR must be 1, but after unsetting i's bit, and j's is 0, then this is invalid. \n\nHence, the code must revert the bit. \n\nSo code here would be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nbreak; // exit the inner loop, since setting it back is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, in the code:\n\nif ( ... ){\n\n    element[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\n    break;\n\n}\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple constraints that require this? Then, after setting it back, other constraints may still be okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps once you have to set it back, you have to skip further processing for this element. \n\nHence, the code inside the TODO is:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nbreak;\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nif (bit == 1 && getBit(element[j], k) == 0) {\n\n    element[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\n    break;\n\n}\n\nWait, but why break? Because once we find that this constraint requires us to set it back, we don't need to check any more constraints for this i's adjacents. Because setting back the bit resolves this issue, but perhaps other constraints may still require the bit to be set. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner loop should continue after this, but once we set the bit back, then all constraints are okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the break is necessary to prevent further constraints from being checked, since after reverting, the loop over the constraints can't proceed further. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the break is not needed. \n\nWait, perhaps the code will do the following:\n\nWhen you find such a constraint (i,j,x's bit is 1, but after unsetting i's bit, j's bit is also 0), then you have to set the bit back. Once you do that, you can exit the loop over the adjacents because you've already fixed the problem. \n\nAlternatively, you could continue the loop, but maybe it's not needed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code can just set the bit back and exit the inner loop. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even after setting back, you might find another constraint that also requires the bit to be set, but that's okay. \n\nHmm, the key is that the setting of the bit back makes the current i's bit 1 again, so the OR condition is satisfied. \n\nTherefore, in this case, the code needs to revert the unset and break the inner loop. \n\nHence, the missing code should be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nbreak;\n\nWait, but the code has to be inside the for loop over A y. \n\nAlternatively, the code is inside the if block, so the code would be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nbreak; // break the inner for loop.\n\nWait, but if there are multiple constraints for this i, perhaps after this break, other constraints may still have issues. \n\nNo, because once the bit is set back, the i's bit is 1 again, so other constraints (where maybe j's bit is also 1) are okay. \n\nWait, the break here only exits the loop over the A entries. \n\nHmm, perhaps that is okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to revert the bit and then break out of the entire processing of this i. \n\nAlternatively, the code might also have to break out of the inner loop once this condition is hit, so that we don't process further A entries for this i.\n\nWait, suppose that after reverting the bit, there are other constraints that also require this bit to be set. But since the bit is already set, those constraints are okay. \n\nHmm, so I think the code inside the TODO block should be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i],k);\n\nbreak;\n\nBecause once that's done, the problem for this constraint is fixed, and no further processing needed for this constraint. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the break is not necessary. \n\nWait, let's think of an example where there are two constraints. Suppose that after unsetting i's bit, there are two constraints. The first one requires the bit to be set (because j's bit is 0). So we set it back and break. \n\nBut perhaps another constraint might have a j where j's bit is 1, so no problem. But by breaking, we don't check the next constraints. \n\nHmm, but once the bit is set back, the other constraints are okay. \n\nSo the code can proceed. \n\nTherefore, in the code, the missing part is setting the bit back. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code has to set the bit back, and break out of the inner for loop. So the code would be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i],k);\n\nbreak;\n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nTherefore, in the code's missing part, the code should be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nbreak;\n\nWait, but in the code's context, inside the loop over each A y (constraint):\n\nfor (A y : adjList[i]) {\n\n    int j = y.idx;\n\n    int val = y.val;\n\n    int bit = getBit(val, k);\n\n    if (bit == 1 && getBit(element[j],k) ==0) {\n\n        element[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\n        break;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but after setting the bit back, we break out of the for loop (over the adjacents of i). \n\nAlternatively, since once we have to set it back, further checks may not be needed. \n\nTherefore, the code in the TODO block is to set the element's bit back and break the loop.\n\nHence, the missing code is:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k); \n\nbreak;\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the code inside the loop is inside the block for (A y : adjList[i]), so the break will break out of that for loop. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the break is not needed. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, after reverting the bit, we can continue to check other constraints. However, after reverting, the i's bit is set again, so any other constraints that have x's bit 1 will be okay as long as either i or j has it set. \n\nBut in this case, since we reverted, the i's bit is set, so the OR is satisfied even if j's bit is 0. \n\nWait, the x's bit is 1, and since the i's bit is now set to 1, the OR is 1, so the constraint is satisfied. \n\nTherefore, after reverting the bit, any other constraints for this i are okay. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the break is not necessary, but it's okay to continue processing the other constraints. \n\nHowever, the code will continue to process the other constraints. \n\nBut suppose that in another constraint for this i, there is a j where the x's bit is 1 but j's bit is also 0. \n\nThen, this would have to be considered again. \n\nWait, no, because in that case, after reverting the bit, that's okay. \n\nWait, the problem only arises when setting the bit back is necessary for that constraint. \n\nBut in any case, the first such constraint that caused the need to revert the bit would have already done so, and the rest are okay. \n\nHmm, perhaps the break is not needed, but the code can continue. \n\nWait, but in code, after reverting, the loop continues and processes other constraints. \n\nSuppose there's another constraint where j's bit is 0 and the x's bit is 1. Then, when we again check the same condition (bit is 1 and j's bit is 0), but now the i's bit is set again. So the OR is okay, so the condition will not be met. \n\nHence, no further action is needed. \n\nTherefore, the code could proceed without breaking. \n\nThus, the only code needed is setting the element's bit back. \n\nWait, but in that case, the code would have to be:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nBut without the break, the loop continues. \n\nWait, but in the code, after this, the loop over all the constraints for i continues. \n\nBut in the case where another constraint exists where j's bit is 0. \n\nBut after reverting the bit to 1, the OR is okay. \n\nHence, the break is not needed. \n\nHmm, so the minimal code is just setting the bit back. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the code is inside the for loop. \n\nWait, but without breaking, the code will continue to check other constraints. But if any other constraint also requires the bit to be set (because j's bit is 0), then the same code will run again, leading to toggling. \n\nWait, no, because after the first time, the bit is set back. Then, the next constraint may have different j. \n\nWait, it's possible that a second constraint also causes this to happen again, but that would not be necessary. \n\nWait, the problem is that when the i's bit is set again (by the previous code), so for any other constraint where x's bit is 1, even if the j is also 0, the OR would now be 1 (since i's bit is 1), so the condition (bit ==1 and getBit(element[j],k) ==0) would still be true. \n\nWait, in that case, the code would again run. \n\nWait, for example, if there are two constraints (i,j1,x) and (i,j2,x), and both j1 and j2's bits are 0. \n\nThen, after reverting the i's bit to 1, processing the second constraint would again trigger the condition (since j2's bit is 0 and the x's bit is 1). \n\nBut in that case, the code would again set the i's bit back to 1. \n\nWait, but the code is already 1, so setting it again would have no effect. \n\nWait, because element[i] is already set to 1, so when you call setBit again, it remains 1. \n\nHence, this is okay. \n\nTherefore, the code can proceed without breaking. \n\nHence, the missing code is just to set the element's bit back. \n\nWait, but that is only part of the problem. \n\nWait, in this case, when you had unset the bit to 0, but then the constraint requires that it must be set, you have to set it back. \n\nHence, the code is: \n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nBut that's the only code needed here. \n\nWait, but in the code above, the element[i] was set to 0, so to set it back to 1, we must call setBit. \n\nTherefore, the correct code is:\n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nSo the missing code is that line. \n\nWait, but why is the break necessary? \n\nLet me re-examine the code: \n\nThe code in the second loop:\n\nThe code first unsets the element[i]'s bit (if it was 1). \n\nThen, for each constraint (i,j,val):\n\nif the val's bit is 1 and j's bit is 0, then the current i's bit is 0 (because we just unset it), so the OR is 0, which violates the constraint. \n\nTherefore, we must set the i's bit back to 1. \n\nHence, we do element[i] = setBit(...)\n\nBut this is the only action needed here. \n\nThe code then continues to process other constraints. \n\nHowever, after doing so, the variable element[i] is now set back to 1. \n\nWait, but the code is inside a loop over the constraints. Let me see:\n\nSuppose that after setting the bit back, there are more constraints, which might also have j's bit 0. \n\nBut since element[i]'s bit is back to 1, those constraints are now okay. \n\nHence, no further action is needed for those constraints. \n\nTherefore, the code can proceed. \n\nThe problem here is that after setting the bit back, the code continues to loop through the remaining A elements. \n\nBut this is okay. \n\nHence, the missing code is simply: \n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k); \n\nWait, that's the only line needed. \n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple constraints that require this bit to stay set? \n\nThen, the code would have already set it back. \n\nSo the missing code is indeed just that line. \n\nWait but the original code (the code provided) has a comment: \n\n/* TODO: Your code here */\n\nHence, the code to be added is that line. \n\nWait, but perhaps the code also needs to break the loop, but maybe not. \n\nWait, perhaps in the code's initial logic, when we loop through all the adjacents of i, after reverting the bit, we might have to check all constraints again? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct as long as the bit is set back. \n\nLet me think of a sample scenario. \n\nSuppose that for element i and bit k, the first loop has set it to 1 (or maybe not). \n\nThen, in the second loop, the bit is 1. \n\nWe unset it (to 0). \n\nThen, in checking constraints: \n\nSuppose one of the constraints requires that this bit must be set (x's bit is 1). The j's bit is 0. \n\nSo we set the i's bit back to 1. \n\nTherefore, this resolves the problem. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nelement[i] = setBit(element[i], k);\n\nHence, that's the code needed here. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is to add that line in the TODO block."
