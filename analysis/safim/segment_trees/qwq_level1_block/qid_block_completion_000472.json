So the total is (nadj[u] -1 +1) = nadj[u] plus cost[v]. So the cost for u would be the minimum over all possible edges from u to v of (nadj[u] + cost[v]). Wait, but in the first sample where u is 1 (node 0) and v is 3 (node 2), nadj[u] is 1. So the cost would be 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the correct answer. So the formula should be cost[v] + nadj[u] But in the code's current line, it's cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1. That would give 1+1=2, which is wrong. So the code has an error here. Ah, so the correct formula is cost[v] + nadj[u], but the code is adding an extra 1. So the line should be: if cost[v] + nadj[u] < cost[u]:\n\nWait, but why is there a discrepancy here? Alternatively, perhaps the formula is cost[v] + (number of edges from u) + 1? No, that would be wrong. Wait, let's re-express the formula: The number of days needed to go from u to v via this edge is:\n\n(number of edges to block) + 1 (the move day) + cost[v]\n\nThe number of edges to block is (nadj[u] - 1), since you have to block all edges except the one to v. \n\nSo total days: (nadj[u] -1) + 1 + cost[v] = nadj[u] + cost[v] So the formula is correct. Therefore, the code's current line has an extra +1, which is incorrect. So the line should be:",

So the code inside the if block should set cost[u] to the new cost and push to the queue. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 \n\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u)) Wait, but the condition is checking if the new cost is better than current cost[u]. So the code inside the if block should be:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 \n\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u)) Yes. So the missing code is those two lines. Therefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u)) Ah! So I was initially mistaken in thinking that the formula was wrong, but the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is actually correct. So the line is correct, and the formula is correct. Therefore, the missing code is the two lines above. Let me verify with the first sample: Sample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the first sample has a direct path from 1 to 3 (nodes 0 and 2 in 0-based). The code starts with cost[2] =0. Processing node v=2 (n-1=2). The predecessors u of v (node 2) are node 0 (since there's an edge from 0 to 2). For u=0:\n\nThe line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]. iadj[v][u] is the number of edges from u to v. \n\nIn this case, it's 1 (the edge 0->2). nadj[u] was initially 1 (since node 0 has one outgoing edge). After subtraction, nadj[u] becomes 0. The condition is cost[v] (0) + nadj[u] (0) +1 (1) < cost[u] (which is initially infinity). So yes. Then, cost[u] is set to 1, and pushed to the queue. Thus, the final cost[0] is 1, which matches the sample's answer. So the code is correct with those two lines. Therefore, the missing code is the two lines I mentioned. So the correct answer is to output those two lines.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Python code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key here is understanding the strategy AmShZ can use each day. Each day, AmShZ can either block a road or tell Keshi to move. The goal is to minimize the days required to ensure Keshi reaches city n.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves some form of shortest path calculation, considering the optimal choices AmShZ can make. Let me think about the code provided. The code uses Dijkstra's algorithm, which suggests that the problem can be modeled as a shortest path problem where the cost is the minimal days needed.\n\nLooking at the code structure:\n\n- They have an adjacency list for inverted roads (iadj), which for each node u, stores all the nodes v that have an edge to u. The iadj[u][v] counts how many roads exist from v to u. Because multiple roads can exist between the same pair.\n\n- The nadj array probably keeps track of the number of outgoing edges each node has. Wait, in the loop when reading the roads, for each road v->u, they add to iadj[u]'s entry for v, and increment nadj[v]. So nadj[v] is the total number of outgoing edges from v. That makes sense.\n\nThe code initializes a priority queue for Dijkstra's, starting from node n (since it's using the inverted adjacency list, maybe working backwards). The cost array holds the minimal cost to reach each node from the end (n). The initial cost for n is 0.\n\nThe loop processes nodes in the priority queue. For each node v, they look at all predecessors u (since iadj[v] gives all u such that there's an edge u->v). Then, they subtract the number of edges from u to v (iadj[v][u]) from nadj[u]. Wait, that might be a mistake? Or maybe part of the logic here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code is processing the inverted adjacency list. So for each u in iadj[v], that means u is a node that has an edge to v. So when considering u as a predecessor of v, the number of edges from u to v is stored in iadj[v][u]. \n\nThe line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is probably part of some calculation here. Wait, but nadj[u] is the total outgoing edges from u. But in the loop, when processing v, they are modifying nadj[u]? That might not be correct because nadj is supposed to be the original count of outgoing edges. Maybe this is a mistake in the code, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the approach here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute something else. Let me think again about the problem's logic.\n\nThe key idea here is that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or make Keshi move. The optimal strategy would involve choosing actions that minimize the days. The problem requires that the solution must work for the worst-case scenario, so we need to find the minimal d such that no matter how Keshi chooses his path (when moving), they can ensure arrival in d days.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a game where each step, AmShZ can choose to block a road (thereby reducing possible paths) or force a move. The minimal days required would be the minimal path in some graph where each node's cost is determined by the best possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be thought of in reverse. Let's model the problem from the end (city n) backwards. For each node, the minimal days required to reach n from that node. The cost for a node u would be the minimal days needed from u to n.\n\nThe code seems to be using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is typical for shortest path problems. The cost array is being updated with the minimal cost. The initial setup starts at node n with cost 0, and propagates backwards.\n\nLooking at the code's current state:\n\nIn the loop over u in iadj[v], which are the predecessors of v. The code subtracts the number of edges from u to v (iadj[v][u]) from nadj[u]. Wait, but nadj[u] is the original number of outgoing edges from u. So this line is modifying nadj[u], which might not be correct because nadj should be fixed. That's probably a mistake here. Maybe this line is part of an incorrect approach and needs to be fixed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of edges that can be blocked. Let me think again about the problem's requirements.\n\nThe cost for a node u would be the minimal number of days required to get from u to n. Let's think recursively. Suppose we are at node u. To reach n, AmShZ can choose each day to either block a road or make Keshi move.\n\nIf AmShZ chooses to make Keshi move, then Keshi will choose uniformly at random among all outgoing edges from u that are not blocked. But since we need to guarantee arrival in d days, we have to consider the worst case. So, the strategy must ensure that no matter which path Keshi takes (when moving), the path will lead to the destination in time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal days required from u is the minimal between:\n\n- 1 (for the day when moving) plus the minimal days from the next node (but since Keshi chooses randomly, we have to take the maximum possible next step's cost, because we need to ensure that even in the worst case, it's covered).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming.\n\nLet\u2019s denote d[u] as the minimal number of days required to ensure reaching n from u.\n\nFor the base case, d[n] = 0.\n\nFor other nodes u:\n\nThe optimal strategy for AmShZ is to choose between two options each day:\n\nOption 1: Block a road. This takes one day, and then the problem reduces to the same node u but with one less outgoing edge. But since AmShZ can choose which road to block, they can strategically block roads that are not on the optimal path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that each time you can choose to block a road, but you want to minimize the days. Alternatively, the minimal days would be determined by the structure of the graph.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: the minimal days required from u is the minimal over all possible choices of blocking roads and moving, but since we need to guarantee arrival, we have to consider the worst-case path Keshi might take.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a shortest path problem where for each node u, the cost is the minimal number of days required to reach n from u. The transitions would be based on the possible moves and blocks.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each node u, the minimal days d[u] can be computed as follows:\n\nIf u is n, then d[u] = 0.\n\nOtherwise, the minimal days would be the minimal between:\n\n1. 1 (for blocking a road) plus the days required from u after blocking that road. But since AmShZ can choose which road to block, they can choose the road that leads to the minimal days. However, since we need to consider the worst case, perhaps this isn't the right way.\n\nAlternatively, when moving, Keshi will choose a next node v among all outgoing edges from u that are not blocked. Since we need to guarantee arrival, the strategy must ensure that no matter which path Keshi takes (when moving), the total days are within the limit. Therefore, when moving, the cost would be 1 (the day used to move) plus the maximum of d[v] for all possible next nodes v. Because in the worst case, Keshi might choose the path with the highest required days. So to ensure that even in the worst case, the total days are acceptable, we have to take the maximum of the next steps.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal days required from u is the minimal between:\n\n- 1 (blocking a road) plus the minimal days from u after blocking that road (but since AmShZ can choose which road to block, they can choose the best road to block to minimize the required days).\n\nWait, but blocking a road doesn't move Keshi. So after blocking, the next day can be another action. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to block all roads except one path leading to n, and then force Keshi to move along that path. The number of days needed would be the number of edges in the path plus the number of blocked roads along other paths. But since each block takes a day, and each move takes a day, perhaps the minimal days is the length of the path plus the number of blocked roads needed to eliminate other paths.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows: the minimal days required is the minimal over all possible paths from 1 to n of (the length of the path) plus the number of edges not on the path that need to be blocked. But since each block takes a day, and each move takes a day, perhaps the total days would be (path length) + (number of edges not on the path in the path's branches) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of this in terms of the code provided. Let me look again at the code's variables.\n\nThe code uses an inverted adjacency list (iadj), which for each node v, stores all nodes u that have an edge to v. The nadj array is the number of outgoing edges for each node. The cost array is being filled with Dijkstra's algorithm, starting from node n (since the initial node in the priority queue is (0, n-1)).\n\nThe code's current loop is processing each predecessor u of v (since iadj[v] gives all u's that have edges to v). The line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is subtracting the number of edges from u to v from the nadj[u], which is the original count of outgoing edges from u. That seems incorrect because nadj[u] should remain as the original count. So perhaps this line is a mistake and should be removed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute something else here. Let me think of the formula for the cost[u].\n\nThe current code has:\n\nif cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n\nWait, the cost[v] is the current cost to reach n from v. Then, adding nadj[u] + 1. Hmm, perhaps the idea is that to get from u to v, you have to consider the number of outgoing edges from u. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we are at node u. To reach n, the minimal days would be the minimal between:\n\nOption 1: Block a road (taking 1 day), then proceed. But since AmShZ can choose which road to block, perhaps this isn't directly considered here.\n\nAlternatively, the formula might be considering that when moving from u, Keshi has to choose among all outgoing edges. The worst case is that he takes the path with the maximum required days. So the cost for u would be 1 (the day to move) plus the maximum of the cost of all next nodes. But since we want to minimize the days, perhaps AmShZ can choose to block roads to eliminate paths with higher costs, so that the remaining paths have lower costs.\n\nAlternatively, the formula in the code might be trying to model the cost as the number of outgoing edges plus the cost of the next node. Wait, perhaps the cost[u] is being calculated as the number of edges outgoing from u plus the cost of the next node. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in reverse. Let's model the cost as the minimal number of days required from u to n. For each node u, the cost is the minimal between:\n\n- 1 (blocking a road) plus the cost of u after blocking that road (but since AmShZ can choose which road to block, they can choose the road that leads to the minimal cost).\n\nBut this seems recursive and hard to model.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: each time you can choose to either block a road (taking a day) or move (taking a day and moving to a next node). The goal is to reach n in minimal days, considering the worst-case path choices by Keshi when moving.\n\nThe key insight here might be that the minimal days required from a node u is equal to the number of edges in the shortest path from u to n plus the number of edges that need to be blocked along the way. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal days required is the maximum, over all possible paths from u to n, of (the length of the path). Because in the worst case, Keshi might take the longest path, so you have to block all other paths. But that might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that AmShZ can choose each day whether to block a road or to move. The optimal strategy would be to block roads that are not on the shortest path, so that Keshi is forced to take the shortest path. The number of days would then be the length of the path plus the number of roads blocked (each block takes a day). But since each block can be done on a day when you don't move, perhaps the total days is the path length plus the number of blocked roads.\n\nWait, but each day you can choose between blocking or moving. So for each edge in the path, you can move, but for other edges, you have to block them. So the total days would be the path length (each move takes a day) plus the number of edges not on the path that need to be blocked (each block takes a day). But how do you choose which edges to block?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal days would be the minimal over all possible paths P of (length of P) + (number of edges not in P that are on some path from u to n). But that might not be correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a shortest path problem where the cost for each node u is the minimal number of days required to reach n from u, considering that each move takes 1 day and each block also takes 1 day. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the code's structure:\n\nThe code is using Dijkstra's algorithm, which suggests that the cost is being minimized. The initial setup starts at node n with cost 0. The code is processing predecessors of v (since it's using the inverted adjacency list). \n\nLooking at the line:\n\nif cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the cost[u] is being set as the cost of v plus the number of outgoing edges from u plus 1. That doesn't immediately make sense, but let's think:\n\nSuppose that to get from u to v, you have to first block all other edges except the one leading to v. The number of edges to block is (nadj[u] - 1), since you have nadj[u] edges, and you need to block all except one. Then, you can move to v (taking 1 day). So the total days would be (nadj[u] - 1) + 1 + cost[v]. But that would be nadj[u] + cost[v]. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is considering that each time you are at u, you can choose to block a road (taking a day) or move (taking a day and moving to a next node). The optimal strategy would be to block all other edges except one, then move. The number of days needed would be (number of edges to block) + 1 (the move day) plus the cost of the next node. \n\nThe number of edges to block is (number of outgoing edges from u minus 1), since you can choose to keep one edge (the one leading to v). So the total cost would be (nadj[u] - 1) + 1 + cost[v] = nadj[u] + cost[v]. \n\nTherefore, the cost for u would be the minimum over all possible edges from u to v of (nadj[u] + cost[v]). \n\nWait, but in the code's current line, it's cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1. That would be adding an extra 1. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is considering that each edge from u to v contributes to the cost. Let me think again:\n\nSuppose that for each edge from u to v, the cost to go through that edge is (number of edges to block (nadj[u] - 1)) plus 1 (the move day) plus the cost of v. So the total is (nadj[u] -1) + 1 + cost[v] = nadj[u] + cost[v]. \n\nTherefore, the minimal cost for u would be the minimum over all possible edges from u to v of (nadj[u] + cost[v]). \n\nWait, but in the code's current line, the condition is cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]. That would be adding an extra 1. So perhaps there's an error here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is different. Let me think of the example given in the problem.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\nSo the roads are 1->2 and 2->3. The minimal days should be 1 (since AmShZ can just tell Keshi to move each day. On day 1, Keshi moves from 1 to 2, then on day 2, moves to 3. So total 2 days. But according to the note, it's possible to do it in 1 day? Wait the note says \"In the first sample, it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message (move). So Keshi moves on day 1, but how?\n\nWait the first sample's note says that the answer is 1. Let me see:\n\nThe first sample has cities 1, 2, 3. Roads 1->2 and 2->3. \n\nIf AmShZ tells Keshi to move on day 1, then Keshi is in city 1. He can choose any outgoing edge. The only edge is to 2. So he moves there. Then, on day 2, AmShZ can tell him to move again, moving to 3. So total 2 days. But the note says it's enough to send the second type message (move) once? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the note.\n\nWait the note says: \"In the first sample, it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message.\" So perhaps the answer is 1 day? That can't be. Unless there's a path of length 1. Wait maybe the first sample's input is different. Let me recheck.\n\nWait the first sample's input might be different. Let me think again. The first sample's note says that the answer is 1. So perhaps the path is 1->2->3, but the minimal days is 1. How?\n\nAh, perhaps the first sample's roads are 1->3 and another road. Wait maybe the first sample's roads are such that there's a direct path. Let me think of the first sample's note: \"In the first sample, it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message (move). So Keshi moves on day 1, and reaches the destination. So the path must be of length 1. So the roads must include 1->3. \n\nAssuming that, then the code's approach must compute the cost for node 1 as 1. Let's see how the code would handle that.\n\nSuppose in that case, the code's cost array for node 1 would be 1. Let's see how the code's formula would work.\n\nThe code starts at node 3 (n-1 = 2 in 0-based). The cost[2] is 0. \n\nThen, for each predecessor u of 2 (which would be node 1 if there's a road 1->2, but in the first sample's case where there's a direct 1->3, then the predecessors of 2 would be any nodes with edges to 2. Let's say in the first sample, the roads are 1->2 and 2->3, then the first sample's answer is 2 days. But the note says it's possible with 1 day. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first sample's input is different. Let me think of the first sample's note: \"In the first sample, it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message (move). So Keshi moves on day 1, and reaches the destination. So the path must be of length 1. So the roads must have a direct path from 1 to 3. So the first sample's input is n=3, m=1, with the road 1->3. Then the answer is 1.\n\nIn that case, the code's calculation would be:\n\ncost[2] (node 3) is 0. \n\nThe predecessors of node 2 (3) are node 0 (1) if there's a road 1->3. \n\nSo for u = 0 (node 1), the code would process v = 2 (node 3). \n\nThe nadj[u] is the number of outgoing edges from u (node 1). In this case, it's 1 (the road to 3). \n\nThe formula would be cost[v] (0) + nadj[u] (1) + 1? That would give 0 + 1 +1 = 2, which would not be correct. So that suggests that the formula is wrong.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula should be cost[v] + (number of edges from u excluding the one leading to v) + 1. \n\nWait, let's think again. \n\nSuppose that to get from u to v, you have to block all other edges except the one to v. The number of edges to block is (nadj[u] - 1). Each block takes a day. Then, you can move to v (taking 1 day). So the total days for this path would be (nadj[u] -1) + 1 + cost[v]. \n\nSo the total is (nadj[u] -1 +1) = nadj[u] plus cost[v]. \n\nSo the cost for u would be the minimum over all possible edges from u to v of (nadj[u] + cost[v]). \n\nWait, but in the first sample where u is 1 (node 0) and v is 3 (node 2), nadj[u] is 1. So the cost would be 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the correct answer. \n\nSo the formula should be cost[v] + nadj[u] \n\nBut in the code's current line, it's cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1. That would give 1+1=2, which is wrong. So the code has an error here. \n\nAh, so the correct formula is cost[v] + nadj[u], but the code is adding an extra 1. So the line should be:\n\nif cost[v] + nadj[u] < cost[u]:\n\nWait, but why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is cost[v] + (number of edges from u) + 1? No, that would be wrong. \n\nWait, let's re-express the formula:\n\nThe number of days needed to go from u to v via this edge is:\n\n(number of edges to block) + 1 (the move day) + cost[v]\n\nThe number of edges to block is (nadj[u] - 1), since you have to block all edges except the one to v. \n\nSo total days: (nadj[u] -1) + 1 + cost[v] = nadj[u] + cost[v]\n\nSo the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the code's current line has an extra +1, which is incorrect. \n\nSo the line should be:\n\nif cost[v] + nadj[u] < cost[u]:\n\nBut in the code's current code, the line is:\n\nif cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n\nSo that's the mistake. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to remove the +1. \n\nBut why is the code using the inverted adjacency list? Let me think again. \n\nThe code is processing predecessors of v (since it's using iadj[v], which is the list of nodes that have edges to v). So for each u in iadj[v], that means there is an edge from u to v. \n\nSo for each such u, the cost[u] can be updated by considering the path through v. \n\nWait, but in the formula, the cost[u] is being computed based on the cost of v. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is working backwards. The cost[v] is the minimal days from v to n. So to compute the cost for u, which has an edge to v, the cost[u] would be the minimal between its current value and (cost[v] + nadj[u]). \n\nWait, but why nadj[u]? Because to get from u to v, you have to block all other edges except the one to v, which takes (nadj[u] -1) days, then move (1 day), totaling nadj[u] days, plus the cost from v. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo the correct condition is cost[v] + nadj[u] < cost[u]. \n\nTherefore, the code's line should be:\n\nif cost[v] + nadj[u] < cost[u]:\n\nThen, the new cost for u would be cost[v] + nadj[u], so we set cost[u] = min(cost[u], cost[v] + nadj[u]), and push it into the priority queue. \n\nBut in the code's current code, the line is adding nadj[u] + 1. So that's the error. \n\nAdditionally, the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is incorrect. Because nadj[u] is the original number of outgoing edges from u. But in the code, when processing v (a successor of u), they subtract the number of edges from u to v. This would be modifying nadj[u], which is not correct because nadj should remain as the original count. \n\nAh, right! The line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is wrong. Because nadj[u] is the total number of outgoing edges from u. But in the code's loop, for each predecessor u of v (i.e., edges u->v), they subtract the count of edges from u to v. This would reduce nadj[u], but that's not correct because nadj[u] should remain as the original number of edges. \n\nSo that line is incorrect and should be removed. \n\nTherefore, the code has two errors: \n\n1. The line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] should be removed. \n\n2. The condition in the if statement should be cost[v] + nadj[u] instead of cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1. \n\nSo the correct code for the TODO section would be:\n\n    # TODO: Your code here\n    new_cost = cost[v] + nadj[u]\n    if new_cost < cost[u]:\n        cost[u] = new_cost\n        heapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, after the line where they check if the new cost is better, they need to update the cost and push to the priority queue. \n\nThe existing code's loop is:\n\nfor u in iadj[v]:\n    nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]\n    if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the correct code would be:\n\nFirst, remove the line that subtracts from nadj[u]. \n\nThen, the condition is cost[v] + nadj[u] < cost[u]. \n\nThen, when that is true, we set cost[u] to the new cost and push to the priority queue. \n\nSo the code inside the if block should be:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u]\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u]\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nBut also, the line that subtracts from nadj[u] must be removed. \n\nWait, but the code as given has that line before the if statement. So the user's code has:\n\nfor u in iadj[v]:\n    nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]\n    if cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the first step is to remove the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u], because that's incorrect. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. So the problem is that the code has an incomplete block where the user must fill in the TODO. \n\nThe original code's TODO is inside the if statement. So the code after the if condition is missing the code to update the cost and push to the queue. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u]\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nBut also, the line that subtracts from nadj[u] must be removed. However, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. Since the code provided includes that line, but it's incorrect, perhaps the problem requires that the code is fixed by removing that line and adding the correct code in the TODO. \n\nBut according to the problem's instruction, the user must output only the missing code. So the code that is missing in the TODO block is the code to update the cost and push to the queue. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u]\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nAdditionally, the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] must be removed. But since the user's code includes that line, and the problem says to output only the missing code, perhaps the line is part of the code that needs to be corrected. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". So the user must fill in the missing lines. The existing code has a loop over u in iadj[v], and inside that loop, there is a line that subtracts from nadj[u], then the if condition, then the TODO. \n\nThe mistake in the code is that the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is incorrect. So the user must remove that line and replace it with the correct code. But since the problem says to output only the missing code, perhaps the line is not part of the missing code but part of the existing code that is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is part of the code that should be there, but it's incorrect. Since the user is to output only the missing code, perhaps the line is not part of the missing code. \n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-express the problem's instruction:\n\nThe user must output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The existing code has a for loop over u in iadj[v], and inside that loop, there is a line that subtracts from nadj[u], then an if condition, then the TODO. \n\nThe correct code requires that the line nadj[u] -= ... is removed, and the code inside the if block is filled in. \n\nBut since the user is to output only the missing code (the part after the if condition), then the correct code to output is the two lines:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u]\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nAdditionally, the line that subtracts from nadj[u] must be removed. But since the user can't modify existing code, only fill in the missing parts, perhaps the line is part of the code that is incorrect but the user is not supposed to touch it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is part of the code that should be there but is incorrect. \n\nWait, the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is part of the code provided. The problem says to output only the missing code. So perhaps that line is part of the code that is already present and is incorrect, but the user is not supposed to change it. \n\nBut in that case, the code would be incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is part of the code that is supposed to be there but is incorrect, and the user must replace it with the correct code. But the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is not part of the code that needs to be there. Let me think again about the code's logic. \n\nThe line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is subtracting the number of edges from u to v from the total outgoing edges of u. But that's not correct because nadj[u] is the total number of outgoing edges from u. \n\nTherefore, that line is incorrect and should be removed. But since the user is to output only the missing code, perhaps the line is part of the existing code and the user must not touch it. \n\nIn that case, the code would still be incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is part of the code that is supposed to be there but is incorrect, and the user must replace it with the correct code. But the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is not part of the code that should be there. \n\nWait, the code's initial setup for nadj[v] is the number of outgoing edges from v. \n\nThe line:\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    v,u=map(int,input().split())\n    v-=1\n    u-=1\n    pi=iadj[u].setdefault(v,0)\n    iadj[u][v]=1+pi  # road from v->u\n    nadj[v]+=1\n\nSo nadj[v] is the count of outgoing edges from v. \n\nThen, in the loop over u in iadj[v], which are the predecessors of v (i.e., edges from u to v), the code does nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]. \n\nWait, this is subtracting the number of edges from u to v from the total outgoing edges of u. \n\nBut that would be incorrect because nadj[u] is the total outgoing edges from u. \n\nFor example, if u has two edges to v, then iadj[v][u] is 2. So this line would subtract 2 from nadj[u], which is the total outgoing edges of u. But that's wrong because those edges are part of u's outgoing edges. \n\nTherefore, this line is incorrect and must be removed. \n\nBut since the user is to output only the missing code, perhaps this line is part of the existing code and the user must not touch it. \n\nIn that case, the code would be incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is part of the code that is supposed to be there but is incorrect, and the user must replace it with the correct code. But the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is not part of the code that should be there. \n\nWait, perhaps the line is part of an incorrect approach and should be removed. But since the user can't remove lines, only fill in the missing code, this is a problem. \n\nHmm, perhaps the line is not needed. Let me think of the code without that line. \n\nIf we remove the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u], then the code proceeds as follows:\n\nThe cost for u is computed as cost[v] + nadj[u]. \n\nIn the first sample where u has 1 outgoing edge (to v), then the cost would be correct. \n\nSo the line is incorrect and must be removed. \n\nBut since the user can't remove lines, only fill in the missing code, perhaps the line is part of the code that is not needed and the user must not include it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is part of the code that is supposed to be there but is incorrect, and the user must replace it with the correct code. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nHmm, this is a bit of a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is part of the code that is correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the line is part of the code to compute the number of edges that are not leading to v. \n\nWait, the formula for the cost[u] is cost[v] + (number of edges from u excluding those to v) + 1 (the move day) plus the cost[v]. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is trying to compute the number of edges from u that are not to v. \n\nWait, the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is subtracting the number of edges from u to v from the total outgoing edges of u. \n\nSo after this line, nadj[u] would be the number of edges from u that are not to v. \n\nThen, the formula cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 would be: \n\n(number of edges not leading to v) + 1 (the days to block those edges) plus the cost[v]. \n\nWait, but then the move to v would take 1 day. \n\nWait, the total days would be:\n\n(number of edges not leading to v) (days to block them) + 1 (the move day) + cost[v]. \n\nSo the formula would be (nadj[u] - edges_to_v) + 1 + cost[v]. \n\nBut after subtracting edges_to_v from nadj[u], the new nadj[u] is (original nadj[u] - edges_to_v). \n\nSo the formula would be (nadj[u] (after subtraction) ) + 1 + cost[v]. \n\nWait, but the code's current formula is cost[v] + nadj[u] (after subtraction) + 1. \n\nWhich would be exactly that. \n\nAh! So perhaps the line is correct, and the formula is also correct. \n\nWait, let me re-express this:\n\nThe number of edges from u to v is stored in iadj[v][u]. \n\nThe total outgoing edges from u is nadj[u]. \n\nThe number of edges from u that are not to v is nadj[u] - iadj[v][u]. \n\nTo block all edges except those to v, you need to block (nadj[u] - iadj[v][u]) edges. \n\nEach block takes a day. \n\nThen, you can move to v (1 day). \n\nThen, the cost from v is cost[v]. \n\nSo total days: (nadj[u] - iadj[v][u]) + 1 + cost[v]. \n\nBut the code's formula is cost[v] + (nadj[u] after subtraction) + 1. \n\nAfter the subtraction, nadj[u] is (original nadj[u] - iadj[v][u]). \n\nSo the formula becomes (original nadj[u] - iadj[v][u]) + 1 + cost[v]. \n\nWhich matches the required formula. \n\nAh! So the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is correct. \n\nThen the formula is correct. \n\nSo the code's current formula is cost[v] + nadj[u] (after subtraction) + 1. \n\nWait, but the code's line is:\n\nif cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 < cost[u]:\n\nYes. \n\nSo the line is correct. \n\nThen why in the first sample where u has 1 edge to v (so iadj[v][u] is 1), the nadj[u] after subtraction would be 0. \n\nSo the formula would be cost[v] (0) + 0 +1 = 1, which is correct. \n\nAh! So the line is correct. \n\nSo the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is correct. \n\nThen the formula is correct. \n\nSo the missing code is indeed:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 \n\nWait no, the condition is cost[v] + nadj[u] +1 < cost[u]. \n\nWait, the code's condition is correct. \n\nSo the code inside the if block should set cost[u] to the new cost and push to the queue. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 \n\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nWait, but the condition is checking if the new cost is better than current cost[u]. \n\nSo the code inside the if block should be:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1 \n\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nYes. \n\nSo the missing code is those two lines. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\ncost[u] = cost[v] + nadj[u] + 1\nheapq.heappush(q, (cost[u], u))\n\nAh! So I was initially mistaken in thinking that the formula was wrong, but the line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u] is actually correct. \n\nSo the line is correct, and the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the two lines above. \n\nLet me verify with the first sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the first sample has a direct path from 1 to 3 (nodes 0 and 2 in 0-based). \n\nThe code starts with cost[2] =0. \n\nProcessing node v=2 (n-1=2). \n\nThe predecessors u of v (node 2) are node 0 (since there's an edge from 0 to 2). \n\nFor u=0:\n\nThe line nadj[u] -= iadj[v][u]. \n\niadj[v][u] is the number of edges from u to v. \n\nIn this case, it's 1 (the edge 0->2). \n\nnadj[u] was initially 1 (since node 0 has one outgoing edge). \n\nAfter subtraction, nadj[u] becomes 0. \n\nThe condition is cost[v] (0) + nadj[u] (0) +1 (1) < cost[u] (which is initially infinity). \n\nSo yes. \n\nThen, cost[u] is set to 1, and pushed to the queue. \n\nThus, the final cost[0] is 1, which matches the sample's answer. \n\nSo the code is correct with those two lines. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the two lines I mentioned. \n\nSo the correct answer is to output those two lines."
