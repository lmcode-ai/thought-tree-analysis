The task is to find the maximum possible score of an array after replacing zeros with arbitrary integers. The score is the number of indices i where the sum up to i is zero. Hmm, the approach here probably involves looking at the prefix sums. Because the score depends on when the prefix sum reaches zero. The key idea is that by changing zeros, we can adjust the prefix sums to hit zero as many times as possible. Looking at the code provided, there's a map mp that tracks the frequency of each prefix sum.",

Then, if flag is true, it adds the count of zero, else the max_freq. But I'm not sure what the flag is for. The initial code has 'flag' set to true, but maybe that's part of the incomplete code.",

Thus, those points can be turned into zeros in the prefix sum. Wait, here's a better way to think: Suppose the prefix sum sequence is S_0, S_1, ..., S_n (where S_0=0, S_i is sum up to a_i). The score is the number of i where S_i =0. But in our problem, we can modify the array elements (only when they are zero) to change the S_i's. The goal is to choose the values for the zeros such that as many S_i's as possible are zero. The key idea is that for any two indices i and j where S_i = S_j, the sum from a_{i+1} to a_j must be zero. If between i and j there are some zeros, we can set their values to adjust the sum between i and j to be zero. So, if S_i = S_j, then by choosing the zeros in between, we can make the sum between them zero, so that S_j = S_i + (sum between) = S_i. But if we want S_j to be zero, then S_i must be zero.

The sum between them is zero (because S_j = S_i + sum_{i+1 to j} (a's or x's). If there are zeros between them, we can set their x's so that the total sum between them is zero. Therefore, the number of occurrences of S can stay the same as the original count. Wait, but if there are multiple zeros between them, can we create more occurrences of S? Hmm, perhaps not. Because the prefix sum must be S at both i and j. The sum between them must be zero. Therefore, the number of occurrences of S can't be increased beyond the original count. Therefore, the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the original array.

This suggests that the maximum possible score is not directly tied to the number of zeros. Hmm, so what's the correct approach?

The optimal strategy is to choose the values of the zeros such that as many S_i's as possible are zero. The key is that each zero in the array allows us to choose the next prefix sum freely. Therefore, the problem can be viewed as a path where at each zero, we can choose the next step to reach zero. The optimal path would be to set as many S_i's to zero as possible.",

But this is not straightforward. The correct approach is the greedy one I described earlier. The code should be implemented as follows: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, score=0. For each element in the array: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   current_sum =0 \n\n   score +=1 \n\nelse: \n\n   current_sum += a[i] \n\n   if current_sum ==0: \n\n      score +=1 \n\nThis is the correct approach. Therefore, the missing code in the original code's 'TODO' section is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nBut then, the code's current_sum is being updated by adding a[i] (which is zero) after the if block. So the code would be: \n\nif(a[i]==0) \n\n{ \n\n    curr_sum =0; \n\n} \n\nthen curr_sum +=a[i]; \n\nBut this would add the a[i] (which is zero) to curr_sum, so the net effect is curr_sum remains zero.

No, that doesn't make sense. Given the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the maximum frequency of any prefix sum.

The maximum frequency is 2 (for 2). But the optimal score is 1. This suggests that the approach is incorrect. Hmm, this is a problem. Wait, in the example [2,0,-2], the optimal score is 1.",

But I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach of the maximum frequency of the prefix sums. The first example's maximum frequency is 3 (for 2 in the original array), but the correct answer is 3. The second example's maximum frequency is 1 (for 1), which matches the answer. The third example's maximum frequency is 1 (for 0), which matches. The example [2,0,-2] has original prefix sums 2,2,0. The maximum frequency is 2 (for 2). But the correct answer is 1. This suggests that the approach is incorrect. Therefore, the correct approach must be the greedy one. The missing code in the 'if' block is to set curr_sum to zero. So the code inside the 'if' block is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nBut then, the code adds a[i] (which is zero) to curr_sum, so the net effect is curr_sum remains zero. This is correct. The rest of the code's logic is incorrect, but the problem requires to complete the given code. The given code's logic is to compute the maximum frequency of the prefix sums. But with the missing code filled in as curr_sum =0, the code would compute the frequencies of the modified prefix sums. For example, in the first example: \n\nThe prefix sums after modification are 2,0,1,0,0. The frequencies are 0:3, 1:1, 2:1. The maximum frequency is 3, which is correct. In the example [2,0,-2], the modified prefix sums are 2,0,-2. The frequencies are 2:1, 0:1, -2:1. The maximum frequency is 1, which matches the correct answer. In the example [0,3,-3,0], the modified prefix sums are 0,0,0,0. The maximum frequency is 4, which is correct. In the example [0,1,-1,0], the modified prefix sums are 0,0,0,0. The maximum frequency is 4, but the correct score is 3. Wait, no. The modified array would be [0,0,-1,0]. The prefix sums are 0,0, -1, 0. The frequencies are 0:3, -1:1.",

Ah, right. So the maximum frequency approach works when the code is modified to set the current_sum to zero when a[i] is zero. Thus, the missing code is to set curr_sum to zero inside the 'if' block. Therefore, the missing code is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nThis will ensure that whenever a[i] is zero, the current_sum is set to zero before adding the a[i] (which is zero) to it. Thus, the code inside the 'if' block is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nThe rest of the code's logic will then track the frequencies of the modified prefix sums. The maximum frequency of any prefix sum will be the maximum possible score. This approach works for all the examples. Therefore, the missing code is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; So the code inside the 'if' block is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nThe rest of the code's logic will compute the maximum frequency of the modified prefix sums, which is the correct answer.

The correct approach must be the greedy one I described earlier. The code needs to be implemented as follows: Initialize current_sum =0, score=0. For each element in the array: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   current_sum =0 \n\n   score +=1 \n\nelse: \n\n   current_sum += a[i] \n\n   if current_sum ==0: \n\n      score +=1 \n\nThis is the correct approach.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to find the maximum possible score of an array after replacing zeros with arbitrary integers. The score is the number of indices i where the sum up to i is zero. \n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves looking at the prefix sums. Because the score depends on when the prefix sum reaches zero. The key idea is that by changing zeros, we can adjust the prefix sums to hit zero as many times as possible.\n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a map mp that tracks the frequency of each prefix sum. The current approach seems to be counting the maximum frequency of any prefix sum, but I'm not sure how that connects to the answer. Wait, maybe the idea is that if a certain prefix sum occurs multiple times, we can set the zeros in between to adjust the sums so that they reach zero at those points. \n\nWait, let me think again. The code uses a map to track the occurrences of each prefix sum. The variable max_freq is the maximum count of any prefix sum. Then, if flag is true, it adds the count of zero, else the max_freq. But I'm not sure what the flag is for. The initial code has 'flag' set to true, but maybe that's part of the incomplete code.\n\nThe problem allows us to replace zeros with any integer. So whenever there's a zero in the array, we can choose what to put there to influence the prefix sums. The goal is to maximize the number of times the prefix sum is zero.\n\nLet me think of the example given. In the first test case, after replacing a_2 with -2, the array becomes [2, -2, 1, -1, 0]. The prefix sums are 2, 0, 1, 0, 0. So the zeros occur at positions 2,4,5. So the score is 3. \n\nThe approach here might involve considering the prefix sums and how we can adjust the zeros to make certain sums hit zero. \n\nThe code provided uses a map to track the frequency of each prefix sum. The maximum frequency of any prefix sum (max_freq) might be part of the solution. Because if a certain sum occurs k times, then by adjusting the zeros between those occurrences, we can set those points to reach zero. For example, if the same prefix sum occurs at indices i and j, then between them, the sum from i+1 to j must be zero. So by setting the zeros in that interval to adjust the sum, we can make the prefix sum at j equal to the prefix sum at i, but maybe we can set it to zero?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum plus whether the total sum can be zero. Wait, maybe the formula is that the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum, plus 1 if the total sum is zero. Or something like that.\n\nWait, let's think of the standard approach for such problems. The maximum number of times the prefix sum can be zero is determined by how we can set the zeros in the array. The key idea is that whenever there's a zero in the array, we can choose its value to adjust the prefix sum in a way that allows more zeros in the prefix sums.\n\nThe optimal strategy would be to make as many prefix sums as possible equal to each other, so that by adjusting the zeros between those points, we can set those points to zero. For instance, if a certain prefix sum S occurs m times, then between each pair of consecutive occurrences, we can set the values (using the zeros) such that the sum between them is zero. Thus, those points can be turned into zeros in the prefix sum. \n\nWait, here's a better way to think: Suppose the prefix sum sequence is S_0, S_1, ..., S_n (where S_0=0, S_i is sum up to a_i). The score is the number of i where S_i =0. \n\nBut in our problem, we can modify the array elements (only when they are zero) to change the S_i's. The goal is to choose the values for the zeros such that as many S_i's as possible are zero. \n\nThe key idea is that for any two indices i and j where S_i = S_j, the sum from a_{i+1} to a_j must be zero. If between i and j there are some zeros, we can set their values to adjust the sum between i and j to be zero. So, if S_i = S_j, then by choosing the zeros in between, we can make the sum between them zero, so that S_j = S_i + (sum between) = S_i. But if we want S_j to be zero, then S_i must be zero. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible score is the maximum number of times a particular prefix sum occurs, plus 1 if the total sum is zero. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the most frequent prefix sum (excluding the initial 0?) occurs k times. Then, by adjusting the zeros between those occurrences, we can set those points to have the same sum, but perhaps we can turn them into zeros. Wait, maybe the maximum possible is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. Because each time that sum occurs, you can set the next elements (using zeros) to make the next sum reach zero again. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose the original array has prefix sums like 0, 2, 2, 0, 0. The frequencies are 0 occurs 3 times, 2 occurs 2 times. The maximum frequency is 3. The score here would be 3 (the zeros at positions 0,3,4). But if we can adjust the array to have more zeros in the prefix sums, maybe by changing some elements. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. Because if a certain value S occurs m times, then you can set the elements between those occurrences to make the sum between them zero, so that each occurrence can be turned into a zero. Wait, perhaps the idea is that between two occurrences of the same prefix sum S, you can adjust the elements (using the zeros) so that the sum between them is zero, so that the next occurrence can be S again, but then you can set S to zero. \n\nHmm, maybe the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. Because each time that sum occurs, you can choose to set the next elements (using zeros) so that the next occurrence can be adjusted to reach zero. \n\nWait, let me think of the first example given. The original array after modification has prefix sums 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? The problem says indices 1-based). The example's array is [2, -2, 1, -1, 0]. The prefix sums are 2, 0, 1, 0, 0. So the counts are 0 occurs 3 times (positions 2,4,5?), so the maximum frequency is 3, which matches the answer. \n\nAnother example: the second test case's optimal is 1. Suppose the original array had a prefix sum that only occurs once except for maybe the end. \n\nSo the approach is to compute the frequency of each prefix sum, and the maximum frequency among them is the answer. But wait, what about the total sum? Because if the total sum is zero, then the last element can be part of the count. \n\nWait, the maximum frequency includes all occurrences. For example, if the prefix sum 0 occurs k times, then the maximum frequency would be k, so the answer would be k. Which is exactly the case when you can have all those points as zeros. \n\nSo the algorithm is: compute the prefix sums, track the frequency of each sum. The maximum frequency among all prefix sums is the maximum possible score. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the initial array (before modification) might have a different set of prefix sums. But by changing the zeros, we can adjust the prefix sums to have more occurrences of a particular sum. \n\nAh, right. The key is that when there are zeros in the array, we can choose their values to adjust the prefix sums. So the optimal way is to choose the values such that as many prefix sums as possible are the same. Because then, those can be turned into zeros by adjusting the values between them. \n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to choose a target value (like zero) and set the array elements (using the zeros) so that as many prefix sums as possible are zero. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem reduces to choosing the array elements (for the zeros) such that the number of times the prefix sum is zero is maximized. To do this, we can model it as choosing the values for the zeros such that the prefix sums hit zero as often as possible. \n\nThe key insight here is that the maximum possible score is equal to the maximum number of times any particular prefix sum occurs in the original array (before any modifications), plus possibly 1 if the total sum can be adjusted to zero. Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the best we can do is to make as many prefix sums as possible equal to some value, and then set that value to zero. For example, if a certain sum S occurs m times, then by setting the zeros in the array such that between each occurrence of S, the sum between them is zero, then all those m occurrences can be turned into zeros. So the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is to compute all prefix sums (including the initial 0?), then the maximum frequency of any sum is the answer. \n\nWait, but in the code provided, the initial code starts with curr_sum as 0? Let me check the code:\n\nIn the code, the loop starts with curr_sum being 0, and for each element a[i], it adds a[i] to curr_sum. So the first element's a[0] is added to curr_sum (starting at 0). So the prefix sums are S_1, S_2, ..., S_n, where S_i is the sum of the first i elements. The initial 0 (S_0) is not included in the map. \n\nWait, in the code, the initial curr_sum is 0, but before the loop, it's not stored. Let me see:\n\nThe code initializes curr_sum to 0. Then, for each element in the array (from i=0 to n-1), it adds a[i] to curr_sum. So the first iteration adds a[0], so curr_sum becomes S_1. Then, the code increments the count in the map for curr_sum. \n\nWait, the code's loop is:\n\nfor each element a[i], read it. Then, if a[i] is zero, do something (the TODO part). Then, add a[i] to curr_sum. Then, increment the count of curr_sum in the map, and update max_freq. \n\nWait, the order is important here. The code first reads a[i], then if a[i] is zero, do something (the missing code). Then adds a[i] to curr_sum, then updates the map. \n\nHmm, but the problem allows us to replace a zero with any integer. So when a[i] is zero, we can choose its value. The code's current approach is not considering that. The current code is processing the array as given, but we need to account for the possibility of changing zeros. \n\nTherefore, the existing code is not correct. The problem is that the code is not considering the possibility of changing the zeros. So the approach must be adjusted. \n\nHmm, so the correct approach must model the best possible way to set the zeros to maximize the number of prefix sums equal to zero. \n\nLet me think of the problem again. Let's consider that whenever we have a zero in the array, we can choose its value to be any integer. So, the idea is to choose those values such that as many prefix sums as possible are zero. \n\nThe key is that the zeros can be used to \"reset\" the prefix sum. Let me think of the prefix sums as a sequence. Let's denote the original array as a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The prefix sum after the first element is S_1 = a_1. After the second, S_2 = S_1 + a_2, etc. \n\nBut when a_i is zero, we can choose its value to be x_i. So the actual a_i can be x_i. \n\nThe problem is to choose all x_i (for a_i=0) such that the number of indices i where S_i =0 is maximized. \n\nThe question is, how to choose the x_i's to maximize this count. \n\nLet me think of the prefix sums as variables that can be adjusted at the positions where a_i is zero. \n\nSuppose we have a sequence of prefix sums S_0=0, S_1, S_2, ..., S_n. \n\nWe can choose the values of the a_i's (when they are zero) to adjust the S_i's. \n\nThe goal is to choose these values so that as many S_i's as possible are zero. \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum possible number of zeros in the S_i's (for i from 1 to n). \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal way is to set the variables such that the prefix sums form a sequence where as many as possible of them are zero. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the prefix sums. Let me denote the original array's elements as a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each position i where a_i is zero, we can choose a value x_i to replace it. \n\nThe prefix sum S_i is equal to S_{i-1} + (a_i if a_i !=0 else x_i). \n\nWe need to choose all x_i's (for a_i=0) such that the number of S_i's equal to zero is maximized. \n\nThe question is, how to choose the x_i's to maximize this count. \n\nLet me think of the problem as a dynamic programming problem, but given the constraints (n up to 2e5), that's probably not feasible. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. \n\nSuppose we have a list of the positions where a_i is zero. Let's call these positions Z. \n\nThe idea is to choose the x_i's such that the prefix sums hit zero as often as possible. \n\nLet me think of the prefix sums as a path. Each time we have a zero, we can choose the step (x_i) to adjust the path. \n\nThe key is that whenever there is a zero, we can choose the next step to reach a desired value. \n\nThe optimal strategy would be to make as many S_i's as possible equal to zero. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the existing non-zero elements and the zeros. \n\nSuppose we have the current prefix sum up to position i-1 as S_{i-1}. \n\nIf a_i is not zero, then S_i = S_{i-1} + a_i. \n\nIf a_i is zero, then we can choose x_i such that S_i = S_{i-1} + x_i. \n\nWe can choose x_i to set S_i to any desired value. \n\nThe goal is to choose these x_i's so that as many S_i's as possible are zero. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nWe can choose the x_i's such that whenever there is a zero, we can set the next prefix sum to whatever we want. \n\nTherefore, the optimal way is to set the x_i's such that whenever possible, the prefix sum reaches zero. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nPerhaps the maximum possible score is the number of times the prefix sum can be \"reset\" to zero by choosing the x_i's. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into choosing the x_i's such that the number of zeros in the prefix sums is maximized. \n\nLet me think of the problem as building the prefix sums step by step. \n\nAt each step, if the current element is non-zero, then the next prefix sum is fixed. \n\nIf it is zero, then we can choose the next prefix sum to be any value. \n\nThe goal is to choose these values to maximize the number of times the prefix sum is zero. \n\nLet me think of this as a greedy approach. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each position i: \n\nIf a_i is not zero, then S_i is fixed as S_{i-1} + a_i. \n\nIf a_i is zero, then we can choose S_i to be any value. \n\nWe want to choose S_i such that as many future S_j's can be zero. \n\nAlternatively, whenever we have a choice (a_i is zero), we can set S_i to zero, but that might interfere with future possibilities. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal approach is to set the current S_i to zero whenever possible, but that might not be the best. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible score is equal to the number of times the current prefix sum can be adjusted to hit zero, plus the existing zeros in the prefix sums. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the code given. \n\nThe code uses a map to track the frequency of each prefix sum. The maximum frequency of any prefix sum is stored in max_freq. \n\nThen, the answer is either max_freq or the count of zeros in the prefix sums plus something. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. Because whenever a certain sum S occurs m times, we can choose the zeros between those occurrences to adjust the path so that all those m points can be made to have S_i =0. \n\nWait, let me think of this. Suppose the prefix sum S occurs at indices i_1, i_2, ..., i_m. \n\nBetween i_1 and i_2, the sum from i_1+1 to i_2 is S_{i_2} - S_{i_1} = 0 (since S_{i_2}=S). \n\nIf there are zeros in that interval, we can set their values so that the sum between i_1 and i_2 is zero. \n\nWait, but the sum between i_1 and i_2 is already S_{i_2} - S_{i_1} =0. So if there are zeros in that interval, we can adjust their values to make the sum between them zero. \n\nWait, but the existing elements between i_1 and i_2 (excluding the zeros) contribute to the sum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key idea is that the maximum possible score is the maximum number of times any prefix sum occurs. Because for each occurrence of a sum S, you can choose to set the next elements (using the zeros) so that the next occurrence can be adjusted to reach zero. \n\nWait, maybe the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. \n\nLet me see the first example. \n\nOriginal array (before modification) is [2,0,1,-1,0]. The initial prefix sums (without any changes) would be:\n\nS_1 =2, S_2=2 +0=2, S_3=3, S_4=2, S_5=2. \n\nThe frequencies are 2 occurs 3 times (positions 1,2,4,5?), so the maximum frequency is 3. Which matches the example's answer of 3. \n\nWait, but in the example, after modification, the prefix sums are 2,0,1,0,0. The frequencies of 0 are 3, which is the maximum. \n\nAh, so the idea is that by changing the zeros, we can make the prefix sums have a higher frequency of a particular value (like zero). \n\nTherefore, the optimal approach is to choose the target value (like zero) and set the zeros such that as many prefix sums as possible are equal to that target. \n\nThe maximum possible score is the maximum number of times any prefix sum can be made to occur, which is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the original array plus the ability to adjust zeros to increase that frequency. \n\nWait, but how do we model this? \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be rephrased as follows: \n\nWe can choose the values for the zeros such that the prefix sums can be adjusted to have as many occurrences of a particular value as possible. The maximum possible score is the maximum number of such occurrences, because those can all be set to zero. \n\nWait, but how do we choose which value to target? \n\nThe best choice is to choose the value that already has the highest frequency in the original prefix sums. Because then, by adjusting the zeros between those occurrences, we can make all those occurrences have the same value, and then set that value to zero. \n\nWait, here's the key idea: \n\nSuppose the original prefix sums (without any changes) have a certain set of values. The maximum frequency among these is m. \n\nBy changing the zeros, we can make all occurrences of a particular sum S (the one with maximum frequency) to be adjusted so that they can be turned into zeros. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nSuppose the original prefix sums have a certain value S occurring k times. \n\nBetween any two consecutive occurrences of S, say at positions i and j, the sum from i+1 to j must be zero (since S_j = S_i + sum_{i+1 to j} a's). \n\nIf there are zeros in that interval, we can set their values to adjust the sum between i and j to be zero. \n\nWait, but the existing non-zero elements between i and j may contribute to the sum. \n\nWait, the sum between i and j (the original a's) plus the chosen x's (for zeros) must equal zero. \n\nSo, if the original sum between i and j (excluding the zeros) is T, then the sum of the chosen x's (for the zeros in that interval) must be -T. \n\nTherefore, as long as there are zeros in that interval, we can choose their values to make the total sum between i and j equal to zero. \n\nTherefore, between any two occurrences of S, we can adjust the zeros to make the sum between them zero, so that the next occurrence can be S again. \n\nWait, but if there are no zeros between i and j, then the existing sum between them must already be zero for S_j to equal S_i. \n\nTherefore, if the original sum between i and j (without any changes) is zero, then we can keep it as is. \n\nBut if there are zeros between them, we can adjust their values to make the sum between them zero. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of times a particular sum S can be achieved is equal to the number of times it occurs in the original prefix sums plus the number of intervals between them where we can insert zeros. \n\nWait, no. Actually, the number of occurrences of S can be increased by inserting more points where the prefix sum is S. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible number of times a particular sum S can be achieved is exactly the number of times it occurs in the original prefix sums. Because between any two occurrences, you can adjust the zeros to keep the sum the same. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose S occurs at positions i and j. The sum between them is zero (because S_j = S_i + sum_{i+1 to j} (a's or x's). \n\nIf there are zeros between them, we can set their x's so that the total sum between them is zero. \n\nTherefore, the number of occurrences of S can stay the same as the original count. \n\nWait, but if there are multiple zeros between them, can we create more occurrences of S? \n\nHmm, perhaps not. Because the prefix sum must be S at both i and j. The sum between them must be zero. \n\nTherefore, the number of occurrences of S can't be increased beyond the original count. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the original array. \n\nWait, but in the first example, the original array (before modification) had the prefix sums 2, 2, 3, 2, 2. The maximum frequency is 3 (for 2). But the optimal answer is 3, which is achieved by changing the zeros to make the prefix sums have three zeros. \n\nAh, so the original maximum frequency was for 2 (3 times), but by changing the zeros, we can turn those into zeros. \n\nAh! So the idea is that the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. Because you can choose to set the zeros such that all occurrences of that prefix sum become zero. \n\nWait, how? \n\nSuppose the maximum frequency is m for some sum S. \n\nThen, you can choose to set the zeros in such a way that every time the prefix sum reaches S, you can adjust the next elements (using zeros) so that the next occurrence of S can be turned into zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to do this is to set the target sum to zero. \n\nWait, here's the plan: \n\nThe maximum possible score is the maximum between the maximum frequency of any prefix sum and the count of zeros in the prefix sums plus 1 (if the total sum can be zero). \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. Because you can choose to set all the occurrences of that sum to zero. \n\nWait, let me think of the first example. The original array's prefix sums (without any changes) have S=2 occurring 3 times. The maximum frequency is 3. \n\nBy changing the zeros, we can set the values so that each occurrence of S=2 can be turned into zero. \n\nWait, how? \n\nSuppose the first occurrence is at position 1 (sum 2). \n\nThen, between positions 1 and 2 (the second occurrence of 2), the sum between them must be zero. \n\nIf the second occurrence is at position 2 (original a[1] was zero), then we can set a[1] to -2, so that the sum after position 2 is 0. \n\nThen, the third occurrence of 2 is at position 4. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that whenever a certain sum S occurs m times, you can choose to set all those m points to zero by adjusting the zeros between them. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is to compute all the prefix sums (including the initial 0?), track their frequencies, and the maximum frequency is the answer. \n\nWait, but in the code provided, the initial code does not include the initial 0. Let me see:\n\nThe code initializes curr_sum to 0. Then, for each element a[i], it adds a[i] to curr_sum. So the first element's a[0] is added to curr_sum (starting at 0). So the first prefix sum is S_1 = a[0], then S_2 = a[0]+a[1], etc. \n\nThe map is tracking the frequencies of these S_i's. \n\nThe maximum frequency among them is stored in max_freq. \n\nThen, the code has an 'if (flag)' condition. The initial flag is set to true. \n\nWait, the code's current logic is: \n\nans += mp[0] if flag is true, else max_freq. \n\nBut what is the flag for? \n\nThe code's initial flag is set to true. \n\nThe 'TODO' part is inside the loop when a[i] is zero. \n\nAh, perhaps the flag is used to determine whether the total sum can be zero. \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to handle the case where the total sum can be adjusted to zero. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flag is indicating whether there are any zeros in the array. \n\nHmm, the code's current structure is incomplete. The 'TODO' part is where the code needs to handle the case when a[i] is zero. \n\nThe problem is that the current code is not considering the possibility of changing the zeros. So the code is not correct. \n\nThe correct approach must account for the fact that when a[i] is zero, we can choose its value to adjust the prefix sums. \n\nTherefore, the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so I need to think of a different approach. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe maximum possible score is the maximum number of times a particular value can be achieved in the prefix sums, plus possibly 1 if the total can be adjusted to zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that whenever there is a zero in the array, we can choose its value to adjust the prefix sum to whatever we want. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing the values for the zeros such that the number of zeros in the prefix sums is maximized. \n\nThe key is that each zero in the array allows us to set the next prefix sum to any desired value. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be modeled as follows: \n\nWe can choose the values of the zeros to set the prefix sums to any desired values. The goal is to choose these values such that as many of the prefix sums as possible are zero. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to set the prefix sums to zero as often as possible. \n\nLet me think of the process step by step. \n\nInitialize S = 0 (the prefix sum before the first element). \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\nIf the element is non-zero, then the next prefix sum is S + a[i]. \n\nIf the element is zero, then we can choose the next prefix sum to be any value. \n\nWe want to choose this value such that as many future prefix sums can be zero. \n\nThe optimal choice here is to set the next prefix sum to zero. \n\nWait, but that might not be the best choice. \n\nAlternatively, whenever we have a zero, we can choose the next prefix sum to be whatever we want. \n\nThe best way to maximize the number of zeros is to set the next prefix sum to zero whenever possible. \n\nSo the strategy is: \n\nWhenever we have a zero, set the next prefix sum to zero. \n\nThis way, every time there's a zero, we can create a new zero in the prefix sum. \n\nBut this may not always be possible, because the previous prefix sum may not allow it. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose the current prefix sum is S. \n\nIf the current element is zero, then we can choose the next prefix sum to be any value. \n\nTo maximize the number of zeros, we can set it to zero. \n\nSo the next prefix sum is zero. \n\nThen, the next elements can be processed similarly. \n\nThis way, every zero can potentially create a new zero in the prefix sum. \n\nBut what about the non-zero elements? \n\nSuppose after setting a zero to make the prefix sum zero, the next element is non-zero. \n\nThen the next prefix sum will be zero plus a[i], so it's a[i]. \n\nIf that a[i] is non-zero, then that prefix sum won't be zero. \n\nBut if there's another zero after that, we can set it to make the next prefix sum zero again. \n\nSo the maximum possible score is the number of zeros in the array plus 1 (the initial zero?), but that can't be right. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. \n\nSuppose the array is [0,0,0]. \n\nThen, the optimal is to set each zero to make the prefix sums zero. \n\nThe first zero can be set to 0, so S_1 =0. \n\nThe second zero can be set to 0, so S_2 =0. \n\nThe third zero can be set to 0, so S_3=0. \n\nThus, the score is 3 (all three prefix sums are zero). \n\nThe number of zeros in the array is 3, so the score is 3. \n\nAnother example: array [0, 1, 0]. \n\nThe first zero can be set to 0 \u2192 S_1=0. \n\nThe second element is 1 \u2192 S_2 =1. \n\nThe third zero can be set to -1 \u2192 S_3 =0. \n\nThus, the score is 3 (positions 1,3). \n\nThe number of zeros is 2, but the score is 3. \n\nHmm, so the score can be higher than the number of zeros. \n\nSo the previous idea is not correct. \n\nAnother example: array [0]. \n\nWe can set it to 0 \u2192 score 1. \n\nSo the score equals the number of zeros plus 1? \n\nWait, the array has one element (zero), and the score is 1. \n\nSo the number of zeros is 1, score is 1. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother example: array [0,0]. \n\nSet first zero to 0 \u2192 S_1=0. \n\nSecond zero can be set to 0 \u2192 S_2=0. \n\nScore is 2. \n\nSo the score equals the number of zeros. \n\nHmm, so the score can be equal to the number of zeros plus 1? \n\nWait, in the first example with three zeros, the score is 3, which is the number of zeros. \n\nWait, maybe the maximum possible score is the number of zeros plus 1? \n\nNo, in the example with [0,1,0], the number of zeros is 2, and the score is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nWait, in that example, the third element is set to -1, so the third prefix sum is 0. \n\nSo the score is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nWait, the first element is zero, so the first prefix sum is zero. \n\nThe second element is 1, so the second prefix sum is 1. \n\nThe third element is set to -1, so the third prefix sum is 0. \n\nThus, the score is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nThe number of zeros is 2, so the score is 2. \n\nHmm, so the score equals the number of zeros plus the initial zero? \n\nNo, the initial zero is not counted because the problem counts indices from 1 to n. \n\nWait, the problem says the score is the number of indices i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) where the sum up to i is zero. \n\nSo the initial zero (before the first element) is not counted. \n\nSo in the example [0], the first prefix sum is zero (since the element is set to zero), so the score is 1. \n\nThe number of zeros in the array is 1, so the score equals the number of zeros. \n\nIn the example [0,1,0], the score is 2 (positions 1 and 3), which is the number of zeros (2). \n\nIn the example [0,0,0], the score is 3 (all three positions), which is the number of zeros (3). \n\nAnother example: array [0, 2, 0]. \n\nWe can set the first zero to 0 \u2192 S_1=0. \n\nThe second element is 2 \u2192 S_2=2. \n\nThe third zero can be set to -2 \u2192 S_3=0. \n\nScore is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nNumber of zeros is 2 \u2192 score is 2. \n\nHmm, so the score is equal to the number of zeros in the array. \n\nWait, but what if there are non-zero elements between zeros? \n\nAnother example: array [0, 0]. \n\nScore is 2 (both positions). \n\nNumber of zeros is 2 \u2192 score is 2. \n\nAnother example: array [0, 3, 0]. \n\nSet first zero to 0 \u2192 S_1=0. \n\nSecond element is 3 \u2192 S_2=3. \n\nThird zero can be set to -3 \u2192 S_3=0. \n\nScore is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nNumber of zeros is 2 \u2192 score is 2. \n\nHmm, so the score is the number of zeros in the array. \n\nWait, but what if there are non-zero elements that can be used to create more zeros? \n\nWait, let's think of an array with no zeros. \n\nExample: [2, -2]. \n\nNo zeros. So we can't change anything. The prefix sums are 2 and 0. So the score is 1 (the second element). \n\nThe number of zeros in the array is 0 \u2192 score is 1. \n\nSo the score can be higher than the number of zeros. \n\nAh, so the previous idea is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so the score can be higher than the number of zeros. \n\nSo the initial approach of counting the maximum frequency of any prefix sum is better. \n\nLet me think of the example [2, -2]. \n\nThe original prefix sums are 2 and 0. \n\nThe frequencies are 2:1, 0:1. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 1. \n\nBut the score is 1, which matches the maximum frequency. \n\nAnother example: [2,0,-2]. \n\nOriginal prefix sums (without changes) are 2, 2, 0. \n\nThe frequencies are 2:2, 0:1. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 2. \n\nBy changing the zero to -2, the array becomes [2,-2,-2]. \n\nThe prefix sums are 2, 0, -2 \u2192 score is 1. \n\nWait, that's worse. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the optimal choice would be to set the zero to 0. \n\nThen the array is [2,0,-2]. \n\nThe prefix sums are 2, 2, 0. \n\nThe score is 1 (the third element). \n\nBut the maximum frequency of 2 is 2. \n\nSo the maximum frequency is 2, but the score is 1. \n\nHmm, this contradicts the previous idea. \n\nWait, what's the optimal choice here? \n\nThe array is [2,0,-2]. \n\nWe can choose the second element (the zero) to be set to -2. \n\nThen the array becomes [2, -2, -2]. \n\nThe prefix sums are 2, 0, -2 \u2192 score is 1 (the second element). \n\nAlternatively, set the zero to 0 \u2192 prefix sums 2,2,0 \u2192 score is 1 (third element). \n\nAlternatively, set the zero to -4 \u2192 then the second prefix sum is -2, third is -6 \u2192 score 0. \n\nHmm, so the best is to set the zero to -2, giving a score of 1. \n\nBut the maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the original array is 2 (for 2). \n\nBut the maximum possible score is 1. \n\nSo the previous idea is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so the maximum frequency approach is not correct. \n\nThis means I need to think differently. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nThe score is the number of times the prefix sum reaches zero. \n\nWe can choose the values of the zeros to set the prefix sums to zero as often as possible. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to choose the values such that every time there is a zero, we can set the next prefix sum to zero. \n\nLet me think of the process step by step. \n\nWe can model this as follows: \n\nWe can choose the value of each zero to set the next prefix sum to whatever we want. \n\nThe goal is to maximize the number of times the prefix sum is zero. \n\nLet me think of the prefix sums as a sequence. \n\nWe can choose the values of the zeros to set certain points to zero. \n\nThe optimal way is to set as many of the prefix sums to zero as possible. \n\nThe maximum possible score is the number of zeros plus 1 (if the total can be zero). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nIn the example [2,0,-2], there is one zero. \n\nThe maximum possible score is 2? \n\nWait, how? \n\nIf we set the zero to -2, then the second prefix sum is zero. \n\nThe third element is -2, so the third prefix sum is 0. \n\nWait, no: \n\nOriginal array after setting the zero to -2: \n\n[2, -2, -2]. \n\nPrefix sums: \n\nS_1 =2 \n\nS_2 =0 \n\nS_3 =-2 \n\nSo the score is 1 (position 2). \n\nAlternatively, set the zero to 0: \n\nS_1=2, S_2=2, S_3=0 \u2192 score is 1 (position 3). \n\nAlternatively, set the zero to -4: \n\nS_1=2, S_2= -2, S_3= -4 \u2192 score 0. \n\nHmm, so the maximum possible score is 1. \n\nThe number of zeros is 1, so the score is 1. \n\nAnother example: [0,0]. \n\nThe maximum score is 2. \n\nNumber of zeros is 2 \u2192 score is 2. \n\nAnother example: [0, 3, 0]. \n\nThe zeros can be set to 0 and -3. \n\nThen the prefix sums are 0,3,0 \u2192 score is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nNumber of zeros is 2 \u2192 score is 2. \n\nAnother example: [0,0,0]. \n\nScore is 3 \u2192 number of zeros is 3. \n\nAnother example: [0, 2, -2]. \n\nThe zeros can be set to 0 and 0. \n\nThe prefix sums are 0,2,0 \u2192 score is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nNumber of zeros is 1 (the first element is zero, the third is non-zero). \n\nWait, the array has two zeros? \n\nWait the array is [0,2,-2]. The second element is 2, third is -2. So only one zero. \n\nThe score is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nSo the score is higher than the number of zeros. \n\nAh! Here's the case where the score exceeds the number of zeros. \n\nSo the previous idea is incorrect. \n\nIn this example, the array has one zero. \n\nThe optimal score is 2. \n\nSo the score can be higher than the number of zeros. \n\nHmm, so what's the pattern here? \n\nThe first zero is set to 0 (so S_1=0). \n\nThe second element is 2 \u2192 S_2=2. \n\nThe third element is -2 \u2192 S_3=0. \n\nSo the third element is not a zero in the array, but its value is chosen to be -2 (but it was not a zero in the original array). \n\nWait, no. The third element was originally -2, so it can't be changed. \n\nAh, right. So in this example, the third element is not a zero, so its value can't be changed. \n\nSo the third element's value is fixed. \n\nSo the third prefix sum is 2 + (-2) =0. \n\nSo the score is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nThe number of zeros in the array is 1. \n\nSo the score can be higher than the number of zeros. \n\nThis suggests that the maximum possible score is not directly tied to the number of zeros. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct approach? \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: \n\nThe score is the number of indices i where the prefix sum S_i is zero. \n\nWe can choose the values of the zeros in the array to set the S_i's to any desired values. \n\nThe goal is to maximize the count of zeros in the S_i's. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to choose the values of the zeros such that as many S_i's as possible are zero. \n\nThe key is that each zero in the array allows us to choose the next prefix sum freely. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be viewed as a path where at each zero, we can choose the next step to reach zero. \n\nThe optimal path would be to set as many S_i's to zero as possible. \n\nThe maximum possible score is the number of times we can set the prefix sums to zero, which depends on the positions of the zeros and the non-zero elements. \n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a greedy approach. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can track the current prefix sum and whenever we encounter a zero, we can set it to whatever value needed to make the current prefix sum zero. \n\nWait, but that might not be optimal. \n\nAlternatively, whenever we have a zero, we can set it to make the current prefix sum zero. \n\nLet me try this approach: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0. \n\nThe score starts at 0. \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\nIf the element is not zero: \n\ncurrent_sum += a[i]. \n\nIf current_sum is zero, increment the score. \n\nElse, continue. \n\nIf the element is zero: \n\nWe can choose its value to set current_sum to any desired value. \n\nTo maximize the score, we can set current_sum to zero. \n\nSo, set current_sum to zero. \n\nIncrement the score by 1 (since this position's prefix sum is zero). \n\nBut also, the next elements will start from this new current_sum. \n\nWait, but this might not be optimal. \n\nLet me see with the example [0,2,-2]. \n\nProcessing the first element (zero): \n\nSet current_sum to zero. \n\nScore is 1. \n\nSecond element is 2: current_sum becomes 2. \n\nNot zero. \n\nThird element is -2: current_sum becomes 0. \n\nScore increases to 2. \n\nTotal score is 2. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nAnother example: [2,0,-2]. \n\nProcessing first element (2): current_sum is 2. Not zero. \n\nSecond element is zero: set current_sum to zero. Score is 1. \n\nThird element is -2: current_sum becomes -2. Not zero. \n\nTotal score is 1. \n\nWhich matches the previous example. \n\nAnother example: [0,0,0]. \n\nProcessing first zero: set to zero \u2192 score 1. \n\nSecond zero: set to zero \u2192 score 2. \n\nThird zero: set to zero \u2192 score 3. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: [0,3,0]. \n\nFirst zero: set to zero \u2192 score 1. \n\nSecond element is 3 \u2192 current_sum 3. \n\nThird zero: set to -3 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score 2. \n\nTotal score 2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: [2,-2]. \n\nNo zeros. \n\nFirst element: current_sum 2 \u2192 not zero. \n\nSecond element: current_sum 0 \u2192 score 1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThis approach seems to work. \n\nThe algorithm is: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, score=0. \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\nif the element is zero: \n\n   set current_sum to 0. \n\n   increment score by 1. \n\nelse: \n\n   current_sum += a[i]. \n\n   if current_sum ==0: \n\n      increment score by 1. \n\nWait, but this is not correct. \n\nWait, let's see the first example given in the problem: \n\nThe first test case's array after modification is [2,-2,1,-1,0]. \n\nThe original array before modification was [2,0,1,-1,0]. \n\nUsing the algorithm above: \n\nProcessing the first element (2): \n\ncurrent_sum =2 \u2192 not zero. \n\nSecond element is zero \u2192 set current_sum to 0 \u2192 score becomes 1. \n\nThird element is 1 \u2192 current_sum becomes 1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nFourth element is -1 \u2192 current_sum becomes 0 \u2192 score increases to 2. \n\nFifth element is zero \u2192 set current_sum to 0 \u2192 score becomes 3. \n\nTotal score is 3, which matches the example. \n\nYes! \n\nAnother example: the second test case in the problem: \n\nInput array is [1,0,2000000000]. \n\nThe optimal is to set the zero to -1, making the array [1,-1,2000000000]. \n\nThe prefix sums are 1,0,2000000000 \u2192 score 1. \n\nUsing the algorithm: \n\nFirst element 1 \u2192 current_sum 1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nSecond element is zero \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score 1. \n\nThird element is 2000000000 \u2192 current_sum becomes 2000000000 \u2192 not zero. \n\nTotal score 1. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nThe third test case: array [0]. \n\nThe algorithm gives score 1, which is correct. \n\nSo this approach seems to work. \n\nThe algorithm is: \n\nWhenever we encounter a zero, we set the current prefix sum to zero, thus contributing to the score. \n\nFor non-zero elements, we just add them to the current sum and check if it's zero. \n\nThis greedy approach of setting zeros to make the current sum zero whenever possible gives the maximum possible score. \n\nTherefore, the code should be implemented as follows: \n\nInitialize current_sum to 0, score to 0. \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   current_sum =0 \n\n   score +=1 \n\nelse: \n\n   current_sum += a[i] \n\n   if current_sum ==0: \n\n      score +=1 \n\nThis would give the correct answer. \n\nBut wait, what about the following case: \n\nExample: [0, -1, 0]. \n\nUsing the algorithm: \n\nFirst zero \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score 1. \n\nSecond element is -1 \u2192 current_sum becomes -1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nThird zero \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 score becomes 2. \n\nTotal score 2. \n\nBut what if we set the third zero to 1? \n\nThen the third prefix sum would be 0 (current_sum after second element is -1, then adding 1 gives 0 \u2192 score increases to 3. \n\nAh! So the algorithm's approach is not optimal in this case. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe array is [0, -1, 0]. \n\nThe algorithm's approach gives score 2. \n\nBut what if we choose to set the third zero to 1: \n\nThe third element is set to 1 \u2192 the third prefix sum is -1 +1 =0 \u2192 score would be 3 (positions 1,3). \n\nSo the algorithm's approach is not optimal. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nSo the algorithm I thought of is not correct. \n\nHmm, so what's the optimal choice here? \n\nThe first zero is set to 0 \u2192 score 1. \n\nThe second element is -1 \u2192 current_sum is -1. \n\nThe third element is zero \u2192 we can choose its value to be 1 \u2192 current_sum becomes 0 \u2192 score increases by 1 (total 2). \n\nWait, no: \n\nAfter setting the third element to 1, the current_sum is -1 +1 =0 \u2192 so the third prefix sum is zero \u2192 score increases by 1 (total 2). \n\nWait, but the third element is a zero in the array, so we can choose its value. \n\nSo the third element's value is chosen to be 1 \u2192 the third prefix sum is 0 \u2192 score increases to 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nBut the algorithm's approach would set the third element to zero, making the third prefix sum zero (same result). \n\nWait, in that case, the algorithm's approach would also give score 2. \n\nWait, the third element is zero \u2192 the algorithm sets current_sum to zero. \n\nThe third prefix sum is zero \u2192 score increases by 1 (from 1 to 2). \n\nSo the algorithm's approach gives the correct score of 2. \n\nBut what if the third element is set to 1, then the third prefix sum is zero. \n\nThe algorithm's approach also achieves that by setting the third element to zero. \n\nSo the algorithm's approach is correct here. \n\nAnother example: \n\nArray [0, 1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe algorithm's approach: \n\nFirst zero \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score 1. \n\nSecond element 1 \u2192 current_sum 1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nThird element -1 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score increases to 2. \n\nFourth element zero \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 score 3. \n\nTotal score 3. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example where the algorithm might fail: \n\nArray [0, 1, 0, -1]. \n\nThe algorithm's approach: \n\nFirst zero \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score 1. \n\nSecond element 1 \u2192 current_sum 1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nThird zero \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score 2. \n\nFourth element -1 \u2192 current_sum -1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nTotal score 2. \n\nBut what if we set the third zero to -1: \n\nThen the third prefix sum is 1 + (-1) =0 \u2192 score increases to 2. \n\nFourth element is -1 \u2192 current_sum is 0 + (-1) =-1 \u2192 no. \n\nAlternatively, set the third zero to -2 \u2192 third prefix sum is 1-2 =-1 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, the maximum possible score is 2. \n\nThe algorithm's approach gives that. \n\nAnother example where the algorithm might not be optimal: \n\nArray [0, 3, -3, 0]. \n\nAlgorithm's approach: \n\nFirst zero \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score 1. \n\nSecond element 3 \u2192 current_sum 3 \u2192 not zero. \n\nThird element -3 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score 2. \n\nFourth zero \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 score 3. \n\nTotal score 3. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the algorithm is correct. \n\nThe previous example where I thought it might fail was not a case where it actually fails. \n\nSo the algorithm seems to work. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to greedily set each zero to make the current prefix sum zero, thus maximizing the score. \n\nTherefore, the code should be implemented as follows: \n\nInitialize current_sum to 0, score to 0. \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   current_sum =0 \n\n   score +=1 \n\nelse: \n\n   current_sum += a[i] \n\n   if current_sum ==0: \n\n      score +=1 \n\nThis would give the correct answer. \n\nNow, looking back at the original code provided: \n\nThe code uses a map to track the frequency of prefix sums and then takes the maximum frequency. \n\nBut this approach is incorrect, as seen in the first example. \n\nThe correct approach is the greedy one I just described. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the original code's 'TODO' section is where the code should handle the case when a[i] is zero. \n\nIn the original code's loop: \n\nfor(ll i=0;i<n;i++) \n\n{ \n\n    cin>>a[i]; \n\n    if(a[i]==0) \n\n    { \n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n    } \n\n    curr_sum +=a[i]; \n\n    max_freq = max(max_freq, ++mp[curr_sum]); \n\n} \n\nThe current code is not using the greedy approach. \n\nThe correct code should be to handle the zeros by setting the current_sum to zero and incrementing the score. \n\nBut the original code's logic is different. \n\nThe original code's logic is to track the frequency of prefix sums and then choose the maximum frequency. \n\nBut this is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct code should be rewritten. \n\nBut the problem says to complete the given code. \n\nThe given code's structure is using a map to track the frequency of prefix sums. \n\nBut that approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the maximum possible score is the maximum between the maximum frequency of any prefix sum and the count of zeros plus 1. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is the greedy one I described, and the given code needs to be modified to implement that. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is inside the 'if(a[i]==0)' block. \n\nThe original code's loop is: \n\nfor each element: \n\nread a[i]. \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   // TODO \n\nthen add a[i] to curr_sum. \n\nthen update the map. \n\nThe current code's logic is to track the frequency of prefix sums. \n\nBut the correct approach requires that when a[i] is zero, we can choose its value to set the current_sum to zero. \n\nTherefore, the code should set the current_sum to zero before adding it to the map. \n\nWait, but the current_sum is being updated after the if statement. \n\nSo the code's current flow is: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   // TODO \n\nthen add a[i] to curr_sum. \n\nBut if we want to set the current_sum to zero when a[i] is zero, then the code should do something like: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   curr_sum =0 \n\n   // but then adding a[i] (which is zero) would not change it. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe current_sum is being updated by adding a[i]. \n\nSo the code's current flow is: \n\ncurr_sum += a[i]. \n\nBut if a[i] is zero, then the code can choose to set the current_sum to zero. \n\nBut the current_sum is computed as previous curr_sum plus a[i]. \n\nTo set the current_sum to zero, we need to set it before adding a[i]. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. \n\nThe correct approach requires that when a[i] is zero, the current_sum is set to zero. \n\nBut the current_sum is computed as previous curr_sum plus the chosen value of a[i]. \n\nSo the chosen value of a[i] (when it is zero) is whatever we want. \n\nTherefore, the current_sum after processing a[i] is previous_curr_sum + x, where x is the chosen value (for the zero). \n\nTo set current_sum to zero, we choose x = -previous_curr_sum. \n\nThus, the new current_sum is zero. \n\nTherefore, the code should do this: \n\nWhen a[i] is zero: \n\n   x = -previous_curr_sum \n\n   current_sum += x \n\n   (which sets current_sum to zero) \n\n   and increment the score by 1 (since current_sum is zero). \n\nBut how to track this in the code. \n\nThe problem is that the code's current structure is not designed for this approach. \n\nThe original code uses a map to track the frequency of prefix sums. \n\nBut the correct approach requires a different approach. \n\nGiven that the problem requires to complete the given code, perhaps the correct approach is to use the maximum frequency of any prefix sum plus some adjustment. \n\nWait, let me think again about the first example. \n\nThe first example's optimal score is 3. \n\nThe prefix sums after modification are 2,0,1,0,0. \n\nThe frequencies are 0 occurs 3 times, 2 once, 1 once. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 3. \n\nWhich matches the answer. \n\nThe second example's optimal score is 1. \n\nThe original array's prefix sums (before modification) are 1, 1+0=1, 1+0+2e9=2e9+1. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 1 (for 1). \n\nBut the optimal score is 1. \n\nThe third example's array is [0]. \n\nThe prefix sum is 0. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 1. \n\nWhich matches the answer. \n\nThe example I thought of earlier where the array is [0,3,-3,0]. \n\nThe optimal score is 3. \n\nThe prefix sums after modification would be 0,0,0,0. \n\nThe frequencies of 0 is 4. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 4 \u2192 score is 4. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: [0,1,-1,0]. \n\nThe optimal score is 3. \n\nThe prefix sums after modification are 0,0,0,0. \n\nMaximum frequency is 4 \u2192 score 4? \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait the array is [0,1,-1,0]. \n\nThe optimal choice is to set the first zero to 0, the second element is 1 \u2192 current_sum 1. \n\nThen the third element is -1 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score increases. \n\nThe fourth zero is set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 score increases. \n\nThe prefix sums are 0,1,0,0 \u2192 score is 3 (positions 1,3,4). \n\nThe maximum frequency of 0 is 3. \n\nWhich matches the score. \n\nSo the maximum frequency approach gives the correct answer. \n\nThe previous example where I thought it was wrong: \n\nThe array [0,3,-3,0]. \n\nThe optimal score is 4 (all four positions). \n\nThe prefix sums would be 0,0,0,0. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 4 \u2192 which matches the score. \n\nSo the maximum frequency approach seems to work. \n\nThe earlier example where I thought it failed was incorrect. \n\nThe example where the array is [0,3,0]. \n\nThe optimal score is 2. \n\nThe maximum frequency of 0 is 2 (positions 1 and 3). \n\nWhich matches. \n\nThe example where the array is [0, -1, 0]. \n\nThe optimal score is 2. \n\nThe maximum frequency of 0 is 2. \n\nWhich matches. \n\nThe example where the array is [0,1,-1,0]. \n\nThe maximum frequency of 0 is 3 (positions 1,3,4). \n\nWhich matches the score of 3. \n\nThe example where the array is [2,0,-2]. \n\nThe optimal score is 1. \n\nThe original prefix sums (without modification) are 2,2,0. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 2 (for 2). \n\nBut the optimal score is 1. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the optimal score is 1. \n\nBut the maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the original array is 2 (for 2). \n\nBut the optimal score is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the maximum frequency approach is incorrect. \n\nWait, what's the optimal modification for the array [2,0,-2]. \n\nThe array is [2,0,-2]. \n\nWe can choose the zero to be set to -2. \n\nThen the array becomes [2,-2,-2]. \n\nThe prefix sums are 2,0, -2 \u2192 score is 1 (position 2). \n\nThe maximum frequency of any prefix sum is 1 (for 2 and 0 and -2). \n\nThe maximum frequency is 1. \n\nWhich matches the score. \n\nAh! So the maximum frequency approach would give 1, which is correct. \n\nThe original array's prefix sums (before modification) are 2,2,0. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 2 (for 2). \n\nBut after modification, the maximum frequency is 1. \n\nSo the maximum frequency approach requires that we can choose the values of the zeros to maximize the frequency of any particular sum. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency is the maximum over all possible choices of the zeros' values of the maximum frequency of any sum. \n\nThe optimal choice is to choose the values of the zeros such that the maximum frequency is maximized. \n\nThe maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any sum in the modified array. \n\nThe problem is to find this maximum possible frequency. \n\nThe key is that by choosing the zeros' values, we can adjust the prefix sums to have as many occurrences of a particular sum as possible. \n\nThe optimal choice is to choose the sum that can be made to occur the most times by adjusting the zeros. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency is the maximum over all possible target sums of the number of times that sum can be achieved by adjusting the zeros. \n\nThe optimal target sum is the one that allows the most occurrences. \n\nThe way to compute this is to track the prefix sums and the number of times each sum occurs, and also the number of zeros between occurrences. \n\nThis seems complex, but the initial approach of using the maximum frequency of the original prefix sums plus the ability to adjust zeros to increase that frequency may be the way to go. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible frequency is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum plus the number of zeros between its occurrences. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible frequency is the maximum number of times any prefix sum can be achieved by adjusting the zeros. \n\nThe optimal way is to choose a target sum S and set the zeros such that as many prefix sums as possible are S. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency is the maximum over all possible S of the number of times S can be achieved. \n\nTo compute this, we can consider the original prefix sums and the positions of the zeros. \n\nThe maximum frequency can be computed by considering for each prefix sum S, the number of times it occurs plus the number of zeros between its occurrences. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to realize that the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the original array plus the number of zeros between its occurrences. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum plus the number of zeros in the array. \n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to use the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. \n\nThe initial code's approach is to compute the maximum frequency of any prefix sum and that is the answer. \n\nIn the example [2,0,-2], the original prefix sums are 2,2,0. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 2 (for 2). \n\nBut the optimal score is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait, in the example [2,0,-2], the optimal score is 1. \n\nThe maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the modified array is 1 (for 0). \n\nBut the maximum frequency in the original array is 2 (for 2). \n\nSo the approach of taking the maximum frequency of the original array is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach must be different. \n\nThe correct approach must be the greedy one I described earlier. \n\nThe code needs to be implemented as follows: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, score=0. \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   current_sum =0 \n\n   score +=1 \n\nelse: \n\n   current_sum += a[i] \n\n   if current_sum ==0: \n\n      score +=1 \n\nThis is the correct approach. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the original code's 'TODO' section is: \n\nWhen a[i] is zero, we need to set the current_sum to zero before adding it to the map. \n\nBut the original code's loop is structured such that the curr_sum is updated after the if statement. \n\nSo the code's current flow is: \n\nfor each element: \n\n   read a[i]. \n\n   if a[i] is zero: \n\n      // TODO \n\n   curr_sum += a[i]. \n\n   update the map. \n\nThis is not the correct approach. \n\nThe correct approach requires that when a[i] is zero, the curr_sum is set to zero. \n\nBut the curr_sum is computed as previous curr_sum plus a[i]. \n\nTo set it to zero, we need to set curr_sum to zero. \n\nSo the code inside the 'if' block should be: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nBut then, when we add a[i] (which is zero) to curr_sum, it will remain zero. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe code's current flow is: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   // TODO \n\nthen curr_sum += a[i]. \n\nSo if we set curr_sum to zero inside the 'if' block, then adding a[i] (which is zero) will leave it as zero. \n\nBut this is not the correct way to set the current_sum to zero. \n\nThe correct way is to set the current_sum to zero, which is done by choosing the value of a[i] (which is zero) to be whatever needed to make the current_sum zero. \n\nThe chosen value of a[i] is x, so the new current_sum is previous_curr_sum + x. \n\nTo set current_sum to zero, x should be -previous_curr_sum. \n\nThus, the new current_sum is previous_curr_sum + x = previous_curr_sum - previous_curr_sum =0. \n\nTherefore, the code should set the current_sum to zero, and the a[i] is replaced by x = -previous_curr_sum. \n\nBut in the code's current structure, the a[i] is read first, then the if block is executed, then the curr_sum is updated by adding a[i]. \n\nThis is not the correct way to handle it. \n\nTherefore, the original code's structure is incorrect for the greedy approach. \n\nGiven that the problem requires to complete the given code, perhaps the correct approach is to use the maximum frequency of the prefix sums. \n\nBut in the example [2,0,-2], the maximum frequency in the original array is 2 (for 2), but the optimal score is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the maximum frequency approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the correct solution elsewhere. \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum possible score by replacing zeros with any integers. \n\nThe score is the number of indices where the prefix sum is zero. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to choose the values of the zeros such that as many prefix sums as possible are zero. \n\nThe key observation is that whenever there is a zero in the array, we can choose its value to set the current prefix sum to zero. \n\nThus, every zero can potentially contribute to a new zero in the prefix sum. \n\nThe optimal score is the number of zeros plus the number of times the non-zero elements can form a zero prefix sum. \n\nBut this is not straightforward. \n\nThe correct approach is the greedy one I described earlier. \n\nThe code should be implemented as follows: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, score=0. \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\nif a[i] is zero: \n\n   current_sum =0 \n\n   score +=1 \n\nelse: \n\n   current_sum += a[i] \n\n   if current_sum ==0: \n\n      score +=1 \n\nThis is the correct approach. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the original code's 'TODO' section is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nBut then, the code's current_sum is being updated by adding a[i] (which is zero) after the if block. \n\nSo the code would be: \n\nif(a[i]==0) \n\n{ \n\n    curr_sum =0; \n\n} \n\nthen curr_sum +=a[i]; \n\nBut this would add the a[i] (which is zero) to curr_sum, so the net effect is curr_sum remains zero. \n\nThis is correct. \n\nThen, the map is updated with the new curr_sum. \n\nBut the original code's logic is to track the frequency of the prefix sums. \n\nBut this approach is not the correct one. \n\nThe original code's logic is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct code must be rewritten. \n\nBut the problem requires to complete the given code. \n\nThe given code's structure is using a map to track the frequency of prefix sums. \n\nThe correct approach is different, but perhaps the problem's solution is to use the maximum frequency of the prefix sums plus some adjustment. \n\nWait, let me think again about the first example. \n\nThe first example's optimal score is 3. \n\nThe maximum frequency of any prefix sum in the modified array is 3 (for 0). \n\nThe maximum frequency in the original array is 3 (for 2). \n\nThe maximum frequency in the modified array is the maximum possible. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency is the maximum over all possible choices of the zeros' values of the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. \n\nThe optimal choice is to choose the zeros' values such that the maximum frequency is maximized. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency is the maximum number of times any prefix sum can be achieved. \n\nThe optimal choice is to choose the target sum to be zero, and set the zeros such that as many prefix sums as possible are zero. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency of zero is the number of zeros plus the number of times the non-zero elements can form a zero prefix sum. \n\nBut this is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible frequency of any sum S is the number of times S can be achieved by adjusting the zeros. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency is the maximum over all possible S of the number of times S can be achieved. \n\nThe optimal S is the one that can be achieved the most times. \n\nTo compute this, we can consider the original prefix sums and the positions of the zeros. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency is the maximum number of times any prefix sum can be made to occur by adjusting the zeros. \n\nThe way to compute this is to track the occurrences of each prefix sum and the number of zeros between them. \n\nFor example, for a given prefix sum S occurring at indices i_1, i_2, ..., i_k, the number of times S can be achieved is k plus the number of zeros between the occurrences. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible frequency is the maximum number of times any prefix sum can be achieved by setting the zeros between its occurrences to adjust the sum between them to zero. \n\nThe maximum possible frequency is the maximum over all S of the number of occurrences of S plus the number of zeros between them. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the greedy approach and see what the missing code should be. \n\nThe missing code is inside the 'if(a[i]==0)' block. \n\nThe correct code should set the current_sum to zero. \n\nSo the code inside the 'if' block should be: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nBut then, the code adds a[i] (which is zero) to curr_sum, so the net effect is curr_sum remains zero. \n\nThis is correct. \n\nThe rest of the code's logic is incorrect, but the problem requires to complete the given code. \n\nThe original code's logic is to compute the maximum frequency of any prefix sum. \n\nBut in the first example, the maximum frequency of the modified array's prefix sums is 3 (for zero), which is the correct answer. \n\nThe original code's approach would compute the maximum frequency of the original array's prefix sums. \n\nBut in the first example, the original array's prefix sums have a maximum frequency of 3 (for 2). \n\nThe correct answer is 3, which matches the maximum frequency of the modified array's prefix sums. \n\nThe original code's approach would not work because it uses the original array's prefix sums. \n\nBut the problem allows us to modify the array. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach must consider the modified prefix sums. \n\nThe given code's approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct code must be rewritten. \n\nBut the problem requires to complete the given code. \n\nThe given code's structure is using a map to track the frequency of prefix sums. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the maximum possible score is the maximum frequency of any prefix sum plus the number of zeros between its occurrences. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is the maximum between the maximum frequency of any prefix sum and the count of zeros plus 1. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach of the maximum frequency of the prefix sums. \n\nThe first example's maximum frequency is 3 (for 2 in the original array), but the correct answer is 3. \n\nThe second example's maximum frequency is 1 (for 1), which matches the answer. \n\nThe third example's maximum frequency is 1 (for 0), which matches. \n\nThe example [2,0,-2] has original prefix sums 2,2,0. The maximum frequency is 2 (for 2). But the correct answer is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct approach must be the greedy one. \n\nThe missing code in the 'if' block is to set curr_sum to zero. \n\nSo the code inside the 'if' block is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nBut then, the code adds a[i] (which is zero) to curr_sum, so the net effect is curr_sum remains zero. \n\nThis is correct. \n\nThe rest of the code's logic is incorrect, but the problem requires to complete the given code. \n\nThe given code's logic is to compute the maximum frequency of the prefix sums. \n\nBut with the missing code filled in as curr_sum =0, the code would compute the frequencies of the modified prefix sums. \n\nFor example, in the first example: \n\nThe prefix sums after modification are 2,0,1,0,0. \n\nThe frequencies are 0:3, 1:1, 2:1. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 3, which is correct. \n\nIn the example [2,0,-2], the modified prefix sums are 2,0,-2. \n\nThe frequencies are 2:1, 0:1, -2:1. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 1, which matches the correct answer. \n\nIn the example [0,3,-3,0], the modified prefix sums are 0,0,0,0. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 4, which is correct. \n\nIn the example [0,1,-1,0], the modified prefix sums are 0,0,0,0. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 4, but the correct score is 3. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe modified array would be [0,0,-1,0]. \n\nThe prefix sums are 0,0, -1, 0. \n\nThe frequencies are 0:3, -1:1. \n\nThe maximum frequency is 3, which matches the correct score of 3. \n\nAh, right. \n\nSo the maximum frequency approach works when the code is modified to set the current_sum to zero when a[i] is zero. \n\nThus, the missing code is to set curr_sum to zero inside the 'if' block. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nThis will ensure that whenever a[i] is zero, the current_sum is set to zero before adding the a[i] (which is zero) to it. \n\nThus, the code inside the 'if' block is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nThe rest of the code's logic will then track the frequencies of the modified prefix sums. \n\nThe maximum frequency of any prefix sum will be the maximum possible score. \n\nThis approach works for all the examples. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nSo the code inside the 'if' block is: \n\ncurr_sum =0; \n\nThe rest of the code's logic will compute the maximum frequency of the modified prefix sums, which is the correct answer. \n\nThus, the missing code is simply setting curr_sum to zero when a[i] is zero. \n\nThe flag and other variables in the original code may not be needed, but the problem requires to output only the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is: \n\ncurr_sum =0;"
