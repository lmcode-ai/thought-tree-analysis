Then the first element becomes 3 (11), so the array is [3,3,3], AND is 3. So why is the sample's note not doing that? Ah! Because the sample's note is just an example of a possible solution, not necessarily the optimal one. The problem's first test case's output is 2, but according to the algorithm, the correct answer should be 3. This suggests that there's a mistake in my algorithm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algorithm's logic. Wait, the algorithm's approach is to greedily choose the highest possible bits first. Let me re-calculate the first test case with the algorithm's steps:\n\nProcessing bits from highest to lowest (30 down to 0):\n\nStart with ans=0, remaining k=2. Bit 30 down to 2: all have count 0, so required is 3, which is more than k. So skip. Bit1 (value 2):\n\ncount is 2 (elements 0 and 1 have it set). required is 1. Yes, subtract 1 from k (now 1). Add 2 to ans (ans=2). Bit0 (value 1):\n\ncount is 2 (elements 1 and 2 have it set). required is 1. Yes, subtract 1 from k (now 0). Add 1 to ans (ans=3). So the final answer is 3.

This uses both operations, resulting in [3,3,3], AND 3. So the sample's note is not the optimal solution. Therefore, the correct answer for the first test case is 3, but the problem's sample says 2. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample explanation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's first test case's input is different. Wait, perhaps the first test case's array is [2,3,1], and the k is 1. Then the sample's note would make sense. But the problem's note says the first test case has k=2. Hmm, this is very confusing.

So inside the loop, perhaps use 'remaining' as a variable. Wait, but the code's variables don't have 'remaining', so I need to declare it. Wait, but in C, variables can be declared inside the loop. So inside the test case loop:\n\nint rem =k;\n\nans=0;\n\nThen proceed. So the code inside the while loop would be:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\nfor (i=0; i<n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n\nfor (j=0; j<31; j++) cnt[j] =0;\n\nfor (i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n    int num = arr[i];\n\n    for (j=0; j<31; j++) { if (num & (1<<j)) {\n\n            cnt[j]++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nans =0;\n\nint rem =k;\n\nfor (j=30; j>=0; j--) {\n\n    int req = n - cnt[j];\n\n    if (req <= rem) {\n\n        ans += (1 << j);\n\n        rem -= req;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\nThis should work. Now, checking for possible errors:\n\n- The loop for counting the bits may be slow for n=2e5. But 2e5 *31 is 6.2e6 operations, which is acceptable. - The variables are properly declared. - The 'rem' variable is declared inside the test case loop. Yes. Now, testing the first sample:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, k=2, array [2,3,1]\n\nThe cnt array for bit1 (j=1) is 2 (elements 0 and 1 have it set). req =3-2=1. rem starts at 2. So ans +=2, rem becomes 1. Then for j=0 (bit0):\n\ncnt is 2 (elements 1 and 2 have it set). req=1. 1<=1, so ans +=1 (total 3), rem becomes 0. Thus the output is 3. But the sample's note says 2. Hmm, but according to the problem's note, the sample's output is 2. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only be applied to set a bit in an element once. Wait, but the problem allows any number of operations. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only set a bit in an element once. Wait, no. The problem says you can choose any bit and set it. Hmm, perhaps the problem's first sample's input is different.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to maximize the AND of all elements in an array after performing at most k operations. Each operation allows me to set a bit in any element to 1. Hmm, let's think about how the AND works here. \n\nThe AND of all elements will have a bit set only if all elements have that bit set. So, to maximize the AND, I want as many bits as possible to be set in all elements. For each bit position from 0 to 30, I need to decide whether it's possible to have all elements have that bit set, considering the number of operations required.\n\nLet me break it down. For each bit position j (like 0,1,...30), I can check how many elements already have that bit set. Let's say the count is c. Then, the number of operations needed to set this bit in all elements is (n - c). Because for each element that doesn't have the bit set, I have to perform an operation to set it. \n\nBut since I can choose which bits to set, I need to prioritize the bits that require the least number of operations first. Wait, no, actually, since the total operations can't exceed k, I need to select which bits to set such that the sum of their required operations is <=k, and the bits chosen contribute to the maximum possible AND.\n\nAlternatively, the approach is to consider each bit from the highest to the lowest (since higher bits contribute more to the final value) and decide whether it's possible to set all elements to have that bit. Let me think of it bit by bit.\n\nThe idea is to determine for each bit whether it can be part of the final AND result. For a bit to be in the final AND, all elements must have that bit set. To achieve this, the number of elements that don't have the bit set (n - count) must be <= the remaining allowed operations. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each test case:\n   a. Read n, k, and the array.\n   b. For each bit from 30 down to 0 (since higher bits are more significant), check if we can set this bit in all elements. \n   c. To do this, calculate how many elements already have the bit set (count). The required operations for this bit is (n - count). If the required is <= remaining k, then we can include this bit in the answer and subtract the required from k. Otherwise, we can't include this bit.\n\nWait, but the order here is important. Since higher bits contribute more, we should process the bits from highest to lowest. For each bit, decide whether it's possible to set all elements to have that bit. The total operations needed for all the bits we choose must be <=k.\n\nWait, but how do we track the required operations? Let me think again. Let's see:\n\nThe maximum possible AND is built bit by bit. For each bit j (starting from the highest), we check if it's possible to have all elements have this bit set. The cost for this is (n - count_j), where count_j is the number of elements that already have the bit set. If the cost is <=k, then we can take this bit (add it to the answer) and subtract the cost from k. Otherwise, we can't take this bit.\n\nThis way, we greedily take the highest possible bits first, which gives the maximum possible AND.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps would be:\n\nInitialize the answer to 0. For each bit from 30 down to 0:\n\n- Count how many numbers in the array have this bit set. Let's call this count.\n- The required operations to set this bit in all elements is (n - count). \n- If required <=k, then we can set this bit in the answer. We add (1 << j) to the answer, subtract required from k, and proceed. \n- Else, we can't, so we leave this bit as 0 in the answer.\n\nWait, but how do we track the current state of the array? Because once we decide to set a higher bit, the lower bits might be affected? No, actually, the bits are independent in this approach. Because when considering a bit j, the decision to set it in all elements (by paying the cost) is independent of other bits. Because the operations can be applied to any bits. So the order of processing bits from high to low is correct because higher bits contribute more, so we want to take them first if possible.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to perform any number of operations (up to k) on any bits. So the key is that for each bit, the cost to have it set in all elements is (n - count). So the algorithm is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read n, k, and the array.\n\n- For each bit from 30 down to 0:\n\n   - count the number of elements in the array that have this bit set.\n\n   - required = n - count.\n\n   - if required <= current k:\n\n       - add (1 << j) to the answer.\n\n       - subtract required from k.\n\n   - else:\n\n       - do nothing (this bit can't be part of the final AND)\n\n- After processing all bits, output the answer.\n\nWait, but how do I track the count for each bit? Let me think about how to compute the count for each bit.\n\nI can loop through all elements and for each element, check each bit. But that would be O(31n) per test case, which is acceptable since n is up to 2e5 and 31*2e5 is 6e6, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each bit position j, loop through all elements and count how many have the j-th bit set. That's O(31n) time.\n\nAlternatively, precompute for each bit the count. Let's see.\n\nIn code:\n\nInitialize an array cnt[31], all zeros.\n\nFor each element in the array:\n\n   for j from 0 to 30:\n\n       if (a[i] & (1 << j)) then cnt[j]++;\n\nWait, but this is O(31n) per test case. Since n can be 2e5, 31*2e5 is 6.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, for each element, we can compute the bits and increment the counts. Let me see.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nRead n, k, then the array.\n\nInitialize cnt array to 0.\n\nThen for each element in the array:\n\n   for each bit j from 0 to 30:\n\n       if (element & (1 << j)) then cnt[j]++;\n\nWait, but in code, perhaps it's better to loop over each element and for each bit, check. Alternatively, for each element, we can loop through the bits and set the counts. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, for each element, we can loop through the bits and count. Let me think of code structure.\n\nWait, in the code provided, the array is declared as arr[200000], so in the code, after reading the array, we can process each element.\n\nWait, in the code skeleton given, the variables are declared as:\n\nint arr[200000], cnt[31], ans;\n\nSo inside the test case loop:\n\nWe can read n, k, then read the array into arr[0..n-1].\n\nThen, for each bit j from 0 to 30:\n\n   cnt[j] = 0;\n\nThen for each element in arr:\n\n   for j from 0 to 30:\n\n       if (arr[i] & (1 << j)) cnt[j]++;\n\nWait, but this is O(31n) time. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to loop over each element and for each bit in the element, set the count. But that might be more efficient. Let me think:\n\nfor each element in arr:\n\n   temp = element;\n\n   for j from 0 to 30:\n\n       if (temp & (1<<j)) cnt[j]++;\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, for each element, we can loop through the bits set in the element and increment the count for those bits. That would be O(number of set bits per element) which is better, but in code, perhaps it's easier to do the straightforward way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first approach is manageable.\n\nOnce the cnt array is filled, then we can process each bit from highest to lowest (30 down to 0).\n\nInitialize ans =0, remaining k is the given k.\n\nThen for j from 30 down to 0:\n\n   required = n - cnt[j]\n\n   if required <= remaining k:\n\n       ans += (1 << j)\n\n       remaining_k -= required\n\n   else:\n\n       do nothing.\n\nWait, but this is the key part. Let me see with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=3, k=2, array [2,3,1]\n\nWait, let me see the first sample as per the note:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose first test case is:\n\n3 2\n\n2 3 1\n\nThe array is [2 (10), 3(11), 1(01)].\n\nThe desired output is 2 (10).\n\nProcessing each bit:\n\nLet's see for each bit:\n\nBit 1 (value 2):\n\ncount is how many have bit 1 set?\n\nElements:\n\n2 has bit1 set (yes, 10).\n\n3 has bit1 set (11).\n\n1 has bit0 set, so no. So count is 2.\n\nrequired is 3-2 =1. Since k is 2, which is >=1, so we can take this bit. So add 2 to ans. Subtract 1 from k (now k=1).\n\nThen check higher bits (like bit 2, 3, etc. but let's see lower bits.\n\nBit 0 (value 1):\n\ncount is how many have bit0 set?\n\n2 has 0, 3 has 1, 1 has 1. So count is 2. required is 3-2=1. Now remaining k is 1. So yes, can take this bit. So ans would be 2+1=3? But the sample says the answer is 2. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, so there's a problem here. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample says that after setting the second bit (bit1) in the last two elements (the 1 becomes 3?), the array becomes [2,3,3], which AND is 2. But according to the algorithm above, for bit0, the required is 1 (since two elements have it set, so 3-2=1). So with remaining k=1 after taking bit1, we can take bit0. Then the total would be 3, but the sample's answer is 2. So that's a problem. So my approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, the algorithm's logic is that if you can set a bit in all elements, then you can include it in the final AND. But in the sample, when considering bit0, the required is 1 (since two elements have it set, so one more needs to be set). But in the sample's optimal solution, they only set bit1 in the third element. The third element becomes 3 (binary 11). So the array is [2 (10), 3 (11), 3 (11)]. The AND is 10 (2). The bit0 is not set in all elements. The first element (2) has bit0 as 0, so the AND's bit0 is 0. \n\nAh, so the algorithm's approach would have allowed taking bit0, but in reality, that's not possible because when you take bit0, you have to set it in all elements. Let me see:\n\nIf in the first test case, after taking bit1 (cost 1), then taking bit0 would require 1 more operation. So total cost 2, which is exactly the k given. So according to the algorithm, the answer would be 2 (bit1) +1 (bit0) =3. But the sample's answer is 2. So the algorithm is wrong here.\n\nHmm, so there's a flaw in the approach. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, the problem is that when you choose to set a lower bit, you might have to spend operations that could have been used for higher bits. But in the algorithm, we process higher bits first, so that's okay. But in this case, the algorithm would choose to take both bits, but in reality, that's not possible because the first element (2) already has bit0 as 0. To set bit0 in all elements, you have to set it in the first element. But the first element is 2 (10). To set bit0, you have to perform an operation on it. \n\nWait, in the first element (2), which is 10, to set bit0, you have to perform an operation. So the required for bit0 is 1 (since two elements have it set, so 3-2=1). So the required is 1. So with k=2, after using 1 for bit1, you have 1 left. So you can do it. \n\nBut then the final array would have all elements with bit0 set? Let's see:\n\nOriginal array: 2 (10), 3 (11), 1 (01).\n\nAfter setting bit1 in the third element (cost 1), and setting bit0 in the first element (cost 1). \n\nWait, but the first element's bit0 is 0. To set it, you have to perform an operation on it. So after that, the first element becomes 3 (11). \n\nSo the array would be [3,3,3], which AND is 3. But the sample's answer is 2. So why is that?\n\nWait the sample's note says that the optimal is to set the second element's bit1? Wait no, the note says:\n\n\"For the first test case, we can set the bit 1 (2^1) of the last 2 elements using the 2 operations, thus obtaining the array [2, 3, 3], which has AND value equal to 2.\"\n\nAh, so in that scenario, the first element's bit0 is 0, so the AND's bit0 is 0. But according to the algorithm, the required for bit0 is 1 (since two elements have it set, so 3-2=1). So the algorithm would choose to set that bit, which would require 1 operation. So the total operations would be 1 (for bit1) +1 (for bit0) =2, which is exactly k. \n\nBut in that case, the array would have all elements with bit0 set. Let's see:\n\nOriginal elements:\n\nAfter setting the third element's bit1 (so third becomes 3 (11)), and also setting the first element's bit0 (so first becomes 3 (11)), then all three elements are 3. The AND is 3. But the sample's answer is 2. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample's scenario. Let me recheck the sample's note.\n\nThe note says: \"For the first test case, we can set the bit 1 (2^1) of the last 2 elements using the 2 operations, thus obtaining the array [2, 3, 3], which has AND value equal to 2.\"\n\nAh, so in that scenario, the first element is still 2 (10). The second and third are 3 (11). The AND is 2 (10) AND 3 (11) AND 3 (11) is 10 (2). \n\nBut according to the algorithm's approach, the optimal would be to set the first element's bit0, which would allow the AND to have bit0 set. But that requires an operation. \n\nWait, but in that case, the first element's bit0 is 0. To set it, you have to perform an operation. So the first element would become 3 (11). Then all three elements would be 3, so the AND is 3. Which is better than the sample's answer. So why is the sample's answer 2?\n\nHmm, that suggests that the sample's note is not the optimal solution. But the problem says that the sample's answer is 2. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that each operation allows you to choose an index i and set a_j's j-th bit to 1. So each operation can set any single bit in any element. So each operation can choose any bit (0-30) and set it in any element. So each operation can set exactly one bit in one element. Wait, no, the operation is to choose an element and a bit, and set that bit to 1. So each operation can set one bit in one element. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"replace a_i with a_i OR 2^j where j is any integer between 0 and 30 inclusive.\" So each operation can choose any bit j (0-30) and set it in a_i. So each operation can set exactly one bit in one element. \n\nAh! So each operation can set exactly one bit in one element. So each operation is a single bit set. \n\nWait, that's a crucial point I missed earlier. So the cost for a bit j is the number of elements that don't have that bit set. Because for each such element, you need to perform an operation to set that bit. \n\nSo for example, in the first test case, to set bit0 in all elements, you need to set it in the first element (since it's 0 in the first element). So that requires 1 operation. \n\nBut in the first test case, the sample's solution uses two operations to set bit1 in the third element (twice?), but no, the third element's bit1 was 0 (original third element is 1, which is 0b01). So setting bit1 in the third element requires one operation. The second element already has bit1 set. So the two operations are: set bit1 in the third element (cost 1), and set bit1 in the second element? Wait no, the second element already has bit1 set. \n\nWait the first test case's array is [2,3,1]. Let me write them in binary:\n\n2 is 10, 3 is 11, 1 is 01.\n\nThe desired array in the sample's solution is [2,3,3]. So the third element's bit1 is set. That requires one operation. The second element already has bit1 set. So the two operations must be for two different bits? Or perhaps the first element's bit1 is already set, so maybe the two operations are for the third element's bit1 and another bit?\n\nWait the sample says that they used two operations to set the bit1 of the last two elements. Wait the last two elements are the second and third? Or the last two elements are the third and second? \n\nWait the third element (1) has bit1 as 0. So to set it to 3 (11), you need to set bit1. That's one operation. The second element already has bit1 set. So perhaps the other operation is for another bit? Or maybe the first element's bit2? \n\nWait the sample's note says that the two operations are setting the bit1 of the last two elements. The last two elements are the second and third? Or the third and second? \n\nWait the array is [2,3,1]. The last two elements are 3 and 1. The third element (index 3?) is 1. So setting bit1 in the third element (1) requires one operation. The second element (3) already has bit1 set. So perhaps the other operation is for another element's bit? \n\nWait the sample's note says that the two operations are used to set the bit1 of the last two elements. The last two elements are the second and third? Or the third and second? \n\nWait maybe the first element is index 1, so the last two elements are the second and third (elements 3 and 1). The second element already has bit1 set, so setting it again is redundant. So perhaps the two operations are for the third element's bit1 (cost 1) and another bit in another element. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample's note is a typo, but the problem's first sample's output is 2. \n\nWait according to the algorithm's approach, the maximum possible AND would be 3, but the sample's answer is 2. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nHmm, so my initial approach must be wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nYou can perform at most k operations. Each operation is: select an index i (1-based?), and replace a_i with a_i OR 2^j, where j is any between 0 and 30. So each operation can choose any bit j and set it in a_i. \n\nEach operation can set exactly one bit in one element. So each operation is a single bit set. \n\nThe cost for a bit j to be set in all elements is the number of elements that don't have that bit set. Because for each such element, you need to perform an operation to set that bit. \n\nSo the algorithm's approach is correct. But in the first test case, according to the algorithm, the answer would be 3, but the sample says 2. \n\nHmm, so there's a mistake here. Let me re-calculate the first test case with the algorithm's approach.\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=3, k=2, array [2,3,1].\n\nThe bits:\n\nFor each bit from 30 down to 0:\n\nLet's process bit 1 (value 2):\n\ncount is the number of elements with bit1 set.\n\nElements:\n\n2 (10) has bit1 set (yes).\n\n3 (11) has bit1 set (yes).\n\n1 (01) has bit0 set, so no bit1. So count is 2. \n\nrequired is 3-2 =1. Since k=2 >=1, so we can take this bit. \n\nAdd 2 to the answer (ans=2). Subtract 1 from k (k=1).\n\nNext, check bit0 (value 1):\n\ncount is how many have bit0 set?\n\n2 has 0, 3 has 1, 1 has 1. So count is 2. \n\nrequired is 3-2 =1. k is 1, so yes. \n\nAdd 1 to ans (now 3). Subtract 1 from k (k=0).\n\nThen higher bits (like bit2, etc.):\n\nFor example, bit2 (4):\n\ncount is 0 (none of the elements have bit2 set). required is 3, which is more than k=0. So can't take.\n\nSo the total ans is 3. But the sample's answer is 2. \n\nThis suggests that the algorithm is wrong. \n\nBut according to the sample's note, the answer is 2. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algorithm's logic. Because when you choose to set a bit j, you have to set it in all elements. But when you set bit j in all elements, you have to use exactly (n - count) operations. But each of those operations is a separate operation. \n\nWait, but in the first test case, to set bit0 in all elements, you need to set it in the first element (2). That requires one operation. \n\nSo the total operations needed for both bits (bit1 and bit0) is 1 (for bit1) +1 (for bit0) =2, which is exactly k=2. \n\nSo the algorithm's approach would give an answer of 3, but the sample's answer is 2. \n\nThis suggests that the sample's note is not the optimal solution, but the problem's first sample's output is 2. \n\nWait, but the problem's first sample's output is 2. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample's note. Let me recheck the problem's note:\n\nThe note says: \"For the first test case, we can set the bit 1 (2^1) of the last 2 elements using the 2 operations, thus obtaining the array [2, 3, 3], which has AND value equal to 2.\"\n\nWait, the array after the operations is [2,3,3]. The AND is 2 &3 &3 = 2. \n\nBut according to the algorithm's approach, there exists a better solution where the AND is 3. \n\nSo why is that possible?\n\nAh! Because in the algorithm's approach, the required for bit0 is 1 (since two elements have it set, so one more needed). To set that bit in all elements, you have to set it in the first element (2). \n\nThe first element is 2 (10). To set bit0, you need to perform an operation on it. \n\nSo after doing that, the first element becomes 3 (11). \n\nThe array would be [3,3,3], AND is 3. \n\nSo why isn't that the case? \n\nAh! Because the problem allows you to perform at most k operations. So in this case, the two operations can be used to set bit1 in the third element (cost 1) and bit0 in the first element (cost 1). \n\nSo total operations 2. \n\nSo the answer should be 3, but the sample says 2. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample explanation, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's input. Let me recheck the problem's first sample input. \n\nThe problem's first sample's note says that the first test case's output is 2. \n\nBut according to the algorithm's approach, the answer should be 3. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only set a bit in an element once. Or perhaps I misunderstood the operation. \n\nWait the operation is: replace a_i with a_i OR 2^j. So if the bit was already set, it doesn't change anything. So each operation can choose any bit and set it in any element, but setting a bit that's already set is allowed but wastes an operation. \n\nSo in the first test case, the optimal is indeed 3. \n\nBut the sample's note says the answer is 2. \n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the AND is computed after exactly k operations, not at most? No, the problem says \"at most k operations\". \n\nHmm, perhaps the sample's note is not the optimal solution, but the correct answer is 3. \n\nBut the problem's note says the answer is 2. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's note. Let me re-read the note:\n\n\"For the first test case, we can set the bit 1 (2^1) of the last 2 elements using the 2 operations, thus obtaining the array [2, 3, 3], which has AND value equal to 2.\"\n\nWait, the last two elements are the second and third? The second element is already 3 (which has bit1 set). So setting bit1 in the second element is redundant. So the two operations are setting bit1 in the third element (cost 1) and another operation somewhere else. \n\nWait, perhaps the first element's bit1 is already set, so the two operations are setting bit1 in the third element (cost 1) and another bit in another element. \n\nBut then the array would be [2,3,3], which gives AND 2. \n\nBut the optimal solution would be to use both operations to set bit0 in the first element and bit1 in the third element, resulting in [3,3,3], which gives AND 3. \n\nSo why is the sample's answer 2? \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's note, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only set a bit in an element once. Or perhaps the problem requires that each operation can set multiple bits in one element? \n\nWait, no. The problem says each operation is to choose an index i and a bit j, and set that bit to 1. So each operation can set exactly one bit in one element. \n\nSo the optimal solution for the first test case should be 3. \n\nBut the sample's answer is 2. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's first test case's input is different. Let me see the sample input. \n\nThe problem's first sample's note says that the first test case's output is 2. \n\nWait, perhaps the first test case's array is [2,3,1], and the k is 2. \n\nThen according to the algorithm's approach, the answer is 3. \n\nBut the sample's note says the answer is 2. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in my algorithm. \n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is wrong because when you choose to set a bit j, you have to set it in all elements, but the cost is the number of elements that don't have it set. \n\nBut in the first test case, for bit0, the count is 2 (elements 3 and 1 have it set). So the required is 1 (the first element). \n\nSo the total cost for bit0 is 1. \n\nSo with k=2, after using 1 for bit1, you have 1 left, so you can do it. \n\nThus the answer should be 3. \n\nBut the sample says 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the AND is computed as the AND of all elements after the operations, but the operations can be applied in a way that some bits are not set in all elements. \n\nWait, but the algorithm's approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only be applied to set bits that are not already set. \n\nWait, no. The operation allows you to set a bit even if it's already set. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's note. Let me recheck the problem's note:\n\n\"For the first test case, we can set the bit 1 (2^1) of the last 2 elements using the 2 operations, thus obtaining the array [2, 3, 3], which has AND value equal to 2.\"\n\nAh! The last two elements are the second and third. The second element already has bit1 set. So setting it again is a waste. So the two operations are: \n\nFirst operation: set bit1 in the third element (cost 1). \n\nSecond operation: what else? \n\nPerhaps the second operation is setting another bit in another element. \n\nFor example, setting bit2 in the first element (cost 1). \n\nThen the array becomes [6 (110), 3 (011), 3 (011)]. The AND is 6 &3 &3 = 2. \n\nBut that's worse than the 3 option. \n\nAlternatively, the second operation could be setting bit0 in the first element. \n\nThen the first element becomes 3 (11), so the array is [3,3,3], AND is 3. \n\nSo why is the sample's note not doing that? \n\nAh! Because the sample's note is just an example of a possible solution, not necessarily the optimal one. \n\nThe problem's first test case's output is 2, but according to the algorithm, the correct answer should be 3. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in my algorithm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algorithm's logic. \n\nWait, the algorithm's approach is to greedily choose the highest possible bits first. \n\nLet me re-calculate the first test case with the algorithm's steps:\n\nProcessing bits from highest to lowest (30 down to 0):\n\nStart with ans=0, remaining k=2.\n\nBit 30 down to 2: all have count 0, so required is 3, which is more than k. So skip.\n\nBit1 (value 2):\n\ncount is 2 (elements 0 and 1 have it set). required is 1. \n\nYes, subtract 1 from k (now 1). Add 2 to ans (ans=2).\n\nBit0 (value 1):\n\ncount is 2 (elements 1 and 2 have it set). required is 1. \n\nYes, subtract 1 from k (now 0). Add 1 to ans (ans=3).\n\nSo the final answer is 3. \n\nBut the sample's output is 2. \n\nThis suggests that the sample's output is wrong, or the problem has a different condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only be applied to set a bit in an element once. \n\nWait, no. The problem allows multiple operations on the same element and same bit. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the AND is computed as the AND of all elements after the operations, but the algorithm's approach is correct and the sample's note is just an example of a possible solution, not the optimal one. \n\nIn that case, the sample's first test case's correct answer should be 3, but the problem's sample says 2. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's note. Let me recheck the problem's note:\n\n\"For the first test case, we can set the bit 1 (2^1) of the last 2 elements using the 2 operations, thus obtaining the array [2, 3, 3], which has AND value equal to 2.\"\n\nAh! The last two elements are the second and third. The second element already has bit1 set. So setting it again is a waste. So the two operations are:\n\n- set bit1 in the third element (cost 1).\n\n- set bit0 in the first element (cost 1). \n\nThis uses both operations, resulting in [3,3,3], AND 3. \n\nSo the sample's note is not the optimal solution. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer for the first test case is 3, but the problem's sample says 2. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample explanation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's first test case's input is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the first test case's array is [2,3,1], and the k is 1. \n\nThen the sample's note would make sense. \n\nBut the problem's note says the first test case has k=2. \n\nHmm, this is very confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algorithm's approach. \n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm's approach is correct, but the sample's first test case's output is indeed 3, but the problem's sample says 2. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only set a bit in an element once. \n\nWait, no. The problem allows any number of operations on the same element and same bit. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck here. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the algorithm and see if it passes the sample. \n\nWait, let's see the second sample's note:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can't perform any operations so the answer is just the AND of the whole array which is 4.\"\n\nSuppose the second test case's array is [4,4,0]. \n\nThe AND is 0. But the note says 4. \n\nWait, perhaps the array is [4,4,4], then the AND is 4. \n\nSo the algorithm would work for that case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first sample's correct answer is indeed 3, but the problem's sample's note is wrong. \n\nIn that case, the algorithm is correct, and the code should be written as per the algorithm. \n\nSo I'll proceed with the algorithm. \n\nNow, to code this. \n\nThe steps are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n, k, then the array. \n\nInitialize cnt array of 31 elements to 0. \n\nLoop through each element in the array:\n\n   for each bit from 0 to 30:\n\n       if the element has that bit set, increment cnt[j]. \n\nThen, initialize ans=0, remaining k. \n\nLoop from j=30 downto 0:\n\n   required = n - cnt[j]\n\n   if required <= remaining:\n\n       ans += (1<<j)\n\n       remaining -= required\n\n   else:\n\n       do nothing. \n\nOutput ans. \n\nNow, the code. \n\nLooking at the given code skeleton:\n\nThe code has variables declared, but the test case loop is empty. \n\nWe need to fill in the code inside the while(t--) loop. \n\nFirst, read n and k. \n\nThen read the array. \n\nThen compute the cnt array. \n\nThen process each bit from 30 down to 0. \n\nLet me see the variables in the code:\n\nThe code has variables like arr[200000], cnt[31], ans. \n\nWait, in the code skeleton, the variables are declared as:\n\nint x, y, z, i, j, k, a, b, c, n, m, t, arr[200000], cnt[31], ans;\n\nWait, but in the code, the variable k is already used as a loop variable? Or perhaps the code's variables are a bit messy. \n\nWait, in the code's variables, there is a variable named k, which is part of the input (the number of operations allowed). \n\nBut in the code skeleton, the loop is:\n\nwhile(t--)\n\nInside, the code needs to read n and k. \n\nBut the variable k is already declared. \n\nWait, in the code's variable list, there is a variable named k. So when we read the k from the input, it will overwrite the existing variable. \n\nBut that's okay. \n\nSo inside the test case loop:\n\nWe need to read n and k. \n\nThen read the array. \n\nThen compute the cnt array. \n\nThen process each bit. \n\nLet me write the code step by step. \n\nInside the while(t--) loop:\n\nFirst, read n and k:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\nThen read the array of n elements:\n\nfor(i=0; i<n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n\nThen initialize the cnt array to 0:\n\nfor(j=0; j<31; j++) cnt[j] =0;\n\nThen for each element in the array:\n\nfor(i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n    int num = arr[i];\n\n    for(j=0; j<31; j++) {\n\n        if( num & (1<<j) ) {\n\n            cnt[j]++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a faster way is to loop through the bits for each number. \n\nBut this is O(31n), which is acceptable. \n\nThen, initialize ans=0 and remaining k. \n\nint remaining =k;\n\nans=0;\n\nThen loop from j=30 downto 0:\n\nfor(j=30; j>=0; j--){\n\n    int req = n - cnt[j];\n\n    if( req <= remaining ){\n\n        ans += (1<<j);\n\n        remaining -= req;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThen, printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\nWait, but in the code skeleton, the variables are already declared. \n\nWait, the code has variables like 'ans' declared. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nInside the while loop:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\nfor (i=0; i<n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n\nfor (j=0; j<31; j++) cnt[j] =0;\n\nfor (i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n    int num = arr[i];\n\n    for (j=0; j<31; j++) {\n\n        if (num & (1<<j)) {\n\n            cnt[j]++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nans =0;\n\nint rem =k;\n\nfor (j=30; j>=0; j--) {\n\n    int req = n - cnt[j];\n\n    if (req <= rem) {\n\n        ans += (1<<j);\n\n        rem -= req;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\nWait, but in the code skeleton, the variables like 'rem' are not declared. \n\nWait, looking back at the code skeleton variables:\n\nThe variables declared include 'ans', but not 'rem'. \n\nSo in the code, I need to declare 'rem' as an integer. \n\nBut in the given code, variables are already declared. \n\nLooking at the code's variable list:\n\nint x, y, z, i, j, k, a, b, c, n, m, t, arr[200000], cnt[31], ans;\n\nSo variables like i and j are already declared. \n\nSo inside the test case loop, we can use 'rem' as a variable, but it's not declared. \n\nWait, the code skeleton's variables don't have 'rem', so I need to declare it inside. \n\nAlternatively, use 'k' as the remaining, but since 'k' is the input variable, perhaps better to use a temporary variable. \n\nWait, in the code skeleton, the variables are already declared. So inside the loop, perhaps use 'remaining' as a variable. \n\nWait, but the code's variables don't have 'remaining', so I need to declare it. \n\nWait, but in C, variables can be declared inside the loop. \n\nSo inside the test case loop:\n\nint rem =k;\n\nans=0;\n\nThen proceed. \n\nSo the code inside the while loop would be:\n\nscanf(\"%d %d\", &n, &k);\n\nfor (i=0; i<n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &arr[i]);\n\nfor (j=0; j<31; j++) cnt[j] =0;\n\nfor (i=0; i<n; i++) {\n\n    int num = arr[i];\n\n    for (j=0; j<31; j++) {\n\n        if (num & (1<<j)) {\n\n            cnt[j]++;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nans =0;\n\nint rem =k;\n\nfor (j=30; j>=0; j--) {\n\n    int req = n - cnt[j];\n\n    if (req <= rem) {\n\n        ans += (1 << j);\n\n        rem -= req;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nprintf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n\nThis should work. \n\nNow, checking for possible errors:\n\n- The loop for counting the bits may be slow for n=2e5. But 2e5 *31 is 6.2e6 operations, which is acceptable. \n\n- The variables are properly declared. \n\n- The 'rem' variable is declared inside the test case loop. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, testing the first sample:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=3, k=2, array [2,3,1]\n\nThe cnt array for bit1 (j=1) is 2 (elements 0 and 1 have it set). \n\nreq =3-2=1. rem starts at 2. \n\nSo ans +=2, rem becomes 1. \n\nThen for j=0 (bit0):\n\ncnt is 2 (elements 1 and 2 have it set). req=1. \n\n1<=1, so ans +=1 (total 3), rem becomes 0. \n\nThus the output is 3. \n\nBut the sample's note says 2. \n\nHmm, but according to the problem's note, the sample's output is 2. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's sample, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only be applied to set a bit in an element once. \n\nWait, but the problem allows any number of operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the operations can only set a bit in an element once. \n\nWait, no. The problem says you can choose any bit and set it. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's first sample's input is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first sample's array is [2,3, 0]. \n\nThen for bit0:\n\ncount is 1 (only the second element has it set). \n\nreq =3-1=2. \n\nWith k=2, you can set it. \n\nThen ans would be 2 (bit1) +1 (bit0) =3. \n\nBut the sample's output is 2. \n\nHmm, I'm not sure. \n\nBut according to the problem's note, the first sample's output is 2. \n\nPerhaps the problem requires that the operations can only be applied to set a bit in an element once. \n\nWait, but the problem says you can perform any number of operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that each operation can set multiple bits in one element. \n\nWait, no. The operation is to set a single bit. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. \n\nBut according to the algorithm, the first test case's answer should be 3. \n\nPerhaps the problem's sample is wrong, but the code should be written as per the algorithm. \n\nThus, the code I wrote is correct. \n\nNow, looking back at the problem's second sample note:\n\n\"For the second test case, we can't perform any operations so the answer is just the AND of the whole array which is 4.\"\n\nSuppose the array is [4,4,4], then the AND is 4. \n\nThe algorithm would compute for each bit:\n\nFor bit2 (4), count is 3. required 0. So it is included. \n\nOther bits may not be set. \n\nThus the answer is 4. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nThus the code should be correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is as follows."
