Wait, but in the second sample, when processing node 3:\n\ndelta is 7-0=7. ans +=1. Then, the parent (node 2) gets b[2] = min(3, 0+7) \u2192 3. Then, processing node 2: b[2] is 3, which is exactly l[2], so no delta. Then, node 1's b is 3 (from node 2's contribution). Since l[1] is 3, no delta. Thus, the total ans is 1, but the correct answer is 2. So this approach is wrong. Hmm, so what's wrong here?",

Wait, the path for v=3 is 1,2,3. The c array must be non-decreasing. The first operation's c array for v=2 is [3,3]. The second operation's c array for v=3 is [2,5,7]. The total contributions are:\n\nnode1: 3+2 =5 \n\nnode2:3+5=8? Wait no, the second operation's c array for node2 is 5, so node2's total is 3 (from first op) +5 (second) =8?

Hmm, maybe the sample's note has a mistake. Let me recheck the problem's note: In the second test case, the first operation is v=2 with c = [3,3], resulting in a1=3, a2=3, a3=0. Then the second operation is v=3 with c = [2,7]. Wait, the path for v=3 is 1,2,3. So the c array must have length 3. The note's c array is length 2, which is incorrect. Perhaps the correct c array for the second operation is [2, 5, 7], so that it's non-decreasing. Then, the second operation adds 2 to a1 (total 5), 5 to a2 (total 8?), but node2's r is 3. So that's impossible. Hmm, this suggests that the sample's note might have a mistake, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, the problem says that each a_v must be between l_v and r_v. In the second test case's note, after the first operation, a2 is 3 (which is within its l and r of 3). The second operation's c array for v=3 must be non-decreasing. Let's say the c array is [2, 0, 5]. No, that's not non-decreasing. Alternatively, the second operation's c array is [2, 2, 5]. Then, a1 becomes 3+2=5 (within its r of 3? No, that's over. Wait, the first test case's root has r=1. In the first sample's solution, the root's a is 1, which is within its r. In the second test case's first operation, the root's a is 3, which is exactly its r (3).",

Wait, let's see the first sample:\n\nNode2:\n\ndelta =2-0=2. \n\nans +=2. a2 becomes 2. a1 becomes 0+2=2. Node1:\n\ndelta =1-2=0. No addition. Total ans is 2, but the correct answer is 1. Thus, this approach is wrong. Hmm.",

Thus, for each node v:\n\ndelta_v = max(0, l_v - a_v). The required contribution from the parent's path must be at least delta_v. Thus, the number of operations needed for v is max(0, delta_v - a_p). The total ans is the sum of these values. The a_v is then set to a_v + delta_v. The a_p is set to a_p + delta_v. Wait, let's try the first sample:\n\nNode2:\n\ndelta_v =2-0=2. \n\na_p (node1's a) is 0. \n\noperations += max(0, 2-0) =2. a2 becomes 2. a1 becomes 0+2=2. \n\nNode1:\n\ndelta_v =1-2=0. No addition. Total ans is 2. No good. Hmm. Perhaps I should look for a different approach inspired by the code's structure.",

Thus, the algorithm is:\n\nProcess nodes in post-order. For each node v:\n\ndelta_v = max(0, l_v - b[v]). The required delta for v must be at least the delta of its parent. Thus, the number of operations contributed by v is max(0, delta_v - delta_p). The total ans is the sum of these values. The delta_p is the delta of the parent. The b array is updated as follows: \n\nb[v] = l_v. b[p] = min(r_p, b[p] + delta_v). Wait, let's try this with the second sample:\n\nnode3:\n\ndelta_v =7-0=7. parent is node2. delta_p is the delta of node2, which is not yet computed. Wait, processing in post-order, node2 is processed after node3. Thus, when processing node3, the parent's delta is not yet computed. This approach may not work. Alternatively, the delta_p is the current b of the parent before processing the child. Let me try this:\n\nInitialize all b to 0. Process node3 first:\n\ndelta_v =7-0=7. \n\nparent is node2. delta_p is b[node2] =0. \n\noperations += max(0,7-0)=7. Then, set b[node3] =7. \n\nb[node2] = min(3,0+7)=3. Next, process node2:\n\ndelta_v =3-0=3. parent is node1. delta_p is b[node1] =0. \n\noperations +=3-0=3. b[node2] =3. b[node1] = min(3,0+3)=3. Process node1:\n\ndelta_v =3-0=3. parent is none. \n\noperations +=3. Total ans is7+3+3=13. No, this is not correct. Hmm.",

Thus, the code's missing part is:\n\ndelta = max(0, l[i] - b[i]);\n\nans += delta;\n\nb[i] += delta; Then, the parent's b is updated to min(r[a[i]], b[a[i]] + delta). But in the second sample:\n\nnode3's delta is7. \n\nans +=7. \n\nparent's b is min(3,0+7)=3. node2's delta is3-0=3. \n\nans +=3. parent's b is min(3,0+3)=3. node1's delta is3-0=3. \n\nans +=3. Total is 13. This is not correct. Hmm.",

For example, in the second sample:\n\nnode3's delta is7. The parent (node2) has r=3. The current b of node2 is0. The maximum we can contribute to node2 is3 (its r). Thus, the delta for node3 can be split into two operations: First operation contributes 3 to node2 and 3 to node3 (but this would make node2's b=3, node3's b=3. Then, the remaining delta for node3 is4. The second operation contributes 0 to node2 (since it can't exceed r=3) and 4 to node3. Thus, two operations.

The algorithm would be: For each node v in post-order:\n\ndelta = max(0, l_v - b[v]). The available capacity of the parent is (r_p - b_p). The number of operations needed for this delta is the number of times the delta exceeds the available capacity. Wait, perhaps the number of operations is the number of times the delta exceeds the parent's available capacity. The available capacity is the maximum amount that can be added to the parent without exceeding its r. Thus, the number of operations needed is ceil(delta / (available capacity +1)). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the number of operations needed is the number of times the delta exceeds the parent's current b. This is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps I should look for a different approach inspired by the problem's constraints. The key is that each operation's c array is non-decreasing. Thus, the contribution to the parent must be <= the contribution to the child.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a rooted tree where each node has a number a_v that must be between l_v and r_v. The operations allowed are choosing a vertex v, then selecting a non-decreasing array c of non-negative integers along the path from root (1) to v. Each step in the operation adds c_i to the nodes along that path. The goal is to find the minimum number of such operations needed so that all a_v meet their constraints.\n\nHmm, the code provided has some variables and a structure. Let me look at the code's structure to see where the missing part is. The code loops through test cases, reads the tree structure (parents for nodes 2 to n), then reads l and r for each node. Then there's a loop from n down to 1. In that loop, if b[i] is less than l[i], there's a TODO. Then, it updates b[a[i]] by adding b[i], but capped at r[a[i]].\n\nWait, I think the variables here might be part of a greedy approach. Let me think about the approach required here.\n\nThe key idea here is probably to model the required increments in a way that each operation contributes to the path from root to v. Since each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the way to model this is to track the required increments in a way that can be covered by such operations.\n\nI remember that in some similar problems, like the one where you have to cover required values with non-decreasing sequences, a greedy approach from the leaves upwards might work. Let me think:\n\nEach node's required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The operations can add to the path from root to v. The non-decreasing condition on c implies that when you choose a path, the increments along the path must be non-decreasing. So, for each node, the required \"deficit\" (the amount we need to add) must be covered by these operations.\n\nPerhaps the approach is to process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root), and track the required increments. Let me think step by step.\n\nSuppose we process each node starting from the bottom (children first). For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. However, the a_v is the sum of all c_i's along all paths that include v. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the increments along the path must be such that each step is at least the previous.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be transformed into a problem where each node's required value is determined by the path, and we can model the required increments as a series of steps.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times we have to \"jump\" in the required increments along the path from the root to each node.\n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of all c_k's along all paths that include v. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the total contribution to a node's value is the sum of all c's from the operations that include it in their path. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the required increments for each node and ensuring that the increments along the path are non-decreasing. Let me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables, but with constraints.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample, the solution uses one operation on v=2 with c = [1,2]. The a1 is 1, a2 is 2. The l and r for each node must be satisfied. So, the idea is that each operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. \n\nThe key insight might be that each operation corresponds to adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. To minimize the number of operations, we need to cover the required increments in such a way that each operation's contribution is as \"large\" as possible.\n\nAnother thought: the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of times the required increment for a node exceeds the sum of previous contributions, considering the constraints from the children.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering each node's required value and the constraints from its children. Let me think recursively.\n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order (children first). For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The a_v is the sum of all c's from the paths that include v. \n\nBut how do we model the minimal operations?\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the code's structure. The code has variables a and b. Wait, in the code, the a array is initialized with a[1] =0, and for i from 2 to n, it reads a[i] as the parent. Wait, that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the code, after reading n, it does:\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n\nWait, but the input for the parents is p_2, p_3,...p_n. So the parent of node i (for i from 2 to n) is p_i. So the code is storing a[i] as the parent of i. But in the code, a[1] is set to 0. That might be a problem. Wait, perhaps the code's a array is actually storing the parent pointers. So a[i] is the parent of i. But in the code, a[1] is set to 0, but the parent of 1 is none. So that's okay. \n\nWait, but in the code's loop for the parents, the code is:\n\nfor (int i=2; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n\nWait, but the input for the parents is p_2, p_3,...p_n. So the parent of 2 is p_2, which is stored in a[2]. So that's correct. \n\nNow, the code then reads l and r for each node. Then, there's a loop from i =n downto 1. \n\nInside that loop, for each i, if b[i] < l[i], then we have to do something. Then, after that, it updates b[a[i]] to be the minimum of r[a[i]] and (b[a[i]] + b[i]). \n\nHmm, perhaps the variables here are being used to track some required increments. Let me think of the variables:\n\nThe b array might represent the required \"deficit\" that needs to be covered by the operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the approach is similar to the greedy algorithm for the problem where you have to cover a certain value with non-decreasing steps. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of each node's required a_v. Let me denote the required a_v as some value between l_v and r_v. The minimal number of operations is determined by how much we need to \"add\" to each node, considering the constraints of the non-decreasing c arrays.\n\nSuppose we process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. However, the a_v is the sum of all the c's from the paths that include v. \n\nThe key idea is that each operation's c array must be non-decreasing. So, for a path from root to v, the c's along the path must be non-decreasing. \n\nThis suggests that the minimal number of operations is determined by the \"steps\" needed in the required increments along the path from the root to each node. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's sample and the code's structure:\n\nThe code's loop is going from n down to 1. For each node i, if the current b[i] (which might represent the deficit) is less than l[i], then we need to add some amount. The way to do this is to compute how much more we need to add here, and then distribute this in a way that requires the minimal operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the b array here represents the required \"additional\" value that must be contributed by the operations. Let me think of the variables:\n\nInitially, all a_v are 0. We need to reach a_v between l_v and r_v. \n\nEach operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. The total contribution to a node v is the sum of all the c_i's from all operations that include v in their path. \n\nThe problem is to find the minimal number of such operations. \n\nAn alternative way to model this is to think of each operation as adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. The minimal number of operations is the minimal number of such sequences needed to cover the required a_v's. \n\nThis feels similar to the problem where you have to cover a set of points with lines with certain constraints, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the code's structure. Let me look at the code again:\n\nThe code has a loop from i =n downto 1. For each i, if b[i] < l[i], then we need to do something. Then, after that, it adds b[i] to the parent's b, but capped at r[a[i]]. \n\nWait, perhaps the b array here represents the \"deficit\" that must be covered by the parent. Let me think step by step.\n\nSuppose we process nodes in reverse order (children first). For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The current value of a_v is the sum of all previous operations. But how is this tracked?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the b array is tracking the required \"additional\" value that must be contributed by the parent nodes. \n\nWait, let me think of the variables:\n\nInitially, all b[i] are 0. \n\nProcessing from the bottom up (children first), for each node v:\n\nThe required a_v must be at least l_v. The current contribution from the children's operations (or previous steps) is stored in b[v]. \n\nWait, perhaps the b[v] represents the amount that needs to be added to v's a_v through operations that pass through its ancestors. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the code's structure:\n\nThe code's loop is going from the bottom up. For each node v (starting from the leaves), we check if the current b[v] (the required deficit) is less than l_v. If so, we need to add some amount. The minimal way to do this is to compute the deficit (l_v - b[v]), and then this deficit must be covered by an operation that includes v's path. \n\nBut how does this translate into the number of operations?\n\nWait, perhaps the deficit (l_v - b[v]) must be covered by some operations. However, since each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the way to cover this deficit is to add a certain amount at this node, but this affects the parent's required deficit. \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times we have to \"add\" a certain amount here, but considering the constraints from the children. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach might be similar to the greedy algorithm for the problem where you have to cover a certain value with non-decreasing steps. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of each node's required value. Let me denote the required a_v as exactly l_v (since we can choose a_v up to r_v, but to minimize the number of operations, we can set a_v to the minimal possible, which is l_v, unless constrained by the parent's r_v). \n\nWait, but the a_v can be up to r_v. So perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the required l_v's, but we have to ensure that the parent's a_v doesn't exceed their r_v. \n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is to compute for each node v the required \"delta\" that must be added, and then the number of operations is the sum of the number of times we have to \"step up\" along the path. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the code's structure:\n\nThe code's variables:\n\n- The b array might represent the \"required\" amount that must be contributed by the parent nodes. \n\nProcessing from the bottom up (children first), for each node v:\n\nThe current b[v] is the amount that needs to be added to v's a_v through operations that pass through its ancestors. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the required a_v must be at least l_v. The current contribution from the children's operations (or previous steps) is stored in b[v]. \n\nWait, let me think of the variables again. \n\nSuppose that for each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The current value of a_v is the sum of all the c_i's from the operations. \n\nBut how do we track this? \n\nAlternatively, the code's b array might represent the deficit that must be covered by the parent. \n\nWait, here's a possible way to model it:\n\nEach node v has a required minimum l_v. The current \"contribution\" from the operations that have been considered so far (those that are below v in the tree) is stored in b[v]. \n\nWait, perhaps the b array is the amount that needs to be added to the path from the root to v. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible step-by-step approach:\n\nWe process nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). For each node v:\n\nThe required a_v must be at least l_v. The current contribution from the operations that are already accounted for (those that are in the subtree of v's children) is stored in b[v]. \n\nIf the current b[v] is less than l_v, then we need to add some amount. The minimal way to do this is to add (l_v - b[v]) to the path from the root to v. However, since each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, this addition must be done in a way that doesn't violate the constraints of the parent nodes. \n\nWait, but how does this translate into the number of operations?\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to track the required deficit and distribute it upwards. Let me think of the code's loop:\n\nThe loop is from n downto 1. For each node i:\n\nIf b[i] < l[i], then we need to make up the difference. The required deficit is (l[i] - b[i]). To cover this, we can add this deficit to the path from the root to i. However, since each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, this can be done in one operation, but perhaps the parent's constraints must be considered. \n\nWait, but how does this affect the parent's required value?\n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is to compute the required deficit for node i, then add that to the parent's required value, but ensuring that it doesn't exceed the parent's r value. \n\nWait, the code has:\n\nb[a[i]] = min(r[a[i]], b[a[i]] + b[i]);\n\nWait, but in the code, after processing node i, it adds b[i] to the parent's b. But if the current b[i] is less than l[i], then perhaps we need to first adjust b[i] to be at least l[i], and then add that to the parent's b. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's missing part is to compute the required delta (l[i] - b[i]), add that to the current b[i], and then add this delta to the parent's b, but also increment the answer by 1 for each such delta. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose that for node v, the current b[v] is the amount that has been contributed to it by previous operations (those that are in the subtree below it). \n\nIf b[v] is less than l[v], then we need to add (l[v] - b[v]) to v's a_v. But since this must be done via operations that include v's path, the minimal way is to do this in one operation. However, this addition must be done in a way that the c array is non-decreasing. \n\nWait, but how does this affect the parent nodes? \n\nAlternatively, the required delta (l[v] - b[v]) must be added to the path from the root to v. To do this in one operation, we can set c_k (the last element of the path) to be the delta, and the previous elements must be <= c_k. But since the path is from root to v, the parent's contribution would be increased by this delta. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the number of times we have to \"add\" a delta here, but each such delta corresponds to an operation. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's missing part is:\n\ndelta = max(0, l[i] - b[i]);\n\nans += delta;\n\nb[i] += delta;\n\nBut then, when we add this delta to b[i], we also have to propagate it upwards. \n\nWait, but the code's current structure has:\n\nif (b[i] < l[i]) {\n\n    // compute delta and add to ans?\n\n}\n\nthen, after that, it does:\n\nb[a[i]] = min(r[a[i]], b[a[i]] + b[i]);\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the required deficit and the answer is the sum of all the deltas needed. \n\nWait, let me think of the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\nIn this case, the root is 1, and node 2's parent is 1. The l and r for node 1 are 1 and 1, and for node 2, 2 and 2. \n\nProcessing from node 2 first (since n=2, the loop starts at 2):\n\nAt node 2:\n\nb[2] is initially 0. Since 0 < 2 (l[2] is 2), so delta is 2. \n\nWe need to add this delta to the path from root to 2. This would require one operation. So ans +=1. \n\nThen, we set b[2] += delta (so becomes 2). \n\nThen, we add this delta (2) to the parent (1's b). But the parent's r is 1. So the parent's b was 0, adding 2 would make it 2, but since r[1] is 1, we cap it at 1. \n\nThen, moving to node 1:\n\nb[1] is 1 (from the previous step). Since l[1] is 1, so no delta needed. \n\nThus, the total ans is 1, which matches the sample. \n\nSo the code's missing part is to compute the delta (max(0, l[i] - b[i])), add that to the answer, and then add this delta to b[i]. \n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, after the if statement, we need to compute the delta and add it to ans, and then set b[i] to l[i], or add delta to b[i]. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInside the if (b[i] < l[i]) block:\n\ndelta = l[i] - b[i]\n\nans += delta / something? Or just ans += 1? \n\nWait, in the first sample, the delta is 2, but the answer is 1. So that suggests that the delta is added as a single operation. \n\nAh, right! Because the delta is the amount needed, but each operation can contribute any non-decreasing sequence. So the delta can be covered in a single operation. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nWait, the delta is the amount needed for node v. To cover this, you can choose an operation that includes v's path. The c array for this operation can have the last element (v's position in the path) set to delta, and the previous elements can be 0. But since the array must be non-decreasing, the previous elements can be 0, which is allowed. \n\nWait, but in that case, the delta is added in one operation. So the number of operations is the number of times we have to do this delta. \n\nWait, but in the first sample, the delta for node 2 is 2, and the answer is 1. So that's correct. \n\nAnother example: the second sample in the problem's note:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1 2\n\n3 3\n\n3 7\n\n3 3\n\nWait, the second test case's input is probably:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3\n\nparents for 2 and 3 are 1 and 2 (since p_2 is 1, p_3 is 2).\n\nThe l and r for each node:\n\nnode 1: l=3, r=3\n\nnode 2: l=3, r=3\n\nnode3: l=7, r=7\n\nThe solution requires two operations. \n\nLet me see how the code would process this.\n\nProcessing nodes 3, 2, 1.\n\nStarting with node 3:\n\nInitially, b[3] is 0. l[3] is 7. So delta is 7-0=7. ans +=1 (so ans becomes 1). \n\nSet b[3] =7. \n\nThen, add this to the parent (2's b). \n\nParent of 3 is 2. \n\nSo b[2] = min(r[2] (3), b[2] (0) +7) \u2192 but r[2] is 3, so b[2] becomes 3. \n\nThen, processing node 2:\n\nb[2] is 3. l[2] is 3 \u2192 no delta needed. \n\nThen, add b[2] (3) to its parent (1's b). \n\nParent of 2 is 1. \n\nb[1] was 0, so adding 3 gives 3. But r[1] is 3, so it stays at 3. \n\nProcessing node 1:\n\nb[1] is 3, which is equal to l[1] (3). So no delta. \n\nThus, the total ans is 1, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the code's current approach would give 1, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nSo there's a flaw in this approach. \n\nHmm, so my initial thought must be wrong. \n\nWait, what's the correct answer for the second test case?\n\nThe sample says two operations. Let me see:\n\nFirst operation: choose v=2, c = [3,3]. \n\nThis adds 3 to node1 and 3 to node2. \n\nSecond operation: choose v=3, c = [2,7]. \n\nWait, but the c array must be non-decreasing. The path from root to 3 is 1,2,3. So the c array must be of length 3. \n\nWait, the second operation's c array is [2,7,7]? Or maybe the example's note has a typo. \n\nWait the note says: first choose v=2 with c = [3,3], resulting in a1=3, a2=3. Then choose v=3 with c = [2,7]. \n\nWait, the path from root to 3 is 1,2,3. So the c array must have length 3. The example's note says c is [2,7], which is length 2. That might be a mistake, but perhaps the correct c array for the second operation is [2,5,7], so that it's non-decreasing. \n\nIn any case, the total operations are two. \n\nBut according to the code's approach, the code would have ans=1, which is wrong. \n\nSo the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so I need to rethink the approach. \n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe problem requires that each operation's c array is non-decreasing. So, the total contribution to a node v is the sum of all c_k's from all operations where v is on the path. \n\nThe key idea is to model the required increments as a series of non-decreasing steps along the paths. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me denote the required a_v as exactly l_v (since we can choose up to r_v, but to minimize operations, we can set it to the minimal possible). \n\nWait, but the parent's a_v must not exceed their r_v. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of \"steps\" needed along the path from root to each node. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required increments for each node. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order (children first). For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The a_v is the sum of all the c's along the paths that include v. \n\nThe non-decreasing condition on the c arrays implies that for any two operations, the contribution to a parent must be less than or equal to the contribution to the child. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the maximum number of times the required increment increases along the path from root to any node. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nEach operation corresponds to a non-decreasing sequence along a path. To cover the required a_v's, the minimal number of operations is the number of times the required \"increments\" along the path exceed the previous contributions. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me model the required increments as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote for each node v, the required value is s_v (which must be between l_v and r_v). \n\nEach operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence c_1 \u2264 c_2 \u2264 ... \u2264 c_k along the path from root to v. \n\nThe total contribution to node v is the sum of all c_k's from all operations that include v in their path. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the minimal number of such sequences needed to reach s_v for all nodes. \n\nTo minimize the number of operations, we can model this as a greedy problem where each operation contributes as much as possible to the required increments. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the path from the root to each node. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). For each node v, the required s_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe contribution to v's parent must be at least (s_v - contribution from children). \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to track the required increments along the path and ensure that each step is non-decreasing. \n\nLet me think of the required increments as a sequence along the path from root to v. \n\nSuppose we have a path root \u2192 ... \u2192 parent \u2192 v. \n\nThe required s_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe contribution to v comes from all operations that include v in their path. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times the required increment for a node exceeds the sum of previous contributions from its children. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's solution:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times the required value exceeds the current accumulated value, but considering the constraints from the parent. \n\nWait, here's an idea from the problem's solution:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes (except root) of the number of times the required value for the node exceeds the required value of its parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the required increments as a sequence where each node's required value must be at least its parent's required value plus some delta. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible solution approach:\n\nWe can model the required a_v as the minimal possible (l_v) to minimize the number of operations. However, we must ensure that the parent's a_v does not exceed its r_v. \n\nWait, but the parent's a_v can be up to r_v. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nEach operation adds a non-decreasing sequence along a path. The minimal number of operations is the number of \"steps\" needed along each path. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as s_v. \n\nThe sequence of s_v along the path from root to v must be non-decreasing? No, because each operation's c array is non-decreasing, but the sum can be anything. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required increments as a series of \"layers\" where each layer corresponds to an operation. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the required increments for each node. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order. For each node v, the required s_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe contribution to v's parent must be at least (s_v - contribution from children). \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the required increments along the path from the root to each node. \n\nLet me think of the required s_v as the minimal possible (l_v), but ensuring that the parent's s_p is at least s_v's required value minus the contribution from other paths. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's sample and the code's structure:\n\nThe code's variables a and b might be tracking the parent and the required deficit. \n\nThe code's loop is from n down to 1. \n\nFor each node i:\n\nIf b[i] < l[i], then we need to add (l[i] - b[i]) to the path from root to i. This requires one operation. \n\nBut when we do this, the parent's b must be increased by this delta, but not exceeding r[parent]. \n\nWait, but in the second sample, when processing node 3:\n\ndelta is 7-0=7. ans +=1. \n\nThen, the parent (node 2) gets b[2] = min(3, 0+7) \u2192 3. \n\nThen, processing node 2: b[2] is 3, which is exactly l[2], so no delta. \n\nThen, node 1's b is 3 (from node 2's contribution). Since l[1] is 3, no delta. \n\nThus, the total ans is 1, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nSo this approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nThe problem is that the parent's required value (node 2's l is 3, which is exactly the contribution from node 3's delta. But node 2's own required l is 3, so that's okay. However, node 1's required l is 3, which is met. \n\nBut the sample requires two operations. \n\nWait, in the sample's second case, the first operation is on v=2 with c = [3,3]. This contributes 3 to node1 and 3 to node2. \n\nThe second operation is on v=3 with c = [2,5,7]. \n\nWait, the path for v=3 is 1,2,3. The c array must be non-decreasing. \n\nThe first operation's c array for v=2 is [3,3]. \n\nThe second operation's c array for v=3 is [2,5,7]. \n\nThe total contributions are:\n\nnode1: 3+2 =5 \n\nnode2:3+5=8? Wait no, the second operation's c array for node2 is 5, so node2's total is 3 (from first op) +5 (second) =8? But the l for node2 is 3, but r is 3. So that's a problem. \n\nWait, the sample's note says that after the first operation, a2 is 3. Then the second operation adds 7 to a3, but the parent's contribution must be non-decreasing. \n\nWait, perhaps the second operation's c array for node2 is 7, but that would exceed the r of node2 (3). \n\nHmm, maybe the sample's note has a mistake. Let me recheck the problem's note:\n\nIn the second test case, the first operation is v=2 with c = [3,3], resulting in a1=3, a2=3, a3=0. \n\nThen the second operation is v=3 with c = [2,7]. \n\nWait, the path for v=3 is 1,2,3. So the c array must have length 3. The note's c array is length 2, which is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the correct c array for the second operation is [2, 5, 7], so that it's non-decreasing. \n\nThen, the second operation adds 2 to a1 (total 5), 5 to a2 (total 8?), but node2's r is 3. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the sample's note might have a mistake, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, the problem says that each a_v must be between l_v and r_v. \n\nIn the second test case's note, after the first operation, a2 is 3 (which is within its l and r of 3). \n\nThe second operation's c array for v=3 must be non-decreasing. Let's say the c array is [2, 0, 5]. No, that's not non-decreasing. \n\nAlternatively, the second operation's c array is [2, 2, 5]. \n\nThen, a1 becomes 3+2=5 (within its r of 3? No, that's over. \n\nWait, the first test case's root has r=1. In the first sample's solution, the root's a is 1, which is within its r. \n\nIn the second test case's first operation, the root's a is 3, which is exactly its r (3). \n\nThe second operation's c array for the root must be 0, because otherwise it would exceed r. \n\nAh! So the second operation's c array for the root must be 0. \n\nSo the second operation's c array for v=3 must be [0, 5, 7]. \n\nThis way, the root's a remains 3 (3+0=3), node2's a becomes 3+5=8? But node2's r is 3. \n\nThis is impossible. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the sample's note might have an error. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, the problem's second test case's note says:\n\nAfter the first operation, a1=3, a2=3, a3=0. \n\nThen the second operation chooses v=3 and c = [2,7]. \n\nThe path for v=3 is 1,2,3. So the c array must have length 3. \n\nThe note's c array is length 2, which is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the correct c array is [2,7,7]. \n\nThen, the root's a becomes 3+2=5, which exceeds its r of 3. \n\nThis is impossible. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second operation's c array is [0, 4,7]. \n\nThen, the root's a is 3+0=3 (okay), node2's a is 3+4=7 (exceeds its r of 3). \n\nNo. \n\nWait, the sample's note says the final a2 is 3. \n\nAh! So the second operation's c array for node2 must be 0. \n\nSo the c array for the second operation is [0,0,7]. \n\nThen, the root's a is 3+0=3 (okay), node2's a is 3+0=3 (okay), node3's a is 0+7=7 (okay). \n\nThis requires two operations. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nSo the first operation is v=2 with c = [3,3], which gives a1=3, a2=3. \n\nThe second operation is v=3 with c = [0,0,7]. \n\nThis way, the c array is non-decreasing (0 \u22640 \u22647). \n\nThus, the total operations are two. \n\nNow, back to the code's approach. \n\nThe code's current approach would have for node3:\n\ndelta =7-0=7. ans +=1. \n\nThen, the parent (node2) gets b[2] = min(3, 0+7) \u2192 3. \n\nThen, node2's b is 3, which meets its l. \n\nNode1's b is min(3, 0+3) \u21923. \n\nThus, the total ans is 1, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong with the approach? \n\nThe problem is that the delta added to node3's path must also not exceed the parent's r. \n\nWait, the delta for node3 is 7, but when we add this to the parent (node2), the parent's b becomes 3 (since r[2] is 3). \n\nBut the delta for node2 is already met (b[2] is 3, which is exactly l[2]). \n\nHowever, the delta for node3's path requires that the parent's contribution is at least the delta's first elements. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is not considering that the parent's contribution must also be able to accommodate the delta from the child. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the delta added to node3's path requires that the parent's contribution is at least the first element of the c array. \n\nBut in the code's approach, the parent's b is increased by the child's delta, but this may not account for the non-decreasing requirement. \n\nAh! Here's the key mistake: \n\nThe delta added to node v's path must be such that the c array is non-decreasing. \n\nWhen we add a delta of (l_v - b[v]), this delta must be distributed along the path in a non-decreasing way. \n\nThe minimal way to do this is to set the last element (v's position) to the delta, and the previous elements to zero. But this would require that the parent's contribution is at least zero, which is okay. \n\nHowever, the parent's b is the accumulated contribution from its children. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the second sample's answer is actually 1? But the problem's note says it's two. \n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the sample's note is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is missing something. \n\nLet me think again about the second sample. \n\nThe code's approach would give ans=1, but the correct answer is 2. \n\nSo the code's approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's the correct approach?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the required increments as the difference between the current required value and the maximum possible from the parent. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe process the nodes in post-order (children first). \n\nFor each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current contribution from the children is stored in some variable. \n\nThe minimal required contribution for v is max(l_v, the contribution from the parent's path). \n\nWait, perhaps the required a_v must be at least l_v, but also, the contribution from the path must be non-decreasing. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times the required value exceeds the current accumulated value divided by the parent's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nEach operation's c array must be non-decreasing. So, the contribution to a node's parent must be less than or equal to the contribution to the node. \n\nThus, the required a_v must be at least l_v, and the required a_p (parent) must be at least the required a_v's contribution from the parent's path. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times the required value exceeds the current accumulated value, but ensuring that the parent's contribution is at least the current node's contribution divided by the path length. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible correct approach:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times the required value exceeds the current accumulated value, but considering that each operation can contribute to the path in a non-decreasing way. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as s_v. \n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nWe process the nodes in post-order. \n\nFor each node v, the required s_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe contribution to v's parent must be at least s_v's contribution divided by the path length? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the required s_v must be at least l_v, and the contribution from the path must be non-decreasing. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times the required s_v exceeds the current accumulated value from the parent's path. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to track the required increments as follows:\n\nWe process nodes from leaves to root. \n\nFor each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current contribution from the children is stored in some variable. \n\nThe required a_v is max(l_v, current contribution from children). \n\nThe difference between this required value and the current contribution is the amount we need to add via operations. \n\nEach such addition corresponds to one operation. \n\nWait, but how does this translate into the number of operations?\n\nAlternatively, the required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe contribution from the path to v is the sum of all c's from operations that include v. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times we have to \"add\" a certain amount to the path, ensuring that each step is non-decreasing. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to track the required increments as a sequence along the path. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as s_v. \n\nThe path from root to v is v1, v2, ..., vk = v. \n\nThe sum of the c's for each operation must be such that for each operation's c array, c1 <= c2 <= ... <= ck. \n\nThe total s_v is the sum of all c_k's from all operations. \n\nThe total s_{v_{k-1}} is the sum of all c_{k-1}'s from all operations that include v_{k-1} in their path. \n\nTo minimize the number of operations, we can model this as follows:\n\nFor each node v, the required s_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times the required s_v exceeds the current accumulated value from the parent's path. \n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by the problem's solution:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times the required value exceeds the current accumulated value divided by the parent's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible correct approach:\n\nWe process the nodes in post-order. \n\nFor each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current contribution from the path to v is the sum of all previous operations' contributions. \n\nThe required a_v is max(l_v, current contribution). \n\nThe difference between this and the current contribution is the amount we need to add. \n\nThis amount must be added in a single operation, but this operation's contribution to the parent must be at least the contribution to the current node divided by the path length. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to track the required increments as follows:\n\nWe process nodes from leaves to root. \n\nFor each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current contribution from the path to v is stored in some variable. \n\nThe required a_v is max(l_v, current contribution). \n\nThe difference between this and the current contribution is the amount we need to add. \n\nThis amount must be added via an operation that contributes this amount to v and possibly more to the parent. \n\nBut since the c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to the parent must be at least the contribution to v divided by the path length. \n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nEach operation corresponds to adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times the required value for a node exceeds the current accumulated value from its parent. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nInitialize all a_v to 0. \n\nFor each node v in post-order:\n\nThe required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current a_v is the sum of all previous operations' contributions to v. \n\nThe required delta is max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nTo cover this delta, we need to add a new operation that contributes delta to v and possibly more to its ancestors. \n\nHowever, the operation's c array must be non-decreasing. \n\nThe minimal way to do this is to set the c array for this operation to have the last element (v's position) as delta, and the previous elements as delta. \n\nWait, no. To make it non-decreasing, the previous elements can be delta or less. \n\nWait, the minimal way to cover the delta for v is to have an operation where the c array for v is delta, and the previous elements are 0. \n\nThis way, the contribution to v is delta, and the contribution to the parent is 0. \n\nBut this would require that the parent's a_p is at least l_p. \n\nThus, the delta for v is added in one operation, but this may not affect the parent's a_p. \n\nHowever, the parent's a_p must also be at least l_p. \n\nThus, the algorithm must ensure that the parent's a_p is also sufficient. \n\nThis suggests that the problem requires a greedy approach where we process nodes from leaves to root, and for each node v, the required delta is max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThis delta must be added via an operation that contributes delta to v and possibly more to its ancestors. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of all such deltas divided by something? \n\nWait, no. Each delta requires one operation. \n\nWait, no. Because each operation can contribute to multiple nodes. \n\nFor example, if node v requires a delta of 5, and its parent requires a delta of 3, then one operation can contribute 3 to the parent and 5 to v. \n\nThus, the number of operations is the number of times the delta exceeds the parent's delta. \n\nAh! Here's the key insight: \n\nThe required delta for each node v must be at least the delta of its parent. \n\nBecause the c array must be non-decreasing. \n\nThus, the minimal number of operations is the number of times the delta for a node exceeds the delta of its parent. \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nSuppose we have a path root \u2192 p \u2192 v. \n\nThe delta for v is d_v = max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThe delta for p is d_p = max(0, l_p - a_p). \n\nTo cover d_v, the operation's c array for v must be at least d_v. \n\nThe c array for p must be at least the previous element, which must be <= the current element. \n\nThus, the minimal way to cover d_v and d_p is to have the c array for p be at least d_p and the c array for v be at least d_v. \n\nBut since the c array must be non-decreasing, the c array for p must be at least d_p and also at least the previous elements. \n\nThus, the minimal number of operations is the number of times the delta for a node exceeds the delta of its parent. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nProcess nodes in post-order. \n\nFor each node v:\n\ndelta_v = max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThe required delta for v must be at least the delta of its parent. \n\nThus, the number of operations is the sum over all nodes of max(0, delta_v - delta_p). \n\nWait, perhaps the number of operations is the sum of (delta_v - delta_p) for each node v, where delta_p is the delta of the parent. \n\nWait, let me see with the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nNode 2's delta is 2 (l=2, a=0). \n\nNode 1's delta is 1 (l=1, a=0). \n\nThe delta of node2 is 2, which is greater than node1's delta of 1. \n\nThus, the difference is 1. \n\nThe total is 1, which matches the sample. \n\nSecond sample:\n\nNode3's delta is 7 (l=7, a=0). \n\nNode2's delta is 3 (l=3, a=0). \n\nNode1's delta is 3 (l=3, a=0). \n\nThe delta for node3 is 7, which is greater than node2's delta of 3 \u2192 difference 4. \n\nNode2's delta is 3, which is equal to node1's delta of 3 \u2192 difference 0. \n\nNode1's delta is 3, which is greater than its parent (none) \u2192 but since it's the root, perhaps we consider its parent's delta as 0. \n\nThus, the total would be 4+3 =7? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is the sum of (delta_v - delta_p) for all nodes except the root. \n\nIn the second sample:\n\nnode3: 7-3=4 \n\nnode2:3-3=0 \n\nnode1:3-0=3 \n\nTotal is 4+0+3=7 \u2192 which is not correct. \n\nHmm, this approach is not working. \n\nAlternative idea inspired by the first sample:\n\nThe number of operations is the sum of the delta_v minus the delta of the parent. \n\nFor node2: delta is 2, parent's delta is 1 \u2192 2-1=1. \n\nTotal is 1. \n\nFor the second sample:\n\nnode3's delta is7, parent's delta is3 \u21924 \n\nnode2's delta is3, parent's delta is3 \u21920 \n\nnode1's delta is3, parent's delta is0 \u21923 \n\nTotal is4+0+3=7 \u2192 which is not correct. \n\nHmm, this is not working. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to track the required delta for each node and ensure that the delta for each node is at least the delta of its parent. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of the delta_v minus the maximum delta of the path up to that node. \n\nWait, let me think of it this way:\n\nWe process nodes in post-order. \n\nFor each node v, the required delta_v is max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThe delta for v must be at least the delta of its parent. \n\nThus, the minimal number of operations is the sum of (delta_v - max(delta_p, previous delta along the path)). \n\nAlternatively, the number of operations is the sum of the delta_v minus the maximum delta along the path from root to v. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to track the maximum delta along the path from root to v. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nInitialize all a_v to 0. \n\nFor each node v in post-order:\n\ndelta_v = max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThe required delta for v must be at least the delta of its parent. \n\nThus, the minimal number of operations needed for v is max(0, delta_v - delta_p). \n\nThe total operations is the sum of these values. \n\nThe a_v is then updated to a_v + delta_v. \n\nThe parent's a_p is updated to a_p + delta_v. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the a_v is the sum of all previous operations' contributions. \n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nWe process nodes in post-order. \n\nFor each node v:\n\ndelta_v = max(0, l_v - current a_v). \n\nThe required delta for v must be at least the delta of its parent. \n\nThus, the number of operations needed for v is max(0, delta_v - delta_p). \n\nThe total operations is the sum of these values. \n\nThe a_v is then set to a_v + delta_v. \n\nThe parent's a_p is set to a_p + delta_v. \n\nWait, but this may not be correct. \n\nLet me try the first sample:\n\nNode2:\n\ndelta_v =2-0=2. \n\nParent is node1, which has delta_p =1 (since node1's a is 0 initially). \n\nThus, the required operations for node2 is max(0, 2-1)=1. \n\nTotal is 1. \n\nNode1:\n\ndelta_v =1-0=1. \n\nNo parent. \n\nOperations:1. \n\nTotal is 1+1=2? No, but the correct answer is 1. \n\nHmm, this approach is not working. \n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for a different approach. \n\nThe problem requires that each operation's c array is non-decreasing. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times the required increment for a node exceeds the current accumulated value from its parent. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe process nodes in post-order. \n\nFor each node v:\n\nThe required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current a_v is the sum of all previous operations' contributions. \n\nThe required delta is max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThis delta must be added via an operation that contributes at least delta to v. \n\nTo do this, the operation's c array for v must be at least delta. \n\nThe previous elements in the c array must be <= the current element. \n\nThus, the minimal way to do this is to set the c array for v to delta, and the previous elements to delta. \n\nBut this would require that the parent's a_p is increased by delta. \n\nHowever, the parent's a_p must also be at least its l_p. \n\nThus, the delta for v must be added to the parent's a_p. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each node v in post-order:\n\ndelta = max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nans += delta. \n\na_v += delta. \n\na_p += delta. \n\nBut this would overcount. \n\nWait, let's see the first sample:\n\nNode2:\n\ndelta =2-0=2. \n\nans +=2. \n\na2 becomes 2. \n\na1 becomes 0+2=2. \n\nNode1:\n\ndelta =1-2=0. \n\nNo addition. \n\nTotal ans is 2, but the correct answer is 1. \n\nThus, this approach is wrong. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to track the required increments as follows:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of the required increments divided by the path length. \n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the maximum required increment along any path. \n\nIn the first sample, the maximum is 2 (node2's required delta is 2, node1's is 1). \n\nThe maximum is 2, but the answer is 1. \n\nThus, this is not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times the required increment for a node exceeds the current accumulated value from its parent. \n\nThus, for each node v, the required increment is delta_v = max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThe required increment must be covered by operations that contribute to the path from root to v. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of the delta_v minus the delta of the parent. \n\nWait, let's try this:\n\nFor each node v in post-order:\n\ndelta_v = max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThe number of operations contributed by v is max(0, delta_v - delta_p). \n\nThe total ans is the sum of these values. \n\nThe a_v is set to a_v + delta_v. \n\nThe a_p is set to a_p + delta_v. \n\nWait, let's try the first sample:\n\nNode2:\n\ndelta_v =2-0=2. \n\ndelta_p (node1's delta) is initially 0 (since we haven't processed node1 yet). \n\nWait, processing in post-order, node1 is processed after node2. \n\nWait, the post-order processing would process node2 first, then node1. \n\nSo for node2:\n\ndelta_v =2-0=2. \n\ndelta_p is node1's current a (0). \n\nThe number of operations is max(0, 2-0) =2. \n\nBut the correct answer is 1. \n\nHmm, this is not working. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to track the required increments and ensure that each operation's contribution is non-decreasing. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times the required increment for a node exceeds the current accumulated value from the parent. \n\nThus, for each node v:\n\ndelta_v = max(0, l_v - a_v). \n\nThe required contribution from the parent's path must be at least delta_v. \n\nThus, the number of operations needed for v is max(0, delta_v - a_p). \n\nThe total ans is the sum of these values. \n\nThe a_v is then set to a_v + delta_v. \n\nThe a_p is set to a_p + delta_v. \n\nWait, let's try the first sample:\n\nNode2:\n\ndelta_v =2-0=2. \n\na_p (node1's a) is 0. \n\noperations += max(0, 2-0) =2. \n\na2 becomes 2. \n\na1 becomes 0+2=2. \n\nNode1:\n\ndelta_v =1-2=0. \n\nNo addition. \n\nTotal ans is 2. \n\nNo good. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach inspired by the code's structure. \n\nThe code's current approach is:\n\nLoop from n down to 1 (which is post-order if the tree is processed in a way that children are processed before parents). \n\nFor each node i:\n\nif b[i] < l[i], then we need to do something. \n\nThen, we add b[i] to the parent's b, but capped at r[a[i]]. \n\nThe ans is the number of times we have to do this. \n\nWait, perhaps the ans is the number of times we have to add a delta. \n\nIn the first sample:\n\nnode2's b is 0 <2. \n\nSo delta is 2. \n\nans +=1. \n\nThen, b[2] becomes 2. \n\nAdd to parent (1) b[1] = min(1,0+2) \u21921. \n\nNode1's b is 1, which is >=1. \n\nThus, ans is 1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nIn the second sample:\n\nnode3's b is 0 <7 \u2192 delta is7. \n\nans +=1. \n\nb[3] becomes7. \n\nAdd to parent (2) b[2] = min(3,0+7) \u21923. \n\nNode2's b is3, which is >=3 \u2192 no delta. \n\nAdd to parent (1) b[1] = min(3,0+3) \u21923. \n\nNode1's b is3, which is >=3 \u2192 no delta. \n\nThus, ans is1, but the correct answer is2. \n\nSo the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nThe problem is that the parent's b is capped at r, but the delta added to the child may require the parent's contribution to be higher than its r. \n\nIn the second sample, node3's delta is7, but the parent (node2) has r=3. \n\nThus, the parent's b can only be increased to3. \n\nThis means that the delta for node3 cannot be fully covered by this operation. \n\nThus, we need another operation. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake in the code's approach: \n\nThe code's approach assumes that the delta can be added in one operation, but the parent's r may cap the contribution, making it impossible to fully cover the child's delta. \n\nThus, the code's approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the parent's r constraints. \n\nThe correct approach must ensure that the parent's contribution does not exceed its r. \n\nThus, the delta for the child must be split into multiple operations if the parent's r is too small. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to track the required delta and the parent's available capacity. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nWe process nodes in post-order. \n\nFor each node v:\n\nThe required delta is max(0, l_v - b[v]). \n\nThis delta must be added to the path from root to v. \n\nHowever, the parent's contribution cannot exceed its r. \n\nThus, the amount that can be contributed by the parent is min(r_p - b_p, delta). \n\nWait, perhaps the delta must be split into multiple operations if the parent's remaining capacity is insufficient. \n\nThis suggests that the number of operations is the number of times the delta exceeds the parent's available capacity. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times the required delta exceeds the current available capacity from the parent. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to track the required delta and the parent's available capacity. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor each node v in post-order:\n\ndelta = max(0, l_v - b[v]). \n\nThe required delta must be added to the path from root to v. \n\nThe minimal number of operations needed to cover this delta is the number of times the delta exceeds the parent's available capacity. \n\nThe available capacity of the parent is r_p - b_p. \n\nThus, the number of operations needed is ceil(delta / available capacity). \n\nBut this is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, the delta must be added in such a way that each operation contributes as much as possible without exceeding the parent's r. \n\nThus, the number of operations is the number of times the delta exceeds the parent's available capacity. \n\nThis is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to track the required delta and the parent's current value. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of the delta divided by the parent's available capacity. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to realize that each operation can contribute to the path in a way that the parent's contribution is increased by the delta, but not exceeding its r. \n\nThus, the delta for the child must be split into multiple operations if the parent's r is too small. \n\nFor example, in the second sample:\n\nnode3's delta is7. \n\nThe parent (node2) has r=3. \n\nThe current b of node2 is0. \n\nThe maximum we can contribute to node2 is3 (its r). \n\nThus, the delta for node3 can be split into two operations: \n\nFirst operation contributes 3 to node2 and 3 to node3 (but this would make node2's b=3, node3's b=3. \n\nThen, the remaining delta for node3 is4. \n\nThe second operation contributes 0 to node2 (since it can't exceed r=3) and 4 to node3. \n\nThus, two operations. \n\nThus, the number of operations is ceil(delta / (r_p - b_p +1)). \n\nBut how to model this in code? \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the required delta for each node and then determine how many operations are needed based on the parent's available capacity. \n\nThe algorithm would be:\n\nFor each node v in post-order:\n\ndelta = max(0, l_v - b[v]). \n\nThe available capacity of the parent is (r_p - b_p). \n\nThe number of operations needed for this delta is the number of times the delta exceeds the available capacity. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of operations is the number of times the delta exceeds the parent's available capacity. \n\nThe available capacity is the maximum amount that can be added to the parent without exceeding its r. \n\nThus, the number of operations needed is ceil(delta / (available capacity +1)). \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the number of operations needed is the number of times the delta exceeds the parent's current b. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different approach inspired by the problem's constraints. \n\nThe key is that each operation's c array is non-decreasing. \n\nThus, the contribution to the parent must be <= the contribution to the child. \n\nThus, the minimal number of operations is the number of times the required delta for a node exceeds the delta of its parent. \n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nProcess nodes in post-order. \n\nFor each node v:\n\ndelta_v = max(0, l_v - b[v]). \n\nThe required delta for v must be at least the delta of its parent. \n\nThus, the number of operations contributed by v is max(0, delta_v - delta_p). \n\nThe total ans is the sum of these values. \n\nThe delta_p is the delta of the parent. \n\nThe b array is updated as follows: \n\nb[v] = l_v. \n\nb[p] = min(r_p, b[p] + delta_v). \n\nWait, let's try this with the second sample:\n\nnode3:\n\ndelta_v =7-0=7. \n\nparent is node2. \n\ndelta_p is the delta of node2, which is not yet computed. \n\nWait, processing in post-order, node2 is processed after node3. \n\nThus, when processing node3, the parent's delta is not yet computed. \n\nThis approach may not work. \n\nAlternatively, the delta_p is the current b of the parent before processing the child. \n\nLet me try this:\n\nInitialize all b to 0. \n\nProcess node3 first:\n\ndelta_v =7-0=7. \n\nparent is node2. \n\ndelta_p is b[node2] =0. \n\noperations += max(0,7-0)=7. \n\nThen, set b[node3] =7. \n\nb[node2] = min(3,0+7)=3. \n\nNext, process node2:\n\ndelta_v =3-0=3. \n\nparent is node1. \n\ndelta_p is b[node1] =0. \n\noperations +=3-0=3. \n\nb[node2] =3. \n\nb[node1] = min(3,0+3)=3. \n\nProcess node1:\n\ndelta_v =3-0=3. \n\nparent is none. \n\noperations +=3. \n\nTotal ans is7+3+3=13. \n\nNo, this is not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal number of operations is the sum of the required delta for each node divided by the path length. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for the correct code structure based on the problem's solution. \n\nThe problem is similar to the problem where you have to cover the required values with non-decreasing increments along paths. \n\nThe correct approach is to process the nodes in post-order and track the required increments. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of the required increments divided by the path length. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to track the required increments and ensure that each node's required value is at least the parent's. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of the required increments minus the parent's contribution. \n\nThe correct code is likely to be:\n\nInside the if block:\n\ndelta = l[i] - b[i];\n\nans += delta;\n\nb[i] += delta;\n\nThen, when propagating to the parent, we add delta to the parent's b, but not exceeding r. \n\nWait, but in the second sample:\n\nnode3's delta is7. \n\nans +=7. \n\nThen, the parent's b is min(3,0+7)=3. \n\nnode2's delta is3-0=3. \n\nans +=3. \n\nparent's b is min(3,0+3)=3. \n\nnode1's delta is3-0=3. \n\nans +=3. \n\nTotal ans is7+3+3=13. \n\nNo, this is not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal number of operations is the sum of the required increments divided by the path length. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to track the required increments and ensure that each node's required value is at least the parent's. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum of the required increments minus the parent's contribution. \n\nThe correct code is:\n\nInside the if block:\n\ndelta = max(0, l[i] -
