            "text": "The divisions are based on the rating as follows:\n\nDivision 1: 1900 and above. Division 2: 1600 to 1899. Division 3: 1400 to 1599. Division 4: 1399 or below. So for each test case, I have to read the rating and then check these conditions in order. The code provided has a loop that runs n times, where n is the number of test cases. The TODO is inside that loop, so I need to write the code that processes each test case. First, inside the loop, I need to read the rating. So I should add a variable, say 'rating', and use scanf to get it. Then, based on the value of rating, determine the division. Hmm, the order of checking is important here. Since the divisions are exclusive, I should check from the highest to the lowest. Like, first check if it's >=1900, then else if between 1600 and 1899, etc. So the steps for each test case are:\n\n1. Read the rating. 2. Check conditions in order:\n   a. If rating >=1900 \u2192 Division 1\n   b. Else if between 1600 and 1899 \u2192 Division 2\n   c. Else if between 1400 and 1599 \u2192 Division3\n   d. Else \u2192 Division4\n3. Print \"Division X\" where X is 1-4. Wait, what about ratings below 1400? Like negative numbers? The problem says the input can be as low as -5000, but those all go to division4. So the else case covers that. So code structure inside the loop:\n\nint rating;\nscanf(\"%d\", &rating); Then, use if-else statements. Let me think about the conditions:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    printf(\"Division 1\\n\");\n} else if (rating >=1600) { // because if it's between 1600 and 1899, this is division2\n    printf(\"Division 2\\n\");\n} else if (rating >=1400) { // 1400-1599 \u2192 division3\n    printf(\"Division 3\\n\");\n} else { // everything else (<=1399) \u2192 division4\n    printf(\"Division 4\\n\");\n} Wait, that's a clever way. Because once it's not in the first division, we check next. Since the first condition is 1900+, the next condition (>=1600) would cover up to 1899. Then >=1400 would be 1400-1599, and else is the rest. That should work. Alternatively, could write each condition fully, but this way is more efficient. Yes, that logic works. Let me test with the examples given in the notes. Test case 1: -789 \u2192 division4. The code would go else, correct. Test case with 1399: same, else.\n\n1400: >=1400 \u2192 but since it's not >=1600, so the third condition (>=1400) is true \u2192 division3.\n\n1679: in the second condition (>=1600 but <1900 \u2192 division2.\n\n2300 \u2192 division1. All correct. So the code should be as above. So putting it all together, inside the while loop (which runs n times), first read the rating, then the if-else chain. Wait, the original code has while(n>0) { ... }, and each iteration is a test case. So after reading each rating, process it, then decrement n? Wait, no. Wait the loop is while(n>0), so each time through the loop, we process one test case, but n is being decremented somewhere. Oh, the original code's loop is while(n>0), but the code inside the loop must decrease n each time. Wait, the original code is:\n\nint main(){int n;scanf(\"%d\",&n);while (n>0){/* TODO: Your code here */}} So the user's code hasn't included the part where n is decremented.",

Else division4 (<=1399). That's correct.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nSo the code to fill in the TODO is all of that. So the missing code is:\n\nint rating;\nscanf(\"%d\", &rating);\nif(rating >=1900) printf(\"Division 1\\n\");\nelse if(rating >=1600) printf(\"Division 2\\n\");\nelse if(rating >=1400) printf(\"Division 3\\n\");\nelse printf(\"Division 4\\n\");\nn--;\n\nAlternatively, the code can be written with braces for the if-else, but since the code is in C++, the semicolons after the if lines are okay as long as the statements are single. But to be safe, maybe using braces is better, but the problem says to output the code as plain text. The user's code uses C-style (since it's #include<stdio.h>), but it's in C++. Anyway, the code should work as written.\n\nWait, but in the code, the user's code is written with C syntax (main returns int, uses printf etc.), but it's okay.\n\nSo the code inside the loop must read the rating, process, and then decrement n. So the missing code is exactly those lines."
