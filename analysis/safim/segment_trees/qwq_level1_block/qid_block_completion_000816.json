Then i=2 (c), sum += c \u2192 c + d. Then i=1 (b), sum becomes b + c + d. So the sum at i is the sum of elements from i to end. So Bob is taking from the end, so if he takes up to i (inclusive), that's (n - i) candies. So when the current sum (the suffix sum) is equal to a prefix sum stored in the map, then Alice can take up to the prefix's index (say, a), and Bob can take from the end up to i (so the number is n - i).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the Eating_Candies method in the given Java code. Let's see what the problem is asking. The goal is to find the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat together such that their total weights are equal. \n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves tracking the prefix sums from the left and the suffix sums from the right. The idea is that Alice takes some number of candies from the left, Bob takes some from the right, and their total weights must be equal. We want the maximum total candies they can take under this condition.\n\nLooking at the existing code: The code first computes the prefix sums and stores them in a HashMap called presum. The key is the sum, and the value is the index up to which that sum is achieved. Then, it starts iterating from the end (Bob's side) and accumulates the sum from the right. For each sum encountered here, it checks if that sum exists in the prefix map. If it does, and the prefix's index is less than the current position (so that there's no overlap), then maybe that's a candidate.\n\nWait, the current code's logic is: for each suffix sum (sum from the right up to i), check if that sum exists in the prefix sums. And if the prefix's index (the 'i' stored in presum) is less than the current position (which is the index from the end). Because if the prefix sum is up to some position before the current suffix's starting point, then Alice and Bob can take those without overlapping. \n\nSo, when that condition is met, we need to calculate how many candies they have taken in total here. The total would be (prefix index + 1) [since Alice took up to that index, which is 0-based, so +1] plus (n - current index) [since Bob is taking from the end up to current index, so the number is n - i]. \n\nBut in the code, the 'total_candies' is being tracked. So whenever such a case is found, we need to compare it with the current maximum and update accordingly. \n\nThe missing part in the TODO is probably to compute the current possible total candies when the sum is found in the prefix, and then keep track of the maximum. \n\nWait, the code initializes total_candies as 0. So in the loop, whenever we find a sum that exists in the prefix and the prefix's index is before the current i (since i is from the end), then the total would be (presum.get(sum) + 1) + (n - i). We need to see if this is larger than the current total_candies, and if so, update it. \n\nSo the code inside the if block should be something like:\n\nint currentTotal = (presum.get(sum) + 1) + (Ws.length - i);\nif (currentTotal > total_candies) {\n    total_candies = currentTotal;\n}\n\nWait, but the index in the presum is the index up to which the prefix sum is achieved. Let me think again. Suppose the prefix sum is sumA, which is the sum of the first a candies (indices 0 to a-1?), or 0-based up to a? Let me check the code:\n\nIn the code, for the presum, they loop i from 0 to Ws.length-1. Each step adds Ws[i] to sum, then puts sum as key and i as value. So for example, after first iteration (i=0), sum is Ws[0], and the key sum maps to 0. So the sum up to index i (inclusive) is stored. So the prefix sum up to index i is sum, and the number of candies Alice takes is i+1. \n\nOn the other side, when iterating from the end, for each i (starting from the end), the sum is accumulating from the right. Let's say the current i is the starting point from the right. Wait, the loop is for i from n-1 down to 0. The sum here is adding Ws[i], so the sum is the sum of the last (n - i) elements. Because when i is at position k, the elements from k to end are being added. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the array is [a, b, c, d]. The first loop for the suffix sum starts at i=3 (d), sum is d. Then i=2 (c), sum += c \u2192 c + d. Then i=1 (b), sum becomes b + c + d. So the sum at i is the sum of elements from i to end. So Bob is taking from the end, so if he takes up to i (inclusive), that's (n - i) candies. \n\nSo when the current sum (the suffix sum) is equal to a prefix sum stored in the map, then Alice can take up to the prefix's index (say, a), and Bob can take from the end up to i (so the number is n - i). The total is (a+1) + (n - i). But we also need to make sure that the prefix's index (a) is less than i. Because otherwise, the regions would overlap. For example, if a is >= i, then the candies between a and i would be in both regions, which is not allowed. \n\nSo the condition is that the prefix's index (presum.get(sum)) must be less than the current i (the starting point of Bob's candies). \n\nTherefore, when that's true, the total is (a+1) + (n - i). \n\nSo in the code, inside the if block, we can compute this and compare with the current maximum. \n\nSo the code inside the TODO should be:\n\nint a = presum.get(sum);\nint currentTotal = (a + 1) + (Ws.length - i);\nif (currentTotal > total_candies) {\n    total_candies = currentTotal;\n}\n\nWait, but the 'i' here is the current index in the suffix loop. Let me confirm the variables. \n\nIn the code, the loop for the suffix is:\n\nfor (int i = Ws.length-1; i >=0; i--) {\n    sum += Ws[i];\n    if (presum contains sum and presum.get(sum) < i) {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\nWait, the 'i' here is the current position in the array. For example, when i is 3 (the last element), the sum is Ws[3], so Bob is taking 1 candy (n - i = 4-3=1). The prefix's index stored in the map for that sum would be, say, a. If a < i (3), then Alice's part is up to a, and Bob's part starts at i (3). Since a < i, their regions don't overlap. \n\nSo the total candies would be (a+1) + (n - i). \n\nTherefore, the code inside the if block should calculate this and update the total_candies if it's larger. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nint a = presum.get(sum);\nint currentTotal = (a + 1) + (Ws.length - i);\nif (currentTotal > total_candies) {\n    total_candies = currentTotal;\n}\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple instances where the sum is found? We need to track the maximum possible. So each time we find a valid case, we check if it's better than the current maximum. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAnother thing to consider: the initial value of total_candies is 0. So even if there's a case where the sum is 0 (but since all weights are positive, that can't happen except when n=0, but n is at least 1). So the code should handle all cases. \n\nWait, but what about the case where the entire array can be split such that the sum of left and right parts are equal, but the middle is left? Like in the second example given in the problem statement. Let me see the second example:\n\nSample Input 2: 6 candies with weights [1,2,3,1,2,3]. The solution is Alice takes first 3 (sum 6?), wait no, the note says Alice takes first three (sum 1+2+3=6?), but Bob takes the last three (sum 1+2+3=6). So total is 6. \n\nIn the code, when the sum is 6 (the suffix sum when i is 3 (the fourth element?), let's see:\n\nWait the array is [1,2,3,1,2,3]. The suffix sum when i=3 (the fourth element, 1) would be 1 + 2 +3 (the elements from i=3 to end: 1,2,3? Wait no, the elements from i to end are 1 (index3), 2 (4), 3 (5). So sum is 6. The prefix sum for 6 would be the first three elements (indices 0-2: sum 6). The a would be 2 (since the sum 6 is stored at index 2). The current i is 3. So a (2) < i (3). So the total is (2+1) + (6-3) \u2192 3 + 3 =6. Which is correct. \n\nSo the code would capture that. \n\nAnother test case: when there's no possible split, like the third example where the answer is 0. The code would return 0 since no such sum is found. \n\nWhat about when the entire array can be split into Alice and Bob taking all except the middle? Like in the fourth example. \n\nSo the code should handle all these cases. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is as I thought. \n\nWait, but in the code, the 'presum' is a HashMap. The key is the sum, and the value is the index. So when there are multiple prefix sums with the same value, the map will only store the latest index. Wait no, because when you put the same key again, it overwrites the previous entry. So for example, if the prefix sums are 1,3,3, then the sum 3 would be stored with index 2. So when looking up sum 3, it would get the last occurrence. \n\nBut in the problem, we want the earliest possible prefix sum so that the remaining can be as large as possible. Wait, no. Let me think. \n\nSuppose there are multiple prefix sums with the same value. For example, suppose the prefix sums are 5 at index 2 and 5 again at index 4. \n\nIf the suffix sum is 5, then when we process the suffix at some i, the code would check if the prefix has sum 5. The stored index would be 4 (the last occurrence). But if the current i is, say, 5 (the last element), then the prefix index 4 is less than i (5), so that's okay. The total would be (4+1) + (n -5) \u2192 5 + (n-5) = n. So that's the entire array. \n\nBut if the prefix index was 2, then the total would be 3 + (n -i). So which one is better? \n\nIn this case, if the suffix sum is 5, and the current i is 5 (the last element), then the prefix index 4 is better because it allows Alice to take up to 4, and Bob takes 1 (the last element). So total is 5 (4+1) +1 =6 (if n is 5). \n\nAlternatively, if the prefix index was 2, then Alice takes 3 candies, Bob takes 1, total 4. So the code would pick the later index (4) which gives a better total. \n\nTherefore, storing the latest index for a given sum is better because it allows Alice to take more candies. \n\nHence, the HashMap correctly stores the latest index for each sum. \n\nTherefore, the code is okay. \n\nSo the missing code is as I wrote. \n\nWait, but in the code, the 'presum' is built by iterating from left to right, and for each sum, it's stored. So for example, if the same sum occurs multiple times, the last occurrence's index is stored. \n\nTherefore, when we look up the sum in the suffix loop, we get the latest possible index where the prefix sum equals the current suffix sum. \n\nThis is good because that allows Alice to take as many as possible (since the index is as far as possible) so that the total can be maximized. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nSo the missing part is to compute the currentTotal and update the total_candies. \n\nSo the code inside the if block should be:\n\nint a = presum.get(sum);\nint currentTotal = (a + 1) + (Ws.length - i);\nif (currentTotal > total_candies) {\n    total_candies = currentTotal;\n}\n\nYes. \n\nWait, but what about when the sum is zero? Well, the problem states that the weights are at least 1, so sum can't be zero. So no problem there. \n\nAnother edge case: when n=1. Then Alice and Bob can't both take it. So the only possibility is if the sum is zero, which isn't possible, so the answer is 0. \n\nAnother case: when the entire array's sum is even, and Alice and Bob can split it into exactly half each. Then the total would be n (if they take all except the middle part, but only if their sums are equal). \n\nWait, but in that case, the code would find when the sum is half the total. \n\nSo the code should handle that. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is as above. \n\nSo the final code for the Eating_Candies function would have that part filled in. \n\nWait, but in the code, the 'sum' variable in the suffix loop is being accumulated. Let me check the code again. \n\nIn the suffix loop:\n\nsum starts at 0, then for each i from the end, sum += Ws[i]. \n\nWait, the first iteration (i = n-1) adds Ws[n-1], so sum is the last element. \n\nThen next i is n-2, sum += Ws[n-2], so sum is the sum of last two elements, etc. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo the code is correct except for the missing part. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill in that code block."
