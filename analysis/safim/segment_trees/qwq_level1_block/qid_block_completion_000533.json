Maybe the a[i] is supposed to collect all points that are at the minimal distance from i, plus i itself. \n\nThe next step is sorting a[i], then sorting all a arrays. \n\nThe rest of the code is DP, which I might not need to worry about right now. The problem is just to fill in the missing code. \n\nSo the missing code is to compute the distance between i and j, and track the minimum. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the inner loop (the TODO part) should be:\n\nint d = abs(x[i] - x[j]) + abs(y[i] - y[j]);\nmi[i] = min(mi[i], d);\n\nWait, but the code is inside the loop where i and j are different. So the code for the inner loop (the j loop) is:\n\nfor (int j=1; j<=n; j++) if (i^j) { ... }\n\nWait, the condition is \"if (i^j)\", which is equivalent to \"if (i != j)\", since XOR of i and j is non-zero when they are different. \n\nSo inside that loop, for each j not equal to i, compute the distance between i and j, and set mi[i] to the minimum between its current value and that distance. \n\nYes, that's exactly what's needed. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nint d = abs(x[i] - x[j]) + abs(y[i] - y[j]);\nmi[i] = min(mi[i], d);\n\nWait, but in C++, the code would be written as:\n\nint d = abs(x[i] - x[j]) + abs(y[i] - y[j]);\nif (d < mi[i]) mi[i] = d;\n\nAlternatively, using the min function. Either way is okay. \n\nSo the code inside the inner loop (the TODO part) is those two lines. \n\nWait, but the code is in the loop over j from 1 to n, and for each j not equal to i, so the code must compute the distance and track the minimum. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nint d = abs(x[i] - x[j]) + abs(y[i] - y[j]);\nmi[i] = min(mi[i], d);\n\nYes, that's it. \n\nSo the missing code is those two lines. \n\nI think that's the correct answer here. Let me double-check. \n\nThe problem requires that for each point, the minimal distance to another point is stored in mi[i], so that a[i] can collect all points (including itself) that are within that distance. \n\nYes, so the code inside the inner loop (the j loop) must compute the distance and track the minimum. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is as above."
