Wait, but how? Alternatively, let's think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe can represent the constraints as follows. For each i, the value of b_i must be at least (b_{i-1} + 1). But since b_i must be a multiple of a_i (since it's k_i * a_i), the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because the multiple can be negative. For example, if a_i is 3, and the previous b_{i-1} is 5, then the next b_i must be at least 6. The minimal multiple would be 6 (2*3), but maybe a negative multiple could be better? No, because it has to be larger than 5. So the minimal possible is indeed the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. Wait, but the multiple can be any integer (positive or negative). So the minimal possible b_i is the smallest integer multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}. Wait, but the minimal moves would be the minimal |k_i| such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}.

So the minimal possible b_i is the smallest integer multiple of a_i that is greater than prev_b. Wait, but the minimal |k_i| would correspond to the closest multiple of a_i to prev_b, but just above it. Hmm, let's think of it as follows:\n\nWe need to find the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i > prev_b. The minimal |k_i| would be the minimal number of steps to reach such a k_i. Let me compute the minimal k_i: Let's compute the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i > prev_b. The minimal k_i can be found by:\n\nk_i_min = ceil( (prev_b + 1) / a_i ) Wait, but that's only if a_i is positive, which it is. Wait, let me see:\n\nSuppose prev_b is 5, a_i is 3. Then the minimal k_i is 2 (since 2*3=6>5). So (5+1)/3 = 2, so ceil(6/3)=2. So that works. Another example: prev_b is 4, a_i is 3. (4+1)/3 = 5/3 ~1.666, so ceil is 2. 2*3=6>4. Correct. Another case where prev_b is negative. Suppose prev_b is -3, a_i is 2. Then the minimal k_i can be 0 (0*2=0 >-3). So (prev_b +1) is -2, divided by 2 is -1. So ceil(-1) is -1. But k_i =-1 would give -2, which is not greater than -3. Wait, so that approach may not work here. Hmm, so perhaps the formula is not exactly that. Wait, let's think again. The minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > prev_b. So solving for k_i:\n\nk_i > prev_b / a_i. Since a_i is positive, the inequality direction remains the same. So the minimal k_i is floor(prev_b / a_i) + 1. Wait, let's see:\n\nprev_b =5, a_i=3: prev_b/a_i is 1.666..., floor is 1, so 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nprev_b =4, a_i=3: 4/3 is 1.333, floor is 1, so 2. Correct. prev_b =-3, a_i=2: -3/2 is -1.5, floor is -2. So -2 +1 =-1. Then k_i =-1 gives -2, which is greater than -3? Yes, because -2 is greater than -3. So that works. So the minimal k_i here is -1, which gives a value of -2, which is better (smaller in absolute terms) than k_i=0 (0, which is also acceptable but requires 0 moves. Wait, but k_i can be -1, which gives a value of -2, which is greater than -3, and the move count is |-1|=1, but if we choose k_i=0, the move count is 0. So in this case, the minimal move is 0, but the formula gives k_i=-1, which is worse. So the formula is not correct here.",

So in that case, when x is negative, the minimal k is 0 if 0*a_i >x \u2192 0> x (since x is prev_b, which is the previous b value). Wait, yes. So if prev_b is negative, then choosing k_i=0 gives b_i=0, which is greater than prev_b (since prev_b is negative). So that's acceptable, and the move count is 0, which is better than any other k_i. So in this case, the minimal k_i is 0. So the formula needs to account for that. Hmm, so the minimal k_i is the minimal between:\n\n- The minimal k_i that is the smallest integer greater than x/a (so floor(x/a)+1), and\n\n- 0, if 0*a_i >x (i.e., 0> x). Wait, but 0*a_i is 0, so 0> x is equivalent to x <0. So when x <0, then k_i=0 is a candidate. So the minimal k_i is the one between 0 and floor(x/a)+1 which has the minimal |k|. Wait, but in the case where x is negative, like x=-3, a=2:\n\nfloor(x/a) is -2 \u2192 floor(x/a)+1 is -1. So between k=-1 and k=0, the minimal |k| is 0. So the minimal k_i is 0. Another example: x= -5, a=3. Then, floor(x/a) is -2 (since -5/3 is -1.666, floor is -2). So floor(x/a)+1 is -1. So k=-1 gives -3, which is greater than -5. The move count is 1. But k=0 gives 0, which is better (move count 0). So the minimal is 0. Another case where x is positive:\n\nx=5, a=3 \u2192 floor(5/3)=1 \u2192 +1 \u21922. So k=2 gives 6>5. The move count is 2.

Alternatively, the minimal k_i is the minimal between the following candidates:\n\n1. The smallest integer greater than x/a (i.e., floor(x/a)+1). 2. 0, if 0*a_i >x (i.e., x <0). 3. Also, perhaps the next lower integer (like floor(x/a)), but that might not satisfy the condition.

So the move count is k_i. So this should work. Wait, let's test this algorithm with the first example:\n\nExample1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]. Processing:\n\nprev_b starts at 0.\n\ni=1 (a[1]=2):\n\nprev_b is 0 (non-negative).\n\nk_i = floor(0/2)+1 \u21920+1=1 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total is 1.\n\nprev_b becomes 2*1=2.\n\ni=2 (a[2]=3):\n\nprev_b is 2.\n\nk_i = floor(2/3)=0 \u2192 +1 \u21921 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nprev_b becomes 3*1=3.\n\ni=3 (a[3]=4):\n\nprev_b is3.\n\nk_i = floor(3/4)=0 \u2192+1 \u21921 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total 3.\n\nprev_b becomes4*1=4. i=4 (a[4]=5):\n\nprev_b is4.\n\nk_i = floor(4/5)=0 \u2192+1 \u21921 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total 4. So total is 4, which matches the example. Another test case: the second example in the problem description. Example2:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSample Output:10. The example explanation says that the final array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3], which requires 10 moves. Let's see how the algorithm would handle this. Wait, according to the algorithm:\n\nprev_b starts at 0.\n\ni=1 (a[1]=1):\n\nprev_b is 0 \u2192 non-negative.\n\nk_i = floor(0/1)+1 \u21920+1=1 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total 1.\n\nprev_b becomes 1*1=1.\n\ni=2 (a[2]=1):\n\nprev_b is1.\n\nk_i = floor(1/1)+1 \u21921+1=2 \u2192 move +=2 \u2192 total 3.\n\nprev_b becomes 2*1=2. i=3 (a[3]=1):\n\nprev_b is2 \u2192 k_i=2+1=3 \u2192 move +=3 \u2192 total 6.\n\nprev_b=3.\n\ni=4 (a[4]=1):\n\nk_i=3+1=4 \u2192 move +=4 \u2192 total 10.\n\nprev_b=4. i=5 (a[5]=1):\n\nk_i=4+1=5 \u2192 move +=5 \u2192 total 15.\n\ni=6 (a[6]=1):\n\nk_i=5+1=6 \u2192 move +=6 \u2192 total 21. But the example's output is 10. So this approach is not working here. Hmm, so there's a problem here. The algorithm gives 21, but the correct answer is 10. So clearly, the algorithm is wrong. Hmm, so what's wrong with the approach? The example's optimal solution is to have the array as [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3], which requires:\n\nFor each element:\n\nb_1 =-3 \u2192 k_1 =-3 \u2192 moves 3. b_2 =-2 \u2192 k_2 =-2 \u2192 moves 2.\n\nb_3 =-1 \u2192 k_3 =-1 \u2192 moves 1. b_4 =0 \u2192 k_4=0 \u2192 moves 0.\n\nb_5=1 \u2192k_5=1 \u2192 moves 1. b_6=2 \u2192k_6=2 \u2192 moves 2. b_7=3 \u2192k_7=3 \u2192 moves3.

Total:3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12? Hmm, but the example says 10. Maybe I'm missing something. Wait perhaps the example's array is different. Let me recheck the example:\n\nThe example says: \"Example 2: you can reach [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves.\" Wait, perhaps the first element is -3 (k=-3, moves 3), second is -2 (k=-2, moves 2), third is -1 (k=-1, moves 1), fourth is 0 (k=0, moves 0), fifth is 1 (k=1, moves 1), sixth is 2 (k=2, moves 2), seventh is 3 (k=3, moves 3).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of moves to make array b strictly increasing. The moves allowed are adding or subtracting a_i to b_i each time. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each move can either add or subtract a_i from b_i. Since initially all b_i are zero, the final b array must be such that each element is strictly larger than the previous. The goal is to find the minimal total moves required.\n\nWait, the key here is to model the constraints between consecutive elements. Let's see. For the array to be increasing, each b[i] must be > b[i-1]. Since each b[i] can be adjusted by multiples of a_i (since each move adds or subtracts a_i, so the total change is a multiple of a_i?), wait no. Wait, each move on b_i can add or subtract a_i once. So the total change for b_i is some integer multiple of a_i. Because each move contributes \u00b1a_i. So the total change for b_i is k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (could be positive, negative, or zero). So the final b_i is k_i * a_i. Wait, no, because the initial b_i is zero, so yes, exactly. So the final b_i is the sum of all the moves applied to it, which is k_i * a_i, where k_i is the number of times you added minus the number of times you subtracted. So the total moves for b_i is |k_i|, since each addition or subtraction is a move. So the total moves is the sum of |k_i| for all i.\n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n such that:\n\nk_1 * a_1 < k_2 * a_2 < ... < k_n * a_n,\n\nand the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nHmm, how do I model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem. Let's think of the sequence step by step. For each position i, we need to choose k_i such that the current value is greater than the previous one, and track the minimal moves up to that point.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to process the array from left to right, and for each position, determine the minimal required k_i based on the previous k_{i-1}.\n\nLet me think of the constraints between consecutive elements. Let's denote b_i = k_i * a_i. Then, for the sequence to be increasing, we must have b_{i} > b_{i-1}.\n\nSo for each i from 2 to n:\n\nk_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n\nWe need to choose k_i such that this holds, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nHmm, but how do we model this? Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have already determined k_{i-1}, then for k_i, the minimal |k_i| would be such that k_i * a_i is just larger than k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}.\n\nWait, but since a_i can be any positive integer, perhaps we can model this as a greedy approach, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current value of b_i, but since the numbers can be up to 1e9, that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think of the minimal moves required up to the i-th element, given that the previous element's value is some value. But again, the values can be large, so that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the required minimal k_i given the previous constraints.\n\nLet me think step by step. Let's start with the first element. For the first element, there's no constraint except that it can be any multiple of a_1. But since we want to minimize the total moves, perhaps the best is to set k_1 = 0 (so b_1 is 0, which requires 0 moves). But then the next element must be greater than 0. Wait, but maybe that's not optimal. Wait, but maybe the first element can be set to a lower value so that the next elements can have smaller k's. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element can be set to any value, but the key is to choose the sequence of k_i's such that each subsequent k_i * a_i is just enough to be larger than the previous, while keeping the sum of |k_i| as small as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering each step and adjusting the current k_i based on the previous.\n\nLet me think of the process step by step. Let's start with the first element. Let's say we choose k_1. The minimal moves here is |k_1|. Then, for the second element, we need to choose k_2 such that k_2 * a_2 > k_1 * a_1. The minimal |k_2| would be the smallest possible integer such that this inequality holds. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the minimal required value for each b_i given the previous b_{i-1}.\n\nLet me think of the variables in terms of the previous value. Let's denote the previous value as prev. Then, the current b_i must be at least prev + 1. Since b_i must be strictly greater than prev.\n\nSo, for each i, given the previous value prev, the minimal |k_i| such that k_i * a_i >= prev + 1.\n\nWait, but how do we track this? Because the previous value depends on the choices made for all previous k's.\n\nHmm, perhaps dynamic programming is the way to go here. Let me think of DP[i][prev] as the minimal moves up to the i-th element, where prev is the value of b_{i-1}. But since prev can be very large, this is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can track the minimal moves and the required minimal value for the next step. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right, keeping track of the minimal possible value that the current b_i can take, given the constraints from the previous steps, and also track the minimal moves required up to that point.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems. Let's consider that for each position i, the minimal required value of b_i is determined by the previous b_{i-1} plus 1. But since b_i must be a multiple of a_i (since it's k_i * a_i), we can compute the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i is at least (previous_b + 1). But also, we can choose to set b_i to a lower value if that allows for a smaller total moves, but that might not be possible because it has to be larger than the previous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to adjust each b_i to be as small as possible given the previous constraints, which would minimize the required k's.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nLet me denote the current b_i as the minimal possible value given the previous constraints, so that the next elements can have the smallest possible k's.\n\nLet me think of the process step by step:\n\nStart with the first element. Let's set b_1 to 0 (k_1 = 0, moves 0). Then, for the second element, we need b_2 > 0. The minimal possible b_2 is 1, but since b_2 must be a multiple of a_2, the minimal possible is the smallest multiple of a_2 that is greater than 0. So that would be a_2 * 1 (if a_2 is 1, then 1; if a_2 is 2, then 2, etc). But the minimal moves here would be 1 (since k_2 is 1, so |1| =1). But maybe there's a better way?\n\nWait, but maybe the first element can be adjusted to a lower value so that the second can have a smaller k. For example, if a_1 is 3, then setting k_1 to -1 would make b_1 = -3, then the second element can be 0 (if a_2 is 1, then k_2=0 gives 0, but that's not greater than -3. Wait, but 0 is greater than -3, so that's okay. Wait, but then the second element can be 0, which requires 0 moves. So that's better. So in this case, choosing k_1 = -1 (cost 1) and k_2 =0 (cost 0) gives total 1, which is better than the previous approach of k_1=0 and k_2=1 (total 1). Hmm, same total here, but maybe in other cases it's better.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that the choice for previous k's affects the current and future steps. So this suggests that a greedy approach might not work, and we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by considering that for each position i, the minimal required value of b_i is determined by the previous b_{i-1} plus 1, but since b_i must be a multiple of a_i, we can compute the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i >= (prev_b + 1). However, we can also choose to set b_i higher than that, but that would require more moves, so it's better to choose the minimal possible.\n\nWait, but how do we track the minimal moves?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can track the minimal possible value of b_i given the previous constraints, and also track the minimal moves required to reach that point.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet's denote for each i, the minimal possible value of b_i given the constraints from the previous steps, and the minimal moves required to reach that.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe can model the problem by keeping track of the minimal required value for b_i, given the previous b_{i-1}.\n\nSuppose we have processed up to i-1, and the current b_{i-1} is some value. Then, for the i-th element, the minimal moves would be determined by the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}, and the sum of |k_i| is minimized.\n\nBut since the previous b_{i-1} can be any value, this seems difficult. However, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming where the state is the current value of b_{i}, but since the values can be large, this is not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think of the problem in terms of the required constraints between consecutive elements.\n\nSuppose we have the first i elements. Let's denote the current minimal moves up to i, and the minimal possible value of b_i such that the constraints are satisfied. Let's see:\n\nInitialize for the first element:\n\nThe minimal moves for the first element is 0 (k_1 =0, so b_1 =0). The minimal possible value is 0, but perhaps we can choose other values with higher moves but leading to better overall.\n\nWait, but maybe the minimal moves is achieved by choosing the minimal possible k_i's. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the problem in terms of the previous b_{i-1} and the current a_i. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right, and for each step, compute the minimal possible b_i given the previous b_{i-1}, and track the minimal moves.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems (like the one where you have to make an array non-decreasing with minimal cost):\n\nLet me think of the variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote for each position i, the minimal possible value of b_i given the constraints from the previous steps, and the minimal moves required to reach that.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as follows:\n\nWe can represent the constraints as follows. For each i, the value of b_i must be at least (b_{i-1} + 1). But since b_i must be a multiple of a_i (since it's k_i * a_i), the minimal possible b_i is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because the multiple can be negative. For example, if a_i is 3, and the previous b_{i-1} is 5, then the next b_i must be at least 6. The minimal multiple would be 6 (2*3), but maybe a negative multiple could be better? No, because it has to be larger than 5. So the minimal possible is indeed the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}.\n\nWait, but the multiple can be any integer (positive or negative). So the minimal possible b_i is the smallest integer multiple of a_i that is greater than b_{i-1}.\n\nWait, but the minimal moves would be the minimal |k_i| such that k_i * a_i > b_{i-1}.\n\nHmm, so for each step, given the previous b_{i-1}, we can compute the minimal k_i and the corresponding b_i.\n\nBut how do we track this in a way that allows us to choose the best path?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled with dynamic programming where the state is the current value of b_i, but since the values can be large, this is not feasible. So maybe we can find a way to represent the state in terms of the previous value and some other parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem greedily, making the best choice at each step.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's process the array from left to right, and for each position i, compute the minimal possible b_i given the previous b_{i-1}, and track the minimal moves.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_b = 0 (since initially, b_1 can be set to 0 with 0 moves). But wait, maybe we can choose a different value for b_1 to allow for better options later. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first element can be set to any value, but the minimal moves would be |k_1|. So to minimize the total, we need to choose the best possible k_1 such that the subsequent steps can be done with minimal moves.\n\nHmm, this seems too vague. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the first example given in the problem:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output:4.\n\nThe example explanation says that subtract a_1 (so k_1 =-1, b_1 =-1), then add a_3, a_4, a_5 (so k_3=1, k_4=1, k_5=1). The moves are 1 (for k_1) + 1+1+1 = total 4.\n\nWait, but the second element (a_2 is 2) is set to 0 (since k_2 is 0?), so the sequence is -1, 0, 3,4,5. So the second element is 0, which is greater than -1. So that's okay.\n\nHmm, so in this case, the first element was set to -1 (k=-1) to allow the second element to be 0 (k=0) with no moves, which is better than setting the first to 0 and the second to 2 (k=1, moves 1). So the total is better.\n\nSo the choice of previous k's can affect the total moves. So a greedy approach that only looks at the current step may not work.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the problem requires dynamic programming where for each step, we track the minimal moves and the minimal possible value of b_i.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nLet\u2019s denote dp[i] as the minimal total moves required up to the i-th element, and also track the minimal possible value of b_i given that minimal moves.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following variables:\n\nWe can track for each position i, the minimal possible value of b_i such that the constraints are satisfied, and the minimal moves required to reach that value.\n\nLet me try to formalize this:\n\nLet\u2019s denote for each i, the minimal moves up to i is stored in dp[i], and the corresponding b_i value is stored in b_val[i].\n\nWe can compute this as follows:\n\nFor the first element (i=1):\n\nThe minimal moves is 0 (k=0, so b_val[1] =0).\n\nAlternatively, maybe choosing a different k_1 could lead to a better total. But since there's no previous element, the minimal moves is indeed 0.\n\nFor the second element (i=2):\n\nWe need b_2 > b_1 (which is 0). The minimal moves would be the minimal |k_2| such that k_2 * a_2 >0.\n\nThe minimal k_2 is 1 (since a_2 is positive). So b_2 = a_2, moves +=1. So total moves is 1, and b_val[2] =a_2.\n\nBut in the example, the second element was set to 0 (k=0) but that's only possible if the first element was set to -1. So this suggests that the initial approach of setting the first element to 0 may not be optimal.\n\nAh, so the problem is that the first element's choice affects the second. So the DP approach must track the possible b_val[i] and the minimal moves to reach that.\n\nBut since the values can be large, we can't track all possible b_val[i]. So perhaps there's a way to represent the state in terms of the previous value and some other parameters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal moves can be computed by considering the constraints between consecutive elements and adjusting the current k_i based on the previous.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can process the array from left to right, and for each position i, compute the minimal possible k_i given the previous constraints, and track the total moves.\n\nLet me formalize this step by step:\n\nInitialize:\n\nprev_b = 0 (since for the first element, we can choose k_1=0, so b_1=0).\n\ntotal_moves =0.\n\nThen, for each i from 2 to n:\n\nWe need to choose k_i such that k_i * a_i > prev_b.\n\nThe minimal |k_i| is desired.\n\nWe can compute the minimal k_i as follows:\n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > prev_b.\n\nBut k_i can be positive or negative, but since a_i is positive, the minimal |k_i| would be achieved by the smallest possible k_i in absolute terms.\n\nWait, but the minimal k_i can be either positive or negative, but the constraint is that k_i * a_i must be greater than prev_b.\n\nSo let's compute the minimal possible k_i.\n\nLet me denote the required value for b_i as b_i = k_i * a_i.\n\nWe need b_i > prev_b.\n\nSo, the minimal possible b_i is the smallest possible value greater than prev_b, which is the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than prev_b.\n\nWait, but the multiple can be any integer (positive or negative). So the minimal possible b_i is the smallest integer multiple of a_i that is greater than prev_b.\n\nWait, but the minimal |k_i| would correspond to the closest multiple of a_i to prev_b, but just above it.\n\nHmm, let's think of it as follows:\n\nWe need to find the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i > prev_b.\n\nThe minimal |k_i| would be the minimal number of steps to reach such a k_i.\n\nLet me compute the minimal k_i:\n\nLet's compute the minimal k_i such that k_i * a_i > prev_b.\n\nThe minimal k_i can be found by:\n\nk_i_min = ceil( (prev_b + 1) / a_i )\n\nWait, but that's only if a_i is positive, which it is.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose prev_b is 5, a_i is 3. Then the minimal k_i is 2 (since 2*3=6>5). So (5+1)/3 = 2, so ceil(6/3)=2. So that works.\n\nAnother example: prev_b is 4, a_i is 3. (4+1)/3 = 5/3 ~1.666, so ceil is 2. 2*3=6>4. Correct.\n\nAnother case where prev_b is negative. Suppose prev_b is -3, a_i is 2. Then the minimal k_i can be 0 (0*2=0 >-3). So (prev_b +1) is -2, divided by 2 is -1. So ceil(-1) is -1. But k_i =-1 would give -2, which is not greater than -3. Wait, so that approach may not work here.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula is not exactly that.\n\nWait, let's think again. The minimal k_i is the smallest integer such that k_i * a_i > prev_b.\n\nSo solving for k_i:\n\nk_i > prev_b / a_i.\n\nSince a_i is positive, the inequality direction remains the same.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is floor(prev_b / a_i) + 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev_b =5, a_i=3: prev_b/a_i is 1.666..., floor is 1, so 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nprev_b =4, a_i=3: 4/3 is 1.333, floor is 1, so 2. Correct.\n\nprev_b =-3, a_i=2: -3/2 is -1.5, floor is -2. So -2 +1 =-1. Then k_i =-1 gives -2, which is greater than -3? Yes, because -2 is greater than -3. So that works. So the minimal k_i here is -1, which gives a value of -2, which is better (smaller in absolute terms) than k_i=0 (0, which is also acceptable but requires 0 moves. Wait, but k_i can be -1, which gives a value of -2, which is greater than -3, and the move count is |-1|=1, but if we choose k_i=0, the move count is 0. So in this case, the minimal move is 0, but the formula gives k_i=-1, which is worse. So the formula is not correct here.\n\nAh, so the problem is that the minimal k_i in terms of the value (to minimize |k_i|) may not be the one given by floor(prev_b/a_i)+1.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the minimal |k_i| is achieved by the closest integer to (prev_b +1)/a_i, but such that k_i *a_i > prev_b.\n\nWait, let's think of the possible k_i candidates.\n\nWe need to find the minimal |k_i| such that k_i * a_i > prev_b.\n\nLet me denote x = prev_b.\n\nWe need to find the minimal |k| where k * a > x.\n\nLet me consider possible k values.\n\nThe minimal |k| would be the minimal between the ceiling of (x)/a and the floor of (x)/a plus 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal k can be found by considering the two candidates:\n\nk1 = ceil( (x +1)/a )\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x/a, so the minimal k is floor(x/a) +1.\n\nWait, but in the case where x is negative, like x =-3, a=2:\n\nx/a is -1.5, so floor(x/a) is -2. So floor(x/a)+1 is -1. So k_i =-1 gives -2, which is greater than -3. The move count is 1. But choosing k_i=0 gives 0, which is also greater than -3, and move count 0. So the minimal is 0 here. So the formula gives k_i=-1, but the actual minimal is k_i=0.\n\nHmm, so the formula is not correct here. So the problem is that when x is negative, there might be a k_i with smaller absolute value that still satisfies the condition.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal |k| such that k * a_i > prev_b.\n\nLet me think of the possible k values.\n\nThe minimal |k| is achieved when k is as close to zero as possible, but still satisfies the inequality.\n\nSo, the possible candidates are:\n\nk_candidate = floor( (prev_b) / a_i ) +1,\n\nand also check k_candidate-1, etc.?\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the minimal possible k_i.\n\nLet me think of the required inequality:\n\nk_i * a_i > prev_b.\n\nWe can rearrange to:\n\nk_i > prev_b / a_i.\n\nSince a_i is positive, the inequality is straightforward.\n\nThe minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than (prev_b)/a_i.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is floor(prev_b / a_i) +1.\n\nWait, but in the case where prev_b is -3 and a_i is 2:\n\nprev_b/a_i = -1.5 \u2192 floor is -2 \u2192 +1 \u2192 -1. So k_i =-1. But k_i=0 is better (since 0> -3, and |0| is smaller than |-1|).\n\nAh, so the formula gives k_i =-1, but the actual minimal is 0. So the formula is not correct here.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that when prev_b is negative, there's a k_i=0 which may satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nprev_b is -3, a_i is 2. So 0 *2 =0> -3 \u2192 yes. So k_i=0 is acceptable, and has a smaller |k| than -1.\n\nSo the formula's approach is not considering that.\n\nSo the formula is not sufficient. So how do I find the minimal |k_i|?\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal k_i is the one closest to zero that satisfies the inequality.\n\nSo, the possible candidates are the integers around (prev_b)/a_i.\n\nLet me think of the minimal k_i as the integer closest to (prev_b)/a_i, but such that k_i *a_i > prev_b.\n\nWait, let me think of the minimal possible k_i in terms of the minimal |k_i|.\n\nLet me denote x = prev_b.\n\nWe need to find the minimal |k| such that k * a > x.\n\nLet me consider possible k values:\n\nThe minimal possible k is the one where k is as close to zero as possible.\n\nLet me compute the minimal possible k:\n\nLet me compute the minimal k such that k *a >x.\n\nThe minimal k can be either ceil(x/a) or floor(x/a)+1, but perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the minimal possible k as follows:\n\nThe minimal k is the smallest integer greater than x/a.\n\nSo, k_min = floor(x/a) +1.\n\nBut in the case where x is negative, like x =-3, a=2:\n\nx/a =-1.5 \u2192 floor is -2 \u2192 +1 \u2192 -1. But k=0 is better.\n\nAh, so the problem is that when x is negative, there exists a k=0 which may satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, so in that case, when x is negative, the minimal k can be 0 if 0*a_i >x.\n\nWhich is true if x <0.\n\nSo in that case, when x is negative, the minimal k is 0 if 0*a_i >x \u2192 0> x (since x is prev_b, which is the previous b value).\n\nWait, yes. So if prev_b is negative, then choosing k_i=0 gives b_i=0, which is greater than prev_b (since prev_b is negative). So that's acceptable, and the move count is 0, which is better than any other k_i.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal k_i is 0.\n\nSo the formula needs to account for that.\n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i is the minimal between:\n\n- The minimal k_i that is the smallest integer greater than x/a (so floor(x/a)+1), and\n\n- 0, if 0*a_i >x (i.e., 0> x).\n\nWait, but 0*a_i is 0, so 0> x is equivalent to x <0.\n\nSo when x <0, then k_i=0 is a candidate.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is the one between 0 and floor(x/a)+1 which has the minimal |k|.\n\nWait, but in the case where x is negative, like x=-3, a=2:\n\nfloor(x/a) is -2 \u2192 floor(x/a)+1 is -1. So between k=-1 and k=0, the minimal |k| is 0.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is 0.\n\nAnother example: x= -5, a=3.\n\nThen, floor(x/a) is -2 (since -5/3 is -1.666, floor is -2). So floor(x/a)+1 is -1. So k=-1 gives -3, which is greater than -5. The move count is 1. But k=0 gives 0, which is better (move count 0).\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother case where x is positive:\n\nx=5, a=3 \u2192 floor(5/3)=1 \u2192 +1 \u21922. So k=2 gives 6>5. The move count is 2. Alternatively, is there a smaller k?\n\nk=2 is the minimal possible, since 1*3=3 <5. So yes, 2 is the minimal.\n\nAnother case where x=4, a=3 \u2192 floor(4/3)=1 \u2192 +1 \u21922. So k=2 gives 6>4. Alternatively, k=2 is the minimal.\n\nHmm, so the formula floor(x/a)+1 gives the correct k when x is positive, but when x is negative, we can choose 0 if possible.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is the minimal between 0 (if applicable) and the floor(x/a)+1.\n\nWait, but also, there might be other candidates. For example, if x is 1, a=3:\n\nfloor(1/3)=0 \u2192 +1 \u21921. So k=1 gives 3>1. The move count is 1. Alternatively, is there a smaller k? No, since 0 gives 0 which is not greater than 1. So yes, 1 is correct.\n\nAnother case where x=2, a=3:\n\nfloor(2/3)=0 \u2192 +1 \u21921. So k=1 gives 3>2. Correct.\n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i is the minimal between:\n\n- The candidate from the formula (floor(x/a)+1)\n\n- 0 (if 0*a_i >x \u2192 x <0)\n\n- Also, perhaps other candidates like floor(x/a) +0?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose x=3, a=2 \u2192 floor(3/2)=1 \u2192 +1 \u21922. So k=2 gives 4>3. The move count is 2. Alternatively, is there a smaller k? k=2 is the minimal.\n\nAnother case where x=1, a=2 \u2192 floor(1/2)=0 \u2192 +1 \u21921. So k=1 gives 2>1. Correct.\n\nHmm, so the formula works for positive x.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is the minimal between the formula's candidate and 0 (when applicable).\n\nWait, but what about when x is negative but 0 is better?\n\nYes, so the minimal k_i is the one between 0 and the formula's candidate which has the smaller absolute value.\n\nWait, but how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the minimal between:\n\nk_candidate = floor(x/a) +1,\n\nand k_candidate_0 =0 (if 0*a_i >x \u2192 x <0).\n\nWait, but also, perhaps there are other candidates. For example, if x is 1, a=4 \u2192 floor(1/4)=0 \u2192 +1 \u21921. So k=1 gives 4>1. The move count is 1. Alternatively, is there a better k? No.\n\nHmm, so the minimal k_i is the minimal between the formula's candidate and 0 (when applicable).\n\nWait, but how do I choose between them?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nCompute the candidate k1 = floor(x/a) +1.\n\nCompute the candidate k0 =0 (if 0*a_i >x \u2192 x <0).\n\nThen, among all possible candidates (including k0 and k1 and possibly others?), choose the one with minimal |k| that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, but what about other candidates?\n\nFor example, suppose x= -4, a=3.\n\nThen, floor(x/a) is -2 \u2192 +1 \u2192-1. So k1 =-1 \u2192 -3> -4 \u2192 yes. The move count is 1.\n\nk0=0 \u21920> -4 \u2192 yes. move count 0. So better.\n\nAnother case: x= -5, a=2 \u2192 floor(-5/2)= -3 \u2192 +1 \u2192-2. So k1 =-2 \u2192-4> -5 \u2192 yes. move count 2. But k0=0 is better (move count 0).\n\nAnother case where x= -1, a=2 \u2192 floor(-0.5) is -1 \u2192 +1 \u21920. So k1=0 \u21920> -1 \u2192 yes. move count 0. So in this case, the formula gives k1=0, which is the same as k0.\n\nHmm, so in this case, the formula's candidate is 0, which is the same as k0.\n\nSo in this case, the formula's candidate is already the best.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the formula's candidate already includes the case where k=0 when applicable.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWhen x is negative, the formula's candidate is floor(x/a)+1.\n\nLet me compute for x=-3, a=2:\n\nfloor(-3/2) = -2 \u2192 +1 \u2192-1. So k1 is -1. But k0=0 is better.\n\nHmm, so the formula's candidate is not the best here.\n\nSo the formula's candidate is not sufficient. So I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is the one between k_candidate (floor(x/a)+1) and 0 (if applicable) that has the minimal |k| and satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, but how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal k_i is the minimal between the following candidates:\n\n1. The smallest integer greater than x/a (i.e., floor(x/a)+1).\n\n2. 0, if 0*a_i >x (i.e., x <0).\n\n3. Also, perhaps the next lower integer (like floor(x/a)), but that might not satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor x=-3, a=2:\n\nCandidate 1: floor(-3/2)= -2 \u2192 +1 \u2192-1 \u2192 gives -2, which is greater than -3. move count 1.\n\nCandidate 2: 0 \u2192 gives 0, which is better (move count 0).\n\nSo the minimal is candidate 2.\n\nAnother example: x= -5, a=3:\n\nCandidate1: floor(-5/3)= -2 \u2192 +1 \u2192-1 \u2192 gives -3> -5 \u2192 move count 1.\n\nCandidate2:0 \u21920> -5 \u2192 move count 0.\n\nSo candidate2 is better.\n\nAnother example where x= -1, a=2:\n\nCandidate1: floor(-0.5) =-1 \u2192 +1 \u21920 \u2192 move count 0.\n\nCandidate2:0 \u2192 same as candidate1.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother example where x= -4, a=3:\n\nCandidate1: floor(-4/3)= -2 \u2192 +1 \u2192-1 \u2192 gives -3> -4 \u2192 move count 1.\n\nCandidate2:0 \u2192 move count 0.\n\nSo candidate2 is better.\n\nHmm, so whenever x is negative, the candidate2 (0) is better than candidate1 (unless x is very negative?).\n\nWait, what if x is -10, a=3:\n\nCandidate1: floor(-10/3)= -4 \u2192 +1 \u2192-3 \u2192 gives -9> -10 \u2192 move count 3.\n\nCandidate2:0 \u2192 move count 0. So better.\n\nSo in all cases where x is negative, candidate2 (0) is better than candidate1.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is 0 when x is negative.\n\nWait, but what if x is negative but a_i is very small?\n\nWait, let's see x =-1, a_i=1:\n\nThen, candidate1: floor(-1/1) =-1 \u2192 +1 \u21920 \u2192 gives 0> -1 \u2192 move count 0.\n\nCandidate2:0 \u2192 same as candidate1. So same.\n\nAnother case where x is negative but a_i is 1:\n\nx =-2, a_i=1:\n\ncandidate1: floor(-2/1) =-2 \u2192 +1 \u2192-1 \u2192 gives -1> -2 \u2192 move count 1.\n\ncandidate2:0 \u2192 move count 0. So better.\n\nSo in all cases where x is negative, the candidate2 (0) is better than candidate1.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is 0 when x is negative.\n\nWait, but what if x is negative but 0 is not sufficient?\n\nWait, no. Because 0*a_i is 0, which is greater than x (since x is negative). So 0 is always a valid candidate when x is negative.\n\nSo when x is negative, the minimal k_i is 0, because it requires 0 moves and satisfies the condition.\n\nAh! So that's the key.\n\nSo when the previous b_{i-1} is negative, then the current element can be set to 0 (k_i=0) with 0 moves, which is better than any other option.\n\nSo the minimal k_i is 0 in that case.\n\nWait, but what if x is negative but a_i is 0? But the problem states that a_i are positive integers, so a_i can't be zero.\n\nSo, in all cases where the previous b_{i-1} is negative, the minimal k_i is 0, which gives b_i=0, which is greater than the previous value (since previous is negative).\n\nSo that's a big insight.\n\nSo the algorithm can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each step i from 2 to n:\n\nprev_b is the previous b_{i-1}.\n\nif prev_b <0:\n\nthen the minimal k_i is 0 \u2192 b_i =0, move +=0.\n\nelse:\n\nwe need to choose the minimal k_i such that k_i *a_i > prev_b.\n\nIn this case, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than prev_b/a_i.\n\nSo k_i = ceil( (prev_b +1)/a_i )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nprev_b is non-negative.\n\nWe need k_i *a_i > prev_b \u2192 k_i > prev_b/a_i.\n\nThe minimal k_i is floor(prev_b/a_i) +1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the move count is |k_i|.\n\nSo the total moves is accumulated.\n\nBut also, we need to track the current b_i value, which is k_i *a_i.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize prev_b =0, total_moves=0.\n\nfor i from 1 to n-1 (since starting from second element):\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, the first element is i=0 (since arrays are 0-based in Java).\n\nWait, in the code given, the array a is 0-based.\n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nThe code has a loop for i from 0 to t-1 (since a is size t).\n\nWait, the problem is to process the array from first to nth element.\n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nThe code's main loop is for (i=0; i <t; ++i) { ... }\n\nBut the code's current code has a loop for i from 0 to t-1, and inside, a loop for j from i+1 to t-1, but that's probably not correct.\n\nBut the user's code is incomplete, and the task is to fill in the missing parts.\n\nBut let's get back to the algorithm.\n\nThe algorithm steps:\n\nInitialize prev_b =0, total_moves=0.\n\nfor each i from 1 to n-1 (since the first element is index 0):\n\ncurrent a_i is a[i].\n\nprev_b is the previous b value.\n\nif prev_b <0:\n\nthen set current k_i =0 \u2192 b_i =0.\n\ntotal_moves +=0.\n\nprev_b =0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute the minimal k_i such that k_i *a_i > prev_b.\n\nk_i = ceil( (prev_b +1)/a_i )\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nprev_b is the previous b value (non-negative).\n\nWe need k_i *a_i > prev_b \u2192 k_i > prev_b/a_i.\n\nThe minimal k_i is floor(prev_b/a_i) +1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo k_i = (prev_b + a_i) / a_i \u2192 no, wait:\n\nWait, let me compute with example:\n\nprev_b =5, a_i=3 \u2192 5/3 is 1.666 \u2192 floor is 1 \u2192 +1 \u21922 \u2192 2*3=6>5 \u2192 correct.\n\nAnother example: prev_b=4, a_i=3 \u21924/3=1.333 \u2192 floor 1 \u2192 +1 \u21922 \u21926>4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo k_i = floor(prev_b /a_i) +1.\n\nThe move count is k_i (since k_i is positive).\n\nSo total_moves +=k_i.\n\nThen, the new prev_b is k_i *a_i.\n\nWait, but what if there is a smaller k_i with a negative value?\n\nWait, no, because prev_b is non-negative, so k_i must be at least 1 (since 0 would give 0 which is not greater than prev_b).\n\nSo in this case, the minimal k_i is indeed floor(prev_b/a_i)+1.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nprev_b starts at 0.\n\ntotal_moves =0.\n\nfor i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent a_i is a[i].\n\nif prev_b <0:\n\nthen set b_i to 0 \u2192 k_i=0 \u2192 total_moves +=0.\n\nprev_b =0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute k_i = floor(prev_b /a_i) +1.\n\ntotal_moves +=k_i.\n\nprev_b =k_i *a_i.\n\nWait, but what about cases where there is a smaller k_i with a higher absolute value but lower move count?\n\nWait, no, because when prev_b is non-negative, the minimal k_i is the smallest integer greater than prev_b/a_i, which is positive. So the move count is k_i.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nWait, let's test this algorithm with the first example:\n\nExample1:\n\nn=5, a = [1,2,3,4,5].\n\nProcessing:\n\nprev_b starts at 0.\n\ni=1 (a[1]=2):\n\nprev_b is 0 (non-negative).\n\nk_i = floor(0/2)+1 \u21920+1=1 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total is 1.\n\nprev_b becomes 2*1=2.\n\ni=2 (a[2]=3):\n\nprev_b is 2.\n\nk_i = floor(2/3)=0 \u2192 +1 \u21921 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nprev_b becomes 3*1=3.\n\ni=3 (a[3]=4):\n\nprev_b is3.\n\nk_i = floor(3/4)=0 \u2192+1 \u21921 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total 3.\n\nprev_b becomes4*1=4.\n\ni=4 (a[4]=5):\n\nprev_b is4.\n\nk_i = floor(4/5)=0 \u2192+1 \u21921 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total 4.\n\nSo total is 4, which matches the example.\n\nAnother test case: the second example in the problem description.\n\nExample2:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n7\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSample Output:10.\n\nThe example explanation says that the final array is [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3], which requires 10 moves.\n\nLet's see how the algorithm would handle this.\n\nWait, according to the algorithm:\n\nprev_b starts at 0.\n\ni=1 (a[1]=1):\n\nprev_b is 0 \u2192 non-negative.\n\nk_i = floor(0/1)+1 \u21920+1=1 \u2192 move +=1 \u2192 total 1.\n\nprev_b becomes 1*1=1.\n\ni=2 (a[2]=1):\n\nprev_b is1.\n\nk_i = floor(1/1)+1 \u21921+1=2 \u2192 move +=2 \u2192 total 3.\n\nprev_b becomes 2*1=2.\n\ni=3 (a[3]=1):\n\nprev_b is2 \u2192 k_i=2+1=3 \u2192 move +=3 \u2192 total 6.\n\nprev_b=3.\n\ni=4 (a[4]=1):\n\nk_i=3+1=4 \u2192 move +=4 \u2192 total 10.\n\nprev_b=4.\n\ni=5 (a[5]=1):\n\nk_i=4+1=5 \u2192 move +=5 \u2192 total 15.\n\ni=6 (a[6]=1):\n\nk_i=5+1=6 \u2192 move +=6 \u2192 total 21.\n\nBut the example's output is 10. So this approach is not working here.\n\nHmm, so there's a problem here. The algorithm gives 21, but the correct answer is 10.\n\nSo clearly, the algorithm is wrong.\n\nHmm, so what's wrong with the approach?\n\nThe example's optimal solution is to have the array as [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3], which requires:\n\nFor each element:\n\nb_1 =-3 \u2192 k_1 =-3 \u2192 moves 3.\n\nb_2 =-2 \u2192 k_2 =-2 \u2192 moves 2.\n\nb_3 =-1 \u2192 k_3 =-1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nb_4 =0 \u2192 k_4=0 \u2192 moves 0.\n\nb_5=1 \u2192k_5=1 \u2192 moves 1.\n\nb_6=2 \u2192k_6=2 \u2192 moves 2.\n\nb_7=3 \u2192k_7=3 \u2192 moves3.\n\nTotal moves:3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 11?
