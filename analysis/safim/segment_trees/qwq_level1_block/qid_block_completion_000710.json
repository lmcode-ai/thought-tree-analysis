The output should be \"Division X\" where X is 1-4. Hmm, the code provided has a loop for t test cases. Inside the loop, the TODO is where I need to write the code. First, inside the loop, I need to read the rating. So I'll declare an integer variable for the rating and cin it. Then, I need to evaluate which division it is. The order of checks is important here. Since the ranges are exclusive, I should check from the highest division first. Like, if the rating is >=1900, it's division 1. Else, check if it's between 1600 and 1899 for division 2. Then 1400-1599 for 3, and anything below 1400 is division 4. Wait, let me structure the conditions properly. Let's think step by step:\n\nIf rating >=1900 \u2192 Division 1\nElse if rating >=1600 (since it's already not in division 1, so 1600 \u2264 rating \u22641899 \u2192 division 2)\nElse if rating >=1400 \u2192 division3 (because 1400 to 1599)\nElse \u2192 division4 (since less than 1400) Yes, that logic works. So using a series of if-else statements. So code steps:\n\nRead t, then loop t times:\n\nRead rating. Check conditions in order and print the correct division. So inside the loop:\n\nint rating;\ncin >> rating; Then:\n\nif (rating >=1900) {\n    cout << \"Division 1\" << endl;\n} else if (rating >=1600) {\n    cout << \"Division 2\" << endl;\n} else if (rating >=1400) {\n    cout << \"Division 3\" << endl;\n} else {\n    cout << \"Division 4\" << endl;\n}\n\nWait, let me test the sample inputs given in the notes. For example, the sixth test case with 1679: it's in division 2. Since 1679 is >=1600 but less than 1900, so yes. The seventh case 2300 is division1. The first four test cases are all below 1400, so division4. The fifth is 1400 \u2192 division3. That all works with the code. What about edge cases? Like exactly 1399 \u2192 division4. 1400 is division3. 1599 division3. 1600 division2. 1899 division2. 1900 division1.",
