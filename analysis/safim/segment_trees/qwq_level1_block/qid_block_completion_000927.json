Wait, the example's target is BRBBW. The non-W part is BRBB. Let's see the pairs:\n\nBR (okay), RB (okay), BB (problem). Wait, the third and fourth characters are B and B. That's a problem. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the target is BRBBW. Wait, the example's target is \"BRBBW\". Wait, the third and fourth are B and B. That would violate the condition.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two B's are the result of two different stamps that set each to B via different positions. For example, position 2 was set to B by a stamp on 1-2 as BR (so position2 is R?), no. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps my initial approach is wrong, and I need to think of another way. Alternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, setting them to either RB or BR. The order of stamps doesn't matter except for the final state. The final state is the result of all stamps applied, with each cell's color being the last stamp that affected it.",

So the final is R and B. Not helpful. Alternatively, stamp positions 0-1 as BR (B and R), then stamp positions 0-1 again as BR (so B and R again). No change. Hmm, so it's impossible to get two B's adjacent. But the example in the problem's first case has two B's. Wait, the example's target is BRBBW. The fourth character is B. Let me recheck the example's target: The example's target is \"BRBBW\". So the first four characters are B, R, B, B. The third and fourth are B and B. So how is that possible?

Hmm, perhaps my initial approach is wrong, and I need to think of another way. Alternative Idea:\n\nEach stamp can be thought of as toggling the colors of two adjacent cells. Wait, no, because each stamp sets them to either RB or BR, not toggling. So each stamp overwrites the previous colors.",

So the string becomes B R B. That's exactly the target. So yes, it is possible. So the length is 3 (odd), but the code's approach would reject it if it requires even length. So the code's approach is wrong. Therefore, the code's current approach is incorrect, and I need to find the correct condition. Alternative Idea: The non-W segments must be such that the number of R and B are equal? Or their difference is zero? In the example's case, BRBB has B:3, R:1 \u2192 difference 2. Not equal. In the \"BRB\" case, B:2, R:1 \u2192 difference 1. Not equal. Hmm, not sure. Another Idea: The entire non-W sequence must be such that it can be partitioned into pairs of RB or BR. For example, \"BRB\" can be partitioned into BR and RB (overlapping). But the total length must be even? No, because overlapping allows for odd lengths. Wait, the total number of characters must be even? No, because overlapping allows for odd lengths. For example, \"BRB\" has 3 characters, which is odd. The first two form BR, the last two form RB. So overlapping pairs can cover an odd length. Hmm, so the total length can be even or odd?",

So the third character is R, fourth is B. So the third and fourth are R and B \u2192 RB, which is okay. Then the final string would be B B R B W. But the example's target is B R B B W.

At this point, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. The code provided splits the string into parts separated by W's. For each such part (non-W segment), it checks something. The variable b is set to 1 if any of the parts is invalid. The code's current loop is:\n\nfor i in s[:-1].split('W'): Perhaps the code is checking that each non-W segment is empty or has even length. Because each stamp covers two cells. In the example's case, the non-W part is length 4 (even), so it's okay.",

For example, in \"BRB\" (length 3), the first and last are B and B \u2192 same. So that's okay. In the example's case of length 4 (even), first and last are B and B \u2192 same, but that's not required. Hmm, not sure. Another Idea: The entire non-W sequence must be such that the number of R and B are equal or differ by one. For example, in \"BRB\" there are two B and one R \u2192 difference 1. In the example's case, 3 B and 1 R \u2192 difference 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.",

Alternatively, the entire string must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. For example, in \"BRB\", the pairs are BR and RB. So overlapping pairs can form the string. Another example: \"BRBB\" (the example's non-W part). The pairs are BR, RB, BB. Wait, the last pair is BB which is invalid. But the example is valid. So this approach is also wrong. Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Let me think of the problem differently. Each stamp can be applied anywhere, and each application sets two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The final colors are the result of all stamps applied, with the last stamp on each cell determining its color.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Python code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp can be either RB or BR. Each stamp changes both cells to those colors. The key is to find out if the given string can be achieved through any number of such stamps.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves checking some conditions on the string. Let's think about what constraints the stamping imposes. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So, any non-white cell must be part of such a pair. Also, since each stamp can be applied multiple times, maybe overlapping, but the order might matter. Wait, but the problem allows any number of stamps, so perhaps the key is to look for certain patterns that are impossible.\n\nLet me think of the possible cases where the answer is \"NO\". For example, if there's a single R or B not part of a pair? Like if the string has a single R followed by W, that might not be possible. Or maybe sequences that can't be built up step by step.\n\nAnother thought: since each stamp changes two adjacent cells, every non-W must be part of at least one such pair. But how do overlapping stamps affect this?\n\nWait, maybe the key is that any two consecutive non-W cells must form either RB or BR. Because each stamp can only create such a pair. Wait, but when you apply a stamp over existing cells, you can overwrite previous colors. So maybe the problem is more about the parity or some pattern in the string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that all non-W characters must form pairs in such a way that they can be built by overlapping stamps. Let me think of some examples.\n\nTake the example given in the problem: BRBWW. The sequence of stamps can create that. Let's see another example. Suppose the string is \"RWB\". Then, can that be formed? Let's see. The first two characters are RW. To get R, maybe a stamp was applied as BR over positions 0 and 1, but that would make the first cell B and second R. Wait, but the first is R here. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the third character is B. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by looking at the transitions between characters. Let's see:\n\nEach stamp application affects two adjacent cells. So, every time you apply a stamp, you're setting two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. But since you can apply stamps multiple times, the order might allow overwriting. However, the final string must be achievable through some sequence of such operations.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that any two adjacent non-W cells must form either RB or BR. Because if they don't, then there's no way to have those two cells in that configuration. Because each stamp can only create such a pair, and overlapping stamps can change them again. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think of a case where two adjacent non-W cells are not RB or BR. For example, if the string has \"RR\", then that's impossible. Because each stamp can only create either RB or BR. So, two R's next to each other can't be formed. Because any stamp that affects those two would have to set them to either RB or BR, so they can't both be R. So, in that case, the answer would be \"NO\".\n\nSimilarly, if there's a \"BB\" in the string, that's also impossible. Because each stamp can only create RB or BR. So two B's next to each other can't be formed unless they were part of a previous stamp and then overwritten? Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose you have two B's next to each other. How could that happen?\n\nWait, let's see. Suppose you first stamp at positions 0 and 1 as BR, making them B and R. Then, if you stamp again on positions 1 and 2 (assuming there's a third cell), but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to get two B's next to each other?\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let's see. Let's think of a scenario where two B's are adjacent. Let's say the desired string is \"BB\". The initial is \"WW\". To get BB, you need to apply a stamp that would set both to B and R or R and B. Wait, no. Each stamp must set the two cells to either RB or BR. So, the only way to have two B's next to each other is if they were set by overlapping stamps. Wait, maybe not possible. For example, to get \"BB\", you can't do it in one stamp. Let's see:\n\nSuppose you first stamp positions 0 and 1 as BR, so they become B and R. Then, if you stamp again on positions 0 and 1 again, but this time as RB (since the stamp can be rotated), then the first would become R and the second B. So after two stamps on the same positions, you end up with R and B again. So that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe another approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's impossible to have two B's adjacent. So any occurrence of two non-W characters that are not RB or BR would make the answer \"NO\".\n\nWait, but what about a string like \"BRB\"? Let's see. The first two are BR, which is okay. The next two are RB. So that's allowed. So that's possible. So the key is that between any two consecutive non-W characters, they must form either RB or BR. Because otherwise, there's no way to have that pair.\n\nWait, but what about a single non-W character? Like if the string is \"R\" (n=1). Then, since the stamp requires two cells, you can't apply any stamp. So the only possible string for n=1 is all W. So if the input is \"R\" for n=1, the answer is \"NO\".\n\nSo the conditions I can think of are:\n\n1. All non-W characters must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive non-W characters is either RB or BR. Because any two adjacent non-W must have been set by a stamp (or modified by overlapping stamps, but their final state must be a valid pair).\n\nWait, but maybe there are cases where non-consecutive non-W can be in any state, but consecutive non-W must form RB or BR.\n\nWait, let's think of a string like \"RWB\". The middle is W, so the R and B are separated by a W. So their adjacency isn't an issue. So that's okay. But if the string is \"RBR\", then the first two are RB (okay), the next two are BR (okay). So that's allowed.\n\nAnother example: \"BWR\". The B and R are separated by a W, so that's okay. So the only problem is when two non-W are adjacent and not forming RB or BR.\n\nSo the first condition is that any two adjacent non-W must form RB or BR.\n\nAdditionally, the entire string must not have any single non-W that can't be part of a stamp. For example, if the string is \"R\" (n=1), then since you can't apply any stamp, the only possible is all W. So that's a \"NO\".\n\nAnother case: the string is \"RWB\". The first two are R and W. Since W is allowed, but the R is at the end. How was that R formed? It must have been part of a stamp with the next cell. But the next cell is W, so maybe the stamp was applied on positions 0 and 1, setting them to R and B. But then the second character would be B, not W. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, in this case, the first character is R and the second is W. How can that happen?\n\nHmm, maybe this is impossible. Let's see. Let's think of the example \"RW\".\n\nThe desired string is \"RW\". To get the first R, you need a stamp that affects position 0 and 1. Let's say you apply a stamp as BR (so first becomes B, second R). But that would make the first cell B, not R. Alternatively, if you apply the stamp as RB (so first R, second B). Then the first is R, second B. But the desired second is W. So that's not possible. So the string \"RW\" can't be formed. So the presence of a non-W followed by a W may be allowed, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that any non-W must be part of at least one stamp's pair. But if a non-W is at the end, maybe it can be part of a stamp with the previous cell. But if the previous cell is W, then that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W characters must form a sequence where every non-W is part of a pair with its neighbor. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the allowed transitions between characters. Let's consider the entire string and check for any two consecutive characters that are both non-W and not RB or BR. If such a pair exists, then it's impossible.\n\nAdditionally, the entire string must not have any isolated non-W that can't be part of a stamp. For example, a single R in the middle of W's is possible? Let's see.\n\nSuppose the string is \"WRW\". The middle R must have been part of a stamp with either the left or right W. Let's see: To get the R in the middle, you could have applied a stamp on positions 0 and 1 (making them R and B), but then the second character would be B, not W. Alternatively, applying a stamp on positions 1 and 2 (making them R and B), so the second character would be R and third B. But the desired is W in third position. Hmm, so that's not possible. So \"WRW\" would be impossible. So the R in the middle can't be achieved because it's surrounded by W's, so the only way to get it is via a stamp on either side, but that would require the adjacent cell to be B or R, conflicting with the W.\n\nTherefore, any non-W must be part of a pair with an adjacent non-W. Wait, but that's not possible if it's in the middle of W's. So the conclusion is that all non-W must form a contiguous block where each adjacent pair is RB or BR. Also, the entire non-W block must be such that it can be formed by overlapping stamps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-W characters must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR, and the entire sequence must be such that it can be built by overlapping stamps. But how to model that?\n\nAnother angle: Each stamp application can be thought of as adding a pair of R and B in some order. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, the final colors depend on the parity of the number of times each cell was stamped. Wait, maybe that's a better way to think.\n\nEach cell's color is determined by the number of times it was stamped as R, B, or not. Wait, but each stamp affects two cells. Let me think of each cell's color as the result of all the stamps applied over it.\n\nWait, each time a stamp is applied over positions i and i+1, it sets those two cells to either RB or BR. So each application overwrites those two cells. So the order of stamps matters, but perhaps the final state must be achievable through some sequence of such overwrites.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because the final colors depend on the last stamp that affected each cell. For example, if a cell is part of multiple stamps, the last stamp's color determines its final color.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to whether the target string can be formed by a series of such overwrites, where each step overwrites two adjacent cells with either RB or BR.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe there's a pattern that must hold in the target string.\n\nLet me think of the target string. Let's consider all the non-W characters. Since each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to RB or BR, the non-W parts must form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W are either RB or BR. Because any two adjacent non-W must have been set by the last stamp that affected them, which must have been either RB or BR. So the first condition is that between any two consecutive non-W characters, they must form RB or BR.\n\nAdditionally, the entire sequence of non-W must form a chain where this holds. Also, any W's can be in between, but the non-W must form such a chain.\n\nWait, but what about a W between two non-W? For example, the string \"RWB\". The R and B are separated by a W. So their adjacency isn't an issue. But how were they formed? The R must have been part of a stamp with the previous cell (which is W, so maybe that's not possible). Wait, the R is at the start. To get R, it must have been part of a stamp with the next cell (position 1). The stamp on positions 0 and 1 would set them to either RB or BR. But the next cell (position 1) is W in the target. So that's a problem. Because after the stamp, position 1 would be B or R, but in the target it's W. So that's impossible. So the string \"RWB\" can't be formed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the non-W characters must form a contiguous block where each adjacent pair is RB or BR. Because if there's a W between two non-W, then those two can't be part of the same stamp's pair, and their existence would require that they were set by separate stamps, but then the W in between would have to be overwritten back to W, which is not possible because stamps can't set a cell back to W once it's been changed.\n\nWait, because once a cell is set to R or B by a stamp, any subsequent stamp that includes it will overwrite it again. So the only way a cell can be W is if it was never stamped, or if all stamps that affected it were canceled out. But since each stamp overwrites the cell's color, the only way a cell is W is if it was never part of any stamp's pair. Because any stamp that includes it would set it to R or B.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point. So any W in the target must not have been part of any stamp's pair. Because once a cell is part of a stamp, it's set to R or B, and subsequent stamps can change it again, but the final color must be R or B. So if a cell is W in the target, it must have never been part of any stamp's pair. Because otherwise, the last stamp that included it would have set it to R or B.\n\nTherefore, the W's in the target must be in positions that are never covered by any stamp's pair. But the stamps can be applied anywhere, so the only way a W can exist in the target is if it is not part of any pair in the stamps applied. But how can that be?\n\nWait, this is a key insight. Let me rephrase:\n\nFor a cell to end up as W, it must have never been part of any stamp's pair. Because every time a stamp is applied to a pair including that cell, it changes the cell's color to either R or B. So the only way a cell is W is if it was never touched by any stamp.\n\nTherefore, all non-W cells must form a set of positions that are covered by some stamps' pairs, and the W's are the positions not covered by any stamp's pair.\n\nBut how does this help in checking the conditions?\n\nThe non-W cells must form regions where each is part of at least one stamp's pair, and the entire arrangement must be such that the sequence of non-W's can be formed by overlapping pairs of R and B in the required way.\n\nWait, but the non-W regions must form a sequence where every two adjacent non-W are either RB or BR. Because each pair in the non-W regions must have been set by a stamp (the last one affecting them), so their colors must form either RB or BR.\n\nAdditionally, the entire non-W regions must form a single contiguous block? Or can there be multiple separate blocks?\n\nWait, if there are two separate non-W regions separated by W's, then those regions are not connected. But since the stamps can only affect adjacent cells, how can two separate regions be formed? Because the W between them would have to remain W, meaning no stamp was applied over that W. But the regions on either side must be formed by stamps that don't include the W in between. So for example, if you have \"RWB R\", then the first R is part of a stamp pair with the next cell (position 1), but that would set position 1 to B or R, conflicting with the W. So that's impossible. Therefore, the non-W regions must be contiguous. Because otherwise, the separation by W would require that the regions are not connected via any stamps, but the stamps can't jump over the W.\n\nTherefore, the non-W must form a single contiguous block. Because any two non-W regions separated by W can't exist, since the W can't be part of any stamp, so the regions can't be connected via stamps.\n\nSo putting this all together, the conditions for the answer to be \"YES\" are:\n\n1. All non-W characters form a single contiguous block. (i.e., there are no W's between non-W characters except possibly at the ends)\n\n2. Within this contiguous block, every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR.\n\n3. Additionally, the entire block must have even length? Or not? Wait, no. Let's see. For example, the example given in the problem has length 5, and the non-W part is 4 characters (BRBB). Wait, the example's target is BRBBW. The non-W part is BRBB. Let's see the pairs:\n\nBR (okay), RB (okay), BB (problem). Wait, the third and fourth characters are B and B. That's a problem. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the target is BRBBW. Wait, the example's target is \"BRBBW\". Wait, the third and fourth are B and B. That would violate the condition. But according to the problem's note, that example is possible. Wait, this is a contradiction. So my previous reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait, the example in the problem's first test case is:\n\nThe target is BRBBW. Let's look at the non-W part: the first four characters are B R B B. Wait, the first two are B and R (BR, okay). The next two are R and B (RB, okay). Then B and B? Wait, the third and fourth are B and B. That's two B's in a row, which would be invalid according to my previous logic. But the problem says that this is a valid case. So my reasoning must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so I need to re-examine this.\n\nLooking at the example's explanation:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nStart with WWWWW.\n\nFirst stamp at positions 3-4 (0-based?), making them RB. So the string becomes WWWRB.\n\nThen stamp at positions 0-1, making them BR. So the first two are BR, followed by R B W \u2192 so the string is BR R B W. Wait, but the third character is R (from the first stamp's second position?), then the fourth is B. Then the next step is stamping positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would set them to either RB or BR. Wait, the example's third step is stamping positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would require that those two are set to RB or BR. But the third character after the second step is R (from the first stamp's second position?), so after the second step, the string is B R R B W. Then the third step is stamping positions 1-2 (the two R's) as BR, so they become B and R. So the string becomes B B R B W. Wait, but the target is BRBBW. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for overlapping stamps in such a way that two B's can be adjacent. So my previous assumption that consecutive non-W must be RB or BR is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so I need to think differently.\n\nLet me look at the example's target: BRBBW. The non-W part is B R B B. Let's see the pairs:\n\nBetween B and R: BR (okay).\n\nBetween R and B: RB (okay).\n\nBetween B and B: BB. Which is not allowed by my previous logic, but the example is valid. So my previous approach is wrong.\n\nSo what's different here? How can two B's be adjacent?\n\nAh! Because the last pair (B and B) could have been set by a previous stamp, but then overwritten by another stamp. Wait, but the final colors are B and B. How can that happen?\n\nSuppose the first stamp on positions 2-3 (assuming 0-based) sets them to RB. Then another stamp on positions 1-2 (overlapping) sets them to BR. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first stamp is on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters) as RB \u2192 those become R and B.\n\nThen a stamp on positions 1-2 (second and third) as BR \u2192 so position 1 becomes B, position 2 becomes R. So the third character (position 2) is now R, and the fourth (position3) was B from before. Then another stamp on positions 2-3 (third and fourth) as BR \u2192 making them B and R. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two B's were set by two different stamps in such a way that their final colors are both B. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first stamp on positions 0-1 sets them to BR \u2192 B and R.\n\nThen a stamp on positions 1-2 sets them to BR \u2192 R and B. So position 1 becomes B, position 2 becomes R.\n\nThen a stamp on positions 2-3 sets them to BR \u2192 R and B. So position 2 becomes B, position3 becomes R.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different way to achieve the two B's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two B's are the result of overlapping stamps. Let me think of the example's target: the third and fourth characters are B and B. How could that happen?\n\nSuppose the first stamp is on positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 making them R and B.\n\nThen another stamp on positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 so position1 becomes B, position2 becomes R.\n\nThen another stamp on positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 position2 becomes B, position3 becomes R.\n\nWait, that's not getting us to two B's. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first stamp on positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B and R.\n\nThen a stamp on positions 3-4 (but the fourth is W in the target, so that can't be). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two B's are the result of two different stamps that set each to B via different positions. For example, position 2 was set to B by a stamp on 1-2 as BR (so position2 is R?), no. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nPerhaps my initial approach is wrong, and I need to think of another way.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, setting them to either RB or BR. The order of stamps doesn't matter except for the final state. The final state is the result of all stamps applied, with each cell's color being the last stamp that affected it.\n\nTherefore, for each cell, its color must be either R, B, or W (if never stamped). But W can only be if the cell was never part of any stamp's pair.\n\nSo the key is that the non-W cells must form a set of positions covered by some overlapping pairs of stamps, such that their final colors form the target.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to checking whether the target can be formed by such a set of pairs.\n\nLet me think of the target string. Let's consider all the non-W characters. They must form a sequence where each is part of at least one pair (RB or BR) in the stamps, and the final colors are as per the target.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother idea: The non-W characters must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive characters is either RB, BR, or the same (like BB or RR). Wait, but how?\n\nWait, in the example with BRBB, the third and fourth are B and B. How can that happen?\n\nSuppose the last stamp affecting position 2 and 3 was a BR pair. So position2 is B and position3 is R. But then another stamp on positions 3 and 4 (but position4 is W, so that can't be). Alternatively, maybe the last stamp on positions 2-3 was a RB pair, making them R and B. But that would not give two B's.\n\nHmm, perhaps the two B's are the result of overlapping stamps. Let me think of the following steps:\n\nSuppose the target is B B.\n\nTo get this, you can first stamp positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B and R.\n\nThen stamp positions 0-1 again as RB \u2192 R and B. So the final is R and B. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, stamp positions 0-1 as BR (B and R), then stamp positions 0-1 again as BR (so B and R again). No change.\n\nHmm, so it's impossible to get two B's adjacent. But the example in the problem's first case has two B's. Wait, the example's target is BRBBW. The fourth character is B. Let me recheck the example's target:\n\nThe example's target is \"BRBBW\". So the first four characters are B, R, B, B. The third and fourth are B and B. So how is that possible?\n\nWait, maybe the stamps were applied in such a way that the third and fourth were set by different stamps. Let me think of the example's steps as described in the problem:\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nInitial: WWWWW\n\nFirst stamp at positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), making them RB \u2192 so the string becomes WWWRB.\n\nSecond stamp at positions 0-1, making them BR \u2192 so the first two are BR, followed by R B W \u2192 so the string is B R R B W.\n\nWait, the third character here is R (from the first stamp's second position?), then the next step is the third stamp: stamping positions 1-2 (the R and R?), but that would set them to either RB or BR. Let's say they choose BR. Then positions 1 and 2 become B and R. So the string becomes B B R B W. So the third and fourth characters are R and B. Wait, but the target is B followed by B. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which were R and B from the first stamp). Applying a stamp as RB (so R and B \u2192 becomes R and B?), no. Wait, the third step in the example's explanation is:\n\nThe third step is stamping positions 1-2 (the second and third characters, which were R and R after the second step?), so applying a stamp as RB would set them to R and B. So the string becomes B R B B W. Wait, that would give the third character as B and fourth as B? No, the fourth was B from the first stamp. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at the example's explanation again.\n\nThe problem's example says:\n\nThe third step is stamping positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters?), which were R and B (from the second step's result). Applying the stamp as RB (so R and B \u2192 but that would leave them as R and B?), but the example's target has the third as B and fourth as B. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example's steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's third step is stamping positions 2-3 as BR, so the third character (position 2) becomes B and the fourth (position3) becomes R. But that would not give two B's. I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the example's target is BRBBW, and the two B's are allowed because the last stamp on those positions set them to B and B via some overlapping?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the two B's are allowed because they are not adjacent in the stamp's application. Wait, but they are adjacent in the string. So how can they both be B?\n\nHmm, perhaps my initial approach is wrong, and I need to think of another way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nEach stamp can be thought of as toggling the colors of two adjacent cells. Wait, no, because each stamp sets them to either RB or BR, not toggling. So each stamp overwrites the previous colors.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the problem as a graph where each cell's color depends on the stamps applied. But that might be too complex.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the code given:\n\nLooking at the code provided:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nWait, the code is incomplete. The loop for i in s[:-1].split('W') is missing the loop body. The user wants us to fill in the missing parts.\n\nThe code is trying to process each test case's string s. The variable b is initialized to 0, and then for each part in s[:-1].split('W'), which splits the string (excluding the last character?) into parts separated by W's. Then, based on the value of b, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to check that all non-W segments are of even length or something similar.\n\nWait, the code splits the string (excluding the last character?) into parts separated by W. So for example, if the string is \"BRBBW\", then s[:-1] is \"BRBB\", splitting by W gives [\"BRBB\"], since there are no W's in the first four characters. Then, for each part in that list, perhaps checking if the length is even?\n\nWait, the code's logic might be that each non-W segment must have even length. Because each stamp affects two cells, so the length must be even. But in the example's case, the non-W part is length 4 (BRBB), which is even. So that would pass. But what about a segment of length 3? Like \"RBR\" \u2014 that's length 3, which is odd, so it would fail.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem's first case, the non-W part is length 4 (even), so that works. The two B's are allowed because the length is even.\n\nAnother example: \"RWB\" \u2014 the non-W parts are \"R\" and \"B\", each of length 1 (odd), so they would fail. So the code would set b to 1, leading to 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: \"BRB\" \u2014 the non-W part is length 3 (odd), so it would fail. But according to the earlier example where \"BRB\" is allowed? Wait, let's see. \"BRB\" has pairs BR and RB, which are allowed. The length is 3, which is odd. So according to this logic, it would be rejected, but maybe it's possible?\n\nWait, can \"BRB\" be formed?\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with WWW.\n\nStamp positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nThen stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B. So the string becomes B B B? No, wait:\n\nWait, first stamp on 0-1 gives B R W.\n\nThen stamp on 1-2 (positions 1 and 2) as BR \u2192 R becomes B, and W becomes R. So the string becomes B B R. So the third character is R. Not the desired B.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach:\n\nStamp positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, and W becomes B. So the string becomes B R B. That's exactly the target. So the length 3 is possible. But according to the code's logic (split into parts and check even length), it would reject it. So that suggests that the code's approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so the code's current approach is incorrect. Therefore, I need to find the correct condition.\n\nWait, in the \"BRB\" example, the non-W segment is length 3 (odd). But it can be formed. So the even length condition is not necessary.\n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition?\n\nAlternative Idea: The non-W segments must have even length? But the example shows that it can be done with odd length. So that's not it.\n\nWait, in the \"BRB\" example, the non-W is length 3. Let's see the pairs:\n\nThe first two are BR (okay), the next two are RB (okay). So the entire sequence is allowed. So the length can be odd. So the condition is not about even length.\n\nHmm, so what's the correct condition?\n\nLet me think of the non-W segments. Each must form a sequence where every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. Additionally, the entire sequence must be such that it can be formed by overlapping stamps. But how?\n\nWait, the entire sequence must be possible to be built by a series of stamps. Let's think of the sequence as a string of R and B, with no W's. The question is whether this string can be formed by some sequence of stamps.\n\nEach stamp can be thought of as adding a pair of R and B in some order. But since stamps can be applied anywhere, overlapping, the final string must be such that every character is part of at least one pair (except possibly the ends?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the entire string must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. For example, in \"BRB\", the pairs are BR and RB. So overlapping pairs can form the string.\n\nAnother example: \"BRBB\" (the example's non-W part). The pairs are BR, RB, BB. Wait, the last pair is BB which is invalid. But the example is valid. So this approach is also wrong.\n\nHmm, this is getting me stuck. Let me think of the problem differently.\n\nEach stamp can be applied anywhere, and each application sets two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The final colors are the result of all stamps applied, with the last stamp on each cell determining its color.\n\nTherefore, the final string must be such that for every position i (except the first and last?), there exists a way to choose pairs of stamps such that the colors are as desired.\n\nAlternatively, the key is that the entire non-W sequence must be a string that can be formed by a series of overlapping RB/BR pairs. Let's see:\n\nThe non-W sequence must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs, each being RB or BR. For example, \"BRB\" can be written as BR followed by RB (overlapping at the middle R). So that works.\n\nThe example's \"BRBB\" can be written as BR followed by RB followed by BB? No, but the last pair is BB which is invalid. Wait, but how was it formed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"BRBB\" can be formed by the following stamps:\n\nFirst, stamp positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R.\n\nThen stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 R B.\n\nThen stamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B B.\n\nSo the final string is B R B B. The last two are B and B. But how did that happen? The last stamp on positions 2-3 sets them to B and R (if BR) or R and B (if RB). Wait, if the third stamp is applied as BR on positions 2-3, then position2 becomes B and position3 becomes R. So the fourth character would be R. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, I'm really confused. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the allowed strings.\n\nAnother Idea: The entire non-W sequence must be such that it starts with either R or B, and alternates between R and B. But that's not the case in the example's BRBB.\n\nWait, the example's non-W is B R B B. The last two are B and B. So that breaks the alternation.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative Idea inspired by the code's approach:\n\nThe code splits the string (excluding the last character) into parts separated by W. For each such part, it checks something. The variable b is set to 1 if any of the parts is invalid.\n\nThe code's current line is:\n\nfor i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n\nPerhaps the code is checking that each non-W segment (split by W) has even length. Because each stamp covers two cells, so the length must be even. But in the \"BRB\" example, the length is 3 (odd), which would fail, but that example is possible. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is checking that each non-W segment is non-empty and has even length. But again, the example contradicts that.\n\nWait, maybe the code is checking that each non-W segment has even length or length 0. But the example's non-W part is length 4 (even), so that works. The \"BRB\" case would have length 3 (invalid), but it is possible. So that's not the condition.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is checking that each non-W segment is empty or has length 1? No, that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is checking that each non-W segment is of even length, but the example's case has length 4, which is even. The \"BRB\" case has length 3 (odd), which would be rejected, but it is possible. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the code is correct and my analysis of the \"BRB\" case is wrong. Let me re-examine that.\n\nCan \"BRB\" be formed?\n\nLet me try to find a sequence of stamps:\n\nStart with WWW.\n\nStamp positions 0-1 as BR \u2192 B R W.\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R becomes R, W becomes B. So the string becomes B R B. That's exactly the target. So yes, it is possible. So the length is 3 (odd), but the code's approach would reject it if it requires even length. So the code's approach is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the code's current approach is incorrect, and I need to find the correct condition.\n\nAlternative Idea: The non-W segments must be such that the number of R and B are equal? Or their difference is zero?\n\nIn the example's case, BRBB has B:3, R:1 \u2192 difference 2. Not equal.\n\nIn the \"BRB\" case, B:2, R:1 \u2192 difference 1. Not equal.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The entire non-W sequence must be such that it can be partitioned into pairs of RB or BR. For example, \"BRB\" can be partitioned into BR and RB (overlapping). But the total length must be even? No, because overlapping allows for odd lengths.\n\nWait, the total number of characters must be even? No, because overlapping allows for odd lengths. For example, \"BRB\" has 3 characters, which is odd. The first two form BR, the last two form RB. So overlapping pairs can cover an odd length.\n\nHmm, so the total length can be even or odd?\n\nWait, the first example's non-W is length 4 (even), the \"BRB\" is 3 (odd). Both are possible. So the length can be even or odd.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition?\n\nLet me think of the non-W sequence as a string S. For it to be possible, every pair of consecutive characters must be either RB or BR. Because the last stamp that affected those two must have set them to one of those pairs. So the entire sequence must be a series of alternating R and B, but possibly with some overlapping.\n\nWait, that's the key! The entire non-W sequence must be such that every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. Because the last stamp that affected them must have set them to one of those pairs.\n\nIn the example's case of BRBB:\n\nThe sequence is B R B B.\n\nThe pairs are:\n\nB and R \u2192 BR (okay).\n\nR and B \u2192 RB (okay).\n\nB and B \u2192 BB (invalid). So this would violate the condition. But the example says it is possible. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, this suggests that my analysis of the example is wrong. Let me recheck the example's target.\n\nThe example's target is \"BRBBW\". The non-W part is B R B B. The third and fourth characters are B and B. So according to this condition, it should be impossible, but the problem states it is possible. So there must be an error in my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example's target. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem's first example says:\n\nThe final picture is B R B B W. The sequence of stamps is:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp at positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based?), making them RB \u2192 WWWRB.\n\nSecond stamp at positions 0-1 \u2192 BR \u2192 BR R B W.\n\nThird stamp at positions 1-2 \u2192 RB \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B? Or BR?\n\nWait, the third step in the example's explanation is:\n\nThe third step is stamping positions 1-2 (the second and third characters, which were R and R after the second step?), so applying a stamp as RB (R and B) would set them to R and B. So the string becomes B R B B W. So the third and fourth characters are B and B?\n\nWait, the third character (position 2) was R from the second step. After applying the third stamp (positions 1-2) as RB, position1 becomes R, position2 becomes B. So the third character (position2) is B. The fourth character (position3) was B from the first stamp. So the third and fourth are B and B. So the pair is BB, which is invalid according to the condition. But the example says it is possible. So this suggests that my condition is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is very confusing. Perhaps the condition is not that every consecutive pair must be RB or BR, but that the entire sequence can be formed by overlapping pairs of RB or BR.\n\nIn the example's case, the sequence is B R B B. Let's see:\n\nThe first two are BR (okay).\n\nThe next two are RB (positions 1-2: R and B \u2192 RB? No, the second and third are R and B \u2192 RB is okay.\n\nThe third and fourth are B and B \u2192 which is not allowed. So this would violate the condition. But the example says it is possible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the example's target is different. Let me recheck the problem's first example:\n\nThe problem says the example's final picture is B R B B W. The sequence of stamps is:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp at positions 3-4 (assuming 0-based) \u2192 positions 3 and 4 become RB \u2192 so the string is WWWRB.\n\nSecond stamp at positions 0-1 \u2192 BR \u2192 so positions 0 and 1 become B and R \u2192 the string is BR R B W.\n\nThird stamp at positions 2-3 \u2192 RB \u2192 positions 2 and 3 become R and B \u2192 so the string becomes B R R B B? Or wait:\n\nWait, after the second step, the string is B R R B W.\n\nThe third step is stamping positions 1-2 (the second and third characters, which are R and R). Applying a stamp as BR would set them to B and R \u2192 so the string becomes B B R B W. So the third character is R, fourth is B. So the third and fourth are R and B \u2192 RB, which is okay. Then the final string would be B B R B W. But the example's target is B R B B W. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which are R and B from the second step). Applying a stamp as BR would set them to B and R \u2192 so the third character becomes B, fourth becomes R. So the string becomes B R B R W. Not the target.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third stamp is applied as RB on positions 2-3 (R and B \u2192 becomes R and B?), which doesn't change them. So the string remains B R R B W. Then the fourth character is B. So the third and fourth are R and B \u2192 RB, which is okay. So the final string is B R R B W. But the example's target is B R B B W. So I'm not sure.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the example's target has a different sequence of stamps. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the example's steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the entire non-W sequence must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of RB or BR. So for the example's case:\n\nThe sequence is B R B B.\n\nThe first pair is BR (positions 0-1).\n\nThe second pair is RB (positions 1-2).\n\nThe third pair is BB (positions 2-3) \u2192 which is invalid. So this would not be allowed. But the example says it is possible. So there must be a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's target is different. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nThe example's final picture is described as \"B R B B W\". The sequence of stamps is:\n\nInitial \u2192 WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp at positions 3-4 (RB) \u2192 WWWRB.\n\nSecond stamp at positions 0-1 (BR) \u2192 BR R B W.\n\nThird stamp at positions 1-2 (RB) \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B \u2192 the string becomes B B R B W. So the third character is R, fourth is B. So the third and fourth are R and B \u2192 RB, which is okay. The final string is B B R B W. But the example's target is B R B B W. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which are R and B from the second step). Applying a stamp as BR would set them to B and R \u2192 so the third character becomes B, fourth becomes R. So the string becomes B R B R W. Not the target.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Perhaps I should look for another approach.\n\nAnother Idea: The entire non-W sequence must be such that it can be formed by a series of stamps, each of which is either RB or BR, and the sequence is the result of the last stamps applied to each position.\n\nThis means that for each position i (except possibly the first and last), the pair (i, i+1) must be either RB or BR in the final string. Because the last stamp that affected them must have set them to one of those pairs.\n\nTherefore, the entire non-W sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. This is the key condition.\n\nIn the example's case of B R B B:\n\nThe third and fourth characters are B and B \u2192 which is not allowed. So this would mean the example is impossible, but the problem states it is possible. So there's a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that I must have misunderstood the example's target.\n\nWait, perhaps the example's target is B R B B W, but the third and fourth characters are B and B. But according to the condition, this is impossible. So the example must have a different target.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nThe example's sequence of stamps is:\n\nInitial: WWWWW \u2192 after first stamp at positions 3-4 (RB) \u2192 WWWRB.\n\nSecond stamp at positions 0-1 (BR) \u2192 BR R B W.\n\nThird stamp at positions 1-2 (RB) \u2192 so positions 1 and 2 become R and B \u2192 the string becomes B B R B W. So the third character is R, fourth is B. So the third and fourth are R and B \u2192 RB, which is allowed. The final string is B B R B W. But the problem's example says the final is B R B B W. So perhaps there's a mistake in the example's description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the third stamp is applied on positions 2-3 (third and fourth characters, which are R and B from the second step). Applying a stamp as BR would set them to B and R \u2192 so the third character becomes B, fourth becomes R. So the string becomes B R B R W. Not the target.\n\nHmm, I'm really confused now. Perhaps I should proceed with the initial condition that every consecutive pair must be RB or BR, and see if that works for the given example.\n\nIf the example's target is B R B B, then the third and fourth are BB, which would violate the condition, so the answer would be NO. But the problem says it is possible. So this suggests that the condition is not correct.\n\nAlternative Idea: The condition is that the entire non-W sequence must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. For example, the sequence B R B B can be partitioned as B R / R B / B B \u2192 but the last pair is invalid. So it's not possible. But the example says it is possible. So this is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps the example's target is different. Maybe the final string is B R B B W, but the third and fourth are B and B. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the third and fourth were set by a stamp that was applied in a way that their final colors are B and B. For example:\n\nSuppose the first stamp on positions 2-3 sets them to RB \u2192 R and B.\n\nThen a stamp on positions 1-2 sets them to BR \u2192 B and R.\n\nThen a stamp on positions 2-3 sets them to BR \u2192 B and R.\n\nThen a stamp on positions 3-4 (but the fourth is W) can't be done. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third and fourth were set by two different stamps:\n\nStamp 1: positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 R and B.\n\nStamp 2: positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B and R.\n\nBut then the fourth character is R, not B.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nThe code provided splits the string into parts separated by W's. For each such part (non-W segment), it checks something. The variable b is set to 1 if any of the parts is invalid.\n\nThe code's current loop is:\n\nfor i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n\nPerhaps the code is checking that each non-W segment is empty or has even length. Because each stamp covers two cells.\n\nIn the example's case, the non-W part is length 4 (even), so it's okay.\n\nThe \"BRB\" case has length 3 (odd), so it would be rejected, but it is possible. So this suggests the code is wrong.\n\nBut maybe the code is correct and my analysis of the \"BRB\" case is wrong.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the \"BRB\" case:\n\nThe non-W sequence is B R B. The pairs are BR and RB. So the consecutive pairs are valid. So the entire sequence is valid. The length is 3, which is odd. So the code's approach of requiring even length would reject it, but it is possible. So the code is wrong.\n\nTherefore, the correct condition must not require even length.\n\nAlternative Idea: The non-W segments must be such that the length is even or odd, but the first and last characters must be the same if the length is odd?\n\nFor example, in \"BRB\" (length 3), the first and last are B and B \u2192 same. So that's okay.\n\nIn the example's case of length 4 (even), first and last are B and B \u2192 same, but that's not required.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The entire non-W sequence must be such that the number of R and B are equal or differ by one. For example, in \"BRB\" there are two B and one R \u2192 difference 1. In the example's case, 3 B and 1 R \u2192 difference 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the non-W sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. This is the only way the last stamp affecting them could have set them to that pair.\n\nIn the example's case of B R B B:\n\nThe third and fourth are B and B \u2192 which is not allowed. So the example's target is impossible, but the problem says it is possible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding of the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example's target is B R B B W, but the third and fourth are B and B. This would violate the condition, so the example must be incorrect. But that's unlikely.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the condition that every consecutive pair must be RB or BR, and see how to implement that.\n\nThe code provided splits the string into parts separated by W's. For each part (non-W segment), we need to check that every consecutive pair in the segment is RB or BR.\n\nSo the code should loop through each non-W segment, and for each segment, check that every consecutive pair is valid.\n\nIf any segment has an invalid pair, then the answer is NO.\n\nAdditionally, the entire string must have no W's between non-W segments. Because the non-W must form a single contiguous block.\n\nWait, but the code splits the string into parts separated by W's. So if there are multiple non-W segments (split by W), then the answer is NO.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The entire string's non-W parts form a single contiguous block (i.e., the string has no W's between non-W characters except possibly at the ends).\n\n2. Within this block, every consecutive pair is RB or BR.\n\nSo the code should first check that the non-W parts are all in one segment (i.e., the split by W's gives at most one non-empty segment).\n\nThen, for that segment, check that every consecutive pair is RB or BR.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Check that the string has no W's between non-W characters (i.e., the non-W parts are contiguous).\n\n- Check that every consecutive pair in the non-W block is RB or BR.\n\nThe code provided is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThe current loop is iterating over the parts of the string split by W's, but excluding the last character (s[:-1]). Why s[:-1]?\n\nAh, perhaps because the last character could be W, and splitting the entire string would include an empty string if it ends with W. But not sure.\n\nThe code's approach is to split the string (excluding the last character) into parts separated by W. Then, for each part (i), it must check something.\n\nThe variable b is initially 0. If any part is invalid, set b to 1.\n\nThe final print is 'YNEOS'[b::2], which for b=0 gives 'YES', and for b=1 gives 'NO'.\n\nSo the code is trying to check that all the parts (non-W segments) are valid.\n\nThe first condition is that all non-W segments are contiguous. So the split by W's should have at most one non-empty segment.\n\nSo the code should first check that the number of non-empty segments after splitting by W is at most 1.\n\nThen, for that segment, check that every consecutive pair is RB or BR.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Split the string into parts by W's.\n\n- If there are more than one non-empty parts \u2192 answer is NO.\n\n- Else, check the single non-W segment for valid pairs.\n\nSo the code's current approach is missing this first check.\n\nThe current code is using s[:-1].split('W'), which may be a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Check that all non-W characters form a single contiguous block. This can be done by checking that the string split by W's has at most one non-empty segment.\n\n2. For the non-W segment (if any), check that every consecutive pair is RB or BR.\n\n3. Also, if the non-W segment is empty (all W's), then it's valid (answer YES).\n\nSo the code needs to implement these steps.\n\nNow, how to implement this in the given code.\n\nThe current code is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThe first step is to split the string into parts by W's. The code uses s[:-1].split('W'), but why s[:-1]?\n\nPerhaps the s includes a newline character, so s[:-1] removes it. But not sure.\n\nAssuming that the string is properly read, the code should split the entire string by W's.\n\nThe code's current loop is iterating over the parts of the string split by W's (excluding the last character). For each part i:\n\nWe need to check two things:\n\n- The number of non-empty parts must be <=1.\n\n- For the non-empty part, check that every consecutive pair is RB or BR.\n\nSo the code should first count the number of non-empty parts. If it's more than 1 \u2192 set b=1.\n\nThen, for the non-empty part (if any), check the pairs.\n\nSo the code should be modified as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    parts = s.strip().split('W')\n    # count non-empty parts\n    non_empty = [p for p in parts if p]\n    if len(non_empty) > 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        continue\n    if not non_empty:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        continue\n    # now check the single non-empty part\n    valid = True\n    s_part = non_empty[0]\n    for i in range(len(s_part)-1):\n        pair = s_part[i:i+2]\n        if pair not in ('RB', 'BR'):\n            valid = False\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\nBut the original code uses a different structure. The user wants to fill in the missing lines in the given code.\n\nThe given code's structure is:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nSo the code uses a variable b which is set to 1 if any condition is violated.\n\nThe current loop is iterating over the parts of the string (split by W's, excluding the last character). For each part i:\n\nWe need to do the following:\n\nFirst, check that there is at most one non-empty part. So if there are multiple non-empty parts, set b=1.\n\nSecond, for the non-empty part, check that every consecutive pair is valid.\n\nBut how to do this within the given code structure.\n\nThe code's current approach is to loop over each part (i) in the split list. For each part i:\n\n- If the part is non-empty, then check if it has any invalid pairs.\n\n- Also, count the number of non-empty parts. If more than one, set b=1.\n\nSo the code can be modified as follows:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    parts = s[:-1].split('W') # or s.split('W')?\n    # count non-empty parts\n    count = 0\n    for i in parts:\n        if i:\n            count +=1\n    if count >1:\n        b=1\n    else:\n        # check the single non-empty part\n        for i in parts:\n            if i:\n                for j in range(len(i)-1):\n                    pair = i[j:j+2]\n                    if pair not in ('RB', 'BR'):\n                        b=1\n                        break\n                if b:\n                    break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nBut this requires modifying the loop structure. However, the user's code has a for loop over the parts, and the code must be filled in within that loop.\n\nThe original code has:\n\nfor i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n\nInside this loop, for each part i:\n\nWe can do the following:\n\nFirst, count the number of non-empty parts. If any part is non-empty, increment a counter. If the counter exceeds 1, set b=1.\n\nSecond, for each non-empty part, check the pairs.\n\nBut how to do this within the loop.\n\nPerhaps:\n\nInitialize a variable count_non_empty =0\n\nand a variable current_part = ''\n\nThen:\n\nfor i in parts:\n\n    if i:\n\n        count_non_empty +=1\n\n        if count_non_empty >1:\n\n            b=1\n\n            break\n\n        current_part = i\n\n    # else: it's empty, do nothing\n\nAfter the loop, if count_non_empty is 1:\n\n    check the current_part for valid pairs.\n\nBut this requires variables outside the loop.\n\nAlternatively, within the loop:\n\nfor i in parts:\n\n    if i:\n\n        if count_non_empty >=1:\n\n            # more than one non-empty part\n\n            b=1\n\n            break\n\n        count_non_empty +=1\n\n        current_part = i\n\n    # else: pass\n\nThen after the loop, if count_non_empty ==1:\n\n    check the pairs in current_part.\n\nBut this requires variables outside the loop.\n\nThe given code's structure has the loop inside the for loop over the parts. So perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    parts = s[:-1].split('W')\n    count = 0\n    current_part = ''\n    for i in parts:\n        if i:\n            count

current_part[j:j+2]\n            if pair not in ('RB', 'BR'):\n                b=1\n                break\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nThis would work.\n\nBut the original code's loop is for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n\nSo the code must be filled in within that loop.\n\nThe user's code has:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n    for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\nSo inside the loop over the parts (i):\n\nWe can do:\n\ncount_non_empty =0\n\ncurrent_part = ''\n\nfor i in parts:\n\n    if i:\n\n        count_non_empty +=1\n\n        if count_non_empty >1:\n\n            b=1\n\n            break\n\n        current_part = i\n\nBut this requires variables outside the loop.\n\nAlternatively, within the loop:\n\nWe can track the count

requires variables initialized before the loop.\n\nThe code as given has b initialized to 0, but no other variables.\n\nSo perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nfor s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    b=0\n
