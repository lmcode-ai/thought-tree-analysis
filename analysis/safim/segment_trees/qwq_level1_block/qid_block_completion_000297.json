When you remove one of those days, the new maximum is the intersection of the other lines. The code's approach is to compute the new intersection by excluding the day's line. But how exactly does that work? Alternatively, the code's intersection variable represents the line that forms the maximum. Hmm, this is getting too vague. The main missing code in the provided code is the line in the next() function. The other possible missing parts are in the solve() method. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nIn the loop over the events, after processing each event, the code updates prev_multiple += curr.p. Wait, the curr.p is either 1, -2, or 1. Wait, the events are added as: For each rain (x_i, p_i):\n\nli.add(new pr(x-p, 1)); // start of the left slope (x-p is the start of the V's left edge)\nli.add(new pr(x, -2)); // the center point (maybe the peak)\nli.add(new pr(x+p, 1)); // end of the right slope? Wait, the 'p' in the pr for the events are 1, -2, 1. The first event (x-p, 1) is the start of the left edge of the V. The slope here is increasing. The second event (x, -2) is the peak point. The -2 might be to account for the peak's contribution. The third event (x+p, 1) is the end of the right edge. The 'prev_multiple' is the number of overlapping V's contributions. Wait, the 'prev_multiple' is the current number of overlapping V's. Each V contributes +1 to the slope on the left, and -1 on the right.",

But given that the user is asking to complete the code, perhaps the missing parts are just the input reader's next() function. The first missing code is in the next() function's try block. The code should read a new line and split it into tokens. So the missing line is:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); Hence, the next() function should be:\n\nString next() {\n    while (!st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        try { st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n    }\n    return st.nextToken();\n}\n\nThat's the first part.

Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nIn the loop over the events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is initially 0. Wait, the code's initial prev_height is 0, prev_multiple is 0, prev_x is 0. The first event's x is the first event's x. The code adds (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple (which is 0) to prev_height, so prev_height remains 0. Then, if prev_height exceeds m (which it won't initially), it updates the intersection. Then, prev_multiple is updated by adding curr.p. Hmm, this seems correct. The other possible missing part is in the part where the code outputs the binary string. The code currently does:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    pr(1);\n}\npl();\n\nBut the code's current condition for the output is:\n\nif(curr_intersection.x == 2 * rain.x && curr_intersection.p == 2 * rain.p) pr(1);\n\nBut this is likely incorrect. Alternatively, the correct condition is whether the new maximum (curr_intersection.p) is <= m. \n\nHence, the code's condition should be:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); Wait, but why 2*m?

Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines.

Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x.

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code.

Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs.

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum.

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum.

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nThe line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nAnd the condition in solve():\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nTherefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

Hence, the correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nIn the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1); So the user should replace the current condition with this. Therefore, the answer is these two parts. The user's problem requires to output only the missing code. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. If this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. The intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum occurs. The code's initial approach is to track the intersection between all the lines that contribute to the maximum. When you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines.",

The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two lines. But the user's code may have other missing parts. Wait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThe code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to curr.x. The code's initial loop for processing events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple; But this is getting a bit too much. The correct missing code is:\n\nIn the next() function's try block:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); In the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nHence, the correct answer is these two parts. The first missing code is the line in next():\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); The second missing code is the condition in the solve() method's for loop:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the given Java code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each day whether removing that day's rain will prevent a flood. The flood occurs if any position's accumulated rainfall exceeds m. The key is that when we remove a day's rain (set p_i to 0), we need to check if the maximum accumulated rainfall is now \u2264 m.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to use some event-based approach with line sweep. Let me look at the existing code structure.\n\nLooking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThey have a list 'li' which is being filled with events. Each rain day contributes three events: x-p (start?), x (maybe the center?), and x+p (end?). The events are sorted by x. Then they process these events to track the accumulated rainfall.\n\nWait, the code uses a line sweep approach to compute the maximum accumulated rainfall. The 'prev_multiple' variable probably tracks the current number of overlapping rain contributions. The 'prev_height' is the accumulated rainfall up to the current point. \n\nThe 'intersection' part is a bit confusing. The code seems to track some intersection points which might represent the maximum rainfall. The getIntersection function might be finding where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe problem requires for each i, when we remove the i-th day's rain, check if the maximum is \u2264 m. \n\nThe existing code's approach might be to first compute the original maximum and see if it's already over m. Then, for each day, when we remove it, check if the new maximum is within m.\n\nBut how does the current code handle this?\n\nLooking at the code's solve() method:\n\nThey first collect all the events (the three points for each rain). Then they sort them. Then they process each event, updating the accumulated height. Whenever the accumulated height exceeds m, they update the 'intersection' variable. \n\nThe 'intersection' is calculated using getIntersection, which takes two pr objects. The pr class has x and p. The getIntersection function seems to compute some kind of line intersection. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'intersection' is tracking the maximum point. The idea might be that the maximum rainfall is determined by the highest point in the line sweep. The intersection here is tracking the points where the maximum could be, and when you remove a day's rain, you need to see if that day's contribution was part of the maximum.\n\nThe code then, for each day, computes a new intersection by excluding that day's rain. If the new intersection's parameters (x and p) are such that the maximum is now \u2264 m, then it outputs 1, else 0.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure how the current code works. Let me think through the approach again.\n\nThe line sweep approach for each rain's contribution: each rain contributes a V-shaped graph centered at x_i with peak p_i. The total a_j is the sum of all these V's. The maximum a_j is the maximum of all these peaks, but overlapped regions can add up.\n\nThe problem is to find, for each i, whether removing the i-th rain's contribution would reduce the maximum a_j to \u2264 m.\n\nThe current code's approach seems to track the maximum point. The 'intersection' variable might represent the point where the maximum occurs. The getIntersection function is probably combining two constraints to find where the maximum could be.\n\nWait, the initial code's approach might be based on the fact that the maximum a_j is the maximum over all the peaks of the individual V's, but when they overlap, their sum can create a higher peak. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the maximum of all the peaks of the individual V's plus the overlapping contributions. \n\nThe line sweep approach is used to compute the maximum a_j. The code is trying to track the points where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe 'intersection' variable is being updated whenever the accumulated height exceeds m. The getIntersection function is probably finding the point where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe key idea here is that if the original maximum is already \u2264 m, then all days can be removed (so output all 1's). Otherwise, for each day, removing it might lower the maximum below m. \n\nThe code's current approach is to compute the original intersection (the point where the maximum occurs) and then for each day, compute a new intersection by excluding that day's contribution. If the new maximum (from the new intersection) is \u2264 m, then it's okay.\n\nBut how exactly does the code compute this?\n\nLooking at the getIntersection function:\n\npr getIntersection (pr a, pr b) {\n    long tx = Math.max(a.x + a.p, b.x + b.p);\n    long ty = Math.max(a.p - a.x, b.p - b.x);\n    return new pr((tx - ty)/2, (tx + ty)/2);\n}\n\nHmm, the parameters a and b are of type pr, which has x and p. The function returns a new pr. \n\nWait, perhaps the a and b here represent lines. The variables tx and ty are computed as the maximum of (x + p) and (p - x) for each of a and b. Then the new x and p are derived from tx and ty. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each pr represents a line equation. For example, the line for a rain's contribution is a V-shape, which can be represented as two lines: one increasing and one decreasing. The intersection of these lines from different rains would determine the maximum point.\n\nAlternatively, the pr might represent the parameters of a line in a certain form. For instance, the maximum of all the V's can be found by considering the upper envelope of all the lines. The intersection points between these lines would determine where the maximum occurs.\n\nThe code's approach might be to track the maximum possible a_j by finding the point where the maximum occurs. The 'intersection' variable is the point where the maximum is achieved. \n\nWhen you remove a day's rain, you need to recalculate the maximum. The code's current approach is to compute for each day, the intersection after excluding that day's contribution, and see if the maximum at that point is \u2264 m.\n\nWait, in the solve() method, after processing all events, if the intersection is null (meaning the maximum never exceeded m?), then all days can be removed (so output all 1's). \n\nOtherwise, for each day, they compute a new intersection by getting the intersection between the original intersection and a pr representing that day's rain. Wait, no, the code does:\n\ncurr_intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * rain.x, 2 * rain.p));\n\nWait, the new pr here is 2*x and 2*p. Not sure why multiplied by 2. Maybe because of some coordinate system scaling?\n\nHmm, perhaps the pr's x and p are scaled by 2 to avoid fractions. Let me think.\n\nThe getIntersection function's parameters a and b are pr objects. The formula for tx and ty:\n\ntx = max(a.x + a.p, b.x + b.p)\n\nty = max(a.p - a.x, b.p - b.x)\n\nThen the new x is (tx - ty)/2, and the new p is (tx + ty)/2.\n\nWait, solving for x and p such that:\n\nx + p = tx\n\np - x = ty\n\nAdding these equations: 2p = tx + ty \u2192 p = (tx + ty)/2\n\nSubtracting: 2x = tx - ty \u2192 x = (tx - ty)/2\n\nSo the new pr's x and p are the solution to the equations x + p = tx and p - x = ty. \n\nSo the getIntersection function is finding the point (x, p) where the two lines represented by a and b intersect. \n\nEach pr a represents a line equation. Let me see:\n\nSuppose a line is represented as p = (x + a.x) + (a.p - a.x) ?\n\nWait, perhaps each pr represents a line in the form of p = m * (x - x0) + c, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each pr represents a line in the form of p = (something). \n\nAlternatively, each pr could represent a line in the form of y = (x + a.x) + (a.p - a.x) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pr corresponds to a line in the form of y = (a.x + a.p) - |x - a.x|. Wait, that's the shape of a V. The maximum of all these V's would form the upper envelope. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all these V's. The intersection points between the lines forming the envelope are critical points where the maximum could be. \n\nThe code's approach is to track the intersection points where the maximum occurs. The 'intersection' variable is the point where the maximum exceeds m. \n\nWait, in the code's loop over the events, whenever the accumulated height (prev_height) exceeds m, they update the intersection. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'intersection' is tracking the earliest point where the maximum exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal required to prevent the flood. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the problem again.\n\nThe problem requires for each day i, when we remove that day's rain (set p_i to 0), check if the maximum a_j is \u2264 m. \n\nThe straightforward approach would be for each i, simulate removing that day's rain and compute the maximum a_j. But with n up to 2e5, this would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. \n\nHence, the code must use a smarter approach. The line sweep approach is likely the way to go. \n\nThe line sweep approach for the original problem (without any removal) can compute the maximum a_j in O(n log n) time. \n\nThe key idea is that each rain contributes a V-shaped graph. The maximum a_j is the maximum of all the peaks of these V's, but when they overlap, their sum can create a higher peak. \n\nThe line sweep approach processes events (the start and end of each V's slope) and tracks the current maximum. \n\nBut how to handle the removal of a single day's rain?\n\nThe code's current approach seems to track the critical points where the maximum occurs. \n\nThe 'intersection' variable is probably the point where the maximum a_j occurs. \n\nThe code first computes the original maximum's position and value. If the original maximum is already \u2264 m, then all days can be removed (so output all 1's). \n\nOtherwise, for each day i, when we remove it, we need to see if the new maximum (without that day's contribution) is \u2264 m. \n\nThe code's approach is to represent each rain's contribution as a line, and the intersection of these lines gives the maximum point. \n\nWhen you remove a day's rain, you remove its line from the envelope, and the new maximum is the intersection of the remaining lines. \n\nThe getIntersection function is used to compute the intersection between two lines. \n\nThe code's 'intersection' variable is the point where the maximum occurs. \n\nWait, in the code's solve() method, after processing all events, if the intersection is null, that means the maximum never exceeded m, so all days can be removed. \n\nOtherwise, for each day, they compute a new intersection by excluding that day's contribution. \n\nWait, the code does:\n\ncurr_intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * rain.x, 2 * rain.p));\n\nWait, why is the new pr created with 2*x and 2*p? \n\nHmm, perhaps the original intersection is stored in a way that requires scaling. \n\nAlternatively, the pr for each rain is stored as (x, p), but when you remove that rain, you need to subtract its contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using some mathematical representation where each rain's line is represented as a pair (a, b) where the line is y = a*x + b, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the pr's x and p might represent the parameters of the line in a way that allows intersections to be computed. \n\nThe getIntersection function's parameters a and b are two lines, and the function returns their intersection point. \n\nThe code's approach is that the original intersection is the point where the maximum occurs. When you remove a day's rain, you need to compute the new intersection by excluding that day's line. \n\nBut how exactly does that work?\n\nAlternatively, the code might be tracking the maximum possible a_j as the maximum of all the peaks. The intersection here is the point where the maximum is achieved. \n\nThe problem is that when you remove a day's rain, you need to see if that day's contribution was part of the maximum. \n\nThe code's current approach for each day i is to compute the intersection between the original intersection and the line from that day's rain. \n\nWait, perhaps the original intersection is the point where the maximum occurs. When you remove that day's rain, the new maximum is the intersection of all other lines. \n\nBut how does the code compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the code might be using the fact that the maximum is determined by two lines. So, the original maximum is the intersection of two lines. Removing one of them would require finding the new intersection between the remaining lines. \n\nBut this is getting a bit too vague. Let me look at the code's variables again.\n\nThe 'intersection' variable is initially null. Whenever the accumulated height exceeds m, they update the intersection. \n\nWait, the code's loop over the events:\n\nprev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to the current x. \n\nIf prev_height exceeds m, then they update the intersection. \n\nThe 'prev_multiple' is the current number of overlapping rain contributions. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'intersection' is tracking the earliest point where the accumulated rainfall exceeds m. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal required to prevent the flood. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the point where the maximum a_j occurs. \n\nThe key is that the code's current approach is not working, and the user is asking to complete the missing parts. \n\nLooking back at the code provided, the user says that the code has missing lines or blocks to fill in. \n\nThe first missing part is in the next() function:\n\n    String next() {\n        while (!st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n            try { /* TODO: Your code here */} catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n        }\n        return st.nextToken();\n    }\n\nAh, right! The input reader's next() function is missing the code to read a new line when the current token is exhausted. \n\nThe standard way to implement this is to read a new line into the buffer. \n\nSo inside the try block, the code should be:\n\nbr.readLine();\n\nand then split that line into the tokenizer. \n\nWait, the standard approach is:\n\nIn the next() method, when the StringTokenizer has no more tokens, read a new line from the BufferedReader, then set the tokenizer to that line. \n\nSo the code inside the try block should be:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nYes, that's the standard way. \n\nSo the missing code in the next() function is:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nSo that's the first part to fill in. \n\nThe second missing part is in the solve() method's for loop where they process the events. \n\nWait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nIn the loop over the events (for(int i = 0; i < li.size(); i++)), the code has:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple;\n\nWait, but prev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to the previous x. \n\nWait, the line sweep approach works by moving from the previous x to the current x. The distance between them is (curr.x - prev_x). The number of overlapping rain contributions is prev_multiple. So the accumulated rainfall increases by (distance) * (prev_multiple). \n\nBut prev_height is the total accumulated up to that point. Wait, no, perhaps prev_height is the maximum height so far? Or maybe it's the current height at the previous x. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is tracking the maximum height. \n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit unclear. Let me think again. \n\nThe line sweep approach for the maximum a_j:\n\nEach rain contributes a V-shape. The maximum a_j is the maximum of all the peaks of these V's, but when they overlap, their sum can create a higher peak. \n\nThe line sweep approach can track the current maximum by considering the events (start and end of each V's slope). \n\nAlternatively, the code is using a line sweep to track the current number of overlapping rain contributions (prev_multiple) and the accumulated height. \n\nWait, perhaps prev_multiple is the current number of overlapping rain contributions. The 'prev_height' is the current a_j at the previous x. \n\nWait, the code's variables:\n\nprev_height is the accumulated rainfall up to the previous x. \n\nprev_multiple is the number of overlapping rain contributions (i.e., the current slope's contribution). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is tracking the current a_j as the maximum possible. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the maximum a_j. \n\nThe line:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple;\n\nThis line is adding the contribution of the current segment (from prev_x to curr.x) multiplied by the number of overlapping rains (prev_multiple). \n\nWait, but that would be the total rainfall over that interval, but the maximum a_j would be the maximum of all the a_j values along the way. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is not tracking the maximum, but instead, whenever the accumulated height (the current a_j) exceeds m, it records the point where that happens. \n\nWait, the code's logic is:\n\nWhenever the accumulated height (prev_height) exceeds m, they update the intersection. \n\nWait, but how is prev_height computed? \n\nLet me see:\n\nInitially, prev_height is 0, prev_multiple is 0, prev_x is 0. \n\nFor each event in the sorted list:\n\nprev_height is updated by adding (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple. \n\nWait, that's the area under the line, but perhaps the a_j at the current x is prev_height. \n\nWait, no. Let me think step by step. \n\nSuppose we have a segment from x=prev_x to x=curr.x. The number of overlapping rains is prev_multiple. So the a_j increases by prev_multiple per unit distance. \n\nThe a_j at the end of this segment (curr.x) would be prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x)*prev_multiple. \n\nWait, but the code is setting prev_height to this value. \n\nSo prev_height is the a_j at the current x (curr.x). \n\nSo whenever this a_j exceeds m, they record the intersection. \n\nThe intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum a_j exceeds m. \n\nThe code's approach is to find the earliest point where the a_j exceeds m, and track that. \n\nWait, but the code's intersection is being updated each time the a_j exceeds m. \n\nThe getIntersection function is used to compute the intersection between the current intersection and the new point. \n\nHmm, perhaps the intersection is tracking the minimal required to prevent the flood. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the point where the maximum a_j occurs. \n\nThe problem requires that for each day i, when we remove it, the maximum a_j must be \u2264 m. \n\nThe code's approach is to compute for each day i, whether removing it would reduce the maximum a_j below or equal to m. \n\nThe code's current approach is to compute the original intersection (the point where the maximum occurs) and then for each day, compute a new intersection by excluding that day's contribution. \n\nThe key is that the original intersection is the point where the maximum a_j is achieved. \n\nWhen you remove a day's rain, the new maximum is the maximum of all other contributions. \n\nThe code's approach is to compute the new intersection by excluding that day's contribution. \n\nThe getIntersection function is used to compute the intersection between the original intersection and the line from the day's rain. \n\nWait, the code's line for curr_intersection is:\n\ncurr_intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * rain.x, 2 * rain.p));\n\nWait, the new pr here is 2*x and 2*p. \n\nHmm, perhaps the original intersection is stored in a way that requires scaling. \n\nAlternatively, the pr for each rain is stored as (x, p), but when you remove it, you need to subtract its contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using some mathematical representation where each rain's line is represented as (a, b) where the line is y = a*x + b. \n\nAlternatively, the pr's x and p are parameters of the line equations. \n\nThe getIntersection function is taking two lines and returning their intersection point. \n\nThe code's initial intersection is the point where the maximum a_j occurs. \n\nWhen you remove a day's rain, you need to find the new maximum, which is the intersection of all other lines except that day's line. \n\nThe code's approach is to compute the intersection between the original intersection and the line from the day's rain. \n\nWait, perhaps the original intersection is the point where two lines (from two different days) intersect, forming the maximum. \n\nWhen you remove one of those days, the new maximum is the intersection of the other lines. \n\nThe code's approach is to compute the new intersection by excluding the day's line. \n\nBut how exactly does that work?\n\nAlternatively, the code's intersection variable represents the line that forms the maximum. \n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. \n\nThe main missing code in the provided code is the line in the next() function. \n\nThe other possible missing parts are in the solve() method. \n\nWait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nIn the loop over the events, after processing each event, the code updates prev_multiple += curr.p. \n\nWait, the curr.p is either 1, -2, or 1. \n\nWait, the events are added as:\n\nFor each rain (x_i, p_i):\n\nli.add(new pr(x-p, 1)); // start of the left slope (x-p is the start of the V's left edge)\nli.add(new pr(x, -2)); // the center point (maybe the peak)\nli.add(new pr(x+p, 1)); // end of the right slope?\n\nWait, the 'p' in the pr for the events are 1, -2, 1. \n\nThe first event (x-p, 1) is the start of the left edge of the V. The slope here is increasing. \n\nThe second event (x, -2) is the peak point. The -2 might be to account for the peak's contribution. \n\nThe third event (x+p, 1) is the end of the right edge. \n\nThe 'prev_multiple' is the number of overlapping V's contributions. \n\nWait, the 'prev_multiple' is the current number of overlapping V's. \n\nEach V contributes +1 to the slope on the left, and -1 on the right. \n\nWait, the events are:\n\nFor a V centered at x with p:\n\n- At x-p, the slope starts increasing (so the contribution to the current multiple is +1). \n\n- At x, the peak: the contribution here is -2 (because the peak is the point where the slope changes from +1 to -1, so the net change is -2). \n\n- At x+p, the slope ends (contribution is +1 again? Or -1?)\n\nWait, perhaps the events are:\n\nThe left edge (x-p) is the start of the increasing slope (so +1 to the multiple). \n\nThe peak at x is where the slope changes from +1 to -1, so the net change is -2 (because the left slope ends and the right slope starts). \n\nThe right edge (x+p) is the end of the decreasing slope (so -1 to the multiple). \n\nHence, the events are:\n\nAt x-p: +1 (start of left slope)\n\nAt x: -2 (peak: left slope ends, right slope starts)\n\nAt x+p: +1 (end of right slope? Or maybe -1?)\n\nWait, perhaps the right edge is the end of the right slope, so the contribution is -1. \n\nWait, the total contribution for the V is:\n\nThe left slope contributes +1 until x, then the right slope contributes -1 after x. \n\nHence, the events are:\n\nAt x-p: +1 (start of left slope)\n\nAt x: -2 (because the left slope ends (subtract 1) and the right slope starts (add -1?), so net -2)\n\nAt x+p: +1 (end of right slope, so subtract -1 \u2192 add +1?)\n\nHmm, perhaps the events are:\n\nThe left edge (x-p) is the start of the left slope, so the contribution is +1. \n\nThe peak at x is where the slope changes from +1 to -1. So the left slope ends (subtract 1) and the right slope starts (subtract 1 again?), leading to a net of -2. \n\nThe right edge (x+p) is the end of the right slope, so the contribution is +1 (since the slope ends, so subtract -1 \u2192 add +1). \n\nHence, the events are correct. \n\nThe 'prev_multiple' is the current number of overlapping slopes. \n\nThe 'prev_height' is the current a_j at the previous x. \n\nThe code's loop is processing each event, moving from prev_x to curr.x. \n\nThe accumulated a_j increases by (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple. \n\nSo the prev_height is the a_j at curr.x. \n\nIf this exceeds m, then the code updates the intersection. \n\nThe intersection is being tracked as the point where the maximum a_j exceeds m. \n\nThe getIntersection function is used to compute the intersection between two lines. \n\nThe code's final step for each day is to compute whether removing that day's rain would reduce the maximum a_j below or equal to m. \n\nThe code's approach for each day is to compute the new intersection by excluding that day's contribution. \n\nThe new pr for the day is (2 * x_i, 2 * p_i). \n\nWait, why 2*x and 2*p? \n\nPerhaps the parameters are scaled to avoid fractions. \n\nThe getIntersection function takes two pr objects and returns their intersection. \n\nThe code's logic for the output is: if the new intersection's x and p are such that the maximum a_j is now \u2264 m, then output 1. \n\nThe condition in the code is:\n\nif(curr_intersection.x == 2 * rain.x && curr_intersection.p == 2 * rain.p) pr(1);\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. \n\nWait, the code's condition is checking if the new intersection is exactly the parameters of the day's rain. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to see if the new maximum is the day's own peak. \n\nAlternatively, the code's condition is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nWait, the code's current condition is:\n\nif(curr_intersection.x == 2 * rain.x && curr_intersection.p == 2 * rain.p) pr(1);\n\nBut this would only be true if the new intersection is exactly the line from that day's rain. \n\nBut that's probably not the correct condition. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is incorrect here and needs to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute the new maximum's value and see if it's \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum a_j after removing the i-th day's rain is the maximum of all other contributions. \n\nThe code's current approach is to compute the new intersection and then check if the maximum at that point is \u2264 m. \n\nThe maximum a_j at the new intersection's point would be (curr_intersection.x + curr_intersection.p)/2, perhaps? \n\nWait, the getIntersection function returns a pr with x and p. \n\nThe maximum a_j at the intersection point is (x + p)/2? \n\nWait, let me think about the parameters. \n\nSuppose two lines are represented by their parameters (a.x, a.p) and (b.x, b.p). \n\nThe intersection point (x, p) is computed as:\n\nx = (tx - ty)/2 \n\np = (tx + ty)/2 \n\nwhere tx = max(a.x + a.p, b.x + b.p)\n\nty = max(a.p - a.x, b.p - b.x)\n\nThe maximum a_j at the intersection point would be p. \n\nWait, because p is the y-coordinate of the intersection point. \n\nSo the maximum a_j is p. \n\nHence, when we compute the new intersection after removing the i-th day's rain, the maximum a_j is the p value of the new intersection. \n\nHence, the condition should be whether this p is \u2264 m. \n\nBut in the code's current condition, it's checking if the new intersection's x and p are equal to the day's parameters. \n\nThat's probably incorrect. \n\nHence, the code's solve() method has a bug in the condition for outputting 1. \n\nThe correct condition should be whether the new intersection's p (the maximum a_j) is \u2264 m. \n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWait, the original intersection's p is the maximum a_j. \n\nWhen we remove a day's rain, the new intersection's p is the new maximum. \n\nHence, for each day i, after computing curr_intersection, we need to check if curr_intersection.p <= m. \n\nBut how is curr_intersection computed?\n\nThe code currently does:\n\ncurr_intersection = getIntersection(intersection, new pr(2 * rain.x, 2 * rain.p));\n\nWait, the new pr here is the line corresponding to the day's rain. \n\nWait, perhaps the original intersection is the intersection of all lines except the current day's line. \n\nWait, no. The original intersection is the intersection of all lines. \n\nWhen you remove a day's line, the new intersection is the intersection of all lines except that one. \n\nBut how does the code compute that?\n\nThe code's approach is to compute the intersection between the original intersection and the line from the day's rain. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the original intersection is the intersection of two lines that form the maximum. \n\nWhen you remove one of those lines, the new maximum is the intersection of the other lines. \n\nHence, the code's approach is to compute the intersection between the original intersection and the line being removed. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is to compute the maximum a_j after removing the i-th day's rain. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all the peaks of the remaining V's, plus their overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is incorrect and needs to be fixed. \n\nBut given that the user is asking to complete the code, perhaps the missing parts are just the input reader's next() function. \n\nThe first missing code is in the next() function's try block. \n\nThe code should read a new line and split it into tokens. \n\nSo the missing line is:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nHence, the next() function should be:\n\nString next() {\n    while (!st.hasMoreTokens()) {\n        try { st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine()); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }\n    }\n    return st.nextToken();\n}\n\nThat's the first part. \n\nThe second possible missing part is in the solve() method's loop where they process the events. \n\nWait, looking at the code's solve() method:\n\nIn the loop over the events:\n\nprev_height = prev_height + (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple;\n\nBut prev_height is initially 0. \n\nWait, the code's initial prev_height is 0, prev_multiple is 0, prev_x is 0. \n\nThe first event's x is the first event's x. \n\nThe code adds (curr.x - prev_x) * prev_multiple (which is 0) to prev_height, so prev_height remains 0. \n\nThen, if prev_height exceeds m (which it won't initially), it updates the intersection. \n\nThen, prev_multiple is updated by adding curr.p. \n\nHmm, this seems correct. \n\nThe other possible missing part is in the part where the code outputs the binary string. \n\nThe code currently does:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    pr(1);\n}\npl();\n\nBut the code's current condition for the output is:\n\nif(curr_intersection.x == 2 * rain.x && curr_intersection.p == 2 * rain.p) pr(1);\n\nBut this is likely incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, the correct condition is whether the new maximum (curr_intersection.p) is <= m. \n\nHence, the code's condition should be:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nWait, but why 2*m? \n\nBecause the parameters are scaled by 2. \n\nWait, the p in the pr is the maximum a_j. \n\nWait, the getIntersection function returns a pr where p is the y-coordinate (the maximum a_j). \n\nBut since the parameters were scaled by 2 (because the rain's x and p are multiplied by 2?), perhaps the actual maximum is (curr_intersection.p) / 2. \n\nHence, the condition should be (curr_intersection.p) / 2 <= m. \n\nSo the code's condition should be:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nAlternatively, the code's current condition is wrong and needs to be replaced with this. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \n\nThe problem is that the code's current condition is incorrect. \n\nBut the user's problem says to complete the code, so perhaps the missing part is the condition. \n\nLooking at the code's current condition:\n\nif(curr_intersection.x == 2 * rain.x && curr_intersection.p == 2 * rain.p) pr(1);\n\nThis is probably incorrect. \n\nThe correct condition should be whether the new maximum (curr_intersection.p) is <= m. \n\nBut since the parameters are scaled by 2, perhaps the actual maximum is curr_intersection.p / 2. \n\nHence, the condition should be:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nAlternatively, the code's getIntersection function returns the maximum a_j as p. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. \n\nSuppose a rain has x=5 and p=3. \n\nThe V shape is centered at 5, with peak 3. \n\nThe line for this rain's contribution is a V with peak at 5, so the maximum contribution here is 3. \n\nThe parameters for this rain in the pr would be (x=5, p=3). \n\nBut in the code's solve() method, when creating the new pr for the day's rain, it's multiplied by 2: new pr(2*5, 2*3) \u2192 (10,6). \n\nThe getIntersection function would compute the intersection between the original intersection and this line. \n\nThe maximum a_j after removing this rain would be the maximum of all other contributions. \n\nThe code's current condition is checking if the new intersection's x and p are exactly the rain's parameters. \n\nThis is likely incorrect. \n\nHence, the correct condition should be whether the new maximum (curr_intersection.p) is <= 2*m. \n\nBecause the p in the pr is scaled by 2. \n\nHence, the code's condition should be:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nSo the missing code is to replace the current condition with this. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe current code has the condition:\n\nif(curr_intersection.x == 2 * rain.x && curr_intersection.p == 2 * rain.p) pr(1);\n\nThis is incorrect and needs to be replaced with:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr('1');\n\nWait, but how to compute the maximum a_j after removing the day's rain?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the p of the curr_intersection. \n\nHence, the condition should be whether curr_intersection.p <= 2*m. \n\nHence, the code's condition should be:\n\nif (curr_intersection.p <= 2 * m) pr(1);\n\nSo the missing code is to replace the current condition with this. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe current code has the condition as written. So the missing code is to replace that line. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nWait, the user says: \"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. Output the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code.
