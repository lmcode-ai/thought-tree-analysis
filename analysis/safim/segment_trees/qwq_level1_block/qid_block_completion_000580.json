So first, if the counts of a, b, c in s and t are different, then it's impossible. But even if counts are same, the order of a and c must be the same. So for example, if s has a sequence a c a, then t must also have a c a in the same order, but with possibly b's inserted in between. So the steps to check would be:\n\n1. Check if the count of a, b, c in s and t are the same. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Check if the sequence of a's and c's in s and t are the same. That is, if you remove all the b's from both s and t, the resulting strings must be equal. If both conditions are met, then it's possible. Otherwise, no. \n\nWait, but is that sufficient? Let me think of some examples. Take s = \"ab\", t = \"ba\". Then, the a and b can be swapped, so yes. The a and c sequence (after removing b's) would be \"a\" vs \"a\", so that's okay. Another example: s = \"abc\", t = \"bca\". After removing b's, s becomes \"ac\", t becomes \"ca\". So the sequences are different, so it's impossible. Which is correct because you can't swap a and c. Another example: s = \"acb\", t = \"cab\".",

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach. Let me think of the problem in terms of the allowed permutations. The allowed swaps are: \n\n- Swap a and b when they are in \"ab\" order. - Swap b and c when they are in \"bc\" order. These swaps can be done any number of times. So, the a's can be moved to the right through the b's. Each time you have an a followed by a b, you can swap them, moving the a to the right. Similarly, the c's can be moved to the left through the b's. Each time you have a b followed by a c, you can swap them, moving the c to the left.",

No, because the order is b followed by a, which is \"ba\", so you can't swap them. Hmm, so the a's can't swap with each other. So the a's must remain in their original order. Wait, so the a's can only move past the b's, but their relative order must stay the same. Similarly, the c's can move past the b's, but their relative order must stay the same. Ah! That's probably the key. So the sequence of a's and c's must be exactly the same in s and t. \n\nWait, but in the example s = \"acb\", the a comes before c, and in t \"abc\", the a comes before c. So the sequence is same. But the problem is that the c is between a and b, so it can't move past the b. \n\nHmm, so maybe there's another condition. Wait, perhaps the a's and c's must appear in the same order, and also, for each a in s, the number of b's before it in s must be >= the number of b's before it in t. \n\nWait, let me think.

For example, for each a or c in the string, we can note how many b's are before it. Then, for the transformation to be possible, the sequence of a's and c's must be the same, and for each corresponding a or c in s and t, the number of b's before it in s must be >= the number of b's before it in t. \n\nWait, let me think. Suppose in s, an a has k b's before it. In order to move this a to the right, it can pass through those b's. The maximum it can move is to the right of all the b's that are after it. Wait, perhaps the number of b's before the a in s must be >= the number of b's before the a in t. Because to move the a to the right, you can pass through the b's, so the a can be placed after more b's. Wait, for example, if in s, an a has 2 b's before it, then in t, it can have 0, 1, or 2 b's before it. Wait, no. Wait, the a can move to the right through the b's. So the number of b's before the a in s is the initial count. When moving the a to the right, it can pass through the b's that are after it. Wait, perhaps the number of b's before the a in s must be >= the number of b's before the a in t. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose in s, the a is at position 0, with 0 b's before it. In t, the a can be placed after some b's. So the number of b's before it in t can be more than in s. \n\nWait, but how? Wait, the a can move to the right through the b's. Suppose s is \"ab\", so the a has 0 b's before it. In t, the a is after the b, so the a has 1 b before it. This is allowed, because the a can move past the b. So the number of b's before the a in t can be higher than in s. So the condition would be that the number of b's before the a in t must be <= the number of b's before it in s plus the number of b's after it in s. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to process the a's and c's in s and t as follows: For each a in s and t, the a's must appear in the same order, and for each a in s, the number of b's before it in s must be >= the number of b's before it in t. \n\nSimilarly, for each c in s and t, the c's must appear in the same order, and the number of b's after it in s must be >= the number of b's after it in t. \n\nWait, perhaps. Let me think of the example s = \"acb\", t = \"abc\". The a's in s and t are in the same order (only one a). The number of b's before the a in s is 0. In t, the a has 0 b's before it. So that's okay. The c in s has 1 b after it (the b at the end). In t, the c has 1 b before it (the b is before the c). Wait, the number of b's after the c in s is 1. In t, the number of b's after the c is 0. So the number of b's after the c in s (1) must be >= the number in t (0). So that's okay. Hmm, but in this case, the c in t is after the b, so the number of b's before the c in t is 1. Wait, the number of b's before the c in s is 0 (since the c is before the b). In t, the c has 1 b before it. So for the c's, the number of b's before it in t must be <= the number of b's before it in s plus the number of b's after it in s? Not sure. Alternatively, for the c's, the number of b's before it in t must be <= the number of b's before it in s plus the number of b's between the c and the end of the string in s. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the correct way is to model the problem by considering the a's and c's with their positions and the b's.",

Another example: s = \"abc\", t = \"b a c\". The a is at position 0 in s and 1 in t. So 1 >=0 \u2192 okay. The c is at position 2 in s and 2 in t \u2192 okay. So this would be allowed. Another example: s = \"acb\", t = \"cab\". The a is at 0 in s and 1 in t \u2192 okay. The c is at 1 in s and 0 in t \u2192 okay (since 0 <=1). So this would be allowed. Wait, can that be done? s is a c b \u2192 target is c a b. The c is at position 1 in s. To move it to position 0, you need to move it left. The c is between a and b. The c and a are adjacent, but they can't be swapped. Wait, the c is after the a. To move it to the left of the a, you can't. Ah, so this example would also be invalid. Hmm, so the condition is not sufficient. Hmm, so the problem is that the a and c can't swap places. So in the example s = \"acb\", t = \"cab\", the a and c are in different order. So the sequence of a and c is different, so the first condition (same sequence) would reject it. Ah right! So the sequence of a and c must be the same. So the two conditions are: \n\n1. The sequence of a and c must be the same. 2. For each a in s and the corresponding a in t, the position in t must be >= the position in s. \n\n3. For each c in s and the corresponding c in t, the position in t must be <= the position in s. \n\nWait, but how do we track the corresponding a and c? \n\nWe can process the a's and c's in order, and for each a in s's a/c sequence, the corresponding a in t's a/c sequence must have a position in t that is >= the position in s. \n\nSimilarly for c's. So the steps would be: \n\n- Check if the a/c sequences are the same. \n\n- For each character in the a/c sequence (ignoring b's), track their positions in s and t. \n\n- For each a in the sequence, the position in t must be >= the position in s. \n\n- For each c in the sequence, the position in t must be <= the position in s. If all these are true, then YES, else NO. \n\nHmm, let's test this with the example s = \"acb\", t = \"abc\". The a/c sequence is \"ac\" in both. The a in s is at position 0, in t at 0 \u2192 okay. The c in s is at position 1, in t at 2 \u2192 2 >=1? No, but it's a c, so the condition is that the position in t must be <= the position in s. \n\nWait, for c's, the position in t must be <= the position in s. In this case, the c in t is at position 2, which is greater than 1 \u2192 violates the condition. So the answer is NO. Another example: s = \"acb\", t = \"cab\". The a/c sequence is \"ac\" vs \"ca\" \u2192 different, so rejected. Another example: s = \"abc\", t = \"b a c\". The a/c sequence is \"ac\" in both. The a in s is at 0, in t at 1 \u2192 okay. The c in s is at 2, in t at 2 \u2192 okay. So this is allowed. Another example: s = \"b a c\", t = \"a b c\". The a/c sequence is \"ac\" in both.",

So the code needs to implement this. Now, how to implement this efficiently. First, for counting the characters: \n\nWe can use a frequency array for s and t. Then, for the a/c sequences: \n\nWe can create two vectors for s and t. For example, for s: \n\nvector<pair<char, int>> s_list; \n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    if (s[i] == 'a' || s[i] == 'c') { \n\n        s_list.push_back( {s[i], i} ); \n\n    } \n\n} \n\nSimilarly for t. Then, if the lengths of s_list and t_list are different, output NO. Else, compare each element's character. Then, for each pair in s_list and t_list: \n\nfor (int i=0; i < s_list.size(); i++) { \n\n    if (s_list[i].first != t_list[i].first) return NO; \n\n    char c = s_list[i].first; \n\n    int s_pos = s_list[i].second; \n\n    int t_pos = t_list[i].second; \n\n    if (c == 'a' && t_pos < s_pos) \u2192 no \n\n    if (c == 'c' && t_pos > s_pos \u2192 no \n\n} If all pass, then yes. So putting this into code. Now, the code given has a for loop over each character, but the user needs to fill in the code. The current code's for loop is inside the test case loop. But perhaps the code can be restructured.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if string s can be transformed into string t using the allowed moves. The allowed moves are replacing \"ab\" with \"ba\" and \"bc\" with \"cb\". Hmm, let's think about what these operations allow us to do.\n\nFirst, let me understand the operations. The first move swaps 'a' and 'b' but only when they are in the order \"ab\". So replacing \"ab\" with \"ba\" would swap them. Similarly, \"bc\" can be swapped to \"cb\". So these operations allow swapping adjacent 'a' and 'b's, and 'b' and 'c's, but only in certain directions? Wait, no, because each move is replacing an occurrence. Wait, the move is that whenever you have \"ab\", you can turn it into \"ba\", which is a swap. Similarly for \"bc\" to \"cb\". So these swaps can be done any number of times. \n\nWait, but can you do this multiple times? Like, for example, if you have \"aba\", then you can swap the first two to get \"baa\", then maybe swap the next two? Or maybe not. Let me think of the possible transformations.\n\nThe key here is to figure out what permutations of the characters are possible with these operations. Let's see:\n\nThe allowed swaps are between a and b when they are in order ab, and between b and c when in bc. So, the swaps can be done in either direction? Because each time you can choose to swap them. Wait, for example, if you have \"ba\", can you turn it back into \"ab\"? Because the operation is only when you have \"ab\" to turn into \"ba\". So to go back, you can't. So the \"ab\" can be turned into \"ba\", but once it's \"ba\", you can't turn it back unless there's another a or something. Hmm, so maybe the direction matters here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operations allow moving 'a's to the right and 'c's to the left? Or maybe the other way around. Let me think of the possible movement.\n\nWait, let's think of the allowed swaps as a way to permute the characters. Let me see:\n\nThe swap of \"ab\" to \"ba\" allows swapping a and b. Similarly, \"bc\" to \"cb\" allows swapping b and c. So, effectively, the 'b's can be swapped with their neighbors if they are in the right order. But since the swaps can be done multiple times, perhaps the 'a's can move past the 'b's, and 'c's can move past the 'b's as well. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'a's can move to the right past 'b's, and 'c's can move to the left past 'b's. Because each time you have an 'a' followed by a 'b', you can swap them, so the 'a' can move to the right. Similarly, a 'b' followed by a 'c' can be swapped, so the 'c' can move to the left. \n\nWait, but the swaps are only in one direction. For example, if you have \"ab\", you can swap to \"ba\", but once it's \"ba\", you can't swap them back unless there's another a or b in the right order. Wait, no. Because the operation is only allowed when the pair is \"ab\" or \"bc\". So once you have \"ba\", you can't swap them again unless there's another a or b in the right order. Hmm, so maybe the 'a's can move to the right past 'b's, but once they pass, they can't go back. Similarly, 'c's can move left past 'b's but can't go back. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the relative order of 'a's and 'c's can't be changed. Because 'a's can move past 'b's, and 'c's can move past 'b's, but 'a's and 'c's can't directly swap. So the 'a's must be in the same order relative to each other, and 'c's must be in the same order relative to each other. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps the positions of 'a's and 'c's must be in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the order of the characters. Let me think of the transformations allowed:\n\nThe allowed swaps are between a and b (when in ab order) and between b and c (when in bc order). So, the 'b's act as a kind of pivot. \n\nLet me think of the possible permutations. For example, can I arrange the letters such that any a can be moved past any b, and any c can be moved past any b? So, the a's can be moved to the right of b's, and c's can be moved to the left of b's? Or the other way around?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose I have \"abc\". Then, the \"ab\" can be swapped to \"bac\", then the \"bc\" in \"bac\" can be swapped to \"bca\". Alternatively, starting with \"abc\", you can first swap the \"ab\" to get \"bac\", then swap the \"bc\" to get \"bca\". Alternatively, maybe you can also do other things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the a's can be reordered among themselves, and the c's can be reordered among themselves, but the relative order of a's and c's must be preserved? Or maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the critical thing is that the sequence of a's and c's must be the same in s and t, but the b's can be moved around. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the positions of the a's, b's, and c's. Let me think of the following:\n\nThe allowed operations allow swapping a and b when they are in order ab, so effectively, a can \"jump over\" a b to the right. Wait, no, swapping ab to ba would move the a to the right. Wait, the original is a followed by b, so after swapping, it's b followed by a. So the a moves to the right by one position. So each time you can move an a to the right past a b. Similarly, for bc to cb: the c can move to the left past a b. \n\nSo, the a's can move to the right through the b's, and the c's can move to the left through the b's. \n\nTherefore, the a's can be moved past any number of b's to the right, and the c's can be moved past any number of b's to the left. \n\nBut the a's cannot move past c's, and c's cannot move past a's, because there's no operation that allows swapping a and c. \n\nTherefore, the relative order of a's and c's must be the same in s and t. \n\nWait, that's an important point. Because if in s there is an a followed by a c, then in t, that a must still come before the c. Because there's no way to swap them. Similarly, if in s a c comes before an a, then in t the c must still come before the a. \n\nSo the sequence of a's and c's must be exactly the same in s and t, except for the b's which can be moved around. \n\nWait, but the b's can be anywhere between the a's and c's. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to process the strings s and t by ignoring the b's and see if the sequence of a's and c's are the same. \n\nWait, but also, the order of a's and c's must be exactly the same. \n\nSo first, check if the a's and c's in s and t are in the same order. If not, then it's impossible. \n\nAdditionally, the number of each character must be the same. So first, check if the count of a, b, c in s and t are the same. If not, then output NO. \n\nWait, that's a necessary condition. So first, if the counts of a, b, c in s and t are different, then it's impossible. \n\nBut even if counts are same, the order of a and c must be the same. \n\nSo for example, if s has a sequence a c a, then t must also have a c a in the same order, but with possibly b's inserted in between. \n\nSo the steps to check would be:\n\n1. Check if the count of a, b, c in s and t are the same. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Check if the sequence of a's and c's in s and t are the same. That is, if you remove all the b's from both s and t, the resulting strings must be equal. \n\nIf both conditions are met, then it's possible. Otherwise, no. \n\nWait, but is that sufficient? Let me think of some examples. \n\nTake s = \"ab\", t = \"ba\". Then, the a and b can be swapped, so yes. The a and c sequence (after removing b's) would be \"a\" vs \"a\", so that's okay. \n\nAnother example: s = \"abc\", t = \"bca\". \n\nAfter removing b's, s becomes \"ac\", t becomes \"ca\". So the sequences are different, so it's impossible. Which is correct because you can't swap a and c. \n\nAnother example: s = \"acb\", t = \"cab\". \n\ns's a,c sequence is \"ac\", t's is \"ac\". So same. The counts are same. So possible? Let's see. \n\nOriginal s is a c b. To get to c a b. How? \n\nHmm, the a is before c in s. To get c before a in t would require moving the c to the left of a, but since they are separated by a b? Wait, in s, the a is first, then c, then b. To get to c a b, you need to swap the a and c. But there's no way to do that. Because between a and c is nothing. The a and c are adjacent. Since there's no b between them, you can't swap them. So in this case, even though the a and c sequences are the same (ac vs ac?), wait no, in the example I just thought of, s is \"acb\" and t is \"cab\". The a and c sequences after removing b's are \"ac\" and \"ca\", so they are different. So that example would be rejected. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the example. Let me think of another example where the a and c sequences are same but the actual positions can be adjusted via moving through b's. \n\nSuppose s is \"a b c\", and t is \"b a c\". \n\nThe a and c sequence is \"ac\" in both. The counts are same. \n\nIn s, the a is first, then b, then c. To get to \"bac\", which is the t, you can swap the a and b (since \"ab\" can be swapped to \"ba\"), so that gives \"ba c\", which is the desired t. So that works. \n\nAnother example: s is \"a b c b\", t is \"b a c b\". \n\nSame a and c sequence. The a can be moved past the first b, so yes. \n\nAnother test case: s is \"acb\", t is \"abc\". \n\nThe a and c sequence in s is \"ac\", in t it's \"ac\" (since t is a b c, so removing b gives \"ac\"). So the sequences are same. \n\nWait, can we turn \"acb\" into \"abc\"? \n\nOriginal s is a c b. To get to a b c. \n\nHmm, the c is between a and b. To move the c to the right of b? \n\nWait, the c is after a but before b. To move the c past the b? \n\nWait, the c and b are in \"cb\" order. The allowed operation for bc is to swap to cb. Wait, the operation is to replace \"bc\" with \"cb\". Wait, that's the same as swapping them. Wait, \"bc\" becomes \"cb\", so that's a swap. So if you have \"cb\", you can't do anything. Because the operation is only when you have \"bc\". \n\nWait, so in the example s is \"acb\" (a c b). The c and b are in \"cb\" order. So you can't swap them. So the c can't move past the b. \n\nSo in this case, the desired t is \"abc\", which requires moving the c after the b. But since the c is before the b in s, and they form \"cb\", you can't swap them. So this case would not be possible. \n\nWait, but according to the earlier conditions, the a and c sequences are same (ac vs ac), and counts are same. But the answer would be NO here. \n\nHmm, so my previous idea is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so there's a problem here. \n\nWait, in the example s = \"acb\", t = \"abc\". \n\nThe a and c sequence is \"ac\" in both. The counts are same. But the answer is NO. \n\nSo my previous approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong with the approach? \n\nAh, right. The a can only move to the right through b's. So in the example s is a c b. The a is before the c. To get to abc, the c has to move to the right of the b. But the c is between a and b. \n\nWait, the c is between a and b. The c and b are in \"cb\" order, so you can't swap them. So the c can't move past the b. \n\nSo the problem is that the a can move past b's, but the c can move past b's only when they are in bc order. \n\nWait, the c can move left through b's. Because the operation allows swapping bc to cb. So if you have a bc, you can swap to cb, so the c moves left. \n\nWait, the operation for bc is to replace with cb. So, for example, if you have \"b c\", you can swap to \"c b\". So the c moves left. \n\nSo in the example s is \"acb\" (a c b). The c is between a and b. The c and b are in \"cb\" order, so you can't swap them. So the c can't move left. \n\nWait, but the c is already to the left of the b. So in that case, the c can't move further left. \n\nHmm, so in the example s = \"acb\", the c is already before the b, so you can't move it further left. \n\nSo the problem is that the c can only move left through b's when they are in bc pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the string in terms of the order of a's and c's, but also considering their positions relative to the b's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to group the characters into runs of a's, c's, and b's, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that for each a in s, in t, the a must be in a position that is not to the left of any c that was originally to its left. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that in both s and t, the sequence of a's and c's must be the same, and also, for every a in s, the number of c's before it in s must be >= the number of c's before it in t? Or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the a's can be reordered among themselves as long as they are moving through b's, but their relative order must stay the same. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a's can be reordered in any way as long as they are moving through the b's. Wait, but how?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem by considering that the a's can be reordered among themselves, but only in a way that allows moving past b's. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as follows: \n\nThe allowed swaps allow us to permute the a's and b's freely among themselves, and similarly the b's and c's can be permuted freely. But a's and c's cannot be swapped. \n\nWait, no. Because a and b can be swapped when in ab order, so you can move a's to the right through b's. Similarly, you can move b's to the left through a's. \n\nWait, but once an a is to the right of a b, you can't swap them back. So the a's can be moved to the right past any number of b's, but once they are past, they can't go back. \n\nWait, perhaps the a's can be reordered in any order as long as their relative order with respect to the c's is preserved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a's can be arranged in any order among themselves, and the c's can be arranged in any order among themselves, but the a's must come before the c's in the same way as in the original string. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me think of the transformations allowed. \n\nThe operations allow swapping \"ab\" to \"ba\" and \"bc\" to \"cb\". \n\nThese operations can be done any number of times. \n\nSo, for the a's and b's: \n\nEach \"ab\" can be turned into \"ba\", so effectively, the a can move to the right past a b. \n\nSimilarly, each \"ba\" can't be turned back into \"ab\", but if there's another b after, maybe you can do something else. \n\nWait, but if you have \"aba\", you can swap the first two to get \"baa\", but then you can't swap the next two because they are \"aa\". \n\nHmm, so the a's can move to the right through the b's, but once they pass a b, they can't go back. \n\nSimilarly, the c's can move to the left through the b's. \n\nSo, the a's can be moved to the right as far as possible through the b's, and the c's can be moved to the left as far as possible through the b's. \n\nTherefore, the relative order between a's and c's must be the same as in the original string. \n\nWait, that's the key. \n\nBecause an a can never cross a c, and a c can never cross an a. \n\nSo, the sequence of a's and c's must be exactly the same in s and t. \n\nAdditionally, the counts of a, b, c must be the same. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1. Check if the count of a, b, c in s and t are the same. If not, return NO. \n\n2. Check if the sequence of a's and c's (ignoring the b's) in s and t are the same. If not, return NO. \n\nIf both are true, then return YES, else NO. \n\nWait, let's test this with the previous example where s is \"acb\" and t is \"abc\". \n\nThe a and c sequence in s is \"ac\", and in t it's \"ac\" (since t is \"abc\", so removing b gives \"ac\"). So the sequences are same. But according to the example, it's impossible. \n\nWait, but according to this logic, it would return YES, but the actual answer is NO. \n\nHmm, so that's a problem. \n\nWait, what's the actual possibility here. \n\nIn s = \"acb\", the a is first, then c, then b. \n\nThe desired t is \"abc\". \n\nTo get from s to t, we need to move the c to after the b. \n\nBut the c is between a and b. \n\nThe c and b are in \"cb\" order. To swap them, you need \"bc\", but here it's \"cb\", so you can't. \n\nSo the c can't move past the b. \n\nHence, the answer is NO. \n\nBut according to the previous conditions, the a and c sequences are same, so the conditions would say YES. \n\nSo the conditions are insufficient. \n\nHmm, so there's a flaw in the approach. \n\nWhat's wrong here? \n\nAh, right. The a and c sequences are the same, but the positions of the a and c relative to each other and the b's may not allow the transformation. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the a and c sequence, the order must be the same, but also, the a's must not be \"blocked\" by c's in a way that prevents moving. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the a's and c's must appear in the same order, but also, for each a in s, the number of c's before it in s must be >= the number of c's before it in t? Or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a's can be reordered among themselves as long as they are moving through the b's, but their relative order must stay the same. \n\nWait, let's think of the a's and c's as needing to be in the same order. \n\nWait, in the example s is \"acb\", the a comes before c. In t \"abc\", the a comes before c. So the order is same. \n\nBut the problem is that the c is between a and b, so it can't move past the b. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the c is between a and b, but in the target, the c is after the b. \n\nSo the c can't move past the b. \n\nSo the a and c sequence is same, but the actual positions of the c relative to the b's are different. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the c can only move left through the b's. \n\nWait, the c can move left through the b's. Wait, the operation for bc is to swap to cb. So, if you have a b followed by a c, you can swap them to c followed by b. So the c moves left. \n\nWait, in the example s is \"acb\", the c is between a and b. The b is after the c. So the c and b form \"cb\", which can't be swapped. \n\nSo the c can't move left further. \n\nSo in order to get the c after the b, you need to have the c after the b in the original string. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the c's can only move left through the b's, so their positions can't go beyond the left of the b's. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the string by grouping the a's and c's with their positions relative to the b's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to represent each character in s and t as a sequence where the a's and c's are in the same order, and for each a in s, the number of b's to the left of it in s must be >= the number of b's to the left of the corresponding a in t? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the a's can be moved to the right through any number of b's, so their positions can be adjusted as long as they are not blocked by c's. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the allowed permutations. \n\nThe allowed swaps are: \n\n- Swap a and b when they are in \"ab\" order. \n\n- Swap b and c when they are in \"bc\" order. \n\nThese swaps can be done any number of times. \n\nSo, the a's can be moved to the right through the b's. Each time you have an a followed by a b, you can swap them, moving the a to the right. \n\nSimilarly, the c's can be moved to the left through the b's. Each time you have a b followed by a c, you can swap them, moving the c to the left. \n\nTherefore, the a's can be moved as far to the right as possible, and the c's can be moved as far to the left as possible. \n\nBut the a's and c's cannot cross each other. \n\nTherefore, the relative order of a's and c's must be exactly the same in s and t. \n\nAdditionally, the counts of each character must be the same. \n\nWait, but in the example s = \"acb\", t = \"abc\", the a and c are in the same order (a before c), but the c is between a and b. To get to abc, the c has to be after the b, but that requires moving the c past the b, which is not possible. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the c is between a and b, so it can't move past the b. \n\nWait, but in the target, the c is after the b. So the c has to be after the b. \n\nSo in the original s, the c is before the b, so it can't move further left, but to get to the target, it needs to be after the b. \n\nSo that's impossible. \n\nSo the problem is that the c's can only move left through the b's, so their positions can't go beyond the left of the b's. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the c can move left through the b's. Wait, the c can only move left when there is a b to the left of it. \n\nWait, the operation for bc allows swapping to cb. So, if you have a b followed by a c, you can swap them to c followed by b. So the c moves left. \n\nSo in the example s is \"acb\", the c is between a and b. The b is after the c, so the c and b form \"cb\", which can't be swapped. \n\nSo the c can't move left further. \n\nSo the c is stuck between a and b. \n\nSo in order for the c to be after the b in the target, it's impossible. \n\nSo the problem is that the c's can only move left through the b's, so their positions can't go beyond the left of the b's. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the string by considering the positions of a's and c's relative to the b's. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to represent each a and c with their \"rank\" among the b's. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nFor each position in the string, the a's can be moved to the right as long as there are b's after them. Similarly, the c's can be moved to the left as long as there are b's before them. \n\nTherefore, the a's can be placed anywhere to the right of their original position, but only through the b's. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to process the a's and c's in the following way: \n\nThe a's can be reordered among themselves, but their relative order must be preserved. Because you can only move an a past a b, but not past another a. \n\nWait, for example, if you have \"aab\", you can swap the first a and b to get \"aba\", then swap the second a and b to get \"baa\". So the a's can be reordered. \n\nWait, but the a's can be reordered in any order as long as they are moving through the b's. \n\nWait, in \"aab\", the two a's are in order. After moving, they can be in any order? \n\nWait, no. Let's see: \n\nOriginal: a a b \n\nFirst swap the first a and b (since they form \"ab\") to get a b a. \n\nThen, the second a (now at position 2) can be swapped with the b at position 1? No, because the order is b followed by a, which is \"ba\", so you can't swap them. \n\nHmm, so the a's can't swap with each other. \n\nSo the a's must remain in their original order. \n\nWait, so the a's can only move past the b's, but their relative order must stay the same. \n\nSimilarly, the c's can move past the b's, but their relative order must stay the same. \n\nAh! That's probably the key. \n\nSo the sequence of a's and c's must be exactly the same in s and t. \n\nWait, but in the example s = \"acb\", the a comes before c, and in t \"abc\", the a comes before c. So the sequence is same. \n\nBut the problem is that the c is between a and b, so it can't move past the b. \n\nHmm, so maybe there's another condition. \n\nWait, perhaps the a's and c's must appear in the same order, and also, for each a in s, the number of b's before it in s must be >= the number of b's before it in t. \n\nWait, let me think. \n\nSuppose in s, an a has some number of b's before it. To move it to the right, you can pass through those b's. \n\nWait, perhaps the a's can be moved to the right as far as possible, but their positions can't go beyond the current positions of the c's. \n\nAlternatively, the a's can be moved to the right through any number of b's, but their relative order must stay the same. \n\nSimilarly, the c's can be moved to the left through any number of b's, but their relative order must stay the same. \n\nTherefore, the sequence of a's and c's must be exactly the same in s and t. \n\nBut in the example s = \"acb\", the a comes before c, and in t \"abc\", the a comes before c. So the sequence is same. \n\nBut the problem is that the c is between a and b, so it can't move past the b. \n\nHmm, so why is that a problem? \n\nBecause in the target, the c is after the b. \n\nSo the c has to be after the b, but in the original s, the c is before the b. \n\nSo the c can't move past the b. \n\nAh! So the c's can only move to the left through the b's. So their positions can't go beyond the left of the b's. \n\nWait, no. The c can move left through the b's. \n\nWait, the c can move left through the b's. So if there is a b to the left of the c, then the c can move left past it. \n\nWait, in the example s is \"acb\", the c is between a and b. The b is to the right of the c. So the c can't move left further. \n\nSo the c is stuck between a and b. \n\nSo in order for the c to be after the b in the target, it's impossible. \n\nSo the problem is that the c's can only move left through the b's, so their positions can't go beyond the left of the b's. \n\nWait, but the c can move left through the b's. So the c can move to the left of any b that is to the right of it. \n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example where a c can move past a b to the left. \n\nSuppose the string is \"b c\". \n\nThen, the \"bc\" can be swapped to \"cb\". So the c moves left. \n\nSo the c can move left past the b. \n\nSo in the example s = \"acb\", the c is between a and b. The b is to the right of the c. So the c can't move left further. \n\nSo the c is stuck there. \n\nSo in order for the c to be after the b in the target, it's impossible. \n\nSo the problem is that the c's can only move left through the b's, so their positions can't go beyond the left of the b's. \n\nWait, but in the example s = \"acb\", the c is between a and b. The b is to the right of the c. So the c can't move left further. \n\nSo the c can't move to the right of the b. \n\nSo the problem is that the c's can only move left through the b's, so their positions can't go to the right of the b's. \n\nWait, no. The c can move left through the b's, but can't move to the right of the b's. \n\nWait, the c can only move left through the b's. So the c can only move to the left of the b's. \n\nWait, the c can move left through the b's, so the c can be placed anywhere to the left of the b's. \n\nWait, in the example s = \"acb\", the c is between a and b. The b is to the right of the c. So the c can't move further left. \n\nSo the c can't move to the right of the b. \n\nHmm, so the c can only move to the left of the b's. \n\nSo the c's can't move to the right of the b's. \n\nSo in order for the c to be after the b in the target, it's impossible. \n\nSo the problem is that the c's can only be placed to the left of the b's. \n\nWait, but in the target \"abc\", the c is after the b. \n\nSo the c is to the right of the b. \n\nSo that's impossible. \n\nTherefore, the correct conditions are: \n\n1. The count of a, b, c must be the same in s and t. \n\n2. The sequence of a's and c's must be the same in s and t. \n\n3. Additionally, for every c in t, all the c's in s must be in positions that are not to the right of any b in s. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to process the a's and c's in the following way: \n\nThe a's can be moved to the right through any number of b's, so their positions can be anywhere to the right of their original positions, but they can't cross c's. \n\nThe c's can be moved to the left through any number of b's, so their positions can be anywhere to the left of their original positions, but they can't cross a's. \n\nTherefore, the a's must appear in the same order as in s, but can be shifted to the right through b's. \n\nThe c's must appear in the same order as in s, but can be shifted to the left through b's. \n\nTherefore, in the target string t, the a's and c's must appear in the same order as in s, and for each a in t, it must be in a position that is >= the position of the corresponding a in s (since they can move right). \n\nWait, but the a's can move right through b's, so their positions can be anywhere to the right of their original positions. \n\nSimilarly, the c's can move left through b's, so their positions can be anywhere to the left of their original positions. \n\nTherefore, in the target string t, the a's must appear in the same order as in s, and each a must be in a position >= the corresponding a's position in s. \n\nWait, but this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to represent the a's and c's with their positions relative to the b's. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nFor both s and t, we can process the string and create a list of the a's and c's along with the number of b's before them. \n\nFor example, for each a or c in the string, we can note how many b's are before it. \n\nThen, for the transformation to be possible, the sequence of a's and c's must be the same, and for each corresponding a or c in s and t, the number of b's before it in s must be >= the number of b's before it in t. \n\nWait, let me think. \n\nSuppose in s, an a has k b's before it. \n\nIn order to move this a to the right, it can pass through those b's. \n\nThe maximum it can move is to the right of all the b's that are after it. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of b's before the a in s must be >= the number of b's before the a in t. \n\nBecause to move the a to the right, you can pass through the b's, so the a can be placed after more b's. \n\nWait, for example, if in s, an a has 2 b's before it, then in t, it can have 0, 1, or 2 b's before it. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the a can move to the right through the b's. So the number of b's before the a in s is the initial count. \n\nWhen moving the a to the right, it can pass through the b's that are after it. \n\nWait, perhaps the number of b's before the a in s must be >= the number of b's before the a in t. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose in s, the a is at position 0, with 0 b's before it. \n\nIn t, the a can be placed after some b's. \n\nSo the number of b's before it in t can be more than in s. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nWait, the a can move to the right through the b's. \n\nSuppose s is \"ab\", so the a has 0 b's before it. \n\nIn t, the a is after the b, so the a has 1 b before it. \n\nThis is allowed, because the a can move past the b. \n\nSo the number of b's before the a in t can be higher than in s. \n\nSo the condition would be that the number of b's before the a in t must be <= the number of b's before it in s plus the number of b's after it in s. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to process the a's and c's in s and t as follows: \n\nFor each a in s and t, the a's must appear in the same order, and for each a in s, the number of b's before it in s must be >= the number of b's before it in t. \n\nSimilarly, for each c in s and t, the c's must appear in the same order, and the number of b's after it in s must be >= the number of b's after it in t. \n\nWait, perhaps. \n\nLet me think of the example s = \"acb\", t = \"abc\". \n\nThe a's in s and t are in the same order (only one a). \n\nThe number of b's before the a in s is 0. In t, the a has 0 b's before it. So that's okay. \n\nThe c in s has 1 b after it (the b at the end). \n\nIn t, the c has 1 b before it (the b is before the c). \n\nWait, the number of b's after the c in s is 1. \n\nIn t, the number of b's after the c is 0. \n\nSo the number of b's after the c in s (1) must be >= the number in t (0). \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nHmm, but in this case, the c in t is after the b, so the number of b's before the c in t is 1. \n\nWait, the number of b's before the c in s is 0 (since the c is before the b). \n\nIn t, the c has 1 b before it. \n\nSo for the c's, the number of b's before it in t must be <= the number of b's before it in s plus the number of b's after it in s? \n\nNot sure. \n\nAlternatively, for the c's, the number of b's before it in t must be <= the number of b's before it in s plus the number of b's between the c and the end of the string in s. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to model the problem by considering the a's and c's with their positions and the b's. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nThe key idea is that the a's can be moved to the right through any number of b's, so their relative order must be preserved, but they can be placed anywhere to the right of their original positions. \n\nSimilarly, the c's can be moved to the left through any number of b's, so their relative order must be preserved, but they can be placed anywhere to the left of their original positions. \n\nTherefore, for the transformation to be possible, the sequence of a's and c's must be the same in s and t. \n\nAdditionally, for each a in s and the corresponding a in t, the position of the a in t must be >= the position of the a in s. \n\nWait, no, because the a can move to the right. \n\nWait, the a can move to the right, so the position in t can be to the right of the original position. \n\nBut the a can't move to the left. \n\nSimilarly, the c can move to the left, so the position in t can be to the left of the original position. \n\nTherefore, for each a in s and the corresponding a in t, the position of the a in t must be >= the position of the a in s. \n\nFor each c in s and the corresponding c in t, the position of the c in t must be <= the position of the c in s. \n\nWait, this might be the key. \n\nLet me test this with the example s = \"acb\", t = \"abc\". \n\nThe a is at position 0 in s and 0 in t. So okay. \n\nThe c is at position 1 in s and position 2 in t. \n\nBut according to this condition, the c's position in t must be <= its position in s. \n\nBut in this case, it's 2 > 1, so it's invalid. \n\nSo the condition would reject this case, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: s = \"abc\", t = \"b a c\". \n\nThe a is at position 0 in s and 1 in t. So 1 >=0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe c is at position 2 in s and 2 in t \u2192 okay. \n\nSo this would be allowed. \n\nAnother example: s = \"acb\", t = \"cab\". \n\nThe a is at 0 in s and 1 in t \u2192 okay. \n\nThe c is at 1 in s and 0 in t \u2192 okay (since 0 <=1). \n\nSo this would be allowed. \n\nWait, can that be done? \n\ns is a c b \u2192 target is c a b. \n\nThe c is at position 1 in s. To move it to position 0, you need to move it left. \n\nThe c is between a and b. \n\nThe c and a are adjacent, but they can't be swapped. \n\nWait, the c is after the a. To move it to the left of the a, you can't. \n\nAh, so this example would also be invalid. \n\nHmm, so the condition is not sufficient. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the a and c can't swap places. \n\nSo in the example s = \"acb\", t = \"cab\", the a and c are in different order. \n\nSo the sequence of a and c is different, so the first condition (same sequence) would reject it. \n\nAh right! So the sequence of a and c must be the same. \n\nSo the two conditions are: \n\n1. The sequence of a and c must be the same. \n\n2. For each a in s and the corresponding a in t, the position in t must be >= the position in s. \n\n3. For each c in s and the corresponding c in t, the position in t must be <= the position in s. \n\nWait, but how do we track the corresponding a and c? \n\nWe can process the a's and c's in order, and for each a in s's a/c sequence, the corresponding a in t's a/c sequence must have a position in t that is >= the position in s. \n\nSimilarly for c's. \n\nSo the steps would be: \n\n- Check if the a/c sequences are the same. \n\n- For each character in the a/c sequence (ignoring b's), track their positions in s and t. \n\n- For each a in the sequence, the position in t must be >= the position in s. \n\n- For each c in the sequence, the position in t must be <= the position in s. \n\nIf all these are true, then YES, else NO. \n\nHmm, let's test this with the example s = \"acb\", t = \"abc\". \n\nThe a/c sequence is \"ac\" in both. \n\nThe a in s is at position 0, in t at 0 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe c in s is at position 1, in t at 2 \u2192 2 >=1? No, but it's a c, so the condition is that the position in t must be <= the position in s. \n\nWait, for c's, the position in t must be <= the position in s. \n\nIn this case, the c in t is at position 2, which is greater than 1 \u2192 violates the condition. So the answer is NO. \n\nAnother example: s = \"acb\", t = \"cab\". \n\nThe a/c sequence is \"ac\" vs \"ca\" \u2192 different, so rejected. \n\nAnother example: s = \"abc\", t = \"b a c\". \n\nThe a/c sequence is \"ac\" in both. \n\nThe a in s is at 0, in t at 1 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe c in s is at 2, in t at 2 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo this is allowed. \n\nAnother example: s = \"b a c\", t = \"a b c\". \n\nThe a/c sequence is \"ac\" in both. \n\nThe a in s is at position 1, in t at 0 \u2192 which is less than 1 \u2192 violates the a's condition. \n\nSo this would be rejected. \n\nBut can we do that? \n\ns is \"bac\". To get to \"abc\", the a is at position 1 in s. To move it to position 0, you need to swap with the b. \n\nThe first two characters are \"ba\", which can't be swapped. So it's impossible. \n\nSo the condition correctly rejects it. \n\nAnother example: s = \"a b c\", t = \"a c b\". \n\nThe a/c sequence is \"ac\" in both. \n\nThe a is at 0 in both \u2192 okay. \n\nThe c is at 2 in s and 1 in t \u2192 1 <=2 \u2192 okay. \n\nSo the condition would allow it. \n\nBut can we do that? \n\ns is \"a b c\". To get to \"a c b\", we need to swap the b and c. \n\nThe bc can be swapped to cb. So yes, possible. \n\nSo the condition works here. \n\nHmm, this seems promising. \n\nSo the steps are: \n\n1. Check if the count of a, b, c in s and t are the same. \n\n2. Check if the sequence of a and c (ignoring b's) is the same in s and t. \n\n3. For each a in the a/c sequence of s and t, the position in t must be >= the position in s. \n\n4. For each c in the a/c sequence of s and t, the position in t must be <= the position in s. \n\nIf all these are true, then output YES, else NO. \n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently? \n\nFirst, for each test case: \n\n- Read s and t. \n\n- Check if the counts of a, b, c are the same. \n\n- Then, process the a/c sequences for both s and t. \n\n- If the sequences are different, output NO. \n\n- Else, for each character in the a/c sequence, track their positions in s and t. \n\nWait, but how to track their positions? \n\nWe can process s and t to get the list of a and c characters along with their indices. \n\nFor example, for s: \n\nWe can create a list of pairs (char, index) for each a or c in s. \n\nSimilarly for t. \n\nThen, we can compare the characters in the lists. \n\nIf the characters are different, return NO. \n\nThen, for each pair of corresponding elements in the two lists (from s and t), check: \n\n- if the character is 'a', then the index in t must be >= the index in s. \n\n- if the character is 'c', then the index in t must be <= the index in s. \n\nIf all these are true, then return YES, else NO. \n\nThis seems manageable. \n\nNow, let's think about the code. \n\nThe code given has a loop over each character in s and t, but the user needs to fill in the for loop. \n\nWait, the code currently has a for loop from 0 to n-1, and inside it, the TODO. \n\nBut the code's current structure is: \n\nwhile (t--) { \n\n    read n, s, st. \n\n    for (int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n        // TODO \n\n    } \n\n    cout << (st == s ? \"YES\" : \"NO\") << endl; \n\n} \n\nSo the current code is checking if s equals t, which is obviously wrong. \n\nThe user needs to replace the for loop with the correct logic. \n\nHmm, but the code structure may need to be changed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should process the a/c sequences and check the conditions. \n\nSo the steps in code would be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Read n, s, t. \n\n- Check if counts of a, b, c in s and t are equal. \n\n- If not, output NO. \n\n- Else, process the a/c sequences for s and t. \n\n- If the sequences are different, output NO. \n\n- Else, for each corresponding a/c in the sequences, check the position conditions. \n\n- If all conditions met, output YES, else NO. \n\nSo the code needs to implement this. \n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently. \n\nFirst, for counting the characters: \n\nWe can use a frequency array for s and t. \n\nThen, for the a/c sequences: \n\nWe can create two vectors for s and t. \n\nFor example, for s: \n\nvector<pair<char, int>> s_list; \n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    if (s[i] == 'a' || s[i] == 'c') { \n\n        s_list.push_back( {s[i], i} ); \n\n    } \n\n} \n\nSimilarly for t. \n\nThen, if the lengths of s_list and t_list are different, output NO. \n\nElse, compare each element's character. \n\nThen, for each pair in s_list and t_list: \n\nfor (int i=0; i < s_list.size(); i++) { \n\n    if (s_list[i].first != t_list[i].first) return NO; \n\n    char c = s_list[i].first; \n\n    int s_pos = s_list[i].second; \n\n    int t_pos = t_list[i].second; \n\n    if (c == 'a' && t_pos < s_pos) \u2192 no \n\n    if (c == 'c' && t_pos > s_pos \u2192 no \n\n} \n\nIf all pass, then yes. \n\nSo putting this into code. \n\nNow, the code given has a for loop over each character, but the user needs to fill in the code. \n\nThe current code's for loop is inside the test case loop. \n\nBut perhaps the code can be restructured. \n\nAlternatively, the code can be written as follows: \n\nInside the test case loop: \n\nRead n, s, t. \n\nCheck counts. \n\nThen process the a/c sequences. \n\nBut the code given has a for loop over i from 0 to n-1, so perhaps the user is supposed to fill in the code inside that loop. \n\nWait, but the code currently has a for loop that does nothing except the TODO. \n\nThe code then outputs (st == s) ? \"YES\" : \"NO\". \n\nSo the user needs to replace the for loop with the correct logic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be rewritten, but the user is to fill in the missing parts. \n\nHmm, the problem says: \n\n\"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. Output the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code.
