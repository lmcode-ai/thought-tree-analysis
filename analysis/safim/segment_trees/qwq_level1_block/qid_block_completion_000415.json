The operations involve moving a pointer and modifying elements. The key points are:\n\nThe pointer starts at the first element. The operations are:\n\n1. If not on the last element, increase current element by 1, then move to next. 2. If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous. And after all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element. Hmm. The goal is to see if the given array a can be achieved through some sequence of these operations. Let me think about the process. Each operation moves the pointer either forward or backward, but each step changes the current element. The pointer must end at the first position. I need to find some invariant or condition that the array must satisfy for it to be possible. Let me think of the operations as steps. Let's model the process. Each time you do an operation of type 1, you move right, increasing the current element. Each type 2 operation moves left, decreasing the current. The pointer starts at position 0 (assuming 0-based), and must end there. Let me think of the path of the pointer.",

First, the sum of all elements must be equal to the net number of R steps minus L steps? Not sure. Wait, the total sum of a[i] is equal to the total number of R steps minus the total number of L steps. Because each R step adds 1 to some a[i], and each L step subtracts 1 from some a[i]. So sum(a) = (number of R steps) - (number of L steps). But since the path starts and ends at 0, the total number of R steps must equal the number of L steps. Because each R step moves +1, each L step -1, so total displacement is (R - L) steps, which must be 0. So R = L. Therefore, sum(a) must be zero. That's one condition. So if the sum is not zero, the answer is immediately No. Wait, that's an important point. The sum of all elements must be zero. Because R steps and L steps are equal in number, so sum(a) = (R - L) = 0. So first check: if sum(a) ! =0, then output No. But the problem's sample input might have that. Let me check the note in the problem. In the note, the second test case's example ends with the array [2, -1, -1, 0]. Let's compute the sum: 2-1-1+0 =0. So that's okay. So first condition: sum must be zero. So in the code, the 'sum' variable is being tracked, and the code checks sum==0. So that's already part of the code's current structure. So that's good.

So any operation that affects the last element must be a right move from n-2 to n-1, which increases a[n-1] by 1. But to return to the first position, you have to eventually move back left through all positions. So the last element's value must be the number of times you moved right into it minus the number of times you moved left out of it. But moving left from the last element would require being there and moving left, which would decrease a[n-1] by 1 and move to n-2. So the net a[n-1] is (number of R steps into it) minus (number of L steps from it). But the number of L steps from it is exactly the number of times you left it via L, which is the number of times you came back from it. So the a[n-1] must be non-negative? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the last element must be zero. Because to return to the first position, you must have exited the last element as many times as you entered it.",

Wait, let me test this with the sample: Sample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The a[1] is -1 < = 2, a[2] is -1 <=-1, a[3] is 0 <=-1? No, 0 is greater than -1. So this would violate the condition.

Because to move from i to i+1, you have to have done some R steps from i, but to return, you have to move back. Wait, perhaps the following condition must hold for all i from 0 to n-2:\n\na[i] >= a[i+1]\n\nBecause every time you move to the right from i, you increase a[i], but to return, you have to move left from i+1, which decreases a[i+1]. So the net a[i] must be at least as much as a[i+1]. Wait, let me test this with the sample: Sample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. Check the differences between consecutive elements:\n\na[0] =2 >= a[1]=-1 \u2192 yes. a[1]=-1 >= a[2]=-1 \u2192 yes.\n\na[2]=-1 >= a[3]=0 \u2192 no. So this would violate the condition.

So every time you move right to position i, you must eventually move left back from i. So the number of times you move right from i must be equal to the number of times you move left from i+1 (except for the last position). Wait, perhaps the following holds: For all positions i from 0 to n-2:\n\nR[i] = L[i+1]\n\nBecause every time you move right from i, you have to eventually move left from i+1 to return. So R[i] = L[i+1]\n\nThen, substituting into a[i] = R[i] - L[i], we get:\n\na[i] = L[i+1] - L[i]\n\nRearranged:\n\nL[i] = L[i+1] - a[i] This recurrence relation can be used to compute L[i] in terms of L[i+1]. Starting from the end: At position n-1 (the last element), you can't move right, so R[n-1] =0. From the equation R[i] = L[i+1], for i =n-2:\n\nR[n-2] = L[n-1]\n\nBut also, a[n-1] = R[n-1] - L[n-1] \u2192 since R[n-1] =0, a[n-1] = -L[n-1] So L[n-1] = -a[n-1]\n\nThen, for i =n-2:\n\nL[n-2] = L[n-1] - a[n-2] \u2192 substituting L[n-1] = -a[n-1], we get L[n-2] = -a[n-1] -a[n-2]\n\nContinuing this way, we can compute L[i] for all i down to 0. But also, the total L[0] must be zero because you can't move left from position 0. Wait, L[0] is the number of times you moved left from position 0, which is impossible. So L[0] must be zero. So the recurrence must satisfy L[0] =0. So the conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of all a[i] must be zero. 2. The computed L[0] using the recurrence must be zero. 3. All L[i] must be non-negative, because you can't have a negative number of left moves. Wait, this seems promising. Let me formalize this:\n\nWe can compute L[i] for each position from the end backward. Starting with L[n-1] = -a[n-1]\n\nThen for i from n-2 down to 0:\n\nL[i] = L[i+1] - a[i]\n\nBut also, R[i] = L[i+1]\n\nThe conditions are:\n\n- All L[i] must be >=0.\n\n- L[0] must be zero. Additionally, the sum of a must be zero. Because sum(a) = sum (R[i] - L[i]) for all i. But R[i] = L[i+1], so:\n\nsum(a) = sum (L[i+1] - L[i]) for all i from 0 to n-1. This telescopes to L[n] - L[0]. But L[n] is undefined (since there is no position n). Wait, perhaps the sum is:\n\nsum_{i=0 to n-1} (R[i] - L[i]) = sum_{i=0 to n-1} (L[i+1] - L[i]) \n\nwhere L[n] is considered as 0 (since there is no position n). So the sum becomes L[n] - L[0] = 0 - L[0]. But the sum must be zero, so:\n\n0 - L[0] =0 \u2192 L[0] =0.\n\nWhich is already one of the conditions. So the conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of a must be zero. 2. When computing L[i] from the end backward, all L[i] must be >=0.\n\n3. L[0] must be zero. So this gives us the conditions to check. This seems like a solid approach. Let me test this with the sample input. Sample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0].\n\nn=4. Compute L[3] = -a[3] = -0 =0. Then:\n\nL[2] = L[3] - a[2] \u2192 0 - (-1) =1.\n\nL[1] = L[2] -a[1] \u21921 - (-1) =2.\n\nL[0] = L[1] -a[0] \u21922 -2 =0.\n\nAll L[i] are non-negative, and L[0] is zero. So it's valid. So this works. Another test case: let's take the first test case's note.",

So the code's current for loop is for reading the elements, but the user's code has a for loop with a TODO. So the user's code needs to read the array, compute the sum, and then process the L steps. So the missing code in the for loop is to read the elements and add to sum. Wait, the current code has:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nInside this loop, the code must read each a[i], add to sum, and store the array.

So the user's code currently has:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n} So the missing code here is to read the elements and add to sum, and store them in an array.

So the first step is to read the elements into an array. So the code inside the for loop must read each element, store it in an array, and add to sum. So the code inside the for loop would be:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i]; But since the array 'a' is not declared yet, we need to declare it first. So the code should be modified as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = nextInt(); long[] a = new long[n]; // declare array\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nThen, after reading the array, we need to compute the L steps. So after the for loop, we have to process the L steps. So the code after the for loop would be:\n\n// after reading the array:\n\nif (sum ! =0) valid = false;\n\nelse {\n\n    // compute L steps\n\n    long current_L = -a[n-1];\n\n    if (current_L <0) valid = false;\n\n    else {\n\n        for (int i =n-2; i >=0; i--) {\n\n            current_L -= a[i];\n\n            if (current_L <0) {\n\n                valid = false;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        } if (current_L ! =0) valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo putting this all together. The complete code would be:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n];\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nif (sum ! =0) valid = false;\n\nelse {\n\n    long current_L = -a[n-1];\n\n    if (current_L <0) valid = false;\n\n    else {\n\n        for (int i =n-2; i >=0; i--) {\n\n            current_L -= a[i];\n\n            if (current_L <0) {\n\n                valid = false;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        } if (current_L ! =0) valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nWait, but the 'valid' variable is already set based on the conditions. So the final check can just be 'if (valid)'. Because sum is already checked in the first condition. Wait, the code currently has:\n\nif(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nBut in the code above, the 'valid' is set to false if sum ! =0. So the 'sum==0' is redundant. So the final condition can be just 'if (valid)'. So the code can be adjusted to:\n\nif (valid) pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nBut in the current code structure, the code has:\n\nif(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\"); So to make it work, the 'valid' variable must also account for the sum being zero. Alternatively, the code can be adjusted as follows:\n\nInitially, valid is true. Then, if sum ! =0 \u2192 valid = false. Then, after processing the L steps, if any condition is violated, valid is set to false. Thus, the final condition can be 'if (valid)'. So the code should be:\n\nAfter the for loop:\n\nif (sum ! =0) valid = false;\n\nelse {\n\n    ... compute current_L and check conditions, setting valid to false if any condition fails.\n\n}\n\nThen, the final check is if (valid) \u2192 yes else no. So the code's final condition can be:\n\nif (valid) pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\"); But in the current code's structure, the code has:\n\nif(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nSo to make it work, the 'valid' must include the sum check. Thus, the code should be adjusted to set valid to false if sum is not zero. So the code inside the test case loop would be:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n];\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nif (sum ! =0) valid = false;\n\nelse {\n\n    long current_L = -a[n-1];\n\n    if (current_L <0) valid = false;\n\n    else {\n\n        for (int i =n-2; i >=0; i--) {\n\n            current_L -= a[i];\n\n            if (current_L <0) {\n\n                valid = false;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        } if (current_L ! =0) valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (valid) pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nThis should work. Now, the missing code in the original code's for loop is to read the elements into an array and add to sum. The original code's for loop is:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n} So the missing code here is:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i];\n\nBut since the array 'a' is not declared yet, we need to declare it first. So the code inside the test case loop should first declare the array:\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; Then, in the for loop:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i]; Thus, the complete code for the for loop part is:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // declare array\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n} Then, the rest of the code as above. So the missing code in the original code's for loop is:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i];\n\nBut since the array 'a' is not declared in the original code, the user must also declare it. Thus, the code inside the test case loop must first declare the array, then read the elements. Therefore, the missing code in the original code's for loop is:\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // declared before the loop\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n} But the original code's for loop is already there, so the user must add the array declaration and the code inside the loop. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // before the for loop\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n} But the original code's for loop is already present, so the user must add the array declaration and the code inside the loop. So the code inside the test case loop would be:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // added\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n} Then, after the for loop, the code must process the L steps.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining if a given array can be obtained through a series of operations with certain constraints. The operations involve moving a pointer and modifying elements. The key points are:\n\nThe pointer starts at the first element. The operations are:\n\n1. If not on the last element, increase current element by 1, then move to next.\n2. If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous.\n\nAnd after all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element.\n\nHmm. The goal is to see if the given array a can be achieved through some sequence of these operations.\n\nLet me think about the process. Each operation moves the pointer either forward or backward, but each step changes the current element. The pointer must end at the first position.\n\nI need to find some invariant or condition that the array must satisfy for it to be possible.\n\nLet me think of the operations as steps. Let's model the process.\n\nEach time you do an operation of type 1, you move right, increasing the current element. Each type 2 operation moves left, decreasing the current.\n\nThe pointer starts at position 0 (assuming 0-based), and must end there.\n\nLet me think of the path of the pointer. The pointer's movement is a sequence of steps moving left or right, but each step is either +1 (right) or -1 (left), but with the constraints of not going beyond the array.\n\nWait, but each step is either moving right (type 1) or left (type 2). The path of the pointer is a walk that starts and ends at position 0. The total displacement must be zero.\n\nBut how does this affect the array's elements?\n\nEach time you move right (type 1), you add 1 to the current element before moving. So, for each time you pass through a position moving right, that contributes +1 to the element. Similarly, moving left (type 2) subtracts 1 from the current element before moving left. So each time you move left through a position, it subtracts 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the number of times the pointer moves through each position in each direction.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the net effect on each element. Let me consider the path of the pointer as a sequence of moves. Each time the pointer is at position i, moving right (type 1) would add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. Moving left (type 2) would subtract 1 from a[i], then move to i-1.\n\nThe total value of a[i] is the number of times the pointer was at i and did a type 1 operation minus the number of times it did a type 2 operation while there.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference between consecutive elements must satisfy some condition. Let me think of the array's elements and see what constraints they must satisfy.\n\nLet me think of the process as a path that starts and ends at 0. Let's model the path as a sequence of steps. Each step is either +1 (right) or -1 (left). The path must start and end at 0, so the total number of right and left steps must balance out.\n\nBut how does this affect the array's elements?\n\nWait, each time you move right from position i to i+1, you add 1 to a[i]. Each time you move left from position i to i-1, you subtract 1 from a[i].\n\nWait, actually, when moving right (type 1), you first add 1 to the current element (i) and then move to i+1. So the a[i] is increased by 1 each time you choose to move right from i. Similarly, moving left (type 2) subtracts 1 from the current element (i) and then moves to i-1. So each time you move left from i, a[i] is decreased by 1.\n\nTherefore, the value of a[i] is equal to the number of times you moved right from i minus the number of times you moved left from i.\n\nWait, but the pointer can be at position i multiple times, and each time you choose to move right or left (if possible), you perform the operation.\n\nHmm. Let me think of the total number of times the pointer is at each position and the direction they move.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the difference between adjacent elements. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I consider the array a. Let me think of the required conditions.\n\nLet me think of the path of the pointer as a walk starting and ending at 0. Let me denote the path as a sequence of positions. Let me think of the path as a series of steps. Each step is either R (right) or L (left), but constrained by the array's boundaries.\n\nThe total displacement must be zero (since it starts and ends at 0).\n\nNow, for each position i (except the first and last?), the number of times you move right from i must be equal to the number of times you move left into i from i+1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference between a[i] and a[i+1] must be non-negative? Or some other relation.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me model the net effect on each a[i].\n\nSuppose the pointer is at position i. Each time it moves right (R), it adds 1 to a[i], then moves to i+1. Each time it moves left (L), it subtracts 1 from a[i], then moves to i-1.\n\nThe total a[i] is equal to (number of R moves from i) minus (number of L moves from i).\n\nBut how can we relate this to the path?\n\nThe path starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let me think of the path as a sequence of positions. Let me denote the path as a sequence of positions p_0, p_1, ..., p_m where p_0 = 0 and p_m = 0. Each step from p_k to p_{k+1} is either +1 or -1.\n\nEach time the pointer is at position i, the next move is either R (if possible) or L (if possible). Each such move contributes to a[i].\n\nThe total a[i] is equal to (number of times the pointer was at i and chose R) minus (number of times it was at i and chose L).\n\nHmm. Let me think of the path as a walk. Let me consider the number of times the pointer enters and exits each position.\n\nWait, for each position i (except 0 and n-1?), the number of times you enter from the left (i-1) must equal the number of times you exit to the right (i+1) plus the number of times you exit to the left (i-1) via L moves. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the difference between a[i] and a[i+1]. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I consider the path. Let me think of the net effect on a[i].\n\nWait, let me think of the path as a series of steps. Let me consider the difference between a[i] and a[i-1].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\nLet me consider the required conditions for the array a to be valid.\n\nFirst, the sum of all elements must be equal to the net number of R steps minus L steps? Not sure. Wait, the total sum of a[i] is equal to the total number of R steps minus the total number of L steps. Because each R step adds 1 to some a[i], and each L step subtracts 1 from some a[i]. So sum(a) = (number of R steps) - (number of L steps). But since the path starts and ends at 0, the total number of R steps must equal the number of L steps. Because each R step moves +1, each L step -1, so total displacement is (R - L) steps, which must be 0. So R = L. Therefore, sum(a) must be zero. That's one condition. So if the sum is not zero, the answer is immediately No.\n\nWait, that's an important point. The sum of all elements must be zero. Because R steps and L steps are equal in number, so sum(a) = (R - L) = 0. So first check: if sum(a) !=0, then output No.\n\nBut the problem's sample input might have that. Let me check the note in the problem.\n\nIn the note, the second test case's example ends with the array [2, -1, -1, 0]. Let's compute the sum: 2-1-1+0 =0. So that's okay.\n\nSo first condition: sum must be zero. So in the code, the 'sum' variable is being tracked, and the code checks sum==0. So that's already part of the code's current structure. So that's good.\n\nBut there must be more conditions. Because even if the sum is zero, the array might not be achievable.\n\nSo what other conditions?\n\nLet me think of the path. Let me model the path as a walk starting and ending at 0. Let me think of the path's \"height\" as the current position. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps, and track the number of times we go up and down.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differences between consecutive elements must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, let's think of the array a. Let me consider the differences between a[i] and a[i-1], but maybe not exactly. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nSuppose we model the path as a sequence of moves. Let me think of the path as a series of steps. Let me consider the net effect on each a[i].\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: the array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1], or something like that. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps the parity or some cumulative condition.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the path's \"balance\" as we go along. Let me think of the path as a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let me consider the number of times we have gone to the right and left.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the required conditions based on the path's movement. Let me think of the following:\n\nEach time you move to the right (R), you are increasing the current a[i], and moving forward. Each time you move left (L), you are decreasing a[i], and moving back.\n\nThe path must form a closed loop starting and ending at 0. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me consider the cumulative effect on the array.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by some similar problems (like the \"Ulam's problem\" or certain array path problems):\n\nLet me consider the array a. Let me define a new array d where d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps the differences between consecutive elements must be non-negative?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach works:\n\nLet me consider the path's movement. Let me think of the path as a series of steps. Let me track the number of times the pointer has moved past each position. Let me think of the required conditions for the array.\n\nAnother idea: Let me model the problem by considering the required number of times the pointer must pass through each position in each direction.\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach. Let me think of the path as a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let me consider the number of times the pointer is at each position. Let me think of the net effect on each a[i].\n\nSuppose that for each position i, the number of times the pointer moves right from i (R_i) minus the number of times it moves left from i (L_i) must equal a[i]. Because each R_i contributes +1 to a[i], each L_i contributes -1. So a[i] = R_i - L_i.\n\nAdditionally, the total number of R steps must equal the total number of L steps (since the path starts and ends at 0).\n\nMoreover, the path's movement must form a valid walk. For example, the pointer can't move left from position 0, and can't move right from position n-1.\n\nNow, how can we model the relationships between R_i and L_i?\n\nLet me think of the transitions between positions. For each position i (except 0 and n-1), the number of times you enter from the left (i-1) must equal the number of times you exit to the right (i+1) plus the number of times you exit to the left (i-1 via L steps). Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me consider the difference between a[i] and a[i+1]. Let me see:\n\nSuppose I have the array a. Let me consider the path's movement. Let me think of the path as a series of steps. Let me consider the cumulative effect on the array.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample:\n\nIn the sample, the second test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. Let's see how the operations can form this.\n\nThe example's steps are:\n\nStart at 0 (position 0). Then:\n\n1. R: increase a[0] to 1, move to 1.\n\n2. L: decrease a[1] to -1, move back to 0.\n\nWait, but in the example's steps, after moving right to position 1, they then move left back to 0, but that would subtract 1 from a[1], but in the example's first step, after moving right, the next step is moving left from position 1 to 0, which subtracts 1 from a[1], so a[1] becomes -1. Then moving right again to 1, etc.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model the required conditions based on the path's \"balance\".\n\nAnother approach: Let me think of the problem in terms of the required path's properties. Let me consider the path as a sequence of steps. Let me track the current position and the required a[i] values.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nLet me consider the array a. Let me define a variable that tracks the \"balance\" as we process the array from left to right. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let me think of the required number of times we have to move left from each position.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let me think of the following:\n\nThe pointer starts at 0. To reach the end and come back, the path must consist of some moves. Let me think of the required conditions for the array a.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nThe total number of times you move right from position i must be equal to the number of times you move left from position i+1, plus some other terms. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me define for each position i, the number of times the pointer moves right from i as R[i], and the number of times it moves left from i as L[i].\n\nThen, the value of a[i] is R[i] - L[i].\n\nAdditionally, the path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 0. So the total displacement is zero, so the total R steps must equal the total L steps.\n\nMoreover, for each position except the first and last, the number of times you enter the position must equal the number of times you leave it. Let me think of the transitions:\n\nFor position 0:\n\nThe number of times you leave it via R (R[0]) must equal the number of times you enter it from the left (but since it's the first position, you can't enter from the left). So the only way to enter 0 is via moving left from position 1. So the number of times you enter 0 is equal to L[1]. But since the path starts at 0, the total number of times you are at 0 is 1 (initial) plus the number of times you return. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i (except 0 and n-1), the number of times you enter from the left (i-1) plus the number of times you enter from the right (i+1) must equal the number of times you leave via R or L.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the transitions between positions. Let me think of the following equations:\n\nFor each position i (except 0 and n-1):\n\nThe number of times you enter i from the left (i-1 via R from i-1) plus the number of times you enter from the right (i+1 via L from i+1) must equal the number of times you leave via R (R[i]) plus the number of times you leave via L (L[i]).\n\nWait, that's a bit abstract. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe number of times you arrive at i must equal the number of times you leave i. Because every time you arrive, you must leave except for the start and end.\n\nWait, since the path starts at 0 and ends at 0, the total number of times you arrive at 0 is equal to the number of times you leave it, except for the initial position. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by some similar problems where the path must form a certain condition:\n\nLet me consider the following: the array a must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1]. Wait, but in the sample input, the second test case has a[1] = -1 which is less than a[0] = 2, so that holds. But maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the differences between a[i] and a[i-1] must be non-negative? Let me see the sample:\n\nSample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The differences between consecutive elements are -3, 0, 1. So that's not non-negative. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another way. Let me think of the path as a series of moves. Let me track the current position and the required a[i] values.\n\nSuppose I process the array from left to right. Let me think of the required number of times we have to move left from each position.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's movement constraints:\n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me define a variable 'balance' which starts at 0. As I process the array from left to right, the balance must never be negative. Wait, perhaps this is similar to the classic parentheses problem.\n\nWait, here's an approach that might work:\n\nLet me think of the array a. Let me process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the number of times we have to move left from the current position to satisfy the previous steps.\n\nWait, let me think of the following:\n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let me define a variable 'required' which tracks the minimum number of times we have to move left from the current position to satisfy the previous steps.\n\nLet me see:\n\nStart at position 0. The a[0] is the number of times we moved right from 0 minus the number of times we moved left from 0. But since the pointer starts at 0, any left move from 0 is impossible (since it's the first element). So L[0] = 0. So a[0] = R[0] - 0 = R[0]. So R[0] must equal a[0].\n\nBut R[0] is the number of times we moved right from 0. Each such move takes us to position 1. So the first step must be moving right R[0] times, but then we have to come back.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting somewhere.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem by considering the required path's movement and the constraints on the array.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nLet me process the array from left to right. Let me track a variable 'balance' which represents the number of times we have to move left from the current position to return to the start.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's movement:\n\nThe key is that whenever you move to the right, you have to eventually come back. So the number of times you go right must be balanced by left moves.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nLet me process the array from left to right. Let me track a variable 'current' which represents the current \"depth\" or the number of steps to the right we have taken without returning.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works:\n\nInitialize a variable 'current' to 0. We process each element from left to right (starting at index 0):\n\nFor each element a[i], the current value must be >=0.\n\nThe required 'current' after processing a[i] is:\n\ncurrent = current + a[i] - (a[i+1] if i <n-1 else 0) ?\n\nNot sure. Alternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1]. Wait, but in the sample input, the second test case's a[1] is -1 which is less than a[0] =2, so that holds. But let's see another example.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 1, 0]. Let's see:\n\nThe sum is 2, which is not zero. So it's invalid. So that's okay.\n\nAnother example: [3, -1, 0]. Sum is 2, so invalid.\n\nWait, but let's think of a valid case where a[i] is greater than a[i-1]. Suppose the array is [2, 3, 1, 0]. Sum is 6, which is not zero. So that's invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe the condition is that all elements except the first must be less than or equal to the previous? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions must hold:\n\nThe array must have a[0] >=0, and for each i from 1 to n-1, a[i] <= a[i-1]. Also, the sum must be zero.\n\nWait, let me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The a[1] is -1 which is less than a[0] =2, so that holds. a[2] is -1 <= -1, okay. a[3] is 0 <=-1? No, 0 is greater than -1. So that would violate the condition. But the sample is valid. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Let me think of the path as a walk that starts and ends at 0. Let me model the required conditions based on the path's minimum and maximum positions.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's movement:\n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me track the required number of left moves needed to return to the start. Let me process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'balance' which must never be negative.\n\nWait, here's an approach that might work:\n\nInitialize a variable 'balance' to 0. We process the array from left to right, except the last element.\n\nFor each element a[i] (from 0 to n-1):\n\nbalance += a[i]\n\nBut also, when moving to the next element, perhaps there's a condition.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from similar problems (like the \"Ulam's problem\" or the \"array path problem\"):\n\nThe key is to realize that the array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1], and the sum must be zero. Wait, but the sample's third element is 0 which is greater than the second element's -1. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1], and the sum is zero. But the sample contradicts this. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following:\n\nThe array must satisfy that the sum is zero, and for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1], and also the last element must be zero. Wait, but the sample's last element is zero. Let me see:\n\nSample 2's array ends with 0. So that holds. But what about another example?\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 0, 0]. Sum is 1, so invalid. But if the array is [1, 0, -1], sum is 0. The last element is -1, so the condition would require the last element to be zero. So that would be invalid, but maybe it's possible?\n\nWait, let's see if [1,0,-1] can be formed.\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nStart at 0. Let's see:\n\nWe need to end at 0.\n\nSuppose the steps are:\n\nR (to 1, a[0] becomes 1), then R (to 2, a[1] becomes 1), but then we can't go further. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nStart at 0. Do R to 1 (a[0] becomes 1), then L to 0 (a[1] becomes 0). Then R again to 1 (a[0] becomes 2?), no, wait:\n\nWait, each R step increases the current element before moving. So when moving R from 0 to 1, a[0] increases by 1. Then moving L from 1 to 0 would decrease a[1] by 1. So after those two steps, a[0] is 1, a[1] is -1. Hmm, but that's not the desired array.\n\nHmm, perhaps this example is not possible. So the condition that the last element must be zero might be necessary. But in the sample's case, the last element is zero, so that holds.\n\nWait, but the sample's second test case's array ends with 0. So maybe the last element must be zero?\n\nWait, let me think of the problem's first note:\n\nIn the first test case, the array might not be possible because the pointer isn't on the first element. But the problem requires that the pointer must end on the first element. So the array can have non-zero elements as long as the pointer ends at first.\n\nWait, the array can have any elements as long as the conditions are met, but the pointer must end at first.\n\nHmm, perhaps the last element must be zero? Because to get back to the first position, you can't have any steps that require moving past the last element. So the last element's value must be zero?\n\nWait, let me think: the last element can only be modified when moving right from the previous position. Because you can't move right from the last element. So any operation that affects the last element must be a right move from n-2 to n-1, which increases a[n-1] by 1. But to return to the first position, you have to eventually move back left through all positions. So the last element's value must be the number of times you moved right into it minus the number of times you moved left out of it. But moving left from the last element would require being there and moving left, which would decrease a[n-1] by 1 and move to n-2. So the net a[n-1] is (number of R steps into it) minus (number of L steps from it). But the number of L steps from it is exactly the number of times you left it via L, which is the number of times you came back from it. So the a[n-1] must be non-negative? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the last element must be zero. Because to return to the first position, you must have exited the last element as many times as you entered it. Wait, but the last element can be entered via R from n-2, and exited via L back to n-2. So the net a[n-1] is (number of R steps into it) minus (number of L steps from it). But the number of R steps into it is the number of times you moved right from n-2 to n-1. The number of L steps from it is the number of times you moved left from n-1 to n-2. So the net a[n-1] is (R_{n-2} - L_{n-1}).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions must hold:\n\nThe sum of the array must be zero.\n\nAdditionally, for all i from 1 to n-1, a[i] must be less than or equal to a[i-1].\n\nWait, let me test this with the sample:\n\nSample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The a[1] is -1 <= 2, a[2] is -1 <=-1, a[3] is 0 <=-1? No, 0 is greater than -1. So this would violate the condition. But the sample is valid. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm, so that idea is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me think of the path as a series of steps. Let me model the required conditions using the following variables:\n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. We start at 0. The path must end at 0.\n\nLet me think of the array a as the result of the operations. Each time you move right from position i, you add 1 to a[i], then move to i+1. Each time you move left from i, subtract 1 from a[i], then move to i-1.\n\nThe total a[i] is the number of times you moved right from i minus the number of times you moved left from i.\n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. Let me think of the path as a sequence of moves. Let me consider the net effect on each a[i].\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe number of times you move right from position i must be equal to the number of times you move left from position i+1, plus some other terms.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's movement constraints:\n\nLet me consider the following variables:\n\nLet me process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'balance' which represents the number of times we have to move left to return to the start.\n\nInitialize balance to 0.\n\nFor each position i from 0 to n-1:\n\n- The current a[i] must be such that balance + a[i] >=0. Because you can't have more left moves than the available right moves.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works:\n\nWe can model the problem by keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the current \"balance\" of moves. Let me think of it as the number of steps to the right we have taken without returning.\n\nInitialize current =0.\n\nWe process the array from left to right:\n\nFor each i from 0 to n-1:\n\ncurrent += a[i]\n\nBut also, when moving to the next element, we have to ensure that current doesn't drop below zero?\n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\nThe idea is that the path must form a valid walk that returns to 0. So the cumulative sum of a[i] up to position i must be non-negative, and the total sum must be zero.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nSuppose we have a path that starts at 0 and ends at 0. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Let me consider the cumulative sum of (R steps - L steps) up to each position. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's movement:\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nLet me define an array 'd' where d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i>0, and d[0] = a[0].\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to look at the differences between consecutive elements.\n\nWait, let me think of the following:\n\nThe total number of times you move right from position i is R[i], and the number of times you move left from i is L[i].\n\nThen, a[i] = R[i] - L[i].\n\nThe path must start at 0 and end at 0. So the total displacement is zero, so the total R steps equals total L steps.\n\nNow, for each position i (except 0 and n-1), the number of times you arrive at i must equal the number of times you leave it. \n\nThe number of times you arrive at i from the left (i-1) is R[i-1], and from the right (i+1) is L[i+1]. \n\nThe number of times you leave i is R[i] + L[i].\n\nSo:\n\nR[i-1] + L[i+1] = R[i] + L[i]\n\nRearranged:\n\nR[i] = R[i-1] + L[i+1] - L[i]\n\nHmm, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the following:\n\nThe net effect on a[i] and a[i+1] must be such that the path can form a valid walk.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe difference between a[i] and a[i+1] must be non-negative. Because to move from i to i+1, you have to have done some R steps from i, but to return, you have to move back. \n\nWait, perhaps the following condition must hold for all i from 0 to n-2:\n\na[i] >= a[i+1]\n\nBecause every time you move to the right from i, you increase a[i], but to return, you have to move left from i+1, which decreases a[i+1]. So the net a[i] must be at least as much as a[i+1].\n\nWait, let me test this with the sample:\n\nSample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nCheck the differences between consecutive elements:\n\na[0] =2 >= a[1]=-1 \u2192 yes.\n\na[1]=-1 >= a[2]=-1 \u2192 yes.\n\na[2]=-1 >= a[3]=0 \u2192 no. So this would violate the condition. But the sample is valid. So this idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that's not the case.\n\nAlternative idea: Let me think of the path's movement. The pointer must eventually return to 0. So every time you move right to position i, you must eventually move left back from i. So the number of times you move right from i must be equal to the number of times you move left from i+1 (except for the last position).\n\nWait, perhaps the following holds:\n\nFor all positions i from 0 to n-2:\n\nR[i] = L[i+1]\n\nBecause every time you move right from i, you have to eventually move left from i+1 to return.\n\nSo R[i] = L[i+1]\n\nThen, substituting into a[i] = R[i] - L[i], we get:\n\na[i] = L[i+1] - L[i]\n\nRearranged:\n\nL[i] = L[i+1] - a[i]\n\nThis recurrence relation can be used to compute L[i] in terms of L[i+1].\n\nStarting from the end:\n\nAt position n-1 (the last element), you can't move right, so R[n-1] =0. \n\nFrom the equation R[i] = L[i+1], for i =n-2:\n\nR[n-2] = L[n-1]\n\nBut also, a[n-1] = R[n-1] - L[n-1] \u2192 since R[n-1] =0, a[n-1] = -L[n-1]\n\nSo L[n-1] = -a[n-1]\n\nThen, for i =n-2:\n\nL[n-2] = L[n-1] - a[n-2] \u2192 substituting L[n-1] = -a[n-1], we get L[n-2] = -a[n-1] -a[n-2]\n\nContinuing this way, we can compute L[i] for all i down to 0.\n\nBut also, the total L[0] must be zero because you can't move left from position 0. Wait, L[0] is the number of times you moved left from position 0, which is impossible. So L[0] must be zero.\n\nSo the recurrence must satisfy L[0] =0.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of all a[i] must be zero.\n\n2. The computed L[0] using the recurrence must be zero.\n\n3. All L[i] must be non-negative, because you can't have a negative number of left moves.\n\nWait, this seems promising.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nWe can compute L[i] for each position from the end backward.\n\nStarting with L[n-1] = -a[n-1]\n\nThen for i from n-2 down to 0:\n\nL[i] = L[i+1] - a[i]\n\nBut also, R[i] = L[i+1]\n\nThe conditions are:\n\n- All L[i] must be >=0.\n\n- L[0] must be zero.\n\nAdditionally, the sum of a must be zero.\n\nBecause sum(a) = sum (R[i] - L[i]) for all i.\n\nBut R[i] = L[i+1], so:\n\nsum(a) = sum (L[i+1] - L[i]) for all i from 0 to n-1.\n\nThis telescopes to L[n] - L[0]. But L[n] is undefined (since there is no position n). Wait, perhaps the sum is:\n\nsum_{i=0 to n-1} (R[i] - L[i]) = sum_{i=0 to n-1} (L[i+1] - L[i]) \n\nwhere L[n] is considered as 0 (since there is no position n).\n\nSo the sum becomes L[n] - L[0] = 0 - L[0]. \n\nBut the sum must be zero, so:\n\n0 - L[0] =0 \u2192 L[0] =0.\n\nWhich is already one of the conditions.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The sum of a must be zero.\n\n2. When computing L[i] from the end backward, all L[i] must be >=0.\n\n3. L[0] must be zero.\n\nSo this gives us the conditions to check.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample 2's array is [2, -1, -1, 0].\n\nn=4.\n\nCompute L[3] = -a[3] = -0 =0.\n\nThen:\n\nL[2] = L[3] - a[2] \u2192 0 - (-1) =1.\n\nL[1] = L[2] -a[1] \u21921 - (-1) =2.\n\nL[0] = L[1] -a[0] \u21922 -2 =0.\n\nAll L[i] are non-negative, and L[0] is zero. So it's valid. So this works.\n\nAnother test case: let's take the first test case's note. The first test case's array might not be valid because the pointer isn't on the first element. But the problem requires the pointer to end at first, so the array must satisfy the conditions.\n\nSuppose the first test case's array is [1, 0]. Let's see:\n\nsum is 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAnother example: array [1, -1, 0].\n\nn=3.\n\nsum is 0.\n\nCompute L[2] = -a[2] =0.\n\nL[1] = L[2] -a[1] \u21920 - (-1) =1.\n\nL[0] = L[1] -a[0] \u21921-1=0.\n\nAll L[i] are non-negative. So valid.\n\nAnother example: array [3, -1, -1, -1].\n\nsum is 0.\n\nCompute L[3] = -a[3] =1.\n\nL[2] =1 - (-1) =2.\n\nL[1] =2 - (-1) =3.\n\nL[0] =3-3=0.\n\nAll L[i] are non-negative. So valid.\n\nAnother example where L[i] becomes negative:\n\narray [1, 2, 0].\n\nsum is 3 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAnother example: array [0, 1, 0].\n\nsum is 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAnother example: array [0, -1, 0].\n\nsum is -1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAnother example where L[i] is negative:\n\narray [0, 1, 0, 0].\n\nsum is 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAnother example where L[0] is not zero:\n\narray [1, 0, 0].\n\nsum is 1 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAnother example where L[i] is negative:\n\narray [2, -3, 0].\n\nn=3.\n\nL[2] =0.\n\nL[1] =0 - (-3) =3.\n\nL[0] =3-2=1 \u2192 which is not zero. So invalid.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- sum must be zero.\n\n- compute L[i] from the end backward, ensuring all L[i] >=0.\n\n- L[0] must be zero.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the array. If not zero \u2192 No.\n\n2. Compute L array from the end backward.\n\n3. Check if all L[i] are >=0 and L[0] is zero.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nThe code provided has a loop over the elements. The current code has:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nInside the loop, we need to compute the sum, and also track the L array.\n\nWait, but for large n (up to 2e5), we need an O(n) solution.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n- Compute the sum of the array. If it's not zero \u2192 invalid.\n\n- Then compute L array from the end backward.\n\nBut to compute L array, we can do it in a single pass from the end.\n\nLet me see:\n\nInitialize L_prev as -a[n-1].\n\nThen, for i from n-2 downto 0:\n\ncurrent_L = L_prev - a[i]\n\nCheck if current_L is >=0.\n\nIf any of these steps result in current_L <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nAlso, after processing all elements, the final L[0] must be zero.\n\nWait, but how to track this:\n\nWe can track the current_L as we go.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize L_prev = -a[n-1]\n\nif L_prev <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nThen, for i from n-2 downto 0:\n\ncurrent_L = L_prev - a[i]\n\nif current_L <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\nSet L_prev = current_L.\n\nAt the end, after processing i=0, L_prev should be equal to L[0], which must be zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nsum = sum of a.\n\nif sum !=0 \u2192 no.\n\nthen:\n\ncurrent_L = -a[n-1]\n\nif current_L <0 \u2192 no.\n\nthen iterate from i =n-2 downto 0:\n\ncurrent_L = current_L - a[i]\n\nif current_L <0 \u2192 no.\n\nAt the end, check if current_L ==0.\n\nIf all these conditions are met \u2192 yes.\n\nYes, this seems manageable.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- compute the sum.\n\n- check sum is zero.\n\n- compute current_L as -a[n-1], check it's >=0.\n\n- then iterate from i =n-2 downto 0:\n\ncurrent_L -= a[i]\n\nif current_L <0 \u2192 invalid.\n\n- after all iterations, check current_L ==0.\n\nSo in code:\n\nInside the loop for each test case:\n\nRead the array.\n\nCompute sum.\n\nif sum !=0 \u2192 valid = false.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute current_L = -a[n-1]\n\nif current_L <0 \u2192 valid = false.\n\nelse:\n\nloop from i =n-2 downto 0:\n\ncurrent_L -= a[i]\n\nif current_L <0 \u2192 valid = false; break;\n\nafter loop, check if current_L ==0 \u2192 if not, valid = false.\n\nSo the code needs to read the array, then do these steps.\n\nNow, the code provided has a for loop for reading the elements. Let me see:\n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nInside this loop, we need to read each a[i], add to sum, and also track the array.\n\nBut to compute the L array, we need to process the array from the end backward. So perhaps we need to store the array first.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead all elements into an array.\n\nThen compute the sum.\n\nThen compute the L steps.\n\nSo the code needs to first read the array.\n\nIn the current code, the for loop is for reading the elements. So perhaps the code should read the array into an array, then process it.\n\nBut in the current code structure, the for loop is inside the test case loop. So perhaps the code should read the array into an array, then process it.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n];\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nThen, after reading the array, compute the conditions.\n\nSo the code's current for loop is for reading the elements, but the user's code has a for loop with a TODO. So the user's code needs to read the array, compute the sum, and then process the L steps.\n\nSo the missing code in the for loop is to read the elements and add to sum.\n\nWait, the current code has:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nInside this loop, the code must read each a[i], add to sum, and store the array.\n\nSo the code inside the loop would be:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i];\n\nBut since the array is needed later, we need to store it.\n\nSo the code should first read the array.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nlong[] a = new long[n];\n\nfor (int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nThen, after the loop, process the L steps.\n\nBut in the current code structure, the for loop is already there, but the code is incomplete.\n\nSo the user's code currently has:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nSo the missing code here is to read the elements and add to sum, and store them in an array.\n\nBut the code currently doesn't have an array declared. So the user's code needs to declare an array.\n\nWait, looking at the code provided:\n\nThe code has:\n\npublic class c {\n\n    ... \n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n\n        ... \n\n        while(t-->0) {\n\n            int n = nextInt();\n\n            long sum =0;\n\n            boolean valid = true;\n\n            boolean zeroed = false;\n\n            for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n                /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n            }\n\n            if(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\n            else pw.println(\"No\");\n\n        }\n\n        pw.close();\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the code currently doesn't have an array to store the elements. So the first step is to read the elements into an array.\n\nSo the code inside the for loop must read each element, store it in an array, and add to sum.\n\nSo the code inside the for loop would be:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i];\n\nBut since the array 'a' is not declared yet, we need to declare it first.\n\nSo the code should be modified as follows:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // declare array\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nThen, after reading the array, we need to compute the L steps.\n\nSo after the for loop, we have to process the L steps.\n\nSo the code after the for loop would be:\n\n// after reading the array:\n\nif (sum !=0) valid = false;\n\nelse {\n\n    // compute L steps\n\n    long current_L = -a[n-1];\n\n    if (current_L <0) valid = false;\n\n    else {\n\n        for (int i =n-2; i >=0; i--) {\n\n            current_L -= a[i];\n\n            if (current_L <0) {\n\n                valid = false;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (current_L !=0) valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nThe complete code would be:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n];\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nif (sum !=0) valid = false;\n\nelse {\n\n    long current_L = -a[n-1];\n\n    if (current_L <0) valid = false;\n\n    else {\n\n        for (int i =n-2; i >=0; i--) {\n\n            current_L -= a[i];\n\n            if (current_L <0) {\n\n                valid = false;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (current_L !=0) valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nWait, but the 'valid' variable is already set based on the conditions. So the final check can just be 'if (valid)'.\n\nBecause sum is already checked in the first condition.\n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nif(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nBut in the code above, the 'valid' is set to false if sum !=0. So the 'sum==0' is redundant. So the final condition can be just 'if (valid)'.\n\nSo the code can be adjusted to:\n\nif (valid) pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nBut in the current code structure, the code has:\n\nif(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nSo to make it work, the 'valid' variable must also account for the sum being zero.\n\nAlternatively, the code can be adjusted as follows:\n\nInitially, valid is true.\n\nThen, if sum !=0 \u2192 valid = false.\n\nThen, after processing the L steps, if any condition is violated, valid is set to false.\n\nThus, the final condition can be 'if (valid)'.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nAfter the for loop:\n\nif (sum !=0) valid = false;\n\nelse {\n\n    ... compute current_L and check conditions, setting valid to false if any condition fails.\n\n}\n\nThen, the final check is if (valid) \u2192 yes else no.\n\nSo the code's final condition can be:\n\nif (valid) pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nBut in the current code's structure, the code has:\n\nif(valid && sum==0)pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nSo to make it work, the 'valid' must include the sum check.\n\nThus, the code should be adjusted to set valid to false if sum is not zero.\n\nSo the code inside the test case loop would be:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n];\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nif (sum !=0) valid = false;\n\nelse {\n\n    long current_L = -a[n-1];\n\n    if (current_L <0) valid = false;\n\n    else {\n\n        for (int i =n-2; i >=0; i--) {\n\n            current_L -= a[i];\n\n            if (current_L <0) {\n\n                valid = false;\n\n                break;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        if (current_L !=0) valid = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nif (valid) pw.println(\"Yes\");\n\nelse pw.println(\"No\");\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, the missing code in the original code's for loop is to read the elements into an array and add to sum.\n\nThe original code's for loop is:\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nSo the missing code here is:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i];\n\nBut since the array 'a' is not declared yet, we need to declare it first.\n\nSo the code inside the test case loop should first declare the array:\n\nlong[] a = new long[n];\n\nThen, in the for loop:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i];\n\nThus, the complete code for the for loop part is:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // declare array\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nThen, the rest of the code as above.\n\nSo the missing code in the original code's for loop is:\n\na[i] = nextInt();\n\nsum += a[i];\n\nBut since the array 'a' is not declared in the original code, the user must also declare it.\n\nThus, the code inside the test case loop must first declare the array, then read the elements.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the original code's for loop is:\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // declared before the loop\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nBut the original code's for loop is already there, so the user must add the array declaration and the code inside the loop.\n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // before the for loop\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nBut the original code's for loop is already present, so the user must add the array declaration and the code inside the loop.\n\nSo the code inside the test case loop would be:\n\nint n = nextInt();\n\nlong[] a = new long[n]; // added\n\nlong sum =0;\n\nboolean valid = true;\n\nfor(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    a[i] = nextInt();\n\n    sum += a[i];\n\n}\n\nThen, after the for loop, the code must process the L steps.\n\nThus, the missing code in the original code's for loop is the array declaration and the code inside the loop.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. The user's code currently has a for loop with a TODO. So the missing code is the array declaration and the code inside the loop.\n\nWait, but the code provided in the problem's code snippet does not have the array declared.

So the user must replace the TODO with the code inside the loop, and add the array declaration.\n\nHowever, the problem says to output only the missing code.
