So the steps for Megan would be:\n\ndistance from (n,1) to (x,y) + distance from (x,y) to (1,m) Plus the 1 for teleporting? No, I'm getting confused.

So 6+4 =10 steps. Megan's path: 7 rows up, 4 columns right: 6+4=10. Total 20. But the answer is 15, so saving of 5. Hmm, so the saving is 5. So the formula would be 20 -5 =15. What's the 5 in terms of n and m? \n\n7 and 5's minimal difference is 2 (7-5=2). Or perhaps the saving is (n-1)+(m-1) - (something). Hmm, maybe the minimal energy is 2*(n + m -2) - 2* (something). Let's see:\n\nIn the example, 2*(7 +5-2) = 2*10 =20. The answer is 15, so subtract 5. So 5 is (7 +5 - 2) - something? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula is 2*(n + m -2) - (min(n,m)*2 - 2). Let's see:\n\nFor the example, min(7,5)=5. 5*2-2 = 8. 20-8 =12, which is not 15. Hmm not right.

Testing the first example: \n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 min(n,m)=5. 2*(7+5\u20132) =20 \u2192 20-2*(5-1) =20-8=12. Not 15. Hmm, not correct. Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Let's consider that the minimal total energy is given by the formula:\n\nminTotal = 2*(n + m - 2) - 2*( (x + y) -1 ) \n\nor something like that. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 2) * 2 - (something related to the overlap). Wait, in the example, the saving is 5 steps. That comes from Stanley saving 5 steps (the 6 steps down replaced by 1 teleport). Megan also saved steps?",

So overall, the total for Megan is:\n\n[ (n-a)+(b-1) + (a-1) + (m -b) ) ] \n\n= n-a + b-1 +a-1 +m -b \n\n= n + m -2 So Megan's total is n+m-2. Stanley's total is:\n\n(a-1 + b-1) + [1 + (n-1)] \n\n= a + b -2 + 1 + n-1 \n\n= a + b + n - 2 \n\nThus, total energy is (a + b + n -2) + (n + m -2) = a + b + n-2 + n + m-2 \n\n= 2n + m + a + b -4 \n\nTo minimize this, we need to choose a and b such that a and b are as small as possible, but they must be along Megan's path. Wait, but Megan can choose her path to reach (a,b) in any way. To minimize the total, we want to minimize a + b. The minimal a and b can be is (a=1, b=1), but Megan's path would have to go there. But Megan starts at (n,1). To reach (1,1), she would need to move up (n-1) steps, so a=1, b=1 is possible. Then, a=1, b=1:\n\nTotal energy would be 2n + m + 1 +1 -4 = 2n +m -2 \n\nFor the example n=7, m=5:\n\n2*7 +5 -2 = 14+5-2=17 \u2192 but the example's answer is 15. So this isn't the right path. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait when a=1 and b=1:\n\nStanley's path to (1,1) is 0 steps. Then after teleporting from there to (1,m), he needs to walk down to (n,m) \u2192 n-1 steps. The total for Stanley is 0 (path to (1,1) ) + 1 (teleport) + (n-1) \u2192 total n steps. Megan's path to (1,1) is (n-1) steps up. Then she goes from there to (1,m), which is m-1 steps right. Total for Megan: (n-1) + (m-1) \u2192 n+m-2. So total energy is n + (n+m-2) = 2n +m-2. For n=7, m=5 \u2192 14+5-2=17. But the example is 15. So this is not optimal. So this path gives a higher total than the example. Hence the optimal path isn't when a and b are minimal. Hmm, perhaps my approach is missing something. Let me think of the example scenario again. The example's total is 15 when they meet at (1,3). In that case:\n\na=1, b=3. So a + b =4. Then the total energy would be:\n\n2n + m + a + b -4 \n\n=> 2*7 +5 +4 -4 = 14+5+0= 19 \u2192 no. Hmm, my formula must be wrong. Let me re-calculate with a=1, b=3:\n\nStanley's path to (1,3) is 2 steps right (from (1,1) to (1,3): cost 2. Then he teleports to (1,m) (which is (1,5)), cost 1. Then he walks down to (7,5): 6 steps (7 rows). So his total is 2 +1 +6=9.",

So the path is different. Let me re-calculate with that scenario: The meeting point is (1,3) and (7,3). Wait, maybe the idea is that they can teleport between any two portal locations.",

Megan moves up and right. The paths cross at (x,y) where x = (n +1)/2 or something? Alternatively, the optimal point is where the sum of the steps saved is maximized. The maximal saving for Stanley is when he teleports from a point far from his destination. For example, if Megan's path includes a point that is far from Stanley's destination. The maximal saving for Stanley is (distance between point and destination -1). The same for Megan. The total savings would be the sum of savings from both. To maximize savings, choose a point that provides the maximum total saving. The maximal saving occurs when the point is as far as possible from both destinations. But this is vague. Alternatively, the minimal total energy is (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) - min(2*(n-1), 2*(m-1), 2*(something)). Alternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (2*(n + m -2)) \u2014 (2*(min(n,m) -1)). Wait for the example, 2*(10) \u2014 2*(4)= 20-8=12. No. \n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for patterns. Let me try small examples:\n\nExample 1: n=1, m=1. Both start and end at the same point. So total energy 0. Formula: 0. Example 2: n=1, m=2. Stanley: from (1,1) to (1,2): 1 step. Megan: from (1,1) to (1,2): 1 step. Total without portals: 2. With portals, can they save anything? Megan starts at (1,1). So that has a portal.",

Total is 2 \u2192 same as without portals. So no savings possible. Thus the formula should give 2. \n\nExample 3: n=2, m=2. Stanley's path: 2 steps. Megan's path: 2 steps. Total 4. Can they save? Megan's path could be (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). Then: \n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can teleport to (2,1) (cost 1), then move right to (2,2): total 2. Megan's path is 2 steps. Total 2+2=4. No saving. Alternatively, if she goes directly:\n\nMegan's path (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2): steps 1 (right) and then 1 up. Total 2. Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (2,1) (cost 1), then move right to (2,2): 1+1=2 \u2192 total 4. No improvement. So the minimal is 4.\n\nExample 4: n=3, m=3. Original total: 8 steps.

Wait, Stanley's path would be:\n\nFrom (1,1) to (1,3): cost 2 steps right. Or he can teleport. Wait, if Megan's path includes (1,3), then the portal is there. Stanley can move to (1,3) normally (2 steps), then teleport to (3,3). No, but his destination is (3,3). Wait, to get to (3,3):\n\nAfter reaching (1,3), he can teleport to (3,1) (Megan's start) and then go right and down. No, the optimal would be:\n\nAfter reaching (1,3), he teleports to (3,1) (cost 1), then moves to (3,3) (2 steps). Total for Stanley: 2 (to 1,3) + 1 +2 =5.\n\nMegan's path is 4 steps. Total 9, which is worse than the original 8. Hmm, so maybe the best is to meet at (2,2). Megan's path: (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). Steps: 1 up, then right, up, right.

Another idea: the minimal total is (n + m - 2) * 2 - (n + m -2 - max(n,m)+1). For n=7 m=5: max is7. So (10)*2 - (10 -7+1)= 20-4=16. Close but not 15. Hmm.

Another idea: The minimal total is (n + m -1) *2 -1. For example, (7+5-1)*2-1=11*2-1=21. Nope. Hmm. Wait I think I need to think differently. The minimal total energy is the sum of both of their minimal paths minus twice the maximal possible savings. The maximal possible savings come from the maximum of the distance between two points they can teleport between. The maximum possible savings for both is when they can teleport between two points that are as far apart as possible.",

Alternatively, the maximal saving for one person is (distance between two points) -1, since teleportation costs 1 instead of the distance. The total saving is the maximum possible saving for both. Thus, the minimal total is (sum of individual paths) - 2*(max_saving). The maximal possible saving occurs when the two choose to teleport between two points that are as far as possible.

We need to find the maximal of (d_s +d_m \u2014 2) over all points (x,y) on Megan's path. The maximal possible (d_s +d_m) would be when (x,y) is as far as possible from both destinations. The farthest point from both destinations? The point (1,1) is far from both destinations (n,m) and (1,m). Distance to Stanley's destination: (n-1)+(m-1). Distance to Megan's destination: (m-1). Sum: (n+m-2) + (m-1) = n+2m-3. This would give a saving of (n+2m-3) -2 = n+2m-5. The total energy would be 2*(n+m-2) - (n+2m-5) = 2n + 2m-4 -n-2m+5 =n+1. For n=7, m=5 \u21927+1=8, which is less than the example's 15. So this is not correct. Hmm. Perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nThe minimal total is (n + m - 1) + (n + m -1) -1 \u2014 but not sure.",

Wait, not sure. alternative approach: trying to find a pattern. Let me compute for n=2, m=2:\n\nThe minimal total is 4 (without any savings). For n=3, m=3:\n\nThe example where they meet at (2,2):\n\nMegan's path is (3,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,3). Steps: 1 up and 1 right, then 1 up and 1 right \u2192 total 4 steps. Stanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (2,2) (2 steps). Then teleport to (1,3) (1 step). Then down to (3,3) \u2192 2 steps. Total 2+1+2=5. Megan's total is 4 \u2192 total 9. Which is worse than 8. Thus, no improvement. Hence the minimal is 8. Thus, the formula for this case is 2*(n+m-2) = 8. So when n and m are equal, the minimal is the sum. But the first example shows it's possible to save. Hmm. Another example: n=3, m=4. Megan's path could be (3,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,4). Steps: 2 up, then 3 right \u2192 total 5. Stanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 teleport to (1,4) (cost 1), then down to (3,4) (2 steps). Total 1+2=3. Megan's total:5. Total 8. Original path would be 3+3-2=4 for Stanley, 3+3-2=4 for Megan \u2192 total 8. So no saving. Hmm. Another example: n=4, m=2. Megan's path: (4,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). Steps: 3 up, then 1 right \u2192 total 4. Stanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 teleport to (1,2) (1 step) \u2192 then down to (4,2) (3 steps). Total 1+3=4. Total is 8. Original paths: Stanley's is 1 (steps: 3 down, 1 right \u2192 4 steps). Megan's is 3 up and 1 right \u21924. Total 8. No saving again. So when m is small, no savings. Hmm, when is savings possible? The first example had n=7 and m=5. The saving was possible because they could teleport to a point that reduced Stanley's path by 5 steps.",

Perhaps I should think of the minimal total energy as the sum of the paths minus the saving from one teleport. In the example, they saved 5 steps (Stanley saved 5 steps). The total was 20-5=15. So the saving is the distance between the two points minus 1. The distance between (1,3) and (7,3) is 6 steps (vertical). So the saving for Stanley is 6-1=5 steps. So the total saved is 5 steps.

Total for Stanley: (m-1) +1 + (n-1) = m-1 +n.\n\nMegan's path: to reach her destination (1,m), she has to go from (n,1) to (1,m). Her steps are (n-1)+(m-1). So total energy is:\n\n Stanley's (n +m-1) + Megan's (n +m-2). Total is 2*(n +m-1) \u2014 1? Wait, (n+m-1) + (n+m-2) = 2n+2m-3. For the example: 2*7 + 2*5 -3=14+10-3=21. No. Hmm. Wait, the saving was n-2, so the total would be (n + m-1 + (n-1 + m-1 )) \u2014 (n-2) ?\n\n Which gives 2n+2m-3 \u2014 (n-2) = n+2m-1. For the example, 7+10-1=16. No.\n\nHmm. But the example's correct answer was achieved when the savings were 5 steps (7-2=5). Thus the formula for the total when taking the maximal saving for Stanley is (n + m-1) + (n + m-2) \u2014 (n-2). Which would be 2n+2m-3 \u2014n+2 =n+2m-1. For the example, 7+2*5-1= 16. Not matching. Hmm. Alternatively, the total energy when using the optimal point (1,m) is:\n\nMegan's path to (1,m) is (n-1)+(m-1) steps. Stanley's path to (1,m) is (m-1) steps right. Then teleport (cost 1) and then down (n-1) steps. Total (m-1) +1 + (n-1) = m-1 +n. Thus the total is:\n\nm-1 +n + (n-1 + m-1) = n +m-1 +n +m-2 = 2n +2m-3. For the example, 2*(7) +2*5-3 =14+10-3=21. Which is higher than the example's 15. Thus this is not the best scenario. The example's solution used a point (7,3) and (1,3), saving 5 steps for Stanley. The saving here is 6 steps (down from (1,3) to (7,3) is 6 steps, replaced by 1 teleport. So saving 5. This is better than the 7-2=5 saving from the previous idea. Thus, the best savings come from choosing a point where the distance between the two points is maximized. Thus, the maximal possible saving is the maximum possible distance between two points on Megan's path, minus 1. The maximal distance between two points along Megan's path is the length of her path, which is (n-1)+(m-1).",

Wow, I missed that possibility earlier. Thus the formula holds. Another test case: n=3, m=3:\n\n The formula's answer is 7.\n\n Which works as explained earlier. Another test case: n=1, m=2.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimal total energy Stanley and Megan need to reach their destinations, considering they can use portals. Hmm. The key here is figuring out the optimal path where using their portals saves energy.\n\nFirst, let's understand the movement. Both can move normally (adjacent cells with 1 power each) or use portals. The portals are left in every cell Megan visits. So Megan's path determines where the portals are available. Since they can choose their movement times, maybe there's a way to coordinate their paths so they can teleport efficiently.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the sum of both their energies. Let's think of the minimal paths for each when they can use portals. \n\nLet me think about the coordinates. The starting points are (1,1) for Stanley and (n,1) for Megan. Their destinations are (n,m) and (1,m) respectively.\n\nThe minimal energy without any portals would be straightforward. For Stanley, it's (n-1)+(m-1) steps, same for Megan. But with portals, maybe they can teleport to save steps.\n\nThe portals are placed in all cells Megan visits. So Megan's path is crucial. To minimize the total, perhaps they should meet at some point where they can use the portal to jump across.\n\nWait, the problem says Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So whenever Megan moves through a cell, a portal is placed there. So the portals are all along her path. So the earliest a portal appears in a cell is when Megan first steps there. But since the problem doesn't require the timing, maybe we can arrange their paths such that they can use the portals optimally.\n\nHmm. Let me think of the minimal total energy. Let me consider some examples. Let's see the first note's example. In that case, Megan moves to (7,3), then to (1,3). So the portals are there. Then Stanley uses that portal. So maybe the key is to have their paths cross at a common point where they can teleport.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is the sum of their individual minimal paths minus some savings from the portals. Or perhaps there's a formula based on n and m.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal total energy can be found by considering that the portals can be used to save some steps. Let me think of the optimal scenario.\n\nSuppose both use portals in such a way that they can teleport at some point. Let's think of the minimal possible. The minimal total would be the sum of their individual minimal paths, but minus the overlapping parts where they can use portals.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is (Stanley's path steps) + (Megan's path steps) minus twice the distance saved by using the portals. But how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal path is when they meet at a certain point where they can teleport. Let me think of the minimal total as the minimal of some expression involving n and m.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 2) * 2 minus some value. Or maybe there's a formula derived from considering their paths.\n\nLet me think of the minimal possible. Let me consider the minimal case where they can use portals in a way that allows maximum savings.\n\nSuppose Megan's path is such that she goes up to the same column as Stanley's destination, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the path where they meet at a certain point. Let me think of the minimal total as (Stanley's path + Megan's path) - 2*(distance saved by using portals). The maximum possible saving would be when they can teleport at some points.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal total energy is (Stanley's path without portals) + (Megan's path without portals) minus something, but the key is that using portals can save them moving some steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is the sum of the Manhattan distances of each path, but with a certain adjustment.\n\nWait, let me think of the minimal possible scenario. Suppose they both can teleport once. The portals are placed along Megan's path. So Megan starts at (n,1). She can choose her path such that she goes through some points that can be useful for both.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is achieved when their paths cross at a common point where they can both teleport, allowing them to skip moving through certain steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total energy is simply 2*(n + m - 2) minus some value. Let me think of small cases.\n\nLet me test some small examples.\n\nTest case 1: n=1, m=1. Then both start and end at the same cell. So their total energy is 0. But according to input constraints, n and m are at least 1. But if n=1 and m=1, the start and end are the same, so 0.\n\nAnother case: n=1 and m=2. Stanley's path is from (1,1) to (1,2): 1 step. Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,2). She can just move right, so 1 step. But Megan's starting point and destination are (1,1) to (1,2). So Megan's path is 1 step. So total is 1+1=2. But maybe using portals? Since Megan leaves a portal in (1,1) when she starts, then when she moves to (1,2), she leaves another portal. So Stanley can use the portal in (1,1) to jump to (1,2), but he starts there. That's not helpful. Wait, maybe the minimal is indeed 2 here.\n\nAnother case: n=2 and m=2. Stanley wants to go from (1,1) to (2,2). Megan from (2,1) to (1,2). The minimal paths without portals: Stanley's path is 2 steps (right then down, or down then right). Megan's path is also 2 steps. So total 4. But with portals, maybe they can do better.\n\nWait, Megan can choose her path, perhaps going up first. Let's think:\n\nMegan's path: (2,1) \u2192 (1,1). Now, she has left a portal there. Then she proceeds to (1,2). So her path is 2 steps (up then right). Total steps Megan: 2. \n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can use the portal here (since Megan left it there when moving through). Wait, Megan's first move is from (2,1) to (1,1). So (2,1) already has a portal (since Megan started there?), but the problem says \"leaves one in each cell she visits (if there is no portal yet)\". Wait, Megan's starting cell (n,1) would already have a portal when she starts?\n\nYes, the problem says \"she leaves one in each cell she visits (if there is no portal yet)\". So Megan starts at (n,1), so that cell has a portal from the start.\n\nSo Megan's path: suppose she goes up to (1,1), then right to (1,2). So Megan's steps are 1 (up from (2,1) to (1,1)), and then right to (1,2): total 2 steps.\n\nStanley's path: he can go from (1,1) to (2,2). Since there's a portal in (1,1), he can teleport from there. Wait, but where else? Megan's path includes (1,1) and (1,2). So the portals are in (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). \n\nSo Stanley can, for example, go from (1,1) to (2,2) directly by moving down and right. That's 2 steps. But maybe he can use a portal. Let's see:\n\nSuppose Stanley goes from (1,1) to (2,1) via the portal. Wait, Megan's starting cell is (2,1), so that has a portal. So Stanley is at (1,1), which has a portal. He can teleport to any other portal. So to (2,1) (starting point of Megan) or (1,1) (same cell?), but that's self. So from (1,1), he can teleport to (2,1) in 1 power. From there, he can go down to (2,2) in 1 step. So total steps for Stanley would be 1 (teleport) + 1 (step right) = 2. So same as before. Hmm, not better.\n\nAlternatively, Megan's path could be different. Let's see if there's a way to have them save more steps.\n\nAlternatively, suppose Megan goes straight to (1,2). Her path is moving up-right? Wait, moving to (1,1) first is necessary to reach (1,2). Wait, maybe Megan's path is (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). So the portals are at (2,1), (1,1) and (1,2). Stanley can choose to teleport from (1,1) to (1,2), but then he needs to get to (2,2). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's see Megan's path. Suppose Megan's path is (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). Then:\n\nStanley's path:\n\nHe can go from (1,1) to (1,2) via the portal (but that's adjacent, so maybe moving is better). Alternatively, he can go down to (2,1) via teleport (using 1 unit), then move to (2,2) (another unit). Total 2 steps, same as before.\n\nMegan's path is 2 steps. Total is 2 + 2 = 4, same as original.\n\nHmm, so maybe in this case, the portals don't help. Then the minimal total is the sum of their individual minimal paths (each 2, sum to 4).\n\nWait another test case. Let's think of n=3, m=3.\n\nStanley needs to go from (1,1) to (3,3). The minimal path is 4 steps (down twice, right twice). Megan goes from (3,1) to (1,3). Her minimal path is 4 steps as well (up twice, right twice).\n\nTotal without portals: 8. But can they use portals better?\n\nSuppose Megan chooses a path that allows them to teleport.\n\nLet's say Megan goes up to (1,1), then to (1,3). Her path is (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). So steps: 4.\n\nThen the portals are along her path. So Stanley can use the portal at (1,1). \n\nStanley's path could be: go to (1,1) (using 0 steps?), wait no. Wait he starts at (1,1). From there, he can teleport to any of Megan's portals. For instance, Megan's path includes (1,3) at the end. \n\nSo, if Megan reaches (1,3), then Stanley can teleport there. So here's the plan:\n\nStanley uses the portal in (1,1) to teleport to (1,3) (using 1 unit). Then from there, he needs to get to (3,3). That would take 2 steps (down twice). So his total steps: 1 (teleport) + 2 (down) = 3.\n\nMegan's total steps: 4.\n\nTotal would be 3 +4 =7, which is better than 8. So here, using portals helps. \n\nAh, so the key is to find a point where both can use a portal to save steps. \n\nSo in this case, Megan's path allows her to reach (1,3) and the portal there, so Stanley can teleport there. But Megan's path must have that point. \n\nNow, how do we find the best point to minimize the total.\n\nThe idea is to find a point (i,j) where both can reach it via their paths, and using the portal there reduces their required steps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be computed by finding the best possible point where they can use the portal to minimize the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( Stanley's minimal steps + Megan's minimal steps ) minus twice the minimal distance from some meeting point. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total is the sum of the individual minimal paths minus the minimal distance between their paths where they can share a portal.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is the minimal between:\n\nOption 1: Stanley's path without any portals plus Megan's path without any portals.\n\nOption 2: They use a common portal point, so that their paths can be split into parts before and after the portal.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal is to choose a point where they can teleport such that the total distance saved is maximized.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nLet me denote the meeting point as (x,y). Then Megan must visit (x,y) as part of her path. \n\nFor Stanley:\n\nHis path can be broken into two parts:\n\n- From (1,1) to (x,y): using normal steps, cost (x-1)+(y-1)\n\n- Then teleport to some other portal point (like Megan's destination?), but wait, the goal is to reach (n,m). Alternatively, maybe he can teleport directly to his destination via a portal, but that would require Megan to have a portal there.\n\nWait, Megan's destination is (1,m). So if Megan reaches there, then Stanley can teleport to it. \n\nWait, Megan's path must end at (1,m). So Megan's path will have a portal at (1,m). So Stanley can teleport to there if he can reach a portal point.\n\nWait, Stanley's destination is (n,m). So perhaps if Megan can place a portal at (n,m), then Stanley can teleport there. But Megan's path is to (1,m), so unless she goes through (n,m), which may not be optimal.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best is to have a meeting point that is on both paths, so that they can teleport from there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total energy is ( (n+m-2) + (n + m -2) ) - 2*(some distance) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is 2*(n + m - 2) - 2* min( ... )\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of the best possible scenario.\n\nThe minimal energy is when they can teleport as early as possible, allowing them to save as many steps as possible.\n\nSuppose Megan chooses her path so that she goes to a position that allows both to save steps.\n\nLet me think of the optimal point. Let's think of the minimal total energy. Let me compute the minimal possible.\n\nSuppose Megan chooses to move in such a way that she can place portals at positions that are advantageous for both.\n\nThe key idea is that once Megan has placed portals along her path, both can use those portals to teleport, saving the steps between their paths.\n\nThe minimal total is the sum of their individual steps minus the twice the minimal path where they can share a portal.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal total is ( (S + M) ) - (2 * distance between the meeting point and their destinations?)\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total can be computed using the formula:\n\nminTotal = (Stanley's path steps) + (Megan's path steps) - 2 * (the minimal distance from their paths' intersection point to their destinations).\n\nAlternatively, the best possible is when they can teleport to a common point and then go from there. Let me model this.\n\nSuppose they meet at point (x,y). Then Stanley travels to (x,y) using (x-1 + y-1) steps, then teleports to Megan's destination (1,m), then from there to his destination (n,m). Wait, but Megan's destination is (1,m), and Stanley's is (n,m). So from (1,m), he needs to move down (n-1) steps. Alternatively, he could teleport again if there's a portal there.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nLet me think of the minimal total energy formula.\n\nI recall that in some problems like this, the minimal total is 2*(n + m - 2) - 2*(min(n,m)), but I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 2) + (n + m -2) - 2* (the minimal distance between their paths). \n\nWait, maybe the minimal can be found by considering that the best they can do is to meet at a point where they can teleport each other's way. Let me think of the paths:\n\nStanley's path is from (1,1) \u2192 (n,m). Megan's path is from (n,1) \u2192 (1,m).\n\nThe minimal total energy will be when they can cross paths at some point (i,j), such that both can use the portal at that point to reduce their total steps.\n\nThe optimal point (i,j) would be the one that maximizes the saved steps.\n\nLet me compute the total steps saved by choosing (i,j).\n\nFor Stanley:\n\nWithout portals: (i-1 + j-1) + (n -i + m -j) \u2192 total (n+m-2).\n\nWith the portal: he can teleport to that point from (1,1) using ( (i-1 + j-1) steps?) wait no. Wait, if he uses the portal at (i,j), he can teleport from any previous portal to there. Wait, perhaps the idea is that if they both reach (i,j) via their paths, then they can teleport between them.\n\nWait, perhaps the best scenario is when they meet at a common point that is along both paths.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is the maximum between (n + m - 2) and the other path's steps minus some overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the minimal total as:\n\nThe minimal total is ( (n-1 + m-1) + (n-1 + m-1) ) - 2* (the minimal distance between their paths' crossing point).\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal distance between their paths is zero if they cross, but I need to think differently.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as the sum of their individual steps minus twice the distance saved by using the portals. The maximum possible saving would be when they can teleport at a point and then move the minimal distance from there.\n\nLet me consider the best possible case where they can both use a common portal to save the most steps.\n\nSuppose Megan's path is such that she goes to (1,1) first, then to (1,m). Then the portals would be along that path. \n\nStanley can use the portal at (1,1) (which Megan already placed since she starts there?), so the portal exists. \n\nWait, Megan starts at (n,1), so that cell has a portal. So the initial portal is there. \n\nWait, Megan's first cell (n,1) already has a portal. Then as she moves, she adds more portals. \n\nSo for example, if Megan moves up to (n-1,1), then that cell gets a portal, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the most optimal is when Megan and Stanley's paths cross such that they can teleport to a point where they can proceed quickly.\n\nLet me try to find the minimal possible total.\n\nThe minimal total energy is when they can teleport as much as possible. \n\nThe best scenario is when the portals are placed such that both can teleport to a point that is close to their destinations.\n\nAlternatively, considering that Megan can choose her path to maximize the number of useful portals for both.\n\nLet me think of the optimal path for Megan such that the portals are placed in a way that helps both.\n\nThe minimal total energy can be derived by considering the following:\n\nThe total energy is the sum of their paths' lengths minus twice the distance saved by using the portal.\n\nThe maximum possible saving occurs when they can teleport at some point, and after teleporting, the remaining steps are as small as possible.\n\nLet me think of their paths as:\n\nStanley\u2019s path: from (1,1) to (n,m). \n\nMegan\u2019s path: from (n,1) to (1,m). \n\nSuppose they meet at some point (x,y) along their paths. Then, Megan must have passed through (x,y) before or at the same time as Stanley. \n\nThe minimal energy would require that they both reach (x,y) as early as possible, then teleport to each other's destinations.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think of the best point where both can teleport.\n\nSuppose Megan's path includes the point (x,y). Then, when Stanley reaches (x,y), he can teleport to Megan's destination (1,m) via a portal there (if Megan has already visited (1,m)). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is:\n\nThe minimal possible is (n + m - 2) for Stanley plus (n + m - 2) for Megan minus twice the distance between the meeting point and their destinations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be found by choosing the best possible meeting point (x,y) where the total saved steps (from both teleporting from that point) are maximized.\n\nBut how to find this (x,y) optimally?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is (2*(n + m - 2)) - 2*(some value). Let's think of the best possible saving.\n\nSuppose they can teleport at some point (x,y), and then proceed to their destinations. The steps saved would be ( (distance from x,y to Stanley's destination) + (distance from x,y to Megan's destination) ) compared to the original path.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too vague. Maybe I can find a formula by considering that the minimal total energy is (2*(n + m -2)) minus 2* the minimal possible distance between their paths' intersection points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal energy is (n+m-2) + (n + m -2) - 2*(something). \n\nAnother idea: The minimal total is the sum of their individual minimal paths minus twice the minimal distance between their paths. \n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal total energy as the minimal between two scenarios:\n\nEither they don't use any portals, or they use a portal at some optimal point. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy can be expressed as the formula (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) - 2* (min(n,m) - 1). But not sure.\n\nWait, let me think of the first example from the note:\n\nIn the note's example, n=7, m=5. The total energy is 15. \n\nOriginal paths would be:\n\nStanley's path: 7 rows, 5 columns. So 6+4 =10 steps. Megan's path: 7 rows up, 4 columns right: 6+4=10. Total 20. But the answer is 15, so saving of 5.\n\nHmm, so the saving is 5. So the formula would be 20 -5 =15. \n\nWhat's the 5 in terms of n and m? \n\n7 and 5's minimal difference is 2 (7-5=2). Or perhaps the saving is (n-1)+(m-1) - (something).\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal energy is 2*(n + m -2) - 2* (something). Let's see:\n\nIn the example, 2*(7 +5-2) = 2*10 =20. The answer is 15, so subtract 5. So 5 is (7 +5 - 2) - something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is 2*(n + m -2) - (min(n,m)*2 - 2). Let's see:\n\nFor the example, min(7,5)=5. 5*2-2 = 8. 20-8 =12, which is not 15. Hmm not right.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total energy is (n-1 + m-1) + (n-1 + m-1) - 2 * (the minimal distance between their paths' intersection point). \n\nWait, the minimal distance between their paths' intersection point could be something like the Manhattan distance between their starting points? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is (n + m -2) + (n + m - 2) - 2 * ( (x + y) - 1 ), where x and y are the meeting point coordinates? Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal energy formula is:\n\nThe minimal total is (n + m - 2) + (n + m -2) - 2 * (the minimal of (x + y) where x and y are the meeting point's coordinates). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal energy is computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal total is the sum of their individual path lengths minus twice the minimal distance between their paths. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal point is where their paths cross. Let me think of their paths as moving in opposite directions.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1) and moves towards (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and moves towards (1,m).\n\nIf they move towards each other, their paths cross at a point (i,j) which is somewhere. The optimal point is such that the sum of the saved steps is maximized.\n\nThe distance saved would be (Stanley's remaining distance after teleporting + Megan's remaining distance after teleporting) compared to their normal paths.\n\nAlternatively, let's model this.\n\nSuppose they meet at point (x,y). Then:\n\nStanley's path before meeting: (x-1)+(y-1) steps.\n\nMegan's path before meeting: (n -x) + (y-1) steps (since she starts at (n,1), moves up (n-x) steps and right (y-1) steps to reach (x,y)).\n\nThen, after meeting, they can teleport to their destinations via portals.\n\nWait, but once they are at (x,y), they can use the portal there to teleport to any other portal. \n\nWait, Megan's path would have included (x,y) because she's going there. So the portal is present. \n\nThen, after reaching (x,y),:\n\nStanley can teleport to Megan's destination (1, m) which is part of her path if she goes there. \n\nWait but Megan needs to go to (1, m). So if she takes the path that includes (x,y), she still has to go from (x,y) to (1, m). \n\nHmm, perhaps after meeting at (x,y), both can teleport to their destinations via another portal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best is:\n\nAfter reaching (x,y), both can teleport to a point that is closer to their destinations.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal scenario is when they choose a meeting point (x,y), such that Megan can then proceed to her destination via teleport, and Stanley can do the same. \n\nThe total steps for Stanley:\n\nSteps to reach (x,y) + 1 (teleport to destination) \n\nSimilarly for Megan: steps to reach (x,y) + 1 (teleport to destination). \n\nWait, but Megan's path must include (x,y), and then she still has to get to (1, m). So unless (x,y) is along her path to (1, m).\n\nWait, perhaps the destination can be considered as a portal. Since Megan's destination is (1, m), once she reaches there, that cell has a portal, so Stanley can teleport there.\n\nAlternatively, let me think in terms of the following strategy:\n\nThe optimal path is when they choose a meeting point (x,y), such that:\n\n- Megan visits (x,y) along her path to her destination.\n\n- The total steps for both is minimized.\n\nThe total steps would be:\n\nStanley's steps to (x,y) + 1 (teleport to Megan's destination, which is (1,m)) + steps from (1,m) to his destination (n,m).\n\nWait, no. Because Megan's destination is (1,m), so once she is there, the portal exists there. So Stanley can teleport there from (x,y) using 1 unit.\n\nThen from (1,m), he needs to go down to (n,m), which requires (n-1) steps. So total steps for Stanley:\n\nsteps to (x,y) + 1 (teleport) + (n-1) \n\nSimilarly for Megan:\n\nsteps from start to (x,y) + steps from (x,y) to her destination (1,m) + 1 (teleport?), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to have both teleport at the meeting point to their respective destinations.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose they meet at (x,y). Then:\n\nStanley can go to (x,y) via normal steps, then teleport to Megan's destination (1,m), then walk to his own destination (n,m).\n\nMegan can go to (x,y), then teleport to Stanley's destination (n,m), then walk to her own destination (1,m). \n\nWait, but Megan's destination is (1,m), so maybe she doesn't need to go there. Wait Megan's path must end at her destination. So perhaps:\n\nMegan's path must end at (1,m). So she can only teleport to that point after reaching it? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps Megan can go to (x,y), then teleport to (1,m) via the portal there. So steps for Megan after reaching (x,y) would be 1 (teleport) to (1,m). \n\nSo total steps for Megan:\n\ndistance from start to (x,y) + 1 (teleport) \n\nSimilarly for Stanley:\n\ndistance from (1,1) to (x,y) + 1 (teleport to (1,m)), then distance from (1,m) to (n,m) is (n-1).\n\nWait, so Stanley's total would be:\n\nsteps to (x,y) + 1 (teleport) + (n-1)\n\nWait but why not teleport directly to (n,m)? \n\nWait Megan's destination is (1,m). So unless Megan has visited (n,m), that cell won't have a portal. So Stanley can't teleport there unless Megan went there. Which she won't, because her destination is (1,m).\n\nAh, so the only way for Stanley to get to his destination (n,m) is:\n\nEither walk from (x,y) to (n,m), or teleport to (1,m), then walk down to (n,m).\n\nHmm, so the best is to teleport to (1,m) and then walk down.\n\nSimilarly, Megan can reach (x,y), then teleport to (1,m) (if she hasn't already reached it).\n\nWait, but Megan's path must end at (1,m), so she must reach there eventually. So the best is to choose (x,y) as a point along her path before (1,m).\n\nSo Megan's path would be:\n\nstart at (n,1) \u2192 go to (x,y) \u2192 then to (1,m).\n\nSo the steps for Megan would be:\n\ndistance from (n,1) to (x,y) + distance from (x,y) to (1,m)\n\nPlus the 1 for teleporting? No, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, the total steps for Megan would be:\n\ndistance from (n,1) to (x,y) + distance from (x,y) to (1,m).\n\nThen, in addition, she can use the portal when she reaches (x,y), but how does that help?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the optimal point as where their paths cross in a way that maximizes the savings.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal total is the minimal between Stanley's path plus Megan's path minus the distance between their paths' closest point, multiplied by two.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the best possible scenario where they can teleport once. The minimal total energy is:\n\nStanley\u2019s distance to some point x plus Megan\u2019s distance to x, then both teleport (cost 1 each), then go to their destinations.\n\nWait, but the teleportation allows them to jump to any portal. So perhaps the best is to choose a point where both can teleport to their destinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total energy is:\n\n( (a + b) + (c + d) ) - 2 * (overlap?), where a and c are path parts before the teleport, and b, d after.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal energy can be expressed as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is (n + m - 2) + (n + m -2) - 2 * min( (x + y - 1) + ( (n -x) + (m - y) ) ), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I've seen similar problems where the optimal solution is to compute the minimal total as (2*(n + m - 2)) - 2*min(n, m) + 2. Let me see for the example given.\n\nIn the first example from the note:\n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 min is5. So 2*(7+5-2) = 20 \u2192 20-2*5 +2= 20-10+2=12. Not matching the answer of 15. Hmm, no.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's think of the problem as both paths can use the portals optimally to meet at a point and then proceed.\n\nThe minimal energy is the sum of:\n\nFor Stanley: the distance to a point plus 1 (teleport to destination\u2019s portal?), plus the remaining steps.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal total can be computed by choosing the point where Stanley and Megan cross paths such that the sum is minimized.\n\nSuppose they choose a point where they can both teleport to their destinations via existing portals.\n\nAssume Megan's path includes both her destination and Stanley's destination. But that\u2019s not possible unless they are the same, which they aren't.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total can be:\n\nThe minimal between:\n\n1. Both go directly without using portals: total is 2*(n+m-2).\n\n2. They meet at a point (x,y), use portals there, and proceed. \n\nThen, the total would be:\n\nStanley's path to (x,y) + 1 (teleport to Megan's destination) + steps from Megan's destination to his.\n\nMegan's path to (x,y) + 1 (teleport to her destination, but that's her path's end). \n\nWait, this is getting too vague. \n\nLet me think of the example given in the note:\n\nThe example's answer is 15.\n\nFor n=7, m=5:\n\nOriginal paths: Stanley needs to go from (1,1) to (7,5): 6+4=10 steps.\n\nMegan from (7,1) to (1,5):6+4=10. Total 20.\n\nThe answer is 15. So saved 5.\n\nThe explanation says Megan goes to (7,3), then to (1,3). Stanley does the same. Then they use the portal in (1,3) to jump to (7,3).\n\nWait, in the example, the total is (Megan's steps 2+6) + Stanley's (2+1+2) + (2). \n\nWait according to the note:\n\nMegan's steps: moves to (7,3) (which is one move?), then to (1,3). How?\n\nWait in the note's example explanation, Megan moves to (7,3) first. But Megan starts at (7,1). To get to (7,3), that's two steps right (cost 2). Then she goes to (1,3). That would be 6 steps up (7 rows to move from row 7 to row 1, so 6 steps). So Megan's path to (1,3) totals 2+6=8 steps. \n\nThen, Megan proceeds to her destination (1,5). So from (1,3) she moves right twice (cost 2). \n\nTotal Megan's steps: 8+2=10?\n\nWait the note says Megan's part is 2+6+? \n\nThe note says \n\nThe total energy spent is (2+6) + (2+1+2) + (2)=15. Let's see:\n\nMegan's part: 2 (to 7,3) + 6 (to 1,3) \u2192 total 8.\n\nThen she proceeds to (1,5): 2 steps right. So total Megan's contribution is 8+2=10?\n\nBut the note's breakdown shows Megan's part is 2+6+2 =10. \n\nStanley's part:\n\nHe moves to (1,3) (how?) \n\nHe starts at (1,1), moves right 2 steps: cost 2. Then uses the portal in (1,3) to teleport back to (7,3) (cost 1). Then moves down to (7,5), cost 2. So his path is 2+1+2=5.\n\nThen, the total is 10 (Megan) +5 (Stanley) \u2192 15. \n\nAh, so the portals are in (7,3), (1,3), and the other cells along Megan's path. \n\nThe key here is that Stanley used the portal in (1,3) to jump to (7,3), then proceeded. \n\nSo the saving comes from teleporting between those two points instead of moving there normally. \n\nThe total steps saved here are:\n\nInstead of moving from (1,3) to (7,3) (which is 6 steps down), he uses 1 step of power to teleport. So saved 5 steps (6-1=5). \n\nThus, the total saving is 5, hence the total is 20-5=15. \n\nSo the saving is the distance between two points where they can teleport. \n\nThe problem reduces to finding two points where the combined saved steps are maximized. \n\nThe best possible saving would be when the distance between the two points is maximized, because the saved steps are (distance -1) (since teleport costs 1 instead of distance steps).\n\nAlternatively, the maximum saving is achieved when the portals are placed such that they can teleport between two points that are as far apart as possible.\n\nThus, the problem is to find the minimal total energy as the sum of their paths minus twice the maximum possible saving.\n\nThe maximum possible saving for both is to find two points where they can teleport between them, so that the distance saved for both is maximized.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible saving would be the maximum between the two paths' distance between some points. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal path would involve both using a portal at a point such that their paths can intersect and allow maximum teleportation.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 2 + n + m -2) - ( (distance between the two points) -1 ), but multiplied by 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (2*(n + m -2) - 2 * (min(n, m) -1))). \n\nTesting the first example: \n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 min(n,m)=5. \n\n2*(7+5\u20132) =20 \u2192 20-2*(5-1) =20-8=12. Not 15. Hmm, not correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet's consider that the minimal total energy is given by the formula:\n\nminTotal = 2*(n + m - 2) - 2*( (x + y) -1 ) \n\nor something like that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 2) * 2 - (something related to the overlap).\n\nWait, in the example, the saving is 5 steps. That comes from Stanley saving 5 steps (the 6 steps down replaced by 1 teleport). Megan also saved steps? Or was her path not using the portals optimally? \n\nWait Megan's path: she went from (7,1) to (7,3) (2 steps), then to (1,3) (6 steps up), then to (1,5) (2 steps right). Total 10 steps, which is the same as her original path. So Megan didn't save any steps. So the total saving is from Stanley alone using the portal. \n\nHmm, so the saving comes from one person's path. \n\nSo the minimal total energy would be the minimal sum where one of them can make a large saving via a portal placed by Megan's path.\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal possible over all possible paths Megan can take and the paths Stanley can take, to minimize the total energy. \n\nThe key is that Megan can choose her path to allow Stanley to make the maximum possible saving, and vice versa.\n\nTo find the minimal total, we need to choose the best possible path for Megan such that the sum is minimized.\n\nSo the minimal total is the minimal possible over all possible paths of Megan, of (Stanley's path energy + Megan's path energy).\n\nStanley's path energy is the minimal possible given the portals Megan leaves.\n\nHmm, this feels like it requires a formula.\n\nPerhaps the minimal total can be computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is (n + m -2) + (n + m -2) - 2 * (minimum between (n-1, m-1)), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nThe minimal total energy is (2*(n + m - 2)) - 2*min(n-1, m-1).\n\nTesting the example: \n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 min(6,4)=4. 2*(10) - 2*4 \u2192 20-8=12. Not 15. Hmm, no.\n\nAnother idea: the minimal total is (n + m - 2) + (n + m -2) - ( (n-1)+(m-1) -1 ), since the maximum possible saving is the distance between two points.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Let me think differently. \n\nThe minimal total energy can be derived by considering that the best possible scenario is when the two paths meet at a point (x,y) such that both can reach it, and then use teleport to reduce their travel to their destinations.\n\nThe total energy will be the sum of their steps to reach (x,y) plus 2 (to teleport) plus the remainder steps.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. Let's consider that the minimal total energy is the minimal of all possible (S + M) where S is Stanley's path with portals and M is Megan's path. \n\nTo minimize the total, we can compute the optimal path where the portals are placed in such a way that the maximum possible steps are saved.\n\nThe minimal total energy can be found by considering that the best they can do is to use portals in such a way that they can both teleport to a point that is halfway between their paths. \n\nLet me think of the best possible point. Suppose they choose to meet at a point (a, b) which is along Megan's path. \n\nStanley's path to (a,b) costs (a-1)+(b-1).\n\nMegan's path to (a,b) costs (n-a)+(b-1).\n\nThen, after meeting there, they can teleport to their respective destinations. \n\nFor Stanley, the destination is (n,m). To get there, after teleporting from (a,b), he can teleport to any portal, including Megan's destination (1,m) if that's along her path. \n\nWait, Megan must end at (1,m), so that's a portal. \n\nSo after reaching (a,b), Stanley can teleport to (1,m) (cost 1), then walk down (n-1) steps. \n\nSo Stanley's total cost after (a,b) is 1 + (n-1). \n\nMegan's path after (a,b) must continue to (1,m), which requires (a-1) steps (up from row 'a' to row 1) and (m - b) steps right. \n\nThus Megan's total cost after (a,b) is (a-1) + (m -b). \n\nThe total for Megan is her path to (a,b) plus this. \n\nSo overall, the total for Megan is:\n\n[ (n-a)+(b-1) + (a-1) + (m -b) ) ] \n\n= n-a + b-1 +a-1 +m -b \n\n= n + m -2 \n\nSo Megan's total is n+m-2. \n\nStanley's total is:\n\n(a-1 + b-1) + [1 + (n-1)] \n\n= a + b -2 + 1 + n-1 \n\n= a + b + n - 2 \n\nThus, total energy is (a + b + n -2) + (n + m -2) \n\n= a + b + n-2 + n + m-2 \n\n= 2n + m + a + b -4 \n\nTo minimize this, we need to choose a and b such that a and b are as small as possible, but they must be along Megan's path. \n\nWait, but Megan can choose her path to reach (a,b) in any way. \n\nTo minimize the total, we want to minimize a + b. \n\nThe minimal a and b can be is (a=1, b=1), but Megan's path would have to go there. \n\nBut Megan starts at (n,1). To reach (1,1), she would need to move up (n-1) steps, so a=1, b=1 is possible. \n\nThen, a=1, b=1:\n\nTotal energy would be 2n + m + 1 +1 -4 = 2n +m -2 \n\nFor the example n=7, m=5:\n\n2*7 +5 -2 = 14+5-2=17 \u2192 but the example's answer is 15. So this isn't the right path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nWait when a=1 and b=1:\n\nStanley's path to (1,1) is 0 steps. \n\nThen after teleporting from there to (1,m), he needs to walk down to (n,m) \u2192 n-1 steps. \n\nThe total for Stanley is 0 (path to (1,1) ) + 1 (teleport) + (n-1) \u2192 total n steps. \n\nMegan's path to (1,1) is (n-1) steps up. Then she goes from there to (1,m), which is m-1 steps right. \n\nTotal for Megan: (n-1) + (m-1) \u2192 n+m-2. \n\nSo total energy is n + (n+m-2) = 2n +m-2. \n\nFor n=7, m=5 \u2192 14+5-2=17. But the example is 15. So this is not optimal. \n\nSo this path gives a higher total than the example. Hence the optimal path isn't when a and b are minimal. \n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is missing something. \n\nLet me think of the example scenario again. \n\nThe example's total is 15 when they meet at (1,3).\n\nIn that case:\n\na=1, b=3.\n\nSo a + b =4. \n\nThen the total energy would be:\n\n2n + m + a + b -4 \n\n=> 2*7 +5 +4 -4 = 14+5+0= 19 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm, my formula must be wrong. \n\nLet me re-calculate with a=1, b=3:\n\nStanley's path to (1,3) is 2 steps right (from (1,1) to (1,3): cost 2. \n\nThen he teleports to (1,m) (which is (1,5)), cost 1. \n\nThen he walks down to (7,5): 6 steps (7 rows). \n\nSo his total is 2 +1 +6=9.\n\nMegan's path to (1,3): she starts at (7,1), moves right to (7,3) (2 steps), then up to (1,3) (6 steps). Total 8 steps. \n\nThen she goes to (1,5): 2 steps right. \n\nTotal Megan's cost: 8+2 =10. \n\nTotal is 9+10=19. Which doesn't match the example's 15. \n\nHmm, so my previous analysis must be wrong.\n\nWait the example's explanation says Stanley uses the portal at (1,3) to jump to (7,3). Which is not the destination. \n\nAh, right! In the example, they use the portal in (1,3) to teleport to (7,3). \n\nSo the path is different. \n\nLet me re-calculate with that scenario: \n\nThe meeting point is (1,3) and (7,3). \n\nWait, maybe the idea is that they can teleport between any two portal locations. \n\nSo, for Stanley:\n\nHe goes to (1,3) (cost 2). Then uses the portal there (which is in (7,3) also?) to jump to (7,3) (cost 1). From there, he steps down to (7,5): 2 steps. Total: 2+1+2=5.\n\nMegan's path:\n\nShe goes to (7,3) (2 steps right from (7,1)), then up to (1,3) (6 steps). Then right to (1,5) (2 steps). Total 2+6+2=10. \n\nTotal is 5+10=15. \n\nAh, so the saving comes from Stanley using the portal from (7,3)\uff0c which is part of Megan's path to (1,3). \n\n So the point (7,3) is along Megan's path. \n\nSo the meeting points are different: Megan first goes to (7,3), then to (1,3). So the portals are at (7,3) and (1,3). \n\nThus, Stanley can teleport between these two points.\n\nThus, the total energy for Stanley is:\n\nTo reach (1,3) (cost 2 steps) then teleport to (7,3) (1), then move to (7,5) (2 steps).\n\nTotal for Stanley: 2+1+2=5.\n\nMegan's path is: \n\n(7,1) to (7,3) (2), then to (1,3) (6), then to (1,5) (2). \n\nTotal 10.\n\nTotal 15.\n\nSo the key is that Megan's path includes the point (7,3) and (1,3), and Stanley uses the portals between them. \n\nThus, the minimal total energy is computed by finding points where the two can teleport between, and the path's steps are minimized.\n\nThe optimal choice is to find a point (a,b) along Megan's path such that the combined steps for both are minimized.\n\nTo find this, we can model the problem as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is the minimal of the following expression over all possible points (x,y) along Megan's path:\n\nStanley's cost: steps from (1,1) to (x', y') (a point with a portal) + cost to teleport to another portal point (x,y) + steps from there to destination.\n\nMegan's cost: steps from (n,1) to (x,y) (the point where she has the portal) plus steps from (x,y) to her destination.\n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy can be computed using the following formula:\n\nThe minimal total is 2*(m + n - 2) - 2* (min(n, m) -1) \n\nWait, let's see for the example: n=7, m=5.\n\nmin(n,m) is 5. \n\nSo 2*(7+5-2) =20, subtract 2*(5-1)=8 \u2192 12. Not 15. Not right.\n\nHmm. \n\nWait another idea: The minimal total energy is the minimum between (n + m - 2) + (n + m -2), and some other path. \n\nWait, the minimal possible is when they use the portals to save as much as possible. \n\nThe minimal total energy can be derived as follows:\n\nThe minimal path is when they can teleport at a point where the distance between the two paths' crossing is minimized. \n\nThe optimal point is the intersection point of their paths when they move as follows:\n\nStanley moves right and down. Megan moves up and right. \n\nThe paths cross at (x,y) where x = (n +1)/2 or something? \n\nAlternatively, the optimal point is where the sum of the steps saved is maximized. \n\nThe maximal saving for Stanley is when he teleports from a point far from his destination. For example, if Megan's path includes a point that is far from Stanley's destination.\n\nThe maximal saving for Stanley is (distance between point and destination -1). \n\nThe same for Megan. \n\nThe total savings would be the sum of savings from both. \n\nTo maximize savings, choose a point that provides the maximum total saving. \n\nThe maximal saving occurs when the point is as far as possible from both destinations.\n\nBut this is vague. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) - min(2*(n-1), 2*(m-1), 2*(something)). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (2*(n + m -2)) \u2014 (2*(min(n,m) -1)). \n\nWait for the example, 2*(10) \u2014 2*(4)= 20-8=12. No. \n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Maybe I should look for patterns.\n\nLet me try small examples:\n\nExample 1: n=1, m=1. \n\nBoth start and end at the same point. So total energy 0.\n\nFormula: 0.\n\nExample 2: n=1, m=2. \n\nStanley: from (1,1) to (1,2): 1 step. \n\nMegan: from (1,1) to (1,2): 1 step. \n\nTotal without portals: 2.\n\nWith portals, can they save anything?\n\nMegan starts at (1,1). So that has a portal. \n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) via the portal there (since Megan's destination is (1,2), which is the same as her path. \n\nWait, Megan's path is her starting point (1,1) to (1,2). So she leaves portals at both. \n\nSo Stanley can move to (1,2) directly via teleport from (1,1): cost 1. \n\nSo his path is 1 step (teleport). \n\nMegan's path is 1 step right. \n\nTotal is 2 \u2192 same as without portals.\n\nSo no savings possible. \n\nThus the formula should give 2. \n\nExample 3: n=2, m=2.\n\nStanley's path: 2 steps. Megan's path: 2 steps. Total 4.\n\nCan they save?\n\nMegan's path could be (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). \n\nThen: \n\nStanley starts at (1,1). He can teleport to (2,1) (cost 1), then move right to (2,2): total 2. \n\nMegan's path is 2 steps. \n\nTotal 2+2=4. No saving.\n\nAlternatively, if she goes directly:\n\nMegan's path (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2): steps 1 (right) and then 1 up. Total 2. \n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (2,1) (cost 1), then move right to (2,2): 1+1=2 \u2192 total 4. \n\nNo improvement.\n\nSo the minimal is 4.\n\nExample 4: n=3, m=3.\n\nOriginal total: 8 steps.\n\nIf they choose to meet at (1,3), then:\n\nMegan's path: (3,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,3). \n\nSteps: 2 (up) + 2 (right) = 4.\n\nStanley can go to (1,1), then teleport to (1,3) (cost 1), then down to (3,3): 2 steps. \n\nStanley's cost: 0 (if he starts at (1,1)) then teleport and down. \n\nWait, Stanley's path would be:\n\nFrom (1,1) to (1,3): cost 2 steps right. Or he can teleport. \n\nWait, if Megan's path includes (1,3), then the portal is there. \n\nStanley can move to (1,3) normally (2 steps), then teleport to (3,3). No, but his destination is (3,3). \n\nWait, to get to (3,3):\n\nAfter reaching (1,3), he can teleport to (3,1) (Megan's start) and then go right and down. \n\nNo, the optimal would be:\n\nAfter reaching (1,3), he teleports to (3,1) (cost 1), then moves to (3,3) (2 steps). \n\nTotal for Stanley: 2 (to 1,3) + 1 +2 =5.\n\nMegan's path is 4 steps. Total 9, which is worse than the original 8.\n\nHmm, so maybe the best is to meet at (2,2).\n\nMegan's path: (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). \n\nSteps: 1 up, then right, up, right. Total 4 steps.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) (steps: 1 down, 1 right). \n\nThen teleport to (1,3) (part of Megan's path), then down to (3,3). \n\nWait this is getting too complicated. \n\nThe minimal in this case according to earlier thinking is when they can save 2 steps, leading to total 6. \n\nWait I'm stuck. \n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nThe minimal total energy is 2*(n + m - 2) - 2*min(n, m).\n\nTesting the first example:\n\n7+5-2=10 \u2192 2*10 =20 -2*5=10 \u2192 10. No.\n\nThe example's answer is 15. So not right.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal total energy is (n-1 + m-1) *2 - max(n,m) +1.\n\nFor the first example:\n\n(6+4)*2-7+1= 20-6=14. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the minimal possible total as the sum of both paths, minus the distance between their paths' closest points multiplied by 2. \n\nThe closest path between their paths is the diagonal? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible total energy is computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal total is (n + m - 2) + (n + m -2) - 2* (the minimal distance between their paths' intersection point).\n\nBut I'm not getting anywhere.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern with the examples.\n\nThe first example gave 15 when n=7, m=5. \n\nLet me compute for n=7 and m=5:\n\nThe formula I need to find must give 15.\n\nLet's see:\n\nPossible formula: (n + m) * 2 -3 \u2192 12*2-3=21. No. \n\nAnother: (n-1 + m-1) + (n-1 + m-1) - ( (n-1) + (m-1) -1 ) \u2192 10+10-9= 11. No.\n\nHmm, 15 is the example's answer. \n\nAnother idea: the minimal total is (n + m - 2) * 2 - (n + m -2 - max(n,m)+1).\n\nFor n=7 m=5: max is7.\n\nSo (10)*2 - (10 -7+1)= 20-4=16. Close but not 15.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal can be computed as the minimum between the following four possible paths:\n\n1. They move without any portals: total 2*(n+m-2).\n\n2. They meet at (1,1): total is 2n + m-2.\n\n3. They meet at (n,1): total is n+m-2 + n + m-2 \u2014 but not sure.\n\nHmm, this is taking too long. Maybe I should look for a pattern.\n\nThe first example's n=7, m=5: answer 15.\n\n15 = 7+5 +7+5 - (some value) ?\n\n7+5=12 \u2192 12+12-9=15? 9 comes from where?\n\nAlternatively, 7*2 +5= 19 no.\n\nAlternatively, 7+5 +7-1+5-1 = 15+10=25 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal total is (n + m -1) *2 -1.\n\nFor example, (7+5-1)*2-1=11*2-1=21. Nope.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait I think I need to think differently. \n\nThe minimal total energy is the sum of both of their minimal paths minus twice the maximal possible savings.\n\nThe maximal possible savings come from the maximum of the distance between two points they can teleport between.\n\nThe maximum possible savings for both is when they can teleport between two points that are as far apart as possible.\n\nThe farthest possible distance between two points is the total length of the grid, e.g. (n+m-2).\n\nBut they can't teleport between the two corners because Megan's path can't reach there unless she goes all the way.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the maximal saving for one person is (distance between two points) -1, since teleportation costs 1 instead of the distance.\n\nThe total saving is the maximum possible saving for both.\n\nThus, the minimal total is (sum of individual paths) - 2*(max_saving).\n\nThe maximal possible saving occurs when the two choose to teleport between two points that are as far as possible.\n\nThe farthest point Megan can reach such that Stanley can use it.\n\nAssume Megan chooses to go to the furthest point from her destination, then Stanley uses that to teleport.\n\nAlternatively, the maximal saving for Stanley is the distance from his starting point to destination -1 (by teleporting directly from start to destination, but Megan must have placed a portal there. Which she can't, because she starts at (n,1).\n\nThus the maximal saving for Stanley would be the distance from a point on Megan's path to his destination.\n\nTo maximize this, that point should be as far as possible from his destination.\n\nSimilarly for Megan.\n\nThe maximal combined saving would be the maximum over all possible points (x,y) that are on Megan's path of (distance from (x,y) to Stanley's destination) + (distance from (x,y) to Megan's destination) -2 (because each uses teleport for that distance).\n\nThus, the total saved is [ (d1 + d2) -2*1 ] \n\nWhere d1 is the distance from (x,y) to Stanley's destination, and d2 to Megan's destination.\n\nThe maximal saving would thus be (d1 +d2) - 2.\n\nThe total energy would be (sum of paths) - (d1 +d2 -2).\n\nTo find the maximal saving, we need to find the minimal (d1+d2), because we subtract that minus 2 from the total.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is sum_paths - (saving). \n\nThe saving is (d1 +d2) - 2.\n\nThus to get the maximal saving, we need to maximize (d1 +d2) \u2014 2.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the maximal saving for a point (x,y) is (d_s + d_m) \u2014 2, where d_s is the distance from (x,y) to Stanley's destination, and d_m to Megan's destination.\n\nWe need to find the maximal of (d_s +d_m \u2014 2) over all points (x,y) on Megan's path.\n\nThe maximal possible (d_s +d_m) would be when (x,y) is as far as possible from both destinations.\n\nThe farthest point from both destinations?\n\nThe point (1,1) is far from both destinations (n,m) and (1,m).\n\nDistance to Stanley's destination: (n-1)+(m-1).\n\nDistance to Megan's destination: (m-1).\n\nSum: (n+m-2) + (m-1) = n+2m-3.\n\nThis would give a saving of (n+2m-3) -2 = n+2m-5.\n\nThe total energy would be 2*(n+m-2) - (n+2m-5) \n\n= 2n + 2m-4 -n-2m+5 =n+1.\n\nFor n=7, m=5 \u21927+1=8, which is less than the example's 15. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nThe minimal total is (n + m - 1) + (n + m -1) -1 \u2014 but not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to consider that perhaps the minimal total is computed as follows:\n\nThe minimal total energy is the minimum between the sum of their paths and the scenario where they meet at a certain optimal point, which can be represented as (n + m -1). \n\nWait, not sure. \n\n alternative approach: trying to find a pattern.\n\nLet me compute for n=2, m=2:\n\nThe minimal total is 4 (without any savings).\n\nFor n=3, m=3:\n\nThe example where they meet at (2,2):\n\nMegan's path is (3,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,3). \n\nSteps: 1 up and 1 right, then 1 up and 1 right \u2192 total 4 steps.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 (2,2) (2 steps). \n\nThen teleport to (1,3) (1 step). Then down to (3,3) \u2192 2 steps. Total 2+1+2=5.\n\nMegan's total is 4 \u2192 total 9. Which is worse than 8.\n\nThus, no improvement.\n\nHence the minimal is 8.\n\nThus, the formula for this case is 2*(n+m-2) = 8.\n\nSo when n and m are equal, the minimal is the sum.\n\nBut the first example shows it's possible to save.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother example: n=3, m=4.\n\nMegan's path could be (3,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,4). \n\nSteps: 2 up, then 3 right \u2192 total 5.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 teleport to (1,4) (cost 1), then down to (3,4) (2 steps). \n\nTotal 1+2=3. \n\nMegan's total:5. Total 8. \n\nOriginal path would be 3+3-2=4 for Stanley, 3+3-2=4 for Megan \u2192 total 8. So no saving.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother example: n=4, m=2.\n\nMegan's path: (4,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2).\n\nSteps: 3 up, then 1 right \u2192 total 4.\n\nStanley's path: (1,1) \u2192 teleport to (1,2) (1 step) \u2192 then down to (4,2) (3 steps). Total 1+3=4. \n\nTotal is 8.\n\n Original paths: Stanley's is 1 (steps: 3 down, 1 right \u2192 4 steps). Megan's is 3 up and 1 right \u21924. Total 8. No saving again. \n\nSo when m is small, no savings.\n\nHmm, when is savings possible?\n\nThe first example had n=7 and m=5. The saving was possible because they could teleport to a point that reduced Stanley's path by 5 steps.\n\nThe key is that the point chosen allows one of them to teleport to a point that dramatically reduces their remaining steps.\n\nThe formula must be derived based on the maximum distance between two points that can be used for teleportation.\n\nThe minimal total energy can be computed as the minimum between the sum of the paths and ( (n-1)+(m-1) ) + ( (n-1)+(m-1) ) - 2*( the minimal of n and m minus 1).\n\nWait, for the example:\n\nn=7, m=5: min(n,m) is5. 5-1=4.\n\n2*4=8. 20-8=12. Not 15.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is (n + m -2) *2 - (min(n,m)*2 -2).\n\nFor the example: 10*2 - (5*2-2) =20-8=12. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think of the example's answer again. The total is 15.\n\n15 is equal to (7-1)+(5-1)*3. 6+12=18. No.\n\nWait, the example's optimal path is:\n\nMegan's path steps: 2 (to (7,3)) + 6 (up to (1,3)) + 2 (to (1,5)) \u2192 total 10.\n\nStanley's steps: 2 to (1,3), then 1 to teleport to (7,3), then 2 steps down to (7,5). Total 5.\n\nTotal is 15, which is (7+5)*2 - 4 \u2192 12*2 \u20144=20-4=16? No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is 2*(n + m -2) - (n + m - (max(n,m) - min(n,m)))\uff1f\n\nFor example:\n\nmax(7,5) - min=2. \n\nThus 7+5-2=10. \n\n20-10=10. \n\n:No.\n\nAlternatively, the formula could be:\n\nThe minimal total is (n+m-1)*2 -1. \n\nFor example: (7+5-1)*2-1 =11*2-1=21. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal total energy can be computed as follows:\n\nThe best they can do is meet at the point (1, m) or (n, 1), but those might not be optimal.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is computed as:\n\nThe minimal possible is the minimum between:\n\nStanley's path length + Megan's path length,\n\nor \n\nStanley's path length without using portals + Megan's path length using her path to provide portals for him,\n\nor similarly for other combinations.\n\nThe optimal point is where they meet at the point (1,m) or (n,1), but:\n\nIf they meet at (1,m):\n\nMegan must reach there. Her path would be from (n,1) to (1,m). \n\nMegan's steps: (n-1)+(m-1).\n\nStanley can take his path to (1,m) then teleport. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is n + m - 1 + n + m - 1 - 1.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAfter trying many approaches and not finding the formula, perhaps I should look for a pattern in the examples.\n\nThe example's answer of 15 for n=7 and m=5.\n\n7+5 =12 \u2192 15 = 12 +3 \u2192 not sure.\n\nAlternatively: 7+5-1 +7+5-1 - (something).\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is (n+m-1) + (n+m-1) -1.\n\nFor example 7+5-1=11 \u2192 22-1=21. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait I think the correct formula is (2*(n + m - 2)) - (min(n,m) * 2 - 2). \n\nFor the first example:\n\n min is5. 5*2-2=8. 20-8=12. Not 15. \n\nHmm.\n\nAnother possibility:\n\nThe minimal total is (n-1 + m-1) *2 - (n + m - 2).\n\nFor example: (6+4)*2 -10 = 20-10=10. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to consider that the minimal total energy is (2*(n + m \u2014 2) \u2014 (min(n,m) \u2014 1)* 2.\n\n For example:\n\nmin(7,5)=5 \u2192 (5-1)*2=8. 20-8=12. Still no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is (n + m\u2212 2) + (n + m\u2212 2) \u2212 (\\\\( (n-1) + (m-1) - (\\\\( (n-1) + (m-1) ) / 2) )) \u8fd9\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb.\n\nPerhaps I should think of the minimal total energy as the sum of the paths minus the saving from one teleport.\n\nIn the example, they saved 5 steps (Stanley saved 5 steps). The total was 20-5=15. \n\nSo the saving is the distance between the two points minus 1.\n\n The distance between (1,3) and (7,3) is 6 steps (vertical). \n\nSo the saving for Stanley is 6-1=5 steps. \n\nSo the total saved is 5 steps.\n\nMegan didn't save any steps in that case.\n\nSo the total saved is 5.\n\nTo generalize, the maximal saving is the maximum possible distance between two points along Megan's path, because that allows one person to save (distance - 1).\n\nThus, the minimal total energy is the sum of their paths minus (max_distance_between_two_points_on_Megan's_path \u2014 1).\n\nThe maximum distance between any two points on Megan's path is the path itself.\n\nThe longest possible path Megan can take is the full path from her start to her destination, which has length (n-1) + (m-1).\n\n Thus, the maximal possible saving is ( (n-1)+(m-1) -1 ), because she can choose two endpoints.\n\n But in that case, the saving would be (n+m-2-1) = n+m-3.\n\n Total energy would be 2*(n+m-2) \u2014 (n+m-3) = n+m-1.\n\n For example 1: 7+5-1=11. No, example' s answer is 15. \n\nHmm.\n\n Alternatively, the maximal distance between two points along Megan's path is the length of her path, so the maximum possible saving is the distance between the two ends of her path minus 1.\n\n That distance is the path length: (n-1) + (m-1).\n\n Thus, the saving would be that distance minus 1.\n\n But then the total would be 2*(n+m-2) \u2014 ( (n+m-2) -1 ) ) = n+m-1 + 1 = n+m-1.\n\n For example:7+5=12. 12-1=11, which is not the example's answer.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps the correct formula is (n + m - 1) * 2 \u2014 1. \n\nFor the example: 11*2-1 =21. No. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is (n-1 + m-1) + (n-1 + m-1) \u2014 ( (n-1) + (m-1) \u2014 (min(n,m)-1) )). \n\n Not sure.\n\n Another Idea: the minimal total is the sum of the two paths minus twice the minimal of (n-1, m-1).\n\n For example:\n\n2*(10) \u2014 2*4=20-8=12. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the minimal total is computed as follows:\n\n The minimal total is (n + m - 1) * 2 \u2014 2. \n\n For the example: (7+5-1)*2-2= 11*2-2=20. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to think of the problem differently.\n\nThe key is that Megan leaves portals in every cell she visits. So the best way to minimize the total is to have the portals placed such that both can teleport to a point which allows them to save the most steps.\n\nThe minimal total energy is the sum of the Manhattan distances of their paths minus twice the maximum possible savings possible by using a single teleport.\n\nThe maximum possible savings for one person is the distance between two points minus 1.\n\nThe maximal possible savings between two points would be the distance between Megan's starting point and her destination, which is (n-1)+(m-1). But she can\u2019t use that because the two points are the start and end.\n\nAlternatively, the maximal savings for Stanley is the distance between the point where he teleports from and his destination.\n\nTo maximize this, he should teleport from as far as possible from his destination.\n\nThe farthest point from his destination (n,m) is (1,1). The distance is (n-1)+(m-1). \n\nIf he can teleport from (1,1) to his destination, the saving is that distance minus 1.\n\nBut Megan must visit that destination for the portal to exist there, which she won't because her destination is (1,m).\n\nThus the farthest point where the destination has a portal is her destination.\n\nFor Stanley, the distance to Megan's destination (1,m) is (n-1) + (m -m) =n-1.\n\n So the saving would be (n-1) \u20141 =n-2.\n\n Thus, the total saved is n-2.\n\n The total energy would be 2*(n+m-2) - (n-2) = 2n+2m-4 -n+2 = n + 2m-2.\n\n For the example:7 + 2*5-2=7+10-2=15. Which matches the example.\n\n Aha! This is promising.\n\n Let me test this formula.\n\n The formula would be: total = (n + 2*m -2) if we are taking the savings from Stanley's perspective.\n\n Or perhaps the formula is:\n\nThe maximal saving for Stanley is the distance between the portal point to his destination minus 1.\n\nThe best possible portal point for him is Megan's destination (1,m).\n\n The distance from there to his destination (n,m) is (n-1) steps down.\n\n So the saving is (n-1 -1) = n-2.\n\n Thus the total energy is:\n\n Stanley's path: he can go to Megan's destination (1,m) via any path and teleport. \n\n The steps for Stanley would be the steps to (1,m) plus 1 (teleport) plus 0 (since he's already at his destination? No, his destination is (n,m).\n\n Oh wait, Megan's destination is (1,m). So Stanley can teleport there, then walk down to (n,m). \n\nThe steps for Stanley would be:\n\nPath to (1,m): (1,m) is (m-1) steps to the right from (1,1). \n\nSo steps to (1,m) is (m-1).\n\n Then teleport costs 1. \n\n Then walking down (n-1) steps. \n\n Total for Stanley: (m-1) +1 + (n-1) = m-1 +n.\n\nMegan's path: to reach her destination (1,m), she has to go from (n,1) to (1,m). Her steps are (n-1)+(m-1).\n\n So total energy is:\n\n Stanley's (n +m-1) + Megan's (n +m-2).\n\n Total is 2*(n +m-1) \u2014 1? \n\nWait, (n+m-1) + (n+m-2) = 2n+2m-3.\n\nFor the example: 2*7 + 2*5 -3=14+10-3=21. No.\n\nHmm.\n\n Wait, the saving was n-2, so the total would be (n + m-1 + (n-1 + m-1 )) \u2014 (n-2) ?\n\n Which gives 2n+2m-3 \u2014 (n-2) = n+2m-1. \n\n For the example, 7+10-1=16. No.\n\nHmm.\n\n But the example's correct answer was achieved when the savings were 5 steps (7-2=5). \n\nThus the formula for the total when taking the maximal saving for Stanley is (n + m-1) + (n + m-2) \u2014 (n-2).\n\n Which would be 2n+2m-3 \u2014n+2 =n+2m-1.\n\n For the example, 7+2*5-1= 16. \n\n Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\n Alternatively, the total energy when using the optimal point (1,m) is:\n\nMegan's path to (1,m) is (n-1)+(m-1) steps.\n\nStanley's path to (1,m) is (m-1) steps right. Then teleport (cost 1) and then down (n-1) steps. Total (m-1) +1 + (n-1) = m-1 +n.\n\nThus the total is:\n\nm-1 +n + (n-1 + m-1) = n +m-1 +n +m-2 = 2n +2m-3.\n\n For the example, 2*(7) +2*5-3 =14+10-3=21. Which is higher than the example's 15.\n\nThus this is not the best scenario.\n\nThe example's solution used a point (7,3) and (1,3), saving 5 steps for Stanley.\n\n The saving here is 6 steps (down from (1,3) to (7,3) is 6 steps, replaced by 1 teleport. So saving 5.\n\n This is better than the 7-2=5 saving from the previous idea.\n\n Thus, the best savings come from choosing a point where the distance between the two points is maximized.\n\n Thus, the maximal possible saving is the maximum possible distance between two points on Megan's path, minus 1.\n\n The maximal distance between two points along Megan's path is the length of her path, which is (n-1)+(m-1).\n\n Thus, the maximal possible savings would be that distance minus 1.\n\n But that would mean the total is 2*(n+m-2) \u2014 ((n+m-2) \u20141) = n+m-1.\n\n For the example: 12-1= 11. No.\n\nHmm.\n\n Alternatively, the maximum distance between two points that Megan can choose is the distance between her starting point and her destination, which is (n-1)+(m-1). \n\n Thus the maximal savings is that distance minus 1. \n\nThe total would be 2*(n+m-2) \u2014 ( (n+m-2) \u20141 ) = n+m-1.\n\n For the example: 7+5-1= 11. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\n I'm really stuck now. Maybe I should look for the pattern in the first example.\n\nIn the example:\n\nn=7, m=5 \u2192 the answer is 15.\n\n15 = (7-1) + (5-1) \u00d73 \u2192 6+12=18 no.\n\nAnother idea: The minimal total energy is (n+m-1) \u00d7 2 \u2014 1.\n\n For the example: (11) \u00d72 \u20141 =22-1=21. No.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait the example's answer is 15. 15 is 7+5 +3 \u2192 not sure.\n\nWait 7+5 =12. 12+3=15. \n\n3 could be min(n,m) - something.\n\n5-2=3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively the formula is (n + m) *3//2 \u2014 something.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: The minimal total energy is (n + m -1) multiplied by 2 minus the maximum of n and m.\n\n For example 7+5-1 =11 \u2192 22-7=15. Yes! \n\nThat works for the first example:\n\n2*(7+5-1) - max(7,5) =2*11-7=22-7=15.\n\nFor the second example where n=2 and m=2:\n\n2*(3) -2 =6-2=4 \u2192 matches.\n\nFor the n=3, m=3 case:\n\n2*(5) -3= 10-3=7. But the minimal total there was 8. \n\nWait that's conflicting. \n\nWait for n=3,m=3:\n\nmax(n,m) is3. \n\n2*(3+3-1) -3\u2192 2*5-3=10-3=7. But the minimal total was 8, so no.\n\nHmm, this formula works for the first example and the second example but not for the third.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait the third case: n=3, m=3:\n\nThe minimal total was 8. \n\nUsing the formula gives 7. But how?\n\nMaybe there is a mistake in the previous analysis. \n\nIf the formula gives 7, but the example I thought it was 8, perhaps the formula is correct and my analysis was wrong.\n\nLet me re-calculate for n=3 and m=3:\n\nUsing the formula: 2*(3+3-1) -3= 2*5-3=10-3=7.\n\nHow to achieve this?\n\nMegan could choose a path that allows Stanley to save 3 steps.\n\n For example:\n\nMegan chooses to go to (1,1) first, then to (1,3).\n\nHer path: from (3,1) up to (1,1) (2 steps), then right to (1,3) (2 steps). Total 4 steps.\n\nStanley's path: from (1,1) to (1,3) (2 steps), then teleport to Megan's destination (1,3), then down to (3,3) \u21922 steps down. \n\nWait, but he is already at (1,3). So he can teleport to (3,1) (Megan's start), then down to (3,3). \n\nAlternatively:\n\nStanley's path: \n\nPath to (1,1): 0 steps.\n\nTeleport to (1,3) via the portal there (cost 1).\n\nThen down to (3,3): 2 steps. \n\nTotal: 0+1+2=3.\n\nMegan's steps: 4.\n\nTotal is 7. Which matches the formula.\n\nAh, so I must have miscalculated earlier. \n\nThus the formula seems to work.\n\nTesting for the third example:\n\nThe minimal total is 7, according to the formula.\n\nThus the formula is:\n\nThe minimal total energy is 2*(n + m -1) - max(n, m).\n\nLet me verify with the first example:\n\n2*(7+5-1) \u20147=2*11-7=22-7=15. Correct.\n\nFor n=2, m=2:\n\n2*(3) -2 =6-2=4. Correct.\n\nFor n=1, m=1: 2*(1) -1=1. But the correct is 0.\n\nHmm, but when n or m is 1?\n\nFor n=1, m=1:\n\nThe formula gives 2*(1+1-1) \u20141 = 2*1\u20141=1. But the correct is 0.\n\n So the formula needs an adjustment for cases where either n or m is 1.\n\nWait in that case, the paths are overlapping. \n\nEither n or m being 1:\n\nCase n=1, m=1:\n\nThey start and end at the same point. So energy is 0.\n\nThe formula gives 1 which is wrong.\n\nCase n=1, m=2:\n\nFormula: 2*(1+2-1) \u20142= 2*2-2=2. Correct.\n\n The total energy is 2, which matches.\n\n So the formula works when at least one of n or m is greater than 1.\n\n Thus, the formula is:\n\n minimal energy = 2*(n+m-1) - max(n, m) \n\n Unless n==1 and m==1, in which case it's 0.\n\n But how to handle that case in code?\n\n Well, when n==1 and m==1, output 0. \n\n Otherwise, use the formula.\n\n Let me test another case where n=3, m=1.\n\n The formula gives 2*(3+1-1) \u20143 =2*3-3=3. \n\n The paths:\n\n Stanley: from (1,1) to (3,1): 2 steps down. \n\n Megan from (3,1) to (1,1): 2 steps up. \n\n Total is4.\n\n Using the formula, the answer would be 3. \n\n Which is incorrect. \n\nHmm, thus the formula is not correct.\n\nWait for n=3, m=1:\n\nMegan needs to get from (3,1) to (1,1). \n\nHer path is 2 steps up. \n\nStanley's path is 2 steps down.\n\n Total is 4. \n\n According to the formula:2*(3+1-1) \u20143 \u21922*3-3=3, which is wrong.\n\n So what's wrong here?\n\n The formula's logic: the maximum distance between two points is when they meet at (1,1). \n\nStanley can go to (1,1), then teleport to Megan's destination (1,1), but that's the same point. \n\nThus no savings. \n\nThus the minimal total is 4, but formula gives 3.\n\n Thus the formula is not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\n This suggests the formula is only valid when both n and m are at least 2.\n\n But even then, in the third example (n=3, m=3) it works.\n\nHmm.\n\n Alternative approach: Let's see for the test case n=3, m=1:\n\n The optimal path is to have them move without using portals. So total is 2+2=4.\n\n Can they use portals?\n\nMegan's path is (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 (1,1). \n\nShe leaves portals in all cells she visits.\n\nStanley can teleport from his starting point (1,1) to Megan's start (3,1) via portal.\n\n Thus his path: \n\n He can teleport from (1,1) to (3,1): cost 1. Thus he doesn't need to move down. \n\n Thus his total is 1.\n\n Megan's path is 2 steps. \n\n Total is 3. Which is better than 4. \n\n Ah, so the formula gives 3, which is correct!\n\nWait, yes:\n\nStanley's path:\n\nHe starts at (1,1). \n\nHe can use the portal there to reach any other portal, including Megan's starting point (3,1).\n\n Thus he can teleport there in 1 unit of power. \n\n Then he is already at his destination (3,1). \n\n Thus his total is 1.\n\nMegan's path is 2 steps.\n\n Total is 1+2=3. \n\n Thus the formula's answer is correct.\n\nWow, I missed that possibility earlier.\n\n Thus the formula holds.\n\n Another test case: n=3, m=3:\n\n The formula's answer is 7.\n\n Which works as explained earlier.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=2.\n\nThe formula gives 2*(1+2-1) -2 \u2192 2*2-2=2. \n\n Which is correct.\n\nThus the formula holds.\n\n Thus the general formula is:\n\n if (n == 1 && m ==1) then 0 else 2*(n + m -1) - max(n,m).\n\nThus the code would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nif n==1 && m==1 \u2192 print 0.\n\nelse \u2192 compute 2*(n+m-1) \u2014 Math.max(n, m).\n\n Thus the code should implement this.\n\nNow, let's see the first example:\n\n7+5-1= 11 \u2192 multiply by 2:22. subtract max(7,5)=7 \u2192 15. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, m=1:\n\n3+1-1=3 \u2192 2*3=6 -3=3. Correct.\n\nFor n=1 and m=1 \u2192 0.\n\nFor n=2 and m=2 \u2192 2*(3) -2=4.\n\nThus this seems correct."
