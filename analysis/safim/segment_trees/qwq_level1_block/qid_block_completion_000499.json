    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem again carefully. \n\nThe problem says that for each query, given x and y, we have to find the maximum total value of items received for free. The condition is that if a customer buys at least x items, then the y cheapest ones among them are free. The goal is to maximize the sum of those y cheapest items. \n\nHmm, so for each query (x, y), the customer will buy exactly some number of items. To get the maximum possible sum of the free items, they should buy as many as possible, but at least x items. Wait, no. Wait, the customer can choose to buy exactly x items, or more. Because buying more than x items would allow them to take the y cheapest among all those items. But to maximize the sum of the y cheapest, maybe it's better to buy exactly x items? Or maybe more?\n\nWait, the free items are the y cheapest among the purchased items. So, to maximize the sum of those y, we need to choose a set of items where the y cheapest in that set are as large as possible. \n\nSo, the optimal strategy is to select the most expensive possible items, but such that when you take the y cheapest among them, their sum is maximized. \n\nWait, let me think. Let's say we have sorted all the prices in non-decreasing order. So p[1] <= p[2] <= ... <= p[n]. \n\nSuppose the customer buys k items, where k >= x. Then, among those k items, the y cheapest ones would be the first y items in that subset. To maximize their sum, we want those y items to be as large as possible. \n\nWait, but how? Let me think of an example. Suppose the items are sorted as [1,2,3,4,5]. If x is 3 and y is 2. Then, the best is to buy the three largest items (3,4,5). The two cheapest in those are 3 and 4, sum is 7. Alternatively, if you buy all 5 items, the two cheapest would be 1 and 2, which sum to 3. That's worse. So in that case, buying exactly x items gives a better sum. \n\nAh right! So the optimal is to choose exactly x items, but the x items should be the x most expensive ones possible. Because then, the y cheapest among them would be the y smallest in that group of x, which are as large as possible. \n\nWait, let me see. Let me think of the sorted array. Suppose the items are sorted in increasing order. So the largest items are at the end. \n\nSuppose we want to choose a group of k items (k >=x) to buy, and then take the y cheapest in that group. To maximize the sum of those y, we need the y smallest in the group to be as large as possible. \n\nThe best way to do this is to choose the largest possible k items, but with k at least x. Because then the y smallest in those k items would be the first y items in that group. \n\nWait, but the group of k items must be chosen such that when you take the y cheapest among them, their sum is maximum. \n\nSo, the optimal is to select the top m items where m is as large as possible but at least x, but then among those m items, the y smallest (i.e., the first y in the sorted list of those m items) would give the maximum sum. \n\nWait, perhaps the best approach is to pick the largest possible group of items where the size is exactly x, because if you take a larger group, the y cheapest would include smaller items. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's say the items are sorted in non-decreasing order. So p[1] is the smallest, p[n] the largest. \n\nSuppose the customer buys exactly x items. To maximize the sum of the y cheapest among them, they should choose the x items with the highest possible prices. Because then the y cheapest in those x items would be the first y of those x items (since they are the largest possible). \n\nWait, no. Wait, the x items chosen would be the x largest items. So the y cheapest among them would be the first y items in that group. For example, if the x items are the top x items (the largest x), then the y cheapest in them are the y smallest in those x, which are the (x - y + 1)th to (x)th? Wait, no. Wait, the x items are the largest, so when sorted, they are p[n - x + 1], p[n -x +2], ..., p[n]. The y cheapest among them are the first y of these, which are the smallest in the group. So their sum would be the sum of the first y elements in this group. \n\nAlternatively, if you take more than x items, say k items where k >x, then the y cheapest would be even smaller. Because the group includes more items, some of which are smaller. \n\nTherefore, the optimal is to choose exactly x items, the x largest ones. Then the y cheapest in them are the first y of those x items. \n\nTherefore, for a given x and y, the maximum sum is the sum of the y smallest elements in the top x elements. \n\nWait, the top x elements are the x largest. So when sorted, the first element in the top x is the smallest among them. \n\nWait, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. So the top x elements are p[n -x +1], p[n -x +2], ..., p[n]. \n\nThe y cheapest among them are the first y elements in this group. So their sum is the sum from p[n -x +1] to p[n -x + y]. \n\nWait, no. Let me see. The group of x items is the last x elements in the sorted array. The first element in this group is p[n -x +1], the next is p[n -x +2], up to p[n]. The y cheapest in this group are the first y elements. So the sum is sum from p[n -x +1] to p[n -x + y]. \n\nWait, but the sum of the first y elements in the top x elements. \n\nTherefore, the sum is the sum of the first y elements in the top x elements. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each query (x, y), compute the sum of the first y elements in the top x elements. \n\nWait, but how do we compute that efficiently?\n\nThe array is already sorted. So the top x elements are the last x elements. The first y elements in those x elements are the first y elements of the last x elements. \n\nWait, the first y elements in the top x elements would be the elements from position (n -x +1) to (n -x + y). \n\nWait, the sorted array is p[1], p[2], ..., p[n]. The top x elements are p[n -x +1], p[n -x +2], ..., p[n]. \n\nThe first y elements in this group are p[n -x +1], p[n -x +2], ..., p[n -x + y]. \n\nSo the sum of those is the sum from p[n -x +1] to p[n -x + y]. \n\nWait, but how do we compute this quickly?\n\nWe can precompute a prefix sum array. Let's see. \n\nThe array is sorted in non-decreasing order. So the prefix sum array is p[1], p[1]+p[2], etc. \n\nWait, in the code given, the code is:\n\nsort(p+1,p+1+n);\n\nfor(i=1;i<=n;i++)p[i]+=p[i-1];\n\nSo the array p is 1-based. The prefix sum array is stored in p as well. So p[i] is the sum of the first i elements. \n\nWait, but the first element is the smallest. So the first x elements are the smallest x. \n\nWait, the problem is that the top x elements are the last x elements in the sorted array. \n\nSo the sum of the first y elements in the top x elements is equal to the sum from (n -x +1) to (n -x + y) in the original array. \n\nWait, but in the sorted array, the elements are in order from smallest to largest. So the top x elements are the last x elements. \n\nThe first y elements in those x elements are the first y elements of the last x elements. \n\nSo the indices in the sorted array would be from (n -x +1) to (n -x + y). \n\nWait, for example, if n=5 and x=3, then the top 3 elements are at positions 3,4,5 (since n-x+1 = 5-3+1=3). The first y elements (say y=2) would be positions 3 and 4. \n\nSo the sum is p[4] - p[2], since the prefix sum up to 4 minus the prefix up to 2 (since p[3] + p[4] = (p[4] - p[2])). \n\nWait, the sum from a to b (inclusive) in the array is p[b] - p[a-1]. \n\nSo in this case, the sum from (n-x+1) to (n-x + y) is p[n-x + y] - p[n -x]. \n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the starting index is s = n -x +1. The ending index is s + y -1 = n -x +1 + y -1 = n -x + y. \n\nSo the sum is p[s + y] - p[s-1]. \n\nWait, the prefix sum array is such that p[i] is the sum of the first i elements. So the sum from a to b (inclusive) is p[b] - p[a-1]. \n\nSo in this case, a is s = n -x +1, and b is s + y -1 = n -x + y. \n\nTherefore, the sum is p[b] - p[a-1] = p[n -x + y] - p[n -x]. \n\nWait, because a-1 is (n -x +1 -1) = n -x. \n\nSo the formula is sum = p[n -x + y] - p[n -x]. \n\nTherefore, for each query (x, y), the answer is p[n -x + y] - p[n -x]. \n\nWait, but what if x is larger than n? No, the constraints say 1 <= y <=x <=n, so x can't be larger than n. \n\nWait, but when x is given, the customer must buy at least x items. Wait, but in the problem statement, the customer can buy any number of items as long as it's at least x. But according to our earlier reasoning, the optimal is to buy exactly x items. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free. The maximum total value is when the customer chooses the best possible set of items. \n\nSo the customer can choose to buy exactly x items, or more. But according to the reasoning, buying more than x items would include more items, which might have lower prices, thus making the y cheapest in the group smaller. \n\nTherefore, the optimal is to buy exactly x items, the x most expensive ones. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each query (x,y), compute the sum of the first y elements in the top x elements, which is p[n -x + y] - p[n -x]. \n\nWait, but let me test this with the sample input. \n\nSample Input:\n\nLooking at the note:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n1 2 3 5 \n\nWait, the example given in the note has first query x=3, y=2. \n\nThe items are [1,2,3,5]. \n\nThe top x=3 items are 2,3,5? Wait no, sorted array is [1,2,3,5]. The top 3 items are 2,3,5? Wait no, the sorted array is in non-decreasing order. The top 3 items are the last 3 elements: 2,3,5? Wait no, the array is [1,2,3,5], so the last 3 elements are 2,3,5? Wait no, the last three elements are 2,3,5? Wait no, the array is 1,2,3,5. The last three elements are 2,3,5?
