Let's see:\n\nIf exclude A: edges between B and C (1 edge \u2192 odd). Sum is 3+4=7. If exclude B: edges between A and C? No, since B is excluded. So edges count 0 (even). If exclude C: edges between A and B (1 \u2192 odd). Sum 5+3=8. So the maximum for odd is 8. The minimal a_i in the component is 3.

Suppose we first compute the maximum possible sum without considering parity. Let this be M, and the number of edges in this subset is E.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Compute the maximum possible sum (without parity constraint) \u2192 M. \n\n- Compute the number of edges in this subset \u2192 E. \n\n- If E is even, then even_max = M, odd_max = M - (minimal a_i in the component).

Alternatively, the difference between even_max and odd_max is the minimal a_i in the component. Wait, in the first example (single edge between A and B with a_A=5, a_B=3):\n\nThe maximum subset is both nodes (sum 8, edges 1 (odd)). To get even parity, we need to subtract the minimal a_i (3). So even_max is 5, and odd_max is 8. The difference is 3. In the triangle example with all a_i=10:\n\nThe maximum subset has sum 30 (edges 3, odd). To get even, subtract 10 \u2192 even_max 20, odd_max 30. Difference 10. In the third example (triangle with a_A=5, a_B=3, a_C=4 and edges A-B and B-C):\n\nThe maximum subset is all three nodes (sum 12, edges 2 (even)). Thus even_max is 12, odd_max is 12 - minimal a_i (3) \u2192 9? \n\nBut earlier calculation showed that the odd_max could be 8. Hmm, this suggests that the approach is not correct. Hmm, perhaps the minimal a_i in the component is the key. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal a_i in the entire graph is the minimal cost to flip the parity. Thus, the overall approach could be: Compute the maximum possible sum without considering parity. If the number of edges in this subset is even \u2192 that's the answer. Else, subtract the minimal a_i in the entire graph. But this might not work in all cases. Wait, let's see the third example where the maximum subset has even edges.

If the maximum subset has odd edges \u2192 even_max is max_sum - min_a, and odd_max is max_sum. Thus, for each component, the even_max and odd_max can be computed as:\n\nmax_sum = sum of a_i for all nodes in the component (since including all gives maximum possible sum). Wait no, the maximum subset may not include all nodes. Wait, the maximum subset is the one that includes all nodes unless excluding some gives a higher sum.",

So to flip the parity of the edges count (from odd to even), we need to exclude a node whose degree (in the entire graph) is odd. Because the number of edges in the subset after excluding the node will be m - degree(node). The change in parity is (m - degree(node)) mod 2. We want this to be even. Original parity is m mod 2 (which is 1, since m is odd). So (m - degree(node)) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 (1 - degree(node) mod 2) mod 2 =0 \u2192 degree(node) mod 2 =1. Thus, the node must have an odd degree. Therefore, to flip the parity, we must exclude a node with odd degree. The minimal cost is the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree.",

Else \u2192 find the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. Subtract this from the total. Wait, this seems promising. Let me test this with the examples.

But the note says 2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the a_i and the unhappiness. Wait the problem says: if member i is not invited, the party gains an unhappiness of a_i. So the total is sum of a_i for all not invited. Thus, to minimize this, we want to invite as many as possible. The maximum subset sum is the sum of a_i for invited members. The total unhappiness is total_a - sum_invited. Thus, to minimize the unhappiness, we need to maximize sum_invited. Thus, the problem is to maximize sum_invited with the number of edges even. Thus, the approach I outlined earlier is correct. So the solution is: Compute the maximum possible sum_invited, which is the sum of all a_i if m is even.",

Thus, the unhappiness is total_a - sum_invited = total_a - (total_a - a_i) = a_i. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum sum_invited when m is odd is (total_a - a_min_odd_degree). Thus, the unhappiness is total_a - (total_a - a_min_odd_degree) = a_min_odd_degree. Wait, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for not invited. If we exclude a node with a_i, then the unhappiness increases by a_i. Thus, the unhappiness is (total_a - sum_invited) = (total_a) - (sum_invited). To maximize sum_invited, we want to exclude as few as possible. Thus, when m is odd, we must exclude one node (with odd degree) to flip the parity. The best choice is to exclude the node with the smallest a_i among those with odd degree. Thus, the maximum sum_invited is total_a - a_min. Thus, the unhappiness is total_a - (total_a - a_min) = a_min. Wait, but what if excluding that node changes the number of edges by an odd number? Yes, because the node has odd degree. Thus, the number of edges after exclusion is m - degree(node). Since degree(node) is odd, m (odd) minus odd is even. Thus, the parity is even. Thus, this is valid. Thus, the solution is:\n\nCompute the total of all a_i. If m is even \u2192 the answer is total_a - total_a (no, wait, the unhappiness is total_a - sum_invited. Wait, the maximum sum_invited is total_a (if m is even). Thus, the unhappiness is total_a - total_a = 0. \n\nWhich matches the first test case's note. If m is odd \u2192 the maximum sum_invited is total_a - a_min (where a_min is the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree). Thus, the unhappiness is total_a - (total_a - a_min) = a_min. Wait, but in the second test case, m is 0 (even), so the answer is 0. The note's second test case's minimal unhappiness is 2. Wait, the note says the second test case's minimal is 2. Hmm, perhaps the second test case has m=0 (so even), so the maximum sum_invited is total_a. The unhappiness is total_a - total_a =0. But the note says the minimal is 2. This suggests a contradiction.

This suggests that perhaps the second test case has m=1. Suppose there is one friend pair between 1 and 2. Then, if you invite both 1 and 2, the cakes count is 1 (odd), which is invalid. Thus, the valid options must have even cakes. The best option is to invite neither 1 nor 2, so the unhappiness is a_1 + a_2 + a_3. Alternatively, invite one of them.

But in a graph with m edges, the sum of degrees is 2m, which is even. Thus, the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. So there must be at least two. Thus, the code can proceed. Now, looking back at the provided code: The existing code has some variables like mass, which is probably the degree array. In the code:\n\nfor each friend pair (x,y), they do:\n\nvecc[i] = vec[x-1] + vec[y-1]; \n\nmass[x-1] +=1, mass[y-1] +=1; Wait, mass is the degree array. Then, in the case when m is even, the code prints 0. But in the first test case, that's correct. But in the second test case (m=0), it would print 0, which matches the note's first case. But in the second test case's note, the minimal is 2. Hmm, perhaps the note's second test case has m=1. Wait, let's think of the second test case in the note:\n\nThe minimal unhappiness is 2. Suppose the a array is [4,5,3], and m=1 (friend pair between 1 and 2). Then, m is odd (1). The degrees are:\n\nnode 1: 1 \n\nnode 2:1 \n\nnode3:0 \n\nThus, nodes 1 and 2 have odd degrees.",

The minimal is 4. Thus the answer would be 4. But the note says 2. Hmm, this is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the a array is [4,5,3], and the minimal is achieved by not inviting 3. Wait, but then the unhappiness would be a_3=3. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the code. The code currently has:\n\nif (m%2 ==0) \u2192 print 0. Else, loop over all nodes with mass[i]%2 ==1 (odd degree), and do something. The code then loops through all m edges and finds the minimal vecc[i], which is the sum of a_i and a_j for each edge. Wait, the current code's approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. Thus, the code should:\n\nIn the else block (m is odd):\n\nInitialize the minimal value to a very large number. Loop over all nodes: \n\n   if mass[i] is odd \u2192 check if a[i] is smaller than current minimal. Then, output that minimal. Thus, the missing code in the for loop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif (mass[i]%2 ==1) \u2192 \n\n   st = min(st, a[i]); Wait, but the code currently has variables like st initialized to 99999999999 (probably a big number). In the code's current structure:\n\nAfter reading the edges, the code has:\n\nif (m%2 ==0) \u2192 print 0. Else:\n\n   for (i=0 to n-1) {\n\n      if mass[i]%2 ==1 \u2192 \n\n         /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   }\n\n   for (i=0 to m-1) {\n\n      st = min(st, vecc[i]);\n\n   }\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", st);\n\nWait, the current code's approach is to find the minimal vecc[i], which is the sum of a_x and a_y for each edge. This is incorrect. The correct approach is to find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. Thus, the missing code should be:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]); Thus, in the for loop over the nodes with mass[i]%2 ==1, we need to track the minimal a_i. The code currently has st initialized to a large number. Thus, the code should be modified as follows: In the else block (m is odd):\n\n   st = a very large number (like 1e18). for (i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n      if (mass[i]%2 ==1) {\n\n          if (vec[i] < st) {\n\n              st = vec[i]; \n\n          }\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", st); \n\nThus, the missing code in the for loop over the nodes is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nBut in the current code, the 'st' is initialized to 99999999999 (which is 1e10?), but in C++, that might be an integer overflow. Wait, the code currently has:\n\nst = 99999999999; \n\nBut 99999999999 is larger than 2^31, so in a 32-bit int, this would overflow. Thus, the code should use a larger type, like long long. But the problem's output requires to print an integer, which can be up to 1e4 * 1e5 = 1e9, so 32-bit is sufficient. But 99999999999 is 1e11, which is larger than 2^31 (2e9).",

But in the current code, 'st' is declared as an int. Thus, the code has several errors. But the problem requires to output only the missing code. The missing code is in the for loop over the nodes (i from 0 to n-1) where mass[i]%2 is 1. The code should set st to the minimum between st and vec[i]. Thus, the missing code is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]); Thus, the code inside the if block (mass[i]%2 ==1) should be:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThus, the answer is to fill in that line.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. The problem is about finding the minimum unhappiness value while ensuring the number of cakes (which is the number of friend pairs both invited) is even. \n\nHmm, the code provided seems to have some parts missing. Let me read through the problem again to understand what's needed.\n\nThe problem states that each member not invited adds a_i to the unhappiness. So, the goal is to choose a subset of members to invite such that the number of friend pairs both invited is even, and the total a_i for those not invited is minimized.\n\nThe approach here probably involves considering whether to include or exclude certain members to adjust the parity of the number of cakes. Since the number of cakes must be even, if the current number is odd, we need to flip the state of some member to make it even. \n\nLooking at the existing code: \n\nThe code reads n and m, then the a_i array. Then for each of the m friend pairs, it stores the sum of their a_i's in vecc[i], and increments the mass array for each member in the pair. Wait, mass[x-1] and mass[y-1] are being incremented. But what's mass here? Maybe it's counting the number of friends each member has? Or perhaps the number of edges in their connected component? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, the code then checks if m is even. If so, it prints 0. That can't be right. Because m is the number of friend pairs, but the actual number of cakes is the number of those pairs where both are invited. So the code's logic here is probably wrong. Because even if m is even, the actual number of cakes could be odd. For example, if only one pair is invited, then cakes is 1, which is odd even if m is even. So that part must be incorrect. \n\nHmm, maybe the code is trying to do something else. Let me think again. The code's current approach might be flawed. Let me think of the correct approach.\n\nThe problem requires that the number of cakes (the number of friend pairs both invited) must be even. To minimize the unhappiness, which is the sum of a_i for all not invited, we can model this as a graph problem where each member is a node, and edges represent friend pairs. The selection of invited members must form a subset where the number of edges in the subset is even.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with a graph and considering parity. The minimal unhappiness would involve choosing to exclude certain nodes to adjust the parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the minimal cost to flip the parity. Let me think of the problem as follows:\n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of all a_i (since if you don't invite anyone, the unhappiness is sum(a_i)), but we can reduce this by inviting some members. However, inviting a member reduces the unhappiness by a_i (since they are not excluded anymore). Wait, actually, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited. So inviting a member reduces the total by a_i. So the problem is to choose a subset S of members to invite, such that the number of edges (friend pairs) within S is even, and the sum of a_i for all not in S is minimized. Which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of a_i for those in S, then subtracting from the total sum. \n\nWait, let me rephrase: The total unhappiness is sum_{i not in S} a_i. To minimize this, we need to maximize the sum of a_i for those in S. So the problem becomes: choose S to maximize sum_{i in S} a_i, such that the number of edges in S is even. Then subtract this from the total sum of a_i to get the minimal unhappiness.\n\nAh, that's a better way to think. So the problem reduces to maximizing the sum of a_i for the selected set S, with the constraint that the number of edges (friend pairs) in S is even. \n\nNow, how do we model this? It's similar to a maximum weight independent set with a parity constraint, but here it's not independent set, but any subset with the edge count even. \n\nHmm, perhaps this can be modeled using a graph and considering the parity. Let me think of the problem as a graph where each node has a weight a_i, and edges are the friend pairs. We need to select a subset of nodes with maximum total weight, such that the number of edges within the subset is even. \n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe the key is to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity. Let me think of the problem as follows:\n\nSuppose we first compute the maximum possible sum without considering the parity. Let that be max_sum. Then, if the number of edges in the optimal subset is even, then that's our answer. If it's odd, then we need to find a way to flip the parity by either adding or removing some nodes, which would cost us some a_i. The minimal such cost would give us the next best option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a graph where each connected component contributes to the parity. Wait, maybe the graph is bipartitioned, and the parity depends on the selection in each component. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each edge contributes to the parity. The total parity is the sum modulo 2 of all edges in the subset. To have the total even, the sum must be 0 mod 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the parity of the number of edges in the selected subset. Let me think of the problem as a maximum weight subset selection with a parity constraint on the edges. \n\nThis feels like a problem that can be handled with dynamic programming on the connected components of the graph. Because the edges between different components don't interfere with each other's parity. So each connected component can be considered independently, and the total parity is the sum of the parities from each component. \n\nWait, that's a good point. The parity of the total number of edges in the subset is the sum (mod 2) of the number of edges in each connected component's subset. So, if the graph is split into connected components, each component's contribution to the parity can be considered separately. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be broken down into each connected component. For each component, we can compute two possibilities: the maximum possible sum when the number of edges in that component is even, and when it's odd. Then, combining these across all components, we need the total parity to be even. \n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Split the graph into connected components.\n\n2. For each component, compute two values: the maximum sum achievable with even edges (even_max) and odd edges (odd_max).\n\n3. The total maximum sum is the product of the choices for each component, such that the sum of their parities is even. \n\nWait, but how do we combine them? Let me think again. For each component, we can choose either even or odd parity, but the total must be even. So the total maximum is the maximum over all possible combinations where the sum of parities is even. \n\nTherefore, for each component, we can track the possible options. Let me think of it as a dynamic programming problem where for each component, we track the best possible sum for each possible parity (0 or 1). \n\nStarting with an initial state of parity 0 and sum 0. Then, for each component, we can choose to take either the even_max (parity 0) or odd_max (parity 1) for that component, and update the total parity and sum accordingly. \n\nThe final answer is the maximum sum where the total parity is 0. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- For each connected component, compute even_max and odd_max.\n\n- Then, combine these across all components to find the maximum total sum with even parity.\n\n- The minimal unhappiness is total_a - this maximum sum.\n\nNow, how do we compute even_max and odd_max for each connected component?\n\nEach connected component can be treated as a subgraph. Let's consider each connected component as a graph. The problem for each component is to choose a subset of nodes to include, such that the number of edges within the subset has a certain parity (even or odd), and the sum of a_i is maximized for that parity.\n\nHmm, how do we compute even_max and odd_max for a connected component?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a DP on the component. Let me think of the component as a tree (since it's connected, but maybe it's a general graph). Wait, but for general graphs, it's complicated. Maybe the component is a tree, but even then, it's not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component can be considered as a graph where each node can be included or not, and the edges contribute to the parity. \n\nWait, the parity is the count of edges in the subset mod 2. So, for a subset S of nodes in the component, the number of edges within S is the number of edges in the component's edge set that are entirely within S. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. Let me think of the problem for a single connected component. Let me denote the component's nodes as V, edges as E. \n\nWe need to choose a subset S of V, such that the number of edges in E that are entirely in S is even (for even_max) or odd (for odd_max), and the sum of a_i for S is maximized. \n\nHmm, how can we model this? \n\nPerhaps for each node, we can decide whether to include it or not, and track the current parity. But for a component with many nodes, this would be computationally expensive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to model this with a DP that tracks the current parity. Let me think recursively. Suppose we process each node and track the possible parities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that flipping the inclusion of a single node can change the parity. \n\nWait, here's an idea: the parity of the number of edges in S is equal to the sum over all edges in E of (indicator that both endpoints are in S) mod 2. \n\nSuppose we have a component. Let's consider all possible subsets S of the component's nodes. The parity is the sum over edges in E of (S includes both endpoints) mod 2. \n\nThe problem is to find the maximum sum of a_i for S with this parity being even or odd. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal way to compute this is to model it as a graph and use some kind of state DP. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component can be considered as a bipartition. Wait, maybe the component's parity can be adjusted by flipping certain nodes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment needed is to find the minimal cost to flip the parity. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nSuppose for a component, the maximum possible sum without considering parity is M. If the number of edges in that subset is even, then even_max is M and odd_max is M - (something). Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference between even_max and odd_max is either 0 or some minimal value. \n\nAlternatively, here's another approach inspired by the problem's constraints. Let me think of the problem as follows:\n\nThe total required parity is even. So, if the current total parity (without any adjustments) is even, then that's acceptable. If it's odd, we need to flip the parity by changing the selection of some nodes. \n\nThe minimal cost to flip the parity would be the minimal cost to change the parity by 1. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by first finding the maximum possible sum without considering the parity. Let's call this S. Then, if the number of edges in that subset is even, then that's the answer. If it's odd, then we need to find the minimal way to adjust the subset to make the parity even, which would involve flipping some nodes (either adding or removing) such that the parity flips. The minimal cost would be the minimal difference between the current S and the adjusted S. \n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment is to find a single edge and flip the inclusion of one of its endpoints. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as a graph where each connected component contributes to the parity. Let me think of each connected component as a separate entity. \n\nSuppose the graph is split into connected components. For each component, we can compute two values: the maximum sum when the number of edges in the component's subset is even (even_max) and when it's odd (odd_max). \n\nThen, the total maximum sum is the product of choosing for each component either even_max or odd_max, such that the total parity (sum of parities) is even. \n\nThe way to compute this is to track for all components the possible parities and their corresponding maximum sums. \n\nLet me think of it as a dynamic programming problem. Let's say we process each component one by one. \n\nInitially, before any components, the best possible sums are:\n\n- parity 0: 0 (since no edges, so even)\n\n- parity 1: -infinity (since we can't have any edges without components)\n\nThen, for each component, we can take the current DP state and for each possible parity (0 or 1), we can choose to take the even_max or odd_max of the component, and update the DP accordingly. \n\nFor example, suppose the current DP has two values: best0 (max sum for parity 0) and best1 (max sum for parity 1). \n\nWhen processing a new component with even_max_e and odd_max_o:\n\nThe new best0 would be max( best0 + even_max_e, best1 + odd_max_o )\n\nThe new best1 would be max( best0 + odd_max_o, best1 + even_max_e )\n\nWait, because adding even_max_e (parity 0) to a previous parity 0 gives 0+0=0, and adding to parity 1 gives 1+0=1. \n\nSimilarly, adding odd_max_o (parity 1) to previous parity 0 gives 0+1=1, and to parity 1 gives 1+1=0 mod 2. \n\nSo the transitions would be:\n\nnew_best0 = max( current_best0 + even_max_e, current_best1 + odd_max_o )\n\nnew_best1 = max( current_best1 + even_max_e, current_best0 + odd_max_o )\n\nWait, no, let me think again. \n\nSuppose the component's even_max gives a parity of 0, and odd_max gives parity 1. \n\nSo for each existing parity (prev_parity) in the DP, and for each choice (even or odd) for the current component, the new parity is (prev_parity + component_parity) mod 2. \n\nSo for each component, the possible transitions are:\n\nFor each possible previous parity (0 or 1):\n\n- choosing even (parity 0) for the component: new_parity = (prev_parity + 0) mod 2. The sum is previous_sum + even_max.\n\n- choosing odd (parity 1) for the component: new_parity = (prev_parity + 1) mod 2. The sum is previous_sum + odd_max.\n\nThus, for each component, the DP transitions can be computed as above. \n\nTherefore, the overall approach is:\n\n1. Split the graph into connected components.\n\n2. For each component, compute even_max and odd_max.\n\n3. Use dynamic programming to combine the components, tracking the best sum for each possible parity (0 or 1).\n\n4. The answer is the maximum sum with parity 0, subtracted from the total a_i sum to get the minimal unhappiness.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to implementing this approach. \n\nBut how do we compute even_max and odd_max for each connected component?\n\nHmm, this is the crux. Let's think of a connected component. Let's model it as a graph. \n\nThe problem for a component is to choose a subset S of its nodes to maximize the sum of a_i for S, such that the number of edges within S is even (for even_max) or odd (for odd_max). \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a DP on the nodes of the component. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component can be considered as a tree (if it's a tree, but it could have cycles). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal way to compute even_max and odd_max is to realize that the difference between even_max and odd_max is either 0 or the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nWait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me think of the following: \n\nSuppose for a component, the maximum possible sum without considering parity is M. Let the number of edges in that subset be E. \n\nIf E is even, then even_max = M, and odd_max = M - (something). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference between even_max and odd_max is the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes in the component, or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints: \n\nThe parity of the number of edges in S can be adjusted by flipping the inclusion of a single node. \n\nSuppose we have a subset S with parity p. If we flip a node v (include it if not, exclude if included), then the change in the number of edges is equal to the number of edges incident to v that are now in or out of S. \n\nWait, flipping v's inclusion affects all edges connected to v. For each edge (v, u), if u was in S before, then the edge's contribution to the count would change. \n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a way to find a node whose flipping would change the parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that for any connected component, the difference between even_max and odd_max is either 0 or the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nWait, let me think of a small example. \n\nSuppose a component is a single edge between nodes A and B. \n\nThe possible subsets:\n\n- Neither A nor B: edges in subset is 0 (even). Sum is 0. \n\n- Only A: edges 0 (even). Sum a_A. \n\n- Only B: edges 0 (even). Sum a_B. \n\n- Both A and B: edges 1 (odd). Sum a_A + a_B. \n\nSo for this component, even_max is max(0, a_A, a_B, 0 (if both are included but that gives odd parity? Wait, no. Wait when both are included, edges count is 1 (odd). So for even_max, the maximum is max between the cases where edges are even. \n\nThe even cases are when 0 edges (so subsets with 0 or 1 nodes). The maximum even_max would be max(a_A, a_B, 0). \n\nThe odd_max is the case when both are included, sum a_A + a_B. \n\nSo even_max could be a_A + a_B (if they are both not included?), no. Wait no. \n\nWait, the even_max is the maximum sum when the edges count is even. \n\nIn the case of the single edge between A and B:\n\nThe possible subsets with even edges count are:\n\n- neither: edges 0 \u2192 even. Sum 0.\n\n- only A: edges 0 \u2192 even. Sum a_A.\n\n- only B: edges 0 \u2192 even. Sum a_B.\n\n- both: edges 1 \u2192 odd. So not counted in even_max.\n\nThus even_max is max(a_A, a_B, 0). \n\nThe odd_max is the case when both are included, sum a_A + a_B. \n\nSo the difference between even_max and odd_max could be (a_A + a_B) - max(a_A, a_B, 0). \n\nHmm, but how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any connected component, the even_max and odd_max can be computed as follows:\n\nLet M be the maximum possible sum without considering parity. Let E be the number of edges in that subset. \n\nIf E is even, then even_max = M, and odd_max = M - (some minimal cost to flip the parity). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes in the component. \n\nWait, in the example above, if the maximum subset is both nodes (sum a_A + a_B, edges 1 (odd)), then to get even parity, you have to exclude one of them. The minimal cost would be the minimal of a_A or a_B. \n\nSo the even_max would be (a_A + a_B) - min(a_A, a_B) = max(a_A, a_B). \n\nWhich matches the earlier example. \n\nSo perhaps, for any component, the difference between even_max and odd_max is either 0 (if the maximum subset already has even parity) or the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nWait, but how do we know that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nSo, for a component, the even_max and odd_max can be computed as:\n\nCompute the maximum possible sum (without parity constraint) \u2192 M. \n\nCompute the parity of the edges in that subset \u2192 p. \n\nThen, even_max = M if p is even, else M - (minimal a_i in the subset). \n\nWait, but maybe the minimal a_i is not in the subset. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can be used for each component:\n\nWe can model the problem for the component as a graph and compute two values: the maximum sum when the number of edges is even (even_max) and when it's odd (odd_max). \n\nTo compute these, we can use a dynamic programming approach on the nodes of the component. \n\nBut for large components (up to 1e5 nodes?), this might not be feasible. \n\nWait, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 1e5, so per test case, n can be up to 1e5, but perhaps the connected components can be handled in linear time. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each connected component is a tree, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key insight is that the minimal adjustment needed to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes in the component. \n\nWait, let me think of another example. Suppose a component is a triangle (three nodes connected in a cycle). \n\nSuppose all a_i are 10. The maximum subset is all three nodes, which has edges count 3 (odd). To make it even, you can remove one node. The cost is 10. So even_max would be 20 (sum of two nodes), and odd_max is 30. The difference is 10, which is the minimal a_i (since all are 10). \n\nAnother example: a component with a single node (no edges). Then, including it gives 0 edges (even). So even_max is a_i, odd_max is -infinity (since you can't have an odd number of edges with zero edges). \n\nHmm, so perhaps for any component, the even_max and odd_max can be computed as follows:\n\nLet the maximum possible sum be M, and the number of edges in that subset is E. \n\nIf E is even, then even_max = M, and odd_max = M - (the minimal a_i in the subset or something else). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i in the entire component. \n\nWait, in the first example (single edge between A and B with a_A=5, a_B=3):\n\nThe maximum subset is both nodes (sum 8, edges 1 (odd)). To get even, you have to remove one. The minimal cost is 3 (removing B gives sum 5, edges 0). So even_max is 5, which is 8-3. \n\nThe minimal a_i in the component is 3. \n\nSo yes, the difference between odd_max and even_max is 3. \n\nAnother example: component with three nodes in a triangle, a_i all 10. \n\nThe maximum subset is all three (sum 30, edges 3 (odd)). To get even, remove one node (cost 10). So even_max is 20, which is 30-10. \n\nThe minimal a_i is 10. \n\nSo the difference is 10. \n\nSo this suggests that the difference between odd_max and even_max is the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nWait, but what if the maximum subset doesn't include the minimal a_i? \n\nSuppose a component has three nodes A (a=5), B (a=3), C (a=4). Suppose the edges are A-B and B-C. \n\nThe maximum subset is all three nodes. The edges count is 2 (A-B and B-C are both in the subset, so edges count is 2 (even). So even_max is 5+3+4=12, and odd_max would be the maximum when edges count is odd. \n\nTo get an odd count, perhaps exclude one node. Let's see:\n\nIf exclude A: edges between B and C (1 edge \u2192 odd). Sum is 3+4=7. \n\nIf exclude B: edges between A and C? No, since B is excluded. So edges count 0 (even). \n\nIf exclude C: edges between A and B (1 \u2192 odd). Sum 5+3=8. \n\nSo the maximum for odd is 8. \n\nThe minimal a_i in the component is 3. \n\nThe difference between even_max (12) and odd_max (8) is 4, which is not the minimal a_i (3). \n\nHmm, so this contradicts the previous idea. \n\nWait, in this case, the maximum subset (all three nodes) has even edges (2). So even_max is 12, and odd_max is the maximum when edges count is odd. \n\nThe maximum for odd is 8 (excluding C gives edges count 1 (A-B is present, B-C is not because C is excluded). So edges count is 1. \n\nThe difference between even_max and odd_max is 4. The minimal a_i is 3 (B). \n\nHmm, so the difference is not the minimal a_i. \n\nSo my previous idea is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so this approach might not work. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nPerhaps the even_max and odd_max can be computed by considering all possible subsets, but that's not feasible for large components. \n\nAlternative approach inspired by the problem's constraints: \n\nThe problem requires that the total number of cakes (edges in the subset) is even. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the total a_i minus the maximum possible sum of a_i for the subset S with even edges count. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of a_i for a subset S with even edges count. \n\nTo compute this, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\n- The maximum sum without any constraints is the sum of all a_i where we include all nodes. Let this be total. \n\n- The number of edges in this subset is m (since all edges are present). \n\n- If m is even, then this is the maximum possible, so the answer is total_a - total. \n\n- If m is odd, then we need to flip the parity. To do this, we can remove one node which is part of an odd number of edges, or something like that. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the parity can be adjusted by flipping the inclusion of a single node. \n\nSuppose the current subset has an odd number of edges. To make it even, we can flip the inclusion of a node v. \n\nThe change in the number of edges is equal to the number of edges incident to v that were previously in the subset. \n\nWait, flipping v's inclusion will change the count of edges connected to v. \n\nSuppose v was included: then all edges connected to v and other included nodes contribute to the count. Flipping v's inclusion removes all those edges. \n\nThe change in the edge count is equal to the number of edges incident to v that were in the subset. \n\nSimilarly, if v was excluded, flipping to include it adds edges to all its neighbors that are included. \n\nThis is complicated, but perhaps the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes that are part of an odd number of edges in the current subset. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal a_i among all nodes in the graph. \n\nWait, in the first example where m is odd, the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i in the entire graph. \n\nWait, let's see the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=3, m=0. \n\nWait, no, the first sample in the note says that in the first test case, all members can be invited. So m must be even. \n\nWait the second test case in the note has members 1,2,3 with a_i 4,5,3. The friend pairs are (1,2) and (2,3). \n\nWait, the second test case's note says that the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. \n\nWait, the friend pairs are (1-2) and (2-3). \n\nIf you invite 2 and 3, the edges in the subset are (2-3), so 1 cake. Which is odd. Wait, but the problem requires the number of cakes to be even. \n\nWait, the note says that in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 1 cake (odd), but the note says that the minimum is achieved by that. Wait, that contradicts the problem's requirement. \n\nWait, looking back at the note:\n\nIn the second test case's options, the possible options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 1 cake (odd). But the problem requires the number of cakes to be even. \n\nWait, the note says that the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. But that would have 1 cake, which is odd. So that can't be. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the note. Let me re-read the note:\n\nIn the second test case's options:\n\n- invite 1 and 2: 1 cake (since they are friends). So cakes eaten is 1 (odd). \n\nWait, but the problem requires the number of cakes to be even. So those options are invalid. \n\nAh, the note must have a mistake. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait the problem says that the club's oven can only cook two cakes at a time, so the total must be even. \n\nSo the valid options must have even number of cakes. \n\nLooking back at the note's second test case:\n\nThe options listed include inviting 2 and 3, which would have one cake (the pair (2-3) is a friend pair, so that's one cake. So that's odd, which is invalid. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the note might have a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2).\"\n\nWait, how can inviting 2 and 3 give 0 cakes? Because they are friends. So the pair (2-3) is a friend pair, so if both are invited, they share a cake. So the number of cakes should be 1. \n\nAh, perhaps the friend pairs are not given in the second test case. Let me recheck the note's description. \n\nThe note says:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2).\"\n\nAh, so perhaps in that test case, there are no friend pairs between them. \n\nWait the problem's input for the second test case must have m=0. \n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite nobody (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness 6).\"\n\nAh, so perhaps in the second test case, there are no friend pairs (m=0). \n\nAh, that makes sense. So the friend pairs are zero. So the number of cakes is zero (even), so all options are valid. \n\nAh, I see. So the second test case has m=0. \n\nSo the problem's note is correct. \n\nSo the key is that the number of cakes is the number of friend pairs that are both invited. \n\nNow, back to the problem. \n\nThe approach I'm trying to think of is to model the problem as a graph and compute for each connected component the even_max and odd_max. \n\nBut how to compute even_max and odd_max for a component?\n\nPerhaps the following approach can be used for each connected component:\n\nThe component can be treated as a graph. We can model the problem for the component as follows:\n\nWe can choose to include or exclude each node, and track the parity of the number of edges in the subset. \n\nThe maximum sum for even and odd parities can be computed using a dynamic programming approach on the nodes. \n\nBut for large components, this might be computationally intensive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the component can be considered as a tree, and we can use a tree DP approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment needed is the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nWait, let's think of the component as a connected graph. \n\nSuppose we first compute the maximum possible sum without considering parity. Let this be M, and the number of edges in this subset is E. \n\nIf E is even, then even_max = M, and odd_max is M minus the minimal a_i in the subset (or something else). \n\nAlternatively, if E is odd, then even_max = M - (some minimal cost), and odd_max = M. \n\nThe minimal cost to flip the parity would be the minimal a_i among all nodes in the component. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose the maximum subset has an odd number of edges. To make it even, we can exclude a node which is part of an odd number of edges in the subset. \n\nThe cost is a_i of that node. \n\nThe minimal such a_i would give the minimal cost. \n\nAlternatively, any node can be excluded, but excluding a node that is in an odd number of edges would change the parity. \n\nHmm, but how do we know such a node exists? \n\nIn a connected component, the number of edges in the subset must be even or odd. \n\nWait, the parity of the number of edges in the subset depends on the subset's structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps in any connected component, there exists at least one node whose exclusion will flip the parity. \n\nThis might be true. \n\nSuppose the current subset has an odd number of edges. \n\nIf we exclude a node v, the change in the edge count is equal to the number of edges incident to v that were in the subset. \n\nLet\u2019s denote this as delta. \n\nThe new parity is (E - delta) mod 2. \n\nWe want this to be even, so (E - delta) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 delta mod 2 = E mod 2. \n\nSince E is odd, delta must be odd. \n\nSo we need to find a node v such that the number of edges incident to v in the subset is odd. \n\nDoes such a node exist? \n\nIn any graph, the sum of degrees (counted as edges in the subset) must be even, because each edge contributes to two nodes. \n\nSo the sum of the degrees (in the subset) is even. \n\nIf the total edges E is odd, then the sum of degrees is 2E, which is even. \n\nWait, no. The sum of degrees (counted with multiplicity) is 2E. \n\nSo the sum of the degrees (each edge contributes 2 to the sum) is even. \n\nSo if the total edges E is odd, then the sum of degrees is even. \n\nThus, the number of nodes with odd degree in the subset must be even. \n\nTherefore, there must be at least two nodes with odd degrees. \n\nThus, there exists at least one node v with an odd degree in the subset. \n\nExcluding such a node v will change the edge count by an odd number (since its degree is odd), so the new edge count will be E - (odd) \u2192 even (since E is odd). \n\nThus, excluding such a node will flip the parity. \n\nThe cost is a_v. \n\nTherefore, the minimal cost to flip the parity is the minimal a_i among all nodes in the subset with odd degree. \n\nBut how do we find this minimal a_i? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal a_i in the entire component is sufficient. \n\nWait, because even if the minimal a_i is not in the subset, we can choose to exclude a node with a higher a_i but which has an odd degree. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Compute the maximum possible sum (without parity constraint) \u2192 M. \n\n- Compute the number of edges in this subset \u2192 E. \n\n- If E is even, then even_max = M, odd_max = M - (minimal a_i in the component). \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the even_max and odd_max can be computed as follows:\n\neven_max = max( M if E is even, M - (minimal a_i in the component) if E is odd )\n\nodd_max = max( M if E is odd, M - (minimal a_i in the component) if E is even )\n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the difference between even_max and odd_max is the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nWait, in the first example (single edge between A and B with a_A=5, a_B=3):\n\nThe maximum subset is both nodes (sum 8, edges 1 (odd)). \n\nTo get even parity, we need to subtract the minimal a_i (3). So even_max is 5, and odd_max is 8. \n\nThe difference is 3. \n\nIn the triangle example with all a_i=10:\n\nThe maximum subset has sum 30 (edges 3, odd). \n\nTo get even, subtract 10 \u2192 even_max 20, odd_max 30. \n\nDifference 10. \n\nIn the third example (triangle with a_A=5, a_B=3, a_C=4 and edges A-B and B-C):\n\nThe maximum subset is all three nodes (sum 12, edges 2 (even)). \n\nThus even_max is 12, odd_max is 12 - minimal a_i (3) \u2192 9? \n\nBut earlier calculation showed that the odd_max could be 8. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the approach is not correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal a_i in the component is the key. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal a_i in the entire graph is the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nThus, the overall approach could be:\n\nCompute the maximum possible sum without considering parity. \n\nIf the number of edges in this subset is even \u2192 that's the answer. \n\nElse, subtract the minimal a_i in the entire graph. \n\nBut this might not work in all cases. \n\nWait, let's see the third example where the maximum subset has even edges. \n\nThen, the answer is the maximum sum. \n\nIf the maximum subset has odd edges, then subtract the minimal a_i. \n\nBut in the case where the minimal a_i is not part of the subset, then excluding it would not affect the edges count. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to model each connected component as follows:\n\nFor each connected component, compute the maximum possible sum for even and odd parities. \n\nThe way to compute this is to realize that the difference between even_max and odd_max is the minimal a_i in the component. \n\nThus, for each component:\n\neven_max = max_sum \n\nodd_max = max_sum - min_a \n\nOR \n\neven_max = max_sum - min_a \n\nodd_max = max_sum \n\nDepending on the parity of the max subset. \n\nWait, let me think:\n\nSuppose the maximum subset has even edges \u2192 even_max is max_sum, and odd_max is max_sum - min_a. \n\nIf the maximum subset has odd edges \u2192 even_max is max_sum - min_a, and odd_max is max_sum. \n\nThus, for each component, the even_max and odd_max can be computed as:\n\nmax_sum = sum of a_i for all nodes in the component (since including all gives maximum possible sum). \n\nWait no, the maximum subset may not include all nodes. \n\nWait, the maximum subset is the one that includes all nodes unless excluding some gives a higher sum. \n\nWait, the a_i are the unhappiness if not invited. So to maximize the sum of invited a_i, we should include all nodes unless excluding a node gives a higher sum. \n\nWait, no. The a_i is the unhappiness added if the member is not invited. So to minimize the total unhappiness, we want to include as many as possible. \n\nWait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize it, we want to include as many as possible (since including a member reduces the unhappiness by a_i). \n\nThus, the maximum subset is the one that includes all members, unless excluding some members gives a higher total. \n\nWait, no. The maximum subset sum is the sum of a_i for all invited members. To maximize this, you include all members (since a_i can be zero or positive). \n\nWait, the a_i can be zero. So the maximum subset is indeed all members. \n\nWait, the problem states that a_i can be zero. So the maximum subset is always including all members. \n\nWait, but the edges count is the number of friend pairs among all members. \n\nAh, so the maximum subset is always including all members. \n\nThus, the maximum possible sum is the sum of all a_i. \n\nThe number of edges in this subset is m (since all friend pairs are included). \n\nThus, the problem reduces to:\n\nIf m is even \u2192 the answer is the sum of all a_i (since including everyone gives even edges). \n\nElse \u2192 we need to exclude some nodes to make the number of edges even. \n\nThe minimal cost is the minimal a_i (since excluding a node with a_i will reduce the sum by a_i, and we need to choose the minimal such a_i to minimize the loss). \n\nWait, but excluding a node can change the number of edges by the number of edges incident to that node. \n\nSo to flip the parity of the edges count (from odd to even), we need to exclude a node whose degree (in the entire graph) is odd. \n\nBecause the number of edges in the subset after excluding the node will be m - degree(node). \n\nThe change in parity is (m - degree(node)) mod 2. \n\nWe want this to be even. \n\nOriginal parity is m mod 2 (which is 1, since m is odd). \n\nSo (m - degree(node)) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 (1 - degree(node) mod 2) mod 2 =0 \u2192 degree(node) mod 2 =1. \n\nThus, the node must have an odd degree. \n\nTherefore, to flip the parity, we must exclude a node with odd degree. \n\nThe minimal cost is the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. \n\nIf there are no such nodes, then it's impossible? But in a graph, the sum of degrees is 2m, which is even. So the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. \n\nThus, there must be at least two nodes with odd degrees. \n\nThus, the minimal a_i among those nodes is the minimal cost. \n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nCompute the total sum of all a_i. \n\nIf the number of edges m is even \u2192 output total. \n\nElse \u2192 find the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. Subtract this from the total. \n\nWait, this seems promising. \n\nLet me test this with the examples. \n\nFirst example (from note):\n\nTest case 1: all members invited. \n\nSuppose m is even \u2192 output total. \n\nSecond test case: m=0 (no edges). \n\nm is even \u2192 output total. But in the note's second test case, the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, but since m=0, the edges count is 0 (even). So including all gives total a_i sum of 4+5+3=12. But the note says the minimal unhappiness is 2 (which is 6 (sum of a_i not invited) \u2192 the invited are 2 and 3, so not invited is 1 \u2192 a_1=4. So total unhappiness is 4. Wait, the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's unhappiness calculation. \n\nWait the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for members not invited. \n\nIn the second test case, the note says inviting 2 and 3 gives unhappiness 2 (a_3 is not invited? No, they are invited. Wait, the members not invited are 1. So a_1 is 4. So the unhappiness should be 4. But the note says 2. \n\nAh, perhaps the a array in the second test case is different. \n\nThe note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3 with unhappiness 2. So the a array must be such that the unhappiness for not inviting 1 is 2. \n\nAh, perhaps the a array is [4,5,3]. So if you invite 2 and 3, the not invited is 1, so a_1=4 \u2192 unhappiness 4. But the note says 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the a_i and the unhappiness. \n\nWait the problem says: if member i is not invited, the party gains an unhappiness of a_i. \n\nSo the total is sum of a_i for all not invited. \n\nThus, to minimize this, we want to invite as many as possible. \n\nThe maximum subset sum is the sum of a_i for invited members. \n\nThe total unhappiness is total_a - sum_invited. \n\nThus, to minimize the unhappiness, we need to maximize sum_invited. \n\nThus, the problem is to maximize sum_invited with the number of edges even. \n\nThus, the approach I outlined earlier is correct. \n\nSo the solution is:\n\nCompute the maximum possible sum_invited, which is the sum of all a_i if m is even. \n\nIf m is odd, then we need to exclude a node with odd degree, so the maximum sum_invited is total_a - (minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree). \n\nThus, the minimal unhappiness is total_a - (sum_invited). \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the maximum sum_invited is total_a minus the minimal a_i (since excluding that node reduces the sum by a_i). \n\nThus, the unhappiness is total_a - sum_invited = total_a - (total_a - a_i) = a_i. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the maximum sum_invited when m is odd is (total_a - a_min_odd_degree). \n\nThus, the unhappiness is total_a - (total_a - a_min_odd_degree) = a_min_odd_degree. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for not invited. \n\nIf we exclude a node with a_i, then the unhappiness increases by a_i. \n\nThus, the unhappiness is (total_a - sum_invited) = (total_a) - (sum_invited). \n\nTo maximize sum_invited, we want to exclude as few as possible. \n\nThus, when m is odd, we must exclude one node (with odd degree) to flip the parity. \n\nThe best choice is to exclude the node with the smallest a_i among those with odd degree. \n\nThus, the maximum sum_invited is total_a - a_min. \n\nThus, the unhappiness is total_a - (total_a - a_min) = a_min. \n\nWait, but what if excluding that node changes the number of edges by an odd number? \n\nYes, because the node has odd degree. \n\nThus, the number of edges after exclusion is m - degree(node). \n\nSince degree(node) is odd, m (odd) minus odd is even. \n\nThus, the parity is even. \n\nThus, this is valid. \n\nThus, the solution is:\n\nCompute the total of all a_i. \n\nIf m is even \u2192 the answer is total_a - total_a (no, wait, the unhappiness is total_a - sum_invited. \n\nWait, the maximum sum_invited is total_a (if m is even). \n\nThus, the unhappiness is total_a - total_a = 0. \n\nWhich matches the first test case's note. \n\nIf m is odd \u2192 the maximum sum_invited is total_a - a_min (where a_min is the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree). \n\nThus, the unhappiness is total_a - (total_a - a_min) = a_min. \n\nWait, but in the second test case, m is 0 (even), so the answer is 0. \n\nThe note's second test case's minimal unhappiness is 2. \n\nWait, the note says the second test case's minimal is 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the second test case has m=0 (so even), so the maximum sum_invited is total_a. \n\nThe unhappiness is total_a - total_a =0. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis suggests a contradiction. \n\nAh, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's input. \n\nLooking back at the note's second test case description:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2).\"\n\nThe unhappiness is 2, which is the sum of a_i for not invited members. \n\nIf the members not invited are 1, then a_1 must be 2. \n\nAh, perhaps the a array is [4,5,3] for the second test case. \n\nWait, if the members invited are 2 and 3, then the not invited is 1. \n\nThe unhappiness is a_1 =4. But the note says 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the a array is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second test case has a different setup. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the number of cakes must be even, but the minimal unhappiness is achieved by a subset with even cakes. \n\nIn the second test case, since m=0, any subset has 0 cakes (even). \n\nThus, the minimal unhappiness is the minimal possible, which is achieved by inviting as many as possible. \n\nThe maximum sum_invited is the sum of a_i for all invited. To minimize the unhappiness, we want to maximize this. \n\nThe maximum is achieved by inviting everyone, which gives unhappiness 0. \n\nBut the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the second test case has a different setup. \n\nAh, perhaps the second test case has m=1. \n\nWait, let me re-read the note's second test case description:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2).\"\n\nIf the pair (2,3) is a friend pair, then inviting them would give 1 cake (odd), which is invalid. \n\nThus, the friend pair must not exist. \n\nThus, m=0. \n\nThus, the unhappiness when inviting 2 and 3 is a_1 =4. \n\nBut the note says it's 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the a array is [4,5,3], and the minimal is achieved by inviting only 3. \n\nThen the unhappiness is a_1 + a_2 =4+5=9. \n\nNo, the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nPerhaps the note's second test case has a different a array. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the number of cakes must be even, but the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for not invited. \n\nThus, the minimal unhappiness is the minimal possible over all valid subsets (even cakes). \n\nIn the second test case with m=0 (no edges), any subset is valid (since cakes count is 0). \n\nThus, the minimal unhappiness is the minimal possible, which is achieved by inviting all members except those with highest a_i. \n\nWait, no. To minimize the unhappiness, we want to invite as many as possible. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is achieved by inviting everyone, which gives 0. \n\nBut the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the second test case has m=1. \n\nSuppose there is one friend pair between 1 and 2. \n\nThen, if you invite both 1 and 2, the cakes count is 1 (odd), which is invalid. \n\nThus, the valid options must have even cakes. \n\nThe best option is to invite neither 1 nor 2, so the unhappiness is a_1 + a_2 + a_3. \n\nAlternatively, invite one of them. \n\nWait, this is getting too time-consuming. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the solution I have. \n\nThe solution is:\n\n- Compute the total of all a_i. \n\n- If m is even \u2192 the answer is total_a - total_a (unhappiness is 0). \n\n- Else \u2192 find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. Subtract that from the total_a to get the maximum sum_invited. The unhappiness is total_a - (total_a - a_min) = a_min. \n\nThus, the code should:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Compute the total of a_i. \n\n2. Compute the degree of each node (number of friends). \n\n3. If m is even \u2192 output 0 (unhappiness is total_a - total_a =0). \n\n4. Else \u2192 find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. The answer is that minimal a_i. \n\nWait, but the unhappiness is total_a - sum_invited. \n\nSum_invited is total_a - a_min. \n\nThus, the unhappiness is a_min. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the code needs to:\n\n- For each test case:\n\n   a. Read n, m. \n\n   b. Read a array. \n\n   c. Read m edges, and compute the degree of each node. \n\n   d. If m is even \u2192 output 0. \n\n   e. Else \u2192 find the minimal a_i where degree[i] is odd. \n\n   f. Output that minimal a_i. \n\nWait, but what if there are no nodes with odd degree? \n\nBut in a graph with m edges, the sum of degrees is 2m, which is even. Thus, the number of nodes with odd degree must be even. So there must be at least two. \n\nThus, the code can proceed. \n\nNow, looking back at the provided code:\n\nThe existing code has some variables like mass, which is probably the degree array. \n\nIn the code:\n\nfor each friend pair (x,y), they do:\n\nvecc[i] = vec[x-1] + vec[y-1]; \n\nmass[x-1] +=1, mass[y-1] +=1; \n\nWait, mass is the degree array. \n\nThen, in the case when m is even, the code prints 0. \n\nBut in the first test case, that's correct. \n\nBut in the second test case (m=0), it would print 0, which matches the note's first case. \n\nBut in the second test case's note, the minimal is 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the note's second test case has m=1. \n\nWait, let's think of the second test case in the note:\n\nThe minimal unhappiness is 2. \n\nSuppose the a array is [4,5,3], and m=1 (friend pair between 1 and 2). \n\nThen, m is odd (1). \n\nThe degrees are:\n\nnode 1: 1 \n\nnode 2:1 \n\nnode3:0 \n\nThus, nodes 1 and 2 have odd degrees. \n\nThe minimal a_i among them is 4 (node1) and 5 (node2). The minimal is 4. \n\nThus the answer would be 4. But the note says 2. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the a array is [4,5,3], and the minimal is achieved by not inviting 3. \n\nWait, but then the unhappiness would be a_3=3. \n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the code. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nif (m%2 ==0) \u2192 print 0. \n\nElse, loop over all nodes with mass[i]%2 ==1 (odd degree), and do something. \n\nThe code then loops through all m edges and finds the minimal vecc[i], which is the sum of a_i and a_j for each edge. \n\nWait, the current code's approach is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nThus, the code should:\n\nIn the else block (m is odd):\n\nInitialize the minimal value to a very large number. \n\nLoop over all nodes: \n\n   if mass[i] is odd \u2192 check if a[i] is smaller than current minimal. \n\nThen, output that minimal. \n\nThus, the missing code in the for loop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif (mass[i]%2 ==1) \u2192 \n\n   st = min(st, a[i]); \n\nWait, but the code currently has variables like st initialized to 99999999999 (probably a big number). \n\nIn the code's current structure:\n\nAfter reading the edges, the code has:\n\nif (m%2 ==0) \u2192 print 0. \n\nElse:\n\n   for (i=0 to n-1) {\n\n      if mass[i]%2 ==1 \u2192 \n\n         /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   }\n\n   for (i=0 to m-1) {\n\n      st = min(st, vecc[i]);\n\n   }\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", st);\n\nWait, the current code's approach is to find the minimal vecc[i], which is the sum of a_x and a_y for each edge. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nThus, the missing code should be:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThus, in the for loop over the nodes with mass[i]%2 ==1, we need to track the minimal a_i. \n\nThe code currently has st initialized to a large number. \n\nThus, the code should be modified as follows:\n\nIn the else block (m is odd):\n\n   st = a very large number (like 1e18). \n\n   for (i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n      if (mass[i]%2 ==1) {\n\n          if (vec[i] < st) {\n\n              st = vec[i]; \n\n          }\n\n      }\n\n   }\n\n   printf(\"%d\\n\", st); \n\nThus, the missing code in the for loop over the nodes is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nBut in the current code, the 'st' is initialized to 99999999999 (which is 1e10?), but in C++, that might be an integer overflow. \n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nst = 99999999999; \n\nBut 99999999999 is larger than 2^31, so in a 32-bit int, this would overflow. \n\nThus, the code should use a larger type, like long long. \n\nBut the problem's output requires to print an integer, which can be up to 1e4 * 1e5 = 1e9, so 32-bit is sufficient. \n\nBut 99999999999 is 1e11, which is larger than 2^31 (2e9). \n\nThus, the initial value of st should be set to a large enough value, like 1e18, but stored as a long long. \n\nBut in the current code, the variables are declared as int. \n\nThus, the code has several errors. \n\nThe correct code should:\n\n- For each test case:\n\n   compute the degrees (mass array). \n\n   if m is even \u2192 output 0. \n\n   else \u2192 find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nThus, the missing code in the for loop over the nodes is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]); \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nIn the for loop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\nif (mass[i]%2 ==1) {\n\n    if (vec[i] < st) st = vec[i]; \n\n}\n\nThen, after processing all nodes, output st. \n\nThe current code's else block has a loop over the edges (vecc[i]), which is incorrect. \n\nThus, the code's current structure is wrong. \n\nThe code's current else block does:\n\nfor (i=0 to n-1) { ... }\n\nthen loops over m edges to find the minimal vecc[i], which is wrong. \n\nThus, the correct code should replace the second loop with the minimal a_i. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nIn the for loop over the nodes (i from 0 to n-1):\n\nif (mass[i]%2 ==1) {\n\n    st = min(st, vec[i]);\n\n}\n\nThen, after the for loop, output st. \n\nThus, the code's current else block should be:\n\nelse {\n\n    st = some large value; \n\n    for (i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n        if (mass[i]%2 ==1) {\n\n            st = min(st, vec[i]); \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    printf(\"%d\\n\", st); \n\n}\n\nThus, the missing code in the TODO section is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThus, the code should have:\n\nIn the for loop over the nodes:\n\nif (mass[i]%2 ==1) {\n\n    st = min(st, vec[i]);\n\n}\n\nThe current code's 'st' is initialized to 99999999999, which is a problem because it's larger than 2^31. \n\nThus, the code should initialize st to a large enough value, like 1e18, but stored as a long long. \n\nBut in the current code, 'st' is declared as an int. \n\nThus, the code has several errors. \n\nBut the problem requires to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is in the for loop over the nodes (i from 0 to n-1) where mass[i]%2 is 1. \n\nThe code should set st to the minimum between st and vec[i]. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThus, the code inside the if block (mass[i]%2 ==1) should be:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThus, the answer is to fill in that line. \n\nThe current code's else block has a loop over the edges (vecc[i]), which is incorrect. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe TODO is inside the for loop over the nodes (i from 0 to n-1) where mass[i]%2 is 1. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO is:\n\nst = min(st, vec[i]);\n\nSo the code should replace the TODO with that line. \n\nThe rest of the code has errors, but the user only asks for the missing code. \n\nThus, the answer is to output that line."
