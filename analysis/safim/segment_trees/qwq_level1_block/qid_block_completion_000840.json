Wait, but in this case, the current position is the bottom row, so last-1 is 2 (same as current row). Hmm, maybe the code should first check if the current cell is a star and can be moved down. Alternatively, perhaps the code should first move the stone to last-1, then set last to last-1. Wait, in the example above, after moving the stone, last becomes 2. Then, moving up to i=1 (row1):\n\ncell is '.', so nothing. i=0 (row0) is 'o', so set last =0. So after processing this row, last is 0. Now, when we process the stone at row0? No, the stone was at row2. Hmm, perhaps this approach works. Another example: \n\nColumn:\n\nRow3: *\n\nRow2: *\n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: *\n\nn=4 rows. Processing this column:\n\nlast starts at 4. \n\ni=3 (bottom row):\n\ncell is *, so:\n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[3][j] (last-1 is 3) to '*' \u2192 no change.

Then last becomes 0. So the final column would have:\n\nRow3: . Row2: . Row1: o \n\nRow0: * Wait, but the stone at row0 can't fall below the obstacle at row1. So it should be placed at row0, which is correct. The stones at rows 3 and 2 are moved down, but since the obstacle is at row1, they can't go below that. Wait, the first stone (originally at row3) would be placed at last-1 when processed. Wait, let's walk through the steps again for this example. Processing the column:\n\nInitially last =4. \n\ni=3 (row3):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1][j] (3) to '*' \u2192 so no change. Then last becomes 3. \n\ni=2 (row2):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[2][j] (last-1 is 2) \u2192 no change. last becomes 2. \n\ni=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to 1. \n\ni=0 (row0):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1][j] (0) to '*' \u2192 so the stone is placed at row0. last becomes 0.

Wait, but the stones at rows 3 and 2 should fall down until they hit the obstacle at row1. So the stones at row3 and 2 should fall to row1-1 = row0 and row1? Wait, the obstacle is at row1.

Then, iterate again from bottom to top, and place the stones in the available positions. Wait, perhaps the following steps:\n\n- For each column j:\n\n   - Create a list to hold the stones and obstacles. - Iterate from bottom to top (i from n-1 downto 0):\n\n      - if cell is 'o', add to the list. - if cell is '*', add to the list. \n\n      - else (.), ignore. - Now, the list contains the obstacles and stones in reverse order (from bottom up). - Then, we can process the list to determine where the stones should be placed. - The stones should be placed starting from the bottom, but above any obstacles. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, here's the correct approach for the code's current structure. The code's current structure is processing each column, and for each row from bottom to top. The 'last' variable is the first row (from the bottom) where an obstacle is found.

Wait, no. The obstacle is at row1. So rows0 and1 are above the obstacle? Wait, rows are numbered from 0 (top) to n-1 (bottom). Or is it the other way around? Wait, the problem says the grid has n rows and m columns. The input is given as n lines, each line is a row. Assuming that the first line of input is the top row, and the last line is the bottom row. Wait, the code reads the input as: \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n   String x = s.next();\n\n   for (j=0..m-1) arr[i][j] = x.charAt(j);\n\n}\n\nSo row 0 is the first row (top), and row n-1 is the bottom row. Ah! This is crucial. In the previous examples, I assumed that row0 is the bottom, but in reality, row n-1 is the bottom. So in the example where the column has rows 0 to3 (n=4), row3 is the bottom. So the first example I considered:\n\nColumn:\n\nRow3 (bottom): *\n\nRow2: . Row1: o \n\nRow0 (top): *\n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at4 (n=4). Processing i from 3 downto0:\n\ni=3 (bottom row):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1 (3)] to '*' \u2192 no change. last becomes3. i=2 (row2):\n\ncell is '.' \u2192 nothing. i=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to1. i=0 (row0) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1 (0)] to '*' \u2192 so the stone is placed at row0. \n\nlast becomes0. The final column has:\n\nRow3: . \n\nRow2: . Row1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nWhich is correct. The stone at row3 (bottom) is moved to row3 (no change). Wait, but the obstacle is at row1. The stone at row3 is below the obstacle (row1 is above row3?), no. Wait, row3 is the bottom row. The obstacle is at row1, which is above it. So the stone at row3 can fall down to the bottom (row3), which is correct. The stone at row0 (top) is moved to row0. The obstacle is at row1. The stone at row0 can fall down to row0 (since it's above the obstacle).",

The stones can fall down to the bottom (rows3,2,1). Which is correct. Thus, the code's approach seems to work. So the missing code in the else if block is:\n\narr[i][j] = '.'; // remove the stone from current position \n\narr[last-1][j] = '*'; \n\nlast--; Wait, but in the code's current structure, the 'last' is being tracked. Wait, the code's current code for the else if block (when cell is '*'):\n\nelse if(arr[i][j] == '*' && last-1 >=0) {\n\n    // move the stone to last-1 \n\n    arr[i][j] = '.'; \n\n    arr[last-1][j] = '*'; last--; \n\n}\n\nThis should be the code. But wait, in the code's current setup, the 'last' is initially n. When we process a stone at i, we set the current cell to '.' and place the stone at last-1. Then decrement last. This way, the next stone will be placed one row above. Yes, this should work. So the missing code is:\n\narr[i][j] = '.'; \n\narr[last-1][j] = '*'; last--; \n\nThus, the code should be filled with those three lines in the else if block. Wait, but what about the condition 'last-1 >=0'? The code has '&& last-1 >=0' in the else if condition. So the code is:\n\nelse if (arr[i][j] == '*' && last-1 >=0) {\n\n    // code here \n\n} Thus, the code inside the else if block should be those three lines. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\narr[i][j] = '.'; \n\narr[last-1][j] = '*'; last--; \n\nSo that's the code to fill in the TODO section. Testing this with the first example where the stone is at row3 (bottom):\n\nThe code would set arr[3][j] to '.' and then set arr[3][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. But that's okay because it's already in the correct position. Wait, but the stone is already at the bottom, so it doesn't need to move. The code would set it to '.' and then set it back to '*' \u2192 no change. But the last is decremented to 3. This is okay. Another example where a stone is above an obstacle:\n\nColumn:\n\nRow3 (bottom): . Row2: * \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nProcessing row2 (i=2):\n\nlast is initially4. So last-1 is3. The stone is moved to row3 (bottom). Then last becomes3.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem where stones fall until they hit an obstacle or another stone. Let's see the problem again. The grid has stones ('*'), empty ('.'), and obstacles ('o'). The stones fall down as far as possible until they can't move anymore. So the task is to simulate this process and output the resulting grid.\n\nLooking at the code provided, the main structure is there. The input is read correctly into a 2D array. The part that's missing is inside the else if block where arr[i][j] is a star. The current code has a loop that goes through each column (j) and for each column, it processes the rows from bottom to top. The variable 'last' is initialized to n, which is probably the row below the grid. \n\nHmm, the idea here is probably to track the next possible position where a stone can fall. Let me think. For each column, we process from the bottom up. The 'last' variable might represent the next available spot where a stone can be placed. \n\nSo when we encounter an obstacle ('o'), that blocks the stones below it. So whenever we hit an 'o', we set last to the current row, meaning the next stones can't go below this. \n\nNow, when we find a stone ('*'), we need to move it to the position just above the last possible spot. The 'last' variable is being tracked here. So maybe for each star, we can swap it with the position at last-1, and then decrement last? Wait, but how do we handle multiple stones in the same column?\n\nAlternatively, for each column, we can process each cell from the bottom up. Let me think of the algorithm again. For each column j:\n\n- Start from the bottom row (i = n-1 down to 0)\n- Keep track of the next possible position where a stone can fall. Initially, this is the bottom row (n), but since rows are 0-based, maybe last starts at n, so last-1 is the bottom row.\n\nWait, the code initializes last as n. So when we check if arr[i][j] is 'o', then set last = i. So that means any stones above this 'o' can't fall below this row. \n\nFor a stone at position i, j, if the current last is greater than i, then the stone can fall to last-1. But how do we handle moving it?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to collect all the stones in the column and then place them just above the obstacles or the bottom. Let me think of the steps:\n\nFor each column j:\n\n- We process from the bottom up. The 'last' variable represents the first position (from below) where a stone can be placed. Initially, last is n (so the bottom row is n-1, so last-1 is n-1). \n\n- When we hit an obstacle (o), the stones above it can't fall below this, so the next possible position is now i (the row of the obstacle). So last is set to i. \n\n- When we hit a stone (*), we need to move it to the last possible position (last-1), then decrement last by 1 so that the next stone can take the next position above. \n\nBut how do we do this without overwriting? Because the array is being modified as we go. Wait, maybe we can't do it in-place. Hmm, perhaps the current approach is to track where each stone should go. \n\nAlternatively, for each column, we can collect all the stones and obstacles, then rebuild the column from the bottom up. Let me think of that approach. \n\nAnother idea: For each column, process each cell from bottom to top. We can track the current position where the next stone can be placed. \n\nLet me think of the algorithm again. Let's take a column. We start from the bottom. \n\nInitialize the 'current' position as the bottom row. \n\nWe go up each row:\n\n- If the current cell is an obstacle (o), then any stones above can't fall below this. So the next stones can only fall up to this row -1. So we set current to this row's position. \n\n- If the cell is a stone (*), then we need to place it at the current position (current), then move current up by one. \n\nWait, maybe the approach is to, for each column, collect all the stones and then place them starting from the bottom, above any obstacles. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach for each column:\n\n1. For column j, iterate from the bottom (i = n-1 down to 0).\n\n2. Keep track of the next available position where a stone can be placed. Let's call this 'next_pos'. Initially, next_pos is the bottom row (n-1). \n\n3. For each cell in the column from bottom to top:\n\n   a. If the cell is an obstacle (o), then the next available position is now set to the row above the obstacle (i-1). Because stones can't pass through the obstacle. Wait, no. The obstacle itself blocks the stones. So any stones above the obstacle can fall down to the position just above the obstacle. \n\n   So when we hit an obstacle at row i, the next possible position for stones is i+1? Or maybe the next available position is now i, so stones can't go below that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'next_pos' starts at the bottom. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose the column is:\n\nRow 4: *\nRow 3: .\nRow 2: o\nRow 1: *\nRow 0: .\n\nThe column has rows 0 to 4 (assuming n=5). \n\nProcessing from bottom (row4) up:\n\nInitially next_pos is 4 (the bottom row). \n\nRow4 is *, so we place it at next_pos (4). Then next_pos becomes 3. \n\nRow3 is ., so nothing. \n\nRow2 is o. So the obstacle is here. So stones can't fall below row2. So the next available position is now row2-1? Or row2 is the obstacle, so the next stones can only go up to row1. \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row2. So any stones above it (rows 3 and 4) can fall down until they hit the obstacle. \n\nWait in the example, the stone at row4 is already at the bottom, so it stays. The stone at row1 can fall down. \n\nWait the stone at row1 would fall down until it hits the obstacle at row2. So it would stop at row1 (since row2 is obstacle). \n\nHmm, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nFor each column:\n\n- Start from the bottom. \n\n- The available positions for stones are the cells from the bottom up until an obstacle is found. \n\n- So, for each column, we can track the positions where stones can be placed. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach for each column:\n\n- We can collect all the stones in the column, then place them starting from the bottom, but above any obstacles. \n\nSo for each column j:\n\n- Let's first find all the obstacles in the column. The stones can't go below any obstacle. \n\n- The stones will fall to the lowest possible positions, which are the cells between the bottom and the first obstacle above them. \n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each column j:\n\n   a. Find all the obstacles in the column. The obstacles divide the column into regions. Stones above an obstacle can fall down to the region above that obstacle. \n\n   b. Also, the bottom of the grid is a \"floor\" which is an implicit obstacle. \n\n   c. So, for each column, we can process from the bottom up, keeping track of the next possible position where a stone can be placed. \n\nLet me think of the code structure. The existing code has loops for each column j, then for each row i from n-1 down to 0. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nfor each column j:\n\n    last = n; \n\n    for i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n        if cell is 'o', then set last = i. \n\n        else if cell is '*', then ... \n\nThe idea here is that 'last' is the first row (from below) that is an obstacle or the bottom. So the stones can fall to positions between i and last-1. \n\nWait, perhaps 'last' is the first row (from the bottom) where an obstacle is found. So the available positions for stones are from last to the current row? \n\nAlternatively, the 'last' variable is tracking the next possible position where a stone can be placed. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's current setup. \n\nInitially, last is set to n (which is beyond the grid). \n\nThen, for each row i from bottom to top:\n\n- if the current cell is 'o', then the stones above can't fall below this row. So the next possible position for stones is now i (the row of the obstacle). So we set last = i. \n\n- else if the current cell is '*', then we need to move this stone to the last-1 position. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should do something like:\n\nWhen we find a stone at i, j, we can swap it with the position at last-1, then decrement last by 1. \n\nBut how to do this without overwriting? Because if we process from the bottom up, maybe we can track where the stone should go. \n\nAlternatively, here's the idea: \n\nFor each column j:\n\n- We process each row from the bottom up. \n\n- The 'last' variable represents the first row (from the bottom) where a stone can be placed. \n\nWait, perhaps 'last' is the next available position. \n\nWait, let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the column is:\n\nRow 3: *\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: o\n\nRow 0: *\n\nInitially, last is 4 (n=4 rows, so rows 0-3, n=4). \n\nProcessing i=3 (bottom row):\n\nCell is *, so we need to place it at last-1 (3). So we can set arr[i][j] to '.' (since we are moving it), and set arr[last-1][j] to '*'? But since we are processing from bottom up, maybe we can just track where the stone should go. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to, for each column, collect all the stones and then place them in the available spots. \n\nLet me think of the steps again. \n\nThe code's current approach for each column j:\n\nInitialize last = n (so last-1 is n-1, the bottom row). \n\nThen, for each row i from bottom (n-1) up to 0:\n\nIf the current cell is 'o', then set last = i. \n\nSo, for example, if there's an obstacle at row i, then the next possible position for stones is now i. \n\nWait, but the obstacle is at row i, so stones can't go below that. So the next available position for stones is i-1? \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'last' variable is the first row (from the bottom) that is an obstacle or the bottom. \n\nWait, maybe the 'last' variable is the next position where a stone can be placed. \n\nWait, let's think of the code's current structure. \n\nSuppose in the loop for a column j:\n\nWe have last = n (so last-1 is n-1, the bottom row). \n\nThen, for each row i from n-1 down to 0:\n\nCase 1: cell is 'o' \u2192 set last = i. \n\nSo, for example, if the current cell is an obstacle at row i, then the next possible position for stones is now i. \n\nWait, but the obstacle is at row i, so stones can't go below that. So the next available position for stones is i-1. \n\nHmm, maybe the code's logic is that 'last' is the first row (from the bottom) that is an obstacle. So the stones can fall down to the row below that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 'last' variable is the next available row where a stone can be placed. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. \n\nSuppose the column is:\n\nRow 2: *\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 0: o \n\nn is 3 rows (0-based). \n\nInitially, last = 3 (since n=3). \n\nProcessing i=2 (bottom row):\n\nCell is *, so we need to move it. \n\nThe current last is 3, so last-1 is 2. So the stone is already at the bottom. So we can set arr[i][j] to '.' and place it at last-1 (2). But since it's already there, maybe we do nothing. \n\nWait, but in this case, the stone is already at the bottom. \n\nThen, moving up to i=1 (row 1):\n\nCell is '.', so nothing. \n\nThen i=0 (row 0):\n\nCell is 'o', so set last = 0. \n\nSo after processing this row, last is 0. \n\nNow, the stone at row 2 is already in place. \n\nAnother example: \n\nColumn has:\n\nRow 3: *\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: o \n\nRow 0: *\n\nn=4 rows. \n\nProcessing from bottom (i=3):\n\nCell is *, so we need to move it. \n\nlast is initially 4 \u2192 last-1 is 3. So the stone is already there. So we can set arr[i][j] to '.' and place it at 3. \n\nWait, but that's the same position. \n\nThen, moving up to i=2 (row 2):\n\nCell is '.', so nothing. \n\ni=1 (row 1) is 'o', so set last =1. \n\ni=0 (row 0) is * \u2192 now, since last is 1, the stone can be placed at last-1 =0? Wait, no. \n\nWait, if last is 1, then last-1 is 0. \n\nSo the stone at row 0 can be placed at 0? \n\nWait, but the obstacle is at row1. So the stone at row0 can fall down to row0 (since it's above the obstacle). \n\nWait, the stone at row0 can fall down until it hits the obstacle at row1. So it can fall to row0 (since row1 is obstacle). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is that when a stone is found at i, it can be placed at last-1, and then last is decremented by 1. \n\nWait, maybe the code should do something like this: \n\nWhen we find a stone at i, j:\n\n- We can move it to the position last-1. \n\n- Then, we set arr[i][j] to '.' (since the stone is now moved down). \n\n- Then, we set last to last-1, so the next stone can be placed one row above. \n\nWait, but how do we do this without overwriting? Because the stone is moving to last-1, which might be a position that hasn't been processed yet. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should track the positions where the stones should be placed. \n\nWait, here's the idea: \n\nFor each column j:\n\n- We process each row from the bottom up. \n\n- We track the next available position (last) where a stone can be placed. \n\n- Whenever we encounter a stone, we move it to the current 'last' position (last-1?), then decrement last. \n\nWait, let me think of the variables again. \n\nInitially, last is set to n (so last-1 is n-1, the bottom row). \n\nWhen we process a row i:\n\nIf the cell is 'o', then the next available position is now i. So set last = i. \n\nIf the cell is '*', then we can place this stone at last-1. \n\nWait, but how do we do that? \n\nMaybe the steps are:\n\nWhen we find a stone at i, j:\n\n- We set arr[i][j] to '.' (since it's moving down). \n\n- Then, we set arr[last-1][j] to '*' (placing it there). \n\n- Then, we decrement last by 1, so the next stone can be placed one row above. \n\nBut this might not work because when processing from the bottom up, the stone is being moved to a lower row (which is already processed). \n\nWait, but since we are processing from the bottom up, the lower rows have already been processed. So when we move the stone to last-1, which is a lower row, that position has already been considered. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach would work. \n\nLet me try with the first example where the column is:\n\nRow 3: *\n\nRow 2: .\n\nRow 1: o \n\nRow 0: *\n\nProcessing column j:\n\nInitialize last =4 (n=4 rows). \n\nStart with i=3 (bottom row):\n\nCell is *, so:\n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1][j] (which is 3) to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nThen last becomes 3. \n\nWait, but that's the same position. \n\nHmm, maybe the code should first check if the current position is above the last. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should track the stones and then place them in the available spots. \n\nAlternatively, here's another approach: \n\nFor each column j:\n\n- Create a list to hold the stones and obstacles. \n\n- Iterate from bottom to top. \n\n- Whenever we hit an obstacle, we can add it to the list, and then any stones above can be placed below it. \n\n- The stones are collected and placed in the available spots. \n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nFor each column j:\n\n- Start from the bottom. \n\n- The current position is the bottom row. \n\n- We collect all the stones in this column. \n\n- Then, we go from the bottom up, and whenever we hit an obstacle, we place the stones collected so far above it. \n\n- The remaining stones are placed at the bottom. \n\nHmm, maybe this is better. \n\nLet me think of the steps again. \n\nFor each column j:\n\n- We can collect all the stones in the column. \n\n- Then, we process the column from the bottom up, and whenever we hit an obstacle, we place the stones collected so far in the cells between the obstacle and the previous position. \n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize a list to hold the stones in the column. \n\nThen, for each row from bottom to top:\n\n- If the cell is a stone, add to the list. \n\n- If it's an obstacle, then we need to place the collected stones in the cells between the current row +1 and the previous position. \n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, here's the code's current structure. The code has a loop for each column j, and for each row i from bottom to top. \n\nThe 'last' variable is tracking the next possible position where a stone can be placed. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor(int j=0;j<m;j++) {\n\n    int last = n; \n\n    for(int i =n-1; i>=0; i--) {\n\n        if (arr[i][j] == 'o' && last-1 >=0) {\n\n            last =i; \n\n        } else if (arr[i][j] == '*' && last-1 >=0) {\n\n            // TODO: move this star to last-1, then decrement last. \n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the idea is that whenever we find a stone, we can place it at last-1, then set last to last-1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should do the following for the else if block (when the cell is a star):\n\n- We can set arr[i][j] to '.' (since the stone is moving down). \n\n- Then, set arr[last-1][j] to '*' (placing it there). \n\n- Then, decrement last by 1. \n\nBut this might have issues because when processing from the bottom up, the stone is being moved to a lower row (which has already been processed). \n\nWait, but in the loop, we are processing from bottom to top. So when we are at row i, the rows below i have already been processed. \n\nWait, for example, suppose we are at row i, and we move the stone to last-1 (which is a row below i). Since we are processing from bottom up, the rows below i have already been processed, so moving the stone there won't interfere with previous steps. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the 'last' variable is being tracked. \n\nLet me try to think of an example. \n\nExample 1:\n\nColumn has:\n\nRow 2: *\n\nRow 1: .\n\nRow 0: o \n\nn=3 rows. \n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at 3. \n\ni=2 (bottom row):\n\ncell is *, so:\n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1][j] (3-1=2) to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nThen, last becomes 2. \n\nWait, but that's the same position. \n\nHmm, maybe the code should first check if the current position is above the last. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should only move the stone if the current position is above the last. \n\nWait, perhaps the condition is that if the current cell is a star, then we can move it to last-1, but only if last-1 is above the current position. \n\nWait, but in this case, the current position is the bottom row, so last-1 is 2 (same as current row). \n\nHmm, maybe the code should first check if the current cell is a star and can be moved down. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should first move the stone to last-1, then set last to last-1. \n\nWait, in the example above, after moving the stone, last becomes 2. \n\nThen, moving up to i=1 (row1):\n\ncell is '.', so nothing. \n\ni=0 (row0) is 'o', so set last =0. \n\nSo after processing this row, last is 0. \n\nNow, when we process the stone at row0? No, the stone was at row2. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach works. \n\nAnother example: \n\nColumn:\n\nRow3: *\n\nRow2: *\n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: *\n\nn=4 rows. \n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at 4. \n\ni=3 (bottom row):\n\ncell is *, so:\n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[3][j] (last-1 is 3) to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nThen last becomes 3. \n\ni=2 (row2):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[2][j] (last-1 is 2) \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes 2. \n\ni=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to 1. \n\ni=0 (row0) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1][j] (0) to '*' \u2192 so the stone is placed at row0. \n\nThen last becomes 0. \n\nSo the final column would have:\n\nRow3: . \n\nRow2: . \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nWait, but the stone at row0 can't fall below the obstacle at row1. So it should be placed at row0, which is correct. \n\nThe stones at rows 3 and 2 are moved down, but since the obstacle is at row1, they can't go below that. \n\nWait, the first stone (originally at row3) would be placed at last-1 when processed. \n\nWait, let's walk through the steps again for this example. \n\nProcessing the column:\n\nInitially last =4. \n\ni=3 (row3):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1][j] (3) to '*' \u2192 so no change. \n\nThen last becomes 3. \n\ni=2 (row2):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[2][j] (last-1 is 2) \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes 2. \n\ni=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to 1. \n\ni=0 (row0):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1][j] (0) to '*' \u2192 so the stone is placed at row0. \n\nlast becomes 0. \n\nSo the final column has:\n\nRow3: . \n\nRow2: . \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nThe stones from rows 3 and 2 are now gone except the one at row0. \n\nWait, but the stones at rows 3 and 2 should fall down until they hit the obstacle at row1. \n\nSo the stones at row3 and 2 should fall to row1-1 = row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1. So the stones can fall down to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, no. The obstacle is at row1, so stones can't go below that. So the stones above can fall down to the rows above the obstacle. \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1. So the stones can fall down to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't go below row1. So the stones can fall to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't be placed below it. So the available positions are rows 0 and 1? \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can fall down to row0 (since row1 is the obstacle). \n\nWait, the stones can fall until they hit the obstacle. So the stones from row3 and 2 would fall down to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the first stone (originally at row3) would fall down to row0 (since the obstacle is at row1, so the lowest possible is row0). \n\nThe second stone (row2) would fall to row1? \n\nWait, but the obstacle is at row1, so the stone can't go below that. So the stone at row2 can fall to row1? \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stone can't be placed at row1. Because the obstacle is there. \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't go below that. So the stones can fall to the highest possible position above the obstacle. \n\nWait, perhaps the stones can be placed in the rows between the obstacle and the bottom. \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1. So the available positions for stones are rows 0 and 1? \n\nNo, because the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't be placed in row1. \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can fall down to row0, and the next stone can't go below that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct. \n\nIn the example, after processing, the stones from rows3 and 2 are moved to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, in the code's processing, the first stone (row3) is moved to row3 (no change). \n\nThen the second stone (row2) is moved to row2 (no change). \n\nThen when we hit the obstacle at row1, last is set to 1. \n\nThen the stone at row0 is moved to row0 (since last-1 is 0). \n\nSo the final positions are:\n\nRow3: . \n\nRow2: . \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nBut the stones from rows3 and 2 are now gone except the one at row0. \n\nWait, that's not correct. The stones at rows3 and 2 should fall down to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1. So the stones can't go below that. So the stones can fall down to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the stone at row3 can fall down to row0 (since row1 is obstacle). \n\nThe stone at row2 can fall to row1? But row1 is obstacle. So it can't. \n\nWait, the stone at row2 can fall down until it hits the obstacle. So it would stop at row1-1 = row0. \n\nWait, so all stones should end up at row0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should track the available positions and collect the stones first. \n\nLet me think of another approach. \n\nFor each column j:\n\n- We can collect all the stones and obstacles in the column. \n\n- Then, we can process the column from the bottom up, placing the stones in the available spots. \n\nThe steps could be:\n\n1. For each column j:\n\n   a. Create a list to hold the stones and obstacles. \n\n   b. Iterate from bottom to top, and collect all the stones and obstacles. \n\n   c. Then, iterate again from bottom to top, and place the stones in the available positions. \n\nWait, perhaps the following steps:\n\n- For each column j:\n\n   - Create a list to hold the stones and obstacles. \n\n   - Iterate from bottom to top (i from n-1 downto 0):\n\n      - if cell is 'o', add to the list. \n\n      - if cell is '*', add to the list. \n\n      - else (.), ignore. \n\n   - Now, the list contains the obstacles and stones in reverse order (from bottom up). \n\n   - Then, we can process the list to determine where the stones should be placed. \n\n   - The stones should be placed starting from the bottom, but above any obstacles. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, here's the correct approach for the code's current structure. \n\nThe code's current structure is processing each column, and for each row from bottom to top. \n\nThe 'last' variable is the first row (from the bottom) where an obstacle is found. \n\nWhen a stone is encountered, it can be placed at last-1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should do the following in the else if block (when the cell is a star):\n\n- We can set arr[i][j] to '.' (since the stone is moving down). \n\n- Then, set arr[last-1][j] to '*' (placing it there). \n\n- Then, decrement last by 1. \n\nThis way, the stone is moved to the next available position, and the next stone can be placed one row above. \n\nLet me test this with the first example where the column is:\n\nRow3: *\n\nRow2: .\n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: *\n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at 4. \n\ni=3 (row3):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[3][j] (last-1 is 3) to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nThen last becomes 3. \n\ni=2 (row2) is '.' \u2192 nothing. \n\ni=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to 1. \n\ni=0 (row0) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1][j] (0) to '*' \u2192 so the stone is placed at row0. \n\nlast becomes 0. \n\nThe final column would have:\n\nRow3: . \n\nRow2: . \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example where the column is:\n\nRow3: *\n\nRow2: *\n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: *\n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at4. \n\ni=3 (row3):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes3. \n\ni=2 (row2):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes2. \n\ni=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to1. \n\ni=0 (row0):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes0. \n\nThe final column would have:\n\nRow3: . \n\nRow2: . \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nBut the stones at rows3 and 2 should also fall down. \n\nWait, the first stone (row3) is moved to row3 (no change). \n\nThe second stone (row2) is moved to row2 (no change). \n\nBut after the obstacle is at row1, the stones at rows3 and 2 are above the obstacle. \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't fall below that. \n\nThe stones at rows3 and 2 can fall down to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't go below that. So the stones can fall down to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the stone at row3 can fall down to row0 (since the obstacle is at row1). \n\nThe stone at row2 can fall to row1? But row1 is obstacle. \n\nHmm, so the stones at rows3 and 2 can only fall to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, the stone at row2 can fall down to row1, but since row1 is obstacle, it can't. So it can only go to row0. \n\nWait, the stones should be placed in the available spots between the bottom and the obstacle. \n\nThe available spots are rows0 and 1? \n\nNo, because the obstacle is at row1. So the available spots are rows0. \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't be placed below row1. So the available positions are rows0 and 1? \n\nNo, because the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't be placed in row1. \n\nSo the available positions are rows0. \n\nSo the two stones (originally at rows3 and 2) plus the one at row0 would all fall to row0. \n\nBut in the code's approach, only the stone at row0 is placed there. \n\nHmm, so the code's approach is not working for this case. \n\nAh, I see the problem. The code's current approach only moves the stone to last-1, but when there are multiple stones above an obstacle, they should be placed in the available spots from bottom up. \n\nIn the example, after the obstacle at row1, the available spots are rows0. \n\nThe stones from rows3,2, and0 should all be placed in row0. But since there are three stones, they can't all fit. \n\nWait, the stones are three in total. The available spots are only row0. So they can't all fit. \n\nWait, the stones can only be placed in the available spots between the obstacle and the bottom. \n\nThe available spots are from the bottom up to the obstacle's row minus 1. \n\nIn this case, the obstacle is at row1, so the available spots are rows0. \n\nSo only one stone can be placed there. \n\nThe other stones would have to stack above? \n\nWait, no. The stones fall down until they hit an obstacle or another stone. \n\nSo the stones above the obstacle can fall down to the available spots. \n\nThe stones in the example are at rows3,2, and0. \n\nThe obstacle is at row1. \n\nThe stones at rows3 and2 can fall down to row0 and row1? \n\nWait, row1 is obstacle, so they can't go there. \n\nSo the stones can fall down to row0. \n\nBut there's already a stone at row0. \n\nWait, the stone at row0 is also part of the column. \n\nSo all three stones would fall down to row0, but since they can't stack below, they would form a stack above. \n\nWait, no. The stones fall until they hit something. \n\nThe stones fall one by one. \n\nThe stone at row3 would fall down to row0 (since below that is obstacle). \n\nThe stone at row2 would fall down to row0 (since row1 is obstacle). \n\nThe stone at row0 is already there. \n\nSo the final positions would have three stones in row0? \n\nBut the grid can only have one cell per row. \n\nAh, no, each column has multiple rows. \n\nWait, in the column, each row has one cell. \n\nSo in this example, the three stones would all fall to row0, but since it's a single cell, they can't. \n\nWait, no, each column has multiple rows. \n\nWait, the column has rows0-3. \n\nThe stones at rows3 and2 would fall down to row0. \n\nThe stone at row0 is already there. \n\nSo the stones would stack on top of each other? \n\nNo, because when they fall, they can only occupy one cell. \n\nWait, the stones fall down until they hit an obstacle or another stone. \n\nSo the stone at row3 would fall down to row0 (since below that is obstacle). \n\nThe stone at row2 would fall down to row0 (since row1 is obstacle and row0 is now occupied by the first stone). \n\nWait, no. \n\nLet me think step by step:\n\nInitially, the stones are at rows3,2,0. \n\nThe obstacle is at row1. \n\nThe stone at row3 will fall down. \n\nIt can move down to row2 (empty?), but row2 has a stone. \n\nWait, no, the stone at row2 is also falling. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to process each column and for each column, collect all the stones and then place them in the available spots from the bottom up. \n\nSo for each column j:\n\n- Collect all the stones in the column. \n\n- Then, process the column from the bottom up, and whenever an obstacle is encountered, place the stones collected so far in the available spots between the current position and the obstacle. \n\nWait, here's a better plan:\n\nFor each column j:\n\n- Create a list to hold the stones. \n\n- Also, track the positions of obstacles. \n\n- Iterate from bottom to top, and whenever an obstacle is found, we can place the collected stones in the available spots between the current obstacle and the previous one. \n\n- The available spots are from the previous obstacle's position (or bottom) up to the current obstacle's position minus 1. \n\n- Then, reset the stones list. \n\n- After processing all rows, place any remaining stones in the available spots from the top. \n\nThis might be the way to go. \n\nLet me try to code this approach. \n\nAlternatively, here's the code's current structure. The code has a loop for each column j, and for each row i from bottom to top. \n\nThe 'last' variable is the first row (from the bottom) where an obstacle is found. \n\nThe code needs to handle the case when a stone is found. \n\nThe correct approach is to move the stone to the last-1 position, then decrement last. \n\nWait, in the example where the column has three stones above an obstacle:\n\nThe code's approach would process the first stone (row3):\n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1 (3)] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes 3. \n\nThen the second stone (row2):\n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes 2. \n\nThen the obstacle at row1 sets last to 1. \n\nThen the third stone (row0):\n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes 0. \n\nThe final column would have the stones at rows3,2,0. \n\nBut this is incorrect because the stones should have fallen to row0. \n\nHmm, so the code's approach is not working for this case. \n\nAh, I see the problem. The code's current approach only moves the stone to last-1, but when there are multiple stones above an obstacle, they should be placed in the available spots from bottom up. \n\nThe 'last' variable is being decremented each time a stone is placed, so the first stone is placed at last-1 (3), then the next at 2, etc. \n\nBut when an obstacle is encountered, the last is set to the obstacle's row. \n\nSo in the example with the obstacle at row1, after processing the obstacle, the last is 1. \n\nThe stone at row0 is then placed at last-1 (0), which is correct. \n\nThe stones at rows3 and2 are placed at 3 and 2, but since the obstacle is at row1, those positions are below the obstacle. \n\nWait, no. The obstacle is at row1, so the stones can't be placed below that. \n\nAh, here's the mistake. \n\nWhen the obstacle is encountered at row1, the 'last' is set to 1. \n\nThe stones above the obstacle (rows0,2,3) are processed after that. \n\nWait, no. The code processes the rows from bottom to top. \n\nIn the example, the rows are processed in order 3,2,1,0. \n\nWhen processing row1 (the obstacle), last is set to 1. \n\nThen, when processing row0 (the stone), it is placed at last-1 (0). \n\nThe stones at rows3 and2 were processed before the obstacle. \n\nAt that time, last was 4 (initially), then after processing row3, last becomes3. \n\nThen row2 is processed, last becomes2. \n\nThen row1 is processed (obstacle), last becomes1. \n\nSo the stones at rows3 and2 were placed at positions3 and2, which are below the obstacle (row1). \n\nWhich is incorrect. \n\nAh, this is the problem. \n\nThe code's current approach allows stones to be placed below the obstacle because they were processed before the obstacle was encountered. \n\nSo the code's logic is flawed. \n\nThe correct approach should be that when an obstacle is encountered, any stones above it can only be placed above the obstacle. \n\nThus, the 'last' variable should be set to the obstacle's row, and any stones encountered after that (when processing upwards) can be placed in the available spots between the obstacle and the bottom. \n\nWait, but the code processes from bottom to top. So the obstacle is processed after the stones below it. \n\nHmm, this is the crux of the problem. \n\nThe code's current approach is processing the rows from bottom to top. \n\nWhen a stone is encountered before an obstacle (i.e., below the obstacle), it is placed at last-1, which is below the obstacle. \n\nBut that's not allowed. \n\nSo the code's logic is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach must ensure that stones are only placed above obstacles. \n\nThus, the 'last' variable should represent the first row (from the bottom) where an obstacle is found. \n\nSo when processing a stone, it can only be placed in the available spots between the current position and the obstacle. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'last' variable should be the first obstacle encountered from below. \n\nWait, perhaps the 'last' variable should be the first obstacle or the bottom. \n\nThe idea is that 'last' is the first position where a stone cannot fall further down. \n\nThus, when processing a stone at row i, the stone can fall to the position last-1. \n\nBut 'last' is the first obstacle or the bottom. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct, but the example I considered is wrong. \n\nWait, in the example where the obstacle is at row1, the stones at rows3 and2 are below the obstacle. \n\nWait, no. The obstacle is at row1. So rows0 and1 are above the obstacle? \n\nWait, rows are numbered from 0 (top) to n-1 (bottom). Or is it the other way around? \n\nWait, the problem says the grid has n rows and m columns. The input is given as n lines, each line is a row. \n\nAssuming that the first line of input is the top row, and the last line is the bottom row. \n\nWait, the code reads the input as: \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) {\n\n   String x = s.next();\n\n   for (j=0..m-1) arr[i][j] = x.charAt(j);\n\n}\n\nSo row 0 is the first row (top), and row n-1 is the bottom row. \n\nAh! This is crucial. \n\nIn the previous examples, I assumed that row0 is the bottom, but in reality, row n-1 is the bottom. \n\nSo in the example where the column has rows 0 to3 (n=4), row3 is the bottom. \n\nSo the first example I considered:\n\nColumn:\n\nRow3 (bottom): *\n\nRow2: .\n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0 (top): *\n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at4 (n=4). \n\nProcessing i from 3 downto0:\n\ni=3 (bottom row):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1 (3)] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes3. \n\ni=2 (row2):\n\ncell is '.' \u2192 nothing. \n\ni=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to1. \n\ni=0 (row0) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[last-1 (0)] to '*' \u2192 so the stone is placed at row0. \n\nlast becomes0. \n\nThe final column has:\n\nRow3: . \n\nRow2: . \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThe stone at row3 (bottom) is moved to row3 (no change). \n\nWait, but the obstacle is at row1. \n\nThe stone at row3 is below the obstacle (row1 is above row3?), no. \n\nWait, row3 is the bottom row. The obstacle is at row1, which is above it. \n\nSo the stone at row3 can fall down to the bottom (row3), which is correct. \n\nThe stone at row0 (top) is moved to row0. \n\nThe obstacle is at row1. \n\nThe stone at row0 can fall down to row0 (since it's above the obstacle). \n\nWait, the stone at row0 can fall down until it hits the obstacle at row1. \n\nSo it can fall to row0 (since row1 is obstacle). \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAnother example where the column is:\n\nRow3 (bottom): *\n\nRow2: *\n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0 (top): *\n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at4. \n\ni=3 (bottom row):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes3. \n\ni=2 (row2):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes2. \n\ni=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to1. \n\ni=0 (row0):\n\ncell is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes0. \n\nThe final column has:\n\nRow3: * \n\nRow2: * \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nBut the obstacle is at row1. \n\nThe stones at rows3 and2 are below the obstacle (row1 is above them). \n\nWait, row1 is above row2 and3. \n\nSo the obstacle is at row1, so the stones below it (rows2 and3) can fall down to the bottom (rows3 and2). \n\nThe stone at row0 can fall down to row0. \n\nSo the final positions are correct. \n\nThe stones at rows3 and2 are allowed to be there because they are below the obstacle. \n\nWait, the obstacle is at row1, so the stones can fall down to the bottom (row3) and row2. \n\nYes, because the obstacle is above them. \n\nSo the code's approach works. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nColumn:\n\nRow3 (bottom): . \n\nRow2: * \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at4. \n\ni=3 (bottom row) is '.' \u2192 nothing. \n\ni=2 (row2) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes2. \n\ni=1 (row1) is 'o' \u2192 set last to1. \n\ni=0 (row0) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[0][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes0. \n\nFinal column:\n\nRow3: . \n\nRow2: * \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nThe stone at row2 is below the obstacle (row1 is above it), so it can stay there. \n\nThe stone at row0 is placed at row0. \n\nThis is correct. \n\nAnother test case where the obstacle is in the middle:\n\nColumn:\n\nRow3 (bottom): * \n\nRow2: * \n\nRow1: * \n\nRow0: o \n\nProcessing this column:\n\nlast starts at4. \n\ni=3 (bottom row) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[3][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes3. \n\ni=2 (row2) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[2][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes2. \n\ni=1 (row1) is * \u2192 \n\n- set arr[1][j] to '.' \n\n- set arr[1][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nlast becomes1. \n\ni=0 (row0) is 'o' \u2192 set last to0. \n\nFinal column:\n\nRow3: * \n\nRow2: * \n\nRow1: * \n\nRow0: o \n\nThe stones are all below the obstacle (row0 is the top row, so the obstacle is at the top). \n\nThe stones can fall down to the bottom (rows3,2,1). \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThus, the code's approach seems to work. \n\nSo the missing code in the else if block is:\n\narr[i][j] = '.'; // remove the stone from current position \n\narr[last-1][j] = '*'; \n\nlast--; \n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the 'last' is being tracked. \n\nWait, the code's current code for the else if block (when cell is '*'):\n\nelse if(arr[i][j] == '*' && last-1 >=0) {\n\n    // move the stone to last-1 \n\n    arr[i][j] = '.'; \n\n    arr[last-1][j] = '*'; \n\n    last--; \n\n}\n\nThis should be the code. \n\nBut wait, in the code's current setup, the 'last' is initially n. \n\nWhen we process a stone at i, we set the current cell to '.' and place the stone at last-1. \n\nThen decrement last. \n\nThis way, the next stone will be placed one row above. \n\nYes, this should work. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\narr[i][j] = '.'; \n\narr[last-1][j] = '*'; \n\nlast--; \n\nThus, the code should be filled with those three lines in the else if block. \n\nWait, but what about the condition 'last-1 >=0'? \n\nThe code has '&& last-1 >=0' in the else if condition. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nelse if (arr[i][j] == '*' && last-1 >=0) {\n\n    // code here \n\n}\n\nThus, the code inside the else if block should be those three lines. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\narr[i][j] = '.'; \n\narr[last-1][j] = '*'; \n\nlast--; \n\nSo that's the code to fill in the TODO section. \n\nTesting this with the first example where the stone is at row3 (bottom):\n\nThe code would set arr[3][j] to '.' and then set arr[3][j] to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nBut that's okay because it's already in the correct position. \n\nWait, but the stone is already at the bottom, so it doesn't need to move. \n\nThe code would set it to '.' and then set it back to '*' \u2192 no change. \n\nBut the last is decremented to 3. \n\nThis is okay. \n\nAnother example where a stone is above an obstacle:\n\nColumn:\n\nRow3 (bottom): . \n\nRow2: * \n\nRow1: o \n\nRow0: * \n\nProcessing row2 (i=2):\n\nlast is initially4. \n\nSo last-1 is3. \n\nThe stone is moved to row3 (bottom). \n\nThen last becomes3. \n\nThus, the stone is placed at the bottom. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nYes, this should work. \n\nSo the missing code is those three lines."
