So the key is to find for each segment (non-W) whether it can be formed by some sequence of stamps. So how to check a single segment? Let me think of the possible segments. Let's consider a segment s of length m (m >=1). We need to see if it can be formed by some stamps. Let's think of the stamps as operations that set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The order of operations can be anything, but the final result must be the given segment.",

So the two B's are allowed because they are not adjacent in a way that requires a stamp to have set them. Hmm, so the key must be something else. Let me think of the possible patterns. Another approach: Let's model the problem as each stamp can be thought of as adding a pair of R and B in some order.",

So that would violate the condition. But the example says it's possible. So that can't be the case. Hmm, maybe the problem requires that the entire sequence can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. For example, in the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the pairs could be (R,B) and (B,B)? No, because the second pair is invalid. Alternatively, the pairs are (R,B) and (B,B) is not allowed. So how does it work? Wait, the two B's are from different pairs. The first B is from the first pair (R,B) as the second element.",

Perhaps the correct condition is that the segment cannot have two consecutive same colors. Wait, but the sixth example's segment has two B's in a row. So that's not it. Hmm. Let me think of the problem differently. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells, setting them to either RB or BR. The final colors are the result of all the stamps applied.

For each segment, it checks some condition. The initial code has a loop over each segment (sp in a). The result is \"YES\" unless some condition is violated. Perhaps the condition is that the segment has length 0 (but they are non-W, so no).",

The segment \"RBR\" has first R and last R \u2192 same \u2192 would that be invalid? Let me see if \"RBR\" can be formed. Yes: Stamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. The sequence is R B R \u2192 which is RBR. So first and last are same \u2192 allowed.

The segment \"RRB\" is okay. The segment \"RRBB\" is okay. The segment \"RBR\" is okay. The segment \"R\" is invalid. The segment \"WWB\" has a segment \"B\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 invalid. The first example's segment \"BRBB\" has length 4 \u2192 no three in a row \u2192 okay. The fifth example's segment \"BRBB\" has length 4 \u2192 okay. The sixth example's segment \"RBB\" is okay. The seventh test case's example is all W's \u2192 no segments \u2192 so it's okay. Thus, this seems to be the correct condition. So the code should: \n\nFor each segment: \n\n- If the length is 1 \u2192 invalid. - Else, check that there are no three consecutive same characters. Thus, the missing code in the loop over the segments would be: for(String sp:a){\n    if(sp.length() == 1){\n        res = \"NO\";\n        break;\n    }\n    for(int i=0; i<sp.length()-2; i++){\n        if(sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+1) && sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+2)){\n            res = \"NO\";\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if(res.equals(\"NO\")) break;\n} Wait, but the loop over the characters needs to check for three in a row. So the code inside the for loop over each segment would be: \n\nif the segment length is 1 \u2192 set res to NO and break. \n\nelse, loop from i=0 to i < sp.length() - 2: \n\nif sp[i] == sp[i+1] and sp[i] == sp[i+2], then set res to NO and break. Then, after checking all i, if any of them triggered a break, then the result is NO. Thus, the code would look like this. So the missing code is: for(String sp : a) {\n    if (sp.length() == 1) {\n        res = \"NO\";\n        break;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < sp.length() - 2; i++) {\n        if (sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+1) && sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+2)) {\n            res = \"NO\";\n            break;\n        }\n    } if (res.equals(\"NO\")) break;\n}\n\nThis should handle the conditions. Testing this with the sixth example's segment \"RBB\" (length 3): \n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to 0 (since 3-2=1 \u2192 i < 1 \u2192 i=0). Check i=0: sp[0] = 'R', sp[1]='B', sp[2]='B'. R != B \u2192 so no problem. Thus, no three in a row \u2192 okay. For a segment like \"BBB\" (length 3): \n\ni=0: all three are B \u2192 trigger NO. For a segment like \"RRB\" (length 3): \n\ni=0: R, R, B \u2192 first two are R, third is B \u2192 first two are same, but third is different \u2192 no three in a row. Thus, okay. For a segment like \"RRBB\" (length 4): \n\nCheck i=0: R, R, B \u2192 no three in a row. i=1: R, B, B \u2192 no three in a row. Thus, okay. Thus, this should work. So the missing code is as above.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to solve this problem. Let's read the problem carefully again. The task is to determine if a given string of R, B, and W can be formed by stamping pairs of neighboring cells, where each stamp turns one into R and the other into B, and the stamp can be applied multiple times. The key is to check if the given string can be achieved through these operations.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves looking for some pattern or condition that must be satisfied for the string to be possible. Let's think about the constraints. Each stamp affects two adjacent cells. So every non-white cell must be part of some such pair. But since stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, maybe the main thing is that the non-white parts must form certain sequences.\n\nWait, the stamp can be applied in either order: RB or BR. But each time you stamp, those two cells are set to those colors. However, applying the stamp again on the same cells would flip their colors again. Wait, no. Because each stamp application changes both cells. For example, if a cell is already R, and you stamp it as part of a BR pair, then it would become B. So the order and the number of times you stamp a particular pair matters.\n\nBut maybe the key is to look at the non-white segments. Because whenever there's a W, that's a cell that hasn't been stamped over, or has been stamped an even number of times (since each stamp flips it). Wait, no. Because each stamp on a cell changes its color. So if a cell is W, that means it was never part of any stamp? Or maybe it was part of an even number of stamps?\n\nWait, let's think: Each time a cell is under the stamp, its color is changed. The initial color is W. So for a cell to end up as W, it must have been stamped an even number of times (including zero). Because each stamp toggles its color. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nSuppose a cell is part of a stamp. Let's say the first time it's part of a stamp, it becomes either R or B. The next time, if it's part of another stamp, it would be toggled again. Wait, but the stamp's color depends on the direction. For example, if the stamp is applied as RB, then the first cell becomes R, the second B. If you apply the same stamp again on the same two cells, the first would go back to W? No, because the stamp's effect is to set them to R and B again. Wait, no. Wait the problem says \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp.\" So when you stamp, you set those two cells to the colors of the stamp (either RB or BR). So each time you stamp a pair, you overwrite their colors. So the order and the choices of which direction (RB or BR) you use each time matter a lot.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because the final colors depend on the last stamp applied to each cell, perhaps? Because if a cell is part of multiple stamps, the last stamp's color for that position would determine its final color.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that any non-W sequence must alternate between R and B in some way. Because each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. So any two adjacent non-W cells must form either an R followed by B or B followed by R. But since you can apply stamps multiple times, maybe overlapping, perhaps the non-W parts must form a pattern where every pair of consecutive non-W cells must alternate between R and B. Wait, but maybe not exactly, because overlapping stamps can interfere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string of non-W parts must form a sequence where no two identical colors are adjacent. Because each stamp can only create a pair of different colors. Wait, but if you stamp over the same pair again, you can change them again. For example, suppose you have two cells that were previously set to RB. If you stamp them again as BR, then they become BR. So the two cells can be in any order, but each time you stamp, you set them to either RB or BR. So the final colors of two adjacent cells can be any combination except WW? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in the final string, any two adjacent non-W cells must be different. Because each stamp can only create a pair of different colors. But if two non-W cells are adjacent and the same color, that would be impossible. Because any stamp that affects them would have to set them to different colors. Wait, but maybe they were part of different stamps. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the desired string is \"RR\". Is that possible? Let's see. To get two R's, how?\n\nThe first stamp could be applied to positions 1-2 as BR, making them B and R. Then another stamp on the same positions as RB, which would set them to R and B. But then the first cell is R, second is B. Not RR. Alternatively, maybe another approach. Wait, maybe it's impossible to have two R's adjacent. Because any stamp that affects both would set them to either RB or BR. So the only way to have two R's is if they are not adjacent? But then they can be set via separate stamps. Wait, but if they are not adjacent, then each R must be part of a pair with another cell. For example, if the string is \"RWR\", then each R is part of a pair with the W next to it. But the W would have to be part of a stamp as well. Wait, but the W is white, which means it was never part of a stamp? Or was part of an even number of stamps?\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think of the problem's constraints again. The problem says that the initial state is all white. Each stamp can be applied to any two neighboring cells, setting them to either RB or BR. The stamp can be applied multiple times, so overlapping is allowed. The question is whether the given string can be achieved through any number of such operations.\n\nLet me think of some examples:\n\nTest case 2,3,4 in the note have answers NO. For example, if the string is length 1, then it must be W, because you can't stamp a single cell. So if the input is \"R\" or \"B\", it's impossible. So any test case with n=1 and s not W is NO.\n\nAnother example: the fifth test case in the note is \"BRB\". The example shows that it can be done. Let's see:\n\nThe steps were WWW \u2192 WRB (stamp at positions 2-3 as RB), then stamp at 1-2 as BR, resulting in BRB. So the final string is BRB. So the two R and B are adjacent. Wait, in the final string, the first two are B and R, which is allowed. The third is B. So the second and third are R and B, which is also allowed. So the adjacent pairs are BR and RB, which are okay.\n\nAnother example: the sixth test case's result is \"RBB\". The steps are WWW \u2192 WRB (stamp at 2-3 as RB), then stamp at 1-2 as BR, resulting in BRB. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. The sixth test case's example is different. Let me check the note again. The sixth test case's example is \"RBB\". The steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W followed by RB (stamp at 2-3 as RB \u2192 positions 2 is R, 3 B. Then stamp at 1-2 as RB? Wait, no. The second step in the note's example is stamping the first two as BR, so first becomes B, second R. Then the third step is stamping the first two again as RB? Not sure. Anyway, the key is that the final string can have adjacent B and B? Wait in the sixth example, the final string is RBB. The second and third are B and B. Wait, how is that possible?\n\nWait, in the sixth test case's example, the steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 after first stamp (positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 \"WRB\".\n\nThen stamp positions 1-2 as RB? Wait, no. The note says the second step is stamping as BR on the first two, so first becomes B, second R. So after that, the string is BRB. Then the third step is stamping the first two again as RB? Or maybe the second step is stamping the first two as RB, leading to RR? No, that can't be. Wait the note says the sixth test case's example is:\n\nThe sixth test case's example is \"RBB\". The steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 W followed by RB (stamp at 2-3 as RB \u2192 \"WRB\".\n\nThen stamp the first two as RB (positions 1-2), which would set them to R and B. So the first two become R and B, so the string becomes RBB. So the second and third are B and B. Wait, but how did that happen? Because the second cell was R (from the first stamp) and then in the second stamp, when you stamp positions 1-2 as RB, the second cell (position 2) is set to B. So the second and third are B and B. So that's allowed. So two B's can be adjacent. So my previous thought that adjacent non-W must alternate is wrong.\n\nHmm, so that example shows that two B's can be adjacent. So that idea is incorrect. So what's the condition here?\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that any two consecutive non-W cells must form a pair that can be part of some stamp sequence. Let me think differently.\n\nEach stamp operation affects exactly two adjacent cells, setting them to either RB or BR. So every time you apply a stamp, you are creating a pair of different colors. However, overlapping stamps can overwrite previous colors. The final colors depend on the last stamp applied to each position. Wait, no. Because each stamp overwrites the colors. So the final color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that included it, and the direction (RB or BR) chosen for that stamp.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have three consecutive non-W cells with the same color? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string must not have three in a row where the first and third are the same, but the middle is different? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that any occurrence of two identical non-W colors must be separated by at least one W. But in the sixth example, the two B's are adjacent, so that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the non-W parts. Let's think of the string as being split into segments separated by W's. For each such segment (non-empty), we need to check if it can be formed by some combination of stamps.\n\nWait, the code given in the problem starts by splitting the string into parts separated by W. So the code is doing s.split(\"W\"), which would split the string into parts between W's. For example, \"BRBWB\" would split into [\"BRB\", \"B\"], since the W is between them. So each segment is a maximal sequence of non-W characters. The code then loops over each of these segments and checks some condition. If any segment is invalid, the result is \"NO\".\n\nSo the idea is that each non-W segment must satisfy some condition. So the problem reduces to checking each such segment individually. Because the W's are separators, and each segment must be formable by stamps without involving the W's (since W's are untouched except by stamps that include them, but if a segment is between W's, then the stamps affecting that segment can't go beyond the W's, since otherwise they would affect the next segment. Wait, but stamps can be applied anywhere. So maybe the splitting into segments is a good approach because the W's can't be part of any stamp that affects the segments. Wait, no. Because a W could be part of a stamp that's applied to it and the next non-W character. But if the segment is between W's, then the stamps that form the segment can't include the W's, because those W's are part of the separators. Hmm, perhaps the splitting is a way to handle each non-W segment as a separate problem, since the W's can't be part of any stamp that affects the segments. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the string is \"BRWBR\". The split would be [\"BR\", \"BR\"]. Each of these segments must be formable by stamps. The W in the middle is a separator, so the two segments are independent. So each segment must be a valid sequence on its own. So the problem reduces to checking each non-W segment to see if it can be formed by some stamps, and if all of them can, then the answer is YES.\n\nSo the key is to find for each segment (non-W) whether it can be formed by some sequence of stamps. So how to check a single segment?\n\nLet me think of the possible segments. Let's consider a segment s of length m (m >=1). We need to see if it can be formed by some stamps. Let's think of the stamps as operations that set two adjacent cells to either RB or BR. The order of operations can be anything, but the final result must be the given segment.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that in the segment, every pair of consecutive characters must alternate between R and B. Because each stamp can only set two adjacent cells to different colors. But overlapping stamps can change this. Wait, but in the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the last two are B and B. So that's two same colors in a row, which would violate that idea. So that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire segment must be a sequence that can be built by overlapping stamps. Let's think of the minimal way to form a segment. Each stamp adds two characters (either RB or BR). But overlapping can allow building longer sequences.\n\nWait, perhaps the segment must have even length? No, because in the example given in the problem statement, the fifth test case's result is \"BRBB\" (or similar?), but let me check the note again. The fifth test case's example is \"BRBB\" (the input is \"BRBBW\" perhaps?), but the example's final string is \"BRBBW\". The segment \"BRBB\" has length 4, which is even. The sixth test case's example is \"RBB\", which is length 3. Wait, that's odd. So that idea is invalid.\n\nHmm, so the sixth test case's segment is \"RBB\" (length 3). How is that possible? Let's see the steps again. The steps were:\n\nStart with WWW \u2192 after first stamp on positions 2-3 (RB), the string is WRB. Then stamp on positions 1-2 as BR (so first becomes B, second R). So the string becomes BRB. Then, perhaps another stamp on positions 2-3 as BB? No, because stamps can only set to RB or BR. Wait, the sixth test case's example in the note says the sixth case's steps are:\n\nWWW \u2192 WRB (stamp 2-3 as RB), then stamp 1-2 as RB (so first becomes R, second B). So the string becomes RBB. So the third character is B. So the segment is RBB. The third character is B. So the second and third are B and B. So how did that happen?\n\nThe second stamp was applied to positions 1-2 as RB. So position 1 becomes R, position 2 becomes B. The third position was already B from the first stamp. So the third position remains B. So the two B's are allowed. So the problem is that the two B's are allowed as long as they are not part of the same stamp's pair. Because the second and third positions were part of the first stamp (as positions 2-3, set to R and B). Then the second position was changed again by the second stamp (position 1-2 set to R and B, so position 2 becomes B). So the third position remains B. So the two B's are allowed because they are not adjacent in a way that requires a stamp to have set them.\n\nHmm, so the key must be something else. Let me think of the possible patterns.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as each stamp can be thought of as adding a pair of R and B in some order. The final colors are the result of all these pairs overlapping. But since each stamp overwrites the previous colors, the final color of each cell is determined by the last stamp that covered it, and the direction (RB or BR) chosen for that stamp.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because each stamp overwrites the colors of the two cells. So the last stamp that affects a particular cell determines its color. So for a cell at position i, the color is determined by the last stamp that included it, and whether it was the first or second in the stamp's pair.\n\nTherefore, for the entire segment, the colors must be such that for every position, the color is part of some pair (either as the first or second element of a stamp's pair), and the pairs can be arranged in such a way that their overlaps are consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must be such that every two consecutive characters are either R and B or B and R, except when separated by a W. Wait, but in the sixth example, the two B's are consecutive. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem can be rephrased as follows: the sequence of non-W characters must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B in some way. Because each stamp is a pair, and the final colors must be the result of some combination of these pairs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire non-W segment must have an even number of characters? But the sixth example's segment is length 3, which is odd. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is that in the non-W segments, the number of R's and B's must differ by at most one. But in the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", there are 1 R and 2 B's. The difference is 1, which is okay. The fifth example's segment \"BRB\" has 1 R and 2 B's. The difference is 1. The first example's segment (the one in the problem statement) is BRBB, which has 1 R and 3 B's. The difference is 2, but that's allowed? Wait, the first example's final string is BRBBW, so the segment is BRBB (length 4). So R count is 1, B is 3. The difference is 2. Hmm, so that idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the counts of R and B in each segment can be anything, but the sequence must alternate between R and B except for some conditions. Not sure.\n\nLet me think of the possible segments that are invalid. For example, the second test case in the note has a single R. Since you can't stamp a single cell, that's impossible. So any segment of length 1 that is not W is invalid. So segments of length 1 must be empty (but they are non-W, so they can't be). So any segment of length 1 (like \"R\" or \"B\") is invalid. So that's one condition.\n\nAnother example: the third test case in the note is \"WWB\", so the segment is \"B\" (length 1) \u2192 invalid.\n\nAnother example: a segment like \"RR\" would be invalid? Let's see. Can we get \"RR\"?\n\nSuppose the segment is \"RR\". To get two R's adjacent. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 first is B, second R. Then stamp again on the same positions as RB \u2192 first R, second B. Not helpful. Alternatively, stamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 first R, second B. Then stamp positions 1-2 again as RB \u2192 R and B again. So that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe another approach. Hmm, perhaps it's impossible to have two R's in a row. Because any stamp covering both would set them to either RB or BR. So the only way to have two R's is if they are not adjacent? But then they can be part of separate stamps. Wait, but if they are not adjacent, then the cell between them must be W. But in the segment, there are no W's. So for a segment like \"RR\", it's impossible. So \"RR\" is invalid. Similarly, \"BB\" is also invalid?\n\nWait, but in the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the last two are B and B. How was that possible?\n\nAh, because the two B's are not part of the same stamp's pair. Let me see the steps again for the sixth example's segment \"RBB\":\n\nThe first stamp was on positions 2-3 (RB \u2192 positions 2 is R, 3 is B). Then the second stamp was on positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 position 1 becomes R, position 2 becomes B. So the second position was R (from first stamp) then changed to B (second stamp). The third position remains B. So the two B's are at positions 2 and 3. But the second stamp's pair was positions 1-2 (RB), so the second position was set to B. The third position was set by the first stamp to B and not changed again. So the two B's are allowed because they are not part of the same stamp's pair. So the key is that the two B's are allowed as long as they are not part of the same stamp's pair. So the problem is not about the sequence of the entire segment, but about the possibility of arranging stamps such that their overlapping can produce the desired colors.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern that each segment must follow. Let me think of the following:\n\nEach non-W segment must be such that it can be represented as a sequence of overlapping RB or BR pairs. The way to model this is that for any position in the segment, except the first and last, the color must be part of a pair with the previous and next. Alternatively, perhaps the entire sequence must alternate between R and B, except possibly at the ends. Wait, but the sixth example's segment is RBB, which ends with two B's. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire segment must have no three consecutive same colors. But in the sixth example, there are two B's, which is allowed. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, maybe the key is that in the segment, every pair of consecutive characters must be either RB, BR, or one of them is part of a previous or next pair. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the stamps as forming a sequence of overlapping pairs. Each stamp is a pair of R and B in some order. The final colors are the result of all these pairs. Since each stamp overwrites the previous colors, the final color of each position is determined by the last stamp that covered it. So for the entire segment, the colors must be such that for every position, it is part of at least one stamp's pair, and the pairs can be arranged in such a way that their overlapping is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire segment must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B. For example, in the segment \"RBB\", the pairs could be (R,B) and (B,B)? No, because the second pair can't be BB. So that's not possible. Wait, but how did the example work?\n\nWait in the example of \"RBB\", the first pair was positions 2-3 (RB), then the second pair was 1-2 (RB). So the first pair is R and B (positions 2 and 3?), no. Wait the first stamp was on positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 positions 2 is R, 3 is B. The second stamp was on 1-2 as RB \u2192 position 1 becomes R, position 2 becomes B. So the final sequence is R (position 1), B (position 2), B (position 3). So the pairs used were (positions 2-3 as RB) and (1-2 as RB). The overlapping at position 2 allows the two B's. So the final sequence has two B's in a row, but they are from different stamps. \n\nHmm, so the key is that the sequence can have two same colors in a row as long as they are not part of the same stamp's pair. So the problem is not about the sequence's colors but about whether the sequence can be built by some combination of overlapping pairs of R and B.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe there's a pattern that each segment must have an even number of characters? Let's see:\n\nThe sixth example's segment is length 3 (odd), which is allowed. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: For any segment, the number of R's and B's must differ by at most 1. Let's see:\n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", there is 1 R and 2 B's \u2192 difference 1 \u2192 okay.\n\nThe first example's segment \"BRBB\" has 1 R and 3 B's \u2192 difference 2 \u2192 but that's allowed? Wait the first example's final string is BRBBW, so the segment is BRBB (length 4). So R count is 1, B is 3 \u2192 difference 2. But according to the note, it's possible. So that idea is invalid.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that the entire segment must be a sequence where every two consecutive characters are either R and B or B and R, except possibly for the first and last characters. Wait, but in the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the last two are B and B, which violates that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire segment must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B. For example, the segment \"RBB\" can be formed by the pairs (R,B) and (B,B)? No, because the second pair can't be BB. So that's not possible. Wait, but in the example, the two B's are from different pairs. The first B (position 2) comes from the first pair (R,B) as the second element, and the second B (position 3) comes from the first pair's second element. The second pair (positions 1-2 as RB) sets position 2 to B. So the two B's are from different pairs. So the sequence can have two B's in a row as long as they are from different pairs.\n\nHmm, perhaps the only condition is that the segment cannot have three consecutive same colors. Let's see:\n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", there are two B's, which is okay. If there were three B's in a row, like \"BBB\", then it would be impossible. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the segment is \"BBB\". Can we form this?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with three W's. To get BBB:\n\nFirst, stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B and R. Then stamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R and B. Now the sequence is B R B. Then stamp positions 1-2 as BR again \u2192 B and R. So the first two are B and R. The third is B. So the sequence is B R B. Not BBB. Alternatively, maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, stamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R and B. Then stamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 B and R. So the sequence is R B R. Not helpful. Hmm, maybe it's impossible to get three B's in a row. So the condition would be that no three same colors in a row. But the sixth example's segment has two B's, which is allowed. So the condition would be that there are no three in a row of the same color. But how to check that?\n\nWait, but what about a segment like \"BRBRB\"? That has alternating colors, which is okay. So that would be allowed. \n\nAnother example: \"BRB\" is allowed. \"RBR\" is allowed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that in the segment, there are no three consecutive same colors. So for any three consecutive characters, they can't all be R or all be B. \n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples:\n\nThe sixth example's segment is \"RBB\" \u2192 the last two are B's, but there are only two, so okay. \n\nA segment like \"BBB\" would be invalid (three B's in a row). \n\nAnother example: \"RBRB\" is okay. \n\nAnother example: \"RRB\" \u2192 two R's followed by B. The first two R's are consecutive. Are they allowed? Let's see if that can be formed.\n\nSuppose the segment is \"RRB\". Can we get this?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with three W's. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R and B. Then stamp positions 1-2 again as RB \u2192 R and B again. So first two are R and B. Then stamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B and R. So the sequence would be R B R. Not RRB. \n\nAlternatively, another approach:\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B and R. Then stamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 R and B. So the sequence is B R B. Not helpful. \n\nHmm, maybe it's impossible to have two R's in a row. So the condition would be that there are no two consecutive same colors except possibly at the ends? Or that any two consecutive same colors must be separated by a W? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only invalid case is when a segment has two consecutive same colors and the length is 1. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the key is that in any segment, the colors must alternate between R and B, except possibly for the first and last characters. For example, the segment can start with R followed by B, then R, etc., but the first and last can be same. \n\nWait, let's see the sixth example's segment \"RBB\". The first character is R, then B, then B. The last two are B's, so that breaks the alternation. So that would be invalid under this condition, but the example says it's valid. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem differently. Let's consider that each stamp can be represented as either RB or BR. The final colors are the result of all the stamps applied, with each stamp overwriting the previous colors. So the final color of each position is determined by the last stamp that covered it. \n\nSuppose we have a segment of length m. Let's think of the stamps applied to this segment. Each stamp covers two adjacent positions. The last stamp covering each position determines its color. \n\nThe key idea is that for the entire segment, the colors must be such that for every position except possibly the first and last, the color must be part of a pair with its neighbor. \n\nWait, perhaps the entire segment must be such that it can be covered by a set of overlapping pairs (each being RB or BR) such that every position is covered by at least one pair, and the pairs' colors match the final colors. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR, or one of them is part of a previous or next pair. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence must be a sequence where every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR, except possibly for the first and last pair. \n\nWait, let's think of the sixth example's segment \"RBB\". The first two are R and B (okay), the second and third are B and B (invalid). So that would violate the condition. But the example says it's possible. So that can't be the case.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem requires that the entire sequence can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of RB or BR. For example, in the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the pairs could be (R,B) and (B,B)? No, because the second pair is invalid. Alternatively, the pairs are (R,B) and (B,B) is not allowed. So how does it work?\n\nWait, the two B's are from different pairs. The first B is from the first pair (R,B) as the second element. The second B is from the second pair (R,B) as the second element. So the two B's are from different pairs. So the overlapping allows this. \n\nHmm, perhaps the only condition is that the entire segment cannot have three consecutive same colors. Let me see:\n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", there are two B's, which is okay. A segment like \"BBB\" would have three B's, which is invalid. \n\nAnother example: \"RRB\" has two R's. Can that be formed?\n\nLet me try to see:\n\nSuppose the segment is \"RRB\". Let's see:\n\nStart with three W's. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B and R. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 again as BR \u2192 B and R again. \n\nThen stamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 R and B. \n\nThe final sequence would be B R B. Not RRB. \n\nAlternatively, another approach:\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R and B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B and R. \n\nThe sequence is R B R. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: Stamp positions 1-2 as RB (R and B), then stamp positions 1-2 again as RB (R and B again). So first two are R and B. Then stamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 B and B? No, because the second position is B, so stamping 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. So the sequence would be R R B. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst stamp on 1-2 as RB \u2192 positions 1: R, 2: B. \n\nSecond stamp on 2-3 as RB \u2192 position 2 becomes R, position 3 becomes B. \n\nSo the final sequence is R (position 1), R (position 2), B (position 3). So that gives \"RRB\". \n\nAh! So this is possible. So the two R's are allowed. So the condition of no three same in a row is not sufficient. \n\nSo the previous idea is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's the pattern here? \n\nIn the example of \"RRB\", the two R's are adjacent. The first R is from the first stamp's first position, and the second R is from the second stamp's first position. \n\nSo the two R's are allowed as long as they are part of different pairs. \n\nSo the key is that the sequence can have any arrangement of R and B, as long as there is no three in a row of the same color? Or maybe not even that?\n\nWait, let's see if three in a row is possible. Let's try to make \"RRR\".\n\nCan we get three R's in a row?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with three W's. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B and R. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R and B. \n\nNow the sequence is B R B. \n\nThen stamp positions 1-2 as BR again \u2192 B and R. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR again \u2192 R and B. \n\nStill B R B. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAnother approach:\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R and B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 B and B. \n\nWait, no. The second stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nWait, let's try:\n\nStamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B? No, because the second stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nSo after first two stamps, the sequence is R (1), R (2), B (3). \n\nThen stamp positions 1-2 again as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nSo the sequence becomes R B B. \n\nHmm, not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another sequence of stamps:\n\nStamp 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, after first two stamps: B R R B? No, the third position is B. \n\nHmm, I'm not able to get three R's in a row. So perhaps three in a row is impossible. \n\nSo the condition might be that the segment cannot have three of the same color in a row. \n\nLet me see the sixth example's segment \"RBB\" has two B's, which is allowed. \n\nAnother example: \"RBRB\" is allowed. \n\nA segment like \"RBR\" is allowed. \n\nA segment like \"RRB\" is allowed (as shown earlier). \n\nA segment like \"BBR\" is allowed. \n\nA segment like \"RRBB\" would have two R's followed by two B's. \n\nCan that be formed?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with four W's. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nNow the sequence is R B B R. \n\nHmm, not what we want. \n\nAnother approach:\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, the second stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nSo after first two stamps: R (1), R (2), B (3), W (4). \n\nThen stamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nSo the sequence is R R B R. \n\nHmm, not RRBB. \n\nAlternatively:\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nThe sequence is R B R B. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nSo the sequence is R B W R B? No, the third position is W. \n\nWait, the segment is \"RRBB\", so the W's are not part of it. So the four cells are all non-W. \n\nSo the initial is four W's. \n\nStamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nNow the sequence is R B B R. \n\nNot RRBB. \n\nHmm. \n\nStamp 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, the second stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nSo after first two stamps: R (1), R (2), B (3), W (4). \n\nThen stamp 3-4 as RB \u2192 B R. \n\nSo the sequence is R R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, stamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThe sequence is B R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nIt's challenging to get RRBB. \n\nPerhaps it's not possible. So the segment \"RRBB\" would be invalid. \n\nSo the condition is that there are no three consecutive same colors. \n\nSo the rule is: in each non-W segment, there must be no three consecutive same colors. \n\nLet me check this with previous examples:\n\nThe sixth example's segment \"RBB\" has two B's \u2192 okay. \n\nThe \"RRB\" segment has two R's \u2192 okay. \n\nThe \"RRBB\" segment has two R's followed by two B's \u2192 no three in a row \u2192 allowed? But according to my attempts, it might not be possible. \n\nWait, let's try again for \"RRBB\":\n\nSuppose the segment is four characters: R R B B. \n\nLet me try:\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, the second stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nSo after first two stamps: R (1), R (2), B (3), W (4). \n\nThen stamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nSo the sequence is R R B R. \n\nNot what we want. \n\nAnother approach:\n\nStamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThe sequence is B R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, stamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThen stamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nThe sequence after first three stamps: R (1), R (2), B (3), R (4). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, stamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThe sequence is R B R B. \n\nHmm. \n\nIt seems challenging to get two R's followed by two B's. \n\nPerhaps it's impossible, so the condition of no three in a row is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is that the entire segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters must be either RB or BR, except possibly for the first and last pair. \n\nWait, in the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the last two are BB which is invalid. So that would make the condition not hold, but the example is valid. So that's not it. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the code provided. The code splits the string into segments separated by W's. For each segment, it checks some condition. The initial code has a loop over each segment (a in the array), and the res is \"YES\" unless some condition is violated. \n\nThe code's current state is:\n\nfor(String sp:a){\n  /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the task is to fill in the loop to check each segment. \n\nPerhaps the condition is that each segment must be empty (but they are non-W, so that's not possible). Or that each segment has even length? But the sixth example's segment is length 3. \n\nAlternatively, the segments must alternate between R and B. So for example, the segment must be like RBRB or BRBR, etc. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", this is not the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: Each segment must be such that it can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps. Each stamp contributes a pair of R and B. The final colors must be such that every position is covered by at least one stamp, and the colors are consistent with the last stamp covering them. \n\nThe key observation might be that in any segment, the colors must alternate between R and B, except possibly for the first and last characters. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the first character is R, then B, then B. The last two are B's. So the last two are not alternating. \n\nBut the example is valid. So that can't be the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment cannot have two consecutive same colors. \n\nWait, but the sixth example's segment has two B's in a row. \n\nSo that's not it. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think of the problem differently. \n\nEach stamp affects two adjacent cells, setting them to either RB or BR. \n\nThe final colors are the result of all the stamps applied. \n\nThe key is that every non-W cell must be part of at least one stamp. \n\nMoreover, the colors must be such that for every pair of adjacent cells in the segment, there exists a stamp that covers them in some orientation. \n\nWait, but overlapping stamps can allow this. \n\nAlternatively, the entire segment must be such that it can be represented as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be represented as the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, the pairs are (R,B) and (B,B) is not allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence must be such that every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the last two are BB which is invalid. So that would mean the example is invalid, but the note says it's valid. \n\nSo that can't be. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment cannot have three consecutive same colors. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", there are two B's \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like \"BBB\" would be invalid. \n\nA segment like \"RRB\" has two R's \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like \"RRR\" would be invalid. \n\nSo the condition is that no three consecutive same colors. \n\nLet me see if this holds for the examples:\n\nThe sixth example's segment is okay. \n\nThe fifth example's segment \"BRBB\" has two B's followed by another B \u2192 three B's? No, it's BRBB \u2192 the last three are RBB \u2192 no three in a row. \n\nWait, the fifth example's segment is \"BRBB\" (length 4). The last three are R, B, B \u2192 two B's. \n\nSo that's okay. \n\nAnother example: \"RBRB\" is okay. \n\nA segment like \"RBRBR\" is okay. \n\nA segment like \"RRBB\" has two R's and two B's \u2192 no three in a row \u2192 allowed. \n\nBut earlier attempts to form \"RRBB\" were unsuccessful. \n\nHmm, perhaps the condition is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the condition is that the segment must have an even number of characters. \n\nWait the sixth example's segment is length 3 (odd), which is allowed. So that's not it. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of parity. \n\nEach stamp changes two cells. \n\nThe initial state is all W. \n\nEach stamp changes two cells to R and B. \n\nThe final colors must be such that the number of R's and B's in the entire string must be equal? Or differ by at most one? \n\nWait, each stamp adds one R and one B. So the total number of R's and B's must be equal. \n\nWait, because each stamp contributes exactly one R and one B. \n\nSo the total number of R's and B's in the entire string must be equal. \n\nAh! This is a crucial point. \n\nEach stamp adds exactly one R and one B. \n\nSo the total number of R's and B's in the entire string must be equal. \n\nBecause every stamp contributes one R and one B. \n\nSo the total count of R's and B's must be the same. \n\nSo for the entire string, the number of R's plus the number of B's must be even, and the count of R's must equal the count of B's. \n\nWait, no. Because each stamp adds one R and one B. So the total number of R's and B's must be equal. \n\nSo for the entire string, the count of R's must equal the count of B's. \n\nAh! This is a key insight. \n\nSo for the entire string, the number of R's must equal the number of B's. \n\nOtherwise, it's impossible. \n\nSo this is a necessary condition. \n\nLet me check the examples:\n\nThe first example's final string is BRBBW. \n\nThe R count is 1, B count is 3 \u2192 1 vs 3 \u2192 not equal. \n\nWait, but the note says it's possible. \n\nWait, this contradicts the hypothesis. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nWait the first example's final string is BRBBW. \n\nThe R count is 1, B count is 3 \u2192 total R+B is 4, which is even. But the counts are not equal. \n\nSo according to this hypothesis, it would be impossible, but the note says it's possible. \n\nSo this hypothesis is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong with the reasoning? \n\nAh! Because each stamp can be applied multiple times. \n\nEach stamp adds one R and one B, but when you apply a stamp over the same cells again, it can change their colors. \n\nFor example, applying a stamp twice on the same pair: \n\nFirst application: R and B. \n\nSecond application: if you use the same orientation (RB), then the first cell becomes R again, and the second B again. So net change is zero. \n\nAlternatively, if you use the opposite orientation (BR), then the first becomes B and the second R. So the net change is that the first cell is now B instead of R, and the second is R instead of B. \n\nSo the total R and B counts can change. \n\nAh! So the total number of R's and B's can vary. \n\nSo the initial hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so that approach won't work. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that any non-W segment must be such that it can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps. \n\nThe key observation is that any non-W segment must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nThe way to check this is that the segment must not have two consecutive same colors except possibly at the ends. \n\nWait, but the sixth example's segment has two B's in the middle. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR, except possibly for the first and last pair. \n\nWait, but the sixth example's segment has a BB pair. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that it can be partitioned into overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be partitioned into the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, the pairs are (R,B) and (B,B) is not allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the entire segment must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be formed by the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the segment must be such that every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the last two are BB \u2192 which is invalid. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nSo this can't be the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the entire segment must be such that it can be formed by a series of stamps, and thus the sequence must be such that every character except possibly the first and last can be part of a pair with its predecessor and successor. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must be such that it can be represented as a series of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be formed by the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the first pair is R-B, the second pair is B-B \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nSo this is not possible. \n\nBut the example says it is possible. \n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a pattern in the code. The code splits the string into segments separated by W's. For each segment, it checks some condition. \n\nThe initial code has a loop over each segment (sp in a). \n\nThe result is \"YES\" unless some condition is violated. \n\nPerhaps the condition is that the segment has length 0 (but they are non-W, so no). \n\nOr that the segment has length 1 \u2192 which is invalid. \n\nSo for each segment, if its length is 1 \u2192 then it's impossible. \n\nThat's one condition. \n\nThe second condition is that the segment has no two consecutive same colors. \n\nWait, but the sixth example's segment has two B's. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the segment must have even length. \n\nThe sixth example's segment is length 3 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 so that would be invalid. But the example says it's valid. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait the sixth example's segment is \"RBB\" (length 3). \n\nThe note says it is possible. \n\nSo the code must allow segments of odd length. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: the segment must be such that the first and last characters are different. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the first is R and last is B \u2192 different. \n\nThe segment \"RBR\" has first R and last R \u2192 same \u2192 would that be invalid? \n\nLet me see if \"RBR\" can be formed. \n\nYes: \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThe sequence is R B R \u2192 which is RBR. \n\nSo first and last are same \u2192 allowed. \n\nSo that condition is not necessary. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment cannot have two consecutive same colors. \n\nBut the sixth example's segment has two B's \u2192 which would violate this. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment cannot have three consecutive same colors. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment, there are two B's \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like \"BBB\" would be invalid. \n\nA segment like \"RRB\" has two R's \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like \"RRR\" would be invalid. \n\nThis seems plausible. \n\nSo the algorithm would be: \n\nFor each non-W segment: \n\n- Check that there are no three consecutive same colors. \n\n- Also, the segment length must be at least 1. \n\n- Additionally, if the segment length is 1, it's invalid (since you can't stamp a single cell). \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\nFor each segment: \n\nif length == 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nelse: \n\ncheck that there are no three consecutive same colors. \n\nWait, but what about the sixth example's segment \"RBB\" (length 3). \n\nThe three characters are R, B, B \u2192 the last two are B's. So there are two B's in a row, but not three. So it's okay. \n\nAnother example: \"RBRB\" \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like \"RBBR\" \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like \"RBBB\" \u2192 has three B's \u2192 invalid. \n\nA segment like \"RRB\" \u2192 two R's \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like \"RRBB\" \u2192 two R's and two B's \u2192 no three in a row \u2192 okay. \n\nBut earlier attempts to form \"RRBB\" were unsuccessful. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's possible. \n\nLet me try to form \"RRBB\" (length 4). \n\nStart with four W's. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nNow the sequence is R B B R. \n\nNot what we want. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThe sequence is B R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, the second stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nSo after first two stamps: R (1), R (2), B (3), W (4). \n\nThen stamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThe sequence is R R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThe sequence is R B R B. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, I'm not able to get \"RRBB\". \n\nPerhaps it's not possible, so the condition of no three in a row is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must have even length. \n\nWait the sixth example's segment is length 3 \u2192 which is odd \u2192 but it's allowed. \n\nSo that's not it. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that the number of R's and B's are equal. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\" \u2192 1 R and 2 B's \u2192 not equal. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nSo that's not it. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be formed by the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the pairs must be overlapping such that each pair is either RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be formed by the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the pairs must be overlapping such that each pair is RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the first pair is positions 1-2 (R,B), and the second pair is positions 2-3 (B,B) \u2192 which is invalid. \n\nSo this is not possible. \n\nBut the example says it is possible. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the entire segment must be such that it can be formed by a series of stamps, and thus the sequence must be such that every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR, except possibly for the first and last pair. \n\nWait, but the sixth example's segment has a BB pair. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR, or one of them is part of a previous or next pair. \n\nThis is too vague. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the entire segment must be such that it can be formed by a series of overlapping stamps, and thus the sequence must alternate between R and B, except possibly for the first and last characters. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be formed by the first pair (R,B) and the second pair (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence must alternate between R and B. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the last two are B's \u2192 which breaks the alternation. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must not have two consecutive same colors. \n\nBut the example has two B's. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: \n\nEach stamp can be applied anywhere, and can be in either orientation. \n\nThe final colors are determined by the last stamp applied to each position. \n\nThus, for the entire segment, the colors must be such that for every position, it is part of at least one stamp's pair, and the pairs can be arranged such that their overlapping is consistent. \n\nThe key observation is that the sequence must be such that every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR, or one of them is part of a previous or next pair. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sequence must be such that it can be covered by a set of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be covered by the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the pairs must be overlapping such that each pair is either RB or BR. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be covered by the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. \n\nIn the sixth example's segment \"RBB\", the last two are BB \u2192 which is invalid. \n\nBut the example is valid. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B. \n\nFor example, the segment \"RBB\" can be formed by the pairs (R,B) and (B,B) \u2192 but the second pair is invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that it can be written as a sequence of overlapping pairs of R and B, but the pairs can overlap in such a way that the overlapping parts are consistent. \n\nFor example, the first pair is (R,B) at positions 1-2, and the second pair is (R,B) at positions 2-3. \n\nThe first pair sets positions 1 to R and 2 to B. \n\nThe second pair sets position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nThe final sequence is R (position 1), R (position 2), B (position 3). \n\nSo the segment is \"RRB\". \n\nThis is allowed. \n\nSo the two pairs overlap at position 2. \n\nThe first pair's second element is B, but the second pair's first element is R. \n\nThis is allowed because the second pair overwrites the previous value. \n\nThus, the overlapping pairs can have different values. \n\nThus, the sequence can have two R's in a row. \n\nThus, the condition is that the entire segment can be formed by overlapping pairs of R and B, but the overlapping parts can be anything as long as the final colors are correct. \n\nThis is too vague. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the only invalid cases are: \n\n1. The segment has length 1. \n\n2. The segment contains three consecutive same colors. \n\nThus, the conditions are: \n\nFor each segment: \n\n- If length is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\n- Else, check that there are no three consecutive same colors. \n\nThis would explain the examples: \n\nThe sixth example's segment \"RBB\" has two B's \u2192 okay. \n\nA segment like \"BBB\" is invalid. \n\nA segment like \"RRB\" is okay. \n\nA segment like \"RRR\" is invalid. \n\nA segment like \"RRBB\" has two R's and two B's \u2192 no three in a row \u2192 okay. \n\nBut earlier attempts to form \"RRBB\" were unsuccessful. \n\nPerhaps it is possible. \n\nLet me try again for \"RRBB\" (length 4). \n\nLet me try the following steps: \n\nStart with four W's. \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, the second stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nSo after first two stamps: R (1), R (2), B (3), W (4). \n\nThen stamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThe sequence is R R B R. \n\nNot what we want. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nThe sequence is B R B R. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as RB \u2192 B B. \n\nWait, the third stamp on 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B. \n\nSo after first three stamps: R (1), R (2), B (3), R (4). \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nStamp positions 1-2 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nStamp positions 2-3 as BR \u2192 B R. \n\nStamp positions 3-4 as RB \u2192 R B. \n\nThe sequence is R B R B. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, I'm not able to get \"RRBB\". \n\nPerhaps it's not possible, so the condition of no three in a row is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that every pair of consecutive characters is either RB or BR. \n\nIn this case, the sixth example's segment \"RBB\" would be invalid, but the example says it's valid. \n\nSo this is not the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct condition is that the segment must be such that it can be formed by a series of stamps, and thus the sequence must be such that every two consecutive characters are either RB or BR, or one of them is part of a previous or next pair. \n\nThis is too vague. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the only invalid cases are segments of length 1 or segments with three consecutive same colors. \n\nThus, the code should check for these two conditions. \n\nSo the code for each segment sp: \n\nif (sp.length() == 1) \u2192 invalid. \n\nelse: \n\ncheck that there are no three consecutive same characters. \n\nThus, the code would be: \n\nfor each segment sp: \n\nif (sp.length() == 1) \u2192 set res to \"NO\" and break. \n\nelse: \n\nloop through the characters of sp, check if any three consecutive are the same. \n\nif found \u2192 set res to \"NO\" and break. \n\nThus, this would handle the examples. \n\nThe sixth example's segment \"RBB\" has two B's \u2192 no three in a row \u2192 okay. \n\nThe segment \"BBB\" would be invalid. \n\nThe segment \"RRB\" is okay. \n\nThe segment \"RRBB\" is okay. \n\nThe segment \"RBR\" is okay. \n\nThe segment \"R\" is invalid. \n\nThe segment \"WWB\" has a segment \"B\" \u2192 length 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\nThe first example's segment \"BRBB\" has length 4 \u2192 no three in a row \u2192 okay. \n\nThe fifth example's segment \"BRBB\" has length 4 \u2192 okay. \n\nThe sixth example's segment \"RBB\" is okay. \n\nThe seventh test case's example is all W's \u2192 no segments \u2192 so it's okay. \n\nThus, this seems to be the correct condition. \n\nSo the code should: \n\nFor each segment: \n\n- If the length is 1 \u2192 invalid. \n\n- Else, check that there are no three consecutive same characters. \n\nThus, the missing code in the loop over the segments would be: \n\nfor(String sp:a){\n    if(sp.length() == 1){\n        res = \"NO\";\n        break;\n    }\n    for(int i=0; i<sp.length()-2; i++){\n        if(sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+1) && sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+2)){\n            res = \"NO\";\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if(res.equals(\"NO\")) break;\n}\n\nWait, but the loop over the characters needs to check for three in a row. \n\nSo the code inside the for loop over each segment would be: \n\nif the segment length is 1 \u2192 set res to NO and break. \n\nelse, loop from i=0 to i < sp.length() - 2: \n\nif sp[i] == sp[i+1] and sp[i] == sp[i+2], then set res to NO and break. \n\nThen, after checking all i, if any of them triggered a break, then the result is NO. \n\nThus, the code would look like this. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nfor(String sp : a) {\n    if (sp.length() == 1) {\n        res = \"NO\";\n        break;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < sp.length() - 2; i++) {\n        if (sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+1) && sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+2)) {\n            res = \"NO\";\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (res.equals(\"NO\")) break;\n}\n\nThis should handle the conditions. \n\nTesting this with the sixth example's segment \"RBB\" (length 3): \n\nThe loop runs for i from 0 to 0 (since 3-2=1 \u2192 i < 1 \u2192 i=0). \n\nCheck i=0: sp[0] = 'R', sp[1]='B', sp[2]='B'. \n\nR != B \u2192 so no problem. \n\nThus, no three in a row \u2192 okay. \n\nFor a segment like \"BBB\" (length 3): \n\ni=0: all three are B \u2192 trigger NO. \n\nFor a segment like \"RRB\" (length 3): \n\ni=0: R, R, B \u2192 first two are R, third is B \u2192 first two are same, but third is different \u2192 no three in a row. \n\nThus, okay. \n\nFor a segment like \"RRBB\" (length 4): \n\nCheck i=0: R, R, B \u2192 no three in a row. \n\ni=1: R, B, B \u2192 no three in a row. \n\nThus, okay. \n\nThus, this should work. \n\nSo the missing code is as above. \n\nThe code also needs to handle the case where the segment is length 0? But since the segments are split by W's, the split would include empty strings if there are multiple W's in a row. \n\nWait, the split on \"W\" would split the string into parts between W's. For example, \"WW\" would split into [\"\", \"\"]. \n\nBut in the problem statement, the input string consists of W, R, B. \n\nThe code splits the string into a = s.split(\"W\"); \n\nSo for example, if the string is \"W\", then the split would be [\"\", \"\"]. \n\nBut the problem states that the input string consists of the characters W, R, B. \n\nThe code's loop over the segments would process each segment. \n\nFor empty segments (length 0), the code would not trigger the first condition (length 1). \n\nBut empty segments are allowed, since they are between W's. \n\nFor example, if the input is \"W\", then the segments are \"\", \"\" \u2192 but the empty segments are allowed. \n\nThe empty segments are okay because they represent regions of W's. \n\nThus, the code should ignore empty segments. \n\nWait, the code splits the string into a = s.split(\"W\"); \n\nFor example, the string \"W\" would split into [\"\", \"\"]. \n\nThe loop over the segments would process each of these. \n\nThe first segment is \"\", which has length 0 \u2192 the first condition (length ==1) is false. \n\nThen the loop for checking three in a row would not run (since length is 0). \n\nThus, the empty segments are okay. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nThus, the missing code is as above. \n\nSo the final code would be: \n\nfor(String sp:a){\n    if(sp.length() == 1){\n        res = \"NO\";\n        break;\n    }\n    for(int i=0; i<sp.length()-2; i++){\n        if(sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+1) && sp.charAt(i) == sp.charAt(i+2)){\n            res = \"NO\";\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if(res.equals(\"NO\")) break;\n}\n\nThus, this is the missing code."
