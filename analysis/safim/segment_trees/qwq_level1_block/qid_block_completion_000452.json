Wait, perhaps the returned value is the required contribution that must be added to the current node's path. Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the variable name 'max' is misleading. Let me think of the returned value as the \"required contribution\" that must be added to the current node's path. Wait, let me think of the first sample again. The child (node 1, which is the second node in 1-based) has l=2, r=2. The DFS returns r[cur] (2) because the max (sum of children's returns) is 0 (since it has no children). Since 0 < l (2), so ans increases by 1, and returns r (2). The parent (root) then has max = 2 (sum of children's returns). Since the root's l is 1, which is less than 2, so it returns min(2, r[root]). So the ans is 1. This works. Another example: the second sample. Let's say node 2 (third node in 1-based, which is index 2 in 0-based) has l=7, r=7. Its children are none. So the max is 0. Since 0 <7, ans increases by 1, returns 7.",

Alternatively, when we add an operation here, the contribution to this node is increased by c_k (the last element of the path), and the contribution to its parent is increased by c_{k-1}, etc. But the code's approach is to increment ans by 1, and return r[cur].

The code has:\n\nfor(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n} The input for the parents is given as p_2, p_3, ..., p_n.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code for the given problem. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem is about a rooted tree where each node has a number a_v that must be between l_v and r_v. The operations allowed are choosing a vertex v, then selecting a non-decreasing array c of non-negative integers along the path from root (1) to v. Each element c_i in this array adds to the corresponding node on the path. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to set all a_v within their [l_v, r_v] ranges.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model the operations in a way that allows us to compute the minimal steps. The code provided has a DFS approach, but the current DFS function might not be correct. Let me look at the code's current DFS function:\n\nprivate static long DFS(int cur) {\n    long max = 0;\n    for(int c : child[cur]) max += DFS(c);\n    if(max < l[cur]) {\n        ++ans;\n        return r[cur];\n    } else return Math.min(max, r[cur]);\n}\n\nWait, this seems like it's trying to track some maximum or required value. Let me think. The idea might be that each node's required contribution is determined by its children. But perhaps the approach here is to model the required increments in a way that each operation contributes to the path, and we need to find the minimal steps by considering the differences between the required values and the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this problem can be modeled using a greedy approach where each node's required value is determined by the path from the root, and the operations can be thought of as adding non-decreasing sequences along paths. The minimal number of operations would correspond to the number of times we have to \"jump\" over certain constraints.\n\nWait, another thought: since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the effect on the nodes along the path is additive. To reach the required a_v for each node, perhaps we can model the required increments as a series of steps where each step contributes a certain amount along a path. The minimal number of operations would be determined by the number of times the required increments exceed the previous contributions in a way that requires a new operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into a problem on the tree where each node's required value must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The operations can be thought of as adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. The minimal steps would be determined by the \"gaps\" between the required values and the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the tree in a bottom-up manner. Let me think of each node's required value. Let's consider the required a_v must be between l_v and r_v. Since each operation along a path adds a non-decreasing sequence, the total contribution to a node from all operations must be within its [l_v, r_v].\n\nHmm, maybe the key is to model the required increments as a series of layers. Let me think of the problem in terms of the required minimum and maximum contributions. Let me think of each node's required a_v as needing to be at least l_v. Since each operation along a path can contribute to the nodes along that path, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the differences between the required minimums and the maximum possible contributions from previous steps.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: For each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The operations can be thought of as adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. To minimize the number of operations, we can model the required increments as the difference between the current node's required minimum and the sum of previous contributions. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where each node's required value is determined by the path from the root. Let me think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v. The maximum possible contribution from previous operations along the path must be considered. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample, choosing v=2 and c=[1,2] gives a1=1 and a2=2. The l and r for each node must be satisfied. The idea is that each operation's c array must be non-decreasing. So, the total contribution to each node along the path is the sum of all c_i's from operations that include that node in their path.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the required increments for each node. Let me think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v and at most r_v. The operations can be thought of as adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. The minimal number of operations is the number of times we have to \"step up\" the required values beyond the current maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the code's current DFS function. The code's DFS function returns some value, and the ans is incremented when the current max is less than l[cur]. Let me see:\n\nThe current code's DFS function for a node cur:\n\n- It first processes all children, accumulating their returned max values (summing them? Wait, no, the code says max += DFS(c). Wait, but the variable is called max, but it's being summed. That might be a problem. Let me see:\n\nWait, the code's DFS function returns a long, and for each child, it adds the returned value to max. But the variable is named max, which is confusing. Maybe the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the required \"deficit\" or \"surplus\" for each node. Let me think of the problem in terms of the required a_v. Since each operation's c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to the nodes along the path must be such that each step's c_i is at least the previous. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order (children first). For each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The minimal required contribution from the current node's operation is the difference between l_v and the sum of contributions from previous operations along its path. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from similar problems: The minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the difference between the required a_v and the maximum possible from previous steps, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think of the problem in terms of the path from the root to each node. Each operation on a node v affects all nodes along the path from root to v. The non-decreasing condition on c implies that the contribution to each node along the path must be non-decreasing as we go from root to v. \n\nSuppose we model the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v. To achieve this, the sum of all c_i's along the path up to v must be at least l_v. But since each c array is non-decreasing, the minimal way to achieve this is to set the c's in such a way that each step's contribution is as large as possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where each node's required value must be at least l_v, and the minimal number of operations is determined by the \"steps\" needed along the path from the root. \n\nLet me think of the nodes in the order from the root down. For each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The maximum possible contribution from previous operations along the path to v is the sum of the contributions from all previous operations. If this sum is less than l_v, then we need to add an operation that contributes enough to make up the difference. However, since the c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to the current node must be at least the contribution to its parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the required increments as a sequence along the path. Let me think of the required a_v for each node. Let's process the nodes in a bottom-up manner. For each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The minimal number of operations can be determined by the differences between the required a_v and the maximum possible from previous steps. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the sample solution:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes (except root) of the difference between the required a_v and the maximum possible from the path. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's constraints and the sample code:\n\nThe code's current DFS function is trying to compute some value. Let me see the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=2, p_2=1. The l and r for node 1 and 2 are such that in the first case, the required a1 is 1 and a2 is 2. The code's DFS function for node 0 (assuming 0-based index) would process its children. Let's see:\n\nSuppose node 0 (root) has child 1 (node 2 in 1-based). The DFS for node 1 (child) would first process its children (none), so max starts at 0. Then, if the l for node 1 (which is node 2 in 1-based) is 2, and the current max (0) is less than l (2), then ans increases by 1, and returns r (which is 2). Then, the parent (node 0) would have max = 2. Since the l for node 0 (root) is 1, which is less than max (2), so it returns min(2, r[0]). So the ans is 1, which matches the sample. So the code works for the first sample.\n\nThe second sample's code would need to return 2. Let me see:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=3, p_2=1, p_3=2. The l and r for nodes 1,2,3 are such that after two operations, the a's are 5,3,7. Let's see how the code would process this.\n\nSuppose the nodes are 0-based (so node 0 is root, node 1 is 2, node 2 is 3). The children of 0 are 1. The children of 1 is 2.\n\nProcessing node 2 (the leaf):\n\nDFS(2) has no children. So max starts at 0. Suppose l[2] is 7 (since in the sample, after the second operation, a3 is 7). Wait, but in the sample explanation, the second operation's c is [2,7], but the path to 3 is 1->2->3. Wait, the path from root (1) to 3 is 1,2,3. So the c array has length 3. The first operation's c for v=2 (path 1-2) is [3,3], so a1 gets 3, a2 gets 3. The second operation for v=3 (path 1-2-3) uses c [2,7,7]? Wait, the sample says c is [2,7], but that might be a mistake. Wait the sample says \"choose v=3, c = [2,7]\". Wait, the path from root to 3 is three nodes (1,2,3), so the c array should be of length 3. So perhaps the sample explanation has a typo, but assuming the code works for the given sample.\n\nIn any case, let's see the code's approach. For node 2 (the third node in 0-based?), let's say l[2] is 7. Then, the max is 0 (since no children). Since 0 <7, ans increases by 1, returns r[2] (say 7). Then, moving up to node 1 (the second node in 1-based, which is node 1 in 0-based?), its children are node 2. The max would be 7 (from the child). Suppose l[1] is 3. Since 7 >=3, so returns min(7, r[1]). Suppose r[1] is 3, then returns 3. Then, the parent (node 0) has max 3. If l[0] is 5, then 3 <5, so ans increases by 1, and returns r[0] (say 5). So total ans is 2, which matches the sample. So the code works for the second sample.\n\nHmm, so the code's approach seems to work for the samples. But why does this approach work?\n\nThe DFS function for a node cur:\n\n- It first processes all children, accumulating their returned values. Wait, the code says \"max += DFS(c)\". Wait, but the variable is called max, but it's adding the returned values. That might be a problem. Wait, let me re-examine the code:\n\nIn the current code's DFS function:\n\nlong max =0;\n\nfor each child c in child[cur], it does max += DFS(c);\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the variable is named max, but it's being summed. That can't be right. Because the returned value from the children is supposed to be the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up, but adding them would not make sense. \n\nWait, this must be a mistake. Let me think again. The code's current approach is probably incorrect. Because the way the DFS function is written, the max variable is the sum of the returned values from children. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is that the returned value is the maximum required contribution that the current node can \"pass up\" to its parent. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code's DFS function returns a value. Let me see:\n\nSuppose for a node, after processing children, the max variable is the sum of the returned values from children. Then, if that sum is less than l[cur], then we need to add an operation, and return r[cur]. Otherwise, return the minimum between the sum and r[cur].\n\nWait, but how does this model the required contributions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the returned value represents the \"excess\" that can be contributed to the parent. Let me think of it this way:\n\nEach node's required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The operations can contribute to the nodes along the path. The idea is that when processing a node, the sum of the contributions from the children's operations (the returned values) must be at least l_v. If not, we need to add an operation here, which contributes (l_v - sum) to this node and all ancestors. But since the c array must be non-decreasing, this requires that the contribution added here is at least the previous contributions. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the maximum possible contribution that can be \"pushed up\" to the parent. Let me think recursively:\n\nFor a leaf node (no children), the required a_v must be at least l_v. The current sum from previous operations (from children, which are none) is 0. So if 0 < l_v, then we need to add an operation here. The operation's c array for this node's path (which is just the root to itself) must have c equal to some value. The minimal way is to set c such that the total contribution is exactly l_v. But since the operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to this node is the last element of c. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the maximum possible contribution that can be added to the parent. Let me think of the returned value as the minimal required contribution that must be added by the parent. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible correct approach:\n\nThe problem can be viewed as follows: Each operation on a node v adds a non-decreasing sequence along the path from root to v. The total contribution to each node on the path is the sum of all c_i's from all operations that include that node in their path. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times we have to \"step up\" the required contributions along the path. \n\nLet me think of the nodes in post-order. For each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The contributions from the children's paths must be considered. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order. For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The contributions from the children's paths (i.e., the paths from root to their children) must be considered. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the required contribution for each node as the maximum between the required l_v and the contributions from the path. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints and the sample code's approach (even though the code may have a mistake):\n\nThe code's DFS function is trying to track the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to the parent. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the returned value from a node is the maximum possible contribution that can be \"pushed up\" to the parent. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's logic again. \n\nThe code's DFS function for node cur:\n\n- It first processes all children, and for each child c, it calls DFS(c) and adds the returned value to max. \n\nWait, that's a problem. Because adding the returned values from children would not make sense. For example, in the first sample, the child of root (node 1) returns r[cur] (which is 2). The root's max is 2. Then, since the root's l is 1, which is less than 2, it returns min(2, r[root]). So the ans is 1, which is correct. \n\nBut why is the max being summed? Because the children's contributions are along their own paths, but the parent's path includes those contributions. Wait, perhaps the returned value is the required contribution that must be added to the current node's path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but the variable name 'max' is misleading. Let me think of the returned value as the \"required contribution\" that must be added to the current node's path. \n\nWait, let me think of the first sample again. The child (node 1, which is the second node in 1-based) has l=2, r=2. The DFS returns r[cur] (2) because the max (sum of children's returns) is 0 (since it has no children). Since 0 < l (2), so ans increases by 1, and returns r (2). \n\nThe parent (root) then has max = 2 (sum of children's returns). Since the root's l is 1, which is less than 2, so it returns min(2, r[root]). So the ans is 1. \n\nThis works. \n\nAnother example: the second sample. Let's say node 2 (third node in 1-based, which is index 2 in 0-based) has l=7, r=7. Its children are none. So the max is 0. Since 0 <7, ans increases by 1, returns 7. \n\nThen, its parent (node 1, which is the second node in 1-based, index 1 in 0-based) has children's returned value (7). So max is 7. Suppose the l for node 1 is 3. Since 7 >=3, returns min(7, r[1]). If r[1] is 3, then returns 3. \n\nThen, the root (node 0) has max =3 (from the child). Suppose the root's l is 5. Since 3 <5, ans increases by 1 (total ans is 2), and returns min(5, r[0]). \n\nSo the code works for the sample. \n\nThe key here is that the returned value from a node is the maximum possible contribution that can be \"pushed up\" to the parent. The sum of the children's returned values is added to the current node's max. Wait, but why sum? \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the required contribution that must be added to the current node's path. \n\nWait, the code's logic is that for each node, the sum of the children's returned values is the total contribution that has been allocated to the current node from the children's operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value represents the \"excess\" that can be contributed to the parent. \n\nAlternatively, the returned value is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up. \n\nWait, the code's approach is that for each node, the sum of the children's returned values is the total contribution that has been allocated to this node from the children's operations. \n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think of the first sample again. The child (node 1) returns 2. The root's max is 2. So the root's a_v is the sum of the contributions from its own operations plus the contributions from the children's operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the amount that the current node's path can contribute to its parent. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is that the returned value is the minimal required contribution that must be added to the current node's path. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is correct, but the variable name 'max' is a mistake. The code's DFS function is supposed to return the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up. \n\nWait, the code's DFS function for a node cur:\n\nThe max variable is initialized to 0, then for each child, it adds the returned value of the child. \n\nWait, that's the problem. Because adding the children's returned values would mean that the contribution from the children's paths is being summed, but that's not how the contributions work. \n\nWait, each child's returned value is the contribution that the child's path can pass up. But the current node's contribution is the sum of the children's contributions plus any new operations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the variable 'max' is actually the sum of the contributions from the children. \n\nWait, let me think of the first sample again. The child (node 1) returns 2. The root's max is 2. The root's l is 1. Since 2 >=1, it returns min(2, r[root]). So the root's contribution is 2, which is passed up (but since it's the root, there's no parent). \n\nThe total ans is 1, which is correct. \n\nIn the second sample, the leaf node (node 2) returns 7. Its parent (node 1) has max =7. Since node 1's l is 3, which is less than 7, so it returns min(7, r[1]). If r[1] is 3, then it returns 3. \n\nThe root's max is 3. Since its l is 5, which is greater than 3, so ans increases by 1, and returns r[0] (say 5). \n\nThus, the code works. \n\nBut why is the max variable the sum of the children's returned values? Because each child's returned value is the contribution that the child's path can contribute to the current node. \n\nWait, the returned value from a child is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to the current node. So the current node's max is the sum of all children's contributions. \n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me think of the path. \n\nSuppose the current node is v. The children are all its direct children. Each child's returned value is the contribution that the child's path can contribute to v. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the contribution that the current node's path can contribute to its parent. \n\nWait, the returned value from a node is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to its parent. \n\nWait, the code's logic is that for each node, the sum of the children's returned values is the total contribution that has been allocated to this node from the children's operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the amount that the current node's path can contribute to its parent. \n\nWait, let me think of the first sample again. The child (node 1) returns 2. The root's max is 2. So the root can contribute 2 to its parent (but it has none). \n\nThe root's a_v is the sum of its own operations plus the contributions from its children. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the amount that the current node's path can contribute to its parent. \n\nSo, when processing a node, the sum of the children's returned values is the total contribution that the children's paths have already provided to this node. \n\nThen, the current node's required a_v must be at least l_v. The current total contribution (sum from children) is max. \n\nIf max < l_v, then we need to add an operation here. The operation's c array must be such that the contribution to this node is (l_v - max) plus whatever is needed for the path. \n\nBut since the c array must be non-decreasing, the minimal way is to add an operation where the c array for this path has the last element (this node) set to (l_v - max), and the previous elements are at least that. \n\nWait, but how does this ensure that the total contribution is exactly l_v? \n\nAlternatively, when we add an operation here, the contribution to this node is increased by c_k (the last element of the path), and the contribution to its parent is increased by c_{k-1}, etc. \n\nBut the code's approach is to increment ans by 1, and return r[cur]. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up to the parent. \n\nWhen we add an operation here (because max < l_v), then the new contribution to this node is increased by (l_v - max) plus the r[cur] - (l_v - max)? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the returned value after adding an operation is r[cur], which is the maximum possible contribution that can be passed up. \n\nWait, the idea is that when we add an operation here, we can set the c array such that the contribution to this node is exactly r[cur], which is the maximum allowed. \n\nWait, but why r[cur]? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is to greedily choose the maximum possible contribution for each node when needed. \n\nLet me think of the algorithm as follows:\n\nWe process the nodes in post-order (children first). \n\nFor each node, the current total contribution from previous operations (from children) is the sum of the returned values from children. \n\nIf this total is less than l_v, then we need to add an operation here. The operation's contribution to this node is (l_v - current_total). But since the c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to this node must be at least the contribution to its parent. \n\nWait, but how does this fit into the code's approach? \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to set the contribution to this node to exactly r_v when needed, which allows the maximum possible contribution to be passed up to the parent. \n\nWait, when we add an operation here, the returned value is r_v. This means that the parent can use this r_v as part of its max. \n\nThis way, the parent can have a higher contribution, possibly meeting its l requirement without needing its own operation. \n\nThis greedy approach of choosing the maximum possible contribution (r_v) when needed would minimize the number of operations. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each node in post-order:\n\n- The current contribution from children is the sum of their returned values. \n\nWait, no, the code is adding the returned values. But why sum? \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value is the contribution that this node's path can contribute to its parent. \n\nSo, for example, if a node has multiple children, each child's returned value is the contribution that their path can give to this node. \n\nThe total contribution to this node from children is the sum of their returned values. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because each child's path is a different path. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but it works for the samples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is correct, and the variable 'max' is actually the sum of the contributions from the children's paths to the current node. \n\nWait, the children are the direct children of the current node. Each child's path includes the current node as an ancestor. So the contribution from the child's operations to the current node is the sum of the returned values from the children. \n\nWait, perhaps the returned value from a child is the contribution that the child's path adds to the current node. \n\nFor example, when processing a child c of cur, the returned value from c is the contribution that the path to c adds to cur. \n\nThus, the total contribution to cur from all children is the sum of the returned values from each child. \n\nThen, the current node's total contribution is this sum. \n\nIf this sum is less than l_v, then we need to add an operation here. The operation's contribution to cur is (l_v - sum). But since the c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to cur must be at least the contribution to its parent. \n\nWait, but how does this ensure that the parent's contribution is sufficient? \n\nAlternatively, when we add an operation at cur, the contribution to cur is increased by some c_k (the last element of the path from root to cur). The contribution to its parent is increased by c_{k-1}, which must be <= c_k. \n\nThe code's approach is to set the returned value to r_v when we add an operation. This way, the parent can use this r_v as part of its contribution. \n\nThe idea is that by choosing the maximum possible contribution (r_v) when needed, we can maximize the contribution passed up to the parent, thus minimizing the need for additional operations in the parent. \n\nThis greedy approach would work because choosing the maximum possible contribution (r_v) when needed ensures that the parent has the highest possible contribution from this node, which might help meet its own l requirement without needing its own operation. \n\nThus, the code's approach is correct. \n\nNow, looking back at the code provided, the missing part is in the for loop where the parents are read. \n\nThe code has:\n\nfor(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nThe input for the parents is given as p_2, p_3, ..., p_n. Each p_i is the parent of vertex i (which is numbered from 1 to n). \n\nIn the code, the vertices are 0-based (since the loop for l and r starts at i=0). So vertex 1 (1-based) is 0 in the code's array. \n\nThus, for each i from 1 to n-1 (since the loop runs from 1 to n-1 in the input), the vertex is (i+1) in 1-based, which is i in 0-based. \n\nWait, the input for p_2, p_3,... p_n corresponds to the parents of vertices 2,3,...n (1-based). \n\nIn code, the vertices are 0-based. So vertex 2 (1-based) is 1 in 0-based. \n\nThus, for each i from 1 to n-1 (the loop runs from i=1 to i <n, since the input has n-1 numbers), the current vertex is (i+1) in 1-based, which is i in 0-based. \n\nThe parent p_i (given in the input) is the parent of vertex (i+1) in 1-based, which is (p_i -1) in 0-based. \n\nThus, for each i from 1 to n-1 (in the loop), the current vertex is i (0-based), and its parent is p[i] (the input value) minus 1 (to convert to 0-based). \n\nSo the code should read the p array, then for each i from 1 to n-1 (0-based), the parent is p[i], and the child is i. \n\nWait, the code's p array is declared as p[] = new int[n]; \n\nWait, the code's p array is initialized as p[] of size n. The second line of each test case has n-1 integers p_2, p_3,...p_n. \n\nSo in code:\n\nfor(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    p[i] = nextInt(); // but since the input is p_2, p_3,...p_n, which are the parents of vertices 2,3,...n (1-based). \n\n    // So for vertex (i+1) in 1-based (which is i in 0-based?), no. Wait, the loop is for i from 1 to n-1 (since the loop runs for i from 1 to n-1 inclusive?), but the array is 0-based. \n\nWait, the code's loop is for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i). So for n=2, i runs from 1 to 1. \n\nThe input for p_2 is given as the first element of the array (since the second line has n-1 elements, which for n=2 is one element, p_2). \n\nThus, for each i in 1..n-1 (0-based indices from 1 to n-1), the current vertex is (i+1) in 1-based (since the first vertex is 1, and the next are 2, etc). \n\nWait, no. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n. The code uses 0-based indices. So vertex 1 is 0, vertex 2 is 1, etc. \n\nThus, for the input p_2 (the parent of vertex 2 in 1-based, which is index 1 in 0-based), the parent is p_2 (given as an integer). \n\nSo the code should read the p array as follows:\n\nfor(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    p[i] = nextInt() -1; // converting to 0-based.\n\n    // then, add the child to the parent's list.\n\n    child[p[i]].add(i);\n\n}\n\nWait, because the parent of vertex (i+1) in 1-based (which is i in 0-based) is p[i], which is stored as p[i] (but converted to 0-based). \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nThe input for the second line is p_2, p_3,...p_n. \n\nEach p_j (for j from 2 to n) is the parent of vertex j. \n\nIn code, the vertices are 0-based. So vertex j (1-based) is (j-1) in 0-based. \n\nThus, for each j from 2 to n (1-based), the corresponding index in the code is (j-1). \n\nThe loop in the code is for i from 1 to n-1 (since the loop is for i from 1 to <n). \n\nThus, for each i in 1..n-1 (0-based indices), the vertex is (i+1) in 1-based? No, the vertex is (i+1) in 1-based? Wait, no. \n\nWait, the first element in the p array (p[1] in code's array) corresponds to the parent of vertex 2 (1-based), which is index 1 in 0-based. \n\nThus, for each i from 1 to n-1 (0-based indices), the current vertex is i (0-based), which is (i+1) in 1-based. \n\nThe parent of this vertex is p_i (the input value) which is in 1-based, so we subtract 1 to get the 0-based index. \n\nThus, the code should read p[i] = nextInt() -1, then add the current vertex (i) to the child list of its parent (p[i]). \n\nSo the missing code in the for loop is:\n\np[i] = nextInt() -1;\n\nchild[p[i]].add(i);\n\nThus, the code should be filled as:\n\nfor(int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {\n\n    p[i] = nextInt() -1;\n\n    child[p[i]].add(i);\n\n}\n\nThis way, the child array is built correctly. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\np[i] = nextInt() -1;\n\nchild[p[i]].add(i);\n\nHence, the correct code for the missing part is those two lines."
