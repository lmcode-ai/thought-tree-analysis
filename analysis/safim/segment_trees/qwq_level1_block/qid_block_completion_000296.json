The comments mention something about l and r being the maximum water levels? Not sure yet.

Hmm, this seems complicated. The problem requires for each i, after removing p_i, check if the new maximum is \u2264 m. The naive approach would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2e5. Therefore, we need an O(n log n) approach. Let me think of the maximum a_j as the maximum over all positions j of the sum over all days (max(0, p_k - |x_k - j|)). The maximum is achieved at some position j where the sum is highest. To compute this efficiently, perhaps we can model the contributions as intervals and track the maximum. Alternatively, the maximum a_j can be found by considering the peaks of each rain. The peak of each rain is at x_i, contributing p_i.

The loop alternates between taking the next event from a or d, whichever comes first. Wait, the code's loop:\n\nprev is initialized to a.poll() (the first event, which is the earliest start or end point).

Wait, perhaps 'water' is the current a_j at the current position. The loop proceeds as follows:\n\nprev is the previous position. Now, the next event is either from a (start/end) or d (center).

Wait, but that would be the integral over the interval, not the a_j at now. Hmm, perhaps the 'water' variable is the a_j at the current position. Wait, let's see:\n\nInitially, prev is the first event (the earliest start point). Then, moving to now, the distance is (now - prev). The rate is the number of active rains during that interval. The a_j increases by rate*(distance) over that interval. Wait, but that would mean that the a_j at now is the previous a_j plus rate*(distance). Wait, but the a_j is the sum of all contributions up to now? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the 'water' variable is the current a_j at the current position. Wait, let's think of an example:\n\nSuppose there is one rain with x=5, p=3. The start is 2, end is 8. The events in a are 2 and 8. The d has 5. The initial prev is 2 (a.poll()), then the next event is 5 (from d). Between 2 and 5, the rate is 1 (since it's a start). So water += 1*(5-2) \u2192 water becomes 3. At position 5, the a_j is 3 (from the rain's contribution at 5: p_i - |5-5| =3). Then, the next event is 8 (end). Between 5 and 8, the rate is still 1 (since the end hasn't been processed yet). Wait, no. When processing the end (8), the rate would decrease by 1. Wait, the code's handling of events from a:\n\nWhen an event is from a (add is true), then it's either a start or end. Wait, the code adds both x_i-p_i and x_i+p_i to a. So, the start is x_i-p_i, and the end is x_i+p_i. When processing a start (x_i-p_i), the rate increases by 1.",

But how?\n\nAlternative idea inspired by the problem's note:\n\nThe maximum a_j can be found by considering all the peaks (x_i) and the intersections between the rain's peaks. The maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions j of the sum of p_i - |x_i - j| for all i where this is positive. To compute this efficiently, we can model the problem as a line sweep where we track the current maximum. Let me think of the events as the start and end of each rain's effect. Each rain contributes a segment from x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i, with a linear increase then decrease. The maximum a_j can be found by considering all the events and tracking the current maximum. The line sweep approach would process events in order of their position. At each event, we can update the current maximum. The events are:\n\n- Start of a rain: when entering the interval, the contribution increases. - End of a rain: when leaving the interval, the contribution decreases. \n\n-",

Wait, the sum for x_i is the sum of all contributions from all rains (including itself). So, the maximum is the maximum of this sum over all x_i. Let me think of the contribution of each rain k to all x_i's. The contribution of rain k to x_i is max(0, p_k - |x_k -x_i|). The total sum for x_i is the sum over all k of this term. The maximum of this sum is what we need. Now, the problem requires for each i, when we remove rain i (set p_i to 0), what is the new maximum? The new maximum would be the maximum over all x_j of the sum excluding the contribution of rain i. The contribution of rain i to x_j is max(0, p_i - |x_i -x_j|). So, the new sum for x_j is the original sum minus this term. The new maximum is the maximum of (original_sum_j - contribution_i_j) over all j. If this new maximum is \u2264m, then the answer is 1 for that i. The challenge is to compute for each i the maximum of (original_sum_j - contribution_i_j) over all j.",

Wait, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the sum of all contributions at each x_i. The contribution of rain k to x_i is max(0, p_k - |x_k -x_i|). The sum for x_i is the sum over all k of this term. This can be rewritten as the sum over all k of p_k - |x_k -x_i| if x_i is within the interval of k, else 0. The maximum of this sum is what we need. To compute this efficiently, perhaps we can model this as a line sweep and track the current maximum. The line sweep would process all events (start and end of each rain's interval) and track the current contribution. The maximum a_j is the maximum value of the current contribution during the sweep. This approach would be O(n log n) time. Let me outline this approach:\n\n1.",

Also, whenever we pass a center x_i, we check if the current_water is the new maximum. Wait, but the maximum could occur anywhere between events. Alternatively, the maximum could be at a center x_i. So, during the sweep, whenever we reach a center x_i, we record the current_water as the contribution at x_i. The maximum of all these recorded values is the global maximum. This way, we can track the maximum a_j by checking the contribution at each center. This approach would work because the maximum a_j must occur at one of the centers. Because the contribution of each rain is maximized at its own center.",

Iterate through the events in order of their position. Also, keep track of the current position. We also need to process the centers in order. To do this, we can have a pointer to the next center to process. For example:\n\n   - Sort all centers in increasing order. - Initialize a pointer j=0 to the first center. - As we process events, whenever the current event's position is >= the current center's position, we record the current_contribution as the contribution at that center. - Move the pointer j to the next center. 6. After processing all events, the maximum contribution among all centers is the global maximum. This way, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the recorded contributions at the centers.

But how to find the maximum and its position efficiently? The initial code's approach might be trying to do this with a line sweep. Perhaps the line sweep tracks the current a_j and whenever it exceeds m, it records the current maximum and position. The variables l and r might be the leftmost and rightmost positions where the maximum occurs. Alternatively, the code's variables l and r are the maximum values encountered during the sweep. The code's loop: Initially, l and r are set to -1e9 and 0. Then, for each event, the water (current a_j) is computed. If water exceeds m, then the code checks some conditions and updates l and r. The conditions are:\n\nif (water > m && (water - (now - lpos) >=0)) \u2192 then set l = water, lpos = now.",

Alternatively, the code might be trying to track the maximum a_j and its position. The variables l and r might be the maximum a_j and its position. But the code's logic is unclear. Perhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be rewritten. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for the correct approach and then see what code is needed. The correct approach is:\n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of the sum of all contributions at each x_i. To compute this maximum, we can compute for each x_i the sum of contributions from all other rains at x_i plus p_i. The maximum of these is the global maximum.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the given Java code for this problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each day whether removing that day's rain will prevent a flood. The flood occurs if any position's accumulated rainfall exceeds m. The key is that when we remove a day's rain (set p_i to 0), we need to check if the maximum a_j across all positions is now \u2264 m.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to have some logic with priority queues and tracking positions. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nLooking at the main method:\n\nThey read n and m, then x and p arrays. Then they initialize two priority queues, a and d. The a queue is being filled with x[i]-p[i] and x[i]+p[i], which are the start and end of the rain's effect. The d queue is filled with x[i], the centers.\n\nThen there's some variables like lpos, rpos, l, r, water, rate, etc. The loop processes events from a and d, tracking the water level. The comments mention something about l and r being the maximum water levels? Not sure yet.\n\nThe final part loops through each i and checks if removing the i-th day's rain would bring the max a_j down to \u2264 m. The condition uses l and r, but I'm not sure how those variables are computed.\n\nWait, the code's logic might be trying to track the maximum accumulated rainfall. The problem is that for each day, when you remove it, you need to subtract the contribution of that day's rain from the maximum. But how to compute that efficiently?\n\nThe current approach in the code might be trying to find the maximum a_j in the original scenario, then for each day, see if removing that day's contribution would reduce the maximum below m+1? Or maybe the l and r variables are storing some critical points where the maximum occurs?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the events (start and end of rain intervals) and track the water level over time. The 'rate' variable might represent the number of overlapping rain effects contributing to the current position. The 'water' variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position?\n\nWait, the code's loop processes events in order. The a queue contains all the start and end points of the rain's effect (since each rain's effect is a diamond shape, the area where p_i - |x_i - j| >0 is between x_i - p_i and x_i + p_i). The d queue contains the centers. The loop alternates between processing the next event from a (start/end of a rain's effect) and the centers (maybe the peak of the rain's contribution?).\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum water level. The 'water' variable is the current accumulated rainfall at the current position. The 'rate' is the number of overlapping rain contributions at that position. Each time you move to a new position (now), the water increases by rate*(now - prev). \n\nWait, the 'rate' is being incremented when adding a start (since a start adds a new rain's contribution) and decremented by 2 when removing a center? Not sure. The code's logic here is a bit unclear.\n\nThe variables l and r might be tracking the maximum water levels on the left and right sides. The comments in the code mention l and rpos, but I'm not sure how they are being updated. The condition if(water>m && ...) suggests that when the water exceeds m, they are trying to record the position and the value. But the exact purpose is unclear.\n\nThe final check for each i is whether, after removing the i-th day's rain, the maximum a_j would be \u2264 m. The current code uses l and r, but perhaps the approach is incorrect. Let me think of the correct approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each day i, when we remove it, the maximum a_j is the original maximum minus the contribution of day i at its peak position. Wait, but the peak of day i's rain is at x_i, where the contribution is p_i. So, the maximum a_j could be at x_i's position. So, if the original maximum was at x_i, then removing that day's rain would reduce the maximum by p_i. But other days might still contribute to that position.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j could be at some position where multiple days contribute. So, removing one day might not affect that maximum.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. The problem requires for each i, after removing p_i, check if the new maximum is \u2264 m. The naive approach would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n up to 2e5.\n\nTherefore, we need an O(n log n) approach.\n\nLet me think of the maximum a_j as the maximum over all positions j of the sum over all days (max(0, p_k - |x_k - j|)). The maximum is achieved at some position j where the sum is highest.\n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can model the contributions as intervals and track the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j can be found by considering the peaks of each rain. The peak of each rain is at x_i, contributing p_i. The maximum a_j could be the maximum of all p_i plus the contributions from overlapping rains at that position.\n\nWait, but overlapping rains can add up. For example, if two rains have overlapping regions, their contributions add at the overlapping points.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let me think of the problem differently. The maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions j of the sum of (p_i - |x_i - j|) for all i where p_i - |x_i - j| >0.\n\nThe maximum a_j can be found by considering all the peaks (x_i) and the points where two rain's contributions intersect. The maximum is likely to be at one of these points.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum can be found by considering the events where the rain's contributions start and end, and tracking the current maximum as we sweep through the line.\n\nThe initial code's approach might be trying to do this with events. Let me re-examine the code's logic.\n\nThe code uses two priority queues: a and d. The a queue contains all the start and end points of each rain's effect (x_i - p_i and x_i + p_i). The d queue contains the centers x_i. \n\nThe loop processes events in order of their position. The 'rate' variable is the number of currently active rain contributions. Each time we process a start (from a), rate increases by 1. When processing an end (from a?), rate decreases by 1. Wait, but the code's handling is a bit different.\n\nWait, in the code's loop:\n\nThe 'a' queue has all the start and end points. The 'd' queue has the centers. The loop alternates between taking the next event from a or d, whichever comes first.\n\nWait, the code's loop:\n\nprev is initialized to a.poll() (the first event, which is the earliest start or end point). Then, in each iteration, it checks whether the next event is from a (if a's next is before d's next) or from d. \n\nWait, the code's line:\n\nif(d.isEmpty() || a.peek() < d.peek()) now = a.poll();\n\nelse now = d.poll();\n\nSo, the events are processed in order of their position. The 'a' events are the start and end points of the rain's effect, and the 'd' events are the centers (x_i). \n\nThe 'rate' variable is the number of active rain contributions at the current position. When processing a start (x_i - p_i), rate increases by 1. When processing an end (x_i + p_i), rate decreases by 1. But how does the code track which is which?\n\nWait, the code adds x[i]-p[i] and x[i]+p[i] to a. So each start and end is in a. The 'add' variable is set to true if the event came from a (i.e., it's a start or end), else from d (the center). \n\nWait, when the event is from a (add is true), then rate increases by 1. But when it's from d (add is false), then rate decreases by 2? Because the code does rate -=2. That seems odd. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to account for the center's contribution. Wait, the center x_i is the peak of the rain's contribution. The maximum contribution at x_i is p_i. So, when processing the center, maybe the code is trying to track the maximum water at that point. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum water level. The 'water' variable is the accumulated rainfall up to the current position. \n\nWait, the 'water' is being updated as water += rate*(now - prev). So, the rate is the number of active rain contributions between prev and now. The total contribution over that interval is rate multiplied by the distance. \n\nBut how does this relate to the maximum a_j?\n\nThe code then checks if water exceeds m. If so, it records l and r variables. The conditions are a bit unclear. \n\nThe code's final check for each i is:\n\nif (l - Math.max(0, p[i] - |x[i] - lpos|) <= m && ... similar for r ... then 1 else 0.\n\nWait, perhaps l and r are the maximum values of a_j in the original scenario. The lpos and rpos are the positions where those maxima occur. Then, when removing day i, the contribution of that day at lpos and rpos is subtracted, so the new maximum would be the original maximum minus that contribution. If both adjusted maxima are <= m, then it's safe.\n\nBut how are l and r computed?\n\nLooking at the code's loop:\n\nWhen water exceeds m, they set l and lpos if the condition (water - now + lpos ... ) is met? Not sure. The code's condition is:\n\nif(water>m && water - now + lpos >=0) { l = water; lpos = now; }\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum water level. The 'water' variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the maximum a_j. The 'water' variable is the current a_j at position now. Because when moving from prev to now, the rate is the number of active rains, so the contribution between prev and now is rate*(now - prev). But integrating that over the path would give the a_j at now?\n\nWait, perhaps the 'water' variable is the current a_j at the current position. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we start at position lpos (the first event, which is the earliest start point). The initial water is 0. Then, moving to the next event (now), the distance is now - prev. The rate is the number of active rains during that interval. So the a_j increases by rate*(distance) over that interval. So the water variable is the a_j at the current position now?\n\nWait, but the initial code's 'water' is being added as water += rate*(now - prev). So yes, that would be the a_j at the current position. \n\nTherefore, whenever the water exceeds m, the code is trying to record the maximum value and its position. The variables l and r might be the maximum values on the left and right sides, but the conditions are unclear. \n\nThe code's logic for l and r is:\n\nif (water > m) and (water - (now - lpos) >=0) \u2192 then set l and lpos?\n\nWait, the condition is written as:\n\nif(water>m && water - now + lpos >=0) \u2192 perhaps a typo? Because water - (now - lpos) would be water - (now - lpos) = (water + lpos) - now. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the maximum a_j encountered so far. Whenever the water (current a_j) exceeds m, it records the position and the value. But the code's variables l and r are being updated in a way that's unclear. \n\nThe final check for each i is whether, after removing the i-th day's contribution, the maximum a_j (which was originally l or r) minus the contribution of day i at that position is \u2264 m. \n\nSo, for each day i, the code checks if the original maximum (l or r) minus the contribution of day i at those positions is \u2264 m. If both are, then it's safe. \n\nBut how are l and r computed correctly?\n\nThe problem is that the code's current approach might not be correctly tracking the maximum a_j. Let me think of a test case.\n\nTake the first sample input from the problem's note. Suppose the third day's rain is the one that causes the maximum. When we remove it, the maximum should drop below m. \n\nBut according to the code's logic, the l and r variables would have stored the original maximum. Then, subtracting the contribution of the third day at lpos (the position where the maximum was) would give the new maximum. \n\nHowever, the code's current approach may not be correctly tracking the maximum. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is incorrect, and I need to find a better way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions j of the sum of (p_i - |x_i - j|) for all i where p_i >= |x_i - j|.\n\nTo compute this efficiently, note that the maximum can only occur at certain critical points: the centers x_i, or the intersection points between two rain's peaks.\n\nThe maximum a_j can be found by considering all x_i and the midpoints between pairs of x_i's. But for n up to 2e5, this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can model the problem using line sweep and events.\n\nLet me think of the events as the start and end of each rain's effect. Each rain contributes a diamond-shaped area. The maximum a_j is the highest point in the union of all these diamonds.\n\nThe maximum a_j can be found by tracking the current maximum as we sweep through the line.\n\nThe line sweep approach would process all events (start and end of each rain's effect) in order. At each position, we can track the current sum of active p_i's contributions. \n\nWait, but the contribution of each rain at position j is p_i - |x_i - j|, but only when j is within [x_i - p_i, x_i + p_i]. \n\nAlternatively, the contribution of a rain at position j is max(0, p_i - |x_i - j|). \n\nThe total a_j is the sum over all i of this value. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of this sum over all j.\n\nTo compute this maximum efficiently, perhaps we can model the contributions as intervals and track the maximum sum.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into a problem of finding the maximum of the sum of certain linear functions over the real line.\n\nEach rain contributes a V-shaped function centered at x_i, with a peak of p_i at x_i, decreasing linearly to zero at x_i \u00b1 p_i. The total a_j is the sum of all these V-shaped functions. The maximum of this sum is the desired value.\n\nThe maximum of the sum of V-shaped functions can be found by considering the points where the derivative changes. The maximum occurs either at one of the centers x_i, or at the intersection points between two adjacent V's.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum can be found by considering all the events (start and end points of each rain's effect) and tracking the current maximum as we sweep through the line.\n\nLet me think of the line sweep approach:\n\n- All events are the start (x_i - p_i) and end (x_i + p_i) of each rain's effect, plus the centers (x_i) where the peak occurs.\n\n- We sort all these events in order of their position.\n\n- As we sweep from left to right, we track the current active contributions (the set of rains that are currently affecting the current position).\n\nWait, but tracking the sum of all active contributions' contributions at the current position is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j can be tracked by considering the current maximum as we process each event. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j can be found by considering the peaks of each rain and the overlaps between them. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as a line sweep where we track the current maximum a_j as we move along the line. \n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Collect all events: for each rain i, add two events: a start at (x_i - p_i, +p_i) and an end at (x_i + p_i, -p_i). Also, add the center x_i as a point where the peak is.\n\n2. Sort all events by their position. \n\n3. As we sweep through the events, we track the current contribution from all active rains. The contribution at a point is the sum of (p_i - |x_i - pos|) for all active rains. \n\nWait, but how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, the contribution at a position can be represented as the sum of the linear functions. The maximum of this sum can be tracked by maintaining the current maximum and updating it as we process events.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j can be found by considering the events in order and keeping track of the current maximum. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the maximum of all p_i plus the contributions from overlapping rains at their peaks. \n\nWait, the peak of each rain is at x_i, where its contribution is p_i. The total a_j at x_i is the sum of p_i plus the contributions from other rains at that point. \n\nSo, the maximum a_j is the maximum over all x_i of (sum of p_k - |x_k - x_i| for all k where x_i is within [x_k - p_k, x_k + p_k]).\n\nThis is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nHmm, so this approach won't work. \n\nAlternative idea inspired by the initial code's approach:\n\nThe initial code uses two priority queues to track events. Let me try to understand what it's doing.\n\nThe code's variables:\n\n- a is a priority queue containing all the start and end points of the rain's effect (x_i - p_i and x_i + p_i). \n\n- d is a priority queue containing the centers x_i.\n\nThe loop processes events in order of their position. The events are either from a (start/end) or from d (center). \n\nThe 'rate' variable is the number of active rain contributions at the current position. \n\nThe 'water' variable is the accumulated rainfall at the current position. \n\nWait, perhaps 'water' is the current a_j at the current position. \n\nThe loop proceeds as follows:\n\nprev is the previous position. \n\nNow, the next event is either from a (start/end) or d (center). \n\nThe distance between prev and now is (now - prev). \n\nThe 'rate' is the number of active rains between prev and now. \n\nThe contribution to a_j over this interval is rate * (now - prev). \n\nWait, but that would be the integral over the interval, not the a_j at now. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 'water' variable is the a_j at the current position. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nInitially, prev is the first event (the earliest start point). \n\nThen, moving to now, the distance is (now - prev). \n\nThe rate is the number of active rains during that interval. \n\nThe a_j increases by rate*(distance) over that interval. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the a_j at now is the previous a_j plus rate*(distance). \n\nWait, but the a_j is the sum of all contributions up to now? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the 'water' variable is the current a_j at the current position. \n\nWait, let's think of an example:\n\nSuppose there is one rain with x=5, p=3. \n\nThe start is 2, end is 8. \n\nThe events in a are 2 and 8. The d has 5. \n\nThe initial prev is 2 (a.poll()), then the next event is 5 (from d). \n\nBetween 2 and 5, the rate is 1 (since it's a start). \n\nSo water += 1*(5-2) \u2192 water becomes 3. \n\nAt position 5, the a_j is 3 (from the rain's contribution at 5: p_i - |5-5| =3). \n\nThen, the next event is 8 (end). \n\nBetween 5 and 8, the rate is still 1 (since the end hasn't been processed yet). \n\nWait, no. When processing the end (8), the rate would decrease by 1. \n\nWait, the code's handling of events from a:\n\nWhen an event is from a (add is true), then it's either a start or end. \n\nWait, the code adds both x_i-p_i and x_i+p_i to a. So, the start is x_i-p_i, and the end is x_i+p_i. \n\nWhen processing a start (x_i-p_i), the rate increases by 1. \n\nWhen processing an end (x_i+p_i), the rate decreases by 1. \n\nBut in the code, when the event is from a (add is true), rate increases by 1. \n\nWhen it's from d (add is false), then rate -=2. \n\nWait, why subtract 2? \n\nAh, perhaps the code is trying to account for the center's contribution. \n\nWait, the center x_i is the peak of the rain's contribution. The maximum contribution from this rain is p_i. \n\nBut when processing the center, the code subtracts 2 from the rate? That doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code has a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the maximum a_j. \n\nThe 'water' variable is the current a_j at the current position. \n\nWhen processing a start (x_i-p_i), the rain starts contributing, so the rate increases by 1. \n\nWhen processing an end (x_i+p_i), the rain stops contributing, so rate decreases by 1. \n\nThe 'rate' is the number of active rains at the current position. \n\nThe 'water' is the sum of all contributions up to now? Or the current a_j?\n\nWait, the code's 'water' is being updated as water += rate*(now - prev). \n\nSuppose we are moving from position prev to now. \n\nThe rate is the number of active rains during that interval. \n\nThe contribution to a_j at any point in this interval is the sum of all active rains' contributions at that point. \n\nBut the contribution of each active rain at position j is p_i - |x_i - j|. \n\nThe integral of this over the interval [prev, now] would be the area under the curve, but the 'water' variable is accumulating this. \n\nWait, but the a_j is the value at the current position, not the integral. \n\nThis suggests that the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum a_j encountered so far. \n\nThe 'water' variable is the current a_j at the current position. \n\nWhen water exceeds m, the code records the current value and position in l and r variables. \n\nThe variables l and r might be the maximum values on the left and right sides. \n\nThe code's final check for each i is whether removing the i-th day's contribution would reduce the maximum a_j (stored in l or r) below or equal to m. \n\nThe condition is:\n\nif (l - Math.max(0, p[i] - Math.abs(x[i] - lpos)) <= m) \n\nand similarly for r. \n\nThis suggests that the maximum a_j in the original scenario is the maximum between l and r. \n\nThe lpos and rpos are the positions where those maxima occurred. \n\nSo, when we remove the i-th day's rain, the contribution of that day at lpos and rpos is subtracted. \n\nIf both adjusted maxima are \u2264 m, then it's safe. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is to find the global maximum a_j (stored in l and r?), and then for each day, check if removing its contribution at those positions would bring the maximum down. \n\nBut how are l and r computed correctly?\n\nLooking back at the code's loop:\n\nInitially, l and r are set to -1e9 and 0. \n\nThen, in the loop:\n\nwater += rate*(now - prev);\n\nif (water > m && (water - (now - lpos) >=0)) \u2192 then set l = water, lpos = now. \n\nWait, the condition is water - (now - lpos) >=0? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum a_j. Whenever the current water (a_j) exceeds m, it records the current value and position. \n\nBut the code's conditions for updating l and r are unclear. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to track the maximum a_j encountered so far. \n\nThe variables l and r might be the maximum values on the left and right of the current position. \n\nAlternatively, the code might have a bug in the way it's tracking the maximum. \n\nGiven that the problem requires an efficient solution, perhaps the correct approach is to precompute for each day the maximum a_j when that day is removed, and see if it's \u2264 m. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea inspired by the problem's note:\n\nThe maximum a_j can be found by considering all the peaks (x_i) and the intersections between the rain's peaks. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum over all positions j of the sum of p_i - |x_i - j| for all i where this is positive. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can model the problem as a line sweep where we track the current maximum. \n\nLet me think of the events as the start and end of each rain's effect. \n\nEach rain contributes a segment from x_i - p_i to x_i + p_i, with a linear increase then decrease. \n\nThe maximum a_j can be found by considering all the events and tracking the current maximum. \n\nThe line sweep approach would process events in order of their position. \n\nAt each event, we can update the current maximum. \n\nThe events are:\n\n- Start of a rain: when entering the interval, the contribution increases. \n\n- End of a rain: when leaving the interval, the contribution decreases. \n\n- The peak of a rain: the point where the contribution is maximum for that rain. \n\nBut how to track the maximum a_j as we sweep through the line?\n\nPerhaps the maximum a_j can be tracked by maintaining the current maximum and updating it as we process each event. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the maximum between the current maximum and the contribution at the current position. \n\nThe contribution at the current position can be computed as the sum of all active rains' contributions. \n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nHmm, this seems challenging. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the maximum a_j is the maximum of all p_i plus the sum of overlaps with other rains at their peaks. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum a_j is the maximum of all p_i plus the contributions from other rains at their peak positions. \n\nWait, the peak of each rain is at x_i, where its contribution is p_i. The total a_j at x_i is the sum of p_i plus the contributions from other rains at x_i. \n\nSo, for each x_i, the a_j at x_i is the sum over all other rains of max(0, p_k - |x_k - x_i|) plus p_i. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of this over all x_i. \n\nThis reduces the problem to computing for each x_i the sum of contributions from all other rains at x_i, plus p_i. \n\nThe maximum of these values is the global maximum. \n\nIf we can compute this for each x_i efficiently, then for each day i, when we remove it, the new maximum would be the maximum of (sum for x_j excluding i's contribution) over all j. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe sum for x_i is sum_{k\u2260i} max(0, p_k - |x_k - x_i|) + p_i. \n\nThis is equivalent to sum_{k} max(0, p_k - |x_k - x_i|) \n\nSo the maximum a_j is the maximum over all x_i of the sum of max(0, p_k - |x_k - x_i|) for all k. \n\nThis is the same as the maximum a_j over all positions j (since the maximum must occur at one of the x_i's). \n\nTherefore, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the sum at each x_i. \n\nThis is a crucial insight! \n\nSo, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the sum at each x_i. \n\nTherefore, to compute the maximum, we can compute for each x_i the sum of all p_k - |x_k - x_i| when that term is positive, and take the maximum over all i. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe sum for x_i is the sum over all k of max(0, p_k - |x_k - x_i|). \n\nThis can be rewritten as the sum over all k where x_i is within [x_k - p_k, x_k + p_k] of (p_k - |x_k - x_i|). \n\nThis is equivalent to the sum of the contributions of all rains that cover x_i. \n\nThe problem now is to compute for each x_i the sum of p_k - |x_k - x_i| for all k where x_i is within the interval [x_k - p_k, x_k + p_k]. \n\nThis seems computationally heavy for large n. \n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute this efficiently using some data structures. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each rain k, its contribution to x_i is max(0, p_k - |x_k - x_i|). \n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nif x_i is between x_k - p_k and x_k + p_k, then the contribution is p_k - |x_k - x_i|. \n\nElse, 0. \n\nThe contribution is a V-shaped function centered at x_k with peak p_k. \n\nThe sum over all k of these functions is the a_j at position j. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of this sum over all j. \n\nTo find the maximum, we can consider that the maximum occurs at one of the x_i's (the centers of the rains). \n\nTherefore, the maximum is the maximum of the sum at each x_i. \n\nSo, for each x_i, we need to compute the sum of all contributions from other rains at x_i. \n\nThe contribution from rain k to x_i is max(0, p_k - |x_k - x_i|). \n\nThe total sum for x_i is the sum over all k of this term. \n\nThe problem now is to compute this sum for each x_i efficiently. \n\nLet me think of the contribution from each rain k to x_i:\n\nThe contribution is p_k - |x_k - x_i| if x_i is within [x_k - p_k, x_k + p_k], else 0. \n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nif x_i is in [x_k - p_k, x_k + p_k], then contribution is p_k - |x_k - x_i|. \n\nElse 0. \n\nThe sum for x_i is the sum of all such terms. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can pre-process the rains in a way that allows us to query the sum for a given x_i quickly. \n\nBut for n=2e5, even O(n log n) per query would be too slow. \n\nAlternative idea: \n\nThe contribution of rain k to x_i can be expressed as:\n\nmax(0, p_k - (x_i - x_k)) if x_i >=x_k, and x_i <=x_k + p_k \n\nOR \n\nmax(0, p_k - (x_k - x_i)) if x_i <=x_k, and x_i >=x_k - p_k \n\nElse 0. \n\nThis can be viewed as the contribution is a linear function in the region between x_k - p_k and x_k + p_k. \n\nThe total sum is the sum of all these linear functions. \n\nThe maximum of this sum occurs at one of the critical points (the x_i's or the intersection points between two functions). \n\nBut again, this is not helpful for large n. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can find for each x_i the sum by considering the intervals where x_i is covered by other rains. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each rain k, its contribution to x_i is non-zero only if x_i is within [x_k - p_k, x_k + p_k]. \n\nThe contribution is p_k - |x_k - x_i|. \n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\nif x_i is between x_k - p_k and x_k + p_k:\n\ncontribution = p_k - (distance between x_i and x_k). \n\nThe distance is |x_i -x_k|. \n\nSo, the contribution is p_k - distance. \n\nThe total sum for x_i is the sum over all k where x_i is in [x_k - p_k, x_k + p_k] of (p_k - distance). \n\nThis can be rewritten as sum_{k in S} (p_k - (x_i -x_k)) if x_i >=x_k \n\nor sum_{k in S} (p_k - (x_k -x_i)) if x_i <=x_k \n\nwhere S is the set of k where x_i is within their interval. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can pre-process the rains in a way that allows us to compute this sum quickly for any x_i. \n\nLet me consider sorting the rains by their x_k. \n\nSuppose we sort all the rains in increasing order of x_k. \n\nFor a given x_i, we can find all k where x_i is within [x_k - p_k, x_k + p_k]. \n\nThis can be done using binary search. \n\nBut even then, for each x_i, finding all such k would take O(log n) time, but summing their contributions would take O(n) time in the worst case. \n\nThis is not feasible for n=2e5. \n\nAlternative idea inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum over all x_i of the sum of contributions from all other rains at x_i plus p_i. \n\nWait, the sum for x_i is the sum of all contributions from all rains (including itself). \n\nSo, the maximum is the maximum of this sum over all x_i. \n\nLet me think of the contribution of each rain k to all x_i's. \n\nThe contribution of rain k to x_i is max(0, p_k - |x_k -x_i|). \n\nThe total sum for x_i is the sum over all k of this term. \n\nThe maximum of this sum is what we need. \n\nNow, the problem requires for each i, when we remove rain i (set p_i to 0), what is the new maximum? \n\nThe new maximum would be the maximum over all x_j of the sum excluding the contribution of rain i. \n\nThe contribution of rain i to x_j is max(0, p_i - |x_i -x_j|). \n\nSo, the new sum for x_j is the original sum minus this term. \n\nThe new maximum is the maximum of (original_sum_j - contribution_i_j) over all j. \n\nIf this new maximum is \u2264m, then the answer is 1 for that i. \n\nThe challenge is to compute for each i the maximum of (original_sum_j - contribution_i_j) over all j. \n\nThe original_sum_j is the maximum of the original sums. \n\nBut when we remove rain i, the new maximum could be either the original maximum (if it wasn't affected by rain i) or some other position's sum. \n\nThis seems difficult. \n\nAlternative approach inspired by the initial code's variables:\n\nThe initial code's variables l and r might be storing the maximum a_j and its position. \n\nThe code's final check for each i is whether the maximum a_j (stored in l and r) minus the contribution of i at those positions is \u2264m. \n\nThis suggests that the maximum a_j is either at lpos or rpos. \n\nIf this is the case, then for each i, we only need to check whether removing its contribution at those positions would bring the maximum down. \n\nThis would be O(1) per i, after finding the maximum and its position. \n\nBut how to find the maximum and its position efficiently?\n\nThe initial code's approach might be trying to do this with a line sweep. \n\nPerhaps the line sweep tracks the current a_j and whenever it exceeds m, it records the current maximum and position. \n\nThe variables l and r might be the leftmost and rightmost positions where the maximum occurs. \n\nAlternatively, the code's variables l and r are the maximum values encountered during the sweep. \n\nThe code's loop:\n\nInitially, l and r are set to -1e9 and 0. \n\nThen, for each event, the water (current a_j) is computed. \n\nIf water exceeds m, then the code checks some conditions and updates l and r. \n\nThe conditions are:\n\nif (water > m && (water - (now - lpos) >=0)) \u2192 then set l = water, lpos = now. \n\nWait, perhaps the condition is checking whether the current position is the leftmost or rightmost point where the maximum occurs. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be trying to track the maximum a_j and its position. \n\nThe variables l and r might be the maximum a_j and its position. \n\nBut the code's logic is unclear. \n\nPerhaps the code is incorrect and needs to be rewritten. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for the correct approach and then see what code is needed. \n\nThe correct approach is:\n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of the sum of all contributions at each x_i. \n\nTo compute this maximum, we can compute for each x_i the sum of contributions from all other rains at x_i plus p_i. \n\nThe maximum of these is the global maximum. \n\nThen, for each i, when we remove it, the new maximum is the maximum of (sum_j - contribution_i_j) for all j. \n\nThe contribution_i_j is the contribution of rain i to position j. \n\nThe new maximum will be the maximum between the previous maximum (if it wasn't at a position affected by rain i) and other positions. \n\nBut this is still O(n^2), which is not feasible. \n\nAlternative idea inspired by the problem's note:\n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum of all p_i plus the sum of overlaps with other rains at their peaks. \n\nWait, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the sum of all contributions at each x_i. \n\nThe contribution of rain k to x_i is max(0, p_k - |x_k -x_i|). \n\nThe sum for x_i is the sum over all k of this term. \n\nThis can be rewritten as the sum over all k of p_k - |x_k -x_i| if x_i is within the interval of k, else 0. \n\nThe maximum of this sum is what we need. \n\nTo compute this efficiently, perhaps we can model this as a line sweep and track the current maximum. \n\nThe line sweep would process all events (start and end of each rain's interval) and track the current contribution. \n\nThe maximum a_j is the maximum value of the current contribution during the sweep. \n\nThis approach would be O(n log n) time. \n\nLet me outline this approach:\n\n1. Collect all events: for each rain i, add two events: a start event at (x_i - p_i, +p_i) and an end event at (x_i + p_i, -p_i). \n\n2. Sort all events by their position. \n\n3. Also, collect all the centers x_i and sort them. \n\n4. Initialize variables: current contribution (current_water), max_water, and the position where it occurs. \n\n5. Sweep through the events in order of their position. \n\n6. For each event, update the current_water by adding the event's value (p_i for start, -p_i for end). \n\n7. Also, whenever we pass a center x_i, we check if the current_water is the new maximum. \n\nWait, but the maximum could occur anywhere between events. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum could be at a center x_i. \n\nSo, during the sweep, whenever we reach a center x_i, we record the current_water as the contribution at x_i. \n\nThe maximum of all these recorded values is the global maximum. \n\nThis way, we can track the maximum a_j by checking the contribution at each center. \n\nThis approach would work because the maximum a_j must occur at one of the centers. \n\nBecause the contribution of each rain is maximized at its own center. \n\nTherefore, the maximum of all the contributions at the centers will be the global maximum. \n\nThis is a crucial insight! \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each center x_i, compute the contribution at x_i, which is the sum of all p_k - |x_k -x_i| for all k where x_i is within the interval of k. \n\nThe maximum of these is the global maximum. \n\nTo compute this efficiently:\n\nWe can perform a line sweep to track the current contribution as we move along the line. \n\nThe events are the start and end of each rain's interval. \n\nWe also need to record the contribution at each center x_i. \n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n1. Collect all events:\n\n   For each rain i:\n\n   - Add a start event at position (x_i - p_i) with type 'start' and value p_i. \n\n   - Add an end event at position (x_i + p_i) with type 'end' and value -p_i. \n\n2. Also, collect all the centers x_i and sort them. \n\n3. Sort all events by their position. \n\n4. Initialize variables:\n\n   current_contribution = 0 \n\n   max_contribution = 0 \n\n   current_max_position = 0 \n\n   Also, create a list to store the centers and their corresponding contribution. \n\n5. Iterate through the events in order of their position. \n\n   Also, keep track of the current position. \n\n   We also need to process the centers in order. \n\n   To do this, we can have a pointer to the next center to process. \n\n   For example:\n\n   - Sort all centers in increasing order. \n\n   - Initialize a pointer j=0 to the first center. \n\n   - As we process events, whenever the current event's position is >= the current center's position, we record the current_contribution as the contribution at that center. \n\n   - Move the pointer j to the next center. \n\n6. After processing all events, the maximum contribution among all centers is the global maximum. \n\nThis way, the maximum a_j is the maximum of the recorded contributions at the centers. \n\nThis approach is O(n log n) because sorting the events and centers takes O(n log n), and processing them is linear. \n\nOnce we have the global maximum and the positions where it occurs, we can proceed to compute for each i whether removing it would reduce the maximum below or equal to m. \n\nNow, for each rain i:\n\nWhen we remove it, the contribution of this rain is removed from all positions. \n\nThe new contribution at any position j is the original contribution minus the contribution of rain i at j. \n\nThe new maximum is the maximum of (original_contribution_j - contribution_i_j) for all j. \n\nTo determine if this new maximum is \u2264m, we need to find the maximum of (original_contribution_j - contribution_i_j) over all j. \n\nThe maximum could be either:\n\n- The original maximum (if it was not at a position affected by rain i). \n\n- Or the new maximum after subtracting the contribution of i from the original maximum's position. \n\n- Or some other position's contribution after subtraction. \n\nThis seems difficult to compute for each i. \n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for each rain i the maximum of (original_contribution_j - contribution_i_j) over all j. \n\nTo compute this efficiently:\n\nThe maximum after removing rain i is the maximum of (original_contribution_j - contribution_i_j) for all j. \n\nThis can be rewritten as the maximum of (original_contribution_j - (p_i - |x_i - j|) if j is within the interval of i, else original_contribution_j). \n\nThe maximum is thus the maximum between:\n\n- The original maximum excluding the contribution of i at its own position. \n\n- The maximum of all other positions' contributions minus their contribution from i. \n\nThis is still not straightforward. \n\nAlternative idea:\n\nThe maximum after removing rain i is the maximum of all original_contribution_j minus the contribution of i at j. \n\nThe maximum can be found by taking the original maximum and subtracting the contribution of i at the position where the original maximum occurred. \n\nIf this is \u2264m, then it's possible that the new maximum is this value. \n\nBut there might be other positions where the contribution after subtraction is higher. \n\nHowever, this is the best we can do without more information. \n\nTherefore, the maximum after removing i is at least the original maximum minus the contribution of i at the original maximum's position. \n\nIf this is \u2264m, then the new maximum is definitely \u2264m. \n\nBut if it's >m, then the new maximum could be higher than this value, so we need to check other positions. \n\nThis suggests that the initial approach of checking only the original maximum's position is insufficient. \n\nBut given the problem's constraints, perhaps the initial code's approach is correct in checking the contribution at the original maximum's position. \n\nWait, the problem requires that after removing rain i, there is no flood. \n\nThe flood occurs if any position has a_j >m. \n\nSo, to ensure that no flood occurs, the maximum a_j after removal must be \u2264m. \n\nThe maximum a_j after removal is the maximum of (original_contribution_j - contribution_i_j) for all j. \n\nTo ensure this is \u2264m, it's sufficient to check that for all j where original_contribution_j was the maximum, the new contribution after subtraction is \u2264m. \n\nBecause if the original maximum was at position j, then after subtraction, the new contribution there is (original_max - contribution_i_j). \n\nIf this is \u2264m, then the new maximum could be this value or lower. \n\nBut there might be other positions where the contribution after subtraction is higher than this. \n\nHowever, if the original maximum was the only position where the contribution exceeded m, then removing the contribution of i at that position might bring it down. \n\nBut this is not guaranteed. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the initial code's approach is correct in that the maximum a_j is stored in l and r, and the check is whether removing the i-th day's contribution at those positions brings the maximum down. \n\nAssuming that the maximum a_j occurs at either lpos or rpos, then the code's approach would work. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the FastReader's next() method is the line that reads the next line when the tokenizer is empty. \n\nLooking at the FastReader class's next() method:\n\nThe code has:\n\npublic String next() {\n\n    while (st == null || !st.hasMoreElements()) {\n\n        try {\n\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n\n            e.printStackTrace();\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return st.nextToken();\n\n}\n\nThe missing part is the line that reads the next line from the buffer and tokenizes it. \n\nThe standard implementation for a FastReader's next() method would read a new line into the buffer when the current tokens are exhausted. \n\nThe code inside the while loop should read the next line:\n\nbr.readLine() and then set st = new StringTokenizer(line). \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nTherefore, the completed next() method would be:\n\npublic String next() {\n\n    while (st == null || !st.hasMoreElements()) {\n\n        try {\n\n            st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n\n            e.printStackTrace();\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    return st.nextToken();\n\n}\n\nThis is the standard implementation for a FastReader class. \n\nThe rest of the code may have logical errors, but the question only asks to fill in the missing code in the FastReader's next() method. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the line inside the try block that reads the next line and initializes the tokenizer. \n\nThe correct line is:\n\nst = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());\n\nSo the answer is to fill that line in the next() method."
