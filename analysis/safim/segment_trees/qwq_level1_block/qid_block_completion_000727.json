So the code here should print \"Division 2\" for that case. So the line should be something like: print(\"Division 2\"). Because the condition is already checking if it's >=1600, and since the previous if didn't trigger (so less than 1900), this covers Division 2. Then the next elif is for >=1400, which is Division 3.

For example, the sixth test case with 1679: that's in Division2. So the code would hit the second condition (1679 >=1600 is true, so print Division2. Correct. Another example: 1400 would go to the third elif (since 1400 >=1400, so Division3. That's right. And for 1399, the first two conditions (1900 and 1600) are false, then check the third: 1399 is not >=1400, so it goes to else, Division4. Which matches the note.
