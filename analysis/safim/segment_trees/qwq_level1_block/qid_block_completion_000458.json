The problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key here is that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he randomly selects a reachable city (via non-blocked roads) and moves there. The goal is to find the smallest d where they can ensure arrival at city n within d days no matter what. Hmm, the code provided seems to be using some kind of BFS or dynamic programming approach. Let me look at the code structure.",

Another thing to check: the loop is written as for(ll i=0; i<m+1; i++), which is equivalent to for (i from 0 to m inclusive). Because m+1 is the upper limit, but the loop runs while i < m+1. Wait, the loop is written as for(ll i=0; i<m+1; i++), so it runs from 0 to m. \n\nBut the code's q is declared as vector<ll> q[m+1]; which is an array of m+1 vectors.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key here is that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he randomly selects a reachable city (via non-blocked roads) and moves there. The goal is to find the smallest d where they can ensure arrival at city n within d days no matter what.\n\nHmm, the code provided seems to be using some kind of BFS or dynamic programming approach. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nThe code starts by reading the input, then for each road, it's storing the reverse edges (par[v] has all u such that there's an edge from u to v). The child array counts the number of outgoing edges from each node. \n\nThen there's a queue q which is an array of vectors, indexed by days. The initial queue q[0] has node n (the destination). The idea might be to work backwards from n, calculating the minimal days required for each node to reach n.\n\nLooking at the loop: for each i from 0 to m (days), it processes each node in q[i]. For each such node s, it marks it as visited, sets ans[s] to i (the current day count), then iterates over all parents u of s. \n\nThe comment says that res is the days to reach u from n. The formula given is res = i + (child[u] - 1) + 1. Let me think why that is. \n\nWait, maybe the logic here is that for each parent u of s, to get from u to s, AmShZ might need to block some roads. Let's see: the child[u] is the number of outgoing edges from u. When considering u's contribution to the path, perhaps the number of days needed is based on how many roads need to be blocked. \n\nWait, the problem allows AmShZ to block roads. The strategy would involve blocking roads that are not on the optimal path so that Keshi is forced towards the desired path. \n\nAlternatively, the approach here might be modeling the minimal days required for each node to reach n. The ans array holds the minimal days for each node. \n\nThe formula for res is i (current days to reach s) plus (child[u] - 1) (the number of roads to block from u's other edges besides the one leading to s) plus 1 (the day when Keshi moves from u to s). \n\nWait, let me break down the formula:\n\nchild[u] is the original number of outgoing edges from u. When processing u's parent, perhaps each time we process a parent, we need to account for blocking the other edges except the path leading to s. \n\nSo for node u, to get to s, you have to block all other outgoing edges except the one to s. Each blocked road takes a day (since each day you can block one road). Then, on the next day, you can tell Keshi to move, which takes him to s. \n\nWait, the total days would be the days taken to reach u (ans[u]?) plus the number of roads to block (child[u] - 1, since one is the path to s) plus 1 day to move. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the ans[s] is being set to i, which is the current day level. The code is processing nodes in reverse, starting from n. \n\nWait, the code is processing nodes in reverse order, starting from n. The q array is structured such that q[i] holds nodes that can reach n in i days. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that for each node s, ans[s] is the minimal number of days required to get from s to n. \n\nSo when processing a node s in q[i], which has ans[s] = i, then for each parent u of s, the path from u to s can be considered. To get from u to s, you need to block all other outgoing edges of u except the one to s. The number of roads to block is (child[u] - 1), each taking a day. Then, you need one more day to tell Keshi to move (so he can choose s). \n\nTherefore, the total days required for u would be ans[s] (the days from s to n) plus (child[u] - 1) blocked days plus 1 day to move. \n\nSo the res variable here is i (since ans[s] is i) plus (child[u] -1) +1. \n\nSo res = i + (child[u] -1) +1 = i + child[u]. \n\nWait, but the code's formula is written as i + (child[u]-1) +1, which simplifies to i + child[u]. \n\nSo the total days required for u would be res = i + child[u]. \n\nBut then, if this res is less than the current ans[u], then we can set ans[u] to res. \n\nWait, but in the code, the ans array is being set when the node is first processed. So perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal days for each node. \n\nThe code's loop is processing nodes in order of increasing days. So for each u, when we process it through its parent s, we can compute a possible ans[u] as res. \n\nBut the code currently has a comment saying \"TODO: Your code here\". The code inside the if statement (if res < m+1) needs to do something. \n\nLooking at the code structure, after calculating res, if res is less than m+1, then we need to add u to the queue q[res], so that when we process that day, we can propagate further. \n\nWait, the q array is structured such that q[i] contains all nodes that can reach n in i days. So when we compute res for u, if res is within the allowed days (<= m?), then we can add u to q[res], so that when we process that day, we can process u's parents. \n\nWait, but the code's loop is iterating over i from 0 to m+1. Hmm, perhaps the maximum possible days is m, since each blocked road takes a day, and there are m roads. \n\nWait, the problem allows blocking roads, each taking a day, and moving takes a day as well. So the total days could be up to m (blocking all roads except the path) plus the number of steps. \n\nBut the code's q is an array of size m+1, so maybe the maximum days considered is m. \n\nSo, in the code, when res is less than m+1, then we can add u to q[res], so that when we process that day, we can process u's parents. \n\nAdditionally, the code is decrementing child[u] after processing each parent. Wait, why? \n\nThe comment says: \"child[u]-- // next time this node comes up as a parent, we don't need to block this path which has been calculated beforehand, i.e. gives a lower ans\". \n\nAh, because when we process a parent u through one of its children s, we are considering the path through s. The child[u] is the number of outgoing edges. But once we process this path, we might have already accounted for blocking the other edges except the one to s. So when another child of u is processed, we don't need to count that edge again. \n\nWait, perhaps the child[u] is being used to track how many edges are left to block. Each time we process a parent u via one of its children, we subtract 1 from child[u], because that edge to the child is now considered as the one not blocked. \n\nWait, maybe the child[u] is the number of outgoing edges from u. When processing a parent u through s (one of its children), the number of edges to block is (child[u] - 1) because we can leave the edge to s unblocked. But once we process this, we need to decrease child[u] so that when another child is processed, the count is adjusted. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model that each time we process a parent u via a child s, we are considering that the edge to s is kept, and the others are blocked. So the next time another child of u is considered, the remaining edges to block would be (child[u] - 1 - 1) etc. \n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. \n\nThe code's approach is working backwards from n. For each node s in q[i], which can reach n in i days, we look at all parents u of s. \n\nThe idea is that to get from u to n, you can take the path through s. To do that, you need to block all other outgoing edges of u except the one to s. The number of edges to block is (child[u] - 1). Each blocked edge takes a day. Then, you need one day to move from u to s. \n\nSo the total days for u would be the days for s (i) plus (child[u] -1) blocked days plus 1 move day, so i + (child[u] -1) +1 = i + child[u]. \n\nTherefore, the res is i + child[u]. \n\nBut when we process another parent of u (another child of u?), perhaps the child count needs to be adjusted. \n\nWait, the code does child[u]-- after processing all the parents. Wait, no, the code is inside the loop over the parents. For each u in par[s], the code is processing each parent, and then after processing all of them, it's decrementing child[u]? \n\nWait, no, the code is inside the loop over the parents. Let me look again:\n\nThe code is:\n\nfor (auto u : par[s]) {\n    if (vis[u]) continue;\n    res = i + (child[u]-1) +1;\n    if (res < m+1) {\n        // TODO\n    }\n    child[u]--;\n}\n\nWait, the child[u]-- is done for each u in par[s], regardless of whether the res is valid. \n\nHmm, that might be a problem. Because for each parent u of s, we are decrementing child[u], but perhaps this is to account for the edge from u to s being kept (so we don't have to block it). \n\nWait, the child[u] is the original number of outgoing edges. When processing u through s, the edge to s is kept, so the number of edges to block is (child[u] -1). But once we process this, the next time another child of u is processed, the remaining edges to block would be (child[u] -1 -1), but since we have already subtracted 1, the next time, the child[u] would be (original -1), so the next calculation would be (child[u] -1) again. \n\nWait, perhaps the child[u] is being decremented each time we process a parent u through one of its children. Because each time, we are considering that one edge (to the child) is kept, so the remaining edges to block are reduced by 1 each time. \n\nWait, but this might not be the right approach. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose u has 3 outgoing edges: to s1, s2, s3. \n\nFirst, when processing s1, we calculate res for u as i + (3-1) +1 = i+3. Then, we subtract 1 from child[u], so child[u] becomes 2. \n\nThen, when processing s2, the next time, the calculation would be (child[u] -1) = 2-1 =1, so res would be i + (2-1) +1 = i+2. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because when processing s2, the number of edges to block would be (original edges -1 -1) (since we have already considered keeping the edge to s1, but now we are considering keeping the edge to s2). \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Maybe the child[u] should be the number of edges remaining to block, but I'm getting confused here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to model that each time you process a parent u through a child s, you are considering that the edge to s is kept, so the number of edges to block is (child[u] -1). But since we have already accounted for that edge, we subtract 1 from child[u] so that in future calculations, it's not counted again. \n\nWait, but the child[u] is the original count. So when you process the first s, you subtract 1, so the next time you process another s', the child[u] is now 2 (if original was 3). So the next calculation would be (2-1) +1, which is 2. \n\nBut the actual number of edges to block would be (original edges - 2) (since two edges are kept: s and s'). \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not correct. Maybe the code's logic is flawed here, but since the problem requires me to complete the code, perhaps I should focus on what's missing in the code as per the given code structure. \n\nLooking back at the code's TODO section. The code has an if statement checking if res < m+1. Inside that, what should be done? \n\nThe idea is that if the computed res (the days required for u) is valid (i.e., within the maximum possible days), then we need to add u to the queue for that day. \n\nSo, the code should push u into q[res], so that when we process that day, we can process u's parents. \n\nAdditionally, since ans[u] hasn't been set yet, we need to mark it as unvisited until it's processed. \n\nWait, but the code's current setup uses a visited array. So when we process a node s, we mark it as visited. So for u, if it's not visited yet, then when we compute res, we can add it to q[res], and when that day is processed, it will set ans[u] to res. \n\nTherefore, the missing code inside the if block should be:\n\nq[res].push_back(u);\n\nBut also, since we want the minimal days, perhaps we need to check if u hasn't been visited yet. Because if it's already been visited with a smaller ans, then we don't need to process it again. \n\nWait, the code's loop is processing nodes in order of increasing i. So when we process a node s in q[i], and compute res for u, if res is smaller than the current ans[u], then we can add it to q[res]. \n\nBut the code's current setup uses the visited array. Once a node is visited, it's not processed again. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is designed so that the first time a node is added to q[res], it's the minimal possible ans. Because the queues are processed in order of increasing days. \n\nTherefore, the code should add u to q[res], and then when that day is processed, it will set ans[u] to res. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nq[res].push_back(u);\n\nBut also, since the code is trying to find the minimal days, perhaps we need to check if the current res is better than any previous calculation. \n\nWait, but the code's visited array is only set when the node is processed. So when we add u to q[res], even if it's already in a queue for a smaller day, it won't be processed again. \n\nWait, the code's visited array is set to true only when the node is taken out of the queue (i.e., when processing q[i], for each s in q[i], we set vis[s] =1). \n\nTherefore, if u is added to q[res], and res is smaller than some other possible day, then when the code processes q[res], it will process u and set its ans to res, which is better. \n\nTherefore, the correct code inside the if block is to push u into q[res]. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nq[res].push_back(u);\n\nAdditionally, perhaps we need to check if u is already in a queue with a smaller day. But since the queues are processed in order, once a node is processed (marked as visited), it won't be processed again. \n\nTherefore, the code should have that line. \n\nAnother thing to check: the loop is written as for(ll i=0; i<m+1; i++), which is equivalent to for (i from 0 to m inclusive). Because m+1 is the upper limit, but the loop runs while i < m+1. \n\nWait, the loop is written as for(ll i=0; i<m+1; i++), so it runs from 0 to m. \n\nBut the code's q is declared as vector<ll> q[m+1]; which is an array of m+1 vectors. So the indices go up to m. \n\nTherefore, the res must be <= m. \n\nHence, the code's if condition is correct. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code is to push u into q[res]. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the TODO block should be:\n\nq[res].push_back(u);\n\nWait, but also, the code is inside the loop over the parents. So for each parent u of s, we compute res, and if it's within the limit, add u to q[res]. \n\nTherefore, the correct code is to add that line. \n\nAnother thing to check: the code's initial setup. The queue q[0] starts with n. So ans[n] will be 0, which is correct because you're already at n. \n\nThen, processing nodes in order. \n\nSo the missing code is indeed the push_back. \n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill in the TODO with q[res].push_back(u); \n\nWait, but the code also has child[u]-- after the if statement. \n\nWait, the code's line after the if is child[u]--; \n\nSo the code is:\n\nfor (auto u : par[s]) {\n    if (vis[u]) continue;\n    res = i + (child[u]-1) +1;\n    if (res < m+1) {\n        q[res].push_back(u);\n    }\n    child[u]--;\n}\n\nWait, but why is the child[u]-- outside the if? \n\nHmm, perhaps the child[u]-- is done regardless of whether the res is valid. \n\nThe comment says that this is to avoid considering this path again. \n\nWait, the child[u] is the number of outgoing edges. Each time we process a parent u through one of its children s, we are considering that the edge to s is kept. So the next time another child of u is processed, the child[u] is decremented so that the count of edges to block is adjusted. \n\nWait, but the child[u] is being decremented each time we process a parent u (i.e., for each s in par[s], which is the children of u). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track how many edges are left to block. \n\nWait, the child[u] starts as the number of outgoing edges. \n\nEach time we process a parent u via one of its children s, we subtract 1 from child[u], because that edge to s is not blocked (so it's part of the path). \n\nTherefore, when processing another child s', the remaining edges to block would be (child[u] -1) (since we have already accounted for the edge to s). \n\nWait, but the code subtracts 1 each time, so after processing the first s, child[u] becomes original -1. \n\nThen, when processing the next s', the calculation for res would be i + ( (child[u] -1) +1 ), but since child[u] is now original-1, the calculation would be i + ( (original-1 -1) +1 ) = i + (original-1). \n\nHmm, but that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the child[u] is being used to track the number of edges that can be blocked. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's logic is that each time you process a parent u through a child s, you are considering that the edge to s is kept, so you have to block the other edges. The number of edges to block is (child[u] -1). \n\nBut once you process this, you subtract 1 from child[u], so that next time you process another child s', the count is (child[u] -1) again (but now child[u] is original-1, so it's (original-2)), which would be the number of edges to block excluding both s and s'. \n\nWait, but that would mean that each time you process a parent through a child, you are considering that edge as part of the path, so you have to block all others. \n\nBut if you process multiple children, that would imply that multiple edges are kept, which is not possible because you can only choose one path. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is designed to find the minimal days by considering all possible paths and choosing the best one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct as is, and the child[u]-- is necessary to track the number of edges that can be blocked. \n\nIn any case, the problem is to fill in the missing code, which is the line inside the if statement. \n\nTherefore, the correct code to add is q[res].push_back(u); \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nq[res].push_back(u);\n\nHence, the answer is that line."
