Let me think of the problem differently. Each operation can be thought of as adding 1 to all odd indices (operation 1) or even indices (operation 2). Each operation can be done any number of times. We need to see if after some combination of these operations, all elements have the same parity. Let me think in terms of parity changes. Let's model the problem modulo 2. Each element's parity can be adjusted by the number of times we perform the operations that affect it. For example, for an element at an odd index (problem's terms, which is code's even indices): Each time we do operation 1 (add 1 to odd indices), this element's parity flips. Similarly, operation 2 doesn't affect it. For an element at even index (problem's terms, code's odd indices):\n\nEach time we do operation 2, its parity flips. Operation 1 doesn't affect it. So, for each element, the total number of flips (mod 2) must be such that all elements end up with the same parity.

For odd indices in code (i odd \u2192 problem's even indices):\n\n- if a is odd \u2192 oo +=1 (so oo is count of odd numbers in problem's even indices).\n\n- else \u2192 oe +=1 (count of even numbers in problem's even indices). So the conditions for the two groups (problem's odd and even indices) to have all same parity are: For problem's odd indices (code's even indices):\n\nEither all even (so eo ==0) or all odd (ee ==0). Similarly for problem's even indices (code's odd indices): Either all odd (oe ==0) or all even (oo ==0). So the code's current conditions are:\n\nif (oe ! =0 && oo ! =0) \u2192 meaning, in problem's even indices (code's odd indices), there are both even (oe) and odd (oo) elements \u2192 so they are not all same \u2192 condition fails \u2192 output NO. Similarly, the second condition is (eo !=0 && ee ! =0) \u2192 meaning in problem's odd indices (code's even indices), there are both even and odd \u2192 so condition fails \u2192 output NO. Else, output YES. Yes! That's exactly the conditions I derived. So the code is correct in that logic. Therefore, the missing code in the else block (for odd indices) is:\n\nif (a%2 ==1) { oo++; } else { oe++; } So the code in the else block (when i is odd) should check if a is odd or even and update oo or oe accordingly. So the missing code is:\n\nif(a%2==1) oo++;\nelse oe++;\n\nSo that's what needs to be filled in the else block. Now, let me check the code's existing conditions. The code's first condition is:\n\nif (oe !=0 && oo ! =0) \u2192 which is exactly when the even indices (problem's even indices) have both even and odd elements \u2192 so they can't all be same \u2192 so output NO. The second condition is (eo !=0 && ee ! =0) \u2192 which is when the problem's odd indices (code's even indices) have both even and odd \u2192 so output NO. Else, output YES. Yes, that's exactly the conditions I thought of. So the code is correct once the missing part is filled.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to determine if, after any number of operations (adding 1 to all odd indices or all even indices), the array can have all elements even or all odd.\n\nHmm, the code provided has some variables like ee, eo, oo, oe. Let me see what they might represent. Looking at the code inside the loop:\n\nFor each element, if the index i is even (since i starts at 0?), then they check if a is even or odd. So for even indices, ee counts even numbers, eo counts odd. Then for the else part (odd indices), they need to do similar, but the variables are probably oo and oe. Wait, the variables are named maybe as even-odd, odd-even, etc. Let me think:\n\nMaybe ee is the count of even numbers at even indices, eo is odd numbers at even indices. Then for the odd indices (i%2 !=0), we need to track how many are odd or even. So for those, perhaps oo is the count of odd numbers at odd indices, and oe is even numbers at odd indices? Or maybe the variables are structured differently. The code currently has ee, eo, oo, oe, but the odd part's code is missing.\n\nLooking at the existing code's conditions: \n\nThe final if statements check if (oe !=0 && oo !=0) or (eo !=0 && ee !=0), then print NO else YES. Wait, maybe the variables are set up such that:\n\n- For even indices (i even), we track how many are even (ee) and odd (eo).\n\n- For odd indices (i odd), we track how many are odd (oo) and even (oe). Because maybe 'oe' is even at odd indices? Like, maybe the variables are:\n\nee: even at even indices\n\neo: odd at even indices\n\noo: odd at odd indices\n\noe: even at odd indices?\n\nWait, the code's variables are declared as ee, eo, oo, oe. So perhaps:\n\n- For even indices (i even):\n\n   if a is even \u2192 ee +=1\n\n   else \u2192 eo +=1\n\n- For odd indices (i odd):\n\n   if a is odd \u2192 oo +=1\n\n   else \u2192 oe +=1 ?\n\nThen, the variables would track counts for each category.\n\nThe current code's else block (for odd indices) is missing. So in the else part (when i is odd), we need to check if the number is odd or even and update oo and oe accordingly.\n\nSo the missing code in the else block should be:\n\nif (a % 2 == 1) { oo++; } else { oe++; }\n\nSo that's the first part to fill in.\n\nNow, the next part is understanding why the conditions in the if-else at the end would determine the answer. Let's think about the problem again.\n\nThe operations allowed are adding 1 to all odd indices (so positions 1,3,5 etc. if 1-based, but in code here, since the loop uses i starting at 0, maybe 0-based. Wait, the problem says \"odd index\" and \"even index\"\u2014 but the problem's indices are 1-based? Because in the problem statement, a_1 is the first element. So in code, when the array is 0-based, the first element (i=0) is considered an odd index (since 1 is odd). Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the problem's first element is a_1, which is index 1 in 1-based, but in code, the array is 0-based. So in the code, when i is 0 (the first element), that's the first element (a_1), which is an odd index (1 is odd). So in the code, the check for even indices (i%2 ==0) would correspond to even positions in 1-based terms? Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose the array is 0-based in code. The problem's indices are 1-based. So for the code's i:\n\ni=0 \u2192 corresponds to a_1 (odd index in problem's terms)\n\ni=1 \u2192 a_2 (even index)\n\ni=2 \u2192 a_3 (odd), etc.\n\nSo in the code, when the problem says \"odd index\", that's when (i%2 ==0) in code (since i=0 is first element, which is odd index). Wait, yes. Because for code's i, the 1-based index is i+1. So the problem's odd indices (1,3,5...) correspond to code's i even (0,2,4...). So the code's current setup is correct: for even indices (i even in code) \u2192 problem's odd indices? Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, problem's first element is a_1 (index 1, odd). In code, that's i=0 (even index in code's terms). So the code's even indices (i even) correspond to the problem's odd indices. So when the problem says \"add 1 to every element with an odd index\", that corresponds to the code's even indices (i even). Similarly, the even indices in problem (a_2, a_4 etc.) are code's i odd (since i=1 is a_2, which is even index in problem's terms).\n\nSo the code's current setup is correct. The variables ee and eo track even and odd counts for the problem's odd indices (code's even indices). The variables oo and oe would track the problem's even indices (code's odd indices). Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIn the code, for i even (code's even indices, which are problem's odd indices):\n\n- if a is even \u2192 ee (even count for problem's odd indices) increases.\n\n- if a is odd \u2192 eo (odd count for problem's odd indices) increases.\n\nThen, for the else part (i is odd, which is problem's even indices):\n\n- if a is odd \u2192 oo (odd count for problem's even indices) increases.\n\n- else \u2192 oe (even count for problem's even indices) increases.\n\nWait, the variables oo and oe are for the problem's even indices (since i is odd in code). So oo is the count of odd numbers in problem's even indices, and oe is even numbers there.\n\nNow, the code's final condition is:\n\nif (oe !=0 && oo !=0) \u2192 meaning, in problem's even indices, there are both even and odd numbers?\n\nWait, no. Let me see the code's condition:\n\nThe first condition is if (oe !=0 && oo !=0). So, if there are any even elements (oe) and any odd elements (oo) in the problem's even indices (since those are tracked by oe and oo), then output NO?\n\nHmm, perhaps the logic here is that for the array to be all even or all odd, certain conditions must be met. Let me think of the problem differently.\n\nEach operation can be thought of as adding 1 to all odd indices (operation 1) or even indices (operation 2). Each operation can be done any number of times. We need to see if after some combination of these operations, all elements have the same parity.\n\nLet me think in terms of parity changes. Let's model the problem modulo 2.\n\nEach element's parity can be adjusted by the number of times we perform the operations that affect it.\n\nFor example, for an element at an odd index (problem's terms, which is code's even indices):\n\nEach time we do operation 1 (add 1 to odd indices), this element's parity flips. Similarly, operation 2 doesn't affect it.\n\nFor an element at even index (problem's terms, code's odd indices):\n\nEach time we do operation 2, its parity flips. Operation 1 doesn't affect it.\n\nSo, for each element, the total number of flips (mod 2) must be such that all elements end up with the same parity.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet x be the number of times we perform operation 1 (add to odd indices).\n\nLet y be the number of times we perform operation 2 (add to even indices).\n\nFor each element at an odd index (problem's terms), the number of flips is x (since each operation 1 adds 1, flipping parity each time).\n\nFor each element at even index (problem's terms), the number of flips is y.\n\nWe need all elements to have the same parity. Let's consider their initial parity plus x (for odd indices) or y (for even indices) mod 2 must be equal for all elements.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor an element at an odd index (initial parity a_i %2):\n\nFinal parity: (a_i + x) mod 2.\n\nFor an element at even index (initial parity b_j %2):\n\nFinal parity: (b_j + y) mod 2.\n\nWe need all (a_i +x) mod2 equal to each other and equal to (b_j + y) mod2 for all i,j.\n\nSo, all (a_i +x) mod2 must be the same, and all (b_j + y) mod2 must be the same, and also the two groups must have the same parity.\n\nAlternatively, the parity of all elements must be the same, so:\n\nFor all odd indices (a_i +x) mod2 must be equal to each other, and equal to (b_j + y) mod2 for all even indices.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that all elements must have the same parity. So, for all elements, their (initial parity + their flip count) mod2 must be equal.\n\nLet me consider that all elements must end up with the same parity, say P (either 0 or 1). So for each element:\n\n(a_i + flips_i) mod2 = P.\n\nThe flips_i depends on the position:\n\nFor odd indices (problem's terms, so code's even indices):\n\nflips_i = x.\n\nFor even indices (problem's terms, code's odd indices):\n\nflips_i = y.\n\nSo for all odd indices (i):\n\n(a_i + x) mod2 = P.\n\nFor all even indices (j):\n\n(b_j + y) mod2 = P.\n\nWe can rearrange these equations:\n\nx \u2261 (P - a_i) mod2 for all odd indices.\n\ny \u2261 (P - b_j) mod2 for all even indices.\n\nSo, for all odd indices, (P - a_i) mod2 must be the same (since x is a single variable). Similarly for even indices, (P - b_j) mod2 must be the same (since y is a single variable).\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n\n1. For all odd indices, (a_i mod2) must be the same when subtracted from P. So all a_i mod2 must be equal to each other mod2. Because (P - a_i) mod2 must be same for all i. Let me see:\n\nSuppose all a_i mod2 are the same. Let's say they are all c. Then (P - c) mod2 must be the same for all, so x is fixed as (P -c) mod2. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but even if they are not all the same, maybe there's a P where the differences can be adjusted via x and y?\n\nWait, let's think again. For all odd indices, (a_i +x) mod2 must be equal to P. So for two different odd indices i and k:\n\n(a_i +x) mod2 = (a_k +x) mod2 \u2192 (a_i - a_k) mod2 =0 \u2192 a_i and a_k must have the same parity. So all a_i (the elements at odd indices) must have the same parity. Similarly, all elements at even indices must have the same parity.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because for the x to exist such that (a_i +x) mod2 is the same for all odd indices, the a_i's must all have the same parity. Otherwise, you can't choose an x that makes them all equal. For example, if some a_i is even and another is odd, then (even +x) mod2 and (odd +x) mod2 would differ, so they can't be equal. So the first condition is that all elements in the odd indices must have the same parity, and all elements in even indices must have the same parity.\n\nIf that's not the case, then it's impossible. So first check: are all the odd indices' elements of the same parity? And same for even indices?\n\nWait, but even if that's true, then we can proceed. Let me see.\n\nSuppose all odd indices have parity c (all same), and even indices have parity d (all same). Then, we can choose x and y such that:\n\nFor the odd indices: (c +x) mod2 = P.\n\nFor even indices: (d + y) mod2 = P.\n\nWe need to choose x and y such that both equations hold, and P can be either 0 or 1.\n\nSo, for example, if we want P to be 0:\n\nThen x must be (0 - c) mod2 \u2192 x = (-c) mod2 \u2192 which is (1 -c) if c is 1, etc.\n\nSimilarly, y must be (0 -d) mod2.\n\nAlternatively, for P=1, x must be (1 -c) mod2, y must be (1 -d) mod2.\n\nSo, the question is whether there exists a P (either 0 or 1) such that:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1 (P=0):\n\nx \u2261 (-c) mod2,\n\ny \u2261 (-d) mod2.\n\nOR\n\nCase 2 (P=1):\n\nx \u2261 (1 -c) mod2,\n\ny \u2261 (1 -d) mod2.\n\nBut x and y can be any non-negative integers (since you can perform the operations any number of times). Since we're working mod2, x can be 0 or 1 mod2. So the key is whether the required x and y for either case are possible (i.e., their parities can be set).\n\nWait, but x and y can be any integers, so their parity can be chosen freely. So for any required parity of x and y, it's possible. So the only constraints are that the required x and y parities must be compatible.\n\nWait, the required x and y must satisfy the equations for some P. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the odd indices have parity c (all same), even indices have parity d (all same). Then, for some P, we need:\n\n(c +x) mod2 = P,\n\n(d + y) mod2 = P.\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\nx mod2 = (P - c) mod2,\n\ny mod2 = (P -d) mod2.\n\nWe can choose x and y to have any parities. So, for some P, the required x and y parities must be possible. Let's see:\n\nWe can choose P as either 0 or 1. Let's check both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: P=0.\n\nThen x must be (0 -c) mod2 \u2192 ( -c mod2 \u2192 (2 -c) mod2 \u2192 (1 -c) if c is 1, etc. So x's parity is (0 -c) mod2.\n\nSimilarly, y must be (0 -d) mod2.\n\nThese are possible, but the question is whether the required x and y parities can be set. Since x and y can be any integers, their parities can be set as needed. So the only constraint is that the equations must be compatible. Wait, but since we can choose P, perhaps there's a P where the required x and y parities are possible.\n\nWait, the problem is that x and y can be any integers, so their parities can be set to any required values. So for any P, the required x and y parities can be achieved. So the only constraints are that the equations can be satisfied for some P.\n\nWait, but the equations for P must be consistent. Let me see:\n\nSuppose for P=0, the required x and y parities are x_parity and y_parity. Then, for P=1, the required x_parity would be (1 -c) mod2, and y_parity (1 -d) mod2.\n\nSo, the question is whether there exists a P (0 or 1) such that the required x and y parities can be set. Since x and y can be any integers, their parities can be set to any required values. So the only thing we need is that for some P, the required x and y parities are possible. But since x and y can be any integers, their parities can be set to any required values. So the only constraint is that the equations for P must be possible. Wait, but the equations are automatically possible because x and y can be chosen to have any parities. So the only constraints are that the equations can be satisfied for some P. Let me see:\n\nWait, the equations are:\n\nFor some P, (c +x) mod2 = P,\n\nand (d + y) mod2 = P.\n\nSo, substituting, (c +x) mod2 must equal (d + y) mod2. But since x and y can be chosen freely, this can be arranged. Wait, but the problem is that x and y are the same variables for all elements. So the required x and y must satisfy both equations for the same P.\n\nWait, the equations are:\n\nx \u2261 (P - c) mod2,\n\ny \u2261 (P -d) mod2.\n\nThese two equations must hold for the same P. So, for some P (0 or 1), these two congruences must be possible. Since P can be chosen, we can pick P such that the required x and y parities are compatible. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose we choose P such that (P -c) mod2 and (P -d) mod2 can be any values. But the key is that for some P, the required x and y parities can be set. Since x and y can be any integers, their parities can be set to any required values. So the only constraint is that the two equations (for x and y) must be compatible for some P.\n\nWait, but the equations are linked via P. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we pick P = (c + x) mod2. Then, the first equation is satisfied. Then, the second equation requires that (d + y) mod2 = P \u2192 y mod2 = (P -d) mod2. Since P is determined by x's parity, but x can be chosen to set P to any value. Wait, perhaps the problem reduces to whether (c - d) mod2 can be adjusted via the choice of P and the x and y parities.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the two equations:\n\n(c +x) mod2 = (d + y) mod2.\n\nBecause both must equal P. So rearranged:\n\n(c -d) mod2 = (y -x) mod2.\n\nBut since x and y can be any integers, their difference can be any parity. So this equation can always be satisfied. Therefore, as long as the initial conditions (all odd indices have same parity, all even indices have same parity), then it is possible.\n\nWait, so the only necessary conditions are:\n\n1. All elements at odd indices (problem's terms) have the same parity.\n\n2. All elements at even indices (problem's terms) have the same parity.\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then it is possible. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nBecause if those two conditions are met, then we can choose x and y such that the parities can be made equal.\n\nWait, let me test with examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the first test case is [1,2,1]. Let's see:\n\nIndices (problem's terms):\n\na_1 (odd index) is 1 (odd).\n\na_2 (even index) is 2 (even).\n\na_3 (odd index) is 1 (odd).\n\nSo the odd indices (positions 1 and 3) have parities odd and odd \u2192 same.\n\nEven indices (position 2) has even \u2192 same.\n\nSo conditions 1 and 2 are met. So possible \u2192 YES.\n\nAnother sample where it's NO: suppose the array has elements like [1, 2, 3, 4]. The odd indices (1,3) are 1 (odd) and 3 (odd) \u2192 same. Even indices (2,4) are 2 (even) and 4 (even) \u2192 same. So possible. Wait but the second test case in the note is output NO. Wait, perhaps I need to look at the note's examples.\n\nThe note says for the second test case, the answer is NO. Let me think of what that test case might be. Suppose the array has elements where the odd indices have mixed parities. For example, [1,2,3]. Then the odd indices (1 and 3) are both odd \u2192 okay. Even index (2) is even. So that would be possible. Hmm, maybe the second test case is like [1,3,2]. Then the odd indices (1 and 3) are 1 (odd) and 2 (even). So their parities are different \u2192 condition 1 not met \u2192 answer NO. That would fit the note's second case.\n\nSo the key is that the two conditions (all odd indices same parity, all even indices same parity) must hold. If they do, then it's possible. Otherwise, no.\n\nSo the code's current logic must be checking these conditions. Let's see the code's variables:\n\nThe code has variables:\n\nee: count of even numbers at even indices (problem's odd indices).\n\neo: count of odd numbers at even indices (problem's odd indices).\n\noo: count of odd numbers at odd indices (problem's even indices).\n\noe: count of even numbers at odd indices (problem's even indices).\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nFor even indices in code (i even \u2192 problem's odd indices):\n\n- ee counts even numbers here.\n\n- eo counts odd numbers here.\n\nFor odd indices in code (i odd \u2192 problem's even indices):\n\n- if a is odd \u2192 oo +=1 (so oo is count of odd numbers in problem's even indices).\n\n- else \u2192 oe +=1 (count of even numbers in problem's even indices).\n\nSo the conditions for the two groups (problem's odd and even indices) to have all same parity are:\n\nFor problem's odd indices (code's even indices):\n\nEither all even (so eo ==0) or all odd (ee ==0).\n\nSimilarly for problem's even indices (code's odd indices):\n\nEither all odd (oe ==0) or all even (oo ==0).\n\nSo the code's current conditions are:\n\nif (oe !=0 && oo !=0) \u2192 meaning, in problem's even indices (code's odd indices), there are both even (oe) and odd (oo) elements \u2192 so they are not all same \u2192 condition fails \u2192 output NO.\n\nSimilarly, the second condition is (eo !=0 && ee !=0) \u2192 meaning in problem's odd indices (code's even indices), there are both even and odd \u2192 so condition fails \u2192 output NO.\n\nElse, output YES.\n\nYes! That's exactly the conditions I derived. So the code is correct in that logic.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the else block (for odd indices) is:\n\nif (a%2 ==1) { oo++; } else { oe++; }\n\nSo the code in the else block (when i is odd) should check if a is odd or even and update oo or oe accordingly.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nif(a%2==1) oo++;\nelse oe++;\n\nSo that's what needs to be filled in the else block.\n\nNow, let me check the code's existing conditions. The code's first condition is:\n\nif (oe !=0 && oo !=0) \u2192 which is exactly when the even indices (problem's even indices) have both even and odd elements \u2192 so they can't all be same \u2192 so output NO.\n\nThe second condition is (eo !=0 && ee !=0) \u2192 which is when the problem's odd indices (code's even indices) have both even and odd \u2192 so output NO.\n\nElse, output YES.\n\nYes, that's exactly the conditions I thought of. So the code is correct once the missing part is filled.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the part in the else block for handling the odd indices (i is odd) and updating oo and oe."
