The first loop is over i (rows) and j (columns). The inner loop for j goes from 0 to m-1. The TODO is there. Then, if j < m, break, so it breaks the outer i loop once any row has a j where maybe some condition isn't met. Wait the loop is:\n\nfor(i=0;i<n;i++){\n    for(j=0;j<m;j++){\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n    if(j<m)\n        break;\n} So the inner loop for j runs from 0 to m-1, but when does it break early?",

So any move causes explosion. Hence answer is NO. So the problem is to ensure that the sequence of moves leading to one robot reaching (0,0) doesn't require that any other robot moves outside during the steps. So perhaps the approach is to find for each robot, if it can reach (0,0) in some way without any other robot being forced to move outside during that process. How to model this? Let me think of all robots' positions.",

At least one robot reaches (0,0). The problem is to determine if such a path exists for any robot. To find this without explicitly checking all paths, perhaps we can find a condition that must be satisfied. Let me consider the required steps for the robot to reach (0,0). Suppose the robot is at (a, b). To reach (0,0) it must move up a times and left b times. The order of these moves can be arbitrary. For example, the sequence could be 'up' repeated a times, then 'left' repeated b times. Or some interleaving. In any case, during the steps, the robot must move up, and all other robots must not step out. Let me think of the necessary conditions for other robots:\n\nSuppose another robot is at (x,y). When we move up, its row decreases by 1, so as long as x- steps taken in up direction >=0. Similarly for other directions.",

But the minimum row of all robots is the smallest row among all robots. For example, if any robot is in row 0, then the minimum row is 0. Thus, the chosen robot must have a row <=0 (i.e., row 0). Similarly, if any robot has column 0, then the minimum column is 0, the chosen robot must have b <=0 \u2192 column 0. Thus, the choosen robot must be in row 0 (since otherwise the minimum row would be less than a, so a can't be <= min_row). Similarly, the chosen robot must be in column 0. Or, alternatively, the only possible robot that can be chosen is one that is in row 0 and column 0. Wait, that would only allow the robot already at (0,0) to be chosen, which is only possible if they're already there. That can't be, because the first example has a robot at (0,1), and the answer is YES. Hmm, this suggests my reasoning is incorrect. Let me think again. Suppose the first example has only one robot at (0,1). The minimum row among all robots is 0, \n\nthe minimum column is 1 (since there's only one robot). So the desired robot is at a=0, b=1. Thus: \n\na=0 \u2264 min_row (0) \u2192 ok \n\n b=1 \u2264 min_col (1) \u2192 ok \n\n Thus it is allowed. So the total up moves needed are 0 (a=0), which is allowed.

Ah, the second test case must have two robots in such a way that any move causes a robot to explode. Perhaps the two robots are at (0,0) and (0,1). If you send a command to move left, the first robot moves to -1 column (explodes). If you send move right, the second robot moves to column 2 (if m is 2, then it's okay? Or perhaps the second test case has m=1?",

But all other robots must also move such that during each step, they don't fall out. Wait but the robot must move in directions that can be chosen in any order. So, for example, the sequence of moves could be a mix of directions, not just all lefts followed by all ups. Hmm.",

The first loop breaks when for some row i, the inner loop breaks early (j < m). Then, the code increments i and checks the subsequent rows to see if any of them have a robot in the first j columns. If any do, then i will be less than n, and the answer is NO. Otherwise, it's YES. So the first loop finds a row i and column j such that in row i, there's some condition that breaks the inner loop.",

This would imply that all robots are to the right of previous rows' robots. Thus, when moving left, they won't have to move past the earlier row's robots. Hmm, but how does this help in reaching the top-left corner? Perhaps if the first robot in each row is non-decreasing, then the leftmost robot in the first row can be moved left. For example, in the first row, the first robot is at column j0. To move left, you have to move all robots in that row to the left of j0 would have to be empty. Not sure.

The first empty cell is at column 0. The first loop breaks at row 0 and j=0. The second loop checks rows above row 0? No, the second loop starts from i=1. Wait no, the first loop breaks when j < m (which is true here, since the first cell is empty and the inner loop broke at j=0). Thus, the first loop breaks, and the code increments i to 1. Then the second loop runs for i=1 to n-1. For each row i (starting at 1), check whether any cell in columns less than j (which is 0) have a robot. Since columns less than j=0 are none, this loop will not find any. Thus, i will remain equal to n (if there are no more rows), so output YES. This fits the first test case's answer of YES. In the second test case where robots are at (0,1) and (1,0): \n\n The first row has cells E and R (assuming m=2). The first empty cell is at column 0. So the first loop breaks at row 0, j=0. The code increments i to 1. The second loop checks row 1. The columns to check are less than j=0 (none), so no issue. Thus, the answer would be YES, but the actual answer is NO. Thus this approach is incorrect. Hmm. This is frustrating. Perhaps I should try to think of the code's approach and see what the missing part must be. The first loop is for each row from top to bottom. For each row, the inner loop runs from j=0 to m-1. The TODO is likely checking whether the cell is a robot.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this code so that it correctly determines whether at least one robot can reach the top-left corner without any explosions. Let me start by understanding the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that all robots move simultaneously based on the command. If any robot would move outside the field, it explodes, and that's not allowed. The goal is to have at least one robot reach the top-left corner (which is position (0,0) in the grid) without any explosions happening along the way.\n\nHmm, the code provided has some loops and checks, but the inner part is missing. Let's look at the existing code structure. \n\nLooking at the loops:\n\nThe outer loop is for each test case. Then they read n and m, and the grid into 'arr'. Then there's a loop over i from 0 to n-1, and j from 0 to m-1, where the TODO is. Then, after that loop, there's another loop starting from i incremented and checking other conditions. The final output is YES or NO based on whether i reached n.\n\nWait, the code's logic is a bit unclear. Maybe the idea is to track some positions where robots can be allowed to move without causing explosions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to check for a certain condition where robots can be moved such that their paths don't conflict and at least one can reach (0,0).\n\nLet me think of possible approaches. \n\nThe key point is that all robots must move in the same direction each step, but the commands can be chosen in any sequence. We need to find if there's a sequence of commands (directions) such that after some steps, at least one robot is at (0,0), and during all steps, no robot moves out of bounds.\n\nAn alternative approach might be to model this as a state transition problem. Each robot's position must be tracked, but since n and m are up to 5, maybe we can represent the possible positions of all robots and see if any path leads to the desired cell. However, that might be computationally intensive for 5000 test cases, but since n and m are small (<=5), perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think of the constraints:\n\nFor a robot to reach the top-left corner (0,0) without exploding, it must be that in some sequence of moves, it can step into (0,0) without any step causing it to go out of bounds, and other robots also don't go out in those steps.\n\nWait, but all robots move each time. So, for each move direction, all robots move in that direction. So, each command is a direction chosen, and all robots move in that direction. So each step, the robots' positions change.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"you can send as many commands as you want, in any order. Each command is a direction, and all robots move that direction at once.\"\n\nSo the problem reduces to: can there exist a sequence of directions (like a list of directions to move), such that after applying each direction in sequence, all robots stay within the grid, and at least one robot reaches (0,0) at some point (could be after the first command, or any subsequent steps).\n\nHmm. So the question is whether there's a path of moves where, in some step, a robot is at (0,0) and all the moves leading up to that step didn't cause any robot to go off the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution can be found by checking for each robot whether there exists a path of movement that allows it to reach (0,0) without any step causing it or any other robot to go out of the grid.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key insight is that in order for a robot to reach the top-left corner, all robots must be able to reach that position through certain movements, but also their paths don't cause them to go out of the grid in any step.\n\nWait, another thought: the robot must reach (0,0) on their own path, but during their movement, whenever they move into a direction that could take them off the grid, that's a problem. So, for each robot's path, when moving, they can't go beyond.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nFor a robot to reach (0,0), it must be that in some direction sequence, it moves into (0,0) and all robots during all steps are within the grid.\n\nBut considering all possible paths is too much. Since the number of possible directions per step is 4 and the robots can move in steps any number of times, it's hard to track.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the positions of the robots as a set, and each command moves all of them in the same direction. We can model the possible positions after each command, and check if any of those positions includes (0,0).\n\nBut even so, the state space could be too big for n and m up to 5, but with limited robots (since each cell can have at most one robot?), or perhaps multiple robots can be on the same cell? Wait, the problem says that each cell is either E or R. So each cell can have at most one robot. So the total number of robots is up to n*m, which for 5x5 is 25. But if all are robots, that's 25 robots, which would make the state space huge.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the necessary conditions for a robot to reach (0,0) without any explosions.\n\nWait, let me think of the constraints for a robot to reach (0,0):\n\nSuppose a robot starts at (x, y). To reach (0,0), it must have a path where:\n\nEach step moves in some direction, but never goes out of bounds.\n\nIn particular, for it to reach (0,0), all steps must keep it within the grid. So, for example, in the direction towards (0,0), the robot needs to have enough steps in that direction. Like, for a robot in row x, to reach row 0, it can only move up (or stay in place if already there). Similarly for the column.\n\nWait, but moving in directions other than towards (0,0) can also be part of the path. However, all moves must be such that during every step, all robots are within the grid.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to look for any robot that can reach (0,0) by moving in directions that don't cause any robot to go out of the grid. So the robot's path must be such that in every step, after moving, they all are within the grid.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nThere must exist a set of movement commands (a sequence of directions) such that after applying all of them, at least one robot is at (0,0), and during all steps (including intermediate steps), no robot moves out of the grid.\n\nBut how do we check this? \n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that for a robot to reach (0,0) without any explosions, it must be possible that in some command sequence, the robot can move into (0,0), and in all steps prior to that, all robots are within the grid. \n\nPerhaps the minimal condition is that for each robot, the robot must be able to move in a way that doesn't require going beyond the grid's boundaries when moving towards (0,0).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of it in terms of the robots' coordinates. Let me think of each robot's position as (x_i, y_i). To reach (0,0), each robot can have a path. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that there exists a robot such that:\n\nThe robot can be moved to (0,0) through some sequence of commands where in each command direction, all robots are still within the grid during that move.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that in the final step, when the robot reaches (0,0), the movement must have been a left or up move (assuming that to get to (0,0), the last step had to come from either left or up). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to see that for all robots except the one moving to (0,0), their paths must not go out. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the code given. The code has loops that check the positions of robots. Maybe the code is trying to check for some conditions related to the leftmost and topmost robot.\n\nLooking at the existing code's loops. Let me try to understand what the code is trying to do.\n\nThe code first reads the grid, then loops over the rows and columns, but inside the TODO. Then, there's a for loop over i and j. The next part after the loops: after the first loop, if j < m, break, then i is incremented and another loop checks other rows. The final condition is whether i reached n, outputting YES/NO accordingly.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the leftmost and topmost positions? Let me look at the code again.\n\nThe first loop is over i (rows) and j (columns). The inner loop for j goes from 0 to m-1. The TODO is there. Then, if j < m, break, so it breaks the outer i loop once any row has a j where maybe some condition isn't met.\n\nWait the loop is:\n\nfor(i=0;i<n;i++){\n    for(j=0;j<m;j++){\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n    if(j<m)\n        break;\n}\n\nSo the inner loop for j runs from 0 to m-1, but when does it break early? The TODO is missing, so perhaps the TODO is a condition that checks for something, and if it's not met, breaks the inner loop, thereby causing the outer loop to break as well.\n\nThe code then increments i and enters another loop, which might be checking something else. \n\nAfter that, the output is based on whether i is still less than n (then output NO) else YES.\n\nHmm. \n\nThe existing code's structure suggests that if any row (i) has a position (j) where a certain condition is not met, then the first loop breaks, and the code proceeds to check the remaining rows.\n\nThe second part after incrementing i (so i is now the first row where the first loop broke) and then loops over the remaining rows (starting from i) to check their columns up to j (from the first loop's j variable?).\n\nThe final check is whether any of those remaining rows have a robot in the first j columns. If yes, output NO, else YES.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find a certain \"bounding\" box or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the rightmost robot in each row and check that they form a non-increasing sequence towards the top.\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that in order for all robots to be able to move to (0,0) without exploding, the robots must be arranged in such a way that in each row above the robot's starting row, the robots in that row are to the left of the robot's current column.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's note examples. \n\nSuppose that for a robot to reach the top-left corner, all robots to its left and above must not block its path. Or maybe, in the first loop, the code is trying to find the rightmost robot in each row and ensure that these rightmost positions do not increase as we go down.\n\nWait, here's an idea from similar problems: the robots must form a non-increasing sequence of their rightmost positions as you go down the rows. \n\nFor example, if in row 0, the rightmost robot is at column 3, then in row 1, the rightmost robot can't be at column 4 or more. Otherwise, moving left won't work because when moving left, the robot in row 1, column 4 would go to 3, but that's okay. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the rightmost robot in each row must not be to the right of the robot above.\n\nWait, perhaps the key idea is that in order for all robots to be able to reach the top-left corner, their rightmost columns must be non-increasing as you go down each row. Similarly, their bottom rows must not be below such that moving up can bring them to the top.\n\nWait, let me think of the first sample input where the answer is YES. For example, in the first test case:\n\nSuppose the grid has a robot at (0,1). The command is to move left, so it goes to (0,0). So that's acceptable. \n\nIn the second test case, where perhaps the robot is in a position where moving left would cause another robot to go out? Like maybe robots at (0,0) and (0,1), then moving left would make the first robot go to -1 column, which explodes. So that's why it can't. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach seems to be checking for the rightmost positions of each row. \n\nLet me think of the code's structure again.\n\nSuppose, the first loop is for each row i, and for each column j in that row. The code checks for something here. The inner loop breaks when a certain condition isn't met. \n\nThe code's first loop breaks when, for some row i, the inner j loop ended early (because of a break). \n\nThen, the code increments i (the first row where the condition failed) and checks the subsequent rows (starting from i) to see if any of them have a robot in the columns up to j (the j where the inner loop broke in the first loop).\n\nWait, perhaps the code is checking for the rightmost robot in each row, and ensures that in the rows below, the robots are not to the right of that position.\n\nWait here's a possible explanation:\n\nThe first part of the code (the first loop) tries to find the rightmost robot in each row, ensuring that they form a non-increasing sequence as we go down the rows. \n\nFor example:\n\nIn the first loop, for each row i, we find the rightmost robot (or the maximum j where there's a robot in that row). Let's call this \"current rightmost\".\n\nThen, we check if in the next rows, their rightmost robots are no larger than the current one. \n\nWait, the code's logic might be:\n\n- The first loop goes through each row and for each row, tracks the rightmost robot. \n\n- Suppose for each row i, the rightmost position is j. Then, in the next rows (i+1, etc.), their rightmost positions must be <= j. \n\nBut how is this implemented?\n\nAlternatively, the code's first loop for each row i is processing columns from left to right (j from 0 to m-1). The TODO could be checking if there's a robot in the current cell, and tracking the rightmost position for each row.\n\nWait perhaps the code is trying to track the maximum column for each row, and then check whether each subsequent row's maximum column is not greater than the previous ones. \n\nBut since the code structure is a bit unclear, perhaps I need to think of this.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. \n\nSuppose that for a robot to reach (0,0), all robots must be able to move left and up in such a way that their paths don't cause them to go out of the grid. \n\nThe critical point is that in any direction command, all robots must stay in the grid. \n\nSuppose we want to get a robot to (0,0). Let's say that robot is at (a, b). To reach (0,0), it must move left (b times) and up (a times). However, during those steps, all other robots must also not go out of the grid when moving in the same directions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that for every robot, its position can be moved to (0,0) by some sequence of commands, and in doing so, all robots are always within the grid at each step.\n\nAlternatively, the key idea is that all robots must be able to \"stay in line\" when moving towards (0,0). \n\nWait maybe the correct condition is that for each robot's row and column, there exists a path where all robots can move in such a way that when moving left and up, they don't go out. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nThe answer is \"YES\" if and only if there exists a robot such that:\n\n- The robot can reach (0,0) by moving left and/or up in some way, such that in all steps, every robot's movement is within the grid. \n\nWait but how do we ensure that all other robots also stay in the grid?\n\nMaybe the necessary condition is that for all robots, their rows are >= 0 and columns >=0 (obviously), but that's not helpful. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best approach is to look for the minimal condition where the robots can be moved in such a way so that one of them gets to (0,0), and during every step, all the movement directions don't push any robot out of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nSuppose that in order for a robot at (x,y) to reach (0,0), we need to move it up x times and left y times. But all other robots must be able to survive those movements in some combination of steps.\n\nWait but the commands are applied to all robots. So the set of commands must be such that all robots are moved in directions that don't push them out of the grid. \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is \"YES\" if and only if there exists a robot whose position (x,y) is such that:\n\nAll other robots are in positions that allow them to not go out of bounds when the commands to move the first robot to (0,0) are applied in some sequence. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that for each robot, the robot must be able to reach (0,0) by moving only left and/or up without any of their steps causing them to go out. \n\nWait, but other robots might interfere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nIf there's any robot that can reach (0,0) through some sequence of moves, and in all steps of that sequence, no robot moves out of the grid, then the answer is YES.\n\nBut how can we find that?\n\nLet me think of an example. Let's say in the first test case, the robot is at (0,1). Then sending left moves it to (0,0), which is allowed. So the answer is YES.\n\nAnother example, if a robot is at (1,0), then moving up once would take it to (0,0). But moving up in the first step, since there are no other robots, that's allowed. So that's a YES.\n\nAnother example: suppose a robot is at (2,3), and another robot is at (1,4). Then moving left once (to get the second robot to (1,3)), but also the first robot would be at (2,2). Then moving up twice, but in that case, the robot at (1,4) moving left once would be okay, but if they have to move in the same direction each step.\n\nWait, maybe the robots can be moved in a way that their paths don't cause any to go out. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal condition is that for all robots, their row is at least their column's distance from 0. Not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is trying to model the rightmost positions in each row. Let me think again about the code structure.\n\nLooking at the second part after the first loop:\n\nAfter the first loop breaks at some i and j, the code increments i (so i now is the row where the first loop broke) and then checks in rows from i onwards, whether any of them have a robot in columns less than j. \n\nThe second loop:\n\nfor(;i < n; i++){\n    for(k=0; k<j; k++){\n        if(arr[i][k] == 'R') break;\n    }\n    if(k<j) break; \n}\n\nSo, for each row i (starting from the first broken row), it checks the first j columns (columns 0 to j-1). If any of these columns in the row has a robot, then it breaks. \n\nIf after all rows, none of them have such a robot, then output YES, else NO.\n\nHmm, so what's the condition here?\n\nLet me think through:\n\nSuppose that the first loop is finding the earliest row where there's a robot to the right of some position. \n\nWait, perhaps the first loop is trying to track the earliest row where the rightmost robot is beyond a certain point. Let me see:\n\nThe first loop:\n\nfor each row i from 0 to n-1:\n    for each j from 0 to m-1:\n        // TODO here\n    if the inner loop completed (no break), then continue to next row\n    else, break the outer loop.\n\nWait, the code breaks the outer loop if the inner loop didn't finish (i.e., broke early). \n\nWait, the code says after the inner loop, if j < m (meaning the inner loop broke early), then break the outer loop. \n\nSo the first loop is looking for the first row i where, in the inner loop, there was an early break (i.e., some condition caused the loop to exit before j reaches m). \n\nThe TODO part must be a condition that causes the inner loop to break early. \n\nSuppose the condition is whether there is a robot at (i,j). Then, the inner loop would check each column in row i, and perhaps the first occurrence of a robot (or the last?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's first loop is designed to find the leftmost or rightmost robot in each row, and the condition is such that in the row, all robots are to the right of a certain position. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to track the minimal required columns. Let me think of the first loop's code.\n\nSuppose the TODO is checking whether this row's cell (i,j) is a robot. Wait, but how would that lead to breaking the inner loop? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal 'j' such that all subsequent rows (lower rows) have their robots only to the left of this j. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nSuppose the first loop is designed to compute for each row i the rightmost robot's column. The code is trying to ensure that the rightmost robot in row i is to the left or equal to the rightmost of row i-1. \n\nWait, maybe the code is checking whether the rightmost positions of each row form a non-increasing sequence from top to bottom. \n\nThe first loop could be tracking the current minimum allowed rightmost position. \n\nLet me try to think of the code steps.\n\nSuppose, in the first loop, for each row i, we track the rightmost column of that row (let's call it right_i). \n\nLet the previous rows' rightmost value be prev_max. \n\nWe need to ensure that right_i <= prev_max. \n\nThe first loop may break when this condition is violated, then the second part checks whether in the violating rows, there's a robot that is to the left of the previous allowed position.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible scenario:\n\nThe first loop is trying to find the first row where the rightmost robot is further to the right than the previous row's rightmost robot. \n\nSuppose the first loop is tracking the maximum allowed column (starting from m). For each row, the rightmost robot must not exceed this. \n\nWait perhaps the code's first loop is as follows:\n\nInitialize the maximum allowed column as m (or m-1?), then for each row from top (row 0) down:\n\nFor each row i, we find the rightmost robot in this row (say j_max). \n\nThis j_max must be <= the current allowed maximum. \n\nIf it is, then the new allowed maximum becomes j_max (so subsequent rows must be at or left of it). \n\nIf any row violates this, then the first loop breaks, and the code proceeds to check whether in the violating rows, there is a robot to the left of the previous allowed maximum. \n\nHmm, this makes sense.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me think of the code's first loop. Suppose the TODO is:\n\nFor each row i, check the columns from left to right (j from 0 to m-1). \n\nThe code is finding the first robot in the row (from left to right?), but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the rightmost robot in each row and ensure it's non-increasing. \n\nHere's an alternative plan:\n\nThe code's first loop is:\n\nInitialize current_max to m (the maximum possible column). \n\nFor each row from top (row 0) to bottom:\n\n   Find the rightmost robot in this row. \n\n   If that rightmost is greater than current_max, then this row is invalid. \n\n   So the first loop breaks here (using the inner loop to track this).\n\n   Else, update current_max to the rightmost of this row. \n\nWait, but how to implement this in the given loops. \n\nThe inner loop for j from 0 to m-1:\n\nWait j starts at 0 and increments. To find the rightmost robot in a row, perhaps we can track the maximum j where arr[i][j] is 'R'. \n\nBut the code's inner loop for j is from 0 to m-1. \n\nSuppose in the inner loop, we need to find the rightmost j where there is a robot. \n\nTo do that, we can iterate from the end (from m-1 down to 0), but the current code's inner loop is going from left to right.\n\nHmm, but given the code's structure, perhaps the TODO is to find the rightmost position where there is a robot in row i. \n\nWait, but the code's inner loop is starting from j=0 to m-1. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the earliest column where a robot exists, but that might not be it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is intended to track the first position in the row where all following columns (to the right) are empty. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is designed to check the rightmost robot in each row and ensure that they form a non-increasing sequence. \n\nLet me think of an example where this is true.\n\nSuppose we have:\n\nRow 0: R E R (so rightmost is column 2)\n\nRow 1: E R (rightmost is 1)\n\nRow 2: E E (no robot, but the problem states there is at least one robot in each test case).\n\nThen the rightmost columns are 2,1, etc., which is non-increasing. So this case would return YES if one of the robots can reach (0,0).\n\nWait, but the first robot in row 0, column 2 would require moving left twice, so it can reach (0,0). \n\nBut other robots may interfere. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, here's an alternative approach inspired by the code's structure and the problem's constraints:\n\nThe key condition is that the rightmost robot in each row must not be to the right of the rightmost robot in the previous row. \n\nLet me see how this would work. \n\nSuppose in row i, the rightmost robot's column is j_i. \n\nThen, for the sequence to be possible, j_0 >= j_1 >= ... >= j_{n-1}. \n\nIf this holds, then the robots can be moved in such a way that each row's robots can be shifted left to reach the target. \n\nBecause for each row, the rightmost robot is no further right than the row above, so when moving left, all robots can be shifted left without any going out of the grid. \n\nWait, but the robots in lower rows can be moved up, but that may complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, this condition ensures that there exists a path where all robots can move left until their rightmost is at (0,0), but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me see the first example. The first test case's robot is in (0,1). So the rightmost for row 0 is 1. The other rows (if any) must have rightmost <=1, but if there are no other robots, then it's possible. \n\nYes, so the condition holds. \n\nThe second test case, where moving any direction causes an explosion. Suppose there are two robots in (0,0) and (0,1). Then, the rightmost in row 0 is 1. But if you try to move left, the first robot would go out, so the condition would be okay (since 1 is the rightmost, but moving left would cause that robot to go to -1 column, which is invalid. \n\nWait, but the condition of rightmost columns being non-increasing would be okay here (since there is only one row), but the problem is that moving left would cause the first robot to explode. \n\nHmm, but according to the condition, this would still be allowed because the rightmost column is 1. But the answer is NO here. \n\nSo that suggests that this condition isn't sufficient. \n\nHmm, so perhaps there's another aspect. \n\nWait in the second test case's example, the problem states that any move would make a robot explode. So if there are two robots in (0,0) and (0,1), then moving left would cause the (0,0) robot to move to -1 (explosion). So the condition of the rightmost columns being non-increasing is satisfied (since rightmost is 1, and there's no other rows), but the answer is NO.\n\nSo the condition is not sufficient. \n\nThis means that the code's approach might be different. \n\nHmm. Perhaps the code's logic is something else. Let me think again.\n\nThe code after the first loop breaks at row i and column j (the j where the inner loop broke early). The second loop then checks in the following rows (starting at i) whether any of them have a robot in the first j columns. If yes, then output is NO.\n\nThe first loop's break happens when in row i, there's a position j where... what?\n\nPerhaps the first loop is looking for the first row where a robot is to the right of some column 'prev_j', and then the second loop checks whether there are robots to the left of that column in subsequent rows.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible interpretation of the code:\n\nThe first loop is trying to find the leftmost column where all rows below have no robots to the left of it. \n\nWait let's see:\n\nThe first loop:\n\nfor each row i from 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j from 0 to m-1:\n\n        if the cell (i,j) is empty, then continue? Or something else? \n\nWait the code's inner loop for j is from 0 to m-1, and the TODO is missing. \n\nPerhaps the code's inner loop is looking for the first occurrence of an empty cell in the row. \n\nFor example, if in the row i, there's at least one empty cell before the end, then the first loop will break (because when it finds an empty cell, maybe breaks the inner loop, so j is less than m, thus breaking the outer loop). \n\nWait, but how would that lead to the desired condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner loop is looking for the first empty cell from the left. \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to ensure that in all rows above a certain row, the rightmost robot is allowed to move left without other rows below having robots in the way. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is looking for the first row where there's a robot in column j such that in the rows below, there's a robot to the left of j, causing a conflict. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first loop is trying to find the first row where there is at least one robot, and the first occurrence of a robot in that row.\n\nWait I'm not sure. \n\nLet me think of the sample input given in the problem's notes.\n\nThe first test case example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nPerhaps the first test case has a robot at (0,1). The code's first loop:\n\nFor row 0, the first robot is at j=1. The inner loop runs from j=0 to 1. When j=0, the cell is E (empty?), then j=1 is R, so the inner loop completes (since it reaches m=2, j will be 2, so j < m is false, so the outer loop continues. \n\nWait maybe the code's inner loop is trying to find whether all cells up to m are R? No.\n\nAlternatively, the code's inner loop is designed to find the first occurrence of an R, and then break. \n\nWait, if the TODO is to check whether a cell is an R, then the first occurrence of 'R' in the row would break the loop, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the code's first loop's inner loop is checking for the first 'R' in the row. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's first loop is designed as follows:\n\nFor each row i:\n\n    for j from 0 to m-1:\n\n        if the cell is 'R', then continue (or break?), wait the code needs to be filled in.\n\nThe code's first loop breaks the outer loop if in row i, the inner loop was exited early (j < m). \n\nIf the break is done when an 'R' is found, then the first loop would break early. \n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nPerhaps I should try to think of what the correct condition must be. \n\nThe problem requires that there exists a sequence of commands where at least one robot reaches (0,0) without any robot exploding.\n\nLet me think of what must be true for that to happen:\n\nFor the robot to reach (0,0), it must be able to move left (if in the same row) or up (if in the same column), but more generally, it must be that there exists a sequence of commands where after some steps, that robot is at (0,0), and during all steps, all robots stayed within the grid.\n\nLet me think of this in terms of the final step leading to (0,0). \n\nSuppose the robot reaches (0,0) in step k. The last move must be either left (coming from (0,1)), or up (from (1,0)). \n\nSo to get there, the robot must have been able to move into that position in that last step without any robot exploding in any previous step. \n\nAnother idea: the robot must have a path where:\n\nFor the robot's path to (0,0), every step along the way must keep all robots within the grid.\n\nSuppose the robot is at (x,y). To reach (0,0), it needs to move up x times and left y times. \n\nThe problem is ensuring that during those moves, the other robots also don't go out of bounds. \n\nSuppose all other robots must also be able to move left and up in such a way that they never go out. \n\nThus, all robots must be positioned such that their initial position allows them to move left and up enough times without falling off. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that for every robot (rx, ry), their row must be >= 0 and column >=0, which is already ensured (since they're on the grid), but we also need that during the sequence of moves, they can reach their positions without any going out. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. \n\nAn alternative approach: the answer is YES if and only if for every robot, the robot is either already at (0,0), or there exists a path of steps where in each step they move in some direction, but no robot ever leaves the grid, and eventually one reaches (0,0). \n\nThe question is to find if any such path exists. \n\nTo model this, perhaps consider that for each robot's position (x,y), it can reach (0,0) by moving left y times and up x times. \n\nBut all other robots must also move such that during each step, they don't fall out. \n\nWait but the robot must move in directions that can be chosen in any order. \n\nSo, for example, the sequence of moves could be a mix of directions, not just all lefts followed by all ups. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only way a robot can reach (0,0) without any other robot exploding is if there exists a direction sequence that allows the desired robot to move into (0,0), and during that sequence, no other robot's move would take them outside. \n\nTo guarantee this, all other robots must be able to be moved in such a way that their paths don't take them out of the grid during those steps. \n\nThis seems difficult to model, but perhaps there's a pattern. \n\nLet me think of the minimal case where a single robot is present: \n\nIf the robot is already at (0,0), then answer is YES. \n\nOtherwise, the robot needs to move left and/or up steps. For example, if it's at (0,1), then moving left once is allowed. \n\nIf it's at (1,0), moving up once is allowed. \n\nIf it's at (2,3), then you need to move up twice and left three times. But the order can be chosen. \n\nNow, suppose there are two robots. \n\nExample from the problem: the second test case has two robots at (0,0) and (0,1). If you choose to move left (to get the second robot to (0,0)), the first robot will move to -1 column, which explodes. So you can't do that. Moving up would also make them move out of the grid (since they're in row 0). So any move causes explosion. Hence answer is NO.\n\nSo the problem is to ensure that the sequence of moves leading to one robot reaching (0,0) doesn't require that any other robot moves outside during the steps. \n\nSo perhaps the approach is to find for each robot, if it can reach (0,0) in some way without any other robot being forced to move outside during that process. \n\nHow to model this?\n\nLet me think of all robots' positions. For the robot to reach (0,0), there must be a sequence of moves where that robot moves to (0,0), and every step in that sequence keeps all other robots within the grid. \n\nThe sequence could be of any length, but we need to find at least one such path for any robot. \n\nThis sounds like a BFS problem where each state is the positions of all robots, and transitions are the commands (4 directions). But since the number of robots could be up to 25 (in a 5x5 grid), this is impractical for 5000 test cases. \n\nHence, there must be a smarter way. \n\nPerhaps the key insight is that for any robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must be positioned such that they can also reach their own (0,0) path without conflicting. But I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: For a robot to reach (0,0), the direction sequence must allow it to move there. During this process, every other robot must also have their path allowed. \n\nSo the robot's path to (0,0) must not require any other robot to move out of the grid in any of the steps taken. \n\nPerhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that for the desired robot to reach (0,0), there must be a path of directions such that during each step in this path:\n\nAll robots are moved in the chosen direction, and none go out of the grid. \n\nAt least one robot reaches (0,0). \n\nThe problem is to determine if such a path exists for any robot. \n\nTo find this without explicitly checking all paths, perhaps we can find a condition that must be satisfied. \n\nLet me consider the required steps for the robot to reach (0,0). \n\nSuppose the robot is at (a, b). To reach (0,0) it must move up a times and left b times. \n\nThe order of these moves can be arbitrary. \n\nFor example, the sequence could be 'up' repeated a times, then 'left' repeated b times. \n\nOr some interleaving. \n\nIn any case, during the steps, the robot must move up, and all other robots must not step out. \n\nLet me think of the necessary conditions for other robots:\n\nSuppose another robot is at (x,y). \n\nWhen we move up, its row decreases by 1, so as long as x- steps taken in up direction >=0. \n\nSimilarly for other directions. \n\nSuppose we choose to move up a times and left b times in some order, then for all other robots (x,y):\n\nAfter all the up moves and left moves, their final position must be within the grid. \n\nWait no, because all moves are done one by one. \n\nAlternatively, each move direction must be such that all robots remain within the grid after that move. \n\nSo every single step must not push any robot off the grid. \n\nThus, for any sequence of moves, each command must be chosen such that all robots would stay in the grid after that command. \n\nSo the sequence of commands must be such that every individual command is a direction where all robots can move in that direction without leaving the grid. \n\nThe sequence of commands must be such that at least one robot reaches (0,0) after some command in the sequence. \n\nThe problem thus becomes: is there any sequence of commands (each step's direction such that no robot steps out) such that after some command, a robot is at (0,0). \n\nNow, the question is how to model this efficiently. \n\nPerhaps the minimal condition is that for the desired robot to reach (0,0), the path must allow it to do so without requiring any other robot to move outside in any of the steps. \n\nLet me think of the robot at (a,b) wanting to reach (0,0). \n\nThe path must have a commands that move it up a times and left b times in any order. \n\nBut every step must be a move where all other robots can also move in that direction. \n\nThus, for each direction used in the path's steps:\n\nAt the time of that step, no robot is on the edge where that direction would take them out. \n\nFor example, to move left in a step, all robots must be in columns >=1. \n\nSo for the robot to move left b times, we need that in those steps when we choose to move left, all robots are in columns >=1. \n\nSimilarly for other directions. \n\nBut this requires the path's steps to be chosen in a way that all robots stay in the grid during every step. \n\nThis seems complex but perhaps we can model it in terms of constraints on other robots' positions. \n\nFor example, for a robot to reach (0,0), all other robots must be able to survive the required moves. \n\nLet me think of necessary constraints for the other robots:\n\nSuppose the robot chosen is at (a,b). To move up a times and left b times, but the moves can be interleaved. \n\nHowever, during all those steps, every other robot must also be able to survive each individual step. \n\nFor example, any other robot at (x,y) must satisfy:\n\n- When moving up: their row x must be >0 (or equal to x after move? No, the move decreases row by 1). \n\nWait, if we have a\u673a\u5668\u4eba in row 0, moving up would take them to -1, which is invalid. \n\nSo for the robot to move up, all other robots must be in rows >=1. \n\nOr when choosing to move up as a command, all robots must be in rows >=1. \n\nThus, for any direction chosen in the sequence of commands, before that command is executed, all robots must be in positions where that direction is safe. \n\nSo for the robot' desired path to be possible, there must be a sequence of directions where:\n\nEach direction in the sequence is safe for all robots (i.e., all can move in that direction without leaving the grid). \n\nThe final position of the desired robot must be (0,0). \n\nThis is still complex. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal condition is that for the desired robot (a,b), all other robots are such that:\n\n- For the robot to move up a times, their rows must be at least a. \n\nNo, because other robots can be in any row >=0 as long as they can survive the steps. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem can be solved by checking for each robot whether there exists a way to reach (0,0) without moving any other robot off the grid in any of the steps taken. \n\nTo do this efficiently, for each robot, we can check whether it's possible to make it reach (0,0) using moves where the moves are in directions that are safe for all other robots. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of this for the chosen robot's path. \n\nSuppose the chosen robot is at (a,b). To reach (0,0), they need to move up a times and left b times. \n\nThese moves can be done in any order, but every time we choose a direction, all other robots must also be able to move that direction without leaving the grid. \n\nThus, for each required move in the path (either up or left), the direction must be allowed by all other robots. \n\nFor example:\n\nIf we want to move left, then all other robots must be in columns >=1 (so that their move left won't take them below 0). \n\nSimilarly, to move up, all other robots must be in rows >=1. \n\nThe robot' path must be a sequence of left and up moves (in any order) such that each move is allowed by all other robots' current positions. \n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n- For the robot to move left b times:\n\nEach of those left moves must be allowed by the other robots' positions at that time. \n\nThe same for moving up a times. \n\nThis is complicated, but perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nFor the chosen robot (a,b): \n\nThe robot must be able to reach (0,0) by moving up and left, such that:\n\nFor every other robot (x,y) in the grid:\n\nThe number of times they move up must not exceed their initial row x. \n\nThe number of times they move left must not exceed their initial column y. \n\nBecause each up move reduces their row by 1, so after choosing to move up k times, they must have x - (number of up moves) >=0. \n\n similarly for left moves. \n\nBut the moves are not all taken at once, but in sequence. \n\nWait but the total number of up moves in the entire sequence must be such that for every other robot's row x, the total up moves in the sequence must be <=x. \n\n similarly, the number of left moves must be <= their initial y. \n\nBecause any time they move up, their row decreases by 1. \n\nThus, the total number of up moves in the sequence must be <= the minimum row of all other robots (including the chosen one). \n\n similarly for left moves: the total number of left moves must be <= the minimum column of all robots. \n\nWait, this is a critical point. \n\nThe total number of up commands must be <= the smallest row (of all robots). \n\n similarly, the total number of left commands must be <= the smallest column (of all robots). \n\n because for each robot, the number of up moves must be at most their own initial row. \n\nThus, the total up moves must be <= the minimum row among all robots. \n\n similarly for left moves: the total left moves must be <= the minimum column among all robots. \n\nTherefore, for a chosen robot (a,b), to reach (0,0) requires that:\n\na <= min_row (the minimum row of all robots) \n\n and \n\nb <= min_col (the minimum column of all robots). \n\nBecause otherwise, even if the chosen robot can move up a times (its own row), some other robot may have row <a, so cannot move up a times. \n\n similarly for columns. \n\nSo the conditions are:\n\nThe desired robot's a (row) must be less than or equal to the minimum row of all robots. \n\n And the desired robot's b (column) must be less than or equal to the minimum column of all robots. \n\n But the minimum row of all robots is the smallest row among all robots. \n\nFor example, if any robot is in row 0, then the minimum row is 0. \n\nThus, the chosen robot must have a row <=0 (i.e., row 0). \n\n Similarly, if any robot has column 0, then the minimum column is 0, the chosen robot must have b <=0 \u2192 column 0. \n\n Thus, the choosen robot must be in row 0 (since otherwise the minimum row would be less than a, so a can't be <= min_row). \n\n Similarly, the chosen robot must be in column 0. \n\n Or, alternatively, the only possible robot that can be chosen is one that is in row 0 and column 0. \n\n Wait, that would only allow the robot already at (0,0) to be chosen, which is only possible if they're already there. \n\n That can't be, because the first example has a robot at (0,1), and the answer is YES. \n\nHmm, this suggests my reasoning is incorrect. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nSuppose the first example has only one robot at (0,1). \n\nThe minimum row among all robots is 0, \n\nthe minimum column is 1 (since there's only one robot). \n\nSo the desired robot is at a=0, b=1. \n\n Thus: \n\na=0 \u2264 min_row (0) \u2192 ok \n\n b=1 \u2264 min_col (1) \u2192 ok \n\n Thus it is allowed. \n\n So the total up moves needed are 0 (a=0), which is allowed. \n\n The total left moves needed are 1. \n\n The minimum column of all robots is 1, so the total left moves (1) is \u22641 \u2192 okay. \n\n Thus this is acceptable. \n\nThus the conditions are:\n\nThe total up moves needed for the chosen robot (a) must be \u2264 the minimum row of all robots. \n\nThe total left moves needed (b) must be \u2264 the minimum column of all robots. \n\n But wait, the total up moves can't exceed any robot's initial row. \n\n For example, if there is a robot at row 2, the chosen robot is at row 1, then the minimum row is 1 (if other robot is row 2), so total up moves can be up to 1. \n\n So the chosen robot can have a=1 ( so a <= min_row (1)), and the other robot at row 2 can move up 1 time. \n\n So yes, it's possible. \n\nSo the conditions seem to be:\n\nTo choose a robot (a, b), there must exist a sequence of commands with exactly 'a' up commands and 'b' left commands (in any order), such that: \n\nFor every robot (x,y): \n\nx - (number of up commands) >=0 \n\n and \n\ny - (number of left commands) >=0 \n\nAdditionally, the sequence must include at least a up commands and b left commands. \n\nWait, but the total up commands must be at least a (since the chosen robot needs to move up a times to reach row 0). \n\n Similarly, the total left commands must be at least b. \n\n But the total up commands can be more than a, but then the chosen robot would go to negative rows. \n\nNo, no. Because the total up commands must be exactly a. \n\nWait, no. The sequence of commands can have other moves, but the robot must have moved up exactly a times, and left exactly b times. \n\n But other moves like down or right would complicate things. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to rephrase the conditions. \n\nThe total number of up commands in the entire sequence must be \u2265 a (for the chosen robot to reach row 0). \n\n Similarly the total left commands must be \u2265 b. \n\n However, for every other robot (x,y), the net number of up commands minus down commands must result in their final row being \u22650. \n\n Similarly for left/right. \n\n This is getting too complex. \n\nPerhaps another idea: \n\nTo allow the chosen robot to reach (0,0), there must be a way to choose a sequence of up and left moves (only) that total at least a and b respectively, and such that for all other robots: \n\n their row + up moves - down moves \u22650 \n\n their column + left moves - right moves \u22650 \n\n but this is not helpful. \n\n Perhaps the minimal conditions are: \n\n The chosen robot's row a must be the minimum row of all robots. \n\n And its column b must be the minimum column of all robots. \n\n Because then, the minimal row is a, so other robots have row \u2265a. Thus, when we move up a times, other robots' rows will become (x -a) \u22650. \n\n Similarly, their columns must be \u2265b. \n\n Thus, moving left b times will leave their columns at (y\u2014b) \u22650. \n\n Thus, in this case, the chosen robot can move up a times and left b times, and other robots can also do so without exploding. \n\n Thus, the conditions are:\n\nThe chosen robot must be the one with the minimum row and minimum column among all robots. \n\n Because then, moving up the minimum row (a) and left the minimum column (b) will be possible for all robots. \n\nThus the algorithm is: \n\nCheck if there exists a robot with row equal to the minimum row of all robots and column equal to the minimum column of all robots. \n\n If such a robot exists, output YES. \n\n Otherwise, output NO. \n\n Because only such a robot can be moved to (0,0) without other robots exploding. \n\nLet me test this with the examples:\n\nFirst example: robot at (0,1). The minimum row is 0, minimum column is 1. The robot has column 1, so min column is 1. So it has both the min row and min column \u2192 yes. \n\nSecond example: two robots at (0,0) and (0,1). The min row is 0, min column is 0. The first robot has row 0 and column 0 \u2192 yes. So why is the answer NO?\n\nWait this contradicts the example. \n\nIn the second test case, the problem states that any command causes a robot to explode. \n\nAh, this implies that my hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nThe second example has a robot at (0,0) (which satisfies the min conditions), so according to this, the answer should be YES. But the problem states the answer is NO. \n\nThis means the hypothesis is wrong. \n\nHmm, so what's the issue here?\n\nIn that case, the robot is already at (0,0), so the answer should be YES. \n\nBut according to the problem's note for the second test case, the answer is NO. \n\nWait, this suggests that my understanding of the second test case is incorrect. \n\nAh, the second test case must have two robots in such a way that any move causes a robot to explode. \n\nPerhaps the two robots are at (0,0) and (0,1). \n\nIf you send a command to move left, the first robot moves to -1 column (explodes). \n\nIf you send move right, the second robot moves to column 2 (if m is 2, then it's okay? Or perhaps the second test case has m=1? \n\nNo, likely the second test case has robots at (0,0) and (0,1), and any direction chosen would cause either the first robot to move left or the second to move right beyond the grid. \n\nWait, if the second robot is at (0,1), and m=2 (columns 0 and 1), then moving right would take it to column 2 which is beyond the grid (assuming m=2). Thus, the move right would cause the second robot to explode. \n\nThus any command would cause at least one robot to explode. \n\nSo the robot at (0,0) is already at the target. So why is the answer NO?\n\nAh, maybe the problem requires that at least one robot reaches the upper-left corner *after* executing commands. \n\nBut if a robot is already there, then you can execute zero commands, and thus it is counted. \n\nAh! The problem statement says: \"Can you do this without forcing any of the robots to explode?\"\n\nIf there's already a robot at (0,0), then yes, you can do it with zero commands, so the answer should be YES. But the second test case's note says it's NO. \n\nThis indicates a contradiction, so I must have misunderstood the second test case. \n\nWait, the problem's note says: \n\n\"in the second test case, if you try to send any command, at least one robot explodes. \n\nBut the answer is NO because you cannot make a robot reach the upper left corner without making any explode. \n\nBut if there is a robot already at the upper left corner, then you don't need to send any command. \n\nThus, the second test case must not have a robot at (0,0). \n\nAh, probably the second test case's robots are at (0,1) and (0,0), but then the first robot is already at (0,0), so the answer would be YES. \n\nHmm, I must have made a mistake in understanding the examples. \n\nPerhaps in the second test case, the robots are at (0,1) and (0,2), and m is 2. \n\nThus, moving left from (0,1) would take it to (0,0) but the second robot at (0,2) would move to (0,1) when moving left. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the second test case could have robots at (0,1) and (1,0). \n\nThen moving left would push the first to (0,0) which is good, but the second robot moves left into -1 (if moving left is chosen. \n\nWait, no. The second robot is at (1,0). Moving left would take it to (1,-1) which is outside. \n\n Thus, any command would cause that robot to explode. \n\nThus the answer is NO. \n\nSo in this scenario, the first robot at (0,1) could reach (0,0) via a left move, but the second robot would explode, which is not allowed. \n\n Thus, the condition is that there must be a robot that can reach the target without any other robot being forced to move out in any of the steps taken. \n\nSo the previous hypothesis is not sufficient. \n\nThus, I need to think differently. \n\n Perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem by checking for each robot whether there exists a path where their steps can be done without any other robot being pushed out. \n\nBut how to do this quickly. \n\nAnother idea inspired by the code structure: \n\nThe code's main loops are trying to find the rightmost robot in each row, ensuring that they form a non-increasing sequence from top to bottom. \n\nIf this holds, then the answer is YES. \n\nLet me test this with the second example where two robots are at (0,1) and (1,0). \n\n The rightmost in row 0 is 1. The rightmost in row 1 is 0. So the sequence is 1,0 which is non-increasing. Thus the cod would output YES. But the actual answer is NO because moving left would cause the robot in row 1, column 0 to move left to -1. \n\n Thus this hypothesis is also incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the code's logic is different. \n\n Looking back at the code's second part: \n\n After the first loop breaks at i and j, the code increments i and then checks in the following rows whether any of them have a robot in columns less than j. \n\n The output is YES only if none of the rows after i have any\u673a\u5668\u4eba in the first j columns. \n\n This suggests that the first loop is finding some j where the current row's rightmost\u673a\u5668\u4eba is beyond a certain point, and then ensuring that all rows below don't have robots to the left of that point. \n\n Alternatively, perhaps the first loop is tracking the earliest row where the leftmost robot is too far to the right to allow other rows below to have robots to the left of it. \n\n This is getting complicated. \n\n Perhaps I should try to find what the missing code does. \n\n The first loop is for each row i and column j. The TODO is inside the inner loop. \n\n The inner loop runs from j=0 to m-1. \n\n The TODO must be a condition that causes the inner loop to break early. \n\n What would cause that break?\n\nPerhaps the code is checking whether the cell (i,j) has a robot. \n\n For example, when a robot is found, then the inner loop breaks, and thus the outer loop breaks as well. \n\n Wait, suppose the TODO is something like:\n\nif(arr[i][j] == 'R') break;\n\n then the inner loop would break at the first occurrence of 'R' in the row. \n\n But this doesn't make sense. \n\n Alternatively, the code might be trying to find the first empty cell in the row. \n\n For example, if the cell is 'E', then break the inner loop. \n\n So if the row has no empty cells, the loop completes. \n\n But how does this help? \n\n Perhaps the code is checking whether the entire row is filled with robots. \n\n But I'm not sure. \n\n Alternatively, the code might be finding the first position j where there is a robot, and then ensuring that in subsequent rows, there are no robots to the left of that j. \n\n This could ensure that all robots are to the right of a certain column in each row. \n\n Alternatively, the code's first loop is trying to find the leftmost robot in each row. \n\n Suppose that for row i, the leftmost robot is at column j. \n\n Then, the following rows must not have any robots to the left of j. \n\n If this is the case, then the answer is YES. \n\n So the code's first loop is finding the leftmost robot's column in each row and ensuring that each subsequent row's leftmost is not to the left of the previous' leftmost. \n\n But this would mean that the leftmost of the rows are non-decreasing. \n\n Not sure. \n\n Alternatively, the code's first loop is finding the earliest column where all rows are filled to the left of that column with robots. \n\n This is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps I should look for the correct approach and think of the code's structure. \n\nThe code's final condition is whether i reached n (output YES) or not (output NO). \n\nThe first loop breaks when for some row i, the inner loop breaks early (j < m). \n\n Then, the code increments i and checks the subsequent rows to see if any of them have a robot in the first j columns. \n\n If any do, then i will be less than n, and the answer is NO. \n\n Otherwise, it's YES. \n\n So the first loop finds a row i and column j such that in row i, there's some condition that breaks the inner loop. \n\n Then, the second loop checks that the rows after i have no robots in columns <j. \n\n This suggests that the first loop's condition is about ensuring that up to row i, the robots are in certain positions, and the following rows don't have robots to the left of j. \n\nPerhaps the first loop is designed to find the first row where there is an empty cell to the left of some j. \n\nFor example, if in row i, there is an empty cell at position j, then the first loop breaks. \n\n Then the second loop checks that all subsequent rows also do not have any robot to the left of j. \n\nThus the condition is that for all rows up to i, the first j columns are filled with robots, and the rows after have none to the left of j. \n\n This would mean that all robots are to the right of j in later rows. \n\n Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the first loop is checking that all rows are filled with robots up to some column j. But this is not clear. \n\nPerhaps the correct answer is to find for each robot whether its column is the leftmost in its row and all rows below have no robots to the left of its column. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the correct approach is to find that for each robot, there are no robots to the left of it in its row or above it in the same column. \n\nThis would ensure that they can move left or up without other robots blocking. \n\n But I'm not certain. \n\nGiven time constraints, perhaps I should try to think of what the code is doing and fill in the missing part. \n\n The code's first loop for each row i and j:\n\n The inner loop is for j from 0 to m-1. \n\n The TODO is likely checking whether there is a robot in this cell. \n\n Perhaps the code is trying to find the first column j in the row where there is a robot. \n\n Then, for the first loop, if any subsequent row has a robot in a column less than j, then the condition is violated. \n\n But I'm not sure. \n\n Alternatively, the code is trying to find the rightmost robot in each row and check that they are non-increasing. \n\n To find the rightmost robot in a row i, the inner loop would iterate from m-1 down to 0 looking for 'R', but the current loop is from 0 to m-1. \n\n Thus, this approach won't work. \n\n Maybe the code's first loop is designed to find the first robot in the row (from left), and then ensure that the rows below have their first robot not to the left of this one. \n\n For example:\n\n Row 0's first robot is at column j0. \n\n Row 1's first robot must be at column >= j0. \n\n This way, they form a non-decreasing sequence of first robot's columns. \n\n This would imply that all robots are to the right of previous rows' robots. \n\n Thus, when moving left, they won't have to move past the earlier row's robots. \n\n Hmm, but how does this help in reaching the top-left corner? \n\n Perhaps if the first robot in each row is non-decreasing, then the leftmost robot in the first row can be moved left. \n\n For example, in the first row, the first robot is at column j0. To move left, you have to move all robots in that row to the left of j0 would have to be empty. \n\n Not sure. \n\n Alternatively, the code's first loop's inner loop is looking for the first empty cell in the row. \n\n For example, if in row i, there exists an empty cell at position j, then break the inner loop. \n\n Thus, the first loop is looking for the first row that contains an empty cell, and then the j is the first column where this empty cell is found. \n\n Then the second loop checks the rows below this row to see if any of them have a robot in the columns before j. \n\n If they do, then it's impossible (output NO), because those robots would be to the left of the first empty cell's column, thus blocking the path. \n\n The intuition might be that if there is an empty cell at column j in row i, then the robots below must be to the right of j. \n\n This would allow the robots above to move left to fill the empty space. \n\n Not sure, but perhaps this is the case. \n\n For the first test case, where there is a robot at (0,1): \n\n The first row (row 0) has cells 'E' (column 0) and 'R' (column 1). \n\n The first empty cell is at column 0. \n\n The first loop breaks at row 0 and j=0. \n\n The second loop checks rows above row 0? No, the second loop starts from i=1. \n\n Wait no, the first loop breaks when j < m (which is true here, since the first cell is empty and the inner loop broke at j=0). \n\n Thus, the first loop breaks, and the code increments i to 1. \n\n Then the second loop runs for i=1 to n-1. \n\n For each row i (starting at 1), check whether any cell in columns less than j (which is 0) have a robot. \n\n Since columns less than j=0 are none, this loop will not find any. \n\n Thus, i will remain equal to n (if there are no more rows), so output YES. \n\n This fits the first test case's answer of YES. \n\n In the second test case where robots are at (0,1) and (1,0): \n\n The first row has cells E and R (assuming m=2). \n\n The first empty cell is at column 0. \n\n So the first loop breaks at row 0, j=0. \n\n The code increments i to 1. \n\n The second loop checks row 1. \n\n The columns to check are less than j=0 (none), so no issue. \n\n Thus, the answer would be YES, but the actual answer is NO. \n\n Thus this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is frustrating. Perhaps I should try to think of the code's approach and see what the missing part must be. \n\nThe first loop is for each row from top to bottom. \n\nFor each row, the inner loop runs from j=0 to m-1. \n\nThe TODO is likely checking whether the cell is a robot. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to track the rightmost robot in each row and ensure that they form a non-increasing sequence. \n\nTo do this, the inner loop could be tracking the maximum j where there's a robot. \n\nBut since the loop is from 0 to m-1, the first occurrence of a robot's column is not the rightmost. \n\nUnless the inner loop is broken when it finds the first empty cell, and thus the rightmost robot's column is j-1. \n\nFor example, the inner loop looks for the first empty cell. \n\nIf the row is all robots, the inner loop completes, and proceeds to the next row. \n\nOtherwise, the first empty cell is at j, so the rightmost robot is at j-1. \n\n Thus, the maximum j for the row is j-1. \n\nThen, the first loop ensures that the rightmost of the rows is non-increasing. \n\n If not, then the first loop breaks early. \n\n The second loop then checks whether the rows below have any robot to the left of this j. \n\n This might be the case. \n\n Thus, the missing code would be something like: \n\n if (arr[i][j] == 'E') break;\n\n this would find the first empty cell in the row. \n\n Then, the rightmost robot is at j-1. \n\n The first loop then is checking whether the rightmost robot of each row is non-increasing. \n\n For example:\n\n previous_max = m \n\n for each row i:\n\n   for j from 0 to m-1:\n\n      if arr[i][j] is E \u2192 break \n\n   if j < m \u2192 current rightmost is j-1 \n\n   if current_rightmost > previous_max \u2192 then break \n\n   else previous_max = current_rightmost \n\n   else continue \n\n This way, the first loop ensures that the rightmost robots form a non-increasing sequence. \n\n If any row violates this, then the first loop breaks. \n\n The second loop then checks whether the rows below have robots to the left of the previous_max. \n\n Thus, the missing code is checking for the first empty cell in the row. \n\n Thus, the TODO is: \n\nif (arr[i][j] == 'E') break;\n\n\u8fd9\u6837\uff0cinner loop breaks at the first empty cell. \n\nThen the rightmost robot in the row is j-1. \n\nThe first loop then checks whether each row's rightmost is not greater than the previous one. \n\nIf this holds, then the answer is YES. \n\n Otherwise, the second loop checks whether the following rows have any robots to the left of the current's rightmost. \n\n This might be the approach. \n\n Thus, the missing code is:\n\nif (arr[i][j] == 'E') break;\n\n\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u884c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u5230\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a7a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e j\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u5b9a\u8be5\u884c\u6700\u53f3\u8fb9\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e3a j-1\u3002 \n\n\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u884c\u7684 rightmost \u5fc5\u987b non-increasing. \n\n \u5982\u679c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u6210\u7acb,\u5219\u8f93\u51fa YES\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u8f93\u51fa NO. \n\n\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b:\n\n\u5047\u8bbe\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728 (0, 1)\uff0c\u5219\u884c0\u7684 cells \u662f 'E' and 'R'. \n\n\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a7a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u5728 j=0 (\u56e0\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u662f\u7a7a\u7684), \u6253\u7834\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af. \n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8be5\u884c\u7684 rightmost \u662f j-1 = -1?
