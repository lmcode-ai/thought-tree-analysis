So for each i starting at 2, we read p_i, then add i to grid[p_i].

Then, returning 3 to the parent (node 1). Then, for node 1, the sum from children (node 2's return is 3). Now, node 1's l is 1. Since 3 >=1, so we set sum to min(r_v (5), 3). So the return is 3. Thus, the total ans is 1, which matches the example. Hmm, that seems to work. Another example: the second test case in the note. Suppose the tree is 1 connected to 2 and 3. The first operation is choosing v=2 with c [3,3], so a1=3, a2=3. Second operation v=3 with c [2,7], so a1 becomes 5, a2 remains 3 (since the second operation's c for node 2 is 7? Wait, no. Wait, the path for v=3 is 1->3. So the c array for that operation would be [c1, c2], where c1 <= c2. Wait, the path for v=3 is 1 and 3. So the c array has length 2. In the second operation, choosing c = [2,7], so a1 increases by 2, a3 by 7. So after first operation (v=2, c [3,3]), a1 is 3, a2 is 3, a3 is 0. Second operation (v=3, c [2,7]) gives a1=3+2=5, a3=0+7=7. The a2 remains 3, which is okay. The required a2 must be between l and r. \n\nAssuming the constraints for node 2 are l=3 and r=3, so that's okay. Now, let's see how the code would handle this. For node 3, which has no children, the sum is 0. Its l is, say, 7 (since the final a3 is 7).",

Therefore, the missing code is those three lines. Now, the code's dfs function may have some issues. Let me check again.

Node1's sum is 3+7=10. If node1's l is 5, then 10 >=5 \u2192 returns min(r_v, 10). Thus, ans is 2, which matches the example. Therefore, the code's logic is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out what's missing in this code. Let's start by understanding the problem. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to set each node's a_v between its l_v and r_v. Each operation allows choosing a path from root to some node v and adding a non-decreasing sequence c to all nodes along that path. \n\nHmm, the code provided has a main function and a dfs function. The main reads the input, but there's a TODO in the part where the tree is being built. The grid is supposed to represent the tree structure. The input for the parents of nodes 2 to n is given as p_2, p_3, etc. So for each i from 2 to n, the parent p_i is given, and we need to add the child i to the grid's entry for p_i. So the missing code there is probably something like:\n\nint p;\ncin >> p;\ngrid[p].push_back(i);\n\nWait, but the loop is for i from 2 to n. Let's see: for each i in 2..n, the p_i is the parent. So for each i starting at 2, we read p_i, then add i to grid[p_i]. So the code inside the for loop for building the tree should be:\n\nint p;\ncin >> p;\ngrid[p].push_back(i);\n\nYes, that's the first part. So that's the missing code in the TODO block.\n\nNow, looking at the dfs function. The current code might not be correct. Let me think about the approach. The problem requires that each a_v must be between l_v and r_v. Each operation adds a non-decreasing sequence along a path from root to v. The key is to model the required increments in such a way that the minimal steps are taken.\n\nThe approach here might be similar to greedy algorithms where we process nodes in a certain order and track the required increments. Since the operations can be thought of as adding non-decreasing sequences along paths, perhaps we can model this as a problem where each node's required value is determined by the path from the root, and we need to find the minimal steps by considering the differences between nodes.\n\nWait, another thought: each operation corresponds to choosing a path and adding a non-decreasing sequence. The key insight here is that each operation can be represented as adding a certain \"step\" along the path. To minimize the number of operations, we need to find a way to cover all required increments with as few such steps as possible.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a problem where each node's required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The operations can be thought of as adding variables along paths. The minimal number of operations is equivalent to the number of times we have to \"adjust\" the path contributions to meet the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to process the tree in a bottom-up manner. Let me think of the required a_v as the sum of all c's along the paths that include the node. Since each c is non-decreasing, the contribution to a node's value is the sum of all the c's from the operations that include it in their path. \n\nAlternatively, considering that each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the minimal steps can be determined by looking at the differences between the required a_v and the constraints. Maybe the problem can be transformed into a problem where we track the required increments along the path and find the minimal steps by considering the necessary increments at each node.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the required a_v as needing to be at least l_v and at most r_v. The minimal number of operations is determined by the \"gaps\" between the required values and the constraints. \n\nWait, perhaps the solution is similar to the problem where you have to cover the required values with non-decreasing sequences. Let me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of each operation as contributing a certain amount to the path. Let me model the required a_v as the sum of all the c's from the operations that pass through the node. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order (children first, then parent). For each node, we can track the minimal required contribution from the parent's side. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by some similar problems: \n\nThe key idea is that each operation corresponds to adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. To minimize the number of operations, we can model the required increments as a series of \"steps\" where each step contributes a certain amount to the path. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of all the c's from the operations that include the node. Since each c is non-decreasing along the path, the contribution to a node's parent must be less than or equal to the contribution to the node itself. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a problem where for each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The minimal number of operations is the sum of the differences between the required increments and the constraints, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample, choosing v=2 and c=[1,2] gives a1=1 and a2=2. The l and r for each node must be satisfied. The minimal steps are determined by the required increments along the paths. \n\nThe algorithm might involve processing the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root) and tracking the required minimum and maximum contributions. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as follows:\n\nEach operation can be thought of as adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. The minimal number of operations is the number of times we have to \"jump\" in the required increments along the path from the root to each node. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of all the c's from the operations that include the node. Let me denote the required a_v as x_v, which must be between l_v and r_v. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order (children first). For each node v, the required x_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The contributions from the children must be considered. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's solution approach:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is equal to the sum over all nodes of the difference between the required value and the maximum possible contribution from the parent's side. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s consider the path from the root to each node. Each operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. The total contribution to a node v is the sum of all the c_k's from the operations that include v in their path. \n\nTo minimize the number of operations, we can model this as a greedy problem where we track the required increments along the path. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of all the c's from the operations that pass through v. Since each c array is non-decreasing, the contribution to the parent of v must be less than or equal to the contribution to v. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the required a_v as the sum of some variables, and the constraints on the variables must form a non-decreasing sequence. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the code structure given:\n\nThe code has a dfs function that returns a sum, and the ans is incremented when the sum is less than the lower bound. \n\nLooking at the current code's dfs function:\n\nThe function is called recursively for each child of the current node. The sum is the sum of the returns from the children. Then, if sum < a[n].first (the lower bound l_v for node n), then we add an operation, set sum to a's upper bound (r_v?), and increment ans. Else, set sum to the minimum of the upper bound and the current sum. \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me see:\n\nThe code's logic in the dfs function is:\n\nsum is the sum of the returns from the children. \n\nThen, if sum < l_v, then we need to add an operation. The code increments ans, and sets sum to a[n].second (the upper bound r_v). \n\nElse, it sets sum to min(r_v, sum). \n\nWait, but why? \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that the sum represents the minimal required value that can be passed up to the parent. \n\nWait, maybe the function is trying to compute the minimal required value that the parent must contribute. \n\nAlternatively, the dfs function is trying to compute the minimal required value that the current node must have, considering the constraints from its children. \n\nWait, let me think of the process as follows:\n\nEach node's a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. \n\nThe operations can be thought of as adding non-decreasing sequences along paths. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order. For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. However, the contributions from the children's operations might already contribute some amount. \n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to track the required \"deficit\" at each node. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's solution:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times their required value exceeds the maximum possible contribution from their parent's side. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as follows:\n\nEach operation corresponds to choosing a path and adding a non-decreasing sequence. The minimal number of operations is the number of times we have to \"step up\" the required value along the path. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of all the c's along the path from the root to v. Since each c is non-decreasing, the c's along the path must form a non-decreasing sequence. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). For each node v, the minimal required a_v is l_v, but it can't exceed r_v. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the required a_v as the maximum between l_v and the sum of the contributions from the children. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the code's structure:\n\nThe dfs function is trying to compute the minimal required value that the current node must have, given the constraints from its children. \n\nSuppose that for each node v, the sum of the returns from its children is the minimal required value that the parent must contribute. \n\nWait, let me think of the dfs function's return value as the minimal required value that the parent must have. \n\nFor example, when processing a node v, the children's required values must be at least their l_i. The sum of the children's returns (which are the minimal required contributions from their parent) would be the total that the current node must contribute. \n\nWait, perhaps the dfs function is designed such that the return value is the minimal required value that the current node must have, considering its children's constraints. \n\nLet me see:\n\nSuppose the current node is v. The children's required a's must be at least their l's. The sum of the returns from the children (sum) is the total that the current node must contribute to its children. \n\nWait, maybe the sum is the total required contribution from the current node's side. \n\nThen, the current node's a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. \n\nIf the sum (the required contribution from the current node's side) is less than l_v, then we need to add an operation. The operation's c for this node would be set to (l_v - sum), but also considering the upper limit. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the current node's a_v must be at least l_v. The sum from the children's required contributions is the minimal that the current node can contribute. If that sum is less than l_v, then we need to add an operation that increases the current node's a_v to at least l_v. \n\nBut how does this translate into the code?\n\nIn the code's current dfs function:\n\nsum is the sum of the returns from the children. \n\nThen, if sum < a[n].first (l_v), then we need to add an operation. The code increments ans, and sets sum to a[n].second (r_v). \n\nWait, but why set it to r_v? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the return value is the minimal possible value that the current node can have, given the constraints. \n\nWait, maybe the return value is the minimal value that the current node can have, such that all its children's constraints are satisfied. \n\nWait, let me think of the example given in the problem's first note:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nSuppose the tree is 1 connected to 2. \n\nThe l and r for node 1 is (1, 5), node 2 is (2, 3). \n\nWait, no, the first test case's note says that after one operation, a1 is 1 and a2 is 2. The l and r for node 1 must be l1 <=1 <= r1, and similarly for node 2. \n\nWait, perhaps the first test case's input is:\n\nn=2, p_2 is 1. \n\nThe l and r for node 1 is (1,5), node 2 is (2,3). \n\nThen, the code's dfs function for node 2 would first process its children (none), so sum is 0. \n\nThen, since sum (0) < l_v (2), so ans increases by 1, and sum is set to r_v (3). \n\nThen, returning 3 to the parent (node 1). \n\nThen, for node 1, the sum from children (node 2's return is 3). \n\nNow, node 1's l is 1. Since 3 >=1, so we set sum to min(r_v (5), 3). So the return is 3. \n\nThus, the total ans is 1, which matches the example. \n\nHmm, that seems to work. \n\nAnother example: the second test case in the note. \n\nSuppose the tree is 1 connected to 2 and 3. \n\nThe first operation is choosing v=2 with c [3,3], so a1=3, a2=3. \n\nSecond operation v=3 with c [2,7], so a1 becomes 5, a2 remains 3 (since the second operation's c for node 2 is 7? Wait, no. Wait, the path for v=3 is 1->3. So the c array for that operation would be [c1, c2], where c1 <= c2. \n\nWait, the path for v=3 is 1 and 3. So the c array has length 2. \n\nIn the second operation, choosing c = [2,7], so a1 increases by 2, a3 by 7. \n\nSo after first operation (v=2, c [3,3]), a1 is 3, a2 is 3, a3 is 0. \n\nSecond operation (v=3, c [2,7]) gives a1=3+2=5, a3=0+7=7. \n\nThe a2 remains 3, which is okay. \n\nThe required a2 must be between l and r. \n\nAssuming the constraints for node 2 are l=3 and r=3, so that's okay. \n\nNow, let's see how the code would handle this. \n\nFor node 3, which has no children, the sum is 0. \n\nIts l is, say, 7 (since the final a3 is 7). \n\nWait, perhaps the input for node 3's l and r is (7,7). \n\nSo for node 3's dfs:\n\nsum is 0. \n\n0 < l (7), so ans increases by 1, and sum is set to r (7). \n\nThen, returning 7 to its parent (node 1). \n\nThen, node 2's dfs: it has no children. \n\nsum is 0. \n\nIf its l is 3, then 0 <3 \u2192 ans increases by 1, set sum to r (3). \n\nThen, returning 3 to node 1. \n\nNow, node 1's children are 2 and 3. \n\nThe sum from children is 3 (from node 2) +7 (from node3) \u2192 10? \n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum in the dfs function is the sum of the returns from the children. \n\nWait, the code's dfs function for node 1 would process each child (2 and 3). \n\nFor each child, it calls dfs(child, ...) and adds the return value to sum. \n\nSo for node 1's children, the sum is 3 (from node2) +7 (from node3) \u2192 10. \n\nThen, node1's l and r: suppose l is 5 (since a1 ends up at 5). \n\nIf node1's l is 5, then sum (10) is >=5. So we set sum to min(r_v, 10). \n\nAssuming r_v is 10 or higher, then the return is 10. \n\nThe ans would be 2 (from node2 and node3's increments). \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nSo the code's logic seems to work. \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is correct. \n\nNow, the missing part in the code is the part where the tree is built. \n\nThe loop for building the tree is:\n\nfor (int i{2};i<=n;i++){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nThe grid is a vector of vectors, where grid[p] contains all children of p. \n\nThe input for the parents is given as p_2, p_3, ..., p_n. \n\nSo for each i from 2 to n, the parent p_i is read, and then we add i to grid[p_i]. \n\nThus, the code for the TODO block should be:\n\nint p;\n\ncin >> p;\n\ngrid[p].push_back(i);\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nint p; \n\ncin >> p; \n\ngrid[p].push_back(i);\n\nWait, but the loop is for i from 2 to n. The first line of the test case's second line has n-1 numbers, which are p_2, p_3, ..., p_n. \n\nSo for i starting at 2, the first p is p_2, then p_3, etc. \n\nThus, the code inside the loop is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is those three lines. \n\nNow, the code's dfs function may have some issues. Let me check again. \n\nWait, in the code's dfs function, the parameters are:\n\nvector<vector<int>>& grid, int *ans, vector<pair<int, int>>& a. \n\nThe function is called with grid, the address of ans, and a. \n\nThe function returns a long long. \n\nThe code for the dfs function:\n\nsum is initialized to 0. \n\nThen, for each child in grid[n], it adds the dfs(child, ...) to sum. \n\nThen, if sum < a[n].first (l_v), then ans is incremented, and sum is set to a[n].second (r_v). \n\nElse, sum is set to min(a[n].second, sum). \n\nWait, but why set sum to min(r_v, sum)? \n\nBecause the a_v must be <= r_v. \n\nThe sum is the total contribution from the children's required contributions. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the current node's a_v can't exceed r_v. \n\nSo, the minimal required a_v is max(l_v, sum_children). \n\nWait, but the code's logic is that the sum is the sum of the children's returns. \n\nWait, perhaps the return value of the dfs function is the minimal required value that the current node must have. \n\nWait, the sum is the sum of the children's returns. \n\nWait, perhaps the children's returns are the minimal required contributions from their parent (the current node). \n\nSo the current node must contribute at least sum (the sum of the children's required contributions). \n\nBut the current node's a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. \n\nSo the minimal a_v for the current node is the maximum between sum and l_v. \n\nBut since a_v can't exceed r_v, the maximum possible a_v is min(r_v, ...). \n\nWait, perhaps the return value is the minimal a_v that the current node can have, given the constraints. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose the current node's a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. \n\nThe sum is the total required contribution from the current node's side (from the children's requirements). \n\nIf sum < l_v, then the current node must have a_v at least l_v. To achieve this, we need to add an operation that increases the current node's a_v by (l_v - sum). But since the operation's c must be non-decreasing, this can be done in one step. \n\nWait, but how does this translate into the code's logic? \n\nThe code increments ans by 1 (the number of operations needed here). \n\nThen, the new a_v is set to r_v (a[n].second). \n\nWait, why r_v? \n\nAh, perhaps the idea is that when we add an operation, we can set the current node's a_v to its maximum possible (r_v), so that it can cover as much as possible for the parent nodes. \n\nWait, but the operation's c array must be non-decreasing. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is to greedily set the current node's a_v to the maximum possible (r_v) whenever possible, to minimize the number of operations. \n\nAlternatively, the return value is the minimal possible value that the current node can have, given that we've already satisfied the children's constraints. \n\nWait, the return value is the minimal a_v that the current node can have, such that all children's constraints are satisfied. \n\nWait, the sum is the sum of the children's returns. \n\nThe children's returns are the minimal required contributions from their parent (current node). \n\nThus, the current node must have a_v at least sum. \n\nBut also, a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nSo the minimal a_v is max(sum, l_v). \n\nBut since a_v can't exceed r_v, the maximum possible is min(r_v, ...). \n\nWait, but the code's logic is: \n\nif sum < l_v \u2192 then we need to add an operation. \n\nThe ans is increased by 1. \n\nThen, the new sum is set to r_v. \n\nElse, the sum is set to min(r_v, sum). \n\nWait, why set to r_v in that case? \n\nBecause when sum < l_v, the current node's a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nBut the minimal way to do this is to set a_v to exactly l_v? \n\nBut the code sets it to r_v. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to maximize the contribution to the parent nodes. \n\nBecause if the current node's a_v is set to r_v, then the parent can have a higher value, which might reduce the number of operations needed for the parent. \n\nAh, this is a greedy approach. By choosing to set the current node's a_v to the maximum possible (r_v), we can cover as much as possible for the parent's required value, thus minimizing the number of operations needed for the parent. \n\nSo the logic is: \n\nIf the current node's required a_v (sum from children) is less than l_v, then we must add an operation. The operation's contribution to this node is (l_v - sum) or more. But to maximize the contribution to the parent, we set the a_v to r_v (the maximum possible), so that the parent can have a higher value. \n\nThus, the ans is increased by 1, and the return value is r_v. \n\nOtherwise, the a_v can be set to the minimum between sum and r_v. \n\nWait, but why the minimum between sum and r_v? \n\nBecause the a_v can't exceed r_v. \n\nWait, the sum is the sum of the children's required contributions. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum is the minimal required a_v from the children's perspective. \n\nWait, the children's returns are the minimal required a_v for their parent (current node). \n\nThus, the current node's a_v must be at least the sum of the children's returns. \n\nWait, no, the children's returns are the minimal required contributions from their parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum is the total required contribution from the current node to its children. \n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is correct as per the examples, so perhaps the missing code is just the part where the tree is built. \n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO block is:\n\nint p;\ncin >> p;\ngrid[p].push_back(i);\n\nSo the code for the loop is:\n\nfor (int i{2};i<=n;i++){\n    int p;\n    cin >> p;\n    grid[p].push_back(i);\n}\n\nThat's the missing part. \n\nNow, I need to make sure that the rest of the code is correct. \n\nThe dfs function's logic may have some issues, but according to the examples, it works. \n\nWait, in the first example, the node 2's a_v must be at least 2. \n\nThe sum from its children (none) is 0. \n\n0 < 2 \u2192 ans increases by 1, and returns r_v (3). \n\nThen, node 1's sum is 3 (from node2's return). \n\nNode1's l is 1. 3 >=1 \u2192 so set sum to min(r_v (say 5), 3). \n\nThus, returns 3. \n\nThe total ans is 1, which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: \n\nSuppose node 3's l is 7. \n\nThe code for node3 would have sum 0 <7 \u2192 ans increases by 1, returns 7. \n\nNode2's l is 3, sum 0 \u2192 ans increases by 1, returns 3. \n\nNode1's sum is 3+7=10. \n\nIf node1's l is 5, then 10 >=5 \u2192 returns min(r_v, 10). \n\nThus, ans is 2, which matches the example. \n\nTherefore, the code's logic is correct. \n\nThus, the only missing code is the part where the tree is built. \n\nSo the answer is the code for the TODO block."
