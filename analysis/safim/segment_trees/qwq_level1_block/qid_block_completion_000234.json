Hmm, the code provided seems to be trying a certain approach. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. The problem states that each member not invited adds their a_i to the unhappiness. The cakes are the number of friend pairs where both are invited. The total cakes must be even. We need to minimize the total unhappiness under this constraint. The given code's approach might be using some graph-based method. Let me look at the code structure.",

Wait, degree here isn't the actual degree, because XOR 1 is flipping a bit. Oh right, maybe they're tracking the parity of the number of edges each node is in? Because each edge contributes to two nodes, so the degree here is the parity (even or odd number of edges connected). Wait, the code uses deg[edge[i].first] ^=1 and same for the second. So for each edge, each node's deg is flipped. So after processing all edges, deg[i] is 1 if the node has an odd number of edges, 0 if even. Because each edge contributes to two nodes, so the sum of all deg[i] must be even? Not sure, but maybe that's part of the logic here. The code then checks if m is even. If so, it prints 0. Wait, why?

So if m is even, then that's acceptable. But if m is odd, then we need to change the number of edges by an odd number. To do that, we can remove one node. The number of edges removed would be equal to the number of edges connected to that node. So, if the node has an odd degree, then removing it would subtract an odd number of edges, changing the parity. Alternatively, removing a node with even degree would subtract an even number, not changing the parity. Therefore, to flip the parity from odd to even, we need to remove a node with an odd degree. Alternatively, adding or removing a node can change the parity. Wait, the total number of edges in the selected subset (all invited) is m. If m is odd, we need to make it even. To do this, we can remove a node that is part of an odd number of edges. Because removing that node would subtract the number of edges connected to it (its degree). If the degree is odd, then subtracting an odd number from m (which is odd) would give even. Alternatively, adding a node (but that's not possible since we are removing). Alternatively, the minimal cost would be the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. Wait, but the problem requires that the total number of edges in the selected subset is even. So, if the current total (all invited) is odd (m is odd), then we need to make it even. To do this, we can either: \n\n1. Remove one node with an odd degree.

Option 1: Remove a single node with odd degree. The number of edges removed is its degree (odd), so m - odd becomes even. Cost is a_i. Option 2: Remove two nodes connected by an edge. The number of edges removed would be the edges connected to both nodes, but this might be complicated. Alternatively, flipping the selection of two nodes (i and j) connected by an edge. Suppose both were invited. If we remove both, then the edge between them is no longer counted. But other edges connected to them are also removed.

Therefore, the code's missing part should be: \n\ndap = min(dap, cost[edge[i].first]); \n\ndap = min(dap, cost[edge[i].second]); \n\nBecause for each such edge, either of the two nodes can be removed, and the minimal between them is a candidate.

First sample input (from note): \n\nSuppose all members are invited, and m is even. The code would output 0, which matches the first test case. Second test case: \n\nSuppose m is odd. The code would look for edges where the two nodes have the same parity. Suppose the edges are between nodes with odd degrees. The minimal between their a values would be considered. Then, the second loop would also consider nodes with odd degrees. The minimal between all these would be the answer. In the second test case's example, the minimal is 2.

But for edges with both even parity, removing one of them would subtract an even number of edges, so the total edges (m) would decrease by even, so the parity remains odd. Thus, that doesn't help. Hence, those edges are not useful. Therefore, the code's first loop is incorrect. Hmm, but perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the missing code in this C++ program. The problem is about finding the minimum unhappiness value while ensuring the number of cakes (which is the number of invited friend pairs) is even. \n\nHmm, the code provided seems to be trying a certain approach. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly. \n\nThe problem states that each member not invited adds their a_i to the unhappiness. The cakes are the number of friend pairs where both are invited. The total cakes must be even. We need to minimize the total unhappiness under this constraint.\n\nThe given code's approach might be using some graph-based method. Let me look at the code structure. \n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThey read n and m, then the cost array. Then for each edge, they read the pair and toggle (XOR 1) the degree array for each node. Wait, degree here isn't the actual degree, because XOR 1 is flipping a bit. Oh right, maybe they're tracking the parity of the number of edges each node is in? Because each edge contributes to two nodes, so the degree here is the parity (even or odd number of edges connected). \n\nWait, the code uses deg[edge[i].first] ^=1 and same for the second. So for each edge, each node's deg is flipped. So after processing all edges, deg[i] is 1 if the node has an odd number of edges, 0 if even. Because each edge contributes to two nodes, so the sum of all deg[i] must be even? Not sure, but maybe that's part of the logic here.\n\nThe code then checks if m is even. If so, it prints 0. Wait, why? Because if m is even, maybe the number of cakes can be even without any changes? Or perhaps the code is assuming that when m is even, the minimal is achievable by some configuration. But the problem requires the total cakes to be even. Wait, the cakes are the number of friend pairs where both are invited. The total cakes can be anything, but must be even. \n\nWait, the code's first check is if m is even, then output 0. That can't be right. For example, in the second sample input given in the problem's note, the first test case had all members invited, which gives 0 unhappiness. But maybe in that case m was even? Let me check the sample inputs. \n\nThe first note says in the first test case, all members are invited, so the unhappiness is 0. The number of cakes would be the number of friend pairs, which must be even. So if m was even, then that's okay. But if m was odd, then the code would have to adjust. \n\nWait, the code's logic here is that if m is even, then the minimal is 0? That might not be correct. Because even if m is even, maybe the optimal solution requires not inviting some people so that the number of cakes is even. Wait, no. Wait, the problem requires that the number of cakes (the count of friend pairs where both are invited) must be even. So if m is even, but the number of such pairs could be even or odd. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is using some graph-based method where the edges form components, and the parity of the edges in each component is considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to model this as a graph where each connected component's parity must be even. \n\nWait, looking at the code's variables: the deg array is being used to track something. Let me think again. \n\nThe code processes each edge by flipping the deg of each endpoint. So for each edge, the two nodes' deg is toggled. So after all edges, deg[i] is 1 if the node has an odd number of edges, 0 otherwise. \n\nWait, but the number of edges connected to a node is its degree. So the parity of the degree is stored in deg[i]. \n\nHmm, but how does that help? \n\nThe code then checks if m is even. If so, it outputs 0. That might be a mistake. Because even if m is even, the number of cakes (the number of edges in the selected subset of invited people) could be odd. So the code's logic here is probably incorrect. \n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges? Or perhaps the problem is being transformed into a parity problem on the graph's connected components. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to find a way to flip the parity of the total number of edges by flipping certain nodes. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the total number of cakes (edges between invited pairs) is even. So the total must be even. \n\nThe approach here might be to model this as a graph where each connected component's parity must be even. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is similar to the even matching problem where you have to choose a subset with even edges. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is using a greedy approach where the minimal unhappiness is achieved by either not inviting one person from an edge, or something like that. \n\nLooking at the code's structure after the m%2==0 check: \n\nIf m is even, it outputs 0. But that's probably wrong. For example, in the second test case in the problem's note, the first case might have m even, but the code would output 0, which matches the sample. But in the second test case, the sample input's second case probably has m odd. Let me think. \n\nThe second test case in the note has members 1,2,3. The possible options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (since they are friends? Or maybe they are not friends. Wait the note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 1 and 2 (0 cakes eaten). So perhaps the friend pairs are such that 1-2 and 2-3 are friends. Then m would be 2, which is even. But the sample output is 2. Wait, that contradicts the code's logic. \n\nWait, the second test case in the note's example must have m odd. Let me recheck the note. \n\nThe note says in the second test case, the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The cakes eaten would be 0 if they are not friends. Wait, maybe the friend pairs are 1-2 and 1-3. Then the number of cakes when inviting 2 and 3 is zero. So the total cakes is zero, which is even. \n\nBut the problem requires that the total cakes must be even. So in that case, the code's approach of outputting 0 when m is even would not work here. Because in that case, m is 2 (even), but the minimal unhappiness is 2, not 0. \n\nSo the code's logic is wrong. Therefore, the code must have a different approach. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is being transformed into a graph where each connected component's parity must be even. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges, and the minimal cost is found by flipping certain nodes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is using a parity-based approach where each connected component's parity must be even. \n\nWait, let me think of the problem again. The key is that the number of cakes (edges between invited pairs) must be even. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited, so we want to invite as many as possible (since a_i could be zero, but not necessarily). \n\nThe problem is similar to selecting a subset S of nodes such that the number of edges within S is even, and the sum of a_i not in S is minimized. \n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with a graph where each connected component contributes to the parity. \n\nPerhaps the solution is to model the graph as connected components and for each component, decide whether to flip the parity. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be considered as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges in the selected subset. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into a minimum vertex cover-like problem with parity constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a bipartition of the graph's connected components. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal solution requires that the total number of edges in the selected subset is even. To achieve this, if the total number of edges in the selected subset is odd, we need to flip the selection of one node in a way that changes the parity. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be considered as follows: \n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of all a_i not invited. To minimize this, we want to invite as many as possible. However, the constraint is that the number of edges between invited nodes must be even. \n\nThis is similar to a parity constraint on the edges. \n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to model this as a graph where each connected component's contribution to the parity must be considered. \n\nSuppose the graph is divided into connected components. For each component, the selection of nodes must contribute an even number of edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each connected component can be considered as a tree, and the parity of the edges in the component's selected nodes must be even. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled using a parity-based dynamic programming approach on each connected component. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nThe problem can be viewed as choosing a subset S of nodes such that the number of edges within S is even. We need to choose S to minimize the sum of a_i not in S. \n\nTo model this, perhaps each connected component can be considered independently, and for each component, we can track the minimal cost for even and odd parities. \n\nThe total minimal cost would be the sum of the minimal costs for each component, ensuring that the total parity is even. \n\nWait, but the components are independent, so the total parity is the sum of the parities of each component's edges. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing for each component a parity (even or odd) such that the total is even, and the sum of their minimal costs is minimized. \n\nWait, but each component's contribution to the total parity is the number of edges in its selected subset. So the total parity is the sum mod 2 of all components' parities. \n\nTherefore, to have the total even, the number of components with odd parity must be even. \n\nHmm, but how do we model this? \n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, we can compute two values: the minimal cost when the component contributes an even number of edges, and the minimal cost when it contributes an odd number. \n\nThen, the overall problem is to choose for each component whether to take even or odd, such that the total number of odd components is even, and the sum of their costs is minimized. \n\nThis sounds feasible. \n\nSo the steps would be: \n\n1. Find all connected components in the graph. \n\n2. For each component, compute the minimal cost for even and odd parity. \n\n3. Combine these to find the minimal total cost where the number of components with odd parity is even. \n\nBut how do we compute the minimal cost for each component's even and odd parity? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps each connected component can be considered as a tree (or a graph), and the minimal cost for even and odd can be found via dynamic programming on the component. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node's inclusion affects the parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a minimum vertex cover with parity constraints. \n\nAlternatively, here's another approach inspired by the code given. \n\nLooking back at the code: \n\nThe code uses a deg array which is toggled for each edge's endpoints. \n\nWait, the code's deg array is being used to track the parity of the number of edges each node is part of. \n\nWait, but after processing all edges, deg[i] is 1 if the node has an odd number of edges, 0 otherwise. \n\nHmm, but how does that help? \n\nThe code then checks if m is even. If so, it outputs 0. But that's probably wrong. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as follows: \n\nThe total number of edges in the selected subset must be even. \n\nSuppose that the minimal solution is to invite all nodes except one, but that might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find a way to flip the parity by removing a node from an edge. \n\nWait, the code's loop after checking m%2 is even: \n\nIf m is odd, then the code proceeds to look for edges where the two endpoints have the same deg value. \n\nWait, the code's for loop over edges i from 1 to m: \n\nif deg[edge[i].first] == deg[edge[i].second], then do something. \n\nThen, after that, it loops over all nodes with deg[i] not zero (since deg[i] is 0 or 1?), and takes the minimum cost. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is as follows: \n\nThe problem requires that the number of edges in the selected subset is even. \n\nSuppose that the current selection (all nodes invited) has a certain parity. \n\nIf the total number of edges (m) is even, then the current selection (all invited) would have m edges, which is even. So the unhappiness is zero (if all a_i are zero). But in the problem's second test case, the minimal is 2, so perhaps the code's approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges in the selected subset. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the parity of the degrees in the graph. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find a way to flip the parity of the total edges by flipping the selection of a single node. \n\nWait, the code's approach when m is odd is to find the minimal cost between either flipping one node in an edge (thereby changing the parity of the number of edges by 1, making it even) or flipping two nodes (but that might not be necessary). \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity. \n\nWait, the code's logic after m is odd: \n\nIt loops through all edges and checks if the two endpoints have the same deg value. \n\nThen, in the next loop, it looks for nodes with deg[i] set and takes their cost. \n\nHmm, perhaps the deg array here is tracking something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the parity of the number of edges in each connected component. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to flip the parity of the total edges by either removing one node from an edge (thereby changing the number of edges by the number of edges that node was part of) or something else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost between removing one node from an edge (thereby changing the parity) or flipping the selection of a node in a way that changes the parity. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's deg array is tracking the parity of the number of edges in each connected component. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to model the problem as a graph where each connected component must have an even number of edges. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is using the following approach: \n\nThe problem requires that the number of edges in the selected subset is even. \n\nSuppose that the minimal solution is to select all nodes except for some nodes. \n\nThe code's approach might be to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity. \n\nIf the total number of edges in the current selection (all nodes invited) is even, then that's acceptable. \n\nIf it's odd, then we need to change it to even. To do this, we can either remove one node that is part of an odd number of edges, or flip the selection of two nodes, etc. \n\nAlternatively, the code's deg array is tracking the parity of the number of edges each node is part of. \n\nWait, the code's deg array is toggled for each edge's endpoints. So for each edge, the two nodes' deg is flipped. \n\nAfter processing all edges, the deg[i] is 1 if the node has an odd number of edges, 0 otherwise. \n\nWait, but the number of edges connected to a node is its degree. So the parity of the degree is stored in deg[i]. \n\nHmm, but how does that help? \n\nThe problem requires that the number of edges between invited nodes is even. \n\nSuppose that all nodes are invited. The number of edges is m. So if m is even, then that's acceptable. \n\nBut if m is odd, then we need to change the number of edges by an odd number. \n\nTo do that, we can remove one node. The number of edges removed would be equal to the number of edges connected to that node. \n\nSo, if the node has an odd degree, then removing it would subtract an odd number of edges, changing the parity. \n\nAlternatively, removing a node with even degree would subtract an even number, not changing the parity. \n\nTherefore, to flip the parity from odd to even, we need to remove a node with an odd degree. \n\nAlternatively, adding or removing a node can change the parity. \n\nWait, the total number of edges in the selected subset (all invited) is m. \n\nIf m is odd, we need to make it even. \n\nTo do this, we can remove a node that is part of an odd number of edges. \n\nBecause removing that node would subtract the number of edges connected to it (its degree). \n\nIf the degree is odd, then subtracting an odd number from m (which is odd) would give even. \n\nAlternatively, adding a node (but that's not possible since we are removing). \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost would be the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the total number of edges in the selected subset is even. \n\nSo, if the current total (all invited) is odd (m is odd), then we need to make it even. \n\nTo do this, we can either: \n\n1. Remove one node with an odd degree. This reduces the edge count by an odd number (since the node's degree is odd), so the total becomes even. \n\nOR \n\n2. Remove two nodes whose combined edges contribute an odd number. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost would be the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nBut also, there's another option: instead of removing a node with odd degree, perhaps flipping the selection of two nodes connected by an edge. \n\nWait, but flipping the selection of two nodes (i.e., not inviting them) would subtract all edges connected to them. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum between the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree, and the minimal a_i + a_j for an edge (i,j) where both have even degrees. \n\nWait, the code's approach seems to be considering edges where the two endpoints have the same deg value. \n\nLooking back at the code's loop: \n\nfor(i=1;i<=m;i++){ \n\n    if(deg[edge[i].first] == deg[edge[i].second]){ \n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n    } \n\n} \n\nThen, after that, it loops over nodes with deg[i] and takes their cost. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal between two options: \n\nEither remove one node with odd degree (cost a_i), or remove both nodes in an edge where their degrees are the same (so that the parity flips). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degree) and the minimal (a_x + a_y) for edges where the two nodes have the same degree. \n\nBecause, in that case, removing both nodes would subtract an even number of edges (since each had their degrees, but their sum might be even). \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal cost between these two options. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose the current total edges is m (odd). We need to make it even. \n\nOption 1: Remove a single node with odd degree. The number of edges removed is its degree (odd), so m - odd becomes even. \n\nCost is a_i. \n\nOption 2: Remove two nodes connected by an edge. The number of edges removed would be the edges connected to both nodes, but this might be complicated. \n\nAlternatively, flipping the selection of two nodes (i and j) connected by an edge. \n\nSuppose both were invited. If we remove both, then the edge between them is no longer counted. But other edges connected to them are also removed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degree) and the minimal (a_i + a_j - a_i - a_j + ... no, not sure). \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to consider edges where the two endpoints have the same degree parity. \n\nWait, the code's loop over edges where deg[u] == deg[v]. \n\nSuppose that for such an edge, if we remove one of the nodes, then the parity of their degrees would change. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost between removing one node (cost a_i) or removing both nodes (cost a_i + a_j). \n\nWait, but how does that affect the parity? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal cost between the two options: \n\nEither remove one node with odd degree (cost a_i), or remove an edge's two nodes (cost a_i + a_j) where their degrees are the same. \n\nWait, but why would their degrees being the same matter? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find edges where the two nodes have the same parity (deg[u] == deg[v]). \n\nIn that case, removing both nodes would change the parity by (degree_u + degree_v - 2*edges_between_them). Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find edges where the two nodes have the same parity, so that removing one of them would flip the parity. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degree) and the minimal (a_u + a_v) for edges where the two nodes have the same parity. \n\nBecause, in that case, removing both nodes would subtract an even number of edges (since their degrees are both even or both odd). \n\nWait, if both have even degrees, then their combined edges would be even + even = even. \n\nIf both have odd degrees, their combined edges would be odd + odd = even. \n\nSo, removing both nodes would subtract an even number of edges, which would not change the parity (since m is odd, subtract even gives odd again). \n\nHmm, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps removing one of them would subtract an odd number (if their degree is odd), so flipping the parity. \n\nWait, the code's approach is to loop over edges where the two endpoints have the same deg value. \n\nWait, the deg array here is the parity of the node's degree. \n\nSuppose that for an edge (u, v), if deg[u] == deg[v], then the edge's contribution to the parity is even? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find edges where the two nodes have the same parity, so that flipping one of them would change the parity. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degree) and the minimal (a_u + a_v - a_u - a_v + ... no, perhaps the minimal between a_u and a_v for such edges. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal cost between removing one node (cost a_i) or removing one of the two nodes in an edge where their degrees are the same. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degree) and the minimal (a_u or a_v) for edges where the two nodes have the same parity. \n\nWait, the code's loop over edges where deg[u] == deg[v], and in that case, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum between a_u and a_v. \n\nSo, in the code's missing part, perhaps they are trying to track the minimal between the two nodes in such edges. \n\nThe code's dap is initialized to 2e9. \n\nThen, for each edge where the two nodes have the same deg value, they might compute the minimum between the two nodes' a values and update dap. \n\nWait, but the code's current code after the for loop over edges is: \n\nfor(i=1;i<=m;i++){ \n\n    if(deg[edge[i].first] == deg[edge[i].second]){ \n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n    } \n\n} \n\nThen, after that, they loop over all nodes with deg[i] set (i.e., those with odd degree) and take the minimal a_i. \n\nWait, but the code's final dap is the minimum between the edges' minimal (from the first loop) and the nodes' minimal (from the second loop). \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal between the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree, and the minimal a_u or a_v for edges where the two nodes have the same parity. \n\nWait, but why would that be the case? \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal cost between two options: \n\nEither remove a single node with odd degree (cost a_i), or remove one of the two nodes in an edge where the two nodes have the same parity (so that the parity is flipped). \n\nWait, but removing one node from such an edge would subtract its degree (which is either even or odd, depending on the parity). \n\nSuppose the two nodes have the same parity. \n\nIf their parity is even (deg is 0), then their degrees are even. Removing one would subtract an even number of edges, so the total edges (m) would decrease by even, so parity remains odd. Not helpful. \n\nIf their parity is odd (deg is 1), then their degrees are odd. Removing one would subtract an odd number, so m - odd becomes even. \n\nAh! So in this case, for edges where both nodes have odd degree (deg is 1), removing either node would flip the parity. \n\nSo the cost would be the a_i of either node. \n\nTherefore, for such edges, the minimal cost between the two nodes' a values is a candidate. \n\nTherefore, the code's missing part should be: \n\ndap = min(dap, cost[edge[i].first]); \n\ndap = min(dap, cost[edge[i].second]); \n\nBecause for each such edge, either of the two nodes can be removed, and the minimal between them is a candidate. \n\nThen, after processing all such edges, the code also considers the nodes with odd degree (the second loop). \n\nWait, but the second loop is: \n\nfor(i=1;i<=n;i++) if(deg[i]) { \n\n    dap = min(dap, cost[i]); \n\n    deg[i] = 0; \n\n} \n\nThis is taking the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. \n\nSo the overall dap is the minimum between the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degree, and the minimal a_u or a_v for edges where the two nodes have the same parity (i.e., both odd or both even). \n\nWait, but why would edges with both even parity be considered? \n\nWait, if the two nodes have even parity (deg is 0), then their degrees are even. Removing one would subtract an even number of edges, so the total edges (m) would decrease by even, so the parity remains odd. So that's not helpful. \n\nTherefore, only edges where both nodes have odd parity (deg is 1) are useful. \n\nHence, in the first loop over edges, we only consider edges where both nodes have deg 1. \n\nWait, but the code's condition is deg[u] == deg[v], which includes both cases (both 0 or both 1). \n\nSo the code's first loop is considering edges where both nodes have the same parity. \n\nBut only edges where both have odd parity (1) are useful. \n\nHmm, but the code's current approach is to consider all edges where the two nodes have the same parity. \n\nSo for edges where both have even parity (0), the code would consider their a values, but removing one of them would subtract an even number of edges, which doesn't help. \n\nTherefore, those edges are not useful. \n\nHence, the code's approach might have a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and the edges with both even parity are not useful, but the code still checks them. \n\nWait, but in the first loop, for edges where the two nodes have the same parity (either both even or both odd), the code is considering the minimal between their a values. \n\nBut for edges with both even parity, removing one of them would subtract an even number of edges, so the total edges (m) would decrease by even, so the parity remains odd. \n\nThus, that doesn't help. \n\nHence, those edges are not useful. \n\nTherefore, the code's first loop is incorrect. \n\nHmm, but perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's first loop is considering edges where the two nodes have the same parity, and the minimal between their a values is a candidate. \n\nThe second loop is considering nodes with odd parity (so their a_i is a candidate). \n\nThe minimal between all these candidates is the answer. \n\nWait, but why would edges with both even parity be considered? \n\nAh, perhaps the code is considering that removing both nodes would subtract an even number of edges (since their degrees are even). \n\nWait, if both nodes have even degrees, then their combined edges would be even + even = even. \n\nRemoving both would subtract even edges, so the total edges (m) would decrease by even, so parity remains odd. \n\nNot helpful. \n\nAlternatively, removing one node from such an edge would subtract an even number (since their degree is even), so the total edges would be m - even, which is still odd. \n\nThus, that's not helpful. \n\nHence, the edges with both even parity are not useful. \n\nTherefore, the code's first loop is including edges that are not useful, but perhaps the minimal a_i among nodes with odd parity is sufficient. \n\nWait, but the code's first loop is trying to find edges where the two nodes have the same parity. \n\nPerhaps the code is trying to find edges where the two nodes have the same parity, and then the minimal between their a values is a candidate. \n\nThe minimal between the two nodes' a values would be better than taking either one individually. \n\nWait, for example, if the two nodes have a_i and a_j, then the minimal between them is better than taking the node with higher a. \n\nSo, for edges where both nodes have odd parity (so removing either would flip the parity), the minimal between the two is a better option than taking the individual node's a_i. \n\nHence, the code's first loop is trying to find the minimal a between the two nodes in such edges, and the second loop is considering the individual nodes. \n\nTherefore, the code's first loop should be: \n\nfor each edge where deg[u] == deg[v], then we can consider the minimal between a_u and a_v as a candidate. \n\nHence, in the missing code block, we need to compute the minimum between the two nodes' a values and update dap. \n\nSo the code should be: \n\ndap = min(dap, min(cost[edge[i].first], cost[edge[i].second]));\n\nSo, inside the if statement, we do that. \n\nThen, after processing all edges, the dap is the minimum between all such edge candidates and the individual nodes with odd degree. \n\nHence, the missing code is: \n\ndap = min(dap, min(cost[edge[i].first], cost[edge[i].second]));\n\nSo that's the code to fill in the TODO block. \n\nLet me check with the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input (from note): \n\nSuppose all members are invited, and m is even. \n\nThe code would output 0, which matches the first test case. \n\nSecond test case: \n\nSuppose m is odd. \n\nThe code would look for edges where the two nodes have the same parity. \n\nSuppose the edges are between nodes with odd degrees. \n\nThe minimal between their a values would be considered. \n\nThen, the second loop would also consider nodes with odd degrees. \n\nThe minimal between all these would be the answer. \n\nIn the second test case's example, the minimal is 2. \n\nAssuming that the code's approach would find that. \n\nHence, the missing code is to set dap to the minimum between its current value and the minimum of the two nodes' a values for edges where the two nodes have the same parity. \n\nTherefore, the correct code for the TODO block is: \n\ndap = min(dap, min(cost[edge[i].first], cost[edge[i].second]));\n\nSo that's the missing code."
