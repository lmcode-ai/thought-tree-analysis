Wait, but in the code's current structure, when j=1, parent[j] is not set. This suggests that the code has a bug.",

This requires one operation, so ans increases by 1. Then, the parent's sum must be increased by this delta. So, in the code's if block, we do:\n\nans += (low[j] - sum[j]) / something? Wait, no. Because each such deficit requires exactly one operation. Wait, the delta is (low[j] - sum[j]). But each operation can contribute this delta in one step. Wait, the operation's c array must be non-decreasing. Suppose we choose to do an operation that ends at j. \n\nThe c array for this operation must be non-decreasing. The last element (c_k) is the contribution to node j. \n\nThe previous elements must be <= c_k. To contribute exactly delta to node j, the minimal way is to set c_k = delta, and the previous elements can be anything as long as they are <= delta. But to maximize the contribution to the parent, we can set all previous elements to delta. Wait, but that would mean that the parent's contribution is also delta. Therefore, the parent's required sum must be increased by delta. So, in the code's if block, we do:\n\nans += 1; \n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]); Wait, but that would be adding the delta to the parent's sum. Wait, but in the code's else clause, it's adding min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent. Hmm, perhaps the code's sum array is the amount that needs to be pushed up to the parent. Wait, let me think again. The code's current structure is:\n\nfor each node j from n down to 1:\n\n   if low[j] > sum[j]:\n\n       // do something here, probably adding to ans and pushing to parent\n\n   else:\n\n       sum[parent[j]] += min(sum[j], high[j]); So, in the else case, the sum[j] is the amount that can be \"pushed\" up to the parent. Wait, perhaps the sum[j] represents the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. So, when the current sum[j] is less than l_j, we need to add an operation that contributes (l_j - sum[j]) to this node. This requires one operation, so ans increases by 1. Then, the parent's required contribution must be increased by (l_j - sum[j]). Therefore, in the if block:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nBut also, the current node's sum is now set to low[j], so the remaining sum[j] is now low[j]. Wait, but how does that fit into the code's variables? Alternatively, after adding the delta to the parent's sum, the current node's sum is now set to low[j]. Wait, perhaps the sum[j] is updated to low[j], but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the sum[j] remains as it is, but the parent's sum is increased by the delta. Hmm, perhaps the code's sum array is the amount that needs to be \"pushed\" up to the parent. Wait, let me think of the first sample again. Processing node 2 first:\n\nsum[2] is 0. \n\nlow[2] is 2. So, 2>0 \u2192 enter the if block. We need to add (2-0) =2 to the parent's sum. So, ans increases by 1. \n\nsum[parent[2]] (which is 1) += 2. Then, when processing node 1:\n\nsum[1] is now 2. \n\nlow[1] is 1, which is less than 2 \u2192 enter else clause. sum[parent[1]] (which is undefined, but assuming parent[1] is 0 or something, but let's say it's not processed). Wait, but in the else clause, we add min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. Assuming that parent[1] is 0 (invalid), but perhaps the code is designed so that when j=1, the parent is not processed. Alternatively, perhaps the root's parent is itself, so when j=1, parent[j] is 1. In that case, when processing node 1, the code would add min(2, high[1]) to sum[1]. Suppose high[1] is at least 2, then sum[1] becomes 2 + 2 =4? Hmm, but in the first sample, the a1 is 1. Wait, this suggests that my current approach is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the sum array is the amount that needs to be added to the parent's path. Wait, perhaps the sum[j] represents the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path.",

So, when the current sum[j] is sufficient (>= l_j), then the maximum amount that can be pushed up to the parent is min(sum[j], r_j). Because the total contribution to v is sum[j] (from parent's path) plus any new operations. Wait, no. Alternatively, the sum[j] represents the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path.",

The minimal way is to add an operation that contributes exactly (low[j] - sum[j]) to this node. This requires one operation, so ans increases by 1. The contribution to the parent's path must be at least this amount. So, the parent's sum must be increased by (low[j] - sum[j]).

Wait, but the code's sum[j] is not modified here. Hmm, perhaps the sum[j] is not modified, but the parent's sum is increased. Wait, but the current node's sum is the required contribution from the parent's path.

Because the total contribution to j is sum[j] plus any new operations. Wait, perhaps the sum[j] is the amount that can be pushed up to the parent without exceeding the high[j]. So, when the current sum[j] is sufficient (>= l_j), then the maximum amount that can be pushed up to the parent is min(sum[j], high[j]). Because pushing more would exceed the high[j]. Therefore, in the else clause, we add min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. This way, the parent's contribution is increased by this amount, but not exceeding the high[j]. So, in the if block, when we have to add an operation, the delta is (low[j] - sum[j]). This delta must be added to the parent's sum. But also, the total contribution to j is sum[j] + delta = low[j], which is within the l_j and r_j. Therefore, the code's if block should be:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]); So the missing code is:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nBut also, what about the upper limit r_j? The problem states that the a_v must be <= r_v. So, when we add the delta, the total contribution to j is low[j], which must be <= r_j. The problem's input ensures that this is possible. Therefore, the code's if block is correct. Now, the code's else clause adds min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. This ensures that the parent's contribution doesn't exceed the high[j]. Therefore, the code's missing part is the two lines in the if block. So, the code should be filled as:\n\nif (low[j] > sum[j]) {\n    ans += 1;\n    sum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n}\n\nElse, the code proceeds as before. Wait, but what about the case where the parent is the root (node 1), and parent[j] is 1's parent (which is none)? In the code's parent array, parent[1] is not set. But in the problem's input, the root is 1, so its parent is none. Therefore, when j=1, parent[j] is not set. But in the code's loop, when j=1, the code accesses parent[j], which is parent[1], which is uninitialized. This is a bug. However, in the problem's constraints, the root is 1, so when processing node 1, its parent is not present.",

But since the problem requires to fill in the missing code, perhaps the parent array is properly initialized. Alternatively, perhaps the code's parent array is initialized with parent[1] = 0, and in the code's loop, when j=1, parent[j] is 0, so adding to sum[0] which is out of bounds. This is a problem. But given that the problem requires to complete the code, perhaps the code's parent array is properly handled. Assuming that the parent array is correctly set, the missing code is the two lines in the if block. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nSo, the code's if block should have those two lines. Testing this with the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=2, parent[2]=1. \n\nlow[2] =2, sum[2] is 0. So, entering the if block:\n\nans becomes 1. \n\nsum[parent[2]] (sum[1]) += 2. Then, processing node 1:\n\nsum[1] is 2. \n\nlow[1] is 1, which is less than 2. So, enter else clause. sum[parent[1]] (parent[1] is 1's parent, which is not set. Assuming parent[1] is 0, then sum[0] is accessed, which is out of bounds. Hmm, this is a problem. But perhaps the root's parent is itself, so parent[1] =1. Then, when processing node 1, parent[j] is 1. So, sum[1] += min(2, high[1]). Suppose high[1] is >=2, then sum[1] becomes 2 + 2 =4. But the a1 in the sample is 1. This suggests that the algorithm is not correct. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, the sum array is the amount that must be pushed up to the parent.",

But since the code is given as is, perhaps the problem's test cases don't have this issue. Alternatively, the root's parent is itself, so when j=1, parent[j] is 1. Then, the else clause adds min(sum[1], high[1]) to sum[1]. So, sum[1] += min(2, high[1]). If high[1] is >=2, then sum[1] becomes 2 +2 =4. But the sample's a1 is 1. This suggests that the algorithm is incorrect. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the algorithm. Alternatively, the sum array represents the required contribution from the parent's path. When processing node 1 (the root), the parent is none, so there is no contribution from the parent's path. Therefore, the sum[1] is the required contribution from the root's path (which is itself). Wait, perhaps the sum array is initialized to 0 for all nodes.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this C++ code for the given problem. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a rooted tree where each node has a number a_v that must be between l_v and r_v. The operations allowed are choosing a vertex v, then selecting a non-decreasing array c of non-negative integers along the path from root (1) to v. Each step in the operation adds c_i to the nodes along that path. The goal is to find the minimum number of such operations needed so that all a_v meet their l and r constraints.\n\nHmm, the key here is to model the required increments in a way that can be optimized with the minimal steps. Since each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, this suggests that each operation contributes a certain \"profile\" along the path. \n\nThe approach probably involves some greedy method. Let me think of the constraints. Since each operation's c is non-decreasing, the increments along the path from root to v must be such that each step's c_i is at least the previous. So, perhaps we can model the required increments in a way that each step's contribution can be represented as a difference between some variables.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a problem where for each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The operations can be thought of as adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. To minimize the number of operations, we need to find the minimal number of such sequences that can cover the required a_v's within their constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this using a greedy approach where we process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). Let me think of the example given. \n\nIn the first test case, the solution uses one operation on v=2 with c=[1,2]. The a1 becomes 1, a2 becomes 2. The constraints must have been l1 <=1 <= r1 and l2 <=2 <=r2. \n\nThe code provided has a loop from j = n down to 1. For each node j, it checks if low[j] > sum[j]. The sum array probably represents the current total required for node j. Wait, maybe sum[j] is the accumulated required value that needs to be achieved through the operations. \n\nWait, the code's variables are sum and ans. The ans is the count of operations. The sum array might be tracking the deficit or surplus needed. Let me think again.\n\nThe code's structure is:\n\nInitialize sum and ans. Then, for each j from n down to 1:\n\nIf low[j] > sum[j], then we need to do something here. The else part adds sum[j] (or min with high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the sum array is tracking the required \"additional\" amount that must be contributed by operations that pass through this node. \n\nWait, maybe the approach is similar to the problem where you have to cover certain requirements with non-decreasing increments. Let me think of each node's required a_v as the sum of all c_i's along paths that include it. Since each operation's c is non-decreasing, the contribution to a node's a_v is the sum of all c's from operations that include it in their path. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the required a_v as the sum of certain variables. Let me think of each operation as contributing a certain value along a path. Since the c array must be non-decreasing, each operation's contribution along the path can be represented as a sequence where each step is at least the previous. \n\nThis reminds me of the problem where you have to cover a set of numbers with non-decreasing sequences, and you want the minimal number of such sequences. \n\nWait, here's an idea: For each node, the required a_v must be between l_v and r_v. Let's process the nodes in post-order (children before parents). For each node, the minimal required is l_v. The sum array might represent the deficit that needs to be covered by operations that end at this node. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times we have to \"jump\" in the required increments along the path from the root to each node. \n\nSuppose we process each node in reverse order (from leaves to root). For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The sum array might track the current \"base\" that needs to be added. \n\nWait, let me think of the variables. Let's say for each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. The operations can be thought of as adding a non-decreasing sequence along a path. \n\nSuppose we model the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of each operation as contributing a certain amount to the path. Let me think of the variables in terms of the differences between the required a's along the path. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nEach operation's c array is non-decreasing. So, the total contribution to a node along the path is the sum of all c_i's from operations that include it. \n\nTo model this, perhaps we can represent the required a_v as the sum of some variables, and the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times we have to \"step up\" the required values along the path. \n\nWait, here's an idea from similar problems (like the problem of covering with non-decreasing sequences):\n\nSuppose we process the nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The minimal required is l_v. However, the a_v can't exceed r_v. \n\nThe key is that each operation's contribution to the path must form a non-decreasing sequence. So, the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times the required increments \"jump\" in a way that can't be covered by a single non-decreasing sequence. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of the required a_v as the sum of the c's from all operations that pass through v. \n\nSuppose we model the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of the variables as the \"increments\" that each operation contributes. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the code's structure:\n\nThe code loops from n down to 1. For each node j, it checks if low[j] > sum[j]. If so, then we need to add some operations here. The else part adds sum[j] (or min with high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum array represents the deficit that needs to be covered by the parent nodes. Let me think step by step.\n\nSuppose sum[j] is the amount that needs to be added to the path leading to j. \n\nWait, maybe the idea is that for each node, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The sum[j] is the amount that must be contributed by operations that pass through this node. \n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nWe start from the leaves. For a leaf node (except root), the required a_v must be at least l_v. Suppose the parent's contribution is already accounted for. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum array is tracking the required \"additional\" amount that must be added along the path to this node. \n\nLet me think of the algorithm as follows:\n\nWe process nodes in reverse order (from n down to 1). For each node j:\n\nThe current required a_j must be at least l_j. The sum[j] is the total required so far (from previous operations). \n\nIf the current sum[j] is less than l_j, then we need to make up the difference. The minimal way to do this is to add (l_j - sum[j]) to the current node. But since the operations must form non-decreasing sequences, this can be done in a way that requires some operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times the required increment exceeds the current sum, and how much we can carry over to the parent. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's sample:\n\nSuppose for each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The maximum possible contribution from the parent's path is limited by the r_v. \n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is similar to the greedy approach used in the problem where you have to cover a set of numbers with non-decreasing sequences. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of the variables as the \"increments\" added by each operation along the path. \n\nEach operation's c array is non-decreasing. So, the total contribution to node v is the sum of all c's from operations that include v in their path. \n\nSuppose we model the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of the variables as the \"increments\" added at each node along the path. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's solution approach:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is equal to the number of times the required a_v exceeds the current accumulated sum, plus the necessary adjustments. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's variables. The code has a sum array and ans. The loop is from n down to 1. \n\nIn the code's current structure, for each j:\n\nif low[j] > sum[j], then we need to do something here. The else part adds sum[j] (or min with high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the sum array represents the \"deficit\" that must be covered by the parent nodes. \n\nWait, let me think of the process step by step. \n\nSuppose we process nodes in reverse order (children first, then parents). \n\nFor node j, the required a_j must be at least l_j. The current sum[j] is the total contribution from all operations that have been accounted for so far. \n\nIf sum[j] is less than l_j, then we need to add some operations to cover the difference (l_j - sum[j]). However, since each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, the way to do this is to add this difference as part of an operation that ends at this node. \n\nBut how does this translate into the number of operations? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times the required a_v exceeds the current sum, and each such excess requires an operation. \n\nWait, let me think of the first sample input. \n\nSample 1:\n\nSuppose n=2. The parent of 2 is 1. \n\nThe l and r for node 1 and 2 must be such that after the operation, a1=1 and a2=2. \n\nIn the code's loop, processing j=2 first. \n\nsum[2] is initially 0. \n\nlow[2] is 2 (assuming the sample's first case). \n\nWait, in the first sample's note, the first test case's desired a1 and a2 are 1 and 2. So l1 must be <=1, and l2 <=2. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's sum array is tracking the required amount that must be added by operations that pass through this node. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's variables again. \n\nThe code initializes sum as all 0. \n\nThen, for each j from n down to 1:\n\nif low[j] > sum[j], then we need to do something here. \n\nElse, sum[parent[j]] += min(sum[j], high[j]). \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that the sum[j] is the amount that needs to be \"pushed\" up to the parent. \n\nWait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the problem's constraints:\n\nEach operation's c array is non-decreasing. So, the contribution to the root is c_1, to its child is c_2, etc. \n\nThe total contribution to node v is the sum of all c_k for all operations that include v in their path. \n\nTo model this, perhaps we can think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables, and the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of \"steps\" needed in the required increments along the path. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. Let me think of the variables as the \"increments\" added at each node along the path. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the problem's solution:\n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times the required a_v exceeds the current accumulated value, but considering the constraints of non-decreasing sequences. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the required a_v as the sum of some variables, and the minimal number of operations is the number of times we have to \"add a new step\" in the sequence. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from the problem's solution approach:\n\nThe problem can be modeled as follows. For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v and at most r_v. \n\nEach operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path from root to v. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the number of times the required a_v exceeds the current sum, but considering that each operation can contribute to multiple nodes along the path. \n\nWait, perhaps the solution is similar to the problem where you have to cover the required a_v with non-decreasing increments, and the minimal number of operations is the number of times you have to \"jump\" beyond the current maximum. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe process the nodes in post-order (children before parents). For each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The maximum possible contribution from the parent's path is limited by r_v. \n\nWait, here's a possible algorithm:\n\nInitialize an array delta for each node. \n\nWe process nodes from leaves to root. \n\nFor each node v:\n\nThe required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current delta[v] is the amount that needs to be added to v's path. \n\nThe minimal required is max(0, l_v - (sum of contributions from previous operations)). \n\nWait, perhaps the sum array in the code represents the current required deficit. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's variables again. \n\nThe code has sum and ans. \n\nIn the loop for j from n down to 1:\n\nif low[j] > sum[j], then we need to add (low[j] - sum[j]) to the current node. But how does this translate into operations? \n\nWait, perhaps the sum array is tracking the required \"additional\" amount that must be contributed by operations that pass through this node. \n\nSuppose that for node j, the required a_j must be at least l_j. The current sum[j] is the total contribution from all previous operations (those that have been processed so far). \n\nIf sum[j] < l_j, then we need to add (l_j - sum[j]) to the current node. However, since each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, this can be done by adding an operation that contributes this difference at node j. But this requires that the parent's contribution is at least this difference. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is determined by the number of times we have to \"add a new layer\" of increments. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample:\n\nSuppose that for each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. The minimal number of operations is the number of times the required a_v exceeds the current accumulated sum, but each such excess must be covered by an operation that contributes to the path up to v. \n\nThe key is that each operation's contribution along the path must be non-decreasing. So, the minimal number of operations is the number of times the required a_v exceeds the current sum, but each such operation can cover multiple nodes. \n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is as follows:\n\nWe process nodes in reverse order (from leaves to root). \n\nFor each node v:\n\nThe required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current sum[v] is the total contribution from all operations that have been accounted for so far. \n\nIf sum[v] < l_v, then we need to add (l_v - sum[v]) to the current node. However, since each operation's c array must be non-decreasing, this can be done by adding an operation that contributes this difference at v. But this requires that the parent's contribution is at least this difference. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is that the required deficit (l_v - sum[v]) must be covered by an operation that ends at v. \n\nEach such deficit requires an operation. \n\nBut how does this affect the parent nodes? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations is the number of times the required deficit (l_v - sum[v]) is positive, and each such deficit contributes to the parent's required sum. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's current structure. \n\nIn the code's loop:\n\nif (low[j] > sum[j]):\n\n   // TODO: Your code here\n\nelse:\n\n   sum[parent[j]] += min(sum[j], high[j]);\n\nSo, when the current sum is less than the required l_j, we have to do something here. \n\nPerhaps in that case, we need to add (low[j] - sum[j]) to the current node, which requires an operation. \n\nBut how does that translate into the ans variable? \n\nSuppose that whenever we have to add this deficit, we increment ans by 1. \n\nWait, but maybe it's not exactly that. Because the deficit could be covered by multiple operations. \n\nAlternatively, the deficit (l_j - sum[j]) must be covered by an operation that contributes exactly this amount at node j. \n\nBut since the c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to the parent must be at least this amount. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal way to cover the deficit is to add an operation that contributes exactly (l_j - sum[j]) at node j, but this requires that the parent's contribution is at least this. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of the first sample again. \n\nSample 1:\n\nn=2, parent[2] =1. \n\nSuppose l1=1, r1= something, l2=2, r2= something. \n\nProcessing j=2 first. \n\nsum[2] is 0. \n\nlow[2] (2) > sum[2] (0). So we enter the if block. \n\nWe need to add (2-0) =2. \n\nBut how does this translate into the ans? \n\nThe sample's solution uses one operation. So in this case, the code's ans would be incremented by 1 here. \n\nThen, after handling this, we have to add this to the parent's sum. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's missing part is:\n\nIn the if block, we calculate the required delta = low[j] - sum[j]. \n\nThen, we add this delta to the ans. \n\nBut also, we need to ensure that the parent's sum can accommodate this delta. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the code's sum array is tracking the required \"additional\" amount that must be contributed by the parent. \n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nWhen processing node j:\n\nIf the current sum[j] is less than l_j, then we need to add (l_j - sum[j]) to the current node. This requires an operation that contributes exactly this amount at node j. \n\nHowever, since the c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to the parent must be at least this amount. \n\nTherefore, the parent's required sum must be increased by this delta. \n\nWait, but how does this work? \n\nLet me think of the first sample again. \n\nFor node 2, the required delta is 2. \n\nWe add this to ans (so ans becomes 1). \n\nThen, we need to add this delta to the parent's (node 1) sum. \n\nSo sum[1] += 2. \n\nThen, when processing node 1, sum[1] is 2. \n\nlow[1] is 1, which is less than sum[1], so we proceed to the else clause. \n\nIn the else clause, we add min(sum[1], high[1]) to the parent of 1 (which is itself, since parent[1] is undefined, but in code, parent[1] is not set. Wait, in the code's input, parent array is initialized for 2 to n. So parent[1] is not set. \n\nWait, in the code's loop, for j from n down to 1, so when j=1, parent[j] is parent[1], which is not set. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. Wait, in the code's parent array, parent[1] is not initialized. Because in the input, the parent array is given for p_2 to p_n. So parent[1] is not set. \n\nWait, in the code's loop for reading parents:\n\nfor (int j = 2; j <=n; j++) { cin >> parent[j]; }\n\nSo parent[1] is not set. But in the code's loop, when j=1, parent[j] is parent[1], which is uninitialized. \n\nThis is a bug. But perhaps in the problem's setup, the root is 1, so its parent is itself? Or maybe the code has an error here. \n\nWait, the problem says the root is 1, so the parent of 1 is none. So in the code, perhaps parent[1] is not used except when j=1. \n\nWait, in the code's loop for j from n down to 1, when j=1, the code will access parent[1], which is not initialized. \n\nThis is a problem. So perhaps the code should have parent[1] = 0 or something. \n\nBut that's a separate issue. Let's assume that the code has a way to handle that. \n\nBack to the algorithm. \n\nSuppose that when we have to add delta = low[j] - sum[j], then we add this delta to ans. \n\nThen, we also need to add this delta to the parent's sum. \n\nWait, but in the else clause, the code adds sum[j] (or min with high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nWhen the current sum[j] is less than l_j, then the required delta is (l_j - sum[j]). \n\nThis delta must be added via an operation that ends at j. \n\nEach such operation contributes exactly delta to the current node. \n\nBut since the c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to the parent must be at least delta. \n\nTherefore, the parent's required sum must be increased by delta. \n\nSo, in this case, we add delta to ans, and then add delta to the parent's sum. \n\nWait, but how does that fit into the code's structure? \n\nAlternatively, the code's sum array is the amount that needs to be \"pushed\" up to the parent. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's else clause. \n\nIn the else clause, sum[parent[j]] += min(sum[j], high[j]). \n\nHmm, perhaps the sum[j] is the amount that needs to be added to the parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum array represents the required amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nSo, when processing node j:\n\nIf the current sum[j] (the required amount from the parent's path) is less than l_j, then we need to add an operation that contributes (l_j - sum[j]) to this node. \n\nThis requires an operation, so ans increases by 1. \n\nBut this operation's contribution to the parent must be at least (l_j - sum[j]). \n\nTherefore, the parent's required sum must be increased by (l_j - sum[j]). \n\nSo, in the code's if block, we do:\n\nans += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Because the delta is (low[j] - sum[j]), but each operation can contribute more than that. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of operations needed here is 1, because you can add exactly that delta in one operation. \n\nWait, in the first sample, the delta for node 2 is 2 (since low is 2, sum is 0). So ans increases by 1. \n\nThen, the parent (node 1) must have its sum increased by this delta (2). \n\nSo, after processing node 2, sum[1] += 2. \n\nThen, when processing node 1, sum[1] is 2. \n\nThe low[1] is 1, which is less than sum[1], so we go to the else clause. \n\nIn the else clause, we add min(sum[1], high[1]) to the parent of 1. \n\nBut parent[1] is undefined. \n\nHmm, perhaps the root's parent is itself, so adding to itself. \n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, when j=1, parent[j] is not set. \n\nThis suggests that the code has a bug. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parent array for node 1 is set to 0, but in the problem's input, it's not given. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nBut perhaps the code is correct in the way that when j=1, parent[j] is 0, so the code would not process it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should process nodes from n down to 1, but for j=1, the parent is 1's parent, which is none. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's parent array is 1-based, and for node 1, parent[1] is not set. \n\nBut in the code's loop, when j=1, parent[j] is accessed. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases don't have j=1's parent, so the code may have an error here. \n\nBut let's set that aside for now. \n\nBack to the algorithm. \n\nThe idea is that whenever the current sum[j] is less than l_j, we need to add an operation that contributes (l_j - sum[j]) to this node. \n\nThis requires one operation, so ans increases by 1. \n\nThen, the parent's sum must be increased by this delta. \n\nSo, in the code's if block, we do:\n\nans += (low[j] - sum[j]) / something? \n\nWait, no. Because each such deficit requires exactly one operation. \n\nWait, the delta is (low[j] - sum[j]). \n\nBut each operation can contribute this delta in one step. \n\nWait, the operation's c array must be non-decreasing. \n\nSuppose we choose to do an operation that ends at j. \n\nThe c array for this operation must be non-decreasing. \n\nThe last element (c_k) is the contribution to node j. \n\nThe previous elements must be <= c_k. \n\nTo contribute exactly delta to node j, the minimal way is to set c_k = delta, and the previous elements can be anything as long as they are <= delta. \n\nBut to maximize the contribution to the parent, we can set all previous elements to delta. \n\nWait, but that would mean that the parent's contribution is also delta. \n\nTherefore, the parent's required sum must be increased by delta. \n\nSo, in the code's if block, we do:\n\nans += 1; \n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nWait, but that would be adding the delta to the parent's sum. \n\nWait, but in the code's else clause, it's adding min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's sum array is the amount that needs to be pushed up to the parent. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nfor each node j from n down to 1:\n\n   if low[j] > sum[j]:\n\n       // do something here, probably adding to ans and pushing to parent\n\n   else:\n\n       sum[parent[j]] += min(sum[j], high[j]);\n\nSo, in the else case, the sum[j] is the amount that can be \"pushed\" up to the parent. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum[j] represents the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nSo, when the current sum[j] is less than l_j, we need to add an operation that contributes (l_j - sum[j]) to this node. \n\nThis requires one operation, so ans increases by 1. \n\nThen, the parent's required contribution must be increased by (l_j - sum[j]). \n\nTherefore, in the if block:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nBut also, the current node's sum is now set to low[j], so the remaining sum[j] is now low[j]. \n\nWait, but how does that fit into the code's variables? \n\nAlternatively, after adding the delta to the parent's sum, the current node's sum is now set to low[j]. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum[j] is updated to low[j], but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the sum[j] remains as it is, but the parent's sum is increased by the delta. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's sum array is the amount that needs to be \"pushed\" up to the parent. \n\nWait, let me think of the first sample again. \n\nProcessing node 2 first:\n\nsum[2] is 0. \n\nlow[2] is 2. \n\nSo, 2>0 \u2192 enter the if block. \n\nWe need to add (2-0) =2 to the parent's sum. \n\nSo, ans increases by 1. \n\nsum[parent[2]] (which is 1) += 2. \n\nThen, when processing node 1:\n\nsum[1] is now 2. \n\nlow[1] is 1, which is less than 2 \u2192 enter else clause. \n\nsum[parent[1]] (which is undefined, but assuming parent[1] is 0 or something, but let's say it's not processed). \n\nWait, but in the else clause, we add min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nAssuming that parent[1] is 0 (invalid), but perhaps the code is designed so that when j=1, the parent is not processed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the root's parent is itself, so when j=1, parent[j] is 1. \n\nIn that case, when processing node 1, the code would add min(2, high[1]) to sum[1]. \n\nSuppose high[1] is at least 2, then sum[1] becomes 2 + 2 =4? \n\nHmm, but in the first sample, the a1 is 1. \n\nWait, this suggests that my current approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum array is the amount that needs to be added to the parent's path. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum[j] represents the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nSo, when processing node j:\n\nIf the current sum[j] (the required contribution from the parent's path) is less than l_j, then we need to add an operation that contributes (l_j - sum[j]) to this node. \n\nThis requires one operation, so ans increases by 1. \n\nThe parent's required contribution must be increased by (l_j - sum[j]). \n\nSo, in the code's if block:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nThen, the current node's sum is now set to low[j], so the remaining sum[j] is now low[j]. \n\nWait, but how is that tracked? \n\nAlternatively, after adding the delta to the parent's sum, the current node's sum is now set to low[j], so the remaining sum[j] is now low[j]. \n\nBut in the code's variables, sum[j] is not modified in the if block. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's sum[j] is not modified in the if block, but the parent's sum is increased. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum array is the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nSo, for node j, the required a_j is the sum of all contributions from operations along its path. \n\nThe sum[j] is the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nSo, the total contribution to node j is sum[j] (from parent's path) plus any contributions from operations that end at j. \n\nWait, this is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a standard approach for this type of problem. \n\nThis problem resembles the problem where you have to cover a set of numbers with non-decreasing sequences, and find the minimal number of sequences. \n\nIn that problem, the minimal number of sequences is the number of times a new sequence must start because the current number is less than the previous. \n\nWait, here's an idea from that problem: \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the sum over all nodes of the number of times the required a_v exceeds the current accumulated value, but considering the path constraints. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: \n\nEach operation contributes a non-decreasing sequence along a path. \n\nThe total contribution to node v is the sum of all c_k for all operations that include v in their path. \n\nWe need to choose these c arrays such that for each v, l_v \u2264 sum(c's along path to v) \u2264 r_v. \n\nThe minimal number of operations is the minimal number of such c arrays needed. \n\nTo model this, perhaps we can think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables, and the minimal number of operations is determined by the \"steps\" needed in the required increments along the path. \n\nLet me think of the required a_v as the sum of some variables. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in post-order (children first). \n\nFor each node v, the required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe contribution from the parent's path is the sum of all c arrays that pass through the parent. \n\nThe minimal way to achieve this is to ensure that the contribution from the parent's path plus any new operations ending at v meets the requirement. \n\nThe key is that each new operation ending at v must contribute a non-decreasing sequence. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of operations is the number of times the required a_v exceeds the current contribution from the parent's path. \n\nWait, here's a possible algorithm inspired by this:\n\nInitialize an array required for each node. \n\nProcess nodes in post-order (children first). \n\nFor each node v:\n\nThe required a_v must be at least l_v. \n\nThe current contribution from the parent's path is the sum of all previous operations' contributions to v. \n\nLet current = sum of contributions from parent's path. \n\nIf current < l_v, then we need to add (l_v - current) to the current node. \n\nThis can be done by adding an operation that contributes exactly (l_v - current) at v. \n\nThis requires one operation. \n\nThe contribution to the parent's path is increased by this amount. \n\nHowever, since the c array must be non-decreasing, the contribution to the parent must be at least this amount. \n\nWait, so the parent's contribution must be increased by (l_v - current). \n\nThus, the parent's required contribution is increased by this amount. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize an array delta for each node. \n\nProcess nodes in post-order. \n\nFor node v:\n\ncurrent = delta[v] \n\nif current < l_v:\n\n   needed = l_v - current \n\n   ans += 1 \n\n   delta[parent[v]] += needed \n\n   delta[v] = l_v \n\nelse:\n\n   delta[parent[v]] += min(delta[v], r_v) \n\nWait, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the delta array represents the required contribution from the parent's path. \n\nWait, perhaps the delta array is the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nSo, for node v:\n\ndelta[v] is the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nThe total contribution to v is delta[v] plus any contributions from operations ending at v. \n\nWait, this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the code's variables. \n\nThe code has sum array. \n\nThe sum[j] represents the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nWhen processing node j:\n\nIf the current sum[j] (the required contribution from the parent) is less than l_j, then we need to add an operation that contributes (l_j - sum[j]) to this node. \n\nThis requires one operation (ans +=1). \n\nThe parent's required contribution must be increased by this amount. \n\nSo, sum[parent[j]] += (l_j - sum[j]). \n\nThen, the current node's contribution is now l_j. \n\nBut the sum[j] is not modified, but the parent's sum is. \n\nWait, but in the code's else clause, it adds min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the sum array is the amount that must be pushed up to the parent. \n\nSo, when the current sum[j] is less than l_j, we have to add an operation, and the parent's sum is increased by the needed delta. \n\nOtherwise, the parent's sum is increased by the current sum[j], but not exceeding the high[j]. \n\nWait, the high[j] is the upper limit for a_j. \n\nSo, the contribution from the parent's path plus any new operations must not exceed r_j. \n\nAh, right! The a_v must also be \u2264 r_v. \n\nSo, the code's else clause uses min(sum[j], high[j]). \n\nBecause the parent's contribution can't exceed the r_j. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum[j] is the amount that needs to be pushed up to the parent, but it can't exceed the r_j. \n\nSo, when the current sum[j] is sufficient (>= l_j), then the maximum amount that can be pushed up to the parent is min(sum[j], r_j). \n\nBecause the total contribution to v is sum[j] (from parent's path) plus any new operations. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the sum[j] represents the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nThe total contribution to v is sum[j] plus any contributions from operations ending at v. \n\nBut the total must be between l_j and r_j. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum[j] is the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nSo, the total contribution to v is sum[j] plus the contributions from operations ending at v. \n\nThe contributions from operations ending at v must be non-decreasing along the path. \n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. \n\nLet me try to think of the code's missing part. \n\nThe code's if block is when low[j] > sum[j]. \n\nIn this case, we need to do something to cover the deficit. \n\nThe minimal way is to add an operation that contributes exactly (low[j] - sum[j]) to this node. \n\nThis requires one operation, so ans increases by 1. \n\nThe contribution to the parent's path must be at least this amount. \n\nSo, the parent's sum must be increased by (low[j] - sum[j]). \n\nTherefore, in the if block:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nBut also, the current node's sum is now set to low[j], so the remaining sum[j] is now low[j]. \n\nWait, but the code's sum[j] is not modified here. \n\nHmm, perhaps the sum[j] is not modified, but the parent's sum is increased. \n\nWait, but the current node's sum is the required contribution from the parent's path. \n\nSo, after adding the delta to the parent's sum, the next time the parent is processed, its sum will include this delta. \n\nTherefore, the code's if block should be:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nBut also, the current node's sum is now sufficient (since we added the delta via the parent's contribution). \n\nWait, but the current node's sum is sum[j], which is the required contribution from the parent's path. \n\nAfter adding the delta to the parent's sum, when the parent is processed, its sum will be increased, which will contribute to this node's sum. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's sum array is the amount that must be pushed up to the parent. \n\nSo, when the current sum[j] is less than l_j, we need to add an operation, which contributes (low[j] - sum[j]) to this node. \n\nThis requires that the parent's path must contribute this amount. \n\nTherefore, the parent's sum is increased by this amount. \n\nThe ans is increased by 1. \n\nSo the code's missing part is:\n\nans += (low[j] - sum[j]) / something? \n\nNo, it's just ans +=1. \n\nWait, because each such deficit requires exactly one operation. \n\nYes, because the operation can contribute exactly the needed delta. \n\nSo the code's if block should be:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nBut also, the current node's sum is now sufficient. \n\nWait, but the current node's sum is sum[j], which is the required contribution from the parent's path. \n\nAfter adding the delta to the parent's sum, when the parent is processed, its sum will be increased, which will contribute to this node's sum. \n\nWait, but the current node's sum is not modified here. \n\nHmm, perhaps the sum array is the amount that must be pushed up to the parent. \n\nSo, when the current sum[j] is less than l_j, the required delta is (low[j] - sum[j]). \n\nThis delta must be added to the parent's sum. \n\nThe ans is increased by 1. \n\nThe current node's sum is now sufficient because the parent's contribution will now include this delta. \n\nTherefore, the code's if block should be:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nSo, the missing code is:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nBut also, what about the upper limit r_j? \n\nWait, the a_v must not exceed r_v. \n\nAh, right! The code's else clause uses min(sum[j], high[j]). \n\nSo, when the current sum[j] is sufficient (>= l_j), then the maximum amount that can be pushed up to the parent is min(sum[j], high[j]). \n\nBecause the total contribution to v is sum[j] plus any new operations. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe sum[j] is the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nThe total contribution to v is sum[j] plus the contributions from operations ending at v. \n\nBut the total must be <= r_j. \n\nTherefore, the parent's contribution (sum[j]) can't exceed r_j. \n\nHence, when pushing up to the parent, we can only push up to min(sum[j], r_j). \n\nAh, so in the else clause, the code adds min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nTherefore, in the if block, we also need to ensure that the delta doesn't exceed the r_j. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that a_v must be between l_v and r_v. \n\nSo, when we add the delta (low[j] - sum[j]), the total contribution to v is sum[j] + delta = low[j], which is within the l_j and r_j. \n\nBut what if low[j] exceeds r_j? \n\nThe problem states that the input ensures that it's possible to achieve the constraints. \n\nSo we can assume that l_j <= r_j, and that there exists a way to choose the operations such that all a_v are within their ranges. \n\nTherefore, in the if block, the delta is (low[j] - sum[j]), and this is added to the parent's sum. \n\nBut the parent's contribution can't exceed r_j. \n\nWait, no. The parent's contribution is the sum from the parent's path. \n\nThe total contribution to v is the parent's contribution plus the delta from this operation. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe parent's contribution is the sum from the parent's path. \n\nThe operation's contribution to v is the delta. \n\nThe total contribution to v is the parent's contribution plus the delta. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe parent's contribution is the sum from the parent's path. \n\nThe operation's contribution to v is the delta. \n\nThe total contribution to v is the parent's contribution plus the delta. \n\nBut the parent's contribution is sum[j], which is the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nWait, I'm getting confused. \n\nPerhaps the sum array represents the required contribution from the parent's path. \n\nSo, for node j:\n\nThe required contribution from the parent's path is sum[j]. \n\nThe total contribution to j is sum[j] plus any contributions from operations ending at j. \n\nThe total must be between l_j and r_j. \n\nWhen we add an operation that contributes delta to j, this delta is added to the parent's path's contribution. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe operation's contribution to j is delta, but the parent's path's contribution is sum[j]. \n\nThe total is sum[j] + delta. \n\nBut the parent's path's contribution is sum[j], which is the amount that must be contributed by the parent's path. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should proceed with the code's structure. \n\nThe code's else clause adds min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nThis suggests that the maximum amount that can be pushed up to the parent is the minimum between the current sum[j] and the high[j]. \n\nBecause the total contribution to j is sum[j] plus any new operations. \n\nWait, perhaps the sum[j] is the amount that can be pushed up to the parent without exceeding the high[j]. \n\nSo, when the current sum[j] is sufficient (>= l_j), then the maximum amount that can be pushed up to the parent is min(sum[j], high[j]). \n\nBecause pushing more would exceed the high[j]. \n\nTherefore, in the else clause, we add min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nThis way, the parent's contribution is increased by this amount, but not exceeding the high[j]. \n\nSo, in the if block, when we have to add an operation, the delta is (low[j] - sum[j]). \n\nThis delta must be added to the parent's sum. \n\nBut also, the total contribution to j is sum[j] + delta = low[j], which is within the l_j and r_j. \n\nTherefore, the code's if block should be:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nBut also, what about the upper limit r_j? \n\nThe problem states that the a_v must be <= r_v. \n\nSo, when we add the delta, the total contribution to j is low[j], which must be <= r_j. \n\nThe problem's input ensures that this is possible. \n\nTherefore, the code's if block is correct. \n\nNow, the code's else clause adds min(sum[j], high[j]) to the parent's sum. \n\nThis ensures that the parent's contribution doesn't exceed the high[j]. \n\nTherefore, the code's missing part is the two lines in the if block. \n\nSo, the code should be filled as:\n\nif (low[j] > sum[j]) {\n    ans += 1;\n    sum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n}\n\nElse, the code proceeds as before. \n\nWait, but what about the case where the parent is the root (node 1), and parent[j] is 1's parent (which is none)? \n\nIn the code's parent array, parent[1] is not set. \n\nBut in the problem's input, the root is 1, so its parent is none. \n\nTherefore, when j=1, parent[j] is not set. \n\nBut in the code's loop, when j=1, the code accesses parent[j], which is parent[1], which is uninitialized. \n\nThis is a bug. \n\nHowever, in the problem's constraints, the root is 1, so when processing node 1, its parent is not present. \n\nTherefore, in the code, perhaps parent[1] is set to 0, or the code should handle it. \n\nBut since the problem's input doesn't provide parent[1], the code may have an error. \n\nHowever, in the problem's description, the root is 1, so the path from root to root is just itself. \n\nTherefore, when processing node 1, the parent is itself? \n\nAlternatively, when j=1, the parent is 1's parent, which is none. \n\nBut in the code's current structure, when j=1, the code will access parent[1], which is not initialized. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nTo fix this, perhaps the parent array should be initialized to 0 for node 1. \n\nBut in the code's current setup, the parent array is initialized as a vector of size n+1, but parent[1] is not set. \n\nSo, in the code's parent initialization, perhaps we should set parent[1] = 0. \n\nBut the problem's input doesn't provide it. \n\nAlternatively, in the code's loop for reading parents, after the loop, set parent[1] = 0. \n\nBut the problem's input doesn't have it. \n\nAlternatively, in the code's loop for j from n down to 1, when j is 1, the parent[j] is not used because the else clause would add to parent[j], but parent[j] is not set. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nHowever, perhaps the code is correct in the sense that when j=1, the parent is not needed because the path from root to root is just itself. \n\nWait, when processing node 1, the else clause would add min(sum[1], high[1]) to parent[1], which is not set. \n\nThis would cause undefined behavior. \n\nTherefore, the code has a bug here. \n\nBut since the problem requires to complete the code, perhaps the parent array is initialized properly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's parent array is 1-based, and parent[1] is not used except when j=1. \n\nBut in the problem's input, the root has no parent, so when j=1, the parent is not needed. \n\nTherefore, in the code's else clause, when j=1, parent[j] is not set, but adding to it would be a problem. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nPerhaps the code should be modified to handle the root case. \n\nBut since the problem requires to fill in the missing code, perhaps the parent array is properly initialized. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's parent array is initialized with parent[1] = 0, and in the code's loop, when j=1, parent[j] is 0, so adding to sum[0] which is out of bounds. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nBut given that the problem requires to complete the code, perhaps the code's parent array is properly handled. \n\nAssuming that the parent array is correctly set, the missing code is the two lines in the if block. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nSo, the code's if block should have those two lines. \n\nTesting this with the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=2, parent[2]=1. \n\nlow[2] =2, sum[2] is 0. \n\nSo, entering the if block:\n\nans becomes 1. \n\nsum[parent[2]] (sum[1]) += 2. \n\nThen, processing node 1:\n\nsum[1] is 2. \n\nlow[1] is 1, which is less than 2. \n\nSo, enter else clause. \n\nsum[parent[1]] (parent[1] is 1's parent, which is not set. \n\nAssuming parent[1] is 0, then sum[0] is accessed, which is out of bounds. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nBut perhaps the root's parent is itself, so parent[1] =1. \n\nThen, when processing node 1, parent[j] is 1. \n\nSo, sum[1] += min(2, high[1]). \n\nSuppose high[1] is >=2, then sum[1] becomes 2 + 2 =4. \n\nBut the a1 in the sample is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the algorithm is not correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, the sum array is the amount that must be pushed up to the parent. \n\nWhen processing node 1, the else clause adds min(sum[1], high[1]) to the parent's sum. \n\nBut the parent of node 1 is none, so this addition is not needed. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the code should have a condition to skip processing the root's parent. \n\nBut since the code is given as is, perhaps the problem's test cases don't have this issue. \n\nAlternatively, the root's parent is itself, so when j=1, parent[j] is 1. \n\nThen, the else clause adds min(sum[1], high[1]) to sum[1]. \n\nSo, sum[1] += min(2, high[1]). \n\nIf high[1] is >=2, then sum[1] becomes 2 +2 =4. \n\nBut the sample's a1 is 1. \n\nThis suggests that the algorithm is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the algorithm. \n\nAlternatively, the sum array represents the required contribution from the parent's path. \n\nWhen processing node 1 (the root), the parent is none, so there is no contribution from the parent's path. \n\nTherefore, the sum[1] is the required contribution from the root's path (which is itself). \n\nWait, perhaps the sum array is initialized to 0 for all nodes. \n\nWhen processing node 1, the sum[1] is the required contribution from its parent (which doesn't exist), so it's 0. \n\nBut in the first sample, after processing node 2, sum[1] is 2. \n\nThen, when processing node 1:\n\nsum[1] is 2. \n\nlow[1] is 1, which is less than 2. \n\nSo, enter else clause. \n\nsum[parent[1]] (parent[1] is 1's parent, which is none. \n\nAssuming parent[1] is 0, then sum[0] is accessed, which is out of bounds. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nTherefore, the code has a bug in the parent array for node 1. \n\nBut since the problem requires to complete the code, perhaps the parent array is initialized properly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should process nodes from n down to 2, and then handle node 1 separately. \n\nBut given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the missing code is the two lines in the if block. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nans += 1;\n\nsum[parent[j]] += (low[j] - sum[j]);\n\nSo, the code's if block should have those two lines. \n\nThus, the answer is to fill in those two lines."
