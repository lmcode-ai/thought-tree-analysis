So for example, if a substring has 3 distinct characters, then each character can appear up to 3 times. So the maximum possible length of a substring where this holds is when all characters are as frequent as possible. But perhaps this can be leveraged. Wait, since the maximum allowed frequency is d, which is the number of distinct characters, which can be up to 10, then the maximum possible length of a diverse substring is 10 * 10 = 100? Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the substring has d distinct characters. The maximum possible length would be d * d, since each character can appear up to d times. So for d=10, that's 100. So any substring longer than 100 characters can't be diverse, because if it has 10 distinct characters, then each can appear up to 10 times, so total length is 100. So any substring longer than 100 can't be diverse. Wait, that's a key insight! Ah! Because the maximum possible d is 10 (since there are 10 digits), so for a substring longer than 10*10=100 characters, the number of distinct characters can't exceed 10, so the maximum allowed frequency for any character is 10. But if the substring has length more than 100, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one character must appear more than 10 times. Because 10 characters each appearing 10 times gives 100. So any substring longer than 100 characters cannot be diverse.",

So instead of considering all possible substrings, which is O(n^2), we can limit our consideration to substrings of length up to 100. Because any longer substring is automatically not diverse. Therefore, the total number of substrings we need to check is O(n * 100) = 1e7 (since n is up to 1e5), which is manageable. So the plan is: for each starting index i, we check all substrings starting at i with length up to 100. For each such substring (from i to j where j-i+1 <=100), we check if it is diverse. If yes, we count it. This reduces the problem to O(n * 100) operations, which is acceptable. Now, how to implement this efficiently?",

So in the code, the TODO section must include initializing these variables, and tracking them. Wait, the code currently has:\n\nfor(ll i=0;i<n;i++)\n\n{\n\n    int k = INT_MIN;\n\n    map<int,int>mp;\n\n    for(ll j=i;j<min(n,i+100);j++)\n\n    {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n} So the variables d and max_count need to be declared inside the i loop, perhaps. So here's the plan for the code: Inside the outer loop (for each i):\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nmap<int, int> mp; // to track counts of each digit in current substring. int d = 0; // number of distinct digits. int max_count = 0; Then, for each j from i to min(n, i+100):\n\nchar current_char = h[j]; // but need to convert to integer. Wait, the key in the map is the digit's value (0-9). So:\n\nint c = h[j] - '0'; // convert to integer. Then:\n\nint prev_count = mp[c];\n\nmp[c]++;\n\nif (prev_count == 0) {\n\n    d +=1;\n\n}\n\n// update max_count:\n\nif (mp[c] > max_count) {\n\n    max_count = mp[c];\n\n}\n\n// check condition:\n\nif (max_count <= d) {\n\n    // this substring is valid, so add 1 to the total.\n\n    total +=1;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the total is stored in 'c' (the outer variable). So in the code, the variable 'c' is the total count. So inside the inner loop, when the condition is met, we do c +=1. So putting this all together, the code inside the inner loop would be:\n\nInside the inner loop (for j):\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0'; // convert to integer 0-9.\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) {\n\n    max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\n} if (max_count <= d) {\n\n    ::c +=1; // but wait, the outer c is in the same scope. Wait, the outer c is declared as ll c=0; in the while loop (per test case). So inside the loops, we can just do c +=1.\n\n} Wait, but in the code's current structure, the variables d and max_count are declared inside the i loop. So the code would look like:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    ... read n and h.\n\n    ll c=0;\n\n    for (i from 0 to n-1):\n\n        map<int, int> mp;\n\n        int d =0, max_count=0;\n\n        for (j from i to ...):\n\n            int c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\n            int prev = mp[c_digit];\n\n            mp[c_digit]++;\n\n            if (prev ==0) d++;\n\n            if (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\n            if (max_count <= d) {\n\n                c +=1;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout << c << endl; Yes, that should work.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count all the diverse substrings of a given digit string. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe definition of a diverse string is that each character's occurrence count doesn't exceed the number of distinct characters in it. For example, \"1010\" has two distinct characters (0 and 1), each appearing twice, so it's diverse. But \"6668\" has two distinct, but 6 appears three times, so it's not.\n\nThe task is to count all substrings of the input string that meet this condition. Since substrings are all possible contiguous sequences, the total is n(n+1)/2, but we need to find how many of those are diverse.\n\nHmm, the brute-force approach would be to check every possible substring, but that's O(n^2) for each test case, which with n up to 1e5 would be way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the constraints say that the sum of n over all test cases is up to 1e5. So even O(n^2) would be 1e10 operations, which is way too big. So we need an O(n) or O(n^2) but with a very small constant? Wait, maybe there's a way to find this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the condition again. For a substring to be diverse, for every character in it, its count must be \u2264 the number of distinct characters in the substring. Let's denote the number of distinct characters as d. Then each character's count must be \u2264 d.\n\nHmm, so for a substring to be diverse, the maximum frequency of any character in it must be \u2264 d, where d is the number of distinct characters in that substring.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum frequency of any character in the substring must be \u2264 the number of distinct characters in the substring.\n\nSo for a substring, let d be the number of distinct digits. Then, the maximum count of any digit in the substring must be \u2264 d.\n\nSo how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each position, we can track the current counts and find the maximum possible substring starting at that position which satisfies the condition. But even that might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as for each position i, we can find the maximum j such that the substring from i to j is diverse. Then, the number of valid substrings starting at i would be (j - i + 1). But how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a sliding window approach. Let me think: the window must satisfy that for all characters in the window, their counts are \u2264 the number of distinct characters in the window. Let's see.\n\nWait, the number of distinct characters in the window is d. So the maximum count of any character in the window must be \u2264 d. Since d is the number of distinct characters, which is at least 1, but the maximum count can be up to d.\n\nHmm, but how to manage this in a sliding window?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position, we can track the counts of the characters in the current window and check the condition. But even that might be O(n^2) in the worst case.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum possible d (number of distinct characters) in a substring is 10, since there are only digits 0-9. So the maximum possible d is 10. Therefore, for any substring, the maximum frequency of any character can't exceed 10. Wait, no. Wait, if the substring has d distinct characters, then the maximum frequency allowed is d. So for example, if a substring has 3 distinct characters, then each character can appear up to 3 times. So the maximum possible length of a substring where this holds is when all characters are as frequent as possible. But perhaps this can be leveraged.\n\nWait, since the maximum allowed frequency is d, which is the number of distinct characters, which can be up to 10, then the maximum possible length of a diverse substring is 10 * 10 = 100? Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the substring has d distinct characters. The maximum possible length would be d * d, since each character can appear up to d times. So for d=10, that's 100. So any substring longer than 100 characters can't be diverse, because if it has 10 distinct characters, then each can appear up to 10 times, so total length is 100. So any substring longer than 100 can't be diverse. Wait, that's a key insight!\n\nAh! Because the maximum possible d is 10 (since there are 10 digits), so for a substring longer than 10*10=100 characters, the number of distinct characters can't exceed 10, so the maximum allowed frequency for any character is 10. But if the substring has length more than 100, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one character must appear more than 10 times. Because 10 characters each appearing 10 times gives 100. So any substring longer than 100 characters cannot be diverse. Therefore, all diverse substrings have length at most 100. \n\nThat's a crucial point! So instead of considering all possible substrings, which is O(n^2), we can limit our consideration to substrings of length up to 100. Because any longer substring is automatically not diverse. \n\nTherefore, the total number of substrings we need to check is O(n * 100) = 1e7 (since n is up to 1e5), which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is: for each starting index i, we check all substrings starting at i with length up to 100. For each such substring (from i to j where j-i+1 <=100), we check if it is diverse. If yes, we count it. \n\nThis reduces the problem to O(n * 100) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThe code provided in the problem has a loop for i from 0 to n-1, and then a loop for j from i to min(n, i+100). So the inner loop runs up to 100 steps. The TODO is inside this loop.\n\nThe idea is, for each i, we can track the counts of each digit in the current substring (from i to j). For each j, we can update the counts and check the condition.\n\nWait, but for each i, we can start with an empty map, and as we increment j from i to i+100, we can track the counts. Then, for each j, after adding h[j], we can check if the substring from i to j is diverse.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nInitialize a map (or array, since digits are 0-9) to track the counts of each digit in the current substring (starting at i and ending at j). Also track the number of distinct digits (d) and the maximum count (max_count). \n\nFor each i:\n\n- Initialize the counts array to 0, d = 0, max_count = 0.\n\n- Then, for j from i to min(n-1, i+100):\n\n   - current_char = h[j]\n\n   - increment counts[current_char] by 1.\n\n   - if counts[current_char] was 0 before, then d increases by 1.\n\n   - update max_count to be the maximum between max_count and counts[current_char]\n\n   - Now, check if max_count <= d. If yes, then this substring (i to j) is diverse, so add 1 to the total count.\n\n   - else, break the loop, since further extensions (j increasing) will only make the substring longer, but since the current substring already violates the condition, any longer substring starting at i will also violate it. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. Because when you add more characters, the number of distinct could increase, which might allow higher counts. Hmm, but in this case, since we are only considering up to 100 characters, perhaps once the condition is violated, we can stop checking further for this i?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose at some j, the substring i..j is not diverse. Then, any longer substring (i..j+1, etc.) will have a larger or equal max_count and possibly the same or higher d. So if the current substring is not diverse, then adding more characters can't make it diverse again. Because:\n\nSuppose the current substring has max_count > d. Adding another character could either:\n\n- increase the max_count (if the new character is the same as the one with max_count, then max_count increases by 1, but d remains same. So new max_count would be (old_max +1) > (d). So still not okay.\n\n- or, the new character is a new distinct, so d increases by 1. Then, the new max_count could be either the previous max_count (if the new character's count is 1) or the new character's count (if it's 1). So the new max_count would be max(old_max, 1). The new d is d+1. So the condition is whether max(old_max, 1) <= d+1. \n\nHmm, maybe in some cases, adding a new distinct could fix the condition. For example, suppose current substring has d=2, max_count=3. Then, adding a new distinct (d becomes 3), so the max_count (3) must be <=3, which is okay. So in that case, the longer substring would be okay.\n\nSo in that case, even if the current substring (i..j) is not diverse, the next one (i..j+1) could be. So we can't break early.\n\nHmm, so that complicates things. So the approach of breaking when the condition is violated is not correct. So we have to check all substrings up to 100 characters, even if some in between are invalid.\n\nTherefore, for each i, we have to process all j from i to i+100 (or end of string), and for each j, check whether the substring i..j is diverse. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize for each i:\n\n- counts array (size 10, since digits 0-9)\n\n- d = 0 (number of distinct digits in current substring)\n\n- max_count = 0\n\nThen, for each j from i to min(i+100, n-1):\n\n   char c = h[j]\n\n   prev_count = counts[c]\n\n   counts[c] +=1\n\n   if prev_count ==0: d +=1\n\n   if counts[c] > max_count: max_count = counts[c]\n\n   now check if max_count <= d:\n\n      if yes, then add 1 to the total.\n\n   else:\n\n      do nothing (this substring is not counted)\n\nProceed until j reaches the end of the allowed range (i+100 or n-1)\n\nSo this way, for each i, we process up to 100 steps, and for each step, we do O(1) operations (since counts are for digits 0-9, so checking max is O(1) if we track it as we go).\n\nThis should be manageable.\n\nNow, looking at the code provided:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor(ll i=0;i<n;i++)\n\n{\n\n    int k = INT_MIN;\n\n    map<int,int>mp;\n\n    for(ll j=i;j<min(n,i+100);j++)\n\n    {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the code uses a map<int, int> mp. But since the characters are digits 0-9, a better approach is to use an array of size 10. Also, the variable k is set to INT_MIN, but not used. Probably that's a placeholder.\n\nSo the missing code inside the inner loop should be:\n\nFor each j, process the current character, track counts, d, max_count, and check the condition.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nWe can have an array count[10], initialized to 0 for each i. Also, variables d and max_count.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the inner loop is inside the outer loop, so for each i, we can reset the count array, d, and max_count.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nInside the outer loop (for each i):\n\nInitialize count array (maybe as an array of 10 integers, initialized to 0 each time). Also, d=0, max_count=0.\n\nThen, for each j from i to min(n, i+100):\n\nWait, the code's inner loop is written as:\n\nfor(ll j=i; j < min(n, i+100); j++ )\n\nWait, but min(n, i+100) could be beyond the string's length. So perhaps better to use min(n, i+100) but since j is up to n-1, perhaps better to write min(i+100, n-1). But in code, the loop is written as j < min(n, i+100). Since the string is of length n, indices go from 0 to n-1. So the upper limit for j is min(i+100, n-1). So the loop should be up to j < i+100+1? Hmm, perhaps the code's current loop is okay, but let me see.\n\nWait, the code's inner loop is written as:\n\nfor(ll j=i; j < min(n, i+100); j++ )\n\nSo the maximum j is min(n, i+100) -1. Because j starts at i and increments until it's less than that value. So for example, if i+100 is less than n, then j goes up to i+99. So the substring length is 100 (from i to i+99). Wait, but the maximum allowed length is 100, so that's okay. Because 100 characters is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, the maximum allowed length is 100, so the substring from i to j can be up to 100 characters (j = i+99). So the loop is correct.\n\nSo, inside the inner loop, for each j:\n\ncurrent character is h[j].\n\nWe need to track counts, d, max_count.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInside the outer loop (for each i):\n\nInitialize count array (maybe as an array of 10 integers, initialized to 0 each time). Also, d=0, max_count=0.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, they have a map<int, int> mp. So perhaps using a map is okay, but since the keys are 0-9, it's better to use an array. But since the code uses a map, maybe we can proceed with that.\n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the inner loop is inside the outer loop, so for each i, the map is reinitialized. So for each i, we can do:\n\nmap<int, int> mp; // this is cleared each time.\n\nint d = 0;\n\nint max_count = 0;\n\nThen, for each j from i to ...:\n\nchar c = h[j] - '0'; // since h is a string of digits.\n\nWait, h[j] is a char like '0', so converting to integer: c = h[j] - '0'.\n\nThen, the current count for c is mp[c].\n\nSo:\n\nint prev_count = mp[c];\n\nmp[c]++;\n\nif (prev_count == 0) d++;\n\n// now, check if the new count is larger than previous max_count.\n\nif (mp[c] > max_count) {\n\n    max_count = mp[c];\n\n}\n\n// Now check if max_count <= d.\n\nif (max_count <= d) {\n\n    c++; // since the total is stored in variable c (the outer variable). Wait, the outer variable is named c, which is a problem.\n\nWait, in the code given, the outer loop has a variable 'c' initialized to 0. So in the code:\n\nll c=0; // this is the total count.\n\nInside the loops, when we find a valid substring, we need to increment c.\n\nBut in the code's current setup, the inner loop has variables like 'k' (which is unused) and the map.\n\nSo, the code's variables:\n\nThe outer loop has 'c' as the total count.\n\nInside the inner loops, for each j, after processing, if the substring is valid, we add 1 to 'c'.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nInside the inner loop (for j):\n\n...\n\nif (max_count <= d) {\n\n    c +=1;\n\n}\n\nSo putting this all together.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the variables d and max_count are not declared. So in the code, the TODO section must include initializing these variables, and tracking them.\n\nWait, the code currently has:\n\nfor(ll i=0;i<n;i++)\n\n{\n\n    int k = INT_MIN;\n\n    map<int,int>mp;\n\n    for(ll j=i;j<min(n,i+100);j++)\n\n    {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the variables d and max_count need to be declared inside the i loop, perhaps.\n\nSo here's the plan for the code:\n\nInside the outer loop (for each i):\n\nInitialize variables:\n\nmap<int, int> mp; // to track counts of each digit in current substring.\n\nint d = 0; // number of distinct digits.\n\nint max_count = 0;\n\nThen, for each j from i to min(n, i+100):\n\nchar current_char = h[j]; // but need to convert to integer.\n\nWait, the key in the map is the digit's value (0-9). So:\n\nint c = h[j] - '0'; // convert to integer.\n\nThen:\n\nint prev_count = mp[c];\n\nmp[c]++;\n\nif (prev_count == 0) {\n\n    d +=1;\n\n}\n\n// update max_count:\n\nif (mp[c] > max_count) {\n\n    max_count = mp[c];\n\n}\n\n// check condition:\n\nif (max_count <= d) {\n\n    // this substring is valid, so add 1 to the total.\n\n    total +=1;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the total is stored in 'c' (the outer variable). So in the code, the variable 'c' is the total count. So inside the inner loop, when the condition is met, we do c +=1.\n\nSo putting this all together, the code inside the inner loop would be:\n\nInside the inner loop (for j):\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0'; // convert to integer 0-9.\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) {\n\n    max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\n}\n\nif (max_count <= d) {\n\n    ::c +=1; // but wait, the outer c is in the same scope. Wait, the outer c is declared as ll c=0; in the while loop (per test case). So inside the loops, we can just do c +=1.\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the variables d and max_count are declared inside the i loop. So the code would look like:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    ... read n and h.\n\n    ll c=0;\n\n    for (i from 0 to n-1):\n\n        map<int, int> mp;\n\n        int d =0, max_count=0;\n\n        for (j from i to ...):\n\n            int c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\n            int prev = mp[c_digit];\n\n            mp[c_digit]++;\n\n            if (prev ==0) d++;\n\n            if (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\n            if (max_count <= d) {\n\n                c +=1;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    cout << c << endl;\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the inner loop is inside the i loop, so the variables d and max_count are properly scoped.\n\nSo the missing code inside the inner loop (the TODO section) should be:\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\nif (max_count <= d) c++;\n\nWait, but the code's outer 'c' is the total count. So in the code, the variable 'c' is declared as ll c=0; in the test case loop. So inside the inner loop, when the condition is met, we can do c +=1.\n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the variables d and max_count are declared inside the i loop. So the code would be:\n\nInside the outer loop (for each i):\n\nmap<int, int> mp;\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nfor (j from i to ...):\n\n    // process as above.\n\nSo the code inside the inner loop (the TODO part) would be:\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) {\n\n    max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\n}\n\nif (max_count <= d) {\n\n    c += 1;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the variables d and max_count are in the outer loop (i's loop), so they are accessible in the inner loop.\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nSo putting all together, the missing code is:\n\nInside the inner loop (the TODO section):\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\nif (max_count <= d) c++;\n\nWait, but in the code's current variables, the 'd' and 'max_count' are declared in the i loop. So yes, this should work.\n\nWait, but in the code provided, the variables d and max_count are not declared. So in the code, after the map is declared, we need to add:\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nSo in the code's current structure, the code inside the outer loop (for each i) is:\n\nmap<int, int> mp;\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nThen, the inner loop's code is as above.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the TODO section is the code inside the inner loop, which is the code I wrote above.\n\nWait, but the code provided's outer loop (for i) has:\n\nint k = INT_MIN; // which is unused. Probably a leftover from previous code. So we can remove that line, but since the problem says to output only the missing code, perhaps we can ignore that and just fill in the inner loop's code.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly.\"\n\nSo the code that needs to be filled in is the inner loop's body. The existing code has the loops, but the inner loop's body is empty (the TODO comment). So the code to be filled is the code inside the inner loop's braces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the code I wrote above, which is:\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\nif (max_count <= d) c++;\n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the variables d and max_count are declared in the outer loop (i's loop). So the code must have those variables declared before the inner loop.\n\nWait, the code as given in the problem's code has:\n\nfor(ll i=0;i<n;i++)\n\n{\n\n    int k = INT_MIN;\n\n    map<int,int>mp;\n\n    for(ll j=i;j<min(n,i+100);j++)\n\n    {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the variables d and max_count are not declared. So the code must first declare them. So the code inside the i loop (before the inner loop) must have:\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nSo the code for the outer loop (for each i) would be:\n\nfor(ll i=0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    map<int, int> mp;\n\n    int d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\n    for (ll j = i; j < min(n, i+100); j++) {\n\n        // the code here\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nTherefore, the missing code includes both the declaration of d and max_count, and the inner loop's code.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output only the missing code. The existing code has the loops, but the inner loop's body is empty. So the code to be filled in is the code inside the inner loop's braces, plus the declarations of d and max_count before the inner loop.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Complete the code in cpp to solve this programming problem: ... Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly.\"\n\nThe existing code has the loops, but the inner loop's body is empty. So the missing code includes the declarations of d and max_count before the inner loop, and the code inside the inner loop.\n\nTherefore, the code to be filled in is:\n\nInside the outer loop (for each i):\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nThen, inside the inner loop (for j):\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\nif (max_count <= d) c++;\n\nWait, but the code's existing variables: the 'c' is declared in the test case loop, so it's accessible here.\n\nTherefore, the code to be filled in is:\n\nFirst, before the inner loop (inside the i loop):\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nThen, inside the inner loop's body:\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\nif (max_count <= d) c++;\n\nSo the code to be filled in is the code above.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. The existing code has the loops, but the inner loop's body is empty. So the code to be filled in is the code inside the inner loop's braces, plus the declarations of d and max_count before the inner loop.\n\nWait, the code as given in the problem's code has:\n\nfor(ll i=0;i<n;i++)\n\n{\n\n    int k = INT_MIN;\n\n    map<int,int>mp;\n\n    for(ll j=i;j<min(n,i+100);j++)\n\n    {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the code inside the outer loop (for i) has the 'k' variable which is unused. So the correct code would replace that with the declarations of d and max_count.\n\nTherefore, the code to be filled in is:\n\nInside the outer loop (for each i):\n\nReplace the line 'int k = INT_MIN;' with:\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nThen, inside the inner loop's body, the code I wrote above.\n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. Since the existing code has the loops, but the inner loop's body is empty, the missing code is the code inside the inner loop's braces, plus the declarations of d and max_count before the inner loop.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output only the missing code. So the code that needs to be filled in is the code inside the inner loop's braces, and the declarations of d and max_count before the inner loop.\n\nTherefore, the code to be filled in is:\n\nBefore the inner loop (inside the i loop):\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nInside the inner loop's body:\n\nint c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\nint prev = mp[c_digit];\n\nmp[c_digit]++;\n\nif (prev == 0) d++;\n\nif (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\nif (max_count <= d) c++;\n\nSo the code to be filled in is:\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nfor(ll j=i;j<min(n,i+100);j++)\n\n{\n\n    int c_digit = h[j] - '0';\n\n    int prev = mp[c_digit];\n\n    mp[c_digit]++;\n\n    if (prev == 0) d++;\n\n    if (mp[c_digit] > max_count) max_count = mp[c_digit];\n\n    if (max_count <= d) c++;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the existing code already has the for loop. So the code to be filled in is the code inside the inner loop's braces, plus the declarations of d and max_count before the inner loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nint d = 0, max_count = 0;\n\nfor ( ... ) {\n\n    // code here\n\n}\n\nWait, but the existing code already has the for loop.
