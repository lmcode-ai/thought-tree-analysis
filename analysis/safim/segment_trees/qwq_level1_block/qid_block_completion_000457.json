By blocking roads that lead to longer paths. So the idea is to block all roads that are not on some shortest path. Then, Keshi can't take any longer paths, so the maximum path length is the shortest path length. Thus, the minimal d is the shortest path length. Ah! That makes sense. Because if you can block all roads not on the shortest path, then Keshi has no choice but to take the shortest path. Each move takes a day, so the total days needed would be exactly the length of the shortest path. The number of days required to block the other roads can be done in parallel with the moves. For example, on days when you block roads, you can do that while moving on other days. But how does that work?",

So if there's a cycle, then Keshi could loop forever, but AmShZ can block the edges leading to the cycle. Ah! So the key is that AmShZ can block edges to eliminate any cycles or longer paths, so that the only path left is the shortest path. Thus, the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. But how does that work in terms of days? Suppose the shortest path is L. To block all edges not on this path, you need to spend B days (B is the number of edges not on the path). Then, you spend L days moving. So total days is B + L. But that's more than L. So this can't be. Hmm, perhaps the problem allows AmShZ to block edges on the same days as moving.",

But the code is correct in terms of the algorithm. The missing part is the relaxation step inside the loop. The current code has a comment where the edge processing should be done. The standard Dijkstra's relaxation step is:\n\nfor each neighbor of x: if d[neighbor] > d[x] + weight:\n        update d[neighbor] and push to queue. In this case, since all edges have weight 1, the code should be:\n\nfor (each edge i from x to ver[i]) if d[ver[i]] > d[x] + 1:\n        d[ver[i]] = d[x] + 1\n        push to queue. Wait, the edges in the adjacency list for x are stored as ver[i], so each edge from x to ver[i]. So the code should process each edge as follows:\n\nfor (each edge i in head[x] ... ) int y = ver[i]; if (d[y] > d[x] + 1) {\n        d[y] = d[x] + 1;\n        q.push( make_pair(d[y], y) );\n    }\n\nSo the missing code is the relaxation step for each edge. Looking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor(ll i=head[x];i;i=nxt[i]){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n} So the missing part is the code inside this loop to process each edge. Thus, the correct code would be:\n\nfor (ll i = head[x] ; i; i = nxt[i]) {\n    ll y = ver[i];\n    if (d[y] > d[x] + 1) {\n        d[y] = d[x] + 1;\n        q.push( make_pair(d[y], y) );\n    }\n}\n\nSo the missing code is the above. Therefore, the answer is to fill in the Dijkstra's relaxation step for each edge.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can ensure they meet after at most d days. The key here is understanding the strategy that AmShZ can use each day to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. The goal is to minimize the maximum possible days required to guarantee that Keshi reaches city n.\n\nHmm, the problem requires that no matter what choices Keshi makes when moving (since he randomly chooses among reachable cities), the strategy must ensure that after d days, they are guaranteed to have met. So we need to find the minimal d where such a strategy exists.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The problem seems similar to a shortest path problem but with some twists. Since AmShZ can choose to block roads strategically, perhaps the minimal d is related to the longest path in some way, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nWait, the problem mentions that each day, AmShZ can choose between two options: block a road or tell Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he picks a reachable city uniformly at random. But since we need to guarantee that they meet regardless of Keshi's choices, the strategy must account for the worst-case scenario. So, the path must be such that even if Keshi takes the worst possible path (i.e., the one that takes the longest time), the days are still within d.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled as a game where each day, AmShZ can either block a road (thereby removing it from the graph) or force Keshi to move. The movement must be such that Keshi moves to a reachable city, but since we need to guarantee arrival, we have to consider the path that takes the longest possible steps.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model this as a BFS where each state is the current city and the set of blocked roads. But that's probably too big for the constraints given (n up to 2e5). So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the problem requires the minimal d such that there exists a strategy that ensures Keshi reaches n in at most d days. Let me think of the problem in terms of the maximum number of steps required in the worst case.\n\nAnother thought: since AmShZ can choose which roads to block, perhaps the optimal strategy is to block all roads that are not on some shortest path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into finding the minimal number of steps required in the best possible path, considering that each move can be forced, but with the option to block roads to eliminate longer paths.\n\nWait, the problem allows AmShZ to block roads. So perhaps the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n, but that might not be right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem requires that after d days, Keshi must have arrived at n. The days can be used to either block roads or move. Each day, AmShZ can choose between blocking a road (so Keshi stays) or moving (so Keshi moves to a next city, but he can choose any outgoing edge that's not blocked). Since we need to guarantee arrival, the strategy must ensure that no matter which path Keshi takes (when moving), he can't take a path longer than d days.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal number of steps required in the best possible path, but considering that each step can be forced with some blocking. Alternatively, maybe the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of steps in the shortest path from 1 to n, but with some constraints.\n\nWait, let me think of the sample input. The first sample's note says that it's enough to send the second type message (i.e., move). So in that case, the path must be of length 1. So the minimal d is 1. So perhaps the answer is the length of the shortest path from 1 to n. But the second sample's note says that blocking a road first, then moving, gives a two-day solution. Wait, the second sample's note says that the first day blocks a road, so Keshi can only go to city 4, then on the second day, he moves to n. So that's two days. But if the shortest path was length 2, then the answer would be 2. So maybe the answer is the length of the shortest path.\n\nWait, but why would the first sample's answer be 1? Because the shortest path is 1 step. So perhaps the answer is indeed the shortest path length. But why would blocking roads be necessary?\n\nWait, maybe the problem requires that the path must be forced such that Keshi cannot take a longer path. For example, if there are multiple paths, some longer than others, then AmShZ can block the longer paths so that Keshi is forced to take the shortest path. So the minimal d is the length of the shortest path from 1 to n. Because each day, when you tell Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge, but if you block all edges except those on the shortest path, then he can only take the shortest path. So the number of days would be the number of steps in the shortest path. Because each move takes a day, and blocking roads can be done on other days. Wait, but each day you can choose to either block a road or move. So the days required would be the number of steps (since each move takes a day) plus the number of blocked roads needed to block the other paths. But that complicates things.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to model this as a game where each move can be forced, but blocking roads can be done in parallel. Let me think differently.\n\nThe key is that each day, AmShZ can choose between two actions:\n\n1. Block a road. This takes a day, but doesn't move Keshi. So the next day can be used to move again.\n\n2. Tell Keshi to move. This takes a day, and Keshi moves to a next city (or stays if no options). \n\nThe goal is to reach n in as few days as possible, regardless of Keshi's choices when moving. So the strategy must ensure that no matter which path Keshi takes (when moving), he can't take a path that requires more than d days.\n\nWait, but how do the blocked roads affect this? The idea is that by blocking certain roads, AmShZ can eliminate longer paths, forcing Keshi to take a shorter path. So the minimal d is the minimal number of steps in the shortest path from 1 to n. Because, in the best case, AmShZ can block all roads not on the shortest path, so that Keshi is forced to take the shortest path. Each step in the path requires a \"move\" day, so the total days would be equal to the path length. But how does blocking the roads take days?\n\nWait, each blocked road takes a day. So if the shortest path has length k, then the number of days needed would be k (for the moves) plus the number of roads not on the shortest path that need to be blocked. But that might not be the case. Because blocking can be done on days when you choose to block instead of moving. So perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path, because you can block all other roads in parallel while moving.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because each move takes a day, and you can block roads on other days. For example, if the shortest path is length 3, then you can do three move days, and block any other roads on the other days. But the problem requires that the total days must be at most d, and you have to choose the minimal d such that regardless of Keshi's choices, you can reach n in d days.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because, in the best case, you can choose to move each day, and Keshi takes the shortest path. But since Keshi can choose any outgoing edge, you have to block all other edges to prevent him from taking a longer path. The number of days needed would be the path length plus the number of edges you have to block. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of days such that there exists a path from 1 to n where each edge on the path is not blocked, and the number of edges in the path plus the number of blocked edges not on the path is <=d. But I'm not sure.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a path from 1 to n with length L, and the number of edges not on this path is B. Then, the total days needed would be L (for the moves) plus B (for blocking those edges). But since each day you can choose to block or move, you can interleave the blocking and moving steps. For example, you can block edges on some days and move on others. The total days would be L + B, but perhaps you can do better by blocking multiple edges in parallel. Wait, no, because each block takes a day. So the total days needed would be L + B. But to minimize d, we need to choose a path where L + B is minimized. Since B is the number of edges not on the path, the total is (total edges) - (edges on path) + L. Wait, no, B is the number of edges not on the path. So L + (m - L) = m, which is not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of the problem in terms of the maximum number of days required in the worst case. The strategy must ensure that regardless of Keshi's choices when moving, he can't take a path longer than d days. So the minimal d is the minimal maximum over all possible paths of (number of steps in the path) plus the number of blocked edges along that path. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal d such that there exists a set of edges S (the ones not blocked) forming a path from 1 to n with length L, and the number of edges not in S (the ones blocked) is B. Then the total days needed would be L (for moving) plus B (for blocking those edges). But since each day you can choose to block or move, you can do the blocking and moving in any order. So the total days needed would be L + B. To minimize this, we need to choose a path S such that (number of edges not in S) + (length of S) is minimized. The minimal value of (m - |S|) + |S| = m, which is not helpful. Hmm, that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because, if you can block all other edges not on the shortest path, then Keshi has to take that path. The number of days needed would be the length of the path (since each move takes a day), plus the number of edges blocked (each taking a day). But the problem requires that the total days must be at most d, so the minimal d would be the path length plus the number of edges not on the path. But that would be worse than the path length. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think of it differently. Let me think of the problem as a two-player game where AmShZ wants to minimize the days, and Keshi (in the worst case) chooses paths to maximize the days. The key is that AmShZ can choose to block roads to restrict Keshi's options. The minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a strategy where, regardless of Keshi's choices, the process ends in d days.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a graph where each node is a city, and edges are the roads. The problem requires that AmShZ can choose to block edges, and each move takes Keshi along an edge. The days are counted as each action (block or move) takes a day. The goal is to reach n in minimal days, with the worst-case path.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path from 1 to n. Because, in the best case, AmShZ can block all other edges not on the shortest path, so that Keshi has no choice but to take that path. Each step along the path requires a move day, so the total days would be exactly the path length. Since the problem requires that the strategy must work regardless of Keshi's choices, but if all other edges are blocked, then Keshi has no choice but to take the path. So the minimal d is the shortest path length.\n\nBut then why in the second sample, the answer is 2? Let me see the second sample's note. The second sample's note says that blocking the first road, then moving gives two days. So the path length must be 2. So that aligns with the idea that the answer is the shortest path length.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the shortest path here? The code given in the problem is using Dijkstra's algorithm, but with the edges reversed. Let me look at the code:\n\nIn the code, the edges are added as add(y, x), which is because the input is v_i to u_i, so the road is from v_i to u_i, but in the code, they are adding edges to the adjacency list as y (u_i) pointing to x (v_i). Wait, no, the code's add function is add(y, x), so the adjacency list for each node x would have edges pointing to y. Wait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the shortest path from n to 1, but in reverse?\n\nWait, the code's dijkstra is called with dijkstra(n), and the distance array d is initialized to INF, and d[n] is set to 0. Then, the code is trying to compute the shortest path from n to 1. But why?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is modeled as a reverse graph. Let me think: the problem requires that the minimal d is the shortest path from 1 to n. But in the code, they are doing Dijkstra from n to 1. So maybe the code is trying to compute the shortest path in the reverse graph, which would correspond to the shortest path from 1 to n in the original graph.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the shortest path from 1 to n, but using Dijkstra on the reversed edges. Let me see:\n\nThe code reads each road as v_i to u_i, and adds an edge from y (u_i) to x (v_i). So the adjacency list for each node x contains all the nodes y such that there is an edge from v_i (x) to u_i (y) in the original graph. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nOriginal road is from v_i to u_i. The code adds an edge from y (u_i) to x (v_i). So in the adjacency list for u_i (y), there is an edge pointing to v_i (x). So the adjacency list represents the reverse graph. So the code is building the reverse graph, and then running Dijkstra from n (the destination in the original graph) to 1 (the start). The distance d[1] would then be the shortest path from n to 1 in the reverse graph, which is the same as the shortest path from 1 to n in the original graph. So the code is correct for that part.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample, the first sample's answer is 1, which would be the shortest path length. So the code is correct. But why is the code using Dijkstra? Because the edges might have weights? Wait, the problem doesn't mention any weights. All edges are considered to have a weight of 1, so BFS would suffice. But the code uses Dijkstra's algorithm, which is okay but perhaps overkill.\n\nWait, the problem's code uses Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue, but since all edges have the same weight (1), BFS would be more efficient. However, given the constraints (n up to 2e5), BFS is manageable. But the code is using Dijkstra's, which is also okay.\n\nSo according to this, the code is correct, and the answer is the shortest path length from 1 to n. But why does the second sample's note mention that blocking a road and then moving takes two days? Because the shortest path length is 2. So that aligns with the code's approach.\n\nWait, but the problem's description says that each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or tell Keshi to move. So each action takes a day. The total days needed would be the number of moves plus the number of blocks. But according to the code's approach, the answer is the shortest path length. So how does that fit?\n\nAh! Because the blocks can be done on the same days as moving? Or perhaps the blocks are not counted as days because they can be done in parallel? Wait no, each day you choose one action. So each block takes a day, and each move takes a day. So the total days would be the number of moves plus the number of blocks. But the code's answer is the shortest path length, which suggests that the blocks are not counted. So there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that each day, AmShZ can choose one of two options:\n\n1. Send a message to block a road. Then Keshi stays in his current city for the day.\n\n2. Tell Keshi to move. Then Keshi chooses a reachable city (not blocked) and moves there. If no such cities, he stays.\n\nThe days are counted as each action takes a day. The goal is to find the minimal d such that after at most d days, Keshi is guaranteed to have reached n.\n\nThe key is that the blocks can be done in such a way that the path taken by Keshi is forced to be the shortest path, and the number of days is exactly the length of the path. Because each move takes a day, and the blocks can be done on the same days as moving? No, each day you can choose only one action. So to block a road, you have to spend a day not moving. So the total days would be the path length plus the number of blocked roads. But that would be worse than the path length. So how does the code's approach work?\n\nWait, perhaps the blocks are not required. Because when you tell Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge that hasn't been blocked. To ensure that he takes the shortest path, you don't need to block any edges except those that are not on the shortest path. But the problem requires that the strategy must work regardless of Keshi's choices. So if there are multiple paths, you have to block the edges not on the shortest path so that Keshi cannot choose them. But each block takes a day. So the total days would be the path length (for the moves) plus the number of edges not on the path that need to be blocked. But that would be more than the path length, so the code's approach must be incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says that AmShZ can choose each day to either block a road (so Keshi stays) or tell Keshi to move (so he moves to a reachable city). The goal is to find the minimal d such that after at most d days, Keshi is guaranteed to have reached n, no matter what choices he makes when moving.\n\nThe key is that AmShZ can choose which roads to block, but each block takes a day. So the strategy must involve a sequence of blocks and moves such that after d days, Keshi is in n.\n\nThe minimal d is the minimal number of days required for such a strategy.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because in the worst case, Keshi might take the longest path, and you have to block all other edges to force him to take that path. But that would be the opposite of what I thought before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a DAG where we need to find the minimal number of days such that there exists a path from 1 to n with length L, and the number of edges not on this path is B. Then the total days needed would be L + B. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal number of days such that there exists a path from 1 to n with length L, and the number of edges not on this path is B, and L + B <= d. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of days such that the path from 1 to n can be reached in L moves, and the number of edges not on the path can be blocked in the remaining days. So the total days would be L + B, where B is the number of edges not on the path. But to minimize this, we need to choose a path with minimal (L + (m - L)) = m, which is not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of it as a game where each day you can either block a road or move. The optimal strategy would be to block all roads that are not on some shortest path, so that Keshi is forced to take the shortest path. The number of days needed would be the number of edges in the shortest path (each move takes a day) plus the number of edges not on the path (each block takes a day). But that would be the path length plus (m - path length). But that's m, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks can be done in parallel with the moves. For example, on a day when you choose to block a road, you can do that while not moving, but you can also choose to move on other days. So the total days would be the maximum between the number of moves needed and the number of blocks needed. But that also doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because, you can choose to move each day, and if there are multiple paths, you can block the other paths on the days when you choose to block. But how?\n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose the shortest path is length 2, but there's a longer path of length 3. To ensure that Keshi takes the shortest path, you need to block the edges that lead to the longer path. But each block takes a day. So the total days would be 2 (for the moves) plus the number of edges you need to block. But how many edges need to be blocked?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because, even if there are other paths, you can choose to move each day, and Keshi might take the shortest path. But since the problem requires that it must work regardless of Keshi's choices, you have to account for the worst case. So if there's a longer path, then Keshi could take that path, requiring more days. So the minimal d must be the length of the longest possible path that can't be blocked?\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think of the problem differently. Let me think of the problem as a game where each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or move. The goal is to reach n in as few days as possible, but Keshi's path is chosen adversarially (to maximize the days). So the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a strategy where, no matter how Keshi chooses his path (when moving), the total days will be at most d.\n\nThe key is to find a strategy that, regardless of Keshi's choices, ensures that after d days, he is at n.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the maximum number of days required. The strategy must ensure that even if Keshi takes the longest possible path, the days are still within d.\n\nWait, but how can AmShZ influence that? By blocking roads that lead to longer paths. So the idea is to block all roads that are not on some shortest path. Then, Keshi can't take any longer paths, so the maximum path length is the shortest path length. Thus, the minimal d is the shortest path length.\n\nAh! That makes sense. Because if you can block all roads not on the shortest path, then Keshi has no choice but to take the shortest path. Each move takes a day, so the total days needed would be exactly the length of the shortest path. The number of days required to block the other roads can be done in parallel with the moves. For example, on days when you block roads, you can do that while moving on other days. But how does that work?\n\nWait, each day you can choose to either block or move. So to block a road, you have to spend a day not moving. But if you have to block B roads, then you need B days for blocking plus L days for moving, totaling B + L days. But that would be worse than L. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm, so there must be a different way. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the key is that when you tell Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge that hasn't been blocked. So to force him to take a certain path, you need to block all other edges from his current city. But each block takes a day. So for each step along the path, you can block all other edges from the current city before moving.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because, for each step along the path, you can first block all other edges from the current city (except the one you want him to take), and then move. But blocking those edges would take days. For example, suppose the shortest path is of length L. For each node along the path, you have to block all edges except the next one. The number of edges to block at each step is (number of outgoing edges from current node) minus 1. But this could add up to a lot of days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because AmShZ can choose to move each day, and even if Keshi takes a longer path, AmShZ can block the roads that lead to longer paths as they go. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of days such that the path from 1 to n has length L, and the number of edges not on this path is B. The total days needed would be L (for the moves) plus B (for the blocks). But to minimize this, we need to choose a path with minimal (L + B). Since B = m - L, this would be m, which is not helpful.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Let me look at the code provided again. The code is using Dijkstra's algorithm from n to 1, and the answer is d[1]. So the code is computing the shortest path from n to 1 in the reversed graph, which is the shortest path from 1 to n in the original graph. So the code's author must have thought that the answer is the shortest path length. But why?\n\nThe problem's first sample's note says that the answer is 1, which matches the shortest path length. The second sample's note says that the answer is 2, which also matches the shortest path length. So perhaps the code is correct, and the answer is indeed the shortest path length. But why does the blocking not add to the days?\n\nAh! Maybe the blocks are not required. Because when you tell Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge. But the problem requires that the strategy must work regardless of his choices. So the only way to guarantee that he reaches n in L days is if there exists a path of length L, and all other paths are longer. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that each time you tell Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge, but you can choose to block edges in such a way that after L moves, he must have reached n. For example, if the shortest path is L, then after L moves, he must have reached n, regardless of his choices. But that's only possible if all paths from 1 to n have length exactly L. Which is not the case in general.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is modeled as follows: the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length L, and the number of edges not on this path is B. The total days needed is L (for the moves) plus B (for the blocks). But to minimize this, you choose the path with minimal (L + B). But that would be the path with minimal (L + (m - L)) = m, which is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because each move takes a day, and you can choose to move each day, and if there's a path of length L, then after L days of moving, he must have reached n. But that's only possible if he takes that path. But since he can choose other paths, you need to block the other edges. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows AmShZ to block edges on the same days as moving. For example, on a day when you choose to move, you can also block an edge. But no, the problem states that each day you choose one action: either block or move.\n\nHmm, I'm really confused. Let me think of the problem again. The problem requires that after d days, Keshi is guaranteed to be at n. The strategy must work no matter what choices Keshi makes when moving. So the strategy must ensure that, regardless of the path Keshi takes (when moving), he will reach n within d days.\n\nThe key is that AmShZ can block roads to eliminate paths that would take longer than d days. So the minimal d is the minimal number such that all paths from 1 to n have length at most d, after blocking some roads. The number of days needed is the number of blocks plus the maximum path length after blocking. But the total days must be at most d. So the minimal d is the minimal maximum between the path length and the number of blocks plus path length.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because you can block all other edges not on the shortest path, so that the only path is the shortest path. Then, the number of days needed is the path length (since each move takes a day). The blocks can be done on the days when you choose to block, but you have to do them before the moves. But how?\n\nWait, suppose the shortest path is of length L. To block all other edges, you need to spend B days (B is the number of edges not on the path). Then, you spend L days moving. So total days is B + L. But that's worse than L. So this can't be the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem allows AmShZ to block edges on the same days as moving. But no, each day you choose one action.\n\nWait, maybe the blocks can be done in parallel with the moves. For example, on day 1, you block a road, then on day 2, you move, etc. But the total days would be the maximum between the number of blocks and the number of moves. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because even if there are longer paths, AmShZ can choose to move each day, and Keshi might take the shortest path. But since the problem requires that it must work regardless of Keshi's choices, this approach won't work because Keshi could choose a longer path.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me think of the problem in terms of the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the first sample has a path of length 1. So the answer is 1. That matches the code's approach.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nThe second sample's note says that blocking a road and then moving takes two days. So the path length is 2, which matches the code's approach.\n\nSo perhaps the code is correct, and the answer is indeed the shortest path length. But why does the blocking not add to the days?\n\nAh! Maybe the blocks are not required. Because when you tell Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge. But the problem requires that the strategy must work regardless of his choices. So the only way to guarantee that he reaches n in L days is if every possible path from his current position has length at most L - current days. So the minimal d is the length of the longest possible path from 1 to n. But that would be the longest path, which could be very large.\n\nWait, but the problem says that there is at least one path from 1 to n. So the longest path could be infinite if there are cycles. But the problem states that the input guarantees that there is at least one path, but there could be cycles. However, the problem requires that the strategy must ensure that Keshi reaches n in at most d days. So if there's a cycle, then Keshi could loop forever, but AmShZ can block the edges leading to the cycle.\n\nAh! So the key is that AmShZ can block edges to eliminate any cycles or longer paths, so that the only path left is the shortest path. Thus, the minimal d is the length of the shortest path.\n\nBut how does that work in terms of days?\n\nSuppose the shortest path is L. To block all edges not on this path, you need to spend B days (B is the number of edges not on the path). Then, you spend L days moving. So total days is B + L. But that's more than L. So this can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem allows AmShZ to block edges on the same days as moving. For example, on a day when you choose to move, you can also block an edge. But the problem states that each day you choose one action: either block or move. So you can't do both.\n\nWait, maybe the blocks can be done in such a way that they don't take extra days. For example, when you tell Keshi to move, you can block some edges as part of that action. But according to the problem statement, when you choose to move, you just tell him to move, and he chooses an edge. The blocking is a separate action.\n\nHmm, I'm really stuck. Let me think of the problem again. The code uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from 1 to n, and that's the answer. The samples align with that. So perhaps the problem is indeed asking for the shortest path length, and the blocking is not needed because the problem allows Keshi to choose any path, but the minimal d is the shortest path length because AmShZ can choose to move each day, and if the path is shorter, then it's okay. Wait, but Keshi could choose a longer path.\n\nWait, the problem requires that the strategy must ensure that they meet after at most d days, no matter what Keshi does. So the strategy must work even if Keshi takes the longest possible path. So the minimal d must be the length of the longest possible path that can't be blocked. But that would be the longest path, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows AmShZ to block edges in such a way that the path length is forced to be the shortest path. The number of days needed is the shortest path length because each move takes a day, and the blocks are done in parallel. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the blocks are not needed. Because when you tell Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge. But the problem requires that the strategy must work regardless of his choices. So the only way to guarantee that he reaches n in L days is if every possible path from 1 to n has length at most L. So the minimal L is the length of the shortest path. But that's not possible unless all paths have the same length.\n\nHmm, this is really confusing. Since the code provided uses Dijkstra and the samples match, perhaps the correct answer is indeed the shortest path length. So the code is correct, and the missing part is the Dijkstra's algorithm's edge processing.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nIn the dijkstra function, the code has a loop over the edges from the current node x. The code says:\n\nfor(ll i=head[x];i;i=nxt[i]){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nThe edges are stored in the adjacency list. Since the code is building the reverse graph (edges are added as add(y, x)), the adjacency list for node x contains all the nodes that can reach x in the original graph. Wait, no. Let me think again:\n\nThe original road is from v_i to u_i. The code adds an edge from u_i to v_i (since add(y, x) where y is u_i and x is v_i). So the adjacency list for node x (v_i) contains an edge to u_i. So the adjacency list represents the reverse graph. So when we run Dijkstra from n, we are finding the shortest path from n to 1 in the reverse graph, which corresponds to the shortest path from 1 to n in the original graph.\n\nThe code's Dijkstra is using a priority queue, but since all edges have weight 1, BFS would be more efficient. But the code is correct in terms of the algorithm.\n\nThe missing part is the relaxation step inside the loop. The current code has a comment where the edge processing should be done.\n\nThe standard Dijkstra's relaxation step is:\n\nfor each neighbor of x:\n    if d[neighbor] > d[x] + weight:\n        update d[neighbor] and push to queue.\n\nIn this case, since all edges have weight 1, the code should be:\n\nfor (each edge i from x to ver[i])\n    if d[ver[i]] > d[x] + 1:\n        d[ver[i]] = d[x] + 1\n        push to queue.\n\nWait, the edges in the adjacency list for x are stored as ver[i], so each edge from x to ver[i]. So the code should process each edge as follows:\n\nfor (each edge i in head[x] ... )\n    int y = ver[i];\n    if (d[y] > d[x] + 1) {\n        d[y] = d[x] + 1;\n        q.push( make_pair(d[y], y) );\n    }\n\nSo the missing code is the relaxation step for each edge.\n\nLooking back at the code provided:\n\nThe code has:\n\nfor(ll i=head[x];i;i=nxt[i]){\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\n\nSo the missing part is the code inside this loop to process each edge.\n\nThus, the correct code would be:\n\nfor (ll i = head[x]; i; i = nxt[i]) {\n    ll y = ver[i];\n    if (d[y] > d[x] + 1) {\n        d[y] = d[x] + 1;\n        q.push( make_pair(d[y], y) );\n    }\n}\n\nSo the missing code is the above.\n\nTherefore, the answer is to fill in the Dijkstra's relaxation step for each edge."
