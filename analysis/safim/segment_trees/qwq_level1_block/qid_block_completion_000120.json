But since even with small grids, the number of possible states is too big, perhaps we can think of it as a BFS where the state is the current positions of all robots. But even so, for a 5x5 grid with, say, 5 robots, the state would have 25^5 possibilities, which is way too big. Hmm. Maybe instead of tracking all robots, we can find a condition that must be true for at least one robot to reach (1,1).",

For example, if the robot is at (1, 2), then moving left once will get it there. But only if all robots can move left (i.e., all are in cols >=2). Alternatively, if the robot is at (2,1), then moving up will bring it to (1,1). But only if all robots can move up (i.e., their rows are >=2). Hmm.",

Wait, but how to find that? Alternatively, perhaps for a robot to reach (1,1), the following must be true:\n\n- The robot's initial row must allow it to reach row 1 via up moves, and column 1 via left moves, but ensuring that in the process, during the steps when moving up, all other robots are in rows >=2 (so that moving up is allowed), and during steps moving left, all other robots are in columns >=2 (so that moving left is allowed). Hmm, but it's hard to see how to model this. Another Idea: For the robot to reach (1,1), all other robots must not be in positions that would block certain moves. For instance, if there's another robot in row 1 (other than the first column), then moving up would require that robot to be in row >=2, which it isn't. So moving up is not possible. Wait, so if any robot is in row 1 and wants to move up, it can't. Hmm.",

Let me see what the minimal steps would be for robot R. \n\nSuppose R is at (r, c). To get to (1,1), it needs to move north (r-1) times and west (c-1) times. The directions can be in any order, but each step must be a direction that is allowed. The key is that whenever we choose to move up (U), all robots must be in rows >=2 (so their current rows are at least 2). Similarly, whenever we choose to move left (L), all robots must be in columns >=2. So, in order to move up, all robots must be in rows >=2. So for robot R to move up, it must be in row >=2, and other robots must also be in rows >=2. Thus, the problem reduces to, for robot R, can we find a path of directions consisting of (r-1) U's and (c-1) L's arranged in some order such that:\n\n- For every U in the sequence:\n\n   All robots (including R) are in rows >=2 before the U move. - For every L in the sequence:\n\n   All robots (including R) are in columns >=2 before the L move. Additionally, after all moves, R is at (1,1). So, the problem is to see if such a sequence exists for any R. \n\nHmm, this seems like a promising approach. Let me formalize this for a single robot R: Suppose R is at (r, c). To reach (1,1), it needs (r-1) U steps and (c-1) L steps. These steps must be ordered in such a way that: \n\nFor each U step in the sequence, before that step, all robots are in rows >=2. For each L step in the sequence, before that step, all robots are in columns >=2. Also, after all steps, R is at (1,1). The question is whether such a sequence of steps exists. This seems manageable, but how do we check this for all robots?",

Ah right. So, for R to move up from row r to row r-1, all other robots must be in row >=2. But other robots can be in row 1 only if we don't choose to move up before they've moved elsewhere.

Let me think of the sample input 2 from the note:\n\nSample input 2:\n\nSuppose there are two robots in (1,2) and (2,1). If we want to move either to (1,1), the following happens:\n\nMoving left (for the first robot) would require all robots to be in columns >=2. The second robot is in column 1, so this is not allowed. Moving up would require all robots in rows >=2. The first robot is in row 1, so invalid. Moving down: the second robot is in row 2, so moving down would take them to row 3? Wait, no, the command for down would be direction down, so each robot moves down by 1.",

So for S's initial column: \n\nAfter first left move: column s_col -1 After second: s_col-2 \n\nAfter third: s_col-3 \n\nThese must all be >=1. So the third left move requires s_col-3 >=1 \u2192 s_col >=4. The first left move requires s_col >=2. So the most restrictive is the third move: s_col >=4. Thus, for other robots to survive those 3 left moves, their initial column must be >=4. But then, if another robot is at column 3, then after 3 left moves, it would be at column 0 (3-3=0), which is invalid. Ah, therefore, in order for R to move left (c-1) times, the other robots must be initially in columns >= c. \n\nBecause after (c-1) steps, their columns would be s_col - (c-1) \u22651 \u2192 s_col \u2265 c. \n\nThus, the other robots must be in columns > = c. \n\nWait, that's a very strict condition. Similarly for the up moves. For each up move required by R (r-1 times), the other robots' initial rows must be >= r. \n\nBecause after (r-1) up moves, their rows would be s_row - (r-1) \u22651 \u2192 s_row \u2265 r. \n\nAh!",

Also, if any robot is already at (1,1), then answer is YES. Thus, the steps for the solution are: For each test case:\n\n1. Check if any robot is already at (1,1). If yes, output YES. \n\n2. Else, for each robot R:\n\n   a. Let r = row of R, c = column of R. \n\n   b. Check whether all other robots are in rows \u2265 r and columns \u2265 c. \n\n   c. If for any such R, this is true, then output YES. 3. If none of the above, output NO. This seems like a promising approach. Testing this against the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: \n\nFirst test case (from note): Suppose input has a robot at (1,2). Other robots? The problem states there's at least one robot. Suppose only that robot. Then for R's row is 1, column 2. Other robots (none) trivially satisfy the condition. Thus, YES. Sample 2:\n\nTwo robots at (1,2) and (2,1). For the first robot (1,2):\n\nOther robot is at (2,1). The other robot's row (2) is \u2265 1 (yes), but its column (1) must be >= 2? No. So not valid. For the second robot (2,1):\n\nOther robot's column is 2, which must be >=1's column (1). Yes. But other robot's row is 1 which must be >=2? No. Thus, no robots meet the condition \u2192 output NO. Sample 3: \n\nThird test case (from note): \n\nA robot at (1,3). Other robots may be in columns \u22653 and rows \u22651. If there are other robots not in columns \u22653, then it won't work. Assuming they are in valid places. Thus, moving left twice would work. Sample 4: \n\nAlready has a robot in (1,1) \u2192 YES. Sample 5:\n\nThe example where a sequence of up, left, up is needed. Wait, let's see. Suppose the robot starts at (3,2). To reach (1,1), need up twice and left once. Other robots must be in rows >=3 and columns >=2. Assume they are. Then the steps can be done. Thus, the condition holds. Thus, the approach seems correct. Therefore, the problem reduces to checking whether any robot R has all other robots in rows >= R's row AND columns >= R's column. Additionally, check if any robot is already at (1,1). Thus, the code should be: For each test case:\n\n- Read the grid. - Check if any cell (1,1) is 'R'. If yes, output YES. \n\n- Else, for each robot in the grid: For each cell (i,j) that is a 'R':\n\n      Check for this (i,j): \n\n      all other 'R's are in rows >=i and columns >=j. If any such exists \u2192 output YES. - If none: output NO. Thus, the code needs to implement this. Now, the original code's partial code: The code has loops over i and j from 1 to b and c. \n\nInside the loop, it has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". The code's variables include a 2D array 'a'? Wait looking back at the provided code: The code starts with:\n\nchar a[6][6];\n\nIn main: \n\nfor each test case, read n, m (stored in b and c). Then loops over i from 1 to b, and j from 1 to c. The code needs to read the grid and check conditions. The given code's a is not initialized. The original code's structure is incomplete. We need to fill in the code to read the grid properly. Wait, the code currently has a loop that for each test case, loops over rows and columns. The code has:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++) \n\n   for(int j=1; j<=c; j++) {\n\n      /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   } The first step is to read the grid for each test case. So the missing code inside the loop must read the characters into the grid. Probably the code should read each character for the grid. The code has a variable 's' declared as char s; but it's not used. Perhaps the code should read each line of the grid. Wait, the input has n lines, each of m characters. Thus, for each row i, we need to read a string of length m. In C++, this can be done with a loop over the rows. The current code loops over i and j, but in a nested loop. Perhaps the correct way is to read each row as a string, then process each character.",

So the missing code inside the loops is to read each character of the grid into a[i][j]. Assuming the rows are read one by one, and for each row, the characters are read in the inner loop. Thus, the code inside the loops would be something like:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nHowever, since each row is a string of m characters, this might not work. Alternatively, the code might be using a character array and reading from cin as a stream. Another approach is to read the entire row as a string, then assign each character. But the current code's loops are nested, so the code could do:\n\nstring s; \n\ncin >> s; Then, for the current row i, loop over each character. But the current loops are nested, so perhaps the code needs to read each character one by one. Alternatively, perhaps the code should read the initial 'cin >> b >> c', then read each row's characters. The provided code has:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++)\n\n   for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n      /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   } So the code is looping over each row and column, and inside the inner loop, it needs to read the character at (i,j). Thus, the code can read each character with cin >> a[i][j]; \n\nAssuming the 'a' array is correctly declared. Thus, the missing code would be:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut since in C++, when reading characters from cin, it might skip whitespace, so this may not work if the input is given as a grid without spaces. Alternatively, the code can use getchar() to read each character. Alternatively, perhaps using a string buffer. An example of code to read the grid:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= b; i++) {\n\n    for (int j = 1; j <= c; j++) {\n\n        cin >> a[i][j];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut this would require that each character is separated by spaces, which it's not. The input lines for the grid are strings of characters with no spaces. Hence, the correct way is: For each row in 1..b:\n\n   read a string of length m, then assign each character to a[i][j]. Thus, in the code:\n\nInside the outer loop over i (the rows), read a string, then process each character in the string. Thus, the code would have:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; ++i) {\n\n    string s;\n\n    cin >> s;\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; ++j) {\n\n        a[i][j] = s[j-1]; // since strings are 0-based, while the code uses 1-based indices.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the original loops are nested, which may not be the case.",

Thus, the code would be:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++){\n\n    string s;\n\n    cin >> s;\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the code provided, the j loop is inside the i loop. So the given code has the outer for loops as:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++)\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    } Thus, for each i and j, the code is inside the inner loop. Thus, perhaps the code should read the entire string first, then assign. But how to do that in this loop structure? Perhaps the code can read the string outside the j loop, like this:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++) {\n\n    string s;\n\n    cin >> s;\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\n    }\n\n} But this code is not inside the given nested loops. Alternatively, the code may have to read each character individually, but in the nested loops. Alternatively, the code may use a separate variable to read the string.",

Thus, perhaps the code should use: \n\ncin >> s; But that would read a single character? Alternatively, the code may have to read the entire input row by row, and then character by character. Perhaps the code should use:\n\ncin.get(a[i][j]); \n\nBut then need to deal with the newlines. Alternatively, the following code may work: \n\nfor(int i= 1; i <=b; i++){\n\n    for(int j=1; j <=c; j++){\n\n        cin >> a[i][j];\n\n    }\n\n} But this would require that each character is separated by whitespace. But in the problem's input, this is not the case. Thus, this approach is incorrect. Hmm. Perhaps the correct approach is to read each character one by one, skipping any whitespace, including newlines. In C++, the code can be written as follows: \n\nfor(int i=1; i <=b; i++) {\n\n    for(int j=1; j <=c; j++){\n\n        char ch;\n\n        cin >> ch;\n\n        a[i][j] = ch;\n\n    }\n\n} But this assumes that the input is given with each character in the row separated by spaces, but in the problem statement's input, the rows are given as strings without spaces between characters. So this would not work. Alternatively, the code can read the entire line using getline(), then process each character. Thus, inside the loops:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++){\n\n    string s;\n\n    getline(cin, s); \n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the first test case's input may have leading or trailing whitespaces. Alternatively, the first line after t has b and c, then n lines of strings. Thus, after reading b and c, we can read the next lines as strings. The code's current loops are for reading the grid. The code given has the loops over i and j, and the TODO section is there. Thus, the code must be filled with the way to read the characters. Perhaps the code should be:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut since the input is in a row as a string, this would not work. Alternatively, the code may be using the variable 's' which is declared but unused. The code declares a 'char s;' but not used. Perhaps the code has an error in the variable name. Alternatively, perhaps the code should use a string array. This is getting very complicated. Perhaps the correct way is to read each row as a string inside the first loop (i), then process each character. Thus, the code inside the outer loop (for each row) would be: \n\nstring s; \n\ncin >> s; \n\nthen for each j, a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\nThus, the code's loops are nested, so this can be done by:\n\nInside the outer loop over i:\n\nfor (int j=1; j<=c; j++) But in the current code, the for j loop is already inside. Thus, the code inside the TODO section should read the input into a[i][j]. Thus, the code's missing part is:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut this may not work due to input formatting. Alternatively, the code can read the entire string into 's', then assign each character in the loop.",

So if the input is given as strings with no spaces, then the first >> reads the first character, then the next >> reads the second, etc. For example, if the input is \"RE\\n\" then the first cin >> a[i][j] would read 'R', the next 'E', and so on. Assuming that the input is given correctly without any extra spaces between the characters, this may work. Therefore, the missing code is: \n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nThus, the code inside the inner for loop (the j loop) is cin >> a[i][j]; \n\nAdditionally, after filling the grid, the code has the line:\n\nif (a[x][y] == 'R') cout << \"YES\\n\"; \n\nWait, where are x and y defined? Looking back at the provided code: The code has the variables x and y initialized to b and c. \n\nWait, the code has:\n\nint x = b, y = c; Thus, x is the number of rows (b), and y the number of columns (c). Thus, the condition checks if a[x][y] is 'R', which is a[b][c], the bottom-right cell. This is incorrect. The condition is checking whether the bottom-right cell contains a robot. Which is not related to the upper-left cell. This indicates that the provided code has a bug and the TODO section is not the only problem. The problem requires checking if any robot is already in the upper-left corner (1,1). Thus, the code's current condition is wrong. The code's final line is:\n\nif(a[x][y] == 'R') cout << \"YES\\n\"; \n\nWhere x and y are set to b and c. This is incorrect. The correct condition should be checking a[1][1]. Thus, this is another error in the provided code. Hence, the problem requires not only filling the missing code in the TODO section, but also fixing the condition.",

But given the constraints of the problem, this is what we have to do. So, the missing code is simply 'cin >> a[i][j];' But in the initial code's variables, the array 'a' is declared as a 6x6 array, which is correct since n and m are up to 5. Thus, the correct code for the missing part is:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; Now, after filling that, the code will read the grid properly. Then, the rest of the code has an incorrect condition. The code currently checks if a[x][y] is 'R', which is a[b][c]. Thus, the code will output YES only if the bottom-right cell is a robot, which is incorrect.",

However, each time you move up, all robots must be in rows >=2 (so that they can move up). Similarly, every time you move left, all robots must be in columns >=2.

If yes, then output is YES. Other cases, we have to see if there is a way. Let me think of the problem as a BFS state. Each state is the current positions of all robots. Since the grid is small (n and m up to 5), the number of possible states is manageable. Wait, but each robot can be anywhere in the grid. Suppose there are k robots. The number of possible positions for each robot is n*m. So the total number of states is (n*m)^k. Since n and m are up to 5, and k up to 25, this is not feasible for k=25. But given that n and m are small (max 5), perhaps for small grids, we can model it. But since the constraints allow n and m up to 5 and for each test case, the number of robots could be up to 25, this approach might not be feasible. Hmm. Maybe there's a smarter way.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if at least one robot can reach the upper left corner without any exploding. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe input is a grid with R's and E's. All robots move simultaneously in the given direction each time. If any robot moves outside the grid, it explodes, which is bad. We need to ensure that at least one robot can reach the top-left corner (which is position (1,1) in their notation, since rows and columns start at 1?), and none of the robots explode in the process. \n\nHmm, the key is to find a sequence of moves where, after some steps, at least one robot is at (1,1), and during all those moves, no robot steps outside the grid. \n\nLet's think about how to model this. Since the grid is small (n and m up to 5), maybe we can simulate all possible sequences of moves for the robots? But the problem allows any number of commands, so that might not be feasible directly. Alternatively, perhaps we can find conditions that must be met for a robot to reach (1,1) without causing any others to explode.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the positions of all robots and see if there exists a direction sequence such that after moving, one robot is at (1,1), and all moves are valid. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to consider the possible positions each robot can be in after each step, but since all robots move at the same time, we need to track their positions collectively. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be considered as a state transition problem where each state is the set of robot positions, and transitions are the moves. We need to see if there's a path from the initial state to a state where at least one robot is at (1,1), and all moves are valid. \n\nBut with n and m up to 5, the maximum number of robots is 25. However, since each robot can be in any cell, the state space would be enormous. That might not be feasible. So perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, think of each robot's path. For a robot to reach the top-left (1,1), it must be able to reach there without any move causing it to go out of bounds, and also, during the same steps, other robots must not go out of bounds.\n\nWait, the moves are all done in the same command sequence. Suppose the command sequence is a list of directions (like up, left, etc.), and each robot follows each direction in order. \n\nWait, the command is sent one at a time. Each command is a direction, and every robot moves in that direction. So the order of commands matters. But the problem allows any number of commands, so the sequence can be as long as needed. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Let's consider that for a robot to reach (1,1), there must be some direction sequence such that after applying those directions, the robot is at (1,1), and during each step of the sequence, no robot moves outside the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a direction such that, when all robots move in that direction, at least one robot reaches (1,1) and no robot goes out. But maybe even more, we can do multiple steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the critical point is that the robot can reach (1,1) in some steps, but also, in all steps along the way, all other robots must not go out of bounds. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each robot, we can check whether there exists a path for it to reach (1,1) such that, when it does so, all other robots are still within the grid. \n\nBut considering all robots' paths together is complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key insight is that in order for a robot to reach the top-left corner without any robot exploding, the following must be true for at least one robot:\n\n- The robot can reach (1,1) in some number of steps, moving only in directions that don't cause it or any other robot to step out of bounds. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the positions of the robots must allow that, when moving in certain directions, one robot can reach (1,1) while others are still within the grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the constraints for each robot. Let me think of the initial positions of the robots. Let me denote the initial positions of all robots as (r_i, c_i). \n\nSuppose we want robot R to end up at (1,1). Let\u2019s say the direction sequence is such that after applying the commands, R reaches (1,1). The path for R must be such that each step's direction moves it towards (1,1) without going out. But also, all other robots must not step out in the process. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the robot can reach (1,1) in one step. For example, if a robot is already there, output yes. Or if there is a robot at (1,2), then moving left would take it to (1,1). But in that case, check if that movement is possible without any robot moving outside. \n\nWait, when moving left, all robots move left. So any robot in column 1 would go to column 0, which is invalid, so they would explode. \n\nTherefore, for that to be possible, there must be no robot in column 1 (since moving left would cause them to go out of the grid) when we choose to move left. \n\nSo in the example where a robot is at (1,2), to move it left to (1,1), but also check that no other robots are in column 1 (so that their move left doesn't take them out). \n\nWait, if there is a robot in column 1, then moving left would cause it to go to 0, so that's an explosion. So in order to move left, all robots must be in columns >=2. \n\nSo, for any direction command, all robots must be positioned such that moving in that direction doesn't take any of them outside the grid. \n\nTherefore, the commands must be chosen such that each time you issue a direction, all robots can move in that direction without stepping out. \n\nOur goal is to find a sequence of such directions, so that at some step, at least one robot is at (1,1). \n\nHmm, so perhaps the way to model this is to represent the possible positions of all robots after each move, but since the grid is small, maybe it's manageable. However, since the number of robots can be up to 25 (for 5x5 grid), even that's impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of tracking all robots, for each robot, we can see whether there exists a path to (1,1) such that for each step in its path, the direction is chosen such that at least that robot can move towards (1,1), and all other robots are still within the grid when moving in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, since all moves are synchronized, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: \n\nWe can choose any sequence of direction commands (each command is one direction). After each command, every robot must be in the grid. The question is whether after some number of commands, at least one robot is at (1,1). \n\nThe challenge is to find such a sequence. \n\nHmm. Let me think of possible approaches. \n\nFirst, the upper-left corner is (1,1). So for a robot to be there, either it's already there (so output yes immediately?), or we can move it there via some commands. \n\nThe first step is to check if any robot is already at (1,1). If yes, then output is YES. \n\nOther cases, we have to see if there is a way. \n\nLet me think of the problem as a BFS state. Each state is the current positions of all robots. Since the grid is small (n and m up to 5), the number of possible states is manageable. \n\nWait, but each robot can be anywhere in the grid. Suppose there are k robots. The number of possible positions for each robot is n*m. So the total number of states is (n*m)^k. Since n and m are up to 5, and k up to 25, this is not feasible for k=25. \n\nBut given that n and m are small (max 5), perhaps for small grids, we can model it. But since the constraints allow n and m up to 5 and for each test case, the number of robots could be up to 25, this approach might not be feasible. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a smarter way. \n\nAlternative Idea: For each robot, we can see whether it can reach (1,1) via some path, and in such a way that, during the path, all other robots can also move in the directions required without going out of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, the key is that in the sequence of directions chosen, each direction must be such that all robots (including the one moving towards (1,1)) can move in that direction. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be broken down as:\n\nWe want a set of directions (a sequence) such that:\n\n1. After applying all the directions in order, at least one robot is at (1,1).\n\n2. For each direction in the sequence, all robots are in positions where moving in that direction doesn't take them outside the grid.\n\nSo, the sequence of directions must be such that each individual direction is allowable (all robots can move in that direction without exploding). \n\nThe challenge is to find such a sequence. \n\nHmm. To model this, perhaps, for each robot, the path to (1,1) would require certain steps. For example, robot R at (i,j) can reach (1,1) only if, through a series of moves, each step's direction allows it to move closer, but also, other robots can also move in those directions without leaving the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be rephrased for each robot as follows: \n\nSuppose the robot R is at (r, c). To reach (1,1), it must have a path of directions where: \n\nEach step's direction is such that:\n\n- For all other robots, moving in that direction doesn't take them out. \n\n- The direction must allow R to move towards (1,1) in each step. \n\nWait, but the direction is global. So the direction must be such that all robots can move in that direction. \n\nThus, each direction in the sequence must be one that all robots can move in. \n\nTherefore, to have a valid sequence, each step's direction must be a direction such that all robots can move in that direction (i.e., their current row/col allows it). \n\nMoreover, after some such steps, at least one robot is at (1,1). \n\nHmm. So the problem reduces to whether there exists a sequence of directions (each direction must be such that all robots can move in it) such that after applying those directions, at least one robot is in (1,1). \n\nSo, the approach is: \n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Check if any robot is already at (1,1). If yes, return YES.\n\n2. Else, check if there exists a sequence of directions (each direction valid for current positions) such that after applying them, one robot reaches (1,1). \n\nThe question is, how to check this efficiently. \n\nThe possible directions are up, down, left, right. Each direction must be compatible with current positions. \n\nHmm, since the grid is small, perhaps we can model this as a BFS where the state is the current positions of all robots. However, even with n=5, m=5, and 25 robots, this is impossible. Wait but the problem states that each test case has at least one robot. So maybe for some cases, but even 5x5 grid with 25 robots would be (25)^25 possible states which is way too big. \n\nHmm but perhaps the number of robots is small. The actual number of robots is the number of 'R's in the grid. For each test case, the number of robots is up to 25, but in practice, perhaps the problem can be formulated in terms of each robot's possible movement without considering all the others. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary and sufficient conditions can be found without simulating all possibilities. \n\nLet me think of the following conditions:\n\nSuppose a robot can reach (1,1) via some direction choices, then:\n\n- The robot's starting position must be such that it can get to (1,1) through a path of directions that are allowed (i.e., in each step, all robots can move in that direction). \n\nWait but the directions have to be chosen such that when you choose a direction, all robots can move in that direction. \n\nTherefore, for a robot to reach (1,1), there must exist a sequence of directions where:\n\n- Each direction is valid for all robots in their current positions (i.e., moving in that direction does not take any robot out of the grid).\n\n- The robot's path via those directions leads to (1,1). \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of each direction step. \n\nSuppose we have a set of directions. Let me think of the direction as a vector (delta row, delta column) for each direction:\n\nUp: (-1, 0)\n\nRight: (0, +1)\n\nDown: (1, 0)\n\nLeft: (0, -1)\n\nEach step must be one of these four options, but only if all robots can take that step. \n\nSo, the direction is chosen each time such that for every robot, when they move in that direction's delta, they stay within the grid. \n\nThe problem is to find a sequence of such directions, leading to (1,1) for at least one robot. \n\nHmm. Let me think of possible steps. \n\nThe idea is to find a way for at least one robot to reach (1,1) through a series of moves where each move is possible for all robots. \n\nFirst, the initial positions. Let me take each robot's starting position and see what possibilities they have. \n\nSuppose there is a robot at (1, 2). To get it to (1,1), we can move left once. But, for that move to be allowed, all other robots must not be in column 1 (since moving left would take them to 0, which is out of grid). So if any other robot is in column 1, then moving left is impossible. \n\nAlternatively, if another robot is at (3,1), then moving left would take it to column 0, so that direction is invalid. So to move left in that case is not allowed. \n\nSo in order to move left, all robots must be in columns >= 2. \n\nSimilarly, to move right, all must be in columns <= m-1. \n\nTo move up, all must be in rows >= 2 (since moving up from row 1 would take them to 0, which is invalid). \n\nWait, moving up: each robot's row must be > 1? Because moving up one step from row 1 would go to row 0, which is invalid. So, for moving up, all robots must be in rows >=2. \n\nSame for moving down: all robots must be in rows <= n-1. \n\nAh right. \n\nSo, for each direction, the entire set of robots must satisfy the constraints for that direction. \n\nSo the steps needed must only choose directions that are allowed based on the current positions of all robots. \n\nHmm, so the problem requires us to model the transitions between the positions of the robots in such a way that each step is a direction that is allowed. \n\nBut since even with small grids, the number of possible states is too big, perhaps we can think of it as a BFS where the state is the current positions of all robots. But even so, for a 5x5 grid with, say, 5 robots, the state would have 25^5 possibilities, which is way too big. \n\nHmm. Maybe instead of tracking all robots, we can find a condition that must be true for at least one robot to reach (1,1). \n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of possible movements required for a particular robot to reach (1,1). Suppose robot R is at (r, c). To get to (1,1), the robot must move up (r-1) times and left (c-1) times. \n\nBut the problem is that in order to do that, the directions must be chosen such that those moves can be done in a sequence while not causing other robots to move out. \n\nWait, but the directions are chosen each time, so the order in which the robot moves up and left can be interleaved with other directions. \n\nAlternatively, suppose the robot can reach (1,1) through a series of moves where the directions are such that whenever moving up or left, those directions are allowed. \n\nSo, for example, if the robot is at (2,3):\n\nIt can move left twice (to get to column 1), then move up once (to row 1). \n\nBut in each of those steps, all other robots must be able to move in those directions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key idea is that for the robot to reach (1,1), there must exist a path where, for each step of direction chosen (either left, up, etc.), the direction is allowed (so all robots can move in that direction). \n\nTherefore, the robot can only move towards (1,1) in directions that are allowed. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem can be approached by considering for each robot whether it can potentially reach (1,1) by moving left/down/up/right in such a way that the required direction steps are possible given the constraints of other robots' positions. \n\nAlternatively, here's another idea: \n\nThe only way a robot can reach (1,1) is if, in some step, the direction allows it to arrive at (1,1) without any explosion. \n\nSuppose we want to have a direction sequence that ends with moving left from (1,2) to (1,1). Then, before that step, the robot must be at (1,2), and in that step, all robots must be in valid positions for moving left. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered by pre-processing all robots' possible paths and see if any path can be followed without violating constraints. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach: For a robot to reach (1,1), it must be possible that in some step, moving in a direction that brings it to (1,1) is possible, and all other robots are not in positions that would block the direction. \n\nLet me think of the robot's path as a set of steps. Let's consider all possible directions that could lead it to (1,1). For example, if the robot is at (1, 2), then moving left once will get it there. But only if all robots can move left (i.e., all are in cols >=2). \n\nAlternatively, if the robot is at (2,1), then moving up will bring it to (1,1). But only if all robots can move up (i.e., their rows are >=2). \n\nHmm. \n\nThe problem requires that there exists some sequence of directions such that, after executing them, at least one robot is at (1,1) and all steps are valid. \n\nPerhaps the solution can be found by checking for each robot whether there's a direction that, when followed once, moves it to (1,1), and that direction is possible (i.e., all robots can move in that direction). \n\nIf any such robot exists, then the answer is YES. \n\nIf not, check for sequences of two steps, etc. But since the number of steps can be arbitrary, this approach might not be feasible. \n\nWait, but the maximum possible steps needed would be limited by the grid size. Because each step can move a robot at most one step closer to (1,1) in some direction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as BFS where each state is the current position of all robots, and transitions are the possible directions (allowed moves). \n\nBut even with this, for small grid sizes (n and m up to 5), the number of possible states is manageable. Because the number of robots is up to 25, but even that's too big. \n\nWait, but the problem requires at least one robot to reach (1,1). So perhaps we can model the state as the positions of all robots, but given that the problem is only to have one robot reach (1,1), perhaps we can track whether that has happened yet. \n\nAlternatively, here's another Idea:\n\nEach robot can only reach (1,1) if it can get there through some path of moves that doesn't make any robot explode. \n\nThe key constraints are that for each direction chosen:\n\n- All robots must be able to move that direction. \n\nFor instance, moving up requires all robots to be in rows >=2. \n\nMoving left requires all robots to be in cols >=2. \n\nMoving down requires all robots in rows <=n-1. \n\nMoving right requires all in cols <= m-1. \n\nSo, for a particular robot to reach (1,1), the path must have steps that allow that robot to get there. \n\nSuppose robot R's path requires moving left (c-1) times and moving up (r-1) times. \n\nBut the directions must be chosen in such a way that all robots can move in that direction each time. \n\nSuppose we can find a sequence of directions where the robot's required moves are allowed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps required for a robot to reach (1,1) must be such that the robot can reach it in some way, and the other robots don't block the path. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\nWe can precompute for each robot whether there exists a path from its starting position to (1,1) such that the path's required directions are compatible with all other robots. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nFor a robot to reach (1,1):\n\n1. Its starting position must be such that it can reach (1,1) by moving only left/up/down/right, but in a way that, for each move in the path, all robots can move in that direction. \n\nWait, but how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, the following must be true:\n\nSuppose robot R is at (r, c). \n\nTo reach (1,1), it must move up (r-1) times and left (c-1) times, but the order can vary. \n\nHowever, each time you move up, all robots must be in rows >=2 (so that they can move up). \n\nSimilarly, every time you move left, all robots must be in columns >=2. \n\nWait, but other robots may not allow this. \n\nFor example, suppose another robot is at (3, 1). Then, moving left would require all robots to be in columns >=2. The robot at (3,1) is in column 1, so that move left is impossible. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo, the problem is that for any robot to reach (1,1), there must exist a path of directions that can be taken such that each direction is allowed (all robots can move in that direction), and after some steps, the robot is at (1,1). \n\nAlternatively, here's an Idea inspired by BFS:\n\nThe state is the current positions of all robots. \n\nThe initial state is their starting positions. \n\nEach possible move (direction) is a transition if the direction is allowed (i.e., all robots can move in that direction). \n\nThe transitions are moving all robots in that direction. \n\nWe need to see if any of the states in the reachable states has a robot at (1,1). \n\nThe problem is to see if such a state exists. \n\nSince the grid size is small, but the number of robots can be up to 25, this could be computationally challenging. \n\nWait but the constraints are n and m up to 5. Let's compute the possible number of states. Let's say there are K robots. The number of possible positions for each robot is n*m. The total states are (n*m)^K. \n\nBut K can be up to 25, so even for n=5 and m=5, that's 25^25 which is way too big. \n\nThus, this approach is not feasible. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a smarter way. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is that all robots must not block the path of at least one robot. \n\nWait, the robot we choose to reach (1,1) must have a path where, for each step in the path's direction, all other robots can also move in that direction. \n\nThus, the path for that particular robot must be such that, when moving in the direction, other robots are in positions that allow them to move in that direction. \n\nAlternatively, for the moving robot, the direction sequence must be such that each direction allows it to move towards (1,1), and also allows all other robots to move in that direction. \n\nLet me think of specific conditions for a robot at (r, c) to reach (1,1):\n\n- For it to reach there by moving left (c-1) times and up (r-1) times in some order, each move must be allowed. \n\nBut the allowed moves must also not cause any robot (including others) to go out of the grid. \n\nWait, but other robots can be anywhere else, except that their positions must allow the direction. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the problem can be rephrased as: \n\nThere exists a direction sequence such that after executing it, at least one robot is at (1,1) and all steps are valid. \n\nTo check this, perhaps the following is necessary and sufficient:\n\nThere exists a robot R such that:\n\n1. The robot R can reach (1,1) through some sequence of directions where each direction chosen is valid for all robots in their current positions. \n\nWait, but how to find that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a robot to reach (1,1), the following must be true:\n\n- The robot's initial row must allow it to reach row 1 via up moves, and column 1 via left moves, but ensuring that in the process, during the steps when moving up, all other robots are in rows >=2 (so that moving up is allowed), and during steps moving left, all other robots are in columns >=2 (so that moving left is allowed). \n\nHmm, but it's hard to see how to model this. \n\nAnother Idea: For the robot to reach (1,1), all other robots must not be in positions that would block certain moves. \n\nFor instance, if there's another robot in row 1 (other than the first column), then moving up would require that robot to be in row >=2, which it isn't. So moving up is not possible. \n\nWait, so if any robot is in row 1 and wants to move up, it can't. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the only way for a robot to reach (1,1) is that in its path, the necessary directions are allowed given the other robots' positions. \n\nWait, perhaps it's possible if the following conditions are met for the robot:\n\n- The robot's starting position is such that it can move left exactly (c-1) times and up (r-1) times. \n\nAdditionally, during each step, all other robots are in positions that allow that direction. \n\nWait, but how to check this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each robot R whether there exists a direction sequence that allows R to reach (1,1) without any other robot exploding. \n\nTo do this, the path of R must be such that:\n\n- The direction sequence is such that every step's direction is one that R needs to move closer to (1,1), but also, all other robots can move in those directions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the critical point is that for the robot to move towards (1,1), the other robots must not block certain moves. \n\nWait, but I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think of the problem in terms of constraints imposed by other robots. \n\nFor example, suppose the robot R is at (2,2). To get to (1,1), it can move up then left, or left then up. \n\nHowever, for the 'up' move, all other robots must be in rows >=2. \n\nSuppose there exists another robot at (1,3). Then, moving up would cause that robot to move to (0,3), which is invalid. So the 'up' move is not allowed. \n\nTherefore, in this case, R cannot reach (1,1) using that path. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nFor any robot to reach (1,1), it's necessary that:\n\n- The robot can reach (1,1) by moving only left and up directions (since those are the only directions needed to reduce row and column to 1). \n\n- Additionally, all other robots must not block the possibility of choosing those directions. \n\nWait, but other robots can also move in those directions. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows:\n\nSuppose we are considering a particular robot R which we want to get to (1,1). We need to choose a sequence of directions (each direction must be allowed by all robots in their current state) such that R reaches (1,1). \n\nLet me see what the minimal steps would be for robot R. \n\nSuppose R is at (r, c). To get to (1,1), it needs to move north (r-1) times and west (c-1) times. \n\nThe directions can be in any order, but each step must be a direction that is allowed. \n\nThe key is that whenever we choose to move up (U), all robots must be in rows >=2 (so their current rows are at least 2). \n\nSimilarly, whenever we choose to move left (L), all robots must be in columns >=2. \n\nSo, in order to move up, all robots must be in rows >=2. \n\nSo for robot R to move up, it must be in row >=2, and other robots must also be in rows >=2. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to, for robot R, can we find a path of directions consisting of (r-1) U's and (c-1) L's arranged in some order such that:\n\n- For every U in the sequence:\n\n   All robots (including R) are in rows >=2 before the U move. \n\n- For every L in the sequence:\n\n   All robots (including R) are in columns >=2 before the L move. \n\nAdditionally, after all moves, R is at (1,1). \n\nSo, the problem is to see if such a sequence exists for any R. \n\nHmm, this seems like a promising approach. \n\nLet me formalize this for a single robot R:\n\nSuppose R is at (r, c). To reach (1,1), it needs (r-1) U steps and (c-1) L steps. \n\nThese steps must be ordered in such a way that: \n\nFor each U step in the sequence, before that step, all robots are in rows >=2. \n\nFor each L step in the sequence, before that step, all robots are in columns >=2. \n\nAlso, after all steps, R is at (1,1). \n\nThe question is whether such a sequence of steps exists. \n\nThis seems manageable, but how do we check this for all robots? \n\nPerhaps, for each robot R, we can check whether there exists a sequence of steps (U and L) that allows it to reach (1,1), while ensuring that for all steps, the above conditions hold. \n\nBut how to model this efficiently? \n\nLet me think of this as a path where each step is either U or L, with the constraints on the other robots. \n\nHowever, the other robots' positions depend on their initial positions and the sequence of steps taken so far. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nThe minimal requirement for R to reach (1,1) is:\n\nAll other robots must not have any robot in a position that would prevent the required directions. \n\nFor instance, to move up (U) steps for R, there must be no other robot in row 1. \n\nWait, not exactly: other robots can be in row 1, but then moving up is not allowed because those robots would go out. \n\nAh right. So, for R to move up from row r to row r-1, all other robots must be in row >=2. \n\nBut other robots can be in row 1 only if we don't choose to move up before they've moved elsewhere. \n\nHmm, it's really a dependency problem. \n\nPerhaps the following conditions must be met for a robot R:\n\n- The starting position of R allows it to reach (1,1) by moving only U and L steps. \n\n- Additionally, for all other robots, their starting positions must not block the necessary moves. \n\nWait, maybe the following sufficient conditions can be formulated:\n\nFor R to reach (1,1), the following must hold:\n\n1. R is already at (1,1). \n\n2. Or, the required directions (U and L) can be done in such a way that all other robots are positioned to allow those moves. \n\nWait, perhaps another Idea:\n\nThe key is that all robots except R can be anywhere as long as they don't prevent the required moves. \n\nWait, but R's path requires that during the move steps, all other robots can also move in those directions. \n\nSo, the other robots may need to be able to move in those directions. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the following must be true for R: \n\n- The initial positions of all other robots must not be in a way that blocks the required directions for R's path. \n\nWait, but how? \n\nAlternatively, the following must be true for the robot R to have a path to (1,1):\n\n- The robot can reach (1,1) via a path of moves that only require directions that can be done without any other robot moving out of bounds. \n\nWait, but how to determine this? \n\nPerhaps the other way: Let's assume that we are to move R to (1,1) using only the moves that are allowed by other robots. \n\nFor the required directions (U and L steps), we must have that during those steps, no other robot is in a position that would prevent those directions. \n\nFor example, suppose we first move all the robots to the left first. \n\nWait, but this is tricky. \n\nMaybe it's easier to think of it as for a robot to reach (1,1), the following must be true:\n\nThe robot can move to (1,1) by moving only left and up directions, and:\n\n- For all other robots, their initial positions are such that they can move in the required directions. \n\nWait, but this isn't enough. \n\nAlternatively, here's an Idea inspired by the sample inputs. \n\nLet me think of the sample input 2 from the note:\n\nSample input 2:\n\nSuppose there are two robots in (1,2) and (2,1). \n\nIf we want to move either to (1,1), the following happens:\n\nMoving left (for the first robot) would require all robots to be in columns >=2. The second robot is in column 1, so this is not allowed. \n\nMoving up would require all robots in rows >=2. The first robot is in row 1, so invalid. \n\nMoving down: the second robot is in row 2, so moving down would take them to row 3? Wait, no, the command for down would be direction down, so each robot moves down by 1. \n\nWait, but the second robot is in row 2, so moving down takes it to row 3, which is okay if n is big enough. But in any case, the first robot can't move down from row 1. \n\nSo in this case, no direction can be chosen without a robot exploding. Hence output NO. \n\nThe problem here is that the two robots are in positions that block all possible directions. \n\nSo the key idea is that for at least one robot, there must exist a way to move it to (1,1) without requiring any other robot to move into a position that would explode. \n\nSo, to solve this problem:\n\nWe can consider each robot R and see if there exists a path for R to reach (1,1) by moving only left and up directions, and that all the other robots can also move in those directions. \n\nWait, but the other robots can move in any direction, but the directions must be chosen such that all can move. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach would work: \n\nFor each robot R, check if it can reach (1,1) by moving only left and up steps, and at the same time, the other robots are positioned such that they can also move in those directions without going out of the grid. \n\nWait, but the other robots may be able to move in those directions. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nFor the robot R to reach (1,1), the following must hold:\n\n- After some sequence of directions (all allowed), the robot is at (1,1). \n\nThe allowed sequence must be such that each direction in the sequence is a direction which all robots can move in at that point. \n\nThus, for R to reach (1,1), there must be a path of directions (a sequence) such that:\n\nThe path consists of a series of moves that eventually bring R to (1,1). \n\nEach step in the path must be a direction that is allowable given the current positions of all robots before that step. \n\nNow, perhaps the minimal path for R is to move left (c-1) times and up (r-1) times, in any order. \n\nBut to do so, the directions must be chosen in such a way that when moving left, all other robots are in columns >=2. \n\nSimilarly, when moving up, all are in rows >=2. \n\nThe idea is that for the required left steps and up steps, the other robots must be positioned so that when those steps are taken, they don't block. \n\nHmm. Let me think of the following conditions for robot R at (r, c):\n\nTo move left (c-1) times:\n\nEach time we choose left, all robots must be in columns >=2. \n\nSimilarly, for each right steps (if needed?), but since we want to move left, right steps won't help. \n\nWait, the robot is moving left, so it's trying to reduce its column to 1. \n\nThus, the robot must move left exactly (c-1) times. \n\nFor each left move in the sequence, before that move, all robots must be in columns >=2. \n\nAdditionally, after those left moves, the column of R is 1. \n\nSimilarly, for the up moves:\n\nEach up move must be preceded by all robots being in rows >=2. \n\nTotal up moves needed: (r-1). \n\nSo the total steps are (r-1 + c-1). \n\nThe sequence must include these steps in any order. \n\nBut the order of steps must be such that the above conditions are met. \n\nFor example, all up moves must occur when all robots (including R) are in rows >=2. \n\nSimilarly for the left moves. \n\nSo for robot R to be able to do this, the following must be true:\n\n1. The initial row of R is r >=1, so up moves needed (r-1) must be possible. \n\n2. Initially, all other robots are positioned such that they can allow the necessary moves. \n\nWait, but other robots may move during previous steps. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following conditions are sufficient:\n\n- For all other robots, their initial positions must allow the required directions. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the following must hold for robot R:\n\nThe current positions of all other robots must not be in the path that would prevent the required directions. \n\nAlternatively, the other robots must not block the required directions for the steps needed for R. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the only way this works is if all other robots can also move in the directions required for R's path. \n\nWait, for example:\n\nSuppose R is at (3,3), and there's another robot at (2, 1). \n\nTo move R to (1,1):\n\nR needs to move up twice and left twice. \n\nFirst, moving left twice requires that all robots are in columns >=2. \n\nThe other robot is in column 1, so initially, we cannot move left. \n\nTherefore, this path isn't possible. \n\nSo the presence of that other robot makes it impossible. \n\nThus, the presence of certain robots can block the path. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the following is a necessary condition for any robot R to reach (1,1):\n\nAll other robots must be positioned such that they can be moved in a way that allows R to reach there. \n\nThis is still vague. \n\nAlternative Idea: \n\nSuppose there exists a robot R at (r,c). For it to reach (1,1), the following must be true:\n\n- The robot can move left (c-1) times and up (r-1) times. \n\n- For every left move in their path, all robots (including others) must be in columns >=2 before that move. \n\n- For every up move, all robots must be in rows >=2 before that move. \n\nTo do this, the path must be such that:\n\nThe left moves must be done before any robot is in column 1 except R. \n\nWait, not sure. \n\nPerhaps the key idea is that, for the robot to move left (c-1) times, all other robots must also be able to move left those times. \n\nBecause when we choose to move left, all robots must be in column >=2, so after each left move, their columns are reduced by 1. \n\nSimilarly for up moves. \n\nThus, for all other robots, they must have enough space in their initial position to allow the required moves. \n\nFor example, if R is at (3,4), and another robot is at (2,1), then moving left would require that robot to be in column 1 initially, but column 1 is less than 2, so it can't move left. \n\nTherefore, the other robots' initial positions must allow them to move in the required directions enough times. \n\nSo, for R to move left (c-1) times, all other robots must have column >= current column - (number of left moves) + 1? \n\nWait, perhaps for all other robots, their initial column must be >= 1 + (c - 1). \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose a robot S starts at column s_col. \n\nTo perform 'L' moves (left steps) for R requires that all robots, including S, are able to move left 'k' times, where k is the number of left steps taken so far. \n\nWait, every time we do a left move, S's column decreases by 1. \n\nTherefore, for S to not move out, after any number of left moves, S's column must be >= 1. \n\nThus, the maximum number of left moves that can be done before S goes out is (s_col -1). \n\nThus, to move R left (c-1) times, we must have that for all other robots S:\n\ns_col >= 1 + (c-1). \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe number of left moves in the path could be up to (c-1) for R. \n\nBut each left move reduces S's column by 1. \n\nTherefore, after (c-1) left moves, S's column would be s_col - (c-1). \n\nThis must be >=1. \n\nSo s_col - (number of left moves) >=1. \n\nThus, for all other robots S, the initial column s_col must be >= number of left moves. \n\nWait, the number of left moves needed by R is (c-1). \n\nSo for every other robot S, their initial column s_col must be >= (c - 1) + 1? \n\nWait, s_col - (c-1) >=1 \u2192 s_col >= (c-1) +1 \u2192 s_col >= c. \n\nWait, that would mean that any other robot can't be in a column less than c. \n\nBut that can't be true. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose R is at column 4 (c=4). To move left 3 times, that requires that every left move step must be allowed. \n\nEach left move requires all robots are in column >=2 at that time. \n\nAfter the first left move, all robots' columns are reduced by 1. \n\nSo for S's initial column: \n\nAfter first left move: column s_col -1 \n\nAfter second: s_col-2 \n\nAfter third: s_col-3 \n\nThese must all be >=1. \n\nSo the third left move requires s_col-3 >=1 \u2192 s_col >=4. \n\nThe first left move requires s_col >=2. \n\nSo the most restrictive is the third move: s_col >=4. \n\nThus, for other robots to survive those 3 left moves, their initial column must be >=4. \n\nBut then, if another robot is at column 3, then after 3 left moves, it would be at column 0 (3-3=0), which is invalid. \n\nAh, therefore, in order for R to move left (c-1) times, the other robots must be initially in columns >= c. \n\nBecause after (c-1) steps, their columns would be s_col - (c-1) \u22651 \u2192 s_col \u2265 c. \n\nThus, the other robots must be in columns >= c. \n\nWait, that's a very strict condition. \n\nSimilarly for the up moves. \n\nFor each up move required by R (r-1 times), the other robots' initial rows must be >= r. \n\nBecause after (r-1) up moves, their rows would be s_row - (r-1) \u22651 \u2192 s_row \u2265 r. \n\nAh! \n\nThis is an important observation. \n\nSo for robot R located at (r, c) to be able to move to (1,1) via r-1 up moves and c-1 left moves (in any order), the following must be true for all other robots:\n\nFor all other robots S located at (s_row, s_col):\n\n   s_row \u2265 r, and s_col \u2265 c \n\n   Because:\n\n   \u2014 To move up (r-1) times, each up move requires the robot's current row is at least 2, so after (r-1) up moves, their row must be at least 1. \n\n   So, s_row - (r-1) \u2265 1 \u2192 s_row \u2265 r. \n\n   Similarly for columns: \n\n   s_col - (c-1) \u2265 1 \u2192 s_col \u2265 c. \n\nSo, all other robots must be in rows \u2265 r and columns \u2265 c. \n\nBecause if any other robot is not in those positions, then after performing the necessary up and left moves, that robot would leave the grid. \n\n Thus, the necessary conditions are:\n\n1. The robot R is at (r, c). \n\n2. All other robots are in rows \u2265 r and columns \u2265 c. \n\n3. The total up and left moves (r-1 and c-1) must be done in a way that all other robots can move in those directions. \n\nWait, but the order of steps might allow some flexibility. \n\nWait, the above conditions assume that all the required moves are done consecutively. \n\nBut perhaps there's a different order of steps that allows other robots to move to positions that allow the required moves. \n\nHmm. \n\nFor example, suppose we first move up some times and then move left, or vice versa. \n\nBut in any case, the total number of up moves must be (r-1), and left moves must be (c-1). \n\nThe other robots' initial positions must allow them to survive after those moves. \n\n Thus, the condition that all other robots are in rows \u2265 r and columns \u2265 c is necessary. \n\n Because, for example, if a robot is in row r-1, then after (r-1) up moves, it would end up in row (r-1) - (r-1) = 0 \u2192 which is invalid. \n\n Thus, this is a necessary condition. \n\n Is it sufficient? \n\n Suppose all other robots are in rows \u2265r and columns \u2265c. \n\n Then, when performing the required up and left moves, the other robots can do those moves. \n\n Thus, the steps can be done in any order. \n\n Therefore, the total number of up and left steps needed can be done in any order, and all other robots will still be within the grid. \n\n Thus, the condition is both necessary and sufficient. \n\n Thus, the solution is to check for any robot R:\n\n If there exists a robot R such that:\n\n   \u2014 R's current row is r and column is c. \n\n   \u2014 All other robots are in rows \u2265 r and columns \u2265 c. \n\n   \u2014 Then, the answer is YES. \n\n Also, if any robot is already at (1,1), then answer is YES. \n\n Thus, the steps for the solution are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Check if any robot is already at (1,1). If yes, output YES. \n\n2. Else, for each robot R:\n\n   a. Let r = row of R, c = column of R. \n\n   b. Check whether all other robots are in rows \u2265 r and columns \u2265 c. \n\n   c. If for any such R, this is true, then output YES. \n\n3. If none of the above, output NO. \n\nThis seems like a promising approach. \n\nTesting this against the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: \n\nFirst test case (from note):\n\nSuppose input has a robot at (1,2). \n\nOther robots? The problem states there's at least one robot. \n\nSuppose only that robot. \n\nThen for R's row is 1, column 2. \n\nOther robots (none) trivially satisfy the condition. \n\nThus, YES. \n\nSample 2:\n\nTwo robots at (1,2) and (2,1). \n\nFor the first robot (1,2):\n\nOther robot is at (2,1). \n\nThe other robot's row (2) is \u2265 1 (yes), but its column (1) must be >= 2? No. So not valid. \n\nFor the second robot (2,1):\n\nOther robot's column is 2, which must be >=1's column (1). Yes. But other robot's row is 1 which must be >=2? No. \n\nThus, no robots meet the condition \u2192 output NO. \n\nSample 3: \n\nThird test case (from note): \n\nA robot at (1,3). \n\nOther robots may be in columns \u22653 and rows \u22651. \n\nIf there are other robots not in columns \u22653, then it won't work. \n\nAssuming they are in valid places. \n\nThus, moving left twice would work. \n\nSample 4: \n\nAlready has a robot in (1,1) \u2192 YES. \n\nSample 5:\n\nThe example where a sequence of up, left, up is needed. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nSuppose the robot starts at (3,2). \n\nTo reach (1,1), need up twice and left once. \n\nOther robots must be in rows >=3 and columns >=2. \n\nAssume they are. \n\nThen the steps can be done. \n\nThus, the condition holds. \n\nThus, the approach seems correct. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to checking whether any robot R has all other robots in rows >= R's row AND columns >= R's column. \n\nAdditionally, check if any robot is already at (1,1). \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read the grid. \n\n- Check if any cell (1,1) is 'R'. If yes, output YES. \n\n- Else, for each robot in the grid:\n\n   For each cell (i,j) that is a 'R':\n\n      Check for this (i,j): \n\n      all other 'R's are in rows >=i and columns >=j. \n\n      If any such exists \u2192 output YES. \n\n- If none: output NO. \n\nThus, the code needs to implement this. \n\nNow, the original code's partial code: \n\nThe code has loops over i and j from 1 to b and c. \n\nInside the loop, it has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". \n\nThe code's variables include a 2D array 'a'? \n\nWait looking back at the provided code:\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nchar a[6][6];\n\nIn main: \n\nfor each test case, read n, m (stored in b and c). \n\nThen loops over i from 1 to b, and j from 1 to c. \n\nThe code needs to read the grid and check conditions. \n\nThe given code's a is not initialized. \n\nThe original code's structure is incomplete. \n\nWe need to fill in the code to read the grid properly. \n\nWait, the code currently has a loop that for each test case, loops over rows and columns. \n\nThe code has:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++) \n\n   for(int j=1; j<=c; j++) {\n\n      /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   }\n\nThe first step is to read the grid for each test case. \n\nSo the missing code inside the loop must read the characters into the grid. \n\nProbably the code should read each character for the grid. \n\nThe code has a variable 's' declared as char s; but it's not used. \n\nPerhaps the code should read each line of the grid. \n\nWait, the input has n lines, each of m characters. \n\nThus, for each row i, we need to read a string of length m. \n\nIn C++, this can be done with a loop over the rows. \n\nThe current code loops over i and j, but in a nested loop. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to read each row as a string, then process each character. \n\nAlternatively, the current nested loops are for i from 1 to b, j from 1 to c. \n\nInside the inner loop, the code needs to read the character at (i,j). \n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps the code should read the string for each row first, then assign each character to a[i][j]. \n\nThe current code uses a 2D array 'a', but in the code's current state, the 'a' is not initialized. \n\nThus, the steps needed are:\n\nInside the test case loop:\n\nAfter reading b and c (as variables b and c?), then:\n\nfor each row in 1..b:\n\n   read a string of length c, \n\n   and for each character in the string, assign to a[i][j]. \n\nThus, perhaps the code should be modified as follows: \n\nInside the loop over rows and columns, but the current code's loops are written as a single for loop with i and j. \n\nAlternatively, the code may need to first read each row, then process each character. \n\nThe code as given has loops for i and j, which probably isn't the right way. \n\nWait, in the current code's structure:\n\nThe code loops over i from 1 to b and j from 1 to c. \n\nThis is a single loop over all rows and columns. \n\nThus, to read each character, perhaps the code should read a single character each time. \n\nBut the problem's input gives n lines each of m characters. So perhaps the code should read each line's characters one by one. \n\nThe code has a 'char s;' but not used. \n\nPerhaps the code should instead read a string of length m for each row, then assign each character to a[i][j]. \n\nThus, inside the first loop over i from 1 to b:\n\n   read a string of length c. \n\n   then loop over j from 1 to c and assign a[i][j] = the character from the string. \n\nBut the current code's loops are nested, which may not be optimal. \n\nAlternatively, the current loops are incorrect. \n\nThe problem likely requires that the code reads the grid correctly. \n\nThe missing code in the TODO section probably should read the characters from the input. \n\nPerhaps, for each row i in 1..b:\n\n   read a string (of length m). \n\n   then for each j in 1..m: \n\n      a[i][j] = the j-th character of the string. \n\nThus, the code should have something like:\n\nfor (int i =1; i <=b; i++) {\n\n   string s; \n\n   cin >> s; \n\n   for (int j =1; j <=c; j++) {\n\n      a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut in the initial code's structure, the loops are nested for i and j. \n\nPerhaps, the current code's loops are written incorrectly. \n\nThe original code has:\n\nfor(int i=1;i<=b;i++)\n\nfor(int j=1;j<=c;j++){\n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nPerhaps the current code is trying to read each cell individually. \n\nThus, inside the loops, for each cell (i,j), the code should read a character. \n\nThus, the missing code would be something like: \n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut since a is a char array, it may need to be read correctly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read each character using getchar(), but that's tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the code may have an error in the loops. \n\nBut the problem requires filling in the missing code in the TODO section. \n\nThe current code has a 2D array 'a', which is probably intended to store the grid. \n\nSo the missing code inside the loops is to read each character of the grid into a[i][j]. \n\nAssuming the rows are read one by one, and for each row, the characters are read in the inner loop. \n\nThus, the code inside the loops would be something like:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nHowever, since each row is a string of m characters, this might not work. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be using a character array and reading from cin as a stream. \n\nAnother approach is to read the entire row as a string, then assign each character. \n\nBut the current code's loops are nested, so the code could do:\n\nstring s; \n\ncin >> s; \n\nThen, for the current row i, loop over each character. \n\nBut the current loops are nested, so perhaps the code needs to read each character one by one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should read the initial 'cin >> b >> c', then read each row's characters. \n\nThe provided code has:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++)\n\n   for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n      /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n   }\n\nSo the code is looping over each row and column, and inside the inner loop, it needs to read the character at (i,j). \n\nThus, the code can read each character with cin >> a[i][j]; \n\nAssuming the 'a' array is correctly declared. \n\nThus, the missing code would be:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut since in C++, when reading characters from cin, it might skip whitespace, so this may not work if the input is given as a grid without spaces. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use getchar() to read each character. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a string buffer. \n\nAn example of code to read the grid:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i <= b; i++) {\n\n    for (int j = 1; j <= c; j++) {\n\n        cin >> a[i][j];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut this would require that each character is separated by spaces, which it's not. \n\nThe input lines for the grid are strings of characters with no spaces. \n\nHence, the correct way is: \n\nFor each row in 1..b:\n\n   read a string of length m, then assign each character to a[i][j]. \n\nThus, in the code:\n\nInside the outer loop over i (the rows), read a string, then process each character in the string. \n\nThus, the code would have:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; ++i) {\n\n    string s;\n\n    cin >> s;\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; ++j) {\n\n        a[i][j] = s[j-1]; // since strings are 0-based, while the code uses 1-based indices.\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the original loops are nested, which may not be the case. \n\nThe current nested loops are written as two loops, for i and then j inside, but the code cannot read the string inside the inner loop. \n\nSo the correct way is to replace the loop structure. \n\nHowever, since the problem requires to fill the missing code in the existing code's TODO section, perhaps the code should read each character separately. \n\nAnother option is to read the entire string first using an additional loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code may have an error in the loop structure, but given that the problem requires to fill the TODO section inside the existing loops, perhaps the code is supposed to read each character by using get(). \n\nAlternatively, the following code inside the inner loop (j loop) would be:\n\ncin >> a[i][j];\n\nBut this requires that the input has each character separated by whitespace, which it doesn't. \n\nThus, this would not work for the input. \n\nThe correct way is to read the entire row at once as a string, then assign each character. \n\nThus, the code needs to read each row into a string first. \n\nBut in the current structure, the loops are nested, so perhaps the code should first read the string outside the j loop. \n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++){\n\n    string s;\n\n    cin >> s;\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the code provided, the j loop is inside the i loop. \n\nSo the given code has the outer for loops as:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++)\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\nThus, for each i and j, the code is inside the inner loop. \n\nThus, perhaps the code should read the entire string first, then assign. \n\nBut how to do that in this loop structure? \n\nPerhaps the code can read the string outside the j loop, like this:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++) {\n\n    string s;\n\n    cin >> s;\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut this code is not inside the given nested loops. \n\nAlternatively, the code may have to read each character individually, but in the nested loops. \n\nAlternatively, the code may use a separate variable to read the string. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use get() to read each character. \n\nBut in C++, using getchar() would skip leading whitespace. \n\nAlternatively, the code can read the next character from cin, even if it's a newline. \n\nPerhaps:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++){\n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        cin >> a[i][j];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis would work if the input has each row's characters separated by spaces, but the input has them as a string of characters. \n\nFor example, if the input row is \"RER\", then the code above would read R, E, R as separate inputs, which requires that the input is given as R E R, which it is not. \n\nSo this approach won't work. \n\nTherefore, the correct way is to read each row as a single string, then assign each character. \n\nHence, the code should first read the string for the row, then loop through the characters. \n\nThus, the code inside the TODO section should read the string for the row, but this requires to modify the loops. \n\nHowever, given the structure of the provided code, which uses two nested loops, perhaps the correct way is to read each character individually using cin.get() or similar. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read the grid correctly by using the loops in the following way: \n\nIn the inner loop (j loop), read a character into a[i][j]. \n\nBut the problem is that the input is given with lines of strings, not separated by spaces. \n\nThus, using cin >> a[i][j] would read until a space is found, which may not be what we want. \n\nThus, perhaps the code should use: \n\ncin >> s; \n\nBut that would read a single character? \n\nAlternatively, the code may have to read the entire input row by row, and then character by character. \n\nPerhaps the code should use:\n\ncin.get(a[i][j]); \n\nBut then need to deal with the newlines. \n\nAlternatively, the following code may work: \n\nfor(int i= 1; i <=b; i++){\n\n    for(int j=1; j <=c; j++){\n\n        cin >> a[i][j];\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut this would require that each character is separated by whitespace. \n\nBut in the problem's input, this is not the case. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to read each character one by one, skipping any whitespace, including newlines. \n\nIn C++, the code can be written as follows: \n\nfor(int i=1; i <=b; i++) {\n\n    for(int j=1; j <=c; j++){\n\n        char ch;\n\n        cin >> ch;\n\n        a[i][j] = ch;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut this assumes that the input is given with each character in the row separated by spaces, but in the problem statement's input, the rows are given as strings without spaces between characters. \n\nSo this would not work. \n\nAlternatively, the code can read the entire line using getline(), then process each character. \n\nThus, inside the loops:\n\nfor(int i=1; i<=b; i++){\n\n    string s;\n\n    getline(cin, s); \n\n    for(int j=1; j<=c; j++){\n\n        a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the first test case's input may have leading or trailing whitespaces. \n\nAlternatively, the first line after t has b and c, then n lines of strings. \n\nThus, after reading b and c, we can read the next lines as strings. \n\nThe code's current loops are for reading the grid. \n\nThe code given has the loops over i and j, and the TODO section is there. Thus, the code must be filled with the way to read the characters. \n\nPerhaps the code should be:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut since the input is in a row as a string, this would not work. \n\nAlternatively, the code may be using the variable 's' which is declared but unused. \n\nThe code declares a 'char s;' but not used. \n\nPerhaps the code has an error in the variable name. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use a string array. \n\nThis is getting very complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct way is to read each row as a string inside the first loop (i), then process each character. \n\nThus, the code inside the outer loop (for each row) would be: \n\nstring s; \n\ncin >> s; \n\nthen for each j, a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\nThus, the code's loops are nested, so this can be done by:\n\nInside the outer loop over i:\n\nfor (int j=1; j<=c; j++) \n\nBut in the current code, the for j loop is already inside. \n\nThus, the code inside the TODO section should read the input into a[i][j]. \n\nThus, the code's missing part is:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut this may not work due to input formatting. \n\nAlternatively, the code can read the entire string into 's', then assign each character in the loop. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nInside the loop over i, first read the string s. \n\nBut in the current structure, the code has a nested loop over j. \n\nThus, perhaps the code should use a separate variable. \n\nAlternatively, the code may have to read the string first and then fill the a array. \n\nBut given the structure of the code provided, which has the nested loops over i and j, the correct missing code is to read the character into a[i][j] using cin.get(). \n\nAnother possibility is that the initial code has a mistake in the loop. Perhaps the code should first read the entire string for the row, then loop over j. \n\nThus, the code inside the i loop would be: \n\nstring s; \n\ncin >> s; \n\nthen loop over j from 1 to c and assign a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\nThus, the code's loops are as follows:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n   read b, c. \n\n   for(int i=1; ... ):\n\n      string s; \n\n      cin >> s; \n\n      for(int j=1; ... ):\n\n          a[i][j] = s[j-1]; \n\nThus, this would require modifying the loops, but the provided code has the loops and the TODO inside the j loop. \n\nHence, the correct code to put in the TODO is:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut this would read each character in sequence, assuming that there is no whitespace between them. \n\nHowever, in C++, when reading with >>, it skips whitespace. So if the input is given as strings with no spaces, then the first >> reads the first character, then the next >> reads the second, etc. \n\nFor example, if the input is \"RE\\n\" then the first cin >> a[i][j] would read 'R', the next 'E', and so on. \n\nAssuming that the input is given correctly without any extra spaces between the characters, this may work. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is: \n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nThus, the code inside the inner for loop (the j loop) is cin >> a[i][j]; \n\nAdditionally, after filling the grid, the code has the line:\n\nif (a[x][y] == 'R') cout << \"YES\\n\"; \n\nWait, where are x and y defined? \n\nLooking back at the provided code:\n\nThe code has the variables x and y initialized to b and c. \n\nWait, the code has:\n\nint x = b, y = c; \n\nThus, x is the number of rows (b), and y the number of columns (c). \n\nThus, the condition checks if a[x][y] is 'R', which is a[b][c], the bottom-right cell. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe condition is checking whether the bottom-right cell contains a robot. \n\nWhich is not related to the upper-left cell. \n\nThis indicates that the provided code has a bug and the TODO section is not the only problem. \n\nThe problem requires checking if any robot is already in the upper-left corner (1,1). \n\nThus, the code's current condition is wrong. \n\nThe code's final line is:\n\nif(a[x][y] == 'R') cout << \"YES\\n\"; \n\nWhere x and y are set to b and c. \n\nThis is incorrect. \n\nThe correct condition should be checking a[1][1]. \n\nThus, this is another error in the provided code. \n\nHence, the problem requires not only filling the missing code in the TODO section, but also fixing the condition. \n\nHowever, the problem states the following in the instructions: \n\n\"You will be given code with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in. Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. \" \n\nThe user provided code may have other errors, but the task is to fill in the missing parts. \n\nThe current code has the final line as a check on a[x][y], where x and y are b and c. \n\nThis is wrong. \n\nBut the user's code may have other errors. \n\nHowever, according to the problem's instructions, we must only fill in the missing code in the TODO section. \n\nThe TODO is inside the loop over the grid, so the only missing code is to read the characters into the array. \n\nThus, the correct code for the TODO section is:\n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nAssuming this will read the characters correctly. \n\nHowever, given the input format, this may not be correct. \n\nBut given the constraints of the problem, this is what we have to do. \n\nSo, the missing code is simply 'cin >> a[i][j];' \n\nBut in the initial code's variables, the array 'a' is declared as a 6x6 array, which is correct since n and m are up to 5. \n\nThus, the correct code for the missing part is:\n\ncin >> a[i][j];\n\nNow, after filling that, the code will read the grid properly. \n\nThen, the rest of the code has an incorrect condition. \n\nThe code currently checks if a[x][y] is 'R', which is a[b][c]. \n\nThus, the code will output YES only if the bottom-right cell is a robot, which is incorrect. \n\nThis indicates that there are other errors in the provided code, but according to the problem statement, we are supposed to only fill in the missing code. \n\nThe original code after the loops has:\n\nif(a[x][y] == 'R') cout << \"YES\\n\"; \n\nElse \"NO\". \n\nThis is incorrect, since the condition should check a[1][1]. \n\nThus, the code is wrong, but we are to only fill in the missing parts. \n\nGiven that, the user's code has other bugs, but the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThus, the missing code in the loop is 'cin >> a[i][j];' \n\nThus, the answer to the question is to write that line in the TODO section. \n\nBut wait, perhaps the code has another error in the loops' indexes. \n\nThe code loops i from 1 to b and j from 1 to c. \n\nThus, the array a[i][j] is being filled correctly for 1-based indices. \n\nThus, the missing code is simply cin >> a[i][j]; \n\nSo that's the only part to fill. \n\nThe final code will have a bug in the condition, but since the problem asks to fill only the missing parts, this is what is required. \n\nThus, the correct missing code is the line: \n\ncin >> a[i][j]; \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code may have to read the character into the array properly, perhaps using getchar() to read each character. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should use:\n\na[i][j] = getchar(); \n\nBut this may read the newline characters. \n\nAlternatively, the code should read a line into a string, then process each character. \n\nBut since the code's TODO is inside the nested loops, the only way is to use cin >> a[i][j]; \n\nThus, the code should have that line. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the missing code in the TODO section is: \n\ncin >> a[i][j];"
