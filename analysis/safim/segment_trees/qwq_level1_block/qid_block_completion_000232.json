    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to complete this C++ code to solve the problem. The problem is about finding the minimum unhappiness value when inviting club members such that the number of cakes (which is the number of friend pairs both invited) is even. \n\nHmm, the code provided seems to have some logic, but there are missing parts. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem states that each member not invited adds their a_i to the unhappiness. The cakes are the number of friend pairs where both are invited. The total cakes must be even. We need to minimize the total unhappiness under this constraint.\n\nThe approach here probably involves some form of dynamic programming or greedy selection. But looking at the existing code, maybe it's trying to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity of the number of cakes.\n\nWait, the code's structure is a bit confusing. Let me look at the code step by step.\n\nThe code starts by reading t test cases. For each test case, it reads n and m, then the a array. Then it reads m friend pairs into a1 and a2 arrays. It also has an array b which counts the number of friends each member has. Wait, no, actually, the code is incrementing b for each occurrence of a member in a friend pair. Wait, for each friend pair (x,y), it increments b[x-1] and b[y-1]. So b[i] is the degree of member (i+1), the number of friends each has. \n\nThen, if m is even, it outputs 0. Wait, that can't be right. Because m is the total number of friend pairs, but the actual number of cakes depends on how many of those pairs are both invited. The code's logic here is probably wrong. Because even if m is even, the number of cakes could be even or odd depending on which pairs are selected. So that part must be incorrect. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code's logic here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code's first condition is: if m is even, then output 0. But that's not correct. For example, in the first sample input given in the problem's note, the first test case probably has m even, and the answer is 0. But maybe the code is assuming that when m is even, the minimal is achievable by inviting everyone, but that's not necessarily the case. Hmm, perhaps the code is trying to handle some cases but is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to handle the case where the number of cakes must be even, so when m is even, perhaps the minimal is possible by some arrangement. But I'm not sure. Let me think of the problem again.\n\nThe key is that the number of cakes (the number of friend pairs both invited) must be even. To minimize the unhappiness, we need to choose a subset of members such that this count is even, and the sum of a_i for those not invited is minimized.\n\nHmm, the problem is similar to a graph where edges are the friend pairs, and we need to select a subset of vertices such that the number of edges within the subset is even, and the sum of a_i for non-selected is minimized.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled with a graph and some parity constraints. Maybe the minimal solution can be found by considering the parity of the number of edges in the selected subset. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a minimum vertex cover or something else, but I'm not sure. Let me think of possible approaches.\n\nAnother idea: the minimal unhappiness is equivalent to maximizing the sum of (a_i) for the invited members, since the total unhappiness is the sum of a_i for non-invited. So maximizing the sum of invited a_i's (since a_i is the unhappiness if not invited, so invited members contribute nothing to unhappiness except their a_i if not invited. Wait, no: the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all members not invited. So to minimize that, we need to invite as many as possible with low a_i, but also ensuring that the number of edges (friend pairs both invited) is even.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node has a cost (the a_i if not invited, so the cost of not inviting is a_i, and the cost of inviting is 0). The total cost is the sum of a_i for non-invited. The constraint is that the number of edges in the induced subgraph (the edges where both endpoints are invited) must be even.\n\nThis seems tricky. How can we model this?\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to model this as a graph and find the minimal cost with the parity constraint. Since the parity is even, perhaps we can model this with a parity-based dynamic programming or use some kind of flow with parity constraints. But given the constraints (n up to 1e5), that might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into considering the parity of the number of edges in the selected subset. Let me think of the problem as follows: the total number of edges in the selected subset must be even. To achieve this, perhaps we can find the minimal cost when the parity is even, and compare it with when it's odd, but since we need even, we have to choose the minimal between those two possibilities? Wait, no, because the problem requires exactly even. So we need to find the minimal cost where the number of edges is even.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal cost is either the minimal possible when the number of edges is even, or we have to adjust it by some minimal cost to flip the parity.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: the minimal cost can be found by considering the minimal difference between the total minimal cost (without parity constraint) and the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nWait, let me think of the problem as follows. Let the minimal total unhappiness without considering the parity constraint be S. Then, if the number of edges in that selection is even, then S is the answer. If it's odd, then we need to find the minimal way to flip the parity, which would involve either adding or removing some edges. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each edge contributes to the parity. To flip the parity, you can either add or remove an edge. But since edges are determined by the selected nodes, it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as a graph where each connected component contributes to the parity. For example, in a tree structure, the parity might depend on the selection of nodes in cycles. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach inspired by the code given. Let me look at the code again.\n\nThe code first reads the a array, then for each friend pair, it increments the degree of each member in the pair. Then, if m is even, it outputs 0. Wait, that can't be right. For example, in the second test case from the problem's note, m is 2 (since there are two friend pairs?), but the answer is 2. Wait, maybe I need to check the sample input again.\n\nWait the problem's note says in the second test case, the possible options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (so even). The unhappiness is 2 (since a_2 and a_3 are not invited? Wait no, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. Wait, in the second test case, the members are 1,2,3. The a array is given as [4,5,3]. So if you invite 2 and 3, then the unhappiness is a_1 (since 1 is not invited) which is 4? But the note says the minimum is 2. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem's note. Let me check again.\n\nWait the note says in the second test case, the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The unhappiness would be a_1 (since 1 is not invited) which is 4? But the note says the minimum is 2. Wait that's conflicting. Wait maybe the a array is different. Let me recheck the note's example.\n\nThe note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (so even). The unhappiness value is 2. So the a array must be such that the unhappiness is 2 when 1 is not invited. So perhaps the a array for that case is [4,5,3], so when you invite 2 and 3, the unhappiness is a_1 (4) plus a_3? Wait no, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all members not invited. So if you invite 2 and 3, then member 1 is not invited, so the unhappiness is a_1 =4. But the note says the minimum is 2. So maybe the a array in that case is different. Maybe the a array is [3,5, something]. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me not dwell on that now.\n\nBack to the code. The code's logic seems to be:\n\nIf m is even, output 0. But that's probably wrong. Because in the first test case, maybe m is even, but the answer is 0 (since all are invited, which gives some number of cakes, but that number must be even). But the code's logic would output 0, which matches. But in other cases, like when m is even but the minimal requires some other selection, perhaps it's okay. But the code's approach is probably incorrect.\n\nWait, the code's else block is when m is odd. Then it tries to find the minimal value between some options. Let me see:\n\nIn the else block (when m is odd), the code initializes min to 999999, then loops through all members i where b[i] is odd (since b[i] is the degree?), and if a[i] is less than current min, then... but the code has a comment \"TODO: Your code here\". So the first loop is incomplete.\n\nThen, there's another loop over all friend pairs, checking if both members have even degrees (b[i]%2==0?), and then taking the sum of their a's if that's smaller than current min.\n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to flip the parity of the number of cakes. Because when the number of cakes is odd, we need to make it even. To do that, we can either:\n\n1. Remove one member who is part of an odd number of edges (so that flipping their invitation status changes the parity), but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the minimal cost to adjust the parity by either flipping a single node (if that changes the parity) or flipping an edge (i.e., not inviting both in a pair, but that's more complex).\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to consider two possibilities when the required parity is even but the current selection (maybe the minimal without parity) has an odd number of cakes. To fix this, you can either:\n\n- Find a single node whose exclusion/inclusion would flip the parity. The cost would be a_i (since excluding that node would remove all edges involving it, thus changing the count by an odd number? Not sure).\n\nOr, find a pair of nodes whose exclusion would flip the parity, but that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal cost between two options:\n\nEither find a node with an odd degree (so that toggling its invitation would change the parity by an odd number, thus making it even), and the cost would be a_i (since if you exclude that node, you lose the edges connected to it, but the exact effect on the total cakes is unclear).\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the minimal between the minimal a_i of nodes with odd degrees, or the minimal sum of a_i and a_j for an edge (x,y) where both have even degrees. Because flipping both would change the parity by 1 (since adding or removing that edge would change the count by 1).\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the minimal cost to adjust the parity from odd to even. The minimal between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degrees) and the minimal a_x + a_y (for edges where both nodes have even degrees). \n\nWait, the code's first loop is over all i where b[i] is odd (since b[i] is the degree?), and if a[i] is less than min, then set min to a[i]. But the code's current code has a comment there, so the line is missing. So the code is supposed to set min to the minimum between current min and a[i], but the code's first loop is incomplete. The current code has:\n\nif (b[i]%2 ==1 && a[i] < min) { /* TODO */ }\n\nSo the missing code here is probably min = a[i]; \n\nThen, the second loop is over all edges, and for each edge (a1[i], a2[i]), it checks if both nodes have even degrees (b[a1[i]-1]%2 ==0 and same for a2). Then, if the sum of their a's is less than current min, then min is updated to that sum.\n\nSo the code is trying to find the minimal between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degrees) and the minimal a_x + a_y (for edges where both nodes have even degrees). The minimal of these two would be the minimal cost to flip the parity from odd to even. \n\nWait, but why?\n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that when the total number of cakes is odd, we need to make it even. To do this, we can either:\n\n- Exclude a single node which is part of an odd number of edges (so that the number of edges removed is odd, flipping the parity). The cost would be a_i (since excluding that node adds a_i to the unhappiness).\n\nOR\n\n- Exclude both nodes in an edge (so that the number of edges removed is 1 (the edge itself), flipping the parity). The cost would be a_x + a_y (since both are excluded, their a's are added).\n\nWait, but excluding both nodes would remove all edges connected to either, not just the edge between them. So that might not be the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is considering that flipping the inclusion of a single node (if it has an odd degree) would change the parity. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is based on the parity of the degrees. Let me think of the problem in terms of graph theory.\n\nSuppose that the current selection of nodes (the minimal without considering parity) has an odd number of edges. To make it even, we need to change the parity. To do this, we can either:\n\n- Add or remove an edge. But edges are determined by the selected nodes. So changing the selection of nodes can affect the count.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal adjustment is to find a way to flip the parity with minimal cost. The two options considered in the code are:\n\n1. Remove a node with an odd degree (so that the number of edges removed is odd, thus flipping the parity). The cost is a_i (since the node is now not invited, so its a_i is added to the unhappiness).\n\n2. Remove an edge by not inviting both nodes in an edge (so the edge is no longer counted, thus subtracting 1 from the total, flipping parity). The cost is a_x + a_y (since both are excluded).\n\nWait, but removing both nodes would remove all edges connected to either, so the total change in edges is more than 1. So that's not the right way.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is flawed, but given that the problem requires us to complete the code, perhaps the correct approach is to implement what the code is trying to do, even if it's not the optimal solution.\n\nThe code's current structure is:\n\nWhen m is even, output 0. But that's probably wrong. Wait, maybe the code's first condition is wrong. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the code's first condition is if (m%2 ==0) then output 0. But m is the number of friend pairs, not the number of cakes. The number of cakes is the number of friend pairs where both are invited. So m being even has no direct relation to the parity of the cakes. So that condition is incorrect. So the code is wrong here, but perhaps the problem requires us to fix the missing parts, not the entire logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to handle the case where the minimal possible is when all are invited, but that's only possible if the number of edges (friend pairs) is even. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect, but given that the problem requires completing the code, I need to focus on the missing parts.\n\nLooking back at the code's first loop in the else block (when m is odd?), the code is looping over all i where b[i] is odd (since b[i] is the degree of the node). For each such i, if a[i] is less than current min, then set min to a[i]. But the code has a comment there, so the line is missing. The correct line would be min = a[i]; \n\nThen, the second loop is over all edges, and for each edge (x,y), it checks if both nodes have even degrees (b[x-1]%2 ==0 and same for y). Then, the sum of a[x-1] and a[y-1] is considered. The minimal between that and the current min is stored.\n\nSo the code is trying to find the minimal between the minimal a_i (for nodes with odd degrees) and the minimal a_x + a_y (for edges where both nodes have even degrees). The minimal of these two is the minimal cost to adjust the parity from odd to even. \n\nThe idea is that, to flip the parity, you can either:\n\n- Exclude a node with an odd degree. The number of edges removed would be equal to its degree (since all edges connected to it would no longer be counted if the node is excluded). Since the degree is odd, this would change the parity. The cost is a_i (since the node is now not invited).\n\nOR\n\n- Exclude both nodes in an edge where both have even degrees. The number of edges removed would include the edge between them (so subtract 1, flipping parity). But also, other edges connected to those nodes would be removed. However, since their degrees are even, the total change in edges would be (degree_x + degree_y - 1) (since the edge between them is counted once in each degree). But this might not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the code is considering that by excluding both nodes, the edge between them is removed (so subtract 1), and since their degrees are even, the other edges connected to them would be even, so the total change is odd (since 1 is subtracted). \n\nAlternatively, the code's logic is that when both nodes have even degrees, removing them would subtract an odd number of edges (since the edge between them is one, and the rest are even). Wait, the total edges removed would be (degree_x + degree_y - 1) (since the edge between them is counted in both degrees). So if both degrees are even, then (even + even -1) = odd. So the total edges removed is odd, so the parity flips. \n\nThus, the cost for this option is a_x + a_y (since both are excluded). \n\nTherefore, the minimal between the two options (the minimal a_i for nodes with odd degrees, and the minimal a_x + a_y for edges with both nodes even degrees) is the minimal cost to flip the parity. \n\nHence, the code is trying to compute this minimal value and then output it. \n\nBut the code's first condition (if m is even, output 0) is wrong. Because the number of cakes (edges in the selected subset) can be even or odd even if m is even. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's first condition is a mistake, but the problem requires us to complete the code as given, not to fix the logic. So maybe the code's first condition is part of the initial incorrect approach, but the problem requires us to fill in the missing parts. \n\nIn the code's current structure, the first loop in the else block (when m is odd) is incomplete. The missing line is setting min to a[i] when a[i] is smaller. So the code should have:\n\nif (b[i]%2 ==1 && a[i] < min) {\n    min = a[i];\n}\n\nSo that's the first missing line.\n\nThe second part is correct as per the code's logic. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nIn the first loop (for the nodes with odd degrees), set min to a[i] when applicable.\n\nSo the code should be filled with:\n\nmin = a[i];\n\nSo the complete code would have that line in the first loop.\n\nWait, but the code's initial min is set to 999999. So the first loop is trying to find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degrees. The second loop is trying to find the minimal a_x + a_y among edges where both nodes have even degrees. The minimal between these two is the minimal cost to flip the parity from odd to even. \n\nHence, the code's logic is that when the current selection (the minimal without considering parity) has an odd number of cakes, then we need to pay the minimal cost between those two options. \n\nBut how does the code know that the current selection has an odd number of cakes? Because the code is in the else block (when m is odd?), but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's logic is incorrect, but given the problem's instruction to complete the code, I have to proceed with the missing lines as per the code's structure.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is in the first loop's if block. The line is min = a[i]; \n\nSo the code after the TODO should be:\n\nmin = a[i];\n\nHence, the answer is to output that line."
