Hmm. Let's think of the first sample test case. Sample 1: Suppose the grid has a robot in (0,1). Then, moving left once would work. The code's approach: the first row (row 0) has an R at column 1. The 'col' would be set to 1 here. For other rows (if any), their R's first index must not be less than 1. Since there are no other rows (assuming n=1?), then res remains true, so output is YES. Another sample: in the second test case where any move causes explosion. Like if a robot is in (0,0), but other robots are in positions where moving in any direction causes some to go out. Wait, but the problem states that in each test case there is at least one robot. Wait, the second test case's explanation says that trying any command causes at least one to explode. Let's say for example, the robots are in (0,0) and (0, m-1). Wait, but moving left would make the robot in (0, m-1) move, but if m is 1, then maybe that's not.",

Wait, but also, the robot must be able to get to row 0. But if the robot is in a lower row, then they need to move up. However, moving up would require that all the robots in their current rows can move up. This is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of the code's existing structure again.

The code provided must find this condition. Now, returning to the code's structure. The code's current variables:\n\n- col is initially null. For the first row with R's, it's set to the first R's column. Then, for each subsequent row with R's, their first R's column must not be less than col. \n\nElse, res is false.

But for rows before the first R (like row0, row1), since they had no R, their idx is -1, so the else clause (which requires idx ! =-1) is not triggered. Thus, the code's logic is correct. Therefore, the missing code is simply: \n\nInside the if (col == null) block: \n\nif (idx != -1) { \n\n   col = idx; } \n\nWait, no, because the code is already in the for loop over the rows, and in this iteration, the row contains an R (since idx is the first occurrence of R in the row). The code is inside the loop, so row has at least one R. \n\nWait, the row could have 'E's except for the R's. Wait, the code's code is: \n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    String row = sc.next();\n\n    int idx = row.indexOf('R');\n\n    if (col == null) {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n        if (idx ! = -1 && idx < col)\n\n            res = false;\n\n    }\n\n} Wait, when the row has at least one R, even if idx is found (say, row has R somewhere), then in the first row with R, the first block (col is null) is executed. The code in the first block needs to set col to idx. Thus, the code should be:\n\ncol = idx;\n\nBut wait, what if the row has R's but the first occurrence is at a column? Yes, that's exactly what the code needs. Thus, the missing code is:\n\ncol = idx;\n\nThat's the only line needed. So putting it all together, the missing code in the TODO block is:\n\ncol = idx;\n\nSo that's the code to fill in. Testing this:\n\nIn the first test case example where the robot is in (0,1). The first row has idx =1. col is set to 1. Other rows (if any, but assuming n=1, so no else clause). Thus res remains true \u2192 YES. Another example where first row has R at column 1, but another row has R at column 0. Then, in the first row (row0), col =1. The other row (say row1) has first R at 0. Then, in the else clause, since 0 < 1 \u2192 res is false. Thus, output NO. Which is correct. Another case where the first R is in row2 (i=2), and its first column is 3. Then, subsequent rows must have first R's columns >=3. Thus, the code works. Thus, the missing code is just 'col = idx;'.",

We need to see if there's a sequence of commands such that at least one robot gets to the upper left corner (which is position (1,1) probably, but in code maybe 0-based?), without any robot moving out of the grid (which would cause an explosion). \n\nThe output is YES or NO for each test case.\n\nThe code given is in Java. Looking at the existing code structure, in the loop over each test case, they read n and m. Then there's a variable 'col' initialized as null, and a 'res' set to true. Then they loop over each row, read the row string, find the first 'R' (since row.indexOf('R') gives the first occurrence). Then if col is null, they have a TODO. Else, if the current row's R's index is less than col, set res to false.\n\nHmm. I need to figure out how this code is supposed to work. Let's think about the approach here.\n\nThe code's logic might be checking for some condition related to the columns of the robots. Let me think about what the problem requires.\n\nThe key is to find if there exists a way to move the robots such that at least one reaches the top-left corner (0,0?), without any exploding. \n\nLet me think about possible approaches. One idea is that for a robot to reach the top-left corner, it must be possible to move it there without any of its moves causing it or another robot to go out of bounds. Also, since all robots move at the same time, their paths must not cause any collision that leads to an explosion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to model this as checking certain conditions on the initial positions of the robots. Let me think of possible necessary conditions.\n\nThe upper left corner is (0,0) assuming 0-based. So for a robot to end up there, after some moves, it must be able to reach there. But moving all robots each step. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that in order for a robot to reach the top-left corner, all robots must be able to move in such a way that their paths don't cause any to go out of bounds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to see if there exists a robot which can reach the top-left without any other robot being forced to go out of bounds when moving towards it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by checking the minimal required moves for each robot and ensuring that their paths don't require any step that would make another robot go out of bounds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the solution is based on the columns of the robots. Let me think of the sample test cases given in the problem's notes.\n\nFor example, the first test case: if the robot is in the first row but to the right of the top-left, moving left would bring it there, so it's possible. The code's existing logic may be tracking the minimal column among the robots. \n\nWait, let me think of what the current code is trying to do. The code has a variable 'col' initialized as null. Then, for each row, it finds the first R in that row (row.indexOf('R') gives the first occurrence, so if there are multiple R's in a row, it takes the leftmost one? Or maybe any R's presence in a row? Wait, no, the code uses row.indexOf('R'), which is the first occurrence. But perhaps this is not the correct approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the leftmost column among all robots. Let me see:\n\nIn the code, for each row, when processing, they check 'if (col == null) { ... }' \u2014 which would be the first row where there is an R. Then, in the else clause, if the current row's first R is at a column index less than 'col', then res is set to false. So perhaps 'col' is storing the minimal column so far. Wait, but maybe the code's logic is to check that all robots are to the right of or in the same column as some reference, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to see if there is any robot that can reach the top-left corner without moving left beyond column 0. Let me think of the problem's solution.\n\nAnother approach: For a robot to reach the top-left corner (0,0), it must be able to move left and up enough steps. However, when moving, all robots move. So, suppose a robot is in row r, column c. To reach (0,0), it needs to move up (r times) and left (c times). But during these moves, all other robots must also move in such a way that they don't go out of bounds. \n\nWait, but all robots must move in the same directions each time. So the sequence of moves must be chosen such that for each move direction, every robot in that step moves in that direction without stepping out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by considering that, for all robots, their positions must allow them to be moved in such a way that at least one reaches the corner. \n\nHmm. Let me think of possible scenarios where it is possible or not. \n\nCase 1: there's a robot already in (0,0). Then the answer is YES, obviously. \n\nCase 2: A robot is in (0,1). Then moving left once would get it there. \n\nBut what about other robots? Suppose another robot is in (0, 0) already, then yes. \n\nAnother case: suppose a robot is in (2,3), and another robot is in (1,0). \n\nWait, the problem says that all robots move each time. So when moving left, the robot in (1,0) would move left to column -1 which is invalid. So that would explode. \n\nTherefore, in this scenario, to get the first robot (2,3) to (0,0), you can't choose left as a move. So perhaps the problem requires that for some direction sequence, each step's direction is chosen such that moving all robots in that direction doesn't cause any to go out of bounds, and in some step, a robot reaches (0,0).\n\nNow, to find out whether such a sequence exists, perhaps the key is to find if there exists a direction sequence where, for each step, all robots can move in the chosen direction without going out of the grid, and eventually one of them reaches (0,0). \n\nBut trying all possible sequences could be computationally intensive, but since n and m are up to 5, maybe it's manageable, but the code provided seems to have a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by checking certain conditions on the positions of the robots. \n\nThe code in the problem's existing code seems to track the leftmost column. Let me see. The variable 'col' is initially null, then for each row, they process the row's R's. \n\nWait, the code's loop is over each of the n rows. For each row, they read the row string, then get the first R's index (row.indexOf('R') gives the first occurrence of 'R').\n\nThen, if col is null (meaning this is the first row with an R?), they do the TODO part. Else, if the current row's R's index (the first R in the row) is less than col, then res becomes false. \n\nHmm. The code's initial approach may be to track the leftmost column where a robot exists in each row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is checking that all robots in rows below the first row must not have any R's to the left of the leftmost column of the first row's robots. \n\nWait, the first row is row 0, so if there is a robot in the first row, then the leftmost column of that row is important. Then, in the subsequent rows (rows below it), if any robot in those rows has a column to the left of that leftmost column, then it would be impossible to move all robots left to get to (0,0). \n\nWait, perhaps the logic is that the leftmost column among all robots must be column 0 (the top-left's column). Otherwise, moving left would not get them there? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to ensure that all robots are in such positions that they can be moved towards the top-left without any going out. \n\nHmm. Let's think of the first sample test case. \n\nSample 1: Suppose the grid has a robot in (0,1). Then, moving left once would work. The code's approach: the first row (row 0) has an R at column 1. The 'col' would be set to 1 here. For other rows (if any), their R's first index must not be less than 1. Since there are no other rows (assuming n=1?), then res remains true, so output is YES. \n\nAnother sample: in the second test case where any move causes explosion. Like if a robot is in (0,0), but other robots are in positions where moving in any direction causes some to go out. Wait, but the problem states that in each test case there is at least one robot. \n\nWait, the second test case's explanation says that trying any command causes at least one to explode. Let's say for example, the robots are in (0,0) and (0, m-1). Wait, but moving left would make the robot in (0, m-1) move, but if m is 1, then maybe that's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in that test case, all robots are in positions where moving in any direction causes at least one to explode. Like, for example, a robot is in (0,0) but another robot is in (0,1). Then moving left would not affect the first robot, but moving left for the second robot is okay, but the first is already in the corner, so that would be okay. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of a scenario where moving in any direction causes some explosion. \n\nMaybe if there are robots in (1,0) and (0,1). Let's see:\n\nSuppose the grid is 2 rows, 2 columns. So the top left is (0,0). The robots are at (1,0) and (0,1). \n\nIf we choose to move left: the robot at (0,1) moves to (0,0) - that's good. The robot at (1,0) moves to (1,-1) which is invalid. So that explodes. \n\nIf we choose up: the (1,0) robot moves up to (0,0), which is good. The (0,1) robot moves up to (-1,1) which is invalid. So that explodes. \n\nIf we choose down: the (0,1) robot can't move down (since it's row 0, moving down to row 1 is okay, but the other robot in (1,0) moving down would go to row 2 which is beyond rows (if n is 2). Wait n is 2 rows, so row indices 0 and 1. So moving down from row1 would be invalid. So moving down causes (1,0) to go to row2, which is invalid. \n\nMoving right: the (0,1) robot can't move right (since m is 2, so column1 is the last, moving right would be column2 invalid. So that explodes. The (1,0) robot would move right to column1. \n\nSo in any direction, at least one robot explodes. So the answer is no. \n\nIn this case, the code would check the first row (row0) which has an R at column 1. Then the second row (row1) has an R at column0. The code's logic: \n\nInitially, col is null, so when processing row0 (the first row with an R), the code would set col to 1 (the first R is at column1). \n\nThen processing row1: the row is \"R...\", so row.indexOf('R') is 0. \n\nSince 0 < 1 (col is 1), then the else clause triggers, and res becomes false. \n\nSo the result is NO, which matches the test case. \n\nThat suggests that the code is correct for that scenario. \n\nSo the code's logic is: \n\n- Find the leftmost column (the minimal column index among all the first occurrence of R in each row). \n\nWait, no. Let me see: \n\nWait the code is looking for the first occurrence (leftmost) in each row, and then comparing that column with the initial 'col', which is set to the first row's leftmost column. \n\nWait, actually, the code's approach is: \n\n- The first non-empty row (i.e., the first row with at least one R) is processed. The first occurrence of R in that row is the column (idx). Since col is null, they set col to that idx? \n\nWait, the code's first block is in the 'if (col == null)' clause. The existing code has a comment TODO here. So I need to fill in that part. \n\nThe code currently is incomplete there. The existing code after that is: \n\nIn the else case (when col is not null), which means we've already processed some rows before, and now in a subsequent row, the first R in this row has an index (idx) that is less than col. Then, res becomes false. \n\nSo what should be in the TODO part?\n\nProbably, the first time a row with R is found (the first row with an R), then col is set to the first R's column. \n\nWait, but maybe we have to consider the minimal column among all robots. Let me think again.\n\nThe code's logic seems to be that for the first row with R, the leftmost R's column is stored as 'col'. Then, for each subsequent row, if that row has any R whose first occurrence is to the left of 'col', then the result is false. \n\nWait, because if any row below has a robot to the left of the first row's leftmost robot, then moving left would cause that robot to move left beyond the first row's leftmost column, but maybe that's not the case? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to ensure that all robots are to the right (or equal) of the first row's leftmost robot's column, so that when moving left, they don't go further left than the first row's leftmost robot. \n\nHmm, perhaps the idea is that in order for any robot to reach the top-left corner (0,0), all the robots must be in a position where, when moving left, they don't have any robot that can't reach it. \n\nWait, the top-left corner is (0,0). So to get there, a robot must be able to move left until it reaches column 0, and up until it reaches row 0. \n\nWait, but if there are robots in lower rows (higher row numbers) that are in columns to the left of the first row's leftmost robot, then those robots would have to move left even further. \n\nWait, perhaps the logic is that for all robots to be able to move left without any exploding, their initial column must be >=0, but also, when moving left, their column can't go below 0. \n\nAlternatively, the code's approach might be to check that the leftmost column among all rows is 0, and that all robots are in rows >= their target rows (so that moving up is possible). \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to see if there's a robot in the first row (row 0) whose column is 0, so the answer is yes. Otherwise, check if there are any robots in the first row that can reach column 0 via left moves, but then also ensuring that other robots can move without explosion. \n\nHmm, maybe the code's current approach is trying to find that the leftmost column of the first row's robots is the minimal column, and that no robot in lower rows has a robot further left than that. \n\nBecause if such a robot exists in a lower row, then when moving left, that robot would go beyond the first row's leftmost robot's column, but maybe that's okay as long as they can reach 0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's logic is that the leftmost column among all robots must be column 0, and that all robots are in rows >= their target rows. \n\nWait, maybe the correct condition is that the leftmost column among all robots is 0 (so that at least one robot can reach the corner by moving left), and that all robots can be moved up to row 0. \n\nWait, but how do you ensure that? \n\nAlternatively, the code's current approach is that the leftmost column in the first row's robots (since the first row is the top row) must be 0, so that the robot can stay there. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is designed to check two things:\n\n1. There exists a robot in the first row (row 0) at column 0 (so answer is yes).\n\n2. Or, if not, then check if there exists a robot in the first row which can move left to 0, and other robots can also move left without any going out, but also, their row allows moving up to row 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key insight is that for any robot to reach (0,0), the robot must be able to move left to column 0, and move up to row 0. But moving left must not cause any robot to go beyond column 0. \n\nWait, but moving left in a command requires that each robot can move left. So all robots must have column >=1 (so that moving left would take them to column >=0). \n\nBut to reach (0,0), the robot must have a path where after some left moves, it's column 0, and then can stay there. \n\nHmm, maybe the problem can be solved by checking that:\n\n- There exists at least one robot in the first row (row 0) and in the first column (column 0). Then answer is yes.\n\n- Else, there exists a robot in the first row whose column is >=1, and its column can be reduced to 0 via some moves, while ensuring that when moving left, other robots in lower rows can also move left without going out of the grid. \n\nWait, but also, the robot must be able to get to row 0. But if the robot is in a lower row, then they need to move up. \n\nHowever, moving up would require that all the robots in their current rows can move up. \n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of the code's existing structure again.\n\nIn the code, 'col' is initially null. For each row in the input (from 0 to n-1):\n\n- get the index of the first 'R' in the row. \n\n- if col is null (meaning this is the first row with any R so far):\n\n   - then, set col to the first R's column?\n\n- else (if this row has an R's first occurrence at idx):\n\n   - if idx < col: then set res to false. \n\nThen, after all rows, output res.\n\nWait, so the code's logic is that the first row with an R has a certain leftmost column (col), and any subsequent rows must have their first R's column not less than that. \n\nIf this is the case, then the code is trying to enforce that all robots in lower rows are not to the left of the first row's leftmost R. \n\nWhy would that matter?\n\nPerhaps the idea is that if there is a robot in a lower row that is to the left of the first row's leftmost R, then moving left would cause that robot to go out of the grid. \n\nWait, let's see. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the first row (row 0) has an R at column 2 (so col =2). The second row (row1) has an R at column 1. \n\nNow, the code's condition would set res to false here. \n\nWhy? Because moving left would require that all robots move left. The robot in row1, column1, when moving left, would go to 0, which is okay. But the first row's robot at 2 would go to 1. But the other robot is at column0 after one move. \n\nWait, but in that case, the robot in row0, column2 moving left would be okay, but the robot in row1, column1 moving left to 0 is okay. So that's okay. \n\nHmm, then why would the code set res to false?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is wrong? Or perhaps the logic is different. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is designed to check that the leftmost column among all robots is 0, but the way it's structured now isn't.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nIn order for any robot to reach (0,0), there must be at least one robot that can reach that position, and when doing so, other robots don't explode. \n\nTo reach (0,0), a robot must be able to move left until it's at column 0 and move up until it's at row 0. \n\nWait, but moving up requires that they can move up steps. \n\nAlternatively:\n\nThe robot must be in a row >=0 (they are already there), so they need to move up (if they are in a lower row). \n\nBut moving up requires that they are in rows with row>0, so moving up would subtract one from the row, but for all robots in the command, they have to be able to do so without going below 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key idea is that for the robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible to move left enough times (so the robot's column is at least 0?), but also, in the process, no robot steps out. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal requirement is that there exists at least one robot which can reach (0,0) when moving left and up, and in any command sequence that allows this, all other robots do not step out. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be rephrased as: is there any direction sequence such that after some steps, one robot is at (0,0), and at every step, every robot moved in the direction without going out of the grid. \n\nThe code provided must find this condition. \n\nNow, returning to the code's structure. \n\nThe code's current variables:\n\n- col is initially null. For the first row with R's, it's set to the first R's column. \n\nThen, for each subsequent row with R's, their first R's column must not be less than col. \n\nElse, res is false. \n\nSo the code is checking that all robots in subsequent rows have their first R at column >= the first row's first R's column. \n\nWait, perhaps that's the key. Let's think: \n\nSuppose the first row's first R is at column c. \n\nThen, any robot in a lower row (row >=1) must not have a R in a column less than c. Because otherwise, when you move left, those robots would go beyond column c-1, but the first row's robots would also be moving left. \n\nWait, but that's not directly obvious. \n\nAlternatively, the idea is that the robot in the first row must be able to reach column 0. So the first row must have a robot in column 0, or can be moved left to 0 by moving left commands. \n\nBut for other robots in lower rows, if they are in a column to the right of the first row's first R's column, then when moving left, they can reach their own targets, but also their rows must be able to move up. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find that the leftmost R in any row is at least as far to the right as the first row's leftmost R. So that when moving left, the first row's R can reach column 0 (if possible), and other rows' R's can move left as well without going out. \n\nWait, but the first row's first R is the leftmost R in that row. \n\nSuppose that the first row has an R at column 2. So col is 2. \n\nAnother row has an R at column 1. \n\nThen, the second row's R is to the left of col (2), so res is set to false. \n\nThis would mean the answer is NO. \n\nBut why can't we move left once. The robot in the second row's column1 would move to 0, which is okay. The first row's robot would move to 1. \n\nSo the robot in the second row's robot reaches column0, so maybe it can contribute towards the solution. \n\nHmm, but the first row's robot is at column2: if the second row's robot is in column1, perhaps they can be moved in some way. \n\nWait in this case, maybe there is a way for the second robot in row1, column1 to reach (0,0). \n\nHow? Let me see:\n\nSuppose the second row (row1) has R at column1, and there is a robot in row0, column2. \n\nWe can try moving left once. The second row's R moves to 0 (good), first row's R moves to 1. \n\nNow, to get the second robot to row0, we can move up. \n\nWait, moving up from row1 to row0 is allowed. So after moving left once, the second row's robot is at (1,0). \n\nThen, we can issue a move up command. All robots move up. The first row's robot (row0, column1) can't move up (since they're already in row0). So moving up is allowed? Because when moving up, each robot moves in the direction only if it can. \n\nWait no, the command is to move up. So every robot must move up. The robot in row0 can't move up, so that would cause it to explode. \n\nAh! Right, so in that scenario, moving up would cause the first row's robot to try to move up from row0 to -1, which is invalid. So that command is invalid. \n\nSo to get the second row's robot to the top-left corner, we need to first move them left to column0, then move up. \n\nBut when moving up, the first row's robot (now in column1) is in row0, so moving up would result in explosion. \n\nTherefore, the sequence of commands would be: move left once. Then, issue a move up command. \n\nBut the move up command would cause the first row's robot (now in row0, column1) to try to move up, which is impossible. So that's an invalid command. \n\nHence, that scenario is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the code's check is correct here: the presence of a robot in a lower row with a first column less than the first row's first column would block the possibility. \n\nHence, the code's logic is that:\n\n- The first occurrence (leftmost) of R in each row must not be to the left of the first occurrence in the first row with R. \n\nOtherwise, there exists a robot in a lower row that can't reach the target when moving left. \n\nHence, the code's logic is that:\n\nThe leftmost R in each subsequent row must be _at least as far to the right_ as the leftmost R in the first row. \n\nBecause if there is a row below with R's first column to the left of the first row's first column, then when you move left, those robots would end up in a position that might require other moves, but the first row's R is moving left as well. But the problem comes when trying to move up. \n\nWait, but in the scenario where a lower row has a first R to the left of the first row's first R, then moving left would allow that robot to get to column0, but then to move up, you have to move all robots up. \n\nThe first row's robot would be in column (initial - steps left), but can't move up. \n\nSo, any attempt to move up would cause the first row's robots to explode. \n\nTherefore, the only way to get a robot to (0,0) would be to have it in the first row and column 0. \n\nThus, if there is any robot in the first row at column0, then the answer is yes. \n\nOtherwise, if there exists a robot in the first row, but not at column0, then in order to reach (0,0), they need to move left until they reach 0. \n\nBut any robot in a lower row that has a first R to the left of the first row's first R would block that possibility. \n\nBecause if we move left enough to get the first row's R to column0, the lower row's R would have been moving left as well. \n\nSuppose the first row's first R is at column2, and a row below has a first R at column1. \n\nTo get the first row's R to column0, you have to move left twice. \n\nBut during those moves, the lower row's R would move from 1 to 0 (after first left move), then to -1 (second left move). Which is invalid. \n\nSo that's why the code's condition is that any such lower rows must have first R's column >= first row's first R's column. \n\nSo the code's condition is correct. \n\nNow, the missing code is in the first block. \n\nIn the first block (when col is null, meaning this is the first row with an R encountered), we have to set col to the first occurrence's column. \n\nThe initial code for that block is a comment. So the code should be:\n\nif (idx != -1) { // meaning there is an R in this row\n\n    col = idx;\n\n}\n\nBut wait, the code is in a loop for each row. The first row with an R is processed here, so when finding it's first R's index (idx !=-1), then set col to idx. \n\nBut what if there are multiple R's in the first row? Well, the code's logic uses the first occurrence's column. \n\nSo the code in the TODO area should be setting 'col' to the first occurrence's column (idx), and also, since the first row is row0, we need to check if there's a robot in (0,0). \n\nWait, perhaps the code also has to check whether the first row's first R is at column 0, in which case the answer is automatically yes. \n\nWait, but according to the code's current structure, res is initialized to true. \n\nWait, in code:\n\nres is initialized as true. \n\nThen, in the loop over rows, for the first row with R, we set col to idx. \n\nThen, for other rows: if any row has a first R's column less than col, res becomes false. \n\nBut after all rows, what is the final condition? \n\nThe code outputs res: if res remains true, then it's possible. \n\nWait, but how does it account for the first row's robot's column? \n\nSuppose the first row's first R is at column 0, so col is 0. \n\nThen, any other row's first R must have column >=0 (which they are, since columns can't be negative). \n\nThus, res would stay true. \n\nWhich means the code would output YES, which is correct. \n\nAnother scenario: first row has first R at column 1, and no rows below have R's with first column <1. So res remains true. \n\nThus, the code would output YES. \n\nBut is that correct? \n\nSuppose the first row's robot is at 1 (column 1). Then, moving left once would bring it to column0. Then, it's already in row0, so it's at (0,0). \n\nThus, the answer is yes, which the code would output. \n\nAnother case: first row's first R is at column3, but there's a robot in the same row at column0. \n\nWait wait, no, because the first occurrence's idx is the first 'R' in that row. So if there's an R in column0, that would be the first occurrence, so col is set to 0. \n\nIn that case, the code would set col to 0, and other rows must have first R's at columns >=0, which they are. \n\nThus, the code would output YES, which is correct. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct except for the missing part in the first block. \n\nSo the missing code is when col is null (first row with R), then we set col to idx (the first occurrence in that row). \n\nThus, inside the if (col == null) { ... } block:\n\nThe code should be:\n\ncol = idx;\n\nBut also, perhaps if the first row is the first row (row0) and the first R's column is 0, then we can directly set res to true? \n\nWait no. Because the code's current structure only checks the column condition. \n\nHowever, the code may miss the case where a robot is already at (0,0). \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose the first row has an R at column0. Then, the first block sets col to 0. \n\nOther rows' first R's must be >=0. \n\nThe res remains true. \n\nThus, code outputs YES. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: the first row has R at column0 and another R at column2. \n\nThen, the first block sets col to 0. \n\nOther rows' first R must be >=0 (which they can be). \n\nThus, the code outputs YES. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThus, the missing code is simply setting col to idx. \n\nBut the code's first row may have multiple R's, but the first occurrence's column is the first R in the row. \n\nThus, in the first block (when col is null):\n\nif (idx != -1) { \n\n   col = idx; \n\n}\n\nWait, but in the loop over the rows, the code is processing each row. \n\nWait, but in the code, the for loop is over i from 0 to n-1. \n\nEach row is read, and for each row, we compute idx = row.indexOf('R'). \n\nSo, the first time a row with R is found (so idx is not -1), then we enter the first block (col is null). \n\nThen, we set col to idx. \n\nThus, the missing code is just col = idx. \n\nWait, but maybe the first block also needs to check whether the first row has a robot at column0. \n\nWait, no, the code's current structure doesn't do that, but perhaps the condition is already covered. \n\nBecause if the first row's first R is at 0, then col is 0, and other rows must have their first R's column >=0. \n\nThus, the code would return true. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThus, the only missing code is col = idx; \n\nWait, but the code also has the initial 'res = true'. \n\nWait, but what if there are no robots in the first row?\n\nWait, the problem states that each test case has at least one robot. \n\nBut if the first row has no R, then the first row is skipped (since idx is -1). \n\nThe first row with R is some row below. \n\nThen, the code sets col to the first occurrence's column of that first R row. \n\nThen, other rows must have their first R's column >= that col. \n\nWait, but the first R's row is not the first row. \n\nWait, the first row is the top row. So, if there are no R in the first row, then to reach the top left corner, a robot must be moved there via moving up from below. \n\nBut for that to happen, the robot must be in a row below, but moving up would require that they can move up steps until reaching row0, and during that process, no robot steps out. \n\nBut according to the code's current logic, if the first row has no R, then the first R is in row r (r>=1). \n\nThen, the code's initial 'col' is set to the first occurrence's column in that row. \n\nThen, for all subsequent rows (including rows below that row), their first R's column must not be less than col. \n\nBut what about the rows above the first R row? \n\nNo, because the loop processes rows in order. The first R is in row r. So all rows before r had no R (so their idx is -1, so those rows are skipped in the else clause. \n\nThus, the code's logic only checks for the first occurrence of R in the rows after the first occurrence row. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the loop processes all rows from 0 to n-1. \n\nThe first time a row has R (i.e., idx != -1), then col is set to that. \n\nThen, for all other rows after that (including rows before?), no. \n\nWait, no. For example, suppose the first R is in row 2 (third row). \n\nThe loop processes row0 (no R, so idx is -1, so not entering the if/else). Then row1 (no R), row2 (yes, so col set to its idx. \n\nThen, row3 and so on are processed. \n\nThe code's else clause checks for any row after the first occurrence row. \n\nBut for rows before the first R (like row0, row1), since they had no R, their idx is -1, so the else clause (which requires idx !=-1) is not triggered. \n\nThus, the code's logic is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is simply: \n\nInside the if (col == null) block: \n\nif (idx != -1) { \n\n   col = idx; \n\n} \n\nWait, no, because the code is already in the for loop over the rows, and in this iteration, the row contains an R (since idx is the first occurrence of R in the row). The code is inside the loop, so row has at least one R. \n\nWait, the row could have 'E's except for the R's. \n\nWait, the code's code is: \n\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n\n    String row = sc.next();\n\n    int idx = row.indexOf('R');\n\n    if (col == null) {\n\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n    }\n\n    else {\n\n        if (idx != -1 && idx < col)\n\n            res = false;\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, when the row has at least one R, even if idx is found (say, row has R somewhere), then in the first row with R, the first block (col is null) is executed. \n\nThe code in the first block needs to set col to idx. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\ncol = idx;\n\nBut wait, what if the row has R's but the first occurrence is at a column? \n\nYes, that's exactly what the code needs. \n\nThus, the missing code is:\n\ncol = idx;\n\nThat's the only line needed. \n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code in the TODO block is:\n\ncol = idx;\n\nSo that's the code to fill in. \n\nTesting this:\n\nIn the first test case example where the robot is in (0,1). \n\nThe first row has idx =1. \n\ncol is set to 1. \n\nOther rows (if any, but assuming n=1, so no else clause). \n\nThus res remains true \u2192 YES. \n\nAnother example where first row has R at column 1, but another row has R at column 0. \n\nThen, in the first row (row0), col =1. \n\nThe other row (say row1) has first R at 0. \n\nThen, in the else clause, since 0 < 1 \u2192 res is false. \n\nThus, output NO. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother case where the first R is in row2 (i=2), and its first column is 3. \n\nThen, subsequent rows must have first R's columns >=3. \n\nThus, the code works. \n\nThus, the missing code is just 'col = idx;'."
