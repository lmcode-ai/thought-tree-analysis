So the original was 0 (no boundary here), and the new is 1 if val ! = next. So delta is (1 if val ! = next else 0) -0 \u2192 but the current code's approach may have an error here.

But if the new element is same \u2192 delta is 0 \u2192 changeVal should be 0. So the code's current code here is adding 1 even when the new elements are same. Which is wrong. So perhaps the code is not handling all cases correctly. Similarly, the code's next part says:\n\n    else if (val == next \u2192 so in this case, the old was different (since the first condition failed \u2192 old elements were different \u2192 there was a boundary), and the new ones are same \u2192 so delta is -1 \u2192 changeVal is -1. So in this case, changeVal is -1. Thus, the code's code for the first part (the index and index+1 boundary) is:\n\n    changeVal = 0 \n\n    if old elements were same \u2192 then, if new_val ! = next \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n    else \u2192 changeVal remains 0 \n\n    else (old elements were different \u2192 there was a boundary):\n\n        if new_val == next \u2192 then changeVal = -1 \n\n        else \u2192 changeVal remains 0 (because the boundary remains) Wait, but the code's current code is written as:\n\n    if (old elements were same) \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n    else if (val == next) \u2192 changeVal = -1 \n\n    but what about the case when old was different and val ! = next \u2192 then delta is 0. So the code's current code for this part:\n\n    The first condition (old same):\n\n        changeVal is set to 1 (assuming the new_val is different from next \u2192 but it might not be. So this is wrong because it assumes that the new_val will be different from next. So the code is incorrect here. To fix this, perhaps the code should compute the new boundary state and compare with the old. Let me try to code this part properly:\n\n    For the first part (boundary between index and index+1):\n\n    prev_val = old value at index \n\n    next_val = _nums[index+1] \n\n    old_boundary = (prev_val != next_val) new_val = x (the new value) new_boundary = (x != next_val)\n\n    delta = new_boundary - old_boundary \n\n    changeVal for this boundary is delta So the contribution to the total is delta * (index) * (n - index) Wait, the position of this boundary is i = index \u2192 so (i*(n -i)). So, this would be delta * index * (n-index). Similarly for the other boundary (index-1 and index): \n\n    Let's consider that boundary (position i=index-1). prev_prev_val = _nums[index -1] \n\n    old_boundary = (prev_prev_val ! = prev_val (old)) new_boundary = (prev_prev_val != x (new val))\n\n    delta = new_boundary - old_boundary \n\n    contribution is delta * ( (index-1) * (n - (index-1)) ) So, the code needs to compute these deltas for the two boundaries and update _res accordingly. Therefore, in the Query function, for the two boundaries, we need to compute the old and new state and the delta. Let me rework the code accordingly. Let me outline the steps for the Query function: 1. Check if the new value is same as old \u2192 if yes, return _res. 2. Save the old value (old_val = _nums[index]). 3. Compute the effect on the two boundaries: \n\n        a. The left boundary (i=index-1) (only if index >0):\n\n            - old: a[index-1] != old_val \n\n            - new: a[index-1] ! = new_val \n\n            delta1 = (new ? 1 :0) - (old ?1 :0) b. The right boundary (i=index):\n\n            - old: old_val != a[index+1] (if index <n-1)\n\n            - new: new_val != a[index+1] \n\n            delta2 = (new ?1 :0 ) - (old ?1 :0 )\n\n    4. For both boundaries, compute their contribution: \n\n    For the left boundary (i=index-1):\n\n        if index >0:\n\n            contribution += delta1 * ( (index-1) * (n - (index-1)) ) For the right boundary (i=index): if index <n-1:\n\n            contribution += delta2 * ( index * (n - index) )\n\n    5. Also, there's the boundary between index and index+1 (the right boundary is at index).",

So old boundary between index-1 and index was (old_val != a[index-1]). So the code's first condition in this block is:\n\n        if (old_val == _nums[index-1] \u2192 then old boundary was 0 \u2192 so changeVal is 1? \n\n        else if (val == _nums[index-1 \u2192 then new boundary is 0 \u2192 delta is -1. So the code's current code for this part is similar to the right boundary part. The code is:\n\n        if (oldVal (original) == previous) \u2192 old boundary was 0. So new boundary is (val != previous). So delta is (newB ?1 :0) -0 \u2192 which is newB \u2192 which is 1 if val != previous. So changeVal is 1 \u2192 only if the new creates a boundary. But this is not correct because if val == previous \u2192 delta is 0. So the code's setting changeVal to 1 when old was 0 and the new may or may not create a boundary. So that's wrong. The code's current code for this block is:\n\n        if (old_val == previous \u2192 then, if the new val is not equal to previous \u2192 then delta is +1 \u2192 changeVal =1. \n\n        else \u2192 new_val equals previous \u2192 delta is 0 \u2192 changeVal remains 0. but the code's current code sets changeVal to 1 even in the case where new_val equals previous. So it's incorrect. So the missing code is in the else if part. Wait in the code, the code says:\n\n        var changeVal =0;\n\n        if (old_val == previous \u2192 changeVal =1 \u2192 but that's only correct when new_val is different from previous. \n\n        else if (val == previous \u2192 then delta is -1 \u2192 because old was different (since old ! = previous \u2192 as the first condition failed). \n\n        else \u2192 delta is 0 (because new is same as old's condition \u2192 but not sure. So the code's current approach for the left boundary is:\n\n        changeVal is set to 1 (if old was equal \u2192 new may be different or same), but this is wrong. So the correct code should compute deltaLeft as (newBLeft - oldBLeft). So to fix this, the code would need to compute the oldB and newB, then delta. Since the user is to fill in the missing part, which is the TODO: Your code here in the code's Query function. Looking at the provided code's Query function:\n\n        In the left boundary's part (the index>0 part):\n\n        there is an else if (val == _nums[index-1]) \u2192 \n\n        but the code after the 'if' condition then has:\n\n        if (old_val == previous) \u2192 then changeVal =1 \n\n        else if (val == previous \u2192 changeVal =-1 \n\n        // but what if neither of those are true? Then changeVal remains 0. So the code is handling those cases. The problem is in the first condition. Let me re-express the first condition's logic:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous (i.e. a[index-1] == old_val \u2192 so the old had no boundary between index-1 and index \u2192 oldB is 0. Then, the new value is val. So newB is (val != previous). So delta is newB?1:0 - 0 \u2192 newB?1:0 \u2192 which is 1 if val ! = previous, else 0. So the changeVal should be (val != previous ? 1 :0). But the code is setting it to 1 regardless of that \u2192 which is wrong. So the code's first condition's changeVal is not correct.",

Alternatively, the code can compute the changeVal as \n\n        changeVal = (val != previous) ? 1 :0 \n\n        - (oldVal != previous ? 1 :0 )\n\n        which is exactly deltaLeft. So in code:\n\n        changeVal = ( (val != previous) ? 1 :0 ) - ( (oldVal ! = previous) ? 1 :0 ) So:\n\n        var prev = _nums[index-1]; \n\n        changeVal = (val != prev ? 1 :0) - (oldVal ! = prev ? 1 :0); \n\n        That would correctly compute deltaLeft. So the code's current approach is not computing this delta correctly, and the user's task is to fill in the missing part where the code says // TODO: Your code here. Looking back to the provided code's Query function:\n\n        The code for the index>0 part:\n\n        if (index > 0)\n\n        {\n\n            var changeVal = 0;\n\n            if (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n\n            {\n\n                changeVal = 1;\n\n            }\n\n            else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n            {\n\n                changeVal = -1;\n\n            }\n\n            _res += index * changeVal;\n\n        }\n\n        Wait wait, the first condition is checking whether the old value equal to previous?",

Looking at the code for index>0: \n\n        The block has:\n\n        if (oldVal (current before change) == previous \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n        else if (val == previous \u2192 changeVal =-1 But then in the else if block, there is a 'TODO' comment. Wait, perhaps the code's 'else if' is missing some cases. The missing code is the part that sets changeVal to -1 in certain cases. Wait, the code's current 'else if' for the first block is:\n\n        else if (val == previous \u2192 then changeVal is set to -1 \u2192 that is correct for the case where old was different from previous (so oldB was 1), and new is same \u2192 delta is -1 \u2192 so changeVal is -1. But the first condition is incorrect because it sets changeVal to1 even if val == previous. The 'TODO' is in the else if's block. Wait, the code's first block (index>0):\n\n        The first 'if' block is for when oldVal == previous \u2192 oldB is 0. Then, inside that block's 'TODO' is not there. The 'TODO' is in the else if block's code (the val == previous case). But perhaps the user left this code to be filled in. Wait, the code in the else if is:\n\n        else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n        {\n\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n        } So the current code's else if block has nothing. So the code is missing the code for this block. The correct code for this block should set changeVal to -1. Because in this case, when val (new value) is equal to previous, we have newB is 0, but oldB was (oldVal != previous \u2192 because the first condition failed \u2192 oldVal ! = previous \u2192 so oldB was 1. So delta is (0 -1) \u2192-1 \u2192 so changeVal should be -1. Which is exactly what the code is doing. Wait no, the code inside the else if is empty, but the line 'changeVal =-1' is already done before the TODO comment? Wait no, the code is written as:\n\n        else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n        {\n\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n        } So the code currently has nothing inside the else if block. So the user must fill in the missing line 'changeVal = -1;' Ah, so the missing code is simply 'changeVal = -1;'\n\n        So that's the first thing to fix. Then, the first 'if' block is incorrect because it sets changeVal to 1 even if val == previous. So the first 'if' block also needs to be fixed. Looking at the first 'if' block in the index>0 case:\n\n        if (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n\n        {\n\n            changeVal =1;\n\n        }\n\n        This block is checking whether the old value (before the change) equals previous. If so, then the oldB was 0. Now, the new value is val. The newB is whether val ! = previous. changeVal should be (newB ?1 :0) - 0 \u2192 so it should be 1 only if val != previous. So the current code is setting changeVal to 1 even if val is same as previous. So this 'if' block is wrong. The correct code should be:\n\n        if (_nums[index] == previous \u2192 oldB was 0. if val ! = previous \u2192 changeVal +=1 \n\n            else \u2192 changeVal remains 0 So in this case, the code's first 'if' block is setting changeVal to 1 regardless of val's value. This is incorrect. So the code should set changeVal to 1 only if val is different from previous. To fix that, the first 'if' block should have:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous (== _nums[index-1])\n\n            if (val ! = previous \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n            else \u2192 changeVal =0 But how to do this in code?",

Looking at the code's first 'if' block in index>0:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous \u2192 then changeVal =1 But that is incorrect. However, perhaps the code's other parts compensate for this mistake. Alternatively, maybe there's another error in the code. Alternatively, perhaps the code's initial 'InitRes()' is incorrect, and we are to only fill in the missing line. Since the user's instructions say to output only the missing code, which in this case is the 'changeVal =-1;' in the else if block. Thus, the missing code is simply:\n\n        changeVal = -1; So that's the line to fill in the TODO. But wait, in the code's else if block (val == previous \u2192 which is the case where new_val is same as previous), the code is supposed to set changeVal to -1. So the code inside the else if should be:\n\n        changeVal = -1;\n\n        Thus, the missing code is 'changeVal = -1;'\n\n        So the TODO block requires that line. Therefore, the answer to this problem's missing code is to fill in that line. Now, checking if other parts of the code have errors. The code's third part (when both left and right boundaries are affected):\n\n        The code has:\n\n        if (index <n-1 && index >0)\n\n        {\n\n            var changeVal=0; \n\n            // check the right boundary \n\n            if (oldVal == next \u2192 old B was 0 \u2192 new B is (val ! = next \u2192 then changeVal +=1 \n\n            else if val == next \u2192 changeVal -=1 \n\n            similarly for left boundary. // then, the code adds changeVal * (index)*(n-index-1) \n\n        } \n\n        This part seems to be trying to handle the cross terms between the left and right boundaries. Perhaps this part is also incorrect, but since the problem's instructions say to output only the missing code, and the missing code is the 'changeVal =-1;' in the TODO, then that's sufficient. Therefore, the missing code to fill in is 'changeVal =-1;'\n\n        So the final answer is that line. But to confirm, let's check the sample input's first query.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to compute the sum of the awesomeness of all subsegments of an array after each update. The key here is to efficiently calculate this sum, especially since the array can be up to 1e5 elements and there are up to 1e5 queries. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the awesomeness of a subsegment is. The awesomeness is the minimum number of consecutive identical number blocks the subsegment can be split into. For example, [1,2,2] would have an awesomeness of 2 because it's split into [1] and [2,2]. \n\nThe brute-force approach would be, after each update, to iterate over all possible subsegments and compute their awesomeness. But that's O(n^2) per query, which is way too slow for n=1e5. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLooking at the code provided, it's trying to use some kind of segment structure and a precomputed _res variable that's updated with each query. The current code's Query method has some parts missing, which I need to fill in. Let me see what's already there.\n\nIn the Query function, when we change the value at position 'index' from old to new 'val', the code is trying to adjust the _res based on the changes in the segments. The idea is probably tracking the number of segment boundaries and how each change affects the total sum.\n\nLet me think about how the awesomeness contributes to the total sum. Each time the value changes between adjacent elements, it creates a boundary. The awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is equal to 1 plus the number of boundaries between l and r. Because each boundary increases the split count by 1. So for example, if there are k boundaries in the subarray, the awesomeness is k+1.\n\nTherefore, the total sum over all subarrays is the sum over all possible [l, r] of (number of boundaries in [l, r] +1). Which can be rewritten as sum_{l=1 to n} sum_{r=l to n} (1 + number of boundaries between l and r). This simplifies to the total number of possible subarrays (n(n+1)/2) plus the sum over all boundaries between i and i+1 of the number of subarrays that include this boundary.\n\nFor a boundary between positions i and i+1 (i.e., a[i] != a[i+1]), the number of subarrays that include it is exactly i * (n - i). Because l can be from 1 to i, and r can be from i+1 to n. Wait, actually, any subarray that starts at l \u2264 i and ends at r \u2265 i+1 will include this boundary. So the count is (i) * (n - i). \n\nTherefore, the total sum is (total number of subarrays) + sum over all boundaries of (i) * (n - i). \n\nSo, the problem reduces to maintaining the number of boundaries and their positions, so that when an element is changed, we can efficiently compute the change in the sum. \n\nThe initial code's InitRes function seems to be trying to compute the initial sum. Let me see. \n\nWait in the InitRes method, there's some code that was commented out and then a different approach. The current code in the InitRes loops through and calculates a variable tmp which might be the sum of the awesomeness for each starting point? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me look again.\n\nThe code in InitRes has:\n\nvar segCount = 1;\ntmp starts at 1 (since i starts at 1?), then for each i from 1 to n-1:\nif the current element is different from previous, segCount increments. Then, tmp += segCount. \nSo after the first loop, tmp is the sum of the awesomeness of all subarrays starting at index 0 (assuming 0-based) and ending at each position. Because for each i, segCount is the number of segments up to i, so the awesomeness of the subarray [0, i] is segCount. So summing all those gives the sum for all subarrays starting at 0. \n\nThen, the next loop starts from i=1, and for each i, subtracts 1 from tmp each time? Wait, not sure. Maybe the code is trying to compute the total sum by some other approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the total sum as the number of boundaries. Let me think again:\n\nEach boundary between i and i+1 contributes (i) * (n -i) to the total sum. So the total sum is (n*(n+1)/2) (since every subarray has at least 1, and there are n(n+1)/2 subarrays) plus the sum over all boundaries of (i)*(n-i). \n\nTherefore, if we can track the current number of boundaries and their positions, then each time we update a value, we can compute how the boundaries change, and update the total sum accordingly.\n\nSo the key is to track all boundaries between elements, and compute the sum of (i)*(n -i) for each boundary i.\n\nNow, when an element is updated, say position index is changed from old_val to new_val, we need to see how this affects the boundaries at index-1 and index (assuming 0-based). Let's see:\n\nThe boundaries are between elements i and i+1 for i from 0 to n-2. \n\nWhen we change the value at index, the boundaries that can be affected are:\n\n- The boundary before index (i=index-1) between index-1 and index.\n\n- The boundary after index (i=index) between index and index+1.\n\nAdditionally, if we are at the first or last element, only one boundary is affected. \n\nSo for each of these two positions (index-1 and index), we need to check whether they were boundaries before the change, and whether they are after the change. \n\nThe steps would be:\n\nFor each boundary at position i (i=index-1 and i=index):\n\n1. Before the update, check if there was a boundary at i. \n\n2. After the update, check if there is now a boundary at i. \n\nThe difference (new_boundary - old_boundary) is the change in the contribution of that boundary. \n\nThe total change is (delta_i) * (i)*(n -i). \n\nBut also, we have to consider the other direction: when a boundary is removed (delta is -1), we subtract its contribution, or added (delta is +1), we add it.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\n- For the current index, check the two adjacent boundaries (if they exist).\n\n- For each of those boundaries, compute the old contribution (whether they were present before the change) and the new contribution (after the change).\n\n- Compute the delta for each boundary and adjust the total sum accordingly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- The total sum is stored as _res. To compute initial value, we can iterate over all possible boundaries and compute the sum of i*(n -i) for each boundary, then add the base (n*(n+1)/2).\n\nWait, actually the base is n(n+1)/2, since every subarray contributes 1, which is the base, then each boundary contributes i*(n-i). \n\nTherefore, the total is base + sum of (i*(n -i) for each boundary between i and i+1).\n\nIn the code's current structure, the Query function is trying to adjust _res when a value is changed. \n\nLooking at the existing code in Query:\n\nThe first part checks if the new value is same as old, if so return _res.\n\nThen, for the index < n-1 (i.e., not the last element):\n\nThey check if the current element (old value) was equal to the next element. If so, then changing it might affect that boundary. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the delta for the boundaries. Let's look at the code step by step.\n\nIn the code:\n\nif (index < _n-1)\n\n    var changeVal = 0;\n\n    if (_nums[index] == _nums[index+1]) \u2192 old value had no boundary here, so if after setting to val, if val == next element, then no change. But if the new value is different, then a boundary is added. \n\n    So, the current code is trying to compute the change in the boundary between index and index+1.\n\n    The code says: \n\n    if the previous (old) index and next were same \u2192 then, after changing to val, if val is equal to next, then no change. But if the new val is different, then a new boundary is added here. \n\n    So the changeVal would be +1 (since a boundary is added). \n\n    The code says:\n\n    if (old's current and next same \u2192 then, after change, if new val is same as next \u2192 no change \u2192 delta is 0, else delta is +1.\n\n    Wait, the code's current code says:\n\n    if (old elements were same \u2192 then, if the new val is same as next, then the boundary remains same \u2192 delta is 0. \n\n    But if the new val is different \u2192 a boundary is now present. \n\n    So the delta here is 1 (since it was not a boundary (since old was same) and now it is a boundary (new val different from next). \n\n    So the code's first block:\n\n    if (old's current and next were same \u2192 then changing to val may introduce a boundary. \n\n    So changeVal is 1 (because previous had no boundary, now we add a boundary \u2192 delta is +1. Wait no. Wait:\n\n    Original boundary: was false (since same). After change, if new val and next are same \u2192 remains false \u2192 delta 0. \n\n    If new val and next are different \u2192 becomes true \u2192 delta +1. \n\n    So changeVal is (new condition ? 1 : 0) - old condition (which was 0). \n\n    So the total delta for this boundary is (new_val != next ? 1 :0) - (old condition). \n\n    The old condition here was true (since _nums[index] == next \u2192 so original was not a boundary (since boundary is only when they are different). \n\n    So the original was 0 (no boundary here), and the new is 1 if val != next. \n\n    So delta is (1 if val != next else 0) -0 \u2192 but the current code's approach may have an error here. \n\n    Wait in the code:\n\n    The code says:\n\n    if (old elements were same (so no boundary here before), then changeVal is 1 (meaning that the delta is +1 if the new creates a boundary). \n\n    Wait, but the code's first condition:\n\n    if _nums[index] (old) == _nums[index+1], then \n\n    changeVal =1: which I think is incorrect. Because changing to val may create a boundary. So changeVal is the delta contribution for that boundary. \n\n    Wait, the code's initial approach for this part is:\n\n    The code's first part (index <n-1) is handling the boundary between index and index+1. \n\n    The code computes changeVal as follows:\n\n    if (old elements were same (so previous boundary was 0 here), and after the change, new val is not same as next (so new boundary is 1 here) \u2192 delta is 1 - 0 =1 \u2192 changeVal should be +1. \n\n    But if new val is same as next \u2192 delta 0. \n\n    So the code's first part is:\n\n    if the old had no boundary here (they were same), then:\n\n        if new val and next are different \u2192 delta is +1 \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n        else \u2192 delta 0 \u2192 changeVal 0. \n\n    So the first condition in the code is:\n\n    if (old elements were same \u2192 then, if new_val is different from next \u2192 changeVal +=1 \n\n    else, if the new_val is same \u2192 changeVal remains 0. \n\n    The code's current code for this first condition is:\n\n    if (old elements were same \u2192 then changeVal=1 \n\n    else if (val == next element \u2192 then delta is -1 (since the old was a boundary (since elements were different), and now it is not \u2192 so the boundary is removed \u2192 delta is -1. \n\n    But in code, the first part is handling the case when the old elements were same (so changeVal is set to 1?), but that may not capture the case where after the change, the new elements become same again. \n\n    Wait, perhaps the code is not handling that correctly. \n\n    The code currently has:\n\n    if (_nums[index] == _nums[index+1]) \u2192 old had no boundary here. \n\n    So changeVal is set to 1 \u2192 which is the delta if the new creates a boundary. \n\n    But if after setting val, the new value is same as next \u2192 then the delta is 0, so the change should be 0. \n\n    So the code here is not correct. \n\n    Because the code is setting changeVal=1 in this case, but if the new value equals next, then the change is not 1. \n\n    So the code is wrong here. \n\n    The same applies to the else part. \n\n    Hmm. \n\n    So perhaps the approach in the code is incorrect, and it's better to compute for each boundary whether it was present before and after the change. \n\n    Let me think of the correct way to handle each of the two boundaries (the previous and next to index). \n\n    Let's consider the two boundaries:\n\n    1. The boundary before index: between (index-1) and index. \n\n    2. The boundary after index: between index and index+1. \n\n    For each of these boundaries (if they exist), we need to compute the delta (new_boundary - old_boundary). \n\n    So for each boundary (say at position i):\n\n    old_boundary = (a[i] != a[i+1])\n\n    new_boundary = (new_val_left != new_val_right) \n\n    where new_val_left and new_val_right are the new values at the two sides. \n\n    For example, for the boundary between index-1 and index:\n\n    The left side is a[index-1], and the right side is the new value (val) at index. \n\n    So new_boundary here would be (a[index-1] != val). \n\n    Wait no, after the change, the index's value is val, so the right side is val, and the left is a[index-1]. \n\n    So for this boundary (position i = index-1), the old was (a[i] != a[i+1]). The new is (a[i] != val). \n\n    For the boundary between index and index+1 (position i = index):\n\n    The left is val (the new value at index), the right is a[index+1]. \n\n    So new_boundary is (val != a[index+1])\n\n    So for each of these two boundaries (if they exist), we compute the delta (new - old).\n\n    Then, for each such boundary, the contribution to the total sum is delta * (i * (n -i)). \n\n    So the total delta to the _res is sum over these two boundaries of (delta_i) * (i*(n-i)).\n\n    Additionally, we have to adjust for the other boundaries that might have been affected? Or just these two? Because changing the value at index can only affect those two boundaries. \n\n    So, the correct approach would be:\n\n    1. For the boundaries at positions (index-1) and (index), compute their old and new states. \n\n    2. Calculate the delta for each (new_state - old_state).\n\n    3. The total change to the sum is (delta1) * ( (index-1) * (n - (index-1)) ) + (delta2) * (index * (n - index)) )\n\n    So, for each boundary, the contribution to the total is the delta multiplied by the weight (i*(n -i)), and summed over both boundaries. \n\n    So the code's current approach is trying to do something similar but perhaps not correctly. \n\n    Let me look back at the code's initial approach. \n\n    The code's code for index <n-1:\n\n    They are calculating a \"changeVal\" which is likely the delta (new - old) for that boundary. \n\n    The code says:\n\n    if (old elements were same (no boundary) \u2192 then, if the new value is different from next \u2192 then the new boundary is added \u2192 delta is +1 \u2192 so changeVal is set to 1. \n\n    However, in this case, if the new value is same as the next, then delta is 0. \n\n    So this part of code is incorrect because it can't account for that scenario. \n\n    The code's first part (for the boundary at index and index+1):\n\n    The code is trying to compute changeVal for that boundary. \n\n    The first condition is if the old elements were same \u2192 so old boundary was 0. \n\n    Then, if the new element (val) is different from next \u2192 new boundary is 1 \u2192 delta is 1 \u2192 so changeVal is 1. \n\n    But if the new element is same \u2192 delta is 0 \u2192 changeVal should be 0. \n\n    So the code's current code here is adding 1 even when the new elements are same. \n\n    Which is wrong. \n\n    So perhaps the code is not handling all cases correctly. \n\n    Similarly, the code's next part says:\n\n    else if (val == next \u2192 so in this case, the old was different (since the first condition failed \u2192 old elements were different \u2192 there was a boundary), and the new ones are same \u2192 so delta is -1 \u2192 changeVal is -1. \n\n    So in this case, changeVal is -1. \n\n    Thus, the code's code for the first part (the index and index+1 boundary) is:\n\n    changeVal = 0 \n\n    if old elements were same \u2192 then, if new_val != next \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n    else \u2192 changeVal remains 0 \n\n    else (old elements were different \u2192 there was a boundary):\n\n        if new_val == next \u2192 then changeVal = -1 \n\n        else \u2192 changeVal remains 0 (because the boundary remains)\n\n    Wait, but the code's current code is written as:\n\n    if (old elements were same) \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n    else if (val == next) \u2192 changeVal = -1 \n\n    but what about the case when old was different and val != next \u2192 then delta is 0. \n\n    So the code's current code for this part:\n\n    The first condition (old same):\n\n        changeVal is set to 1 (assuming the new_val is different from next \u2192 but it might not be. So this is wrong because it assumes that the new_val will be different from next. \n\n    So the code is incorrect here. \n\n    To fix this, perhaps the code should compute the new boundary state and compare with the old. \n\n    Let me try to code this part properly:\n\n    For the first part (boundary between index and index+1):\n\n    prev_val = old value at index \n\n    next_val = _nums[index+1] \n\n    old_boundary = (prev_val != next_val)\n\n    new_val = x (the new value) \n\n    new_boundary = (x != next_val)\n\n    delta = new_boundary - old_boundary \n\n    changeVal for this boundary is delta \n\n    So the contribution to the total is delta * (index) * (n - index) \n\n    Wait, the position of this boundary is i = index \u2192 so (i*(n -i)). \n\n    So, this would be delta * index * (n-index). \n\n    Similarly for the other boundary (index-1 and index): \n\n    Let's consider that boundary (position i=index-1). \n\n    prev_prev_val = _nums[index -1] \n\n    old_boundary = (prev_prev_val != prev_val (old))\n\n    new_boundary = (prev_prev_val != x (new val))\n\n    delta = new_boundary - old_boundary \n\n    contribution is delta * ( (index-1) * (n - (index-1)) )\n\n    So, the code needs to compute these deltas for the two boundaries and update _res accordingly. \n\n    Therefore, in the Query function, for the two boundaries, we need to compute the old and new state and the delta. \n\n    Let me rework the code accordingly. \n\n    Let me outline the steps for the Query function:\n\n    1. Check if the new value is same as old \u2192 if yes, return _res. \n\n    2. Save the old value (old_val = _nums[index]). \n\n    3. Compute the effect on the two boundaries: \n\n        a. The left boundary (i=index-1) (only if index >0):\n\n            - old: a[index-1] != old_val \n\n            - new: a[index-1] != new_val \n\n            delta1 = (new ? 1 :0) - (old ?1 :0)\n\n        b. The right boundary (i=index):\n\n            - old: old_val != a[index+1] (if index <n-1)\n\n            - new: new_val != a[index+1] \n\n            delta2 = (new ?1 :0 ) - (old ?1 :0 )\n\n    4. For both boundaries, compute their contribution: \n\n    For the left boundary (i=index-1):\n\n        if index >0:\n\n            contribution += delta1 * ( (index-1) * (n - (index-1)) )\n\n    For the right boundary (i=index):\n\n        if index <n-1:\n\n            contribution += delta2 * ( index * (n - index) )\n\n    5. Also, there's the boundary between index and index+1 (the right boundary is at index). \n\n    Additionally, the code may also have a third boundary between index-1 and index and the right one, but only the two adjacent boundaries. \n\n    So the total delta is the sum of delta1 * term1 + delta2 * term2. \n\n    Then, _res += delta (the total delta). \n\n    Then, set _nums[index] to new_val. \n\n    Therefore, the code must compute the deltas for these two boundaries and apply them. \n\n    Now, the existing code in the Query function:\n\n    Let me look at the existing code's first part (for index < n-1):\n\n    var changeVal =0; \n\n    if (old elements were same \u2192 so old boundary was 0)\n\n        changeVal=1 \u2192 which would be correct only if new_val != next_val \u2192 but that's not handled here. \n\n    else if (new_val equals next_val \u2192 delta is -1 \u2192 so changeVal =-1 \n\n    but the code's current code for the first part (index < n-1) is:\n\n        if (_nums[index] == _nums[index+1]) \u2192 old was no boundary \u2192 so new boundary is (val != next_val)\n\n        \u2192 delta is (new_boundary?1:0) - 0 \u2192 which is new_boundary \u2192 which is 1 if they differ. \n\n        So the code is setting changeVal to 1, but that's only if the new boundary is present. \n\n        Thus, the code has:\n\n        if (old was same \u2192 then changeVal is 1 \u2192 which is wrong because if new is same, delta is 0, not 1. \n\n    So the code's current approach is incorrect here. \n\n    To fix this, perhaps the code should compute delta for each boundary properly. \n\n    Let me think how to implement this correctly. \n\n    Let me first handle the right boundary (index and index+1):\n\n    The code's first part (index <n-1):\n\n    The code is trying to compute the delta for this boundary. \n\n    Let me re-calculate the delta properly. \n\n    prev_val is the old value at index. \n\n    The old boundary was (prev_val != a[index+1]). \n\n    The new boundary is (x != a[index+1]). \n\n    delta = (new ? 1 :0) - (old ?1 :0). \n\n    So the code should compute:\n\n    var oldBoundaryRight = (prev_val != _nums[index+1]);\n\n    var newBoundaryRight = (x != _nums[index+1]);\n\n    var deltaRight = (newBoundaryRight ? 1 : 0) - (oldBoundaryRight ? 1 : 0);\n\n    The contribution from this boundary is deltaRight * (index * (n - index)). \n\n    Then, add this to the _res. \n\n    Similarly for the left boundary (index-1):\n\n    if (index >0):\n\n        var prevLeft = _nums[index-1]; \n\n        oldBoundaryLeft = (prevLeft != prev_val);\n\n        newBoundaryLeft = (prevLeft != x);\n\n        deltaLeft = (newBoundaryLeft ?1:0) - (oldBoundaryLeft ?1:0);\n\n        contribution += deltaLeft * ( (index -1)* (n - (index-1)) )\n\n    So, the code should compute these deltas and update the _res. \n\n    The existing code's approach is trying to do this but with incorrect logic. So the code needs to be reworked. \n\n    Let me see what the code currently has in the Query function:\n\n    Let me look at the code again:\n\n    public long Query(int index, int val)\n    {\n        if (_nums[index] == val) return _res;\n        int oldVal = _nums[index]; // Adding this line\n\n        // Handling the right boundary (index and index+1)\n        if (index < _n-1)\n        {\n            var changeVal = 0;\n            if (oldVal == _nums[index+1]) // old had no boundary\n            {\n                changeVal = 1; // If new val makes it a boundary...\n                // Wait no, maybe not. If new val is different from next, that's a boundary. \n\n                // So this is incorrect. \n\n            }\n            else if (val == _nums[index+1]) // new has no boundary (old had boundary)\n            {\n                changeVal = -1;\n            }\n            // else new is same as before? No change, so 0\n\n            // The problem is here. The code is not considering all cases. \n\n            // The correct delta is (newBoundary - oldBoundary)\n\n            // So:\n\n            // oldBoundary = (oldVal != next)\n            // newBoundary = (val != next)\n            // delta = newBoundary ? 1 :0 - oldBoundary ?1:0\n\n            // So:\n\n            bool oldB = (oldVal != _nums[index+1]);\n            bool newB = (val != _nums[index+1]);\n            var deltaRight = (newB ?1:0) - (oldB?1:0);\n            changeVal = deltaRight;\n\n            _res += deltaRight * ( (long)index * ( _n - index ) );\n        }\n\n        // similar for left boundary (index-1 and index)\n        if (index >0)\n        {\n            var changeVal =0;\n            if (oldVal == _nums[index-1])\n            {\n                changeVal =1; // if new val is different from previous \n                // Wait, need to compute similarly. \n\n                bool oldB = (oldVal != _nums[index-1]); // oldVal was previous value, so oldB is (previous_prev != old_val)\n                // Wait, no. Wait: \n\n                oldB = ( _nums[index-1] != oldVal ); \n\n                newB = ( _nums[index-1] != val );\n\n                deltaLeft = (newB ?1:0) - (oldB?1:0);\n\n                changeVal = deltaLeft; \n\n                _res += deltaLeft * ( (long)(index-1) * ( _n - (index-1) ) );\n            }\n            else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n            {\n                changeVal =-1; \n\n                // etc. \n\n            }\n\n            // this part is also incorrect. \n\n        }\n\n        // Also, the code has an else part that is missing. \n\n        // The code's current code for the left boundary is incomplete. \n\n        // So the existing code is incorrect. \n\n    }\n\n    So, the correct approach is to compute delta for each boundary properly, and apply the corresponding change. \n\n    Therefore, in the code, the code needs to be restructured. \n\n    Let me try to write the code for the Query function correctly. \n\n    Let's see the steps again:\n\n    When changing the value at index from old_val to new_val (val):\n\n    1. Save the old value (old_val). \n\n    2. Compute the left boundary (index-1):\n\n    if index >0:\n\n        left_prev = a[index-1]\n\n        oldBLeft = (left_prev != old_val) \n\n        newBLeft = (left_prev != val )\n\n        deltaLeft = (newBLeft ? 1 :0) - (oldBLeft ?1 :0)\n\n        contribution += deltaLeft * ( (index-1) * (n - (index-1)) )\n\n    3. Compute the right boundary (index and index+1):\n\n    if index < n-1:\n\n        right_next = a[index+1]\n\n        oldBRight = (old_val != right_next)\n\n        newBRight = (val != right_next)\n\n        deltaRight = (newBRight ?1:0) - (oldBRight ?1:0)\n\n        contribution += deltaRight * ( index * (n - index) )\n\n    4. Also, check if the current index is part of a boundary with previous elements. Wait no, only the two adjacent boundaries are affected. \n\n    5. Then, the _res += (deltaLeft + deltaRight) * their terms. \n\n    So the code must calculate these deltaLeft and deltaRight. \n\n    Now, looking back at the current code's Query function's code, we can see that the code is trying to handle the left and right boundaries, but is not computing the delta correctly. \n\n    Let's try to rewrite the code's Query function with the correct logic. \n\n    Perhaps the code's current Query function's code has some parts that can be fixed with the following steps. \n\n    For example, the left boundary's code:\n\n    In the code, the part for the left boundary is:\n\n    if (index >0)\n    {\n        var changeVal =0;\n        if (old_val == _nums[index-1]) \u2192 old boundary was 0 (since left was same as old_val)\n            changeVal =1 \u2192 but this is incorrect. \n\n        else if (val == _nums[index-1]) \u2192 new boundary is 0 \u2192 delta is -1 \u2192 so changeVal =-1 \n\n        // else: the new boundary remains same as old \u2192 delta 0. \n\n        _res += index * changeVal; \n\n    }\n\n    Wait, why are they multiplying by index? \n\n    Wait, the contribution for the left boundary (position i=index-1) is (delta) * ( (i) * (n -i) )\n\n    where i is index-1. \n\n    So the term is (index-1) * (n - (index-1)). \n\n    So the code's existing code is multiplying by index (the original index, not i). \n\n    So that's also wrong. \n\n    So the code has many errors. \n\n    Since the problem is in the code's Query function, and the user is to fill in the missing parts (marked with \"TODO: Your code here\"), I need to see exactly where the missing code is. \n\n    Looking back at the code provided by the user: \n\n    In the Query method:\n\n    In the second part (for the index>0):\n\n    if (index > 0)\n\n    {\n\n        var changeVal =0;\n\n        if (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1]) \u2192 Wait, no. Wait, the code has:\n\n        if the old value (before the change) was equal to previous element \u2192 so old boundary was (old_val != previous \u2192 no, because if they are equal, there's no boundary. \n\n        So old boundary between index-1 and index was (old_val != a[index-1]). \n\n        So the code's first condition in this block is:\n\n        if (old_val == _nums[index-1] \u2192 then old boundary was 0 \u2192 so changeVal is 1? \n\n        else if (val == _nums[index-1 \u2192 then new boundary is 0 \u2192 delta is -1. \n\n        So the code's current code for this part is similar to the right boundary part. \n\n        The code is:\n\n        if (oldVal (original) == previous) \u2192 old boundary was 0. \n\n        So new boundary is (val != previous). \n\n        So delta is (newB ?1 :0) -0 \u2192 which is newB \u2192 which is 1 if val != previous. \n\n        So changeVal is 1 \u2192 only if the new creates a boundary. \n\n        But this is not correct because if val == previous \u2192 delta is 0. \n\n        So the code's setting changeVal to 1 when old was 0 and the new may or may not create a boundary. \n\n        So that's wrong. \n\n        The code's current code for this block is:\n\n        if (old_val == previous \u2192 then, if the new val is not equal to previous \u2192 then delta is +1 \u2192 changeVal =1. \n\n        else \u2192 new_val equals previous \u2192 delta is 0 \u2192 changeVal remains 0. \n\n        but the code's current code sets changeVal to 1 even in the case where new_val equals previous. \n\n        So it's incorrect. \n\n        So the missing code is in the else if part. \n\n        Wait in the code, the code says:\n\n        var changeVal =0;\n\n        if (old_val == previous \u2192 changeVal =1 \u2192 but that's only correct when new_val is different from previous. \n\n        else if (val == previous \u2192 then delta is -1 \u2192 because old was different (since old != previous \u2192 as the first condition failed). \n\n        else \u2192 delta is 0 (because new is same as old's condition \u2192 but not sure. \n\n        So the code's current approach for the left boundary is:\n\n        changeVal is set to 1 (if old was equal \u2192 new may be different or same), but this is wrong. \n\n        So the correct code should compute deltaLeft as (newBLeft - oldBLeft). \n\n        So to fix this, the code would need to compute the oldB and newB, then delta. \n\n        Since the user is to fill in the missing part, which is the TODO: Your code here in the code's Query function. \n\n        Looking at the provided code's Query function:\n\n        In the left boundary's part (the index>0 part):\n\n        there is an else if (val == _nums[index-1]) \u2192 \n\n        but the code after the 'if' condition then has:\n\n        if (old_val == previous) \u2192 then changeVal =1 \n\n        else if (val == previous \u2192 changeVal =-1 \n\n        // but what if neither of those are true? \n\n        Then changeVal remains 0. \n\n        So the code is handling those cases. \n\n        The problem is in the first condition. \n\n        Let me re-express the first condition's logic:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous (i.e. a[index-1] == old_val \u2192 so the old had no boundary between index-1 and index \u2192 oldB is 0. \n\n        Then, the new value is val. \n\n        So newB is (val != previous). \n\n        So delta is newB?1:0 - 0 \u2192 newB?1:0 \u2192 which is 1 if val != previous, else 0. \n\n        So the changeVal should be (val != previous ? 1 :0). \n\n        But the code is setting it to 1 regardless of that \u2192 which is wrong. \n\n        So the code's first condition's changeVal is not correct. \n\n        The code's first part (if old was same with previous):\n\n            then changeVal is set to 1 \u2192 but that is only correct when new is different from previous. \n\n            else (if new is same as previous \u2192 delta 0 \u2192 but code sets changeVal to1 \u2192 which would be wrong. \n\n        So the code's first part is wrong. \n\n        So the correct way is to compute:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous \u2192 oldB is 0. \n\n        newB is (val != previous) \u2192 so delta is (1 if val != previous else 0). \n\n        So changeVal should be (val != previous ? 1 :0) \n\n        So in code: \n\n        changeVal = (val != _nums[index-1] ? 1 : 0);\n\n        // so the first condition's code is wrong. \n\n        The code now has:\n\n        if (oldVal == _nums[index-1])\n\n        {\n\n            changeVal =1; \n\n        }\n\n        else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n        {\n\n            changeVal = -1; \n\n        }\n\n        So the first part is setting changeVal to 1 even if val == previous \u2192 which is wrong. \n\n        So the code's first condition needs to be changed. \n\n        The problem is in the first if condition's handling. \n\n        To fix that, the first condition's block should instead check whether the new is different. \n\n        So perhaps the code should be:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous) \u2192 oldB is 0. \n\n        if (val != previous \u2192 delta is +1 \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n        else \u2192 delta 0 \u2192 changeVal=0 \n\n        So the code should have:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous) {\n\n            if (val != previous) changeVal =1;\n\n            else changeVal=0; \n\n        } \n\n        But this is getting complicated. \n\n        Alternatively, the code can compute the changeVal as \n\n        changeVal = (val != previous) ? 1 :0 \n\n        - (oldVal != previous ? 1 :0 )\n\n        which is exactly deltaLeft. \n\n        So in code:\n\n        changeVal = ( (val != previous) ? 1 :0 ) - ( (oldVal != previous) ?1 :0 )\n\n        So:\n\n        var prev = _nums[index-1]; \n\n        changeVal = (val != prev ? 1 :0) - (oldVal != prev ?1 :0); \n\n        That would correctly compute deltaLeft. \n\n        So the code's current approach is not computing this delta correctly, and the user's task is to fill in the missing part where the code says // TODO: Your code here. \n\n        Looking back to the provided code's Query function:\n\n        The code for the index>0 part:\n\n        if (index > 0)\n\n        {\n\n            var changeVal = 0;\n\n            if (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n\n            {\n\n                changeVal = 1;\n\n            }\n\n            else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n            {\n\n                changeVal = -1;\n\n            }\n\n            _res += index * changeVal;\n\n        }\n\n        Wait wait, the first condition is checking whether the old value equal to previous? \n\n        Because before the update, the current element is _nums[index], so the old value is _nums[index]. \n\n        So the condition is \n\n        if (oldVal (which is _nums[index]) == _nums[index-1] \u2192 yes, that's correct. \n\n        So the first condition is:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous \u2192 oldB was 0. \n\n        The else if is val (new value) equals previous \u2192 so newB is 0 \u2192 delta is - oldB (which was 0 \u2192 so delta is -0? \n\n        Hmm. Let me see. \n\n        Let me re-express the code's logic. \n\n        In the index>0 case:\n\n        changeVal is initialized to 0. \n\n        Then:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous \u2192 oldB is 0 \u2192 \n\n        then check if new value (val) is not equal to previous \u2192 delta would be 1 \u2192 so changeVal is 1 \n\n        but the code's current first condition does not check that \u2192 it just sets changeVal to1. \n\n        So the code is wrong here. \n\n        So to fix this, the code's first condition's block should be:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous \u2192 then:\n\n            if (val != previous \u2192 then delta is +1 \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n            else \u2192 delta 0 \u2192 changeVal 0 \n\n        else \u2192 oldVal != previous \u2192 oldB was 1 \u2192 \n\n            if val == previous \u2192 delta is -1 \u2192 changeVal =-1 \n\n            else \u2192 delta 0 \u2192 changeVal 0 \n\n        So the code's first 'if' and 'else if' are incomplete because they don't check for val vs previous in the first case. \n\n        The current code's first condition is only checking the old's state, but not the new's. \n\n        So the missing code is in the first 'if' block. \n\n        The problem is in the first 'if' block:\n\n        The code has:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous \u2192 then changeVal =1 \n\n        but this is wrong unless val != previous. \n\n        So the correct code should have an additional check. \n\n        So in the first case (old was same as previous):\n\n            if (val != previous \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n            else \u2192 changeVal =0 \n\n        Thus, the code's current first part must include that condition. \n\n        The missing code is the part that does this. \n\n        In the code provided by the user, there is a 'TODO: Your code here' comment inside the else if block for the first condition. \n\n        Wait no, looking back: \n\n        The code's Query function's code for the index>0 case:\n\n        In the first part (if (index>0)), the code has:\n\n        var changeVal =0;\n\n        if (oldVal == previous) \u2192 then changeVal =1 \n\n        else if (val == previous) \u2192 changeVal =-1 \n\n        // else \u2192 changeVal remains 0 \n\n        So the first condition's block is setting changeVal=1 without checking whether the new value actually creates a new boundary. \n\n        The 'TODO: Your code here' is in the block where the val == previous (the else if part?), or somewhere else? \n\n        Wait looking back at the code's provided code:\n\n        class Segments\n\n        {\n\n            ...\n\n            public long Query(int index, int val)\n\n            {\n\n                if (_nums[index] == val) return _res;\n\n                if (index < _n-1)\n\n                {\n\n                    var changeVal =0;\n\n                    if (_nums[index] == _nums[index+1])\n\n                    {\n\n                        changeVal = 1;\n\n                    }\n\n                    else if (val == _nums[index+1])\n\n                    {\n\n                        changeVal = -1;\n\n                    }\n\n                    _res += (_n - index -1)* changeVal;\n\n                }\n\n                if (index >0)\n\n                {\n\n                    var changeVal =0;\n\n                    if (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n\n                    {\n\n                        changeVal =1;\n\n                    }\n\n                    else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n                    {\n\n                        /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n                    }\n\n                    _res += index * changeVal;\n\n                }\n\n                if (index < _n-1 && index >0)\n\n                {\n\n                    var changeVal =0;\n\n                    if (_nums[index] == _nums[index+1])\n\n                    {\n\n                        changeVal++;\n\n                    }\n\n                    else if (val == _nums[index+1])\n\n                    {\n\n                        changeVal--;\n\n                    }\n\n                    if (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n\n                    {\n\n                        changeVal++;\n\n                    }\n\n                    else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n                    {\n\n                        changeVal--;\n\n                    }\n\n                    _res += changeVal * (long)index * (_n - index -1);\n\n                }\n\n                _nums[index] = val;\n\n                return _res;\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        Wait, the original code's Query function has a 'TODO: Your code here' in the 'else if (val == ... )' part inside the index>0 block. \n\n        Looking at the code for index>0: \n\n        The block has:\n\n        if (oldVal (current before change) == previous \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n        else if (val == previous \u2192 changeVal =-1 \n\n        But then in the else if block, there is a 'TODO' comment. \n\n        Wait, perhaps the code's 'else if' is missing some cases. \n\n        The missing code is the part that sets changeVal to -1 in certain cases. \n\n        Wait, the code's current 'else if' for the first block is:\n\n        else if (val == previous \u2192 then changeVal is set to -1 \u2192 that is correct for the case where old was different from previous (so oldB was 1), and new is same \u2192 delta is -1 \u2192 so changeVal is -1. \n\n        But the first condition is incorrect because it sets changeVal to1 even if val == previous. \n\n        The 'TODO' is in the else if's block. \n\n        Wait, the code's first block (index>0):\n\n        The first 'if' block is for when oldVal == previous \u2192 oldB is 0. \n\n        Then, inside that block's 'TODO' is not there. \n\n        The 'TODO' is in the else if block's code (the val == previous case). \n\n        But perhaps the user left this code to be filled in. \n\n        Wait, the code in the else if is:\n\n        else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n        {\n\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n        }\n\n        So the current code's else if block has nothing. \n\n        So the code is missing the code for this block. \n\n        The correct code for this block should set changeVal to -1. \n\n        Because in this case, when val (new value) is equal to previous, we have newB is 0, but oldB was (oldVal != previous \u2192 because the first condition failed \u2192 oldVal != previous \u2192 so oldB was 1. \n\n        So delta is (0 -1) \u2192-1 \u2192 so changeVal should be -1. Which is exactly what the code is doing. \n\n        Wait no, the code inside the else if is empty, but the line 'changeVal =-1' is already done before the TODO comment?\n\n        Wait no, the code is written as:\n\n        else if (val == _nums[index-1])\n\n        {\n\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n        }\n\n        So the code currently has nothing inside the else if block. \n\n        So the user must fill in the missing line 'changeVal = -1;' \n\n        Ah, so the missing code is simply 'changeVal = -1;'\n\n        So that's the first thing to fix. \n\n        Then, the first 'if' block is incorrect because it sets changeVal to 1 even if val == previous. \n\n        So the first 'if' block also needs to be fixed. \n\n        Looking at the first 'if' block in the index>0 case:\n\n        if (_nums[index] == _nums[index-1])\n\n        {\n\n            changeVal =1;\n\n        }\n\n        This block is checking whether the old value (before the change) equals previous. \n\n        If so, then the oldB was 0. \n\n        Now, the new value is val. \n\n        The newB is whether val != previous. \n\n        changeVal should be (newB ?1 :0) - 0 \u2192 so it should be 1 only if val != previous. \n\n        So the current code is setting changeVal to 1 even if val is same as previous. \n\n        So this 'if' block is wrong. \n\n        The correct code should be:\n\n        if (_nums[index] == previous \u2192 oldB was 0. \n\n            if val != previous \u2192 changeVal +=1 \n\n            else \u2192 changeVal remains 0 \n\n        So in this case, the code's first 'if' block is setting changeVal to 1 regardless of val's value. \n\n        This is incorrect. \n\n        So the code should set changeVal to 1 only if val is different from previous. \n\n        To fix that, the first 'if' block should have:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous (== _nums[index-1])\n\n            if (val != previous \u2192 changeVal =1 \n\n            else \u2192 changeVal =0 \n\n        But how to do this in code? \n\n        The current code just sets changeVal to 1. \n\n        So the first 'if' block is wrong. \n\n        But given that the user's code has a 'TODO' only in the else if block, perhaps this is part of the problem's missing code?\n\n        Or perhaps the problem's existing code is correct except for the 'TODO' part. \n\n        Looking back at the note in the problem description: \n\n        The sample input after the first query is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n        So the initial array is different, but the first query changes the second element to 2, resulting in the array shown. \n\n        The sample sum is 29, which is computed manually. \n\n        So perhaps the code has other errors, but the missing part is the 'changeVal =-1' in the else if block. \n\n        The 'TODO' is in the else if block. \n\n        So the missing code is 'changeVal =-1;' \n\n        Thus, the user needs to fill that in. \n\n        Additionally, the first 'if' block might be incorrect, but perhaps the problem's existing code is written in a way that the first 'if' is correct, and the 'TODO' is the only missing part. \n\n        Looking at the code's first 'if' block in index>0:\n\n        if (oldVal == previous \u2192 then changeVal =1 \n\n        But that is incorrect. \n\n        However, perhaps the code's other parts compensate for this mistake. \n\n        Alternatively, maybe there's another error in the code. \n\n        Alternatively, perhaps the code's initial 'InitRes()' is incorrect, and we are to only fill in the missing line. \n\n        Since the user's instructions say to output only the missing code, which in this case is the 'changeVal =-1;' in the else if block. \n\n        Thus, the missing code is simply:\n\n        changeVal = -1;\n\n        So that's the line to fill in the TODO. \n\n        But wait, in the code's else if block (val == previous \u2192 which is the case where new_val is same as previous), the code is supposed to set changeVal to -1. \n\n        So the code inside the else if should be:\n\n        changeVal = -1;\n\n        Thus, the missing code is 'changeVal = -1;'\n\n        So the TODO block requires that line. \n\n        Therefore, the answer to this problem's missing code is to fill in that line. \n\n        Now, checking if other parts of the code have errors. \n\n        The code's third part (when both left and right boundaries are affected):\n\n        The code has:\n\n        if (index <n-1 && index >0)\n\n        {\n\n            var changeVal=0; \n\n            // check the right boundary \n\n            if (oldVal == next \u2192 old B was 0 \u2192 new B is (val != next \u2192 then changeVal +=1 \n\n            else if val == next \u2192 changeVal -=1 \n\n            similarly for left boundary. \n\n            // then, the code adds changeVal * (index)*(n-index-1) \n\n        } \n\n        This part seems to be trying to handle the cross terms between the left and right boundaries. \n\n        Perhaps this part is also incorrect, but since the problem's instructions say to output only the missing code, and the missing code is the 'changeVal =-1;' in the TODO, then that's sufficient. \n\n        Therefore, the missing code to fill in is 'changeVal =-1;'\n\n        So the final answer is that line. \n\n        But to confirm, let's check the sample input's first query. \n\n        For example, in the first query, changing the second element from whatever it was to 2. \n\n        But perhaps the code will handle it once the missing line is present. \n\n        So the conclusion is that the missing line is 'changeVal =-1;'"
