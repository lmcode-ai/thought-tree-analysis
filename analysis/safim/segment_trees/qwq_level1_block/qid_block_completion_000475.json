The problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key points are:\n\nAmShZ can send messages each day. Each message is either blocking a road (so Keshi can't use it) or telling Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he randomly chooses any reachable city (via non-blocked roads) from his current city and moves there.",

Looking at the code:\n\nThey have a map that for each city v, stores the list of u's (the destinations of roads from v). Also, there's an array 'num' which might be counting in-degrees? Not sure yet. Then, they initialize a priority queue with a Point(0, n). So starting from city n with distance 0. The 'd' array probably holds the minimal distance from n to each node? Wait, maybe it's the reverse. Because in Dijkstra's, you usually start from the source.",

So if there's a cycle that doesn't lead to n, then the strategy must block those edges leading into the cycle so that Keshi can't get stuck. Hmm, this complicates things. So perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as finding the longest path in the DAG formed by the edges that are part of some path from 1 to n. But even that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, the code provided is trying to compute the minimal number of days using a BFS-like approach. Let me look at the code again. The code initializes the queue with (0, n). Then, for each node pos, it processes its outgoing edges (since map.get(pos) gives the list of u's that pos points to). For each u in that list, perhaps they are trying to compute the distance for u as d[pos] + 1.",

The code uses a priority queue (min-heap), so it's finding the shortest path in terms of the distance stored. Wait, the initial distance for n is 0. Then, for each node pos, when processing, it looks at all outgoing edges (pos -> u). For each u, the distance for u would be d[pos] + 1.

So the total days would be the number of edges in the path (days when moving) plus the number of blocked edges (days when blocking). But that would be more than the path length. Hmm, this is conflicting with the initial thought. Wait, let's think again. Suppose the shortest path has length L. To force Keshi to take this path, AmShZ must block all other edges not on this path. Each blocked edge takes a day where AmShZ sends a block message. The number of edges not on the path is (m - L). But that could be very large. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because AmShZ can choose to not block any edges, and just tell Keshi to move each day.",

Hmm, this is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows AmShZ to block edges on the same days when Keshi is moving. Wait, each day is either a block or a move. So the total days is the number of moves plus the number of blocks. The strategy is to block edges that are not on the shortest path, but do so on days when you don't need to move. The minimal d is the number of moves (path length) plus the number of blocks needed. But that would be too large. Alternatively, perhaps the blocks can be done in parallel with the moves. For example, on day 1: block an edge not on the path. Day 2: move (first step of path). Day 3: block another edge. Day 4: move again. This way, the total days would be path length + number of blocked edges. But this is not efficient. Hmm, perhaps the key is that you don't need to block all edges not on the path. You just need to block edges that are on longer paths.",

In that case, the answer is the longest path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how to compute that in a general graph? The code provided uses Dijkstra's algorithm, which is for shortest paths. Hmm, perhaps the code is actually computing the longest path using a min-heap, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the code is using a reversed graph and finding the shortest path in terms of some other metric. Wait, let's think of the code's approach again. The code starts at node n with distance 0. For each node pos processed, it looks at all outgoing edges (pos -> u). For each such u, the distance for u is set to d[pos] + 1.",

This suggests that the problem's correct answer is the shortest path length. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The second sample's note says the answer is 2, which would be the shortest path length.

But in the code's current setup, the edges are stored as map.get(v) gives the list of u's that v points to. So for each edge v -> u, the code is processing v as pos, and the edge is to u. \n\nThus, the code should process each u in map.get(pos), and update the distance for u. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is: \n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n    if (d[ele] > d[pos] + 1) {\n        d[ele] = d[pos] + 1;\n        queue.add(new Point(d[ele], ele));\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, the initial code has the queue as a priority queue of Points. Also, the visit array is marked after extracting from the queue. This is standard Dijkstra's implementation. Therefore, the missing code is the above loop. So the final answer is to fill in that loop. I think that's the correct missing code.",

But the problem requires that they can ensure arrival in finite days. So such cycles must be blocked. Therefore, the graph must be treated as a DAG for the purpose of finding the longest path. Alternatively, the problem requires that the strategy must block all cycles that could lead to an infinite path. This is getting too complicated. Looking back at the code provided, it's using Dijkstra's algorithm starting from n.",

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the problem can be transformed into finding the minimal d where the maximum, over all paths from 1 to n, of (number of edges in path) is <=d. But since AmShZ can block edges, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal maximum path length after removing some edges. But how to choose which edges to block optimally?",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimal number of days d such that AmShZ and Keshi can guarantee to meet after at most d days. The key points are:\n\nAmShZ can send messages each day. Each message is either blocking a road (so Keshi can't use it) or telling Keshi to move. When Keshi moves, he randomly chooses any reachable city (via non-blocked roads) from his current city and moves there. The goal is to minimize the days needed to ensure Keshi reaches city n.\n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves some kind of BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm since we're dealing with paths and minimal steps. The code provided seems to be using a priority queue, which suggests Dijkstra's. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThey have a map that for each city v, stores the list of u's (the destinations of roads from v). Also, there's an array 'num' which might be counting in-degrees? Not sure yet.\n\nThen, they initialize a priority queue with a Point(0, n). So starting from city n with distance 0. The 'd' array probably holds the minimal distance from n to each node? Wait, maybe it's the reverse. Because in Dijkstra's, you usually start from the source. Here, the source in the code is n, so perhaps they are calculating the minimal steps required in reverse.\n\nWait the problem requires Keshi to go from 1 to n. But the code is starting from n. Maybe the idea is to model this as the reverse graph. Let me think: since AmShZ can choose which roads to block, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find the minimal number of steps such that, in the reverse direction, the path from n to 1 has certain properties. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into finding the longest path in some way. Because each day, when AmShZ tells Keshi to move, he must choose a path that leads towards n as quickly as possible. But since Keshi chooses randomly, the worst case scenario must be considered. So the minimal d must be the maximum over all possible paths of some measure?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be modeled as a game where each edge can be blocked, and the players want to minimize the days. The key is to find the minimal d such that no matter how the roads are blocked, Keshi can reach n in d days. Wait, no, the problem says that AmShZ can choose which roads to block each day, but he can also choose when to tell Keshi to move. So they can coordinate optimally to minimize the days. So the strategy is to choose the best sequence of messages (block or move) to get Keshi to n as quickly as possible, regardless of the road choices Keshi makes when moving.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n in some transformed graph. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem requires that after at most d days, they can ensure that Keshi arrives at n. So the strategy must work no matter how Keshi chooses his path when moving. So the worst-case scenario must be considered. \n\nLet me think of each day as either blocking a road or moving. Each move day allows Keshi to move along any available outgoing edge. The key is to find the minimal number of days where, through optimal blocking and moving, Keshi can be forced to reach n in d days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the minimal number of steps required in the worst case, where each step can be a move or a block. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's model this as a game where each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road (thereby removing it from the graph) or let Keshi move. The goal is to reach n in as few days as possible. The minimal d is the minimal number of days required such that there exists a strategy (sequence of blocks and moves) that guarantees Keshi reaches n in d days, regardless of Keshi's choices when moving (since he picks randomly, but we have to account for the worst case).\n\nWait, but when Keshi moves, he can choose any outgoing edge. So to guarantee that he reaches n, the path must be such that no matter which edges he takes (as long as they are available), he can reach n within the days. So the strategy must ensure that, through blocking certain roads, the remaining paths are such that Keshi can't avoid going towards n.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of steps in a DAG where each edge's contribution is considered. Alternatively, the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n in the original graph. Because in the worst case, Keshi might take the longest path, so you need to block edges to shorten that path. Wait, but how does blocking edges help?\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be thought of as a two-player game where AmShZ wants to minimize the days, and Keshi (when moving) might take the longest possible path. So the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length at most d, and all other paths can be blocked in d days. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal number of edges on the longest path from 1 to n. Because each day you can either block an edge or move. Wait, but each move can take Keshi along any available edge. So if the longest path has length L, then in the worst case, Keshi might take that path, requiring L moves. But each move takes a day, but you can also block edges on other days. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, the problem says that each day, AmShZ can choose between two options: block a road (so Keshi stays) or tell Keshi to move (so he moves along one of the available edges). The total days must be at most d, and they want the minimal d such that no matter what Keshi does when moving (i.e., choosing edges), they can ensure that after d days, Keshi is at n.\n\nSo the strategy must involve choosing when to block roads and when to move so that, regardless of Keshi's choices during moves, he ends up at n within d days.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to model this as a BFS where each state is the current city and the set of blocked roads, but that's probably infeasible given the constraints (n and m up to 2e5).\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think in reverse. Let's model the problem as trying to reach from n to 1, but in reverse. Because each time Keshi moves, he can choose any outgoing edge, so in reverse, the minimal steps would be the maximum number of choices he has to make. Wait, maybe the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because in the worst case, Keshi takes the longest path, so you need to have enough days to cover that path. But how does blocking help?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length at most d, and all other paths can be blocked in the remaining days. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the problem as follows: Each day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road (so that Keshi can't use it) or let Keshi move. The goal is to get Keshi to n as quickly as possible. The key is that when you tell Keshi to move, he can choose any outgoing edge (so you have to account for the worst case, i.e., he might choose the path that takes the longest). Therefore, the minimal d must be the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because in the worst case, Keshi takes the longest path, and each move takes a day. But how do the blocks help here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal number of edges on the longest path from 1 to n. Because each move along an edge takes a day, so the longest path's length is the minimal d required. But then why would blocking roads help? Because maybe you can block some edges to make the path shorter. Wait, but the problem requires that the strategy must work regardless of Keshi's choices. So if there's a path longer than the minimal d, then Keshi could take that path, so you have to block those paths.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as the minimal number of days required such that, in the graph, the distance from 1 to n in the reversed graph (with some edges blocked) is at most d, and the number of blocked edges plus the path length is <=d. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be transformed into finding the minimal d where the maximum, over all paths from 1 to n, of (number of edges in path) is <=d. But since AmShZ can block edges, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal maximum path length after removing some edges. But how to choose which edges to block optimally?\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length at most d, and all other paths can be blocked in the remaining days. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of days d such that the length of the longest path from 1 to n is at most d. Because in the worst case, Keshi takes the longest path, so you need d to be at least that. But how can you ensure that you can block other paths? Or maybe the problem is exactly the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because each edge in the path takes a day when moving, so the number of moves needed is the path length, and each move takes a day. So the minimal d is the length of the longest path. But how does blocking help here?\n\nWait, maybe the blocking allows you to reduce the path length. For example, if there's a long path but a shorter one, you can block the long path's edges so that Keshi is forced to take the shorter path. But since Keshi chooses randomly, but we have to account for the worst case, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal possible maximum path length after optimally blocking edges. But how do you model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal d such that in the graph, the minimal number of edges on any path from 1 to n is at most d. But that's the shortest path, which can't be right because the problem requires the worst case.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me look at the code provided. The code is using a priority queue and seems to be doing a Dijkstra-like approach starting from node n. The 'd' array is storing some distance. The initial queue has (0, n). The code is processing nodes in the queue, and for each node's edges (from the map which is v -> list of u's?), perhaps they are processing in reverse.\n\nWait, the map is built as for each v, the list of u's where there is an edge from v to u. So when the code is processing node pos (starting from n), and looking at map.get(pos), which would be the list of u's that v=pos has edges to. Wait, no, the edges are stored as for each v, the edges from v to u. So the map is for outgoing edges from v. So when processing node pos (starting at n), the edges from pos are the outgoing edges. But in the code's current setup, perhaps they are trying to compute something in reverse.\n\nWait, maybe the code is trying to compute the minimal number of steps required in reverse. Let me think: the code starts at n, and for each node, it's trying to find the minimal distance such that from that node to n, the required days are d. \n\nThe idea might be that for each node u, the minimal d required to reach n from u is the minimal between the current d and 1 + the minimal d of the next nodes. But since each move can take you to any outgoing edge, but you can choose to block edges to minimize the required days.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is modeled as follows: For each node u, the minimal number of days required to get from u to n is the minimal between (1 + the minimal days of any outgoing edge's destination) or something else. Wait, maybe the d array here represents the minimal number of days required to reach n from that node. \n\nLet me think of the algorithm in the code. The code initializes the queue with (0, n). Then, for each node processed, it looks at its outgoing edges (since the map is v -> list of u's, so for node pos, the edges are from pos to u). Then, for each u in the list, perhaps they are trying to compute the minimal d for u based on the current d of pos. \n\nWait, the code's current setup is:\n\nqueue.add(new Point(0, n)); // starting at n with distance 0.\n\nThen, for each node pos in the queue, when processing, it looks at the edges from pos (since map.get(pos) gives the list of u's that pos points to). For each u in that list, perhaps they are trying to compute the distance for u as d[pos] + 1? Because moving from u to pos would take one day? Wait, but the direction is reversed here.\n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute for each node u, the minimal number of days required to reach n from u. So, for example, if from u there is a direct edge to n, then the distance for u would be 1 (since you can move there in one day). But if there are multiple paths, you choose the minimal one. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the priority queue is a min-heap. So Dijkstra's algorithm is typically used for finding shortest paths. So perhaps the d array here is storing the minimal number of days required to reach n from each node. \n\nIf that's the case, then the answer would be d[1], which is the minimal days required from node 1 to reach n. But how does that account for blocking roads?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the longest path in the graph, but since the graph can have cycles, that's not possible unless it's a DAG. Wait, but the problem states that there is at least one path from 1 to n, but there could be cycles. So the longest path might be infinite, but the problem requires that the path must eventually reach n. So perhaps the graph is a DAG? No, the problem doesn't say that.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that they can ensure that Keshi will reach n in at most d days. So even if there are cycles, the strategy must involve blocking roads that lead into cycles so that Keshi can't get stuck. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as the longest path from 1 to n in the graph, but since cycles can exist, this is tricky. However, since the problem requires that there exists a path, perhaps the graph is considered as a DAG when considering paths from 1 to n. Or maybe the problem can be transformed into a DAG by considering the reverse graph and finding the shortest path in terms of some criteria.\n\nAlternatively, the code's approach is to compute for each node u, the minimal number of days required to reach n from u. The way this is done is by starting from n (distance 0) and for each node, considering all incoming edges (since the edges in the map are outgoing from the node). Wait, no, the edges stored in the map are outgoing edges from the node. So for node u, the edges stored in map.get(u) are the destinations of edges from u. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing the reverse graph. Let me think: To compute the minimal days from u to n, we can model it as the minimal steps in the reverse direction. For example, if there is an edge from u to v, then in the reverse graph, it's from v to u. But the code is using the original edges. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute for each node u, the minimal number of days required to reach n from u. The idea is that each time you can choose to move along an edge, which takes one day, or block edges. But how does blocking factor into this?\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that the minimal d required is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because in the worst case, Keshi takes the longest possible path, and each edge in that path requires a day. So the minimal d must be at least the length of the longest path. But how can you ensure that you can block other paths to make sure that Keshi can't take longer paths?\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length at most d, and all other paths can be blocked in the remaining days. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as follows: Each day, you can either block a road (which doesn't cost a day towards Keshi's progress) or let Keshi move (which takes a day and moves him along an edge). The goal is to choose when to block and when to move so that Keshi reaches n in as few days as possible. The minimal d is the minimal number of days required, considering that you can block roads optimally.\n\nIn this case, the optimal strategy would be to let Keshi move along the shortest possible path, but since he can choose any outgoing edge, you have to account for the worst case. So the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because in the worst case, Keshi takes the longest path, and you can't block those edges because you need to let him move each day. Wait, but you can block edges on days when you don't let him move. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because each edge in that path must be traversed by Keshi, taking one day each. So the number of days needed is exactly the length of the path. Since you can't make him move faster than that, the minimal d must be the length of the longest path. \n\nBut how do you ensure that you can block other paths so that he can't take a longer path? Wait, if there's a longer path, then the minimal d must be at least the length of that path. So the minimal d is the maximum path length from 1 to n. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the length of the longest path from 1 to n. But since the graph can have cycles, the longest path could be infinite. However, the problem states that there is at least one path from 1 to n, so perhaps the graph is such that all paths eventually reach n, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that they can ensure that Keshi will reach n in at most d days. So if there's a cycle that doesn't lead to n, then the strategy must block those edges leading into the cycle so that Keshi can't get stuck. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. So perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as finding the longest path in the DAG formed by the edges that are part of some path from 1 to n. But even that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the code provided is trying to compute the minimal number of days using a BFS-like approach. Let me look at the code again. The code initializes the queue with (0, n). Then, for each node pos, it processes its outgoing edges (since map.get(pos) gives the list of u's that pos points to). For each u in that list, perhaps they are trying to compute the distance for u as d[pos] + 1. \n\nWait, if the code is doing something like BFS from n, then the distance array would represent the minimal number of steps from u to n. For example, if there's an edge from u to pos (since pos is the current node being processed), then the distance for u would be d[pos] + 1. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the edges stored in the map are outgoing from pos. So for each u in map.get(pos), there is an edge from pos to u. So the edge is pos -> u. \n\nWait, but if we are processing in reverse, then to compute the distance from u to n, perhaps we need to look at incoming edges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the minimal number of days required to reach n from each node. The idea is that for each node u, the minimal days would be 1 plus the minimal days of any of its outgoing edges. Because when you are at u, you can choose to move to any of its outgoing edges, and the minimal days would be the minimal among those. \n\nWait, but in that case, the minimal days would be the shortest path from u to n. But the problem requires the longest path? \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code's approach. Let me think again. The code uses a priority queue (min-heap), so it's finding the shortest path in terms of the distance stored. \n\nWait, the initial distance for n is 0. Then, for each node pos, when processing, it looks at all outgoing edges (pos -> u). For each u, the distance for u would be d[pos] + 1. Because moving from u to pos would take one day, but that's not the direction. Wait, perhaps the direction is reversed. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute for each node u, the minimal number of days required to reach n from u. To do this, for each edge from u to v, the minimal days for u would be 1 plus the minimal days of v. Because if you can go from u to v, then the minimal days from u is 1 (the day you move to v) plus the days from v to n. \n\nAh! That makes sense. So the distance for u is 1 + min over all its outgoing edges' distances. \n\nWait, but in that case, the minimal days would be the minimal path length from u to n. Because you choose the path with the least steps. But the problem requires the worst case, so perhaps it's the maximum over all possible paths? \n\nWait, no. The problem requires that AmShZ can choose when to block roads so that Keshi is forced to take a path that reaches n in d days. So the minimal d is the minimal possible maximum over all paths' lengths after optimally blocking edges. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that regardless of Keshi's choices (i.e., he might choose the longest possible path), the days must be sufficient. So the minimal d must be the length of the longest path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how does the code's approach relate to this?\n\nThe code's current approach is using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the minimal distance from each node to n. But if the distance is computed as the minimal steps, then that would give the shortest path. But the problem requires the longest path. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is actually trying to compute the longest path, but using a priority queue in a way that it's a max-heap. Wait, the code's queue is a priority queue with comparator (o1.dis - o2.dis), which is a min-heap. So it's processing nodes in order of increasing distance. That's typical for Dijkstra's to find shortest paths. \n\nSo if the code is trying to compute the shortest path from each node to n, then the answer would be the shortest path from 1 to n. But that can't be right because the sample input might have a different answer. \n\nWait, looking at the first sample note: \"In the first sample, it's enough for AmShZ to send the second type of message (move) once. So the answer is 1.\" \n\nSuppose the first sample has a direct path from 1 to n. Then the shortest path length is 1, which matches the sample. \n\nThe second sample's note says that blocking a road and then moving gives a total of 2 days. So the minimal d is 2. \n\nIf the second sample's graph has a path of length 2, then the code's approach would return 2, which is correct. \n\nSo perhaps the code is correct in that the minimal d is the shortest path length from 1 to n. But why?\n\nWait, the problem requires that AmShZ can choose to block roads to force Keshi to take the shortest path. So the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because AmShZ can block all other paths, so that Keshi has no choice but to take the shortest path. \n\nAh! That makes sense. Because each day, AmShZ can choose to block roads that are not on the shortest path. So the strategy is to block all other edges except those on a shortest path. Then, Keshi has to take that path, which takes exactly the number of days equal to the path length. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d is the length of the shortest path from 1 to n. \n\nWait, but the problem says that when Keshi moves, he chooses any reachable city. So if there are multiple outgoing edges, he can choose any. So to ensure that he takes the shortest path, AmShZ must block all other edges. \n\nEach blocking takes a day where Keshi stays. So the total days would be the number of edges in the path (days when moving) plus the number of blocked edges (days when blocking). But that would be more than the path length. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting with the initial thought. \n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose the shortest path has length L. To force Keshi to take this path, AmShZ must block all other edges not on this path. Each blocked edge takes a day where AmShZ sends a block message. The number of edges not on the path is (m - L). But that could be very large. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because AmShZ can choose to not block any edges, and just tell Keshi to move each day. If the shortest path is L, then in the best case, Keshi takes that path in L days. But the problem requires that they can ensure that they will see each other after at most d days, regardless of Keshi's choices. So the worst case must be considered. \n\nAh! Right. The problem requires that no matter how Keshi chooses his path (when moving), he must reach n within d days. So the minimal d must be the maximum possible minimal path length over all possible paths. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal d must be the maximum, over all possible paths from 1 to n, of the path length. Because in the worst case, Keshi takes the longest path. So the minimal d must be the length of the longest path. \n\nBut how can AmShZ ensure that Keshi doesn't take a longer path? By blocking edges that are not on some path of length at most d. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe key is that AmShZ can choose to block roads on days when he doesn't let Keshi move. So the strategy is to block roads that are not on a path of length at most d, thereby forcing Keshi to take a path of length at most d. \n\nThe minimal d is the smallest number such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length d, and all other paths can be blocked in the remaining days. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal d is the minimal number such that the longest path from 1 to n after removing some edges (those blocked) has length at most d, and the number of edges removed plus the path length is <=d. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is the minimal number where the longest path in the graph is at most d. Because AmShZ can block edges to make sure that all paths are of length at most d. \n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal d such that the graph has a path from 1 to n of length at most d, and for every other path, there exists a way to block edges not on this path so that the path is blocked. \n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal d such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length d, and all other paths have at least one edge not on this path, which can be blocked. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as a two-player game where AmShZ wants to minimize the days, and Keshi (when moving) chooses the path that maximizes the days. The minimal d is the minimal maximum over all possible paths' lengths. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because in the worst case, Keshi takes that path, and you can't block it because you have to let him move each day. \n\nBut then, how do you ensure that you can block other paths? \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that you can choose to block edges not on the path Keshi is taking, but since you don't know his path in advance, you have to block edges in such a way that no matter which path he takes, it's length is at most d. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d is the minimal possible maximum path length after optimally removing edges. \n\nThe minimal such d is the minimal possible maximum path length over all possible edge subsets that still allow a path from 1 to n. \n\nThis sounds like the problem of finding the minimal possible longest path in a spanning tree or something. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length d, and all other paths can be blocked by removing edges not on this path. \n\nIn that case, the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because you can choose the shortest path, and block all other edges. The number of days needed would be the path length (since each move takes a day) plus the number of blocked edges (each block takes a day). But that would be more than the path length. \n\nHmm, this is getting me confused. Let me look back at the code provided. \n\nThe code is using Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node n, and for each node, it's considering the edges from that node. The distance array d is being computed as the minimal distance from the node to n. \n\nWait, if the code is computing the shortest path from each node to n, then the answer would be the shortest path from 1 to n. \n\nBut according to the first sample note, that's correct. \n\nThe second sample's note says that the answer is 2. Suppose the shortest path is 2, then that also works. \n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is indeed the shortest path length. \n\nBut why? \n\nBecause AmShZ can choose to block all other edges not on the shortest path. Each block takes a day, but the total days would be the number of edges in the path (days when moving) plus the number of blocked edges (days when blocking). \n\nWait, but that would be more than the path length. \n\nWait, but the problem allows AmShZ to choose between blocking or moving each day. So the total days is the number of days you spend moving plus the number of days you spend blocking. \n\nThe strategy would be to first block all edges not on the shortest path, and then tell Keshi to move along the path. \n\nBut how many days does that take?\n\nSuppose the shortest path has length L. The number of edges not on the path is (m - L). To block all of them, you need (m - L) days. Then, moving along the path takes L days. So total days would be (m - L) + L = m days, which is way too big. \n\nHmm, that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocking can be done in parallel with moving. \n\nWait, each day, you can choose to either block a road or move. So the total days is the maximum between the number of blocks needed and the path length. \n\nWait, no. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose the shortest path is of length 2, and there are other edges. \n\nDay 1: block an edge not on the path. \n\nDay 2: block another edge. \n\nDay 3: tell Keshi to move (he moves along the first edge of the path). \n\nDay 4: tell him to move again (second edge). \n\nTotal days: 4. But the path length is 2. \n\nBut the problem requires the minimal d such that they can ensure arrival in at most d days. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocking can be done on days when Keshi is moving. \n\nWait, no. Each day is either a block or a move. \n\nSo the optimal strategy is to alternate between blocking and moving? \n\nAlternatively, the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. Because AmShZ can choose to not block any edges, and just tell Keshi to move each day. In the best case, Keshi takes the shortest path in L days. But the problem requires that they can ensure that they will see each other after at most d days, regardless of Keshi's choices. \n\nAh! Here's the key: the problem requires that no matter how Keshi chooses his path (when moving), he must reach n within d days. So the worst-case scenario must be considered. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d must be the length of the longest possible path that Keshi could take. \n\nBut how can AmShZ ensure that Keshi can't take a longer path? \n\nAh! By blocking edges that are not on any path of length at most d. \n\nSo the minimal d is the minimal value such that there exists a set of edges to block so that all remaining paths from 1 to n have length at most d. \n\nThe minimal such d is the minimal possible maximum path length after removing some edges. \n\nThe minimal d is the minimal possible maximum path length over all possible edge subsets that still allow a path from 1 to n. \n\nThis sounds like the problem of finding the minimal possible longest path in a subgraph that still has a path from 1 to n. \n\nTo find this, we can model it as finding the shortest path in the reverse graph where edges are weighted by 1, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as finding the minimal d such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length d, and every other path has at least one edge not on this path, which can be blocked. \n\nThe minimal such d is the length of the shortest path. Because you can choose the shortest path, and block all other edges. \n\nWait, but blocking all other edges would take m-L days, but the total days would be the path length plus the number of blocked edges. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows AmShZ to block edges on the same days when Keshi is moving. \n\nWait, each day is either a block or a move. So the total days is the number of moves plus the number of blocks. \n\nThe strategy is to block edges that are not on the shortest path, but do so on days when you don't need to move. \n\nThe minimal d is the number of moves (path length) plus the number of blocks needed. \n\nBut that would be too large. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks can be done in parallel with the moves. \n\nFor example, on day 1: block an edge not on the path. \n\nDay 2: move (first step of path). \n\nDay 3: block another edge. \n\nDay 4: move again. \n\nThis way, the total days would be path length + number of blocked edges. \n\nBut this is not efficient. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that you don't need to block all edges not on the path. You just need to block edges that are on longer paths. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. Because even if you block other edges, Keshi could still take that longest path. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d must be the length of the longest path. \n\nBut how to compute the longest path in a general graph with possible cycles? \n\nThat's impossible unless the graph is a DAG. \n\nThe problem states that there is at least one path from 1 to n, but there could be cycles. \n\nWait, but if there's a cycle that can be entered from 1 and exited to n, then the longest path could be infinite. But the problem requires that they can ensure arrival in finite days. So such cycles must be blocked. \n\nTherefore, the graph must be treated as a DAG for the purpose of finding the longest path. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the strategy must block all cycles that could lead to an infinite path. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nLooking back at the code provided, it's using Dijkstra's algorithm starting from n. The distance array is computed as the minimal distance from each node to n. \n\nIf this is the case, then the answer is the shortest path from 1 to n. \n\nThe first sample's answer is 1, which matches. \n\nThe second sample's note says the answer is 2. Suppose the shortest path is 2, then that also matches. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the shortest path from 1 to n, and that is the answer. \n\nBut why does that work? \n\nBecause AmShZ can choose to not block any edges, and just tell Keshi to move each day. In the best case, Keshi takes the shortest path in L days. But the problem requires that they can ensure that they will see each other after at most d days, regardless of Keshi's choices. \n\nAh! Wait, the problem says that AmShZ can choose which roads to block. So he can block all other paths except the shortest path. \n\nBy doing so, Keshi has no choice but to take the shortest path. \n\nThe number of days needed would be the length of the shortest path (since each move takes a day), plus the number of blocked edges (each block takes a day). \n\nBut that would be more than the path length. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the blocks can be done on the same days as the moves. \n\nFor example, to block an edge, you spend a day not moving. But the total days would be the path length plus the number of blocked edges. \n\nBut that's not efficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks are not needed. Because if you don't block any edges, then Keshi might take a longer path. \n\nBut the problem requires that they can ensure that they will see each other after at most d days. So the minimal d must be the maximum possible path length that Keshi could take, even if you don't block any edges. \n\nIn that case, the answer is the longest path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how to compute that in a general graph? \n\nThe code provided uses Dijkstra's algorithm, which is for shortest paths. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is actually computing the longest path using a min-heap, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the code is using a reversed graph and finding the shortest path in terms of some other metric. \n\nWait, let's think of the code's approach again. \n\nThe code starts at node n with distance 0. For each node pos processed, it looks at all outgoing edges (pos -> u). For each such u, the distance for u is set to d[pos] + 1. \n\nWait, that would mean that the distance from u to n is 1 more than the distance from pos to n. \n\nSo the distance array represents the shortest path from the node to n. \n\nFor example, if there's an edge from u to pos, then the shortest path from u to n is 1 (to pos) plus the path from pos to n. \n\nSo the code is indeed computing the shortest path from each node to n. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the shortest path from 1 to n. \n\nBut why does that solve the problem? \n\nBecause AmShZ can choose to not block any edges, and just tell Keshi to move each day. In the best case, Keshi takes the shortest path in L days. But the problem requires that they can ensure that they will see each other after at most d days, regardless of Keshi's choices. \n\nAh! Wait, the problem says that AmShZ can choose which roads to block. So he can block all other paths except the shortest path. \n\nBy doing so, Keshi has no choice but to take the shortest path. \n\nThe number of days needed would be the length of the shortest path (since each move takes a day), plus the number of blocked edges (each block takes a day). \n\nBut the problem requires the minimal d such that they can ensure arrival in at most d days. \n\nSo the total days would be the path length plus the number of blocked edges. \n\nBut that's not optimal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks can be done on the same days as the moves. \n\nWait, each day is either a block or a move. \n\nSuppose the shortest path has length L. \n\nTo block all edges not on this path, you need to spend (m - L) days blocking. \n\nThen, you spend L days moving. \n\nTotal days: (m-L) + L = m. \n\nBut that's way too big. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. \n\nBecause AmShZ can choose to not block any edges, and just tell Keshi to move each day. \n\nIn the worst case, Keshi might take a longer path, but the problem requires that they can ensure arrival in d days. \n\nWait, no. The problem requires that they can ensure that they will see each other after at most d days. So the strategy must work no matter what path Keshi takes. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d must be the maximum possible path length that Keshi could take, even if you don't block any edges. \n\nThus, the answer is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how to compute that in a general graph? \n\nThe code provided uses Dijkstra's algorithm, which computes shortest paths. \n\nThis suggests that the problem's correct answer is the shortest path length. \n\nPerhaps I misunderstood the problem. \n\nLet me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says that AmShZ can choose to block roads or tell Keshi to move each day. \n\nThe goal is to find the minimal d such that after at most d days, they can ensure that Keshi reaches n. \n\nThe key is that AmShZ can choose the optimal sequence of blocks and moves to force Keshi to reach n in d days. \n\nThe strategy can involve blocking certain roads to eliminate longer paths, thereby forcing Keshi to take a shorter path. \n\nThe minimal d is the minimal number of days required to do this optimally. \n\nThe key insight is that each day you can either block a road or move. \n\nThe optimal strategy is to block roads that are not on a shortest path, thereby forcing Keshi to take the shortest path. \n\nThe number of days needed is the length of the shortest path, because you can block all other edges in parallel with moving. \n\nWait, how? \n\nSuppose the shortest path has length L. \n\nEach day, you can choose to either block an edge not on the path or move. \n\nThe strategy is: \n\nOn days 1 to L: tell Keshi to move. \n\nDuring these days, Keshi must move along the shortest path. \n\nBut how to ensure that? \n\nBy blocking all other edges not on the path before he can choose them. \n\nBut you can't block all edges in L days. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal d is the length of the shortest path. \n\nBecause AmShZ can choose to not block any edges, and just tell Keshi to move each day. \n\nIn the best case, Keshi takes the shortest path in L days. \n\nBut the problem requires that they can ensure that they will see each other after at most d days. \n\nAh! The problem says \"make sure that they will see each other after at most d days\". \n\nSo the strategy must guarantee that no matter what Keshi does (i.e., chooses any path), he will reach n within d days. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d is the minimal number such that there exists a path from 1 to n of length at most d, and all other paths have length at most d. \n\nThus, the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how to compute that in a general graph? \n\nThe problem states that there is at least one path from 1 to n. \n\nIf the graph has cycles, then the longest path could be infinite. \n\nBut the problem requires that the answer is finite. \n\nTherefore, the graph must be such that all paths eventually reach n. \n\nBut the problem doesn't state that. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nPerhaps the problem assumes that the graph is a DAG. \n\nBut the problem statement doesn't say that. \n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that the minimal d is the length of the longest path from 1 to n in the graph. \n\nBut how to compute that? \n\nIn a general graph with cycles, this is impossible. \n\nTherefore, the problem must have some other approach. \n\nLooking back at the code, the code is using Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from each node to n. \n\nThe answer is d[1], which is the shortest path from 1 to n. \n\nPerhaps the problem's correct answer is indeed the shortest path length. \n\nThe reasoning is that AmShZ can choose to block all other paths except the shortest path. \n\nThe number of days needed is the length of the shortest path, because each move takes a day, and the blocks can be done on the same days as the moves. \n\nWait, how? \n\nSuppose the shortest path has length L. \n\nEach day, AmShZ can choose to either block a road or move. \n\nThe strategy is to alternate between blocking and moving. \n\nBut this would take more days. \n\nAlternatively, the blocks are not needed because the shortest path is the only path available. \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the problem allows AmShZ to block roads on the same days when Keshi is moving. \n\nNo, each day is either a block or a move. \n\nAh! Here's the key: \n\nThe minimal d is the length of the shortest path. \n\nBecause AmShZ can choose to not block any roads, and just tell Keshi to move each day. \n\nIn the worst case, Keshi might take a longer path, but the problem requires that they can ensure arrival in d days. \n\nWait, no. The problem requires that they can ensure that they will see each other after at most d days. \n\nSo the strategy must work no matter what path Keshi takes. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d must be the maximum possible path length that Keshi could take. \n\nBut how to ensure that this maximum is minimized? \n\nThe minimal possible maximum is the length of the shortest path. \n\nBecause if you can force Keshi to take the shortest path, then the maximum is the shortest path length. \n\nTo force this, AmShZ can block all other edges not on the shortest path. \n\nThe number of days needed is the number of edges not on the path (to block) plus the path length (to move). \n\nBut this is larger than the path length. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nPerhaps the problem's correct answer is indeed the shortest path length. \n\nThe code's approach computes the shortest path from 1 to n, and that is the answer. \n\nThe first sample's answer is 1, which matches. \n\nThe second sample's note says the answer is 2, which would be the shortest path length. \n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with the assumption that the code is correct and the answer is the shortest path length. \n\nNow, looking at the code's incomplete part: \n\nIn the loop over the edges of pos (map.get(pos)), the code has a comment /* TODO: Your code here */. \n\nThe current code is processing each edge from pos to u. \n\nThe idea is that the distance for u is the distance of pos plus 1. \n\nBut since we're using a priority queue (Dijkstra's), we need to relax the edges. \n\nThe code should add a new point for u with distance dis + 1. \n\nWait, the current node is pos, which has distance dis. \n\nFor each u in map.get(pos), which is an outgoing edge from pos to u. \n\nThe distance from u to n would be dis + 1? \n\nWait, no. Because if you can go from pos to n in dis days, then from u to pos takes one day, so from u to n would be dis + 1 days. \n\nYes. \n\nSo for each u in the outgoing edges of pos, the distance for u is d[pos] + 1. \n\nTherefore, the code should do: \n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n    if (d[ele] > d[pos] + 1) {\n        d[ele] = d[pos] + 1;\n        queue.add(new Point(d[ele], ele));\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the current code's queue is a priority queue sorted by dis. \n\nWait, the code's queue is a priority queue of Points sorted by dis. \n\nThe initial code has the queue as a priority queue with comparator (o1.dis - o2.dis), so it's a min-heap. \n\nThe algorithm is Dijkstra's to find the shortest path from n to each node. \n\nSo for each edge from pos to u, the distance to u is d[pos] + 1. \n\nTherefore, the code should process each u in map.get(pos), and update d[u] if it can be improved. \n\nThe current code's loop is inside the processing of pos. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n    if (d[ele] > d[pos] + 1) {\n        d[ele] = d[pos] + 1;\n        queue.add(new Point(d[ele], ele));\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, the edges are stored as map.get(v) gives the list of u's that v points to. \n\nSo for each edge v -> u, the code is processing v as pos, and the edge is to u. \n\nThe distance from u to n would be d[v] + 1. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, the distance array d is the distance from the node to n. \n\nSo for node v, d[v] is the distance from v to n. \n\nThe edge v -> u means that from u, you can go to v, then to n. \n\nSo the distance from u to n is d[v] + 1. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, for each u in the outgoing edges of v (pos), the distance for u is d[v] + 1. \n\nSo the code should update d[u] accordingly. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is as I wrote above. \n\nBut in the code's current setup, the edges are stored as map.get(v) gives the list of u's that v points to. \n\nSo for each edge v -> u, the code is processing v as pos, and the edge is to u. \n\nThus, the code should process each u in map.get(pos), and update the distance for u. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is: \n\nfor (int ele : map.get(pos)) {\n    if (d[ele] > d[pos] + 1) {\n        d[ele] = d[pos] + 1;\n        queue.add(new Point(d[ele], ele));\n    }\n}\n\nBut wait, the initial code has the queue as a priority queue of Points. \n\nAlso, the visit array is marked after extracting from the queue. \n\nThis is standard Dijkstra's implementation. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the above loop. \n\nSo the final answer is to fill in that loop. \n\nI think that's the correct missing code."
