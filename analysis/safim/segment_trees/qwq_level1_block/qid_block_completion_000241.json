So to minimize the total, you want to exclude as few as possible, and those with the smallest a_i. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose you have two members: one with a_i=5 and another with a_j=10. If you can exclude one, you should exclude the one with a_i=10, because that way the unhappiness is 10, whereas excluding the 5 would give 5. So to minimize the total, you exclude the highest a_i. Ah right! So to minimize the unhappiness, you should exclude the members with the highest a_i. Therefore, the base solution is to include all members except the ones with the highest a_i. But how many to exclude?",

Alternatively, the minimal cost is to exclude one node with odd degree, which costs a_x. Because excluding such a node changes the parity from odd to even. Wait, let's see:\n\nOriginal edge count is E (odd). Excluding x with degree c (odd):\n\nThe new edge count is E - (number of edges incident to x in the original subset). Wait, the edges incident to x are exactly c edges. So the new edge count is E - c. Since c is odd, E - c is even. Yes! So excluding a node with odd degree will flip the parity. Therefore, the minimal cost is the minimal a_x among all nodes with odd degree. Because excluding that node will make the edge count even, and the cost is a_x.",

So it's even. So the unhappiness should be zero. But the note says the minimal is 2. This suggests that the second test case's a array must have a1=2, a2=0, a3=0. Then, inviting everyone would give unhappiness zero. But the note says the minimal is 2. Hmm, this is conflicting. Wait, perhaps the note's second test case has m=1. Let me re-read the note's example:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 1 and 2 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 3); invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2); invite only 1 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 4); invite only 2 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 5); invite only 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 3); invite nobody (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 6). The minimum unhappiness value is achieved by inviting 2 and 3.\"",

So the answer is 2. This fits the note's example. So the algorithm I thought of earlier is correct. The steps are:\n\n- Compute the total number of edges in the entire graph. - If even \u2192 answer is 0 (inviting everyone). - Else \u2192 find all nodes with odd degree. The minimal a_i among them is the answer. Because excluding that node will make the edge count even. In the second test case, the friend is between 1 and 2. The degrees are:\n\nNode 1 has degree 1 (odd). Node 2 has degree 1 (odd). Node 3 has degree 0 (even). The minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree is min(3,2) \u2192 2. Which matches the example. The first test case has even edges \u2192 answer 0. The third test case's note says that inviting members 3,4,5 gives a valid party. Assuming the edges form a graph where the total edges is even. So the algorithm works. Therefore, the code needs to: For each test case:\n\n1. Read n, m, a array, and edges. 2. Compute the degree of each node. 3. Compute the total number of edges (m). 4. If m is even \u2192 output 0. \n\n5. Else \u2192 find the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. Wait, but the total edges is m. \n\nWait, the total edges is m, because each edge is counted once. Yes. So the code can be written as follows: For each test case:\n\n- Read n and m. \n\n- Read the a array. - Read m edges, and compute the degree of each node. - Compute the total edges (m). - If m is even \u2192 output 0. \n\n- Else \u2192 find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. This is straightforward. Now, looking at the provided code:\n\nThe current code has:\n\nif(M%2==0){\n\n    System.out.println(0);\n\n    continue;\n\n} Then, it proceeds to compute something with the map. The code is trying to find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. But in the current code, the loop is:\n\nfor(int a : map.keySet()){\n\n    if((map.get(a)).size()%2==0){\n\n        for(Object j: (ArrayList)map.get(a)){\n\n            int now = A.get(a-1);\n\n            if((map.get((int)j).size())%2==0){\n\n                /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    else{\n\n        maxi = Math.min(maxi,A.get(a-1));\n\n    }\n\n} Wait, the code is iterating over the keys in the map (which are the nodes with at least one friend). For each node a in the map, it checks if the size of its adjacency list is even. Wait, the adjacency list for node a is stored as map.get(a). The size of this list is the degree of a. So, if the degree is even \u2192 the node's degree is even. Else \u2192 the degree is odd.",

The correct approach is to compute the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. The current code's else clause is doing that.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let me read through the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting some members to invite to a party such that the total number of cakes (which is the number of friend pairs both invited) is even. The goal is to minimize the total unhappiness, which is the sum of a_i for all members not invited. \n\nHmm, the key points here are:\n\n1. The number of cakes must be even. Each cake corresponds to a friend pair where both are invited.\n2. We need to choose a subset of members to invite such that the count of such pairs is even, and the sum of a_i for non-invited is minimized.\n\nThe approach here probably involves some graph theory since friends form edges. Maybe the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a member, and edges are the friend pairs. The cakes are the edges in the induced subgraph of the invited members. The total number of edges must be even.\n\nWait, how do we ensure that the number of edges is even? That's tricky. Let me think of possible approaches.\n\nOne idea is that the problem can be transformed into a minimum vertex cover or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a problem that can be modeled with parity constraints. Since the number of edges must be even, perhaps we can model this as a graph and find a subset with even edges, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be considered as a graph where each node has a cost (a_i if not invited, so we want to minimize the sum of a_i for non-invited, which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of (cost of inviting) minus the a_i's. Wait, actually, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize that, we want to invite as many as possible except those with high a_i. But the constraint complicates things.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each edge contributes to the parity. Let me think of the problem in terms of parity. The total number of edges must be even. So, the parity of the number of edges in the selected subset must be even.\n\nThis reminds me of problems where you have to choose a subset with certain parity conditions. Maybe we can model this as a graph and find a minimum weight vertex cover with some parity condition, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the parity of the number of edges is even. Let me think of the problem as a graph where each edge is part of the selected subset. The total edges must be even. To minimize the unhappiness, which is the sum of a_i for non-invited, we can think of it as maximizing the sum of (10000 - a_i) for invited members, but that's a different angle.\n\nWait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So, to minimize that, we want to invite as many as possible except those with high a_i. But the constraint is that the number of edges in the invited subset must be even.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node has a cost (the a_i if not invited), and edges have some constraints. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be considered as a bipartition problem where the parity of edges is even. Let me think of the problem in terms of the graph's connected components. For example, in trees or cycles, the parity might be easier to handle.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model this as a graph and find a subset S of vertices such that the number of edges within S is even, and the sum of a_i for vertices not in S is minimized. \n\nThis sounds like an optimization problem with a parity constraint. How can we model this?\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is using dynamic programming on the connected components of the graph. Since the edges must form an even count, perhaps each connected component contributes to the parity, and we can track the parity across components.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each connected component can be considered independently, and the total parity is the sum of the parities of each component. Since the total must be even, the sum of the parities of all components must be even. \n\nWait, but the edges are in the entire graph, so the total number of edges in the selected subset is the sum over all edges in the graph that are between two selected nodes. So the parity is the sum modulo 2 of all edges in the selected subset. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be broken down into connected components. Let me think: if the graph is split into connected components, then the edges within each component contribute to the total. The parity of the total is the sum of the parities of each component's edges. So, the total parity is even if the sum of the parities of each component's edges is even. \n\nTherefore, perhaps each connected component can be handled separately, and the overall solution must have an even total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe each connected component can be considered as a separate problem, and the solution must choose subsets for each component such that the sum of their parities is even. \n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe manageable. Let me think of each connected component as a graph, and for each component, we can compute two possibilities: the minimum unhappiness when the number of edges in that component's subset is even, and when it's odd. Then, the overall solution would choose a combination of these such that the total parity is even, and the sum of unhappiness is minimized.\n\nYes, that sounds plausible. Let me formalize this idea.\n\nSuppose for each connected component, we can compute two values:\n\n- min_even: the minimum unhappiness when the number of edges in the component's subset is even.\n\n- min_odd: the minimum unhappiness when it's odd.\n\nThen, the total problem would be to select for each component either even or odd, such that the total number of edges (sum of parities mod 2) is even, and the sum of unhappiness is minimized.\n\nWait, but the total parity is the sum of the parities of each component's edge counts mod 2. So, the total parity is even if the number of components with odd parity is even. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to choosing for each component whether to take even or odd, such that the total number of components with odd parity is even, and the sum of their min values is minimized.\n\nThis seems manageable. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Split the graph into connected components.\n\n2. For each component, compute min_even and min_odd.\n\n3. Then, the problem becomes selecting a subset of components to have odd parity (so that the total is even), and choose the combination with the minimal total unhappiness.\n\nBut how do we compute min_even and min_odd for each component?\n\nHmm, the key is to model each connected component and find the minimal unhappiness for each parity (even or odd number of edges in the subset).\n\nNow, how to compute min_even and min_odd for a connected component?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming on trees, but for general graphs, perhaps it's more complex. Alternatively, maybe each connected component can be considered as a graph where the decision is whether to include each node, and track the parity of edges selected so far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node has a cost (the a_i if not invited, so inviting a node is like not paying that cost). The edges contribute to the parity. The goal is to choose a subset S of nodes such that the number of edges within S is even, and the sum of a_i for nodes not in S is minimized.\n\nWait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for non-invited, so the total unhappiness is sum_{i not in S} a_i. To minimize this, we want to maximize the sum of a_i for those not in S, but actually, no, it's the opposite. Wait, no, the unhappiness is exactly the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize it, we want to invite as many as possible except those with high a_i. But the constraint complicates this.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be transformed into maximizing the sum of (10000 - a_i) for invited nodes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as a graph where each node has a cost (the a_i if not invited), and edges have some constraints on the parity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node can be chosen or not, and the edges contribute to the parity. The key is to find a subset S of nodes such that the number of edges within S is even, and the sum of a_i for nodes not in S is minimized.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming on trees, but for general graphs, perhaps it's challenging. Let me think of small examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSuppose the first test case has n=3, m=2, with friends (1-2 and 2-3). The a array is [0,0,0]. So inviting all three would give 2 edges (since 1-2 and 2-3 are both in the subset). The number of edges is 2, which is even. So the unhappiness is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample where m is odd. Let's see the second sample in the note: the second test case has n=3, m=0. So the number of edges is 0 (even), so any subset is allowed. The minimal unhappiness is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which gives a total of 2 (since a2 and a3 are 0 and 2? Wait the note says the second test case's a array is [3,2,5], maybe? Let me check the note again.\n\nWait the note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives unhappiness 2 (since a1 is 3, a2 is 2, a3 is 5? Wait no, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So if you invite 2 and 3, then the non-invited is 1, so the unhappiness is a1=3. Wait the note says the minimum is 2. Wait maybe I need to check the note again.\n\nWait the note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (since there are no friends, so 0 edges). The unhappiness would be a1 (3) because 1 is not invited. But the note says the minimum is 2. Wait maybe the a array is different. Let me recheck the note's example.\n\nThe note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (since no friends), and the unhappiness is 2. So the a array must be such that a1 is 3, a2 is 0, a3 is 0? Or perhaps the a array is [3, 2, 5]. Wait the note says the unhappiness for inviting 2 and 3 is 3 (a1's value?), but the note says the minimum is 2. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me read the note again.\n\nIn the second test case's note:\n\nPossible options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (since m=0, so no edges). The unhappiness would be a1 (since 1 is not invited). The note says that option's unhappiness is 2. So a1 must be 2? Or perhaps the a array is [3, 2, 5]. Wait the note says the minimum is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which gives unhappiness 2. So the a array for that case must have a1=3, a2=0, a3=0? Or maybe the a array is [3, 2, 5], then the unhappiness when inviting 2 and 3 would be a1 (3) plus a3 (5?) no, no, the non-invited are 1 and 3? Wait no, if you invite 2 and 3, then the non-invited is 1. So the unhappiness is a1's value. So in that case, the a1 must be 2. Hmm, perhaps the example's a array is [2, 0, 0], but I'm not sure. Anyway, the note's example shows that when there are no edges (m=0), the number of cakes is zero (even), so any subset is allowed. So the minimal unhappiness is the minimal possible sum of a_i for non-invited, which would be achieved by inviting as many as possible except those with high a_i.\n\nBack to the problem. The key is to model each connected component and compute min_even and min_odd for each.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we can compute the minimal unhappiness when the number of edges in the subset is even or odd. Then, the overall solution is to choose for each component whether to take even or odd, such that the total parity is even, and the sum is minimized.\n\nNow, how to compute min_even and min_odd for a connected component?\n\nHmm, perhaps the connected component can be considered as a graph, and the problem reduces to choosing a subset S of nodes such that the number of edges within S has a certain parity, and the unhappiness is minimized.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming on trees, but for general graphs, perhaps it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe the problem can be transformed into a graph where each node's inclusion affects the parity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal unhappiness for a component can be found by considering the parity and making some choices. Let me think of the component as a graph and model it as a graph where each node can be included or not, and the edges contribute to the parity.\n\nWait, the number of edges in the subset S is the number of edges between nodes in S. So, the parity is the count mod 2 of such edges.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each connected component, the minimal unhappiness for even and odd parity can be found using a dynamic programming approach where we track the current parity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node has a cost (the a_i if not invited), and the edges contribute to the parity. The goal is to choose a subset S with minimal total cost (sum of a_i not in S) such that the number of edges in S is even.\n\nThis is similar to a problem where you have to choose a subset with a certain parity condition on some count, and minimize a cost. Such problems can sometimes be approached with a DP that tracks the parity.\n\nLet me think of the component as a tree. Suppose the component is a tree. Then, perhaps we can model the DP as follows:\n\nFor each node, decide whether to include it or not, and track the parity of the edges selected so far. But this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal unhappiness for even and odd can be found by considering the entire component and finding the minimal cost for each parity.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints. Let me think of the problem as follows:\n\nThe minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for all not invited. To minimize this, we want to invite as many as possible except those with high a_i. However, the constraint is that the number of edges in the invited subset must be even.\n\nSuppose we first decide to invite all members except those with the highest a_i. Then, check if the number of edges is even. If yes, that's the solution. If not, we need to adjust by flipping the invitation of some members to change the parity.\n\nThe minimal adjustment would be to find a way to flip the invitation of some members such that the parity of the edges changes (from odd to even) with the least possible increase in unhappiness.\n\nHmm, this approach might work. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the optimal solution without considering the parity constraint would be to invite all members except those with the highest a_i. Let's call this the base solution. Let the number of edges in this base solution be E. If E is even, then that's our answer. If it's odd, we need to adjust it to make it even.\n\nTo adjust, we can flip the invitation of some members. Flipping a member's invitation (from not invited to invited, or vice versa) will change the number of edges in the subset. The goal is to find a flip that changes the parity (so E becomes even) with the minimal possible increase in unhappiness.\n\nThe minimal increase would be the minimal (a_i - (cost of flipping)), but I need to think carefully.\n\nWait, flipping a member from not invited to invited would add their a_i to the unhappiness (since they were not invited before, so their a_i was part of the unhappiness, but now they are invited, so subtract a_i from the total). Wait, no: the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So if you invite a member who was not invited before, you subtract their a_i from the total. Conversely, if you uninvite someone who was invited, you add their a_i to the total.\n\nSo flipping a member's invitation (from not invited to invited) reduces the unhappiness by a_i, and flipping from invited to not invited increases it by a_i.\n\nTherefore, to adjust the parity, we need to find a set of flips that changes the parity of the number of edges, and the net change in unhappiness is minimal (could be negative, meaning it's better).\n\nThe minimal change would be the minimal possible (delta) such that flipping those members changes the parity and the delta is as small as possible (or even negative, which would be better).\n\nBut how do we find such a flip?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal adjustment can be found by considering flipping a single member. Because flipping a single member can change the parity if that member is part of an odd number of edges in the current subset.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the current number of edges is odd. We need to flip some members so that the total edges change parity (to even). The minimal change would be to flip a member whose inclusion/exclusion affects the parity.\n\nBut how does flipping a single member affect the parity?\n\nSuppose we have a member x. Let's say in the current subset S (the base solution), x is not invited. If we invite x, then all edges connected to x (where the other end is also in S) will be added. The number of such edges is the number of friends of x that are in S. Let's call this count c. So adding x would add c edges. The parity of the total edges would change by c mod 2. So if c is odd, then flipping x's invitation would change the parity. \n\nSimilarly, if x was in S and we remove them, then the edges connected to x in S would be subtracted. The count is again c, so the parity change is c mod 2.\n\nTherefore, to flip the parity, we need to find a member x such that the number of their friends in the current subset S has an odd count. Flipping x's invitation would change the parity.\n\nThe minimal cost would be the minimal (a_x) if we are adding x (since that would reduce the unhappiness by a_x, but the cost is -a_x, so we want the maximum a_x?), or the minimal (cost of removing x, which is +a_x). Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, the idea is that to flip the parity, we can choose any member x where the number of their friends in S is odd. Flipping x's invitation will change the parity. The cost of this flip is:\n\nIf x was not in S (so we are adding them), the unhappiness decreases by a_x. So the net change is -a_x. But we have to consider whether this is allowed (i.e., whether adding x is better).\n\nAlternatively, if x was in S (so we are removing them), the unhappiness increases by a_x. So the net change is +a_x. \n\nTherefore, to find the minimal possible adjustment, we can look for all such x (those with an odd number of friends in S) and choose the one with the minimal (a_x) if we are adding them (since that gives the best possible decrease), or the minimal (a_x) if we are removing them (since that gives the least increase). \n\nWait, but which option is better? Let me think:\n\nSuppose the current unhappiness is U. The base solution has E edges (odd). We need to choose between flipping a member x not in S (so adding them) or flipping a member y in S (removing them). \n\nThe cost for flipping x (not in S) is: the new unhappiness is U - a_x, and the edges change by c (the number of friends of x in S). If c is odd, then the parity flips. So this is a valid option. The cost change is -a_x, so this is better than the base solution (since we want to minimize U). \n\nThe cost for flipping y (in S) is: the new unhappiness is U + a_y, and the edges change by (number of friends of y in S excluding y itself). Wait, when you remove y, all edges connected to y in S are removed. The count is the number of friends of y in S. Let's call that c. So the parity changes by c mod 2. So if c is odd, then flipping y's invitation (removing them) would change the parity. The cost is +a_y, which is worse than the base solution. \n\nTherefore, the best option is to find a member x not in S (so not invited in the base solution) such that the number of their friends in S is odd. Then, flipping x's invitation (inviting them) would decrease the unhappiness by a_x and flip the parity. \n\nAlternatively, if there are no such x (members not in S with odd friends in S), then we have to look for members in S with an odd number of friends in S. Flipping them would increase the unhappiness but flip the parity. \n\nTherefore, the minimal adjustment would be the minimal between:\n\n- The minimal a_x among all x not in S with odd friends in S (since choosing the smallest a_x gives the best decrease).\n\n- The minimal a_y among all y in S with odd friends in S (since choosing the smallest a_y gives the least increase).\n\nWe can choose whichever gives the better result (i.e., the minimal total unhappiness after adjustment).\n\nWait, but how do we know which option is better? Let me think:\n\nSuppose there exists an x not in S with odd friends in S. Then, flipping x gives a better result (since it reduces the unhappiness). So we can choose that x, and the new unhappiness is U - a_x. \n\nIf there are no such x, then we have to choose a y in S with odd friends in S. The new unhappiness would be U + a_y. \n\nTherefore, the minimal adjustment is the minimum between (the minimal a_x among possible x) and (the minimal a_y among possible y). \n\nWait, but we have to choose between these options. The minimal between (U - a_x) and (U + a_y). So the minimal of those two would be the better option. \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible unhappiness when the base solution has an odd number of edges is U minus the maximum possible a_x (since we want to subtract as much as possible) or U plus the minimal a_y. \n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe minimal unhappiness after adjustment would be:\n\nIf there exists an x not in S with odd friends in S, then the best option is to choose the x with the smallest a_x (since subtracting a_x gives the largest decrease). Wait, no, the smaller a_x is better because subtracting a smaller a_x gives a smaller decrease. Wait, no, wait: the unhappiness is U - a_x. To minimize the unhappiness, we want to subtract as much as possible, so we need to choose the largest a_x possible. Because if a_x is large, then subtracting it gives a bigger decrease. \n\nAh right! For example, if a_x is 10, then subtracting it gives a decrease of 10, leading to a lower unhappiness. So to minimize the unhappiness, we want to choose the x with the largest a_x (so that the decrease is as big as possible). \n\nWait, but the problem is that the x must not be in S (so in the base solution, they were not invited). So their a_x was part of the unhappiness. By inviting them, we remove their a_x from the unhappiness. So the better the a_x is large, the better. \n\nTherefore, among all possible x not in S with odd friends in S, the best is the one with the maximum a_x. \n\nSimilarly, for the y in S with odd friends in S, the minimal a_y would be the best (since adding a_y to the unhappiness is better if a_y is small). \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible unhappiness after adjustment is the minimum between:\n\n- (U - max_a_x) (if there exists such x)\n\n- (U + min_a_y) (if there exists such y)\n\nIf both options are available, we choose whichever is smaller. \n\nIf neither exists, then it's impossible? But since the graph is connected, perhaps there must be at least one such option. \n\nWait, but how do we know that there is at least one such x or y?\n\nHmm, perhaps the parity can be adjusted by flipping some member. Let me think of the base solution. The base solution is to invite everyone except those with the highest a_i. Wait, actually, the base solution is the optimal without considering the parity. But perhaps the base solution is to invite all possible except those with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, actually, the base solution is the one that gives the minimal unhappiness without considering the parity. So that would be to invite all except those with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, but how do we choose which members to exclude? To minimize the unhappiness, we should exclude the members with the highest a_i. So the base solution is to invite all except the members with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the number of edges in this base solution may be even or odd. If it's even, then that's the answer. If it's odd, we need to adjust it. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the base solution: invite all except the members with the highest a_i (so that the unhappiness is minimized without considering parity). \n\nWait, but how exactly do we choose which members to exclude? Because the minimal unhappiness is achieved by excluding the members with the highest a_i. So the base solution is to include all members except those with a_i in the top K, where K is chosen such that the total unhappiness is minimized. Wait, but actually, the minimal unhappiness is achieved by including as many as possible except those with the highest a_i. So the base solution is to include everyone except the members with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the number of edges in this base solution may be even or odd. \n\nWait, but perhaps the base solution is to include everyone, and then see if the number of edges is even. If not, then we need to adjust. But that might not be optimal. \n\nHmm, perhaps the base solution is the one that gives the minimal possible unhappiness without considering the parity. To find that, we can greedily include all members except those with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, but the minimal unhappiness is achieved by including as many as possible, so the base solution is to include everyone except those with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, but the problem is that the number of edges in this base solution may be even or odd. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Compute the base solution (include all except those with highest a_i) and compute the number of edges in that subset. \n\n- If the number of edges is even, then that's the answer. \n\n- If it's odd, then we need to find the minimal possible adjustment by flipping some members to change the parity. \n\nThe adjustment can be done by flipping a single member (as discussed earlier) or multiple, but flipping a single member is sufficient if possible. \n\nTherefore, the key is to find the minimal possible adjustment. \n\nNow, how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, let's think of the steps:\n\n1. For each test case:\n\n   a. Read n, m, a array, and the edges. \n\n   b. Compute the base solution: include all members except those with the highest a_i. Wait, but how do we choose which to exclude? To minimize the unhappiness, we need to exclude the members with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize it, we should exclude as few as possible, and those with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, actually, the minimal unhappiness is achieved by inviting all members except those with the highest a_i. Because if you exclude a member with a high a_i, you save that a_i from the unhappiness. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. So to minimize it, you want to exclude as few as possible, and those with the smallest a_i. Wait, no, that's the opposite. \n\nWait, if you exclude a member, their a_i is added to the unhappiness. So to minimize the total, you want to exclude as few as possible, and those with the smallest a_i. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose you have two members: one with a_i=5 and another with a_j=10. If you can exclude one, you should exclude the one with a_i=10, because that way the unhappiness is 10, whereas excluding the 5 would give 5. So to minimize the total, you exclude the highest a_i. \n\nAh right! So to minimize the unhappiness, you should exclude the members with the highest a_i. \n\nTherefore, the base solution is to include all members except the ones with the highest a_i. But how many to exclude? \n\nWait, the minimal unhappiness is achieved by including all except the members with the highest a_i. But how many to exclude? \n\nActually, the minimal unhappiness is achieved by including all members except those with the highest a_i. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because you can choose to exclude any subset, but the minimal is achieved by excluding the members with the highest a_i. \n\nWait, the minimal unhappiness is the sum of a_i for the excluded members. To minimize this sum, you should exclude the members with the smallest a_i. Wait, no! Wait, the sum is the sum of a_i for excluded members. So to minimize the sum, you should exclude as few as possible, and those with the smallest a_i. \n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose you have to choose a subset S of members to invite. The unhappiness is the sum of a_i for members not in S. To minimize this, you want to maximize the sum of a_i for members in S (since the total sum of all a_i is fixed, so maximizing the sum in S is equivalent to minimizing the sum not in S). \n\nWait, no. The total sum of all a_i is fixed. The unhappiness is the sum of a_i for non-invited. So to minimize that, you want to maximize the sum of a_i for invited members. \n\nAh, right! So the problem reduces to selecting a subset S of members to invite such that the number of edges within S is even, and the sum of a_i for S is maximized. \n\nTherefore, the base solution (without considering parity) is to choose S as the entire set (since that maximizes the sum of a_i for S, assuming all a_i are non-negative). Wait, but if some a_i are negative? No, the problem states that a_i can be 0 or positive. \n\nWait, the problem says 0 \u2264 a_i \u2264 1e4. So all a_i are non-negative. Therefore, the maximum sum is achieved by inviting everyone. \n\nWait, that's a key insight! \n\nAh! So the base solution is to invite everyone. Because that gives the maximum possible sum of a_i for invited (so the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for non-invited, which is zero if everyone is invited). \n\nWait, but the problem allows not inviting members. But since a_i is non-negative, the minimal unhappiness is achieved by inviting everyone. \n\nWait, yes! Because if you don't invite someone, you add their a_i to the unhappiness. So to minimize the unhappiness, you should invite everyone. \n\nBut the problem has a constraint: the number of edges (friend pairs both invited) must be even. \n\nSo the base solution (without considering the constraint) is to invite everyone, which gives unhappiness 0. But if the number of edges is even, then that's the answer. If it's odd, we have to exclude some members to make the number of edges even, but this will increase the unhappiness. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to:\n\nIf the number of edges in the entire graph is even, then the answer is 0. \n\nOtherwise, we need to find a subset S (a subset of the members) such that the number of edges in S is even, and the unhappiness (sum of a_i not in S) is minimized. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness will be the minimal possible between the base case (if possible) and the adjusted cases. \n\nWait, but the base case (inviting everyone) may have an odd number of edges. In that case, we need to find a subset S with even edges, which is as close as possible to inviting everyone. \n\nSo the problem becomes: when the total edges in the entire graph is odd, we need to find the minimal possible increase in unhappiness by excluding some members such that the number of edges becomes even. \n\nThe minimal increase would be the minimal possible a_i (since excluding a member with a_i adds a_i to the unhappiness). \n\nWait, but how does excluding a member affect the number of edges? \n\nExcluding a member x removes all edges connected to x from the count. So the number of edges in the new subset S' (without x) is E - c, where c is the number of edges connected to x in the original subset. \n\nThe parity of E' = E - c mod 2. \n\nWe want E' to be even. Since E was odd, we need E' mod 2 = 0 \u2192 (E - c) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 (odd - c) mod 2 = 0 \u2192 c mod 2 = 1. \n\nSo, to achieve this, we need to exclude a member x such that the number of edges connected to x in the original subset (which is the degree of x in the graph) is odd. \n\nBecause then, c is odd, so E - c is even. \n\nAlternatively, we can exclude a member x with degree odd. \n\nThe cost of excluding x is a_x. \n\nAlternatively, we can exclude two members x and y such that the total change in edges is even. But that might be more expensive. \n\nThe minimal cost would be to find a single member x with degree odd, and exclude them. The cost is a_x. \n\nIf there are no such members with odd degree, then we need to exclude two members whose combined effect changes the parity. \n\nWait, but if all members have even degrees, then excluding any member x with even degree would change the edge count by even (since c is even), so E' = odd - even = odd. Not helpful. \n\nHmm, this suggests that if the total edges is odd, then there must be at least one member with odd degree. \n\nWait, in any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even. Because the sum of degrees is even (each edge contributes to two degrees). \n\nSo if the total edges is odd, then the total degree is 2E (since each edge contributes 2 to the sum of degrees). Wait, no, the sum of degrees is 2E. \n\nWait, the total edges is E. The sum of degrees is 2E. \n\nSo the number of vertices with odd degree must be even. \n\nTherefore, if the total edges is odd, then the number of vertices with odd degree is even. \n\nTherefore, there are at least two vertices with odd degree. \n\nSo, in this case, to fix the parity, we can exclude one of them (cost a_x) or exclude two of them (cost a_x + a_y). \n\nThe minimal between these options would be the minimal between the smallest a_x among the odd-degree nodes, or the sum of the two smallest a_x and a_y among them. \n\nWait, but excluding two nodes with odd degrees would change the parity as follows:\n\nSuppose we exclude x and y. \n\nThe original edge count is E (odd). \n\nThe number of edges removed by excluding x is c_x (the degree of x in the original graph). \n\nThe number of edges removed by excluding y is c_y (degree of y). \n\nBut when excluding both, the total edges removed is c_x + c_y - edges between x and y (if they were friends). \n\nWait, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, the parity change when excluding x is (E - c_x) mod 2. \n\nExcluding y would give (E - c_x - (c_y - edges_xy)) mod 2? Not sure. \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the minimal cost is to exclude one node with odd degree, which costs a_x. \n\nBecause excluding such a node changes the parity from odd to even. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal edge count is E (odd). \n\nExcluding x with degree c (odd):\n\nThe new edge count is E - (number of edges incident to x in the original subset). \n\nWait, the edges incident to x are exactly c edges. \n\nSo the new edge count is E - c. \n\nSince c is odd, E - c is even. \n\nYes! So excluding a node with odd degree will flip the parity. \n\nTherefore, the minimal cost is the minimal a_x among all nodes with odd degree. \n\nBecause excluding that node will make the edge count even, and the cost is a_x. \n\nAlternatively, we can exclude two nodes with odd degrees. The cost would be a_x + a_y. \n\nBut since the minimal a_x is better than a_x + a_y (assuming a_x is the smallest), the best option is to choose the node with the smallest a_x among those with odd degrees. \n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nIf the total number of edges is even \u2192 answer is 0 (since we can invite everyone). \n\nElse \u2192 find all nodes with odd degree. The minimal a_i among them is the minimal cost to exclude one of them. The answer is the minimal a_i. \n\nWait, but what if there are no nodes with odd degree? But earlier we saw that when the total edges is odd, the number of nodes with odd degree must be even and at least two. \n\nSo in that case, there are at least two nodes with odd degrees. \n\nTherefore, the minimal cost is the minimal a_i among those nodes. \n\nWait, but what if the minimal a_i is better than excluding two nodes? \n\nYes, because excluding one node with the smallest a_i gives a cost of a_i, whereas excluding two nodes would cost a_i + a_j, which is larger. \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible cost is the minimal a_i among the nodes with odd degrees. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nIf the total edges is even \u2192 0. \n\nElse \u2192 the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. \n\nWait, this seems to fit the sample inputs. \n\nLet me check the first sample in the note:\n\nFirst test case: all members invited. The number of edges is even \u2192 answer 0. \n\nSecond test case: m=0. So edges is 0 (even). So answer is 0? But the note says the answer is 2. Wait, this contradicts. \n\nWait, the second test case in the note must have m=0. \n\nWait the note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3 (which gives 0 cakes, which is even). The minimal unhappiness is 2. \n\nWait, but according to the algorithm, since the total edges is 0 (even), the answer should be 0 (inviting everyone). But the note's example says the minimal is 2. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. \n\nWait, what's the second test case's input? \n\nThe note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (so edges is 0, even). The unhappiness is a1 (3) because 1 is not invited. \n\nWait, but according to the algorithm, the base solution is to invite everyone (since that gives minimal unhappiness). The unhappiness would be 0 (since all are invited). But the note's example says the minimal is 2. \n\nAh! There's a contradiction here. \n\nThis means my reasoning is wrong. \n\nWhat's the problem here?\n\nAh! Oh right! The second test case must have a different setup. Let me re-read the note's second example:\n\nIn the second test case, the possible options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes (so edges is 0, even). The unhappiness is 3 (a1's value). But the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3, which gives unhappiness 2. \n\nWait, perhaps the a array is [3, 2, 5]. Then, inviting 2 and 3 would have unhappiness a1 (3). But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nAh, maybe the a array is [2, 0, 0]. Then, inviting everyone would give unhappiness 0. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the note. Let me read the note again:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 1 and 2 (0 cakes, unhappiness 3); invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes, unhappiness 2); invite only 1 (0 cakes, unhappiness 4); invite only 2 (0 cakes, unhappiness 5); invite only 3 (0 cakes, unhappiness 3); invite nobody (0 cakes, unhappiness 6). The minimum is 2.\"\n\nAh, so the a array must be such that:\n\n- a1 is 4 (since inviting only 1 gives unhappiness 4).\n\n- a2 is 5 (inviting only 2 gives 5).\n\n- a3 is 3 (inviting only 3 gives 3).\n\nWait, but when inviting 2 and 3, the unhappiness is a1 (4?), but the note says it's 2. \n\nHmm, perhaps the a array is [3, 2, 5]. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIf the a array is [3, 2, 5], then:\n\n- inviting 2 and 3: the non-invited is 1, so unhappiness is 3 (a1's value). \n\nBut the note says the minimum is 2. \n\nAh, maybe the a array is [2, 0, 0]. Then, inviting 2 and 3 gives a1's a_i of 2. \n\nAh, that would fit. \n\nSo the a array is [2,0,0]. \n\nThen, the base solution (inviting everyone) would have unhappiness 0. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nWait, this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so what's wrong with my approach?\n\nAh! The problem is that the base solution (inviting everyone) may not be allowed if the number of edges is odd. \n\nWait, in the second test case, the number of edges is zero (m=0). So the number of edges is even (0 is even). Therefore, the base solution (inviting everyone) is allowed, and the unhappiness is zero. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nAh! Wait, the note's second test case must have m=1? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's input. \n\nWait the note says in the second test case, the options include inviting 2 and 3, which gives 0 cakes. So m must be zero. \n\nBut according to the problem's first sample, when the number of edges is even, the answer is zero. \n\nBut in the note's second test case, the answer is 2. \n\nThis suggests that my reasoning is wrong. \n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's description. \n\nWait the problem says that the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for members not invited. \n\nIn the second test case's note, the minimal is achieved by inviting 2 and 3. The unhappiness is a1 (3?), but the note says it's 2. \n\nWait, perhaps the a array is [2,0,0]. Then, inviting 2 and 3 gives a1's a_i of 2, which matches the note's minimum of 2. \n\nIn that case, the base solution (inviting everyone) would have unhappiness zero. But the note's example says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the second test case has m=0, but the number of edges is zero (even), so the base solution (inviting everyone) is allowed. So the unhappiness would be zero. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that the number of cakes is even, but the cakes are the number of friend pairs that are both invited. \n\nIn the second test case, if you invite everyone, then the number of cakes is zero (since there are no friends). So it's even. So the unhappiness should be zero. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis suggests that the second test case's a array must have a1=2, a2=0, a3=0. \n\nThen, inviting everyone would give unhappiness zero. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the note's second test case has m=1. Let me re-read the note's example:\n\n\"In the second test case, the following options are possible: invite 1 and 2 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 3); invite 2 and 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 2); invite only 1 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 4); invite only 2 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 5); invite only 3 (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 3); invite nobody (0 cakes eaten, unhappiness value equal to 6). The minimum unhappiness value is achieved by inviting 2 and 3.\"\n\nWait, the unhappiness for inviting 2 and 3 is 2. So the a array must be such that a1 is 2 (since they are not invited). \n\nSo the a array is [2,0,0]. \n\nThen, inviting everyone would give unhappiness zero. But the note's example says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the number of cakes must be even, but the number of cakes is the number of friend pairs that are both invited. \n\nIn the second test case, if there are no friends (m=0), then the number of cakes is zero (even), so inviting everyone is allowed. The unhappiness would be zero. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the note's example, or I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the number of cakes must be even, but the number of cakes is the number of edges in the subset. \n\nIn the second test case, if the a array is [2,0,0], then inviting everyone would give zero cakes (since no edges), which is even. So the unhappiness is zero. But the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nHmm, perhaps the note's second test case has m=1. Let's see:\n\nSuppose m=1, with friends (1-2). \n\nThen, inviting everyone would give 1 cake (the pair 1-2). The number of cakes is 1 (odd), so it's invalid. \n\nAh! That makes sense. \n\nSo the second test case must have m=1. \n\nThen, the number of edges is 1 (odd). \n\nThe base solution (inviting everyone) is invalid because the number of cakes is 1 (odd). \n\nSo we need to find a subset with even number of edges. \n\nThe minimal unhappiness would be achieved by excluding one of the nodes in the friend pair. \n\nFor example, excluding node 1: the subset is 2 and 3 (assuming there are three nodes). The edges are none (since the friend pair is 1-2, and 1 is excluded). So the number of cakes is 0 (even). The unhappiness is a1 (2) + a3 (0) if a3 is 0. \n\nWait, but the note's example says the minimal is 2. \n\nThis fits. \n\nSo the second test case has m=1, friends between 1 and 2. \n\nThe a array is [2,0,0]. \n\nThe base solution (inviting everyone) has 1 edge (odd), so invalid. \n\nThe minimal adjustment is to exclude node 1 (cost 2) or node 2 (cost 0). \n\nExcluding node 2 gives a subset of 1 and 3. The edges are none (since 1-2 is excluded). The unhappiness is a2 (0) is not invited, so a2 is added to the unhappiness? Wait no, the unhappiness is the sum of a_i for those not invited. \n\nIf we exclude node 2, then the invited are 1 and 3. The non-invited is 2. The unhappiness is a2 (0). \n\nThe number of edges is zero (even). So this is valid. The unhappiness is zero. \n\nBut the note says the minimal is 2. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting again. \n\nAh! Maybe the a array is different. \n\nSuppose the a array is [3, 2, 5]. \n\nThen, excluding node 2 (a_i=2) gives unhappiness of 2 (since node 2 is not invited). The edges are none (since 1-2 is excluded). \n\nThis would give an unhappiness of 2, which matches the note's example. \n\nAh! So the second test case has m=1 (friend between 1 and 2), and a array [3,2,5]. \n\nThen, the base solution (inviting everyone) has 1 edge (odd), so invalid. \n\nThe minimal adjustment is to exclude node 2 (cost 2) or node 1 (cost 3) or node 3 (cost 5). \n\nExcluding node 2 gives unhappiness 2, which is the minimal. \n\nSo the answer is 2. \n\nThis fits the note's example. \n\nSo the algorithm I thought of earlier is correct. \n\nThe steps are:\n\n- Compute the total number of edges in the entire graph. \n\n- If even \u2192 answer is 0 (inviting everyone). \n\n- Else \u2192 find all nodes with odd degree. The minimal a_i among them is the answer. \n\nBecause excluding that node will make the edge count even. \n\nIn the second test case, the friend is between 1 and 2. \n\nThe degrees are:\n\nNode 1 has degree 1 (odd). \n\nNode 2 has degree 1 (odd). \n\nNode 3 has degree 0 (even). \n\nThe minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree is min(3,2) \u2192 2. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nThe first test case has even edges \u2192 answer 0. \n\nThe third test case's note says that inviting members 3,4,5 gives a valid party. \n\nAssuming the edges form a graph where the total edges is even. \n\nSo the algorithm works. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read n, m, a array, and edges. \n\n2. Compute the degree of each node. \n\n3. Compute the total number of edges (m). \n\n4. If m is even \u2192 output 0. \n\n5. Else \u2192 find the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. \n\nWait, but the total edges is m. \n\nWait, the total edges is m, because each edge is counted once. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read n and m. \n\n- Read the a array. \n\n- Read m edges, and compute the degree of each node. \n\n- Compute the total edges (m). \n\n- If m is even \u2192 output 0. \n\n- Else \u2192 find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nThis is straightforward. \n\nNow, looking at the provided code:\n\nThe current code has:\n\nif(M%2==0){\n\n    System.out.println(0);\n\n    continue;\n\n}\n\nThen, it proceeds to compute something with the map. \n\nThe code is trying to find the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nBut in the current code, the loop is:\n\nfor(int a : map.keySet()){\n\n    if((map.get(a)).size()%2==0){\n\n        for(Object j: (ArrayList)map.get(a)){\n\n            int now = A.get(a-1);\n\n            if((map.get((int)j).size())%2==0){\n\n                /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    else{\n\n        maxi = Math.min(maxi,A.get(a-1));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, the code is iterating over the keys in the map (which are the nodes with at least one friend). \n\nFor each node a in the map, it checks if the size of its adjacency list is even. \n\nWait, the adjacency list for node a is stored as map.get(a). The size of this list is the degree of a. \n\nSo, if the degree is even \u2192 the node's degree is even. \n\nElse \u2192 the degree is odd. \n\nThe code is then, for nodes with odd degree (else clause), it updates maxi to be the minimum between current maxi and A.get(a-1). \n\nBut the initial value of maxi is 100000. \n\nHowever, this loop only considers nodes present in the map (i.e., nodes with at least one friend). \n\nBut nodes with degree zero (no friends) are not in the map. \n\nTherefore, the code is missing those nodes. \n\nFor example, a node with degree zero (no friends) has even degree (0 is even). So it won't be considered in the else clause. \n\nBut nodes with degree zero are okay. \n\nThe problem is that nodes with degree odd but not in the map (but that's impossible, because if a node has degree 1, it must be in the map. \n\nWait, the map is built by adding nodes when they have edges. \n\nFor example, when reading an edge (x,y), the code adds x to the map if not present, and similarly for y. \n\nSo any node with degree >=1 is in the map. \n\nNodes with degree zero are not in the map. \n\nTherefore, the code's loop over map.keySet() will miss nodes with degree zero. \n\nBut nodes with degree zero have even degree (0), so they are not part of the candidates for the minimal a_i. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct in that aspect. \n\nHowever, the code's initial maxi is set to 100000. \n\nBut what if there are no nodes with odd degree? \n\nBut earlier analysis says that when m is odd, the number of nodes with odd degree is even and at least two. \n\nSo the code should find at least one node with odd degree. \n\nThe code's loop is:\n\nfor each node in the map (nodes with degree >=1):\n\n    if degree is even \u2192 do something (but the code inside the if is not filled)\n\n    else \u2192 update maxi to be the minimum between current maxi and a_i. \n\nThe code's else clause is correct. \n\nHowever, the code's initial maxi is set to 100000, which is larger than any possible a_i (since a_i can be up to 1e4). \n\nTherefore, the code should work. \n\nBut in the current code, the part inside the if clause (when degree is even) is not filled. \n\nThe code has a comment /* TODO: Your code here */. \n\nThis is the missing part. \n\nThe code's logic is: \n\nWhen the degree is even (map.get(a).size() %2 ==0), then for each friend j of a, if j's degree is even, then do something. \n\nBut I'm not sure what the original author intended here. \n\nBut according to our analysis, the correct approach is to find the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. \n\nThe current code's else clause is doing that. \n\nHowever, the code is not considering nodes with degree zero. \n\nBut those nodes have even degree, so they are not part of the candidates. \n\nTherefore, the code is almost correct except for the part where it initializes maxi to 1e5, and then iterates over all nodes in the map with odd degree. \n\nBut the code also has a loop inside the if clause (when degree is even) that is not filled. \n\nThis suggests that the code is incorrect. \n\nThe correct approach is to compute the minimal a_i among all nodes with odd degree. \n\nThe current code's else clause is doing that. \n\nThe code's initial maxi is 1e5, and then for each node with odd degree (in the map), it updates maxi to the minimum. \n\nHowever, the code also has a loop inside the if clause (when degree is even) that is not filled. \n\nThis part is unnecessary and can be removed. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to remove the code inside the if clause (the for loop over j), and just compute the minimal a_i among nodes with odd degree. \n\nThe current code's else clause is correct. \n\nTherefore, the code should be modified as follows:\n\nIn the for loop over the map's keys:\n\nfor(int a : map.keySet()){\n\n    int degree = map.get(a).size();\n\n    if(degree %2 ==1){\n\n        maxi = Math.min(maxi, A.get(a-1));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nAdditionally, we also need to consider nodes with degree zero (but they have even degree, so they are not part of the candidates). \n\nTherefore, the code's current approach is almost correct, but the part inside the if clause (when degree is even) is unnecessary and can be removed. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nfor(int a : map.keySet()){\n\n    if((map.get(a)).size()%2==0){\n\n        for(Object j: (ArrayList)map.get(a)){\n\n            int now = A.get(a-1);\n\n            if((map.get((int)j).size())%2==0){\n\n                /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    else{\n\n        maxi = Math.min(maxi,A.get(a-1));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe code inside the if clause (when degree is even) is not needed. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to remove that part. \n\nThe correct code would be:\n\nfor(int a : map.keySet()){\n\n    int deg = map.get(a).size();\n\n    if(deg %2 ==1){\n\n        maxi = Math.min(maxi, A.get(a-1));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the current code has the else clause, so the code can be simplified by removing the if clause's code. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to replace the entire if block with nothing, or to remove the for loop inside the if clause. \n\nThe code currently has:\n\nif((map.get(a)).size()%2==0){\n\n    for(...){\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\n\nelse{ ... }\n\nThe code inside the if block is unnecessary and can be removed. \n\nTherefore, the correct code would be:\n\nfor(int a : map.keySet()){\n\n    int deg = map.get(a).size();\n\n    if(deg %2 ==1){\n\n        maxi = Math.min(maxi, A.get(a-1));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut in the current code, the else clause is already doing that. \n\nWait, the current code's else clause is executed when the degree is odd. \n\nSo the code is correct except for the unnecessary code in the if clause. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to remove the code inside the if clause (the for loop over j). \n\nThe code should be:\n\nfor(int a : map.keySet()){\n\n    if((map.get(a)).size()%2==0){\n\n        // do nothing\n\n    }\n\n    else{\n\n        maxi = Math.min(maxi,A.get(a-1));\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nBut the current code has a for loop inside the if clause. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to replace the for loop inside the if clause with nothing. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe current code has:\n\nif((map.get(a)).size()%2==0){\n\n    for(Object j: (ArrayList)map.get(a)){\n\n        int now = A.get(a-1);\n\n        if((map.get((int)j).size())%2==0){\n\n            /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe missing code is to replace this block with nothing. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the if clause should be removed. \n\nThe correct code would have:\n\nif((map.get(a)).size()%2==0){\n\n    // do nothing\n\n}\n\nelse{ ... }\n\nTherefore, the missing code is to remove the for loop inside the if clause. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is to replace the for loop with nothing. \n\nBut since the user's code has a comment there, perhaps the correct code is to replace the entire if block with nothing. \n\nAlternatively, the code inside the if clause is unnecessary and should be deleted. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to delete the for loop inside the if clause. \n\nThe user's code has:\n\nfor(int a : map.keySet()){\n\n    if((map.get(a)).size()%2==0){\n\n        for(Object j: (ArrayList)map.get(a)){\n\n            int now = A.get(a-1);\n\n

correct code should have the if clause's body as empty. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to replace the for loop inside the if clause with nothing. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the part that should replace the current code's TODO section. \n\nBut since the code inside the if clause is not needed, the correct code is to remove that part.

\n\nTherefore, the missing code is to delete this for loop. \n\nBut since the user's code is expecting to fill in the TODO, perhaps the correct code is to replace the TODO with nothing, but the entire for loop is unnecessary. \n\nTherefore, the correct code is to remove the for loop inside the if clause. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the
