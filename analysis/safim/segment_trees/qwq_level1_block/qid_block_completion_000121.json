So any command must be such that all robots are in positions that can move in that direction. The destination for (0,0) requires that one of the robots can reach there through some path of commands. Perhaps the minimal possible coordinates (minx and miny) must be such that:\n\nminx is the minimal row of all robots. For a robot to reach row 0, the minimal row must be at most 1? Wait, if the minimal row is 0 already, then there's a robot in row 0, but maybe not the column. Wait, perhaps the minimal row is <=1 and the minimal column is <=1. Let me think again with the previous example where miny was 2 and minx was 0. In that case, the minimal column (miny) is 2. To get a robot to 0,0, the robot has to move left twice. However, the first move left would decrease the column by 1 (so to 1), then another left to 0. Each move must be valid. For the first move left (command 'left'), all robots must have column >=1. Since the minimal column was 2, all robots are at columns >=2 \u2192 columns 2,3,4 (depending on m). So moving left once to 1,2,3: all are valid. So that step is allowed. Second move left: all robots are now in columns >=1 (since previous min was 1). So moving left again is allowed, resulting in columns 0,1,2.",

Wait, the minimal row must be exactly x (the R's row). So if we have another robot at row x, but also another robot at x+1, then their rows are all >=x. \n\nAfter first up move, all robots are reduced by 1. So the minimal row becomes x-1 (since R is now at x-1, and others are x, x+1-1 \u2192 x and x. \n\nWait the new minimal row is x-1. So after x up moves, the minimal row would be x -x =0. Thus, after all x moves, R would be at row 0. Meanwhile, all other robots would be at (original -x). Since their original rows were >=x, then (original -x) is >=0. Thus, all moves are valid.",

So according to the condition, we can move left once (min_y is 1). So moving left once takes it to (0,0), and since other robots (if any) have columns \u22651. So that's valid. Hence output is YES. Second test case (where any move causes explosion): suppose the robots are in positions like (0,0) and (0,1). Wait no, the second test case example says that any move causes some robot to explode. So perhaps the robots are arranged such that their minimal row is 0 and minimal column is 0. But there's a robot in (0,0). So according to the condition, since the robot is there already, the answer would be YES, but the note says the second test case can't reach.",

For example, suppose there are two robots at (0,0) and (0,1). If you send move left, then the robot at (0,0) can't move left (column becomes -1 \u2192 explodes). If you send move up (but row 0 can't move up), so that direction is invalid. Move down would require that all robots can move down. The robot at (0,0) can move down to row 1 (if n>1?), but the command can be given only if all can move. Wait, if n is 1 (only one row), then moving down would take to row 1 which is out of bounds. So in that case, if the test case has n=1 and m=2, with robots at (0,0) and (0,1), then any command would be invalid except left (which causes explosion of (0,0)), right (causes (0,1) to move to 2 (if m=2, then max column is 1 \u2192 moving right to 2 would be out of bounds. Thus, any command is invalid. So the answer is NO. But according to our condition, since there is a robot at (0,0), the minimal row and column are 0 and 0. Thus, the robot is there, so the answer should be YES. But in the test case, the output is NO. Ah, so there's a contradiction. This suggests that my condition is wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Because the robot is already at (0,0). So we can choose to send zero commands. Thus, the output should be YES. But according to the note's second test case, the output is NO.",

Thus, for each 'R' at (j,k):\n\nminx[i] = min( minx[i], j )\n\nminy[i] = min( miny[i], k )\n\nThus, after reading all rows for a test case, minx[i] will be the minimal row with a robot, and miny[i] the minimal column.

Wait looking at the code in the input function:\n\nInside the loop over the rows and columns for each test case:\n\nfor(int j=0;j<n[i];j++)\n\n    for(int k=0;k<m[i];k++)\n\n    {\n\n        cin>>c;\n\n        if(c=='E') a[i][j][k] =0;\n\n        else\n\n        {\n\n            // TODO: set a[i][j][k] to 1.\n\n            // also need to update minx and miny here. }\n\n    }\n\nWait, the current code has minx and miny initialized to 5, but in the loop, when R is found, they are not updated. So the code as given is incomplete. Ah! The code's current input function does not update the minx and miny for each 'R' found. Thus, the missing code is both setting a[i][j][k] =1, and also updating minx and miny. Thus, the code inside the 'else' block (for 'R') should do:\n\na[i][j][k] =1;\n\nif (j < minx[i]) minx[i] = j;\n\nif (k < miny[i]) miny[i] = k; Thus, this is what needs to be filled in the TODO block. Then, the output function checks whether the cell (minx[i], miny[i]) has a robot (since a[i][minx[i]][miny[i]] is 1). Thus, the code will work correctly. So the missing code in the TODO block is:\n\na[i][j][k] = 1;\n\nif (j < minx[i]) minx[i] = j;\n\nif (k < miny[i]) miny[i] = k; Thus, that is the code to fill in the else block. I think that's all. Let me verify with the examples. First test case example (robot at (0,1)):\n\nminx is 0, miny is 1.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to complete the C++ code for this problem. Let me read through the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if there's a way to move any robot to the upper-left corner (which is (0,0) probably) without any robot exploding. The robots move all at the same time with each command. So every time we give a command (like left), all robots move in that direction. If any robot would go out of the field, it explodes, so that command is invalid. We can choose any sequence of commands, but all steps must be valid (i.e., no robot moves out).\n\nHmm. The code given has some variables like minx and miny. Maybe they are trying to track the minimum x and y coordinates of the robots? Not sure yet. Let me look at the code structure.\n\nIn the input function, for each test case, they read n and m, then the grid. The a array is probably storing whether a cell has a robot (since they set a[i][j][k] to 0 for E and something else for R). The current code for the 'R' case is commented out with a TODO. So the first thing to do is fill in that part. Probably, when there's a robot, we need to set a[i][j][k] to 1? Or maybe track the positions of all robots?\n\nWait, the output function checks if a[i][minx[i]][miny[i]] is 1. Oh, maybe minx and miny are tracking the minimal coordinates. Like, the minimum row and column where any robot is present. But I'm not sure. Let me think: the output condition is checking the cell (minx[i], miny[i]) to see if it has a robot. So if any robot can reach the upper left corner, that would be (0,0). But maybe the approach is to find that the minimal x and y coordinates among all robots are 0 and 0, but that's only possible if there's a robot there already. Wait, the fifth note says that in the fourth test case, if a robot is already there, it outputs YES. So that check works for that case.\n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find that the minimal x (row) and minimal y (column) among all robots are 0 and 0 respectively. But that's not sufficient. Because even if some robot can reach (0,0) through some moves, but others might block it. Wait, maybe the problem requires that all robots can move in such a way so that at least one reaches the corner without any step causing any robot to explode.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to consider that in order for a robot to reach (0,0), all robots must be able to reach that position without moving out. Wait, maybe the key is that the minimal row among all robots must be 0 (so that at least one is in the first row) and minimal column must be 0 (so at least one is in the first column). Because then, if there's a robot that's in (0,0), then yes. Otherwise, if the minimal x is 0 and minimal y is 0, but there's a robot in (0,0), that's already covered. Wait, maybe the idea is that for all robots, their positions can be adjusted such that when moving towards the upper left, they can all stay on the board. Wait I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct condition is that the minimal row and column among all robots are 0. Because then, there must be at least one robot in the first row and one in the first column. Wait, but even that might not be sufficient. Let me think of the first example in the notes. \n\nFirst test case example: Suppose there's a robot in (0,1). The command is move left, so they reach (0,0). So in that case, the minimal y (column) is 1 initially. After moving left, they reach 0, so the minimal y becomes 0. But before moving, the minimal y was 1. So maybe the idea is that after some moves, one robot can reach (0,0) without any explosions. So how do we model this?\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is that there exists a direction sequence such that all robots can reach positions that don't cause any to go out of bounds, and at least one robot ends up at (0,0). \n\nBut how to model that in code? Since n and m are up to 5, maybe we can simulate all possible possible moves? Or find the necessary conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the constraints for a robot to reach (0,0) without exploding. For a robot to reach (0,0), the path must be such that every step in the command sequence doesn't take it out of the grid. \n\nWait, but all robots move in each command. So perhaps the minimal position among all robots in each direction must not be too far. \n\nAlternatively, a necessary condition is that the minimal row among all robots must be 1 (so that they can move up once to 0). Or wait, perhaps the minimal row of all robots must be <=0? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, let me think of the minimum x-coordinate (row) among all robots. If the minimal x is 0, then there's already a robot there. So that's a yes. Otherwise, for a robot to reach row 0, the robot must have x starting at 1. Because if it starts at row 2, then moving up once would take it to 1, but to get to row 0, it would need another move, but other robots may block.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal row (the smallest row among all robots) must be 1. Then, moving up once would bring all robots in row 1 down to 0? Wait no, when you give the command to move up, all robots in row 1 would go to 0. But robots in higher rows would move up as well, so if any robot is in row 0, it would move up to -1 (which would explode). Wait, so that approach is not correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the key is that all robots must be able to reach (0,0) through some path where their movement doesn't cause any explosion, but at least one of them does. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the necessary and sufficient condition is that for every robot, the row is at least 0 (duh) and column at least 0, but that's too vague.\n\nWait maybe the following:\n\nA robot can reach (0,0) only if there exists a sequence of commands such that:\n\nAfter all commands, the robot is at (0,0).\n\nBut during all steps, every robot stays within the grid.\n\nSo perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nFor the robot to reach (0,0), it must be possible that, after some movement steps, one robot's final position is (0,0), and all steps along the way (for all robots) don't go out of bounds.\n\nHmm, but how do we compute this efficiently? Since n and m are small (up to 5), perhaps we can model all possible possible robot positions after each possible command sequence?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as, for each test case, the robots can be moved via any sequence of commands (each command is a direction, applied to all robots). We need to find if there's a way such that:\n\nAt least one robot ends up at (0,0), and in every step of the command sequence, when moving, all robots stay within the grid.\n\nThe question is, can such a sequence of commands exist?\n\nHmm. But trying all possible command sequences is too slow, but since each command can be up to four directions and the number of steps can be up to maybe 10 (since 5x5 grid), but even 4^10 is 1e6, which might be manageable for small t (up to 5000). But 5000*1e6 is way too big. So that's not feasible. \n\nWe need a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For all robots to be able to move without exploding, in each command, all robots must move in the direction and not go out of the grid.\n\nEach command direction must be such that, for all robots currently in positions (x,y), moving in that direction stays in grid.\n\nSo, any command direction can be chosen only if all robots are in a position where moving in that direction won't take them out.\n\nThus, the sequence of commands must consist of directions where each direction is valid for the current positions of all robots.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of commands (possibly empty) such that after applying them, at least one robot is at (0,0), and all steps (each command) are valid.\n\nHmm, but how to model this?\n\nMaybe the problem can be rephrased as:\n\nFind if there exists a set of directions (a sequence) that can be applied such that:\n\n- Applying each direction in the sequence, each step must be valid (all robots can move in that direction without going outside)\n\n- After applying all directions, at least one robot is at (0,0).\n\nMoreover, the order of commands matters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal coordinates (the minimal row and column of all robots) must allow reaching (0,0).\n\nWait, maybe the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n\nThe minimal x (row) of all robots is 0, OR there exists a robot whose row is exactly 1 (so that moving up once brings it to 0, but only if all robots can move up).\n\nWait, but moving up requires that all robots are in rows >= 1. So, the minimal row must be at least 1. So if the minimal row is 1, then moving up is allowed, and the robot in row 1 will reach 0. Similarly, for columns.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is that:\n\nEither:\n\n- There already exists a robot in (0,0), so output yes.\n\nOR:\n\n- The minimal row among all robots is 1, and the minimal column is 0. Because then, moving up once would bring that robot to row 0, and since the minimal column is 0, there is a robot already at column 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the minimal row is 1. Then, if all robots are in row 1 or higher, then you can move up once, which brings all robots to row 0 or lower. But row 0 is okay, but any robot that was in row 0 can't move up. Wait, no, if they were already in row 0, but the minimal row is 1, that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal row is the smallest row occupied by any robot. So for the minimal row to be 1, there is at least one robot in row 1, and all are in rows >=1.\n\nThus, moving up would bring that robot to 0, and the others to row (current-1). So the minimal row after moving would be 0.\n\nSimilarly for columns.\n\nWait, so to have a robot reach (0,0), perhaps:\n\nThe minimal row among all robots must be 1 (so that a move up can bring it to 0), and the minimal column must be 1 (so that a move left can bring it to 0). Then, first move left to reach columns 0, but need to also move up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal row must be 1 and the minimal column must be 1. Then, moving up and left in some order would get to (0,0).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal row and column must be at most 1. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal row (minx) is the minimal row among all robots. Similarly, miny is the minimal column. So for a robot to reach (0,0), we can have:\n\nminx <= 0? No, because that would mean already at row 0. So maybe:\n\nThe minimal row (minx) must be 1, and the minimal column (miny) must be 1. Then, moving up once and left once (in any order) would get to (0,0). But during each step, all robots must be able to move.\n\nWait, let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose all robots are in row 1 or 2, and columns 1 or 2. So minx is 1, miny is 1. \n\nFirst command: move left. Then, all robots' columns decrease by 1. So the ones in column 1 go to 0, others to 0 or lower? Wait no: moving left decreases column by 1. So columns start at 1 and 2. After moving left, columns become 0 and 1. So any robot in column 0 is okay. The minimal column would now be 0 (since there are robots in column 0 now). \n\nThen, move up. So rows go down by 1. The robots in row 1 go to 0. So that robot would be at (0,0) after moving up and left? Let me see:\n\nSuppose there's a robot at (1,1). After left, it's at (1,0). Then, move up to (0,0). Yes, so that's possible.\n\nBut during the left move, all robots must be able to move left. So any robot that was in column 0 can't move left. But in the initial scenario, miny is 1, so all are in columns >=1, so moving left is valid.\n\nSimilarly, moving up after that is okay.\n\nThus, in this case, the answer is YES.\n\nAnother example: suppose the minx is 1 and miny is 0. Can we get to (0,0)?\n\nSuppose the minimal column is 0, so there is a robot already in column 0. If that robot is in row 1, then moving up would bring it to 0,0. So that works. So in this case, the answer is yes.\n\nWait, so in this scenario, minx is 1 (so there is a robot in row 1, maybe in (1,0)), then moving up would take him to (0,0). So yes.\n\nThus, the conditions are that the minimal row is 1 (so can move up to 0), and the minimal column is 0 (so that at least one is in column 0, so when moving up, that robot can reach (0,0). Similarly, if the minimal column is 1, then need to first move left to get column 0, then move up.\n\nWait, so perhaps the conditions are:\n\nEither:\n\n1. There is already a robot at (0,0) \u2192 YES.\n\nOR\n\n2. The minimal row is 1, and the minimal column is 0 \u2192 then, moving up once will bring the robot(s) in row 1 (min row is 1) to row 0, so one of those in (1,0) will be at (0,0).\n\nOR\n\n3. The minimal column is 1, and the minimal row is 0 \u2192 then moving left once brings the robot(s) in column 1 to 0, so those in (0,1) go to (0,0).\n\nOR\n\n4. The minimal row is 1 and the minimal column is 1 \u2192 so first move left (to get miny 0), then move up (so minx 0) \u2192 the robot at (1,1) would reach (0,0) after both moves.\n\nWait but how do we know that there exists a robot that can reach (0,0) through some combination?\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct condition is that the minimal row among all robots must be 0 or 1, and the minimal column must be 0 or 1, and also when considering both, there exists a path.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal row must be \u2264 1 and the minimal column must be \u2264 1. But also, the minimal row and column can be used to see if after moving towards them, they can reach (0,0).\n\nWait maybe the necessary and sufficient conditions are that the minimal row (minx) is at most 1 and the minimal column (miny) is at most 1. Because:\n\n- If minx is 0, then there's already a robot in row 0. To reach (0,0), the minimal column must also be 0. So if miny is 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, no. Suppose minx is 0 (so there is a robot in row 0), but miny is 2. Then, the robot in row 0 is at column 2. To get to (0,0), they need to move left twice. But when moving left, all robots must stay inside. So, during the first left move, the column must be at least 1. But if there are any robots in column 0, then miny would be 0. But here miny is 2. So all robots are in columns \u22652. So moving left is allowed. After first move, columns are 1 and 2. Then, move left again, to reach 0 and 1. So then the robot is at (0,0) after two moves. So in that case, even if miny was 2, but minx was 0, then maybe it can work.\n\nWait, but in this case, the minimal row is 0 (so already in row 0), but the minimal column is 2. So the robot at (0,2) can be moved left twice, but during each step, all robots must be able to move. So for the first move left (command), all robots are in columns \u22652 \u2192 moving left to 1 and 1, etc. That's okay. The second move left would move to 0 and 0, etc. So the answer would be yes. But according to my previous condition (that minx is at most 1 and miny is at most 1), that would not be the case here (miny is 2). So that condition would fail, but the actual answer is yes.\n\nHmm, so my previous approach is wrong. So that suggests that the previous line of thinking is incorrect.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe problem requires that after some commands, at least one robot is at (0,0). Each command must be valid (i.e., after moving in that direction, all robots stay within the grid).\n\nSo the steps must form a sequence where each step is a direction such that, for all current robot positions (x, y):\n\n- If direction is up: x must be \u22651 (so moving up to x-1 \u22650).\n\n- direction right: y < m-1? Or wait, moving right increases column (assuming columns are 0-based). Wait, the direction is right, so moving to the right, so column increases by 1. But the maximum column is m-1. So to not go out, the current column must be < m-1? Wait no, the column can be at m-1, but moving right would take it to m which is out. So to move right, all robots must have y < m-1?\n\nWait, the grid is n rows and m columns. Let me think of the coordinates as 0-based. So for moving directions:\n\n- Up: row decreases by 1 \u2192 must be \u22651?\n\nWait, in 0-based:\n\nMoving up from (0, y) would take it to row -1 \u2192 invalid. So moving up is only possible if all robots are in rows \u22651.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nMoving down \u2192 row increases by 1 \u2192 must not exceed n-1 \u2192 but since it's a command, the direction must be such that all robots can move. So for moving down, all current rows must be \u2264 n-2 (since row+1 <=n-1).\n\nMoving right: column increases by 1 \u2192 so columns must be \u2264 m-2.\n\nMoving left: column decreases by 1 \u2192 must be \u22651.\n\nThus, for any direction chosen, all robots must be able to move in that direction.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of directions, such that:\n\n- All the previous steps were valid.\n\n- After the sequence, at least one robot is at (0,0).\n\nHmm, this seems like we need to model all possible states of the robots' positions and see if any path leads to (0,0).\n\nBut given the constraints (n and m up to 5, and t up to 5000), perhaps this is feasible.\n\nEach test case has a certain number of robots. Let me see how many robots there can be. Since each cell can be E or R, and the field is up to 5x5=25 cells. So the number of robots can be up to 25. But tracking all possible positions of 25 robots is impossible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, the key insight is that all robots move simultaneously in the same direction each time. So any command must be such that all robots are in positions that can move in that direction.\n\nThe destination for (0,0) requires that one of the robots can reach there through some path of commands.\n\nPerhaps the minimal possible coordinates (minx and miny) must be such that:\n\nminx is the minimal row of all robots. For a robot to reach row 0, the minimal row must be at most 1? Wait, if the minimal row is 0 already, then there's a robot in row 0, but maybe not the column.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal row is <=1 and the minimal column is <=1. Let me think again with the previous example where miny was 2 and minx was 0.\n\nIn that case, the minimal column (miny) is 2. To get a robot to 0,0, the robot has to move left twice. However, the first move left would decrease the column by 1 (so to 1), then another left to 0. \n\nEach move must be valid. For the first move left (command 'left'), all robots must have column >=1. Since the minimal column was 2, all robots are at columns >=2 \u2192 columns 2,3,4 (depending on m). So moving left once to 1,2,3: all are valid. So that step is allowed. \n\nSecond move left: all robots are now in columns >=1 (since previous min was 1). So moving left again is allowed, resulting in columns 0,1,2. Thus, the robot that was in (0,2) would now be at (0,0). So in this case, even though miny was 2 (greater than 1), it's possible. Thus, the previous idea of requiring minx and miny to be <=1 is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so the problem requires more complex logic. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider all possible possible final positions of robots where one is at (0,0), and see if there exists a path from the initial positions to that state through valid moves.\n\nThe path must consist of a sequence of directions where each direction's choice is valid for the current robot positions.\n\nThe problem is to determine whether such a path exists.\n\nBut even enumerating all possibilities might be feasible given the small grid size.\n\nWait, here's another Idea:\n\nFor the robot to reach (0,0), there must exist at least one robot whose position can be adjusted via some commands to (0,0), with all steps being valid.\n\nMoreover, the path for this robot must not require any other robot to go out of bounds in any step.\n\nThus, for that robot to reach (0,0), its path must include moving up (if needed) and left (if needed), but also, all other robots must be able to move in those directions without moving out.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of each robot's possible moves as constraints.\n\nTo get a robot R to (0,0), the steps must include moving it down? No, moving up reduces row.\n\nWait, let's think of a particular robot's path. Suppose a robot starts at (x,y). To reach (0,0), it must move left (y times) and up (x times). But all other robots must also be able to move in those directions during the necessary steps.\n\nBut the order of moving matters. For example, moving left first then up, etc.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal required is that, for some robot R:\n\nThe row of R is x, so must move up x times. But during each of those up moves, all robots must be in rows >=1 (so their rows must be at least 1 before moving up).\n\nSimilarly, the column of R is y, so must move left y times. During those moves, all robots must have columns >=1 before moving left.\n\nWait, but those moves can be interleaved. So the robot R must have a path where during the steps to get to (0,0), the other robots don't block the moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the necessary conditions are:\n\nFor that particular robot R (which we are trying to get to (0,0)), its row x must be such that:\n\n- The minimal row of all robots in the initial setup is \u2264 x.\n\nWait, not sure. Maybe the following:\n\nLet's take a robot R starting at (x,y). To get it to (0,0):\n\n- It must move up exactly x times, and left exactly y times.\n\nThese moves can be in any order, but each time you give a command, all robots must be able to move in that direction without going out of bounds.\n\nThus, for the robot R's path to be possible:\n\nThe robot's x must be \u2265 0 (which it is). Also, the robot's y must be \u22650.\n\nMoreover, the other robots must allow for the necessary moves.\n\nFor each move in the path (sequence of commands), direction must be such that all robots (including others) are in positions that can move in that direction.\n\nLet me try to think in terms of the robot R's coordinates.\n\nSuppose we pick a robot R with position (x,y). Let's see if it can reach (0,0). \n\nTo do so, the following must be true:\n\nAll robots in the initial positions must be able to move:\n\n- To move left y times, in those steps where left is commanded, all robots must have their current column at least 1 before each left move.\n\nSimilarly for up moves: before each up move, all robots are in rows at least 1.\n\nBut how to find such a sequence of moves where the required directions are possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints can be expressed as:\n\nFor R's path to (0,0), the following must be true:\n\n- For all other robots, their initial x coordinate must be \u2265 R's x coordinate. Because if there is a robot with lower x (i.e., closer to row 0), then moving up would cause that robot to move beyond 0. Wait, no: moving up reduces the row. So if another robot is in row 0, then R can't move up at all \u2014 because the command to move up would require that all robots (including the one in row 0) can move up, which they can't.\n\nThus, for R to be able to move up, all robots must be in rows \u22651. So R's row must be \u22651, and all other robots must also be in rows \u22651.\n\nWait, but this is only for moving up once. To move up multiple times, the same applies each time.\n\nSo for R to move up x times (to get to 0), the following must be true:\n\n- Initially, all robots are in rows \u22651. \n\n- After each up move, the rows decrease by 1. So after first move, all are in \u22650.\n\nBut the next move can't be up again unless all are in rows \u22651 again \u2014 but after first move, some may be at 0.\n\nHmm, so that complicates things. Thus, the only way to move up x times is that the initial rows of all robots are \u2265 x, and that you can do it in x steps each time:\n\nWait, no. Suppose you have to move up x times. Each step must be an up command. Each up command requires that all robots are in rows \u22651 at the time of the command. \n\nSo first, before any up moves, all must be in rows \u22651. \n\nAfter first up move, the robots are in rows (original -1). So for the second up move, all must be in rows \u22651 again, meaning their original rows were \u22652, and after first move were \u22651. \n\nContinuing this way, after the first k up moves, all robots must have been in rows \u2265 (original row -k) \u2265 1. \n\nThus, for x up moves, all robots must have initial row \u2265 x + 0 (after 0 moves, they are \u22651 \u2192 initial rows \u22651. After 1 up move, they are \u22650. But for the second move, to be able to do that, they must have been in rows \u22652 before the second move (since after first move they are (row-1) \u22651 \u2192 so original row must be \u22652). So after 2 moves, original rows must be \u22652 +1 \u2192 original \u22652. Wait maybe the condition is that all robots are in rows \u2265 x.\n\nWait let me see: To be able to perform x up commands in a row (without any other commands in between), then each step requires that before the command, all robots are in rows \u22651, then after first, rows \u22650. But the next up command requires that all are in rows \u22651 again, so before that command, they must be at rows \u22652 (since after first command, they were at row-1, which must be \u22651 \u2192 original rows \u22652). \n\nSo to perform x up moves consecutively, the initial rows must be \u2265x. \n\nOtherwise, you can\u2019t do it all in a row. \n\nBut perhaps the commands could be interleaved with other movements.\n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that the robot's path to (0,0) requires that its initial position is such that, for all robots:\n\n- The robot's row x must be \u2265 the minimal initial row of all robots. \n\nBecause otherwise, if there is a robot with smaller initial row (i.e., closer to the top), then you can't move up enough times to get the selected robot R to row 0, because moving up would require that all other robots can move up as well, but a robot in a lower row (closer to 0) can't do so. \n\nWait, for example, if there is another robot in row 0, then you can't move up at all, because the command to move up would require that all robots (including that one) move up, which would take it to -1, which is invalid. \n\nThus, for any robot R to be able to move up, all other robots must be in rows \u2265 its row. No, that's not correct. Let me think again:\n\nSuppose R is in row 3, and another robot is in row 2. \n\nTo move R to row 0 requires moving up 3 times. \n\nFirst up move: both robots go to 2 and 1. \n\nSecond up move: they go to 1 and 0. \n\nThird up move: they go to 0 and -1 \u2192 which is invalid. So this third move can't be done.\n\nThus, in this case, even though R's minimal row is 2 (other robot at 2?), but the other robot can't move up 3 times.\n\nHence, for R to be able to move up x times, all other robots must have their initial rows \u2265 R's row. Because then their rows after moving up k times would be (Initial_row -k). \n\nWait, if all other robots' initial rows are \u2265 R's initial row (x), then after doing x up moves, all others would be in rows (initial -x) which must be \u22650. \n\nWait, for example:\n\nR is at x = 3. Another robot is at 4. \n\nAfter 3 up moves:\n\nR is at 0, the other is at 1 \u2192 valid.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nBut if another robot is at 2:\n\nAfter 3 up moves:\n\nR is 0, the other is 2 -3 = -1 \u2192 no. So that's invalid.\n\nThus, for that to work, all other robots must have initial rows \u2265 R's initial row (x). \n\nAh! So the condition is that the minimal row of all robots is exactly the row of R (since otherwise, there is a robot with a smaller row, which can't move up enough).\n\nThus, to be able to move R up x times, the minimal row of all robots must be exactly x. \n\nBecause the minimal row is the smallest initial row of any robot. So if R's row is x and the minimal row is x, then all other robots have rows >=x, so after x up moves, they'll be at rows (original -x) \u22650. \n\nThus, the robot R can be moved up x times only if the minimal row of all robots is exactly x. \n\nSimilarly for moving left: the minimal column must be exactly y (the column of R). \n\nThus, for a robot at (x,y) to be able to reach (0,0), the following must hold:\n\n- The minimal row among all robots is exactly x.\n\n- The minimal column among all robots is exactly y.\n\nThen, we can first move up x times (so all robots move up x times but not exceeding the bounds). \n\nWait, but moving up must be done in sequence. So after each move, the minimal row reduces by 1. So after first up move, the minimal row would be x-1. \n\nWait this contradicts the previous statement. \n\nHmm, this suggests a problem with the reasoning.\n\nWait, the minimal row must be exactly x (the R's row). So if we have another robot at row x, but also another robot at x+1, then their rows are all >=x. \n\nAfter first up move, all robots are reduced by 1. So the minimal row becomes x-1 (since R is now at x-1, and others are x, x+1-1 \u2192 x and x. \n\nWait the new minimal row is x-1. \n\nSo after x up moves, the minimal row would be x -x =0. \n\nThus, after all x moves, R would be at row 0. \n\nMeanwhile, all other robots would be at (original -x). Since their original rows were >=x, then (original -x) is >=0. \n\nThus, all moves are valid.\n\nSimilarly, for moving left y times: the minimal column must be exactly y (R's column), so that after moving left y times, all columns are (original -y) \u22650.\n\n Thus, the conditions for R being able to move to (0,0) are:\n\n- Its initial row x must be equal to the minimal row of all robots.\n\n- Its initial column y must be equal to the minimal column of all robots.\n\nAdditionally, after moving up x times and left y times, the robot R will be at (0,0).\n\nThus, if there's any robot for which these conditions are met, then the answer is YES.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each test case, find the minimal row (min_x) and minimal column (min_y) among all robots.\n\nThen, check whether there exists a robot whose (row, column) is (min_x, min_y). Because then, this robot can be moved (up min_x times and left min_y times), provided that all other robots are in rows \u2265 min_x and columns \u2265 min_y. \n\nWait, yes exactly. \n\nBecause the minimal row is the minimal among all robots, so all other robots are in rows \u2265 min_x. \n\nSimilarly for columns. \n\nThus, for such a robot (the one at (min_x, min_y)), the required conditions are satisfied. \n\nThus, if there exists at least one robot at (min_x, min_y), then the answer is YES. Otherwise, it's NO.\n\nWait, this makes sense.\n\nLet me test this with some examples:\n\nExample 1 from notes: first test case. Let's say the robot is at (0,1). \n\nmin_x is 0 (since that's the minimal row), min_y is 1 (since the robot's column is 1, and that's the minimal).\n\nThus, the robot at (0,1) is at (min_x, min_y) (0,1). \n\nSo according to the condition, we can move left once (min_y is 1). So moving left once takes it to (0,0), and since other robots (if any) have columns \u22651. So that's valid. Hence output is YES.\n\nSecond test case (where any move causes explosion): suppose the robots are in positions like (0,0) and (0,1). Wait no, the second test case example says that any move causes some robot to explode. So perhaps the robots are arranged such that their minimal row is 0 and minimal column is 0. But there's a robot in (0,0). So according to the condition, since the robot is there already, the answer would be YES, but the note says the second test case can't reach. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example.\n\nWait the note says: \"in the second test case, if you try to send any command, at least one robot explodes.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps in that case, the minimal row and column are 0, but all robots are in such positions that any command would cause some robot to move out. \n\nWait maybe the robots are at (0,0) and (0,1). \n\nThen the minimal row is 0, minimal column is 0.\n\nThere is a robot at (0,0). So the condition would say 'YES', but according to the note, it is impossible. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe I need to re-examine the note. \n\nThe second test case example: \"if you try to send any command, at least one robot explodes.\"\n\nSuppose their positions are such that any direction will make at least one robot explode. \n\nFor example, suppose there are two robots at (0,0) and (0,1). \n\nIf you send move left, then the robot at (0,0) can't move left (column becomes -1 \u2192 explodes). \n\nIf you send move up (but row 0 can't move up), so that direction is invalid. \n\nMove down would require that all robots can move down. The robot at (0,0) can move down to row 1 (if n>1?), but the command can be given only if all can move. \n\nWait, if n is 1 (only one row), then moving down would take to row 1 which is out of bounds. \n\nSo in that case, if the test case has n=1 and m=2, with robots at (0,0) and (0,1), then any command would be invalid except left (which causes explosion of (0,0)), right (causes (0,1) to move to 2 (if m=2, then max column is 1 \u2192 moving right to 2 would be out of bounds. \n\nThus, any command is invalid. So the answer is NO. \n\nBut according to our condition, since there is a robot at (0,0), the minimal row and column are 0 and 0. Thus, the robot is there, so the answer should be YES. \n\nBut in the test case, the output is NO. \n\nAh, so there's a contradiction. \n\nThis suggests that my condition is wrong. \n\nSo where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Because the robot is already at (0,0). So we can choose to send zero commands. Thus, the output should be YES. \n\nBut according to the note's second test case, the output is NO. \n\nHmm, that implies that the second test case must be different. \n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"in the second test case, if you try to send any command, at least one robot explodes.\"\n\nBut the problem statement requires that at least one robot reaches the corner without any robot exploding. The zero command sequence (no moves) is allowed. So if a robot is already in (0,0), then the answer is YES, regardless of other robots. Because the zero command sequence achieves it. \n\nThus the second test case must not have any robot in (0,0). \n\nAh, so maybe the second test case has robots like (0,1) and (1,0). \n\nThen the minimal row is 0 (from the robot at (0,1)), minimal column is 0 (from robot at (1,0)). \n\nThus, the minimal x is 0, minimal y is 0. \n\nThere is no robot at (0,0). \n\nThus, according to the condition, there is no robot at (min_x, min_y) \u2192 so the answer is NO, which matches the note. \n\nAh, right! \n\nThus, in the first scenario I thought of (robot at (0,0) and (0,1)), the answer should be YES. Because the zero command sequence works. \n\nSo my condition requires that there is a robot at (min_x,min_y). \n\nIn the case where there is a robot at (0,0), then the min_x and min_y are 0 and 0, so that robot is there. Thus the answer is yes. \n\nSo the second test case must not have any robot at (0,0). \n\nThus, the condition is correct. \n\nSo the correct approach is: \n\nWe compute the minimal row (min_x) and minimal column (min_y) among all robots. \n\nThen, check whether there exists at least one robot in the cell (min_x, min_y). \n\nIf yes \u2192 then that robot can be moved to (0,0) by doing up min_x times and left min_y times, provided all other robots can move in those steps. \n\nWait, but the other robots can move, since their rows are >= min_x and columns >= min_y. \n\nThus, the sequence of commands can be:\n\n- For each of the min_x times, move up \u2192 each step is valid because all robots are at rows >= current_min_x (which starts at min_x, then decreases each step). \n\nWait, let me think. Initially, all robots are in rows >= min_x. \n\nFirst up move: all robots' rows decrease by 1 \u2192 new min_x becomes (min_x-1). \n\nRepeat until min_x reaches 0.\n\nSimilarly for left moves. \n\nThus, the commands can be done sequentially. \n\nThus, the condition is correct. \n\nSo the steps to solve the problem:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Find min_x as the minimal row of all robots' rows. \n\n- Find min_y as the minimal column of all robots' columns. \n\n- Check if any robot is located at (min_x, min_y). \n\nIf yes \u2192 output YES. \n\nOtherwise \u2192 NO. \n\nThis is the condition. \n\nNow, how does this fit into the given code?\n\nLooking at the code:\n\nThe input function has variables minx[i] and miny[i], initialized to 5 (since n and m can be up to 5, so rows and columns are 0-based up to 4). \n\nThe code iterates over each character. For 'R', the current code is in the 'else' block (the R case). \n\nThe TODO is there. \n\nThe idea is to track the minx and miny for each test case. \n\nSo, in the loop where we read the grid for each test case, whenever we find a robot (c is 'R'), we need to update minx[i] and miny[i]. \n\nThe initial minx[i] and miny[i] are set to 5 (a value larger than possible). \n\nThus, for each 'R' at (j,k):\n\nminx[i] = min( minx[i], j )\n\nminy[i] = min( miny[i], k )\n\nThus, after reading all rows for a test case, minx[i] will be the minimal row with a robot, and miny[i] the minimal column. \n\nThen, after this, we need to check if there is any robot at (minx[i], miny[i]). \n\nThe current output function checks if a[i][minx[i]][miny[i]] ==1. \n\nAh! So the a array is storing whether there's a robot there (1 for robot, 0 for E). \n\nThus, the code currently has a 3D array a[i][j][k], where for each test case i, j is row, k is column, and a[i][j][k] is 1 if there's a robot, else 0. \n\nThus, in the 'else' block (when c is 'R'), we should set a[i][j][k] to 1. \n\nSo the first missing code is to set a[i][j][k] =1. \n\nThen, in the output function, the code checks a[i][minx[i]][miny[i]] ==1 \u2192 which is exactly what we need. \n\nThus, the code is almost correct except that in the 'else' block for 'R', they didn't set the a array to 1, and also perhaps in the input function, the minx and miny are not being updated. \n\nWait looking at the code in the input function:\n\nInside the loop over the rows and columns for each test case:\n\nfor(int j=0;j<n[i];j++)\n\n    for(int k=0;k<m[i];k++)\n\n    {\n\n        cin>>c;\n\n        if(c=='E') a[i][j][k] =0;\n\n        else\n\n        {\n\n            // TODO: set a[i][j][k] to 1.\n\n            // also need to update minx and miny here.\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\nWait, the current code has minx and miny initialized to 5, but in the loop, when R is found, they are not updated. So the code as given is incomplete. \n\nAh! The code's current input function does not update the minx and miny for each 'R' found. \n\nThus, the missing code is both setting a[i][j][k] =1, and also updating minx and miny. \n\nThus, the code inside the 'else' block (for 'R') should do:\n\na[i][j][k] =1;\n\nif (j < minx[i]) minx[i] = j;\n\nif (k < miny[i]) miny[i] = k;\n\nThus, this is what needs to be filled in the TODO block. \n\nThen, the output function checks whether the cell (minx[i], miny[i]) has a robot (since a[i][minx[i]][miny[i]] is 1). \n\nThus, the code will work correctly. \n\nSo the missing code in the TODO block is:\n\na[i][j][k] = 1;\n\nif (j < minx[i]) minx[i] = j;\n\nif (k < miny[i]) miny[i] = k;\n\nThus, that is the code to fill in the else block. \n\nI think that's all. Let me verify with the examples. \n\nFirst test case example (robot at (0,1)):\n\nminx is 0, miny is 1. The cell (0,1) has a robot \u2192 so the output is YES. \n\nSecond test case (assuming minx and miny are 0 and 0 but no robot there \u2192 output NO). \n\nThird test case: robot at (0, 2), and others? For example, if miny is 2 and there's a robot there \u2192 yes. \n\nFourth test case: robot already at (0,0) \u2192 yes. \n\nYes, this seems to handle all cases. \n\nSo the missing code is three lines: setting a to 1, and updating minx and miny as needed."
