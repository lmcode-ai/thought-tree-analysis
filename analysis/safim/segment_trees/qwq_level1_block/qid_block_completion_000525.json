So in the third example's case, when x=3 and y=3, the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items. The best choice is the three most expensive items (5,5,3). The three cheapest in that subset are all of them, so their sum is 5+5+3=13. But the note says the answer is 6. That's conflicting. Wait, the note's third example says the answer is 6. So perhaps the example's input is different. Let me see the note's third example's explanation: \"the customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\" So in that case, the items must be such that when you take all items (say 5 items), the three cheapest are 1,2,3. But if you take the top 3 items (like 5,5,3), then the three cheapest would be 3,5,5, sum 13. So why is the answer 6? That suggests that the problem requires that the subset must have exactly x items. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. Problem statement says: \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free.\" So the customer can choose any subset of size >=x. The maximum sum of the y cheapest in that subset. So the customer will choose the subset (size >=x) that maximizes the sum of the y cheapest in it. So in the third example's case, the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items.

Wait, maybe the problem requires that the customer must buy exactly x items. Because otherwise, the note's example can't be explained. Because in that case, when x=3, the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items, which would give a better sum. Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the customer must buy exactly x items. Because the note's third example's answer is 6, which comes from buying all items (5 items) when x=3. But that would mean that the customer can choose to buy more than x items, but in that case, the sum is worse. So why would they choose that? This suggests that perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again. The problem says: \"the y cheapest of them are free\".

So the customer can choose to buy exactly x items, or more. But the customer will choose whichever gives the maximum sum. So in the third example's case, the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items (the top 3) and get a sum of 13, which is better than buying all 5 items (sum 6). So why is the note's answer 6? This suggests that perhaps the problem's note is using a different input. Let me think of the third example's input. Suppose the items are [5,4,3,2,1]. Then, for x=3 and y=3, the best subset is the top 3 (5,4,3), sum of the three cheapest (3,4,5) is 12. But the note's answer is 6. Alternatively, maybe the items are [5, 3, 2, 1, 4]. Then the top 3 are 5,4,3. The three cheapest in that subset are 3,4,5 sum 12. Hmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should proceed with the solution and see.",

So subtracting them from the total gives the sum of the remaining y elements (the smallest in the first x). So the formula is sum = pre[x] - pre[x - y]. Wait, let me see with the first example: \n\npre[3] = 5+5+3 =13 \n\npre[3-2=1] =5 \n\nso 13-5=8. Correct. Second example: x=2, y=1. \n\npre[2] =5+5=10 \n\npre[2-1=1] =5 \n\n10-5=5. Correct. Third example: if the third example's input is such that when x=3 and y=3, the sum is 6, then the first three elements must sum to 6. So pre[3] - pre[0] (since x - y =0) would be pre[3] - pre[0] = pre[3]. So pre[3] must be 6. \n\nWhich would mean that the first three elements sum to 6. So the first three elements must be 3,2,1. Ah! So the items must be sorted in descending order as [5,5,3,2,1]. Wait no, that would give first three elements 5+5+3=13. Wait, perhaps the items are [3,2,1,5,5]. Then sorted in descending order would be 5,5,3,2,1. Then for x=3, the first three are 5,5,3. Sum is 13. Hmm, I'm confused. Alternatively, maybe the third example's input is different. Let me think of the third example's note explanation: \n\n\"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\" So the three cheapest items in the entire set are 1,2,3. So the entire set must have those three as the three cheapest. Suppose the items are [5,4,3,2,1]. Then the three cheapest are 1,2,3. If the query is x=3, y=3, then the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items. The best is to take the top 3 (5,4,3). The three cheapest in that subset are 3,4,5. Sum is 12. But the note says the answer is 6. So that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the items are [3,2,1,5,4]. Then sorted descending is 5,4,3,2,1. The first three are 5,4,3. Sum of three cheapest (3,4,5) is 12. Hmm.",

Yes, so the code appends a newline each time. So that's the code to be filled in. Now, checking for possible errors. Wait, the code uses an ArrayList a, which is sorted in reverse order (descending).

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem carefully again. \n\nThe task is, for each query (x, y), determine the maximum total value of items received for free. The promotion is: if a customer buys at least x items, then the y cheapest ones among them are free. So, to maximize the total free value, the customer will buy exactly x items (since buying more than x doesn't help because the y cheapest of those x are already considered). Wait, actually, buying more than x items would allow them to pick the y cheapest among all those items, but maybe that's better. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free.\" So the customer can buy more than x items, but the y cheapest in the entire purchase are free. To maximize the free amount, the customer would want to choose as many items as possible, but since the query parameters are x and y, the minimum required is x. However, the optimal strategy would be to buy exactly x items. Because if you buy more than x, say x + k items, then you can choose the y cheapest among those x +k, but maybe those y could be even cheaper if you pick a different set. Wait, but the problem is to choose the best possible purchase for each query. So the customer will choose the set of items that maximizes the sum of the y cheapest in the set, given that the set size is at least x. \n\nWait, but to maximize the sum of the y cheapest, the best way is to select the x items where the y cheapest among them are as large as possible. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me think: the customer wants to select a subset of items of size at least x, and then get the sum of the y cheapest in that subset. To maximize this sum, the customer would choose exactly x items (since adding more items might include cheaper ones which could lower the y-th cheapest). Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose you have to choose at least x items. The y cheapest in the subset are the ones that contribute to the sum. To maximize the sum, you want those y items to be as expensive as possible. So, the optimal strategy is to choose exactly x items, and among those x, the y cheapest (i.e., the smallest y in those x) would be the ones to sum. Because if you take more than x items, the y cheapest in the larger set might include even cheaper items, which would reduce the sum. So the best is to pick exactly x items, and among those, take the y smallest (since those are the ones that are free). Wait, but the y cheapest in the x items would be the sum of the y smallest in those x. To maximize that sum, you want those y to be as large as possible. So how do you choose the x items such that their y smallest elements are as large as possible?\n\nAlternatively, the problem reduces to selecting x items, and then taking the sum of the y smallest among them. To maximize this sum, the best way is to choose the x items with the highest possible values, but then among those, the y smallest would be the y-th smallest in the x items. Wait, perhaps the optimal approach is to pick the x most expensive items. Because then, the y cheapest among them would be the y smallest in that group, which are still the largest possible possible for the y-th position. \n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose the items are [5,5,3,1,2], sorted in descending order: 5,5,3,2,1. \n\nSuppose a query is x=3, y=2. Then, the best is to pick the top 3 items: 5,5,3. The two cheapest are 3 and 5 (wait, no, sorted they are 5,5,3. The cheapest two are 3 and 5, sum is 8. Which matches the first example's note. \n\nAnother example: if x=2 and y=1, then the best is to take the top 2 items (5 and5), the cheapest is 5, sum is 5. Which matches the second note. \n\nThird example: x=3, y=3. The customer must buy at least 3 items. To get the sum of the 3 cheapest, which would be the sum of all three if they take exactly 3. But in the note, the third query's answer is 6, which comes from taking all 5 items (since x=3, but they take all 5, so the 3 cheapest are 1,2,3, sum 6). Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, in the third example's note, the input must have been the items [5,3,1,2, ...? Let me see the note's third example: the third query's answer is 6, which comes from 1+2+3. So the items must include 1,2,3,5,5. So when x=3 and y=3, the customer can buy all 5 items. The three cheapest among them are 1,2,3, sum 6. But if they had chosen exactly 3 items, the best would be the top 3 (5,5,3), the three cheapest would be 3,5,5? Wait no, the three items would be 5,5,3. The three cheapest are all of them, so sum is 13. But the note says the answer is 6. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the note says in the third query, the customer has to buy all items to get the three cheapest. So that implies that when x=3 and y=3, the customer can choose to buy all items (since that's allowed as it's at least x=3). Then the three cheapest in all items are 1,2,3, sum 6. But if they had chosen exactly 3 items, like the top 3 (5,5,3), then the three cheapest would be 3,5,5, sum 13, which is better. But the note's answer is 6. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the note.\n\nThe note says: In the third query, the customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total is 1+2+3=6. Wait, that suggests that when x=3 and y=3, the customer must buy all items. But why? Because if they buy exactly 3 items, they can choose the three most expensive (like 5,5,3), then the three cheapest (all of them) sum to 5+5+3=13. So why is the answer 6? That must mean that in that case, the example's input is different. Let me see the note's example again. The first example's note says the first query is x=3, y=2, and the items chosen are 5,3,5 (sum of two cheapest is 3+5=8). The third example's note says the third query's answer is 6, which comes from 1+2+3. So perhaps the items in the example are [5,3,1,2,5], sorted in reverse order would be 5,5,3,2,1. So when x=3 and y=3, the customer can choose to buy all 5 items. The three cheapest in those 5 are 1,2,3, sum 6. But if they choose exactly 3 items, like the top 3 (5,5,3), then the three cheapest are 3,5,5, sum 13. So why is the answer 6? That suggests that the problem requires that when you buy exactly x items, you get the y cheapest of them. But in that case, the third example's answer would be 13, but the note says 6. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free.\" So the customer can choose to buy any number of items >=x, and then the y cheapest in that purchase are free. The customer wants to maximize the sum of those y items. So the customer will choose the subset of size >=x that maximizes the sum of the y cheapest in that subset. \n\nSo in the third example's case, when x=3 and y=3, the customer can choose to buy all 5 items. The three cheapest in those 5 are 1,2,3, sum 6. Alternatively, if they choose to buy exactly 3 items, the best would be the top 3 (5,5,3). The three cheapest in those are 3,5,5, sum 13. So why is the answer 6? That contradicts. Wait, the note says the third query's answer is 6, so that must mean that in that case, the customer is forced to take the three cheapest items. Wait, perhaps I have the problem backwards. Wait, the y cheapest items are the ones that are free. So the customer wants to maximize the sum of the free items. To do that, they want the sum of the y cheapest items in their purchase to be as large as possible. Wait, no! Wait, the free items are the y cheapest. So the customer wants to maximize the sum of the y cheapest items in their purchase. Because those are the ones they get for free. So to maximize the free amount, they need to have those y items as expensive as possible. \n\nAh! So the problem is to choose a subset of size at least x, such that the sum of the y cheapest items in that subset is as large as possible. \n\nSo in the third example's case, when x=3 and y=3, the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items. The best choice is the three most expensive items (5,5,3). The three cheapest in that subset are all of them, so their sum is 5+5+3=13. But the note says the answer is 6. That's conflicting. Wait, the note's third example says the answer is 6. So perhaps the example's input is different. Let me see the note's third example's explanation: \"the customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\" So in that case, the items must be such that when you take all items (say 5 items), the three cheapest are 1,2,3. But if you take the top 3 items (like 5,5,3), then the three cheapest would be 3,5,5, sum 13. So why is the answer 6? That suggests that the problem requires that the subset must have exactly x items. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nProblem statement says: \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free.\" So the customer can choose any subset of size >=x. The maximum sum of the y cheapest in that subset. So the customer will choose the subset (size >=x) that maximizes the sum of the y cheapest in it. \n\nSo in the third example's case, the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items. The best is to pick the top 3 (5,5,3). The three cheapest in that subset are 3,5,5, sum 13. But the note says the answer is 6. So that must mean that in that example, the items are different. Let me think again. The note's third example's explanation says the three cheapest are 1,2,3. So the items must include those. So perhaps the items are [5,5,3,2,1]. So when the customer buys all 5 items (since x=3, they can buy 5), the three cheapest are 1,2,3, sum 6. But if they choose to buy exactly 3 items, the best is to take the top 3 (5,5,3), which gives sum 13. So why is the answer 6? That would only be the case if the problem requires that the subset must be exactly x items. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nAh! Wait, the problem says \"the y cheapest of them are free\". So the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. To maximize the sum of the free items, the customer wants those y items to be as expensive as possible. So the optimal strategy is to choose a subset of size exactly x, and select the x most expensive items. Because then, the y cheapest in that subset are the y smallest among the x largest items. Which would be the best possible. \n\nWait, let's see the third example. Suppose the items are [5,5,3,2,1]. The x is 3, y is 3. The best subset is the top 3 items (5,5,3). The three cheapest in that subset are 3,5,5. Sum is 13. But the note says the answer is 6. So that's conflicting. Therefore, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me check the note again. \n\nThe note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\" So in that case, the three cheapest items in the entire set (all items) are 1,2,3. So the customer is choosing to buy all items (since x=3, buying 5 is allowed). But why would that be better than buying exactly 3 items? Because in that case, the three cheapest in the 5 items are 1,2,3, sum 6, which is worse than 13. So why would the customer choose that? That can't be. So there must be a mistake in my understanding. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires that when you buy at least x items, you get the y cheapest items for free. So the customer wants to maximize the sum of the free items. So the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. To maximize that sum, you want those y items to be as expensive as possible. So the best way is to choose the subset of exactly x items, which are the x most expensive items. Because then the y cheapest in those x items are the y smallest among the x largest items, which are as large as possible. \n\nIn the third example's case, the x is 3, y is 3. The top 3 items are 5,5,3. The three cheapest in that subset are 3,5,5. Sum is 13. But the note says the answer is 6. So that suggests that the problem requires that the subset must have exactly x items. But the note's example contradicts that. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's note is using a different input. Let me think again. Maybe the items in the third example are [5,3,1,2, ...], but perhaps the items are [5,3,1,2,4]. Wait, maybe the items are sorted in a way that when you take all items (5 items), the three cheapest are 1,2,3. But that would require that the items include 1,2,3, and two higher numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's note is correct, and I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the note's third example. The note says the third query's answer is 6, which comes from buying all items. So the three cheapest in the entire set (all items) are 1,2,3. So the total is 6. But if the customer chooses to buy exactly 3 items, the best would be the top 3 (like 5,5,3), which gives a sum of 13. So why is the answer 6? That can only be the case if the problem requires that the subset must have exactly x items. But the problem statement says \"at least x items\". \n\nWait, maybe I have the problem backwards. The free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. To maximize the sum of the free items, you want those y items to be as expensive as possible. So the best way is to choose the subset of exactly x items, which are the x most expensive items. Because then the y cheapest in that subset are the y smallest among the x largest items. \n\nIn the third example's case, the x is 3, so the subset is the top 3 items (5,5,3). The three cheapest in that subset are 3,5,5. Sum is 13. But the note says the answer is 6. So that's conflicting. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the customer must buy exactly x items. Because otherwise, the note's third example can't be explained. Let me re-read the problem statement again. \n\nProblem statement says: \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free. The management has not yet decided on the exact values of x and y. Therefore, they ask you to process q queries: for the given values of x and y, determine the maximum total value of items received for free, if a customer makes one purchase. Note that all queries are independent; they don't affect the store's stock.\"\n\nAh! The key is that the customer can choose to buy any number of items >=x. So the customer will choose the subset of size >=x that maximizes the sum of the y cheapest items in that subset. \n\nWait, but in the third example, the note says that the customer has to buy all items to get the three cheapest (sum 6). But that would only be better if the subset of all items gives a higher sum than subsets of size exactly x. \n\nWait, in the third example's case, the items must be such that when you take all items (say 5 items), the three cheapest are 1,2,3 (sum 6). But if you take the top 3 items (like 5,5,3), then the three cheapest in that subset are 3,5,5 (sum 13). So why would the answer be 6? That can't be. So perhaps the items in the example are different. Let me think of the example's input. \n\nThe note's first example's explanation says the first query is x=3, y=2, and the items chosen are 5,3,5 (sum of two cheapest is 3+5=8). So the items must include at least two 5s and a 3. \n\nThe third example's explanation says the third query's answer is 6, which comes from 1+2+3. So the items must include 1,2,3, and perhaps two 5s. So the items are [5,5,3,2,1]. \n\nNow, for the third query (x=3, y=3), the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items. The best is to take the top 3 (5,5,3). The three cheapest in that subset are 3,5,5, sum 13. But the note says the answer is 6. So that's a contradiction. \n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's note. Let me read the note again. \n\nThe note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\" \n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem requires that the customer must buy exactly x items. Because otherwise, the note's example can't be explained. Because in that case, when x=3, the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items, which would give a better sum. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the customer must buy exactly x items. Because the note's third example's answer is 6, which comes from buying all items (5 items) when x=3. But that would mean that the customer can choose to buy more than x items, but in that case, the sum is worse. So why would they choose that? \n\nThis suggests that perhaps I have a misunderstanding of the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again. \n\nThe problem says: \"the y cheapest of them are free\". So the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. To maximize the sum of those free items, the customer wants those y items to be as expensive as possible. \n\nSo the optimal strategy is to choose a subset of size exactly x, consisting of the x most expensive items. Because then, the y cheapest in that subset are the y smallest among the x largest items, which are as large as possible. \n\nIn the third example's case, the x is 3, so the subset is the top 3 items (5,5,3). The three cheapest in that subset are 3,5,5. Sum is 13. But the note says the answer is 6. So that's conflicting. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the y cheapest items are the y smallest in the entire list, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have the problem's parameters reversed. Like, perhaps the y most expensive items are free. But the problem says the y cheapest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the customer must buy exactly x items. Because then, in the third example, the customer can't choose to buy more than x. \n\nWait, the problem says \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free\". So the customer can choose to buy exactly x items, or more. But the customer will choose whichever gives the maximum sum. \n\nSo in the third example's case, the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items (the top 3) and get a sum of 13, which is better than buying all 5 items (sum 6). So why is the note's answer 6? \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem's note is using a different input. Let me think of the third example's input. \n\nSuppose the items are [5,4,3,2,1]. Then, for x=3 and y=3, the best subset is the top 3 (5,4,3), sum of the three cheapest (3,4,5) is 12. But the note's answer is 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the items are [5, 3, 2, 1, 4]. Then the top 3 are 5,4,3. The three cheapest in that subset are 3,4,5 sum 12. \n\nHmm, I'm confused. Maybe I should proceed with the solution and see. \n\nThe problem requires for each query (x,y), find the maximum sum of the y cheapest items in a subset of size at least x. \n\nThe optimal approach is to choose the subset of exactly x items, which are the x most expensive items. Because adding more items would introduce cheaper items which could lower the y-th cheapest in the subset. \n\nWait, let's think of it this way: To maximize the sum of the y cheapest items in the subset, the subset should be the x most expensive items. Because then, the y cheapest in that subset are the y smallest among the x largest items. \n\nSo the sum would be the sum of the first y items in the sorted list of the x most expensive items. \n\nWait, let me think of the items sorted in non-increasing order. \n\nSuppose the items are sorted in descending order: p1 >= p2 >= ... >= pn. \n\nFor a query (x,y), the best subset is the first x items. The y cheapest in this subset are the items at positions x - y +1 to x? Wait, no. The y cheapest in the first x items are the last y items in the first x. Because the first x items are the largest. So the y cheapest among them are the y smallest in those x, which are the x-th, x-1-th, etc. \n\nWait, the first x items are sorted in descending order. The y cheapest among them are the last y elements. So the sum would be the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements. \n\nWait, for example, if the first x elements are [5,5,3], then the y=2 cheapest are 3 and 5 (the two smallest in the subset). So their sum is 8. Which matches the first example's note. \n\nSimilarly, for the third example's case, if the first 3 elements are [5,5,3], then the y=3 cheapest are all three, sum 13. But the note says 6. So that suggests that the third example's input must have different values. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the subset must have exactly x items. Because then, the answer would be the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements. \n\nSo the approach is: \n\nSort the array in non-decreasing order? Wait no, in non-increasing order. \n\nSort the array in descending order. \n\nThen, for a query (x,y), the maximum sum is the sum of the y smallest elements in the first x elements. \n\nThe y smallest elements in the first x elements are the last y elements of the first x elements. \n\nSo the sum is the sum of the elements from position (x - y) to (x-1) in the sorted array (assuming 0-based). \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose the array is sorted in descending order. \n\nThe first x elements are the x largest. \n\nThe y cheapest among them are the y smallest in those x, which are the last y elements in the first x elements. \n\nSo the sum is the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements. \n\nSo to compute this efficiently, we can precompute a prefix sum array. \n\nWait, but the array is sorted in descending order. \n\nLet me think of the array as sorted in non-increasing order. \n\nThe first element is the largest, the second next, etc. \n\nThe first x elements are the x largest. \n\nThe y cheapest among them are the last y elements in those x elements. \n\nSo the sum is the sum of the elements from index (x - y) to (x-1) in the array. \n\nWait, let's see with the first example. \n\nFirst example's first query: x=3, y=2. \n\nThe first 3 elements are 5,5,3. The last 2 elements are 5 and 3. Sum is 8. Which matches the note. \n\nSecond example: x=2, y=1. The first two elements are 5 and5. The last 1 is 5. Sum is 5. \n\nThird example: x=3, y=3. The first three elements are 5,5,3. The last 3 elements are all of them. Sum is 13. But the note says 6. So this suggests that the third example's input is different. \n\nHmm, perhaps the third example's input has the items sorted as [5,3,2,1, ...]. Let me see. \n\nWait, maybe the items are [5,3,2,1,4]. Then sorted in descending order would be 5,4,3,2,1. \n\nThen for x=3, the first three are 5,4,3. The y=3 sum is 5+4+3=12. Still not 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the items are [5,3,1,2,4]. Then sorted descending is 5,4,3,2,1. \n\nx=3, y=3: first three are 5,4,3. Sum is 12. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the solution and see. \n\nThe approach is: \n\nSort the array in non-increasing order. \n\nCompute a prefix sum array. \n\nWait, but the sum of the last y elements in the first x elements. \n\nWait, the first x elements are sorted in descending order. The last y elements are the y smallest in them. \n\nThe sum of those y elements is equal to the sum of the first x elements minus the sum of the first (x - y) elements. \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nsum of first x elements: S[x] \n\nsum of first (x - y) elements: S[x - y] \n\nso the difference is S[x] - S[x - y]. \n\nYes! Because the first (x - y) elements are the largest in the first x elements. So subtracting them from the total gives the sum of the remaining y elements (the smallest in the first x). \n\nSo the formula is sum = pre[x] - pre[x - y]. \n\nWait, let me see with the first example: \n\npre[3] = 5+5+3 =13 \n\npre[3-2=1] =5 \n\nso 13-5=8. Correct. \n\nSecond example: x=2, y=1. \n\npre[2] =5+5=10 \n\npre[2-1=1] =5 \n\n10-5=5. Correct. \n\nThird example: if the third example's input is such that when x=3 and y=3, the sum is 6, then the first three elements must sum to 6. \n\nSo pre[3] - pre[0] (since x - y =0) would be pre[3] - pre[0] = pre[3]. So pre[3] must be 6. \n\nWhich would mean that the first three elements sum to 6. \n\nSo the first three elements must be 3,2,1. \n\nAh! So the items must be sorted in descending order as [5,5,3,2,1]. Wait no, that would give first three elements 5+5+3=13. \n\nWait, perhaps the items are [3,2,1,5,5]. Then sorted in descending order would be 5,5,3,2,1. \n\nThen for x=3, the first three are 5,5,3. Sum is 13. \n\nHmm, I'm confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third example's input is different. Let me think of the third example's note explanation: \n\n\"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\" \n\nSo the three cheapest items in the entire set are 1,2,3. So the entire set must have those three as the three cheapest. \n\nSuppose the items are [5,4,3,2,1]. Then the three cheapest are 1,2,3. \n\nIf the query is x=3, y=3, then the customer can choose to buy exactly 3 items. The best is to take the top 3 (5,4,3). The three cheapest in that subset are 3,4,5. Sum is 12. \n\nBut the note says the answer is 6. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the items are [3,2,1,5,4]. Then sorted descending is 5,4,3,2,1. \n\nThe first three are 5,4,3. Sum of three cheapest (3,4,5) is 12. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the subset must have exactly x items. So the customer can't choose to buy more than x. \n\nIn that case, for the third example's case, the customer must buy exactly 3 items. The best subset is the top 3, sum 13. But the note says 6. \n\nThis is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the formula reversed. Maybe the sum is the sum of the first y elements in the first x elements. \n\nWait, no. Because the first elements are the largest. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires the y most expensive items to be free. But the problem says the y cheapest. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the customer must buy exactly x items, and the y cheapest in those x. \n\nIn that case, the formula is correct. \n\nBut the third example's note must have a different input. \n\nPerhaps the third example's input has n=5, and the items are [5,3,1,2,4]. \n\nWait, sorted descending: 5,4,3,2,1. \n\nx=3, y=3. \n\nThe first three are 5,4,3. The three cheapest are 3,4,5. Sum is 12. \n\nBut the note says 6. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the items are [3,2,1,5,4]. \n\nSorted descending:5,4,3,2,1. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the solution and see. \n\nThe approach is: \n\nSort the array in non-increasing order. \n\nCompute a prefix sum array. \n\nFor each query (x,y), the answer is pre[x] - pre[x - y]. \n\nBecause the first x elements are the x largest. The y cheapest among them are the last y elements, which sum to pre[x] - pre[x - y]. \n\nSo the code needs to sort the array in descending order, compute the prefix sum, and for each query, compute that. \n\nNow, looking at the code provided: \n\nThe code reads the array, sorts it in reverse order (descending). \n\nThen computes a prefix sum array pre, where pre[i] is the sum of the first i elements. \n\nWait, in the code: \n\npre[0] =0 \n\npre[1] = a.get(0) \n\npre[2] = a.get(0)+a.get(1), etc. \n\nYes. \n\nSo for a query x and y, the answer is pre[x] - pre[x - y]. \n\nSo the code inside the while loop (for each query) should read x and y, then compute that. \n\nWait, but what if x - y is negative? \n\nBut the problem constraints say 1 <= y <=x <=n. So x - y >=0. \n\nSo the code can proceed. \n\nNow, looking at the code given: \n\nThe code has a loop for q queries. Inside the loop, the TODO is there. \n\nThe code needs to read x and y, compute the value, append to the ans string. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\nRead the x and y from the input. \n\nThen compute pre[x] - pre[x - y]. \n\nAppend that to the ans. \n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are stored as x and y. \n\nWait, the code's variables: \n\nIn the code, the variables are stored as x and y? Let me see. \n\nThe code reads the query lines as: \n\nEach query line has two integers x_i and y_i. \n\nSo inside the while loop: \n\nWe need to read the two numbers. \n\nSo inside the loop: \n\nString[] parts = br.readLine().split(\" \"); \n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]); \n\nint y = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); \n\nlong res = pre[x] - pre[x - y]; \n\nans.append(res + \"\\n\"); \n\nWait, but the code uses a StringBuilder ans, so appending with newlines. \n\nWait, the problem's output requires each query's answer on a separate line. \n\nSo the code should read each query line, process, and append the result followed by a newline. \n\nSo the missing code inside the while loop is: \n\nString[] parts = br.readLine().split(\" \"); \n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]); \n\nint y = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); \n\nlong res = pre[x] - pre[x - y]; \n\nans.append(res + \"\\n\"); \n\nWait, but in the code provided, the variables are named x and y. But in the code, the loop variable is q, which is being decremented. \n\nWait, the code's variables: \n\nThe code has a loop: while(q-->0) { ... } \n\nInside that loop, the code needs to read the x and y for the query. \n\nSo the code inside the loop should be: \n\nString[] parts = br.readLine().split(\" \"); \n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]); \n\nint y = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); \n\nlong res = pre[x] - pre[x - y]; \n\nans.append(res + \"\\n\"); \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a scanner, but the code uses BufferedReader. \n\nYes, the code uses BufferedReader. \n\nSo the code inside the loop is as above. \n\nWait, but in the code provided, the array a is an ArrayList of Long. \n\nThe prefix array pre is of size n+1, with pre[0] =0, pre[1] = a.get(0), etc. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, looking at the note's third example: \n\nSuppose the third example's input is such that when x=3 and y=3, the first three elements sum to 6. \n\nThen the first three elements must be 2, 2, 2? Or 1,2,3. \n\nWait, if the first three elements are 3,2,1, then their sum is 6. \n\nSo the items must be sorted in descending order as [3,2,1, ...]. \n\nThen for x=3 and y=3, the answer is 6. \n\nSo the code would work. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is to read x and y, compute pre[x] - pre[x - y], and append to the answer. \n\nSo the code inside the while loop is: \n\nString[] parts = br.readLine().split(\" \"); \n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]); \n\nint y = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); \n\nlong res = pre[x] - pre[x - y]; \n\nans.append(res + \"\\n\"); \n\nWait, but in the code provided, the variables are declared as: \n\nint i; \n\nBut inside the loop, we can use variables x and y. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the missing code is exactly that. \n\nTherefore, the code to fill in the TODO is: \n\nString[] parts = br.readLine().split(\" \"); \n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]); \n\nint y = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); \n\nlong res = pre[x] - pre[x - y]; \n\nans.append(res + \"\\n\"); \n\nWait, but the problem says to output each answer on a new line. \n\nYes, so the code appends a newline each time. \n\nSo that's the code to be filled in. \n\nNow, checking for possible errors. \n\nWait, the code uses an ArrayList a, which is sorted in reverse order (descending). \n\nThe prefix array pre is built correctly. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is as above. \n\nNow, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code, as plain text, not in code blocks. \n\nSo the code to be written inside the while loop is: \n\nString[] parts = br.readLine().split(\" \"); \n\nint x = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]); \n\nint y = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]); \n\nlong res = pre[x] - pre[x - y]; \n\nans.append(res + \"\\n\"); \n\nWait, but in the code provided, the variables are declared inside the loop? \n\nWait, the code's variables: \n\nThe code has: \n\nwhile(q-->0){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nInside that loop, the variables x and y must be declared. \n\nSo the code must read the line, split into parts, parse x and y, compute the result, and append to the ans. \n\nSo the code inside the loop is as above. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is exactly those four lines. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the answer is those four lines. \n\nWait, but the code may have to read the line via br.readLine(). \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nString[] parts = br.readLine().split(\" \");\nint x = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);\nint y = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);\nlong res = pre[x] - pre[x - y];\nans.append(res + \"\\n\");"
