Megan moves to (7,3), then to (1,3). Stanley also goes to (1,3), uses the portal to (7,3), then proceeds. Megan then goes to (1,5). The steps are:\n\nMegan's steps: from (n,1) (assuming n=7, m=5?), moving to (7,3) (distance 2), then to (1,3) (distance 6). Total Megan's steps: 8? But the note says Megan's part is 2+6? Then Stanley's part is 2 (to reach (1,3)), then 1 (teleport to 7,3), then 2 (to 7,5), and Megan's final step 2 to 1,5? Wait not sure, but the total is 15.

Maybe the minimal total is (n + m -1) + (n + m -1) - 2*(something). Alternatively, perhaps the minimal total is 2*(n + m - 2) - (some overlap). Wait, for the 2x2 case, 2*(2+2-2) =4, so it matches. The sample case n=7, m=5: 2*(7+5-2) = 22. But the sample's answer is 15 which is less than 22. So that approach is wrong. Ah, so when they can use portals to reduce the distance, the total can be less than 2*(n+m -2). So the sample's answer is 15, which is 22-7=15. So there must be a way to save 7 steps.

Then Megan's path is direct to her destination. The portals include (n,1). Stanley can teleport from his starting point (1,1) to (n,1) (cost 1), then proceed to (n,m). The distance from (n,1) to (n,m) is (m-1). Total for Stanley: 1 + (m-1) = m.\n\nMegan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). Her path length is (n-1) + (m-1). So total is m + (n + m - 2) = n + 2m-2. Compare to the original 2*(n+m-2) = 2n+2m-4. For example, in the sample n=7, m=5: \n\nOriginal sum is 2*(7+5-2) =2*10=20. With this approach it would be 7 + 2*5 -2 = 7+10-2=15. Which matches the sample's answer of 15. Oh! So this must be the case. Ah! So this suggests that the minimal total is (n + 2*m -2) when m >= ... wait let me see. Wait in this scenario, Stanley's path is 1 (teleport to n,1) plus (m-1) steps to (n, m), so total m steps. Megan's path is (n-1) + (m-1), which is (n + m -2) steps. Total sum is m + (n + m-2) = n + 2m - 2. In the sample case, n=7, m=5 gives 7+10-2=15, which matches. So that's promising. What about other cases?\n\nTake the 2x2 case. Then the formula would be n + 2m -2 = 2+4-2=4. Which matches the earlier calculation. Another case: 1x2 grid. n=1, m=2. Formula gives 1 + 2*2 -2 = 1+4-2=3. But earlier thought the minimal was 2. Wait conflict here. Wait, let me re-calculate that case. Case n=1, m=2. Stanley starts at (1,1), needs to go to (1,2). Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, the lower left is (1,1)) and needs to go to (1,2). Wait Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,2). So her path length is 1 step. Stanley can go directly to (1,2), which is 1 step. Total 2. But according to the formula n +2m-2 =1+4-2=3. Which is higher. So discrepancy here. Hmm, so the formula might not be universal. Wait, maybe in the case when n=1, the formula isn't applicable? Wait in the scenario above, when Megan goes directly to (1,2), then the portals are along her path: (1,1) and (1,2). So Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) for cost 1, so his total is 1, and Megan's is 1. So total 2. But according to the previous approach where Stanley teleports to Megan's starting point?\n\nWait in this case, Megan's starting point is (1,1). So Stanley could teleport there but that's where he is already. So he can teleport to any other portal, like (1,2).",

Alternatively, if n=1 and m=2, then the formula's alternative would be if Megan chooses to go to some other point. But in that case, the minimal is indeed 2. So perhaps the formula needs to be the minimum between (n + 2*m -2), (m + 2*n -2), and the original 2*(n+m-2)), whichever is smaller. Wait let's see for the sample case n=7, m=5: \n\nThe formula n +2m-2 gives 7 +10-2=15, which is the correct answer. Another case: n=2, m=2. The formula gives 2+4-2=4, which matches.\n\nn=1, m=2: 1+4-2=3, but the actual is 2. So the formula gives higher than the actual possible. So there's a problem.",

Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (4,1) (cost 1) then move right 1 step to (4,2). So total steps 2. Total sum 4+2=6 \u2192 correct. Thus, the minimal is indeed the minimum between (n + 2m -2) and (m + 2n-2). So the code needs to compute this minimum. But wait, what about when n=1 and m=1?

Ah, so there's a special case when n=1 and m=1. The problem says that Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to reach (n,m)=(1,1), so no steps required. Megan also starts at (n,1)= (1,1), needs to reach (1,m)= (1,1). So total is 0. So the code must handle this case. Another case when either n or m is 1:\n\nFor example, n=1, m=3.

So when Megan moves to (1,2), then (1,3), so those have portals. Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) (cost 1), then teleport again to (1,3) (cost 1). But that would be better?

So the portals are at all those cells. So Stanley can teleport directly from (1,1) to (1,3) for 1 unit. Thus, his total is 1. Megan's steps are 2 steps (right twice). Total is 3, which matches the formula's minimum (3). Yes, so that works. Thus, the formula holds except when n=1 and m=1, which we have to handle. So the code should compute the minimum between (n+2*m-2) and (m+2*n-2), but set to 0 if n==1 and m==1. Alternatively, when n=1 and m=1, the minimum would be between (1+2*1-2)=1 and (1+2*1-2)=1, so the minimum is 1, but the correct answer is 0. Thus, we need to handle that case separately. Thus, the code will first check if n==1 and m==1, then output 0. Else compute the minimum between the two terms. Wait what about when n=1 and m=2? The formula gives min(1+4-2=3, 2+ 2-2=2 \u2192 2), which is correct. Thus, the code should be:\n\nif (n == 1 && m ==1) output 0.\n\nelse, the minimum between (n + 2*m -2) and (m + 2*n -2).

Thus, the code should indeed compute the minimum between (n + 2*m -2) and (m + 2*n -2), except when n ==1 and m ==1, output 0. Thus the code for the solve function would read n and m, then compute the min between the two values, and output 0 if n and m are both 1. Now, given that n and m can be up to 1e5, but the code is straightforward. Now, looking at the code skeleton provided, we need to fill in the solve function. Thus, the code would be:\n\nvoid solve() {\n    long long n, m;\n    cin >> n >> m;\n    if (n == 1 && m ==1) {\n        cout << 0 << endl;\n        return;\n    }\n    long long a = n + 2*m - 2;\n    long long b = m + 2*n - 2;\n    cout << min(a,b) << endl;\n} Wait, but let me see: Wait, in the sample case where n=7, m=5. a =7 + 2*5-2 =7+10-2=15.\n\nb=5 + 14-2=17. So min is 15. Correct. Another case n=3, m=1:\n\na =3 +2*1-2=3, b =1+6-2=5. So min is 3.\n\nWhich is correct. Thus the code is correct. Now, check the case when n=1, m=2:\n\na=1 +4-2=3, b=2 +2 -2=2 \u2192 min is 2. Correct. Thus the code is correct. Thus, the missing code is the solve function as above.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, so I need to find the minimum total energy required for Stanley and Megan to reach their destinations. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem says that the store is an n x m grid. Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (n,m). Megan starts at (n,1) and goes to (1,m). They can move to adjacent cells with 1 unit of power each. Also, Megan leaves a portal in every cell she visits. So whenever either of them is in a cell with a portal, they can teleport to any other portal cell using 1 unit of power. The goal is to find the minimal total energy for both.\n\nHmm, the key here is to figure out the optimal path where they can use portals to minimize the total energy. Since portals are left in every cell Megan visits, the portals are along her path. So the strategy probably involves choosing paths for both such that they can use portals to cut down on movement.\n\nLet me think about the minimal possible. Since teleporting uses 1 unit, it's better to teleport whenever possible. So maybe their paths should cross via a common portal point so that they can teleport there and save steps.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimal steps without any portals. For Stanley, the Manhattan distance from (1,1) to (n,m) is (n-1)+(m-1) = n+m-2. Similarly for Megan, from (n,1) to (1,m), same distance. So total would be 2*(n+m-2). But with portals, maybe we can do better.\n\nThe portals are placed wherever Megan goes. So Megan's path determines the portal locations. So to minimize the total, we need to choose Megan's path such that both can use portals effectively.\n\nWait, but Megan can choose her path, right? Because the problem says they can choose when to move. So Megan can choose any path to reach her destination, leaving portals along the way. The optimal path would be the one that allows both Stanley and Megan to minimize their total steps plus the teleport steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is achieved when they cross each other's path at some point, so that they can teleport across. Let me think of some examples.\n\nTake the sample input mentioned in the note. Let me see what's going on there. The first test case's answer is 15. Let me parse the note's explanation. Megan moves to (7,3), then to (1,3). Stanley also goes to (1,3), uses the portal to (7,3), then proceeds. Megan then goes to (1,5). The steps are:\n\nMegan's steps: from (n,1) (assuming n=7, m=5?), moving to (7,3) (distance 2), then to (1,3) (distance 6). Total Megan's steps: 8? But the note says Megan's part is 2+6? Then Stanley's part is 2 (to reach (1,3)), then 1 (teleport to 7,3), then 2 (to 7,5), and Megan's final step 2 to 1,5? Wait not sure, but the total is 15. \n\nHmm, perhaps the key is to find the optimal point where they can teleport. Let me think of the minimal total steps.\n\nSuppose they meet at some cell (i,j) which has a portal. Let's see:\n\nStanley needs to go from (1,1) to (i,j), then teleport to another portal (maybe Megan's starting? No, Megan's starting is (n,1)), or maybe another point. Wait, the portals are placed along Megan's path. So Megan's path must include that cell (i,j) for there to be a portal there.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal point is where the sum of their paths plus teleport steps is minimized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is the Manhattan distance of Stanley plus Megan's distance, minus some overlapping steps saved by teleportation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total is (Stanley's path + Megan's path) - 2 * the minimal distance saved via a portal.\n\nHmm, perhaps the best is to find a point where both can reach via their paths, then teleport, thereby saving steps.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is (n + m - 2) * 2 minus some value based on the best possible portal point.\n\nSuppose both can teleport through a common portal. Let's think of choosing a point (x,y) where Megan's path includes it. Then:\n\nStanley's path would be:\n\ndistance from (1,1) to (x,y), then teleport (1) to Megan's path's other point, but then maybe to destination? Or perhaps to the destination via the portal?\n\nWait, perhaps the best scenario is that both can reach a common portal point and then teleport to their destinations.\n\nWait, the destination for Stanley is (n,m). For Megan, it's (1,m). So maybe if they can meet at a certain point, then use the portals to get to their destinations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total energy is ( (distance from Stanley to Megan's portal point) + 1 (teleport) + distance from portal to his destination ) + similarly for Megan, plus Megan's path to set up the portals.\n\nWait, but Megan's path is part of the problem. So Megan must choose a path that allows the best possible savings for both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal total energy can be determined by considering the minimal path where they can share a common portal.\n\nLet me think of the minimal possible total energy.\n\nSuppose they choose to have a common portal point (i,j). The portals along Megan's path would include (i,j), so Megan must have visited it. Let's suppose Megan takes a path that goes through (i,j), so that the portal is there.\n\nStanley can go to (i,j), then teleport (cost 1) to another portal, which could be Megan's starting point (n,1) or another point along her path. Wait, but Megan's path can include (i,j). So perhaps the best is for them to meet at a point that is on both their paths, so they can teleport there or from there.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the best possible scenario. The minimal total energy would be when they can use portals to minimize their travel. Let me think of the minimal possible:\n\nThe minimal possible total energy would be the sum of the minimal steps each can take using the portals optimally.\n\nSuppose Megan's path is such that she goes directly to the point where they can teleport. Let's think of the optimal scenario where they meet at a point that is halfway.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy might be ( (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) ) minus some overlapping saved steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( (n + m - 2) + (n + m - 2) - (something)). Hmm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( (distance of Stanley to some point) +1 (teleport) + distance from that point to destination ) plus Megan's path steps plus her teleport steps, but this may be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is ( (S's distance) + (M's distance) - 2*(distance saved by using a portal) )\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the minimal possible total energy.\n\nSuppose Megan takes the shortest path possible, which is moving up to (1,1), then right? No, Megan's start is (n,1), so her shortest path is to move up to (1,1), then right to (1,m). Wait that's distance (n-1) + (m-1). But that would set up portals along that path.\n\nIn that case, Stanley can go to (1,1) via his own path (but he starts there). Then he can teleport to any portal. For example, Megan's path includes (1,1) and (1,m). Wait, Megan's path would have (n,1) -> ... -> (1,1) then -> (1,m). So the portals are along that path. Then, Stanley can go from (1,1) to (1,m), then down to (n,m). Wait but Megan's path may not include (1,m) until later. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal total is (n + m - 1). Wait that's the Manhattan distance for one path, but both together would be twice that minus some.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula here. Let me think of small cases.\n\nTest case 1: let's see the sample. The note says that the first test case's answer is 15. Let me see what n and m are. The note mentions Megan moving to (7,3). So n is 7, m is 5?\n\nThen the input would be n=7, m=5. Let me compute the formula.\n\nThe sample answer is 15. Let me see:\n\nThe minimal total energy.\n\nAnother approach: Let's compute the minimal possible for any n and m.\n\nSuppose we have to choose the path such that the sum of their steps plus the teleport uses is minimized.\n\nThe key idea is that once Megan has placed portals along her path, Stanley can use those portals to teleport, saving steps.\n\nThe best scenario is when both can reach a common portal point quickly, then teleport to their destinations.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is ( (Manhattan distance for Stanley) + (Manhattan for Megan) ) minus 2*(some overlap) plus the 1 for teleport, but perhaps this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is (n + m - 1). Wait no, for the sample where n=7 and m=5, that would be 7+5-1=11, which is less than 15, so that can't be.\n\nHmm. Let me think differently. Let me consider some small examples.\n\nCase 1: n=1, m=1. Then both start and end at the same cell. The total is 0. But according to the problem, their start and destination would be same. So answer 0.\n\nCase 2: n=1, m=2. Stanley starts at (1,1) needs to go to (1,2). Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, so n,1 is (1,1)), but her destination is (1,2). Wait Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,2). So Megan's path is just moving right. She leaves a portal at (1,2) when she reaches there. \n\nStanley can just move right, which is 1 step. Megan also moves 1 step. Total 2. But wait, Megan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). Wait when n=1 and m=2, Megan's start is (1,1) and destination is (1,2). So she can just move to (1,2) directly, using 1 step. Stanley also can move directly, so total 1 + 1 = 2. But using portals?\n\nWait Megan leaves portals along her path. She starts at (1,1), which has a portal (since she placed it there?), because Megan leaves a portal in each cell she visits. Wait, when Megan starts, the starting cell has a portal. So Megan's initial cell has a portal. So, Stanley can use that portal.\n\nWait, Megan's starting cell (1,1) has a portal since she is there initially. So perhaps Megan's path is just moving directly to (1,2). So the portals are in (1,1) and (1,2). \n\nThen, Stanley can start at (1,1), and teleport to (1,2) using 1 unit. So his total is 1 (teleport). Megan's steps: 1 (to move to (1,2)). So total is 1 +1 = 2. Which is better than moving normally (1 +1 = same). So the total is same. Hmm so maybe the answer would be 2. But using portals here didn't save anything.\n\nWait, maybe the problem counts Megan's path steps as the steps she takes, which includes the starting cell. Since she leaves a portal in each cell she visits. So Megan's starting cell is part of her path, so the portal is there.\n\nHmm, perhaps for this case, the minimal is indeed 2.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2.\n\nStanley starts (1,1) to (2,2). Megan starts (2,1) to (1,2).\n\nWhat's the minimal total?\n\nOption 1: Both go directly:\n\nStanley's path: right then down: 2 steps. Megan's path: up then right: 2 steps. Total 4.\n\nAlternatively, Megan can take a path that allows teleports.\n\nSuppose Megan goes to (1,1) first, then to (1,2).\n\nHer path is (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). That requires 1 step up, then 1 step right (total 2 steps). So the portals are at those cells.\n\nThen Stanley can go to (1,1) via moving up (from (1,1), he is there already) then teleport to (1,2) with 1, so total steps 1 (teleport). Then he needs to get to (2,2). From (1,2), he can move down 1 step (cost 1). So total for Stanley: 1 + 1 = 2. Megan's steps are 2. Total 4 again.\n\nAlternatively, another path for Megan: go to (2,2), then to (1,2). But Megan's destination is (1,2). So she can take the path (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) (right), then up. But then portals at (2,1), (2,2), (1,2).\n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (2,2), then go down? Wait no, (2,2) is his destination. So Stanley can go to (1,1), teleport to (2,2) (cost 1) and done. So Stanley's steps: 1 (teleport). Megan's steps: 1 (right) +1 (up) = 2. So total 3? Wait that's better than 4. Wait why?\n\nWait Megan has to reach (1,2). Her path via (2,2) is possible. So Megan's path steps are moving right (from (2,1) to (2,2)), then up to (1,2). So total steps is 2. \n\nStanley's path: he starts at (1,1). He can go to (1,1) which has a portal (since Megan starts there?), wait Megan's starting cell is (2,1). Wait Megan's starting cell is (n,1) = (2,1). So the initial portal is at (2,1). So Megan's path includes (2,1), (2,2), (1,2). \n\nSo the portals are in (2,1), (2,2), (1,2). \n\nStanley is at (1,1). He can move to (2,1) (adjacent?), but (1,1) and (2,1) are adjacent vertically, so moving down requires 1 step. Then, since (2,1) has a portal, he can teleport to (2,2) (cost 1). Then from (2,2), which is his destination, he can stop. So Stanley's path would be:\n\nMove down to (2,1): 1 step, then teleport to (2,2): 1. total 2 steps. \n\nWait that's better than teleporting directly from (1,1) to (2,2). Because (1,1) doesn't have a portal unless Megan visited it. Wait Megan's path in this scenario is (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (1,2). So Megan didn't go to (1,1), so that cell has no portal. So (1,1) doesn't have a portal. Therefore, Stanley can't teleport from (1,1) to anywhere.\n\nAh, right. So the portals are only in the cells Megan has visited. So in this case, the (1,1) cell does not have a portal. \n\nSo in the scenario where Megan goes to (2,2), then (1,2), then Stanley can go as follows:\n\nHe starts at (1,1). To reach a portal, he has to move down to (2,1) (cost 1) which has a portal. Then he can teleport to (2,2) (cost 1). Then he is at (2,2), so total is 2 steps.\n\nMegan's steps: 2 steps. Total is 2 + 2 =4? Wait no, 2 (Stanley's) plus 2 (Megan's) equals 4. Same as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, what's the minimal here?\n\nWait another path for Megan: She goes from (2,1) to (1,1), then to (1,2). So her path includes (2,1) \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 (1,2). So that's two steps. \n\nThen, the portals are (2,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nStanley starts at (1,1), which now has a portal. So he can teleport directly to any portal. His destination is (2,2). But the portals are at (2,1), (1,1), (1,2). So he can teleport from (1,1) to (2,1) (cost 1), then go down to (2,2) (cost 1). Total 2 steps. \n\nAlternatively, he can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) (cost 1), then move right to (2,2) (wait no, (1,2) to (2,2) is down, so cost 1. So total steps: 1 +1 = 2.\n\nMegan's steps are 2. Total is 4 again. \n\nHmm, so maybe for 2x2, the minimal total is 4? Or can it be done better?\n\nAlternatively, can Megan choose a path that allows both to use a portal?\n\nWait, Megan could also go to (1,2) directly from (2,1), moving up then right. Wait (2,1) to (1,1) is up, then (1,1) to (1,2) is right. That's two steps. \n\nThen, the portals are present in (2,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (2,1) (cost 1), then move down to (2,2)? Wait no, (2,1) is his current position, so moving to (2,2) is right, cost 1. So total 2 steps. Megan's steps 2, total 4.\n\nAlternatively, Megan's path could be (2,1) \u2192 (1,2) directly? Wait that would require moving left? No, (2,1) can't go to (1,2) in one step. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm, so it seems that for 2x2, the minimal is 4. \n\nBut let's see if there is a better way. Let's think of using a portal that allows savings.\n\nWait, if Megan takes a path that includes a cell that is on both their paths.\n\nSuppose Megan goes to (1,1), then to (1,2). So her path is 2 steps. \n\nThen, Stanley can stay at (1,1) (since he starts there), and teleport to (2,1) (portal there), then move to (2,2). \n\nStanley's path: teleport to (2,1) (cost 1), then move right (1 step). Total 2 steps. \n\nMegan's steps: 2. So total 4 again.\n\nHmm. Maybe there isn't a better way for 2x2.\n\nSo the minimal total is 4.\n\nWait but what if Megan goes to (2,2) first. Then her path is:\n\nShe moves right to (2,2) (cost 1), then up to (1,2) (cost 1). So 2 steps.\n\nThen Stanley can go: from (1,1) to (2,1) (cost 1), then teleport to (2,2) (cost 1). So total 2 steps. Megan's steps 2, total 4 again.\n\nSo for 2x2, the minimal is 4.\n\nHmm, so how to model this?\n\nMaybe the minimal total is (n + m -1) + (n + m -1) - 2*(something). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is 2*(n + m - 2) - (some overlap). \n\nWait, for the 2x2 case, 2*(2+2-2) =4, so it matches.\n\nThe sample case n=7, m=5: 2*(7+5-2) = 22. But the sample's answer is 15 which is less than 22. So that approach is wrong.\n\nAh, so when they can use portals to reduce the distance, the total can be less than 2*(n+m -2). So the sample's answer is 15, which is 22-7=15. So there must be a way to save 7 steps.\n\nHmm, so the portals allow them to save steps. The question is how much can they save.\n\nLet me think of the general case.\n\nThe minimal total energy would be the sum of their minimal paths without considering the portals, minus the savings from using portals.\n\nThe key is to find the best possible point where both can teleport.\n\nSuppose they choose a point (x,y) where Megan visits it. Then, the savings for Stanley would be the minimal between (distance from Stanley to (x,y) plus 1 plus distance from (x,y) to his destination) versus the original path.\n\nSimilarly for Megan. The optimal point (x,y) should minimize the sum of their paths with the teleport.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal total energy is the minimal over all possible x and y of ( (S's distance to (x,y) + 1 + S's destination from (x,y)) ) + ( M's path length to (x,y) plus ... )? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total can be found by considering the best point where they can meet, and the total energy is the sum of their steps to that point plus 1 (teleport) plus steps from that point to their destinations. But Megan's path must include that point.\n\nAlternatively, since Megan can choose her path, perhaps the optimal point is where the sum of the steps saved for both is maximized.\n\nLet me think of the optimal scenario where both can teleport once to minimize their total steps.\n\nSuppose Megan chooses to go directly to (1,m), which is her destination. But then, the only portal there would be along her path. Let's see:\n\nIf Megan takes the path from (n,1) to (1,1) then to (1,m). \n\nHer path length is (n-1) + (m-1) steps.\n\nThen, the portals are along that path.\n\nStanley can go from (1,1) to (1,m) via portal.\n\nWait Stanley's destination is (n,m). So if he can teleport to (1,m), then he can move down from there.\n\nWait let's think:\n\nStanley's path would be:\n\nFrom (1,1) to (1,m) via moving right, which takes (m-1) steps. But then he can teleport to (n,1) (the portal there?), then move right? No. Hmm, perhaps better to teleport through a different portal.\n\nAlternatively, Stanley can go to (1,1), then teleport to (n,1) (Megan's starting point, which has a portal). Then he moves down to (n,m). \n\nThe distance from (n,1) to (n,m) is (m-1). \n\nSo Stanley's path would be:\n\nMove from (1,1) to (n,1) (distance n-1 steps), then teleport (cost 1), then move right (m-1 steps). Total steps: (n-1) + 1 + (m-1) = n + m -1. \n\nMegan's path is (n,1) to (1,1) (n-1 steps), then to (1,m) (m-1 steps). So total steps are (n-1)+(m-1) = n+m-2.\n\nTotal energy: Stanley's (n+m-1) + Megan's (n+m-2) = 2n+2m-3.\n\nCompare with the original sum 2*(n+m-2) = 2n+2m-4. Wait, this is worse by 1. So that's not better.\n\nHmm. So maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal path is when they meet at some point along the way, such that the time saved is maximized.\n\nSuppose the best point is (n,1) (Megan's starting point). Then Megan's path is direct to her destination. The portals include (n,1). \n\nStanley can teleport from his starting point (1,1) to (n,1) (cost 1), then proceed to (n,m). The distance from (n,1) to (n,m) is (m-1). Total for Stanley: 1 + (m-1) = m.\n\nMegan's path is from (n,1) to (1,m). Her path length is (n-1) + (m-1). So total is m + (n + m - 2) = n + 2m-2. \n\nCompare to the original 2*(n+m-2) = 2n+2m-4. \n\nFor example, in the sample n=7, m=5: \n\nOriginal sum is 2*(7+5-2) =2*10=20. \n\nWith this approach it would be 7 + 2*5 -2 = 7+10-2=15. Which matches the sample's answer of 15. Oh! So this must be the case.\n\nAh! So this suggests that the minimal total is (n + 2*m -2) when m >= ... wait let me see.\n\nWait in this scenario, Stanley's path is 1 (teleport to n,1) plus (m-1) steps to (n, m), so total m steps. Megan's path is (n-1) + (m-1), which is (n + m -2) steps. Total sum is m + (n + m-2) = n + 2m - 2. \n\nIn the sample case, n=7, m=5 gives 7+10-2=15, which matches. So that's promising.\n\nWhat about other cases?\n\nTake the 2x2 case. Then the formula would be n + 2m -2 = 2+4-2=4. Which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nAnother case: 1x2 grid. n=1, m=2. \n\nFormula gives 1 + 2*2 -2 = 1+4-2=3. But earlier thought the minimal was 2. Wait conflict here.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate that case.\n\nCase n=1, m=2.\n\nStanley starts at (1,1), needs to go to (1,2). Megan starts at (1,1) (since n=1, the lower left is (1,1)) and needs to go to (1,2). \n\nWait Megan's path is from (1,1) to (1,2). So her path length is 1 step. \n\nStanley can go directly to (1,2), which is 1 step. Total 2. \n\nBut according to the formula n +2m-2 =1+4-2=3. Which is higher. So discrepancy here.\n\nHmm, so the formula might not be universal. \n\nWait, maybe in the case when n=1, the formula isn't applicable?\n\nWait in the scenario above, when Megan goes directly to (1,2), then the portals are along her path: (1,1) and (1,2). \n\nSo Stanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) for cost 1, so his total is 1, and Megan's is 1. So total 2. \n\nBut according to the previous approach where Stanley teleports to Megan's starting point?\n\nWait in this case, Megan's starting point is (1,1). So Stanley could teleport there but that's where he is already. So he can teleport to any other portal, like (1,2). \n\nAh, so the previous approach is still valid but in this case, Megan's path is just to go to (1,2). \n\nSo the formula must be adjusted. \n\nWait what's the formula here? The formula I thought before was the case where Megan chooses to go to (1,m), but in this case, that's exactly what she does. So the total was 1 (Megan's steps) + 1 (Stanley's steps) = 2, but the formula gave 3. \n\nHmm so there must be another scenario when the formula is different. \n\nWait maybe the formula is min between different options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal total is the minimum between (n+2*m-2), (m + 2*n-2), and other terms? Let me think.\n\nWait another scenario for the 1x2 grid: Megan takes a different path. Suppose she goes to (1,2) directly, which is minimal. So the total is 2. \n\nAlternatively, if n=1 and m=2, then the formula's alternative would be if Megan chooses to go to some other point. \n\nBut in that case, the minimal is indeed 2. So perhaps the formula needs to be the minimum between (n + 2*m -2), (m + 2*n -2), and the original 2*(n+m-2)), whichever is smaller. \n\nWait let's see for the sample case n=7, m=5: \n\nThe formula n +2m-2 gives 7 +10-2=15, which is the correct answer. \n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. The formula gives 2+4-2=4, which matches.\n\nn=1, m=2: 1+4-2=3, but the actual is 2. So the formula gives higher than the actual possible. So there's a problem.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the formula is not correct for all cases, but perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait in the 1x2 case, the minimal is 2. \n\nThe formula I thought before was n + m -2 (the Manhattan distance) for each. So their total is 1+1 =2, which is exactly that. \n\nWait in that case, using the portals didn't help. So the minimal is the same as their direct paths. \n\nAh, so perhaps the general formula is the minimum between the direct path sum and the possible better paths using portals. \n\nHmm, so maybe the minimal total is the minimum of:\n\nOption 1: (n + m -2) *2 (direct paths without using portals).\n\nOption 2: (m + (n-1 + (m-1))) ) = n + 2m -2 (the previous approach).\n\nOption 3: (n + 2m-2) versus (m + 2n-2), whichever is smaller.\n\nWait alternatively, the minimal between the two options where either Stanley or Megan takes an optimal path.\n\nWait, the minimal between (n + 2m -2) and (m + 2n-2).\n\nIn the 1x2 case:\n\n min(1 +4-2=3, 2+2-2=2) \u2192 2. Which matches.\n\nSample case: 7+10-2=15 vs 5 + 12-2 = 15 \u2192 same.\n\nFor 2x2 case: min(2+4-2=4, 2 + 2*2-2 = 2+2=4 \u2192 4. \n\nAnother example: n=3, m=4. \n\nOption2: 3+8-2=9, option3: 4 +6-2=8 \u2192 the minimal would be 8?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nSuppose Megan's path is to go to (1,4) first. \n\nHer path would be from (3,1) up to (1,1), then right to (1,4). \n\nHer path length is (3-1) steps up, then (4-1) right \u2192 2+3=5.\n\nStanley can go to (1,1) (starting there), teleport to (3,1) (cost1), then go down to (3,4). \n\nWait, (3,1) is Megan's start, which has a portal. \n\nSo Stanley's path: from (1,1) to (3,1) via teleport (cost 1). Then moving right 3 steps (to 3,4). Total 1+3=4. \n\nTotal sum: 5 (Megan) +4 (Stanley) =9. \n\nAlternatively, if Megan chooses to go to (3,4) first?\n\nMegan's path: from (3,1) right to (3,4), then up to (1,4). \n\nHer path length is 3 (steps to the right) +2 (up) \u21925 steps.\n\nStanley can go to (3,1) via moving down (cost 2 steps from (1,1)), then teleport to (3,4) (cost1). Then done. \n\nStanley's steps:2+1=3. Total 5+3=8. Which is better.\n\nAh! So in this case, the minimal would be 8 (m + 2n-2 =4 + (2*3-2)= 4+4=8). So the minimal is the minimum between (n+2m-2) and (m +2n-2).\n\nSo the correct formula is the minimum between (n + 2m -2) and (m + 2n -2).\n\nSo the minimal total is the minimum between those two.\n\nLet's check the previous cases:\n\nn=1, m=2:\n\nmin(1+4-2=3, 2+2-2=2 \u2192 min is 2).\n\nSample case n=7, m=5: 7+10-2=15 and 5+12-2=15, so same.\n\n2x2 case: min(2+4-2=4, 2+2*2-2 \u21922+2=4 \u2192 min 4.\n\nFor n=3, m=4, the minimal is 8 (the second option).\n\nThus, the formula is min(n + 2*m -2, m + 2*n -2).\n\nThus, the answer should be the minimum of (n + 2*m -2) and (m + 2*n -2).\n\nWait let me check another case. For n=3, m=3.\n\nThe formula gives min(3+6-2=7, 3+6-2=7 \u2192 7.\n\nAnother approach:\n\nIf Megan goes to (3,3) first, then:\n\nMegan's path would be (3,1) \u2192 (3,3) (steps right 2), then up to (1,3) (steps up 2). Total steps 4. \n\nStanley can go to 3,1 (cost 2 steps down), teleport to 3,3 (cost 1). So he is at destination? No, his destination is (3,3)? \n\nWait n=3, m=3. Stanley needs to go to (3,3). So yes. So his path is 2+1=3. Total 4+3=7.\n\nWhich matches the formula.\n\nAnother case: n=4, m=2.\n\nFormula's options:4 +4-2=6 vs 2 + 8-2=8 \u2192 min is 6.\n\nMegan's path: to (1,2). \n\nHer path is from (4,1) up to (1,1), then right to (1,2). Steps: 3 +1=4.\n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (4,1) (cost 1) then move right 1 step to (4,2). So total steps 2. \n\nTotal sum 4+2=6 \u2192 correct.\n\nThus, the minimal is indeed the minimum between (n + 2m -2) and (m + 2n-2).\n\nSo the code needs to compute this minimum.\n\nBut wait, what about when n=1 and m=1? The case where both start at the same cell and need to go to the same cell. The formula would give min(1+2*1-2=1, 1+2*1-2=1 \u21921. But the correct answer should be 0, since they don't need to move.\n\nAh, so there's a special case when n=1 and m=1. \n\nThe problem says that Stanley starts at (1,1) and needs to reach (n,m)=(1,1), so no steps required. Megan also starts at (n,1)= (1,1), needs to reach (1,m)= (1,1). So total is 0.\n\nSo the code must handle this case.\n\nAnother case when either n or m is 1:\n\nFor example, n=1, m=3.\n\nThen the formula gives min(1 +6-2=5, 3 + 2*1-2=3 \u21923). \n\nLet's see:\n\nStanley's path: needs to go from (1,1) to (1,3). \n\nMegan's path: from (1,1) to (1,3). \n\nIf Megan goes directly (right twice), her steps are 2. \n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,3), but how? Wait Megan's path includes those cells. So when Megan moves to (1,2), then (1,3), so those have portals. \n\nStanley can teleport from (1,1) to (1,2) (cost 1), then teleport again to (1,3) (cost 1). But that would be better?\n\nWait, he can go directly: from (1,1), teleport to (1,3) (cost 1). Because once Megan reaches there, that's a portal. Wait, but Megan's path must include those cells. \n\nWait, Megan's path is (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). \n\nSo the portals are at all those cells. \n\nSo Stanley can teleport directly from (1,1) to (1,3) for 1 unit. \n\nThus, his total is 1. \n\nMegan's steps are 2 steps (right twice). Total is 3, which matches the formula's minimum (3). \n\nYes, so that works. \n\nThus, the formula holds except when n=1 and m=1, which we have to handle.\n\nSo the code should compute the minimum between (n+2*m-2) and (m+2*n-2), but set to 0 if n==1 and m==1.\n\nAlternatively, when n=1 and m=1, the minimum would be between (1+2*1-2)=1 and (1+2*1-2)=1, so the minimum is 1, but the correct answer is 0. \n\nThus, we need to handle that case separately.\n\nThus, the code will first check if n==1 and m==1, then output 0.\n\nElse compute the minimum between the two terms.\n\nWait what about when n=1 and m=2?\n\nThe formula gives min(1+4-2=3, 2+ 2-2=2 \u2192 2), which is correct. \n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nif (n == 1 && m ==1) output 0.\n\nelse, the minimum between (n + 2*m -2) and (m + 2*n -2).\n\nWait let me see for n=1 and m=1:\n\nthe formula gives 1+2*1-2 =1, which would be wrong, so yes, must handle that.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1.\n\nThe formula computes min (2+ 2*1-2 =2, 1+2*2-2=3 \u2192 2. \n\nMegan's path: from (2,1) to (1,1) (since m=1, Megan's destination is (1,1). \n\nHer path is moving up 1 step. \n\nStanley is already at (1,1), so no movement needed. \n\nThus, total is 1 (Megan's step) + 0 (Stanley's steps) \u21921.\n\nWait but according to the formula, it gives 2. So discrepancy again.\n\nHmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nWait n=2, m=1:\n\nStanley starts at (1,1) and needs to go to (2,1). Megan starts at (2,1) and needs to go to (1,1).\n\nThe minimal total is:\n\nMegan can just move up to (1,1), which takes 1 step. Stanley can move down to (2,1), which takes 1 step. Total 2, which matches the formula's output of 2. \n\nWait the total is 1 (Megan) +1 (Stanley) = 2, so correct. \n\nAh, I made a mistake earlier. \n\nSo the formula holds here. \n\nAnother case: n=3, m=1:\n\nFormula computes min(3 + 2*1-2 =3+0=3 vs 1+6-2=5 \u21923.\n\nMegan's path from (3,1) to (1,1). Steps: 2. \n\nStanley has to go from (1,1) to (3,1), which is 2 steps down. \n\nTotal is 2 +2 =4. Which is more than 3. \n\nHmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait what's the formula's result. \n\nWait n=3, m=1. \n\nThe formula's first option: 3+2*1-2 = 3+0=3. \n\nSecond option: 1 + 2*3-2 \u2192 1+4=5 \u2192 min is 3.\n\nBut how can the total be 3?\n\nLet's think:\n\nMegan's path to (1,1) (her destination). So she goes up from (3,1) to (1,1) in 2 steps. \n\nMegan's path includes all cells she visited. So she leaves portals at (3,1), (2,1), (1,1).\n\nStanley is at (1,1). He needs to go to (3,1). \n\nHe can teleport from (1,1) to (3,1) (cost 1). So his steps are 1. \n\nTotal steps:\n\nMegan: 2 steps (path). \n\nStanley: 1 step (teleport). \n\nTotal 3. So that works. \n\nAh, yes. So that's correct. \n\nSo formula works here.\n\nThus, the code should indeed compute the minimum between (n + 2*m -2) and (m + 2*n -2), except when n ==1 and m ==1, output 0.\n\nThus the code for the solve function would read n and m, then compute the min between the two values, and output 0 if n and m are both 1.\n\nNow, given that n and m can be up to 1e5, but the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, looking at the code skeleton provided, we need to fill in the solve function.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nvoid solve() {\n    long long n, m;\n    cin >> n >> m;\n    if (n == 1 && m ==1) {\n        cout << 0 << endl;\n        return;\n    }\n    long long a = n + 2*m - 2;\n    long long b = m + 2*n - 2;\n    cout << min(a,b) << endl;\n}\n\nWait, but let me see:\n\nWait, in the sample case where n=7, m=5. \n\na =7 + 2*5-2 =7+10-2=15.\n\nb=5 + 14-2=17. So min is 15. Correct.\n\nAnother case n=3, m=1:\n\na =3 +2*1-2=3, b =1+6-2=5. So min is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus the code is correct.\n\nNow, check the case when n=1, m=2:\n\na=1 +4-2=3, b=2 +2 -2=2 \u2192 min is 2. Correct.\n\nThus the code is correct.\n\nThus, the missing code is the solve function as above."
