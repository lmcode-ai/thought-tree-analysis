So the cells differing in exactly one position are:\n\n         Either the first character is different and the second same \u2192 but that would require the first character to be different, but the second same. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\n         To have exactly one differing position between (i,j) and (x,y): Either:\n\n         (i != x and j == y) \u2192 first position differs, second same. OR\n\n         (i == x and j != y) \u2192 second position differs, first same. So the neighbors of (i,j) are all cells (x,y) where either x ! = i and y = j, or x = i and y != j. But also, x and y must be between 0 and 25 (since they are letters a-z). So for each (i,j), the neighbors are: For all possible x in 0..25 except i, with y = j \u2192 but that's all cells in the same column but different row. Plus all possible y in 0..25 except j, with x = i \u2192 all cells in the same row but different column. But this would include all cells differing in exactly one coordinate. However, this is a lot of cells. For each (i,j), there are (25 + 25) neighbors? Because for the first case (x != i, y = j), there are 25 possibilities (since x can be any except i). Similarly for the second case (y != j, x = i), 25 possibilities. So total 50 neighbors per cell. But this is manageable, since 26*26 cells, each with 50 neighbors \u2192 26*26*50 = 33,800 operations, which is acceptable. So for each cell (i,j), we need to iterate over all possible neighbors and sum their counts. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the sum more efficiently. Let me think of how to compute the sum for a cell (i,j): The sum is equal to:\n\n         (sum over all x ! = i of cnt[x][j]) + (sum over all y ! = j of cnt[i][y]) Because:\n\n         The first part is all cells in the same column (j) but different row (x != i) \u2192 differing in first character. The second part is all cells in the same row (i) but different column (y != j) \u2192 differing in second character. So the total sum for neighbors is (sum of column j excluding (i,j)) + (sum of row i excluding (i,j)). Wait, but the first term is sum over x of cnt[x][j] minus cnt[i][j], because x can be any except i. Wait, no:\n\n         The first term is sum_{x ! = i} cnt[x][j] \u2192 which is (sum_{x=0 to 25} cnt[x][j]) - cnt[i][j]. The second term is sum_{y ! = j} cnt[i][y] \u2192 (sum_{y=0 to 25} cnt[i][y]) - cnt[i][j]. So the total sum for neighbors is (col_sum[j] - cnt[i][j]) + (row_sum[i] - cnt[i][j]).",

Let's see:\n\n         Precompute two arrays:\n\n         row_sums[i] = sum_{j=0 to 25} cnt[i][j]\n\n         col_sums[j] = sum_{i=0 to 25} cnt[i][j]\n\n         Then, for cell (i,j):\n\n         sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - cnt[i][j]) + (row_sums[i] - cnt[i][j]) So this way, for each cell, the neighbor sum can be computed in O(1) time, after precomputing the row and column sums. That would be better, as it reduces the per-cell computation from O(50) to O(1). So the steps would be:\n\n         1. Precompute row_sums and col_sums. 2.

So putting this all together, the code after reading the strings would be:\n\n         // After reading all strings and filling cnt:\n\n         // compute row and column sums\n\n         int [] row_sums = new int[26];\n\n         int [] col_sums = new int[26];\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 row_sums[i] += cnt[i][j];\n\n                 col_sums[j] += cnt[i][j];\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         long total = 0;\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 int current = cnt[i][j];\n\n                 if (current == 0) continue;\n\n                 int sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - current) + (row_sums[i] - current);\n\n                 total += (long) current * sum_neighbors;\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         ans = total / 2; Then, System.out.println(ans);\n\n         So that's the code that needs to be filled in. Now, looking at the original code's structure:\n\n         The code inside the test case loop is:\n\n         while(t-->0) {\n\n             int n = sc.nextInt();\n\n             sc.nextLine();\n\n             int cnt[][] = new int[26][26];\n\n             long ans = 0;\n\n             for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) {\n\n                 String s = sc.nextLine();\n\n                 for(int j = 0 ; j < 26 ; j++){\n\n                     /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n                 }\n\n                 cnt[s.charAt(0)-'a'][s.charAt(1)-'a']++;\n\n             }\n\n             System.out.println(ans);\n\n         } So the code after the for loop (reading the strings) needs to compute the row and column sums, then compute the total and set ans. So the missing code is the part after the for loop over the strings, before the print statement. So the code to add is:\n\n         // compute row and column sums\n\n         int [] row_sums = new int[26];\n\n         int [] col_sums = new int[26];\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 row_sums[i] += cnt[i][j];\n\n                 col_sums[j] += cnt[i][j];\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         long total = 0;\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 int current = cnt[i][j];\n\n                 if (current == 0) continue;\n\n                 int sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - current) + (row_sums[i] - current);\n\n                 total += (long) current * sum_neighbors;\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         ans = total / 2; So that's the code to be inserted after the for loop over the strings and before the print statement. Also, the inner loop over j in the string reading loop (the for (int j=0; j<26; j++) loop) should be removed. But since the user's instruction says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to remove that loop is not part of the answer.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let's read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe task is to count the number of pairs of strings (i, j) where i < j, and the two strings differ in exactly one position. So each pair must have either the first character different and the second same, or the second different and the first same.\n\nHmm, the code provided has a 2D array cnt[26][26], which probably counts the occurrences of each possible string. Because each string is two lowercase letters, so each character can be from a to k (but the array is 26, so maybe up to 'z', but the input is limited to a-k). \n\nThe current code is looping through each string, and for each, it's incrementing cnt[firstChar - 'a'][secondChar - 'a'] by 1. So that's counting how many times each pair (like 'ab' would be (0,1), etc.) appears.\n\nThe problem is to find all pairs of these entries where their Hamming distance is exactly 1. So for each pair of entries (a,b) and (c,d), we need to check if either a != c and b == d, or a == c and b != d. Then, for each such pair of entries, the number of pairs between them is the product of their counts. But since we have to consider all ordered pairs where i < j, the total for each such pair of entries would be count1 * count2. But since each combination is considered once, we need to sum over all possible pairs of entries that are 1 apart, the product of their counts.\n\nWait, but how do we efficiently compute this without checking all possible pairs of entries, which could be O(26^4) which is manageable since 26^4 is 456,976, which is acceptable even for multiple test cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute for each cell (x,y) the number of cells that are 1 away from it, and then compute the sum accordingly. Let me think.\n\nThe approach could be:\n\n1. For each test case, first count all the occurrences in the cnt array.\n\n2. Then, for each cell (i,j) in the cnt array, look at all other cells (i', j') such that exactly one of i != i' or j != j' holds (i.e., they differ in exactly one coordinate). For each such pair, the contribution to the answer is cnt[i][j] * cnt[i'][j'].\n\nBut since each pair (A,B) where A comes before B is counted once, but when considering all ordered pairs, we have to avoid double-counting. Wait, actually, when considering all ordered pairs (i,j) and (k,l), if (i,j) and (k,l) are a pair differing in one position, then the total number of such pairs between their counts is cnt[i][j] * cnt[k][l]. But since the order here is i < j in the original list, but in the counts, the order between the two entries doesn't matter. So the total for two cells (a,b) and (c,d) that are 1 apart is cnt[a][b] * cnt[c][d], and we need to sum all such pairs where (a,b) and (c,d) are 1 apart. However, this counts each unordered pair twice (once as (a,b) and (c,d), once as (c,d) and (a,b)), except when they are the same cell (but same cell can't contribute since they need to differ in exactly one position). Wait, no, because if (a,b) and (c,d) are different cells that are 1 apart, then the product counts both (a,b) with (c,d) and (c,d) with (a,b). But since in the problem statement, the pairs (i,j) must have i < j, so each such pair of counts would contribute exactly cnt[a][b] * cnt[c][d], because all elements in the first cell paired with elements in the second cell would form i < j if the first is processed before the second? No, actually, the order in which the cells are considered doesn't matter. The total number of pairs between the two cells is exactly cnt[a][b] * cnt[c][d], but since each such pair (x in a,b and y in c,d) is counted once if x comes before y, and once if y comes before x. Wait, no. The total number of ordered pairs (x,y) where x is in the first cell and y in the second is cnt[a][b] * cnt[c][d], but the number of unordered pairs where i < j is exactly (cnt[a][b] * cnt[c][d]) if the two cells are different. Because for each element in the first cell and each in the second, exactly one of the two is in an earlier position (assuming all elements are considered in the list). Wait, actually, the problem counts all pairs (i,j) with i < j, so the total for two different cells is the product of their counts. Because for every element in the first cell and every in the second, if the first element is before the second, it's counted once. But if the second is before the first, it's not. Wait, no, the actual count between two different cells is the product, but since the order between the two cells doesn't matter, the total pairs between them is the product. Because for all elements in cell A and cell B, each pair (x from A, y from B) where x is before y is counted, and those where y is before x are not. But the total over all such pairs is exactly (countA * countB) because for each of the countA elements in A and countB in B, exactly half of the time? No, actually, the total number of ordered pairs (i,j) with i < j where s_i is in A and s_j is in B is countA * countB if all elements of A come before B. But in reality, the elements are interleaved. However, the total over all possible pairs where the two elements are from A and B (regardless of order) is countA * countB, and exactly half of them have i < j? No, that's not correct. The actual number of pairs where i < j and one is in A and the other in B is (countA * countB) minus the number of pairs where the first is in B and the second in A. But this is complicated. However, when considering all possible pairs of cells (A,B) and (B,A), the total contribution would be countA * countB + countB * countA, but since we need to count only the pairs where i < j, perhaps the correct way is to consider all ordered pairs of cells (A,B) where A comes before B in some way, but that's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute for all pairs of cells (a,b) and (c,d) where they are 1 apart, and a < c or (a == c and b < d), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, the total number of such pairs is the sum over all ordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are 1 apart, of (countA * countB), but then divide by 2? No, because when A and B are different, each unordered pair is counted twice. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have two cells X and Y which are 1 apart. The number of pairs (i,j) with i < j where s_i is in X and s_j is in Y is countX * countY. Similarly, the number of pairs where s_i is in Y and s_j is in X is countY * countX. But only the first contributes to the total when X and Y are 1 apart. Wait no, the condition is that the two strings differ in exactly one position. So if X and Y are 1 apart, then any pair between X and Y (regardless of order) would satisfy the condition. But the problem counts all pairs (i,j) with i < j where the two strings differ in exactly one position. So for two cells X and Y that are 1 apart, the total contribution is countX * countY (since for all elements in X and Y, when i is from X and j from Y and i < j, it's counted, and when i is from Y and j from X and i < j, it's also counted. Wait, no. The total number of pairs between X and Y (regardless of order) where the two strings differ by one is countX * countY. But the problem counts all i < j pairs, so the total contribution from X and Y is countX * countY (since for every element in X and Y, if they are in different cells that are 1 apart, then their pair is counted once if i < j. The total over all such ordered pairs (i,j) where i is in X and j in Y and i < j plus those where i is in Y and j in X and i < j is exactly the total number of pairs between X and Y where the two are 1 apart. But the total number of such pairs is (countX * countY) + (countY * countX) ??? No, that's not right. Wait, the total number of ordered pairs (i,j) with i < j where s_i is in X and s_j is in Y is countX * countY minus the number of pairs where i is in Y and j is in X and i < j. Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct way is to consider all ordered pairs of cells (X,Y) where X and Y are 1 apart, and add countX * countY to the total. Because for each such pair (X,Y), the number of (i,j) pairs where i is in X, j is in Y, and i < j is exactly countX * countY minus the number of pairs where j comes before i. But this is not straightforward. Alternatively, the total over all unordered pairs of cells (X,Y) where they are 1 apart, the contribution is countX * countY. Because for each such pair, the number of (i,j) with i < j is exactly countX * countY (since for all elements in X and Y, exactly one of the two is in an earlier position, so the total is countX * countY). Wait, no. Suppose there are a elements in X and b elements in Y. The total number of ordered pairs (i,j) where i is in X and j is in Y and i < j is a * b minus the number of pairs where the element in X comes after the element in Y. But the total number of all possible ordered pairs between X and Y (regardless of order) is a*b. The number of pairs where i < j is exactly (a*b + (number of pairs where i is in X and j in Y and i < j) + ...). Hmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that for any two distinct cells X and Y that are 1 apart, the total number of pairs (i,j) with i < j and s_i in X and s_j in Y (or vice versa) is exactly countX * countY. Because for every element in X and every element in Y, exactly one of the two is before the other, so the total pairs where i < j between them is countX * countY. Wait, no. Let me think of a simple example. Suppose X has 2 elements and Y has 3 elements. The total number of ordered pairs between them (i,j) where i is in X and j in Y and i < j is (number of X elements before Y elements) plus ... but actually, the total over all possible pairs where one is in X and the other in Y, the number of i < j is exactly (countX * countY) because for each pair (x in X, y in Y), exactly one of x comes before y or y comes before x. So the total number of pairs where x comes before y is exactly (countX * countY) / 2? No, that's only if the elements are interleaved. Wait, no. The total number of ordered pairs (i,j) where i is in X and j is in Y and i < j is equal to the number of all possible pairs between X and Y where the X element comes before the Y element. The total number of such pairs is exactly the same as the number of pairs where Y comes before X, so the total over all is countX * countY. So the number of i < j pairs between X and Y is exactly (countX * countY) if all elements of X come before Y, but in reality, it's variable. Wait, no. Let me think of two elements: one in X and one in Y. The pair (x,y) where x is in X and y in Y will contribute 1 if x comes before y, else 0. So for two elements, the total is 1 if x comes before y, else 0. So the total over all possible pairs between X and Y is the number of such ordered pairs where the X element is before the Y element. The total over all possible ordered pairs (i,j) where i is in X and j is in Y and i < j is equal to the sum over all x in X and y in Y of 1 if x comes before y, else 0. But this is not easy to compute. However, when considering all pairs of cells (X,Y) where X and Y are 1 apart, the total contribution to the answer is the sum over all such X and Y of (countX * countY). Because for any two elements from X and Y, if they are in different cells that are 1 apart, then their pair will be counted in the answer if they form a pair with exactly one differing character. But the problem requires that the two strings differ in exactly one position, so any pair from X and Y (where X and Y are 1 apart) will satisfy that condition. So the total number of such pairs (i,j) with i < j is exactly the sum over all pairs of cells (X,Y) that are 1 apart of (countX * countY). Because for any two elements from X and Y, exactly one of the two is in an earlier position, so the total number of ordered pairs (i,j) where i is in X and j is in Y and i < j plus those where i is in Y and j is in X and i < j is exactly countX * countY. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose X and Y are two cells differing in exactly one position. Then any pair of elements from X and Y will form a pair of strings differing in exactly one position. So all such pairs (i,j) where i is in X and j is in Y (regardless of order) will contribute to the answer if i < j. The total number of such pairs is exactly the number of all possible ordered pairs (i,j) where i is in X or Y and j is in the other, and i < j. The total over all such pairs is exactly countX * countY. Because for every element in X and every in Y, exactly one of the two is before the other, so the total number of (i,j) pairs where i is in one and j in the other and i < j is exactly countX * countY. Because for each of the countX * countY pairs between the two groups, exactly one of the two possible orderings (i,j) or (j,i) has i < j. So the total is countX * countY. Therefore, the total contribution from X and Y is countX * countY. \n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\nFor each cell (i,j), look at all neighboring cells that are 1 away (differ in exactly one coordinate). For each such neighbor (k,l), add cnt[i][j] * cnt[k][l] to the answer. However, this would count each pair (X,Y) twice: once when considering X's neighbors and Y, and once when considering Y's neighbors and X. So to avoid double-counting, we can either:\n\n- Iterate over all ordered pairs of cells (A,B) where A is before B in some way, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum for all ordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are 1 apart, and then divide the total by 2. Wait, no. Because when you consider all pairs (A,B) where they are 1 apart, each unordered pair is counted twice (once as (A,B) and once as (B,A)), so the total sum would be 2 * the desired sum. So if we compute the sum over all ordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are 1 apart, then the total would be twice the correct answer. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute the sum over all ordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are 1 apart, then divide by 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to iterate over all cells (i,j), and for each, look at all their neighbors (k,l) where (i,j) and (k,l) are 1 apart, and add cnt[i][j] * cnt[k][l] to the answer. But this would count each pair (A,B) twice (once when A is the current cell and B is the neighbor, and once when B is the current cell and A is the neighbor). So the total would be double the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer would be (sum) / 2.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the pairs (i,j) must have i < j. So the total number of such pairs between two cells A and B (which are 1 apart) is exactly countA * countB. Because for every element in A and every in B, exactly one of the two is before the other, so the total is countA * countB. So the total over all pairs of cells (A,B) that are 1 apart (regardless of order) is the sum over all such A and B of (countA * countB). Because each unordered pair (A,B) contributes countA * countB. So the total is exactly the sum over all ordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are 1 apart (A != B) of (countA * countB) divided by 2? No, no. Wait, the unordered pairs (A,B) where A and B are 1 apart contribute countA * countB. So the total is the sum over all unordered pairs (A,B) where they are 1 apart of (countA * countB). So how do I compute this?\n\nThe way to compute this is to iterate over all cells (i,j), and for each, look at all their neighbors (k,l) where (i,j) and (k,l) are 1 apart. For each such neighbor, add cnt[i][j] * cnt[k][l] to the total. However, this counts each unordered pair twice (once as (i,j) and (k,l), once as (k,l) and (i,j)), so the total would be double the correct answer. Therefore, the correct approach is to compute the sum over all ordered pairs (i,j) and (k,l) where they are 1 apart and (i,j) comes before (k,l) in some ordering, but that's complicated. Alternatively, compute the sum as described and then divide by 2. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the answer is exactly the sum over all unordered pairs of cells (A,B) that are 1 apart of (countA * countB). Because each such pair contributes countA * countB pairs (i,j) where i is in A and j in B and i < j, plus those where i is in B and j in A and i < j. Wait no, no. Wait, the countA * countB is exactly the number of pairs between A and B where the two elements are from different cells and form a pair differing in one character. Because for any two elements from A and B, their pair is counted in the answer if they are in different cells that are 1 apart. So the total for A and B is countA * countB. So the total over all such unordered pairs (A,B) is the sum over all A and B (A < B in some sense) of countA * countB. But how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, the total is the sum for all cells (i,j) of (count[i][j] multiplied by the sum of counts of all their neighbors). Because for each cell (i,j), the number of pairs where this cell is paired with a neighbor is count[i][j] * (sum of counts of neighbors). But this counts each pair (A,B) twice (once when A is the current cell and B is the neighbor, and once when B is the current cell and A is the neighbor). So the total would be twice the desired answer. Therefore, the correct answer is (sum over all cells (i,j) of (count[i][j] * sum of neighbors' counts)) divided by 2.\n\nYes, that's a better approach. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote for each cell (i,j), the sum of counts of all neighboring cells (those differing in exactly one position) as S. Then the total contribution from (i,j) is count[i][j] * S. But when you do this for all cells, you are counting each pair (A,B) twice (once when A is the cell and B is a neighbor, and once when B is the cell and A is a neighbor). So the total sum would be 2 * the desired answer. Therefore, the desired answer is (total_sum) / 2.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm steps are:\n\n1. For each test case:\n\n   a. Read n strings, count their occurrences in a 26x26 array cnt.\n\n   b. Compute for each cell (i,j) the sum of the counts of all neighboring cells (those differing in exactly one coordinate).\n\n   c. For each cell (i,j), add cnt[i][j] * (sum of neighbors) to a total.\n\n   d. The answer is total / 2.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in code.\n\nLooking at the existing code:\n\nIn the current code, after reading all the strings and filling the cnt array, the code needs to compute the answer. The current code has a loop over each string, and inside that, a loop over j from 0 to 25. But that's probably not needed. The inner loop for j=0 to 25 is probably a placeholder. The code is incomplete in the for loop for each string.\n\nWait, looking at the code:\n\nIn the for loop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\nString s = sc.nextLine();\n\nThen for(int j=0; j<26; j++) { /* TODO: Your code here */ }\n\nThen, cnt[s.charAt(0)-'a'][s.charAt(1)-'a']++;\n\nWait, that inner loop for j is probably a mistake. Because the code is supposed to count the occurrences of each string. The current code is incrementing the correct cell, but the inner loop over j is doing nothing. So that's probably a mistake in the template. The user probably intended to have some code there but left it as a placeholder. But the correct way is to just increment the cnt array for the current string. So the inner loop over j is unnecessary and should be removed. So the code for reading the strings is okay except for that loop, which should be removed.\n\nSo the first step is to fix that part. The code currently has:\n\nfor(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) {\n    String s = sc.nextLine();\n    for(int j = 0 ; j < 26 ; j++){\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n    cnt[s.charAt(0)-'a'][s.charAt(1)-'a']++;\n}\n\nThe inner for loop over j is not needed. So that should be removed. So the code for reading the strings is okay except for that loop, which can be deleted.\n\nNow, the main part is to compute the answer. The code currently has ans initialized to 0, but after filling the cnt array, it needs to compute the sum as per the algorithm above.\n\nSo after filling the cnt array, the code should loop through each cell (i,j), compute the sum of all neighboring cells, multiply by cnt[i][j], add to the total, then divide by 2 at the end.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nInitialize total to 0.\n\nLoop over all i from 0 to 25:\n\n   Loop over all j from 0 to 25:\n\n      current count is cnt[i][j]\n\n      if current count is 0, skip.\n\n      Now, find all neighboring cells (x,y) which are 1 away from (i,j).\n\n      The neighbors are:\n\n         either first character differs by 1, second same: but wait, no. Wait, the neighbors are those cells that differ in exactly one position. So for (i,j), the neighbors are:\n\n         All cells (i, k) where k != j (so first character same, second different) \u2192 no, wait, no. Wait, the two positions are the first and second characters. So the cells differing in exactly one position are:\n\n         Either the first character is different and the second same \u2192 but that would require the first character to be different, but the second same. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\n         To have exactly one differing position between (i,j) and (x,y):\n\n         Either:\n\n         (i != x and j == y) \u2192 first position differs, second same.\n\n         OR\n\n         (i == x and j != y) \u2192 second position differs, first same.\n\n         So the neighbors of (i,j) are all cells (x,y) where either x != i and y = j, or x = i and y != j. But also, x and y must be between 0 and 25 (since they are letters a-z). \n\n         So for each (i,j), the neighbors are:\n\n         For all possible x in 0..25 except i, with y = j \u2192 but that's all cells in the same column but different row.\n\n         Plus all possible y in 0..25 except j, with x = i \u2192 all cells in the same row but different column.\n\n         But this would include all cells differing in exactly one coordinate. \n\n         However, this is a lot of cells. For each (i,j), there are (25 + 25) neighbors? Because for the first case (x != i, y = j), there are 25 possibilities (since x can be any except i). Similarly for the second case (y != j, x = i), 25 possibilities. So total 50 neighbors per cell. \n\n         But this is manageable, since 26*26 cells, each with 50 neighbors \u2192 26*26*50 = 33,800 operations, which is acceptable.\n\n         So for each cell (i,j), we need to iterate over all possible neighbors and sum their counts.\n\n         Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the sum more efficiently.\n\n         Let me think of how to compute the sum for a cell (i,j):\n\n         The sum is equal to:\n\n         (sum over all x != i of cnt[x][j]) + (sum over all y != j of cnt[i][y])\n\n         Because:\n\n         The first part is all cells in the same column (j) but different row (x != i) \u2192 differing in first character.\n\n         The second part is all cells in the same row (i) but different column (y != j) \u2192 differing in second character.\n\n         So the total sum for neighbors is (sum of column j excluding (i,j)) + (sum of row i excluding (i,j)).\n\n         Wait, but the first term is sum over x of cnt[x][j] minus cnt[i][j], because x can be any except i. Wait, no:\n\n         The first term is sum_{x != i} cnt[x][j] \u2192 which is (sum_{x=0 to 25} cnt[x][j]) - cnt[i][j].\n\n         The second term is sum_{y != j} cnt[i][y] \u2192 (sum_{y=0 to 25} cnt[i][y]) - cnt[i][j].\n\n         So the total sum for neighbors is (col_sum[j] - cnt[i][j]) + (row_sum[i] - cnt[i][j]).\n\n         Where col_sum[j] is the sum of the j-th column (all rows), and row_sum[i] is the sum of the i-th row (all columns).\n\n         So if we precompute row_sums and col_sums, then for each cell (i,j), the neighbor sum can be computed quickly.\n\n         That would be more efficient. Let's see:\n\n         Precompute two arrays:\n\n         row_sums[i] = sum_{j=0 to 25} cnt[i][j]\n\n         col_sums[j] = sum_{i=0 to 25} cnt[i][j]\n\n         Then, for cell (i,j):\n\n         sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - cnt[i][j]) + (row_sums[i] - cnt[i][j])\n\n         So this way, for each cell, the neighbor sum can be computed in O(1) time, after precomputing the row and column sums.\n\n         That would be better, as it reduces the per-cell computation from O(50) to O(1).\n\n         So the steps would be:\n\n         1. Precompute row_sums and col_sums.\n\n         2. For each cell (i,j):\n\n             current_count = cnt[i][j]\n\n             if current_count == 0, skip.\n\n             sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - current_count) + (row_sums[i] - current_count)\n\n             total += current_count * sum_neighbors\n\n         3. The answer is total / 2.\n\n         That's a good plan.\n\n         So in code:\n\n         After filling the cnt array, compute row_sums and col_sums.\n\n         Then compute the total as described.\n\n         Let's see how to code this.\n\n         So in the code, after the for loop that reads all the strings and fills the cnt array, we need to compute row_sums and col_sums.\n\n         Let me see:\n\n         So inside the test case loop:\n\n         After reading all the strings and filling cnt, we can compute row_sums and col_sums.\n\n         So code steps:\n\n         int[][] cnt = new int[26][26]; // already initialized.\n\n         Then after filling cnt:\n\n         // compute row_sums and col_sums\n\n         int[] row_sums = new int[26];\n\n         int[] col_sums = new int[26];\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 row_sums[i] += cnt[i][j];\n\n                 col_sums[j] += cnt[i][j];\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         Then, compute the total:\n\n         long total = 0;\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 if (cnt[i][j] == 0) continue;\n\n                 int current = cnt[i][j];\n\n                 int sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - current) + (row_sums[i] - current);\n\n                 total += (long) current * sum_neighbors;\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         ans = total / 2;\n\n         Then, print ans.\n\n         So that's the plan.\n\n         Now, looking back at the code provided:\n\n         The code currently has:\n\n         for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) {\n\n             String s = sc.nextLine();\n\n             for(int j = 0 ; j < 26 ; j++){\n\n                 /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n             }\n\n             cnt[s.charAt(0)-'a'][s.charAt(1)-'a']++;\n\n         }\n\n         The inner loop over j is unnecessary and should be removed. So the code for reading the strings is okay except for that loop, which can be deleted.\n\n         Then, after filling the cnt array, the code needs to compute the row and column sums, then compute the total as above.\n\n         So the missing code is the part after filling the cnt array, before printing ans.\n\n         The current code has ans initialized to 0, but it's not being updated. So the code needs to add the code to compute the row and column sums, then compute the total and set ans = total / 2.\n\n         So putting this all together, the code after reading the strings would be:\n\n         // After reading all strings and filling cnt:\n\n         // compute row and column sums\n\n         int[] row_sums = new int[26];\n\n         int[] col_sums = new int[26];\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 row_sums[i] += cnt[i][j];\n\n                 col_sums[j] += cnt[i][j];\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         long total = 0;\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 int current = cnt[i][j];\n\n                 if (current == 0) continue;\n\n                 int sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - current) + (row_sums[i] - current);\n\n                 total += (long) current * sum_neighbors;\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         ans = total / 2;\n\n         Then, System.out.println(ans);\n\n         So that's the code that needs to be filled in.\n\n         Now, looking at the original code's structure:\n\n         The code inside the test case loop is:\n\n         while(t-->0) {\n\n             int n = sc.nextInt();\n\n             sc.nextLine();\n\n             int cnt[][] = new int[26][26];\n\n             long ans = 0;\n\n             for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) {\n\n                 String s = sc.nextLine();\n\n                 for(int j = 0 ; j < 26 ; j++){\n\n                     /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n                 }\n\n                 cnt[s.charAt(0)-'a'][s.charAt(1)-'a']++;\n\n             }\n\n             System.out.println(ans);\n\n         }\n\n         So the code after the for loop (reading the strings) needs to compute the row and column sums, then compute the total and set ans.\n\n         So the missing code is the part after the for loop over the strings, before the print statement.\n\n         So the code to add is:\n\n         // compute row and column sums\n\n         int[] row_sums = new int[26];\n\n         int[] col_sums = new int[26];\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 row_sums[i] += cnt[i][j];\n\n                 col_sums[j] += cnt[i][j];\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         long total = 0;\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 int current = cnt[i][j];\n\n                 if (current == 0) continue;\n\n                 int sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - current) + (row_sums[i] - current);\n\n                 total += (long) current * sum_neighbors;\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         ans = total / 2;\n\n         So that's the code to be inserted after the for loop over the strings and before the print statement.\n\n         Also, the inner loop over j in the string reading loop (the for (int j=0; j<26; j++) loop) should be removed. But since the user's instruction says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to remove that loop is not part of the answer. The user's instruction says to output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. So the code to remove the inner loop is not part of the answer. The user's code has that loop as a placeholder, but the correct code should not have it. However, the problem says to output only the missing code. So perhaps the code to be filled in is the part after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is to be left as is but not part of the answer. Wait, but the inner loop is inside the for loop over the strings, and it's doing nothing. So the code as given has that loop, but the correct code should remove it. However, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. So perhaps the code to be filled in is the part after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be removed.

But that would leave the code with an unnecessary loop, which would cause it to run slowly. Hmm, this is a problem.\n\n         Wait, the user's code has:\n\n         for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++) {\n\n             String s = sc.nextLine();\n\n             for(int j = 0 ; j < 26 ; j++){\n\n                 /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n             }\n\n             cnt[s.charAt(0)-'a'][s.charAt(1)-'a']++;\n\n         }\n\n         The inner loop over j is doing nothing. So the correct code must remove that loop. But the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. So perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be removed. But since the user says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is to be left as is but the user is expected to know to remove it. But the problem says to output only the missing code. So perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be removed. However, the user's instruction says to output only the missing code, so perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be left as is. But that would leave the code with an unnecessary loop, which would cause it to run in O(n*26) time, which for n up to 1e5 would be 2.6e6 operations, which is acceptable, but the loop is doing nothing. So perhaps the user's code has a mistake, and the correct code must remove that loop. But since the user says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be left as is. But that would leave the code with an error. \n\n         Alternatively, perhaps the inner loop is a mistake in the template, and the correct code should not have it.

But since the user says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be left as is.

But since the user says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be left as is. \n\n         This is a bit ambiguous, but given the problem statement, the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings. The inner loop is part of the existing code but is incorrect and should be removed. However, since the user says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be left as is.

But since the user says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings, and the inner loop is part of the existing code but should be left as is. \n\n         Anyway, proceeding with the code that I have, which is the code after the for loop over the strings. The inner loop is part of the existing code but is unnecessary and should be removed, but since the user says to output only the missing code, perhaps the code to be filled in is the code after the for loop over the strings. \n\n         So the missing code is the code after the for loop over the strings, which is the code to compute row_sums, col_sums, total, and set ans. \n\n         So the code to be filled in is:\n\n         // compute row and column sums\n\n         int[] row_sums = new int[26];\n\n         int[] col_sums = new int[26];\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 row_sums[i] += cnt[i][j];\n\n                 col_sums[j] += cnt[i][j];\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         long total = 0;\n\n         for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {\n\n             for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {\n\n                 int current = cnt[i][j];\n\n                 if (current == 0) continue;\n\n                 int sum_neighbors = (col_sums[j] - current) + (row_sums[i] - current);\n\n                 total += (long) current * sum_neighbors;\n\n             }\n\n         }\n\n         ans = total / 2;\n\n         So this is the code that needs to be inserted after the for loop over the strings and before the print statement.\n\n         Also, the inner loop over j in the string reading loop must be removed. But since the user says to output only the missing code, perhaps that's not part of the answer. \n\n         So the final answer is the code above."
