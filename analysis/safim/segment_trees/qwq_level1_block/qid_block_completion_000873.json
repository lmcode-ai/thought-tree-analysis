Then for each j, subtract arr[i][j], so after subtracting all j's, sum would be zero. But in the loop, for each j, before subtracting, the code does sum -= arr[i][j], then multiplies (sum - arr[i][j]?) Wait, no. Let me retrace:\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nlong sum = counter[i]; // total starting with i.\n\nfor each j from 0 to 10:\n\nsum -= arr[i][j]; // subtract the count of (i,j) pairs. then ans += sum * arr[i][j] Wait, so for each j, the term is (sum_before_subtracting_j - arr[i][j]) * arr[i][j] ? Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nInitially, sum is counter[i]. Then, for j=0:\n\nsum -= arr[i][0], so sum becomes counter[i] - arr[i][0]\n\nthen ans += (counter[i] - arr[i][0]) * arr[i][0]\n\nThen for j=1:\n\nsum is now counter[i] - arr[i][0] - arr[i][1]\n\nso ans += (counter[i] - arr[i][0] - arr[i][1]) * arr[i][1]\n\nand so on. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me think of an example. Suppose for a particular i, the counts for j are:\n\narr[i][0] = a, arr[i][1] = b, arr[i][2] = c, etc. The total counter[i] is a + b + c + ... The sum starts at a + b + c + ... Then for j=0:\n\nsum becomes (a + b + c ...) - a = (b + c + ...)\n\nthen ans += (b + c + ...) * a \n\nThen for j=1:\n\nsum is (b + c + ...) - b = (c + ...)\n\nans += (c + ...) * b \n\nand so on. Adding all these terms:\n\nThe total for this i would be a*(b + c + ...) + b*(c + ...) + ... Which is equal to (a*b + a*c + ... + b*c + ...). Wait, because a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c, and then b*(c) is b*c. So the total is the sum over all j1 < j2 of (arr[i][j1] * arr[i][j2]) * 2? Wait no, because for each pair (j1, j2), the product arr[i][j1] * arr[i][j2] is counted once in j1's term and once in j2's term? Wait no, let me see:\n\nWait, the total for the terms would be:\n\nsum_{j} [ (sum_{k != j} arr[i][k}) ) * arr[i][j] ] Which can be rewritten as sum_{j} [ (counter[i] - arr[i][j}) * arr[i][j} ]\n\nWhich is equal to sum_{j} [ counter[i] * arr[i][j} - (arr[i][j})^2 ]\n\nThe total over all j would be counter[i] * (sum arr[i][j}) ) - sum (arr[i][j]^2 ) But since sum arr[i][j} is counter[i], this becomes counter[i]^2 - sum (arr[i][j]^2 ) So the total for each i is (counter[i]^2 - sum (arr[i][j]^2 )) / 2 ? Wait, because the ans variable is accumulating this. Wait, the code's ans is adding all these terms. Wait, the code's ans is the sum over all i and j of (counter[i] - arr[i][j}) * arr[i][j} \n\nWhich is equal to sum_i [ (counter[i]^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2) ) ]\n\nSo the total ans from calculatePairs would be sum_i (counter[i]^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2) ) Hmm, but how does that relate to the problem?

So endToStart is the reverse: for each string, the second character is the first index, and the first character is the second. So for the second calculatePairs, the counter is endsWithCounter (count of second characters), and the array is endToStart, which counts for each second character (as the first index) and first character (as the second index). So the second calculatePairs would compute the same as the first, but for the second case. So the first calculatePairs gives twice the number of pairs differing in the second character (same first, different second).",

So the correct ans should be (calculatePairs(...) + calculatePairs(...)) / 2. Therefore, the code is missing a division by 2. Hmm, that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach is different. Let me think of the problem again. The problem requires pairs of strings differing in exactly one position. Each such pair can be in one of two cases: Case 1: first characters differ, second are same. Case 2: second characters differ, first are same. The total is the sum of these two cases. The code's first calculatePairs is for case 2 (same first, different second). The second calculatePairs is for case 1 (same second, different first). Each of these calculatePairs returns twice the count of their respective cases (because they count ordered pairs). Thus, the total is (case1_count + case2_count) = (calculatePairs1 + calculatePairs2)/2. Therefore, the code's current ans is twice the correct answer. Hence, the code needs to divide the ans by 2. So in the main function, after calculating ans = ... , it should be ans /= 2. Wait, but looking at the code's current line:\n\nlong ans = calculatePairs(startsWithCounter, startToEnd) + calculatePairs(endsWithCounter, endToStart); So the code is adding the two terms, each of which is twice the desired count. Thus, the correct ans is (sum) / 2.",

So the code inside the while loop (n-- >0) should be:\n\nString s = sc.next(); int first = s.charAt(0) - 'a';\n\nint second = s.charAt(1) - 'a';\n\nstartsWithCounter[first]++;\n\nendsWithCounter[second]++;\n\nstartToEnd[first][second]++;\n\nendToStart[second][first]++; That's the missing code.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. The task is to count the number of pairs of strings where each pair differs in exactly one position. Since each string is of length 2, that means either the first character is different and the second is the same, or vice versa.\n\nLooking at the code provided, there's a main method and a helper method called calculatePairs. The main method reads the input and initializes some arrays. The variables startsWithCounter and endsWithCounter probably count how many strings start with each character (0-10 since 'a' to 'k' are 11 letters) and similarly for the ending character. The startToEnd and endToStart arrays might be tracking pairs where the first character is from one and the second from another?\n\nHmm, the code inside the while loop (where n is decremented) is where each string is processed. The TODO comment indicates that's where I need to add code. Let's think: for each string, we need to update these counters.\n\nEach string is two characters. Let's say the first character is c1 and the second is c2. Their indices would be (c1 - 'a') and (c2 - 'a'), since they are from 'a' to 'k', which is 0 to 10.\n\nSo for startsWithCounter, we should increment startsWithCounter[c1Index] by 1. Similarly, endsWithCounter[c2Index] +=1. \n\nThen, the startToEnd array might be tracking how many times a pair of first and second characters occur together. Like, for each string, the first character is the row and the second is the column. So startToEnd[c1][c2] would count how many times that exact pair occurs. Similarly, endToStart might be the reverse, but maybe not necessary? Wait, perhaps the startToEnd is for the first character to the second, and endToStart is for the second to the first? Not sure yet.\n\nWait, looking at the calculatePairs method. The parameters are counter and arr. The method loops through each i (from 0-10), then for each j, subtracts arr[i][j] from sum (which is initially counter[i]). Then adds sum * arr[i][j] to the answer. \n\nHmm, maybe the idea is that for each starting character i, the total pairs where the first character is i and the second differs in exactly one position. Wait, perhaps the approach is to separate the problem into two parts: pairs that differ in the first character only, and those that differ in the second character only. Then sum those two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to compute the pairs where the first characters are the same and the second differ by one, and vice versa. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is structured to handle the two possible differing positions separately. Like, for the first position differing, we can look at all pairs where the first characters are different and the second are the same. Similarly for the second position. \n\nWait, the problem requires exactly one differing position. So two cases: either first characters differ and second are same, or second differ and first same. \n\nThe code's approach might be splitting this into two parts. The calculatePairs function is called twice, once for the first case and once for the second. \n\nLooking at the main method, the ans is the sum of calculatePairs on startsWithCounter and startToEnd, plus the same with endsWithCounter and endToStart. \n\nHmm, perhaps startsWithCounter counts the number of strings starting with each character. The startToEnd array counts how many times each pair (c1, c2) occurs. So for the first case (differing in first character, same second), we can compute for each pair of first characters (i and j) where i != j, but the second characters are the same. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the calculatePairs function is designed to compute the number of pairs where the first characters are the same and the second differ by exactly one? Or maybe the other way around?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute for each possible first character, the number of pairs where the first characters are the same, and the second characters differ by exactly one. Then, similarly for the second characters. \n\nWait, let's think of the first part: calculatePairs(startsWithCounter, startToEnd). The startsWithCounter[i] is the total number of strings starting with i. The startToEnd[i][j] is the count of strings where first is i and second is j. \n\nIn the calculatePairs function, for each i, the sum starts as counter[i], which is the total number of strings starting with i. Then, for each j, subtract arr[i][j], which would be the count of strings with first i and second j. So sum after subtracting arr[i][j] would be the total starting with i minus those that have second character j. Then, the term sum * arr[i][j] would be (total starting with i - count of (i,j)) multiplied by the count of (i,j). Wait, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is trying to compute the number of pairs where the first characters are the same (since we're looking at startsWithCounter), but the second characters differ by exactly one. \n\nWait, let's think of the first case: pairs that differ in exactly the second character. So their first characters must be the same, and their second characters differ by exactly one. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem requires exactly one differing position. So for two strings to differ in exactly the second character, their first characters must be the same, and their second characters must be different. But the difference must be exactly one position. So the second characters can be any different, but only one position. Wait, no, the difference in exactly one position is that exactly one of the two characters differ. So for two strings to differ in exactly the second character, their first characters must be the same, and their second characters must differ. \n\nWait, but the problem counts pairs where exactly one of the two positions differ. So for two strings s and t, either s[0] != t[0] and s[1] == t[1], or s[0] == t[0] and s[1] != t[1]. \n\nSo the total pairs are the sum over all pairs of the two cases. \n\nThe code's approach might be splitting this into two parts: \n\n1. Pairs where the first characters are the same, and the second differ (so differing in the second position). \n\n2. Pairs where the second characters are the same, and the first differ (differing in the first position). \n\nThen, the total is the sum of these two. \n\nSo for the first part (same first, different second), the number of such pairs is the sum over all first characters c, of (number of strings with first c choose 2) minus the number of pairs where their second characters are the same. Wait, no. Wait, the number of pairs with same first and different second is equal to (total with first c) choose 2 minus the number of pairs that have same second. \n\nAlternatively, for each first character c, the total pairs with same first is C(n_c, 2). From this, subtract the number of pairs that have same second character. The remaining would be the pairs where the second characters differ. \n\nWait, but the problem requires exactly one differing position. So for pairs with same first and different second, that's exactly one differing position (the second). So the count for this case is the total pairs with same first, minus those that have same second (since those would have zero differing). \n\nWait, the total pairs with same first is (count of first c) choose 2. The number of pairs where both first and second are same is the sum over all second characters of (count of (c, s) choose 2). So the number of pairs with same first but different second is (total_c choose 2) - sum_{s} (count(c,s) choose 2). \n\nBut how does the code's calculatePairs function compute this?\n\nLooking at the code's calculatePairs function:\n\nThe function loops over each i (the first character). The sum starts as counter[i], which is the total number of strings starting with i. Then, for each j (the second character), it subtracts arr[i][j], which is the count of (i,j) pairs. So sum after subtracting arr[i][j] would be (total starting with i) - count of (i,j). \n\nThen, ans += sum * arr[i][j]. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsum starts as counter[i] (total starting with i). Then for each j, subtract arr[i][j], so after subtracting all j's, sum would be zero. But in the loop, for each j, before subtracting, the code does sum -= arr[i][j], then multiplies (sum - arr[i][j]?) Wait, no. Let me retrace:\n\nWait, the code is:\n\nlong sum = counter[i]; // total starting with i.\n\nfor each j from 0 to 10:\n\nsum -= arr[i][j]; // subtract the count of (i,j) pairs.\n\nthen ans += sum * arr[i][j]\n\nWait, so for each j, the term is (sum_before_subtracting_j - arr[i][j]) * arr[i][j] ?\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nInitially, sum is counter[i]. \n\nThen, for j=0:\n\nsum -= arr[i][0], so sum becomes counter[i] - arr[i][0]\n\nthen ans += (counter[i] - arr[i][0]) * arr[i][0]\n\nThen for j=1:\n\nsum is now counter[i] - arr[i][0] - arr[i][1]\n\nso ans += (counter[i] - arr[i][0] - arr[i][1]) * arr[i][1]\n\nand so on.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me think of an example. Suppose for a particular i, the counts for j are:\n\narr[i][0] = a, arr[i][1] = b, arr[i][2] = c, etc. \n\nThe total counter[i] is a + b + c + ... \n\nThe sum starts at a + b + c + ... \n\nThen for j=0:\n\nsum becomes (a + b + c ...) - a = (b + c + ...)\n\nthen ans += (b + c + ...) * a \n\nThen for j=1:\n\nsum is (b + c + ...) - b = (c + ...)\n\nans += (c + ...) * b \n\nand so on. \n\nAdding all these terms:\n\nThe total for this i would be a*(b + c + ...) + b*(c + ...) + ... \n\nWhich is equal to (a*b + a*c + ... + b*c + ...). \n\nWait, because a*(b + c) = a*b + a*c, and then b*(c) is b*c. So the total is the sum over all j1 < j2 of (arr[i][j1] * arr[i][j2]) * 2? Wait no, because for each pair (j1, j2), the product arr[i][j1] * arr[i][j2] is counted once in j1's term and once in j2's term? Wait no, let me see:\n\nWait, the total for the terms would be:\n\nsum_{j} [ (sum_{k != j} arr[i][k}) ) * arr[i][j] ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as sum_{j} [ (counter[i] - arr[i][j}) * arr[i][j} ]\n\nWhich is equal to sum_{j} [ counter[i] * arr[i][j} - (arr[i][j})^2 ]\n\nThe total over all j would be counter[i] * (sum arr[i][j}) ) - sum (arr[i][j]^2 )\n\nBut since sum arr[i][j} is counter[i], this becomes counter[i]^2 - sum (arr[i][j]^2 )\n\nSo the total for each i is (counter[i]^2 - sum (arr[i][j]^2 )) / 2 ?\n\nWait, because the ans variable is accumulating this. Wait, the code's ans is adding all these terms. \n\nWait, the code's ans is the sum over all i and j of (counter[i] - arr[i][j}) * arr[i][j} \n\nWhich is equal to sum_i [ (counter[i]^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2) ) ]\n\nSo the total ans from calculatePairs would be sum_i (counter[i]^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2) )\n\nHmm, but how does that relate to the problem?\n\nWait, the problem requires pairs of strings that differ in exactly one position. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we are considering the first case (differing in the second character). So the first characters must be the same, and the second characters must differ. \n\nThe number of such pairs is the total number of pairs with same first character minus the number of pairs with same first and same second. \n\nThe total pairs with same first is C(n_i, 2) where n_i is the count of first characters. \n\nThe number of pairs with same first and same second is sum over j of C(arr[i][j], 2). \n\nSo the desired count for this case is sum_i [ C(n_i, 2) - sum_j C(arr[i][j], 2) ]\n\nBut the code's calculatePairs function returns sum_i (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2) ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe code's ans is sum_i (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2) )\n\nWait, but the actual desired value for the first case is sum_i [ (n_i choose 2) - sum_j (arr[i][j] choose 2) ]\n\nWhich is equal to sum_i [ (n_i*(n_i-1)/2) - sum_j (arr[i][j]*(arr[i][j]-1)/2) ]\n\n= (1/2) sum_i [ n_i^2 - n_i - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2 - arr[i][j}) ]\n\n= (1/2) [ sum_i (n_i^2 - sum_j arr[i][j]^2) ) - sum_i (n_i - sum_j arr[i][j} ) ]\n\nBut since sum_j arr[i][j} = n_i, the second term becomes sum_i (n_i - n_i) = 0. \n\nSo the desired value is (1/2)(sum_i (n_i^2 - sum_j arr[i][j]^2) )\n\nSo the code's calculatePairs function returns exactly the numerator of that, but without dividing by 2. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the code is missing a division by 2? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the approach here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is considering ordered pairs (i,j) where i < j, so the total is exactly (sum_i (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2 )) ) / 2 ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe code's calculatePairs returns the sum over all i and j of (counter[i] - arr[i][j}) * arr[i][j} \n\nWhich is equal to sum_i [ counter[i]^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2) ]\n\nBut how does this relate to the desired count?\n\nSuppose for a particular i, the first character is fixed. The number of pairs of strings with first character i and differing in the second character is the number of pairs where their second characters are different. \n\nThe total number of such pairs is (number of strings with first i choose 2) minus the number of pairs with same second. \n\nThe number of pairs with same second is sum over j of (arr[i][j] choose 2). \n\nSo the desired count for this i is (n_i choose 2) - sum_j (arr[i][j] choose 2). \n\nThe code's term for this i is (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)). \n\nLet me compute the difference between the code's term and the desired term:\n\n(n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)) = (n_i choose 2)*2 + (sum_j arr[i][j]^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2 - arr[i][j} )) )? Not sure. \n\nWait, let's compute (n_i choose 2) - sum_j (arr[i][j] choose 2) \n\n= [n_i(n_i-1)/2] - sum_j [ arr[i][j] (arr[i][j] -1)/2 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nn_i(n_i-1) - sum_j [ arr[i][j]^2 - arr[i][j} ]\n\n= n_i^2 - n_i - sum_j arr[i][j]^2 + sum_j arr[i][j} \n\nBut sum_j arr[i][j} is n_i, so this becomes n_i^2 - n_i - sum_j arr[i][j]^2 + n_i \n\n= n_i^2 - sum_j arr[i][j]^2 \n\nSo the desired term multiplied by 2 equals the code's term. \n\nTherefore, the code's calculatePairs function returns the sum over all i of (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)), which is exactly twice the desired value for the first case (differing in second character). \n\nTherefore, the code's approach is to compute the first case (same first, different second) as calculatePairs(startsWithCounter, startToEnd), which gives twice the actual count. Similarly, the second case (same second, different first) is calculatePairs(endsWithCounter, endToStart), which would also be twice the actual count. \n\nWait, but then adding them and dividing by 2 would give the correct total. But in the main function, the code is adding them directly. \n\nWait, the code's ans is calculatePairs(...) + calculatePairs(...). So that would be (twice first case + twice second case). But the correct total is (first case + second case). \n\nHmm, that suggests that the code is wrong. But perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is different. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the first calculatePairs is for the case where the first characters are the same and the second differ. The code's function returns the sum over all i of (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)), which is twice the desired count for that case. \n\nSimilarly, the second calculatePairs (with endsWithCounter and endToStart) would be for the case where the second characters are the same and the first differ. \n\nSo the total would be (twice first case + twice second case) / 2? \n\nWait, but the code is adding them directly. So the code's answer would be twice the correct total. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct, but I'm misunderstanding the parameters. \n\nWait, maybe the first calculatePairs is for the first case (same first, different second), and the second is for the second case (same second, different first). \n\nThe code's calculatePairs function returns the sum over all i of (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)), which is twice the first case. \n\nSimilarly, the second calculatePairs would be for the second case, so the code's total is (twice first case + twice second case). \n\nBut the correct answer is first case + second case. \n\nSo the code is wrong by a factor of 2. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is different. Let me think of the code's variables again. \n\nThe startsWithCounter counts the number of strings starting with each first character. The startToEnd[i][j] counts the number of strings with first i and second j. \n\nThe calculatePairs function for startsWithCounter and startToEnd would compute the number of pairs where the first characters are the same, and the second characters differ. \n\nWait, the code's function returns sum_i (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)). \n\nWhich is equal to sum_i [ (sum_j arr[i][j})^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2) ]\n\nWhich is equal to sum_i [ sum_{j != k} arr[i][j] * arr[i][k} ]\n\nBecause (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So (sum a)^2 - sum a\u00b2 = 2*(sum_{i<j} a_i a_j). \n\nWait, so sum_{j !=k} arr[i][j] * arr[i][k} = 2 * sum_{j <k} arr[i][j] * arr[i][k} \n\nSo the total sum over i of that is 2 * sum_{i} sum_{j <k} arr[i][j] * arr[i][k} \n\nWhich is exactly twice the number of pairs of strings with same first character and different second characters. \n\nBecause for each such pair, they have first character i, and their second characters are j and k (j !=k). Each such pair is counted once in arr[i][j] * arr[i][k}, but since order matters (j and k can be swapped), the total is 2 * the actual count. \n\nWait, but the code's calculatePairs function returns the total sum, which is exactly twice the desired count for the first case. \n\nSimilarly, the second calculatePairs (with endsWithCounter and endToStart) would compute twice the count for the second case (same second character, different first). \n\nTherefore, the code's ans is (twice first case + twice second case). But the correct answer is first case + second case. \n\nSo the code is wrong by a factor of 2. \n\nHmm, so that's a problem. \n\nWait, but looking at the code's main function, the ans is set to calculatePairs(...) + calculatePairs(...). So that would be twice the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the code is incorrect. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the code's approach is wrong, and I need to fix it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the parameters. Let me check the parameters again. \n\nThe first calculatePairs is called with startsWithCounter and startToEnd. \n\nThe startsWithCounter is the count of first characters. The startToEnd is the count of (first, second) pairs. \n\nThe second calculatePairs is called with endsWithCounter and endToStart. \n\nThe endsWithCounter counts the number of strings ending with each second character. The endToStart is probably the count of (second, first) pairs. \n\nWait, perhaps the endToStart is the count of (second character, first character). So for a string with first c1 and second c2, endToStart[c2][c1] is incremented. \n\nWait, in the code's main method, the variables startToEnd and endToStart are initialized as int[11][11]. \n\nBut in the loop where each string is processed, the code is missing. So perhaps for each string s, which is two characters, we need to do:\n\nchar c1 = s.charAt(0), c2 = s.charAt(1);\n\nint first = c1 - 'a', second = c2 - 'a';\n\nThen, startsWithCounter[first]++;\n\nendsWithCounter[second]++;\n\nstartToEnd[first][second]++;\n\nendToStart[second][first]++;\n\nAh, right. So endToStart is the reverse: for each string, the second character is the first index, and the first character is the second. \n\nSo for the second calculatePairs, the counter is endsWithCounter (count of second characters), and the array is endToStart, which counts for each second character (as the first index) and first character (as the second index). \n\nSo the second calculatePairs would compute the same as the first, but for the second case. \n\nSo the first calculatePairs gives twice the number of pairs differing in the second character (same first, different second). \n\nThe second calculatePairs gives twice the number of pairs differing in the first character (same second, different first). \n\nThus, the total ans is (twice first case + twice second case) which is twice the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the code is wrong. \n\nHmm, so the code's current approach is incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the code needs to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I made a mistake. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem requires the number of unordered pairs (i,j) with i < j. \n\nThe code's calculatePairs function returns the sum over all i of (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)), which is equal to the total number of ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b have the same first character and different second characters. Because for each such pair, (a, b) and (b,a) are both counted. \n\nWait, no. Let me think of two strings with first character i, and second characters j and k (j !=k). The ordered pairs (a, b) and (b,a) are both counted in the sum. \n\nThe total number of ordered pairs where first is same and second differ is 2 * the number of unordered pairs. \n\nSo the code's calculatePairs returns exactly that. \n\nTherefore, the code's ans is (number of ordered pairs for first case) + (number of ordered pairs for second case). \n\nBut the problem requires unordered pairs. \n\nWait, the problem says \"pairs of indices (i,j) such that i < j\". So the answer is the number of unordered pairs. \n\nTherefore, the code's current approach is counting ordered pairs (i,j) where i and j are in any order, but the problem wants only i < j. \n\nWait, but the code's calculatePairs function returns the total number of ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b have same first and different second. \n\nSo the total for the first case is (number of ordered pairs) which is twice the unordered count. \n\nSimilarly for the second case. \n\nThus, the code's ans is (2 * first_case + 2 * second_case) which is twice the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the code is wrong. \n\nHmm, so the code needs to be fixed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the code's calculatePairs function is actually returning the correct count. Let me re-express the code's calculation. \n\nThe code's calculatePairs function returns sum_i (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)). \n\nWhich is equal to sum_{i,j,k} arr[i][j] * arr[i][k] for j !=k. \n\nWhich is exactly the number of ordered pairs of strings with same first character and different second characters. \n\nBecause for each such pair (s, t), if s has (i,j) and t has (i,k), then they are counted once as (s,t) and once as (t,s). \n\nThus, the total ordered pairs is exactly the code's value. \n\nThe problem requires unordered pairs (i < j), so the correct answer is (code's value) / 2 for each case. \n\nTherefore, the code's current approach is adding the two cases (each of which is twice the correct count) and thus the total is (2*(first + second)), which is double the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the code is wrong. \n\nSo, to fix this, the code should divide the final ans by 2. \n\nWait, but in the code's main function, the ans is set to calculatePairs(...) + calculatePairs(...). \n\nSo the correct ans should be (calculatePairs(...) + calculatePairs(...)) / 2. \n\nTherefore, the code is missing a division by 2. \n\nHmm, that's a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is different. Let me think of the problem again. \n\nThe problem requires pairs of strings differing in exactly one position. \n\nEach such pair can be in one of two cases: \n\nCase 1: first characters differ, second are same. \n\nCase 2: second characters differ, first are same. \n\nThe total is the sum of these two cases. \n\nThe code's first calculatePairs is for case 2 (same first, different second). \n\nThe second calculatePairs is for case 1 (same second, different first). \n\nEach of these calculatePairs returns twice the count of their respective cases (because they count ordered pairs). \n\nThus, the total is (case1_count + case2_count) = (calculatePairs1 + calculatePairs2)/2. \n\nTherefore, the code's current ans is twice the correct answer. \n\nHence, the code needs to divide the ans by 2. \n\nSo in the main function, after calculating ans = ... , it should be ans /= 2. \n\nWait, but looking at the code's current line:\n\nlong ans = calculatePairs(startsWithCounter, startToEnd) + calculatePairs(endsWithCounter, endToStart);\n\nSo the code is adding the two terms, each of which is twice the desired count. \n\nThus, the correct ans is (sum) / 2. \n\nTherefore, the code is missing a division by 2. \n\nSo that's a bug. \n\nBut the problem says that the answer may not fit into 32-bit, so using long is okay. \n\nTherefore, the code should have ans = (calculatePairs(...) + calculatePairs(...)) / 2. \n\nHmm, so that's one thing to fix. \n\nNow, the other part is the missing code in the while loop. \n\nThe code inside the loop where n is decremented (processing each string) must read the string, and update the counters. \n\nThe current code has a while loop that reads n strings. \n\nInside the loop, the code is missing. \n\nThe code needs to read each string, then for each string, get its first and second characters, convert to indices (0-10), then update the counters. \n\nSo the code should be something like:\n\nString s = sc.next();\n\nint first = s.charAt(0) - 'a';\n\nint second = s.charAt(1) - 'a';\n\nThen, increment the counters:\n\nstartsWithCounter[first]++;\n\nendsWithCounter[second]++;\n\nstartToEnd[first][second]++;\n\nendToStart[second][first]++;\n\nYes. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nString s = sc.next();\n\nint first = s.charAt(0) - 'a';\n\nint second = s.charAt(1) - 'a';\n\nstartsWithCounter[first]++;\n\nendsWithCounter[second]++;\n\nstartToEnd[first][second]++;\n\nendToStart[second][first]++;\n\nThat's the code to add inside the while loop. \n\nAdditionally, the code's main function's ans calculation is wrong by a factor of 2. \n\nSo the code should have ans divided by 2. \n\nBut the problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nWait, the user's instruction says: \n\n\"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly. Output the missing code as plain text, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or any additional information.\"\n\nThe problem is to complete the code in the TODO section. \n\nThe code's main issue is the missing code in the while loop. \n\nThe division by 2 is a separate issue, but perhaps the code is correct as written, and I'm missing something. \n\nWait, perhaps the code's calculatePairs function is correct. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem requires pairs (i,j) with i < j. \n\nThe code's calculatePairs function returns the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where a and b have the same first character and different second. \n\nThe number of unordered pairs is exactly (calculatePairs(...) ) / 2. \n\nSimilarly for the other case. \n\nThus, the total is ( (case1 + case2) ) / 2. \n\nBut the code's current ans is case1 + case2, so it's double the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the code is wrong. \n\nBut the user's problem says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the while loop. \n\nThe division by 2 is a separate error, but perhaps the code is intended to be correct, and I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct. \n\nWait, let's think of the first example given in the problem's note. \n\nFirst test case:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n5\n\nab\n\ncb\n\ndb\n\naa\n\ncc\n\nThe pairs that qualify are (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"cc\"). \n\nWait, the note says 5 pairs. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first case (same first, different second):\n\nLooking for pairs with same first character. \n\nFor example, \"ab\" and \"aa\" have first 'a' and 'a'? No, \"ab\" has first 'a', \"aa\" also first 'a'. \n\nWait, \"ab\" and \"aa\" have first same (a), second different (b vs a). So that's a valid pair. \n\nThe pair \"ab\" and \"cb\" have first 'a' vs 'c', so different first. \n\nWait, the first case (same first, different second) would include pairs like \"ab\" and \"aa\" (same first a, different second). \n\nThe second case (same second, different first) would include pairs like \"ab\" and \"cb\" (same second 'b', different first). \n\nSo the total pairs are 5. \n\nLet's see what the code would compute. \n\nFirst, let's process each string:\n\nThe strings are:\n\nab \u2192 first 0 (a), second 1 (b)\n\ncb \u2192 first 2 (c), second 1 (b)\n\ndb \u2192 first 3 (d), second 1 (b)\n\naa \u2192 first 0 (a), second 0 (a)\n\ncc \u2192 first 2 (c), second 2 (c)\n\nSo startsWithCounter:\n\n0: 2 (ab and aa)\n\n1: 0 \n\n2: 2 (cb and cc)\n\n3:1 (db)\n\n4-10:0 \n\nstartToEnd array:\n\nFor first 0:\n\nstartToEnd[0][1] =1 (ab)\n\nstartToEnd[0][0] =1 (aa)\n\nSo startToEnd[0][0] =1, startToEnd[0][1] =1. \n\nFor first 2:\n\nstartToEnd[2][1] =1 (cb)\n\nstartToEnd[2][2] =1 (cc)\n\nFor first 3:\n\nstartToEnd[3][1] =1 (db)\n\nThe startsWithCounter for first 0 is 2, first 2 is 2, etc. \n\nThe first calculatePairs (for same first, different second):\n\nFor first 0:\n\nn_i = 2. \n\nsum_j (arr[0][j]^2) = 1^2 + 1^2 + ... (other j's are 0 except 0 and 1). \n\nSo sum is 1 +1 =2. \n\nThus, term for first 0 is 2^2 - 2 =4-2=2. \n\nFor first 2:\n\nn_i is 2. \n\narr[2][1] is 1, arr[2][2] is 1. \n\nsum of squares is 1+1=2. \n\nso term is 4-2=2. \n\nFor first 3: n_i is 1 \u2192 term is 1^2 -1^2 =0. \n\nOther firsts contribute 0. \n\nTotal for first calculatePairs is 2+2+0 =4. \n\nThe second calculatePairs (same second, different first):\n\nendsWithCounter counts the second characters. \n\nThe second characters are:\n\nab \u21921 (b)\n\ncb \u21921 (b)\n\ndb \u21921 (b)\n\naa \u21920 (a)\n\ncc \u21922 (c)\n\nSo endsWithCounter[0] =1 (aa's second is a?), wait no: \n\nWait, the second character of \"aa\" is 'a', so second index 0. \n\nThe second characters:\n\nab \u2192 b (1)\n\ncb \u2192 b (1)\n\ndb \u2192 b (1)\n\naa \u2192 a (0)\n\ncc \u2192 c (2)\n\nSo endsWithCounter[0] =1 (aa's second is a), endsWithCounter[1] =3 (ab, cb, db), endsWithCounter[2] =1 (cc). \n\nThe endToStart array is for (second, first). \n\nFor second 0 (a):\n\nendToStart[0][0] =1 (from aa's first is a (0), second is 0. \n\nFor second 1 (b):\n\nendToStart[1][0] =1 (ab's first is 0, second is 1)\n\nendToStart[1][2] =1 (cb's first is 2, second is 1)\n\nendToStart[1][3] =1 (db's first is 3, second is 1)\n\nSo for second 1, the endToStart[1][0], [1][2], [1][3] are 1 each. \n\nFor second 2 (c):\n\nendToStart[2][2] =1 (cc's first is 2, second is 2). \n\nSo for the second calculatePairs (endsWithCounter and endToStart):\n\nFor each second character (j):\n\nTake endsWithCounter[j] (the count of strings with that second character), and the endToStart[j][*] array. \n\nFor j=0 (second is a):\n\nendsWithCounter[0] is 1. \n\nendToStart[0][0] is 1 (the only entry). \n\nsum of squares is 1^2 =1. \n\nso term is 1^2 -1 =0. \n\nFor j=1 (second is b):\n\nendsWithCounter[1] is 3. \n\nThe endToStart[1][*] has entries for first 0,2,3. \n\nEach of those has count 1. \n\nsum of squares is 1+1+1 =3. \n\nso term is 3^2 -3 =9-3=6. \n\nFor j=2 (second is c):\n\nendsWithCounter[2] is 1. \n\nsum of squares is 1. \n\nterm is 1-1=0. \n\nOther j's contribute 0. \n\nTotal for second calculatePairs is 0+6+0 =6. \n\nThus, the code's ans is 4+6 =10. \n\nThe correct answer is 5. \n\n10 is twice the correct answer. \n\nSo the code's current approach is indeed wrong. \n\nTherefore, the code must be fixed by dividing the ans by 2. \n\nBut the user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the while loop. \n\nThe other error (division by 2) is also needed, but perhaps the problem's code is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait, the problem's first example's answer is 5. \n\nThe code's current approach would output 10, which is wrong. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nBut the user's question is to complete the code by filling in the missing part (the while loop). \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the loop where each string is processed. \n\nThe other error (division by 2) is also needed, but perhaps the user's code has that error and the question is to fill in the missing code only. \n\nThe user's instruction says: \"Output only the missing code so that the program will run correctly.\" \n\nSo perhaps the code's other parts are correct, and the missing code is just the part inside the loop. \n\nIn that case, the missing code is the part that reads the string and updates the counters. \n\nSo the code inside the while loop (n-- >0) should be:\n\nString s = sc.next();\n\nint first = s.charAt(0) - 'a';\n\nint second = s.charAt(1) - 'a';\n\nstartsWithCounter[first]++;\n\nendsWithCounter[second]++;\n\nstartToEnd[first][second]++;\n\nendToStart[second][first]++;\n\nThat's the missing code. \n\nThe other error (division by 2) is a separate issue, but perhaps the problem expects this code to be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code's approach is correct and I made a mistake in the analysis. \n\nWait, perhaps the calculatePairs function is not for the two cases I thought. \n\nMaybe the first calculatePairs is for the case where the first characters are different and the second are the same. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nThe first calculatePairs uses startsWithCounter (count of first characters) and startToEnd (which is first to second). \n\nThe function's logic is that for each first character i, the total pairs with first i is startsWithCounter[i], and the pairs with first i and second j are startToEnd[i][j]. \n\nThe function's calculation is sum_i (n_i^2 - sum_j (arr[i][j]^2)), which counts the number of ordered pairs with same first and different second. \n\nThe second calculatePairs uses endsWithCounter (count of second characters) and endToStart (second to first). \n\nThis would count the number of ordered pairs with same second and different first. \n\nThus, the total is the sum of these two, which is the total number of ordered pairs that differ in exactly one position. \n\nThe problem requires the number of unordered pairs (i < j). \n\nThe number of unordered pairs is exactly (total ordered pairs) / 2. \n\nThus, the code's current ans is twice the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the code must divide by 2. \n\nBut the user's question is to fill in the missing code. \n\nThe missing code is the part inside the loop. \n\nThe other error is a separate issue. \n\nPerhaps the problem's code is correct and I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's code is correct and the division is not needed. \n\nWait, let's see the first example's code's output. \n\nThe code's ans is 10, but the correct answer is 5. \n\nSo the code is wrong. \n\nBut the user's question is to complete the code. \n\nThe user's code may have other errors, but the missing code is the part inside the loop. \n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is the four lines I mentioned. \n\nThe other error (division by 2) is also needed, but perhaps the user's code has that error and the question is to fill in the missing part. \n\nThe user's instruction says to output only the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the code inside the loop. \n\nSo the missing code is:\n\nString s = sc.next();\n\nint first = s.charAt(0) - 'a';\n\nint second = s.charAt(1) - 'a';\n\nstartsWithCounter[first]++;\n\nendsWithCounter[second]++;\n\nstartToEnd[first][second]++;\n\nendToStart[second][first]++;\n\nYes. \n\nSo that's the code to be added inside the while loop. \n\nThe other error (division by 2) is a separate issue, but the user's question is to fill in the missing code. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is those four lines."
