        "text": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine which division a Codeforces user is in based on their rating. Let's see the problem again. The divisions are divided as follows: Division 1: rating >= 1900\nDivision 2: 1600 to 1899\nDivision 3: 1400 to 1599\nDivision 4: less than 1400 So for each test case, I need to read the rating and output the correct division. The input is t test cases, each with a rating. The output should be \"Division X\" where X is 1-4. The code provided has a main method that reads the number of test cases, then loops through each. The TODO is inside the loop, so I need to write the code inside the for loop for each test case. Hmm, so first, inside the loop, I need to read the rating. So, something like int rating = int. Parse(Console.ReadLine()); \n\nThen, determine which division it's in. Maybe using if-else statements. Let's think about the conditions. Start with the highest division first. If the rating is >=1900, it's division 1. Else if >=1600, division 2. Else if >=1400, division3. Else division4. Wait, the order is important here. Let me structure the conditions properly. Like:\n\nif (rating >= 1900) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Division 1\");\n} else if (rating >= 1600) {\n    Console. WriteLine(\"Division 2\");\n} else if (rating >= 1400) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Division 3\");\n} else {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Division 4\");\n}\n\nYes, that should work. Because once it's not in division 1, we check the next condition. For example, if it's 1700, the first condition fails, then the else if checks if it's >=1600, which is true, so division 2. What about the edge cases? Like 1399: that's division4. 1400 is division3.",
