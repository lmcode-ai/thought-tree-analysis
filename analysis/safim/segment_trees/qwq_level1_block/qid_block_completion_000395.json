Wait, perhaps the following approach works: Initialize a variable 'current' to 0. We process the array from left to right. For each element a[i], the current value must be adjusted such that: \n\ncurrent += a[i] But I'm not sure. Alternatively, here's an approach that might work: \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 0. Every time you move right, you increase the current cell and move forward. Every time you move left, you decrease the current cell and move backward. The final position must be 0.",

However, every time we move right from 0, we go to 1. To return to 0, we must have some left moves from 1 back to 0. Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Perhaps there's a simpler way.

Another example: [1,1,-2]. Partial sums are 1, 2, 0. Which is okay. The path can be formed as I thought earlier. Another test case: [0,0,0]. Sum is zero. Partial sums are 0,0,0. Yes. Another test case: n=1. The array must be [0]. Sum is zero. Partial sum is 0. Yes. If the array is [5], sum is 5 \u2192 no. So this seems to work. Thus, the code should implement these two conditions. Now, let's look at the given code skeleton. The code has a loop over test cases. For each test case: \n\nRead n, then read the array. The code currently has a loop over the array elements, with 'last' and 'flag' variables. The code's current code is: \n\nlast=0; flag=true;\n\nfor(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nif(last!=0) flag=false;\n\ncout<<((flag)?\"Yes\":\"No\")<<endl;\n\nHmm, so the code needs to compute the sum and the partial sums. Wait, but the code is supposed to read the array elements and process them in a loop. The variables 'last' and 'flag' are used. The final check is whether last is zero. Wait, perhaps the code can be modified to track the partial sum and the total sum. Wait, let me think of how to implement the conditions. The sum can be tracked as we go. The partial sum can also be tracked. Let me see: \n\nInitialize sum_so_far =0, total_sum=0. For each element a[i]: \n\nsum_so_far += a[i]; \n\ntotal_sum += a[i]; \n\nif sum_so_far <0 \u2192 flag = false. At the end, check if total_sum is zero and flag is still true. Wait, but the code's existing variables are 'last' and 'flag'. The code's current code has 'last' initialized to 0. Perhaps 'last' is supposed to track the partial sum. Wait, let me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can track the partial sum as 'last'. Initialize last =0.

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given array can be obtained through certain operations with a pointer. Let me think through the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that the array starts all zeros, and the pointer is at the first element. The operations allowed are two types:\n\n1. If not on the last element, increase current by 1, then move to next.\n2. If not on the first, decrease current by 1, then move to previous.\n\nAnd after all operations, the pointer must be back at the first element.\n\nHmm. So the key is to model how these operations affect the array and the pointer's position. The final array must satisfy some conditions based on these operations.\n\nLet me think of the process. Each operation moves the pointer either forward or backward, but each step changes the current element. The pointer must end at the first position. \n\nWait, the operations can be done in any order, but each step is either moving forward (with increment) or backward (with decrement). The pointer's path must form some kind of path that starts and ends at the first element. \n\nI need to find a way to model the array's values based on the number of times the pointer moves forward or backward through each position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the array that must hold for it to be possible. Let me think of the example given in the note. \n\nIn the second test case example, the array ends up as [2, -1, -1, 0]. How did that happen? Let me see the steps they showed. \n\nThe steps go like this:\n\nStart at first element. They do the first operation (move right, incrementing) a couple times, then maybe some back and forth. \n\nBut perhaps the key is to model the required conditions. Let me think of the array's elements in terms of the number of times the pointer moved through them in each direction.\n\nLet me think of the pointer's movement as a path. Each time you go forward (operation 1), you increase the current cell and move right. Each time you go backward (operation 2), you decrease the current cell and move left. \n\nThe total effect on each cell depends on how many times the pointer passed through it in each direction. \n\nWait, maybe each cell's value is determined by the difference between the number of times the pointer moved forward over it and the number of times it moved backward over it. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the array's values. Let me think of the process as the pointer moving around, and each time it moves right, it adds 1 to the current cell before moving. When moving left, subtracts 1 from current before moving. \n\nWait, the operations are: \n\nFor operation 1: increase current by 1, then move to next. \n\nSo when moving right, the current cell is increased, then the pointer moves. \n\nFor operation 2: decrease current by 1, then move to previous. \n\nSo moving left, subtract 1, then move. \n\nThe total for each cell a[i] would be the number of times the pointer was on that cell when moving right (so adding 1 each time) minus the number of times it was on that cell when moving left (subtracting 1 each time). \n\nHmm, but how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy certain constraints. Let me think of the process as a path that starts at position 0 and ends at 0. \n\nLet me consider the net effect on each position. Let me think of the path as a sequence of steps. Each step is either +1 (right) or -1 (left), but with constraints (can't go beyond the array). \n\nWait, but each step's direction affects the current cell. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array's differences can be considered. Let me think of the array as a1, a2, ..., an. \n\nSuppose we model the required conditions. Let me think of the process in terms of the pointer's path. \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0. Each time it moves right (operation 1), it adds 1 to the current cell and moves. Each time it moves left (operation 2), subtracts 1 and moves. \n\nThe final array is the sum of all these operations. \n\nThe key is that the pointer must end at position 0. \n\nHmm, perhaps the way to model this is to track the number of times the pointer has passed through each cell in each direction. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the array's values in terms of the path. Let me consider the path as a sequence of moves. \n\nLet me think of the total number of times the pointer moves right and left. \n\nWait, perhaps the array's elements can be determined by the difference between the number of right moves and left moves through each position. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the array as the difference between the number of times the pointer entered from the left (right moves) and the number of times it entered from the right (left moves). \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: Let's model the required conditions by traversing the array and keeping track of some variable. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. Let me think of the required steps. \n\nLet me think of the pointer's movement. Since the pointer must end at the first position, the total number of steps to the right must equal the number of steps to the left, but in a way that the path returns to the start. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the sum of certain terms is zero. \n\nWait, let me think of the following approach. \n\nSuppose we model the required conditions as follows: \n\nLet me consider the array a. Let me think of the process as the pointer moving around, and each time it moves right, it adds 1 to the current cell, and moving left subtracts 1. \n\nThe total for each cell a[i] is equal to (number of times the pointer was on cell i when moving right) minus (number of times it was on cell i when moving left). \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the differences between consecutive elements follow certain constraints. \n\nWait, let me think of the path of the pointer. Let me imagine that the pointer's path can be represented as a series of moves. Each time it moves right, it contributes +1 to the current cell. Each time it moves left, it contributes -1 to the current cell. \n\nThe total for each cell is the sum of all these contributions. \n\nNow, the path starts at 0 and ends at 0. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of positions. Let me denote the path as a sequence of positions p_0, p_1, ..., p_m, where p_0 = 0 and p_m = 0. \n\nEach step from p_i to p_{i+1} is either +1 (right) or -1 (left), but can't go beyond 0 or n-1 (assuming 0-based). \n\nEach step to the right (from position k to k+1) contributes +1 to a[k]. \n\nEach step to the left (from position k to k-1) contributes -1 to a[k]. \n\nSo the total a[k] is equal to (number of right steps starting at k) minus (number of left steps starting at k). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the total a[k] is equal to (number of times the pointer was at k when moving right) minus (number of times it was at k when moving left). \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the array must satisfy that the sum of a_i for all i must be equal to the number of times the pointer has moved right minus the number of left moves. But since each right move is a step and each left is also a step, but the total displacement must be zero (since starts and ends at 0). \n\nWait, the total displacement is zero. The number of right steps must equal the number of left steps. \n\nWait, the total displacement is (number of right steps) - (number of left steps) = 0. So the total right steps equals left steps. \n\nBut the sum of all a_i's would be equal to (sum over all right steps' contributions) minus (sum over left steps' contributions). \n\nEach right step contributes +1 to the current cell. Each left step contributes -1 to the current cell. \n\nSo the total sum of a_i is (number of right steps) - (number of left steps). But since right steps = left steps, the total sum must be zero. \n\nAh! So one necessary condition is that the sum of all elements in the array must be zero. \n\nWait, that's a key point. Let me check the example given. \n\nIn the second test case example, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. The sum is 2-1-1+0 = 0. So that's okay. \n\nThe first test case note says that the array can be obtained but the pointer isn't on first element. So perhaps the sum is zero but other conditions are not met. \n\nSo sum being zero is necessary but not sufficient. \n\nSo first, check if the sum is zero. If not, output No. \n\nBut there must be more conditions. \n\nHmm. Let's think of another example. Suppose n=1. Then the array must be [0], because any operation would require moving to next or previous, which is impossible. So for n=1, the only possible array is all zeros. \n\nWait, for n=1, the pointer is on the first (and only) element. The operations can't be done because moving next would go beyond the array, and moving previous is also impossible. So the only possible array is [0]. \n\nSo for n=1, if the input array is [0], then yes, else no. \n\nAnother example: n=2. Suppose the array is [1, -1]. \n\nSum is 0. Let's see if possible. \n\nPossible steps: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nDo operation 1: increase a[0] to 1, move to 1. \n\nNow, to get back to 0, we need to do operation 2. \n\nAt position 1, do operation 2: decrease a[1] by 1 (so becomes -1), move to 0. \n\nNow the array is [1, -1], and the pointer is back at 0. So yes. \n\nSo that works. \n\nAnother test case: array [3, -1, -1]. Let's see sum is 1, so no. \n\nAnother case: array [1, 1, -2]. Sum is 0. \n\nHmm, can this be achieved? \n\nLet me see. \n\nSuppose steps: \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right (operation1) three times: \n\nFirst step: a[0] becomes 1, move to 1. \n\nSecond step: a[1] becomes 1, move to 2. \n\nThird step: a[2] becomes 1, move to 3 (but n=3, so can't do that. Wait n=3, indices 0,1,2. So third step would be moving to 3 which is beyond. So can't do that. \n\nWait, maybe another approach. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the path. \n\nSuppose the path is 0 \u21921 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920. \n\nLet me track the a values. \n\nEach right step adds to the current cell before moving. \n\nLet me track each step:\n\nStart at 0. \n\nStep 1: move right (operation1). \n\na[0] +=1 \u2192 becomes 1. move to 1. \n\nStep 2: move right again. a[1] +=1 \u21921. move to 2. \n\nStep3: move left (operation2). a[2] -=1 \u21920. move to 1. \n\nStep4: move left again. a[1] -=1 \u21920. move to 0. \n\nNow the array is [1,0,0]. Not the desired [1,1,-2]. \n\nHmm, maybe another path. \n\nAlternatively, let's see the desired array [1,1,-2]. \n\nThe sum is 0. \n\nBut how to get there. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's not possible. Let me see. \n\nWait, the third element is -2. To get that, the pointer must have been on position 2, and done two left steps (each subtracting 1). \n\nBut to get to position 2, you have to move right twice. \n\nSo let's see: \n\nSuppose path: \n\n0 \u21921 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920 \u21921 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920. \n\nWait, let's track step by step. \n\nStep 1: right to 1: a[0] becomes 1. \n\nStep2: right to 2: a[1] becomes 1. \n\nStep3: left to 1: a[2] becomes -1. \n\nStep4: left to 0: a[1] becomes 0. \n\nStep5: right to 1: a[0] becomes 2 (since moving right from 0 adds 1 to a[0], then move to 1. \n\nWait, step5: moving right from 0 (current a[0] is 1 (from step1?), no, let me track again. \n\nWait this is getting complicated. Maybe I need a better approach. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem with some variables. \n\nLet me think of the array as a1, a2, ..., an. \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0. \n\nEach time you move right (operation1), you add 1 to current cell and move right. \n\nEach time you move left (operation2), subtract 1 from current cell and move left. \n\nThe final position must be 0. \n\nLet me think of the process as a series of moves. Let me model the required conditions. \n\nLet me consider the path of the pointer. Let me think of the path as a sequence of positions. \n\nThe total displacement is zero. \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times the pointer entered from the left (i.e., moving right into i from i-1) minus the number of times it entered from the right (moving left into i from i+1) must equal a[i]. \n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again. \n\nEach time the pointer is at position i and moves right, it adds 1 to a[i], then moves to i+1. \n\nEach time it is at i and moves left, it subtracts 1 from a[i], then moves to i-1. \n\nSo the total a[i] is equal to (number of times the pointer was at i and moved right) minus (number of times it was at i and moved left). \n\nBut the number of times the pointer was at i and moved right is equal to the number of times it entered i from the left (i-1) and then moved right again? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the total a[i] can be expressed as (number of right moves starting at i) minus (number of left moves starting at i). \n\nLet me denote R[i] as the number of times the pointer moved right from i, and L[i] as the number of times it moved left from i. \n\nThen a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. \n\nAlso, the movement must form a path that starts and ends at 0. \n\nNow, the path's movement can be considered as a sequence of steps. \n\nThe total number of right steps must equal the number of left steps. \n\nBut how to model the constraints between R and L. \n\nLet me think of the path's transitions. \n\nFor each position i (except 0 and n-1), the number of times the pointer entered i from the left (i-1) plus the number of times it entered from the right (i+1) must equal the number of times it left i (either right or left). \n\nWait, perhaps for each position i (except 0 and n-1), the number of times you enter i from the left (R[i-1] steps) plus the number of times you enter from the right (L[i+1] steps) must equal the number of times you leave i (R[i] + L[i]). \n\nHmm, this might be getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem by considering the cumulative steps. \n\nLet me think of the path as a walk starting at 0 and ending at 0. \n\nLet me consider the difference between the number of right and left moves at each position. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by some similar problems: \n\nLet me consider the array's differences. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the number of times the pointer has moved to the right minus the left moves up to that point. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to track the required movement. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach: \n\nThe pointer starts at position 0. \n\nEach time you move right, you increase the current cell and move forward. \n\nEach time you move left, you decrease the current cell and move backward. \n\nThe final position must be 0. \n\nLet me think of the array as the result of all these operations. \n\nSuppose we model the process as follows: \n\nLet me consider the path of the pointer. The path must start and end at 0. \n\nLet me think of the array's elements in terms of the path. \n\nLet me think of the required conditions. \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet me denote the current position as pos. \n\nWe can model the process by tracking the number of times we have moved right and left. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's constraints: \n\nLet me consider the array's elements and see if they can be represented in a way that the path can return to 0. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can model the problem by traversing the array and keeping track of a variable that represents the \"balance\" of moves needed. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nInitialize a variable 'balance' to 0. \n\nWe process the array from left to right. \n\nFor each element a[i], the required condition is that the balance plus a[i] must be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by some similar problems (like the \"balance\" in parentheses problems): \n\nLet me think of the process as moving along the array. \n\nSuppose we start at position 0. \n\nEvery time we move to the right (operation1), we are effectively \"adding\" to the current cell and moving forward. \n\nTo return to the start, the path must form a closed loop. \n\nLet me think of the required conditions for each position. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the number of steps needed to return to the start. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: \n\nLet me consider the array's elements and see that for the pointer to return to 0, the following must hold: \n\nThe array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, the cumulative sum up to i must be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think of the example given. \n\nIn the second test case example, the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nProcessing from left to right: \n\nThe first element is 2. \n\nThe second is -1, so cumulative sum after first two elements is 1. \n\nThird is -1, cumulative sum 0. \n\nFourth is 0, total sum 0. \n\nHmm, but how does that help? \n\nAlternatively, here's another approach: \n\nLet me think of the required path. \n\nThe pointer must end at 0, so the total number of right moves equals left moves. \n\nMoreover, the array's elements must satisfy that for each position i, the number of times the pointer passed through it to the right minus the left must equal a[i]. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: \n\nLet me model the problem by considering the required path. \n\nSuppose we track the number of times the pointer has been at each position. \n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the problem's movement: \n\nLet me consider the array's elements and see that the differences between consecutive elements must satisfy certain conditions. \n\nLet me think of the array as a1, a2, ..., an. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the number of steps needed to return to the start. \n\nWait, perhaps the key is to track the required movement. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 0. \n\nEach time you move right, you add 1 to the current cell and move forward. \n\nEach time you move left, subtract 1 and move back. \n\nThe final position is 0. \n\nLet me think of the array's elements as the difference between the number of times the pointer was on that cell moving right and moving left. \n\nLet me denote for each cell i, the net contribution is a[i] = R[i] - L[i], where R[i] is the number of right moves from i, and L[i] is the number of left moves from i. \n\nNow, the path must start and end at 0. \n\nThe total displacement is zero, so the total right steps (sum R[i] for all i) must equal the total left steps (sum L[i] for all i). \n\nBut how to model the path's constraints. \n\nAnother idea: \n\nThe path must form a closed walk starting and ending at 0. \n\nThe net movement is zero. \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times you enter i from the left (i-1) plus the number of times you enter from the right (i+1) must equal the number of times you leave i (either right or left). \n\nBut this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach inspired by the problem's movement: \n\nLet me process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable that represents the current \"balance\" of moves. \n\nLet me define a variable 'balance' which starts at 0. \n\nFor each element a[i], the balance must be adjusted in a way that allows the pointer to move forward or backward. \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nLet me think of the required path as a series of moves. \n\nSuppose we process the array from left to right. \n\nAt each step, the current position is i. \n\nThe balance variable represents the number of steps needed to return to the start. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nInitialize balance to 0. \n\nWe start at position 0. \n\nThe first element a[0] must be equal to the number of times we moved right from 0 minus the number of times we moved left from 0. \n\nBut since we start at 0, any left move from 0 is impossible (since it would go to -1). \n\nWait, the first element can only be increased by moving right from it, but once you move right, you can't come back to it except via left moves. \n\nHmm, perhaps the following approach: \n\nLet me consider the array and track the required balance. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nWe can model the problem by keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the current position of the pointer. \n\nBut since we can't track the entire path, perhaps we can find an invariant. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the problem's movement and the required conditions: \n\nLet me consider the following: \n\nThe pointer must end at position 0. \n\nThe total sum of a[i] must be zero (as each right contributes +1, each left -1, and total steps R = L, so sum a[i] = R - L = 0). \n\nAdditionally, for the array to be achievable, the following must hold: \n\nWhen traversing the array from left to right, the cumulative sum of (a[i] - a[i-1]) must not drop below zero. \n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think of the example given. \n\nIn the second test case example: \n\nThe array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe differences between consecutive elements are: \n\n-1 (from 2 to -1), then -2 (from -1 to -1? Wait no, between second and third is 0, so -1 to -1 is 0. Then third to fourth is +1. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea from similar problems: \n\nThe problem resembles the problem of determining if a certain sequence can be formed by a series of moves with constraints on the path. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nLet me think of the array as the difference between the number of times the pointer passed through each cell in each direction. \n\nThe key is that the path must form a closed loop starting and ending at 0. \n\nLet me model the required conditions as follows: \n\nLet me define for each position i, the net contribution a[i] must be such that the path can return to 0. \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the current position's required balance. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the problem's movement: \n\nLet me consider the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the number of steps needed to return to the start. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nInitialize a variable 'current' to 0. \n\nWe process the array from left to right. \n\nFor each element a[i], the current value must be adjusted such that: \n\ncurrent += a[i] \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's an approach that might work: \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 0. \n\nEvery time you move right, you increase the current cell and move forward. \n\nEvery time you move left, you decrease the current cell and move backward. \n\nThe final position must be 0. \n\nLet me think of the array's elements as the difference between the number of times the pointer was on that cell moving right and moving left. \n\nLet me denote for each cell i, R[i] is the number of right moves from i, L[i] is the number of left moves from i. \n\nThen a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. \n\nThe total right moves must equal the total left moves (since the path starts and ends at 0). \n\nNow, the path must form a closed walk. \n\nThe key is to find conditions on the a[i] such that these R and L can exist. \n\nLet me think of the path as a sequence of moves. \n\nThe path starts at 0. \n\nEach move is either R or L (except when at the ends). \n\nThe path must end at 0. \n\nNow, for each position i, the number of times you enter i must equal the number of times you leave i, except for the start/end. \n\nWait, since it's a closed path, every position except the start/end must have equal in and out. But since it starts and ends at 0, the start/end (0) must have one more exit than entry? Or no, because it starts there. \n\nHmm, perhaps the in-degree and out-degree for each node must be equal except for the start and end. But since it's a closed path, the start and end are the same, so all nodes must have equal in and out degrees. \n\nWait, in a closed path (a cycle), every node has equal in-degree and out-degree. \n\nSo for each position i, the number of times you enter i must equal the number of times you leave i. \n\nThe number of times you enter i is equal to the number of times you came from the left (i-1) via a right move from i-1, plus the number of times you came from the right (i+1) via a left move from i+1. \n\nThe number of times you leave i is equal to R[i] (right moves from i) plus L[i] (left moves from i). \n\nSo for each i: \n\nR[i-1] (right moves from i-1 leading to i) + L[i+1] (left moves from i+1 leading to i) = R[i] + L[i]. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to model this. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nFor each position i, the net contribution a[i] = R[i] - L[i]. \n\nAlso, the equation from above: \n\nR[i-1] + L[i+1] = R[i] + L[i]. \n\nBut substituting L[i] = R[i] - a[i], \n\nR[i-1] + L[i+1] = R[i] + (R[i] - a[i]) \n\n=> R[i-1] + L[i+1] = 2 R[i] - a[i]. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a recurrence relation. \n\nLet me try to express R[i] in terms of previous variables. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the following approach inspired by the problem's movement: \n\nLet me process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable that represents the current \"balance\" of moves. \n\nLet me define a variable 'current' which represents the number of steps needed to return to the start. \n\nWait, here's an idea: \n\nLet me think of the following variables: \n\nLet me define a variable 'balance' which starts at 0. \n\nWe process the array from left to right. \n\nFor each position i from 0 to n-1: \n\nThe balance must be such that the current a[i] can be achieved. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nInitialize balance to 0. \n\nWe start at position 0. \n\nThe first element a[0] must be equal to the number of times we moved right from 0 minus the number of times we moved left from 0. \n\nBut since we can't move left from 0 (as it's the first element), the left moves from 0 must be zero. So a[0] must be equal to R[0]. \n\nBut R[0] is the number of times we moved right from 0. \n\nHowever, every time we move right from 0, we go to 1. \n\nTo return to 0, we must have some left moves from 1 back to 0. \n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled. \n\nPerhaps there's a simpler way. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nThe pointer starts at 0. \n\nEvery time you move right, you increase the current cell and move forward. \n\nEvery time you move left, you decrease the current cell and move backward. \n\nThe final position is 0. \n\nLet me think of the array's elements as the difference between the number of times the pointer passed through each cell moving right and left. \n\nThe key is that the path must form a closed loop. \n\nLet me think of the following invariant: \n\nThe difference between the number of right and left moves up to any point must be non-negative. \n\nWait, perhaps the following approach works: \n\nLet me process the array from left to right, keeping track of a variable 'current' which represents the current position's required balance. \n\nInitialize current to 0. \n\nFor each element a[i], the current value must be adjusted such that: \n\ncurrent = current + a[i] \n\nBut also, the current must not drop below zero. \n\nWait, let me think of the example given. \n\nSecond test case example: [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nProcessing from left to right: \n\nStart with current =0. \n\nFirst element a[0] =2. \n\ncurrent += a[0] \u2192 2. \n\nBut then next element a[1] =-1. \n\ncurrent += (-1) \u2192 1. \n\nThen a[2] =-1 \u2192 current 0. \n\nThen a[3] =0 \u2192 current 0. \n\nHmm, but this doesn't seem to capture anything. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach: \n\nThe required condition is that the array must satisfy that for all i from 1 to n-1, the cumulative sum of a[0] to a[i] must be non-negative. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nIn the second test case example: \n\nThe cumulative sums are: \n\n2 (after first element), 1 (after second), 0 (third), 0 (fourth). \n\nAll are non-negative. \n\nAnother example where it's possible: [1, -1]. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 0. \n\nWhich is okay. \n\nAnother example where it's not possible: [3, -1, -1]. \n\nSum is 1, so total sum is 1, so already invalid. \n\nAnother example: [1,1,-2]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 2, 0. \n\nAll non-negative. \n\nBut can this array be achieved? \n\nHmm, let's see. \n\nSuppose the array is [1,1,-2]. \n\nThe sum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums are all non-negative. \n\nBut can this be achieved? \n\nLet me try to find a path. \n\nStart at 0. \n\nMove right to 1 (a[0] becomes 1). \n\nMove right to 2 (a[1] becomes 1). \n\nNow, to get a[2] to -2, we need to subtract 2 from it. \n\nSo we have to move left twice from position 2. \n\nFirst, move left to 1 (subtract 1 from a[2], now a[2] is 0). \n\nThen move left again to 0 (subtract 1 from a[1], now a[1] is 0, and move to 0. \n\nBut then the array would be [1,0,0]. \n\nHmm, not the desired. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps another path: \n\n0 \u21921 \u21922 \u21921 \u21922 \u21921 \u21920. \n\nLet me track the steps: \n\nStep 1: right to 1 \u2192 a[0] =1. \n\nStep2: right to 2 \u2192 a[1] =1. \n\nStep3: left to 1 \u2192 a[2] =-1. \n\nStep4: right to 2 \u2192 a[1] becomes 2. \n\nStep5: left to 1 \u2192 a[2] becomes -2. \n\nStep6: left to 0 \u2192 a[1] becomes 1. \n\nNow the array is [1,1, -2]. \n\nThe final position is 0. \n\nYes! So this works. \n\nSo the array [1,1,-2] is possible. \n\nSo the cumulative sum approach would allow this. \n\nHmm, so the cumulative sum approach seems to work. \n\nWait, let me see the cumulative sums for this array: \n\nAfter first element: 1. \n\nAfter second: 2. \n\nAfter third: 0. \n\nAll non-negative. \n\nSo the conditions are met. \n\nAnother test case: array [2, -3, 1]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nCumulative sums: 2, -1 (which is negative), so this would fail. \n\nThus, the conditions would reject it. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n1. The total sum of the array must be zero. \n\n2. When processing the array from left to right, the cumulative sum must never be negative. \n\nWait, but what about the third element? \n\nWait, the cumulative sum here is the sum of a[0] to a[i]. \n\nWait, but in the example I just thought of, the cumulative sum after second element is 2-3 = -1, which is negative. So it would be rejected. \n\nSo this seems to be a valid condition. \n\nWait, but why does this work? \n\nLet me think of the cumulative sum as the net number of steps to the right minus left up to that point. \n\nWait, perhaps the cumulative sum represents the net displacement up to that point. \n\nWait, the cumulative sum of a[0] to a[i] must be non-negative because otherwise, the pointer would have to move left more than right up to that point, which might not be possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the cumulative sum condition ensures that the path can reach each position. \n\nSo the algorithm would be: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n- Check if the sum of the array is zero. \n\n- Check that the cumulative sum of the array from the first element to any position i is non-negative. \n\nWait, but what about the last element? \n\nWait, the cumulative sum of the entire array must be zero (since sum is zero). \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\nsum(a) ==0 \n\nand for all i from 0 to n-1, the partial sum up to i (starting from a[0] to a[i]) must be >=0. \n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem's note, the second test case's array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe partial sums are: \n\n2, 1, 0, 0. All non-negative. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother example: the first test case's array (not given, but the note says it can be obtained but pointer not at first element). \n\nSuppose the array is [1,0]. \n\nSum is 1, so it's rejected. \n\nWait, but the note says that in the first test case, the array can be obtained but the pointer isn't at first element. So the sum must be zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the first test case's array has sum zero but the cumulative sum is negative somewhere. \n\nFor example, suppose the array is [1, -1, 0]. \n\nSum is zero. \n\nCumulative sums: 1, 0, 0. \n\nSo it would be accepted. \n\nBut if the array is [0, 1, -1], then the cumulative sums are 0, 1, 0. \n\nAlso okay. \n\nHmm, so the conditions are: \n\nsum must be zero, and all partial sums (from first to ith element) must be non-negative. \n\nWait, but what about the third element in the array? \n\nWait, the partial sum up to the third element must also be non-negative. \n\nWait, but the total sum is zero, so the last partial sum is zero. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\nsum(a) ==0 \n\nand for all i from 0 to n-1, the partial sum s_i = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i] >=0 \n\nWait, but what about the other direction? \n\nFor example, suppose the array is [3, -1, -2]. \n\nSum is 0. \n\nPartial sums: 3, 2, 0. \n\nAll non-negative. So it would be accepted. \n\nBut what about the array [ -1, 1 ]? \n\nSum is 0. \n\nPartial sums: -1 (which is negative), so rejected. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct condition. \n\nThus, the algorithm is: \n\nFor each test case: \n\n1. Compute the sum of the array. If it's not zero, output No. \n\n2. Compute the partial sums from left to right. If any partial sum is negative, output No. \n\n3. Else, output Yes. \n\nWait, but what about the pointer's final position? \n\nThe conditions above ensure that the path can be formed such that the pointer ends at 0? \n\nHmm, let me think of the example where the array is [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe partial sums are all non-negative. \n\nThe path can be formed as described in the problem's note. \n\nAnother example: [1,1,-2]. \n\nPartial sums are 1, 2, 0. \n\nWhich is okay. \n\nThe path can be formed as I thought earlier. \n\nAnother test case: [0,0,0]. \n\nSum is zero. Partial sums are 0,0,0. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case: n=1. \n\nThe array must be [0]. \n\nSum is zero. Partial sum is 0. \n\nYes. \n\nIf the array is [5], sum is 5 \u2192 no. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nThus, the code should implement these two conditions. \n\nNow, let's look at the given code skeleton. \n\nThe code has a loop over test cases. \n\nFor each test case: \n\nRead n, then read the array. \n\nThe code currently has a loop over the array elements, with 'last' and 'flag' variables. \n\nThe code's current code is: \n\nlast=0; flag=true;\n\nfor(int i=0;i<n;i++){\n\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n\n}\n\nif(last!=0) flag=false;\n\ncout<<((flag)?\"Yes\":\"No\")<<endl;\n\nHmm, so the code needs to compute the sum and the partial sums. \n\nWait, but the code is supposed to read the array elements and process them in a loop. \n\nThe variables 'last' and 'flag' are used. \n\nThe final check is whether last is zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the code can be modified to track the partial sum and the total sum. \n\nWait, let me think of how to implement the conditions. \n\nThe sum can be tracked as we go. \n\nThe partial sum can also be tracked. \n\nLet me see: \n\nInitialize sum_so_far =0, total_sum=0. \n\nFor each element a[i]: \n\nsum_so_far += a[i]; \n\ntotal_sum += a[i]; \n\nif sum_so_far <0 \u2192 flag = false. \n\nAt the end, check if total_sum is zero and flag is still true. \n\nWait, but the code's existing variables are 'last' and 'flag'. \n\nThe code's current code has 'last' initialized to 0. \n\nPerhaps 'last' is supposed to track the partial sum. \n\nWait, let me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can track the partial sum as 'last'. \n\nInitialize last =0. \n\nFor each element a[i]: \n\nlast += a[i]; \n\nif (last <0) \u2192 flag = false. \n\nAlso, after processing all elements, the total sum is last (since it's the sum of all a[i]). \n\nWait, yes! \n\nBecause the total sum is the final value of 'last'. \n\nSo the conditions are: \n\n- The final 'last' must be zero (sum is zero). \n\n- During the iteration, 'last' must never be negative. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows: \n\nInitialize last =0, flag = true. \n\nfor each element in the array: \n\n    last += a[i]; \n\n    if (last <0) \u2192 flag = false; \n\nAt the end, also check if last ==0. \n\nThus, the code's existing variables can be used. \n\nThe code's existing code has 'last' and 'flag'. \n\nThe loop over the array elements is in the for loop. \n\nSo the missing code inside the for loop is: \n\ncin >> a; \n\nWait, the code currently has 'a' declared as a long long. \n\nWait, looking at the code: \n\nThe variables declared are: \n\nlong long t,n,a,last; \n\nWait, but in the loop, for each test case, the code reads n, then loops for i from 0 to n-1. \n\nBut the variable 'a' is a single long long. \n\nAh, this is a problem. \n\nThe code as given has a variable 'a' declared as a long long, but in the loop, it's supposed to read the array elements. \n\nWait, the code's variables are declared as: \n\nlong long t,n,a,last; \n\nBut inside the loop, the code is: \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    /* code here */ \n\n} \n\nSo the variable 'a' is a single variable, but the array has n elements. \n\nThis is a mistake in the code skeleton provided. \n\nAh, right, the code is incomplete. \n\nThe user probably intended to read the array elements into an array, but in the given code, the variables are declared as 'a' (a single long long). \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nSo the code needs to be fixed. \n\nWait, the user's code has: \n\n#include <bits/stdc++.h> \n\nusing namespace std; \n\nlong long t,n,a,last; \n\nbool flag; \n\nint main(){ \n\n    cin>>t; \n\n    while(t--){ \n\n        cin>>n; \n\n        last=0; flag=true; \n\n        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){ \n\n            /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n        } \n\n        if(last!=0) flag=false; \n\n        cout<<((flag)?\"Yes\":\"No\")<<endl; \n\n    } \n\n    return 0; \n\n} \n\nThe problem is that the code is missing the array storage. \n\nThe variable 'a' is declared as a single long long, but in the loop, we need to read each element of the array. \n\nSo the code is incorrect. \n\nThe user probably intended to have an array to store the elements. \n\nBut since the code is given as such, perhaps the correct way is to read each element into a variable, and process it. \n\nWait, but in the code's current setup, the variable 'a' is a single variable. \n\nSo perhaps the code should read each element into 'a', and process it. \n\nLike: \n\nfor(int i=0; i <n; i++) { \n\n    cin >> a; \n\n    // process a \n\n} \n\nThus, in the loop, each element is read into 'a', and then processed. \n\nSo the code inside the for loop should be: \n\ncin >> a; \n\nlast += a; \n\nif (last <0) flag = false; \n\nWait, but then after processing all elements, the 'last' will be the total sum. \n\nSo the code would be: \n\nInside the for loop: \n\ncin >> a; \n\nlast += a; \n\nif (last <0) flag = false; \n\nThen, after the loop, check if last is zero. \n\nThe existing code already has 'if(last !=0) flag = false;' \n\nSo combining these: \n\nThe code inside the for loop should read the current element into 'a', add to last, and check if last is negative. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\ncin >> a; \n\nlast += a; \n\nif (last <0) flag = false; \n\nWait, but the code's existing 'flag' is initialized to true. \n\nSo the code would be: \n\nfor each element: \n\nread a \n\nadd to last \n\nif last <0 \u2192 set flag to false \n\nThen after the loop, check if last is zero. \n\nThus, the code would correctly compute the conditions. \n\nBut let me check for the case where the sum is zero but some partial sum is negative. \n\nFor example, array [-1, 1]. \n\nThe first element is -1 \u2192 last becomes -1 \u2192 flag is set to false. \n\nThus, the code would output No. \n\nAnother example: [2, -1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe first element: 2 \u2192 last=2 \u2192 ok. \n\nSecond: -1 \u2192 last=1 \u2192 ok. \n\nThird: -1 \u2192 last=0 \u2192 ok. \n\nFourth: 0 \u2192 last=0 \u2192 ok. \n\nThus, flag remains true. \n\nAfter loop, last is 0 \u2192 flag remains true. \n\nThus, output yes. \n\nAnother example: [1,1,-2]. \n\nPartial sums are 1, 2, 0 \u2192 all non-negative. \n\nThus, flag stays true. \n\nThus, the code would work. \n\nNow, what about the case where the sum is zero but the final last is zero but some partial sum was negative? \n\nLike array [ -1, 1, 0]. \n\nThe first element: -1 \u2192 last becomes -1 \u2192 flag set to false. \n\nThus, the code would output No. \n\nThus, this approach works. \n\nSo the missing code inside the for loop is: \n\ncin >> a; \n\nlast += a; \n\nif (last <0) flag = false; \n\nThus, the code should be filled with those three lines. \n\nWait, but the code's variables: \n\nThe variable 'a' is declared as a long long. \n\nIn the loop, each iteration reads into 'a', which is okay. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nInside the for loop: \n\ncin >> a; \n\nlast += a; \n\nif (last < 0) flag = false; \n\nThat's the missing code. \n\nThus, the answer is those three lines. \n\nWait, but the code's existing 'flag' is initialized to true. \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the code will work. \n\nSo the missing code is: \n\ncin >> a; \n\nlast += a; \n\nif (last < 0) flag = false; \n\nThus, the user should output these three lines as the missing code. \n\nNow, checking edge cases: \n\nTest case n=1: \n\nThe array must be [0]. \n\nThe code reads a=0. \n\nlast becomes 0. \n\nNo partial sum is negative. \n\nAfter loop, last is 0 \u2192 flag remains true. \n\nThus, output yes. \n\nIf the array is [5], then last is 5 \u2192 after loop, flag is set to false (because last !=0). \n\nThus, output no. \n\nAnother case: n=2, array [1,-1]. \n\nPartial sums are 1,0 \u2192 ok. \n\nThus, yes. \n\nAnother case: array [3,-3]. \n\nPartial sums: 3,0 \u2192 ok. \n\nThus, yes. \n\nAnother case: array [0,0,0]. \n\nAll partial sums are 0 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, the code works. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is those three lines."
