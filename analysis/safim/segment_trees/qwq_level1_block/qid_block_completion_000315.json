The condition fist || index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) ! =0 suggests that the first iteration (when fist is true) allows entering the loop even if the next element is zero. Wait, maybe the inner loop is supposed to process a block of elements until a non-zero is found? Or perhaps it's processing until the next zero? Not sure yet. Wait, the code's structure is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it step by step. The outer loop is going through each element. When it hits a zero (lst.get(index) ==0), it enters the block where it initializes a HashMap, mostFreq to sum, index2 to index, and fist is true. Then the inner while loop runs as long as fist is true (the first time) or index2 < arrSz and the element at index2 is not zero. Wait, the condition is written as (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) ! =0)). Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me see: the condition is (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)). So the first time (fist is true), it enters the loop regardless of the element. Then, in subsequent iterations, it continues as long as index2 is within bounds and the current element is non-zero.",

Let's denote S_i as the sum of the first i elements. The score is the number of i where S_i =0. We can choose to set any zero in the array to any value. The goal is to choose these values such that the number of S_i =0 is maximized.

Hmm, perhaps the optimal strategy is to make as many S_i as possible zero, by adjusting the zeros in the array. Let me think of the prefix sum array. Suppose that between two non-zero elements, there are some zeros. We can adjust those zeros to set the prefix sums in such a way that the maximum number of zeros are achieved.

If we set the third zero to -3, then the sum after third element is 0. Yes, so that's correct. Hmm, this approach seems to work. So the algorithm is: \n\nWhenever you encounter a zero, set it to -current_sum. This makes the current prefix sum zero, and then the next elements start from there. This way, every zero can contribute to a new zero in the prefix sum. The count is the number of times the prefix sum is zero after each step. Wait, but how do we track this? The algorithm would be: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, count=0.",

Which is correct. This seems to work. So the code needs to implement this approach. But the given code's structure is different. Let me look at the existing code again. The existing code has a loop that goes through each element. When it hits a zero, it enters a block where it uses a HashMap and some variables. Hmm, perhaps the existing code is trying to do something similar but in a more complex way. Wait, the code's outer loop is: \n\nwhile (index < arrSz) { \n\n   if (current element is zero) { \n\n      ... \n\n   } else { \n\n      sum += element; \n\n      if (sum ==0) count++; \n\n      index++; \n\n   } \n\n} So the code is processing elements one by one, but when it hits a zero, it enters a more complex block. The problem with the existing code is that when a zero is encountered, it's not handled in a straightforward way. The code inside the zero case is trying to process a segment of elements starting from the current zero. The code's variables: \n\nsum is the current prefix sum before processing the current segment. The inner loop (with index2) is trying to process elements from the current zero (index) onwards. The code uses a HashMap hm to track frequencies of some values. The idea might be to find the best possible adjustment for the current segment of zeros and non-zeros.",

The code's inner loop would process elements starting from index2 =1 (the zero). The inner loop's first iteration (fist is true) allows processing the zero. Then, the next elements are 1, -1, 0. Wait, but the inner loop's condition is (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)). So after the first iteration (processing the zero), the next elements are checked.

The count is increased by the frequency of that value. The sum is then set to mostFreq. In the first example, the mostFreq is 0 (frequency 2). The count increases by 2. But the total count is 3. Hmm, perhaps the initial zero's contribution is also counted. Wait, the current zero is set to x = mostFreq - sum_before. In the first example, mostFreq is 0, sum_before is 2 \u2192 x = -2. The prefix sum after the current zero is 0. This contributes 1 to the count. Then, the subsequent elements' cumulative sums are 1 and 0. The cumulative sums after the current zero's position are: \n\n0 (after the current zero), \n\n0+1=1 (after first element), \n\n1-1=0 (after second element). So the zeros are at the current zero's position and after the second element. That's two zeros. But the example's count from this segment is 2 (the current zero's contribution and the second element's contribution). But the total count also includes the fifth element's contribution. Hmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct but the initial code has some errors. Alternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct but the inner loop is not implemented properly. The problem is to fill in the missing code inside the while loop. The code's inner loop is: \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n} \n\nInside this loop, the code needs to process each element in the segment.",

Thus, the total_segment_sum = x + s_last. The new sum is sum_before + x + s_last. But x is chosen as - most_freq_s_i. Thus, the new sum is sum_before - most_freq_s_i + s_last. This is getting too complicated. Perhaps the code's approach is correct, and the missing code inside the while loop is: \n\nlong currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\nsumTemp += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(sumTemp, hm.getOrDefault(sumTemp, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nThis way, the cumulative sums are tracked. The most frequent sum is the key with the highest count. The count is increased by the frequency of this sum. The sum is then adjusted to sum + (mostFreq - sum_before) ? Wait, the code has: \n\ncount += hm.get(mostFreq); \n\nsum += -1 * mostFreq; \n\nHmm, perhaps the mostFreq is the most frequent sum in the map. The optimal x is chosen such that sum_before +x = - mostFreq. Thus, x = - mostFreq - sum_before. The new sum after the current zero is sum_before +x = - mostFreq. The subsequent elements' contributions are added to this new sum. The total new sum after processing the entire segment is: \n\nnew_sum = (sum_before +x) + (sum of elements after the current zero's position) \n\n= - mostFreq + (sum of elements after the current zero's position) But the sum of elements after the current zero's position is the last cumulative sum in the map. The last cumulative sum is the total of the elements after the current zero's position. Thus, new_sum = - mostFreq + s_last. But the code's adjustment is sum += - mostFreq. The initial sum is sum_before. After processing the segment, the new sum is sum_before + ( - mostFreq ). This would be the case if the entire segment's contribution is - mostFreq. But I'm not sure.",

But in the given code, the variables are declared outside. Wait, the code's existing variables are: \n\nsum is the current sum before the segment. The code's inner loop needs to compute the cumulative sums of the elements in the segment. Thus, the code inside the loop should be: \n\nlong tempSum = 0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   tempSum += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nBut the variable tempSum is not declared in the given code. Thus, the code must declare it inside the loop. Alternatively, the code can use a variable declared inside the block. The code inside the zero case block has: \n\nHashMap< Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>(); \n\nlong mostFreq = sum; \n\nint index2 = index; \n\nboolean fist = true; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n} Thus, the code inside the loop can declare a variable tempSum. But in Java, variables declared inside the loop are visible in the loop's iterations. Thus, the code inside the loop should be: \n\nlong tempSum = 0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   tempSum += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} Wait, but the tempSum is declared inside the while loop's initialization. Wait, no. The code inside the loop must be placed inside the while loop's body. Wait, the code inside the loop must be placed inside the while loop's body. Thus, the code inside the loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\nlong tempSum = 0; \n\n// no, this won't work because tempSum is reinitialized each iteration. Alternatively, the code should declare tempSum outside the loop. Thus, the code should be: \n\nlong tempSum =0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   tempSum += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nThis way, tempSum is declared outside the loop and accumulates the sum. Thus, the missing code inside the while loop is: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nBut the variable tempSum must be declared outside the loop. Thus, the code should have: \n\nlong tempSum =0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   tempSum += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nBut in the given code, the variables are declared in the outer block. Thus, the code inside the zero case block should declare tempSum before the loop. The existing code has: \n\nHashMap< Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>(); \n\nlong mostFreq = sum; \n\nint index2 = index; \n\nboolean fist = true; \n\n// declare tempSum here \n\nlong tempSum =0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   tempSum += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nThus, the missing code inside the while loop is the code that increments tempSum and updates the map. Therefore, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nBut the code must be placed inside the while loop's body.

The code's missing part inside the while loop is: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; Thus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0",

The elements in the segment are [0,1,-1,0]. Wait, but the next zero is at index 4 (the fifth element). The inner loop would process the current zero (index2=1), then the next elements (1, -1, 0). Wait, but the condition for continuing after the first iteration is whether the element is non-zero. So after processing the first element (the zero at index2=1), the next element is 1 (non-zero), so it's processed. Then, the next element is -1 (non-zero), so processed. Then, the next element is 0 (the fifth element). At this point, the condition (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0) is false (since the element is zero). So the loop stops. Thus, the segment processed is up to index2=3 (the fourth element, which is -1). Wait, perhaps the code is processing the current zero and all non-zero elements after it until the next zero.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code to solve the problem. Let's start by understanding the problem again. The task is to find the maximum possible score of an array after replacing zeros with arbitrary integers. The score is the number of indices where the prefix sum up to that index is zero. \n\nHmm, the approach here probably involves looking for positions where we can set zeros in the prefix sums by strategically choosing which zeros to replace. The key idea is that whenever there's a zero in the array, we can adjust it to influence the prefix sums. \n\nLooking at the given code structure, there's a loop that goes through each element. When it encounters a zero (lst.get(index) == 0), it starts a while loop with some variables like a HashMap hm, mostFreq, index2, and a boolean fist. The code inside the TODO is missing. \n\nWait, the existing code seems to be trying to process a segment of zeros and non-zeros. Let me think. The outer loop is processing the array, and when a zero is found, it's trying to handle a block of elements starting from that zero. The inner loop (the while loop) might be trying to find a range where we can adjust the zeros to maximize the count. \n\nThe variables like hm (a frequency map) and mostFreq suggest that they are tracking the frequency of some values in the current segment. The idea might be to find the most frequent prefix sum before and after the current zero, so that by choosing the right value for the zero, we can maximize the number of times the prefix sum hits zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to process a stretch of zeros and non-zeros, and for that stretch, determine the best way to set the zeros so that the maximum possible prefix sums are zero. \n\nLet me think of the example given. In the first test case, the array after modification has a score of 3. The key was changing a_2 to -2. The prefix sums at positions 2,4,5 are zero. \n\nThe approach might involve, for each segment between non-zero elements (or the start/end), adjusting the zeros in that segment to create as many zeros in the prefix sum as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the possible prefix sums in a segment and choose the one that occurs most frequently, so that by setting the zeros in that segment to adjust the sum to that value, we can maximize the count. \n\nLooking at the code's variables: \n\nInside the zero case, they have a HashMap hm, which probably counts the frequency of some prefix sums. The mostFreq variable is initialized to sum. The inner loop (while (fist || ... )) seems to loop over elements starting from index2 (which is initially index, the current zero's position). The condition fist || index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) !=0 suggests that the first iteration (when fist is true) allows entering the loop even if the next element is zero. Wait, maybe the inner loop is supposed to process a block of elements until a non-zero is found? Or perhaps it's processing until the next zero? Not sure yet. \n\nWait, the code's structure is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it step by step. \n\nThe outer loop is going through each element. When it hits a zero (lst.get(index) ==0), it enters the block where it initializes a HashMap, mostFreq to sum, index2 to index, and fist is true. Then the inner while loop runs as long as fist is true (the first time) or index2 < arrSz and the element at index2 is not zero. \n\nWait, the condition is written as (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2) !=0)). Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. Let me see: the condition is (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)). So the first time (fist is true), it enters the loop regardless of the element. Then, in subsequent iterations, it continues as long as index2 is within bounds and the current element is non-zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the inner loop is trying to process a sequence of elements starting from the current zero, but only moving forward until the next zero? Or maybe it's trying to process a block of elements until the next zero? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the inner loop is trying to collect all the elements from the current position (index) until the next zero, but I'm not sure. \n\nThe goal here is to find the best way to set the zeros in this segment so that the number of prefix sums that are zero is maximized. \n\nWait, perhaps the idea is that when we have a zero in the array, we can choose to set it to a value that allows the prefix sum to reach zero at that point. But how does that fit into the code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is trying to track the possible prefix sums in the current segment and choose the one that occurs most frequently, so that by adjusting the zeros, we can make those points zero. \n\nLet me think of the process. Suppose we have a segment of elements where some are zeros. We can replace those zeros with any numbers. The key is to choose the numbers such that as many prefix sums as possible are zero. \n\nSuppose the current position is a zero. The code is trying to process a block of elements starting at this zero. The inner loop is moving index2 forward, collecting some information. \n\nThe HashMap hm might be counting the frequency of some values related to the prefix sums. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the possible target values for the current segment. Let me think of the following approach: \n\nWhen we encounter a zero, we can choose to set it to a value such that the prefix sum up to that point is adjusted. To maximize the number of zeros in the prefix sums, we can look ahead to see what the possible sums would be if we set the zeros in this segment optimally. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: the maximum possible score can be achieved by making the prefix sum zero at as many positions as possible. To do this, whenever there's a zero in the array, we can adjust it to influence the prefix sums. \n\nThe optimal strategy might involve making the prefix sum zero at every possible position where it's possible by setting the zeros appropriately. \n\nAnother approach is to track the prefix sums and see where we can insert zeros. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to process a segment of the array where there are consecutive zeros. For each such segment, we can adjust the zeros in that segment to create as many zeros in the prefix sum as possible. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach: \n\nThe maximum score is the maximum number of times the prefix sum can be zero. To do this, whenever there's a zero in the array, we can set it to a value that allows the prefix sum to reach zero at that position. \n\nThe key is to track the current prefix sum and see how we can adjust the zeros to create more zeros in the prefix sums. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to do the following: \n\nWhen we hit a zero, we need to decide what value to set it to. The best choice would be to set it such that the prefix sum up to that point is zero. But that might interfere with previous or next sums. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be considering a range of elements starting from the current zero and trying to find the best way to set the zeros in that range to maximize the count. \n\nLooking back at the code's variables: \n\nThe sum variable is the current prefix sum before processing the current segment. \n\nThe inner loop is processing elements starting from index2 (the current zero's position). The loop continues as long as the next element is non-zero. Wait, no, the condition is a bit different. \n\nWait, the inner loop's condition is (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)). \n\nThe first time (fist is true), it enters the loop even if the next element is zero. Then, in subsequent iterations, it continues only if the element is non-zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the inner loop is trying to process a block of elements starting from the current zero, but only moving forward until the next zero. \n\nWait, maybe the inner loop is trying to collect all the elements from the current position (index) until the next zero. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to process a segment where the current element is a zero, and then look ahead to see how far the non-zero elements go, and then compute the best possible adjustment. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the best possible value to set the current zero so that the number of prefix sums that become zero is maximized. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the possible target sums. Let me think of the following steps: \n\nSuppose we have a zero at position i. We can choose to set it to x. The prefix sum up to i would then be the previous sum plus x. To make this zero, x would have to be -previous_sum. But that might affect the subsequent sums. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be considering that when there are multiple zeros in a row, we can set them in a way that allows multiple prefix sums to be zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the best possible way to set the current zero and the following zeros (if any) so that the maximum number of prefix sums become zero. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample: \n\nThe maximum possible score is the number of times the prefix sum can be zero. To maximize this, whenever there's a zero in the array, we can adjust it so that the prefix sum up to that point is zero. However, this might require adjusting previous or next elements. \n\nAlternatively, the optimal approach is to make the entire prefix sum sequence have as many zeros as possible. The key is that whenever there's a zero in the array, we can set it to a value that allows the prefix sum to reach zero at that point, and also possibly at later points. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the possible prefix sums in a segment and choose the most frequent one to set the zeros such that the maximum number of those can be turned into zeros. \n\nLooking at the code's variables: \n\nThe HashMap hm is being used, and mostFreq is the key with the highest frequency. \n\nSuppose that in the inner loop, for each element in the current segment (starting from the current zero), we compute some value and track their frequencies. The most frequent value would be the one that, when adjusted, allows the maximum number of zeros. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the possible target sums for the current segment. Let me think of the following steps: \n\nWhen we hit a zero at position i, we can choose to set it to a value such that the prefix sum up to i is adjusted. The idea is to look ahead to see what the next non-zero elements are, and see what the possible sums would be. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible approach: \n\nThe maximum possible score is the number of times the prefix sum can be zero. To do this, whenever there's a zero in the array, we can set it to a value that allows the prefix sum to reach zero at that point. However, this might interfere with previous or next sums. \n\nThe optimal way is to make the prefix sum zero at as many positions as possible. \n\nLet me think of the prefix sum array. Let's denote S_i as the sum of the first i elements. The score is the number of i where S_i =0. \n\nWe can choose to set any zero in the array to any value. The goal is to choose these values such that the number of S_i =0 is maximized. \n\nThe key is that when we have a zero in the array at position k (a_k =0), we can set a_k to x, which will affect all S_i for i >=k. \n\nThe problem is to choose x's for all zeros such that the number of S_i=0 is maximized. \n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal strategy is to make as many S_i as possible zero, by adjusting the zeros in the array. \n\nLet me think of the prefix sum array. Suppose that between two non-zero elements, there are some zeros. We can adjust those zeros to set the prefix sums in such a way that the maximum number of zeros are achieved. \n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample: \n\nThe maximum possible score is the number of times the prefix sum can be zero, which can be achieved by making the prefix sum zero at every possible position where it's possible. \n\nTo do this, whenever there's a zero in the array, we can set it such that the prefix sum up to that point is zero. However, this requires that the previous prefix sum plus the chosen value equals zero. \n\nWait, but this might conflict with previous choices. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be approached by considering the prefix sums and the positions where we can adjust the zeros. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can track the current prefix sum. Whenever we encounter a zero, we can choose to set it to a value that allows the current prefix sum plus this value to be zero. This way, the prefix sum at this position becomes zero, contributing to the score. \n\nBut then, the next elements' prefix sums will be based on this new value. \n\nHowever, this might not be optimal because setting the zero to make the current prefix sum zero might prevent future opportunities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to make the entire prefix sum sequence have as many zeros as possible. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nInitialize the current sum as 0. \n\nWe can iterate through the array, and whenever we encounter a zero, we can choose to set it to a value that allows the current sum plus this value to be zero. This way, the prefix sum at this position is zero, and the next elements' sums start from zero. \n\nWait, but this might not be possible if the next elements are non-zero. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible algorithm: \n\nThe maximum possible score is the number of times the prefix sum can be zero. To maximize this, whenever there is a zero in the array, we can set it such that the prefix sum up to that point is zero. \n\nThis way, each zero can potentially contribute to a new zero in the prefix sum. \n\nBut how do we handle overlapping conditions? \n\nLet me think of the example given in the first test case: \n\nOriginal array: [2,0,1,-1,0]. \n\nThe optimal solution is to set the second element (0) to -2. \n\nThe new array is [2, -2, 1, -1, 0]. \n\nThe prefix sums are: \n\n2 \u2192 0 (count 1), \n\nthen 0 +1 =1, \n\nthen 0 (after adding -1 \u2192 0 again at position 4?), \n\nthen adding 0 gives 0 again at position 5. \n\nWait, the example's explanation says the score is 3. The positions are 2 (sum 0), 4 (sum 0), and 5 (sum 0). \n\nSo the second element (index 1, 0-based?) was set to -2, making the sum up to index 1 (assuming 1-based) zero. \n\nHmm, so the idea is that by setting the zero to a value that makes the current prefix sum zero, and then proceeding, you can have more zeros in the future. \n\nSo the algorithm could be: \n\nWhenever you encounter a zero, set it to a value that makes the current prefix sum zero. \n\nThis way, every time you hit a zero, you can make the prefix sum zero there, and then the next elements can start from zero again. \n\nBut how does this work with the rest of the array? \n\nLet me think of the steps: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, count=0. \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\nIf the element is zero: \n\n   set it to -current_sum \u2192 so the new current_sum becomes zero. \n\n   count +=1 (since the current prefix sum is zero). \n\nElse: \n\n   add the element to current_sum. \n\n   if current_sum is zero, increment count. \n\nWait, but this might not account for all possibilities. \n\nWait, let's see the first example: \n\nOriginal array: [2,0,1,-1,0]. \n\nProcessing first element (2): \n\ncurrent_sum +=2 \u2192 2. Not zero, so count remains 0. \n\nSecond element is zero. \n\nSet it to -2 \u2192 current_sum becomes 0. \n\ncount +=1 (now 1). \n\nThird element is 1 \u2192 current_sum becomes 1. Not zero. \n\nFourth element is -1 \u2192 current_sum becomes 0 \u2192 count +=1 (now 2). \n\nFifth element is zero \u2192 set to -0 (since current_sum is 0). \n\ncurrent_sum remains 0 \u2192 count +=1 (total 3). \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nHmm, this seems promising. \n\nAnother example: the third test case where no operations are needed. Suppose the array is [0,0,0]. \n\nIf we set each zero to -current_sum: \n\nFirst zero: set to 0 (current_sum is 0 \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 sum remains 0 \u2192 count 1. \n\nSecond zero: set to -0 \u2192 sum remains 0 \u2192 count 2. \n\nThird zero: set to -0 \u2192 sum remains 0 \u2192 count 3. \n\nSo the maximum score is 3, which is correct. \n\nAnother test case: the second example where the array is [1, 0, 2000000000]. \n\nThe optimal is to set the second element (0) to -1, so the array becomes [1, -1, 2000000000]. \n\nThe prefix sums are 1, 0 (count 1), then 2000000001 \u2192 so the total is 1, which matches the sample. \n\nSo this approach seems to work. \n\nWait, but what about cases where there are multiple zeros in a row? \n\nSuppose the array is [0,0,0]. \n\nFollowing the approach: \n\nFirst zero: set to 0 \u2192 sum is 0 \u2192 count 1. \n\nSecond zero: set to -0 \u2192 sum remains 0 \u2192 count 2. \n\nThird zero: set to -0 \u2192 sum remains 0 \u2192 count 3. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother case: array [0, 3, 0]. \n\nProcessing first zero: set to 0 \u2192 sum 0 \u2192 count 1. \n\nSecond element is 3 \u2192 sum 3 \u2192 not zero. \n\nThird zero: set to -3 \u2192 sum becomes 0 \u2192 count 2. \n\nTotal count is 2. \n\nAlternatively, could we get a higher count? \n\nIf we set the third zero to -3, then the sum after third element is 0. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nHmm, this approach seems to work. \n\nSo the algorithm is: \n\nWhenever you encounter a zero, set it to -current_sum. This makes the current prefix sum zero, and then the next elements start from there. \n\nThis way, every zero can contribute to a new zero in the prefix sum. \n\nThe count is the number of times the prefix sum is zero after each step. \n\nWait, but how do we track this? \n\nThe algorithm would be: \n\nInitialize current_sum =0, count=0. \n\nFor each element in the array: \n\n   if the element is zero: \n\n      set it to -current_sum \u2192 so the new value is -current_sum. \n\n      current_sum += (-current_sum) \u2192 which makes current_sum 0. \n\n      count +=1 \n\n   else: \n\n      current_sum += element \n\n      if current_sum ==0 \u2192 count +=1 \n\nWait, but this would be the case. \n\nWait, let's see the first example again: \n\nOriginal array: [2,0,1,-1,0]. \n\nProcessing first element (2): \n\ncurrent_sum +=2 \u2192 2. Not zero \u2192 count remains 0. \n\nSecond element is zero \u2192 set to -2 \u2192 current_sum becomes 0 \u2192 count +=1 (now 1). \n\nThird element is 1 \u2192 current_sum +=1 \u2192 1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nFourth element is -1 \u2192 current_sum becomes 0 \u2192 count +=1 (now 2). \n\nFifth element is zero \u2192 set to -0 \u2192 current_sum remains 0 \u2192 count +=1 (now 3). \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nAnother test case: [1,0,2000000000]. \n\nProcessing first element (1): current_sum 1 \u2192 not zero. \n\nSecond element (0) \u2192 set to -1 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 count 1. \n\nThird element (2000000000) \u2192 current_sum +=2e9 \u2192 2e9 \u2192 not zero. \n\nTotal count 1. \n\nWhich matches the second sample. \n\nAnother test case: [0,0,0]. \n\nProcessing first zero \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 count 1. \n\nSecond zero \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 count 2. \n\nThird zero \u2192 set to 0 \u2192 current_sum 0 \u2192 count 3. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nThis seems to work. \n\nSo the code needs to implement this approach. \n\nBut the given code's structure is different. Let me look at the existing code again. \n\nThe existing code has a loop that goes through each element. When it hits a zero, it enters a block where it uses a HashMap and some variables. \n\nHmm, perhaps the existing code is trying to do something similar but in a more complex way. \n\nWait, the code's outer loop is: \n\nwhile (index < arrSz) { \n\n   if (current element is zero) { \n\n      ... \n\n   } else { \n\n      sum += element; \n\n      if (sum ==0) count++; \n\n      index++; \n\n   } \n\n} \n\nSo the code is processing elements one by one, but when it hits a zero, it enters a more complex block. \n\nThe problem with the existing code is that when a zero is encountered, it's not handled in a straightforward way. \n\nThe code inside the zero case is trying to process a segment of elements starting from the current zero. \n\nThe code's variables: \n\nsum is the current prefix sum before processing the current segment. \n\nThe inner loop (with index2) is trying to process elements from the current zero (index) onwards. \n\nThe code uses a HashMap hm to track frequencies of some values. \n\nThe idea might be to find the best possible adjustment for the current segment of zeros and non-zeros. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the best possible value to set the current zero so that the maximum number of prefix sums in the current segment can be zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the most frequent prefix sum in the current segment, so that by adjusting the zeros, we can make that many zeros. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's variables again. \n\nInside the zero case: \n\nsum is the current prefix sum before the current zero. \n\nThe code initializes a HashMap hm. \n\nThen, in the inner loop, it's processing elements from index2 (starting at index) until the next zero (or end of array). \n\nWait, the inner loop's condition is (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)). \n\nThe first iteration (fist is true) allows entering the loop even if the next element is zero. \n\nThen, in subsequent iterations, it continues only if the element is non-zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the inner loop is processing a block of elements starting from the current zero, and moving forward until the next zero. \n\nWait, but the condition is a bit tricky. \n\nAlternatively, the inner loop is trying to collect all the elements from the current zero until the next zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to process a segment of elements starting at the current zero and continuing until the next zero. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to process a segment of elements where the first element is a zero, and then the following elements are non-zero until the next zero. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the best way to set the current zero and the following zeros (if any) in a way that maximizes the count. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the best possible value to set the current zero so that the number of prefix sums that can be zero in the current segment is maximized. \n\nThe code uses a HashMap to track the frequency of some values. \n\nThe mostFreq variable is initialized to sum. \n\nThen, in the inner loop, perhaps they are collecting the prefix sums of the elements after the current zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the possible target sums for the current segment. \n\nLet me think of the following steps: \n\nWhen we hit a zero at position index, we can choose to set it to a value x. This will affect the prefix sum up to that point. \n\nThe idea is to choose x such that the number of times the prefix sum becomes zero in the current segment is maximized. \n\nThe current segment is from the current zero to the next zero (or end of array). \n\nThe code's inner loop is processing this segment. \n\nThe code's approach might be: \n\n- For the current segment (starting at the current zero), collect all the possible prefix sums after setting the current zero to x. \n\n- The best x is the one that allows the maximum number of zeros in the prefix sums of this segment. \n\n- The most frequent value in the prefix sums (excluding the current zero's contribution) would be the best candidate. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the possible prefix sums after the current zero. \n\nLet me think of the following: \n\nSuppose the current zero is at position i. \n\nWe can choose to set it to x. \n\nThe new prefix sum after i is sum_before + x. \n\nThen, the next elements (non-zero) will contribute to the prefix sum. \n\nThe goal is to choose x such that the number of times the prefix sum becomes zero in the current segment is maximized. \n\nThe code's approach might be to track the frequencies of the (sum_before + x + ... ) terms. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the best x such that the number of times the prefix sum reaches a certain value is maximized. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the most frequent value in the current segment's prefix sums (excluding the current zero's contribution), then set x to make the initial sum plus x equal to that value. \n\nWait, let me think of the code's variables again. \n\nThe code initializes a HashMap hm. \n\nInside the inner loop, for each element in the current segment (starting from index2 = index), they might be adding some values to the map. \n\nThe mostFreq variable is the key with the highest frequency in the map. \n\nThen, the code adds hm.get(mostFreq) to the count. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to find the best possible value to set the current zero so that the number of times the prefix sum reaches a certain value (mostFreq) is maximized, thereby allowing those to be turned into zeros. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the possible target sums and choose the one that occurs most frequently, so that by setting the current zero to adjust the sum to that value, the maximum number of zeros can be achieved. \n\nWait, let me think of the first example again. \n\nThe current zero is at index 1 (assuming 0-based). \n\nThe current sum before this zero is 2 (sum variable is 2). \n\nThe code's inner loop would process elements starting from index2 =1 (the zero). \n\nThe inner loop's first iteration (fist is true) allows processing the zero. \n\nThen, the next elements are 1, -1, 0. \n\nWait, but the inner loop's condition is (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)). \n\nSo after the first iteration (processing the zero), the next elements are checked. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to process all elements from the current zero until the next zero. \n\nWait, the inner loop's condition is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. \n\nThe inner loop runs while (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)). \n\nThe first time (fist is true), it enters the loop even if the next element is zero. \n\nThen, in subsequent iterations, it continues only if the element is non-zero. \n\nSo the loop will process the current element (the zero) first, then continue as long as the next elements are non-zero. \n\nWait, perhaps the inner loop is processing a block of elements starting from the current zero, and moving forward until the next zero. \n\nWait, the first iteration (fist is true) processes the current zero (index2 = index). \n\nThen, in the next iterations, it processes elements as long as they are non-zero. \n\nSo the loop will process the current zero, then all non-zero elements after it until a zero is encountered. \n\nThus, the inner loop is processing a segment from the current zero to the next zero (or end of array). \n\nInside this segment, the code is trying to track the possible prefix sums. \n\nThe code's approach is: \n\n- For the current segment (from current zero to next zero), collect all the possible prefix sums after the current zero. \n\n- The most frequent value among these sums is chosen as the target. \n\n- The number of occurrences of this value is added to the count. \n\n- The sum is then adjusted to this target value. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the best possible value to set the current zero so that the number of times the prefix sum reaches a certain value (mostFreq) is maximized. \n\nThe idea is that by setting the current zero to a value that makes the initial sum plus this value equal to mostFreq, then the subsequent elements' prefix sums can reach zero multiple times. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the possible prefix sums after the current zero and choose the one that occurs most frequently. \n\nLet me think of the first example's segment: \n\nThe current zero is at index 1 (element 0). \n\nThe segment includes this zero and the following elements until the next zero (which is at index 4). \n\nThe elements in the segment are [0,1,-1,0]. \n\nWait, but the next zero is at index 4 (the fifth element). \n\nThe inner loop would process the current zero (index2=1), then the next elements (1, -1, 0). \n\nWait, but the condition for continuing after the first iteration is whether the element is non-zero. \n\nSo after processing the first element (the zero at index2=1), the next element is 1 (non-zero), so it's processed. \n\nThen, the next element is -1 (non-zero), so processed. \n\nThen, the next element is 0 (the fifth element). \n\nAt this point, the condition (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0) is false (since the element is zero). \n\nSo the loop stops. \n\nThus, the segment processed is up to index2=3 (the fourth element, which is -1). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is processing the current zero and all non-zero elements after it until the next zero. \n\nThe code's inner loop is collecting the prefix sums of the elements after the current zero (excluding the current zero itself?), but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the possible prefix sums after the current zero. \n\nLet me think of the code's variables again. \n\nInside the zero case: \n\nsum is the current prefix sum before the current zero. \n\nThe code initializes a HashMap hm. \n\nThen, in the inner loop, for each element in the segment (starting from index2 = index), they might be adding some values to the map. \n\nThe mostFreq variable is initialized to sum. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the possible target sums. \n\nThe code's inner loop is processing elements from index2 (starting at the current zero's position) and moving forward until the next zero. \n\nFor each element in this segment, the code is adding the current element to a temporary sum, and tracking the frequencies of these sums. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is doing the following: \n\nInitialize a temporary sum (starting at sum_before = sum). \n\nThen, for each element in the segment (starting from the current zero's position), we add the element's value to the temporary sum, and track the frequencies of these sums. \n\nWait, but the current zero can be set to any value, so perhaps the code is trying to find the best possible value for the current zero such that the number of times the prefix sum reaches a certain value is maximized. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to find the most frequent value in the prefix sums of the elements after the current zero, then set the current zero's value so that the initial sum plus the current zero's value plus the elements' contributions equals that value. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too vague. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the possible prefix sums after the current zero and choose the one that occurs most frequently. \n\nThe most frequent value would be the best candidate to set the current zero's value so that the number of zeros in the prefix sums is maximized. \n\nThe count is then increased by the frequency of that value. \n\nThe sum is then adjusted to this value. \n\nWait, let me think of the first example again. \n\nThe current zero is at index 1 (element 0). \n\nThe segment includes elements from index 1 to 3 (since the next zero is at index 4). \n\nThe elements are 0 (current zero), 1, -1. \n\nThe initial sum before the current zero is 2. \n\nThe code's inner loop processes these elements. \n\nLet me see: \n\nInside the inner loop, for each element in the segment (starting at index2 =1), the code would do something like: \n\ntemp_sum = sum_before + (current element's value) \n\nWait, but the current element can be set to any value. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the possible prefix sums if the current zero is set to a certain value. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to compute the possible prefix sums after the current zero, assuming that the current zero is set to a value that allows the initial sum plus that value to be a certain value. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the possible prefix sums of the elements after the current zero (excluding the current zero's contribution). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is doing the following: \n\nThe current zero can be set to any value. Let's say we set it to x. \n\nThe new prefix sum after the current zero is sum_before + x. \n\nThen, the next elements (non-zero) contribute to the prefix sum. \n\nThe total prefix sum after each of those elements is (sum_before +x) + a_{i+1} + ... \n\nThe goal is to choose x such that the number of times the total prefix sum reaches zero is maximized. \n\nTo find the best x, we can look at the possible values of (sum_before +x) + ... \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the value of (sum_before +x) such that the number of times the subsequent elements' contributions plus this value equals zero is maximized. \n\nThe optimal x would be such that (sum_before +x) = - (sum of the elements after the current zero up to some point). \n\nThe most frequent such value would be the best choice. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the frequencies of the (sum of elements after the current zero up to each position). \n\nLet me think of the first example's segment: \n\nThe current zero is at index 1. \n\nThe elements after it (in the segment) are 1, -1 (since the next zero is at index4). \n\nThe sum of elements after the current zero (excluding the current zero's contribution) is 1 + (-1) =0. \n\nWait, but the elements are 1 and -1. \n\nThe possible prefix sums after the current zero (assuming x is set to some value) would be: \n\nAfter the first element (1): (sum_before +x) +1 \n\nAfter the second element (-1): (sum_before +x) +1-1 = sum_before +x \n\nSo to have these sums be zero, we can set x such that: \n\nsum_before +x +1 =0 \u2192 x = - (sum_before +1) \n\nsum_before +x =0 \u2192 x = -sum_before \n\nSo the best x would be -sum_before, which would make the second element's prefix sum zero. \n\nBut how does this relate to the code's approach? \n\nHmm, perhaps the code is trying to track the frequencies of the (sum of elements after the current zero up to each position). \n\nLet me think of the code's variables again. \n\nInside the inner loop, for each element in the segment (starting from the current zero's position), the code is adding some values to the HashMap. \n\nSuppose that for each position in the segment, the code is tracking the sum of elements from the current zero's position to that position. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is doing the following: \n\nInitialize a temporary sum (temp_sum) to 0. \n\nThen, for each element in the segment (starting from the current zero's position), add the element's value to temp_sum, and record the frequency of temp_sum in the HashMap. \n\nWait, but the current zero can be set to any value, so perhaps the code is trying to compute the possible contributions of the non-zero elements in the segment. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to compute the possible values of (sum_after) where sum_after is the sum of the elements after the current zero (excluding the current zero's value). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the possible prefix sums of the elements after the current zero (excluding the current zero's contribution). \n\nLet me think of the first example's segment: \n\nThe elements after the current zero (index1) are 1, -1, 0 (but the next zero is at index4, so the segment is up to index3). \n\nWait, the elements in the segment are 0 (the current zero), 1, -1. \n\nThe code's inner loop processes these elements. \n\nThe code's variables: \n\nsum_before is the sum before the current zero (2). \n\nThe code initializes a temporary sum (maybe starting at 0?), and for each element in the segment, adds their values to this temporary sum, and tracks the frequencies. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is doing this: \n\nThe current zero can be set to x. \n\nThe total sum after the current zero is sum_before +x. \n\nThen, the next elements contribute their values. \n\nThe total prefix sum after each element is (sum_before +x) + a_{i+1} + ... \n\nTo have this be zero at some point, the sum (sum_before +x) + (sum of elements up to that point) must be zero. \n\nThe sum of elements from the current zero's position to that point is (x) + (a_{i+1} + ...). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the sum of the elements from the current zero's position to each position in the segment. \n\nLet me think of the code's inner loop: \n\nInside the inner loop, for each element in the segment (starting from the current zero's position), the code is adding their values to a temporary sum, and storing the frequencies of these sums. \n\nFor example, in the first example's segment: \n\nThe elements are 0 (current zero), 1, -1. \n\nThe temporary sum starts at 0. \n\nFirst element (0): add to temp_sum \u2192 0. \n\nSecond element (1): temp_sum becomes 1. \n\nThird element (-1): temp_sum becomes 0. \n\nThe frequencies would be: 0 \u2192 2 times (initial and after third element), 1 \u2192 once. \n\nThe most frequent is 0, with count 2. \n\nThe code then takes the most frequent value (0), and the count is increased by 2. \n\nThe sum is then adjusted by adding (mostFreq - sum_before) ? \n\nWait, the code does: \n\ncount += hm.get(mostFreq); \n\nsum += -1 * mostFreq; \n\nHmm, the mostFreq is initialized to sum (which is 2 in the first example). \n\nWait, in the first example's case, the mostFreq would be the key with the highest frequency in the map. \n\nThe map's entries are: \n\n0 \u2192 2 \n\n1 \u21921 \n\nSo the mostFreq would be 0. \n\nThen, count +=2 \u2192 which would add 2 to the count. \n\nBut in the first example, the total count is 3. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the best possible contribution from this segment. \n\nThe mostFreq is the value that occurs most frequently in the prefix sums of the segment. \n\nBy setting the current zero's value to (mostFreq - sum_before), the initial sum after the current zero would be sum_before + (mostFreq - sum_before) = mostFreq. \n\nThen, the subsequent elements' contributions would be such that the total prefix sums would be mostFreq plus their cumulative sums. \n\nThe number of times this reaches zero would be the number of times the cumulative sum of the segment's elements equals -mostFreq. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to find the value of mostFreq such that the number of times the cumulative sum of the segment's elements equals ( - (sum_before + x) ), where x is the chosen value for the current zero. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the best possible value for the current zero such that the number of times the prefix sum reaches zero in the current segment is maximized. \n\nThe maximum possible is the frequency of the most frequent value in the prefix sums of the segment's elements (excluding the current zero's contribution). \n\nThe code's approach is to track these frequencies and choose the most frequent one. \n\nThe count is then increased by the frequency of that value. \n\nThe sum is then adjusted to the mostFreq value. \n\nWait, in the first example: \n\nThe mostFreq is 0 (frequency 2). \n\nThe count increases by 2. \n\nBut the total count in the example is 3. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's an initial count from the current zero's contribution. \n\nAlternatively, the code's initial count is sum_before + x = mostFreq. \n\nThe number of times the prefix sum reaches zero in the segment is the number of times the cumulative sum of the segment's elements (excluding the current zero) equals -mostFreq. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to compute the number of times the cumulative sum of the elements after the current zero equals ( - (sum_before + x) ), where x is chosen to be (mostFreq - sum_before). \n\nThis would mean that the total prefix sum would be zero at those points. \n\nThe number of such points is the frequency of ( - (sum_before + x) ) in the cumulative sums of the segment's elements. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is trying to compute the maximum possible contribution from this segment. \n\nThe most frequent value in the prefix sums of the segment's elements (excluding the current zero) is the best candidate to set the current zero's value such that the number of zeros in the prefix sums is maximized. \n\nThe count is increased by the frequency of that value. \n\nThe sum is then set to mostFreq. \n\nIn the first example, the mostFreq is 0 (frequency 2). \n\nThe count increases by 2. \n\nBut the total count is 3. \n\nHmm, perhaps the initial zero's contribution is also counted. \n\nWait, the current zero is set to x = mostFreq - sum_before. \n\nIn the first example, mostFreq is 0, sum_before is 2 \u2192 x = -2. \n\nThe prefix sum after the current zero is 0. \n\nThis contributes 1 to the count. \n\nThen, the subsequent elements' cumulative sums are 1 and 0. \n\nThe cumulative sums after the current zero's position are: \n\n0 (after the current zero), \n\n0+1=1 (after first element), \n\n1-1=0 (after second element). \n\nSo the zeros are at the current zero's position and after the second element. \n\nThat's two zeros. \n\nBut the example's count from this segment is 2 (the current zero's contribution and the second element's contribution). \n\nBut the total count also includes the fifth element's contribution. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's approach is correct but the initial code has some errors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code's approach is correct but the inner loop is not implemented properly. \n\nThe problem is to fill in the missing code inside the while loop. \n\nThe code's inner loop is: \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n} \n\nInside this loop, the code needs to process each element in the segment. \n\nThe goal is to track the prefix sums of the elements in the segment (excluding the current zero's contribution?), and store their frequencies in the HashMap. \n\nPerhaps the code should do the following inside the loop: \n\nInitialize a temporary sum (temp) to 0. \n\nFor each element in the segment: \n\n   temp += element's value \n\n   add this temp to the map's frequency count. \n\nWait, but the current zero can be set to any value, so the initial contribution is variable. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero (excluding the current zero's value). \n\nThe current zero's value is to be chosen such that the initial sum after it is set to a certain value. \n\nThe cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero are added to this initial value. \n\nThe number of times this total reaches zero is the number of times the cumulative sum of the elements equals the negative of the initial value. \n\nTo maximize this, we choose the initial value such that the number of times the cumulative sum equals -initial is maximized. \n\nThe optimal initial value is the one that occurs most frequently in the negative of the cumulative sums. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is trying to track the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero (excluding the current zero's value). \n\nLet me think of the first example's segment: \n\nThe elements after the current zero (index1) are 1, -1. \n\nThe cumulative sums are 1, 0. \n\nThe frequencies of these sums are 1 and 1. \n\nThe most frequent is 0 and 1 each have frequency 1. \n\nHmm, but the code's approach would choose the most frequent value. \n\nAlternatively, the code is tracking the cumulative sums of the elements in the segment (including the current zero's value, but since it can be set to any value, perhaps the code is tracking the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nWait, perhaps the code is doing the following: \n\nThe current zero is at position index. \n\nThe segment includes this zero and all non-zero elements until the next zero. \n\nThe code is trying to compute the possible prefix sums of the elements in this segment, excluding the current zero's contribution. \n\nThe current zero can be set to any value x. \n\nThe total prefix sum after the current zero is sum_before +x. \n\nThe subsequent elements contribute their values to this sum. \n\nThe total prefix sum after each element in the segment is: \n\nsum_before +x + a_{index+1} \n\nsum_before +x + a_{index+1} + a_{index+2} \n\nand so on. \n\nTo have these sums be zero, we need: \n\nsum_before +x + (sum of elements up to that point) =0 \n\n=> x = - (sum_before + (sum of elements up to that point)) \n\nThe number of such x's that can be chosen to make this true for multiple points is the number of times the same value of (sum_before + (sum of elements up to that point)) occurs. \n\nThe optimal x is the one that occurs most frequently. \n\nThe maximum number of zeros in this segment is the frequency of the most frequent value. \n\nThus, the code's approach is to track the frequencies of (sum_before + (sum of elements up to each point in the segment)). \n\nThe most frequent value among these is the best candidate for x. \n\nThe count is increased by the frequency of this value. \n\nThe sum is then set to (sum_before + x) + (sum of all elements in the segment) \n\nWait, perhaps the code is doing this: \n\nThe code tracks the cumulative sums of the elements in the segment (excluding the current zero's value). \n\nFor each position in the segment (starting from the current zero's position), the cumulative sum is the sum of elements from the current zero's position to that position. \n\nThe code then tracks the frequencies of these cumulative sums. \n\nThe most frequent cumulative sum is the best candidate. \n\nThe optimal x is chosen such that sum_before +x = - (cumulative_sum at some point). \n\nThe maximum number of zeros is the frequency of the most frequent cumulative sum. \n\nThe count is increased by this frequency. \n\nThe sum is then updated to sum_before +x + (sum of all elements in the segment). \n\nWait, perhaps the code is doing the following steps: \n\n1. For the current segment (starting at current zero), compute the cumulative sums of the elements in the segment (excluding the current zero's value, since it can be set to x). \n\n2. The cumulative sums are stored in the HashMap. \n\n3. The most frequent cumulative sum is found. \n\n4. The optimal x is chosen such that sum_before +x = - (most_freq_cumulative_sum). \n\n5. The number of times this cumulative sum occurs is added to the count. \n\n6. The new sum after processing the segment is sum_before +x + (sum of all elements in the segment). \n\nThis way, the total contribution to the count is the frequency of the most frequent cumulative sum. \n\nThe sum is then updated to the new value. \n\nIn the first example's segment: \n\nThe elements in the segment are 0 (current zero), 1, -1. \n\nThe cumulative sums (excluding the current zero's value) are: \n\nAfter first element (0): 0 \n\nAfter second element (1): 1 \n\nAfter third element (-1): 0 \n\nThe cumulative sums are 0, 1, 0. \n\nThe frequencies are 0:2, 1:1. \n\nThe most frequent is 0. \n\nThe optimal x is chosen such that sum_before +x = -0 \u2192 x = -2 (since sum_before is 2). \n\nThe count increases by 2. \n\nThe new sum after processing the segment is sum_before +x + (0+1-1) = 2-2 +0 =0. \n\nThen, the next elements are processed. \n\nThe fifth element is a zero, which will be processed in the next iteration. \n\nThis would contribute another count of 1 (since setting it to 0 would make the prefix sum zero again). \n\nThus, the total count would be 2 (from this segment) plus 1 (from the fifth zero) \u2192 3, which matches the example. \n\nThis seems to work. \n\nSo the code's inner loop needs to compute the cumulative sums of the elements in the segment (excluding the current zero's value) and track their frequencies. \n\nThe code's variables: \n\nThe inner loop is processing elements from index2 (starting at the current zero's position) until the next zero or end of array. \n\nInside the loop, for each element in the segment: \n\n- The element's value is added to a temporary sum (temp). \n\n- The temp is stored in the HashMap's frequency count. \n\nWait, but the current zero's value is part of the segment. \n\nWait, the first element in the segment is the current zero (lst.get(index2) is zero). \n\nBut the code's inner loop includes this element. \n\nSo the cumulative sum starts at 0 (the current zero's value), then adds the next elements. \n\nBut the current zero's value is to be set to x, so the cumulative sums should be computed without the current zero's contribution. \n\nWait, no. The cumulative sums are computed as the sum of the elements from the current zero's position onward, but the current zero's value is to be set to x. \n\nThus, the cumulative sums should be computed as the sum of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should start the cumulative sum after the current zero's position. \n\nWait, the current zero is at index2. \n\nThe first element in the segment is the current zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum for the current zero's position is 0 (since it's the first element). \n\nBut the current zero's value is to be set to x, so the cumulative sum after the current zero is x. \n\nThe next elements' cumulative sums are x + a_{index2+1}, etc. \n\nThe cumulative sums we need to track are the sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nWait, perhaps the code should compute the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThe current zero's value is to be set to x, so the cumulative sums are: \n\nx + a_{index2+1} \n\nx + a_{index2+1} + a_{index2+2} \n\nand so on. \n\nTo find the optimal x, we need to choose x such that the number of times this cumulative sum equals - (sum_before + x) is maximized. \n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code's inner loop should compute the cumulative sums of the elements in the segment (excluding the current zero's value), and store them in the map. \n\nThe code's inner loop should do something like this: \n\nlong temp =0; \n\nwhile (condition) { \n\n   int val = lst.get(index2); \n\n   temp += val; \n\n   hm.put(temp, hm.getOrDefault(temp,0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nWait, but the current zero's value is part of the segment. \n\nThe cumulative sums would include the current zero's value (which is to be set to x). \n\nBut since x can be any value, the code is trying to find the best x such that the number of times the cumulative sum (including x) reaches a certain value is maximized. \n\nAlternatively, the code is trying to track the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThe current zero's value is to be set to x, so the cumulative sums are: \n\nx + a_{index2+1} \n\nx + a_{index2+1} + a_{index2+2} \n\netc. \n\nThe optimal x is chosen such that the number of times this equals zero is maximized. \n\nTo find this, we can look for the value of ( - (sum of elements up to each point) ) that occurs most frequently. \n\nThe code's approach is to track the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThe cumulative sums are computed as follows: \n\nLet s_i be the sum of elements from index2+1 to i. \n\nThe optimal x is chosen such that x = -s_i for some i. \n\nThe number of such occurrences is the frequency of s_i. \n\nThe maximum frequency among all s_i is the best choice. \n\nThus, the code should compute the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position and track their frequencies. \n\nThe code's inner loop should process the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nWait, the current zero is at index2. \n\nThe elements after it are from index2+1 to the end of the segment. \n\nThus, the code's inner loop should start by moving past the current zero. \n\nBut the code's initial index2 is set to the current zero's position. \n\nHmm, perhaps the code's inner loop is processing the current zero and the following elements. \n\nThe code's initial setup is: \n\nindex2 = index (the current zero's position). \n\nThe first iteration of the inner loop processes the current zero. \n\nBut the current zero's value is to be set to x, so its contribution is x. \n\nThe cumulative sums should be computed as follows: \n\nThe first element after the current zero is the current zero itself (but its value is x). \n\nThe cumulative sums are: \n\nx (after the current zero), \n\nx + a_{index2+1}, \n\nx + a_{index2+1} + a_{index2+2}, \n\nand so on. \n\nTo find the optimal x, we need to choose x such that the number of times these sums are zero is maximized. \n\nThe number of zeros is the number of times the cumulative sum equals zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum after the current zero is x. \n\nThe cumulative sum after the next element is x + a_{index2+1}. \n\nTo have these be zero, we can set x = - (sum of elements up to that point). \n\nThe optimal x is the one that maximizes the number of such occurrences. \n\nThe best x is the one that is the negative of the most frequent cumulative sum of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThe cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position are computed as follows: \n\nLet's define the elements after the current zero's position as a list: \n\nelements = [a_{index2+1}, a_{index2+2}, ..., a_{end}]. \n\nThe cumulative sums of these elements are: \n\ns_0 =0 \n\ns_1 = a_{index2+1} \n\ns_2 = a_{index2+1} + a_{index2+2} \n\n... \n\ns_k = sum of first k elements. \n\nThe optimal x is chosen such that the number of times x = -s_i is maximized. \n\nThe number of such occurrences is the frequency of s_i. \n\nThe maximum frequency among all s_i is the best choice. \n\nThus, the code should compute the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position and track their frequencies. \n\nThe code's inner loop should process these elements and compute the cumulative sums. \n\nThe current zero's position is index2. \n\nThe elements to process are from index2+1 to the end of the segment. \n\nThus, the code's inner loop should start by moving past the current zero. \n\nBut the code's initial setup is: \n\nindex2 = index (current zero's position). \n\nThe first iteration of the inner loop will process the current zero. \n\nBut the current zero's value is to be set to x, so its contribution is x. \n\nThe cumulative sums should start after the current zero. \n\nThus, the code's inner loop should process the elements starting from index2+1. \n\nBut the code's current setup is not doing that. \n\nPerhaps the code's inner loop is incorrect and needs to be adjusted. \n\nAlternatively, the code's inner loop is processing the current zero and the following elements, but the cumulative sums are computed as follows: \n\ntemp starts at 0. \n\nFor each element in the segment (including the current zero), add its value to temp and store in the map. \n\nBut the current zero's value is to be set to x, so the cumulative sums would be: \n\nx (current zero's contribution) \n\nx + a_{index2+1} \n\nx + a_{index2+1} + a_{index2+2} \n\netc. \n\nThe cumulative sums we need to track are the sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThus, the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position are the s_i values. \n\nThe code should compute these s_i values and track their frequencies. \n\nThe code's inner loop should process the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThus, the code's inner loop should start by moving past the current zero. \n\nBut the code's initial index2 is set to the current zero's position. \n\nPerhaps the code should start by incrementing index2 to the next element. \n\nAlternatively, the code's inner loop is processing the current zero and the following elements, but the current zero's value is not part of the cumulative sums. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the correct code for the inner loop is: \n\nInside the while loop: \n\nlong temp =0; \n\nlong currentElement = lst.get(index2); \n\ntemp += currentElement; \n\nhm.put(temp, hm.getOrDefault(temp, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nWait, but this would include the current zero's value. \n\nAlternatively, the code should compute the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThus, the first element to process is index2+1. \n\nThe code's inner loop should start by moving past the current zero. \n\nBut the code's initial index2 is the current zero's position. \n\nPerhaps the code should first increment index2 to the next element. \n\nAlternatively, the code's inner loop is processing the current zero and the following elements, but the current zero's value is not part of the cumulative sums. \n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct code for the missing part is: \n\nInside the while loop: \n\nlong currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\nsumTemp += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(sumTemp, hm.getOrDefault(sumTemp, 0L) + 1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nThis way, the cumulative sums are tracked. \n\nThe most frequent sum is the key with the highest count. \n\nThe count is increased by the frequency of this sum. \n\nThe sum is then adjusted to sum + (mostFreq - sum_before) ? \n\nWait, the mostFreq is the most frequent sum in the map. \n\nThe optimal x is chosen such that sum_before +x = - mostFreq. \n\nWait, no. \n\nThe optimal x is chosen such that the number of times the cumulative sum (x + s_i) equals zero is maximized. \n\nThe cumulative sums s_i are the sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThe optimal x is the negative of the most frequent s_i. \n\nThe number of occurrences is the frequency of that s_i. \n\nThus, the count increases by the frequency of the most frequent s_i. \n\nThe new sum after processing the segment is sum_before +x + (sum of all elements in the segment). \n\nThe sum of all elements in the segment is the sum of the elements from the current zero's position to the end of the segment. \n\nWait, the sum of the elements in the segment is the total of the elements from index2 to index2_end. \n\nThe new sum after processing the segment is: \n\nsum_before +x + (sum of elements in the segment) \n\nBut x is chosen as - most_freq_s_i. \n\nThe most_freq_s_i is the most frequent s_i. \n\nThus, the new sum is sum_before - most_freq_s_i + (sum of elements in the segment). \n\nThe sum of elements in the segment is the total of the elements from the current zero's position to the end of the segment. \n\nThe sum of elements in the segment is the last cumulative sum (the total of all elements in the segment). \n\nThus, the new sum is sum_before - most_freq_s_i + total_segment_sum. \n\nBut the total_segment_sum is the sum of the elements in the segment (including the current zero's value, which is part of the segment). \n\nWait, the segment includes the current zero's position. \n\nThe total_segment_sum is the sum of all elements in the segment (including the current zero's value, which is to be set to x). \n\nBut the current zero's value is x, so the total_segment_sum is x + (sum of the other elements in the segment). \n\nThus, the new sum is sum_before +x + (sum of other elements in the segment) \n\n= sum_before + (x + sum of other elements) \n\n= sum_before + total_segment_sum (since x is the current zero's value). \n\nBut the total_segment_sum is the sum of the current zero's value plus the other elements. \n\nBut the current zero's value is x, so the total_segment_sum is x + (sum of other elements). \n\nThus, the new sum is sum_before + total_segment_sum. \n\nBut the total_segment_sum is the sum of the elements in the segment (including the current zero's value). \n\nHowever, the current zero's value is x, which is chosen as - most_freq_s_i. \n\nThe most_freq_s_i is the most frequent s_i, which is the sum of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThe s_i values are the cumulative sums of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThe total of the elements after the current zero's position is the last s_i. \n\nThus, the total_segment_sum is x + (sum of elements after the current zero's position). \n\nThe sum of elements after the current zero's position is the last s_i. \n\nThus, the total_segment_sum = x + s_last. \n\nThe new sum is sum_before + x + s_last. \n\nBut x is chosen as - most_freq_s_i. \n\nThus, the new sum is sum_before - most_freq_s_i + s_last. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nPerhaps the code's approach is correct, and the missing code inside the while loop is: \n\nlong currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\nsumTemp += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(sumTemp, hm.getOrDefault(sumTemp, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nThis way, the cumulative sums are tracked. \n\nThe most frequent sum is the key with the highest count. \n\nThe count is increased by the frequency of this sum. \n\nThe sum is then adjusted to sum + (mostFreq - sum_before) ? \n\nWait, the code has: \n\ncount += hm.get(mostFreq); \n\nsum += -1 * mostFreq; \n\nHmm, perhaps the mostFreq is the most frequent sum in the map. \n\nThe optimal x is chosen such that sum_before +x = - mostFreq. \n\nThus, x = - mostFreq - sum_before. \n\nThe new sum after the current zero is sum_before +x = - mostFreq. \n\nThe subsequent elements' contributions are added to this new sum. \n\nThe total new sum after processing the entire segment is: \n\nnew_sum = (sum_before +x) + (sum of elements after the current zero's position) \n\n= - mostFreq + (sum of elements after the current zero's position) \n\nBut the sum of elements after the current zero's position is the last cumulative sum in the map. \n\nThe last cumulative sum is the total of the elements after the current zero's position. \n\nThus, new_sum = - mostFreq + s_last. \n\nBut the code's adjustment is sum += - mostFreq. \n\nThe initial sum is sum_before. \n\nAfter processing the segment, the new sum is sum_before + ( - mostFreq ). \n\nThis would be the case if the entire segment's contribution is - mostFreq. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nIn any case, the missing code inside the while loop should be processing each element in the segment, accumulating their values into a temporary sum, and storing the frequencies in the HashMap. \n\nThus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nlong currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\nsumTemp += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(sumTemp, hm.getOrDefault(sumTemp, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nWait, but the variables sumTemp and fist are not declared in the given code. \n\nLooking back at the given code: \n\nInside the zero case block: \n\nHashMap<Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>(); \n\nlong mostFreq = sum; \n\nint index2 = index; \n\nboolean fist = true; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n} \n\nThus, the variables available are: \n\nindex2, fist, sum (the current sum before the segment), and the elements in the list. \n\nThe code needs to compute the cumulative sums of the elements in the segment (starting from index2) and track their frequencies. \n\nThe cumulative sum starts at 0, and for each element in the segment, we add its value to the cumulative sum and record it in the map. \n\nWait, but the first element is the current zero. \n\nThe cumulative sum starts at 0. \n\nFor each element in the segment: \n\ncurrentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ncumulative += currentVal; \n\nmap.put(cumulative, ...); \n\nThus, the code inside the loop should be: \n\nlong cumulative = 0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   cumulative += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(cumulative, hm.getOrDefault(cumulative, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nWait, but the cumulative variable is not declared in the given code. \n\nThus, the code must use a variable declared inside the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use a temporary variable declared inside the loop. \n\nBut in the given code, the variables are declared outside. \n\nWait, the code's existing variables are: \n\nsum is the current sum before the segment. \n\nThe code's inner loop needs to compute the cumulative sums of the elements in the segment. \n\nThus, the code inside the loop should be: \n\nlong tempSum = 0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   tempSum += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nBut the variable tempSum is not declared in the given code. \n\nThus, the code must declare it inside the loop. \n\nAlternatively, the code can use a variable declared inside the block. \n\nThe code inside the zero case block has: \n\nHashMap<Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>(); \n\nlong mostFreq = sum; \n\nint index2 = index; \n\nboolean fist = true; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   /* TODO: Your code here */ \n\n} \n\nThus, the code inside the loop can declare a variable tempSum. \n\nBut in Java, variables declared inside the loop are visible in the loop's iterations. \n\nThus, the code inside the loop should be: \n\nlong tempSum = 0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   tempSum += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nWait, but the tempSum is declared inside the while loop's initialization. \n\nWait, no. The code inside the loop must be placed inside the while loop's body. \n\nWait, the code inside the loop must be placed inside the while loop's body. \n\nThus, the code inside the loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\nlong tempSum = 0; \n\n// no, this won't work because tempSum is reinitialized each iteration. \n\nAlternatively, the code should declare tempSum outside the loop. \n\nThus, the code should be: \n\nlong tempSum =0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\n   tempSum += currentVal; \n\n   hm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\n   index2++; \n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nThis way, tempSum is declared outside the loop and accumulates the sum. \n\nThus, the missing code inside the while loop is: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nBut the variable tempSum must be declared outside the loop. \n\nThus, the code should have: \n\nlong tempSum =0;

\n\n   fist = false; \n\n} \n\nBut in the given code, the variables are declared in the outer block. \n\nThus, the code inside the zero case block should declare tempSum before the loop. \n\nThe existing code has: \n\nHashMap<Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>(); \n\nlong mostFreq = sum; \n\nint index2 = index; \n\nboolean fist = true; \n\n// declare tempSum here \n\nlong tempSum =0; \n\nwhile (fist || (index2 < arrSz && lst.get(index2)!=0)) { \n\n   int currentVal = lst.get(index2);

\n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nBut the code must be placed inside the while loop's body. \n\nThus, the missing code is: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nBut the variable tempSum must be declared before the loop. \n\nThe code as given in the problem's template does not have this variable declared. \n\nThus, the correct code would involve declaring tempSum before the loop and then the loop's body. \n\nBut since the user's code template has the while loop's body as the TODO section, the code inside the loop must be written there. \n\nThus, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2);

\n\nlong tempSum = 0; \n\n// no, this won't work because it's reinitialized each iteration. \n\nAlternatively, the code must declare tempSum outside the loop. \n\nThe code's existing variables are: \n\nHashMap<Long, Long> hm = new HashMap<>(); \n\nlong mostFreq = sum; \n\nint index2 = index; \n\nboolean fist = true; \n\nThus, the code should add: \n\nlong tempSum =0; \n\nbefore the while loop. \n\nThen, inside the loop: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2); \n\ntempSum += currentVal; \n\nhm.put(tempSum, hm.getOrDefault(tempSum, 0L)+1); \n\nindex2++; \n\nfist = false; \n\nThus, the missing code inside the while loop is the code that increments tempSum and updates the map. \n\nTherefore, the code inside the while loop should be: \n\nint currentVal = lst.get(index2);
