So the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2; if (check(n, mid)) {\n\n    upper = mid;\n\n} else {\n\n    lower = mid;\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, using the unsigned shift, but I think division is okay here. Wait, but in Java, when you have (a + b) / 2, it's the same as (a + b) >>1 when a and b are non-negative. Since lower can be -1, but in the first iteration, lower is -1 and upper is n. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose lower is -1 and upper is 5. Then mid would be ( -1 +5 ) /2 = 2. If using (lower + upper) >>1, then -1 in binary is all 1's. Adding 5 (0101) gives 4 (0100) in two's complement? Wait, no. Let me think in terms of binary. Wait, in Java, integers are 32 bits. So -1 is 0xFFFFFFFF. Adding 5 (0x00000005) gives 0xFFFFFFFA.",

So using the right shift would be wrong here when lower is negative. Therefore, the correct way is to use (lower + upper) / 2. So the code must use division. Therefore, the correct code is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\n\nif (check(n, mid)) {\n\n    upper = mid;\n\n} else {\n\n    lower = mid;\n\n} So that's the code to be filled in the TODO section. Wait, but let me think again. The binary search is trying to find the minimal m where check(n, m) is true. Initially, lower is -1 (which is invalid, since m can't be less than 0), and upper is n (the maximum possible). The loop continues while upper - lower >1. Once the loop exits, upper is the minimal m where check is true. Because when the difference is 1, the loop stops, and upper is the minimal possible. Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the code is correct as written. So the missing code is exactly those three lines. Now, I need to output only the missing code as plain text. The user's instruction says to output only the missing code, not the entire program. So the code to be written is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\nif (check(n, mid)) upper = mid;\nelse lower = mid;\n\nWait, but in Java, the if-else can be written in one line each. Alternatively, the code can be written with braces. But the problem says to output the code as is, so perhaps the code is written as:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\nif (check(n, mid)) upper = mid;\nelse lower = mid;\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the ternary operator, but no, better to write the standard if-else. Yes, that's the code.",

Ah! So the 1's removed is (total_ones - (number of 1's in kept substring)). So in the first example, the original string is \"110\". The total_ones is 2. The kept substring is \"0\", which has 0 1's.

But regardless, the code's approach must be correct. The code's approach uses the check function which computes for a given m whether there exists an interval [i,j] such that the number of 0's in the interval is <=m and the number of 1's removed (the sum of the 1's before i and after j) is also <=m. \n\nThe minimal m where this is true is the answer. So the code's approach is correct. Therefore, the missing code is the binary search step as I wrote before. So the code to fill in is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\n\nif (check(n, mid)) upper = mid;\n\nelse lower = mid;\n\nThus, the correct answer is those three lines.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete the Java code provided to solve this problem. Let me read through the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum cost after removing some characters from the beginning and end of a binary string. The cost is the maximum between the number of 0s left and the number of 1s removed. Hmm, right. So the goal is to minimize this maximum value.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The code given seems to be using some kind of binary search, since there's a lower and upper bound being managed with a while loop condition (upper - lower >1). The check function is probably part of that binary search to see if a certain value is feasible.\n\nWait, the code's main method has a loop over test cases. For each string, it converts to a byte array, then computes an array kk which is the prefix sum of 1's. Because '0' becomes 0, '1' becomes 1, so the sum up to index i gives the number of 1's in the first i characters. So kk[i] is the count of 1's in the first i characters (since the array is 1-based? Let me see: for i from 0 to n-1, the loop does kk[i+1] = k += ... So yes, the prefix sum is stored in kk, with kk[0] =0, kk[1] is first character, etc.\n\nThe variables lower and upper are initialized to -1 and n. The loop is trying to find the minimal possible value of something via binary search. The code inside the loop is missing, so I need to fill that part.\n\nThe check function's parameters are n and m. The function returns a boolean indicating whether a certain condition is met with m. The binary search is probably trying to find the smallest possible upper value where check(n, m) is true. Wait, but in the code, after the loop, it prints upper. So the binary search is trying to find the minimal m where check returns true, and upper would be the minimal such m?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the check function is checking if a certain m is possible, and the binary search is looking for the minimal m where it's possible. So the code is trying to find the minimal possible cost, which is the minimal m where check(n, m) is true. So the binary search is between lower and upper, and the loop is adjusting these bounds.\n\nSo the missing code in the while loop is the standard binary search step: compute mid, check if possible, then adjust lower and upper accordingly.\n\nWait, but the current code's while loop is:\n\nwhile (upper - lower >1) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\nprintln(upper);\n\nSo the code is trying to find the minimal upper such that check(n, upper) is true? Or maybe the other way around. Let me think about the check function.\n\nLooking at the check function:\n\nThe check function takes n and m. It loops over i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it tries to find a j such that some condition holds. Then, if a certain condition is met, returns true. The function returns true if there exists an interval [i, j) where the required conditions are met.\n\nWait, let me look at the check function's code:\n\nfor (int i = 0, j = 0; i < n; i++) {\n    if (j < i)\n        j = i;\n    while (j < n && (j + 1 - i) - (kk[j + 1] - kk[i]) <= m)\n        j++;\n    if (kk[i] + (kk[n] - kk[j]) <= m)\n        return true;\n}\n\nHmm, let's parse this. The variables i and j are indices. The loop is over i, and for each i, j starts at the current i (if it was behind). The while loop increments j as long as (j+1 -i) - (number of 1's between i and j) <= m. Wait, the term (j+1 -i) is the length of the substring from i to j (inclusive?), since j -i +1 is the number of characters. The (kk[j+1] - kk[i]) is the number of 1's in that substring. So (length of substring) minus (number of 1's) is the number of 0's in the substring. So the condition (number of 0's) <= m? Because (j+1 -i) - (1's) = 0's. So the while loop is moving j as far as possible such that the number of 0's in the substring s[i..j] is <= m. Wait, but the condition is (0's) <= m? So the while loop is trying to find the maximum j where the 0's in s[i..j] is <= m. Because as long as that holds, we can move j forward.\n\nWait, the condition in the while loop is (j+1 -i) - (kk[j+1] - kk[i]) <= m. So that's the number of 0's in the substring s[i..j] (since the total length is (j -i +1), subtract the number of 1's gives 0's). So the while loop is moving j as far as possible so that the 0's in the substring up to j is <= m. So the maximum j where this holds.\n\nThen, after finding this j, the code checks if (kk[i] + (kk[n] - kk[j])) <= m. Let's see: kk[i] is the number of 1's before i (since the substring from 0 to i-1). The term (kk[n] - kk[j]) is the number of 1's from j to the end. So adding those gives the total number of 1's removed (since we are removing everything before i and after j). Because the kept substring is from i to j (inclusive). So the 1's removed are those before i (kk[i]) and those after j (total 1's up to n is kk[n], so after j is kk[n] - kk[j]). So total 1's removed is kk[i] + (kk[n] - kk[j]). \n\nThe condition here is that this sum (number of 1's removed) is <= m. \n\nSo the check function is trying to see if there exists an interval [i, j] such that:\n\n1. The number of 0's in the substring [i, j] is <= m (since the 0's in the kept substring must be part of the cost's first component, but the cost is the max between the 0's left and the 1's removed. Wait, the cost is the maximum between the number of 0's left (which is exactly the 0's in the substring [i,j]) and the number of 1's removed (which is the sum of 1's before i and after j). \n\nThe check function is trying to see if there exists an interval where the 0's in the substring is <= m, and the 1's removed is also <= m. Because then the maximum of those two would be <= m, so the cost can be at most m. \n\nWait, the check function returns true if such an interval exists. So the check(n, m) is true if there exists a way to choose i and j such that both the 0's in the kept substring and the 1's removed are <= m. Therefore, the minimal possible cost is the smallest m where check(n, m) is true. \n\nTherefore, the binary search is trying to find the minimal m where check(n, m) is true. The initial lower is -1 (impossible, since m can't be negative) and upper is n (the maximum possible cost, since in the worst case, you might have all 0's left, which is n, or all 1's removed, which is n). \n\nSo in the binary search loop, for each test case, we need to perform the binary search between lower and upper. The code's while loop is:\n\nwhile (upper - lower >1) {\n    /* TODO: Your code here */\n}\nprintln(upper);\n\nSo the missing code is the standard binary search step. Let me think: the current variables are lower and upper. We need to compute mid, then check if check(n, mid) is possible. If it is, then we can try to find a smaller m, so set upper = mid. If not, we need to increase lower to mid. \n\nWait, the binary search is looking for the minimal m where check is true. So the loop is between lower and upper. The initial lower is -1 (the smallest possible m that can't be), and upper is n (the maximum possible). \n\nThe standard approach is:\n\nmid = (lower + upper) / 2\n\nif check(mid) is possible, then we can try to find a smaller m, so set upper = mid. Else, set lower = mid.\n\nWait, but in code, the variables are lower and upper. So the code inside the loop would be:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) >>> 1;\n\nif (check(n, mid)) {\n\n    upper = mid;\n\n} else {\n\n    lower = mid;\n\n}\n\nWait, but the check function's parameters are n and m. So in the code, the mid is the m here. \n\nSo the code inside the loop is exactly that. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) >>> 1;\n\nif (check(n, mid)) {\n\n    upper = mid;\n\n} else {\n\n    lower = mid;\n\n}\n\nWait, but in Java, using >>> 1 is a way to avoid overflow, but since n is up to 2e5, and t is 1e4, but the maximum possible m is n, so mid can be up to n. So using (lower + upper)/2 is okay here, but using the unsigned shift is a common way to prevent overflow. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use (lower + upper) / 2. Either way, the code needs to compute mid as the average. \n\nSo the code to fill in is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) >>> 1;\n\nif (check(n, mid)) upper = mid;\n\nelse lower = mid;\n\nWait, but the code must be in the loop. So the code inside the while loop is exactly that. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is those three lines. \n\nWait, but let me check the code structure again. The code in main() for each test case:\n\nAfter computing the prefix sum kk, the code initializes lower = -1, upper = n. Then the while loop runs while upper - lower >1. Inside the loop, compute mid, check, adjust. \n\nYes, so the code should be as I said. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) >> 1;\n\nWait, but the code uses \">>> 1\" for unsigned right shift, but since lower and upper are non-negative (since upper starts at n which is at least 1, and lower starts at -1. Wait, but when lower is -1, adding to upper (which is n) could be a problem. Let me see:\n\nSuppose lower is -1 and upper is 5. Then mid would be ( -1 +5 ) /2 = 2. \n\nBut using (lower + upper) >>1 would be okay here. Because even if lower is negative, the sum can be negative, but in Java, shifting a negative number with >> would preserve the sign. However, since the variables are integers, perhaps using (lower + upper) / 2 is better here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use (lower + upper) >>1. \n\nBut the problem is that when lower is -1 and upper is n (could be up to 2e5), the sum could be up to 2e5 -1, which is manageable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can use (lower + upper) / 2. \n\nBut the code in the problem's template uses \">>> 1\" in the check function's variables. Wait, no, the code given in the problem's code has the check function, but the code to be filled is in the main's loop. \n\nThe code in the problem's code for the check function has variables i and j, but that's not the issue here. \n\nSo the correct code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\n\nif (check(n, mid)) {\n\n    upper = mid;\n\n} else {\n\n    lower = mid;\n\n}\n\nAlternatively, using the unsigned shift, but I think division is okay here. \n\nWait, but in Java, when you have (a + b) / 2, it's the same as (a + b) >>1 when a and b are non-negative. Since lower can be -1, but in the first iteration, lower is -1 and upper is n. \n\nWait, let's see:\n\nSuppose lower is -1 and upper is 5. Then mid would be ( -1 +5 ) /2 = 2. \n\nIf using (lower + upper) >>1, then -1 in binary is all 1's. Adding 5 (0101) gives 4 (0100) in two's complement? Wait, no. Let me think in terms of binary. \n\nWait, in Java, integers are 32 bits. So -1 is 0xFFFFFFFF. Adding 5 (0x00000005) gives 0xFFFFFFFA. Shifting right by 1 would be 0xFFFFFFF5, which is -3 in decimal. That's not correct. \n\nOh right! So using the right shift would be wrong here when lower is negative. \n\nTherefore, the correct way is to use (lower + upper) / 2. \n\nSo the code must use division. \n\nTherefore, the correct code is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\n\nif (check(n, mid)) {\n\n    upper = mid;\n\n} else {\n\n    lower = mid;\n\n}\n\nSo that's the code to be filled in the TODO section. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The binary search is trying to find the minimal m where check(n, m) is true. \n\nInitially, lower is -1 (which is invalid, since m can't be less than 0), and upper is n (the maximum possible). \n\nThe loop continues while upper - lower >1. \n\nOnce the loop exits, upper is the minimal m where check is true. Because when the difference is 1, the loop stops, and upper is the minimal possible. \n\nYes, that makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct as written. \n\nSo the missing code is exactly those three lines. \n\nNow, I need to output only the missing code as plain text. The user's instruction says to output only the missing code, not the entire program. \n\nSo the code to be written is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\nif (check(n, mid)) upper = mid;\nelse lower = mid;\n\nWait, but in Java, the if-else can be written in one line each. Alternatively, the code can be written with braces. But the problem says to output the code as is, so perhaps the code is written as:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\nif (check(n, mid)) upper = mid;\nelse lower = mid;\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code uses the ternary operator, but no, better to write the standard if-else. \n\nYes, that's the code. \n\nWait, but in the code given, the check function is part of the CF1680C class, so when calling check(n, mid), since it's inside the main method, which is an instance method, the 'this' is implied. So the code is okay. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is those three lines. \n\nI think that's it. Let me check the sample input and see if this approach would work. \n\nTake the first sample input from the note: \n\nFirst test case: \"110\" \n\nThe optimal is to remove two from the beginning (so starting at index 2?), and one from the end. The kept substring is \"0\", so 0's left is 1, and the 1's removed are the first two 1's (counted as 2) plus the last character (the 0 is not a 1, so the 1's removed are 2. Wait, the removed 1's are the ones before i and after j. \n\nWait, in the example, the kept substring is \"0\", so i is 2 (since the first two are removed), and j is 2 (so the substring is from 2 to 2). The 1's removed are the ones before i (i=2, so kk[2] is the number of 1's in first two characters, which is 2) plus the ones after j (since j is 2, the substring after j is from 3 to end (length 0), so 0. So total 1's removed is 2. The 0's left is 1. The cost is max(1, 2) = 2? But the note says the cost is 1. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the example says in the first test case, the cost is 1. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the example. \n\nThe first test case example says: \n\nAfter removing two from the beginning (so the string starts at index 2, which is '0'), and one from the end (so the string ends at index 2). So the kept string is \"0\". \n\nThe number of 0's left is 1. The number of 1's removed is the two 1's from the beginning (the first two characters) plus any 1's removed from the end. But the end removal here is one character (the third character is '0', so removing it doesn't remove any 1's. So total 1's removed is 2. \n\nThe cost is the maximum between 1 and 2, which would be 2. But the example says the cost is 1. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, the example says: \n\n\"In the first test case, it's possible to remove two characters from the beginning and one character from the end. Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is 1.\"\n\nWait, how is the number of 1's removed only one? \n\nAh, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: the cost is the maximum of two values: \n\n1. the number of 0's left in the string. \n\n2. the number of 1's removed from the string. \n\nAh! The 1's removed are the total number of 1's that were removed from the original string. \n\nWait, the total 1's in the original string is the total 1's. The 1's left in the kept substring are (number of 1's in the kept substring). So the 1's removed is total_ones - (number of 1's in kept substring). \n\nWait, the problem says: the cost is the maximum between the number of 0's left and the number of 1's removed. \n\nSo the 1's removed is the total number of 1's in the original string minus the number of 1's in the kept substring. \n\nWait, that's a different way to compute it. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\nThe cost is the maximum of: \n\n- the number of 0's left (which is the count of 0's in the kept substring), \n\n- the number of 1's removed (which is the total 1's in the original string minus the 1's in the kept substring). \n\nAh! So the 1's removed is (total_ones - (number of 1's in kept substring)). \n\nSo in the first example, the original string is \"110\". The total_ones is 2. \n\nThe kept substring is \"0\", which has 0 1's. So the 1's removed is 2 -0 =2. \n\nThe 0's left is 1. So the cost is max(1, 2) =2. But the example says the cost is 1. \n\nHmm, that's conflicting. \n\nWait the example says: \n\n\"In the first test case, it's possible to remove two characters from the beginning and one character from the end. Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is 1.\"\n\nWait, how is the number of 1's removed one? \n\nAh, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's description. Let me read again. \n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"The cost of the removal is the maximum of the following two values: \n\nthe number of characters 0 left in the string; \n\nthe number of characters 1 removed from the string.\"\n\nAh! The number of 1's removed is the count of 1's that were removed, not the total 1's minus those left. \n\nSo the 1's removed is the number of 1's in the parts that were removed (the prefix and suffix). \n\nSo in the first example, the kept substring is \"0\". The removed parts are the first two characters (both 1's) and the last character (the third character is 0, but since we removed one from the end, which is the third character (0), so the removed parts are the first two (1's) and the last one (0). \n\nThe 1's removed are the two 1's from the beginning. The 0's removed are the one 0 from the end. \n\nSo the number of 1's removed is 2. \n\nThe 0's left is 1. \n\nThe cost is max(1, 2) =2, but the example says it's 1. \n\nHmm, this is a contradiction. \n\nWait the example says the cost is 1. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nWait the example says: \n\n\"In the first test case, it's possible to remove two characters from the beginning and one character from the end. Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is 1.\"\n\nAh! So the number of 1's removed is 1. \n\nWait how? \n\nThe original string is \"110\". \n\nIf you remove two from the beginning, you remove the first two '1's. Then remove one from the end (the third character, which is '0'). \n\nThe removed 1's are the two from the beginning. So that's two 1's removed. \n\nBut the example says \"only one 1 is deleted\". \n\nHmm, maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is considering the total removed 1's as the number of 1's in the removed parts. \n\nWait, the first two characters are '1's, so removing them removes two 1's. The third character is '0', so removing it removes zero 1's. So total 2. \n\nBut the example says \"only one 1 is deleted\". \n\nThis suggests that perhaps the example is considering the number of 1's removed as the number of 1's in the suffix removed? Or maybe the example is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is considering the first two characters as the prefix removed (two 1's), and the suffix removed is the last character (0). So total 1's removed is 2. \n\nBut the example says \"only one 1 is deleted\". \n\nHmm, this is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is using a different approach. Let me think of another possible way to achieve cost 1. \n\nSuppose we remove the first character (1), and the last two (the second '1' and the '0'). \n\nThen the kept substring is the second character (the '1'). \n\nThe 0's left is 0. The 1's removed are the first '1' (removed from prefix) and the second '1' (removed from suffix). So total 2 1's removed. The cost is max(0, 2) =2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is considering removing the first two characters (the two 1's) and the last character (the 0). The kept substring is empty. \n\nThen the 0's left is 0, and the 1's removed are the two 1's. The cost is max(0, 2) =2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is considering removing the first character (1) and the last two (the second '1' and the '0'). The kept substring is the second '1'. \n\nThen the 0's left is 0, the 1's removed are the first and third (but third is 0?), no. \n\nWait, maybe the example is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's cost is the maximum between the number of 0's left and the number of 1's left. \n\nWait, that would make sense for the first example. \n\nWait the problem says: \n\n\"the number of characters 1 removed from the string\". \n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the 1's removed is the number of 1's that were removed, not the count of 1's in the removed parts. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of characters 1 removed from the string\". So yes, exactly the count of 1's in the removed parts. \n\nSo in the first example, the removed parts are the first two 1's and the last 0. So the 1's removed are 2. \n\nThe example says the cost is 1. So that's conflicting. \n\nHmm, perhaps the example is considering removing two from the beginning and one from the end, but the kept substring is the third character (the 0). \n\nWait, the first two are removed (the first two 1's), and the last character (the third, which is 0) is removed. So the kept substring is empty. \n\nThen the 0's left is 0, and the 1's removed are the two 1's. The cost is max(0, 2) =2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the example is considering removing two from the beginning (the first two 1's) and zero from the end. The kept substring is the third character (0). \n\nThen the 1's removed are the two 1's (from the prefix), and the 0's left is 1. The cost is max(1, 2) =2. \n\nBut the example says the cost is 1. \n\nThis is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is wrong, but that's unlikely. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's description. Let me re-read the problem statement. \n\nProblem statement: \n\nThe cost is the maximum of two values: \n\n1. the number of 0's left in the string. \n\n2. the number of 1's removed from the string. \n\nAh! The second value is the number of 1's removed from the string. \n\nSo the 1's removed is the count of 1's in the removed parts (prefix and suffix). \n\nSo in the first example, the example says that the cost is 1. \n\nThe example says: \n\n\"Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is 1.\"\n\nAh! So the number of 1's removed is 1. \n\nSo how is that possible? \n\nAh, perhaps the example is removing the first character (1) and the last two characters (the second 1 and the 0). \n\nThe kept substring is the second character (1). \n\nThe 0's left is 0. \n\nThe 1's removed are the first and third (but third is 0?), no. \n\nWait, the second character is the second '1'. \n\nThe removed parts are the first character (1) and the last two (the second '1' and the 0). \n\nWait, the suffix removal is the last two characters? \n\nWait the example says \"remove two characters from the beginning and one from the end\". \n\nAh, two from beginning (first two characters: two 1's), and one from the end (third character, which is 0). \n\nThe kept substring is the second character (the second '1')? No, because removing two from the beginning leaves the third character (0), but then removing one from the end (the third character) leaves nothing. \n\nWait, the kept substring is empty. \n\nThen the 0's left is 0, and the 1's removed are the two 1's. \n\nCost is max(0, 2) =2. \n\nHmm, this is conflicting with the example's explanation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is considering removing one from the beginning and one from the end. \n\nThe kept substring is the middle '1'. \n\nThe 0's left is 0. \n\nThe 1's removed are the first and third (but third is 0?), no. \n\nWait, the third character is 0. \n\nSo removing one from the beginning (the first '1') and one from the end (the third '0'). \n\nThe kept substring is the second '1'. \n\nThe 1's removed are the first '1' (from prefix) and the third character (0, so no 1's there). So total 1 removed. \n\nThe 0's left is 0. \n\nThe cost is max(0,1) =1. \n\nAh! That's the case. \n\nAh, I see! The example says \"remove two characters from the beginning and one from the end\". \n\nWait, two from beginning and one from end: \n\nOriginal string is \"110\" (indices 0,1,2). \n\nRemoving two from beginning: removes indices 0 and 1 (the two '1's). \n\nRemoving one from end: removes index 2 (the '0'). \n\nThe kept substring is empty. \n\nBut that gives cost max(0, 2) =2. \n\nBut the example says the cost is 1. \n\nAh, perhaps the example is removing one from the beginning and one from the end. \n\nThen the kept substring is the middle '1'. \n\nThe 1's removed are the first '1' (from prefix) and the third character (0, so no 1's there). So total 1 removed. \n\nThe 0's left is 0. \n\nCost is max(0,1) =1. \n\nAh, so the example's description must have a typo. It says \"remove two from beginning and one from end\", but perhaps it's one from beginning and one from end. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating. \n\nWait the example says: \n\n\"Only one 1 is deleted, only one 0 remains, so the cost is 1.\"\n\nAh, the 0's left is one. \n\nSo the kept substring must have one 0. \n\nSo the kept substring is the third character (0). \n\nTo get that, you remove the first two characters (the two 1's) from the beginning, and remove zero from the end. \n\nThen the kept substring is the third character (0). \n\nThe 1's removed are the two 1's (from the prefix). \n\nThe 0's left is 1. \n\nCost is max(1, 2) =2. \n\nHmm, but the example says the cost is 1. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is considering the number of 1's removed as the number of 1's in the removed suffix. \n\nWait, maybe the problem's description is different. \n\nWait the problem says: \n\n\"the number of characters 1 removed from the string\". \n\nSo it's the total number of 1's in the removed parts (prefix and suffix). \n\nSo in the first example, the example's explanation says that the number of 1's removed is one. \n\nSo how can that be? \n\nAh, perhaps the example is removing the first character (1) from the beginning, and the last two characters (the second '1' and the '0'). \n\nThe kept substring is the second '1'. \n\nThe 1's removed are the first '1' (from prefix) and the second '1' (from suffix). \n\nTotal 2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the example is removing the first character (1) and the last character (0). \n\nThe kept substring is the second '1'. \n\nThe 1's removed is 1 (the first '1'). \n\nThe 0's left is 0. \n\nCost is max(0,1) =1. \n\nAh! That's the case. \n\nAh, so the example's description says \"remove two characters from the beginning and one from the end\". \n\nWait, two from beginning would be first two characters (two 1's), and one from end (third character, 0). \n\nBut that leaves nothing. \n\nBut if you remove one from beginning and one from end, then the kept substring is the middle '1'. \n\nThe example's description must have a mistake in the numbers. \n\nBut regardless, the code's approach must be correct. \n\nThe code's approach uses the check function which computes for a given m whether there exists an interval [i,j] such that the number of 0's in the interval is <=m and the number of 1's removed (the sum of the 1's before i and after j) is also <=m. \n\nThe minimal m where this is true is the answer. \n\nSo the code's approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, the missing code is the binary search step as I wrote before. \n\nSo the code to fill in is:\n\nint mid = (lower + upper) / 2;\n\nif (check(n, mid)) upper = mid;\n\nelse lower = mid;\n\nThus, the correct answer is those three lines."
