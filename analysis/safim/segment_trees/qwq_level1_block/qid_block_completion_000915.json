Let me think through the problem again. The problem says that each stamp application must color two adjacent cells, one red and the other blue. The stamp can be rotated, so either BR or RB. Also, the stamp can be applied multiple times, and each time it covers exactly two cells. The initial state is all white, and each stamp application changes both cells under it. The key is to check if the target string can be achieved through any number of such operations. Hmm, the code provided splits the input string into parts separated by 'W's. Wait, questArr.split(\"W\") would split the string into segments between W's.",

    "original_reasoning": "Okay, I need to figure out how to complete this Java code so that it correctly determines whether a given string can be formed using the stamp. Let me think through the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that each stamp application must color two adjacent cells, one red and the other blue. The stamp can be rotated, so either BR or RB. Also, the stamp can be applied multiple times, and each time it covers exactly two cells. The initial state is all white, and each stamp application changes both cells under it. The key is to check if the target string can be achieved through any number of such operations.\n\nHmm, the code provided splits the input string into parts separated by 'W's. Wait, questArr.split(\"W\") would split the string into segments between W's. For example, if the string is \"BRWBR\", splitting on W gives [\"BR\", \"BR\"], but if there are multiple Ws, like \"BRWWB\", then it would split into [\"BR\", \"B\"], right?\n\nBut the approach here might be to check each non-W segment. Because any non-W parts must be formed by the stamps. Since the stamps can only affect two cells at a time, maybe each non-W segment must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nWait, the code currently checks each chunk in questList (the split parts) and looks if the chunk contains B XOR R. That is, if the chunk has either B or R but not both. Because if a chunk has both, then maybe that's okay? Or maybe not?\n\nWait, the problem is that each stamp application creates a pair of R and B. So any non-W segment must have an even number of non-W characters? Or maybe not exactly, but the arrangement must follow some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that in any non-W segment, every character must be part of a pair of R and B. But since the stamps can be applied multiple times, overlapping, maybe the actual condition is that in any non-W segment, the characters must alternate between R and B in some way, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think of the possible patterns. Each stamp application adds either RB or BR to two adjacent cells. But since you can apply the stamp multiple times, overlapping, the final colors depend on the number of times each cell was stamped. Each time a cell is under a stamp, its color flips from white to either R or B, but subsequent stamps would change it again. Wait, no, the problem says each usage of the stamp recolors both cells under it. So each time you stamp, those two cells are set to either R and B or B and R, regardless of their previous state. So the order of stamping matters, but perhaps the final configuration must satisfy some constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that in the final string, any two adjacent non-W cells must form a valid pair (either RB or BR), but that's not necessarily true because overlapping stamps can interfere. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of examples.\n\nTake the example given in the problem: the target is B R B B W. Wait, the example's final string is B R B B W. Let's see how that was formed. The steps were:\n\nStart with WWWWW.\n\nFirst stamp at positions 4-5: becomes R B, so the string becomes WWWRB W (but the fifth is W? Wait the example shows the steps as:\n\nFirst step: WWWW followed by RB (positions 4-5?), then next step applies stamp at 0-1 (assuming 0-based?), making BR there, so the first two are BR, then third is R (from previous?), etc. Hmm, maybe the exact steps aren't crucial here.\n\nThe main point is that the code's current approach is splitting on W's and checking each non-W segment. The code currently checks if a chunk has either B or R but not both. If that's the case, then it's invalid. Because, for example, a segment like \"BB\" can't be formed because each stamp must have one R and one B. So if a segment has only B's, that's impossible. Similarly for only R's.\n\nWait, but the code's current condition is if (chkStr contains B XOR contains R). So if a chunk has both B and R, then the condition is false, so the code proceeds. But if the chunk has only B or only R, then the condition is true, which would trigger the TODO part. So in that case, the code should set isColorful to \"NO\".\n\nSo the first part of the condition is correct. But maybe there's more to check.\n\nWait, let's think of another case. Suppose the string is \"BRB\". Split on W gives [\"BRB\"]. This chunk has both B and R. But can this be formed?\n\nLet me see. Let's see possible steps. The initial is WWW.\n\nSuppose first stamp at positions 0-1: BR, so the string becomes BRW.\n\nThen stamp at positions 1-2: let's choose RB (so the second and third become R and B). So after that, the string would be B (from first), then R (from first stamp) and then B (from second stamp's second position). Wait, the second stamp would overwrite the second cell. Let's see:\n\nFirst stamp: positions 0-1 \u2192 BRW \u2192 \"BRW\".\n\nSecond stamp on positions 1-2: choosing RB (so the second becomes R and third B?), but the existing second was R. So after stamping, the second becomes R (since the stamp's first is R?), or B? Wait, the stamp can be either BR or RB. So when you apply the stamp on positions 1-2, you can choose either BR or RB. Let's say you choose RB. Then the second cell (position 1) becomes R, and third (position 2) becomes B. But the existing second was already R, so it stays R. So the result is BRB. So that works. So the chunk \"BRB\" is okay.\n\nAnother example: \"BRRB\". Let's see. Split on W gives [\"BRRB\"]. This has both B and R. But can this be formed?\n\nHmm, let's see. Let's think of possible steps. Maybe not. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the target is B R R B. Let's see:\n\nSuppose first stamp at 0-1: BR \u2192 BRWW (assuming n=4). Then another stamp at 1-2 as RB \u2192 so positions 1 becomes R, 2 becomes B. So after that, the string is B (0), R (1), B (2), W (3). Then another stamp at 2-3 as RB \u2192 making B and R. So the third becomes B (overwritten?), no. Wait, each stamp must set both cells. So after the first two steps, the string is BRBW. Then stamping at 2-3 as RB would set position 2 to R and 3 to B? Or wait, the stamp can be either BR or RB. So if you choose RB for positions 2-3, then position 2 becomes R and 3 becomes B. So the string would be B R (position1), R (position2), B (position3). So the string is BRRB. So that works. So that's possible. So the code's current check (checking that each chunk has both B and R) is not sufficient. Because in this case, the chunk has both, but maybe there's another condition.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that in the chunk, every pair of adjacent characters must form either BR or RB. Because each stamp affects two adjacent cells, but overlapping stamps can interfere. Wait, perhaps the key is that in the final string, every pair of adjacent non-W characters must be either BR or RB. Because any stamp application affects two adjacent cells, so the final colors must be such that any two adjacent non-W cells form a valid pair. Because otherwise, there's a place where two adjacent cells are not BR or RB, which can't be achieved by the stamps.\n\nWait, let's think of the example \"BRRB\". The adjacent pairs are BR, RR, RB. The RR is invalid. So that would not be allowed. But in the scenario I thought of earlier, the final string would have B R R B. The middle RR is invalid. But according to my previous steps, that's possible? Wait, no, because in the steps I described, after the first two steps, the string is BRBW. Then applying the stamp on positions 2-3 as RB would set position2 to R and 3 to B. So the string becomes B R (position1), R (position2), B (position3). So the middle is R and R? Wait, no. Wait, the second stamp (positions 1-2) was applied as RB, so position1 was already R (from first stamp), and the second stamp on 1-2 as RB would set position1 to R and position2 to B? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nFirst stamp on 0-1: BR \u2192 positions 0 is B, 1 is R.\n\nSecond stamp on 1-2 as RB (so the first part of the stamp is R, second B). So position1 becomes R (overwriting the previous R?), and position2 becomes B. So after that, the string is B (0), R (1), B (2), W (3).\n\nThird stamp on 2-3 as RB: position2 becomes R, position3 becomes B. So the string becomes B (0), R (1), R (2), B (3). So the middle is R and R. But that's two adjacent R's, which can't be formed by any stamp. Because each stamp must have one R and one B. So how did that happen?\n\nAh, because the third stamp on positions 2-3 as RB would set position2 to R (overwriting the previous B from the second stamp) and position3 to B. So the two adjacent R's (positions1 and 2) are R and R. But that's invalid. So that's a problem. So my previous reasoning was wrong. So that scenario is impossible. So the example \"BRRB\" would not be possible. So the code's current approach would have the chunk \"BRRB\" which contains both B and R, so the first condition (B XOR R) is false, so the code proceeds. But the actual answer would be \"NO\" because of the RR in the middle.\n\nHmm, so the code's current approach is insufficient. So there must be more conditions to check.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach of splitting on W and checking each segment for having both B and R is necessary but not sufficient. We also need to check that in each segment, every pair of adjacent characters is either BR or RB. Because otherwise, there's an invalid pair.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Let me think again. Suppose the segment is \"BRB\". The adjacent pairs are BR and RB, which are both valid. So that's okay. The example I thought of earlier where the segment is \"BRRB\" has an RR pair, which is invalid. So the code must also check that in each non-W segment, every two consecutive characters form either BR or RB.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each non-W segment (split by W's):\n\n1. The segment must contain at least one B and at least one R. (so the current check of (contains B XOR R) being false is part of this, but actually, it's the opposite: if the segment has only B or only R, then it's invalid. So the code's current condition is correct in that if (chkStr contains B XOR contains R) \u2192 then it's invalid. So in that case, we set isColorful to \"NO\".\n\n2. Additionally, every pair of consecutive characters in the segment must be either BR or RB. So for each i from 0 to length-2, check that (s[i], s[i+1]) is either BR or RB.\n\nIf both conditions are met for all segments, then the answer is YES, else NO.\n\nSo the code needs to implement both checks.\n\nThe current code is only doing the first part (checking if the segment has both B and R). The second part is missing.\n\nSo in the code, inside the for loop over each chunk (chkStr):\n\nFirst, check if the chunk has both B and R. If not \u2192 set to NO.\n\nSecond, check that every adjacent pair in the chunk is either BR or RB. If any pair is not, set to NO.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nLet me see the current code:\n\nfor(String chkStr : questList)\n{\n    if(chkStr.contains(\"B\") ^ chkStr.contains(\"R\"))\n    {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n        // this is when the chunk has only B or only R \u2192 set isColorful to NO\n        isColorful = \"NO\";\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // need to check the adjacent pairs\n        for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length()-1; i++) {\n            String pair = chkStr.substring(i, i+2);\n            if (!pair.equals(\"BR\") && !pair.equals(\"RB\")) {\n                isColorful = \"NO\";\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // after checking, if any problem, isColorful is already set to NO\n}\n\nWait, but the code currently has the 'if' condition as (B XOR R). So when that is true, the chunk has only B or only R \u2192 so we set to NO. Else, we proceed to check the pairs.\n\nSo the code needs to add that second loop.\n\nSo the missing code in the TODO is to set isColorful to \"NO\" when the condition is met (i.e., when the chunk has only B or only R). Then, after that, we need to loop through the characters in the chunk and check adjacent pairs.\n\nWait, but in the current code, the 'if' block is only handling the first condition. The second condition (checking pairs) is not present. So the code must add that.\n\nTherefore, the code should be modified as follows:\n\nInside the for loop over each chkStr:\n\nFirst, check if the chunk has only B or only R \u2192 set to NO.\n\nThen, even if it has both, check the adjacent pairs.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nfor(String chkStr : questStrList) { // assuming questList is the list of non-W parts\n    // Check if the chunk has only B or only R\n    boolean hasB = chkStr.contains(\"B\");\n    boolean hasR = chkStr.contains(\"R\");\n    if ( (hasB && !hasR) || (!hasB && hasR) ) { // which is equivalent to (hasB ^ hasR)\n        isColorful = \"NO\";\n        continue; // move to next chunk\n    }\n    // Now check adjacent pairs\n    for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length()-1; i++) {\n        char c1 = chkStr.charAt(i);\n        char c2 = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n        if ( (c1 == 'B' && c2 == 'R') || (c1 == 'R' && c2 == 'B') ) {\n            // valid\n        } else {\n            isColorful = \"NO\";\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (isColorful.equals(\"NO\")) continue; // already failed, skip further checks\n}\n\nWait, but in code, the current code has:\n\nif(chkStr.contains(\"B\") ^ chkStr.contains(\"R\")) \u2192 which is equivalent to (hasB XOR hasR). So that's exactly the condition where the chunk has only B or only R. So in that case, set isColorful to \"NO\".\n\nThen, for the else case (when both are present), we need to check the pairs.\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nfor(String chkStr : questList)\n{\n    if(chkStr.contains(\"B\") ^ chkStr.contains(\"R\"))\n    {\n        isColorful = \"NO\";\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // check adjacent pairs\n        for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length()-1; i++) {\n            char a = chkStr.charAt(i);\n            char b = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n            if ( (a != 'B' || b != 'R') && (a != 'R' || b != 'B') ) {\n                isColorful = \"NO\";\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // after this, if any problem, isColorful is set to NO\n}\n\nWait, but in code, the 'else' block is needed. So the code must first check the first condition, and if it's true, set to NO. Else, proceed to check the pairs.\n\nWait, but in the code's current structure, the 'if' block is only handling the first condition. The second condition is not present. So the code must add the loop for checking pairs in the else case.\n\nSo the code inside the for loop over each chunk would be:\n\nif (chkStr has only B or R \u2192 set to NO)\n\nelse:\n\n   check all adjacent pairs are BR or RB. If any is not \u2192 set to NO.\n\nSo the code needs to implement that.\n\nNow, in Java code:\n\nInside the for loop over each chkStr:\n\nif (chkStr contains B XOR R \u2192 set isColorful to NO.\n\nElse:\n\n   loop over each pair in the chunk.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor(String chkStr : questList) {\n    if (chkStr.contains(\"B\") ^ chkStr.contains(\"R\")) {\n        isColorful = \"NO\";\n    } else {\n        for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length()-1; i++) {\n            char c1 = chkStr.charAt(i);\n            char c2 = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n            if ( (c1 == 'B' && c2 == 'R') || (c1 == 'R' && c2 == 'B') ) {\n                // okay, continue\n            } else {\n                isColorful = \"NO\";\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    // after this, if any problem, isColorful is set to NO\n}\n\nWait, but in the else block, after the for loop, if any of the pairs is invalid, we set isColorful to NO. But after the break, we need to break out of the loop and then set it. Wait, the code inside the loop checks each pair. If any pair is invalid, then set isColorful to NO and break the loop. So that's okay.\n\nBut in the code, after the for loop, we have to make sure that after the loop, if any pair was invalid, the isColorful is set to NO. So the code is okay.\n\nWait, but in the else block, the code starts with assuming that the chunk has both B and R. Then, it checks each pair. If any pair is invalid, then it sets isColorful to NO and breaks. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code needs to add this loop.\n\nNow, the problem is that the current code's 'questList' is obtained by splitting on 'W's. But the split on 'W's may include empty strings. For example, if the string starts with W, then the first element is empty. Or if there are multiple W's in a row, like \"WW\", then the split would have an empty string between them.\n\nWait, the split on \"W\" would split the string into parts separated by W. So for example, \"W\" would split into [\"\", \"\"]. Because the split on a single W would split the string into before and after, which are both empty.\n\nHmm, but in such cases, the empty strings would be part of the questList. So for example, if the input is \"W\", then the split would be [\"\", \"\"]. Each of those empty strings would be processed.\n\nBut for an empty string, the code would check contains B or R \u2192 which is false. So the XOR condition would be (false ^ false) \u2192 false. So the else clause is taken. Then, the loop over the pairs would not run (since length is 0, so length-1 is -1 \u2192 the loop doesn't execute). So the code would leave isColorful as \"YES\".\n\nWhich is correct, because the entire string is all W's. So zero stamps applied \u2192 \"YES\".\n\nAnother example: the input is \"B\". Then the split on W would give [\"B\"], since there are no W's. So the chunk is \"B\". Then, the code checks contains B (yes) and R (no). So the XOR is true \u2192 set to \"NO\".\n\nWhich is correct, because a single B can't be formed by any stamp (since each stamp affects two cells).\n\nAnother example: \"BR\". The split gives [\"BR\"]. The code checks contains B and R \u2192 so the XOR is false. Then, check the pair BR \u2192 which is valid. So \"YES\".\n\nAnother example: \"RB\" \u2192 same as above, valid.\n\nAnother example: \"BRB\" \u2192 split gives [\"BRB\"]. Check contains both. Then check pairs BR and RB \u2192 both valid \u2192 \"YES\".\n\nAnother example: \"BRRB\" \u2192 split gives [\"BRRB\"]. Check contains both. Then check pairs BR, RR, RB. The RR is invalid \u2192 so set to \"NO\".\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, the code in the problem's current code has:\n\nString[] questList = questArr.split(\"W\");\n\nBut in Java, the split on \"W\" will split the string into parts separated by W. So for example, \"WW\" \u2192 split into [\"\", \"\", \"\"]. Wait, no, let me think: \"WW\" \u2192 split on \"W\" gives an array of three elements? Let me see:\n\nThe string \"WW\" split by \"W\" would be:\n\nThe first part is before the first W (empty), then between the two W's (empty), then after the second W (empty). So the result is [\"\", \"\", \"\"]. So each empty string is part of the list.\n\nBut for each empty string in questList, the code would process them. For an empty string, the contains(\"B\") and contains(\"R\") are both false. So the XOR is false \u2192 so the else clause is taken. Then, the loop over pairs (since length is 0 \u2192 no iterations). So the code leaves isColorful as \"YES\".\n\nWhich is correct, because those empty strings correspond to regions of W's, which are allowed.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code's current problem is that the second check (adjacent pairs) is missing. So the missing code is the part where, for each chunk that has both B and R, we check all adjacent pairs are BR or RB.\n\nSo the code inside the for loop over the chunks should be:\n\nInside the else block (when the chunk has both B and R), loop through each pair.\n\nSo the code needs to add that loop.\n\nNow, the code currently has:\n\nfor(String chkStr : questList)\n{\n    if(chkStr.contains(\"B\") ^ chkStr.contains(\"R\"))\n    {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\n\nThe TODO is where the code should set isColorful to \"NO\" when the condition is met. So the first part is already handled by setting isColorful = \"NO\".\n\nThen, the else part (when the condition is false \u2192 has both B and R) needs to check the pairs.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nfor(String chkStr : questList)\n{\n    if(chkStr.contains(\"B\") ^ chkStr.contains(\"R\"))\n    {\n        isColorful = \"NO\";\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Check adjacent pairs\n        for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length() - 1; i++) {\n            char a = chkStr.charAt(i);\n            char b = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n            if ( (a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B') ) {\n                // valid, continue\n            } else {\n                isColorful = \"NO\";\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but in the else block, after the for loop, if any of the pairs is invalid, we set isColorful to \"NO\" and break. But after the loop, we need to check whether we broke out because of an invalid pair. Wait, the code inside the loop breaks the loop, but the isColorful is set to \"NO\" in that case. So after the loop, if any pair was invalid, the isColorful is already \"NO\".\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nNow, the code must be written in Java. So the missing code is the part inside the for loop over the chunks, after the initial if condition.\n\nThe current code has the 'if' condition, but the else part is missing. So the code must add the else block with the loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nelse\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length() - 1; i++) {\n        char a = chkStr.charAt(i);\n        char b = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n        if (!((a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B'))) {\n            isColorful = \"NO\";\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWait, alternatively, the code can check the opposite condition. Let me see:\n\nThe condition for invalid is when the pair is not BR or RB. So:\n\nif ( (a != 'B' || b != 'R') && (a != 'R' || b != 'B') )\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe pair is valid if (a is B and b is R) OR (a is R and b is B). So the invalid condition is when neither of those is true. So:\n\nif ( (a != 'B' || b != 'R') && (a != 'R' || b != 'B') )\n\nWait, that's equivalent to the negation of the OR. Because:\n\nThe valid condition is ( (a == B && b == R) || (a == R && b == B) )\n\nThe invalid is the negation of that \u2192 which is:\n\n!( (a == B && b == R) || (a == R && b == B) )\n\nWhich is equivalent to (a != B || b != R) AND (a != R || b != B) \u2192 no, wait:\n\nWait, De Morgan's law: \n\n\u00ac(A \u2228 B) = \u00acA \u2227 \u00acB \n\nSo the negation of (A || B) is (\u00acA) && (\u00acB).\n\nSo the negation of ( (a==B && b==R) || (a==R && b==B) ) is \n\n\u00ac(a==B && b==R) && \u00ac(a==R && b==B)\n\nWhich is ( (a != B || b != R) ) && ( (a != R || b != B) )\n\nSo that's the condition for invalid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to code the valid condition and invert it.\n\nAlternatively, in code:\n\nif ( (a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B') ) \u2192 valid, so continue.\n\nElse \u2192 invalid \u2192 set to NO and break.\n\nSo the code inside the loop can be written as:\n\nif ( (a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B') ) {\n\n} else {\n\n    isColorful = \"NO\";\n\n    break;\n\n}\n\nSo that's better.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the else block is as I wrote earlier.\n\nSo putting it all together, the missing code is the else block with the for loop.\n\nTherefore, the code inside the for loop over the chunks should be:\n\nif (chkStr contains B XOR R \u2192 set to NO.\n\nElse:\n\n   loop over pairs and check.\n\nSo the code to add is the else block with the for loop.\n\nNow, the code in the problem's current code has the 'if' condition, but the else is missing. So the missing code is the else part.\n\nTherefore, the code to fill in the TODO is:\n\nisColorful = \"NO\";\n\nBut that's only part of it. The else part is needed. Wait, the problem says to output only the missing code. The user's code has:\n\nfor(String chkStr : questList)\n{\n    if(chkStr.contains(\"B\") ^ chkStr.contains(\"R\"))\n    {\n        /* TODO: Your code here */\n    }\n}\n\nThe TODO is inside the if block. Wait, the current code's if block is when the chunk has only B or only R. So in that case, the code should set isColorful to \"NO\".\n\nSo the first part of the missing code is inside the if block: isColorful = \"NO\";\n\nThen, the else part (outside the if) is needed to check the pairs. But the current code doesn't have an else clause. So the code must add an else clause.\n\nWait, the current code's structure is:\n\nfor each chunk:\n\n   if (condition) \u2192 set to NO.\n\n   else \u2192 do nothing? Because the code currently has no else.\n\nSo the code must add the else clause with the loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nisColorful = \"NO\"; // inside the if block.\n\nand then, after the if, an else clause with the loop.\n\nWait, the problem says to output only the missing code. The user's code has the 'if' block with the TODO. So the first missing part is inside the if block: setting isColorful to \"NO\".\n\nThen, the code also needs to add the else block with the loop.\n\nSo the code to add is:\n\nInside the if block:\n\nisColorful = \"NO\";\n\nThen, after the if, add an else block with the loop.\n\nSo the complete code for the for loop over the chunks would be:\n\nfor(String chkStr : questList)\n{\n    if(chkStr.contains(\"B\") ^ chkStr.contains(\"R\"))\n    {\n        isColorful = \"NO\";\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length() - 1; i++) {\n            char a = chkStr.charAt(i);\n            char b = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n            if ( (a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B') ) {\n                // valid\n            } else {\n                isColorful = \"NO\";\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nTherefore, the missing code is the 'isColorful = \"NO\";' inside the if block, and the else block with the loop.\n\nBut the user's code currently has the 'if' block with the TODO. So the first missing part is the 'isColorful = \"NO\";' inside the if block. The second part is the else block with the loop.\n\nTherefore, the code to output is:\n\nisColorful = \"NO\";\n\nfollowed by the else block and the loop.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output only the missing code. The user's code has the 'if' block with the TODO. So the first missing line is inside the if block: isColorful = \"NO\";.\n\nThen, the else block and the loop are also missing. So the code to output is:\n\nisColorful = \"NO\";\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length() - 1; i++) {\n\n        char a = chkStr.charAt(i);\n\n        char b = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n\n        if ( (a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B') ) {\n\n        } else {\n\n            isColorful = \"NO\";\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo the entire missing code is the 'isColorful = \"NO\";' inside the if block, and the else block with the loop.\n\nTherefore, the correct missing code is:\n\nisColorful = \"NO\";\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length() - 1; i++) {\n\n        char a = chkStr.charAt(i);\n\n        char b = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n\n        if ( (a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B') ) {\n\n        } else {\n\n            isColorful = \"NO\";\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but the user's code's current code has the 'if' block with the TODO. So the code inside the if block is to set isColorful to \"NO\".\n\nThen, the else block is needed after the if.\n\nSo the code to fill in the TODO is the first line (isColorful = \"NO\";), and then the else block with the loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is:\n\nisColorful = \"NO\";\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length() - 1; i++) {\n\n        char a = chkStr.charAt(i);\n\n        char b = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n\n        if ( (a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B') ) {\n\n        } else {\n\n            isColorful = \"NO\";\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nSo that's the code to be added.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that this code is correctly formatted as plain text, without markdown.\n\nSo the code to output is:\n\nisColorful = \"NO\";\n\n}\n\nelse {\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < chkStr.length() - 1; i++) {\n\n        char a = chkStr.charAt(i);\n\n        char b = chkStr.charAt(i+1);\n\n        if ( (a == 'B' && b == 'R') || (a == 'R' && b == 'B') ) {\n\n        } else {\n\n            isColorful = \"NO\";\n\n            break;\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nWait, but the user's code's current code has the 'if' block with the TODO. So the code inside the if block is the first line (isColorful = \"NO\";), and then the else block comes after.\n\nTherefore, the missing code is exactly the above.\n\nSo that's the code to output."
