Otherwise, we take the segment [x-y, x-1] -> which is pre[x-1] - (pre[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\n  But note: if x-y==0, then we want from 0 to x-1 -> which is pre[x-1] (and we don't subtract anything). So we can write:\n      if x-y == 0:\n          s = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          s = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a prefix array that has a 0 at the beginning to avoid the if? We can do:\n      pre = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i-1]\n\n      Then the sum from index i to j (inclusive) is pre[j+1] - pre[i]. For the segment [x-y, x-1] (0-indexed) in the descending array:\n          i = x-y, j = x-1 -> so the sum = pre[x] - pre[x-y]   ??? But note: \n          pre[x] = sum of prices[0] to prices[x-1] (because pre is 0-indexed with pre[0]=0, pre[1]=prices[0], pre[2]=prices[0]+prices[1], ...) Then the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) is: \n              pre[x] - pre[x-y]   -> because:\n                  pre[x] = prices[0] + ... + prices[x-1]\n                  pre[x-y] = prices[0] + ... + prices[x-y-1]\n                  subtract -> we get prices[x-y] + ... + prices[x-1] -> which is exactly the segment. Example (3,2): \n          x=3, y=2 -> then we need pre[3] - pre[1] = (5+5+3) - (5) = 13-5=8 -> correct. Example (2,1): \n          x=2, y=1 -> pre[2]-pre[1] = (5+5) - 5 = 5 -> correct.\n\n      Example (5,3): \n          x=5, y=3 -> pre[5]-pre[2] = (5+5+3+2+1) - (5+5) = 16-10=6 -> correct. Therefore, we can do:\n\n      n, q = map(int, input().split())\n      prices = list(map(int, input().split())) prices.sort(reverse=True)   # descending order\n\n      # Precompute prefix sum with an extra 0 at the beginning\n      pre = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i-1]\n\n      for _ in range(q):\n          x, y = map(int, input().split())\n          #",

But note: we also need to initialize the pre array. So we have to add a line before the for loop. Therefore, the missing block for the for loop part is:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n  But wait, the for loop is already written: \"for i in range(1, len(prices)):\". We can use that. So we can do:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      # Then inside the for loop (which runs for i from 1 to n-1) we do:\n      pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i] But then we have to be careful: the for loop is already there. We are only filling the body. So we can write:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i] And then the while loop body we change to:\n\n      x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      if x - y - 1 < 0:\n          total = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n      print(total)\n      q -= 1   # this line is already there? but we output it? But the problem says: the while loop is already there and has:\n\n      while q:\n          # 5 5 3 2 1\n          # 5 10 13 15 16\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n          print(prices[x-1] - l) q -= 1\n\n  We are going to replace the three lines after the comments with our new code. So the missing block for the while loop body is:\n\n      x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      if x - y - 1 < 0:\n          total = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n      print(total) And we leave the \"q -= 1\" as is. But note: the current while loop body has \"q -= 1\", so we don't change that.",

However, the above if x==y is redundant because if x==y, then x-y==0, and then in the else branch we do:\n        if x-y-1 < 0 -> which is 0-1<0 -> true, so we do total = pre[x-1] -> same as the if branch. So we can just do:\n\n      if x-y-1 < 0:\n          total = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n\n  But note: if x-y==0, then x-y-1 = -1 -> so we do the if branch -> pre[x-1] -> correct. Also, if x-y==1, then x-y-1=0 -> we do pre[x-1]-pre[0] -> correct. But what if x==1 and y==1: then x-y=0 -> then we do pre[0] -> correct. However, what if x==2 and y==1: x-y=1 -> then we do pre[1] - pre[0] -> which is (prices[0]+prices[1]) - prices[0] = prices[1] -> correct? The set: the largest 2: [prices[0], prices[1]] -> the smallest one is prices[1] -> correct. But note: the example (2,1) in the note: the customer buys two items worth 5 and 5 -> the cheapest is 5 -> so we output 5 -> correct.",

Specifically, the known solution for this problem is to check the following conditions:\n\n            a is a divisor of 2*(w+l-2) and \n            ( \n              (w % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \n              ((w-1) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \n              (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \n              ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \n              ( (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 ) \n            ) But note: the example w=3, l=5, a=3:\n            2*(3+5-2)=12, and 3|12 -> true. then condition: \n               w % a = 3 % 3 = 0, (l-1) % a = 4 % 3 = 1 -> not 0.\n               (w-1) % a = 2 % 3 = 2, l % a = 5 % 3 = 2 -> not 0. w % a =0, (l-2) % a = 3 % 3 =0 -> true. So a=3 is valid. a=2:\n             condition: \n               w % a = 3 % 2 = 1, (l-1)=4 %2=0 -> then we need the condition (w % a ==0 and (l-1)%a==0) -> not met. (w-1)%a=2%2=0, l%a=5%2=1 -> not met.\n               w%a=1, (l-2)%a=3%2=1 -> not met. (w-2)%a=1%2=1, l%a=5%2=1 -> not met. (w-1)%a=0, (l-1)%a=4%2=0 -> true.\n\n          a=1: obviously. a=4: \n             condition: \n               try: \n                 (w %4 = 3, (l-1)=4 -> 0) -> not both. (w-1)%4=2, l%4=1 -> not.\n                 w%4=3, (l-2)=3 -> 3 -> not. (w-2)%4=1, l%4=1 -> not. (w-1)%4=2, (l-1)%4=0 -> not both.\n             -> not valid. a=6: \n             condition: \n                 w%6=3, (l-1)=4 -> not. (w-1)=2, l=5 -> not.\n                 w=3, (l-2)=3 -> 3%6=3, not 0.\n                 (w-2)=1, l=5 -> not. (w-1)=2, (l-1)=4 -> not both 0.\n             -> not valid. a=12: similarly not. Therefore, the condition is: a is a divisor of 2*(w+l-2) and [ (w % a ==0 and (l-2)%a==0) or ((w-1)%a==0 and (l-1)%a==0) or ... (all five) ] But the given code does not have this.

For mod_a==2, we are including if l%a==0 or (l-1)%a==0.\n             - If l%a==0, then condition4: (w-2)%a==0 and l%a==0 -> valid.\n             - If (l-1)%a==0, then what condition? \n                 condition not in the list: (w-2)%a==0 and (l-1)%a==0 -> is that valid? Let me try: w=5, l=5, a=3: \n             w%a = 5%3=2, (l-1)%a=4%3=1 -> not. conditions: \n                 condition1: w%3=2, not0.\n                 condition2: (w-1)%3=4%3=1, l%3=2 -> not.\n                 condition3: w%3=2, not0.\n                 condition4: (w-2)%3=3%3=0, l%3=2 -> not. condition5: (w-1)%3=1, (l-1)%3=1 -> not 0.\n             -> not valid. So only the conditions we listed. Therefore, in the TODO, we do:\n\n             if mod_a == 0:\n                 if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0:\n                     solutions.add(a) elif mod_a == 1:\n                 if l % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0:\n                     solutions.add(a) elif mod_a == 2:\n                 if l % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0:\n                     solutions.add(a)\n\n          But note: a might be 1, but we already have 1 in the set. However, the for loop starts at i=2, and then a can be 2 and then we might add 2 again? but set will not duplicate. Also, they iterate a in [i, half_perimeter//i] -> and half_perimeter = w+l-2. But note: the conditions involve modulo with a, and a might be greater than w or l? For example, if a > w, then w%a = w, which is >2, so we skip. So we are safe. But what if a is 2? In the for loop: i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), and if half_perimeter is even, then a=2 will be caught by i=2. Then mod_a = w % 2. if w is even: mod_a=0 -> then we check: (l-1)%2 and (l-2)%2. if w is odd: mod_a=1 -> then we check: l%2 and (l-1)%2.\n\n          Example: w=3, l=5, a=2:\n             mod_a = 3%2=1 -> then we check: l%2=5%2=1 -> true, so we add 2. But 2 is already in the set. So we might be adding duplicates. But set takes care.",

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the strings at these indices differ in exactly one position. The strings are of length 2, and the characters are from 'a' to 'k'. The solution involves efficiently counting these pairs without resorting to a brute-force approach, which would be computationally expensive for large inputs.\n\n### Approach for Program1 (String Pairs)\n1. **Frequency Counting**: We first count the frequency of each string using a dictionary.\n2. **Grouping by First Character**: We group the strings by their first character. For each group, we calculate the total number of pairs of strings that share the same first character but have different second characters. This is done by:\n   - Calculating the total number of pairs in the group (all possible pairs of strings in the group).\n   - Subtracting the number of pairs that have the same second character (which do not meet the condition).\n3. **Grouping by Second Character**: Similarly, we group the strings by their second character and repeat the same process to count pairs that share the same second character but have different first characters.\n4. **Combining Results**: The results from both groupings are summed to get the total count of valid pairs. Since each valid pair is counted exactly once in either of the groupings, we avoid double-counting.\n\n### Solution Code for Program1\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\ngroup_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\nfor s, cnt in a.items():\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n    group_first[c1][c2] += cnt\n\ntotal_count = 0\nfor inner in group_first.values():\n    total_in_group = sum(inner.values())\n    same_second = 0\n    for count_val in inner.values():\n        same_second += count_val * (count_val - 1) // 2\n    total_pairs = total_in_group * (total_in_group - 1) // 2\n    total_count += total_pairs - same_second\n\ngroup_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\nfor s, cnt in a.items():\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n    group_second[c2][c1] += cnt\n\nfor inner in group_second.values():\n    total_in_group = sum(inner.values())\n    same_first = 0\n    for count_val in inner.values():\n        same_first += count_val * (count_val - 1) // 2\n    total_pairs = total_in_group * (total_in_group - 1) // 2\n    total_count += total_pairs - same_first\n\ncount = total_count * 2\n```\n\n### Approach for Program2 (Lemper Cooking)\nThe problem involves transforming an array of integers such that all elements are non-negative using a series of operations. The key insight is recognizing that the prefix sums of the array must be non-decreasing and non-negative for a solution to exist. The solution involves:\n1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Compute the prefix sums of the array.\n2. **Validation Check**: Check if all prefix sums are non-negative and if the last prefix sum is the maximum (ensuring the sequence is non-decreasing).\n3. **Inversion Count**: If valid, count the number of inversions in the sequence of prefix sums. An inversion is a pair (i, j) where i < j and prefix[i] > prefix[j]. The inversion count gives the minimum number of operations needed.\n\n### Solution Code for Program2\n```python\n            res_left = self._func(res_left, self.data[start])\n            start += 1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program1**: The solution efficiently counts pairs of strings differing in exactly one position by leveraging grouping and combinatorial mathematics. By grouping strings by their first and second characters, we avoid the O(n^2) complexity of a brute-force approach, reducing it to O(n) per test case.\n- **Program2**: The solution checks the feasibility of making all array elements non-negative by verifying the prefix sums. If feasible, it counts inversions in the prefix sums using a segment tree, which efficiently handles range queries and updates, ensuring optimal performance for large inputs. The inversion count directly correlates with the minimum operations required.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about processing queries for a promotion: for each query (x, y), we need to compute the maximum total value of free items when a customer must purchase at least x items and the y cheapest ones are free.\n\nThe current code does:\n  n, q = ... and reads the prices.\n  Then it sorts the prices in descending order (reverse=True).\n\nBut note: the example in the note: \n  In the first query: items [5, 3, 5] -> the two cheapest are 3 and 5 (which are the two smallest) but note that when sorted in descending order: [5,5,3,2,1] (if we have 5 items) but the example only uses 3 items.\n\nHowever, the current code then does:\n  for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nAnd then in the while loop for each query:\n  x, y = ... \n  l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n  print(prices[x-1] - l)\n\nThis current approach is flawed because:\n  - The note example: \n        Query: x=3, y=2 -> should be 8.\n        With sorted prices (descending): [5,5,3,2,1] (if n=5) but the example only uses 3 items: [5,3,5] -> which when sorted descending: [5,5,3] -> then the two cheapest are the last two: 5 and 3? -> but that would be 8? \n        However, the code does: \n            l = 0 if 3==2? no -> so l = prices[3-2-1] = prices[0] = 5.\n            then prints prices[2] (which is the 3rd element, index 2) which is 3 -> 3 - 5 = -2 -> not 8.\n\nSo what is the intended solution?\n\nWe note that the customer can choose any set of at least x items. The goal is to maximize the free value (which is the sum of the y cheapest in that set). Since the free items are the cheapest ones, to maximize the free value we want the set of items that has the largest possible y cheapest items. However, note that the customer can choose any set. Therefore, the best strategy is to choose a set of exactly x items (because if we choose more, we might add a very cheap item that doesn't help and might push a more expensive item into the free part? Actually, we can always ignore extra items? But note: the free part is the y cheapest in the entire purchase. So if we buy more than x, then we have more items and the y cheapest might be even cheaper? Actually, we can always choose to ignore the extra items? But the problem says \"at least x\", so we can choose exactly x.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: \n  For a fixed (x,y), we want to choose a set S of exactly x items such that the sum of the y smallest items in S is as large as possible.\n\nHow to do that?\n  We note that the free part is the y smallest in S. To maximize the free part, we want the y smallest in S to be as large as possible. Therefore, we should avoid including very small items. The best idea is to take the largest x items? But then the y smallest in that set would be the last y of the largest x. However, consider: if we take the largest x items, then the y smallest in that set are the last y of the largest x. But note: we are allowed to take any set. However, if we take a set that is not the largest x, then the y smallest in that set might be even smaller? So the best is to take the largest x items.\n\nTherefore, the free value for a query (x,y) is the sum of the y smallest items in the set of the largest x items.\n\nBut note: the example: \n  Items: [5,3,5] -> but if we sort the entire list: [1,2,3,5,5] (ascending) -> the largest 3 are [5,5,3] -> the two smallest in this set are 3 and 5 -> sum=8.\n\nSo we can do:\n  Sort the entire list in ascending order? But the current code sorts in descending. \n\nAlternatively, we can sort in ascending and then the set of the largest x items is the last x items. Then the y smallest in that set are the first y of the last x? Actually, no: in the ascending order, the last x are the largest. The smallest in the last x are the first few of these last x? \n\nExample: [1,2,3,5,5] (ascending). The last 3: [3,5,5]. The two smallest in these last 3 are the first two: 3 and 5 -> 8.\n\nSo if we sort in ascending order, then the free value for (x,y) is the sum of the (n - x)th to (n - x + y - 1)th? \n  Let the array be sorted ascending: a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}.\n  The largest x: from index n-x to n-1.\n  The y smallest in that segment: from n-x to n-x+y-1.\n\nTherefore, we need the prefix sum for the array.\n\nBut note: the constraints: n, q up to 200,000.\n\nSo we can precompute the prefix sum array.\n\nBut the current code does:\n  prices.sort(reverse=True)   -> descending: [5,5,3,2,1] for the example.\n\nThen it does a loop for i in range(1, len(prices)) and then in the query it does:\n  l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n  print(prices[x-1] - l)\n\nThis doesn't look like a prefix sum.\n\nSo what is the intended solution in the current code? It seems to be trying to do something else.\n\nAlternatively, note that the problem asks for the maximum total value of free items. We have argued that it is the sum of the y smallest in the largest x. \n\nBut the current code does:\n  It sorts descending: so the array is [5,5,3,2,1] for the example.\n\nThen in the query (3,2): \n  x=3, y=2 -> \n      l = prices[3-2-1] = prices[0] = 5.\n      then prints prices[2] (which is 3) minus 5 -> -2.\n\nThat is clearly wrong.\n\nSo we must fix the code.\n\nPlan for program1.py:\n  Step 1: Read n, q and the list of prices.\n  Step 2: Sort the prices in ascending order? Actually, we can also do descending and then reverse the logic.\n\n  But note: the problem says: the customer can choose any set. The best set is the set of the largest x items. Then the free part is the y smallest in that set. In descending order, the largest x are the first x. Then the y smallest in the first x are the last y of the first x? \n\n  Example: descending: [5,5,3,2,1] -> the first 3: [5,5,3]. The two smallest in [5,5,3] are the last two: 5 and 3? -> but that is 8? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 5? But in descending order, the last two are 5 and 3? \n\n  Actually, the two smallest in the set [5,5,3] are 3 and 5? But 3 is the smallest and then 5. So the two smallest are 3 and 5. \n\n  How to get the sum of the y smallest in the first x? \n      We can precompute a prefix sum for the descending array? But note: the y smallest in the first x are the last y of the first x. \n\n  In the descending array, the last y of the first x are the elements from index x-y to x-1? \n      For x=3, y=2: indices from 3-2=1 to 2: [prices[1], prices[2]] = [5,3] -> sum=8.\n\n  So we need the sum of the segment [x-y, x-1] in the descending array.\n\n  Therefore, we can precompute a prefix sum array for the descending array.\n\n  Steps:\n      Sort the prices in descending order.\n      Precompute an array pre such that:\n          pre[0] = prices[0]\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]   for i>=1\n\n      But then the sum for the segment [x-y, x-1] is:\n          pre[x-1] - (pre[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\n      However, note: if x==y, then we want the entire segment [0, x-1] -> which is pre[x-1] (if we use 0-indexed and the segment is [0, x-1] then the prefix sum at x-1 is the total from 0 to x-1). But if we do:\n          total = pre[x-1] - (pre[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n      When x==y: then x-y=0, so we want [0, x-1] -> then we subtract pre[-1]? which is not defined.\n\n  Alternatively, we can precompute the prefix sum for the entire array (0-indexed) and then the sum from i to j is pre[j] - pre[i-1] (if i>0). But if i==0, then it's pre[j].\n\n  So we can do:\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      Then for a query (x,y):\n          start_index = x - y   # because we want from index (x-y) to (x-1) -> that's y elements.\n          if start_index == 0:\n              s = pre[x-1]\n          else:\n              s = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n\n  But note: the example (3,2): \n        x=3, y=2 -> start_index = 1, so we do pre[2] - pre[0] = (5+5+3) - 5 = 8? \n        But wait: pre[2] = 5+5+3 = 13? and pre[0]=5 -> 13-5=8 -> correct.\n\n  However, the example (2,1): \n        x=2, y=1 -> start_index=1, so we do pre[1] - pre[0] = (5+5) - 5 = 5 -> correct.\n\n  Example (5,3): \n        x=5, y=3 -> start_index=2, so we do pre[4] - pre[1] = (5+5+3+2+1) - (5+5) = 16-10=6 -> correct.\n\n  So the plan is:\n      Sort the prices in descending order.\n      Precompute the prefix sum array for the entire array.\n\n  Then for each query (x,y):\n      if y == 0: then free is 0? but y>=1 so we don't have to worry.\n      if x == y: then we take the entire segment [0, x-1] -> which is pre[x-1] (if x-1 is in range).\n      Otherwise, we take the segment [x-y, x-1] -> which is pre[x-1] - (pre[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\n  But note: if x-y==0, then we want from 0 to x-1 -> which is pre[x-1] (and we don't subtract anything). So we can write:\n      if x-y == 0:\n          s = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          s = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a prefix array that has a 0 at the beginning to avoid the if? \n\n  We can do:\n      pre = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i-1]\n\n      Then the sum from index i to j (inclusive) is pre[j+1] - pre[i].\n\n      For the segment [x-y, x-1] (0-indexed) in the descending array:\n          i = x-y, j = x-1 -> so the sum = pre[x] - pre[x-y]   ??? \n\n      But note: \n          pre[x] = sum of prices[0] to prices[x-1] (because pre is 0-indexed with pre[0]=0, pre[1]=prices[0], pre[2]=prices[0]+prices[1], ...)\n          Then the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) is: \n              pre[x] - pre[x-y]   -> because:\n                  pre[x] = prices[0] + ... + prices[x-1]\n                  pre[x-y] = prices[0] + ... + prices[x-y-1]\n                  subtract -> we get prices[x-y] + ... + prices[x-1] -> which is exactly the segment.\n\n      Example (3,2): \n          x=3, y=2 -> then we need pre[3] - pre[1] = (5+5+3) - (5) = 13-5=8 -> correct.\n\n      Example (2,1): \n          x=2, y=1 -> pre[2]-pre[1] = (5+5) - 5 = 5 -> correct.\n\n      Example (5,3): \n          x=5, y=3 -> pre[5]-pre[2] = (5+5+3+2+1) - (5+5) = 16-10=6 -> correct.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      n, q = map(int, input().split())\n      prices = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      prices.sort(reverse=True)   # descending order\n\n      # Precompute prefix sum with an extra 0 at the beginning\n      pre = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i-1]\n\n      for _ in range(q):\n          x, y = map(int, input().split())\n          # The free value is the sum of the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the descending array? \n          # But note: we have pre array: the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) is pre[x] - pre[x-y]\n          # However, note: the segment we want is the last y of the first x? which is the segment from (x-y) to (x-1) -> that's y elements: from x-y to x-1 (inclusive) -> that's exactly what we have.\n\n          # But note: if x-y is negative? but y<=x, so x-y>=0. Also, if x>n? but x<=n (from the input: x<=n). \n          # So we can do:\n          ans = pre[x] - pre[x-y]\n          print(ans)\n\n  However, wait: the example (1,1): \n        x=1, y=1 -> then we need the first 1 items: [5] -> the free part is the entire purchase? but note: the free part is the y cheapest, which is the entire set (only one) -> 5.\n        Our method: pre[1]-pre[0] = 5-0=5 -> correct.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"for the given values of x and y\", and we are using the entire array? Actually, we are only using the first x items. And we are taking the last y of the first x? which in descending order are the smallest y in the set? \n\n  Why the last y of the first x? \n      The set of the largest x items: in descending order, the first x items.\n      The y smallest in that set: in the descending order, the smallest in the set are the ones that are the least in the set, which are the last ones in the descending order? \n\n  Example: [5,5,3,2,1] (descending) -> the set of the first 3: [5,5,3]. The two smallest in this set are 5 and 3? but wait, 5 is the largest and 3 is the smallest? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 5? But note: in the set [5,5,3] the smallest is 3, then the next smallest is 5? \n\n  However, when we take the segment from index (3-2)=1 to index 2: that is [5,3] -> which are the two smallest? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 5? But 5 is repeated. \n\n  But note: the segment we are taking is the last y of the first x? that is the last two of the first three: [5,3] -> and we sum them: 5+3=8.\n\n  Why is that the two smallest? \n      The set is [5,5,3]. The smallest is 3, then the next smallest is 5 (because there are two 5's). So the two smallest are 3 and 5? \n\n  But note: the two smallest are the two smallest values. The values are 5,5,3. The two smallest are 3 and 5? \n\n  However, when we take the segment from index 1 to 2 in the descending array, we are taking the second and third element: which are 5 and 3. That is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1.py should be:\n\n      n, q = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      prices = [int(price) for price in input().split()]\n      prices.sort(reverse=True)\n      # Precompute prefix sum array of length n+1\n      pre = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i-1]\n      while q:\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          # We want the sum of the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the original array (which is the descending array)\n          # That is pre[x] - pre[x-y]\n          print(pre[x] - pre[x-y])\n          q -= 1\n\n  But note: the current code has a for loop from 1 to len(prices)-1 that is not used. We can remove that.\n\n  So the missing part in program1.py is the prefix sum computation and then the query processing.\n\n  However, the current code in the problem has:\n      for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  And then the while loop. We are going to replace the while loop with our new one? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  The current code has:\n      n, q = ... \n      prices = ... \n      prices.sort(reverse=True)\n      for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      while q:\n          ... (with a print and q-=1)\n\n  We don't need the for loop. We can remove it. But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are going to replace the for loop with the prefix sum computation and then use the while loop as we have.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the for loop to compute the prefix sum? But the for loop runs from 1 to len(prices)-1. We can do:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      Then in the query, we have to be careful: \n          We want the sum from index (x-y) to (x-1). \n          If x-y==0, then the sum is pre[x-1] (if we use 0-indexed without a leading 0) but note: pre[x-1] is the sum from 0 to x-1.\n          But we want from x-y to x-1: \n              if x-y==0: then we want pre[x-1] (which is the sum from 0 to x-1) -> correct.\n              else: we want pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]   (because pre[x-y-1] is the sum from 0 to x-y-1, so subtracting gives the segment from x-y to x-1).\n\n      Example (3,2): \n          x=3, y=2 -> x-y=1, so we do pre[2] - pre[0] = (5+5+3) - 5 = 8 -> correct.\n\n      But note: the array pre is of length n, and we are using indices 0 to n-1.\n\n      However, what if x-y==0? then we do pre[x-1] - pre[-1]? -> no, we have an if.\n\n      We can do:\n          if x-y == 0:\n              total = pre[x-1]\n          else:\n              total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n\n      But note: if x==1 and y==1: then x-y=0 -> then we use pre[0] = prices[0] -> correct.\n\n      But the problem says: the array has n elements. x<=n, so x-1 is at most n-1.\n\n      However, the problem also says: the entire array is of size n, and we are only using the first x items. \n\n      But what if x-y-1 is negative? \n          x-y>=0, so x-y-1>=-1. But if x-y==0, then we avoid the subtraction. So we are safe.\n\n      But what if x-y==1? then we subtract pre[0] -> which is defined.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      n, q = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      prices = [int(price) for price in input().split()]\n      prices.sort(reverse=True)\n      # Precompute prefix without extra element\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      while q:\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          # We want the sum from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the array of length n (0-indexed)\n          if x == y:\n              # then we need the entire segment [0, x-1] -> which is pre[x-1] (if x-1 is in range)\n              # but note: if x==1, then we use pre[0]\n              total = pre[x-1]\n          else:\n              # We need to subtract: from index (x-y) to (x-1): that's pre[x-1] - (pre[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n              if x-y-1 < 0:\n                  total = pre[x-1]\n              else:\n                  total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n          print(total)\n          q -= 1\n\n  But wait: if x-y==0, we use the entire segment? but note: x>=y, and if x==y, then we want the entire segment [0, x-1] -> which is pre[x-1]. But what if x==0? but x>=1.\n\n  However, the above if x==y is redundant because if x==y, then x-y==0, and then in the else branch we do:\n        if x-y-1 < 0 -> which is 0-1<0 -> true, so we do total = pre[x-1] -> same as the if branch.\n\n  So we can just do:\n\n      if x-y-1 < 0:\n          total = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n\n  But note: if x-y==0, then x-y-1 = -1 -> so we do the if branch -> pre[x-1] -> correct.\n\n  Also, if x-y==1, then x-y-1=0 -> we do pre[x-1]-pre[0] -> correct.\n\n  But what if x==1 and y==1: then x-y=0 -> then we do pre[0] -> correct.\n\n  However, what if x==2 and y==1: \n        x-y=1 -> then we do pre[1] - pre[0] -> which is (prices[0]+prices[1]) - prices[0] = prices[1] -> correct? \n        The set: the largest 2: [prices[0], prices[1]] -> the smallest one is prices[1] -> correct.\n\n  But note: the example (2,1) in the note: the customer buys two items worth 5 and 5 -> the cheapest is 5 -> so we output 5 -> correct.\n\n  However, the problem says: the array is sorted in descending order. So the first two are the two largest.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      n, q = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      prices = [int(price) for price in input().split()]\n      prices.sort(reverse=True)\n      # Precompute prefix without extra element\n      pre = [0] * n\n      if n > 0:\n          pre[0] = prices[0]\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      while q:\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          # We want the sum of the segment from (x-y) to (x-1) (0-indexed)\n          # The segment has y elements: from index (x-y) to (x-1)\n          # The prefix sum for the entire array up to index (x-1) is pre[x-1]\n          # The prefix sum up to index (x-y-1) is pre[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0, otherwise 0.\n          if x-y-1 < 0:\n              total = pre[x-1]   # because we are including from 0 to x-1\n          else:\n              total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n          print(total)\n          q -= 1\n\n  But note: if x-y-1 is negative, then we are taking the entire segment from 0 to x-1? which is correct.\n\n  However, what if x-y-1 is negative? that happens when x-y==0 -> then we take the entire segment.\n\n  But what if x-y==0.5? no, integers.\n\n  But note: if x==1 and y=1: then x-y=0 -> then we do pre[0] -> correct.\n\n  But what if x>n? but the problem says x<=n.\n\n  However, the array pre is of length n. If x is 200000, then we need pre[199999] (if n=200000). So we must have n elements.\n\n  But note: the array prices has n elements. We sorted it. Then we create pre of length n.\n\n  But what if x is 1? then we use pre[0] -> which is defined.\n\n  This should work.\n\n  But the problem says: the current code has a for loop from 1 to len(prices)-1. We can use that for loop to compute the prefix array? \n\n  The current code:\n\n      for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can do:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n  Then we remove the while loop and replace it with our new while loop.\n\n  However, the current while loop does:\n\n      while q:\n          x, y = ... \n          l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n          print(prices[x-1] - l)\n          q -= 1\n\n  We are going to replace that while loop.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we are going to:\n\n      - Replace the for loop (which currently has a TODO) with the prefix sum computation.\n\n      - Replace the while loop with the new one that uses the prefix array.\n\n  However, the problem says: the current code has a while loop that we must fix? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do without the prefix array? \n\n  But note: the constraints: q up to 200,000 and n up to 200,000. We cannot do a loop for each query to sum y elements (because 200000*200000 is 40e9). So we need the prefix sum.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      We remove the for loop and replace it with:\n\n          pre = [0] * n\n          if n > 0:\n              pre[0] = prices[0]\n              for i in range(1, n):\n                  pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      Then we replace the while loop with:\n\n          while q:\n              x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n              if x - y - 1 < 0:\n                  total = pre[x-1]\n              else:\n                  total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n              print(total)\n              q -= 1\n\n  But note: the current while loop already exists. We are only changing the body.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we must output the entire block that is missing? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n  In program1.py, the given code has:\n\n      for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      and then the while loop. \n\n  We are going to:\n\n      - Replace the for loop with the prefix sum computation.\n\n      - Replace the while loop body.\n\n  But note: the while loop condition and the decrement of q are already there. We only change the body.\n\n  So for program1.py, the missing part is:\n\n      The for loop block: we replace the TODO with the prefix sum computation.\n\n      The while loop body: we replace the current two lines (l = ... and print) with the new three lines (if, else, and print total).\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and in the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n  We must output the exact code that goes in the missing parts.\n\n  For the for loop: we are replacing the entire for loop? Actually, the for loop is already there. We are replacing the body of the for loop? \n\n  The current for loop:\n\n      for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We want to compute the prefix array. We can do:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n  But note: the current for loop runs from 1 to n-1 (because len(prices)=n). So we can use that for loop? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      # We create the pre array and initialize pre[0] before the loop.\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n  But the current code has a for loop that we are going to use. So we can write:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n  Then we leave the while loop as is? but we change the body.\n\n  However, the while loop body is not in the TODO. The TODO is only in the for loop. But the problem says the program is given with missing lines in both the for loop and the while loop? \n\n  Actually, the given code for the while loop is:\n\n      while q:\n          # 5 5 3 2 1\n          # 5 10 13 15 16\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n          print(prices[x-1] - l)\n          q -= 1\n\n  We are going to change the body of the while loop. But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we must output the corrected while loop body? \n\n  Alternatively, the problem might consider the entire while loop as part of the missing block? \n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  We are going to output:\n\n      For program1: \n          We output the code that replaces the for loop and the code that replaces the while loop body? \n\n      However, the problem says: the program has two parts: the for loop with a TODO and the while loop that is already there but is incorrect.\n\n  How about we break it down:\n\n      The for loop: we are going to write the body of the for loop? But the for loop is already there. We are going to write the code that goes inside the for loop? \n\n      Actually, the TODO is inside the for loop. So we write:\n\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      But we also need to initialize pre? \n\n      The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are missing the entire block for the prefix sum? \n\n      We can do:\n\n          pre = [0] * n\n          pre[0] = prices[0]\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      And then we change the while loop body to:\n\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          if x - y - 1 < 0:\n              total = pre[x-1]\n          else:\n              total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n          print(total)\n\n      But note: the while loop also has \"q -= 1\", which we keep.\n\n  So the missing block for the for loop is the entire for loop body? but the for loop is already there. We are going to replace the TODO with:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      # Then the for loop we are in: we are at i from 1 to n-1.\n      # But note: the for loop is already written: \"for i in range(1, len(prices)):\"\n      # So we can do:\n      pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      However, we must initialize pre before the loop. So we have to add a line before the for loop.\n\n  This is messy. Alternatively, we can restructure:\n\n      We remove the existing for loop and replace it with a block that does the prefix sum.\n\n      But the problem says: the given code has that for loop. We are allowed to fill in the TODO and also adjust the while loop.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", I think we are allowed to output the entire corrected block for the for loop and the entire corrected block for the while loop body.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we output the code that is missing in the given program.\n\n  In the given program1.py, the for loop has a TODO and the while loop body is already written (but we are going to change it). \n\n  We decide to output:\n\n      For program1: \n          We output the code that goes in the for loop (the TODO) and the corrected while loop body.\n\n  But note: we also need to initialize the pre array. So we have to add a line before the for loop.\n\n  Therefore, the missing block for the for loop part is:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n  But wait, the for loop is already written: \"for i in range(1, len(prices)):\". We can use that. So we can do:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      # Then inside the for loop (which runs for i from 1 to n-1) we do:\n      pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n  But then we have to be careful: the for loop is already there. We are only filling the body.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n      pre = [0] * n\n      pre[0] = prices[0]\n      for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n          pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n  And then the while loop body we change to:\n\n      x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      if x - y - 1 < 0:\n          total = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n      print(total)\n      q -= 1   # this line is already there? but we output it? \n\n  But the problem says: the while loop is already there and has:\n\n      while q:\n          # 5 5 3 2 1\n          # 5 10 13 15 16\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n          print(prices[x-1] - l)\n          q -= 1\n\n  We are going to replace the three lines after the comments with our new code. So the missing block for the while loop body is:\n\n      x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      if x - y - 1 < 0:\n          total = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n      print(total)\n\n  And we leave the \"q -= 1\" as is.\n\n  But note: the current while loop body has \"q -= 1\", so we don't change that.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, we output:\n\n      program1: \n          pre = [0] * n\\n\n          pre[0] = prices[0]\\n\n          for i in range(1, len(prices)):\\n\n              pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\\n\n          \\n\n          while q:\\n\n              x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\n\n              if x - y - 1 < 0:\\n\n                  total = pre[x-1]\\n\n              else:\\n\n                  total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\\n\n              print(total)\\n\n              q -= 1\n\n  But wait, the while loop condition and the q decrement are already there. We are only replacing the body of the while loop (the part from the reading of x,y to the print). \n\n  However, the given while loop body has two lines of comments. We are replacing from the line \"x, y = ...\" to the line \"print(prices[x-1]-l)\" and then leaves the \"q-=1\". \n\n  So we replace:\n\n      x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n      print(prices[x-1] - l)\n\n  with:\n\n      x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      if x - y - 1 < 0:\n          total = pre[x-1]\n      else:\n          total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n      print(total)\n\n  And leave the rest.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      Block 1 (for the for loop part):\n          pre = [0] * n\n          pre[0] = prices[0]\n          for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n              pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n      Block 2 (for the while loop body):\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          if x - y - 1 < 0:\n              total = pre[x-1]\n          else:\n              total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n          print(total)\n\n  But note: the while loop body also has the line \"q -= 1\", but that is not missing? it is already there.\n\n  However, the problem says: the while loop is given. We are only replacing the part that is missing? \n\n  But the given while loop body has a TODO? no, it is written but incorrect. We are replacing the entire body except the last line.\n\n  Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", we output the two blocks as described.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", and the given program has two TODO locations: one in the for loop and one in the while loop (but the while loop is not marked with TODO, it is written but we are going to change it). \n\n  Alternatively, we can output the entire corrected program1.py? but the problem says not to.\n\n  We decide to output:\n\n      program1: \n          pre = [0] * n\n          pre[0] = prices[0]\n          for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n              pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n          while q:\n              x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n              if x - y - 1 < 0:\n                  total = pre[x-1]\n              else:\n                  total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\n              print(total)\n              q -= 1\n\n  But note: the while loop condition and the q decrement are already in the given code. However, the problem says the while loop is given. But we are replacing the entire body of the while loop? \n\n  Actually, the given while loop body has comments and three lines. We are replacing the three lines (the two comments we leave? but the problem doesn't say to remove them). \n\n  But the comments are:\n\n      # 5 5 3 2 1\n      # 5 10 13 15 16\n\n  These are example values. We can remove them? or leave them? \n\n  Since the problem doesn't say, and to be safe, we remove them? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are only required to output the code that is missing. The comments are not code. \n\n  We decide to output the code without the comments.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, we output the two blocks: the for loop block and the while loop body block (without the comments).\n\n  But note: the while loop body block includes the reading of x,y and the if-else and the print, and then the q decrement is already there.\n\n  However, the given code has the q decrement. We are not changing it. So in the while loop body, we only output the part that is not the q decrement? \n\n  But the problem says: the while loop is given and has:\n\n      while q:\n          # 5 5 3 2 1\n          # 5 10 13 15 16\n          x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n          l = 0 if x == y else prices[x - y - 1]\n          print(prices[x-1] - l)\n          q -= 1\n\n  We are replacing the three lines after the comments with three or more lines. \n\n  So the missing block for the while loop is the entire body of the while loop? but the q decrement is already there and we keep it. \n\n  We decide to output only the part that replaces the three lines (the two of the TODO in the while loop body). \n\n  But to be safe, we output the entire while loop body without the comments and without the q decrement? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the given code has the while loop with a body that is partially written. We are replacing the part that is written incorrectly.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", we output for program1.py:\n\n      Block for the for loop (which is currently empty except for the for loop header) and the block for the while loop body (the part that is currently there but is wrong).\n\n  We write:\n\n      program1: \n          \"pre = [0] * n\\npre[0] = prices[0]\\nfor i in range(1, len(prices)):\\n    pre[i] = pre[i-1] + prices[i]\"\n          +\n          \"x, y = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\\nif x - y - 1 < 0:\\n    total = pre[x-1]\\nelse:\\n    total = pre[x-1] - pre[x-y-1]\\nprint(total)\"\n\n  But note: the while loop also has the line \"q -= 1\", which we leave as is. So we don't include it.\n\n  Now for program2.py:\n\n  The problem: \n      Bethany tiling: \n          The bathroom has dimensions w x l.\n          She uses 1x1 tiles for the interior: (w-2)*(l-2) tiles.\n          On the boundary, she uses tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated). \n\n      We are to find all a>=1 such that the entire floor can be tiled.\n\n      The total number of tiles is w * l.\n      The interior uses (w-2)*(l-2) tiles of 1x1.\n      The boundary then uses: \n          total = w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = w*l - (w*l -2w-2l+4) = 2w+2l-4.\n\n      The boundary must be tiled with tiles of size 1xa (which can be rotated, so they are effectively ax1 as well).\n\n      The boundary is a cycle? but actually, it is a rectangular ring. It can be divided into four parts:\n\n          Top: from (0,0) to (0, l-1) -> length l\n          Right: from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1) -> length w-1\n          Bottom: from (w-1, l-1) to (w-1, 0) -> length l-1\n          Left: from (w-1,0) to (0,0) -> length w-1\n\n      But note: the corners are shared. So the total length is 2*(w+l-2).\n\n      The total boundary area is 2*(w+l-2) (since each tile is 1x1, the area is the same as the length).\n\n      Now, we use tiles of size 1xa. The tile covers a consecutive segment of length a (if placed horizontally) or if placed vertically, it covers a consecutive segment of length a. But note: the tile can be rotated, so it can cover either a horizontal or vertical segment.\n\n      The entire boundary must be partitioned into segments of length a. Therefore, a must be a divisor of the total boundary area? but note: the boundary is not a single cycle? Actually, it is a single cycle? \n\n      However, the problem does not require the boundary to be a single cycle? The boundary is a union of four sides. But the tiles can be arranged arbitrarily on the boundary? \n\n      But note: the tiles are 1xa, so they must be placed as a contiguous segment of length a. And the boundary is a single closed loop? \n\n      Actually, the boundary is a single cycle of length 2*(w+l-2). Therefore, a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2). \n\n      However, is that sufficient? \n\n      Consider: a=1 -> always works.\n\n      a=2: \n          Example: w=3, l=5 -> boundary length = 2*(3+5-2)=2*6=12. 12 is divisible by 2 -> so it should work? \n          But the note says a=1,2,3 work.\n\n      However, there might be additional constraints because of the corners? \n\n      The problem: \n          In the first test case: w=3, l=5 -> valid a: 1,2,3.\n\n      Why is a=3 valid? \n          12 is divisible by 3 -> so it is a divisor.\n\n      Why is a=4 not valid? \n          12 is divisible by 4? 12/4=3 -> so it is a divisor. But the note says only 1,2,3.\n\n      So there must be additional constraints.\n\n      How to tile with a=4 for w=3, l=5?\n          The boundary: \n            Top: 5\n            Right: 3-1 = 2\n            Bottom: 5-1 = 4\n            Left: 3-1 = 2\n          Total = 5+2+4+2 = 13? -> wait, I did double count? \n\n      Actually, the boundary length is 2*(w+l-2)=2*(3+5-2)=12.\n\n      But the four sides are: \n          Top: l = 5\n          Right: w-1 = 2\n          Bottom: l-1 = 4\n          Left: w-1 = 2\n          Total = 5+2+4+2 = 13 -> but that is 13, which is not 12.\n\n      Correction: the corners are shared. The boundary is:\n          (0,0) to (0, l-1): length l\n          (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1): length w-1   (because we already did the corner (0,l-1))\n          (w-1, l-1) to (w-1, 0): length l-1\n          (w-1,0) to (0,0): length w-1\n          But then we have counted the corners only once? \n          Total = l + (w-1) + (l-1) + (w-1) = 2*l + 2*w - 2 = 2*(w+l-1) -> which is 2*(3+5-1)=2*7=14 -> not 12.\n\n      The standard formula for the boundary of a grid is: 2*(w+l) - 4 (because the four corners are shared by two sides) -> 2*(3+5)-4 = 16-4=12.\n\n      How to break the sides without double counting the corners:\n          Top: from (0,0) to (0, l-1): length l, but then the next side starts at (0, l-1) and goes to (w-1, l-1): this side has length w-1 (because we start at the next row and go down to the last row, and we don't count the corner again). Similarly, the bottom from (w-1, l-1) to (w-1,0): length l-1, and the left from (w-1,0) to (0,0): length w-1. \n          Total = l + (w-1) + (l-1) + (w-1) = 2*l+2*w-2 = 2*(w+l-1) -> 2*(3+5-1)=14 -> not 12.\n\n      The correct way: \n          The boundary has:\n            Top: from (0,0) to (0, l-1): l\n            Right: from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1): w-1   [but note: (0,l-1) is already counted in the top, so we start from the next: (1, l-1) to (w-1, l-1) -> that's w-1? but then we are missing the corner (0,l-1) is counted in the top and not in the right? \n          Actually, the entire boundary is a cycle of length: \n            top: l, \n            right: w, \n            bottom: l, \n            left: w, \n          but then the corners are counted twice? \n\n      The standard formula: the boundary length is 2*(w+l-2) -> which is 2*(3+5-2)=12.\n\n      How to see: \n          The boundary has 4 edges. Each edge is:\n            top: l, but the two corners are shared -> so we count l-0? \n          Actually, the boundary is made of:\n            top: from (0,0) to (0, l-1): l\n            right: from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1): w, but (0,l-1) is already counted? \n          We must not count the corners twice. So we do:\n            top: l-0? \n          Instead, we break the boundary at the corners. The boundary has:\n            segment1: (0,0) to (0, l-2): length l-1\n            segment2: (0, l-1) to (w-2, l-1): length w-1\n            segment3: (w-1, l-1) to (w-1, 1): length l-1\n            segment4: (w-1,0) to (1,0): length w-1\n          and then the corners: (0,0), (0,l-1), (w-1,l-1), (w-1,0) are not covered? \n\n      This is messy.\n\n      Alternatively, the boundary is a single closed loop of length 2*(w+l-2). This is the standard formula.\n\n      Therefore, a must be a divisor of 2*(w+l-2). \n\n      But the example: w=3, l=5: divisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12. But the valid a are 1,2,3. Why not 4,6,12?\n\n      There must be additional constraints because of the geometry.\n\n      Consider the corners. The tile of length a must be placed along a contiguous segment. The boundary has four corners. At a corner, the tile cannot turn. Therefore, the tile must be placed entirely on one side? \n\n      But the problem says the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees. This means that a tile can be placed along a straight segment, but it cannot bend at a corner. Therefore, the boundary is not a single cycle that can be arbitrarily partitioned? \n\n      The boundary is composed of four straight segments. The tile of length a must be placed entirely within one side? or can it wrap around a corner? \n\n      The note says: the tiles can be rotated by 90 degrees. It does not say they can bend. Therefore, a tile must be placed on a single straight segment. It cannot cover two adjacent sides.\n\n      Therefore, the boundary is partitioned into four straight segments, and each tile must lie entirely within one segment.\n\n      The four segments are:\n\n          Segment A (top): from (0,0) to (0, l-1) -> length l\n          Segment B (right): from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1) -> length w\n          Segment C (bottom): from (w-1, l-1) to (w-1, 0) -> length l\n          Segment D (left): from (w-1,0) to (0,0) -> length w\n\n      But wait, the corners are shared? \n\n      Actually, the corners are the meeting points. The segments are:\n\n          A: (0,0) to (0, l-1) -> length l-1? because the corner (0,0) is shared with the left segment and (0,l-1) is shared with the right segment? \n\n      How the segments are defined: \n          The boundary has 4 sides, and each side has length:\n\n          top: l, but the two endpoints are shared -> so the number of unit segments is l-1? \n          Actually, the number of unit segments on the top is l, because from (0,0) to (0,1) is one, (0,1) to (0,2) is one, ... (0,l-2) to (0,l-1) is one -> that's l-1? \n\n      The standard: \n          The top side has l cells: from (0,0) to (0, l-1). But in terms of edges between cells, it has l-1 edges. However, in terms of tiling with 1xa tiles, we are covering cells. The boundary is made of cells. The top side has l cells.\n\n      But then the corner cells are shared between two sides. \n\n      The entire boundary has:\n\n          top: l cells\n          right: w cells, but the top-right cell is already counted in the top? \n          bottom: l cells, but the bottom-right cell is already counted in the right and the bottom-left in the left?\n          left: w cells, but the top-left and bottom-left are already counted.\n\n      This double counts the corners.\n\n      The boundary has exactly: 2*(w+l-2) cells. \n\n      And the four sides are:\n\n          top: from (0,0) to (0, l-1) -> l cells\n          right: from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1) -> w-1 cells (because (0,l-1) is already counted in the top, and (w-1,l-1) will be counted in the bottom)\n          bottom: from (w-1, l-1) to (w-1, 0) -> l-1 cells (because (w-1,l-1) is already counted in the right, and (w-1,0) will be counted in the left)\n          left: from (w-1,0) to (0,0) -> w-1 cells (because (w-1,0) is already counted in the bottom, and (0,0) is already counted in the top)\n\n      Total = l + (w-1) + (l-1) + (w-1) = 2*(w+l-2) -> correct.\n\n      Therefore, the four segments have lengths: \n          seg1 = l\n          seg2 = w-1\n          seg3 = l-1\n          seg4 = w-1\n\n      Now, we must partition each segment into parts of length a. This means that a must be a divisor of each of these segments? but note, a tile cannot span two segments. \n\n      But wait, the problem does not require that the tile is contained in one segment? It only says the tile is 1xa and can be rotated. If the tile is placed horizontally on the top segment, it is within the top. If it is placed vertically on the right segment, it is within the right. \n\n      Therefore, the condition is: \n          a must be a divisor of the total boundary length? -> not sufficient.\n          Additionally, a must be such that for each segment, the length of the segment is divisible by a? -> then we could partition that segment independently.\n\n      But then for the example w=3, l=5:\n          seg1 = 5, seg2 = 2, seg3 = 4, seg4 = 2.\n          a must be a divisor of 5, 2, 4, and 2? \n          The common divisors of 5,2,4,2 are 1 -> but we have a=1,2,3.\n\n      This is not matching.\n\n      Alternatively, the tile can be placed in such a way that it covers parts of two adjacent segments? \n\n      The problem says: \"On the floor boundary\", and the tiles can be rotated. It does not explicitly forbid covering two sides with one tile. \n\n      But the example pictures in the note: \n          a=1: obviously works.\n          a=2: \n             They show: \n                 The top: covered by two tiles of length 2 and one of length 1? -> no, the boundary has 12 cells, so 6 tiles of length 2.\n                 How they are arranged: \n                    The top: from (0,0) to (0,1): a tile of length 2; (0,2) to (0,3): a tile of length 2; (0,4): a tile of length 1? -> but then we have a=2 and a=1 mixed.\n\n      After checking the note: \n          The first test case: w=3, l=5 -> valid a=1,2,3.\n\n      How a=3 works: \n          The boundary has 12 cells, so 4 tiles of length 3.\n          One possible arrangement: \n             Place a tile vertically on the leftmost of the top: covering (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) -> then we have the top-right: (0,3) and (0,4) left on the top. \n             Then on the right: we have to cover (0,4) and (1,4) and (2,4). But we have a tile of length 3: we can place it vertically on the right covering (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) -> then the top is covered: (0,3) is left? \n\n      This is not working.\n\n      After reading the note: the provided pictures. \n          a=3: \n             The top: covered by one tile of length 3 and one of length 2? -> but a=3, so every tile must be of length 3.\n\n      One arrangement for a=3:\n          We can have:\n             Tile1: on the top: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) -> horizontal.\n             Tile2: on the top: (0,3), (0,4) -> but only two, not three.\n\n      Alternatively, wrap around? \n          The problem does not say the tile can wrap around the corner. \n\n      After rethinking: \n          The boundary is a single closed loop. The tile of length a can be placed along the loop, and it can wrap around a corner if the corner is not a problem. \n\n      However, the tile is 1xa: it is a straight tile. To go around a corner, we would have to bend the tile, which is not allowed.\n\n      Therefore, the tile must be placed on a straight segment. \n\n      So the boundary is partitioned into four independent segments. \n\n      Then the condition is: \n          a must be a divisor of the length of one of the segments? and then we can partition that segment independently. But then the other segments must also be partitioned by a. \n\n      But note: we can use the same a for all segments. So a must be a divisor of the length of every segment? \n\n      Then for the example: \n          segments: 5, 2, 4, 2.\n          a must be a common divisor of 5,2,4,2 -> only 1.\n\n      This does not explain a=2 and a=3.\n\n      Alternatively, a must be a divisor of the length of at least one way to split the boundary into four segments that add up to the total and that are the lengths of the sides? \n\n      There are several ways to assign the corners to the segments. In fact, the boundary has four corners. We can assign each corner to one of the two incident sides. \n\n      For example, the corner (0,0) can be assigned to the top or to the left. \n\n      Therefore, the four segments can have lengths chosen from two possibilities for each corner assignment. \n\n      Specifically, for the top side: it can be either l or l-1 (depending on whether we include the right endpoint or not).\n      Similarly, the right side: it can be w or w-1.\n      the bottom: l or l-1.\n      the left: w or w-1.\n\n      But note: the assignment must be consistent: if we take the top as l (which means we include the top-right corner in the top), then the right side must start at the next cell down, so it will be w-1. \n      Similarly, if we take the top as l-1 (so we leave the top-right corner for the right side), then the right side will be w.\n\n      Therefore, there are a few possibilities for the four segment lengths:\n\n          Possibility 1: \n             top: l-1, \n             right: w-1,\n             bottom: l-1,\n             left: w-1.\n          Total = 2*(w+l-2) -> matches.\n\n          Possibility 2:\n             top: l-1,\n             right: w,\n             bottom: l-1,\n             left: w-2   -> but w-2 might be negative? and total = (l-1)+w+(l-1)+(w-2) = 2*l+2*w-4 = 2*(w+l-2) -> matches.\n\n          How to get possibility2: \n             top: from (0,0) to (0, l-2) -> length l-1\n             right: from (0, l-1) to (w-1, l-1) -> length w\n             bottom: from (w-1, l-2) to (w-1, 0) -> length l-1 (wait, but (w-1, l-1) is already in the right? and (w-1, l-2) is the first cell of the bottom) -> then the bottom has from (w-1, l-2) to (w-1,0) -> that's l-1 cells.\n             left: from (w-2,0) to (0,0) -> length w-1? but then we have (w-1,0) is not covered? \n\n          This is not working.\n\n      Actually, the assignment of the corners is fixed: each corner cell must be assigned to one side. The side then has two options: either the side includes both its endpoints or not. \n\n      But note: the corner cell is shared by two sides. In the tiling, we assign the corner cell to one of the two sides. \n\n      Therefore, the four segments are not independent; they are four contiguous segments that cover the entire boundary, and the partition is defined by how we assign the four corner cells.\n\n      There are four corners. We can assign each corner to one of the two incident sides. This gives 2^4=16 ways. But by symmetry, we can reduce.\n\n      However, note that the total must be 2*(w+l-2), and the sum of the four segments is always 2*(w+l-2) because each non-corner cell is counted once and each corner cell is counted once (assigned to one side).\n\n      For a fixed assignment, the four segments have lengths:\n\n          top: l - c1,   where c1 in {0,1} (0 if we don't include the top-right corner, 1 if we do) -> but wait, if we include the top-left corner in the top, then the top has an extra cell? \n          Actually, the top side has: \n             if we include the top-left corner and not the top-right, then length = l - 0? \n          This is very messy.\n\n      Insight from known solutions to this problem: \n          The valid a are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that also satisfy at least one of the following conditions:\n\n          condition1: a | (w-2) and a | (l)   [doesn't seem]\n\n      Known approach in the code given: \n          The given code for program2.py:\n\n              from math import sqrt, floor\n              from sys import stdin\n\n              data = [int(x) for x in stdin.read().split()[1:]]\n              res = []\n              for w, l in zip(data[::2], data[1::2]):\n                  half_perimeter = w + l - 2\n                  solutions = {1, 2}\n                  for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                      div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n                      if mod_i != 0:\n                          continue\n                      for a in [i, div]:\n                          mod_a = w % a\n                          if mod_a <= 2:\n                              # TODO: Your code here\n                  res.append(f\"{len(solutions)} {' '.join(map(str, sorted(solutions)))}\")\n              print('\\n'.join(res))\n\n          We see:\n              half_perimeter = w + l - 2   [which is not the half, it is actually the total perimeter in terms of edges? but the boundary in cells is 2*(w+l-2)].\n\n          Then they iterate i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) and then consider a = i and a = half_perimeter // i.\n\n          For each a, they check: \n              mod_a = w % a\n              if mod_a <= 2:\n                  then they do something in the TODO.\n\n          What is TODO? \n\n          The valid a must be such that the boundary can be partitioned into segments of length a.

What does that mean?\n\n          Then they might be checking something else.\n\n          The total boundary area is 2*(w+l-2). But they use half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n          Why half_perimeter? \n\n          The total boundary in cells is 2*(w+l-2). So the divisors of the total boundary are the divisors of 2*(w+l-2). But they are iterating over the divisors of w+l-2.\n\n          This is not the same.\n\n          Unless they are considering a to be a divisor of w+l-2, and then also a divisor of the total boundary? \n\n          Note: if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then it is a divisor of 2*(w+l-2) only if a is even? not necessarily.\n\n          For example, if half_perimeter=6, then a=3 is a divisor of 6, and 2*6=12, and 3 is a divisor of 12.\n\n          In fact, if a divides half_perimeter, then it divides 2*half_perimeter.\n\n          So they are iterating over the divisors of half_perimeter, and then also the divisors of 2*half_perimeter might be covered? \n\n          But note: the divisors of 2*half_perimeter include divisors that are not divisors of half_perimeter (like 2*half_perimeter itself).\n\n          The given code does not consider divisors beyond sqrt(half_perimeter) for the larger ones? \n\n          They do: for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter))+1), and then for each i that divides half_perimeter, they consider a = i and a = half_perimeter//i.\n\n          This will iterate over all divisors of half_perimeter.\n\n          Then they have an additional condition: if w % a <= 2.\n\n          What then in the TODO? \n\n          We see that the solutions set initially has 1 and 2. Then they are adding more a's.\n\n          The condition if w % a <= 2 might be for one of the conditions. \n\n          Known conditions from the geometry:\n\n          The tile a can be used if the boundary can be partitioned into parts of length a. This is possible if and only if a is a divisor of the total boundary (2*(w+l-2)) and one of the following holds:\n\n            1. w % a == 0\n            2. (w-1) % a == 0\n            3. (w-2) % a == 0\n            and similarly for l, but in combination.\n\n          Specifically, the known solution for this problem is to check the following conditions:\n\n            a is a divisor of 2*(w+l-2) and \n            ( \n              (w % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \n              ((w-1) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \n              (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \n              ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \n              ( (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 ) \n            )\n\n          But note: the example w=3, l=5, a=3:\n            2*(3+5-2)=12, and 3|12 -> true.\n            then condition: \n               w % a = 3 % 3 = 0, (l-1) % a = 4 % 3 = 1 -> not 0.\n               (w-1) % a = 2 % 3 = 2, l % a = 5 % 3 = 2 -> not 0.\n               w % a =0, (l-2) % a = 3 % 3 =0 -> true.\n\n          So a=3 is valid.\n\n          a=2:\n             condition: \n               w % a = 3 % 2 = 1, (l-1)=4 %2=0 -> then we need the condition (w % a ==0 and (l-1)%a==0) -> not met.\n               (w-1)%a=2%2=0, l%a=5%2=1 -> not met.\n               w%a=1, (l-2)%a=3%2=1 -> not met.\n               (w-2)%a=1%2=1, l%a=5%2=1 -> not met.\n               (w-1)%a=0, (l-1)%a=4%2=0 -> true.\n\n          a=1: obviously.\n\n          a=4: \n             condition: \n               try: \n                 (w %4 = 3, (l-1)=4 -> 0) -> not both.\n                 (w-1)%4=2, l%4=1 -> not.\n                 w%4=3, (l-2)=3 -> 3 -> not.\n                 (w-2)%4=1, l%4=1 -> not.\n                 (w-1)%4=2, (l-1)%4=0 -> not both.\n             -> not valid.\n\n          a=6: \n             condition: \n                 w%6=3, (l-1)=4 -> not.\n                 (w-1)=2, l=5 -> not.\n                 w=3, (l-2)=3 -> 3%6=3, not 0.\n                 (w-2)=1, l=5 -> not.\n                 (w-1)=2, (l-1)=4 -> not both 0.\n             -> not valid.\n\n          a=12: similarly not.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is: a is a divisor of 2*(w+l-2) and [ (w % a ==0 and (l-2)%a==0) or ((w-1)%a==0 and (l-1)%a==0) or ... (all five) ]\n\n          But the given code does not have this. \n\n          Given code:\n\n            solutions = {1,2}\n            for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n                if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n                for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                    mod_a = w % a\n                    if mod_a <= 2:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          What is TODO? \n\n          They might be checking one of the conditions. \n\n          The condition \"mod_a = w % a <= 2\" is true if the remainder when w is divided by a is 0,1, or 2.\n\n          This matches the conditions above: because in the conditions we have (w % a ==0), ((w-1)%a==0) -> which is equivalent to (w % a ==1) or (w % a == a-1) if we consider modulo, but note (w-1)%a==0 means w%a==1.\n\n          However, the condition in the if is mod_a<=2, which catches w%a=0,1,2.\n\n          But we also need to check the l part. \n\n          In the TODO, we might then check the l part. \n\n          So the TODO might be:\n\n             if mod_a == 0:\n                 if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or (l) % a == 0: \n                     then add a.\n             if mod_a == 1:\n                 if (l-1) % a == 0 or ... ?\n\n          But the known conditions are combinations. \n\n          Alternatively, we can check the five conditions for a.\n\n          So in the TODO, we might do:\n\n             if (w % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n                ((w-1) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n                (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n                ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n                ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0):\n                 solutions.add(a)\n\n          But note: the condition (w % a ==0) is mod_a==0.\n          (w-1) % a ==0 -> then w % a = 1.\n          (w-2) % a ==0 -> then w % a = 2.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n             if ( (mod_a == 0 and ( (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or (l) % a == 0 ) ) or \n                  (mod_a == 1 and ( (l-1) % a == 0 or l % a == 0 ) ) or \n                  (mod_a == 2 and ( (l) % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0 ) ) \n                ): \n                 solutions.add(a)\n\n          But wait, the conditions are pairwise. Let's map:\n\n             condition1: (w % a ==0 and (l-1) % a ==0) -> mod_a==0 and (l-1)%a==0.\n             condition2: ((w-1)%a==0 and l%a==0) -> mod_a==1 and l%a==0.\n             condition3: (w % a ==0 and (l-2)%a==0) -> mod_a==0 and (l-2)%a==0.\n             condition4: ((w-2)%a==0 and l%a==0) -> mod_a==2 and l%a==0.\n             condition5: ((w-1)%a==0 and (l-1)%a==0) -> mod_a==1 and (l-1)%a==0.\n\n          So we need to check specifically.\n\n          Therefore, we can do in the TODO:\n\n             if mod_a == 0:\n                 if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0:\n                     solutions.add(a)\n             if mod_a == 1:\n                 if l % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0:\n                     solutions.add(a)\n             if mod_a == 2:\n                 if l % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0:   # note: condition4: (w-2)%a==0 and l%a==0 -> then we have mod_a=2 and l%a==0 -> covered.\n                     solutions.add(a)\n\n          But wait, condition3: (w % a==0 and (l-2)%a==0) -> in mod_a==0, we are checking (l-2)%a==0 -> covered.\n          condition1: (l-1)%a==0 -> covered in mod_a==0.\n          condition2: in mod_a==1 and l%a==0 -> covered.\n          condition4: in mod_a==2 and l%a==0 -> covered.\n          condition5: in mod_a==1 and (l-1)%a==0 -> covered.\n\n          However, condition3 requires both w%a==0 and (l-2)%a==0. In our if, if mod_a==0 and (l-2)%a==0, then we add. But what if only (l-2)%a==0 and not the other conditions? we add. But condition3 requires both. \n\n          But wait, mod_a==0 means w%a==0. So if mod_a==0 and (l-2)%a==0, then condition3 is satisfied.\n\n          Similarly, condition1: if mod_a==0 and (l-1)%a==0, then condition1 is satisfied.\n\n          So we are checking the conditions.\n\n          But note: in mod_a==0, we are also including the condition (l) % a ==0? -> not in the conditions above. Should we include it? \n\n          condition not in the list: (w%a==0 and l%a==0) -> is that valid? \n\n          Let's check: \n             If w%a==0 and l%a==0, then we can tile the boundary? \n             The boundary has four segments: \n                 top: l -> divisible by a.\n                 right: w-1 -> might not be.\n             So probably not.\n\n          Therefore, we should not include it.\n\n          But the conditions we have in the if above for mod_a==0 are only (l-1) and (l-2). \n\n          Similarly, for mod_a==1, we are including if l%a==0 or (l-1)%a==0. \n             - If l%a==0, then condition2: (w-1)%a==0 and l%a==0 -> valid.\n             - If (l-1)%a==0, then condition5: (w-1)%a==0 and (l-1)%a==0 -> valid.\n\n          For mod_a==2, we are including if l%a==0 or (l-1)%a==0.\n             - If l%a==0, then condition4: (w-2)%a==0 and l%a==0 -> valid.\n             - If (l-1)%a==0, then what condition? \n                 condition not in the list: (w-2)%a==0 and (l-1)%a==0 -> is that valid? \n\n          Let me try: w=5, l=5, a=3: \n             w%a = 5%3=2, (l-1)%a=4%3=1 -> not.\n             conditions: \n                 condition1: w%3=2, not0.\n                 condition2: (w-1)%3=4%3=1, l%3=2 -> not.\n                 condition3: w%3=2, not0.\n                 condition4: (w-2)%3=3%3=0, l%3=2 -> not.\n                 condition5: (w-1)%3=1, (l-1)%3=1 -> not 0.\n             -> not valid.\n\n          So only the conditions we listed.\n\n          Therefore, in the TODO, we do:\n\n             if mod_a == 0:\n                 if (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0:\n                     solutions.add(a)\n             elif mod_a == 1:\n                 if l % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0:\n                     solutions.add(a)\n             elif mod_a == 2:\n                 if l % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0:\n                     solutions.add(a)\n\n          But note: a might be 1, but we already have 1 in the set.\n\n          However, the for loop starts at i=2, and then a can be 2 and then we might add 2 again? but set will not duplicate.\n\n          Also, they iterate a in [i, half_perimeter//i] -> and half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n          But note: the conditions involve modulo with a, and a might be greater than w or l? \n             For example, if a > w, then w%a = w, which is >2, so we skip.\n          So we are safe.\n\n          But what if a is 2? \n             In the for loop: i from 2 to floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)), and if half_perimeter is even, then a=2 will be caught by i=2.\n             Then mod_a = w % 2.\n             if w is even: mod_a=0 -> then we check: (l-1)%2 and (l-2)%2.\n             if w is odd: mod_a=1 -> then we check: l%2 and (l-1)%2.\n\n          Example: w=3, l=5, a=2:\n             mod_a = 3%2=1 -> then we check: l%2=5%2=1 -> true, so we add 2.\n\n          But 2 is already in the set.\n\n          So we might be adding duplicates. But set takes care.\n\n          However, the for loop might not catch all divisors? because they only iterate over the divisors of half_perimeter, but the total boundary is 2*half_perimeter. \n\n          We might be missing divisors that are divisors of 2*half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter. For example, if half_perimeter=6, then 4 is a divisor of 12 (which is 2*6) but not of 6. \n\n          How to catch those? \n\n          The known conditions require a to be a divisor of the total boundary? but in our conditions above, we only require a to be such that the modulo conditions hold. We do not explicitly require a to be a divisor of the total boundary. \n\n          However, the modulo conditions might be necessary and sufficient regardless of the total boundary? \n\n          But the known solution in other languages also iterates over the divisors of the total boundary.\n\n          Given the constraints (w, l up to 1e9), the total boundary is up to 2e9, and the number of divisors is about O(sqrt(2e9)) which is around 1e5, which is acceptable because the total output is at most 200000 integers.\n\n          But the given code only iterates over the divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n          To catch all divisors of the total boundary (2*(w+l-2)), we should iterate over the divisors of 2*(w+l-2).\n\n          However, the given code does not do that.\n\n          The given code has: half_perimeter = w+l-2.\n\n          And then iterates over the divisors of half_perimeter.\n\n          So we are missing the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that are not divisors of w+l-2.\n\n          For example, if w+l-2=6, then the divisors of 12 that are not divisors of 6 are: 4, 12.\n\n          So we need to also consider the divisors of 2*(w+l-2) that are not divisors of w+l-2.\n\n          How to do that in the given code? \n\n          We might change the for loop to iterate over the divisors of 2*(w+l-2). \n\n          But the problem says: the given code has a TODO only in the if block.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do in the TODO: also consider a*2? \n\n          Given the time, and since the problem says the output has at most 200000 integers, we can simply iterate over the divisors of 2"
