    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is the length of the subarray multiplied by the sign of its sum (positive: +length, negative: -length, zero: 0).\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to compute the maximum value. The key idea is to use DP where dp[i] is the maximum value we can get for the prefix ending at i.\n\nThe code already sets up:\n- pref: prefix sums array (0-indexed, pref[0]=0, pref[i] = a0+a1+...+a{i-1})\n- It sorts the prefix sums for coordinate compression (to use in Fenwick trees) in two ways: \n   spos: sorted by (pref[i], -i)  [for positive?]\n   sneg: sorted by (pref[i], i)   [for negative?]\n- It then creates two Fenwick trees: pfen and nfen.\n\nThe DP recurrence is:\n   dp[i] = max( \n        i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]), \n        nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i, \n        dmx.get(pref[i], -INF) \n   )\n\nThen it updates the Fenwick trees and the dictionary dmx.\n\nHowever, there is a TODO in the loop: \n   if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should update dmx for the current prefix sum. Specifically, we want to keep the maximum dp[i] for each prefix sum value. So we update:\n   dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut note: the code already uses dmx in the recurrence. The recurrence has three cases:\n   1. We break the partition at i and the last segment is positive? (then we get i - (some index) as length? but the recurrence uses i + ... which is unclear)\n   2. Similarly for negative?\n   3. Or we can have a segment that starts at a point j with the same prefix sum (so the segment from j to i has sum 0, which gives 0, so then dp[i] = dp[j] + 0).\n\nActually, the recurrence is known from similar problems (like \"Maximum Subarray Sum\" with variations). The three cases are:\n   - If we consider a segment ending at i that is positive: then we want to find j such that pref[i] - pref[j] > 0, i.e., pref[j] < pref[i]. Then the value of the segment [j+1, i] is (i-j). Then dp[i] = dp[j] + (i-j).\n        => dp[i] = dp[j] - j + i = i + (dp[j]-j)\n        => so we want to maximize (dp[j]-j) for j with pref[j] < pref[i].\n\n   - If the segment is negative: then we want pref[j] > pref[i]. Then the value is -(i-j) = j-i. Then dp[i] = dp[j] + (j-i) = (dp[j]+j) - i.\n        => so we want to maximize (dp[j]+j) for j with pref[j] > pref[i].\n\n   - If the segment has sum 0: then the value is 0, so dp[i] = dp[j] for j with pref[j] = pref[i].\n\nThe code uses:\n   pfen: which stores (dp[j]-j) for j, and we query for indices j (with j < i) such that pref[j] < pref[i]. The Fenwick tree is built on the order of the prefix sums (spos: sorted by pref and then by -index). The ordpos[i] gives the rank of the prefix at i in the sorted list spos.\n\n   Similarly, nfen: stores (dp[j]+j) for j, and we query for indices j with pref[j] > pref[i]. The ordneg[i] gives the rank of the prefix at i in the sorted list sneg (which is sorted by pref and then by index). Then we do n+1 - ordneg[i] to reverse the order so that we can use a Fenwick tree for maximum over a range? (because Fenwick tree typically does from 1 to x, so we reverse the order for the condition pref[j] > pref[i] becomes a prefix in the reversed array).\n\nAlso, the recurrence uses dmx: which is a dictionary that stores the maximum dp[j] for a given prefix sum. So for the same prefix sum, we can do dp[i] = max(dp[i], dmx[pref[i]]).\n\nTherefore, in the TODO, we should update dmx for the current prefix sum pref[i] with the current dp[i]. So:\n\n   if pref[i] in dmx:\n        if dp[i] > dmx[pref[i]]:\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n   else:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code already has an entry for dmx[0]=0 at the beginning (for index0). So we can write:\n\n   dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\nHowever, the problem constraints are large, so we must be cautious. But the code already uses -INF (which is 1<<30, about 2e9). The dp[i] might be as large as 500000 (if all positive) but the numbers can be negative too. However, 1<<30 is 1e9 which is safe because n<=500000, so the maximum absolute value of dp[i] is at most 500000.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, so we are safe.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n   dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\nBut we can write it as:\n   if pref[i] in dmx:\n        if dp[i] > dmx[pref[i]]:\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n   else:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the code already has an if condition: \"if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\", so we can simply set:\n   dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBecause the condition is already checking that dp[i] is greater than the current value. So we can do:\n\n   dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: it is possible that there are multiple j with the same prefix sum, and we want the maximum dp[j] for that prefix. The recurrence uses dmx.get(pref[i], -INF) to get the current best. Then when we compute dp[i] we consider that best. Then if we get a new dp[i] that is greater than the current best, we update the best.\n\nSo the missing line is:\n   dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut wait: what if there was already a higher dp[j] for the same prefix? Then we wouldn't update? Actually, the condition is \"if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)\", so we only update when we have a new maximum.\n\nSo we can write:\n   dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the dictionary dmx might not have the key? Then we set it. So that's safe.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n   dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the code already has an if condition, so we only update when we have a new maximum.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: We have an array a and we want to know if we can achieve it by the operations. The operations:\n   - Move forward: if not last, increase current by 1 and move to next.\n   - Move backward: if not first, decrease current by 1 and move to previous.\n\nAnd the pointer must end at the first element.\n\nWe are given test cases. The code already does:\n   if the array is all zeros: print 'Yes'\n   else: \n        while the last element is zero: pop it (because trailing zeros don't matter and we must end at the first element, so the last element must be zero? Actually, the pointer ends at the first element, so the last element cannot be visited after the last operation? But note: we can have intermediate zeros at the end. However, the problem says: after we are done, the pointer is on the first element. So the operations that go to the last element must be undone? Therefore, the last element must be zero? Actually, no: we can have non-zero at the end? But the example: [0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0] (then pointer at second) -> [1,-1,0,0] (then pointer at first) -> then we go to second again: [1,0,0,0] -> then to third: [1,0,0,0] (but then we are at third, and we cannot leave the last element non-zero? Actually, the example in the note: \n   The second test case: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> and they pop the last zero? So the code does: while c[-1]==0: c.pop(). Then the array becomes [2, -1, -1].\n\nThen the code sets g=0 and then does:\n   while len(c)-1:   # meaning while the array has at least 2 elements?\n        if g<=c[-1]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        g = g - c.pop()\n\nThen finally checks: g==c[0] and k (which is initially 1) and then prints.\n\nBut note: the variable k is set to 1 at the beginning. Then we have a while loop that pops the last element until it's non-zero. Then we have a while loop that runs until the array has more than one element? Actually, the condition is \"while len(c)-1\", which is equivalent to \"while len(c)>1\".\n\nThe idea of the solution:\n\nWe note:\n   - The entire process must end at the first element. So the net movement: the pointer starts at 0 and ends at 0. The moves: \n        forward: +1 to current and then move right (so the next element is visited and we are at the next index)\n        backward: -1 to current and then move left.\n\n   Let the array be a[0..n-1]. We can model the operations as:\n        Let x_i be the number of times we move from i to i+1 (forward) and y_i the number of times we move from i to i-1 (backward). Then:\n          a[0] = x_0 - y_1   (because we start at 0: we leave 0 by going forward (x0 times) and we come to 0 from 1 (y1 times) -> but note: we also have the initial state? Actually, the operations: \n          When we are at i and we do a forward: we add 1 to a[i] and then go to i+1.\n          When we are at i and we do a backward: we subtract 1 from a[i] and then go to i-1.\n\n        Also, the net flow:\n          For the first element: \n             we leave by forward: x0 times, and we come from the right: y1 times? Actually, we start at 0 and we end at 0. The number of times we leave 0 is x0, and the number of times we come to 0 is y1 (from index1). So the net change at 0: \n                 a[0] = x0 - y1\n          For the last element: \n                 a[n-1] = x_{n-1} - y_{n-1}? \n          But note: we never leave the last element by forward? Actually, we can only leave the last element by backward? And we never come to the last element by forward? Actually, we come to the last element by forward from n-2? \n\n        Actually, for index i (0-indexed, and i from 0 to n-1):\n          a[i] = (number of times we entered i by forward from i-1) + (number of times we entered i by backward from i+1) - (number of times we left i by forward) - (number of times we left i by backward)\n\n        But note: we start at 0? Actually, the initial state is 0 and we do operations. Alternatively, we can model the entire process as:\n\n          Let f(i) = net number of times we have been at i and added (by forward) or subtracted (by backward). But note: \n            When we are at i and we do a forward: we add 1 to a[i] and then go to i+1 -> so we leave a[i] with +1 and then we are at i+1.\n            When we are at i and we do a backward: we subtract 1 from a[i] and then go to i-1.\n\n          Also, we start at 0: so we have an initial presence at 0? But we haven't done any operation at 0? Actually, the initial state is 0 for all, and then we do operations.\n\n          The net effect at i:\n            a[i] = (x_i) - (y_i)   [because each forward at i adds 1, each backward subtracts 1]\n\n          But also, the movement: \n            The number of times we enter i from the left (if i>0): that's x_{i-1} (because from i-1 we went forward to i)\n            The number of times we enter i from the right (if i<n-1): that's y_{i+1} (because from i+1 we went backward to i)\n\n          And the number of times we leave i: \n            forward: x_i (so we go to i+1)\n            backward: y_i (so we go to i-1)\n\n          The conservation of visits (except for the start and end) is:\n            For i=0: \n                start: 1 (initial) + y_1 (from index1) = x_0 (leaving to 1) + y_0? (but we cannot leave 0 to the left) -> actually, we cannot go left from 0? So y_0=0? \n                => 1 + y_1 = x_0\n            For i>0 and i<n-1:\n                x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i\n            For i=n-1:\n                x_{n-2} = y_{n-1} + (if we end at 0, then we are not at n-1 at the end? So we must leave n-1 by backward? But we end at 0, so the last operation must leave n-1? Actually, we end at 0, so the last operation must be a backward from 1 to 0? So the last element must be left? Actually, we don't require the last element to be zero? But the problem says the pointer ends at the first element.\n\n          However, note: we start at 0 and end at 0. The entire path must be a walk that starts and ends at 0.\n\n          We have:\n            a[0] = x_0 - y_0, but y_0=0? because we cannot go left from 0? -> so a[0] = x_0 - 0 = x_0.\n            But from the flow at 0: 1 + y_1 = x_0 + y_0 -> 1 + y_1 = x_0 -> so a[0] = 1 + y_1.\n\n          Similarly, for i=1 to n-2:\n            a[i] = x_i - y_i\n            and the flow: x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i.\n\n          For i=n-1:\n            a[n-1] = x_{n-1} - y_{n-1}\n            and the flow: x_{n-2} = x_{n-1} + y_{n-1}   (because we cannot leave by forward? Actually, we can leave by backward only? But we can also leave by forward? But the problem says: if the pointer is not on the last element, we can do forward. But if we are at the last element, we cannot do forward? So we can only do backward? So x_{n-1}=0? Then the flow: x_{n-2} = 0 + y_{n-1} -> so y_{n-1} = x_{n-2}. Then a[n-1] = 0 - y_{n-1} = -x_{n-2}.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to do any number of operations. The key constraints:\n            a[0] = 1 + y_1   -> so a[0] must be at least 1? \n            and for the last element: a[n-1] = -x_{n-2} -> so a[n-1] must be non-positive? \n\n          Actually, the example: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> then we pop the last zero -> [2,-1,-1]. Then:\n            a0 = 2 -> so 1+y1=2 -> y1=1.\n            For i=1: a1 = -1 = x1 - y1 -> x1 - 1 = -1 -> x1=0.\n            Flow at 1: x0 + y2 = x1 + y1 -> 2 (from a0: x0 = a0 = 2) + y2 = 0 + 1 -> 2+y2=1 -> y2=-1 -> impossible.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a greedy simulation from the end to the beginning.\n\n          Known solution for this problem:\n\n          Steps:\n            - The first element must be positive? Actually, from a0 = 1+y1, so a0>=1? But the example: [0, -2, 3] is given as a test case? Actually, the example in the note is the second test case: [0, -2, 3] -> but the problem says the array is [0, -2, 3] and they do an optimal partition? That note is for program1, not program2.\n\n          For program2, the example in the note: \n            Example 1: [0,0,0,0] -> yes? \n            Example 2: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> they pop the last zero -> [2,-1,-1] -> then the code does:\n\n            g=0\n            while len(c)>1:   # c = [2,-1,-1] -> len=3, so condition holds\n                if g<=c[-1]:   # g=0, c[-1]=-1 -> 0<=-1 -> false -> then g = g - c.pop() = 0 - (-1) = 1\n            Then we have c=[2,-1] and then the loop again: \n                if g<=c[-1]: g=1, c[-1]=-1 -> 1<=-1 -> false -> then g = 1 - (-1) = 2\n            Then c=[2] -> loop condition fails. Then we check: g==c[0]? 2==2 -> true, and k=1 -> so print 'Yes'\n\n          But what if we have [1, -2]? \n            Step1: pop trailing zeros? none. \n            Then while len(c)>1: \n                if g<=c[-1]: g=0, c[-1]=-2 -> 0<=-2 -> false -> then g = 0 - (-2) = 2, and pop -> c=[1]\n            Then check: g==c[0]? 2==1 -> false -> 'No'\n\n          How about [1, -1]? \n            g=0, then if 0<=-1? false -> g = 0 - (-1)=1, then c=[1] -> then 1==1 -> true -> 'Yes'\n\n          How about [3, -1, -2]? \n            Step1: no trailing zero -> c=[3,-1,-2]\n            Iteration1: g=0, c[-1]=-2 -> false -> g = 0 - (-2)=2, pop -> c=[3,-1]\n            Iteration2: g=2, c[-1]=-1 -> 2<=-1? false -> g = 2 - (-1)=3, pop -> c=[3]\n            Then check: g==3? -> true -> 'Yes'\n\n          How about [3, -2, -1]? \n            Iteration1: g=0, c[-1]=-1 -> false -> g=1, pop -> [3,-2]\n            Iteration2: g=1, c[-1]=-2 -> 1<=-2? false -> g=1-(-2)=3, pop -> [3] -> 3==3 -> 'Yes'\n\n          How about [1, 0, -1]? \n            First, pop trailing zeros? no, because last is -1. \n            Then: \n                Iteration1: g=0, c[-1]=-1 -> false -> g=1, pop -> [1,0]\n            Then we have [1,0]: but the code then pops trailing zeros? Actually, the initial step: we popped trailing zeros only at the beginning. Now we have [1,0] and we are in the while loop?

Actually, no: we can have positive last element? \n\n          But the condition: if g<=c[-1] then we break and set k=0. \n\n          Why? \n\n          After analysis, the condition g<=c[-1] is a failure condition? \n\n          Actually, the known solution in the code is:\n\n            We remove trailing zeros.\n            Then we set g=0.\n            Then while the array has more than one element:\n                if g <= current last element: then it's invalid? -> so we break and mark as invalid.\n                else: then we update g = g - last_element, and pop.\n\n            Then we check that the first element equals g and that we didn't break (k remains 1).\n\n          Why is the condition g<=c[-1] invalid? \n\n          Consider: \n            We are at the last element (which is non-zero). We are going to simulate backwards: \n                We are going to leave the last element by backward? Then we subtract the last element and then move to the previous. But the value we leave at the last element is negative? Actually, we subtract 1 when we leave by backward. \n\n          The known solution from the note: \n            [2, -1, -1] -> \n                Start at the last: -1 -> we do: g = 0 - (-1) = 1 -> then we require that the next element (which is -1) is at least 1? -> but -1<1 -> so we break? But the example didn't break.\n\n          Actually, the condition is the other way: the code does:\n\n            if g<=c[-1]:   # then break and set k=0\n\n          In the example [2,-1,-1]:\n            First: g=0, c[-1]=-1 -> 0<=-1 is false -> so we update g=0-(-1)=1 and pop -> then the array becomes [2,-1]\n            Then: g=1, c[-1]=-1 -> 1<=-1 is false -> update g=1-(-1)=2, pop -> [2] -> then check: g==2 -> true.\n\n          In the example [1,-2,1]:\n            First: g=0, c[-1]=1 -> 0<=1 -> true -> break and set k=0.\n\n          Why is that invalid? \n\n          The invariant: \n            g is the amount that the next element (to the left) must cover? \n\n          Actually, when we leave an element by backward, we subtract 1 from that element and then move left. The value we leave at the current element is negative? But we are going backwards: \n            We are at the last element: we require that we leave it by backward? But if the last element is positive, we cannot leave it by backward? because we would have to subtract 1, but then we would make it less than the desired positive? \n\n          However, we can also have visited the last element multiple times? \n\n          The known solution: \n            We start at the last element. We are going to simulate the backward moves. \n            Let g be the number of times we have to enter the current element from the right? (which is the same as the number of times we leave the current element by backward? because we are going backwards).\n\n          Actually, the value at the last element must be negative? because we can only leave it by backward? and each time we leave by backward we subtract 1. And we start at the last element? But we start at the first element. \n\n          Alternatively, we can think: \n            The last element must be non-positive? because the only way to leave the last element is by backward (which subtracts 1) and we must leave it to go back to the first element? \n\n          But the example [2,-1,-1] has a last element of -1 (which is negative) -> valid.\n\n          The example [1,-2,1] has a last element of 1 (positive) -> then we cannot leave it? because to leave we must subtract 1, but then it becomes 0, but we need 1? \n\n          So the condition: if the last element is positive, then we cannot leave it? so it's invalid? \n\n          But note: we can visit the last element multiple times? \n            We can come to the last element, then leave by backward (so we subtract 1 and move left), then come again? \n\n          However, the value at the last element is the net: (number of times we added 1 by forward) - (number of times we subtracted 1 by backward). \n\n          And the net must be positive? \n\n          But the problem: we start at the first element and end at the first element. The last element must be left at least once? because we are not ending there. So the net at the last element must be negative? \n\n          Actually, the net at the last element: \n            a[last] = (# of times we did forward at last) - (# of times we did backward at last)\n\n          But we cannot do forward at last? so a[last] = - (# of times we did backward at last) -> so a[last] must be non-positive.\n\n          Therefore, the last element must be non-positive. \n\n          But the code removes trailing zeros? so the last element is non-zero? then it must be negative? \n\n          However, the condition in the code is: if g<=c[-1] -> then break. \n\n          And g is initially 0. Then if the last element is positive, we break. But we already know the last element must be non-positive? so why do we have this condition? \n\n          Actually, after the first pop, the last element is no longer the original last? \n\n          The invariant: \n            g: the number of times we will have to visit the next element (to the left) from the current element? \n\n          And the current element must be at least g? because we are going to leave the current element by backward g times? and each time we subtract 1. So the net at the current element would be: \n             (the value we are going to set) = (the current value) - g \n          But we are going to set the current element to a value that is at least 0? \n\n          Actually, the known solution: \n            We are going backwards. We let g be the number of times we have to leave the current element to the left? \n            Then the current element must be reduced by g? so the value before we started leaving must be at least g? \n\n          But the current element is given as a_i. Then we require a_i >= g? \n          Then we update g = g - (a_i - g) ? \n\n          Actually, the update is: g = g - a_i? \n\n          But the code does: g = g - a_i (after popping).\n\n          And the condition is: if g<=a_i -> then we break? \n\n          But if a_i is negative, then g - a_i = g + |a_i|, which is increasing? \n\n          The condition g<=a_i: \n            If a_i is negative, then g<=a_i is false (because g>=0 and a_i<0) -> then we update g = g - a_i (which is g + |a_i|) and then move to the next.\n\n          If a_i is positive, then we break? \n\n          But we know the last element must be non-positive? so the first element we process (the last of the array) must be non-positive? so the condition g<=a_i (with g=0) becomes 0<=a_i. If a_i is positive, we break. If a_i is negative, we update g to |a_i|.\n\n          Then the next element (to the left) must be at least g? \n\n          Example [2,-1,-1]: \n            Start: g=0, last element=-1 -> 0<=-1? false -> g = 0 - (-1) = 1.\n            Then the next last element is -1 -> now g=1, and we check: 1<=-1? false -> g = 1 - (-1)=2.\n            Then the next element is 2 -> then we break the while loop? because we are at the last element? Then we check: g==2? -> true.\n\n          But what if we have [1, -1, -1]? \n            After popping zeros: [1,-1,-1]\n            g=0, last=-1 -> false -> g=1\n            then g=1, last=-1 -> false -> g=2\n            then we have [1] -> check: g==1? -> true -> 'Yes'\n\n          But [1,-1,-1] is impossible? \n            a0=1: x0-y1=1 -> x0=1+y1.\n            a1=-1: x1-y1 = -1 -> x1 = y1-1.\n            a2=-1: x2-y2 = -1 -> and x2=0 (last) -> y2=1.\n            Flow at1: x0 + y2 = x1 + y1 -> (1+y1) + 1 = (y1-1) + y1 -> 2+y1 = 2*y1-1 -> 3 = y1 -> then x0=1+3=4.\n            Flow at2: x1 = y2 -> (y1-1)=1 -> 3-1=1 -> 2=1 -> false.\n\n          So it is impossible. \n\n          But the code says 'Yes'. \n\n          What's the issue? \n\n          The final check: g==c[0]? \n            In [1,-1,-1]: g=2, c[0]=1 -> 2==1 -> false -> 'No'\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, the condition in the while loop: \n            if g<=c[-1]: \n                k=0\n                break\n\n          And then after the while loop, we check that g equals the first element and that k is still 1.\n\n          So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            k = 0\n            break\n\n          But note: the variable k is initially 1. We set it to 0 to mark failure.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          And for program2.py is:\n            k = 0\n            break\n\n          We output in JSON: \n            {\"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\", \"program2\": \"k = 0\\n            break\"}\n\n          But note: in program1.py, the code is indented. We are inside:\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we must indent accordingly.\n\n          However, the problem says: output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n          For program1.py, the missing code is one line: \n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          For program2.py, the missing code is two lines (because we break):\n                k = 0\n                break\n\n          But note: the TODO in program2.py is inside the if block, so we write:\n\n            k = 0\n            break\n\n          with the same indentation as the if.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n            \"program2\": \"                k = 0\\n                break\"\n          }\n\n          But wait: in program1.py, the existing code has 8 spaces for the inner block? The if is inside a for loop that is indented by 4, then the if is indented by 8, then the TODO is at 12? \n\n          Actually, the code:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n                pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n                nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The TODO is at 16 spaces? \n\n          We can write:\n\n            for program1: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"   (with 8 spaces)\n\n          But the existing code uses 4-space indentation? \n\n          Actually, the code:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                ...   # 4 spaces for the for block, then 8 for the inner\n\n          The if is at 8 spaces, then the TODO is at 12? \n\n          But the TODO is a comment. We need to write the code at the same level as the if.\n\n          Actually, the if block:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to write:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          So the missing code is one line: \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" with 8 spaces? \n\n          But the existing code has 4-space indentation? \n\n          The entire code:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                ...   # 4 spaces for the for, then 8 for the inner\n                ...   # 8\n                ...   # 8\n                if ...:   # 8\n                    ...   # 12\n\n          So the missing line should be at 12 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the code in the problem is:\n\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we need to write at the same indentation as the comment: 4 more spaces? \n\n          But the for loop is at 4, then the if is at 8, then the body of the if is at 12.\n\n          So the missing code for program1 is:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          with 8 spaces? Actually, 12 spaces? \n\n          Let me count:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):   # 4\n                ...   # 8\n                ...   # 8\n                ...   # 8\n                if ...:   # 8\n                    ...   # 12\n\n          So we write: 12 spaces? \n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. We can write the exact line that goes in the TODO.\n\n          For program1: the missing line is: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" (with 8 spaces? but actually 12? because the if is at 8, then the body is 12)\n\n          How about we write: \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" with 4 spaces? That would be 8 in total? \n\n          Actually, the entire code uses 4-space indentation. The for loop is at 4, then the inner block is 8, then the if is at 8, then the body of the if is 12.\n\n          So we write: 12 spaces? \n\n          But the problem does not require the exact indentation? It says \"Output only the missing code\". We must output the code that exactly replaces the TODO.\n\n          The TODO is at the same level as the body of the if. So we write:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          with 4 spaces of indentation relative to the if? \n\n          Actually, the if is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for), then the body is 12. So the line should be:\n\n            \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          with 12 spaces? \n\n          But to be safe, we can count the spaces in the provided code. The provided code for program1.py has:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The \"# TODO\" is at 12 spaces? \n\n          We replace the comment with:\n\n                    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          So the missing code for program1 is: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" but with 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the if is at 8 spaces (because the for loop is at 4, then the if is indented 4 more -> 8) and then the body is 4 more -> 12. \n\n          But the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire block. So we output the line that goes in the body: \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" with the same indentation as the TODO comment.\n\n          How many spaces? The TODO comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n          We can write: 12 spaces? \n\n          But the problem does not specify. However, the existing code uses 4-space indentation. \n\n          Alternatively, we can output without worrying about the exact number of spaces? But the problem says the code must run.\n\n          We must output the exact string that replaces the TODO.\n\n          The TODO is:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace it with:\n\n                    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          So the missing code for program1 is: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" but wait: the existing code has 8 spaces for the if and 12 for the body? \n\n          Actually, the code:\n\n            ... (for loop at 4 spaces)\n                ... (8 spaces)\n                if ...:   (8 spaces)\n                    # TODO: ...   (12 spaces)\n\n          So we write: 12 spaces? \n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. So we output the line that is the body: \n\n            \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          with 8 spaces? That would be 8 spaces from the beginning of the line? \n\n          Actually, the entire line in the program would be:\n\n                    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          which is 12 spaces? \n\n          How to count: \n            The for loop: 4 spaces\n            The if: 4 more -> 8\n            The body: 4 more -> 12\n\n          So we write 12 spaces? \n\n          But the problem does not require the entire line? It requires the code that goes in the TODO. We can write:\n\n            \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          with 4 spaces? That would be 8 in total? \n\n          Actually, the body of the if must be indented by 4 relative to the if. So we write:\n\n            \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          But then the total indentation would be 8 (if) + 4 (body) = 12? \n\n          However, when we output the string, we output the exact string that would be placed. \n\n          Since the problem does not specify the exact indentation, and the existing code uses 4-space indentation, we can assume:\n\n            The missing code for program1 is: \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\" (with 4 spaces)\n\n          But note: the existing line above the TODO is at 8 spaces, and the if is at 8 spaces, and the body is at 12. So we need 12 spaces? \n\n          Alternatively, we can output:\n\n            \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          with 8 spaces? \n\n          But 8 spaces is two levels (each level 4). \n\n          Actually, the for loop is at level1 (4 spaces), the if is at level2 (8 spaces), and the body is at level3 (12 spaces). \n\n          So we write 12 spaces? \n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. We are replacing one line (the TODO comment) with one line of code. The TODO comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n          We output: a string with 12 spaces and then the code? \n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact string. But to be safe, we output the code that is at the same indentation as the comment. \n\n          We can write: \n\n            program1: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"   # but this is 8 spaces? \n\n          Let me check: \n\n            The for loop: 4\n            The if: 8\n            The body: 12\n\n          So 12 spaces: \n\n            program1: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          with 12 spaces at the beginning.\n\n          Similarly, for program2:\n\n            The TODO is inside:\n\n                while len(c)-1:\n                    if g<=c[-1]:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            The while is at 8 spaces (because the else: is at 4, then the while is at 8, then the if is at 12, then the body of the if is at 16.\n\n          So the missing code for program2 is two lines:\n\n                        k = 0\n                        break\n\n          with 16 spaces each? \n\n          But we can write:\n\n            program2: \"                k = 0\\n                break\"\n\n          with 16 spaces? \n\n          However, the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program. And the example output format is JSON.\n\n          We'll output:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n              \"program2\": \"                k = 0\\n                break\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the newline in program2.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output without the exact spaces? But the problem requires the code to run.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify the exact indentation, and the existing code uses consistent 4-space indentation, we can output:\n\n            program1: 12 spaces: \"            \" (12 spaces) is 3 tabs? but we don't know. \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n          We must output the exact code that would be placed in the TODO.\n\n          For program1: the line that replaces the TODO comment is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          and it must be at the same indentation as the TODO comment. The TODO comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n          How many spaces? The provided code in the problem for program1.py has:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The \"# TODO\" is at 8 spaces? or 12? \n\n          Actually, the if is at 8 spaces (because the for loop is at 4, then the if is 4 more) and the body of the if is 4 more -> 12. \n\n          So we write 12 spaces: 12 spaces is 12 ' '.\n\n          Similarly, for program2: the TODO is at 16 spaces? \n\n          The code:\n\n                while len(c)-1:\n                    if g<=c[-1]:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The while is at 8 spaces (because the else: is at 4, then the while is 4 more -> 8), then the if is 4 more -> 12, then the body of the if is 4 more -> 16.\n\n          So we write two lines:\n\n            \"                k = 0\"\n            \"                break\"\n\n          Therefore, the answer:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n            \"program2\": \"                k = 0\\n                break\"\n          }\n\n          But note: the string for program1 has 12 spaces? Actually, 12 spaces is 12 times ' '. \n\n          We can write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",   # 12 spaces: 12-8=4? wait, 12 spaces is 12 characters.\n\n          Actually, 12 spaces is: \n            \"\" \n            -> count: 12\n\n          But the if body is at 12 spaces? \n\n          Alternatively, we can output without the spaces and let the existing indentation handle it? \n\n          But the problem says: output the missing code. We must output the exact line.\n\n          I think the safest is to output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\n          Since we cannot know the exact number of spaces, we rely on the fact that the code uses 4-space indentation and the structure:\n\n          For program1:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                ...   # 4 spaces for the for block (so 4+4=8 for the inner lines)\n                ...   # 8\n                ...   # 8\n                if ...:   # 8\n                    ...   # 12: the missing code\n\n          So we output for program1: a string with 12 spaces: \"            \" (which is 12 spaces) and then \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          But 12 spaces is 12 times space. \n\n          Similarly, for program2:\n\n            else:\n                g=0\n                while c[-1]==0:\n                    c.pop()\n                while len(c)-1:\n                    if g<=c[-1]:\n                        ...   # 16 spaces: the missing code\n\n          So we output two lines, each with 16 spaces and then the code.\n\n          However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is limited, so we don't worry about performance.\n\n          We output:\n\n            program1: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n            program2: \"                k = 0\\n                break\"\n\n          But note: in program2, the break must be at the same level as the assignment.\n\n          Let me write the exact strings:\n\n            program1: 12 spaces: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n            program2: \n                line1: 16 spaces: \"                k = 0\"\n                line2: 16 spaces: \"                break\"\n\n          So the program2 string: \"                k = 0\\n                break\"\n\n          Therefore, the final answer."
