It is at index3. Then we check: i=2, c=3 -> non-overlap: i < n - c - 1 -> 2 < 8 - 3 - 1 -> 2 < 4 -> true. Then we update mx = max(0, 2+3+2) = 7. How did we get c=3? We called: bisect_left(bw, 30, hi=len(bw)-2-2) -> hi=8-2-2=4. So we search in indices [0,4). In the slice bw[0:4] = [1,12,20,30] -> the first index where > =30 is index3. So we get c=3. So it works for this test case. Why? because the index we need (3) is in the range [0,4) (exclusive of 4) -> so 3 is included. But what if the candidate we need is at index n-i-2?",

Check a==bw[2] -> 3==3 -> true. Then update: mx = max(0, 2+2+2)=6. So it works. Example 3: [1,2,3,4] -> no way, so answer=0. We try: \n                i=0: a=1 -> hi=4-0-2=2 -> search in [0,2): bw[0]=4, bw[1]=7 -> first index>=1 is 0? because bw[0]=4>=1 -> c=0. Then check: a==bw[0]? 1==4 -> false.

Then we skip because of bounds in the first if? \n                boundary: 4-3-2=-1 -> skip. So mx remains 0. Example 4: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7. We already did: i=2, a=30, and the boundary candidate is at index4 (bw[4]=35) which is not 30, so we only rely on the first candidate: c=3 -> then update to 2+3+2=7.",

For each prefix sum a (which is the total weight Alice has eaten from the left up to the i-th candy, with i from 0 to n-1), it tries to find a prefix from the right (bw) such that the sum from the right is equal to a.\n\n  However, note that the two sequences of eaten candies must not overlap. So if Alice has eaten the first i+1 candies (from index 0 to i), then Bob must eat from the right starting at index j (where j>i) and he can eat up to n-1-j candies? Actually, Bob eats from the right: the last k candies (from index n-1 down to n-k). So the condition is that the segment Alice eats and the segment Bob eats must not overlap. That means that the last candy Alice eats must be strictly to the left of the first candy Bob eats.\n\n  In the code: \n      for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n          c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n\n  The hi parameter in bisect_left is set to len(bw)-i-2. Why? \n  Note: the array bw has length n (since it's the prefix of the reversed array). The condition for non-overlap: if Alice has eaten i+1 candies (from index0 to index i), then Bob must eat candies from the right that start at index n-1 and go left, but he cannot eat any candy that is at index i or left. So Bob can eat at most (n - (i+1)) candies. Therefore, in the array bw, we are only allowed to consider indices from 0 to (n-i-2) (because if Bob eats k candies, then k must be at most n-i-1? Actually, the number of candies Bob can eat without overlapping is at most n-i-1. But note: the array bw is the prefix of the reversed array, so the j-th element of bw is the sum of the last j+1 candies. So if we take bw[c], that corresponds to the last c+1 candies. To avoid overlap, we require that the segment of Bob (the last c+1 candies) does not include the first i+1 candies. Therefore, we must have: (i+1) + (c+1) <= n  => c <= n - i - 2. So the valid indices in bw for Bob are from 0 to n-i-2 (inclusive). Hence, the hi parameter is set to n-i-1 (because bisect_left uses hi as the exclusive upper bound) but note the code has hi=len(bw)-i-2 -> which is n-i-2? Actually, the hi parameter in bisect_left is the index at which to stop (exclusive). So we set hi = n - i - 1? But the code says hi=len(bw)-i-2 -> which is n-i-2. That would mean we are searching in the slice [0, n-i-2) (i.e., excluding n-i-2). But we want to include n-i-2? Actually, the condition in the bisect_left is that we are searching in the subarray bw[0: n-i-1] (because the hi index is exclusive). So we should set hi = n-i-1? \n\n  However, the code currently sets hi=len(bw)-i-2 -> which is n-i-2. That would exclude the element at index n-i-2? But note: the condition for non-overlap is that Bob can have at most n-i-1 candies? Actually, the maximum number of candies Bob can take without overlapping is n-i-1, so the maximum index in bw we can consider is (n-i-2) because the array bw has indices from 0 to n-1, and the element at index k in bw corresponds to k+1 candies. So if Bob takes k+1 candies, then we require k+1 <= n-i-1 -> k <= n-i-2. Therefore, we are only interested in indices 0 to n-i-2 (inclusive). So the hi parameter should be set to n-i-1 (exclusive) so that we search in the slice [0, n-i-1). But the code sets hi = n-i-2? That would be [0, n-i-2) -> which excludes n-i-2. \n\n  This seems off. Actually, the condition in the bisect_left call is:\n      c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n\n  The third argument in bisect_left is 'hi' which is the exclusive upper bound. So we are searching in the slice [0, n-i-2). But we want to include the index n-i-2? Then we should set hi = n-i-1.\n\n  However, note the note in the problem: the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so we can do a two-pointer as well? But the problem says the sum of n over test cases is <=200000, so we can do a loop for each test case and then a binary search for each prefix? That would be O(n log n) per test case? But note the constraint: the total n over test cases is 200000, so if we do a binary search for each prefix, that would be O(n log n) for one test case and then overall O( (sum of n) * log n) which is 200000 * log(200000) ~ 200000 * 18 = 3.6e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  But the current code has a bug: the hi parameter is set to n-i-2, which excludes the last valid index (n-i-2). We should change it to n-i-1? However, the problem says: \"hi=len(bw)-i-2\" and we are to complete the code. But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we are not allowed to change existing code? The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". So if the existing code is incorrect, we must fix it? But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". And we are only to output the missing code.\n\n  However, note the TODO: Your code here. We are to complete the part inside the if condition.\n\n  The if condition checks: if a==bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1). \n  Let's break down the condition:\n      a == bw[c] -> the weight Alice has (a) equals the weight Bob has (bw[c]).\n      i < (len(bw)-c-1) -> i < n - c - 1. \n      Why? len(bw)=n. So n-c-1 is the index in the original array? Actually, we need to check non-overlap: \n          Alice has taken the first i+1 candies (so up to index i).\n          Bob has taken the last c+1 candies (so from index n-1-c to n-1).\n          The condition for non-overlap is: i < n-1-c. \n          Because the next candy after Alice is at index i+1, and the next candy after Bob (toward the center) is at index n-1-c-1 = n-c-2. We require that the segments do not meet? Actually, they must not share any candy. So the last candy of Alice is at index i, and the first candy of Bob is at index n-1-c. We require i < n-1-c -> which is equivalent to i+1 <= n-1-c-1? Actually, we require that the two segments are disjoint: so the last index of Alice (i) must be strictly less than the first index of Bob (n-1-c). Therefore, we require i < n-1-c -> which is the same as i < n - c - 1.\n\n  So the condition is correct.\n\n  Now, if we found such a c, then the total number of candies eaten is (i+1) + (c+1) = i + c + 2.\n\n  And we want to maximize that.\n\n  So inside the if block, we should set:\n      mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n\n  But note: the variable c we get from bisect_left might not be the only one? Actually, bisect_left returns the first index >= a. So if there are multiple, we are only checking the first one? But note: we are iterating over i, and for each i we are checking one candidate c. However, it is possible that for a fixed i, there are multiple c such that bw[c] = a? But we are only checking the first one. However, we want the maximum total candies? Actually, for a fixed a (which is the weight Alice has taken for the first i+1 candies), we want to find the largest c (meaning the most candies Bob can take) such that bw[c] = a? But note: the array bw is non-decreasing (because the weights are positive). So if we have multiple c with the same value, we want the smallest c? Because the array bw is the prefix of the reversed array: the more candies Bob takes, the larger the sum. Actually, no: if Bob takes more candies, the sum increases. So if we have two indices c1 and c2 (c1 < c2) and bw[c1] = bw[c2] = a, that would be impossible because the array bw is strictly increasing? Because the weights are positive. So bw is strictly increasing. Therefore, there is at most one c such that bw[c] = a.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      if a == bw[c] and i < n - c - 1:\n          mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n\n  However, note: the bisect_left returns the first index where bw[c] >= a. It might be that bw[c] > a? Then we skip. But the condition checks a==bw[c]. So we are safe.\n\n  But what if there is no c such that bw[c] == a? Then we skip.\n\n  Also note: the bisect_left call: \n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n  This returns the smallest index c in the range [0, n-i-2) such that bw[c] >= a.\n\n  However, we set hi = n-i-2, which means we are searching in [0, n-i-2). But we want to include n-i-2? We should change the hi to n-i-1? But the problem says we cannot change existing code? We are only to complete the missing part.\n\n  Let me reexamine the condition: the maximum index we can use for Bob is n-i-2 (because if Bob takes k candies, then k = c+1, and we require k <= n-i-1 -> so c <= n-i-2). Therefore, we want to search in the entire segment [0, n-i-2] (inclusive). But the bisect_left with hi = n-i-2 (which is an exclusive upper bound) will search in [0, n-i-2). So we are missing the last element at index n-i-2.\n\n  This is a bug. But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we are not allowed to change the existing code? However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", meaning we can only fill in the TODO part? \n\n  Alternatively, note that the condition in the if statement also checks non-overlap: i < n - c - 1. If we set hi to n-i-1, then we might get a c that is n-i-1? But that would be invalid because then the condition i < n - c - 1 would become i < n - (n-i-1) - 1 = i-1, which is false. So we are safe? Actually, if we set hi to n-i-1, then we might get c = n-i-1, but then the condition i < n - c - 1 becomes i < n - (n-i-1) - 1 = i, which is false. So we skip. \n\n  Therefore, to fix the bug, we should set hi to n-i-1. But we are not allowed to change existing code? \n\n  Since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", we must leave the existing code as is. However, note that the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can do an alternative: we can extend the search by one element? But we cannot change the bisect_left call.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do a second check: after the bisect_left, we can check the element at index n-i-2? But that would be outside the current search. And we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n  But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", meaning we are only to write the part at the TODO. So we cannot change the bisect_left call.\n\n  However, the condition in the if statement already checks non-overlap. So if we get a candidate c from bisect_left that is in the valid range [0, n-i-2) and a==bw[c] and the non-overlap condition holds, then we update. But what if the element at index n-i-2 is also equal to a? Then we missed it. \n\n  How can we catch that? We cannot. \n\n  Therefore, we must change the hi parameter? But we are not allowed. \n\n  Alternatively, note that the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we are to complete the program without changing the existing code? Then we must live with the bug? \n\n  But wait: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", but the worst-case scenario for the current code is that we miss the last candidate. \n\n  However, note the note in the problem: the fourth test case: \n        weights: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer is 7.\n        How? \n          Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n          Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30\n          So Alice ate 3 candies (i=2) and Bob ate 4 candies (c=3). \n          Then total candies = 3+4 = 7.\n\n        How does the current code handle this?\n          We have aw = [7,10,30,35,45,53,64,65]\n          bw = [1,12,19,30,40,45,48,65]   (because reversed: [1,11,8,10,5,20,3,7] -> prefix: [1,12,20,30,35,55,58,65])\n\n          Actually, let me compute:\n            Original: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n            Reversed: [1,11,8,10,5,20,3,7]\n            bw: \n                index0: 1\n                index1: 1+11=12\n                index2: 1+11+8=20\n                index3: 1+11+8+10=30\n                index4: 1+11+8+10+5=35\n                index5: 1+11+8+10+5+20=55\n                index6: 1+11+8+10+5+20+3=58\n                index7: 65\n\n          Now, for i=2 (Alice has taken [7,3,20] -> 30), we want to find 30 in bw. It is at index3. \n          Then we check: i=2, c=3 -> non-overlap: i < n - c - 1 -> 2 < 8 - 3 - 1 -> 2 < 4 -> true.\n          Then we update mx = max(0, 2+3+2) = 7.\n\n          How did we get c=3? \n          We called: bisect_left(bw, 30, hi=len(bw)-2-2) -> hi=8-2-2=4. So we search in indices [0,4). \n          In the slice bw[0:4] = [1,12,20,30] -> the first index where >=30 is index3. So we get c=3.\n\n          So it works for this test case.\n\n          Why? because the index we need (3) is in the range [0,4) (exclusive of 4) -> so 3 is included.\n\n          But what if the candidate we need is at index n-i-2? For example, if Bob's segment that sums to a has exactly n-i-1 candies? Then c = n-i-2? But then the hi parameter is set to n-i-2 (exclusive) so we don't search index n-i-2? \n\n          Example: \n            n=5, i=0 -> then hi = 5-0-2 = 3 -> we search in [0,3) -> indices 0,1,2. \n            But what if the candidate is at index 3? Then we miss it.\n\n          How many candies would Bob be taking? c+1 = 4. \n          Non-overlap: Alice has taken 1 candy (index0), Bob has taken 4 candies: indices 1,2,3,4? \n          But wait: Bob takes from the right: the last 4 candies: indices 1,2,3,4? Then the first candy (index0) is not taken by Bob? So they don't overlap? \n          However, the condition: i < n - c - 1 -> 0 < 5 - 3 - 1 -> 0 < 1 -> true.\n\n          But we missed it because hi=3 (exclusive) so we skip index3.\n\n          Therefore, we must set hi to n-i-1 to include index n-i-2? \n\n          But we are not allowed to change the existing code.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do a second check: after the bisect_left, we can check the element at index = n-i-2? But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n          The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we can only write the part at the TODO.\n\n          However, we can do inside the for loop after the bisect_left, but before the if, we can check if the candidate at index = n-i-2 is valid? But we cannot add code arbitrarily? We can only complete the TODO block.\n\n          Therefore, we must hope that the candidate we need is always found in the range [0, n-i-2)? \n\n          But note: the condition for Bob is that he can take at most n-i-1 candies, so the maximum index we need in bw is n-i-2 (because the array bw has indices from 0 to n-1, and the element at index k corresponds to k+1 candies). So we must include index n-i-2. \n\n          How about we change the bisect_left call? We cannot.\n\n          This is a known issue? Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", but the worst-case might be that we miss the candidate at the boundary. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do: after the bisect_left, we check the candidate at index = min(c, n-i-2) ? But we cannot.\n\n          Since we are constrained, we must complete the TODO block as described.\n\n          So the TODO block should be:\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n\n          But note: the example test cases: \n            Test case 1: [1,1] -> answer=2.\n                aw = [1,2]\n                bw = [1,2]   (reversed: [1,1] -> prefix: [1,2])\n                i=0: a=1 -> bisect_left(bw,1, hi=len(bw)-0-2=2-0-2=0) -> so we search in [0,0) -> no element? then skip.\n                i=1: a=2 -> hi=2-1-2 = -1 -> which is invalid? \n\n          This is a problem.\n\n          Actually, the hi parameter in bisect_left must be nonnegative? \n\n          We should avoid negative hi. \n\n          How about we adjust the hi parameter to be at least 0? But we cannot change the existing code.\n\n          Alternatively, we can wrap the bisect_left call? But we cannot.\n\n          Therefore, we must change the approach? But we are not allowed to change the existing code.\n\n          Given the constraints, note that the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do a two-pointer? \n\n          Actually, the intended solution is to use two pointers: \n            Let left = 0, right = 0, and then i from 0 to n-1, and j from n-1 to 0, and then:\n            alice_sum = 0, bob_sum = 0, and then we move the pointers until they meet.\n\n          But the existing code uses prefix arrays and bisect. \n\n          Since we are constrained by the existing code, we must complete the TODO block as:\n\n          if a == bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1):\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n\n          And hope that the candidate at the boundary is not needed? But the fourth test case worked.\n\n          However, the first test case: [1,1] -> n=2, t=?\n          We have:\n            aw = [1,2]\n            bw = [1,2]   (from reversed [1,1])\n\n          For i=0: \n            a = 1\n            hi = len(bw)-0-2 = 2-0-2 = 0 -> so we search in [0,0) -> no element -> skip.\n          For i=1:\n            a = 2\n            hi = 2-1-2 = -1 -> which is invalid? \n\n          The bisect_left function when hi is negative? It will probably treat it as 0? But let's check the documentation: \n            bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))\n            If hi is negative, it is treated as 0? Actually, the code in bisect does: \n                if hi < 0:\n                    hi = 0\n            But we don't know. \n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid negative hi by skipping when hi<=0? But we cannot change the existing code.\n\n          Therefore, we must fix the hi parameter? But we are not allowed.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the condition i < n - c - 1 also ensures that we are not overlapping, but we are missing the candidate at the boundary.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, we can do an alternative: after the for loop, we can check the boundary separately? But we cannot add code.\n\n          We are stuck.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". So we are only to write the TODO block. \n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n          mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n\n          And hope that the test cases do not include the boundary case? \n\n          However, the sample test case 1: [1,1] fails.\n\n          How to fix without changing the existing code? \n\n          Actually, we can do: in the for loop, we can iterate only for i such that hi = n-i-2 >= 0? But we cannot change the for loop.\n\n          Alternatively, we can catch the negative hi in the bisect_left? But we cannot.\n\n          After careful thought, note that the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", but the sample test case 1 has n=2, which is small. \n\n          How about we do: in the TODO block, we also check the next candidate? But we cannot change the existing code outside the TODO block.\n\n          Given the constraints of the problem, we must complete the TODO block as:\n\n          if a == bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1):\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n\n          And then hope that the test cases do not include the boundary? \n\n          But the sample test case 1 is included.\n\n          Alternatively, we can try to also check the element at index = n-i-2? But we cannot add arbitrary code? Only in the TODO block.\n\n          We can do:\n\n          if a == bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1):\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n          else:\n              # Check if we are missing the boundary?\n              # But we don't have the boundary index in the current c.\n\n          How about we do:\n\n          We know that the valid range for Bob is [0, n-i-2] (inclusive). The current c is the first index in [0, n-i-2) such that bw[c] >= a. But if we didn't find an exact match in the current c, then we can check the boundary index: index = n-i-2? But we are in the else branch of the if condition? Actually, the condition is only for the current c.\n\n          But note: the if condition is only entered if a==bw[c]. So if we didn't get an exact match at c, we skip. But what if the boundary index n-i-2 has bw[n-i-2] == a? Then we missed it.\n\n          We can add inside the TODO block an additional check? But the TODO block is only executed when a==bw[c]. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do after the if condition, but we are not allowed to add code there.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem is from Codeforces, and the intended solution is two pointers, but the existing code uses this method, I think we should change the hi parameter to n-i-1. But we are not allowed.\n\n          Therefore, we must output the TODO block as:\n\n          mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n\n          And hope that the test data does not include cases where the only valid c is at the boundary n-i-2.\n\n          But the sample test case 1 fails.\n\n          How about we also check c = n-i-2 manually? But we cannot because we are in the TODO block and we don't have access to the index n-i-2? \n\n          We can try:\n\n          if a == bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1):\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n          # Check the boundary candidate: index = n-i-2, if it exists and is within the array\n          if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2] and i < (len(bw) - (n-i-2) - 1):\n              mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n          But wait, the condition for non-overlap for candidate c = n-i-2: \n              i < n - (n-i-2) - 1  -> i < i+1 -> which is always true.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n          if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n              mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n          But note: we are inside the for loop for i, and we are at the TODO block. We can do that.\n\n          However, this will be inefficient? Because we are doing an extra check for every i? And the total i over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n          But note: the existing code already found a candidate c (which might be not the boundary) and we are updating with that candidate. Then we also check the boundary candidate. But it is possible that both are valid? And we want the maximum total candies? The total candies for the boundary candidate is i + (n-i-2) + 2 = n. But that is the entire array? And they must be disjoint? But if they eat the entire array, then the condition is that the entire array is partitioned into two non overlapping parts: Alice from the left and Bob from the right, and the sum is equal. That is valid.\n\n          But note: the non-overlap condition for the boundary candidate: \n              Alice has taken i+1 candies, Bob has taken (n-i-2+1) = n-i-1 candies.\n              The total candies eaten = (i+1) + (n-i-1) = n.\n              And the condition for non-overlap: the last candy of Alice is at index i, and the first candy of Bob is at index n-1 - (n-i-2) = i+1. So they are adjacent? But not overlapping. So it is valid.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          if a == bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1):\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n          if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2] and i < (len(bw) - (n-i-2) - 1):\n              # But the non-overlap condition for c_boundary = n-i-2: \n              #   i < n - (n-i-2) - 1 -> i < i+1 -> always true.\n              # So we can skip the non-overlap condition? \n              # Actually, we must ensure that the segments do not overlap: \n              #   Alice: [0, i], Bob: [n-1 - (n-i-2), n-1] = [i+1, n-1] -> disjoint.\n              #   So the condition is automatically satisfied.\n              mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n          But note: the non-overlap condition in the existing if statement for the boundary candidate would be: \n              i < n - (n-i-2) - 1 -> i < i+1 -> true.\n          So we can write:\n\n          if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n              mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n          However, what if n-i-2 is the same as c? Then we are updating twice with the same value? But that's okay.\n\n          But note: the array bw is strictly increasing, so there is at most one index with value a. Therefore, if the boundary candidate is valid, then the previous c (from bisect_left) cannot be the boundary candidate because the bisect_left did not search the boundary (since hi is exclusive). So they are different only if the boundary candidate is the only occurrence.\n\n          But what if the value a appears at two indices: one at c (which is not the boundary) and one at the boundary? Then we update twice. But that's okay because the total candies for the boundary candidate is n, which is larger than the non-boundary candidate? Not necessarily: the non-boundary candidate might be at a smaller index and then the total candies is i+c+2, which is less than n.\n\n          But we are taking the max, so it's okay.\n\n          However, the total candies for the boundary candidate is i + (n-i-2) + 2 = n. So it's the entire array. And that is the maximum possible. So we can break early? But we are not.\n\n          But note: it is possible that the entire array is partitioned and the sum is equal, then we have found a candidate of n candies, which is the maximum possible. So we could break, but we are not required to.\n\n          Therefore, we can do in the TODO block:\n\n          if a == bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1):\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n          # Check the boundary candidate: index = n-i-2\n          if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n              # We know the non-overlap condition holds automatically for the boundary candidate.\n              mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n          But wait, what if n-i-2 is out of bounds? We check with 0 and len(bw).\n\n          However, note: n-i-2 might be negative? Then we skip.\n\n          Let's test with the first test case: [1,1] (n=2)\n            i=0: \n                a = aw[0] = 1\n                c = bisect_left(bw, 1, hi=2-0-2=0) -> returns 0? but the search is in [0,0) -> no elements, so what does bisect_left return when the value is not found? It returns the hi? \n                The documentation: The insertion position which is the index of the first element >= x. If there is no such element, it returns the hi index? \n                So if we search in an empty slice, it returns the start of the slice? Actually, the start is 0, and the hi is 0, so it returns 0? \n                Then we check: a==bw[0]? -> 1==1 -> true.\n                Then we check non-overlap: i < len(bw)-c-1 -> 0 < 2-0-1 -> 0<1 -> true.\n                Then we update mx = max(0, 0+0+2)=2.\n                Then we check the boundary: n-i-2 = 2-0-2=0 -> which is >=0 and <2, and a==bw[0] -> true, so we update mx = max(2, 0+0+2)=2.\n\n            i=1:\n                a = aw[1]=2\n                hi = 2-1-2 = -1 -> which is passed to bisect_left. How does bisect_left handle negative hi? \n                In Python, if hi is negative, it is relative to the end? But the documentation says hi is the exclusive upper bound. \n                Let me check: \n                    bisect_left(bw, 2, hi=-1) \n                This is equivalent to hi=len(bw)+hi? No, the hi is an absolute index. \n                But if hi is negative, then it means an index counted from the end? No, in the bisect module, the hi is an absolute index. \n                And if hi is negative, then the slice [0:hi] is empty? \n                So it returns hi? which is -1? \n                Then we check: a==bw[-1]? -> 2==bw[-1] (which is 2) -> true.\n                Then non-overlap: i < len(bw)-c-1 -> 1 < 2 - (-1) - 1 -> 1 < 2+1-1 -> 1<2 -> true.\n                Then update: mx = max(2, 1 + (-1) + 2) = max(2,2)=2.\n                Then boundary: n-i-2 = 2-1-2 = -1 -> skip.\n\n            So we get 2.\n\n          But wait, the non-overlap condition for i=1 and c=-1: \n              Alice has eaten the first 2 candies (entire array), and Bob has eaten the last c+1 = -1+1=0 candies? That doesn't make sense.\n\n          The issue: c=-1 is not a valid index. \n\n          How to avoid negative indices? We should skip if c is not in the valid range? But we are not allowed to change the existing code outside the TODO block.\n\n          Therefore, in the TODO block, we should also check that c is in the valid range [0, len(bw))? But the condition a==bw[c] will fail if c is out of bounds? \n\n          Actually, if c is -1, then bw[-1] is the last element, which is valid in Python. But we don't want that.\n\n          We should modify the first if condition to also check that c is in the range [0, n-i-1) (the range we searched)? But we don't know the search range in the TODO block.\n\n          Alternatively, we can check that c is in the range [0, n-i-1) for the first update? But we don't have the hi parameter in the TODO block.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the total n is bounded, we can do:\n\n          In the first if condition, we can add a check that c is in the valid range [0, n-i-2) (because the hi was n-i-2, exclusive)? But we don't know the hi.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the non-overlap condition i < n-c-1 might fail for negative c? \n\n          For c=-1: n-c-1 = n+1-1 = n, and i=1, n=2 -> 1<2 -> true. But the candidate is not valid.\n\n          Therefore, we should also check that c is nonnegative? \n\n          We can change the first if condition to:\n\n          if c>=0 and c < len(bw) and a == bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1):\n\n          But the existing code already has a condition that uses bw[c], so if c is out of [0, len(bw)) it would crash. \n\n          So we must ensure c is in bounds.\n\n          Therefore, we do:\n\n          if 0 <= c < len(bw) and a == bw[c] and i < (len(bw)-c-1):\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n          if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n              mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n          But note: the existing code might have c from bisect_left that is out of bounds? The bisect_left function returns an index in the range [0, hi] (if we consider the insertion index, it might be hi, which is out of the slice [0, hi) but within the array bounds?).\n\n          The bisect_left returns an insertion position, which is in the range [0, hi] (if we consider the entire array, but we are only searching [0,hi)). So if the value is greater than all in the slice, it returns hi. But then we are using bw[c] with c=hi, which might be out of the slice [0,hi) but within the array if hi<=len(bw). \n\n          Example: hi=0, then c=0, and then we use bw[0] which is valid.\n\n          But if hi is negative, then the search range is empty, and bisect_left returns the start which is 0? But then we use bw[0] which is valid.\n\n          However, if the array is empty, then n=0, but our test cases have n>=1.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          TODO block:\n\n          # First candidate from bisect_left\n          if 0 <= c < len(bw) and a == bw[c] and i < len(bw)-c-1:\n              mx = max(mx, i+c+2)\n          # Boundary candidate: index = n-i-2\n          if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n              mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n          But note: the boundary candidate might have been found by the bisect_left? Only if the boundary candidate is in the range [0, n-i-2) -> then we already updated. But then we update again. But it's the same value? Because the array is strictly increasing, there is only one index with value a. So it's not possible.\n\n          Therefore, we can do.\n\n          However, the fourth test case: \n            i=2, a=30, and we found c=3 (which is not the boundary: n-i-2 = 8-2-2=4, so the boundary is index4). \n            Then we check the boundary: index4 -> bw[4]=35, which is not 30, so we skip.\n\n          So it's safe.\n\n          But the first test case: \n            i=0: we do both and both update to 2.\n            i=1: we do the first: c = -1 -> then we check: 0<= -1 <2 -> false, so skip the first update.\n                   then boundary: n-i-2 = 2-1-2 = -1 -> skip.\n\n          So we only update once for i=0.\n\n          Therefore, we write the TODO block as above.\n\n          But note: the condition for the first candidate: we added a bounds check for c. The existing code might have c from bisect_left that is out of [0, len(bw))? It should not because the hi is at most len(bw) (but in our case, we passed hi as negative for i=1, and then c=-1, which is out of [0, len(bw))? It is in the array by Python's negative indexing, but we want to avoid that. So we require c>=0.\n\n          This should work.\n\n          Let me test with the provided examples.\n\n          Example 2: [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6] -> not provided, but example 2 in the note: \n            \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n            Weights: [3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6] -> no, the example says: \n            \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n            So the array must be of length 6? And they eat the entire array? \n            Example: [1,1,1,1,1,1] -> then Alice can eat 3 from the left: 3, and Bob can eat 3 from the right: 3. \n            But the array has 6 elements. \n            Let me do: \n                n=6, w = [1,1,1,1,1,1]\n                aw = [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n                bw = [1,2,3,4,5,6]   (reversed is the same)\n\n            For i=2: a=3\n                hi = 6-2-2 = 2 -> search in [0,2) -> indices0,1. \n                bisect_left(bw,3,0,2) -> in [1,2] (the slice is [1,2,3,...] but only [0:2) -> [1,2]) -> the first index>=3 is not found in [0,2) -> returns 2? but hi=2 is exclusive, so the valid indices are 0,1. The values: bw[0]=1, bw[1]=2 -> so returns 2? \n                Then we check: c=2 -> but 2 is not in the slice [0,2) -> so we skip the first update.\n                Then boundary: n-i-2 = 6-2-2=2 -> valid. \n                Check a==bw[2] -> 3==3 -> true.\n                Then update: mx = max(0, 2+2+2)=6.\n\n            So it works.\n\n          Example 3: [1,2,3,4] -> no way, so answer=0.\n            We try: \n                i=0: a=1 -> hi=4-0-2=2 -> search in [0,2): bw[0]=4, bw[1]=7 -> first index>=1 is 0? because bw[0]=4>=1 -> c=0.\n                Then check: a==bw[0]? 1==4 -> false.\n                Then boundary: n-i-2=4-0-2=2 -> a==bw[2]? 1==9 -> false.\n\n            i=1: a=3 -> hi=4-1-2=1 -> search in [0,1): only index0: bw[0]=4>=3 -> c=0.\n                a==bw[0]? 3!=4 -> false.\n                boundary: 4-1-2=1 -> a==bw[1]? 3==7 -> false.\n\n            i=2: a=6 -> hi=4-2-2=0 -> skip.\n                boundary: 4-2-2=0 -> a==bw[0]? 6==4 -> false.\n\n            i=3: a=10 -> hi=4-3-2=-1 -> \n                bisect_left returns ? probably 0 or -1? \n                Then we skip because of bounds in the first if? \n                boundary: 4-3-2=-1 -> skip.\n\n            So mx remains 0.\n\n          Example 4: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n            We already did: i=2, a=30, and the boundary candidate is at index4 (bw[4]=35) which is not 30, so we only rely on the first candidate: c=3 -> then update to 2+3+2=7.\n\n          Therefore, we write the TODO block as:\n\n          if 0 <= c < len(bw) and a == bw[c] and i < len(bw)-c-1:\n              mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n          if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n              mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n          But note: the array bw is the same for all i, and n and i are known.\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the variable for the reversed array's prefix sum is named 'bw', and its length is n.\n\n          This should be the completion for program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n  The code is:\n\n      x = input()\n      for i in range(int(x)):\n          z = input()\n          if int(z) >= 1900:\n              print('Division 1')\n          elif int(z) >= 1600:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          elif int(z) >= 1400:\n              print('Division 3')\n          else:\n              print('Division 4')\n\n  The divisions:\n      Division 1: rating >= 1900\n      Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899 -> so if rating>=1600 and rating<=1899, then Division 2.\n      But the condition in the code: \n          if int(z) >= 1900: Division 1\n          elif int(z) >= 1600: then ... \n          This condition catches 1600 to 1899 and also 1900 and above? But the first condition already caught 1900 and above. So in the elif, we only have ratings from 1600 to 1899.\n\n      Therefore, we should print 'Division 2'\n\n  So the TODO block is:\n        print('Division 2')\n\n  But note: the condition for Division 2 is exactly 1600 to 1899, and the elif condition is for ratings >=1600 and <1900? Because the next condition is >=1400, which is lower than 1600.\n\n  So we can simply print 'Division 2'\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program2.py is: \n        print('Division 2')\n\n  But note: the code uses int(z) in every condition. We are not changing that.\n\n  We output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py in the required JSON format.\n\n  However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and for program1.py we are outputting two if blocks? But the TODO block is one block. We are replacing the TODO with two if statements.\n\n  But the TODO block is at the location of the single comment.\n\n  We write:\n\n  program1: \n        if 0 <= c < len(bw) and a == bw[c] and i < len(bw)-c-1:\n            mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\n        if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n            mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n  But note: the existing code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", and we are replacing that comment with these two if blocks.\n\n  And for program2: \n        print('Division 2')\n\n  But note: the existing code in program2 has an incomplete elif block. We are to complete it with the print statement.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n  {\n    \"program1\": \"if 0 <= c < len(bw) and a == bw[c] and i < len(bw)-c-1:\\n        mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\\n    if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\\n        mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\",\n    \"program2\": \"print('Division 2')\"\n  }\n\n  But note: the indentation in program1: the existing for loop is indented by 4, and the TODO is at the same level. We must match the indentation.\n\n  The existing code in program1 for the for loop:\n\n      for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n          c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n          if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO comment with two if blocks, which should be indented by 8 (one more level). \n\n  So we write:\n\n      if ...:\n          mx = ...\n      if ...:\n          mx = ...\n\n  with 8 spaces of indentation.\n\n  But in the JSON string, we can use \\n and \\t? But the problem says: output the missing code, not markdown.\n\n  We'll use newlines and spaces.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write in one line? But it's complex.\n\n  We'll write with newlines and the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\n  Since the existing code uses 4-space indentation, and the TODO is inside an if block (so 8 spaces), we write:\n\n      program1: \"    if 0 <= c < len(bw) and a == bw[c] and i < len(bw)-c-1:\\n        mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\\n    if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\\n        mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\"\n\n  But wait, the first if should be at the same indentation as the existing if? Actually, the existing if has:\n\n          if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n\n  and then the TODO is inside. We are replacing the TODO with two ifs. So we are inside the existing if block? \n\n  Actually, the existing code:\n\n      for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n          c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n          if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO with code that goes in that block. So the two ifs should be at the same indentation as the TODO, which is 8 spaces (relative to the for loop at 4). \n\n  But the existing if condition is at 8 spaces? \n\n  So we write:\n\n      program1: \"    if 0 <= c < len(bw) and a == bw[c] and i < len(bw)-c-1:\\n        mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\\n    if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\\n        mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\"\n\n  But wait, the first if condition is the same as the existing if condition? Actually, the existing if condition is:\n\n          if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n\n  and we are inside that block. So we know that a==bw[c] and i<len(bw)-c-1 is true. But wait, we added a bounds check for c. So we are rechecking the same condition? \n\n  Actually, we are inside the block where the existing if condition is true. But we added a bounds check. So we can simplify: we know a==bw[c] and i<len(bw)-c-1, but we don't know if c is in bounds? \n\n  We are inside the block, so the condition a==bw[c] and i<len(bw)-c-1 was true. But if c is out of bounds, then the condition would have crashed? \n\n  Therefore, we don't need the bounds check for the first if? \n\n  But in the case of negative c, the condition i<len(bw)-c-1 might be true even if c is negative, and then we use bw[c] which is the last element? \n\n  We are already inside the block, so the condition has been evaluated. So if c is negative, then the condition i<len(bw)-c-1 is true (because -c is positive), and then we are in the block. But we don't want to update if c is negative.\n\n  Therefore, we must have the bounds check for c in the first if.\n\n  But note: the existing condition has already accessed bw[c] (in the if condition that got us into the block). So if c is negative, it didn't crash? \n\n  In Python, if c is negative, it is a valid index (from the end). So we are in the block. But we don't want to update if c is negative.\n\n  Therefore, we must have the bounds check.\n\n  So the first if inside the block is:\n\n      if 0 <= c < len(bw):   # but we know a==bw[c] and the non-overlap condition, so we can update?\n          mx = max(mx, i+c+2)\n\n  But wait, we already know a==bw[c] and the non-overlap condition, but we don't know if c is in the valid range [0, len(bw)). \n\n  So we do:\n\n      if 0 <= c < len(bw):\n          mx = max(mx, i+c+2)\n\n  And then the boundary candidate.\n\n  But note: the boundary candidate might be the same as c? But the array is strictly increasing, so no.\n\n  Therefore, we can write:\n\n      if 0 <= c < len(bw):\n          mx = max(mx, i+c+2)\n      if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n          mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n  But wait, we are inside the block where a==bw[c] is true, but that doesn't mean a==bw[n-i-2] is true. So we still need to check.\n\n  So the code is as above.\n\n  But note: we are inside the block of the existing if, so we know a==bw[c] is true. But we don't know about the boundary candidate.\n\n  Therefore, we leave the condition for the boundary candidate as is.\n\n  Final for program1:\n\n      if 0 <= c < len(bw):\n          mx = max(mx, i+c+2)\n      if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n          mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n  But wait, we already have a==bw[c] true, but that doesn't imply anything about the boundary candidate. So we must check a==bw[n-i-2] for the boundary candidate.\n\n  However, we are not assured that the boundary candidate equals a.\n\n  So we do:\n\n      if 0 <= c < len(bw):\n          mx = max(mx, i+c+2)\n      if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\n          mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  But note: the boundary candidate might be the same as c? Only if n-i-2 == c. But then we update twice? But the array is strictly increasing, so if a appears at two different indices, that would be impossible. So they are different.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n  program1: \"    if 0 <= c < len(bw):\\n        mx = max(mx, i + c + 2)\\n    if n-i-2 >= 0 and n-i-2 < len(bw) and a == bw[n-i-2]:\\n        mx = max(mx, i + (n-i-2) + 2)\"\n\n  But note: the existing if condition already checked a==bw[c] and non-overlap, so we are guaranteed that if c is in bounds, then we can update. But we are not guaranteed that c is in bounds? \n\n  We are inside the block because the condition \"a==bw[c] and i<len(bw)-c-1\" was true. But if c is negative, then the condition a==bw[c] is true (because bw[c] is the last element) and the non-overlap condition is true, but we don't want to count it.\n\n  Therefore, we do the bounds check.\n\n  This is the completion.\n\n  Let me test with the first test case [1,1] for i=1 (which is the last candy):\n      We are in the block because a=2, and we got c=-1 from bisect_left, and then the condition a==bw[c] is true (because bw[-1]=2) and the non-overlap condition: i=1, len(bw)=2, so 1 < 2 - (-1) - 1 -> 1<2+1-1 -> 1<2 -> true.\n      Then we do:\n          First if: 0<=-1<2 -> false -> skip.\n          Second if: n-i-2 = 2-1-2 = -1 -> skip.\n\n      So no update.\n\n      But for i=0 we updated to 2.\n\n  So the answer is 2.\n\n  It works.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer."
