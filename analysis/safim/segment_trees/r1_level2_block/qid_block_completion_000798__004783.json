For i=1 (because the prefix sum at index1 is 2) -> then we want to search for 2 in bw, and we want to allow j=1 (because Bob takes two from the right -> which is the suffix prefix sum at index1: bw[1]=2). Then we need to set hi to at least 2? because we want to include index1. If we set hi = n-i-1 = 4-1-1=2 -> then we search in [0,2) -> indices 0 and 1. We find c = bisect_left(bw,2) -> which is 1? because bw[0]=1, bw[1]=2. Then we get total = 1+1 (for i=1) + 1+1 (for c=1) = 4. But if we set hi = n-i-2 = 4-1-2=1 -> then we search in [0,1) -> only index0 -> we don't find 2. So we must set hi = n-i-1. Therefore, we change the bisect_left call to:\n   c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=min(len(bw), n-i-1))\n\nBut note: n-i-1 might be negative? Then we set hi=0.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the sum of weights eaten by Alice (from the left) equals the sum of weights eaten by Bob (from the right), and they don't overlap.\n\nThe idea:\n- Precompute prefix sums for Alice (aw) and suffix sums for Bob (bw). Note: bw is the prefix sum of the reversed array, so bw[i] corresponds to the sum of the i+1 rightmost candies.\n- We want to find indices i (for Alice) and j (for Bob) such that the prefix sum aw[i] equals the suffix sum bw[j] (which is the sum of the j+1 rightmost candies) and i+j+2 <= n (because they cannot overlap).\n- The total candies eaten would be i+1 (from Alice) + j+1 (from Bob) = i+j+2.\n\nWe are iterating for each prefix a in aw. For each a, we want to see if there exists a suffix sum (in bw) equal to a, but we must ensure that the suffix part does not overlap with the prefix part. The condition for non-overlap: the prefix part ends at index i (0-indexed) and the suffix part ends at index j (0-indexed in the reversed array, meaning the original index is n-1-j). We require that i < n-1-j, i.e., the prefix part is strictly to the left of the suffix part.\n\nIn the given code, we have:\n   for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n\nBut note: the condition in the bisect_left call: hi=len(bw)-i-2. This is because we cannot use the entire bw array? Actually, we want to avoid the part that would cause overlap. The suffix part we can use is at most the part that starts after the prefix part. The suffix array bw has length n. The condition for non-overlap: the number of suffix candies (j+1) must be such that the starting index of the suffix part (n-1-j) is greater than i. So j must be at most n-i-2 (because j from 0 to n-i-2 gives j+1 from 1 to n-i-1, and the suffix part starts at n-1-j which must be at least i+1). Therefore, we are only considering the first (n-i-1) elements of bw? Actually, note that bw is the prefix of the reversed array. The entire bw array has n elements. We want to consider only the suffix sums that correspond to at most n-i-1 candies? Actually, we want to consider the suffix sums that are formed by candies that are strictly after the prefix part. The condition is that the total number of candies taken from the suffix (j+1) must be at most n-i-1 (so that the last candy of the suffix is at index n-1-j >= i+1). Therefore, we are only allowed to look at indices j in the range [0, n-i-2] in the bw array? But note: the index j in bw corresponds to j+1 candies from the right. So we want j <= n-i-2? Actually, the condition is: i+1 + (j+1) <= n -> j <= n-i-2. So we are restricting the search in bw to the indices [0, n-i-2] (because we set hi = n-i-2, but note that bisect_left uses hi as the exclusive upper bound). However, the current code uses hi=len(bw)-i-2, which is n-i-2. But note: the array bw has indices from 0 to n-1. We are searching in the subarray bw[0 : n-i-2] (exclusive at the end). \n\nBut wait: the condition in the if-statement: \n   if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1)\n\nThis condition checks that the value at index c in bw is a, and that the non-overlap condition holds: i < n-1-c? Because len(bw)=n, so n-1-c is the original index of the last candy in the suffix part? Actually, no: the suffix part in the original array is from index n-1 down to n-1-c (if we take c+1 candies). The condition for non-overlap is that the prefix part ends at index i, and the suffix part starts at index n-1-c? Actually, the suffix part ends at the rightmost candy (which is the first candy in the reversed array) and takes c+1 candies, so the leftmost candy in the suffix part is at index n-1-c. We require that the prefix part does not include the suffix part: so the last candy of the prefix (at index i) must be strictly less than the first candy of the suffix (at index n-1-c). Therefore, we require i < n-1-c.\n\nBut note: the condition in the code: i < (len(bw)-c-1) -> i < n - c - 1.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nNow, if we find such a c, then the total candies eaten is (i+1) + (c+1) = i+c+2.\n\nWe want to maximize the total candies over all such pairs (i, c).\n\nTherefore, we should update mx = max(mx, i+c+2) when we find a matching pair.\n\nBut note: we are iterating over i and for each i we are doing a binary search for a in the suffix array (only the safe part). We then check the candidate at index c.\n\nHowever, note that the suffix array bw is non-decreasing? Yes, because it's the prefix sums of the reversed array (which is non-negative). So we can use bisect.\n\nBut note: the suffix array bw is the prefix sums of the reversed array, so it is non-decreasing.\n\nSo the plan is:\n   for i in range(n):\n        a = aw[i]\n        # We want to find the smallest index c in the suffix array (bw) such that bw[c] >= a, but we are only looking in the indices [0, n-i-2] (because hi = n-i-2, which is exclusive upper bound? Actually, the bisect_left function has a parameter 'hi' which is the exclusive upper bound. So we are searching in the slice [0: n-i-2] (i.e., indices 0 to n-i-3). But note: we want to allow j up to n-i-2? Actually, the condition for j is j <= n-i-2. So we want to include index j = n-i-2? Then we should set hi = n-i-1 (because the exclusive upper bound is n-i-1, so the indices go from 0 to n-i-2). \n\nTherefore, we should change the bisect_left call to:\n   c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=min(len(bw), n-i-1))\n\nBut note: the condition in the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so we can do a loop for each test case and then for each prefix, do a binary search in the suffix array.\n\nAlternatively, we can also use two pointers. However, the given code uses binary search.\n\nBut the current code uses hi=len(bw)-i-2 -> which is n-i-2. This means we are excluding the element at index n-i-2? Actually, the bisect_left function searches in the subarray [0, hi) (exclusive of hi). So we are not including the element at index n-i-2. But we want to include j = n-i-2? Then we should set hi = n-i-1.\n\nSo let me adjust: set hi = n-i-1.\n\nBut note: if n-i-1 is negative? We should avoid that. We can set hi = min(len(bw), n-i-1) but note that n-i-1 might be negative? i can be up to n-1, then n-i-1 = 0. So when i = n-1, then n-i-1 = 0 -> then we are searching in an empty array? Then we skip.\n\nAlternatively, we can break early: if i>=n-1, then we cannot have any suffix? Actually, the condition for non-overlap requires at least one candy in the middle? Actually, no: if i is the last candy, then the suffix part must be empty? So we skip.\n\nBut note: the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. So if Alice eats the entire row, then Bob must eat nothing? Then the sum for Bob is 0. But the problem does not say they have to eat at least one candy? Actually, the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". So they can have zero? But the problem says \"they want to be fair\" meaning same total weight. Zero is same? But then they eat zero candies. The problem asks for the maximum number of candies. So if they can achieve a non-zero common weight, then we count the candies. Otherwise, we might have zero.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So if they can achieve a common positive weight, then we count the candies. If not, then zero.\n\nIn the given code, we initialize mx=0. Then we update when we find a valid pair.\n\nSo the missing code inside the if block is:\n   if a == bw[c] and i < n-1-c:   # note: n-1-c is the original index of the first candy in the suffix part? Actually, the suffix part is the last c+1 candies, so the leftmost candy of the suffix part is at index n-1-c. We require that the prefix part ends at index i, which must be strictly less than n-1-c (so that there is no overlap). \n        total = i+1 + c+1\n        if total > mx:\n            mx = total\n\nBut note: the condition i < n-1-c is equivalent to i < (len(bw)-c-1) because len(bw)=n.\n\nHowever, we must note: the index c we found might be beyond the allowed range? Actually, we set hi = n-i-1, so c is in [0, n-i-1). But then we check i < n-1-c? Actually, if c is in [0, n-i-1), then n-1-c >= n-1 - (n-i-2) = i+1, which is > i. So the condition i < n-1-c is automatically satisfied? \n\nWait: if c is in [0, n-i-1), then c <= n-i-2. Then n-1-c >= n-1 - (n-i-2) = i+1. So i < i+1 is always true. Therefore, the condition i < n-1-c is redundant? \n\nBut note: what if we set hi = n-i-1, then the candidate c we get is the smallest index in [0, n-i-1) such that bw[c] >= a. But we are checking for equality. So if we find a candidate c such that bw[c] == a, then we have a valid pair. And because c is at most n-i-2, then the non-overlap condition holds.\n\nTherefore, we can remove the condition? But the problem says: \"hi=len(bw)-i-2\" in the original code. We are changing it to n-i-1? Actually, the original code had hi=len(bw)-i-2, which is n-i-2. Then the candidate c is in [0, n-i-2). Then n-1-c >= n-1 - (n-i-3) = i+2, which is > i. So again the condition holds. \n\nBut why did the original code have hi=len(bw)-i-2? That would exclude the last element we might want? Actually, we want to include j = n-i-2? Then we should set hi = n-i-1. \n\nLet me test with the example: \nExample 1: n=3, w = [1,1,1]\naw = [1,2,3]\nbw = [1,2,3]   # because reversed is [1,1,1] -> prefix: [1,2,3]\n\nWe want to consider:\ni=0: a=1 -> we want to search in bw[0: n-0-1 = 3] -> entire array? But with hi=3 (exclusive) -> entire array. Then we find c = bisect_left(bw,1) -> 0. Then we check: a==bw[0] -> yes. Then total = 0+1 + 0+1 = 2. Then mx=2.\n\ni=1: a=2 -> we search in bw[0: n-1-1=1] -> only [1]. Then we find c = bisect_left(bw,2, hi=1) -> 1? but hi=1 so we only look at [0:1) -> only index0? Then we don't find 2? But wait, we want to find 2? Actually, we are searching in the subarray of bw from 0 to 0 (because hi=1 is exclusive). Then we don't find 2? But note: we can also consider j=1? which would be the last two candies? But then the total candies eaten would be 2 (from Alice) and 2 (from Bob) -> total 4? but there are only 3 candies. So we must not allow j=1? because then the suffix part would be the last two candies: indices 1 and 2. But Alice ate the first two: indices 0 and 1 -> overlap at index1. So we must not allow j=1 when i=1. Therefore, we set hi = n-i-1 = 3-1-1 = 1 -> then we are searching in indices [0,1) -> only index0. So we don't find the 2? Then we skip.\n\nBut wait: we can have Alice take the first candy (i=0) and Bob take the last two? Then Alice: [1] and Bob: [1,1] -> sums 1 and 2 -> not equal. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, Alice takes the first two: [1,1] and Bob takes the last one: [1] -> sums 2 and 1 -> not equal.\n\nSo the only solution is Alice takes the first and Bob takes the last? Then total=2.\n\nBut what if we consider Alice taking nothing? Then Bob can take nothing? Then they both have 0, but then they eat 0 candies. We are looking for maximum. So 2 is the answer.\n\nNow, what if we set hi = n-i-1? Then for i=0: we search in [0, 3) -> entire array. We find c=0 -> total=2.\nfor i=1: we search in [0, 1) -> only index0 -> a=2, bw[0]=1 -> not equal -> skip.\nfor i=2: we set hi = n-2-1 = 0 -> no search -> skip.\n\nSo we get mx=2.\n\nBut what if we set hi = n-i-2? Then for i=0: hi=3-0-2=1 -> we search in [0,1) -> only index0 -> we find 1 -> total=2.\nfor i=1: hi=3-1-2=0 -> no search -> skip.\nfor i=2: hi=3-2-2=-1 -> which is invalid? Actually, bisect_left will treat negative hi as 0? Then we search in [0,0) -> nothing.\n\nSo we get the same.\n\nBut consider a different example: n=4, w=[1,1,1,1]\nWe want to see if we can get 4: Alice takes first two (sum=2) and Bob takes last two (sum=2) -> total=4.\n\nFor i=1 (because the prefix sum at index1 is 2) -> then we want to search for 2 in bw, and we want to allow j=1 (because Bob takes two from the right -> which is the suffix prefix sum at index1: bw[1]=2). Then we need to set hi to at least 2? because we want to include index1.\n\nIf we set hi = n-i-1 = 4-1-1=2 -> then we search in [0,2) -> indices 0 and 1. We find c = bisect_left(bw,2) -> which is 1? because bw[0]=1, bw[1]=2. Then we get total = 1+1 (for i=1) + 1+1 (for c=1) = 4.\n\nBut if we set hi = n-i-2 = 4-1-2=1 -> then we search in [0,1) -> only index0 -> we don't find 2.\n\nSo we must set hi = n-i-1.\n\nTherefore, we change the bisect_left call to:\n   c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=min(len(bw), n-i-1))\n\nBut note: n-i-1 might be negative? Then we set hi=0. So we can write:\n   hi_bound = n - i - 1\n   if hi_bound <= 0:\n        continue   # or break? because as i increases, hi_bound becomes negative and we can break? Actually, we can break early? But the loop goes to n-1. Alternatively, we can skip.\n\nBut the bisect_left function will clamp the hi to the length? Actually, the documentation says: \n   bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))\n   The 'hi' default is len(a), but we can set it to a value beyond len(a) and it will clamp? Actually, no: the function expects hi to be within the bounds? But the code says: \n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n\nWe can change it to:\n        hi_bound = n - i - 1\n        if hi_bound < 0:\n            continue\n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\n\nBut note: the original code had hi=len(bw)-i-2, which is n-i-2. We are changing to n-i-1.\n\nSo the corrected code for program1.py:\n\nWe change the bisect_left call to use hi = n-i-1 (if n-i-1 is negative, we skip the binary search? Actually, we can skip the entire iteration? But the loop runs for i in [0, n-1]. We can do:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        a = aw[i]\n        hi_bound = n - i - 1\n        if hi_bound < 0:\n            break   # or continue? but i is increasing, so once we get negative, all next will be negative -> break\n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)   # searches in [0, hi_bound) -> indices 0 to hi_bound-1\n        # But note: we want to include index hi_bound-1? and we are. \n        if c < hi_bound and a == bw[c]:   # we must check that c is within the searched range and the value matches\n            total = i+1 + c+1\n            if total > mx:\n                mx = total\n\nBut note: the bisect_left returns the smallest index c in [0, hi_bound) such that bw[c] >= a. If a is greater than all in the range, then c will be hi_bound? Actually, no: because we set hi=hi_bound, so the search is in [0, hi_bound) and if a is greater than all, then c = hi_bound. But then we check a==bw[c] -> but c might be out of bounds? So we should check c < hi_bound.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n        if c < hi_bound and bw[c] == a:\n\nBut note: the condition in the original code was:\n        if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n\nBut we argued that the second condition is redundant? Actually, with hi_bound = n-i-1, we have c in [0, n-i-1) and then n-1-c >= i+1, so i < n-1-c is always true. So we can remove that condition.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n        if c < hi_bound and a == bw[c]:\n            total = i+1 + c+1\n            mx = max(mx, total)\n\nBut note: what if there are multiple c with the same value? We want the smallest c? Actually, the smallest c would give the smallest j (meaning the fewest candies from the right) and then the total candies eaten would be minimized? But we want to maximize the total candies. Actually, we want the largest j? But we are doing a binary search for the first occurrence of a. That might not be the best? Actually, we want to maximize the total candies: total = i+1 + j+1. For a fixed i, we want the largest j such that bw[j] = a? But note: the array bw is non-decreasing. So if there are multiple j with bw[j]=a, we want the largest j? Because j is the index in the suffix prefix array: the larger j, the more candies Bob has eaten. But note: the condition for non-overlap: j <= n-i-2. So we want the largest j in the allowed range that equals a.\n\nBut bisect_left returns the first occurrence. Then we can use bisect_right? Actually, we can do:\n\n        c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\n        if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\n            # we found one, but we want the last occurrence? \n            # Actually, we want the largest j such that bw[j]=a and j in [c1, hi_bound). \n            # We can do: \n            c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\n            # Then we take j = c2? \n            total = i+1 + c2+1\n            mx = max(mx, total)\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is 200000. And we are iterating for each i (which is 200000 per test case) and then doing two binary searches? That would be O(n log n) per test case. But the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case one test case with n=200000. Then 200000 * log2(200000) is about 200000 * 18 = 3.6e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut the problem says: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000. So we can do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the array bw is non-decreasing, so once we find the first occurrence, we can try to jump to the last occurrence? But we don't know how many consecutive a's there are. So we do:\n\n        c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\n        if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\n            # Now, we want the last occurrence of a in the range [c1, hi_bound)\n            c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\n            # Then we use c2 to maximize the total candies.\n            total = i+1 + c2+1\n            mx = max(mx, total)\n\nBut note: we are iterating over i, and for each i we do two binary searches. That is acceptable.\n\nBut the original code only did one binary search. And the note says: the total n over test cases is 200000. So we can do two binary searches per i? Then the total operations would be about 2 * (sum of n over test cases) * log(max_n) = 2 * 200000 * log2(200000) ~ 2 * 200000 * 18 = 7.2e6, which is acceptable in Python? Maybe, but we must be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, we can store the last occurrence of each value in the suffix array? But we are iterating i from 0 to n-1, and the suffix array is fixed per test case. We can precompute the positions for each value? But the values can be up to 10^4, but the array bw has n numbers (n up to 200000) and the values are positive and the sums can be up to 200000*10^4=2e9, which is too big to index.\n\nSo we stick with two binary searches per i.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case one test case with n=200000. Then we do 200000 * 2 * log2(200000) ~ 7.2e6 comparisons? That might be acceptable in Pyton? We can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\n        if c < hi_bound and bw[c] == a:\n            # Instead of finding the last occurrence, we note that we want to maximize j (the index in bw) for the same a. \n            # But the array bw is non-decreasing, so the last occurrence of a is the one we want? \n            # However, we cannot assume that the entire array bw is non-decreasing? It is, because it's a prefix sum of non-negative numbers. So the values are non-decreasing. Therefore, the last occurrence of a in the range [c, hi_bound) is the last index where we have a. \n            # How to get that? We can do:\n            #   while c+1 < hi_bound and bw[c+1] == a:\n            #        c += 1\n            #   then use c\n            # But worst-case, if we have a long run of zeros? Then we might do O(n) per i -> worst-case O(n^2). And n=200000 -> 200000^2 = 40e9, which is too slow.\n\nSo we do two binary searches.\n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py becomes:\n\nfrom bisect import *\nfrom itertools import *\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    aw = list(accumulate(w))\n    bw = list(accumulate(w[::-1]))\n    mx = 0\n    # Precompute nothing else? \n    for i in range(n):\n        a = aw[i]\n        hi_bound = n - i - 1   # we are going to search in bw[0:hi_bound] (exclusive of hi_bound)\n        if hi_bound <= 0:\n            break   # because i is too large: no room for Bob\n        # Find the first occurrence of a in bw[0:hi_bound]\n        c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)   # hi_bound is exclusive\n        if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\n            # Now find the last occurrence of a in the same range\n            # bisect_right returns the insertion position for a+1, so the last occurrence is at c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\n            c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\n            # Then we use c2 to maximize the total candies\n            total = i+1 + c2+1\n            if total > mx:\n                mx = total\n    print(mx)\n\nBut note: what if the entire suffix array in the allowed range is a? Then we take the last index in the allowed range? But note: we set hi_bound = n-i-1, and we are searching in [0, hi_bound). The last index in the allowed range is hi_bound-1. And bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) returns hi_bound? Then c2 = hi_bound-1. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if there is no a? Then we skip.\n\nLet me test with the example: n=5, w = [1,2,3,2,1]\naw = [1,3,6,8,9]\nbw = [1,3,5,8,9]   # reversed: [1,2,3,2,1] -> prefix: [1,3,6,8,9] -> wait, no: \nActually, reversed: [1,2,3,2,1] -> prefix: \n   index0: 1\n   index1: 1+2=3\n   index2: 1+2+3=6\n   index3: 1+2+3+2=8\n   index4: 1+2+3+2+1=9\nBut wait, that's the same as aw? because the array is symmetric? \n\nBut we want to find: \nAlice: [1,2] -> sum=3, Bob: [1,2] (from the right) -> sum=1+2=3? But the last two: the last candy is 1, then the next is 2 -> so the suffix prefix for two candies is 1+2=3. \nSo we have i=1 (because aw[1]=3) and then we want to find 3 in bw. \nhi_bound = n-1-1 = 5-1-1=3 -> we search in bw[0:3] -> [1,3,5]. \nbisect_left(bw,3) -> returns 1 (because bw[1]=3). Then we find the last occurrence: \n   bisect_right(bw,3, hi=3) -> returns 2? because at index2 we have 5 which is >3. So c2 = 1. \nThen total = 1+1 (i=1 -> two candies) + 1+1 (c2=1 -> two candies) = 4.\n\nBut there is a better solution: \nAlice: [1,2,3] -> sum=6, Bob: [3,2,1] -> but wait, Bob eats from the right: the last three: [1,2,3] -> sum=6. \nSo i=2: a=6. \nhi_bound = 5-2-1=2 -> we search in bw[0:2] -> [1,3]. \nWe don't find 6? \n\nBut wait: the suffix prefix for the last three: index2 in bw? because the reversed array: [1,2,3,2,1] -> the prefix for the first three: 1+2+3=6 -> so bw[2]=6. But we are not searching beyond index1? because hi_bound=2 -> we search in indices [0,2) -> indices0 and1. \n\nSo we must set hi_bound = n-i-1? which is 5-2-1=2 -> then we search in [0,2) -> indices0 and1. We miss index2.\n\nBut note: the condition for non-overlap: \n   Alice has eaten up to index i (which is 2) -> the last candy is at index2. \n   Bob has eaten the last three: which are at indices 4,3,2? -> but wait, the original array: \n        index0:1, index1:2, index2:3, index3:2, index4:1.\n   Bob eats the last three: indices 2,3,4? -> but that includes index2 which Alice ate? -> overlap.\n\nSo we cannot have both Alice and Bob eating the candy at index2.\n\nTherefore, we must not allow Bob to eat the candy at index2? Then Bob can only eat the last two? which are indices3 and4? -> sum=2+1=3. Then we don't have 6.\n\nAlternatively, Bob eats the last three: but that would be the candies at indices 4,3,2. But Alice ate the first three: indices0,1,2. Then the candy at index2 is eaten by both? -> not allowed.\n\nSo the solution with total 6 is invalid.\n\nBut the example in the problem: \n   For the fourth test case: \n        Alice: [7,3,20] -> which are the first three? \n        Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> which are the last four? \n        Then the middle candy (with weight 5) is not eaten? \n        So the array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> \n        Alice: indices0,1,2 -> 7,3,20 -> sum=30\n        Bob: indices4,5,6,7 -> 10,8,11,1 -> sum=30\n        Then the candy at index3 (5) is not eaten.\n\nSo the condition: the prefix part must be strictly to the left of the suffix part.\n\nTherefore, in the example [1,2,3,2,1], the best is 4.\n\nBut what if we do: \n   Alice: [1,2] -> indices0,1 -> sum=3\n   Bob: [2,1] -> indices3,4 -> sum=3\n   Then total=4.\n\nAnd the candy at index2 (3) is not eaten.\n\nSo the code we have should work.\n\nBut note: the example in the problem: \n   Example 2: n=4, w=[1,1,1,1] -> answer=4? \n        We do: \n            i=1: a=2, hi_bound=4-1-1=2 -> search in bw[0:2] -> [1,2] (because reversed: [1,1,1,1] -> prefix: [1,2,3,4] -> so bw[0]=1, bw[1]=2, ...)\n            c1 = bisect_left(bw,2,0,2) -> returns 1? because bw[1]=2.\n            then c2 = bisect_right(bw,2,0,2)-1 = (2-1)=1.\n            total = 1+1 (i=1 -> two candies) + 1+1 (c2=1 -> two candies) = 4 -> then mx=4.\n\n   Then we also have i=0: a=1 -> hi_bound=4-0-1=3 -> search in [0,3): [1,2,3] -> we find a=1 at c1=0, then c2 = bisect_right(bw,1,0,3)-1 = 1-1=0 -> total=0+1+0+1=2 -> then mx=4 is bigger.\n\n   Then i=2: a=3 -> hi_bound=4-2-1=1 -> search in [0,1): [1] -> not found.\n\n   Then i=3: hi_bound=4-3-1=0 -> skip.\n\n   So we get 4.\n\n   Example 3: n=1, w=[10] -> then we break in the loop? because for i=0: hi_bound = 1-0-1=0 -> skip. Then mx=0 -> output 0.\n\n   Example 4: the provided example: \n        n=8, w = [7,3,1,5,2,10,8,1] -> but the note says: \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> wait, the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? \n        Actually, the note says: \n            \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n        So the array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> n=8.\n\n        We need to compute:\n            aw = [7,10,30,35,45,53,64,65]\n            bw = [1,11,19,29,34,54,57,64]   # reversed: [1,11,8,10,5,20,3,7] -> prefix: \n                  1, 1+11=12, 1+11+8=20, 1+11+8+10=30, 1+11+8+10+5=35, 1+11+8+10+5+20=55, ... -> but wait, the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> which is 10+8+11+1=30.\n\n        Actually, the reversed array is: [1,11,8,10,5,20,3,7] -> \n            Bob eats the last four: [1,11,8,10]? -> but that would be 1+11+8+10=30? \n            But the note says: Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> which is the same as the last four in the original array: \n                original: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> last four: 10,8,11,1 -> but in the reversed array (from right to left) we take the first four: [1,11,8,10] -> which is the same as the last four in the original from right to left? \n\n        So the suffix prefix for the last four: \n            reversed array: [1,11,8,10,5,20,3,7] -> the prefix for the first four: 1, 1+11=12, 1+11+8=20, 1+11+8+10=30.\n\n        So bw[3]=30.\n\n        Now, Alice: [7,3,20] -> which is the first three: 7, 7+3=10, 7+3+20=30 -> so aw[2]=30.\n\n        Then we have i=2: a=30, hi_bound = 8-2-1=5 -> we search in bw[0:5] -> [1,12,20,30,35]. \n        c1 = bisect_left(bw,30,0,5) -> returns 3? because bw[3]=30.\n        Then c2 = bisect_right(bw,30,0,5)-1 = 4-1=3? because bw[4]=35>30 -> so c2=3.\n        Then total = 2+1 + 3+1 = 3+4=7.\n\n        Then we update mx=7.\n\n        Then we continue: \n            i=3: a=35, hi_bound=8-3-1=4 -> search in [0,4): [1,12,20,30] -> no 35 -> skip.\n            ... \n\n        So we get 7.\n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py is as above.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are doing two binary searches per i (which is n per test case) and the total n is 200000, so the total operations is about 2 * 200000 * log2(200000) ~ 7.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are to count the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers that sum to n. This is a classic partition problem but restricted to palindromic numbers.\n\nWe note:\n   We are to compute the number of partitions of n using only palindromic numbers. And the order does not matter (multiset).\n\nWe can use dynamic programming (unbounded knapsack style). \n\nThe given code:\n   dp = [0 for _ in range(40002)]\n   dp[0] = 1\n   for i in range(1, 40001):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, 40001):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   Then for each test case, we output dp[n].\n\nBut the current dp array is of size 40002 (for n up to 40000). \n\nThe recurrence:\n   If i is a palindrome, then we can use it as a coin. Then we update:\n        for j from i to 40000:\n            dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % mod\n\nBut note: the problem says the answer modulo 10^9+7.\n\nSo we set mod = 10**9+7.\n\nBut the current code does not have mod? \n\nWe should do:\n\n   mod = 10**9+7\n   dp = [0] * (40001+1)\n   dp[0] = 1\n   for i in range(1, 40001):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, 40001):\n                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % mod\n\nBut note: the inner loop runs for about 40000 - i + 1 iterations. The outer loop runs for about 40000 iterations, but only for palindromic i. How many palindromic numbers are there between 1 and 40000? \n\nThe number of palindromic numbers up to 40000: \n   - 1-digit: 9\n   - 2-digit: 9\n   - 3-digit: 9*10=90\n   - 4-digit: 9*10=90\n   - 5-digit: the first digit can be 1,2,3,4 -> then the second can be 0-9, the third 0-9, then the second again? Actually, 5-digit: the first digit: 1,2,3,4 -> 4 choices; the second: 0-9 -> 10; the third: 0-9 -> 10; then the fourth is same as second, fifth as first. But wait, we only need to generate numbers up to 40000. \n\nActually, we can count: \n   The total palindromic numbers up to 40000: \n        up to 4 digits: 9+9+90+90 = 198\n        5-digit: the first digit must be 1,2,3,4. \n            if first digit=1,2,3: then the second and fourth can be 0-9, the third 0-9 -> 3 * 10 * 10 = 300\n            if first digit=4: then the number must be <=40000. \n                the second digit must be 0, then the third must be 0, then the fourth must be 0? \n                so only 40004? but 40004>40000? \n                Actually, the smallest 5-digit palindrome starting with 4 is 40004, which is >40000? \n                So no 5-digit palindrome starting with 4 is <=40000? \n            So total 5-digit: 300.\n\n        Total: 198+300 = 498.\n\nSo the outer loop runs 498 times. The inner loop for a palindromic number i runs (40001 - i) times. The total work is the sum_{i is palindromic} (40001 - i). \n\nThe largest palindromic number is 39993? (the largest palindrome <=40000 is 39993? actually, 39993 is a palindrome? 3,9,9,9,3 -> but that's 5-digit: 39993 -> yes). \n\nThe sum: \n   The smallest i is 1, the largest is 39993. \n   The total work: 498 * 40000 - (sum of all palindromic numbers) \n   The sum of palindromic numbers: we don't need exactly, but note that the inner loop for i=1 runs 40000 times, for i=2 runs 39999 times, ... for i=39993 runs 8 times.\n\nBut the total work is about 498 * 40000 = 19.92e6, which is acceptable in Python? \n\nBut note: the problem says t up to 10000, but we are precomputing dp for n up to 40000. Then each test case is just a lookup.\n\nSo we do:\n\n   mod = 10**9+7\n   max_n = 40000\n   dp = [0]*(max_n+1)\n   dp[0]=1\n   for i in range(1, max_n+1):\n        s = str(i)\n        if s == s[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, max_n+1):\n                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % mod\n\nBut note: the given code has:\n\n   for i in range(1, 40001):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, 40001):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we fill in: \n   dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % (10**9+7)\n\nBut the mod is 10**9+7.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n   dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % (10**9+7)\n\nBut note: we must define mod? Or we can write the modulus as 1000000007? \n\nAlternatively, we can define mod at the top? But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\nThe missing code is the line inside the inner for loop.\n\nSo we write:\n\n   dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % 1000000007\n\nBut note: the program2.py code already has:\n\n   dp = [0 for _ in range(40002)]\n   dp[0] = 1\n\nThen the loop. Then the test cases.\n\nSo we complete the inner loop.\n\nBut note: the array size: 40002 is enough because we only use indices 0 to 40000.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is the line:\n\n   dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % 1000000007\n\nBut note: the modulus operation must be done to avoid overflow.\n\nNow, we output the missing code for both programs in the required JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py, we have a block of code that replaces the for-loop and the bisect part. But note: the original code had:\n\n   for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n        if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that entire block? Actually, we are changing the approach. So we output the entire for-loop block for program1.py.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nWe are replacing the for-loop and the bisect part? Actually, the original code had a for-loop and then a bisect_left and then an if. We are replacing that with a new for-loop that uses two bisects.\n\nSo we output the entire for-loop block for program1.py? But note: the original code had:\n\n   for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n        c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n        if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that with:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        a = aw[i]\n        hi_bound = n - i - 1\n        if hi_bound <= 0:\n            break\n        c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\n        if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\n            c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\n            total = i+1 + c2+1\n            if total > mx:\n                mx = total\n\nBut note: we must not break the structure of the program. The original program had the for-loop and then a print(mx). We are replacing the for-loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is the above block.\n\nBut note: the original code used \"enumerate(aw)\" and we are using \"range(n)\" and then a = aw[i]. That is equivalent.\n\nNow, we output in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"for i in range(n):\\n        a = aw[i]\\n        hi_bound = n - i - 1\\n        if hi_bound <= 0:\\n            break\\n        c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\\n        if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\\n            c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\\n            total = i+1 + c2+1\\n            if total > mx:\\n                mx = total\",\n  \"program2\": \"dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % 1000000007\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 part is only one line. And in the original program2.py, the inner loop is:\n\n   for j in range(i, 40001):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we only need to fill the inner line.\n\nBut wait: the program2.py code has:\n\n   for i in range(1, 40001):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, 40001):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing line is the body of the inner for-loop.\n\nTherefore, we output the line: \"dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % 1000000007\"\n\nBut note: we must use the correct modulus: 10**9+7 = 1000000007.\n\nNow, we write the JSON.\n\nHowever, note: the program1.py code uses bisect and itertools. We are using bisect_left and bisect_right. So we must import bisect? But the original code already has \"from bisect import *\", so we are safe.\n\nBut in the code for program1.py, we are using bisect_right? We must ensure that we have imported it. The original import is \"from bisect import *\", which imports bisect_left and bisect_right? Yes.\n\nSo we are safe.\n\nFinal JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    for i in range(n):\\n        a = aw[i]\\n        hi_bound = n - i - 1\\n        if hi_bound <= 0:\\n            break\\n        c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\\n        if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\\n            c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\\n            total = i+1 + c2+1\\n            if total > mx:\\n                mx = total\",\n  \"program2\": \"            dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - i]) % 1000000007\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation. In program1.py, the for-loop is inside the test case loop. The original code had:\n\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        aw = list(accumulate(w))\n        bw = list(accumulate(w[::-1]))\n        mx = 0\n        ... our code ...\n\nSo the code we are replacing is the ... our code ... part. The original had a for-loop that we are replacing. So we output the for-loop block with the same indentation (one level more than the current). But in the JSON string, we represent it with 4 spaces per level? Actually, we can use the exact code.\n\nIn the program2.py, the inner for-loop body should be indented by 12 spaces? Actually, the original:\n\n   for i in range(1, 40001):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, 40001):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the missing line should be indented by 16 spaces? But we don't need to worry about the exact indentation? The problem says: output the missing code. We output the line that goes in the inner for-loop, and we output it with the same level of indentation as the comment. But the comment is at the same level as the inner for-loop? Actually, the comment is at the same level as the for-loop body. So we output the line with 8 more spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", so for program2 we output the line that replaces the TODO comment. The original had 8 spaces for the inner for-loop body? \n\nActually, the original program2.py:\n\n   for i in range(1, 40001):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, 40001):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the inner for-loop body is indented by 12 spaces? (because the if is 4, then the for is 8, then the body is 12). \n\nBut we are replacing the comment with:\n\n   dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % 1000000007\n\nSo we should output that line with 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation? However, to be safe, we output the line with the same indentation as the comment. Since the comment is at 12 spaces, we output 12 spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we can output without specifying the exact number of spaces? But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the code that can be inserted.\n\nBut the JSON string will have the exact string. So we output:\n\n   for program1: the string \"    for i in range(n):\\n        a = aw[i]\\n        hi_bound = n - i - 1\\n        if hi_bound <= 0:\\n            break\\n        c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\\n        if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\\n            c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\\n            total = i+1 + c2+1\\n            if total > mx:\\n                mx = total\"\n\n   for program2: the string \"            dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - i]) % 1000000007\"\n\nBut note: the program1 code has 8 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the original code inside the test case loop is indented by 4 spaces. Then the for-loop we are replacing should be indented by 8 spaces? But we are replacing the entire for-loop that was originally at 8 spaces? \n\nThe original program1.py:\n\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input())\n        w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        aw = list(accumulate(w))\n        bw = list(accumulate(w[::-1]))\n        mx = 0\n        for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n            ... \n\nSo the for-loop we are replacing is at 8 spaces. Our new for-loop should be at 8 spaces. But we output the code with 4 spaces? Actually, in the JSON string we output the code as a string. We can output:\n\n   \"        for i in range(n):\\n            a = aw[i]\\n            hi_bound = n - i - 1\\n            if hi_bound <= 0:\\n                break\\n            c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\\n            if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\\n                c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\\n                total = i+1 + c2+1\\n                if total > mx:\\n                    mx = total\"\n\nBut that has 8 spaces at the beginning of the for-loop and then more for the inner blocks. \n\nAlternatively, we can output without extra initial spaces? But the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the entire for-loop block that replaces the old for-loop. The old for-loop was at 8 spaces. We output the new for-loop at 8 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and the block we are filling in is the entire for-loop? \n\nActually, the original code had:\n\n        for i, a in enumerate(aw):\n            c = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=len(bw)-i-2)\n            if a==bw[c] and i<(len(bw)-c-1):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that entire block (from the for to the end of the if block) with our new code. So we output:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            a = aw[i]\n            hi_bound = n - i - 1\n            if hi_bound <= 0:\n                break\n            c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\n            if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\n                c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\n                total = i+1 + c2+1\n                if total > mx:\n                    mx = total\n\nBut note: the original had 8 spaces at the beginning of the for-loop. We output the same.\n\nBut in the JSON string, we must escape newlines and quotes? Actually, we are writing a string. We can use \\n for newlines.\n\nSo for program1, the string is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\\n            a = aw[i]\\n            hi_bound = n - i - 1\\n            if hi_bound <= 0:\\n                break\\n            c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\\n            if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\\n                c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\\n                total = i+1 + c2+1\\n                if total > mx:\\n                    mx = total\n\nBut note: the original code had a print(mx) after the for-loop. We are not changing that.\n\nFor program2, the string is:\n\n                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - i]) % 1000000007\n\nBut the original inner for-loop body was at 12 spaces? So we output 12 spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we can count the spaces in the original program2.py:\n\n   for i in range(1, 40001):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, 40001):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe inner for-loop body (the comment) is at 16 spaces? (because the for j loop is at 12 spaces, then the body is 16). \n\nBut the original program2.py code as given:\n\n   for i in range(1, 40001):\n        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:\n            for j in range(i, 40001):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe indentation: \n   for i: 4 spaces\n   if: 8 spaces\n   for j: 12 spaces\n   comment: 16 spaces\n\nSo we output 16 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the line that replaces the comment. So we output:\n\n                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - i]) % 1000000007\n\nwith 16 spaces at the beginning? \n\nBut the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? However, to be safe, we output the same indentation as the comment.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        for i in range(n):\\n            a = aw[i]\\n            hi_bound = n - i - 1\\n            if hi_bound <= 0:\\n                break\\n            c1 = bisect_left(bw, a, hi=hi_bound)\\n            if c1 < hi_bound and bw[c1] == a:\\n                c2 = bisect_right(bw, a, hi=hi_bound) - 1\\n                total = i+1 + c2+1\\n                if total > mx:\\n                    mx = total\",\n  \"program2\": \"                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - i]) % 1000000007\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 code has a closing bracket? We are not. And the program2 code has a minus sign? We wrote \"j - i\", but we can also write \"j-i\". \n\nBut the original program2.py had:\n\n   for j in range(i, 40001):\n\nSo we can write: dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % 1000000007\n\nSo we remove the spaces: j-i.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n  \"program2\": \"                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j-i]) % 1000000007\"\n\nNow, we output the JSON."
