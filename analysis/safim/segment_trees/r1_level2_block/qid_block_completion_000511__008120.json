Actually, x-y-1 < 0  => x-y < 1 => x-y==0 (since x,y integers and x>=y). So the only negative case is when x==y.

Operation2: change the next bit (the last of the first segment) to 0? -> \"100\" -> segments: \"1\" and \"00\" -> then we have one odd and one even?

Actually, we can do: \n                \"111\" -> change the last two to zeros: \"100\" -> segments: \"1\", \"00\" -> then we have one odd. Then we change the first to zero: \"000\" -> one segment of even length -> fixed. That took two operations.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n We are given n, q and a list of prices.\n We sort the prices in descending order and then compute the prefix sums (so that prices[i] becomes the sum of the first i+1 highest prices?).\n But note: we want the maximum total value of free items. The promotion: if you buy at least x items, then the y cheapest of them are free.\n Since we can choose which items to buy, we want to maximize the free value. The free value is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase.\n However, note that we can choose any set of items. To maximize the free value, we want the free items (the y cheapest) to be as expensive as possible.\n How? We should choose a set of exactly x items (because if we choose more, then we might include some cheap items that become free and we could have avoided) and then the free items are the y cheapest in that set.\n\n But note: the problem says \"at least x\", so we can buy more than x? However, if we buy more than x, then we are forced to take the y cheapest from the entire set. But we can also choose to buy exactly x. Why would we buy more? \n Actually, we can always choose to buy exactly x items. Because if we buy more, then the free items are the y cheapest, which might be very cheap. So the optimal is to buy exactly x items and choose the set of x items that maximizes the sum of the y cheapest in that set.\n\n How to maximize the sum of the y cheapest in a set of x items? We want the set to have the largest possible y numbers, but note that the free items are the cheapest in the set. So we want the set to have as many large numbers as possible, but the free items are the smallest in the set.\n\n Alternate approach: \n We want the free value to be as large as possible. The free value is the sum of the y smallest items in the set. To maximize that, we want the set to include as many large numbers as possible, but note that the free items are the smallest. So we can do:\n   We choose the set to be the x largest items. Then the free items are the y smallest in these x largest. Since the entire set is the largest x, the y smallest in that set are the last y of the sorted (ascending) of these x. But we sorted in descending order.\n\n Steps:\n   Sort the prices in descending order: so the largest first.\n   Then the set of x items we choose is the first x in this sorted list (i.e., the x largest).\n   The free items are the y smallest in this set. In the set of x largest, the smallest ones are the last ones in our sorted descending list? Actually, if we have the x largest in descending order, then the last x-y+1 to x are the smallest y.\n\n   Example: [5,5,3,2,1] (descending). If x=3, then the set is [5,5,3]. The two smallest (y=2) are [3,5]? But note: 3 is the smallest and then 5? Actually, the set in ascending order is [3,5,5]. The two smallest are 3 and 5 -> sum=8.\n\n   How to compute the sum of the y smallest in the set of the first x? \n        We have the prefix sum array for the descending list? \n        But note: the prefix sum we built is for the descending order: \n            index0: 5\n            index1: 5+5 = 10\n            index2: 10+3 = 13\n            index3: 13+2 = 15\n            index4: 15+1 = 16\n\n        The set of the first x (x=3) has total = 13.\n        The free items are the y smallest (y=2) in the set. How to get the sum of the two smallest? \n        We can note: the entire set of x=3: [5,5,3]. The two smallest are the last two in ascending order? Actually, we can also think: the set of the first x in descending order: the last y in the set (in the descending order) are the smallest? \n        But note: in descending order, the last element is the smallest. The last two in the set of 3 are the last two of the array? Actually, the set is the first 3: indices0,1,2. The smallest two are at indices1 and 2? No, because the array is [5,5,3] -> the smallest is at index2, and the next smallest is at index1? But 5>3? \n\n        Actually, we need the smallest y in the set. The set of x items in descending order: the last y items (i.e., the last y in the contiguous block of x) are the smallest. Why? Because the array is sorted descending, so the last element in the set is the smallest, the one before last is the next smallest, etc.\n\n        Therefore, the free value = the sum of the last y items in the set of the first x? \n        But note: our prefix sum array is for the entire array in descending order. The set of the first x is from index0 to index x-1. The last y in this set are from index x-y to index x-1? \n\n        Example: x=3, y=2: we want the last two in the set of 3: indices 1 and 2? \n            index1: 5, index2: 3 -> sum=8? But that matches.\n\n        How to get the sum of the segment from x-y to x-1? \n            We have the prefix sum array: \n                prefix[x-1] = prices[0] + ... + prices[x-1]\n                prefix[x-y-1] = prices[0] + ... + prices[x-y-1]   (if x-y-1>=0, else 0)\n\n            Then the sum from x-y to x-1 = prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1]   (if x-y-1>=0, else prefix[x-1])\n\n        But wait: our prefix array is built such that prices[i] is the prefix sum up to index i. So:\n            total_set = prefix[x-1]   (if we consider 0-indexed, the prefix at index x-1 is the sum of the first x elements)\n            The part we don't want (the largest x-y) is the prefix from 0 to x-y-1? \n            Then the free part = prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1]   if x-y-1>=0, but if x-y==0 then we subtract nothing? \n\n        Actually, we can define prefix[-1]=0. Then the sum from a to b (inclusive) is prefix[b] - prefix[a-1]. So for indices [x-y, x-1] we have:\n            a = x-y, b = x-1 -> sum = prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1]\n\n        Example: x=3, y=2: \n            prefix[2] = 13, prefix[3-2-1] = prefix[0]? -> 5? -> 13-5=8 -> correct.\n\n        But what if y=x? Then we want the entire set: \n            prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-x-1] = prefix[x-1] - prefix[-1] -> we need prefix[-1]=0.\n\n        How do we handle negative indices? We can use an array that has a 0 at the beginning.\n\n        However, note our current prefix array: \n            We have: \n                prices[0] = first element (largest)\n                prices[1] = first two, etc.\n\n        We did: \n            for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n                prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n        So we don't have a 0 at the beginning. Then for x-y-1, if x-y-1 is negative we use 0.\n\n        We can do:\n            if x-y-1 < 0:\n                free = prices[x-1]\n            else:\n                free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n        But note: if x-y-1 is negative, then x-y-1 is -1, and we cannot use that index. So we can do:\n\n            total = prices[x-1]   # sum of first x items (indices 0 to x-1)\n            if x-y-1 >= 0:\n                free = total - prices[x-y-1]\n            else:\n                free = total\n\n        However, wait: if y=x, then we want the entire set, so free = total. Then we subtract nothing? \n            free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1] = prices[x-1] - prices[-1] -> but x-y-1 = x-x-1 = -1 -> we don't have an element at -1.\n\n        We can adjust: we want the sum from index (x-y) to (x-1). That is the same as the prefix sum at x-1 minus the prefix sum at (x-y-1). But if x-y-1 is negative, we subtract 0.\n\n        So we can do:\n            base = 0\n            if x-y-1 >= 0:\n                base = prices[x-y-1]\n            free = prices[x-1] - base\n\n        Alternatively, we can create a new prefix array that includes a 0 at the front.\n\n        But note: the problem constraints (n,q up to 200000) and we are in a loop of q. We want to do each query in O(1). \n\n        We can precompute the prefix array with a 0 at the beginning? Actually, we can do:\n\n            prefix = [0] * n\n            prefix[0] = prices[0]\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + prices[i]\n\n            Then for a query (x,y):\n                total = prefix[x-1]   # because we have x items: indices 0 to x-1\n                # the part we want to subtract is the prefix for the first (x-y) items? \n                # Actually, the free part is the last y items: which are the items from index (x-y) to (x-1). \n                # The sum of the first (x-y) items is prefix[x-y-1] (if x-y-1>=0) and then subtract that from total.\n\n            So: \n                if x-y-1 >= 0:\n                    free = total - prefix[x-y-1]\n                else:\n                    free = total\n\n        But note: we sorted in descending order. And we built the prefix array for the descending sorted array.\n\n        However, in the current code we have:\n            prices.sort(reverse=True)\n            for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n                prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n        So prices is now the prefix array without a leading 0. Then for a query (x,y):\n            total = prices[x-1]   # because the first x items: indices 0 to x-1\n            if x-y-1 >= 0:\n                free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n            else:\n                free = prices[x-1]\n\n        But wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? Then we subtract nothing. That matches.\n\n        Example: \n            n=5, prices = [5,5,3,2,1] -> sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n            prefix: \n                index0: 5\n                index1: 5+5=10\n                index2: 10+3=13\n                index3: 13+2=15\n                index4: 15+1=16\n\n            Query: x=3, y=2 -> free = prices[2] - prices[3-2-1] = prices[2] - prices[0] = 13-5 = 8 -> correct.\n            Query: x=2, y=1 -> free = prices[1] - prices[2-1-1] = prices[1] - prices[0]? -> 10-5=5 -> but wait: \n                We choose two items: the two largest: [5,5]. The free is the smallest one: 5 -> correct.\n\n            Query: x=5, y=3 -> free = prices[4] - prices[5-3-1] = 16 - prices[1] = 16-10=6 -> which is the sum of the three smallest: 1+2+3=6 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, for each query we do:\n\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            # We want the free value = the sum of the last y in the first x (in the descending sorted array) = \n            #   if x-y-1 >= 0: prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n            #   else: prices[x-1]   (but note: if x==y, then x-y-1 = -1, so we use the else branch -> then free = prices[x-1] which is the entire set? but that's correct because we get all for free)\n\n        However, note: if x-y-1 is negative, then x-y-1 is less than 0, so we cannot index. But we can do:\n\n            if x-y-1 < 0:\n                base = 0\n            else:\n                base = prices[x-y-1]\n\n            free = prices[x-1] - base\n\n        But wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? Then we subtract 0? That is the same as the else branch above.\n\n        However, note: our array prices is 0-indexed. We cannot access prices[-1] (which would be the last element in a circular way? but that's not what we want). So we must avoid negative indices.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if x-y-1 < 0:\n                free = prices[x-1]\n            else:\n                free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n        But note: if x-y-1 is negative, then x-y-1 is -1, and we don't have an element at -1. So we must avoid that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can build a prefix array that has an extra 0 at the beginning. But the problem says we are not to output the entire program, only the missing part.\n\n        Since the code already reads:\n\n            n, q = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n            prices = [int(price) for price in input().split(\" \")]\n            prices.sort(reverse=True)\n            for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n                prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n        Then we have a while loop for q:\n\n            while q:\n                # ... \n\n        We can do:\n\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            # We want to compute the free value as described.\n\n            # If we have at least x-y items in the prefix (meaning x-y>=1) then we subtract the prefix at index (x-y-1). \n            # But if x-y==0, then we subtract nothing? Actually, if x==y, then we subtract the prefix at index -1? which is not defined.\n\n        How about we create a new array that has a 0 at the beginning? But the problem says we are only to output the missing code. We cannot change the existing code? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if x == y:\n                free = prices[x-1]\n            else:\n                free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n        But what if x-y-1 is negative and not just -1? Actually, x-y-1 is negative only when x-y-1 < 0 -> i.e., x-y < 1 -> x-y==0 (since x,y integers and x>=y). So the only negative case is when x==y.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if x > y:\n                free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n            else: # x==y\n                free = prices[x-1]\n\n        But wait: what if y=0? The problem says y>=1 and x>=y, so y>=1 and x>=y. The minimum y is 1. The minimum x is 1. So the only case where x==y is when x=y, and then we use the entire set.\n\n        However, note: if x=1, y=1: then we subtract prices[1-1-1] = prices[-1] -> which is the last element? That would be wrong.\n\n        Actually, for x=1, y=1: \n            We want the free value: we choose one item, and then the one cheapest (which is the only one) is free. So free = that item's price.\n            How do we get it? \n                We have the array: [largest, ... , smallest] -> the first element is the largest.\n                We choose the set of 1 item: the largest. Then the free value is the largest? \n                But note: the problem says \"the y cheapest of them are free\". The set has one item, so the cheapest is that one. So free = largest.\n\n            Using our formula: \n                if x>y: 1>1 -> false -> so we use the else: free = prices[0] -> which is the largest -> correct.\n\n            But wait: for x=1, y=1: x==y -> so we use free = prices[0] -> correct.\n\n            Now for x=2, y=1: \n                x>y -> true -> free = prices[1] - prices[2-1-1] = prices[1] - prices[0] -> 10-5=5 -> correct.\n\n            For x=3, y=2: free = prices[2] - prices[3-2-1] = 13 - prices[0] = 13-5=8 -> correct.\n\n            For x=3, y=3: free = prices[2] (because x==y) -> 13? but the set of 3 items: [5,5,3] -> the free value is the entire set: 13? but the problem says the free value is the sum of the free items. The entire set is free? Then the free value is 13? \n                But note: the problem says \"if a customer purchases at least x items, the y cheapest are free\". So if x=3 and y=3, then the customer gets the 3 cheapest (which is the entire set) for free. So free value=13 -> correct.\n\n        However, wait: the example in the note: \n            \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n            But in our example, the entire set is [5,5,3,2,1]. The three cheapest are 1,2,3 -> sum=6. \n            How do we get that? \n                We choose the set of 5 items? But the problem says: we can choose any set? Actually, the customer must purchase at least x (which is 5) items. So the customer must buy all 5. Then the free items are the 3 cheapest: 1,2,3 -> sum=6.\n\n            How do we compute that? \n                We have the array sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1] -> prefix: [5,10,13,15,16]\n                Query: x=5, y=3 -> \n                    x>y -> true -> free = prices[4] - prices[5-3-1] = 16 - prices[1] = 16-10=6 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n        But note: the index x-y-1 must be nonnegative? Actually, for x=5, y=3: x-y-1 = 1 -> valid.\n\n        However, what if x=2, y=1: x-y-1 = 0 -> valid.\n\n        The only case that we cannot use the formula is when x-y-1 is negative? But we have already considered: when x==y, then x-y-1 = -1 -> negative. So we avoid that by the if condition.\n\n        But wait: what if x-y-1 is negative and not because x==y? Actually, x-y-1 < 0  => x-y < 1 => x-y==0 (since x,y integers and x>=y). So the only negative case is when x==y.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if x > y:\n                free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n            else:\n                free = prices[x-1]\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"for the given values of x and y (1<=y<=x<=n)\".\n\n        But what if x==y? Then we use the else branch.\n\n        So the code for the while loop:\n\n            while q:\n                x, y = map(int, input().split())\n                if x > y:\n                    # We need to subtract the prefix at index (x-y-1) from the prefix at index (x-1)\n                    result = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n                else:\n                    result = prices[x-1]\n                print(result)\n\n        But note: the array prices is 0-indexed and we have built the prefix for the entire array. However, what if x is 0? The problem says x>=1. So x-1 is at least 0.\n\n        Also, when x-y-1 is at least 0 and at most n-1? \n            x-y-1 <= x-1 <= n-1? because x<=n. So it's safe.\n\n        However, what if x-y-1 is negative? We avoid that by the if.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n is the size of the array. We have built the prefix for the entire array of size n. So for x<=n, the indices x-1 and x-y-1 are in [0, n-1] or negative (only when x-y-1<0, which we avoid).\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            if x > y:\n                print(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n            else:\n                print(prices[x-1])\n\n        But note: the while loop condition: we have q queries. We are using:\n\n            while q:\n                ... \n                q -= 1   # we must decrement q? \n\n        The current code has:\n\n            while q:\n\n        and then we are going to read one query. But we don't decrement q. So we must add:\n\n            q -= 1\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The existing code has:\n\n            while q:\n\n        and then a TODO. So we must complete the block.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            while q:\n                x, y = map(int, input().split())\n                if x > y:\n                    ans = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n                else:\n                    ans = prices[x-1]\n                print(ans)\n                q -= 1\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only replacing the TODO.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a for loop for the q queries? But the existing code uses while q.\n\n        So the missing block for program1.py is:\n\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            if x > y:\n                print(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n            else:\n                print(prices[x-1])\n            q -= 1\n\n        But we must be careful: we are inside a while q: loop. We do this for each query.\n\n        However, we can also do:\n\n            for _ in range(q):\n                x, y = map(int, input().split())\n                ... \n\n        But the existing code uses while q. So we stick to while q and decrement.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            if x > y:\n                print(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n            else:\n                print(prices[x-1])\n            q -= 1\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the existing code has:\n\n            while q:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we replace the TODO with:\n\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            if x > y:\n                print(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n            else:\n                print(prices[x-1])\n            q -= 1\n\n        But note: the existing code has a comment: \n            # 5 5 3 2 1\n            # 5 10 13 15 16\n\n        We leave that as is? The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the TODO and the block under it.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            x, y = map(int, input().split())\n            # We have the prefix array in descending order\n            # The free value is the sum of the last y in the first x (which are the y smallest in the set of the x largest)\n            if x == y:\n                print(prices[x-1])\n            else:\n                # x>y\n                print(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n            q -= 1\n\n        But the condition can be simplified as above.\n\n        Let me test with the example: \n            Query1: x=3, y=2 -> x>y -> prices[2] - prices[0] = 13-5=8 -> correct.\n            Query2: x=2, y=1 -> x>y -> prices[1]-prices[0] = 10-5=5 -> correct.\n            Query3: x=5, y=3 -> x>y -> prices[4]-prices[1] = 16-10=6 -> correct.\n\n        It matches.\n\n        However, note: the example also has a query: \n            \"In the second query, a customer can buy two items worth 5 and 5, the cheapest of them is 5\"\n            So the free value is 5 -> which we got.\n\n        Therefore, we are confident.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n We are given t test cases. The code already reads:\n\n        import re\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            i=p=r=0\n            for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n                i+=1\n                if len(t)&1:\n                    if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n                    else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We have to complete the else branch.\n\n        The problem: \n            We have a binary string s of even length. We want to change the minimum number of bits so that when we break the string into contiguous segments of equal bits, each segment has even length.\n\n        The idea: \n            We break the string into contiguous segments of 0s and 1s. We can get these segments with re.findall('0+|1+', s).\n\n        For each segment, we check if the length is even? \n            If the length is even, we don't need to change anything in that segment? \n            But note: we are allowed to change bits arbitrarily. However, the problem is that we can also merge adjacent segments by changing the bits in the middle? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not require the segmentation to be fixed. We can change bits arbitrarily and then the segmentation is done by grouping contiguous equal bits.\n\n        The key: \n            We want the entire string to be partitioned into contiguous segments of even length. \n\n        Alternate approach from known similar problems: \n            We note that the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even length. This implies that the entire string can be partitioned arbitrarily as long as each segment has even length. \n\n            However, the segmentation is forced by the bits: we break at every change. So we cannot arbitrarily break the string? \n\n        But note: we can change bits arbitrarily. So we can make the entire string alternating? or not? \n\n        Insight: \n            The problem is equivalent to: we want to remove all segments of odd length. How? \n\n            Consider: \n                The string is broken into segments. The condition is that every segment must have even length. \n\n            We can merge two adjacent segments of the same bit? But if we change the bits in the boundary, we can merge adjacent segments.\n\n            Example: \"1110011000\" -> segments: \"111\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\". \n                We have two segments of odd length: \"111\" (3) and \"11\" (2? wait, 2 is even) -> actually the segments are: \n                    \"111\" -> odd, \"00\" -> even, \"11\" -> even? but wait: \"11\" has length 2 -> even, and \"000\" has length 3 -> odd? \n                Actually, the example says: \"111\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\" -> lengths: 3,2,2,3 -> two odd segments.\n\n            How to fix? \n                We can change one bit to merge two adjacent segments? \n\n            Operation: change a bit. This can merge two adjacent segments? \n                Example: change the last bit of the first segment to the opposite bit? Then the first segment becomes length 2 and the next segment becomes length 3? \n                But then we break the next segment? \n\n            Alternatively, we can think: \n                We want to eliminate the odd-length segments. We can merge two consecutive odd-length segments (of the same bit? but they are adjacent and same bit? no, adjacent segments are different bits) by changing one bit in the boundary? \n\n            Example: \n                ...1 0... -> if we change the boundary from 1 to 0, then the segment of 1s loses one and the segment of 0s gains one? \n\n            Actually, consider two consecutive segments: \n                Segment1: '1'*a (a is odd), Segment2: '0'*b (b is odd). \n                If we change the last bit of segment1 to 0, then:\n                    Segment1 becomes '1'*(a-1) -> even? (if a is odd then a-1 is even) -> good.\n                    Segment2 becomes '0'*(b+1) -> even? (b is odd -> b+1 is even) -> good.\n                So one operation fixes two consecutive odd segments.\n\n            What if we have a single odd segment? \n                Example: \"111\" -> we can change one bit in the middle: \n                    Option1: change the middle to 0: \"101\" -> then the segments are: \"1\", \"0\", \"1\" -> each length 1 -> odd -> not fixed.\n                Option2: change the last bit to 0: \"110\" -> segments: \"11\" (even) and \"0\" (odd) -> still one odd.\n                Option3: change the first bit to 0: \"011\" -> same.\n\n            How to fix a single odd segment? \n                We can break it into two segments: one even and one odd? but then we still have an odd segment.\n\n            Alternatively, we can break it by two operations? \n                Example: \"111\" -> \n                    Operation1: change the last bit to 0: \"110\" -> segments: \"11\" (even) and \"0\" (odd) -> still one odd.\n                    Operation2: change the next bit (the last of the first segment) to 0? -> \"100\" -> segments: \"1\" and \"00\" -> then we have one odd and one even? \n                But wait, we can do: \n                    Change the middle: \n                        111 -> 101: then we have segments: \"1\", \"0\", \"1\" -> three segments of odd length -> not fixed.\n                    Then we change one of the ones to zero? \n                        101 -> 001: then segments: \"00\", \"1\" -> one even and one odd -> not fixed.\n\n            Actually, we can do: \n                \"111\" -> change the last two to zeros: \"100\" -> segments: \"1\", \"00\" -> then we have one odd. \n                Then we change the first to zero: \"000\" -> one segment of even length -> fixed. That took two operations.\n\n            But note: we can also do: \n                \"111\" -> change the first and the last: \"010\" -> segments: \"0\",\"1\",\"0\" -> all odd -> not fixed.\n\n            Alternatively, we can merge with the next segment? But the next segment might be of the opposite bit? \n\n            The problem: we are allowed to change any bit arbitrarily. We are not constrained to adjacent segments? \n\n            However, the known solution for this problem (easy version) is: \n                Count the segments of odd length. Then the answer is the number of segments of odd length? \n                But the example: \n                    \"1110011000\" -> segments: [3,2,2,3] -> two odd segments -> but the example note says the answer for the first test case is 3 operations.\n\n            Actually, the example: \n                \"1110011000\" -> becomes \"1100000000\" -> 3 operations.\n\n            How? \n                Original: \"1110011000\" -> \n                    Change the 3rd character (0-indexed? the third is index2) from '1' to '0': becomes \"1100011000\" -> segments: \"11\", \"00\", \"11\", \"000\" -> still two odd? \n                Then change the 6th character (index5) from '1' to '0': \"1100001000\" -> segments: \"11\",\"0000\",\"1\",\"000\" -> still two odd? \n                Then change the 7th character (index6) from '1' to '0': \"1100000000\" -> segments: \"11\",\"00000000\" -> even.\n\n            So 3 operations.\n\n            How does that relate to the odd segments? \n                We started with two odd segments? and we did 3 operations? \n\n            Alternate known solution: \n                We traverse the segments. We keep a variable that remembers the current expected bit? \n\n            Insight from known problems: \n                We can use a stack. We traverse the string and whenever we have two consecutive same bits, we can form an even segment? \n\n            However, note the constraints: the total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n            The code provided uses:\n\n                i = p = r = 0\n                for t in re.findall('0+|1+', s):\n                    i += 1   # i is the segment index\n                    if len(t) & 1:   # if the segment length is odd\n                        if p: \n                            r += i - p\n                            p = 0\n                        else:\n                            # TODO\n\n            What is p? It is initialized to 0. Then when we find an odd segment, if p is non-zero, we do:\n                r += i - p\n                p = 0\n\n            Otherwise, if p is zero, we do something else.\n\n            This suggests: \n                p is used to mark the index of the previous odd segment? \n                Then when we find a new odd segment (and we have a previous one marked by p), we merge them by doing (i-p) operations? and then reset p to 0.\n\n            How many operations? (i-p) operations? \n\n            Example: \n                Let the segments be: \n                    seg1: length odd -> then we set p = i (which is 1) -> but the code in the else branch is missing.\n                Then seg2: even -> skip.\n                Then seg3: odd -> then we have p non-zero (p=1) -> then we do r += 3-1 = 2, and set p=0.\n\n                Then seg4: odd -> then we set p=4? \n                Then no more segments? \n\n            Then total operations = 2? but the example had two odd segments and we did 2 operations? but the example required 3 operations.\n\n            Alternatively, the example had four segments: two odd and two even. The two odd segments are the first and the last? \n\n            How would the code handle? \n                seg1: odd -> set p=1.\n                seg2: even -> skip.\n                seg3: even -> skip.\n                seg4: odd -> then we have p=1 (non-zero) -> then r += 4-1 = 3, and set p=0.\n\n            Then total operations=3 -> matches.\n\n            Therefore, the idea: \n                We pair consecutive odd segments. For two consecutive odd segments (with any number of even segments in between), we can fix both by (current_segment_index - previous_segment_index) operations? \n\n            Why (i-p) operations? \n                The segments are indexed by i (starting at 1). The previous odd segment was at index p, and the current is at index i. The number of segments between them (including the current) is i-p? \n\n            How does that relate to the number of operations? \n                We are going to change one bit per segment in between? \n\n            Actually, the known solution for the problem: \n                We count the number of segments that have odd length. But we cannot fix each odd segment independently. \n                We can fix two odd segments with one operation? but the example used 3 operations for two odd segments? \n\n            Alternatively, the solution: \n                We traverse the segments. We maintain a variable that indicates the parity of the current run? \n\n            But the provided code uses:\n\n                if p: \n                    r += i - p\n                    p = 0\n                else:\n                    ...   # we set p to the current segment index?\n\n            So the missing part in the else branch: \n                We set p to the current segment index? \n\n            Therefore, the else branch: \n                p = i   # because we found an odd segment and we don't have a previous one marked, so we mark this one.\n\n            Then the total operations r is the answer.\n\n            Example: \n                Test case: \"1110011000\" -> segments: \n                    \"111\" -> odd -> p=1 (i=1) -> else branch: p=1.\n                    \"00\" -> even -> skip.\n                    \"11\" -> even -> skip.\n                    \"000\" -> odd -> then if p: true -> r += 4-1 = 3, then p=0.\n\n                Then we output 3 -> matches.\n\n            Another example: \n                The second, third, fourth test cases: initially good -> no odd segments -> then r remains 0.\n\n            But what if we have three odd segments? \n                Example: \n                    segments: odd, even, odd, even, odd -> \n                    i=1: odd -> p=1.\n                    i=2: even -> skip.\n                    i=3: odd -> then we do: r += 3-1 = 2, and set p=0.\n                    i=4: even -> skip.\n                    i=5: odd -> then we set p=5.\n                Then we output 2? \n\n                How many operations? \n                    We fixed the first and third odd segment with 2 operations? \n                    Then we have the fifth odd segment left? \n\n                But the problem: we have to fix all odd segments. The fifth segment is left. How do we fix it? \n                    We need to fix one odd segment: we can do it by one operation? but the code doesn't account for it.\n\n            However, note: the problem says the total n is even. The sum of the lengths of the segments is even. The number of odd-length segments must be even? \n                Why? \n                    The sum of the lengths mod2: \n                        even-length segment: 0 mod2.\n                        odd-length segment: 1 mod2.\n                    The total length is even -> 0 mod2.\n                    Therefore, the number of odd-length segments must be even.\n\n            So we will always have an even number of odd segments. Therefore, we can pair them all.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for the else branch is:\n\n                p = i\n\n            Then the entire program2.py is:\n\n                import re\n                for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    i=p=r=0\n                    for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n                        i+=1\n                        if len(t)&1:\n                            if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n                            else:p=i\n                    print(r)\n\n            But note: the example in the note: \n                First test case: \"1110011000\" -> output 3.\n\n            However, the problem says: \n                \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following. Change s_3, s_6 and s_7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\" -> 3 operations.\n\n            Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But note: the code provided in the problem for program2.py already has:\n\n            print(r)\n\n        at the end? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                ... \n                print(r)\n\n        So we don't need to print again. The missing part is only the else branch.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            p = i\n\n        But note: the existing code has:\n\n            else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n            p = i\n\n        However, we must be careful: the code is:\n\n            if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n            else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can write:\n\n            else:\n                p = i\n\n        But the existing code has no indentation? Actually, the code is given as:\n\n            else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must output the code with the same indentation level.\n\n        Since the if block is:\n\n            if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n\n        which is a one-liner. Then the else should be a one-liner? or we can break it.\n\n        But the problem does not specify the style. We can do:\n\n            else: p = i\n\n        to keep it one line.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            else:\n                p = i\n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code. We are replacing the comment.\n\n        We'll output: \"p = i\"\n\n        But note: the entire block for the else branch is missing. We are replacing the comment and the next line? \n\n        Actually, the existing code has:\n\n            else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing that entire line with:\n\n            else: p = i\n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can output:\n\n            else: p = i\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are only to output the code that goes in the else branch.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output just the assignment: \"p = i\", but then we lose the else.\n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The block for the else is missing. So we output:\n\n            else: p = i\n\n        But note: the existing code has the else: and then a comment. We are replacing that line.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            else: p = i\n\n        However, we can also write it as:\n\n            else:\n                p = i\n\n        But the problem does not specify. Since the if branch is written in one line, we can write the else in one line.\n\n        We choose: \n\n            else: p = i\n\n        But note: the existing code uses no space? The problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only outputting the missing part.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the exact line that replaces the TODO line.\n\n        The TODO line is:\n\n            else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace it with:\n\n            else: p = i\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is: \"else: p = i\"\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the code after the else must be indented? But the if branch is written without indentation? Actually, the if branch is:\n\n            if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n\n        which is one line. So the else branch can be one line.\n\n        Therefore, we have:\n\n            program1: \n                x, y = map(int, input().split())\n                if x > y:\n                    print(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n                else:\n                    print(prices[x-1])\n                q -= 1\n\n            program2: \n                else: p = i\n\n        But note: in program1, we must be careful: the existing code has a while q: loop. We are replacing the TODO block. The existing code has:\n\n            while q:\n                # 5 5 3 2 1\n                # 5 10 13 15 16\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO block with the above 7 lines.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: json.\n\n        We output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"x, y = map(int, input().split())\\nif x > y:\\n    print(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\\nelse:\\n    print(prices[x-1])\\nq -= 1\",\n                \"program2\": \"else: p = i\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program1 code must be exactly the block that goes inside the while loop.\n\n        We write it as a string with newlines.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are not to output the entire program.\n\n        We are confident.\n\n        Let me test program1 with the example:\n\n            Input: \n                5 5\n                5 3 5 1 2\n                Then sort descending: [5,5,3,2,1] -> prefix: [5,10,13,15,16]\n                Queries: \n                    \"3 2\" -> x=3, y=2: output 8 -> correct.\n                    \"2 1\" -> output 5 -> correct.\n                    \"5 3\" -> output 6 -> correct.\n\n        And program2: \n            Input: \n                1\n                10\n                1110011000\n            Output: 3 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output the json.\n\n        Note: the program2 code: we are replacing the line that currently says:\n\n            else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        with:\n\n            else: p = i\n\n        This is one line.\n\n        We are done."
