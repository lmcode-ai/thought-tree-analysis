Alternatively, we can do: left_sum = 0\nright_sum = 0\nleft = 0\nright = n-1\nans = 0\nwhile left < right: if left_sum < right_sum:\n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    else:\n        right_sum += arr[right]\n        right -= 1\n    if left_sum == right_sum:\n        ans = left + (n - 1 - right) But this might not cover all? Actually, we can do: left_sum = 0\nright_sum = 0\nleft = 0\nright = n-1\nans = 0\nwhile left <= right: if left_sum == right_sum:\n        ans = left + (n - 1 - right)   # because left is the count from the left (0-indexed, so left is the number of left candies eaten, and n-1-right is the number of right candies eaten)\n        # then we can try to extend by taking one more from left? left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    elif left_sum < right_sum:\n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    else:\n        right_sum += arr[right] right -= 1 But then we might lose the last update?",

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to address two separate programming challenges: one involving efficient query processing for a store promotion and another involving combinatorial mathematics for tree centroids.\n\n### Approach for Program 1: Store Promotion\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The store has `n` items with given prices. For each query, we need to determine the maximum total value of items received for free when a customer purchases at least `x` items, and the `y` cheapest items among them are free. The challenge is to process these queries efficiently given the constraints (up to 200,000 items and queries).\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: By sorting the prices in descending order, we can efficiently compute the sum of the top `x` items. However, to get the sum of the `y` cheapest items in the top `x`, we need the sum of the last `y` items in the sorted top `x` items. \n   - **Cumulative Sum Array**: We preprocess the sorted array to compute cumulative sums from the end. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any suffix of the sorted array.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Preprocessing**: \n     - Sort the prices in descending order.\n     - Compute a cumulative sum array where each element at index `i` holds the sum of elements from `i` to the end of the array.\n   - **Query Processing**:\n     - For each query `(x, y)`, compute the start index `a = n - x` and end index `b = a + y`.\n     - If `a` is 0, the sum is the last `y` elements of the cumulative array (accessed via negative indexing).\n     - Otherwise, the sum is the difference between the cumulative sums at indices `a` and `b` (if `b` is within bounds).\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Sorting**: O(n log n) time.\n   - **Cumulative Sums**: O(n) time.\n   - **Query Processing**: O(1) per query, leading to O(q) time for all queries.\n   - **Overall Complexity**: O(n log n + q), which is efficient for the given constraints.\n\n### Approach for Program 2: Tree Centroids\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Given a tree with `n` vertices (where `n` is odd), we need to count, for each vertex, the number of trees where that vertex is the centroid. A centroid is a vertex whose removal splits the tree into subtrees each with at most `(n-1)/2` vertices.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Combinatorial Counting**: The solution involves combinatorial mathematics to count valid tree configurations modulo 998244353.\n   - **Modular Arithmetic**: Precompute factorials, inverse factorials, and combinations to efficiently compute the required counts.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Precomputation**:\n     - Compute factorial and inverse factorial arrays up to a maximum value (1,000,000) using modular arithmetic.\n     - Define helper functions for combinations and modular inverses.\n   - **Centroid Counting**:\n     - For each vertex, compute the number of valid trees using combinatorial formulas involving precomputed factorials and combinations.\n     - Adjust counts to ensure the centroid condition is met.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Precomputation**: O(MAX) time for factorial and inverse factorial arrays.\n   - **Main Loop**: O(n) time for processing each vertex.\n   - **Overall Complexity**: O(MAX + n), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    if b < n:\\n        print(l[a] - l[b])\\n    else:\\n        print(l[a])\",\n  \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program 1**: The solution processes each query by leveraging a precomputed cumulative sum array. For a query `(x, y)`, it calculates the sum of the `y` cheapest items in the top `x` items by accessing the cumulative sums. The logic efficiently handles edge cases where the indices might be out of bounds.\n- **Program 2**: The solution uses combinatorial mathematics to count valid tree configurations. By precomputing factorials and their modular inverses, it efficiently computes the number of trees where each vertex is the centroid, adjusting counts to meet the centroid condition. The helper function `modmul` ensures all multiplications and additions are performed under modulo 998244353 to prevent overflow.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the total weight Alice eats (from the left) equals the total weight Bob eats (from the right). They cannot skip candies and they eat from opposite ends.\n\nApproach for program1.py:\nWe can use two pointers: one starting at the left (for Alice) and one at the right (for Bob). We maintain two sums: `left_sum` and `right_sum`. We traverse as follows:\n- If `left_sum` is less than `right_sum`, we move the left pointer to the right and add the candy weight to `left_sum`.\n- If `right_sum` is less than `left_sum`, we move the right pointer to the left and add the candy weight to `right_sum`.\n- If they are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (which is the count from left plus the count from right) and then we try to extend by moving the left pointer (or right, but we can choose one) to see if we can get a longer sequence.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" and similarly for Bob. They don't have to eat consecutively without stopping? But note: they eat in a row from the ends and cannot skip. So they must eat contiguous segments from the ends.\n\nBut note: the example: \nInput: \n4\n1 1 1 1\nOutput: 4? Actually, the example in the note: \nFor the first test case: n=2, weights [1,1] -> answer 2.\nFor the second test case: [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1] -> answer 6? Actually the note says: \n\"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\nWait, note: they are eating from the two ends until they meet. But they cannot eat the same candy. So the total candies eaten is the number of candies from the left (say i+1) and from the right (say j+1) and the condition is that the left segment and the right segment do not overlap.\n\nWe can do:\n- left pointer at index 0, right pointer at index n-1.\n- We let left_sum = 0, right_sum = 0, and we are going to have two pointers: i from left and j from right.\n- We can start by having left_sum = 0 and right_sum = 0, then we can add from left until we exceed the right_sum, then add from right until we exceed the left_sum, etc.\n\nBut note: we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten (i+j+2? actually, if we have eaten i+1 from left and j+1 from right, then total is (i+1) + (j+1) = i+j+2, but note that if i and j cross then we stop).\n\nHowever, the note says: for [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1]: \nAlice eats [2,1,4] (from left: indices 0,1,2) -> total 7.\nBob eats [1,5,1] (from right: indices 7,6,5) -> but wait, the last three: [5,1] is two, and then the next one to the left is 2? Actually, the note says Bob eats the first three from the right: that would be indices 7,6,5: [1,5,2] -> 1+5+2=8? That doesn't equal 7.\n\nWait, the example in the problem: \nInput: \n1\n8\n2 1 4 3 1 2 5 1\nOutput: 6\n\nHow? \nThe note says: Alice eats [2,1,4] (from the left: total 7) and Bob eats [1,2,5] (from the right: but the rightmost three are 1,5,2? but that is 8). \n\nActually, the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three rightmost? But then the weights are 1,5,2? which is 8. \n\nBut wait, the example output is 6, meaning they ate 6 candies. So Alice ate 3 and Bob ate 3? But 3+3=6. However, the weights: \nAlice: [2,1,4] -> 7\nBob: [1,2,5] -> but wait, the rightmost three are [5,2,1]? Actually, the array is [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1]. \nThe rightmost three: starting from the right: first candy: 1 (index7), then 5 (index6), then 2 (index5) -> 1+5+2=8.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says Bob eats from the right without skipping, but they don't have to eat contiguous from the very end? Actually, they must eat a contiguous segment from the right end. So Bob must eat the last candy, then the second last, etc.\n\nBut note: the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are at the rightmost. So the last three: indices 5,6,7? But that would be [2,5,1] -> 2+5+1=8? \n\nWait, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" and then they say the total weight is 7? How?\n\nLet me re-read: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are the rightmost? Then the weights are 1 (last), 5 (second last), 2 (third last) -> 1+5+2=8.\n\nBut the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\". \n\nSo what if Bob eats only two from the right? 1 (last) and 5 (second last) -> 6, then that's not 7. Or if he eats the last one (1) and then the next two? That would be 1 (last) and then 5 and 2? but that is 8.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" meaning he can choose any contiguous segment from the right? But the note says \"first three from the right\", meaning the three rightmost? \n\nBut then how do we get 7? \n\nAnother possibility: the problem says \"from the right\", meaning starting from the right and moving left, but they don't have to be contiguous? But the problem says: \"he can't skip candies\", so he must take contiguous from the right.\n\nWait, the example: \nThe array: [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1]\nIf Alice takes [2,1,4] (leftmost three) -> 7.\nBob takes [1,5,1] but that is not contiguous from the right? The contiguous segment from the right would be the last three: [5,2,1]? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" meaning he can choose a contiguous segment that is a suffix. So the entire segment from some starting point to the end.\n\nSo Bob can choose to eat the last candy: [1] -> 1, or the last two: [5,1] -> 6, or the last three: [2,5,1] -> 8, or the last four: [1,2,5,1] -> 9, etc.\n\nBut then how does Bob get 7? \n\nWait, the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are the rightmost? Then that would be the last three: [2,5,1]? which is at indices 5,6,7? and that is 2+5+1=8.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean: Bob eats the first candy from the right (the last element), then the next candy from the right (the second last), then the next (the third last) and so on. But he can stop at any time. So he doesn't have to take a contiguous segment? But the problem says: \"he can't skip candies\", meaning he must take consecutive candies from the right without skipping. So it is contiguous from the right.\n\nBut then how do we get 7? \n\nI see: the example output is 6, meaning they ate 6 candies. So Alice ate 3 and Bob ate 3? But the weights: \nAlice: [2,1,4] -> 7\nBob: [5,1,?] -> but wait, if Bob eats the last two: [5,1] -> 6, then that's only 2 candies. Then total candies is 5? \n\nAlternatively, the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three that are the rightmost? But then the total weight is 8, which is not 7.\n\nWait, I see the example in the problem statement: \nInput: \n1\n8\n2 1 4 3 1 2 5 1\nOutput: 6\n\nAnd the note says: \"the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total)\".\n\nSo how? \nThey must have eaten 3 from the left and 3 from the right? But the weights from the left: [2,1,4] = 7, and from the right: [1,5,?] -> the last candy is 1, then the next is 5, then the next is 2? so [1,5,2] = 8? \n\nBut wait, the array: \nindices: 0:2, 1:1, 2:4, 3:3, 4:1, 5:2, 6:5, 7:1\n\nIf Alice eats indices 0,1,2: [2,1,4] = 7.\nBob eats indices 7,6,5: [1,5,2] = 8 -> not equal.\n\nAlternatively, if Alice eats indices 0,1: [2,1] = 3, and Bob eats indices 7,6: [1,5] = 6 -> not equal.\n\nOr Alice eats 0,1,2,3: [2,1,4,3]=10, Bob eats 7,6: [1,5]=6 -> not equal.\n\nHow about Alice eats 0,1: [2,1]=3, Bob eats 7,6,5: [1,5,2]=8 -> not equal.\n\nWait, the example says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" meaning the three rightmost? But then the total weight is 8. \n\nBut the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\". \n\nSo how do we get 7? \n\nI see: the problem says \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" meaning he can choose a contiguous segment from the right, but he doesn't have to take the entire contiguous segment from the end? Actually, the problem says: \"he can't skip candies\", meaning if he starts from the right, he must take the first candy (the last one), then the next (the second last), then the next, without skipping. So he must take a contiguous segment that is a suffix. \n\nBut then the total weight of the last three is 1 (index7) + 5 (index6) + 2 (index5) = 8.\n\nWait, but what if Bob doesn't take the entire suffix? He can take a suffix of any length. So he can take the last one: 1, or the last two: 1+5=6, or the last three: 1+5+2=8, or the last four: 1+5+2+1=9, etc.\n\nThere is no suffix that sums to 7? \n\nBut the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" \u2014 that is not possible.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\nSo Alice must take a contiguous prefix? and Bob a contiguous suffix? and they cannot overlap.\n\nBut note: the example: \nThey want the total weight to be equal. \n\nWhat if Alice takes [2,1,4] (prefix of length 3) and Bob takes [1] (suffix of length 1)? Then Alice has 7, Bob has 1 -> not equal.\n\nOr Alice takes [2] and Bob takes [1] -> 2 and 1 -> not equal.\n\nBut the note says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\" for the first test case (which is [1,1] -> 1 and 1 -> equal). \n\nSo for the second test case, how do we get 7 and 7? \n\nWait, the example says: \"the answer is 6\" meaning 6 candies total. So 3 from left and 3 from right. \n\nBut the weights: \nAlice: [2,1,4] -> 7\nBob: [1,2,5] -> but wait, that is not a contiguous suffix? The contiguous suffix of length 3 is [2,5,1] (if we take the last three) which is 8, or if we take the suffix starting at index 4? But the problem says Bob eats from the right without skipping, so he must start at the last candy and then move left without skipping. \n\nBut note: the problem does not say that Bob must take a contiguous segment that is at the very end? It says \"from the right\", meaning he can start at the right and take consecutive candies? But then he can choose any contiguous segment that is a suffix? \n\nBut then how do we get 7? \n\nI see: the problem does not require that the entire segment Bob eats is at the very end? Actually, it does: \"from the right\" and \"can't skip candies\" means that he must take a contiguous suffix. \n\nBut then the only suffixes are:\nlength1: [1] -> 1\nlength2: [5,1] -> 6\nlength3: [2,5,1] -> 8\nlength4: [1,2,5,1] -> 9\netc.\n\nNone of these is 7.\n\nAlternatively, what if Bob doesn't take the entire suffix? But the problem says he can take any number, but he must take consecutive from the right. So he can take the last one, or the last two, etc. But he cannot skip the last one and take the second last. \n\nSo the only possibility is that the note has a different example? \n\nLooking at the sample input: \nThe first test case: n=2, [1,1] -> output 2.\nThe second test case: n=8, [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1] -> output 6.\n\nBut the note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" \n\nBut the total weight of the first three from the left is 2+1+4=7, and the first three from the right: meaning the last three: 1 (last) + 5 (second last) + 2 (third last) = 8? \n\nWait, unless \"from the right\" means starting from the right and moving left, but the problem says \"from the right\", and the example says \"first three from the right\", which should be the three that are the rightmost. \n\nBut then 1 (position 8), 5 (position 7), 2 (position 6) -> 1+5+2=8.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that Bob eats the candies in the order from right to left, but he can stop at any time. So the total weight is the sum of the candies he eats, which are consecutive from the right. \n\nBut then 8 is not 7.\n\nI see: the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" and then says \"with total weight 7\". How? \n\nUnless the array is different? \n\nWait, the array is: [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1] -> the last three are 5,2,1? No, the last three are the last three elements: [5,2,1] is not the order? The array is given from left to right: \nindex0:2, index1:1, index2:4, index3:3, index4:1, index5:2, index6:5, index7:1.\n\nSo the last three (from the right) are: index7:1, index6:5, index5:2 -> 1,5,2 -> 8.\n\nBut the note says Bob eats the first three from the right and gets 7. \n\nWhat if Bob eats the last one (1) and then the next two to the left? But that would be 1 (index7) and then 5 (index6) and then 2 (index5) -> 8.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that Bob eats the first candy from the right (which is 1 at index7), then the next candy from the right (which is 5 at index6), and then the next candy from the right (which is 2 at index5) -> 1+5+2=8.\n\nBut the note says 7.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the note. \n\nLooking at the sample input: \nThe array: [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1] \nWhat if Bob eats only two candies: the last two: 5 and 1 -> 6? \nOr if he eats the last one and the one before the last one: 5 and 1 -> 6? \n\nBut 6 is not 7.\n\nWhat if Bob eats the last one (1) and then the next one (5) and then stops, and then eats one more from the left? But no, Bob only eats from the right.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem allows non contiguous segments? But the problem says \"he can't skip candies\", meaning he must take consecutive from the end.\n\nI see: the sample output is 6, meaning they ate 6 candies. And the condition is that the total weight is equal. \n\nHow can they eat 6 candies? \nAlice eats 3 candies: [2,1,4] = 7\nBob eats 3 candies: but which three? The only contiguous suffix of length 3 is 8. \n\nAlternatively, Alice eats 2 candies: [2,1]=3, Bob eats 4 candies: [1,2,5,1]=9 -> not equal.\n\nOr Alice eats 4 candies: [2,1,4,3]=10, Bob eats 2 candies: [5,1]=6 -> not equal.\n\nOr Alice eats 1 candy: [2]=2, Bob eats 5 candies: [1,2,5,1,?] -> but then they would overlap.\n\nWait, they cannot overlap. The total candies eaten must be non overlapping. \n\nSo the segments are a prefix and a suffix that do not overlap.\n\nWe need to find two non overlapping segments: one at the beginning (prefix) and one at the end (suffix) such that the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix, and we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten (which is the length of the prefix plus the length of the suffix).\n\nSo for the array [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1]:\nWe can have:\nprefix: [2,1,4] (sum=7) and suffix: [1] (sum=1) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2,1] (3) and suffix: [1] (1) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2] (2) and suffix: [1] (1) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2] (2) and suffix: [1,5] (6) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2,1] (3) and suffix: [5,1] (6) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2,1,4] (7) and suffix: [5,1] (6) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2,1,4,3] (10) and suffix: [5,1] (6) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2] (2) and suffix: [2,5,1] (8) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2,1] (3) and suffix: [2,5,1] (8) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2,1,4] (7) and suffix: [2,5,1] (8) -> not equal.\nprefix: [2,1,4,3] (10) and suffix: [2,5,1] (8) -> not equal.\n\nBut wait, what if the suffix is not necessarily the very last ones? The problem says Bob eats from the right without skipping, so the suffix must be contiguous and at the end. \n\nBut then how do we get 7 and 7? \n\nI see: the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" and then says the total weight is 7. \n\nUnless the array is different? \n\nLooking at the sample input in the problem statement: \nInput: \n1\n8\n2 1 4 3 1 2 5 1\n\nBut the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" and then says the total weight is 7. \n\nWhat if the array is: [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1] -> the last three are 5,2,1? But wait, the last element is 1, then the one before is 5, then the one before that is 2? So the suffix of length 3 is [2,5,1]? But that is not contiguous in the array? \n\nNo, the array is given as: \npositions: \n0:2, 1:1, 2:4, 3:3, 4:1, 5:2, 6:5, 7:1.\n\nThe suffix of length 3 is the subarray [5,2,1] starting at index5? No, a suffix must be contiguous and at the end. The suffix of length 3 is the last three: indices 5,6,7: [2,5,1] -> 2+5+1=8.\n\nBut the note says 7. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow non contiguous segments? But the problem says \"can't skip\", so contiguous.\n\nI think there is a known solution for this problem: \nWe use two pointers: \nleft_sum = 0, right_sum = 0\nleft = 0, right = n-1\nans = 0\nwhile left <= right:\n    if left_sum < right_sum:\n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    elif left_sum > right_sum:\n        right_sum += arr[right]\n        right -= 1\n    else:\n        # when equal, we can record the number of candies eaten: left + (n-1 - right)\n        ans = left + (n-1 - right)\n        # then we move the left pointer to try to extend? \n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n\nBut then we might miss the case when after moving left we get equal again? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\nleft_sum = 0\nright_sum = 0\nleft = 0\nright = n-1\nans = 0\nwhile left < right:\n    if left_sum < right_sum:\n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    else:\n        right_sum += arr[right]\n        right -= 1\n    if left_sum == right_sum:\n        ans = left + (n - 1 - right)\n\nBut this might not cover all? \n\nActually, we can do:\n\nleft_sum = 0\nright_sum = 0\nleft = 0\nright = n-1\nans = 0\nwhile left <= right:\n    if left_sum == right_sum:\n        ans = left + (n - 1 - right)   # because left is the count from the left (0-indexed, so left is the number of left candies eaten, and n-1-right is the number of right candies eaten)\n        # then we can try to extend by taking one more from left? \n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    elif left_sum < right_sum:\n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    else:\n        right_sum += arr[right]\n        right -= 1\n\nBut then we might lose the last update? \n\nWe can update the answer only when they are equal, and then we extend from the left. But we also need to consider extending from the right? \n\nActually, we can update the answer whenever they are equal, and then we extend from the left (or right, it doesn't matter, but we choose left). \n\nBut note: we want to maximize the total number of candies.\n\nExample: [1,1] -> \nleft_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equal -> ans = 0 + (2-1 - 1) = 0? \nThen we add arr[0] to left_sum: left_sum=1, left=1.\nThen we have left<=right: left=1, right=1 -> but we haven't processed the right_sum? \nThen we check: left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> so we do: right_sum += arr[1] -> 1, right=0.\nThen left>right -> break.\nBut we never updated ans when left_sum==right_sum at the end? \n\nWe can do:\n\nleft_sum = 0\nright_sum = 0\nleft = 0\nright = n-1\nans = 0\nwhile left <= right:\n    if left_sum == right_sum:\n        # record the current total candies: left (number of left candies) + (n-1 - right) (number of right candies)\n        ans = left + (n - 1 - right)\n        # then we extend from the left to see if we can get a longer sequence?\n        # But note: we might break the equality, but we want the maximum total candies, so we record every time we have equality.\n        # Then we extend from the left? \n        # However, we can also extend from the right? But we want to continue. \n        # We choose to extend from the left.\n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    elif left_sum < right_sum:\n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    else:\n        right_sum += arr[right]\n        right -= 1\n\nBut then for [1,1]:\nStep1: left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equal -> ans = 0 + (2-1-1)=0? \nThen we do: left_sum = 1, left=1.\nNow left=1, right=1: left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> so we do: left_sum < right_sum? no, then else: right_sum += arr[1] -> 1, right=0.\nNow left=1, right=0 -> break.\nBut we never recorded the answer when left_sum and right_sum become 1 and 1? \n\nWe can try to check after the loop? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\nans = 0\nleft_sum = 0\nright_sum = 0\nleft = 0\nright = n-1\n\nwhile left <= right:\n    if left_sum <= right_sum:\n        left_sum += arr[left]\n        left += 1\n    else:\n        right_sum += arr[right]\n        right -= 1\n    if left_sum == right_sum:\n        ans = left + (n - 1 - right)\n\nThen for [1,1]:\nInitialize: left_sum=0, right_sum=0, left=0, right=1.\nFirst: left_sum<=right_sum -> true, so left_sum=1, left=1.\nThen check: 1==0? no.\nThen: now left=1, right=1: left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> else: right_sum=1, right=0.\nThen check: 1==1 -> true, then ans = 1 (left) + (2-1-0) = 1+1=2 -> correct.\n\nThen for the second test case: [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1]\nWe want to see if we get 6.\n\nLet me simulate:\n\nInitialize: left_sum=0, right_sum=0, left=0, right=7.\n\nStep1: left_sum<=right_sum (0<=0) -> true, so add arr[0]=2 -> left_sum=2, left=1.\nCheck: 2==0? no.\n\nStep2: left_sum=2, right_sum=0 -> true, add arr[1]=1 -> left_sum=3, left=2.\nCheck: 3==0? no.\n\nStep3: left_sum=3, right_sum=0 -> true, add arr[2]=4 -> left_sum=7, left=3.\nCheck: 7==0? no.\n\nStep4: left_sum=7, right_sum=0 -> false? 7>0 -> so else: add arr[7]=1 -> right_sum=1, right=6.\nCheck: 7==1? no.\n\nStep5: left_sum=7, right_sum=1 -> false, so else: add arr[6]=5 -> right_sum=6, right=5.\nCheck: 7==6? no.\n\nStep6: left_sum=7, right_sum=6 -> false, so else: add arr[5]=2 -> right_sum=8, right=4.\nCheck: 7==8? no.\n\nStep7: left_sum=7, right_sum=8 -> true? 7<=8 -> true, so add arr[3]=3 -> left_sum=10, left=4.\nCheck: 10==8? no.\n\nStep8: left_sum=10, right_sum=8 -> false, so else: add arr[4]=1 -> right_sum=9, right=3.\nCheck: 10==9? no.\n\nStep9: left_sum=10, right_sum=9 -> false, so else: add arr[3]? but right is 3, and we are at index3? but we already added arr[3] on the left? \n\nWait, we have left=4 and right=3 -> so left>right -> break.\n\nBut we never recorded an answer? \n\nBut we did have an equality at step? no.\n\nBut note: we recorded in step6: after adding the right candy at index5, we had left_sum=7, right_sum=8 -> not equal.\n\nBut when did we have equality? \n\nWe had left_sum=7 at step3, and then we added two from the right: 1 and 5 -> right_sum=6, then we added 2 -> right_sum=8. \n\nBut what if we stop at step5: left_sum=7, right_sum=6 -> then we add one more from the right to get 8, but we skip the state when we had 7 and 6? \n\nAlternatively, we might have had an equality at a different point.\n\nWhat if we do:\n\nWe can also check for equality at every step? \n\nBut in the above simulation, we never had equality.\n\nBut the expected answer is 6.\n\nHow can we get 6? \nWe need a prefix and a suffix that are not overlapping and have the same sum, and the total number of candies is 6.\n\nSo the prefix must be of length i, the suffix of length j, and i+j=6, and the sum of the first i = sum of the last j.\n\nThe array: [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1]\n\nPossibilities:\ni=3, j=3: prefix [2,1,4]=7, suffix [1,5,2] (last three: [2,5,1] -> 8) -> not 7.\nBut wait, the suffix of length 3 is the last three: [5,2,1]? no, the last three are the elements at indices 5,6,7: [2,5,1] -> 2+5+1=8.\n\ni=4, j=2: prefix [2,1,4,3]=10, suffix [5,1]=6 -> not equal.\ni=2, j=4: prefix [2,1]=3, suffix [1,2,5,1]=9 -> not equal.\ni=1, j=5: prefix [2]=2, suffix [3,1,2,5,1]=12 -> not equal.\n\ni=3, j=3 is the only one with 6 candies, but 7!=8.\n\nBut the note says they ate 6 candies and the weights were 7 and 7. \n\nUnless the suffix is not the last three, but the last three taken in order from the right? but then the sum is 1+5+2=8? \n\nI see: the problem might allow Bob to eat the candies in the order from the right, but not necessarily contiguous in the array? But the problem says \"he can't skip candies\", meaning he must take consecutive candies from the right end. \n\nBut then the only contiguous suffix of length 3 is 8.\n\nUnless the array is: [2,1,4,3,1,2,5,1] and Bob eats the last candy (1) and then the next two are not taken consecutively? But that is not allowed.\n\nI think there is a known solution for this problem: \nWe can use a two pointers and a set for the prefix sums. \n\nBut the constraints: the total n over test cases is 200000.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\nLet's compute the prefix sums: P[0]=0, P[i]=w0+...+w{i-1}\nSuffix sums: S[i] = w_i + ... + w_{n-1}\n\nWe want to find i and j such that P[i] = S[j] and i+j <= n (and the segments [0, i-1] and [j, n-1] do not overlap -> so i-1 < j).\n\nThen the total candies is i + (n - j).\n\nWe want to maximize i + (n-j) over all i,j with P[i]=S[j] and i<=j.\n\nBut note: the segments must be non overlapping, so i <= j.\n\nBut we can do:\n\nFor a fixed i, we want to find a j>=i such that S[j] = P[i]. Then the total candies is i + (n-j).\n\nWe can iterate i from 0 to n, and for each i, we can check if there is a j>=i such that S[j]=P[i]. And we want the maximum i+n-j.\n\nBut the total n over test cases is 200000, but the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\nBut note: the constraints say the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nFor each test case:\n  n = ... \n  w = list of n integers.\n  prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n  for i in range(1, n+1):\n      prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\n\n  suffix = [0]*(n+1)\n  for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n      suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\n\n  # Now, we want to find i in [0, n] and j in [i, n] (actually j in [i, n] but note: the suffix array: suffix[j] is the sum from j to n-1.\n  # But note: our prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements (indices0 to i-1).\n  # suffix[j] is the sum from j to n-1.\n  # We require that the segments do not overlap: the last index of the prefix is i-1, and the first index of the suffix is j, so we require i-1 < j -> j>=i.\n\n  # We want to maximize i + (n - j) = n + (i - j) -> but i-j is negative, so we want to minimize j-i.\n\n  # Alternatively, we can use a dictionary to store the suffix sums and their corresponding indices? But we want the smallest j for a given suffix sum? because then i + (n-j) is maximized.\n\n  # But note: we iterate i from 0 to n, and for each i, we want to know if there is a j>=i+1 (because the prefix ends at i-1, so the suffix must start at j>=i) such that suffix[j] = prefix[i]. And we want to maximize i + (n-j).\n\n  # We can precompute: for j from n down to 0, store the suffix[j] and the j. But we want the smallest j (which is the leftmost starting index for the suffix) for a given suffix sum? because then n-j is larger? Actually, for fixed i, we want the smallest j (>=i) such that suffix[j]==prefix[i] -> then the total candies = i + (n - j) is maximized.\n\n  # But we can do: \n  # Create a dictionary that maps a sum to the smallest j (largest j? wait) that has that suffix sum. But note: j is from 0 to n. We want j>=i, so we want the smallest j (the earliest starting index) that is >=i? \n\n  # Alternatively, we can iterate i from 0 to n, and we can have a pointer j from n down to i, and use two pointers? \n\n  # But we can do: \n  # Let j = n\n  # We'll create a dictionary for the suffix sums that we have seen, but we want to know the smallest j for a given sum? \n\n  # Instead, we can iterate i from 0 to n, and for each i, we want to know if there is a j in the range [i, n] such that suffix[j] = prefix[i]. We can precompute an array for suffix sums and then use a Fenwick tree? But that is overkill.\n\n  # Alternatively, we can iterate i from 0 to n, and then use binary search on j? But the sums are not sorted.\n\n  # We can do: \n  # Create a set for the suffix sums that we have seen for j from n down to 0, but we want to know the smallest j for a given sum. \n\n  # We can do: \n  # Let's create a dictionary: suffix_dict, and we will iterate j from n down to 0, and for each j, we set suffix_dict[suffix[j]] = j   (this will store the smallest j for that suffix sum, because we are iterating from high j to low j, and we want the smallest j? Actually, j is the starting index, and we are iterating from n down to 0, so the first time we see a sum we store the largest j? but we want the smallest j (which is the earliest index) for the suffix. \n\n  # Actually, j is the starting index of the suffix. We want the smallest j (which is the earliest starting index) that yields a given suffix sum.
