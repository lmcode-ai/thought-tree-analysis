But wait: what if we have a mixed pair at the beginning? Then last_fixed remains None, and we skip. Then we set fixed_groups=0? Then we set it to 1. However, what if we have:\n\n            Example: \"01\" (one pair, mixed) -> then we skip, so fixed_groups=0 -> then set to 1. Correct: we set it to 0 or 1 -> one group. Example: \"00\" ( one pair, fixed) -> fixed_groups=1.\n\n          Example: \"00\", \"01\", \"11\": \n            pair0: \"00\" -> fixed, last_fixed='0', fixed_groups=1.\n            pair1: \"01\" -> skip.\n            pair2: \"11\" -> fixed, and '1' ! = '0' -> fixed_groups=2. Then minimal groups = 2.\n\n          But note: we can set the mixed pair to either 0 or 1. If we set it to 0: then we have \"00\", \"00\", \"11\" -> groups: [00,00] and [11] -> 2 groups. If we set it to 1: then we have \"00\", \"11\", \"11\" -> groups: [00], [11,11] -> 2 groups. So 2 groups is minimal. However, what if we have:\n\n            \"00\", \"01\", \"00\": \n                fixed_groups: \n                  pair0: fixed '0' -> groups=1, last_fixed='0'\n                  pair1: skip\n                  pair2: fixed '0' -> same as last_fixed -> groups remains 1. Then minimal groups = 1? \n\n          How? We set the mixed pair to 0: then we have \"00\", \"00\", \"00\" -> one group. So that matches. Therefore, the algorithm for the second integer (minimal groups) is:\n\n            fixed_groups = 0\n            last_fixed = None   # will store the last fixed bit we encountered (from a fixed pair)\n\n            for i in range(n//2):\n                idx = 2*i\n                if s[idx] == s[idx+1]:\n                    b = s[idx]\n                    if last_fixed is None:\n                        fixed_groups = 1\n                        last_fixed = b\n                    else:\n                        if last_fixed != b:\n                            fixed_groups += 1\n                            last_fixed = b\n            if fixed_groups == 0:\n                fixed_groups = 1\n\n          Then we output: (operations, fixed_groups) But wait: what if we have a test case that has no fixed pairs? Then we set fixed_groups=1. And operations = number of mixed pairs.",

But we can achieve 2 groups? Then that is minimal. Therefore, the algorithm for the groups is: we count the fixed groups (by ignoring the variable pairs) and then set the groups = max(1, fixed_groups). However, the sample test case: \n            \"00\" -> fixed_groups=1 -> output 1 -> correct. \"11\" -> fixed_groups=1 -> output 1 -> correct. \"0101\" -> fixed_groups=0 -> output 1 -> correct. But wait: what if we have:\n\n            s = \"0001\" -> \n                pairs: \n                  pair0: \"00\" -> fixed (0) -> fixed_groups=1, last_fixed='0'\n                  pair1: \"01\" -> mixed -> skip. Then fixed_groups=1 -> output groups=1. How can we achieve 1 group? We set the mixed pair to 0: then we have \"00\" and \"00\" -> one group? But wait: the entire string becomes \"0000\", which is one segment? Yes. So that matches. Therefore, the code for each test case:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            operations = 0\n            fixed_groups = 0\n            last_fixed = None\n\n            # iterate over the pairs\n            for i in range(n//2):\n                a = s[2*i]\n                b = s[2*i+1]\n                if a == b:\n                    # This is a fixed pair (originally same)\n                    if last_fixed is None:\n                        fixed_groups = 1\n                        last_fixed = a\n                    else:\n                        if a != last_fixed:\n                            fixed_groups += 1\n                            last_fixed = a\n                else:\n                    operations += 1\n\n            if fixed_groups == 0:\n                fixed_groups = 1\n\n            print(operations, fixed_groups)\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we are safe.",

Actually, the template sets mseg=1 initially, and then we don't change it in the if branch? How the template works:\n\n            Initially: mseg=1, prebit=None. For the first fixed pair:\n                we enter else: \n                    if prebit is None -> set prebit = s[2*i] -> but we don't change mseg? Then mseg remains 1. Then for the next fixed pair that is the same: \n                else branch: prebit is not None -> then if s[2*i] ! = prebit? -> no -> so we do nothing. Then for the next fixed pair that is different:\n                else branch: s[2*i] ! = prebit -> then mseg +=1 and set prebit to the new bit. This matches. But note: what if the first pair is mixed? Then we do:\n\n            res +=1, and skip the else branch. Then the next pair is fixed: \n                then we enter else: \n                    prebit is None -> so we set prebit = s[2*i] -> and we don't change mseg? Then mseg remains 1. Then if we have another fixed pair that is the same: do nothing. Then if we have a fixed pair that is different: then we do mseg +=1. So the minimal groups is mseg.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given an even integer n and a binary string s of length n.\n We need to output two integers for each test case:\n   - the minimum number of operations to make s good (i.e., after operations, the string can be partitioned into contiguous subsegments of even lengths and same characters)\n   - the minimum number of subsegments that s can be divided into among all solutions with the minimum number of operations.\n\n Observation:\n In the final string, we require that every contiguous segment of same characters has even length.\n\n We can note that the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even lengths. Therefore, we can think of grouping the string in blocks of two (adjacent) characters.\n\n However, note that the problem allows us to change any character arbitrarily. We are to minimize the number of changes and then among those solutions, minimize the number of subsegments.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Let's consider the requirement: the string must be partitioned into contiguous segments of even lengths and same character. This means that we can break the string arbitrarily, but each segment must have an even number of the same character.\n\n We can also note that we can break the string only at positions where two adjacent characters are different? Actually, we break when the character changes. But note: we can also change characters arbitrarily.\n\n How to approach?\n\n Step 1: Count the minimum operations.\n\n Notice that in the final string, for every two consecutive characters (at positions 2i and 2i+1) they must be equal? Why?\n   Because if we have a segment of even length, then at the very least, the segment must cover an even number of characters. However, we can have a segment that is longer than 2. But note: we can break the string arbitrarily as long as the segments are contiguous and of even length.\n\n However, consider: we can have a segment of length 4: \"0000\", which is two adjacent pairs: \"00\" and \"00\". But note that the two adjacent pairs are both \"00\", so they are the same. Therefore, we can break the string at any even boundary? Actually, we can break only when the next character is different. But if we break, we require that the segment we just finished is even. However, we can also have a segment that spans multiple pairs.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that we break at every two characters. We break only when the adjacent character changes. However, we are allowed to change characters arbitrarily.\n\n Alternate known solution for similar problems:\n\n There is a known problem: we can consider that the entire string must be partitioned into blocks of two, but we are allowed to change characters arbitrarily. However, note that we are not forced to break every two characters. We can have a segment of 4, 6, etc.\n\n However, note: the condition for the segment is that all characters are the same and the length is even. Therefore, we can break the string arbitrarily at even positions? Actually, we can break at any position, but then we must have even-length segments. However, the problem says \"contiguous subsegments\" and \"all bits in each subsegment are the same\".\n\n How about we consider the following:\n\n We can break the string at any index, but then we must have that the segment from the last break to the current break has even length and same character. This is complex.\n\n Insight from known solutions for the same problem:\n\n After reading the note and known solutions for Codeforces problems (like \"Tokitsukaze and Good 01-String\"), we know:\n\n We traverse the string by pairs (i.e., two consecutive characters at positions 2i and 2i+1). For each pair, we have two possibilities:\n\n   - If the two characters are the same, then we can leave them as they are (no operation needed for this pair).\n   - If they are different, then we must change at least one of them to make them equal. But note: we can change either one. So we count one operation for this pair.\n\n However, that gives the minimum operations: for each pair, if they are not equal, we need one operation to fix (because we can change one of them to match the other). But note: we are allowed to change both? Actually, we can change both to any value. However, the minimal operation for a pair that is not equal is 1 (because we can change one of them to the other). So the total operations is the number of pairs that are not \"00\" or \"11\".\n\n But wait: what if we change both? Then we use two operations. But we are minimizing operations, so we would never do that? Actually, we can change both to a third value? But the string is binary. So if we have \"01\", we can change the first to 0 and the second to 0 (then we get \"00\", which is good) and that is one operation (if we change only one) or two if we change both. So minimal is one.\n\n Therefore, the minimum operations is the count of pairs that are not \"00\" and not \"11\".\n\n However, note: what about pairs that are \"01\" or \"10\"? They both are not same, so we count one operation for each.\n\n So first integer: res = number of pairs i (from 0 to n/2-1) such that s[2*i] != s[2*i+1].\n\n Now, the second part: we want the minimum number of subsegments among all solutions that use the minimum operations.\n\n How do we form the segments? We have fixed the pairs to be either \"00\" or \"11\" (after our operations). But note: we have freedom in how we assign the values for the pairs that we fixed. For a pair that was originally not the same, we can choose to make it either \"00\" or \"11\". \n\n Now, the entire string is a sequence of pairs. Each pair is either \"00\" or \"11\". Then we break the string at positions between pairs if two adjacent pairs are different. For example:\n\n   \"00 00 11 00\" -> segments: [00 00], [11], [00] -> 3 segments.\n\n But note: we can also merge adjacent pairs that are the same? Actually, the segmentation is by consecutive same characters. However, note that each pair is two same characters. So if we have two consecutive pairs of \"00\", then they form a segment of four zeros? Or can we break in the middle? The problem says: we break when the character changes. So if we have \"0000\", we don't break in the middle? So it's one segment.\n\n Therefore, the number of segments is the number of groups of consecutive same pairs? But note: two consecutive pairs of \"00\" are the same character, so they form one segment. However, if we have \"00\" followed by \"11\", then we break.\n\n But note: what if we have \"00\" then \"00\"? They are the same, so we don't break. So the entire block of consecutive zeros (in terms of pairs) is one segment.\n\n Therefore, the number of segments is the number of contiguous groups of pairs that have the same bit? Actually, but note: the pairs are of two same bits. So the entire string of pairs is a sequence of groups of consecutive pairs that have the same bit (either 0 or 1). The number of segments is the number of groups.\n\n However, we have a choice: for the pairs that we fixed (the ones that were originally mixed), we can choose to set them to either 0 or 1. Therefore, we can choose the bit for each such pair arbitrarily.\n\n Our goal: minimize the number of segments (groups) in the entire string.\n\n How do the choices affect the segments?\n\n Consider the sequence of pairs. Each pair is now either:\n   - fixed to 0 (if originally \"00\") -> we call this type 0\n   - fixed to 1 (if originally \"11\") -> we call this type 1\n   - variable: we can choose 0 or 1 (if originally mixed, but we fixed it to either \"00\" or \"11\", so we have a choice)\n\n Now, we want to assign the variable pairs to 0 or 1 so that the total number of contiguous groups (where a group is a maximal consecutive sequence of pairs with the same bit) is minimized.\n\n How to compute the minimal groups?\n\n We note that the fixed pairs are already set. The variable pairs we can choose arbitrarily.\n\n We can traverse the sequence of pairs and use dynamic programming? But note: the total length of all test cases is at most 200,000, so we need an O(n) solution.\n\n Alternatively, we can note:\n\n The groups are separated by boundaries between adjacent pairs. The boundary between two consecutive pairs (say pair i and pair i+1) will be a break (i.e., a new segment) if the two pairs have different bits.\n\n Therefore, the total number of groups is 1 (for the first group) plus the number of boundaries where the current pair is different from the next.\n\n So: groups = 1 + (# of indices i from 0 to (n/2-2) such that the bit of pair i != the bit of pair i+1)\n\n Now, we can choose the bits for the variable pairs arbitrarily. We want to minimize the total groups.\n\n How to minimize the groups? We can choose the bits for the variable pairs to avoid creating a boundary when adjacent to fixed pairs? \n\n However, note: we can also merge groups by setting a variable pair to the same as its neighbor.\n\n But note: the fixed pairs are fixed. So we have:\n\n   Let the sequence of pairs be an array A[0..m-1] (m = n/2). For each index i, A[i] can be:\n        - 0: fixed to 0\n        - 1: fixed to 1\n        - -1: variable (we can choose 0 or 1)\n\n We want to assign the variable pairs to minimize the total groups.\n\n We can use a greedy approach:\n\n   We traverse the array and whenever we encounter a variable, we can set it to the same as the previous fixed or variable that we set? But note: we want to minimize the breaks.\n\n   However, we can also note: the minimal groups we can achieve is at least the number of groups we would have if we set all variable pairs arbitrarily to avoid breaks. But note: we can set each variable independently? Actually, we can set them to avoid breaks with both neighbors? But we cannot avoid breaks if the two neighbors are fixed and different.\n\n   Actually, the minimal groups is the number of groups in the fixed pairs if we ignore the variables? But we can merge groups by setting variables appropriately.\n\n   Known solution: the minimal groups is the number of contiguous groups of fixed pairs? But we can merge adjacent groups of fixed pairs if they are the same and the variable pairs in between are set to that same value? However, note: the fixed groups might be separated by a block of variable pairs.\n\n   Actually, we can note:\n\n     The entire sequence of pairs is going to be a sequence of groups. The groups are separated by boundaries. We can avoid a boundary at a variable if we set it to the same as the next fixed? But we have to consider the entire run.\n\n   Alternate known solution from similar problems (Codeforces):\n\n     We can note that the minimal number of groups is at least 1.\n\n     We can do:\n\n        Let m = n//2.\n\n        We traverse the pairs and form groups. We can start with the first pair:\n\n          If the first pair is fixed, then we start a group of that bit.\n\n          If the first pair is variable, then we can set it arbitrarily? But we have to see the next.\n\n        Actually, we can use a greedy grouping:\n\n          We can set the entire sequence of consecutive variable pairs to the same bit? But note: if we have a fixed pair at the beginning, then we set the next variable pairs to that fixed bit until we see a fixed pair that is different? Then we break.\n\n        However, we can also set the variable pairs to bridge between two fixed groups of the same bit? For example:\n\n          fixed: 0, then variable, then fixed: 0 -> we can set the variable to 0 and merge the two fixed groups.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal groups is the number of groups we get after merging adjacent fixed groups of the same bit that are separated by variable pairs? But note: we can also merge if the variable pairs are set to the same bit as the fixed groups.\n\n        How about we ignore the variable pairs? Then we have a sequence of fixed groups. Then the minimal groups we can achieve is the number of fixed groups? But we can merge two fixed groups of the same bit if there is a variable block between them? \n\n        Actually, we can merge two fixed groups of the same bit that are adjacent (with only variable pairs in between) by setting the entire variable block to that same bit.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal groups is the number of fixed groups? But note: if we have two fixed groups of the same bit separated by variable pairs, we can merge them into one group. So the minimal groups is the number of groups of fixed pairs that are separated by at least one fixed pair of a different bit? And we can merge the variable runs arbitrarily to the adjacent fixed groups.\n\n        However, what if we have:\n\n          fixed: 0, then variable, then fixed: 1 -> then we cannot merge the variable run with both? We have to break: the variable run must be set to either 0 or 1. If we set to 0, then we break at the next fixed (0 to 1). If we set to 1, then we break at the previous fixed (0 to 1). So we cannot avoid a break.\n\n        Therefore, the breaks between fixed groups of different bits are unavoidable.\n\n        So the minimal groups is the number of contiguous fixed groups? But note: we can also have variable runs at the beginning or the end. For example:\n\n          variable, then fixed 0, then variable: we can set the beginning variable to 0 and the end variable to 0? Then we have one group.\n\n        Actually, the minimal groups is the number of contiguous fixed groups? But we can merge a variable run at the beginning with the next fixed group? Similarly at the end.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal groups is the number of fixed groups? But note: if there are no fixed groups, then we have one group (if we set all to 0 or all to 1).\n\n        How to count the fixed groups? We can traverse the pairs and note:\n\n          We skip the variable pairs? Then we look at the fixed pairs. But we have to account for consecutive fixed pairs of the same bit: they form one group.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          Let groups = 0\n          Let last_fixed = None   # the last fixed bit we encountered\n\n          Then traverse the pairs:\n\n            If the pair is fixed (say bit b):\n                If last_fixed is None, then we start a new group (groups++ and set last_fixed = b)\n                Else if last_fixed != b, then we have a new group (groups++ and last_fixed = b)\n                Else (last_fixed == b), then we are in the same group, do nothing.\n\n          But what about the variable pairs? We are skipping them? Then we are only counting the fixed groups. However, we can merge variable runs between fixed groups of the same bit? So if we have:\n\n            fixed0 -> variable -> fixed0: we can merge, so we don't count the second fixed0 as a new group? But in our traversal we skip the variable, so we see two fixed0's in a row? Then we don't count the second fixed0 as a new group? Actually, we see the first fixed0: groups=1, last_fixed=0. Then we skip the variable. Then we see the next fixed0: since last_fixed==0 and current is 0, we do nothing. So groups remains 1.\n\n          But what if we have:\n\n            fixed0 -> variable -> fixed1: we see fixed0: groups=1, last_fixed=0. Then skip variable. Then fixed1: groups becomes 2, last_fixed=1.\n\n          This matches: we have two groups.\n\n          However, what if we have a run of variable pairs at the beginning? Then we don't have a fixed pair until later. How do we account for that? We can set the entire beginning variable run to the same bit? Then when we see the first fixed pair, we can merge if we set the variable run to that fixed bit? But note: we haven't encountered a fixed pair, so we can set the variable run arbitrarily. Then the entire beginning variable run and the next fixed group (if we set the variable run to the same as the fixed group) become one group.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal groups is the number of fixed groups? But note: if there is at least one fixed group, then we can set the variable runs at the beginning and end to the adjacent fixed group? Then the groups we count above (the fixed groups) are the only groups? However, what if there are no fixed groups? Then we have all variable pairs. Then we can set them all to 0, so we have one group.\n\n          But in our fixed groups count, if there are no fixed groups, we get groups=0? Then we need to set it to 1.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal groups = max(1, number of fixed groups) ?\n\n          However, consider: what if we have two fixed groups of the same bit separated by a variable run? We can merge them? Then the fixed groups count would have counted them as one group? Actually, in our traversal we skip the variable, so we see the two fixed groups as consecutive same? Then we count only one group.\n\n          But wait: if we have:\n\n            fixed0 -> variable -> fixed0: we see two fixed0's in a row? Then we count one group.\n\n          How about:\n\n            fixed0 -> variable -> fixed0 -> variable -> fixed0: we see three fixed0's? Then we count one group.\n\n          So the fixed groups count is the number of contiguous groups of fixed pairs of the same bit? Actually, we are grouping consecutive fixed pairs that are the same. But note: if we have fixed0, then fixed1, then fixed0, we count three groups? Actually, we break when the fixed bit changes.\n\n          Therefore, the fixed groups count is the number of contiguous segments of fixed pairs that are separated by a change in the fixed bit? And we skip the variable pairs.\n\n          But note: we can merge adjacent fixed groups of the same bit that are separated by variable runs? Our traversal already merges consecutive fixed pairs of the same bit (even if there are variable runs in between) because we skip the variable runs? Actually, no: our traversal only looks at fixed pairs. When we skip the variable runs, we are effectively looking at the fixed pairs in order. Then if two fixed pairs of the same bit are separated by a variable run, we see them as consecutive? Then we do:\n\n            first fixed0: groups=1, last_fixed=0.\n            then we skip the variable run and see the next fixed0: since last_fixed==0, we do nothing? So groups remains 1.\n\n          Therefore, the fixed groups count is the number of contiguous groups of fixed pairs (by same bit) without considering the variable runs? And we are merging same bits that are adjacent (with variable runs in between) because we skip the variable runs? Actually, we are not skipping the variable runs in the sense of the fixed pairs being adjacent? We are just ignoring the variable runs. So if we have:\n\n            fixed0, then variable, then fixed0: we see two fixed0's in a row? Then we count one group.\n\n          But if we have:\n\n            fixed0, then variable, then fixed1: we see fixed0 then fixed1 -> two groups.\n\n          So the fixed groups count is the number of groups we get by collapsing the entire sequence of pairs to the fixed pairs (ignoring the variable runs) and then counting the groups in that collapsed sequence (where consecutive same bits are merged).\n\n          However, what if we have:\n\n            fixed0, then variable, then fixed0, then variable, then fixed1: \n                fixed0: groups=1, last_fixed=0.\n                then skip variable -> then fixed0: same as last_fixed -> do nothing.\n                then skip variable -> then fixed1: different -> groups=2, last_fixed=1.\n\n          So we get 2 groups.\n\n          But note: we can set the first variable run to 0 and the second variable run to 0? Then we have: \n                fixed0 (0) -> variable set to 0 -> fixed0 (0) -> variable set to 0 -> fixed1 (1)\n                Then the groups: [0,0,0,0] (one group) and [1] (another group) -> 2 groups.\n\n          Alternatively, set the second variable run to 1? Then we have:\n                [0,0] -> group1, then [0,1] -> but wait: the second variable run is set to 1? Then the sequence becomes: \n                  00 (from fixed0) -> 00 (from variable set to 0) -> 00 (from fixed0) -> 11 (from variable set to 1) -> 11 (from fixed1) -> \n                  Actually, the pairs: \n                    pair1: 00 -> 0\n                    pair2: 00 -> 0\n                    pair3: 00 -> 0\n                    pair4: 11 -> 1\n                    pair5: 11 -> 1\n                  Then the groups: [00,00,00] (one group) and [11,11] (another group) -> 2 groups.\n\n          But what if we set the entire variable runs to 0? Then we have:\n                fixed0 (0) -> variable set to 0 -> fixed0 (0) -> variable set to 0 -> fixed1 (1)\n                Then the entire first four pairs are 0? Then we have: [0000] (the first four zeros) and then [11] -> 2 groups.\n\n          So we cannot avoid 2 groups.\n\n          Therefore, the fixed groups count (by collapsing the variable runs) is exactly the minimal groups we can achieve? \n\n          However, what if we have no fixed pairs? Then the fixed groups count is 0, but we need at least one group. So we set groups = max(1, fixed_groups_count).\n\n          But wait: what if we have a fixed group at the beginning and then a variable run at the end? We can set the variable run at the end to the same as the last fixed group? Then we don't create a new group. So the entire string becomes one group? Then the fixed groups count is 1 (from the fixed group) and we set the variable run to that same bit -> one group.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal groups is the number of contiguous groups of fixed pairs (by same bit, ignoring the variable runs) and then we set the variable runs to the adjacent fixed groups? Then the groups remain the same as the fixed groups count? But if there are no fixed groups, then we set groups=1.\n\n          So: minimal groups = fixed_groups_count if fixed_groups_count >= 1, else 1.\n\n          How to compute fixed_groups_count?\n\n            We traverse the pairs (each pair is represented by an index i from 0 to m-1, where m = n//2).\n\n            We'll create an array of the fixed bits for each pair that is fixed, and for variable we put None.\n\n            Then we traverse the array and:\n\n                groups = 0\n                last = None   # last fixed bit we encountered\n\n                for each pair in the array:\n                    if the pair is fixed (say bit b):\n                        if last is None:\n                            groups = 1\n                            last = b\n                        else:\n                            if b != last:\n                                groups += 1\n                                last = b\n                        # if b==last, we do nothing.\n\n            Then if groups==0, set groups=1.\n\n          However, note: what if we have two consecutive fixed pairs that are the same? We don't increase the group count? That's correct because they are in the same group.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so we can do this.\n\n          However, we can do without building an array? We can traverse the string by pairs and do:\n\n            m = n//2\n            fixed_groups = 0\n            last_fixed = None\n\n            for i in range(m):\n                a, b = s[2*i], s[2*i+1]\n                if a == b:\n                    # This pair is fixed? But note: we are going to fix the mixed ones arbitrarily? Actually, for the fixed_groups, we only consider the pairs that are fixed originally? \n                    # But wait: the problem is that we have a choice for the mixed ones. However, for the purpose of the fixed groups, we are going to consider the fixed pairs (the ones that are already same) and ignore the mixed ones? \n                    # Actually, the mixed ones we can set arbitrarily, so they are not fixed? They are variable.\n\n                    # So we only consider the pairs that are same (without any change) as fixed? But note: we are going to change the mixed ones, so they become either 00 or 11, but we can choose. So they are not fixed? They are variable.\n\n                    # Therefore, we only consider the pairs that are originally same? \n\n                    # However, note: the problem does not require that we use the original value for the mixed pairs? We are free to choose. So the fixed pairs are the ones that are originally same.\n\n                    # Therefore, for a pair that is originally same, we have a fixed bit: the bit that they are.\n\n                    bit = a   # since a==b\n                    if last_fixed is None:\n                        fixed_groups = 1\n                        last_fixed = bit\n                    else:\n                        if bit != last_fixed:\n                            fixed_groups += 1\n                            last_fixed = bit\n                        # else: same as last, do nothing\n                else:\n                    # This pair is mixed. We are going to fix it (with one operation) but we don't know what we set it to? And for the fixed_groups, we skip it? \n                    # Because we can set it arbitrarily, so we don't count it as a fixed pair? \n                    # But note: we are building the fixed_groups by only looking at the pairs that are originally fixed? \n                    # Actually, we are going to set the mixed ones arbitrarily, but we are free to choose. So we don't consider them as fixed? They are variable and we skip them in the fixed_groups traversal.\n\n                    # So we do nothing for this pair? \n                    pass\n\n            Then if fixed_groups == 0:\n                fixed_groups = 1   # because if there are no fixed pairs, we set all variable pairs to the same bit -> one group.\n\n          But wait: what if we have a mixed pair at the beginning? Then last_fixed remains None, and we skip. Then we set fixed_groups=0? Then we set it to 1.\n\n          However, what if we have:\n\n            Example: \"01\" (one pair, mixed) -> then we skip, so fixed_groups=0 -> then set to 1. Correct: we set it to 0 or 1 -> one group.\n\n          Example: \"00\" (one pair, fixed) -> fixed_groups=1.\n\n          Example: \"00\", \"01\", \"11\": \n            pair0: \"00\" -> fixed, last_fixed='0', fixed_groups=1.\n            pair1: \"01\" -> skip.\n            pair2: \"11\" -> fixed, and '1' != '0' -> fixed_groups=2.\n\n          Then minimal groups = 2.\n\n          But note: we can set the mixed pair to either 0 or 1. \n            If we set it to 0: then we have \"00\", \"00\", \"11\" -> groups: [00,00] and [11] -> 2 groups.\n            If we set it to 1: then we have \"00\", \"11\", \"11\" -> groups: [00], [11,11] -> 2 groups.\n\n          So 2 groups is minimal.\n\n          However, what if we have:\n\n            \"00\", \"01\", \"00\": \n                fixed_groups: \n                  pair0: fixed '0' -> groups=1, last_fixed='0'\n                  pair1: skip\n                  pair2: fixed '0' -> same as last_fixed -> groups remains 1.\n\n          Then minimal groups = 1? \n\n          How? We set the mixed pair to 0: then we have \"00\", \"00\", \"00\" -> one group.\n\n          So that matches.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm for the second integer (minimal groups) is:\n\n            fixed_groups = 0\n            last_fixed = None   # will store the last fixed bit we encountered (from a fixed pair)\n\n            for i in range(n//2):\n                idx = 2*i\n                if s[idx] == s[idx+1]:\n                    b = s[idx]\n                    if last_fixed is None:\n                        fixed_groups = 1\n                        last_fixed = b\n                    else:\n                        if last_fixed != b:\n                            fixed_groups += 1\n                            last_fixed = b\n            if fixed_groups == 0:\n                fixed_groups = 1\n\n          Then we output: (operations, fixed_groups)\n\n          But wait: what if we have a test case that has no fixed pairs? Then we set fixed_groups=1. And operations = number of mixed pairs.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we can do this.\n\n          But note: the problem says the sum of n over test cases <= 200,000, so we are safe.\n\n          However, let's test with the sample:\n\n            Example 1: s = \"1110011000\" -> but note: the sample says it's not good initially.\n\n            Actually, the first sample test case: \n                Input: \n                  4\n                  2\n                  00\n                  2\n                  11\n                  4\n                  0101\n                  4\n                  1010\n\n                Output: \n                  0 1\n                  0 1\n                  2 1\n                  2 1\n\n            How about the third test case: \"0101\" -> n=4, so two pairs.\n\n                Pair0: \"01\" -> mixed -> operation: 1\n                Pair1: \"01\" -> mixed -> operation: 1\n\n                So operations = 2.\n\n                Now fixed_groups: \n                  pair0: mixed -> skip\n                  pair1: mixed -> skip -> fixed_groups=0 -> then set to 1.\n\n                So output: 2 1.\n\n            The fourth test case: \"1010\" -> same: two mixed pairs -> operations=2, fixed_groups=0 -> then 1.\n\n            But the sample output for the third and fourth is \"2 1\".\n\n            However, the sample also says:\n\n                In the first test case: \n                  Input: \n                    1\n                    10\n                    0100001101\n\n                  Output: 3 2\n\n            How does our algorithm work for the first test case?\n\n                The first test case: \n                  t=1\n                  n=10\n                  s = \"0100001101\"\n\n                We break into pairs:\n\n                  pair0: \"01\" -> mixed -> operation count +=1 -> now 1\n                  pair1: \"00\" -> fixed (0) -> fixed_groups: last_fixed=None -> set to 0, fixed_groups=1\n                  pair2: \"00\" -> fixed (0) -> same as last_fixed -> no change\n                  pair3: \"11\" -> fixed (1) -> different from last_fixed (0) -> fixed_groups=2, last_fixed=1\n                  pair4: \"01\" -> mixed -> operation count +=1 -> now 2? \n\n                But wait: the sample says 3 operations.\n\n                Actually, the sample input: \n                  \"0100001101\" -> \n                    positions: \n                      0: '0'\n                      1: '1' -> pair0: \"01\" -> mixed -> 1 operation\n                      2: '0'\n                      3: '0' -> pair1: \"00\" -> fixed -> record fixed bit 0\n                      4: '0'\n                      5: '0' -> pair2: \"00\" -> fixed -> same as last_fixed -> skip\n                      6: '1'\n                      7: '1' -> pair3: \"11\" -> fixed -> different -> fixed_groups=2, last_fixed=1\n                      8: '0'\n                      9: '1' -> pair4: \"01\" -> mixed -> 1 operation -> total operations=3.\n\n                Then fixed_groups: we have two fixed groups? Then we output 3 and 2.\n\n                But note: we set the mixed pairs arbitrarily. How does that affect the groups? \n\n                We have:\n                  pair0: we can set to either \"00\" or \"11\". \n                  pair4: we can set to either \"00\" or \"11\".\n\n                We want to minimize the groups. The fixed groups we have: \n                  [pair1, pair2] (both 0) -> one group, then [pair3] (1) -> second group.\n\n                Now, we have:\n                  pair0: at the beginning, we can set it to 0: then we have [00] at the beginning? Then the entire string:\n\n                    pair0: 00 -> then pair1:00, pair2:00 -> so we can merge the first three pairs? Then we have one group for the zeros? Then the 11 (pair3) is a group, and then the last pair (pair4) we set to 1? Then we have:\n\n                    [00,00,00] -> group1 (0's)\n                    [11] -> group2\n                    [11] -> group3? \n\n                  But wait: the last pair is set to 11? Then after pair3 (which is 11) and pair4 (11) are consecutive same? Then they merge? So:\n\n                    [00,00,00] -> group1\n                    [11,11] -> group2\n\n                  So total groups=2.\n\n                Alternatively, set pair0 to 1: \n                  Then: \n                    pair0: 11 -> then pair1:00 -> break -> groups: [11] and then [00,00] -> then [11] -> then the last pair: we set to 00? Then we have [00] at the end? Then:\n\n                    [11] -> group1\n                    [00,00] -> group2\n                    [11] -> group3\n                    [00] -> group4? \n\n                  But wait, we set the last pair to 00? Then after the [11] (pair3) we have 00 (pair4) -> break. So groups: [11], [00,00], [11], [00] -> 4 groups.\n\n                Or set the last pair to 11: \n                  Then: \n                    [11] (pair0) -> group1\n                    [00,00] (pair1,2) -> group2\n                    [11,11] (pair3,4) -> group3\n\n                  So 3 groups.\n\n                Therefore, we can achieve 2 groups by setting pair0 to 0 and pair4 to 1? But wait: if we set pair4 to 1, then we get 11? Then after the group of 11 (pair3) we have 11 (pair4) -> so they merge? Then we have:\n\n                  [00,00,00] (pair0 set to 00, then pair1,2) -> group1\n                  [11,11] (pair3 and pair4 set to 11) -> group2\n\n                So 2 groups.\n\n                How about setting pair0 to 0 and pair4 to 0? Then we have:\n\n                  [00] (pair0) -> then [00,00] (pair1,2) -> merge: [00,00,00] -> then [11] (pair3) -> then [00] (pair4) -> \n                  groups: [00,00,00] -> group1, [11] -> group2, [00] -> group3 -> 3 groups.\n\n                So the minimal groups we can achieve is 2.\n\n                Therefore, our algorithm for the groups: we computed fixed_groups=2 (from the fixed pairs: the two groups: the zeros and the ones) and then we set the variable runs arbitrarily? But note: we did not account for the possibility of merging the variable runs with the fixed groups? \n\n                However, we did: we set the variable runs arbitrarily to avoid creating extra breaks? But our fixed_groups count was 2, and we output 2. And that matches.\n\n                But wait: what if we have a variable run at the beginning? We set it to the next fixed group? Then we merge? Then the fixed_groups count remains 2? \n\n                Actually, the fixed_groups count we computed is 2, and we output 2. But we can achieve 2 groups? Then that is minimal.\n\n                Therefore, the algorithm for the groups is: we count the fixed groups (by ignoring the variable pairs) and then set the groups = max(1, fixed_groups). \n\n          However, the sample test case: \n            \"00\" -> fixed_groups=1 -> output 1 -> correct.\n            \"11\" -> fixed_groups=1 -> output 1 -> correct.\n            \"0101\" -> fixed_groups=0 -> output 1 -> correct.\n\n          But wait: what if we have:\n\n            s = \"0001\" -> \n                pairs: \n                  pair0: \"00\" -> fixed (0) -> fixed_groups=1, last_fixed='0'\n                  pair1: \"01\" -> mixed -> skip.\n\n            Then fixed_groups=1 -> output groups=1.\n\n            How can we achieve 1 group? \n                We set the mixed pair to 0: then we have \"00\" and \"00\" -> one group? \n                But wait: the entire string becomes \"0000\", which is one segment? Yes.\n\n            So that matches.\n\n          Therefore, the code for each test case:\n\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            s = input().strip()\n\n            operations = 0\n            fixed_groups = 0\n            last_fixed = None\n\n            # iterate over the pairs\n            for i in range(n//2):\n                a = s[2*i]\n                b = s[2*i+1]\n                if a == b:\n                    # This is a fixed pair (originally same)\n                    if last_fixed is None:\n                        fixed_groups = 1\n                        last_fixed = a\n                    else:\n                        if a != last_fixed:\n                            fixed_groups += 1\n                            last_fixed = a\n                else:\n                    operations += 1\n\n            if fixed_groups == 0:\n                fixed_groups = 1\n\n            print(operations, fixed_groups)\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we are safe.\n\n          However, let's test with the provided examples.\n\n          Example 1: \n            Input: \n              4\n              2\n              00\n              2\n              11\n              4\n              0101\n              4\n              1010\n\n            Output for the first: \n              n=2, s=\"00\": \n                operations: 0 (no mixed pairs)\n                fixed_groups: \n                  i=0: a='0', b='0' -> fixed -> last_fixed=None -> fixed_groups=1, last_fixed='0'\n                then fixed_groups=1 -> output \"0 1\"\n\n            Second: \"11\" -> same: \"0 1\"\n\n            Third: \"0101\": \n                n=4, s=\"0101\"\n                i=0: a='0', b='1' -> mixed -> operations=1\n                i=1: a='0', b='1' -> mixed -> operations=2\n                fixed_groups: remains 0 -> then set to 1 -> output \"2 1\"\n\n            Fourth: \"1010\": same as above -> \"2 1\"\n\n          Example 2: \n            Input: \n              1\n              10\n              0100001101\n\n            Output: operations=3, fixed_groups=2 -> \"3 2\"\n\n          Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases does not exceed 200,000. But note: the input t can be up to 10,000, but the sum of n is 200,000. So we are safe.\n\n          But note: the sample input says the first line is t, then for each test case: first n, then a string of length n.\n\n          The provided code template:\n\n            inp = [*open(0)]\n            for s in inp[2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                res = 0\n                mseg = 1\n                prebit = None\n                for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                    if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                        res += 1\n                    else:\n                        if prebit is None:\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                print(res, mseg)\n\n          We see that the template already has:\n\n            res = 0   # for operations\n            mseg = 1   # for the minimal segments? but we are going to compute fixed_groups and then set mseg = fixed_groups (if fixed_groups>=1) or 1 if fixed_groups==0.\n\n          However, the template has a variable `prebit` and in the else branch (when the pair is fixed) we have:\n\n            if prebit is None: set prebit to the current bit\n            else: ... \n\n          And then we set mseg? \n\n          But note: the template sets mseg initially to 1. Then in the else branch (for fixed pairs) we do:\n\n            if prebit is not None and the current bit is different from prebit, then we increment mseg? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            We don't need to store the entire fixed_groups, we can update mseg as we go? \n\n          How? \n\n            We can do:\n\n              mseg = 0   # we are going to count the fixed groups? but note: we skip the mixed ones.\n\n          But wait: the template sets mseg=1 initially. Then in the fixed pair:\n\n            if prebit is None: set prebit to the current bit and then set mseg=1? Actually, the template already set mseg=1.\n\n          Then in the else branch (for fixed pairs) we have:\n\n            if prebit is not None and the current bit is different from prebit, then we do mseg += 1 and update prebit.\n\n          But note: what if we have consecutive same fixed pairs? Then we don't update mseg? \n\n          However, what if we have a fixed pair, then a mixed pair, then a fixed pair? Then we skip the mixed pair? Then the prebit remains the last fixed bit? Then when we see the next fixed pair, we compare with the last fixed bit (which was set from the previous fixed pair) and if it's different, we update.\n\n          But the template does not account for skipping the mixed pairs? Because the mixed pairs are in the if branch (where we do res+=1) and the fixed pairs are in the else branch.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            mseg = 0   # we are going to count the fixed groups by traversing the fixed pairs? But note: we have to account for the possibility of no fixed pairs.\n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let's reset: \n              operations = 0\n              groups = 0   # for fixed groups\n              last = None\n\n            Then for each pair i:\n                if the pair is fixed (a==b):\n                    if last is None:\n                        groups = 1\n                        last = a\n                    else:\n                        if a != last:\n                            groups += 1\n                            last = a\n                else:\n                    operations += 1\n\n            Then if groups==0: groups=1\n\n          But the template has:\n\n            res = 0\n            mseg = 1\n            prebit = None\n\n            for i in range(len(s)//2):\n                if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                    res += 1\n                else:\n                    if prebit is None:\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n                    else:\n                        # Here, we have a fixed pair and prebit is not None.\n                        if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                            mseg += 1\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n                        # else: same as prebit, do nothing.\n\n            Then after the loop, we have mseg? But what if there are no fixed pairs? Then the else branch is never executed, so mseg remains 1? \n\n            But if there are no fixed pairs, we want mseg=1? Then that matches.\n\n            However, what if we have one fixed pair? Then we set prebit to that bit and mseg remains 1? Correct.\n\n            What if we have two fixed pairs that are the same? Then the first fixed pair sets prebit. The second fixed pair: we enter the else branch, and if the bit is the same as prebit, we do nothing -> mseg remains 1? Correct.\n\n            What if we have two fixed pairs that are different? Then the first sets prebit and mseg=1. The second: we enter else, and since the bit is different, we do mseg +=1 -> mseg=2, and update prebit. Correct.\n\n            But what if we have a fixed pair, then a mixed pair, then a fixed pair that is the same as the first? \n                First fixed pair: set prebit = bit, mseg=1.\n                Mixed pair: skip (only res++).\n                Then fixed pair: same as prebit? Then we do nothing -> mseg remains 1? \n                But we have two fixed pairs of the same bit? Then we want one group? Correct.\n\n            What if we have a fixed pair, then a mixed pair, then a fixed pair that is different? \n                Then the second fixed pair: we compare with prebit (which is the first fixed pair) and they are different -> mseg becomes 2.\n\n            Therefore, the template is almost correct? But note: the template sets mseg=1 initially. Then if we have no fixed pairs, we output mseg=1. Correct.\n\n            However, what if we have two fixed pairs at the beginning that are the same? Then we set prebit at the first, then the second: we do nothing -> mseg=1. Correct.\n\n            But what if we have two fixed pairs that are the same, but then a third fixed pair that is different? \n                First: set prebit and mseg=1.\n                Second: same -> do nothing -> mseg=1, prebit unchanged.\n                Third: different -> mseg becomes 2, and prebit updated.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            Therefore, we can use the template and complete the else branch.\n\n          So the missing code in the else branch is:\n\n            if prebit is not None and s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But note: we don't update prebit when the bit is the same? Then we leave prebit as the last fixed bit we encountered? \n\n          However, we only update prebit when we have a fixed pair and we are either initializing it or when we have a change? \n\n          Actually, we want to update prebit only when we have a fixed pair? And we do:\n\n            In the else branch (fixed pair) we have:\n\n                if prebit is None: \n                    prebit = s[2*i]   # set the current bit\n                else:\n                    if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                        mseg += 1\n                        prebit = s[2*i]   # update to the new bit\n\n          But what if we have a fixed pair that is the same as the last? Then we don't update prebit? That's fine because we don't need to.\n\n          However, consider: \n            fixed pair1: bit0 -> prebit=0, mseg=1 (from the if branch: prebit was None, so we set prebit but don't change mseg? Actually, the template sets mseg=1 initially, and then we don't change it in the if branch? \n\n          How the template works:\n\n            Initially: mseg=1, prebit=None.\n\n            For the first fixed pair:\n                we enter else: \n                    if prebit is None -> set prebit = s[2*i] -> but we don't change mseg? \n                Then mseg remains 1.\n\n            Then for the next fixed pair that is the same: \n                else branch: prebit is not None -> then if s[2*i] != prebit? -> no -> so we do nothing.\n\n            Then for the next fixed pair that is different:\n                else branch: s[2*i] != prebit -> then mseg +=1 and set prebit to the new bit.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But note: what if the first pair is mixed? Then we do:\n\n            res +=1, and skip the else branch.\n\n            Then the next pair is fixed: \n                then we enter else: \n                    prebit is None -> so we set prebit = s[2*i] -> and we don't change mseg? \n                Then mseg remains 1.\n\n          Then if we have another fixed pair that is the same: do nothing.\n\n          Then if we have a fixed pair that is different: then we do mseg +=1.\n\n          So the minimal groups is mseg.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the else branch is:\n\n            if prebit is not None:\n                if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                    mseg += 1\n                    prebit = s[2*i]\n            else:\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But note: the template already set prebit to s[2*i] in the if prebit is None branch? \n\n          Actually, the template has:\n\n            if prebit is None:\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we complete the else branch (the inner else) with:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But note: we don't have an else for the inner if? We don't need to do anything if they are the same.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for the else branch (the inner else) is:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          However, what if we have a fixed pair that is the same as the last? Then we do nothing? Correct.\n\n          But note: we don't update prebit? Then prebit remains the last fixed bit? That's correct.\n\n          However, we update prebit only when we see a fixed pair that is different? Then if we have a long run of the same fixed pairs, we don't update prebit? But that's fine because we don't need to.\n\n          But what if we have a fixed pair that is the same as the last, but then a mixed pair, then a fixed pair that is the same? Then we don't update prebit? Then the last fixed bit is still the same? Then when we see the next fixed pair that is the same, we don't update? Correct.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the else branch (the inner else) is:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          However, note: we must update prebit to the current bit when we have a change? Because the next fixed pair should compare with the current one? \n\n          Example: \n            fixed0, then fixed1: \n                first fixed0: prebit=0, mseg=1 (from the initial setting: we set prebit in the if None branch, but mseg was set to 1 initially? Actually, the initial mseg=1 is for the first group? Then when we see the fixed1: we do mseg+=1 -> mseg=2, and set prebit=1.\n\n          Then if we have a fixed0 again: \n                then we compare: current bit (0) != prebit (1) -> mseg becomes 3, and set prebit=0.\n\n          This is correct: the groups are: [0], [1], [0] -> 3 groups.\n\n          But note: we can set the variable runs arbitrarily to merge? But wait, these are fixed pairs. We cannot change them. So we have to break.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            for s in inp[2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                res = 0\n                mseg = 1\n                prebit = None\n                for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                    if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                        res += 1\n                    else:\n                        if prebit is None:\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n                        else:\n                            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                                mseg += 1\n                                prebit = s[2*i]\n                print(res, mseg)\n\n          However, what if there are no fixed pairs? Then the else branch is never executed, so prebit remains None, and mseg remains 1? Then we output (res, 1). Correct.\n\n          But what if the entire string is fixed pairs? Then we do:\n\n            mseg starts at 1.\n            The first pair: set prebit to the bit (say '0').\n            Then the next pair: if it is '0', we do nothing? Then mseg remains 1? \n            Then the next pair: if it is '1', then we do mseg+=1 -> 2, and set prebit='1'.\n\n          Then we output (0, 2) for a string of \"000111\"? \n\n          But the string \"000111\" has two groups: [00,00] (which is 4 zeros? Actually, the pairs: \n            pair0: \"00\" -> 0\n            pair1: \"01\" -> wait, no: the string is \"000111\", so the pairs are:\n                pair0: \"00\" -> 0\n                pair1: \"01\" -> but wait, the string is 6 characters: \n                    positions: 0,1: \"00\"\n                    positions: 2,3: \"01\" -> that's not fixed? \n\n          Actually, the string \"000111\" is 6 characters: \n            s[0:2] = \"00\" -> fixed\n            s[2:4] = \"01\" -> mixed? \n            s[4:6] = \"11\" -> fixed\n\n          So we have two fixed pairs and one mixed pair? \n\n          How about \"00001111\": \n            pairs: \n              \"00\", \"00\", \"11\", \"11\"\n            fixed pairs: all are fixed? \n            Then:\n              first pair: \"00\" -> prebit='0', mseg=1 (initial)\n              second pair: \"00\" -> same as prebit -> do nothing -> mseg=1\n              third pair: \"11\" -> different -> mseg=2, prebit='1'\n              fourth pair: \"11\" -> same -> do nothing.\n\n            Then output: operations=0, mseg=2.\n\n          How many groups? \n            The entire string: \"00001111\" -> we break at the change from 0 to 1? \n            So groups: [0000] and [1111] -> 2 groups. Correct.\n\n          Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we are safe.\n\n          We output the code for the else branch.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases does not exceed 200,000, but note that the for loop runs for n//2 per test case, and the sum of n is 200,000, so the total pairs is 100,000, which is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for the else branch is:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But note: we must not forget to update prebit when we have a change? The code above does update.\n\n          So the complete program2.py is:\n\n            inp = [*open(0)]\n\n            for s in inp[2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                res = 0\n                mseg = 1\n                prebit = None\n                for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                    if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                        res += 1\n                    else:\n                        if prebit is None:\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n                        else:\n                            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                                mseg += 1\n                                prebit = s[2*i]\n                print(res, mseg)\n\n          However, note: the input has t test cases. The template uses:\n\n            inp = [*open(0)]\n\n          Then it iterates over every second line starting from index 2? \n\n          The input structure:\n\n            Line0: t\n            Line1: n0\n            Line2: s0\n            Line3: n1\n            Line4: s1\n            ...\n\n          So the strings are at indices 2, 4, 6, ... -> so [2::2] is correct.\n\n          But note: the first line after the first is at index1? \n\n          Actually, the list `inp`:\n\n            index0: the first line (t)\n            index1: the n for the first test case\n            index2: the string for the first test case\n            index3: the n for the second test case\n            index4: the string for the second test case\n\n          So we want to take every second line starting from index2? \n\n          Then the loop: for s in inp[2::2] -> we get the strings for the test cases.\n\n          Therefore, the code is complete.\n\n          We output the missing code for the else branch: \n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The template has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So we replace the TODO with:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          But we are to output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n          And the output format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n          For program1.py, we are given:\n\n            for i in range(int(input())):\n                data = [[0 for l in range(11)] for k in range(11)]\n\n                for j in range(int(input())):\n                    first, second = input()\n                    data[ord(first)-ord('a')][ord(second)-ord('a')] += 1\n\n                answer = 0\n                for j in range(11):\n                    for k in range(11):\n                        for l in range(11):\n                            if j != l:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n\n                            if k != l:\n                                answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n                print(answer//2)\n\n          We have to complete the TODO in program1.py.\n\n          But note: the problem for program1.py is different.\n\n          Program1.py: \n            Description: Given n strings, each of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k', output the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the i-th string and the j-th string differ in exactly one position.\n\n          We are storing the strings in a 11x11 matrix (since 'a' to 'k' is 11 letters: 'a' is 0, 'k' is 10).\n\n          Then we have:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n          Then we print answer//2.\n\n          Why //2? Because we are counting pairs (i,j) and (j,i) as the same? But note: the pairs are unordered? Actually, the problem says i<j.\n\n          How do we count?\n\n            We are iterating over j (first character) and k (second character) and l (another second character?).\n\n          The condition: two strings (say s_i and s_j) differ in exactly one position.\n\n          There are two cases:\n\n            Case 1: the first character is the same, and the second character is different.\n            Case 2: the first character is different, and the second character is the same.\n\n          We are currently counting:\n\n            For a fixed j (first character) and k (second character) and l (another second character) with k != l, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l] -> this counts the pairs of strings that have the same first character j and second characters k and l (so they differ in the second character). This counts for case 1.\n\n          But we are missing case 2: the first character different and the second character same.\n\n          The TODO is in the if j != l block. What should we do?\n\n          We should count: for a fixed k (second character) and two different first characters j and l, we add data[j][k] * data[l][k]? \n\n          Then the total answer = (count for case1) + (count for case2)\n\n          But note: the current loop has:\n\n            for j in 0..10:\n                for k in 0..10:\n                    for l in 0..10:\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: we want to count case2? \n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n          The current if k != l counts case1: same j (first char) and different k and l (second char). \n\n          We need to count case2: same k (second char) and different j and l (first char). \n\n          So in the if j != l block, we can do:\n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n          But note: the inner loop variable is l, and we are iterating l from 0 to 10. \n\n          However, we are also using l in the condition for case1? \n\n          Actually, the two cases are independent. We can do:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # Count case2: same second char k, different first char j and l.\n                            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n                        if k != l:\n                            # Count case1: same first char j, different second char k and l.\n                            answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n          But note: this counts each pair twice? \n\n          Why? \n\n            Consider two strings: \n              string1: (j, k)\n              string2: (j, l)   [with k != l] -> this is counted in case1: we add 1 for (j,k) and (j,l) -> but note: we are iterating over k and l. For fixed j, k, and l, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l]. This counts the pair (string1, string2) and (string2, string1)? \n\n          Actually, no: for a fixed j, k, and l (with k != l), we are adding the product data[j][k] * data[j][l]. This counts every pair of strings that have first char j and second char k and l: for each string with (j,k) and each string with (j,l), we count one pair. And since k != l, these are distinct. And the pair (i, j) is counted once: the string with (j,k) and the string with (j,l) form a pair that differs in the second character.\n\n          Similarly, for case2: for fixed j, k, and l (with j != l), we add data[j][k] * data[l][k]. This counts every pair of strings: one with (j,k) and one with (l,k) (with j != l) -> they differ in the first character.\n\n          But note: the entire triple loop counts every unordered pair of strings that differ in exactly one position? \n\n          However, we are iterating over all j, k, l. \n\n          But note: the same pair of strings might be counted multiple times? \n\n          Actually, no: \n\n            Consider two strings: \n                s1: (a, b)\n                s2: (a, c)   [differ in second char]\n\n            This pair is counted in the case1: when j = a, k = b, l = c: we add 1 (if we have one string of (a,b) and one of (a,c)) -> but note: we are iterating l from a to k, so when l=c, we add data[a][b] * data[a][c]. \n\n            Also, when j=a, k=c, l=b: we also add data[a][c] * data[a][b]? \n\n            So we are counting the same pair twice? \n\n          Therefore, we are double-counting? \n\n          The problem says: count the number of pairs (i, j) with i<j. But our counting counts each pair twice? \n\n          Then we do answer//2 at the end? \n\n          But note: the current code already has:\n\n            print(answer//2)\n\n          So we are dividing by 2 at the end. \n\n          Why? \n\n          Because in case1: for a fixed j (first char) and two different second chars k and l, we count the pair (string with (j,k) and string with (j,l)) twice: once when we fix k and l, and once when we fix l and k? \n\n          Actually, the inner loop for l runs from 0 to 10. For a fixed j and k, we iterate l from 0 to 10. When l=k, we skip (because k != l condition fails). When l != k, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l]. \n\n          Then for a fixed j, the total for case1 is:\n\n            for k: for l>k: we count data[j][k] * data[j][l] and for l<k: we also count? \n\n          Actually, we are iterating l from 0 to 10, so we count every unordered pair (k, l) with k != l? But note: we are not skipping l<k. \n\n          Therefore, for a fixed j, the total for case1 is:\n\n            (sum_{k} data[j][k])^2 - sum_{k} data[j][k]^2   [but we are not subtracting the squares?]\n\n          Actually, we are doing:\n\n            for k: \n                for l: \n                    if k != l: \n                        add data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n          This is equal to: \n            (sum_{k} data[j][k])^2 - sum_{k} data[j][k]^2\n\n          But note: we are also doing the same for case2? \n\n          And then we divide by 2 at the end? \n\n          However, the problem: we are counting each pair of strings that differ in exactly one position exactly twice? \n\n          Why twice? \n\n            Consider two strings: \n                s1: (a, b)\n                s2: (a, c)\n\n            This pair is counted in case1: \n                when j=a, k=b, l=c: we add 1 (if we have one occurrence of (a,b) and one of (a,c)) -> count=1\n                when j=a, k=c, l=b: we add 1 -> count=2\n\n            So we count it twice.\n\n          Similarly, for two strings that differ in the first character:\n\n                s1: (a, b)\n                s2: (c, b)\n\n            In case2: \n                when k=b, j=a, l=c: we add 1\n                when k=b, j=c, l=a: we add 1 -> total 2.\n\n          Therefore, we are counting every pair twice? Then we divide by 2 at the end? \n\n          But note: the problem says i<j, so we should count each pair once. \n\n          Therefore, the //2 at the end is correct.\n\n          So the TODO for program1.py is:\n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n          But note: the condition is if j != l. \n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n          However, we must be cautious: the variable l is the same as the one in the outer loop? \n\n          The code:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n          This is the complete inner loop.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n            program2: \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n                mseg += 1\\n                prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          But note: the program2 code must be indented properly? \n\n          The template for program2 has:\n\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But note: the existing code in the else branch has:\n\n            if prebit is None:\n                ... \n            else:\n                [we are here]\n\n          So the code we are adding is inside the inner else.\n\n          Therefore, the entire else branch in program2 becomes:\n\n            else:\n                if prebit is None:\n                    prebit = s[2*i]\n                else:\n                    if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                        mseg += 1\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", so for program2 we output the block that goes in the inner else.\n\n          So we output:\n\n            program1: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n            program2: \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n                mseg += 1\\n                prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output in a json.\n\n          We output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\", \"program2\": \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\\\n                mseg += 1\\\\n                prebit = s[2*i]\"}\n\n          But note: the newlines and spaces? We must preserve the indentation.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write the program2 part as a string with the exact indentation? \n\n          The template for program2 has:\n\n            else:\n                if prebit is None:\n                    prebit = s[2*i]\n                else:\n                    [MISSING]\n\n          The [MISSING] part should be:\n\n                    if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                        mseg += 1\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But note: the inner else is already indented. The missing block is:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But in the context, the inner else is at the same indentation as the if prebit is None. So the missing block should be at the same indentation level as the if prebit is None.\n\n          Actually, the template:\n\n                else:\n                    if prebit is None:\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n                    else:\n                        # TODO\n\n          We are to replace the TODO with:\n\n                        if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                            mseg += 1\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", so we output the two lines:\n\n                        if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                            mseg += 1\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          However, to be safe, we output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\n          Therefore, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But we must note the indentation: the TODO is inside the inner else, which is indented by 12 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the template:\n\n            for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                    res += 1\n                else:\n                    if prebit is None:\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n                    else:\n                        # TODO\n\n          The else is at 8 spaces, the if prebit is None is at 12, and the else of that is at 12, and the TODO is at 16? \n\n          We are to replace the TODO with:\n\n                        if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                            mseg += 1\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          The indentation: the if should be at 16, and the two statements inside at 20.\n\n          But the problem does not specify the exact indentation? However, the problem says the code must run.\n\n          We output the code as:\n\n            \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n                mseg += 1\\n                prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          The template uses 8 spaces for the outer for and if, and 12 for the inner if-else, and 16 for the inner if-else body? \n\n          We'll use 16 and 20? \n\n          But the template in the problem for program2 has:\n\n            else:\n                if prebit is None:\n                    prebit = s[2*i]\n                else:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with:\n\n                    if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                        mseg += 1\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But note: the existing code in the else branch (the if prebit is None and the else) is indented by 8? Actually, the entire else branch is at 8, and the inner if-else is at 12, and the bodies at 16.\n\n          So the missing block (the inner else body) should be at 16? \n\n          We'll write:\n\n            \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n        mseg += 1\\n        prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          But wait, the existing code in the if prebit is None branch is:\n\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          which is at 16? \n\n          So the missing block should be:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                mseg += 1\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          and we put it at the same indentation as the body of the if prebit is None.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            program2: \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n                mseg += 1\\n                prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          But to be safe, we use 16 spaces for the if and 20 for the inner? Actually, the template in the problem uses 4-space indentation? \n\n          Since the problem does not specify, we output the code as a string that would replace the TODO, and we assume the same indentation as the existing branch.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output without worrying about the exact number of spaces? The problem says the code must run. We'll use 4 spaces per level.\n\n          The structure:\n\n            else:\n                if prebit is None:\n                    prebit = s[2*i]\n                else:\n                    if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                        mseg += 1\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          The missing block is the entire else branch of the inner if? But the problem says the TODO is in the else branch. \n\n          Actually, the TODO is at the position of the inner else branch. We are to replace the TODO with the if block.\n\n          Therefore, we output the two lines (with proper indentation relative to the else: which is one level deeper than the else).\n\n          We'll output:\n\n            program2: \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n    mseg += 1\\n    prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          But the existing code in the if prebit is None branch is indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n          The template:\n\n                else:\n                    if prebit is None:\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n                    else:\n                        [TODO]\n\n          The [TODO] is at the same level as the body of the if prebit is None? \n\n          So the body of the else should be indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n          Therefore, the missing block should be:\n\n                    if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                        mseg += 1\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          But the entire else branch (the outer else) is already at 4 spaces? Then the inner if-else is at 8, and the bodies at 12.\n\n          We'll output the block as:\n\n            \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n        mseg += 1\\n        prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          (using 8 spaces for the body: 4 for the inner if and 4 more for the inner body)\n\n          However, the problem does not specify, and the sample uses 4 spaces? \n\n          We'll output the string exactly as it would appear in the program.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write without newlines? But the problem says to output the code.\n\n          We'll use:\n\n            program1: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n            program2: \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n        mseg += 1\\n        prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases for program2 is at most 200,000, and the inner loop runs n/2 per test case, and the sum of n is 200,000, so the total pairs is 100,000, which is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n              \"program2\": \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\\\n        mseg += 1\\\\n        prebit = s[2*i]\"\n            }\n\n          But wait: the program2 template in the problem has:\n\n                else:\n                    if prebit is None:\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                        if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                            mseg += 1\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          We use 8 spaces for the if and 12 for the inner? Actually, the existing body of the if prebit is None is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for). \n\n          We'll use 8 and 12? \n\n          But the problem does not specify. We'll output with 8 and 12 to match the existing if branch.\n\n          Alternatively, we can count the spaces in the template:\n\n            The template for program2 as given:\n\n            inp = [*open(0)]\n\n            for s in inp[2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                res = 0\n                mseg = 1\n                prebit = None\n                for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                    if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                        res += 1\n                    else:\n                        if prebit is None:\n                            prebit = s[2*i]\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                print(res, mseg)\n\n          The else branch (the outer else) is at 8 spaces. The if prebit is None is at 12, and the else of that is at 12, and the TODO is at 16? \n\n          We replace the TODO with:\n\n                            if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                                mseg += 1\n                                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n          So 16 spaces for the if and 20 for the inner.\n\n          We output:\n\n            program2: \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\\\n                                mseg += 1\\\\n                                prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          But that is too long? \n\n          Alternatively, we output the code without the exact spaces? The problem says the code must run. We can assume that the code is indented with 4 spaces per level.\n\n          We'll use:\n\n            program2: \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\\\n                mseg += 1\\\\n                prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          with 16 spaces for the if and 16 for the inner? \n\n          Actually, the existing body of the if prebit is None is at 16 spaces? \n\n          The template:\n\n                        prebit = s[2*i]   # this is at 16 spaces\n\n          So the body of the inner else should be at 16 spaces? \n\n          We output:\n\n            if s[2*i] != prebit:   # at 16 spaces\n                mseg += 1           # at 20 spaces\n                prebit = s[2*i]     # at 20 spaces\n\n          So the string:\n\n            \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\n                mseg += 1\\n                prebit = s[2*i]\"\n\n          (with 16 spaces at the beginning of the if, and 20 for the inner? But the inner is 4 more, so 20? But the template uses 4 spaces per indent: 4*4=16 for the outer else body, then 4*5=20 for the inner body)\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n              \"program2\": \"if s[2*i] != prebit:\\\\n                mseg += 1\\\\n                prebit = s[2*i]\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the program2 template in the problem has the else branch at 8 spaces, and the inner if-else at 12, and the bodies at 16. The TODO is at 16. We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            if ... at 16, and the two statements at 20.\n\n          We use 4 more spaces for the inner body? \n\n          The string \"                \" is 16 spaces? \n\n          Actually, 4*4=16.\n\n          So we output the above.\n\n          Let's hope.\n\n          We output the json."
