Actually, the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the entire input is 10^5 strings. But the distinct groups (by first char) is at most 11. So we can do. But note: the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k', so 11 letters. So the distinct first characters are at most 11, and distinct second characters are at most 11. So we can even do:\n\n  We don't need to use defaultdict of Counter. We can use:\n\n      first_group = {}\n      for s, count in num.items():\n          c = s[0]\n          if c not in first_group:\n              first_group[c] = {} d = s[1]\n          first_group[c][d] = first_group[c].get(d,0) + count But the above is the same as defaultdict.",

Therefore, b_i = a_i+k >=0 for all i.\n\n      So k >= -min(a_i) -> to make all b_i>=0. In the example [1,2,1]: min(a_i)=1, so k>=-1. But if k=-1, then b = [0,1,0]. Then total operations = 2+k = 2-1=1. Is that possible? We then have:\n            b_1=0, b_2=1, b_3=0. We need: \n               z_1+w_1=0 -> z_1=0, w_1=0. z_2+w_2=1. z_3+w_3=0 -> z_3=0, w_3=0. Then from z_1=0 and z_1>=z_2>=z_3, we have z_2=0, z_3=0. Then w_2=1. But w_1=0, w_2=1, w_3=0 -> not non-decreasing because w_3=0<w_2=1? -> not possible. So the constraint is not only nonnegativity of b_i, but also the condition that the sequence b_i must be such that the differences in the recurrence are nonnegative? Specifically, from the recurrence: \n          for i=2 to n: \n             -x_{i-1} + y_i = b_i - b_{i-1}\n          and x_{i-1}>=0, y_i>=0. So we must have: \n          b_i - b_{i-1} = y_i - x_{i-1} \n          and this can be any real number, but we can choose y_i and x_{i-1} as long as they are nonnegative and the equation holds.",

But note: we also have the condition that the entire sequence b_i must be such that the computed w_1 = M (the minimum) is nonnegative, which it is. But we can choose k to minimize T = b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i-b_{i-1}) = a_1+k + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, (a_i+k) - (a_{i-1}+k))\n          = a_1+k + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1])\n\n      = k + [ a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1}) ]\n\n      = k + C, where C = a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1}) is a constant independent of k. Then we only need to minimize k, subject to the constraint that b_i = a_i+k>=0 for all i, and also the nonnegativity of the derived w and z sequences? But we already saw that the nonnegativity of w and z is satisfied if we choose z_1 = sum_{j=1}^{n-1} max(0, b_j - b_{j+1}) and then w_1 = b_1 - z_1 = M>=0, and the other w_i and z_i are nonnegative. The only constraint is b_i = a_i+k>=0 for all i, i.e., k>= -min(a_i). Therefore, the minimal T is achieved when k = -min(a_i), and then T = -min(a_i) + C.\n\n      So the answer for a test case is:\n\n          C = a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1])\n          then answer = C - min(a_i)\n\n      Example 1: [1,2,1]\n          a_1=1\n          a_2=2 -> max(0,2-1)=1\n          a_3=1 -> max(0,1-2)=0\n          C = 1+1 = 2.\n          min(a_i)=1\n          answer = 2 - 1 = 1. But the sample output is 3. This is not matching. Let me try the sample [6,4,6]:\n          a_1=6\n          a_2=4 -> max(0,4-6)=0\n          a_3=6 -> max(0,6-4)=2\n          C = 6+0+2 = 8.\n          min(a_i)=4\n          answer = 8-4=4, but expected 13. Clearly not. What went wrong? We had: \n        total operations = b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i-b_{i-1}) = (a_1+k) + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, (a_i+k) - (a_{i-1}+k))\n        = a_1+k + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1}) = k + [ a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1}) ]\n\n  and then we set k = -min(a_i) to minimize. But the sample [1,2,1]: \n        a_1=1, a_2=2, a_3=1.\n        C = 1 + max(0,2-1) + max(0,1-2) = 1+1+0 = 2. k = -min(a_i) = -1. total = 2 -1 = 1. But the sample output is 3.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs (i, j) (i<j) such that the two strings (each of length 2) differ in exactly one position.\n\nThe current code uses a Counter for the strings. Then it iterates over every pair of distinct strings (x and y) and checks if they are distinct and if either the first character is the same or the second character is the same. However, note that if both characters are the same, then the strings are the same and we skip because of x!=y. But if they are different and one of the positions is the same, then they might differ in exactly one position? Not exactly: if both positions are different, then we don't want to count. So the condition (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]) is actually including two cases:\n  Case 1: first character same and second character different -> exactly one difference.\n  Case 2: second character same and first character different -> exactly one difference.\nBut note: if both are same, then the string is same and we skip because of x!=y. However, the condition also includes the case where both are same? Actually no: because if both are same then the string is same and we skip by x!=y. But what if two different strings have the same first character and same second character? That's not possible because then they would be the same string.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the current nested loop counts each pair twice? Because (x,y) and (y,x) are both considered. Then we do cnt//2 at the end.\n\nBut the current code does not account for the fact that if two strings are identical, they are not considered (because of x!=y). However, identical strings do not form a valid pair? Actually, they don't because they don't have exactly one difference (they have zero). So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: the condition (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]) is too broad? Consider two strings that are completely different: \"ab\" and \"cd\". Then the condition is false? So we skip. That's correct because they differ in two positions.\n\nBut what about two strings that are the same? We skip because of x!=y.\n\nSo the condition is correct: we only consider pairs that share at least one common character in one of the positions. But note: we want exactly one difference. So if they share the first character, then the second must be different? And if they share the second, then the first must be different? Actually, if they share the first and the second is different, then that's one difference. Similarly for the second. But what if they share both? Then they are the same and we skip.\n\nSo the condition (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]) is exactly the condition for having at most one difference? Actually, no: because if they share the first, the second might be same or different. But if the second is same, then they are same and we skip. Similarly, if they share the second, the first might be same (then skip) or different. So the condition is actually: \n  (x[0]==y[0] and x[1]!=y[1]) OR (x[0]!=y[0] and x[1]==y[1])\nBut the condition (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]) includes:\n  - (x[0]==y[0] and x[1]==y[1]): same string -> skipped by x!=y.\n  - (x[0]==y[0] and x[1]!=y[1]): valid.\n  - (x[0]!=y[0] and x[1]==y[1]): valid.\n\nSo the condition is correct.\n\nHowever, the current code does not account for the frequency of the strings. We are iterating over the keys (distinct strings). For each distinct string x and distinct string y (with x != y) that satisfy the condition, we want to add the product of their frequencies? Because each occurrence of x can pair with each occurrence of y. But note: the problem counts pairs of indices. So if we have 3 of string \"ab\" and 2 of string \"ac\", then the number of pairs (i,j) with one \"ab\" and one \"ac\" is 3*2.\n\nBut the current code does:\n   for x in num:\n        for y in num:\n            if x!=y and (x[0] == y[0] or x[1] == y[1]):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to add: cnt += num[x] * num[y]\n\nBut note: this counts each pair twice? Because (x,y) and (y,x) are both considered. Then we do cnt//2 at the end. So that would be correct.\n\nHowever, the total number of pairs is the sum over distinct pairs (x,y) with x<y? But here we are iterating over all pairs and then dividing by 2. So it's the same.\n\nBut the problem: the constraints say that the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, but the distinct strings might be up to 10^5? Then the nested loop over distinct strings would be O(m^2) where m is the number of distinct strings. In worst case, m can be 10^5, then m^2 is 10^10 which is too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient solution.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe want to count pairs that differ in exactly one position.\n\nWe can break the pairs into two types:\n  Type 1: first character same, second character different.\n  Type 2: second character same, first character different.\n\nWe can count:\n  For Type 1: group by the first character. For a fixed first character c, let the strings be of the form (c, d) for various d. Then the number of pairs in this group that have different second characters: \n        total_pairs = (sum_{d} freq(c,d)) * (sum_{d} freq(c,d)) - sum_{d} [freq(c,d)]^2) // 2\n        But note: this counts every pair of two different d's. However, we don't want to count pairs that have the same d? Actually, same d would be the same string and we skip? But wait: we are grouping by first character and then by second? Actually, we are only counting pairs that have the same first character and different second characters. And that is exactly Type 1.\n\n  Similarly, for Type 2: group by the second character.\n\nBut note: a pair that has the same first character and same second character is the same string and is not included. So we are safe.\n\nHowever, the above formula for a fixed first character c: \n   total = (total_freq)^2 - (sum of squares)  // 2\n   but that counts every unordered pair of two distinct strings in the group? Actually, it counts every unordered pair of two strings (including same string) and then subtracts the same string pairs? Actually, the formula for the number of unordered pairs of distinct strings in the group is:\n        (total_freq * (total_freq-1)) // 2\n   but that is not what we want. We want to count pairs that have different second characters. However, if two strings have the same second character, they are the same? Actually, no: because we are grouping by first character, so if two strings have the same first character and same second character, they are the same string. But if they have the same first character and different second characters, they are different.\n\nBut note: we are counting pairs of distinct strings? Actually, we are counting pairs of indices (i,j) with i<j. So if we have multiple occurrences of the same string, then we have to count the pairs between different indices that are the same string? But wait: same string has zero differences -> not valid. So we don't want to count same string pairs.\n\nBut in the group by first character, we have multiple distinct strings (with different second characters) and also multiple copies of the same string. How to count?\n\nActually, we can do:\n\n  For a fixed first character c, let the frequencies for each second character d be f_d. Then the number of pairs that have the same first character and different second characters is:\n        total_pairs = (sum_{d} f_d) * (sum_{d} f_d) - sum_{d} (f_d)^2) // 2\n        = ( (total)^2 - sum_{d} (f_d)^2 ) // 2\n\nBut note: this counts every pair of two strings in the group (including pairs of the same string) and then subtracts the pairs that are the same? Actually, the term (f_d)^2: when we subtract, we are removing the pairs that are the same? Actually, the formula for the sum of products over distinct pairs is: \n        for two distinct d1 and d2: f_{d1} * f_{d2} = (total)^2 - sum_{d} (f_d)^2) // 2? \n        Actually, no: the entire expression (total)^2 = (sum f_d)^2 = sum_{d} f_d^2 + 2 * sum_{d1<d2} f_{d1}*f_{d2}\n        So: sum_{d1<d2} f_{d1}*f_{d2} = ( (total)^2 - sum_{d} f_d^2 ) // 2.\n\nBut note: this counts pairs of two different d's. And that is exactly the Type 1 pairs for the group c.\n\nSimilarly, for Type 2: group by second character, and for a fixed second character d, let the frequencies for each first character c be g_c. Then the number of pairs in this group is ( (total)^2 - sum_{c} (g_c)^2 ) // 2.\n\nBut wait: are we double counting? Consider a pair that has the same first character and same second character? That pair is not included because we are only counting pairs that have the same first character (and then different second) OR same second (and then different first). So no pair is counted twice? Actually, if a pair has both characters different, it is not counted. If it has one character same and the other different, it is counted exactly once: either in the group of the same first character (if the first is same) or in the group of the same second character (if the second is same). They cannot have both same? Then they would be the same string and not counted.\n\nSo the total count is:\n   total_pairs = (for each first character c: ( (freq_c_total)^2 - sum_{d} (freq_{c,d})^2 ) // 2 ) \n                + (for each second character d: ( (g_d_total)^2 - sum_{c} (freq_{c,d})^2 ) // 2 )\n\nBut note: the term for the same string appears in both groupings? Actually, no: we are not counting the same string in the same group? We are only counting pairs of distinct strings. And the same string is not included because we subtract the squares? Actually, the formula for a group by first character does not include pairs of the same string? Because for a fixed c, if we have two identical strings (c,d), then they are in the same d. And when we subtract the square term, we are removing the pairs that are the same? Actually, the formula (total)^2 - sum_{d} (f_d)^2 counts the cross terms for different d's. The same d is subtracted. So the same string pairs are not included? Actually, the same string pairs are not even considered because we are only counting pairs of two different d's? The same d would be the same string? Not necessarily: we could have two different strings with the same first character and same second character? Then they are the same string? Actually, the string is defined by both characters. So if two strings are the same, they have the same first and same second. So in the group by first character, they are in the same d. And we are not counting pairs within the same d? We are only counting pairs across different d's. So the same string pairs are not included.\n\nBut wait: what if we have multiple copies of the same string? Then in the group by first character, we have a frequency f_d for that d. The pairs of the same string are not included in the cross terms? They are only included in the same d? And we subtract the entire f_d^2? Actually, the formula (total)^2 = (f_d1 + f_d2 + ...)^2 = f_d1^2 + f_d2^2 + ... + 2*f_d1*f_d2 + ... \nThen (total)^2 - sum_{d} f_d^2 = 2 * (sum_{d1<d2} f_d1*f_d2). So we are only counting the cross pairs between different d's. The same d (same second character) does not contribute to the cross terms. Therefore, the pairs of two identical strings are not included. And that's what we want.\n\nHowever, note: the problem does not want pairs of identical strings. So we are safe.\n\nBut the problem: the above counts Type 1 and Type 2 separately and adds them. And there is no overlap.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  total_pairs = 0\n  group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))   # or we can use a Counter that groups by first char\n  group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))  # or by second char\n\nBut note: we don't need nested dictionaries. We can do:\n\n  by_first = defaultdict(lambda: Counter())\n  for s in strings:\n      first_char = s[0]\n      second_char = s[1]\n      by_first[first_char][second_char] += 1\n\n  Similarly, by_second = defaultdict(lambda: Counter())   # but for by_second, we group by second_char and then count by first_char? Actually, for Type 2 we only need the total per second_char and the frequencies per first_char? Actually, we can do:\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n  total_by_first = defaultdict(int)   # total for each first char\n  freq_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))   # but we don't need the inner structure? Actually, we need the inner frequencies to compute the sum of squares.\n\n  But we can also do:\n\n  for each distinct first char c, we have a list (or just the frequencies) of the second chars.\n\n  However, note: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can iterate over the distinct first chars and for each first char, iterate over the distinct second chars that appear? The total distinct second chars per first char might be large? But the total distinct strings is at most 10^5 per test case? Actually, the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the entire input is at most 10^5 strings. So the distinct strings are at most 10^5.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      from collections import defaultdict, Counter\n\n      cnt = 0\n      # We have the Counter 'num' for the entire test case.\n\n      # Group by first character: we want for each first char, the frequencies of the second char.\n      first_group = defaultdict(Counter)\n      for s, count in num.items():\n          first_char = s[0]\n          first_group[first_char][s[1]] += count\n\n      # Similarly, group by second character: for each second char, the frequencies of the first char.\n      second_group = defaultdict(Counter)\n      for s, count in num.items():\n          second_char = s[1]\n          second_group[second_char][s[0]] += count\n\n      # Now, for Type 1: for each first char c, we have a Counter for the second chars.\n      for c, counter in first_group.items():\n          total = sum(counter.values())\n          sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in counter.values())\n          cnt += (total*total - sq_sum) // 2\n\n      # For Type 2: for each second char d, we have a Counter for the first chars.\n      for d, counter in second_group.items():\n          total = sum(counter.values())\n          sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in counter.values())\n          cnt += (total*total - sq_sum) // 2\n\n  Then print(cnt)   # note: we don't need to divide by 2 because the formula for each group already gives the unordered pairs without double counting? Actually, the formula (total^2 - sq_sum)//2 is the exact count of unordered pairs of distinct second characters (for Type1) and distinct first characters (for Type2). And we are adding these two.\n\nBut wait: is this efficient? The total distinct groups (first chars) is at most 11? Because the letters are from 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters. Similarly for second_group. And the total distinct strings is at most 10^5 per test case? Actually, the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the entire input is 10^5 strings. But the distinct groups (by first char) is at most 11. So we can do.\n\nBut note: the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k', so 11 letters. So the distinct first characters are at most 11, and distinct second characters are at most 11. So we can even do:\n\n  We don't need to use defaultdict of Counter. We can use:\n\n      first_group = {}\n      for s, count in num.items():\n          c = s[0]\n          if c not in first_group:\n              first_group[c] = {}\n          d = s[1]\n          first_group[c][d] = first_group[c].get(d,0) + count\n\n  But the above is the same as defaultdict.\n\n  However, the original code already has a Counter for the entire test case. And the total distinct strings is at most 10^5? But the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the distinct strings per test case might be up to 10^5? But the grouping by first char: the outer keys are only 11. So the inner dictionaries per first char: the distinct second chars per first char is at most 11. So we can do.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5. So we can do this.\n\n  However, the original code structure is:\n\n      from collections import Counter\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n = int(input())\n          num = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n\n  We are going to change the inner loop to use grouping.\n\n  But the problem: the original code has a nested loop that we must replace because it is inefficient.\n\n  So we replace the inner loop with the grouping method.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      # We remove the nested loops and do:\n\n      # Group by first character\n      first_group = {}\n      for s, count in num.items():\n          c = s[0]\n          if c not in first_group:\n              first_group[c] = {}\n          d = s[1]\n          first_group[c][d] = first_group[c].get(d,0) + count\n\n      # Group by second character\n      second_group = {}\n      for s, count in num.items():\n          d = s[1]\n          if d not in second_group:\n              second_group[d] = {}\n          c = s[0]\n          second_group[d][c] = second_group[d].get(c,0) + count\n\n      cnt = 0\n      # For Type 1: same first char, different second char\n      for c, inner_dict in first_group.items():\n          total = sum(inner_dict.values())\n          sq_sum = sum(x*x for x in inner_dict.values())\n          cnt += (total*total - sq_sum) // 2\n\n      # For Type 2: same second char, different first char\n      for d, inner_dict in second_group.items():\n          total = sum(inner_dict.values())\n          sq_sum = sum(x*x for x in inner_dict.values())\n          cnt += (total*total - sq_sum) // 2\n\n  Then we output cnt.\n\n  But note: the original code printed cnt//2? We are not doing that anymore. We are computing the correct cnt without double counting? Actually, we are not double counting the pairs? Each pair is counted only once: either in Type1 or Type2. And the grouping by first char and second char are disjoint in the sense that a pair that has the same first char is only in Type1, and same second char only in Type2. So we don't divide by 2 at the end? We just print cnt.\n\n  However, the original code had a nested loop that counted each pair twice? And then divided by 2. But we are not using that anymore.\n\n  So we remove the print(cnt//2) and replace with print(cnt). But the problem says: the original code has:\n\n      print(cnt//2)\n\n  We are replacing the entire inner loop? So we must remove the old nested loops and replace with the grouping.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire block that replaces the nested loops and the assignment to cnt.\n\n  But note: the original code initializes cnt=0. We can keep that and then do the grouping and then set cnt to the computed value? Actually, we are going to reassign.\n\n  However, the problem says: output only the missing code. The missing code is the part that replaces the TODO and the loops.\n\n  Actually, the original code has:\n\n      for x in num:\n          for y in num:\n              if ...:\n                  # TODO\n\n  We are going to replace that entire block with the grouping code.\n\n  So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      # Instead of the nested loops, we do:\n\n      # Group by first character\n      first_group = {}\n      for s, count in num.items():\n          c = s[0]\n          d = s[1]\n          if c not in first_group:\n              first_group[c] = {}\n          first_group[c][d] = first_group[c].get(d,0) + count\n\n      # Group by second character\n      second_group = {}\n      for s, count in num.items():\n          c = s[0]\n          d = s[1]\n          if d not in second_group:\n              second_group[d] = {}\n          second_group[d][c] = second_group[d].get(c,0) + count\n\n      cnt = 0\n      for inner_dict in first_group.values():\n          total = sum(inner_dict.values())\n          sq_sum = sum(x*x for x in inner_dict.values())\n          cnt += (total*total - sq_sum) // 2\n\n      for inner_dict in second_group.values():\n          total = sum(inner_dict.values())\n          sq_sum = sum(x*x for x in inner_dict.values())\n          cnt += (total*total - sq_sum) // 2\n\n  But note: the original code had a variable 'cnt' that we are reassigning. We remove the old nested loops.\n\n  However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n  But note: the grouping loops: we iterate over the distinct strings (which is at most 10^5 per test case, but the total over test cases is 10^5). So it's O(10^5) per test case? Actually, the total distinct strings over test cases is <= 10^5. So the entire grouping is O(10^5).\n\n  We are also iterating over the groups: the groups by first char: at most 11 groups, and each group has at most 11 inner keys. So the inner loops are O(11) per group, so total O(11*11) which is 121 per test case? And we have at most 100 test cases? But the total distinct strings is 10^5, so the number of test cases might be up to 100, but the grouping per test case is efficient.\n\n  So we write the above.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  The problem: minimum number of actions to make the moisture array all zeros.\n\n  The operations:\n      1. Choose a position i and decrease the prefix [1..i] by 1.\n      2. Choose a position i and decrease the suffix [i..n] by 1.\n      3. Increase the entire array by 1.\n\n  We note that operation 3 is the inverse of decreasing the entire array? But we can only increase. However, we can also use operation 1 and 2 to decrease? And operation 3 to increase.\n\n  We are to find the minimum number of operations.\n\n  The sample: \n      In the first test case: [1, 2, 1] -> we use operation 3 twice? Then becomes [3,4,3]? Then we can use operation1 and operation2? Actually, the note says: \"it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times\". But then we get [3,4,3]? How does that become zeros? Actually, the note says: \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" -> that doesn't make sense? \n\n  Actually, the note says: \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" -> but then the array becomes [1+2, 2+2, 1+2] = [3,4,3]? Then we need to remove 3,4,3? \n\n  Let me read the note again: \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" -> but the example input is not provided? The sample input is:\n\n      Example: \n        Input: \n          3\n          1 2 1\n          4\n          6 4 6\n          2\n          -2 -2\n\n        Output: \n          3\n          13\n          0\n\n      But the first test case: n=3, array = [1,2,1] -> output 3? But the note says 2? \n\n  Actually, the note says: \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" -> but then the array becomes [3,4,3]? Then we need to remove 3,4,3? How?\n\n  Alternatively, we can think: we can use operation3 to increase the entire array, but we want to get to zeros. So we must have the net effect: the total moisture must be reduced by the initial values. \n\n  However, note: operation3 increases the entire array by 1. So if we use it k times, then we have to subtract k from the entire array? But we can also subtract using operation1 and operation2.\n\n  Let x_i be the number of times we use operation1 on prefix ending at i (so for each i from 1 to n, we have a nonnegative integer x_i).\n  Let y_i be the number of times we use operation2 on suffix starting at i (for i from 1 to n).\n  Let k be the number of times we use operation3 (which increases the entire array by 1).\n\n  Then the moisture at position i becomes:\n        a_i + k - (x_i + ... + x_n) - (y_1 + ... + y_i) = 0\n\n  Rearranged:\n        (x_i+...+x_n) + (y_1+...+y_i) = a_i + k\n\n  We want to minimize: k + (x_1+...+x_n) + (y_1+...+y_n)\n\n  But note: the operations 1 and 2: we can use as many as we want? And k is also a variable.\n\n  Alternatively, we can let z_i = x_i+...+x_n (which is the total prefix operations that cover position i) and w_i = y_1+...+y_i (the total suffix operations that cover position i). Then we have:\n        z_i + w_i = a_i + k, for each i.\n\n  And we want to minimize: k + (z_1) + (w_n)   [because x_1+...+x_n = z_1, and y_1+...+y_n = w_n]? \n        Actually, the total operations: \n          k (for the increases) \n          plus the total prefix operations: x_1+...+x_n = z_1 (because z_1 = x_1+...+x_n)\n          plus the total suffix operations: y_1+...+y_n = w_n (because w_n = y_1+...+y_n)\n\n  So total = k + z_1 + w_n.\n\n  But note: we have the constraints:\n        z_1 = z_2 + x_1? Actually, z_i = x_i + z_{i+1}? \n        And w_i = w_{i-1} + y_i?\n\n  Actually, we have:\n        z_i = x_i + x_{i+1} + ... + x_n\n        so z_i = x_i + z_{i+1}   (for i from 1 to n-1), and z_n = x_n.\n\n        Similarly, w_i = y_1 + ... + y_i\n        so w_i = w_{i-1} + y_i   (for i from 2 to n), and w_1 = y_1.\n\n  And the equation: z_i + w_i = a_i + k, for each i.\n\n  We want to minimize: k + z_1 + w_n.\n\n  How to solve?\n\n  Note: we can express k as a variable. But we have:\n\n        z_1 + w_1 = a_1 + k\n        z_2 + w_2 = a_2 + k\n        ...\n        z_n + w_n = a_n + k\n\n  Subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n        (z_2 - z_1) + (w_2 - w_1) = a_2 - a_1\n\n        But z_2 = z_1 - x_1, and w_2 = w_1 + y_2? Actually, w_2 = w_1 + y_2? \n        Actually, w_2 = y_1+y_2 = w_1 + y_2.\n\n        So: (z_1 - x_1 - z_1) + (w_1+y_2 - w_1) = a_2 - a_1\n        => -x_1 + y_2 = a_2 - a_1\n\n  Similarly, for the i-th and (i-1)-th:\n\n        z_i = z_{i-1} - x_{i-1}   (for i>=2)\n        w_i = w_{i-1} + y_i\n\n        Then: \n          (z_i + w_i) - (z_{i-1}+w_{i-1}) = (a_i + k) - (a_{i-1}+k) = a_i - a_{i-1}\n          => [ (z_{i-1}-x_{i-1}) + (w_{i-1}+y_i) ] - (z_{i-1}+w_{i-1}) = a_i - a_{i-1}\n          => -x_{i-1} + y_i = a_i - a_{i-1}\n\n  So we have for i from 2 to n:\n        y_i - x_{i-1} = a_i - a_{i-1}\n\n  Also, we have the first equation: z_1 + w_1 = a_1 + k.\n\n  And the last equation: z_n + w_n = a_n + k.\n\n  But note: z_n = x_n, and w_n = w_{n-1} + y_n = ... = y_1+...+y_n.\n\n  How to minimize k + z_1 + w_n?\n\n  We have the recurrence for i=2..n: \n        y_i = a_i - a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\n\n  And we have the variables: x_1,...,x_n, y_1,...,y_n, k, and they are nonnegative.\n\n  We also have:\n        z_1 = x_1 + ... + x_n\n        w_1 = y_1\n        and the first equation: z_1 + w_1 = a_1 + k.\n\n        Similarly, the last equation: x_n + (y_1+...+y_n) = a_n + k.\n\n  We can express everything in terms of x_1 and y_1? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a known solution: \n\n  Known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n        ans = 0\n        a = [0] + list_of_a\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            diff = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            if diff > 0:\n                ans += diff\n            else:\n                ans -= diff   # because diff is negative, so we add absolute value\n\n        ans -= abs(a[1])   # or something? \n\n  Actually, known similar problem: \"https://codeforces.com/contest/1420/problem/B\"\n\n  But the known solution for this exact problem (from Codeforces Round 672 (Div. 2), problem C) is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            ans = 0\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                ans += max(0, a[i-1] - a[i])\n            print(a[0] + ans)\n\n  But that doesn't match.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a greedy method:\n\n  We note that operation3 (adding 1 to the entire array) can be thought of as a global shift. We can consider that we are going to use k to cancel the negative values? \n\n  Actually, we can transform the problem: \n\n        Let b_i = a_i + k = z_i + w_i.\n\n        And we want to minimize k + z_1 + w_n.\n\n        But note: z_1 = z_1, and w_n = w_n.\n\n        Also, we have the recurrence: \n            z_i = z_{i-1} - x_{i-1}   -> so z_i <= z_{i-1}\n            w_i = w_{i-1} + y_i        -> so w_i >= w_{i-1}\n\n        And the equation: z_i + w_i = b_i.\n\n        We want to minimize: k + z_1 + w_n = (b_1 - w_1) + (b_n - z_n) + ...? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following known solution for a similar problem (C. Array Restoration): \n\n        tot = 0\n        a = [0] + list of integers\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            tot += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])\n        print(tot - a[0])\n\n  But the sample: [1,2,1] -> \n        a = [0,1,2,1]\n        i=1: abs(1-0)=1\n        i=2: abs(2-1)=1\n        i=3: abs(1-2)=1 -> tot=3, then subtract a[0]=0 -> 3? which matches the sample output 3.\n\n  But the second sample: [6,4,6] -> \n        a = [0,6,4,6]\n        i=1: |6-0|=6\n        i=2: |4-6|=2\n        i=3: |6-4|=2 -> total=10, then subtract 0 -> 10? but expected 13.\n\n  So that doesn't work.\n\n  Another known solution: \n\n        ans = 0\n        for i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n            ans += abs(a[i]-a[i-1])\n        ans += abs(a[0])\n        # then subtract something?\n\n  For [1,2,1]: \n        i=2: |2-1|=1\n        i=1: |1-?| -> we start from n-1 to 1: \n            a[2]-a[1] = 1-2 = -1 -> abs=1\n            a[1]-a[0] = 2-1=1 -> abs=1\n            then add abs(a[0])=1 -> total=3? \n\n  For [6,4,6]:\n        a[2]-a[1] = 6-4=2 -> abs=2\n        a[1]-a[0]=4-6=-2 -> abs=2\n        then add abs(a[0])=6 -> total=10.\n\n  Not 13.\n\n  Insight: \n\n  We can consider the absolute differences and also the first and last elements.\n\n  Another approach: \n\n  We can simulate the process backwards: we want to go from a to zeros.\n\n  Operation1: decrease a prefix by 1 -> we can only decrease nonnegative values? But the array can be negative? The input says a_i can be negative.\n\n  Operation2: decrease a suffix by 1.\n  Operation3: increase the entire array by 1.\n\n  We can also think: \n\n      Let d_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i from 1 to n (with a_0=0).\n\n      Then the total number of operations might be related to the positive differences.\n\n  But the sample: [1,2,1] -> \n        d1 = 1-0=1\n        d2 = 2-1=1\n        d3 = 1-2=-1\n\n  How does that help?\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following solution from a known problem (Codeforces Round 672 (Div. 2), problem C1) but not exactly.\n\n  Known solution for a similar problem (C1. Pok\u00e9mon Army (easy version)) is different.\n\n  After research, there is a known problem: \"https://codeforces.com/contest/1422/problem/C\"\n\n  But not exactly.\n\n  Let me try to derive:\n\n  We have the following operations:\n\n      Operation1: subtract 1 from a prefix.\n      Operation2: subtract 1 from a suffix.\n      Operation3: add 1 to the whole array.\n\n  We can also note that operation3 is the reverse of a global subtraction, but we are allowed to use it arbitrarily. However, we can consider that we are going to use operation3 to make the array nonnegative? \n\n  Actually, we can reframe: \n\n      Let b_i = a_i + k, then we must have b_i = z_i + w_i, and we want to minimize k + z_1 + w_n.\n\n      And we have the constraints:\n          z_1 >= z_2 >= ... >= z_n >= 0\n          w_1 <= w_2 <= ... <= w_n\n          and the recurrence: \n             z_i + w_i = b_i, for all i.\n\n      Also, the differences: \n          z_i - z_{i+1} = x_i >= 0\n          w_{i+1} - w_i = y_{i+1} >= 0\n\n      And we have the recurrence from the differences in b_i? \n\n      How to express z_1 and w_n in terms of b_i?\n\n      Note: \n          z_1 = z_1\n          z_2 = z_1 - x_1\n          z_3 = z_1 - x_1 - x_2\n          ...\n\n          w_1 = w_1\n          w_2 = w_1 + y_2\n          w_3 = w_1 + y_2 + y_3\n          ...\n\n      Then the equations:\n\n          z_1 + w_1 = b_1\n          (z_1 - x_1) + (w_1 + y_2) = b_2   -> but also we have: x_1 = y_2 + (b_1 - b_2) from earlier recurrence: y_2 - x_1 = b_2 - b_1.\n\n      We want to minimize: k + z_1 + w_n.\n\n      But k = b_1 - z_1 - w_1.\n\n      So total = (b_1 - z_1 - w_1) + z_1 + w_n = b_1 + w_n - w_1.\n\n      Also, from the last equation: \n          z_n + w_n = b_n\n          => (z_1 - (x_1+...+x_{n-1})) + w_n = b_n\n          => z_1 - (z_1 - z_n) + w_n = b_n   [because z_1 - z_n = x_1+...+x_{n-1}]\n          => z_n + w_n = b_n   -> which is given.\n\n      So we have: total = b_1 + w_n - w_1.\n\n      Now, we need to express w_n - w_1 in terms of b_i.\n\n      Note: w_n = w_1 + (y_2+...+y_n)\n\n      So total = b_1 + (w_1 + y_2+...+y_n) - w_1 = b_1 + (y_2+...+y_n)\n\n      But we also have the recurrence: \n          for i=2 to n: y_i = x_{i-1} + (b_i - b_{i-1})   [from: y_i - x_{i-1} = b_i - b_{i-1}]\n\n      And we don't know the x's.\n\n      Alternatively, we can try to express everything in terms of b_i and the free variables.\n\n      We have freedom in choosing the sequences as long as they are nonnegative and non-increasing (for z) and non-decreasing (for w).\n\n      We want to minimize b_1 + (y_2+...+y_n).\n\n      And the constraints are:\n          b_i = z_i + w_i, with z_i non-increasing, w_i non-decreasing.\n\n      How to choose b_i? Actually, b_i = a_i + k, and k is chosen by us. But we also have to have b_i >=0? Not necessarily, because we can have negative operations? But the operations are only subtraction and addition, and the array elements can be negative.\n\n      However, the equation must hold with nonnegative x_i and y_i, and nonnegative z_i and w_i? \n\n          z_i = z_{i-1} - x_{i-1} >=0 -> so z_i is nonnegative and non-increasing.\n          w_i is nonnegative and non-decreasing.\n\n      So b_i = z_i + w_i must be at least the minimum of the two, but we have no lower bound other than nonnegativity.\n\n      But note: we can choose k arbitrarily large to make b_i arbitrarily large. However, we want to minimize the total operations.\n\n      Alternatively, we can note that the entire array can be made nonnegative by a sufficiently large k. Then we only need to consider nonnegative b_i.\n\n      Then the problem reduces to: given a sequence a_i, choose k and nonnegative sequences z (non-increasing) and w (non-decreasing) such that b_i = a_i+k = z_i + w_i, and minimize k + z_1 + w_n.\n\n      And we have: total = b_1 + (w_n - w_1) = (a_1+k) + (w_n - w_1).\n\n      But also, from the last element: b_n = z_n + w_n.\n\n      And from the first element: b_1 = z_1 + w_1.\n\n      We can also note that the differences in the b_i are constrained by the fact that the changes in z and w are nonnegative in the respective directions.\n\n      Specifically, \n          b_i - b_{i-1} = (z_i - z_{i-1}) + (w_i - w_{i-1}) \n          = (-x_{i-1}) + (y_i)\n\n      and we know that -x_{i-1} <=0 and y_i>=0.\n\n      So the difference b_i - b_{i-1} can be any real number, but we have the decomposition into a non-positive and a non-negative part.\n\n      How to minimize (a_1+k) + (w_n - w_1)?\n\n      Also, we have: \n          w_n - w_1 = (w_n - w_{n-1}) + ... + (w_2 - w_1) = y_2+...+y_n.\n\n      And from the recurrence: \n          y_i = (b_i - b_{i-1}) + x_{i-1} \n          and x_{i-1}>=0, so y_i >= b_i - b_{i-1}   [if b_i - b_{i-1} is negative, then y_i can be chosen as 0 and x_{i-1} = -(b_i - b_{i-1})?]\n\n      Actually, we have: \n          y_i = (b_i - b_{i-1}) + x_{i-1} \n          and since x_{i-1}>=0, we have y_i >= b_i - b_{i-1}.\n\n      But also, from the nonnegativity of y_i, if b_i - b_{i-1} is negative, then we must have x_{i-1} = y_i - (b_i - b_{i-1}) >= - (b_i - b_{i-1}) >0.\n\n      So the minimal possible y_i is max(0, b_i - b_{i-1}).\n\n      Therefore, the minimal possible value for (y_2+...+y_n) is sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i - b_{i-1]).\n\n      Then the total operations = b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i - b_{i-1]).\n\n      = b_1 + max(0, b_2-b_1) + max(0, b_3-b_2) + ... + max(0, b_n-b_{n-1})\n\n      = max(b_1, b_2) + max(0, b_3-b_2) + ...   ? \n\n      Actually, note: \n          b_1 + max(0, b_2-b_1) = max(b_1, b_2)\n          then max(b_1, b_2) + max(0, b_3-b_2) = max(b_1, b_2, b_3) if b_3>=b_2, or max(b_1, b_2) if b_3<=b_2? \n\n      But in general, we have:\n\n          b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i - b_{i-1}) = \n          b_1 + (max(0, b_2-b_1) + max(0, b_3-b_2) + ... ) \n          = b_1 + (b_2 - b_1 if b_2>b_1 else 0) + (b_3-b_2 if b_3>b_2 else 0) + ... \n          = \n          if we let M = max(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n), then the sum telescopes to M.\n\n      Example: \n          [1,2,1]: \n             b = [1+k, 2+k, 1+k]\n             b_1 = 1+k\n             then: \n                 b_1 + max(0, b_2-b_1) + max(0, b_3-b_2) \n                 = (1+k) + max(0, (2+k)-(1+k)) + max(0, (1+k)-(2+k))\n                 = (1+k) + max(0,1) + max(0,-1)\n                 = 1+k+1+0 = 2+k.\n\n          But we want to minimize over k? \n\n      However, we also have the last equation: the total operations = 2+k.\n\n      But we have another representation: total = k + z_1 + w_n = 2+k.\n\n      And we have the constraint: the last element: b_n = z_n + w_n = 1+k.\n\n      But also, we have the first element: b_1 = z_1+w_1 = 1+k.\n\n      How to minimize 2+k? We can choose k as small as possible.\n\n      What are the constraints on k? \n          We must have z_i and w_i nonnegative, and also the differences must be nonnegative (for the x and y sequences).\n\n      Specifically, we must have b_i>=0 for all i? Actually, not necessarily, because z_i and w_i can be negative? But we defined z_i and w_i as the total number of times we have applied the operations, so they must be nonnegative.\n\n      Therefore, b_i = a_i+k >=0 for all i.\n\n      So k >= -min(a_i) -> to make all b_i>=0.\n\n      In the example [1,2,1]: min(a_i)=1, so k>=-1. But if k=-1, then b = [0,1,0]. \n          Then total operations = 2+k = 2-1=1.\n          Is that possible? \n\n          We then have:\n            b_1=0, b_2=1, b_3=0.\n            We need: \n               z_1+w_1=0 -> z_1=0, w_1=0.\n               z_2+w_2=1.\n               z_3+w_3=0 -> z_3=0, w_3=0.\n\n          Then from z_1=0 and z_1>=z_2>=z_3, we have z_2=0, z_3=0.\n          Then w_2=1.\n          But w_1=0, w_2=1, w_3=0 -> not non-decreasing because w_3=0<w_2=1? -> not possible.\n\n      So the constraint is not only nonnegativity of b_i, but also the condition that the sequence b_i must be such that the differences in the recurrence are nonnegative? \n\n      Specifically, from the recurrence: \n          for i=2 to n: \n             -x_{i-1} + y_i = b_i - b_{i-1}\n          and x_{i-1}>=0, y_i>=0.\n\n      So we must have: \n          b_i - b_{i-1} = y_i - x_{i-1} \n          and this can be any real number, but we can choose y_i and x_{i-1} as long as they are nonnegative and the equation holds.\n\n      The necessary and sufficient condition is that we can choose the decomposition arbitrarily? \n\n      However, we already used the minimal y_i: y_i = max(0, b_i - b_{i-1}) and then x_{i-1} = y_i - (b_i - b_{i-1}) = max(0, b_i - b_{i-1}) - (b_i - b_{i-1}) = \n          if b_i - b_{i-1} >=0, then x_{i-1}=0.\n          if b_i - b_{i-1} <0, then x_{i-1} = 0 - (b_i - b_{i-1}) = b_{i-1} - b_i.\n\n      So the minimal x_{i-1} we must use is max(0, b_{i-1}-b_i).\n\n      Then the sequences are defined by:\n\n          y_i = max(0, b_i - b_{i-1})\n          x_{i-1} = max(0, b_{i-1} - b_i)\n\n      And then we can compute z_i and w_i:\n\n          z_1 = ? \n          w_1 = b_1 - z_1.\n\n          But also, from the recurrence of z: \n             z_2 = z_1 - x_1 = z_1 - max(0, b_1 - b_2)\n          and w_2 = w_1 + y_2 = (b_1 - z_1) + max(0, b_2 - b_1)\n\n          and we require: z_2 + w_2 = b_2.\n\n          Let's check: \n             z_2 + w_2 = [z_1 - max(0, b_1-b_2)] + [b_1 - z_1 + max(0, b_2-b_1)]\n                        = b_1 - max(0, b_1-b_2) + max(0, b_2-b_1)\n          Note: max(0, b_1-b_2) and max(0, b_2-b_1) are not both nonzero. \n          = b_1 - |b_1-b_2|? \n\n          But we need it to be b_2.\n\n          We have: \n             if b_1>=b_2: \n                 = b_1 - (b_1-b_2) + 0 = b_2.\n             if b_1<=b_2:\n                 = b_1 - 0 + (b_2-b_1) = b_2.\n\n          So it checks.\n\n      Then we can compute the entire z and w sequences from z_1 and the recurrence.\n\n      But we have the constraint that z_i>=0 and w_i>=0 for all i.\n\n      How to choose z_1? \n\n          w_1 = b_1 - z_1 >=0  => z_1<=b_1.\n          z_2 = z_1 - x_1 = z_1 - max(0, b_1-b_2) >=0.\n          => if b_1>=b_2, then z_1>=b_1-b_2.\n          if b_1<=b_2, then no constraint from this.\n\n          Similarly, for the next ones.\n\n      But note: the total operations = b_1 + (y_2+...+y_n) = b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i-b_{i-1}) \n      does not depend on z_1! \n\n      So we can choose any z_1 that satisfies the nonnegativity of the entire z and w sequences.\n\n      And we must ensure that the entire z sequence is nonnegative and non-increasing, and w nonnegative and non-decreasing.\n\n      The recurrence for z: \n          z_i = z_{i-1} - x_{i-1} = z_{i-1} - max(0, b_{i-1}-b_i)\n\n      This is non-increasing because we subtract a nonnegative amount.\n\n      The recurrence for w: \n          w_i = w_{i-1} + y_i = w_{i-1} + max(0, b_i-b_{i-1])\n      non-decreasing.\n\n      The only issue is nonnegativity.\n\n      For z: \n          z_i = z_1 - (x_1+x_2+...+x_{i-1}) \n               = z_1 - [ max(0, b_1-b_2) + max(0, b_2-b_3) + ... + max(0, b_{i-1}-b_i) ]\n\n      We require z_i>=0 for all i.\n\n      In particular, for i=n: \n          z_n = z_1 - [ max(0, b_1-b_2) + ... + max(0, b_{n-1}-b_n) ] >=0.\n\n      Also, w_i = b_i - z_i, and we require w_i>=0 -> z_i<=b_i.\n\n      But the minimal total operations is fixed: b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i-b_{i-1}) \n\n      and we can always choose z_1 = [ max(0, b_1-b_2) + ... + max(0, b_{n-1}-b_n) ] \n      then z_n=0, and then w_n = b_n -0 = b_n>=0.\n\n      And for the first element: w_1 = b_1 - z_1 = b_1 - [ sum_{j=1}^{n-1} max(0, b_j - b_{j+1}) ] \n      and we require w_1>=0.\n\n      Is that always true? \n\n          b_1 - [ sum_{j=1}^{n-1} max(0, b_j - b_{j+1}) ] \n          = b_1 - [ (b_1 - b_2 if b_1>=b_2 else 0) + (b_2-b_3 if b_2>=b_3 else 0) + ... ]\n\n          This is the final value of the sequence after a series of decreases. \n\n          In fact, it is the final value of the sequence if we start at b_1 and then for each j, if b_j> b_{j+1] we reduce by the difference, and if not, we don't.\n\n          So it is the minimum of the sequence? \n\n          Actually, it is the final value of the following: \n             c_1 = b_1\n             c_2 = min(c_1, b_2)\n             c_3 = min(c_2, b_3)\n             ...\n             c_n = min(c_{n-1}, b_n)\n\n          But not exactly.\n\n          Alternatively, it is: \n             b_1 - [ (b_1 - b_2)^+ + (b_2 - b_3)^+ + ... ] \n             = b_1 - (b_1 - min(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n))? \n\n          Let M = min(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n)\n          Then the sum of the decreases: \n             (b_1 - b_2)^+ + (b_2 - b_3)^+ + ... + (b_{n-1}-b_n)^+ = b_1 - M.\n\n          Why? Because the sum telescopes: \n             if the sequence is non-increasing, then it is b_1 - b_n.\n             if not, then the increases are skipped.\n\n          Actually, it is the total drop from b_1 to the minimum? \n\n          Example: [5,3,2,4]: \n             drops: (5-3)=2, (3-2)=1, (2-4)=0 -> total=3.\n             and b_1 - M = 5-2=3.\n\n          So: \n             w_1 = b_1 - (b_1 - M) = M >=0.\n\n          So it is nonnegative.\n\n      Therefore, the minimal total operations is:\n\n          T = b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i - b_{i-1}) \n             = b_1 + (b_2 - b_1)^+ + (b_3-b_2)^+ + ... \n\n          = max(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n)   [because the sum of the increases is the total increase from the first to the maximum?]\n\n          Actually, it is the maximum of the sequence? \n\n          Example: [1,2,1]: \n             b = [1+k,2+k,1+k]\n             T = (1+k) + ( (2+k) - (1+k) ) + 0 = 1+k+1 = 2+k.\n             and the maximum is 2+k.\n\n          Example: [6,4,6]: \n             b = [6+k,4+k,6+k]\n             T = (6+k) + max(0, (4+k)-(6+k)) + max(0, (6+k)-(4+k)) \n                 = 6+k + 0 + (2) \n                 = 8+k.\n             and the maximum is 6+k? \n\n          But 8+k is not the maximum.\n\n      Let me compute the maximum: \n          [6+k,4+k,6+k] -> the maximum is 6+k.\n\n      So what is 8+k? \n\n      We must then minimize T over k>= -min(a_i) such that the sequences are nonnegative? \n\n      But note: we also have the condition that the entire sequence b_i must be such that the computed w_1 = M (the minimum) is nonnegative, which it is.\n\n      But we can choose k to minimize T = b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i-b_{i-1}) \n          = a_1+k + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, (a_i+k) - (a_{i-1}+k))\n          = a_1+k + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1])\n\n      = k + [ a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1}) ]\n\n      = k + C, where C = a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1}) is a constant independent of k.\n\n      Then we only need to minimize k, subject to the constraint that b_i = a_i+k>=0 for all i, and also the nonnegativity of the derived w and z sequences? But we already saw that the nonnegativity of w and z is satisfied if we choose z_1 = sum_{j=1}^{n-1} max(0, b_j - b_{j+1}) and then w_1 = b_1 - z_1 = M>=0, and the other w_i and z_i are nonnegative.\n\n      The only constraint is b_i = a_i+k>=0 for all i, i.e., k>= -min(a_i).\n\n      Therefore, the minimal T is achieved when k = -min(a_i), and then T = -min(a_i) + C.\n\n      So the answer for a test case is:\n\n          C = a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1])\n          then answer = C - min(a_i)\n\n      Example 1: [1,2,1]\n          a_1=1\n          a_2=2 -> max(0,2-1)=1\n          a_3=1 -> max(0,1-2)=0\n          C = 1+1 = 2.\n          min(a_i)=1\n          answer = 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n      But the sample output is 3.\n\n      This is not matching.\n\n  Let me try the sample [6,4,6]:\n          a_1=6\n          a_2=4 -> max(0,4-6)=0\n          a_3=6 -> max(0,6-4)=2\n          C = 6+0+2 = 8.\n          min(a_i)=4\n          answer = 8-4=4, but expected 13.\n\n  Clearly not.\n\n  What went wrong? \n\n  We had: \n        total operations = b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i-b_{i-1}) \n        = (a_1+k) + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, (a_i+k) - (a_{i-1}+k))\n        = a_1+k + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1})\n        = k + [ a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1}) ]\n\n  and then we set k = -min(a_i) to minimize.\n\n  But the sample [1,2,1]: \n        a_1=1, a_2=2, a_3=1.\n        C = 1 + max(0,2-1) + max(0,1-2) = 1+1+0 = 2.\n        k = -min(a_i) = -1.\n        total = 2 -1 = 1.\n\n  But the sample output is 3.\n\n  Let me do the sample [1,2,1] by hand:\n\n      We have to achieve [0,0,0].\n\n      One way: \n        Use operation3 twice: then we have [3,4,3].\n        Then use operation1 on prefix of length 1: 3 times -> [0,4,3] (cost 3)\n        Then use operation1 on prefix of length 2: 4 times -> [0,0, -1] -> not good.\n\n      Another way: \n        Use operation1 on prefix of length 3: 1 time -> [0,1,0] (cost 1)\n        Use operation2 on suffix of length 3: 1 time -> [0,0,-1] -> not good.\n\n      Another way: \n        Use operation1 on prefix of length 1: 1 time -> [0,2,1] (cost 1)\n        Use operation1 on prefix of length 2: 2 times -> [0,0,1] (cost 2)\n        Use operation2 on suffix of length 1: 1 time -> [0,0,0] (cost 1)\n        total = 1+2+1 = 4.\n\n      Or: \n        Use operation2 on suffix of length 3: 1 time -> [1,2,0] (cost 1)\n        Use operation2 on suffix of length 3 again: 1 time -> [1,2,-1] -> not good.\n\n      Or use operation3 to increase first: \n        Use operation3: 1 time -> [2,3,2] \n        then use operation1 on prefix of length 1: 2 times -> [0,3,2] (cost 2)\n        then use operation1 on prefix of length 2: 3 times -> [0,0,2] (cost 3)\n        then use operation2 on suffix of length 1: 2 times -> [0,0,0] (cost 2)\n        total = 1+2+3+2 = 8.\n\n      The sample note says: \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" -> but then how to remove the [3,4 3]? \n\n        We can do:\n          operation1 on prefix of length 1: 3 times -> [0,4,3] (cost 3)\n          operation1 on prefix of length 2: 4 times -> [0,0,-1] -> not good.\n\n        Alternatively, after [3,4,3]:\n          operation2 on suffix of length 3: 3 times -> [3,1,0] (cost 3)\n          then operation1 on prefix of length 1: 3 times -> [0,1,0] (cost 3)\n          then operation2 on suffix of length 2: 1 time -> [0,0,-1] -> not good.\n\n        or after [3,4,3]:\n          operation1 on prefix of length 3: 3 times -> [0,1,0] (cost 3)\n          then operation2 on suffix of length 2: 1 time -> [0,0,-1] -> not good.\n\n      So the sample output is 3, and the sample note might be referring to a different example.\n\n      The problem note says: \n          In the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... \n          In the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... \n          In the third test case, there are no pairs.\n\n      And then: \n          In the first test case of the second example: \n             Input: \n                3\n                1 2 1\n                4\n                6 4 6\n                2\n                -2 -2\n             Output:\n                3\n                13\n                0\n\n      So the first test case of the moisture problem has n=3 and [1,2,1] and output 3.\n\n      Therefore, our formula must yield 3 for [1,2,1].\n\n      Let me re-examine the total operations expression: \n          T = b_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, b_i - b_{i-1})\n          = (a_1+k) + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1})   [because the k cancels in the differences]\n\n      = k + [ a_1 + sum_{i=2}^{n} max(0, a_i - a_{i-1}) ]\n\n      For [1,2,1]: \n          = k + [ 1 + max(0,2-1) + max(0,1-2) ] = k + [1+1+0] = k+2.\n\n      then we also have the constraint: the last element: \n          b_3 = a_3+k = 1+k = z_3+w_3.\n          and we require that the sequences are nonnegative.\n\n      But also, we have the first element: \n          b_1 = 1+k = z_1+w_1.\n\n      and the recurrence: \n          x_1 = max(0, b_1-b_2) = max(0, (1+k) - (2+k)) = max(0, -1) = 0.\n          y_2 = max(0, b_2-b_1) = 1.\n          x_2 = max(0, b_2-b_3) = max(0, (2+k) - (1+k)) = 1.\n          y_3 = max(0, b_3-b_2) = 0.\n\n      Then the sequences:\n          z_1 = ? \n          z_2 = z_1 - x_1 = z_1.\n          z_3 = z_2 - x_2 = z_1 - 1.\n          w_1 = b_1 - z_1 = 1+k - z_1.\n          w_2 = w_1 + y_2 = 1+k - z_1 + 1 = 2+k - z_1.\n          w_3 = w_2 + y_3 = 2+k - z_1.\n\n      Then the last equation: \n          z_3 + w_3 = (z_1-1) + (2+k - z_1) = 1+k = b_3, which is true.\n\n      Nonnegativity constraints:\n          z_1>=0, \n          z_2 = z_1>=0,\n          z_3 = z_1-1>=0  => z_1>=1.\n          w_1 = 1+k - z_1>=0  => z_1<=1+k.\n          w_2 = 2+k - z_1>=0  => z_<=2+k.\n          w_3 = 2+k - z_1>=0  => as above.\n\n      Also, we require the entire array b_i>=0: \n          b_1=1+k>=0, b_2=2+k>=0, b_3=1+k>=0 -> k>=-1.\n\n      We also require: \n          z_1>=1 and z_1<=1+k.\n\n      So we require 1<=1+k => k>=0.\n\n      Then the total operations = k+2.\n\n      To minimize, we take k=0, then total=2.\n\n      But the sample output is 3.\n\n      What is the catch? \n\n      The total operations count is: \n          k ( for the increase operations) \n          plus the prefix operations: x_1+x_2 = 0+1 = 1.\n          plus the suffix operations: y_1+y_2+y_3 = ? \n\n      How are the y_i indexed? \n          y_i is the number of times we use the suffix operation starting at i.\n\n      In the recurrence, we have:\n          w_1 = y_1.\n          w_2 = w_1+y_2 = y_1+y_2.\n          w_3 = w_2+y_3 = y_1+y_2+y_3.\n\n      In our construction, we have \n          w_1 = 1+k - z_1.\n          and we also have from the recurrence for the first element: \n             \n\n      We did not set y_1! \n\n      In the recurrence, we have for i=1 only: \n          z_1 + w_1 = b_1.\n      and for i>=2: \n          -x_{i-1} + y_i = b_i - b_{i-1}\n\n      So y_1 is not constrained by the recurrence. \n\n      In fact, we have freedom in choosing y_1 and z_1 as long as \n          z_1>=0, w_1>=0, and z_1+w_1 = b_1.\n\n      and then the recurrence for i=2 gives y_2 and x_1.\n\n      The total operations is: \n          k + (x_1+..+x_{n-1}) + (y_1+..+y_n)\n\n      = k + (x_1+x_2) + (y_1+y_2+y_3)   [ for n=3 ]\n\n      In our example with k=0, and choose z_1=1 (which is>=1 and<=1+0=1), then:\n          x_1=0, x_2=1.\n          y_2=1, y_3=0.\n          w_1 = 1+0 -1 =0, so y_1 = w_1 =0.\n          then total = 0 + (0+1) + (0+1+0) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n      But is this a valid solution for [1,2,1] -> [0,0,0]?\n\n        We have: \n          b = [1,2,1] (because k=0).\n          We need to achieve [0,0,0] by:\n            prefix and suffix operations.\n\n          The meaning of the variables:\n            x_1: number of times we use operation1 on prefix of length 1.\n            x_2: number of times we use operation1 on prefix of length 2.\n            y_1: number of times we use operation2 on suffix of length 3 (starting at index 1) -> covers [1,2,1]\n            y_2: number of times we use operation2 on suffix of length 2 (starting at index 2) -> covers [2,1]\n            y_3: number of times we use operation2 on suffix of length 1 ( starting at index 3) -> covers [1]\n\n          The moisture of the first tree: \n             a_1 = 1, then we do: \n                 operation1 on prefix1: x_1=0 times.\n                 operation1 on prefix2: x_2=1 time: this will subtract 1 from the first tree and also from the second tree.\n                 operation2 on suffix3: y_1=0 times.\n                 operation2 on suffix2: y_2=1 time: this will subtract 1 from the second tree and the third tree.\n                 operation2 on suffix1: y_3=0 times.\n             also we did operation3: k=0 times.\n\n          So the first tree: 1 - 1 =0.\n          second tree: 2 - 1 (from prefix2) - 1 ( from suffix2) =0.\n          third tree: 1 - 1 ( from suffix2) =0.\n\n          It works! and total operations = 0 ( for k) + (0+1) for prefix + (0+1+0) for suffix = 2.\n\n      But the sample output is 3.\n\n      The problem says: \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" -> which is not used in our solution.\n\n      So why is the sample output 3? \n\n      The sample provided in the problem for the moisture problem is: \n          Input: \n            3\n            1 2 1\n            4\n            6 4 6\n            2\n            -2 -2\n\n          Output: \n            3\n            13\n            0\n\n      So our solution for the first test case is 2, but the expected is 3.\n\n      There is a disconnect.\n\n  After re-reading the problem statement: \n        \"Leon has learned three abilities\"\n\n        and the three abilities are described as:\n\n          1. Choose a position i and decrease the level of moisture of the trees 1,2,\u2026,i by 1.\n          2. Choose a position i and decrease the level of moisture of the trees i,i+1,\u2026,n by 1.\n          3. Increase the level of moisture of all trees by 1.\n\n        and the sample: \n          In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\n\n        This implies that they used operation3 twice, and then what? \n\n        array becomes [3,4,3] \n        then they must use operation1 and/or operation2 to reduce to zero.\n\n        How many operations? \n          to reduce the first tree from 3 to 0: we can use operation1 on prefix1: 3 times, then the array becomes [0,4,3] (cost 3)\n          then to reduce the second tree from 4 to 0: we can use operation1 on prefix2: 4 times, but then the third tree becomes 3-4 = -1, which is not allowed?

\n\n        [1,2,1]\n        operation1 on prefix of length 1: 1 time -> [0,2,1] ( cost 1)\n        operation1 on prefix of length 2: 2 times -> [0,0, -1] -> not good.\n\n        [1,2,1]\n        operation2 on suffix of length 3: 1 time -> [1,2,0] ( cost 1)\n        operation2 on suffix of length 2: 2 times -> [1,0,0] ( cost 2)\n        operation1 on prefix of length 1: 1 time -> [0,0,0] ( cost 1) -> total=4.\n\n      or \n        [1,2,1]\n        operation1 on prefix of length 2: 1 time -> [0,1,0] ( cost 1)\n        operation2 on suffix of length 2: 1 time -> [0,0, -1] -> not good.\n\n      or \n        [1,2,1]\n        operation1 on prefix of length 3: 1 time -> [0,1,0] ( cost 1)\n        operation2 on suffix of length 3: 1 time -> [0,0, -1] -> not good.\n\n      So without increase, the best is 4.\n\n      with increase, we haven't found a solution with 3.\n\n      The sample output is 3, so we must be missing something.\n\n  After checking known solutions for the problem ( as it is a known problem on Codeforces): \n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n = int(input())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(n-1):\n             ans = max(ans, a[i])\n          print(ans)\n\n      This is not.\n\n      or \n          print(max(a))\n\n      for [1,2,1] -> 2, not 3.\n\n  wait, the sample output is 3 for [1,2,1] in the provided example.\n\n  The example output is: \n        3\n        13\n        0\n\n  for the three test cases.\n\n  The third test case: \n        n=2, a=[-2,-2] -> output 0.\n\n  for [ -2,-2]: \n        if we do operation3: 2 times, then [0,0] -> cost 2.\n        but output is 0.\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  I see the input for the third test case: \n        \"2\"\n        \"-2 -2\"\n\n  output 0.\n\n  So we can do nothing? because already zeros? but it's -2.\n\n  unless we can do negative operations? \n\n  The operations are defined as: \n      decrease the level ( so it can make it more negative) and increase the level.\n\n  To from [-2,-2] to [0,0]: \n      we can use operation3: 2 times, then [0,0] -> cost 2.\n\n  but output is 0.\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  The only way output is 0 is if we do nothing, but then array is [-2,-2] != [0,0].\n\n  So the example provided in the problem might be different.\n\n  Let me read the problem again: \n      \"output a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of actions\"\n\n      for the array [1,2,1] -> 3.\n\n      for [6,4,6] -> 13.\n\n      for [-2,-2] -> 0.\n\n  wait, for [-2,-2]: \n        if we use operation3: -2 times? ( which is not allowed) \n\n  or \n        if we use operation1 or operation to increase? \n\n  but the operations are only decrease for prefix/suffix and increase for the whole.\n\n  to increase a part, we cannot. \n\n  unless we use increase (operation3) to make it nonnegative, then use decrease to make it zero.\n\n  for [-2,-2]: \n        use operation3: 2 times, then [0,0] -> cost 2.\n\n  but the output is 0.\n\n  This is a contradiction.\n\n  I see the sample note: \n        In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\n\n  and then array becomes [3,4,3] -> not zeros.\n\n  so then they must use other operations to reduce.\n\n  for the array [0,0,0] ( if we start with [ -2,-2] and do nothing, we are not at zeros) \n\n  unless the array is already zeros? \n\n  the input for the third test case is: \n        2\n        -2 -2\n\n  and the output is 0.\n\n  So the only explanation is that the answer for [ -2,-2] is 0 because we can do nothing if"
