But note: if one is zero and the other is non-zero, then we can do: \n      Operation: if a_i != a_j: then set both to min(0,1)=0? So we set both to 0? But wait: the operation says: if they are not equal, set both to the minimum. So if we have (0,1): min(0,1)=0 -> then we set both to 0. So after the third operation: [0,0,3]. Then fourth: set 0 and 3 -> both to 0. So 4 operations. But the example says 4 operations. Alternatively, we could have done:\n  Operation1: choose 1 and 3 -> set both to 1 -> [1,2,1]\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,2,1]\n  Operation3: choose 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,1]\n  Operation4: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 4 operations.

But wait, is that valid? Operation1: set one of the 1's to 0 -> [0,1,2]\n  Operation2: choose 0 and 1: set both to min(0,1)=0 -> [0,0,2]\n  Operation3: choose 0 and 2: set both to 0 -> done. So 3 operations. But the example [1,1,2] has 3 elements. How about [1,1,1]? Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,0,1]\n  Operation3: choose two: 0 and 1 -> set both to 0: done in 3 operations.

Then we choose the two 1's (at indices 1 and 2) and set one of them to 0: then we get [0,0,1]? Then we need a third operation?",

Actually, the problem says: \n  \"change one of them to 0\" -> meaning we change one of the two to 0? Then the other remains? So the operation for equal numbers: we change one of the two to 0, and leave the other unchanged. Therefore, for [1,1,1]:\n  Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1] (we set the first to 0, the other two remain 1)\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,0,1] (we set the second to 0, the third remains 1)\n  Operation3: choose the 0 and the 1: set both to 0: [0,0,0] -> 3 operations. But wait, in the third operation, we can choose the two non-zero? We have one 1 and one 0? Then we set both to 0? So the operation for distinct numbers: we set both to the minimum. So if we have (0,1): min=0, so set both to 0. So the above is 3 operations. But can we do better? Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: choose the 0 and one 1: then we set both to 0? because min(0,1)=0 -> then we get [0,0,1] (because we set the 0 and the first 1 to 0? but wait, we set both to 0: so the two we choose become 0. Then the array becomes [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: choose the last 1 and a 0 -> set both to 0 -> 3 operations.",

Or:\n      Operation1: set 1 and 3 to 1 -> [1,2,1,4] \n      Operation2: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1,1,4] \n      Operation3: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,1,4] \n      Operation4: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,0,1,4] \n      Operation5: set 0 and 1 -> 0 -> [0,0,0,4] \n      Operation6: set 0 and 4 -> 0 -> 6 operations. So the first way (5 operations) is better. But note: we can do:\n      Operation1: set 1 and 4 to 1 -> [1,2,3,1] -> now we have two 1's? Operation2: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,2,3,1] \n      Then we have non-zeros: 2,3,1 -> we can use the zero to clear: \n          Operation3: set 0 and 2 -> 0 -> [0,0,3,1] \n          Operation4: set 0 and 3 -> 0 -> [0,0,0,1] \n          Operation5: set 0 and 1 -> 0 -> done in 5 operations. So 5 is the minimum. But the formula: 2 + (4-1) = 5 -> matches. Therefore, the algorithm for the case without zeros:\n\n  Let k = number of distinct non-zero numbers?",

Therefore, total operations = \n      if there is at least one duplicate: 1 + (n-1) = n\n      else: 2 + (n-1) = n+1\n\nBut wait: what if we have multiple duplicates? Example: [1,1,2,2] (n=4, two duplicates). We can set one of the 1's to zero in one operation: then we have [0,1,2,2] -> then we have one zero and three non-zero. Then we can set one of the 2's to zero? but wait, we can use the existing zero to clear the 1 and the 2's? Operation2: use the zero and the 1: set both to zero -> [0,0,2,2] -> now we have two zeros and two 2's. Operation3: set the two 2's: set one to zero -> [0,0,0,2] \n      Operation4: set the last 2 with a zero -> done in 4 operations. But according to the formula: we have duplicates initially -> so total operations = n = 4? matches. Alternatively, we could do:\n  Operation1: set one of the 1's to zero -> [0,1,2,2] \n  Operation2: set one of the 2's to zero (using the two 2's) -> [0,1,0,2] \n  Operation3: set the 1 and a zero -> set both to zero: [0,0,0,2] \n  Operation4: set the 2 and a zero -> done: 4 operations.

Then Operation3: use a zero and the 1 -> set to zero: [0,0,0,2] \n      Operation4: use a zero and the 2 -> set to zero: done in 4 operations. But we could also do:\n  Operation1: set one 1 to zero -> [0,1,2,2] \n  Operation2: use the zero and the 1 -> set to zero:",

We sort the prices in descending order and build a prefix sum array 'a' such that a[i] is the sum of the first i items in the sorted descending list (with a[0]=0).\n\nThe problem: For a query (x, y), we note that the customer must purchase at least x items to get the y cheapest ones free. But note: the customer can choose which items to buy. Since we want to maximize the free value, we want to get as much free value as possible. The free value is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase. However, note that the customer can choose any set of items. The strategy is to buy the x items that include the y cheapest items as the cheapest ones? Actually, we want to maximize the free part. The free part is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase. So we want to have the y cheapest items as expensive as possible? But note: we can choose any x items.\n\nHow to maximize the free value? We want to have a set of x items such that the y smallest items in that set are as large as possible. However, note that the entire set of items is fixed. We can sort the items in descending order and then consider contiguous segments? Actually, we can do:\n\nIdea: \n- Sort the prices in ascending order? But note: we built the prefix sum in descending order. Actually, the current code sorts the prices in descending order? Let me see: \n  sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1] -> this sorts in ascending and then reverses, so descending.\n\nBut then we build a prefix sum array for the descending sorted array. So:\n  a[0] = 0\n  a[1] = first element (largest)\n  a[2] = largest + second largest, etc.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the free part is the y cheapest items. In the set we choose, the cheapest items are the smallest ones in that set. So if we choose a set of x items, the free part is the sum of the y smallest items in that set.\n\nTo maximize the free part, we want the y smallest items in the set to be as large as possible. How? We can choose the set to be the largest x items? Then the y smallest in that set would be the last y of the largest x. But note: if we choose the largest x items, then the y smallest in that set are the last y of these x (which are the smallest among the top x). This is the best we can do? Because if we replace one of the large items with a smaller one, then the free part (which is the smallest y) might become smaller.\n\nSo the free value for a query (x,y) is the sum of the (x-y+1)-th to the x-th largest items? Actually, in the descending sorted array, the set we choose is the first x (largest). Then the smallest y in that set are the last y of these x. In the descending array, the last y are the smallest. But note: the descending array: \n  [v0, v1, ..., v_{x-1}] where v0>=v1>=...>=v_{x-1}\nThe smallest y in this set are the last y: v_{x-y} to v_{x-1}? Actually, the last y are the smallest. But in the prefix array we built, we have the prefix sums for the descending array.\n\nWe have an array 'a' such that:\n  a[0] = 0\n  a[1] = v0\n  a[2] = v0+v1\n  ...\n  a[x] = v0+v1+...+v_{x-1}\n\nWe want the sum of the last y in the set of x (which are the smallest in the set). That is the sum of the last y in the descending array of the first x? Actually, the last y in the set of x (which are the smallest) are the last y in the entire descending array? But note: the entire array is sorted descending. The set we chose is the first x. The smallest in that set are the last y of the first x.\n\nHow to get the sum of the last y of the first x? \n  total of the first x = a[x]\n  total of the first (x-y) = a[x-y]\n  then the last y = a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nBut wait: the array is descending. The first x are the largest x. The last y of these x are the smallest in the set. So the free value is a[x] - a[x-y]?\n\nExample: \n  n=5, prices = [1,2,3,5,5] -> sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n  Query: x=3, y=2 -> free value = 3+2? But note: the example says: \"the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\" -> wait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, the example: \n  \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5, the two cheapest of them are 3 + 5 = 8\"\n  But note: the example says the two cheapest are 3 and 5? Actually, 3 and 5: but 3 is less than 5? Then the two cheapest are 3 and 5? That doesn't make sense because 3<5. \n\nActually, the example input: \n  Input: \"5 3\\n5 2 3 5 1\\n3 2\\n2 1\\n5 3\"\n\nSo the prices: [5,2,3,5,1] -> sorted ascending: [1,2,3,5,5] -> then descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n\nFor the first query: x=3, y=2. The customer buys 3 items. The best is to buy the two 5's and the 3? Then the two cheapest in the set {5,5,3} are 5 and 3? But wait, the two cheapest are the two smallest: 3 and 5? Actually, the set has two 5's and one 3. The two smallest are 3 and 5? But then the sum is 8? But note: the example says 8.\n\nBut in our descending array: \n  The set we choose: the first 3: [5,5,3] -> the last two (which are the smallest two) are 5 and 3? But wait, the array is [5,5,3] -> the last two are the last two elements: 5 and 3? That is 5+3=8? But that is not the two smallest? The two smallest are 3 and 5? But 5 is the second element? \n\nActually, the descending array: \n  index0: 5\n  index1: 5\n  index2: 3\n\nThe two smallest in the set are the last two: index1 and index2? But that would be 5+3? But note: the two smallest are the two smallest values, which are 3 and 5? But 5 is repeated. \n\nSo the free value is 3+5=8? \n\nBut in our prefix array: \n  a[0]=0\n  a[1]=5\n  a[2]=5+5=10\n  a[3]=10+3=13\n\nThen the last two of the first three: a[3] - a[1] = 13-5=8 -> which is correct.\n\nSo the formula: for a query (x,y), the free value = a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nBut note: our array 'a' is built for the entire descending array. We have a[0]=0, a[1]=first element, ... up to a[n].\n\nBut what if x-y is negative? The problem states: y<=x, so x-y>=0.\n\nHowever, note: we built the prefix array for the entire array of n items. But the query x might be at most n, so we have a[0..n].\n\nBut wait: the example second query: x=2, y=1 -> free value=5? \n  a[2]=10, a[2-1]=a[1]=5 -> 10-5=5 -> correct.\n\nThird query: x=5, y=3 -> free value=6? \n  a[5] = 5+5+3+2+1 = 16\n  a[5-3]=a[2]=10 -> 16-10=6 -> correct.\n\nSo the code for program1.py: for each query (x,y), we output a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nBut note: our array 'a' has n+1 elements (from 0 to n). And x is at most n, and x-y is at least 0.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is:\n    for _ in [0]*q:\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the array 'a' we built is for the descending sorted array. And we have the entire array. \n\nHowever, note: the problem says the customer can choose any set. We argued that the best set is the set of the largest x items. This is because if we replace a large item with a smaller one, then the free part (which is the smallest y) might become smaller. So the above reasoning holds.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: we have to do this for q queries.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are given t test cases. For each test case, we are given n and a list of n integers. We can do operations until all are zero.\n\nOperation: \n  Choose two distinct indices i and j.\n  If a_i = a_j, then change one of them to 0.\n  Otherwise (a_i != a_j), change both to min(a_i, a_j).\n\nWe want the minimum number of operations to make the entire sequence zero.\n\nWe are given that the sequence can have zeros initially.\n\nThe code already handles the case when there are zeros: \n  if 0 in a:\n        print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n\nBut what if there are no zeros?\n\nWe need to consider the operations.\n\nNote: \n  Operation 1: if two numbers are equal, we can set one to 0. Then we have one zero and the other remains? But wait, we choose two numbers and then we set one of them to 0? Actually, the operation: \"change one of them to 0\". So we can choose which one to set to 0? Then the other remains the same? \n\n  Operation 2: if two numbers are different, we set both to the minimum of the two.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of operations.\n\nLet me think:\n\nWe can break the problem into two types of operations:\n\nType1: when we set one element to 0 (if we have two equal non-zero numbers). This operation sets one element to 0 and leaves the other unchanged.\n\nType2: when we set two elements to the minimum (if they are different). This operation reduces two distinct non-zero numbers to the same value (the minimum of the two). Then we can use a Type1 operation to set one of them to 0? \n\nBut note: we can also do multiple Type2 operations.\n\nExample: [1,2,3] (from the note) -> \n  Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> set both to 1? Then we get [1,1,3]. \n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,3]\n  Operation3: choose 0 and 1? But we cannot choose 0? Actually, we can choose any two distinct indices. But note: if one is zero and the other is non-zero, then we can do: \n      Operation: if a_i != a_j: then set both to min(0,1)=0? So we set both to 0? \n  But wait: the operation says: if they are not equal, set both to the minimum. So if we have (0,1): min(0,1)=0 -> then we set both to 0. \n\nSo after the third operation: [0,0,3]. Then fourth: set 0 and 3 -> both to 0. So 4 operations.\n\nBut the example says 4 operations.\n\nAlternatively, we could have done:\n  Operation1: choose 1 and 3 -> set both to 1 -> [1,2,1]\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0 -> [0,2,1]\n  Operation3: choose 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,1]\n  Operation4: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 4 operations.\n\nBut note: we can also do:\n  Operation1: choose 2 and 3 -> set both to 2 -> [1,2,2]\n  Operation2: choose the two 2's -> set one to 0 -> [1,0,2]\n  Operation3: choose 1 and 0 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,2]\n  Operation4: choose 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> 4 operations.\n\nSo it seems 4 is the minimum.\n\nBut what if we have duplicates? \n\nConsider [1,1,2]:\n  Operation1: use the two 1's to set one to 0 -> [0,1,2] -> then we have two distinct: 1 and 2. \n  Operation2: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,2]\n  Operation3: choose 0 and 2 -> set both to 0 -> done in 3 operations.\n\nBut wait, is that valid? \n  Operation1: set one of the 1's to 0 -> [0,1,2]\n  Operation2: choose 0 and 1: set both to min(0,1)=0 -> [0,0,2]\n  Operation3: choose 0 and 2: set both to 0 -> done.\n\nSo 3 operations.\n\nBut the example [1,1,2] has 3 elements.\n\nHow about [1,1,1]? \n  Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,0,1]\n  Operation3: choose two: 0 and 1 -> set both to 0: done in 3 operations.\n\nBut we can do:\n  Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,0,0] -> 2 operations? \n  But wait: after the first operation we have [0,1,1]. Then we choose the two 1's (at indices 1 and 2) and set one of them to 0: then we get [0,0,1]? Then we need a third operation? \n\nAlternatively, in the second operation, we choose the two 1's and set one to 0: we can set the last one to 0? Then we get [0,1,0] -> then we have two zeros and one 1. Then we need a third operation to set the last 1 to 0? \n\nSo [1,1,1] requires 3 operations.\n\nBut note: the operation always changes two elements? Actually, the problem says: \n  \"change one of them to 0\" -> meaning we change one of the two to 0? Then the other remains? \n\nSo the operation for equal numbers: we change one of the two to 0, and leave the other unchanged.\n\nTherefore, for [1,1,1]:\n  Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1] (we set the first to 0, the other two remain 1)\n  Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,0,1] (we set the second to 0, the third remains 1)\n  Operation3: choose the 0 and the 1: set both to 0: [0,0,0] -> 3 operations.\n\nBut wait, in the third operation, we can choose the two non-zero? We have one 1 and one 0? Then we set both to 0? \n\nSo the operation for distinct numbers: we set both to the minimum. So if we have (0,1): min=0, so set both to 0.\n\nSo the above is 3 operations.\n\nBut can we do better? \n  Operation1: choose two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,1]\n  Operation2: choose the 0 and one 1: then we set both to 0? because min(0,1)=0 -> then we get [0,0,1] (because we set the 0 and the first 1 to 0? but wait, we set both to 0: so the two we choose become 0. Then the array becomes [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: choose the last 1 and a 0 -> set both to 0 -> 3 operations.\n\nAlternatively, in Operation2: we choose the two 1's? then we set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: set the 0 and 1 to 0 -> 3 operations.\n\nSo it seems 3 is the minimum.\n\nNow, how to compute?\n\nWe note that we can use zeros to our advantage: once we have a zero, we can use it to clear any other number in one operation (by pairing the non-zero with the zero: then both become zero). \n\nSo the process:\n\n1. We can create zeros by:\n   a. If there is a duplicate non-zero, we can set one of the duplicates to zero (using one operation) and leave the other as non-zero? But then we have one zero and the rest non-zero? \n   b. Or we can use two distinct non-zeros to reduce both to the minimum (which might be the same as one of them) and then we might get duplicates? \n\nBut note: we want to minimize the operations.\n\nIdea: \n  We can clear the entire array by:\n  Step 1: create as many zeros as possible by using duplicates (if we have duplicates, we can set one of them to zero in one operation per duplicate? but note: one operation only sets one element to zero? and leaves the other?).\n\nActually, when we have two duplicates, we can set one to zero and leave the other. Then we have one zero and the rest non-zero. Then we can use that zero to clear the others? \n\nBut note: we can also use the duplicates to set multiple zeros? \n\nAlternatively, we can think:\n\n  Let m = number of distinct non-zero numbers? \n  But the example [1,1,2] has distinct non-zero numbers: {1,2} -> m=2, but we did 3 operations.\n\nAnother idea: \n  We can clear the array by:\n  - First, we use duplicate non-zero numbers to create zeros. Each such operation creates one zero and leaves one non-zero? \n  - Then, we use the zeros to clear the rest: each non-zero can be cleared by pairing with a zero (one operation per non-zero? but note: one operation clears one non-zero? because we set both to zero: the zero remains and the non-zero becomes zero? so one operation clears one non-zero?).\n\nBut wait: when we pair a non-zero with a zero, we set both to zero. But we already have a zero, so we are effectively turning the non-zero to zero and the zero remains. So we use one operation to clear one non-zero.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple zeros. Actually, we can use one zero to clear multiple non-zeros? But each operation uses two distinct indices: one zero and one non-zero. Then the non-zero becomes zero and the zero remains. So we can use the same zero for multiple operations? \n\nSo the process:\n\n  Step 1: create one zero. How?\n      - If there is already a zero, we skip this step.\n      - Otherwise, we need to create one zero. How to create one zero? \n          Option: if there is a duplicate, we can set one of the duplicates to zero (one operation) and then we have one zero and the rest non-zero (with one duplicate removed? but note: we set one to zero and leave the other? so the duplicate becomes one element and one zero). \n          But if there is no duplicate? Then we have all distinct non-zero numbers. Then we can do:\n            Operation: take two distinct numbers, say a and b (a<b), and set both to a. Then we have two a's? Then we can use one operation to set one of the a's to zero? So that takes two operations to create one zero.\n\n  Step 2: use the zero to clear the rest. Each non-zero element (except the one that we might have left from the duplicate) can be cleared in one operation (by pairing with a zero). \n\nBut note: after step 1, we have one zero and the rest non-zero. How many non-zero? Initially, we had n non-zero. Then we created one zero and we might have used two numbers to create the zero? \n\nActually, step 1: \n  Case 1: if there is a duplicate, we use one operation to set one of the duplicates to zero. Then we have:\n      zeros: 1 (the one we set) and the rest: n-1 non-zero? but note: we set one element to zero, so we have one zero and n-1 non-zero? But wait, we started with n non-zero. Then we set one to zero: so we have one zero and n-1 non-zero? Then step 2: we need to clear n-1 non-zeros, each requiring one operation? total operations = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n  Case 2: if there is no duplicate, we do:\n      Operation1: take two distinct numbers, set both to the minimum. Then we have two numbers that are the same (the minimum). Then Operation2: set one of these two to zero. Then we have one zero and the rest non-zero? How many non-zero? We started with n non-zero. We changed two of them: one to the minimum and then one of those two to zero? So we have one zero and n-1 non-zero? Then step 2: n-1 operations? total = 2 + (n-1) = n+1.\n\nBut wait: in the example [1,2,3] (n=3, no duplicates) -> we did 4 operations? but according to this: 2 + (3-1)=4 -> matches.\n\nBut what about [1,1,2]? \n  Step1: we have duplicates (two 1's). So we do one operation to set one of the 1's to zero: then we have [0,1,2] -> step2: we have two non-zeros? so 1 + 2 = 3 operations -> matches.\n\nBut what about [1,1,1]? \n  Step1: we have duplicates. We set one 1 to zero: [0,1,1] -> then we have two non-zeros? but wait, we have two 1's and one zero. Then step2: we need to clear two non-zeros? each by pairing with zero: \n      Operation2: pair the zero and one 1 -> set both to zero: [0,0,1] -> then Operation3: pair the zero and the last 1 -> set both to zero: done. So 1 + 2 = 3 operations.\n\nBut according to the formula: n = 3 -> 1 + (3-1) = 3 -> matches.\n\nBut what about [1,2,3,4] (all distinct, no duplicates)? \n  Step1: \n      Operation1: set 1 and 2 to 1? -> [1,1,3,4] -> now we have duplicates (two 1's).\n      Operation2: set one of the 1's to 0 -> [0,1,3,4] -> now we have one zero and three non-zeros.\n      Then step2: clear the three non-zeros: 3 operations? total 5 operations.\n\n  But according to the formula: 2 + (4-1) = 5.\n\nBut is there a better way? \n  Alternatively: \n      Operation1: set 3 and 4 to 3 -> [1,2,3,3] \n      Operation2: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1,3,3] \n      Operation3: set one of the 1's to 0 -> [0,1,3,3] \n      Operation4: set one of the 3's to 0? -> [0,1,0,3] \n      Operation5: set 0 and 1 -> 0 -> [0,0,0,3] \n      Operation6: set 0 and 3 -> 0 -> done: 6 operations.\n\n  Or:\n      Operation1: set 1 and 3 to 1 -> [1,2,1,4] \n      Operation2: set 1 and 2 to 1 -> [1,1,1,4] \n      Operation3: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,1,1,4] \n      Operation4: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,0,1,4] \n      Operation5: set 0 and 1 -> 0 -> [0,0,0,4] \n      Operation6: set 0 and 4 -> 0 -> 6 operations.\n\nSo the first way (5 operations) is better.\n\nBut note: we can do:\n      Operation1: set 1 and 4 to 1 -> [1,2,3,1] -> now we have two 1's? \n      Operation2: set two 1's: set one to 0 -> [0,2,3,1] \n      Then we have non-zeros: 2,3,1 -> we can use the zero to clear: \n          Operation3: set 0 and 2 -> 0 -> [0,0,3,1] \n          Operation4: set 0 and 3 -> 0 -> [0,0,0,1] \n          Operation5: set 0 and 1 -> 0 -> done in 5 operations.\n\nSo 5 is the minimum.\n\nBut the formula: 2 + (4-1) = 5 -> matches.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm for the case without zeros:\n\n  Let k = number of distinct non-zero numbers? Actually, we don't need the distinct count? \n\n  However, note: the presence of duplicates? \n\n  Actually, the step1: we need to create the first zero. \n      If there is at least one duplicate in the non-zero numbers, then we can create the first zero in 1 operation? \n      Otherwise (all distinct), we need 2 operations.\n\n  Then, after having the first zero, we need to clear the remaining non-zero numbers: which are (n - 1) because we set one element to zero? But wait: in the distinct case, we set two elements to the same value and then set one of them to zero? so we set two elements to the same value (which doesn't change the count of non-zero? we still have n non-zero) and then we set one of them to zero? so we end up with one zero and n-1 non-zero? \n\n  Actually, in the distinct case: \n      Initially: n non-zero (all distinct).\n      Operation1: set two distinct to the same value (so we have one duplicate now) -> we still have n non-zero? because we changed two numbers to the same value? but they are non-zero? \n      Operation2: set one of the duplicates to zero -> then we have one zero and n-1 non-zero? \n\n  So the total non-zero after step1 is n-1? \n\n  Then step2: we need n-1 operations to clear the rest? \n\n  Therefore, total operations = \n      if there is at least one duplicate: 1 + (n-1) = n\n      else: 2 + (n-1) = n+1\n\nBut wait: what if we have multiple duplicates? \n\nExample: [1,1,2,2] (n=4, two duplicates). \n  We can set one of the 1's to zero in one operation: then we have [0,1,2,2] -> then we have one zero and three non-zero. Then we can set one of the 2's to zero? but wait, we can use the existing zero to clear the 1 and the 2's? \n      Operation2: use the zero and the 1: set both to zero -> [0,0,2,2] -> now we have two zeros and two 2's.\n      Operation3: set the two 2's: set one to zero -> [0,0,0,2] \n      Operation4: set the last 2 with a zero -> done in 4 operations.\n\nBut according to the formula: we have duplicates initially -> so total operations = n = 4? matches.\n\nAlternatively, we could do:\n  Operation1: set one of the 1's to zero -> [0,1,2,2] \n  Operation2: set one of the 2's to zero (using the two 2's) -> [0,1,0,2] \n  Operation3: set the 1 and a zero -> set both to zero: [0,0,0,2] \n  Operation4: set the 2 and a zero -> done: 4 operations.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nBut note: what if we have more than one duplicate? We only need one duplicate to create the first zero. Then we can use that zero to clear the rest? \n\nBut we can also use duplicates to create more zeros? However, the above formula: n operations (if there is at least one duplicate) is the same as the number of elements? \n\nBut wait: the problem says: we start with n non-zero? and we want to set all to zero. Each operation sets at least one element to zero? So we need at least n operations? Actually, no: because an operation of type2 (distinct) sets no element to zero? It sets both to the minimum? which might be non-zero. \n\nBut in our step1 for distinct: we use two operations to set one element to zero? Then we use one operation per remaining non-zero? so total n operations? \n\nBut wait: in the distinct case, we do 2 operations to set one element to zero? then n-1 operations for the rest? total n+1? \n\nBut note: the operation of type2 (distinct) does not set any element to zero? So we need at least n operations? because we have n non-zero to set to zero, and each operation sets at most one element to zero? \n\nBut wait: \n  Type1: sets one element to zero? \n  Type2: sets no element to zero? \n\nSo the only operations that set an element to zero are type1? \n\nBut then how do we set the first zero? Only by type1? \n\nBut then in the distinct case, we have to do:\n  Operation1 (type2): set two distinct to the same value -> now we have a duplicate? \n  Operation2 (type1): set one of the duplicates to zero -> sets one element to zero.\n\nSo we set one element to zero in two operations? Then we have n-1 non-zero? Then we need to set each of the remaining n-1 non-zero to zero? each requiring one operation (by pairing with a zero: which is type2? because we have a zero and a non-zero: distinct -> then we set both to zero? but note: the zero becomes zero again and the non-zero becomes zero? so we set one non-zero to zero per operation). \n\nBut wait: the operation that uses a zero and a non-zero: \n  They are distinct? so we set both to min(0, non-zero)=0. So we set the non-zero to zero? and the zero remains? so we set one element to zero? \n\nTherefore, each operation that uses a zero and a non-zero sets one non-zero to zero? \n\nSo the total operations for the distinct case: 2 (to get the first zero) + (n-1) (to clear the rest) = n+1.\n\nFor the case with duplicates: \n  We can get the first zero in one operation (type1) and then clear the rest in n-1 operations? total n.\n\nBut what if we have multiple duplicates? We can use the duplicates to set multiple zeros? \n\nExample: [1,1,2,2] (n=4) -> \n  Operation1 (type1): set one 1 to zero -> [0,1,2,2] -> one zero, and we have a duplicate of 2? \n  Then we can do:\n      Operation2 (type1): set one 2 to zero? -> [0,1,0,2] -> then we have two zeros and two non-zeros? \n      Then Operation3: use a zero and the 1 -> set to zero: [0,0,0,2] \n      Operation4: use a zero and the 2 -> set to zero: done in 4 operations.\n\nBut we could also do:\n  Operation1: set one 1 to zero -> [0,1,2,2] \n  Operation2: use the zero and the 1 -> set to zero: [0,0,2,2] \n  Operation3: set one 2 to zero: [0,0,0,2] \n  Operation4: set the last 2 to zero: done.\n\nBut note: after Operation2, we have [0,0,2,2] -> then we can do:\n  Operation3: set one 2 to zero: [0,0,0,2] \n  Operation4: set the last 2 to zero: done.\n\nBut we can also do in Operation3: set the two 2's? then we set one to zero? same.\n\nSo the total is 4.\n\nBut note: we have two duplicates? we set two zeros by two type1 operations? then we set the remaining two non-zeros by two operations? total 4.\n\nBut the formula: n=4 and we have duplicates? so we do n=4 operations? matches.\n\nBut what if we have more duplicates? \n\nExample: [1,1,1,1] (n=4) -> \n  Operation1: set one 1 to zero -> [0,1,1,1] \n  Then we have three 1's? \n  Operation2: set one 1 to zero -> [0,0,1,1] \n  Operation3: set one 1 to zero -> [0,0,0,1] \n  Operation4: set the last 1 to zero? by pairing with a zero: type2? \n      But wait: we can do type1? no, because we have two 1's? but we have two 1's? \n      Actually, we have one 1? so we cannot do type1? we have to do type2: pair the 1 and a zero -> set both to zero: done.\n\n  So total 4 operations.\n\nBut we could do:\n  Operation1: set one 1 to zero -> [0,1,1,1] \n  Operation2: set one 1 to zero -> [0,0,1,1] \n  Operation3: set the two 1's: set one to zero -> [0,0,0,1] \n  Operation4: set the last 1 to zero: by pairing with a zero -> done.\n\nSo 4 operations.\n\nBut note: after Operation2, we have [0,0,1,1] -> we can do:\n  Operation3: set the two 1's: set one to zero -> [0,0,0,1] \n  Operation4: set the last 1 to zero: done.\n\nBut we can also do:\n  Operation3: set a zero and a 1 -> set to zero: [0,0,0,1] \n  Operation4: set the last 1 to zero: done.\n\nSo the formula: if there is at least one duplicate at the beginning, then we do n operations? \n\nBut note: the condition is: if there is at least one duplicate? meaning if there is any number that appears at least twice? \n\nSo the code:\n\n  if 0 in a:\n      # We have zeros. Then we can use the zeros to clear the non-zeros? \n      # How many non-zeros? = n - count(zeros) -> and each non-zero can be cleared in one operation (by pairing with a zero). \n      # But note: we don't need to create the first zero? \n      # So the number of operations = number of non-zeros? \n      # Example: [0,1,2] -> non-zeros=2 -> operations=2? \n      #   Operation1: 0 and 1 -> set to 0: [0,0,2] \n      #   Operation2: 0 and 2 -> set to 0: done. \n      # So yes.\n      print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n\n  else:\n      # no zeros initially\n      if len(a) != len(set(a)):\n          # there is at least one duplicate -> then operations = n\n          print(n)\n      else:\n          # all distinct -> operations = n+1\n          print(n+1)\n\nBut wait: what if we have zeros and duplicates? \n  Example: [0,1,1] -> \n      non-zero count = 2 -> operations = 2? \n      Operation1: we can use the two 1's? set one to zero? -> [0,0,1] -> then Operation2: set the last 1 to zero: done? \n      But we could also do:\n          Operation1: use the zero and one 1 -> set to zero: [0,0,1] -> then Operation2: set the last 1 to zero: done? \n      So 2 operations.\n\n  But the non-zero count is 2? so we output 2? correct.\n\n  However, note: we have a duplicate? but we also have a zero. The above code only checks for zeros and then subtracts the count? \n\n  So the code for the zero case: we don't care about duplicates? we just clear each non-zero by pairing with a zero? \n\n  But what if we have duplicates? we can also use the duplicates to set one to zero? but that would be one operation to set one non-zero to zero? and then we have one more non-zero? then we use the zero to clear the last? total 2 operations? same as clearing each non-zero with a zero? \n\n  So it doesn't matter: we can clear each non-zero in one operation (by pairing with a zero). \n\n  Therefore, the code for the else branch (with zeros) is correct.\n\nBut what about the example in the note? \n  The note: \n      Input: \n          3\n          3\n          1 2 3\n          3\n          1 1 2\n          3\n          1 1 1\n\n      Output: \n          4\n          3\n          3\n\n  For the first test: [1,2,3] -> no zeros and all distinct -> output 3+1 = 4? \n  Second: [1,1,2] -> no zeros and has duplicate -> output 3? \n  Third: [1,1,1] -> no zeros and has duplicate? -> output 3? \n\n  So the code:\n\n      if 0 in a:\n          print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n      else:\n          if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n              print(len(a)+1)\n          else:\n              print(len(a))\n\nBut wait: the third test: [1,1,1] -> n=3, and the set of a is {1} -> so len(set(a))=1, which is not equal to 3? so we print n=3? \n\n  So the code is:\n\n      n = len(a)   # but note: we have the list 'a'\n      if 0 in a:\n          print(n - a.count(0))\n      else:\n          if n == len(set(a)):\n              print(n+1)\n          else:\n              print(n)\n\nBut wait: the second test: [1,1,2] -> n=3, set(a) = {1,2} -> len(set(a))=2, which is not equal to n (3) -> so we print n=3? \n\n  Correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if n == len(set(a)):\n            print(n+1)\n        else:\n            print(n)\n\nBut note: the variable 'n' is the length of the sequence? and we have the list 'a' of length n.\n\nSo the code:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut we have the variable 'n' that is the length? Actually, we have:\n\n    input()\n    a = [*getInts()]\n\nAnd the variable 'n' is not defined in the function? \n\nBut the input: \n    The first line of the test case: a single integer n -> we read it with input() and then we read the next line.\n\nBut in the function, we did: \n    input()   # this reads the n? but we don't use it? \n    a = [*getInts()]   # which is a list of n integers.\n\nSo we have the list 'a'. We can use len(a) to get n? \n\nBut note: the problem says n is the length of the sequence? and we read n integers? so len(a)=n.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut we also have the variable 'n' from the outer scope? Actually, we did not define it in the function. \n\nAlternatively, we can use the variable 'n' that we read? But we read it and then discarded? \n\nWe can change the function to:\n\n    def solve():\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = [*getInts()]\n\nBut the current code does:\n\n    input()\n    a = [*getInts()]\n\nSo we are not storing n. \n\nBut we can use len(a) for n.\n\nSo the code is:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut wait: the problem says the first line of the test case is n? and then the second line is the list. \n\nBut we read the first line with input() and then the next line. \n\nSo the length of a is n? \n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut note: the example [1,1,1] has len(a)=3, set(a)={1} -> len(set(a))=1 -> not equal -> so we print len(a)=3.\n\nBut what if we have [1,2,3]? len(a)=3, set(a)={1,2,3} -> len(set(a))=3 -> equal -> we print 4.\n\nSo it matches.\n\nBut what if we have [0,0,1]? \n  if 0 in a -> True -> then we print len(a) - a.count(0) = 3 - 2 = 1? \n  But we have one non-zero? so we need one operation? \n      Operation: pair the 0 and 1 -> set both to 0? done. \n  So 1 operation -> correct.\n\nTherefore, the code for program2.py is complete.\n\nNow, we output the missing code for both programs in the specified JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the for loop for the queries.\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is the else branch.\n\nBut note: the code for program1.py: we have:\n\n    for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to write the code for the loop body.\n\nWe'll write:\n\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the array 'a' is built for the entire array (0-indexed to n). And x is at most n, and x-y is at least 0.\n\nBut what if x-y is 0? then a[0]=0, so it's safe.\n\nSo the code for program1.py: \n\n    for _ in [0]*q:\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the array 'a' is built for the descending sorted array. And we built the prefix sum for the entire array. \n\nBut the problem: the array has n items? and we built a[0..n] (n+1 elements). \n\nBut what if x is greater than n? The problem says x<=n, so safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut we have to do this for each query.\n\nSo the entire for loop block.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut note: the code in program2.py already has:\n\n    if 0 in a:\n        print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we replace the TODO with the above.\n\nBut note: the variable 'a' is the list of the sequence.\n\nNow, output in JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\n            print(len(a)+1)\\n        else:\\n            print(len(a))\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the original.\n\nIn program1.py, the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces? The original for loop is:\n\nfor _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we need to indent the two lines by 4 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the else branch is already indented by 4 spaces (from the if), and the code inside the else should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\nBut the original:\n\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\nTherefore, we write the code for program2.py with 8 spaces of indentation? \n\nBut the code we are writing is:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut note: the first line is at 8 spaces, and the next lines (if and else) should be at 8 and 12? \n\nActually, in the function, the code is:\n\n    if 0 in a:\n        print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n    else:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut the first line after else: we have an if statement. The entire block should be at the same level as the previous print? which is 8 spaces? \n\nBut the previous print is at 8 spaces? \n\nSo:\n\n    if 0 in a:\n        print(len(a) - a.count(0))   # 8 spaces\n    else:\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):    # 8 spaces\n            print(len(a)+1)           # 12 spaces\n        else:                        # 8 spaces? but we have to align with the if? \n            print(len(a))             # 12 spaces\n\nBut the else of the inner if should be at the same level as the inner if? \n\nSo the code for program2.py should be:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nBut the first line: 8 spaces, then the if condition: 12 spaces? Actually, no: the entire block is at 8 spaces? \n\nBut the if and else in the inner should be at 8 spaces? and the print at 12? \n\nActually, in Python, we indent by 4 spaces per level.\n\nThe outer if: at level 1 (4 spaces) then the body at level 2 (8 spaces). Then the else: at level 1 (4 spaces) and then the body of the else (the inner if-else) at level 2 (8 spaces). Then the body of the inner if and else at level 3 (12 spaces).\n\nSo:\n\n    if 0 in a:\n        print(len(a) - a.count(0))   # 8 spaces (level 2)\n    else:\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):    # 8 spaces (level 2)\n            print(len(a)+1)           # 12 spaces (level 3)\n        else:                        # 8 spaces (level 2) for the else, but the body is at 12?\n            print(len(a))             # 12 spaces (level 3)\n\nBut the else of the inner if should be at the same level as the inner if? so at 8 spaces? and the body of the inner else is at 12? \n\nBut the code we wrote:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nThis is at 8 spaces for the if and else, and 12 for the prints? \n\nBut in the JSON string, we have to represent the newlines and spaces.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n  \"program2\": \"        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\n            print(len(a)+1)\\n        else:\\n            print(len(a))\"\n\nThis has 8 spaces at the beginning of the first line, then 12 for the print.\n\nBut note: the original TODO is at 8 spaces? so we write the code at 8 spaces? and then the inner blocks at 12.\n\nSo the above is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for program1.py, the for loop body:\n\n    for _ in[0]*q:\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut the for loop is at 0 indentation? then the body should be 4 spaces? \n\nBut the original for loop is at 0 indentation? and the body is not written? \n\nWe write:\n\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nEach line indented by 8 spaces? Actually, no: the for loop is at 0, then the body should be one level (4 spaces). But the original code has:\n\nn,q=map(int,input().split())\na=[0]\nfor x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:a+=a[-1]+x,\nfor _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the for loop is at 0? then the body should be indented by 4 spaces? \n\nBut the TODO is in the same line? \n\nWe write two lines for the body? \n\nSo:\n\n    for _ in[0]*q:\n        x, y = map(int, input().split())\n        print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut the first line of the body is at 4 spaces, the second at 4 spaces? \n\nBut in the JSON string, we write:\n\n  \"program1\": \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\"\n\nThis has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\nBut note: the for loop is:\n\nfor _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the entire body? which is currently a comment? with two lines? \n\nSo the entire for loop becomes:\n\nfor _ in[0]*q:\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut the original for loop is written in one line? We are breaking it? \n\nBut the original code has:\n\nfor _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe can either keep it as one line and then the body? or break it? \n\nBut the body is two lines? so we must break the for loop to have a body? \n\nSo we write:\n\nfor _ in[0]*q:\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut the first line of the for loop: we break after the colon? and then the body at 4 spaces? \n\nSo the missing code for the body is two lines, each indented by 4 spaces? \n\nTherefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the first line is at 4 spaces, the second at 4 spaces? \n\nBut the entire program1.py after completion:\n\nn,q=map(int,input().split())\na=[0]\nfor x in sorted(map(int,input().split()))[::-1]:a+=a[-1]+x,\nfor _ in[0]*q:\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nThis is valid.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    x, y = map(int, input().split())\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\",\n  \"program2\": \"        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\n            print(len(a)+1)\\n        else:\\n            print(len(a))\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code: the first line has 8 spaces? and the next lines have 12 and 8 and 12? \n\nBut the entire program2.py after completion:\n\nimport sys\ninput = sys.stdin.readline\ndef getInts(): return map(int, input().split())\n\n\ndef solve():\n    input()\n    a = [*getInts()]\n    if 0 in a:\n        print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n    else:\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    solve()\n\nThis is valid.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as above."
