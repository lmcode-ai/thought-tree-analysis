The weights: \n            Alice: 7+3+20 = 30\n            Bob: 10+8+11+1 = 30\n            total candies = 3+4 = 7. So the array must have at least these 7 candies. Let's assume the array is [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] (n=7). sum = 7+3+20+10+8+11+1 = 60, x=30.\n            prefix:\n                7, 7+3=10, 7+3+20=30 -> d[30]=3.\n            suffix:\n                reversed: [1,11,8,10,20,3,7]\n                1, 1+11=12, 12+8=20, 20+10=30 -> in d, so r = d[30] + 4 = 3+4=7. So the answer is 7. Therefore, the array for the fourth test case is [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] (n=7), not the one provided in the code (which was [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1] with n=8). The input says: \n            \"The second line of each test case contains n integers\"\n\n          So the fourth test case has n=7.",

But what if the array is [0,0,...,0]? then the prefix sum will be 0 at every step. We only record the first time: d[0]=1. Then in the suffix, we will see 0 at the last element: candidate = 1+1=2. then 0+0=0: candidate = 1+2=3, then 1+3=4, ... up to 1+n-1 = n. But we break when s > x. x = 0, so we break immediately in the prefix loop? Correction: for [0,0,...,0] (n elements), total=0, x=0. In the prefix loop:\n            s=0 at the first element -> d[0]=1.\n            then s=0 at the second element -> we don't record because we only record if not in d.\n            ... until the end: s=0, but we don't record. Then in the suffix:\n            we start: s=0 -> in d, then candidate = 1+1=2. then s=0 (0+0) -> in d, candidate = 1+2=3.\n            ... until the last: candidate = 1+n. But we require d[s] + (idx+1) < = n -> 1 + (n-1) = n <= n -> valid. So we get r = n.\n\n          But is that valid?",

Then we would have prefix sum=0 (by eating 0 candies) and suffix sum=0 (by eating 0 candies) -> total=0. But we can also have Alice eat the entire array (sum=0) and Bob eat 0 -> then the total candies eaten is n+0 = n. So the answer for an array of zeros is n.\n\n          But note: the condition: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> if Alice ate the entire array, then Bob cannot eat any candy -> so Bob must eat 0. Therefore, n is valid. However, the above code for the zeros array: \n            We break in the prefix loop when s > x -> but s=0 and x=0, so we don't break. But we only record the first 0. Then in the suffix, we get every suffix sum=0, and we update r to 1+1, then 1+2, ... up to 1+n-1 = n.\n\n          But note: the entire array is zeros, so the prefix of length n has sum=0, but we did not record it because we broke the condition?",

But 1+n might be > n -> then we skip. We require d[s] + (idx+1) < = n -> for the last suffix: 1+n <= n -> false. So the last candidate is when the suffix has length n-1: candidate = 1 + (n-1) = n.

Then total operations = 2 + (6-2) = 6. That matches the example. Another example: first test case: [5,5,5,5] -> n=4, f=4.\n            k0 = ceil(4/4) - 1 = ceil(1)-1 = 1-1 = 0.\n            total operations = 0 + (4-4) = 0.\n\n          Third test case: [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> we want to choose an x? but note: we can choose any x? But if we choose x=1, then f=1. k0 = ceil(6/1)-1 = 6-1 = 5.\n            total operations = 5 + (6-1) = 10. But what if we choose x=2? f=1 -> same.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\n We are guaranteed that the total n over test cases <= 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n The idea:\n We are allowed to clone the array and then swap arbitrarily between copies. We want to have one copy that is all the same element (say x).\n How do we achieve that?\n We can think: we need to gather enough copies of the same element in one array. Note that we can swap arbitrarily so we can move any candy from any copy to any position in any other copy? \n But note: the operations are:\n   Operation 1: clone an existing array (so we get a new copy of the array at that state).\n   Operation 2: swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\n However, note the note in the problem: \n   In the example, they did:\n      Step 1: clone -> two copies of [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n      Then they swapped two pairs: so they swapped the 0 at the end of the first copy with the 1 at the beginning of the second copy? \n      Actually, the example shows: \n          [0, 1, 3, 3, 7, 0] and [0, 1, 3, 3, 7, 0] \n          Then they swap: first array becomes [0,0,0,3,7,0] and second becomes [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> but that doesn't look like a single swap.\n\n Actually, they did multiple swaps. But note: we can do as many swaps as we want? The problem doesn't limit the number of swaps, only the total operations (clones and swaps) and we want to minimize the total operations.\n\n However, note: each swap is one operation. So we want to minimize the total operations (clones + swaps).\n\n Alternate approach:\n\n Insight: We are allowed to do arbitrary swaps. Therefore, we can rearrange the candies arbitrarily in the copies. The only constraint is that we start with one copy and we can clone it arbitrarily.\n\n We wish to form one copy that has k copies of a particular value (say x) and we want k to be as large as possible? But note: the entire set of candies is fixed. We cannot create new candies. Also, we cannot destroy candies? We can only swap.\n\n However, note: we are allowed to have multiple copies of the array. But the total set of candies is the original n candies. When we clone, we are duplicating the entire set? Actually, the problem says: \"initially there is only one copy of the given array\" and then \"clone it\" meaning we get a duplicate of the entire array. So now we have two identical arrays. Then we can swap two candies from any two copies. So we are effectively moving candies between arrays.\n\n But note: the problem says \"swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions\". So we can move a candy from one array to another by swapping. However, swapping between two arrays: if we swap a candy in array1 at position i with a candy in array2 at position j, then array1 gets the candy from array2 and array2 gets the candy from array1.\n\n Therefore, we can think of the entire system as having a multiset of candies that we can redistribute arbitrarily among the arrays? Actually, the total multiset of candies is fixed: the original n candies. And we can form multiple arrays (each of length n) by cloning the entire array. But note: when we clone, we duplicate the entire array. Then we can swap arbitrarily. So we can reassign the candies arbitrarily to the arrays? However, we cannot change the total set of candies.\n\n But note: we are only required to have one array that has all elements equal. The other arrays can be arbitrary.\n\n How do we minimize the operations?\n Let k be the number of clones we make. Then we have k+1 arrays. The total number of candies is n, and each array has n positions. Therefore, we have (k+1)*n positions to fill with n candies. But note: we can put one candy in one position only? Actually, no: we started with k+1 copies of the entire array. Then we swap. So initially, each candy is present in every array? \n\n Actually, no: when we clone, we duplicate the entire array. So initially, we have two identical arrays meaning we have two copies of each candy? But that would double the total candies? \n\n This is a key point: the problem does not specify that the candies are distinct. But note the example: \n   Original: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> then after cloning we have two arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]. Now we have two zeros, two ones, two threes, etc. \n\n So the cloning operation duplicates every candy. Therefore, we have two copies of each candy? \n\n However, the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\" but that was in the description of the problem statement. But in the note, they are swapping between arrays. \n\n Clarification: the problem says \"they eat\" meaning they are taking candies? Actually, the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left ... Bob from the right\". Then they want to be fair. But then the note says: \"they can swap\". \n\n Actually, the problem statement and the note seem to be two different problems? \n\n Let me reread the problem: \n   \"Alice and Bob eat candies. ... They want to be fair. ... What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\"\n\n But then the note says: \"In the second test case ... they can create a copy ... then swap ...\"\n\n So the problem is: we are allowed to clone the array and swap arbitrarily to reassign the candies arbitrarily? Then we are going to have multiple arrays. Then Alice and Bob each choose one contiguous segment from the left and right respectively? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n And then: \"Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\"\n\n So they are going to eat from one array? But the note says they use multiple arrays? \n\n After reading the note: \n   Step 1: clone -> two arrays.\n   Then they swap: so they have two arrays: [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> then they clone the first array -> three arrays: two copies of [0,0,0,3,7,0] and one [1,1,3,3,7,3]. Then they swap again: so they swap the 3 and 7 in the first array with two zeros from the second array? \n\n But note: the problem says \"they eat\" from one array? Actually, the problem does not specify that they eat from the same array. It says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" of an array? and Bob from the right? But which array? \n\n The problem says: \"obtain a copy where all elements are equal\". Then Alice and Bob will eat from that copy? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" meaning that the total weight Alice eats equals the total weight Bob eats. And they eat from the same copy? \n\n But note: the example: \n   They end up with a copy that is all zeros. Then Alice can eat the entire array from the left? But then Bob has nothing to eat? \n\n Alternatively, they might not be eating from the same copy? \n\n After reading the problem again: \n   \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n And \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> meaning that the same candy cannot be eaten by both. But if they are eating from different arrays, then the same candy might appear in two arrays? \n\n This is confusing.\n\n However, note the initial note: \"In the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" -> that implies they are eating from the same array? because if they ate from different arrays, then they could eat the entire array each? \n\n But the problem says: \"they eat the same total weight of candies\". And the goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten? \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\".\n\n But the example: \n   First test case: [5,5,5,5] -> they eat two candies: Alice eats one from the left (5) and Bob eats one from the right (5). Total candies eaten: 2.\n\n Why not more? Because if Alice eats two from the left: [5,5] and Bob eats two from the right: [5,5] (but then they are overlapping? because the array is only 4 elements). Actually, if they are eating from the same array, then if Alice eats k from the left and Bob eats l from the right, then k+l <= n and the last k candies from the left and the first l candies from the right must not overlap? So we require k+l <= n? \n\n But note: they can choose which array to eat from? \n\n The problem does not specify. But the note says: \"obtain a copy where all elements are equal\". Then they are going to use that copy for their eating? \n\n How does the example work? \n   They end up with a copy that is all zeros. Then Alice can eat the entire array? But then Bob has nothing? \n\n Alternatively, they might not be required to eat from the same array? \n\n After reading the problem statement again: \n   \"Alice and Bob eat candies. Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n It doesn't specify the array. But then the note: \n   \"In the second test case ... they ... swap ... and then they have two arrays: [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] ... then they clone the first array ... then swap ... and finally they made a copy where all elements are equal\"\n\n And then the answer is 6 operations? \n\n But the problem asks for the minimal number of operations to create at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\n So the eating part is actually independent? The problem says: \"they want to be fair\" meaning that the total weight of candies eaten by Alice and Bob must be equal. And they can choose which candies to eat (from the entire set? but note the constraints: Alice eats from the left of some array? Bob from the right of some array? and they cannot eat the same candy). \n\n However, the problem does not specify that they eat from the same array. They might eat from different arrays. \n\n But note: the example: \n   They have a copy that is all zeros. Then Alice can eat the entire array of zeros? That would be 6 zeros? Then Bob must eat 6 zeros as well? But there are not 12 zeros? \n\n Alternatively, the problem might be: we are to create one copy that is all equal, and then Alice and Bob will eat from that copy? But then if the copy is all zeros, then Alice can eat k from the left and Bob can eat l from the right, and they must not overlap. So k+l <= n. And the total weight Alice eats = k * (that zero) and Bob = l * (that zero). So they are equal. But then the total candies eaten is k+l. We want to maximize k+l? But k+l <= n, so maximum is n. But the example: the second test case: n=3, and the answer is 6? \n\n The second test case: n=3? Actually, the second test case: \n   Input: \n        3\n        7 3 20\n        5\n        6 5 4 3 2 1\n        1\n        1000000000\n        4\n        0 1 3 3 7 0 2 1\n   But wait, the example note says: \n        For the second test case: ... the answer is 6.\n\n   The sample input: \n        t=?\n        The sample input in the note: \n          \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n ... second test case: n=6? \n\n   Actually, the note says: \n        \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n   So the array is of length 6? and they eat 3 from the left and 3 from the right? total 6.\n\n   But note: the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\" -> 6.\n\n   How is that achieved? \n        They have an array: [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6]\n        Alice eats [a1, a2, a3] -> total weight = 7\n        Bob eats [a4, a5, a6] -> total weight = 7? \n        But the note says Bob eats the first three from the right? so [a6, a5, a4]? but the weight is the same: a4+a5+a6 = 7.\n\n   How did they get the array? \n        The problem says: we are allowed to do cloning and swapping to reassign the candies arbitrarily? \n\n   But note: the problem does not require that the entire set of candies is preserved? Actually, the problem says: \"swap two elements from any two copies\" meaning we are moving the candies. \n\n   However, the goal is to have one copy that is all equal? and then from that copy, Alice and Bob will eat? \n\n   But the example: they have a copy that is all zeros? but then they eat 3 zeros from the left and 3 zeros from the right? that would be 6 zeros. But the array only has 6 zeros? \n\n   How did they get 6 zeros? \n\n   The original array: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> has two zeros. \n\n   After cloning: we have two arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> now we have four zeros? \n\n   Then they swap: \n        They swap the 1 in the first array with the 0 at the end of the second array? -> first array becomes [0,0,3,3,7,0] and second becomes [0,1,3,3,7,1] -> but that doesn't help.\n\n   Then they swap again: swap the 3 in the first array at position 2 with the 0 at the beginning of the second array? -> first array becomes [0,0,0,3,7,0] and second becomes [3,1,3,3,7,1] -> now the first array has three zeros? \n\n   Then they clone the first array: now we have three arrays: \n        [0,0,0,3,7,0] \n        [0,0,0,3,7,0]   (the clone)\n        [3,1,3,3,7,1]\n\n   Then they swap: swap the 3 and 7 in the first array with two zeros from the second array? \n        Swap the 3 at index 3 of the first array with the first 0 in the second array: \n            first array: [0,0,0,0,7,0] -> now has 5 zeros? \n            second array: [3,0,0,3,7,0] -> but we want to remove the 7 too? \n        Then swap the 7 at index 4 of the first array with the next 0 in the second array: \n            first array: [0,0,0,0,0,0] -> all zeros.\n            second array: [3,0,0,3,0,0] -> and the third array remains.\n\n   Now we have an array of all zeros. Then Alice eats the entire array? but then Bob has nothing? \n\n   But the note says: Alice eats the first three from the left and Bob eats the first three from the right? of the same array? \n        Array: [0,0,0,0,0,0]\n        Alice eats [0,0,0] (left three) -> total 0.\n        Bob eats [0,0,0] (right three: the last three) -> total 0.\n        Total candies eaten: 6? \n\n   But wait, they are eating from the same array? and the array has 6 zeros. Alice eats the first three and Bob eats the last three? that would be 6 candies? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> but here the candies are distinct? \n\n   But note: the array has 6 zeros. Are the zeros distinct? The problem does not say. But in the swapping, we moved the zeros from different arrays. \n\n   Actually, the problem does not require the candies to be distinct. We are only concerned with weights.\n\n   So the total weight Alice eats is 0 and Bob eats 0 -> they are equal. And they ate 6 candies.\n\n   But why is the answer for the test case 6? \n\n   The problem asks: \"the minimal number of operations needed to create at least one copy where all elements are equal\" -> and then we are done? \n\n   But note: the example says: \"the answer is 6\" (meaning 6 operations) for the second test case? \n\n   However, the problem output for the test case is the minimal number of operations (clones and swaps) to create the copy, not the number of candies eaten.\n\n   The note says: \"the answer is 6\" (operations) for the second test case? \n\n   But the example in the note: \n        Step1: clone -> 1 operation -> now we have two arrays.\n        Then they swap two pairs? -> 2 operations? \n        Then they clone the first array -> 1 operation -> now three arrays.\n        Then they swap two more pairs? -> 2 operations? \n        Total operations: 1+2+1+2 = 6.\n\n   So the answer for that test case is 6 operations.\n\n   How do we compute the minimal operations?\n\n   We are to create a copy that is all the same element, say x.\n\n   How many x's do we need? We need n copies of x (for an array of length n).\n\n   How many x's do we have in the entire system? \n        Initially, we have one copy of the array -> count = frequency of x in the original array.\n        Each time we clone an array that contains at least one x, we get an additional frequency of x? \n\n   But note: when we clone, we duplicate the entire array. So if we clone an array that has k copies of x, then we get an additional k copies of x.\n\n   Then we can swap: we can move x's from any array to the target array? \n\n   However, we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. So we can gather all the x's we have in the entire system and put them in one array? \n\n   But note: we start with one array. Then we can clone to get more x's? \n\n   Let f = frequency of x in the original array.\n\n   After k clones, we have (k+1) * f copies of x in total? \n\n   But we need n copies of x in one array. \n\n   However, we can only use swaps to move x's from one array to another. But note: we can also move non-x's out of the target array? \n\n   How many x's do we need in the target array? n.\n\n   How many x's do we have in the entire system? (k+1)*f.\n\n   We require: (k+1)*f >= n.\n\n   But also, we need to consider: we can only move x's that we have. And we can use swaps to move them. \n\n   However, we also need to remove the non-x's from the target array. To remove a non-x from the target array, we swap it with an x from another array. But note: we might not have an x in another array to swap? \n\n   Actually, we can swap any two elements. So if we have an x in some array and a non-x in the target array, we can swap them. This moves an x into the target and moves the non-x out.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: we need at least n x's in the entire system to fill the target array.\n\n   So: (k+1)*f >= n.\n\n   Then k >= ceil(n/f) - 1.\n\n   But we also have to account for the swaps. \n\n   How many swaps are needed? \n        Initially, the target array (which we start with) has f0 = f (if we choose the original as the target) or we might choose a clone? \n        Actually, we can choose any array as the target. \n\n        But note: we can only clone an existing array. We start with one array. Then we can clone to get more arrays. Then we can choose any array as the target.\n\n        How many swaps? \n          In the target array, we start with some number of x's (say initially f0, which is f if we start with the original, or if we clone, then the clone has f as well? because it's a copy).\n\n          Then we need to replace (n - f0) non-x's in the target array with x's. For each non-x, we need to swap it with an x from another array. \n\n          But note: when we swap, we remove one non-x from the target and put it in another array, and we bring one x from another array to the target. \n\n          However, we also remove an x from the other array. \n\n          How many x's are available in the other arrays? \n            Total x's: (k+1)*f.\n            After we put n x's in the target, the remaining x's are (k+1)*f - n.\n\n          But we need to have at least (n - f0) x's available in the other arrays to swap in? \n\n          However, note: we can do multiple swaps and we can use any array. \n\n          Actually, the minimal number of swaps is exactly (n - f0) because we need to replace each non-x in the target.\n\n          But wait: we might be able to swap non-x's between arrays without using an x? For example, swap a non-x in the target with a non-x in another array? That doesn't help. We need to bring an x in.\n\n          So we must swap a non-x in the target with an x in a non-target array. \n\n          Therefore, we need at least (n - f0) swaps.\n\n          But note: we might have to do more if we don't have enough x's? But we have (k+1)*f total x's, and we are using n of them in the target, so we have (k+1)*f - n left. And we need to have at least (n - f0) x's available in non-target arrays? \n\n          Actually, we are going to use (n - f0) x's from non-target arrays to swap into the target. So we require (k+1)*f - n >= 0? which we already have from (k+1)*f>=n.\n\n          But note: the non-target arrays might not have (n - f0) x's available? \n\n          Actually, the entire system has (k+1)*f x's. The target array will have n x's. So the rest have (k+1)*f - n x's. And we need to take (n - f0) x's from the rest. So we require (k+1)*f - n >= n - f0? \n\n          But note: f0 is the initial number of x's in the target array. The target array we choose: we can choose the array that has the most x's? \n\n          How do we choose the target array? \n            We can choose any array. But note: we can do swaps arbitrarily. However, the initial arrays are identical. Then we do swaps that might change the distribution? \n\n          Actually, we are going to design the entire process. We can choose the target array arbitrarily? \n\n          But note: we start with one array. Then we clone. Then we swap. Then we clone, etc.\n\n          We can choose the target array to be the one that ends up with the most x's? \n\n          However, we are free to assign. \n\n          Actually, we can choose the target array arbitrarily. And we can do swaps arbitrarily. Therefore, the minimal number of swaps is (n - f0) and we want to minimize the total operations (clones + swaps). \n\n          But we can choose the target array? and we can choose which array to clone? \n\n          How do we minimize? \n            Total operations = k (clones) + (n - f0) (swaps)\n\n          But note: we can choose the target array arbitrarily. And we can choose the sequence of clones arbitrarily. \n\n          However, the initial array is fixed. Then we clone. Then we can swap. Then we clone, etc.\n\n          The target array might be one that we clone multiple times? \n\n          Actually, we can choose the target array to be the one that we have built with the most x's. \n\n          How do we build the target array? \n            We start with an array (say A0) that has f0 = f x's.\n            Then we clone A0 to get A1 (which also has f x's). \n            Then we can swap: we can swap a non-x in A0 with an x in A1. Then A0 now has f+1 x's and A1 has f-1 x's.\n            Then we clone A0 to get A2 (which has f+1 x's).\n            Then we swap: swap a non-x in A0 with an x in A2 -> A0: f+2, A2: f.\n            Then we clone A0 again? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Operation 1: clone A0 -> A1 (now two arrays, each with f x's). \n            Then we swap: swap a non-x in A0 with an x in A1 -> A0: f+1, A1: f-1. (1 clone, 1 swap -> total 2 operations, and A0 has f+1)\n            Operation 2: clone A0 -> A2 (now A0: f+1, A1: f-1, A2: f+1). \n            Then swap: swap a non-x in A0 with an x in A2 -> A0: f+2, A2: f. (1 clone, 1 swap -> total 4 operations)\n            Then clone A0 -> A3: has f+2.\n            Then swap: swap a non-x in A0 with an x in A3 -> A0: f+3, A3: f+1. (1 clone, 1 swap -> total 6 operations)\n\n          We want A0 to have n x's. So we need f + k_swap = n? \n\n          Actually, each swap that brings an x into A0 increases the count by 1. And we start with f. So we need n - f swaps? \n\n          But note: we can only do one swap per clone? because after a clone we get a new array that has the same state as the cloned array. Then we can swap one x from the new array to the target? \n\n          However, we can do multiple swaps per clone? \n\n          For example, after cloning, we have a new array that has, say, g x's. Then we can swap multiple non-x's in the target with x's in the new array? as long as the new array has x's to give.\n\n          How many swaps can we do with one clone? \n            We can swap up to min(g, n - current_x_in_target) times? \n\n          But note: we might have multiple clones? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            Let k = number of clones.\n            Then the total x's available is (k+1)*f.\n\n            We want to put n x's in the target. \n\n            The minimal swaps is n - f0, but we can choose f0 to be the initial count in the target. Since we start with one array, we can choose the target to be that array? then f0 = f.\n\n            Then swaps = n - f.\n\n            But we require (k+1)*f >= n.\n\n            Then total operations = k (clones) + (n - f) (swaps).\n\n            We want to minimize k + (n - f) subject to (k+1)*f >= n.\n\n            We can choose k as the smallest integer such that k >= ceil(n/f) - 1.\n\n            Then k0 = ceil(n/f) - 1.\n\n            Then total operations = k0 + (n - f).\n\n          But wait: is that sufficient? \n\n          Example: n=6, f=2 (like the example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] has two zeros). \n            k0 = ceil(6/2) - 1 = ceil(3) - 1 = 3-1 = 2? \n            Then total operations = 2 + (6-2) = 6.\n\n          That matches the example.\n\n          Another example: first test case: [5,5,5,5] -> n=4, f=4.\n            k0 = ceil(4/4) - 1 = ceil(1)-1 = 1-1 = 0.\n            total operations = 0 + (4-4) = 0.\n\n          Third test case: [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> we want to choose an x? but note: we can choose any x? \n            But if we choose x=1, then f=1.\n            k0 = ceil(6/1)-1 = 6-1 = 5.\n            total operations = 5 + (6-1) = 10.\n\n          But what if we choose x=2? f=1 -> same.\n\n          However, the note says: for the third test case: \"there is no way ... so the answer is 0\". \n\n          But wait: the third test case: \n            Input: \n                1\n                1000000000\n            So n=1, and the array [1000000000]. \n            Then we want to create a copy that is all equal? that is already the case. \n            So operations = 0.\n\n          But the note says: \"for the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\". \n\n          However, the problem says: \"the minimal number of operations needed to create at least one copy where all elements are equal\". \n\n          In the third test case, we already have a copy that is all equal? so we don't need any operations.\n\n          But what if we choose an x that does not appear? then f=0. Then we cannot get any x? so we cannot form an array of all x? \n\n          Therefore, we must choose an x that appears at least once? \n\n          But note: the problem does not specify which x to choose. We are free to choose x arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, the problem: we are to create a copy where all elements are equal. We can choose the value arbitrarily? \n\n          So we choose the x that minimizes the total operations? \n\n          Therefore, for a fixed x, we compute:\n            f = frequency of x in the original array.\n            Then k0 = ceil(n/f) - 1, and total_ops = k0 + (n - f)   [if f>0]\n\n          But if f=0, then we skip? but we cannot form the array? \n\n          However, the problem says: we must create a copy where all elements are equal. If we choose an x that does not appear, we cannot do it? \n\n          Therefore, we must choose an x that appears at least once. \n\n          Then we minimize total_ops over all x that appear.\n\n          But note: what if we choose an x that appears f times, but then we can form the array? \n\n          However, we must consider: we are allowed to do the operations arbitrarily. The above formula gives the minimal operations for a fixed x.\n\n          Then we do: \n            ans = min_{x in distinct numbers that appear} { ceil(n/f_x) - 1 + (n - f_x) }\n\n          But note: we can also consider: we might not need to do all the swaps? \n\n          However, we need to replace n - f_x non-x's in the target array? so we need at least n - f_x swaps.\n\n          And we need at least ceil(n/f_x)-1 clones to have enough x's.\n\n          But is it always possible to achieve with exactly ceil(n/f_x)-1 clones and n-f_x swaps? \n\n          We have to check: \n            After k0 = ceil(n/f_x)-1 clones, we have k0+1 arrays, and total x's = (k0+1)*f_x >= n.\n\n            Then we can do n - f_x swaps: \n                We start with the target array (which has f_x x's). \n                We have (k0+1)*f_x - f_x = k0 * f_x x's in the other arrays.\n                We need to swap n - f_x times: we take n - f_x x's from the other arrays (which we have at least: because k0 * f_x >= n - f_x? \n                    Since (k0+1)*f_x >= n  => k0 * f_x >= n - f_x.\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations for x is: \n                k0 = ceil(n/f_x) - 1\n                total_ops = k0 + (n - f_x)\n\n          Then we minimize over x.\n\n          However, note: we might be able to do better by using a different strategy? \n\n          But the above seems to be the natural one.\n\n          Let's test with the fourth test case: \n            Input: \n                4\n                0 1 3 3 7 0 2 1   -> n=8\n            The note says: Alice will eat [7,3,20] (but wait, that doesn't match the input) -> actually the note says: \n                \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n            That doesn't match the input. \n\n            The fourth test case input: \n                n=8, array = [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1]\n\n            The note says: \"they each eat 30 weight\" and the answer is 7 (operations?).\n\n            How do we compute for x? \n                We try x=0: f0 = 2 -> k0 = ceil(8/2)-1 = 4-1=3, total_ops = 3 + (8-2) = 9.\n                x=1: f1=2 -> same 9.\n                x=3: f3=2 -> 9.\n                x=7: f7=1 -> k0=ceil(8/1)-1=8-1=7, total_ops=7+7=14.\n                x=2: f2=1 -> 14.\n\n            The minimum is 9? but the note says the answer is 7.\n\n          What went wrong?\n\n          The note says: \n            \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          That doesn't match the input [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1]. \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The second line of each test case contains n integers ...\"\n\n          The fourth test case: \n            \"4\n            0 1 3 3 7 0 2 1\"\n\n          But the note says: \n            \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          This seems to be a different array. \n\n          Looking at the sample input in the problem statement: \n            \"The first line contains an integer t (1<=t<=10000) ...\"\n\n          Then the sample test cases: \n            t=?\n            The example note lists:\n                test1: n=4, [5,5,5,5] -> answer=0\n                test2: n=6, [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> answer=6\n                test3: n=1, [1000000000] -> answer=0\n                test4: n=8, [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1] -> but the note says: \n                    \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          This suggests that the fourth test case has an array of 7 numbers? because 7+3+20 = 30 and 10+8+11+1=30? \n\n          Actually, the note says: \n            \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] (3 candies) and Bob will eat [10,8,11,1] (4 candies) -> total 7 candies? \n\n          But the problem asks for the total number of candies eaten? \n\n          However, the problem output is the minimal operations to create the copy, not the candies eaten.\n\n          And the note says: \"the answer is 7\" (operations).\n\n          The array for the fourth test case might be: \n            [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> n=7? \n\n          But the input says n=8? \n\n          Alternatively, the note might be describing a different example? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n          And then: \"the answer is 7\" (meaning 7 operations).\n\n          How do we get 7 operations for an array of 7 elements? \n\n          Let the array be [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> n=7.\n\n          We want to choose an x. \n\n          What is the frequency of 7? 1, 3? 1, 20? 1, 10? 1, 8? 1, 11? 1, 1? 1.\n\n          So for any x, f=1.\n\n          Then k0 = ceil(7/1)-1 = 7-1=6.\n          total_ops = 6 + (7-1) = 12.\n\n          But the note says 7.\n\n          Alternatively, the array might be: \n            [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? but then n=8.\n\n          And the note says: they eat [7,3,20] (from the left) and [10,8,11,1] (from the right) -> but that leaves the middle 5? \n\n          And the total weight: 7+3+20=30, 10+8+11+1=30.\n\n          How is that achieved? \n            They are not eating from the same array? \n\n          But the problem says: we are to create a copy where all elements are equal? and then Alice and Bob eat from that copy? \n\n          However, the note says: \"they eat the same non-zero weight\" -> 30.\n\n          But the copy they created is all equal? then how do they get 30? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me reread the problem: \n            \"Alice and Bob eat candies. Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n          And then: \"they want to be fair\" -> same total weight.\n\n          And the goal: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\"\n\n          The example: they ate 3+4 = 7 candies.\n\n          How is that related to the operations? \n\n          The problem says: we are to compute the minimal number of operations to create a copy that is all equal. Then, from that copy, Alice and Bob will eat? \n\n          But if the copy is all equal, then the total weight Alice eats = (number of candies she eats) * x, and Bob = (number of candies he eats) * x. \n          They must be equal: so (number of candies she eats) = (number of candies he eats) = k, then total candies eaten = 2k? \n\n          But 3+4=7, which is not even.\n\n          Alternatively, they might eat from different arrays? \n\n          The problem does not specify that they eat from the same array. \n\n          But then the condition \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> if they eat from different arrays, then they can eat the same candy if it appears in both arrays? \n\n          However, the cloning duplicates the entire array. So the same candy appears in multiple arrays? \n\n          But the problem says: \"initially there is only one copy\" and then \"clone it\" -> so we get a duplicate. \n\n          Then the candies are duplicated? \n\n          This is a key: are the candies distinct? \n\n          The problem does not say. But the input can have duplicates. \n\n          However, when we clone, we duplicate the entire array. So if we have an array [a1, a2, ..., an], then after cloning we have two arrays: [a1, a2, ..., an] and [a1, a2, ..., an]. \n\n          Then we have two copies of each candy. \n\n          Then Alice and Bob can eat the same candy? because it appears in two arrays? \n\n          But the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> meaning that the same physical candy? \n\n          But now we have two copies of the same candy? \n\n          This is ambiguous.\n\n          Given the complexity, let us look at the provided code template:\n\n          Code for program1.py:\n\n          for _ in range(int(input())):\r\n              n = int(input())\r\n              a = [*map(int, input().split())]\r\n              x = sum(a) // 2\r\n              s, d = 0, {}\r\n              for idx, i in enumerate(a):\r\n                  s += i\r\n                  if s > x: break\r\n                  d[s] = idx + 1\r\n              s, r = 0, 0\r\n              for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\r\n                  s += i\r\n                  if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\r\n              print(r)\n\n          This code does not match our approach.\n\n          And program2.py:\n\n          from collections import*\r\n          for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\r\n           n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\r\n           while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\r\n           print(r)\n\n          This seems to be for program2.py.\n\n          The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          And we are to output the missing code for both.\n\n          And then \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n          So we have two programs. \n\n          program1.py: \n            It reads t test cases.\n            For each test case:\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list of n integers\n\n            Then it computes x = sum(a)//2\n            Then it does:\n                s, d = 0, {}\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x: break\n                    d[s] = idx+1\n\n            Then:\n                s, r = 0, 0\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                    s += i\n                    if s in d: \n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            Then print(r)\n\n          This looks like it is solving a different problem: it is trying to find a prefix and suffix that have the same sum? and then r would be the total length of the prefix and suffix.\n\n          But the problem we are to solve is: minimal operations to create a copy that is all equal.\n\n          However, the problem statement says: \"Alice and Bob eat candies\" and they want to be fair. \n\n          And the note: \n            In the first test case: [5,5,5,5] -> they eat two candies: one from the left and one from the right? \n            In the second test case: they eat 3 from the left and 3 from the right -> total 6.\n\n          So the output for each test case is the maximum total candies they can eat (which is the number of candies, not the operations).\n\n          But the problem title: \n            \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\"\n\n          And the output specification: \n            \"For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total\"\n\n          So the program1.py and program2.py together should output the answer for each test case: the maximum total candies eaten.\n\n          However, the problem also says: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n          And then \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n          And the example: \n            program1.py: \n                for the fourth test case, the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1] -> but the note says the answer is 7 (candies eaten).\n\n          How do we compute the maximum total candies eaten? \n\n          Alice eats a prefix of some array (contiguous from the left) and Bob eats a suffix of some array (contiguous from the right) and they cannot eat the same candy. And the total weight must be equal.\n\n          But note: they might be eating from the same array? then the prefix and suffix must not overlap. \n\n          And the array might be one that we have built with operations? \n\n          However, the problem does not mention the operations in the output. It directly asks for the maximum total candies eaten.\n\n          But the note says: \n            In the second test case: 6 candies.\n            In the fourth test case: 7 candies.\n\n          How to solve: \n            We are allowed to do arbitrary clones and swaps. This means we can reassign the candies arbitrarily to any array? \n\n          However, the catch: Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix of the S array? (one array) \n\n          And the array must be one of the copies. \n\n          And the condition: the total weight of the prefix = the total weight of the suffix, and the prefix and suffix do not overlap? \n\n          But note: they can be from different arrays? \n\n          The problem does not specify. The condition \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> if they are from different arrays, then they can eat the same candy (because it appears in both arrays) -> but then it would be the same physical candy? \n\n          Given the ambiguity, and the provided code in program1.py, it seems that the intended solution is to simulate from a single array. \n\n          The code in program1.py is: \n            It computes the total sum of the array, then x = total_sum//2.\n            Then it builds a dictionary d: for prefixes that have sum <= x, it maps the sum to the length of the prefix (number of candies).\n            Then it iterates from the right, building the suffix sum. When it finds a suffix sum s that is in d, then it does something.\n\n          This is a classic two-sum (or two-pointer) for the problem: \n            Find a prefix and suffix (that are disjoint) such that their sums are equal, and maximize the total number of candies (prefix_length + suffix_length).\n\n          Why is that? \n            Because if the prefix sum = suffix sum = s, and s <= x (which is half the total sum), then we can have Alice eat the prefix and Bob eat the suffix. \n            The condition: they are from the same array? and they are disjoint? \n            How to ensure disjoint? \n                The prefix is from the left, the suffix from the right. They are disjoint if the prefix does not overlap the suffix.\n\n          How many candies: prefix_length + suffix_length.\n\n          But note: the entire array might be partitioned into prefix and suffix? \n\n          Example: [5,5,5,5]: \n            total_sum = 20, x=10.\n            prefix: \n                prefix_sum: \n                  5 -> d[5]=1\n                  10 -> d[10]=2\n                suffix_sum:\n                  start from right: \n                    5 -> s=5, then 5+5=10 -> s=10 is in d? \n                then we have a prefix of length 2 (sum=10) and a suffix of length 2 (sum=10) -> total candies = 4? \n                but the example says they eat 2 candies.\n\n          Why 2? \n            The problem says: Alice eats one from the left and Bob eats one from the right -> that's two.\n\n          But why not four? \n            Because if Alice eats two from the left (10) and Bob eats two from the right (10), then that is also valid. \n            And the total candies eaten is 4.\n\n          However, the example says the answer for the first test case is 0 operations to create the copy, and then they eat 2 candies? \n\n          But the problem output for the test case is the maximum total candies eaten? \n\n          The first test case: the maximum total candies eaten is 4? \n\n          But the example output in the problem for the first test case is 0 operations? \n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          Let me reread the problem statement: \n            \"For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies they can eat in total.\"\n\n          In the first test case: \n            \"In the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2\"\n\n          So the answer for the first test case is 2.\n\n          Why can't they eat more? \n            If they eat two from the left: [5,5] (10) and two from the right: [5,5] (10), then the total is 4, and the weights are equal. \n\n          But the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> so she must eat a contiguous prefix. \n            The array is [5,5,5,5]. \n            If Alice eats two from the left: [5,5] (positions 0 and 1), then Bob eats two from the right: [5,5] (positions 2 and 3). \n            This is valid: contiguous and non-overlapping.\n\n          So why is the answer 2? \n\n          The example says: \"There is no better way\" -> but 4 is better.\n\n          Unless the problem requires that the array from which they eat is not damaged? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> and also, once a candy is eaten, it is gone. \n\n          In the scenario where they eat from the same array: \n            If Alice eats two from the left, then those two are gone. Then the array becomes [5,5] (the two on the right). Then Bob eats two from the right of the remaining array? \n            But the array is now [5,5] -> Bob eating two from the right would eat both? \n            Then the total weight: Alice=10, Bob=10, and total candies=4.\n\n          So it is valid.\n\n          The only explanation: the example note has a mistake. \n\n          But the sample input and output in the problem statement for the first test case is 0 operations for the creation part, but the output for the eating part is 4? \n\n          However, the problem we are solving now is: \n            \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\"\n\n          So for the first test case, the answer should be 4.\n\n          But the example says 2.\n\n          This is very confusing.\n\n          Let me look at the provided code for program1.py: \n            It is clearly designed to find a prefix and suffix with the same sum and then compute the total length.\n\n          And it sets x = sum(a)//2.\n\n          In the first test case: \n            a = [5,5,5,5], sum=20, x=10.\n            prefix: \n                i=0: s=5 -> d[5]=1\n                i=1: s=10 -> d[10]=2\n                i=2: s=15 -> break.\n            suffix:\n                reversed a: [5,5,5,5]\n                i=0: s=5 -> not in d.\n                i=1: s=10 -> in d. Then what? \n                    then r = max(r, d[s] + (i+1)) = d[10] + 2 = 2+2 = 4.\n                i=2: s=15 -> not in d? \n                i=3: s=20 -> not in d.\n            then print(4)\n\n          So the first test case outputs 4.\n\n          But the example note says the answer for the first test case is 2.\n\n          This indicates a discrepancy.\n\n          However, the problem statement says: \n            \"In the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2\"\n\n          This suggests that the problem might be: \n            Alice and Bob eat in turns: \n              Alice eats from the left, then Bob eats from the right, then Alice eats from the left, then Bob eats from the right, and so on, until they have eaten the same total weight.\n\n          Then in the first test case: \n            Alice eats the first candy: 5.\n            Bob eats the last candy: 5. -> total candies=2, and they are equal.\n\n          But then they stop? \n\n          The problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" -> but it doesn't say in one move. \n\n          The note: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\" -> one each.\n\n          So the total is 2.\n\n          Why can't Alice eat two in a row? \n            The problem says: \"any number\" -> so she can eat one or more, contiguous.\n\n          But then after she eats two, the array becomes [5,5] and then Bob eats two from the right? \n\n          The problem does not specify the order. \n\n          Given the provided code in program1.py, it is likely that the intended solution is to find a prefix and suffix (not necessarily of the same array? but the code uses one array) that have the same sum and are disjoint, and maximize the total number of candies in the prefix and suffix.\n\n          And the condition: the sum of the prefix and suffix must be at most half the total sum? because x = sum//2.\n\n          Why at most half? \n            Because if the prefix sum > half, then the suffix sum cannot be equal to the prefix sum because the total sum is fixed.\n\n          In fact, if the prefix sum = s and the suffix sum = s, then 2*s <= total_sum.\n\n          The code in program1.py: \n            It only considers prefix sums <= sum//2.\n\n          Then it iterates the suffix from the right, and if the suffix sum s is in the prefix sums, then it updates r = max(r, prefix_length + suffix_length).\n\n          For the first test case: \n            prefix_sum=10 (length=2), suffix_sum=10 (length=2) -> r=4.\n\n          For the second test case: \n            array = [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> sum=14, x=7.\n            prefix:\n                0 -> d[0]=1\n                0+1=1 -> d[1]=2\n                0+1+3=4 -> d[4]=3\n                0+1+3+3=7 -> d[7]=4  (<=7, so included)\n                then 7+7=14 -> break.\n            suffix:\n                reversed: [0,7,3,3,1,0]\n                i0: 0 -> in d?

\n            \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n          This array is not [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1] but rather [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] (7 elements) or [7,3,20, something, 10,8,11,1] (8 elements).\n\n          The weights: \n            Alice: 7+3+20 = 30\n            Bob: 10+8+11+1 = 30\n            total candies = 3+4 = 7.\n\n          So the array must have at least these 7 candies. \n\n          Let's assume the array is [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] (n=7).\n            sum = 7+3+20+10+8+11+1 = 60, x=30.\n            prefix:\n                7, 7+3=10, 7+3+20=30 -> d[30]=3.\n            suffix:\n                reversed: [1,11,8,10,20,3,7]\n                1, 1+11=12, 12+8=20, 20+10=30 -> in d, so r = d[30] + 4 = 3+4=7.\n\n          So the answer is 7.\n\n          Therefore, the array for the fourth test case is [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] (n=7), not the one provided in the code (which was [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1] with n=8).\n\n          The input says: \n            \"The second line of each test case contains n integers\"\n\n          So the fourth test case has n=7.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code in program1.py, with the TODO completed, should work.\n\n          How to complete program1.py:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\r\n                n = int(input())\r\n                a = [*map(int, input().split())]\r\n                x = sum(a) // 2\r\n                s, d = 0, {}\r\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a):\r\n                    s += i\r\n                    if s > x: break\r\n                    d[s] = idx + 1\r\n                s, r = 0, 0\r\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\r\n                    s += i\r\n                    if s in d: \n                        # We have a prefix sum = s of length d[s] and a suffix sum = s of length (idx+1)\n                        # And they are disjoint?

\n            In the first test case: d[s]=2, idx+1=2, 2+2=4<=4 -> valid.\n          In the fourth test case: d[30]=3, idx+1=4, 3+4=7<=7 -> valid.\n\n          However, what if there are multiple ways? we take the maximum.\n\n          But note: the suffix is built from the right, and we are iterating from the right. We take the first suffix that has sum=s and then we have a candidate. But there might be a longer suffix with the same sum? \n\n          Actually, we are iterating the suffix from the last element inward. We want the shortest suffix that achieves the sum s? because we want to maximize the total length? \n\n          But note: if we have a suffix that has sum=s and length=L1, and a shorter suffix that has sum=s and length=L2 (L2<L1), then the total length with the prefix would be d[s] + L1 > d[s]+L2.\n\n          So we want the longest possible suffix? \n\n          However, we are iterating from the last element inward, so the first time we see a sum s might be with a long suffix? \n\n          But we are iterating in reverse order: \n            The first element in the reversed array is the last element of the original array -> suffix of length 1.\n            then suffix of length 2, etc.\n\n          So we see the shortest first.\n\n          We want the longest suffix? \n\n          Actually, we want to maximize the total length = prefix_length + suffix_length.\n\n          For a fixed s, we want the shortest suffix that has sum=s? because that leaves more room for the prefix? -> no, the prefix is fixed by s.\n\n          Actually, for a fixed s, the prefix length is fixed (d[s] = the last prefix that has sum=s, but we store the first time we achieve s? \n\n          In the prefix loop, we do:\n            for i in a:\n                s += i\n                if s not in d: then we set d[s] = idx+1   [because we want the first time we achieve s?]\n\n          But note: if there are multiple prefixes with the same sum, we want the longest prefix? or the shortest? \n\n          We want to maximize the total length = prefix_length + suffix_length.\n\n          For a fixed s, we want the longest prefix that has sum=s? because then we can have a long prefix and a long suffix? \n\n          But wait: the prefix must be contiguous from the left. The first time we achieve s might be with a short prefix, and later we might achieve s again with a long prefix? \n\n          Example: [0,1,0,0] -> \n            prefix: \n                index0: 0 -> d[0]=1\n                index1: 1 -> d[1]=2\n                index2: 1 -> we don't update d[1] because it's already there? \n                index3: 1 -> same.\n\n          We want for s=0: prefix_length=1, for s=1: prefix_length=2.\n\n          But if we have a suffix with sum=0: \n            reversed: [0,0,1,0] -> \n                suffix: \n                    first: 0 -> then we get candidate: prefix_length for 0 is 1, suffix_length=1 -> total=2.\n                    then 0+0=0 -> candidate: prefix_length=1, suffix_length=2 -> total=3.\n                    then 0+0+1=1 -> candidate: prefix_length=2, suffix_length=3 -> but 2+3=5>4 -> invalid.\n                    then 0+0+1+0=1 -> candidate: prefix_length=2, suffix_length=4 -> 2+4=6>4 -> invalid.\n\n          The best is 3.\n\n          So for a fixed s, we want the shortest prefix that achieves sum=s? because then we can have a longer suffix? \n\n          But in the example above, for s=0, the shortest prefix is 1 (achieved at index0) and then we can have a suffix of length 2 (sum=0) -> total=3.\n\n          If we took a longer prefix for s=0, say at index3: prefix_length=4, then suffix_length=1 (last element) -> total=5, but 4+1=5>4 -> invalid.\n\n          So we want the earliest occurrence of the prefix sum.\n\n          In the prefix loop, we do:\n            if s not in d: \n                d[s] = idx+1\n\n          This stores the first time we achieve the prefix sum s.\n\n          Then in the suffix, when we achieve sum=s, we compute the total length = d[s] + (idx+1) and require it <=n.\n\n          This is valid.\n\n          Therefore, the completion for program1.py is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\r\n                n = int(input())\r\n                a = [*map(int, input().split())]\r\n                total = sum(a)\r\n                x = total // 2   # we only consider prefix sums up to x (which is half the total) because if a prefix sum exceeds half, then the suffix sum cannot be the same (unless the other half is exactly the same, but then we would have already captured it at half)\n                s, d = 0, {}\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x: \n                        # we break to avoid large sums, but note: what if the total is odd? then x = total//2 (floor) and we might miss a prefix sum that is exactly (total+1)//2? \n                        # but then the suffix sum would be at least (total+1)//2, and then 2*s > total, which is not allowed.\n                        # so it's safe.\n                        break\n                    if s not in d:   # we only record the first time we achieve this sum\n                        d[s] = idx+1\n                s, r = 0, 0\n                # traverse the suffix\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x: \n                        break\n                    if s in d:\n                        # Check if the prefix and suffix do not overlap\n                        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n                print(r)\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so this is O(n) per test case.\n\n          But what if the array is [0,0,...,0]? then the prefix sum will be 0 at every step. \n            We only record the first time: d[0]=1.\n            Then in the suffix, we will see 0 at the last element: candidate = 1+1=2.\n            then 0+0=0: candidate = 1+2=3, then 1+3=4, ... up to 1+n-1 = n.\n            But we break when s > x. x = 0, so we break immediately in the prefix loop? \n\n          Correction: for [0,0,...,0] (n elements), total=0, x=0.\n          In the prefix loop:\n            s=0 at the first element -> d[0]=1.\n            then s=0 at the second element -> we don't record because we only record if not in d.\n            ... until the end: s=0, but we don't record.\n          Then in the suffix:\n            we start: s=0 -> in d, then candidate = 1+1=2.\n            then s=0 (0+0) -> in d, candidate = 1+2=3.\n            ... until the last: candidate = 1+n.\n\n          But we require d[s] + (idx+1) <= n -> 1 + (n-1) = n <= n -> valid.\n\n          So we get r = n.\n\n          But is that valid? \n            Alice can eat the entire array? but then Bob has nothing to eat? \n            Or Alice eats the entire array and Bob eats nothing? then the total weight Alice=0, Bob=0 -> valid, and total candies = n.\n\n          However, the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. \n            If Alice eats the entire array, then Bob eats 0 candies? \n            But the problem says Bob eats any number from the right (including 0? but then it's not contiguous?).\n\n          The problem: \"any number\" -> can be zero? \n            But then the suffix of length 0 has sum 0.\n            Then we would have prefix sum=0 (by eating 0 candies) and suffix sum=0 (by eating 0 candies) -> total=0.\n\n          But we can also have Alice eat the entire array (sum=0) and Bob eat 0 -> then the total candies eaten is n+0 = n.\n\n          So the answer for an array of zeros is n.\n\n          But note: the condition: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\" -> if Alice ate the entire array, then Bob cannot eat any candy -> so Bob must eat 0.\n\n          Therefore, n is valid.\n\n          However, the above code for the zeros array: \n            We break in the prefix loop when s > x -> but s=0 and x=0, so we don't break. \n            But we only record the first 0.\n\n          Then in the suffix, we get every suffix sum=0, and we update r to 1+1, then 1+2, ... up to 1+n-1 = n.\n\n          But note: the entire array is zeros, so the prefix of length n has sum=0, but we did not record it because we broke the condition? \n\n          We break in the prefix loop only when s > x. For zeros, s is always 0, so we don't break. \n          But we only record the first occurrence of 0 (at prefix length=1). \n\n          We should record the last occurrence? \n\n          But note: we want the shortest prefix that achieves the sum? to allow the longest suffix.\n\n          In the zeros array, the shortest prefix that achieves 0 is length=0? but we start at 0.\n\n          Actually, we start with s=0, then we add the first element: 0 -> s=0, then we record if not in d: so we record d[0]=1.\n\n          Then we add the second: 0 -> s=0, already in d, skip.\n\n          ...\n\n          So we only have d[0]=1.\n\n          Then in the suffix, we get:\n            suffix of length 1: 0 -> candidate = 1+1 = 2.\n            suffix of length 2: 0+0=0 -> candidate = 1+2=3.\n            ...\n            suffix of length n: 0+...+0=0 -> candidate = 1+n.\n\n          But 1+n might be > n -> then we skip.\n\n          We require d[s] + (idx+1) <= n -> for the last suffix: 1+n <= n -> false.\n\n          So the last candidate is when the suffix has length n-1: candidate = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n          And 1 + (n-1) = n <= n -> valid.\n\n          So we get r = n.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                total = sum(a)\n                x = total // 2\n                s, d = 0, {}\n                for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x:\n                        break\n                    if s not in d:\n                        d[s] = idx+1   # prefix length = idx+1\n                s, r = 0, 0\n                # Process the suffix from the last element backwards\n                for idx, i in enumerate(reversed(a)):\n                    s += i\n                    if s > x:\n                        break\n                    if s in d:\n                        # The current suffix has length = idx+1\n                        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n                print(r)\n\n          Now, what about program2.py?\n\n          The provided code for program2.py:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n             n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n             while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n             print(r)\n\n          This reads every second line starting from the second line (so the first test case's array, then the second, etc.) and then:\n\n            n = len(a)   # but a is split by space, so it's the list of string tokens\n            m = max frequency of any element in the array (as string)\n            r=0\n            while m < n:\n                ... \n\n          Then print(r)\n\n          This seems to be for the problem of creating a copy that is all equal? \n\n          But the problem we are solving now is the eating part, and we have program1.py that outputs the answer for each test case.\n\n          And we are to run: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n          That means program1.py outputs something, and program2.py reads from stdin and processes.\n\n          What does program1.py output? \n            It outputs, for each test case, an integer (the maximum total candies eaten).\n\n          Then program2.py reads from stdin: \n            It reads all lines from stdin: [*open(0)] \n            Then it takes every second line starting from index 2: [2::2] -> so it skips the first two lines? \n\n          The input to the whole program is the test cases.\n\n          The first line: t\n          Then for each test case:\n              first line: n\n              second line: the array\n\n          program1.py outputs for each test case one integer.\n\n          So the output of program1.py is t lines.\n\n          Then program2.py reads from stdin: \n            [*open(0)] will be the t lines of integers.\n\n          Then [2::2] would skip the first two lines? but there are only t lines.\n\n          This doesn't match.\n\n          Alternatively, program2.py might be intended to do something else.\n\n          The problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n          What is the overall output? \n            The problem output specification: For each test case, output a single integer.\n\n          So the entire pipeline should output t integers.\n\n          program1.py outputs t integers.\n\n          Then program2.py reads from stdin and outputs something.\n\n          But if program2.py is:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n             n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n             while m<n:\n                 ...\n             print(r)\n\n          This expects the input to be an array of strings? but the input to program2.py is integers.\n\n          And [2::2] would skip the first two lines? \n\n          How many lines does program1.py output? t lines.\n\n          Then [*open(0)] for program2.py is a list of t lines.\n\n          Then [2::2] would take lines at index 2, 4, 6, ... -> if there are at least 3 lines, but if t<2, then it takes nothing.\n\n          This is not what we want.\n\n          Perhaps program2.py is intended to do nothing? \n\n          But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\".\n\n          The TODO is inside a while loop: while m<n: ...\n\n          And then print(r).\n\n          What could it be doing? \n\n          Given the context, it might be that the overall problem is not solved by program1.py alone, but we have to pipe to program2.py.\n\n          But the description: program1.py is for the eating part and outputs the total candies eaten for each test case, and then program2.py might be doing nothing? \n\n          Or perhaps the problem has two parts and we are given two incomplete programs.\n\n          Let me read the problem again: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n          And then: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n          And the output format: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n          We have two programs to complete.\n\n          But the problem has only one output (the maximum total candies eaten for each test case).\n\n          How can program2.py be involved? \n\n          One possibility: program1.py does not output the answer for the test case, but something else, and program2.py converts it to the answer.\n\n          But the problem says: \"For each test case, print a single integer\"\n\n          And the example: \n            first test case: 2 (according to the note, but our program1.py outputs 4) -> but the example note says the answer is 2 for the first test case.\n\n          This is still a discrepancy.\n\n          Another possibility: the problem has two different problems and we are to complete both.\n\n          But the description is one problem.\n\n          Given the complexity, and the fact that the provided program1.py template matches the eating part, and the note says the answer for the first test case is 2, but our program1.py would output 4, we must reconsider the eating part.\n\n          The key: Alice and Bob eat in one move: \n            Alice eats from the left only once, and Bob eats from the right only once. \n            They choose a partition: Alice eats a prefix of length i and Bob eats a suffix of length j, and they must be disjoint: i+j <= n.\n            And the sum of the prefix = sum of the suffix.\n\n          Then the total candies eaten = i+j.\n\n          We maximize i+j.\n\n          In the first test case: \n            prefix of length 1: [5] -> sum=5\n            suffix of length 1: [5] -> sum=5 -> total=2.\n            prefix of length 2: [5,5] -> sum=10\n            suffix of length 2: [5,5] -> sum=10 -> total=4.\n            so the maximum is 4.\n\n          The example note says: \"There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight\" -> but 4 is better.\n\n          Unless the note has a mistake.\n\n          Or the problem is: they eat in turns, one candy at a time, until the total weight eaten by Alice and Bob are equal. \n          In the first test case: \n            Alice eats the first candy: Alice=5, Bob=0 -> not equal.\n            Bob eats the last candy: Alice=5, Bob=5 -> equal, total candies=2.\n            If they continue:\n               Alice eats the next candy (second from left): Alice=10, Bob=5 -> not equal.\n               Bob eats the next candy (second from right): Alice=10, Bob=10 -> equal, total=4.\n            So they can achieve 4.\n\n          The problem: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" -> so she can eat more than one at a time.\n\n          Therefore, the answer for the first test case should be 4.\n\n          So the example note has a mistake in the first test case explanation.\n\n          Given that, we complete program1.py as above.\n\n          What about program2.py? \n\n          The code in program2.py:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n             n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n             while m<n: \n                 # TODO \n             print(r)\n\n          This is for the other approach: creating a copy that is all equal.\n\n          But the problem we are to solve is the eating part.\n\n          The overall command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n          program1.py outputs the maximum total candies eaten for each test case.\n\n          Then program2.py reads that as stdin.\n\n          What could program2.py be doing? \n            It is taking every second line starting from index 2. \n            The stdin to program2.py is the output of program1.py: which is one integer per test case.\n\n          For example, for t=4, the output of program1.py is:\n\n            4\n            6\n            0\n            7\n\n          Then [*open(0)] = ['4\\n','6\\n','0\\n','7\\n']\n          [2::2] = ['0\\n']   (index2: the third line, then step by 2 -> only one line)\n\n          Then for a in ['0\\n']: \n             a = '0\\n'\n             n = len(a.split()) = len(['0']) = 1.\n             m = max(Counter(['0']).values()) = 1.\n             r=0\n             while 1<1: false, so r=0.\n             print(0)\n\n          This outputs 0.\n\n          But we want to output the answers: 4,6,0,7.\n\n          This doesn't match.\n\n          Perhaps program2.py is not modified? \n\n          Given the provided code in program2.py, and the TODO inside a while loop, it is likely that program2.py is for the creating part.\n\n          But the problem has two different problems? \n\n          The description: \n            \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\"\n\n          And then one description.\n\n          But then two programs.\n\n          I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n          However, the problem says: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\"\n\n          and then the code for program1.py and program2.py.\n\n          And the command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n          program1.py might be outputting the array for each test case? \n\n          But the given program1.py reads the test cases and then has a TODO in the eating part.\n\n          program2.py has a TODO in the creating part.\n\n          And the overall output should be the answer for the creating part? \n\n          But the problem output specification is for the eating part.\n\n          Given the time, and the sample, I think we are to complete program1.py for the eating part and program2.py for the creating part.\n\n          Then the command: program1.py outputs the intermediate result (the array for each test case) and program2.py reads that and solves the creating part.\n\n          But the creating part has a different output.\n\n          The creating part output: the minimal number of operations to create a copy that is all equal.\n\n          The eating part output: the maximum total candies eaten.\n\n          The problem's output specification is for the eating part.\n\n          This is very confusing.\n\n          Since the problem says the output is the maximum total candies eaten, and program1.py is for the eating part, and program2.py might be a placeholder, we might only need to complete program1.py and leave program2.py as a simple copy.\n\n          But the TODO in program2.py is in a while loop.\n\n          Another possibility: program2.py is not needed for the eating part, but for the creating part, and the overall problem has two parts.\n\n          But the problem description is one.\n\n          Given the provided code for program2.py, and the while loop, it might be for the creating part. \n\n          Recall the creating part: \n            For a fixed x, total_ops = (ceil(n/f_x) - 1) + (n - f_x)\n            Then we minimize over x.\n\n          In the code for program2.py:\n\n            for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n = len(a)   # a is the list of string tokens of the array, so n is the length of the array.\n                m = max frequency of any element in the array.\n                r = 0\n                while m < n:\n                    # TODO\n\n          This loops while the max frequency is less than n.\n\n          In the creating part, we know that if m==n, then we don't need any operations: r=0.\n\n          Otherwise, we need to do something.\n\n          The creating part formula: \n            total_ops = ceil(n/m) - 1 + (n - m)   [if we choose x to be the element with frequency m]\n\n          But wait, we minimize over x, so we choose the x with the highest frequency to minimize the operations.\n\n          So for the array, we let m = max frequency.\n\n          Then the minimal operations = ceil(n/m) - 1 + (n - m)\n\n          But note: ceil(n/m) = (n+m-1)//m   if we use integer ceil.\n\n          However, the while loop in program2.py: \n            while m < n:\n                ...\n\n          This will loop until m>=n, which only happens if m==n, but then we skip the loop.\n\n          So the while loop might be for simulation? \n\n          But the creating part has a closed-form.\n\n          Perhaps the while loop is not needed.\n\n          We can simply compute: \n            if m==n: \n                r=0\n            else:\n                r = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + (n - m)\n\n          But then we don't need the while loop.\n\n          Example: \n            first test case: [5,5,5,5] -> n=4, m=4 -> r=0.\n            second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (0 and 3 appear twice) -> \n                r = ceil(6/2)-1 + (6-2) = 3-1+4 = 6.\n            third test case: [1000000000] -> n=1, m=1 -> r=0.\n            fourth test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1] (n=8) -> m=2 (0,1,3 appear twice) -> \n                r = ceil(8/2)-1 + (8-2) = 4-1+6 = 9.\n            but the creating part note for the fourth test case says the answer is 7.\n\n          What is the array for the fourth test case in the creating part? \n            The creating part note: \n                \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n            -> array = [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] (n=7), and the frequency: \n                7:1, 3:1, 20:1, 10:1, 8:1, 11:1, 1:1 -> m=1.\n                r = ceil(7/1)-1 + (7-1) = 7-1+6 = 12.\n\n          But the creating part note says the answer is 7 operations.\n\n          So the array for the creating part fourth test case is not [0,1,3,3,7,0,2,1] but the one with sum 60.\n\n          How to compute for [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] (n=7) for the creating part: \n            We choose x to be the element that minimizes ceil(n/f_x)-1 + (n - f_x).\n            f_x for any x is 1.\n            ceil(7/1)-1 + (7-1) = 7-1+6 = 12.\n\n          But the note says 7.\n\n          This indicates that the creating part might have a different approach.\n\n          Given the time, and since the problem asks for the eating part in the output, and we have to complete program1.py for the eating part, and the program2.py might be for the creating part but the output of the pipeline should be the eating part, I think we are to complete program1.py and leave program2.py as a simple identity (output"
