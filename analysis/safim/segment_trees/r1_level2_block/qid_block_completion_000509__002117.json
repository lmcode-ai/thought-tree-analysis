Alternatively, we can use the following property:\n\n          b_{i,j} = b_{i-1,j} XOR b_{i,j-1}\n\n          This is similar to the grid XOR from the first row and first column. In fact, we know the first column: b_{i,0}=0 for all i, and the first row: b_{0,j}=a_j for j>=1. Then we can compute any cell. But we only know the last column.

Alternatively, we can use the following known result for this grid XOR:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} C(j, i-k) mod 2 * a_{k}   ? But I recall that in a similar problem (CodeForces), the transformation is:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k} a_{k}   for k such that the path from (0,k) to (i,j) has a combinatorial condition.",

After research, there is a known problem: \"Spyofgame\" and the solution is to use the following recurrence in reverse:\n\n      We are given: \n          b_{i,n} for i=1.. n.

(1)\n\n          b_{i-1,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i,j}   ... (2)\n\n      And also:\n\n          b_{i-1,j} = b_{i-1,j+1} XOR b_{i-2,j+1}   ? But we only know the last column (j=n).

However, in our example: \n          Input: n=3, a = [0,2,1]   (which is b1,3, b2,3, b3,3)\n\n      We want to output [1,2,3]. Let's simulate for k=0 and then k=1. k=0: i from 0 to 18 (but 19 iterations, but i=0,1,...18; for n=3, i only needs to go to 2 because 2^2=4>3)\n          i=0: 1<<0 = 1.\n          j=0: l = 0^1 = 1. Condition: k=0, so condition: 0^(l<j) = 0^(1<0) = 0^0 = 0 -> false? (because 1<0 is false) -> skip. j=1: l=1^1=0. Condition: 0^(0<1) = 0^1 = 1 -> true. Then if k==0: a[1] ^= a[0] -> a[1] = 2 ^ 0 = 2.\n          j=2: l=2^1=3. 3>=n? -> skip. i=1: 1<<1=2.\n          j=0: l=0^2=2. Condition: 0^(2<0)=0^0=0 -> false. j=1: l=1^2=3 -> skip.\n          j=2: l=2^2=0. Condition: 0^(0<2)=0^1=1 -> true. Then a[2] ^= a[0] -> a[2]=1^0=1. After k=0: a = [0,2,1]\n\n      k=1:\n          i=0:\n             j=0: l=1 -> condition: 1^(1<0)=1^0=1 -> true. Then since k=1: a[l] (a[1]) ^= a[j] (a[0]) -> a[1]=2^0=2. j=1: l=0 -> condition: 1^(0<1)=1^1=0 -> false. j=2: l=3 -> skip. i=1:\n             j=0: l=2 -> condition: 1^(2<0)=1^0=1 -> true.

So a = [0,2,1]\n\n      Then the code prints: print(*reversed(a)) -> 1,2,0.\n\n      But expected [1,2,3] -> not matching. Another known solution (from a different user) for the same problem:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n          for j in range(20):\n              if (i >> j) & 1: k = i ^ (1 << j)\n                  a[k] = (a[k] - a[i]) % (1<<30)\n      print(' '.join(map(str, a))) But this is for a different problem. After checking, there is a known solution in C++ for the problem \"Spyofgame\" (problem name: \"Chiori and Strange Matrix\"):\n\n      #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n      using namespace std;\n      const int N = 1e6 + 5;\n      int n, a[N];\n      int main() {\n          scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", a + i);\n          for (int k = 0; k < 2; k++) {\n              for (int i = 0; i < 19; i++) {\n                  for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n                      int l = j ^ (1 << i);\n                      if (l < j) continue;\n                      if (l < n) {\n                          if (k == 0) { if (j >> i & 1) a[j] ^= a[l];\n                              else a[l] ^= a[j];\n                          } else {\n                              if (j >> i & 1) a[l] ^= a[j];\n                              else a[j] ^= a[l];\n                          }\n                      }\n                  }\n              }\n          }\n          for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) printf(\"%d \", a[i]);\n      } But this is not exactly the same as our TODO. Our condition: if k^(l<j) and l<n -> \n      In the above C++ code, they have: if (l < j) continue; then if (l < n) { ... } So they are skipping when l<j, and then when l>=j and l<n, they do the operation. In our condition: \n      if k^(l<j) and l<n\n\n  We can interpret: \n      if (l>=j) then l<j is false, so k^0 = k. \n      if (l<j) then l<j is true, so k^1. So the condition is: \n      if ( (k==0 and l>=j) or (k==1 and l<j) ) and l<n.\n\n  The known solution does: \n      if (l < j) continue;   -> so they only consider l>=j. then if (l<n) { ... }\n\n  So they are only doing the operation when l>=j and l<n.\n\n  Then in the TODO, they do:\n\n          if k==0:\n              if (j has the i-th bit set?): \n                  a[j] ^= a[l]\n              else:\n                  a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              if (j has the i-th bit set?):\n                  a[l] ^= a[j]\n              else:\n                  a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  But our TODO does not have the bit check on j.\n\n  The condition in the known solution is: \"if (j >> i & 1)\". So the TODO might be:\n\n          if k == 0: if j >> i & 1:\n                  a[j] ^= a[l]\n              else:\n                  a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else: if j >> i & 1:\n                  a[l] ^= a[j]\n              else:\n                  a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  But wait, the known solution in C++ does for k=0 and k=1 the same condition on j's bit? In the C++ code:\n\n      if (k == 0) {\n          if (j >> i & 1) a[j] ^= a[l];\n          else a[l] ^= a[j];\n      } else {\n          if (j >> i & 1) a[l] ^= a[j];\n          else a[j] ^= a[l];\n      }\n\n  But note: in the first pass (k=0) and second pass (k=1) the roles are swapped.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given n, q and a list of prices. We sort the prices in descending order and compute the prefix sums.\nFor each query (x, y), we note that the customer must purchase at least x items to get y cheapest for free. But note: the customer can choose which items to purchase. The goal is to maximize the total value of the free items.\n\nObservation:\nSince the free items are the y cheapest among the purchased items, the customer would want to have as many expensive items as possible in the purchase, but note that the free items are the cheapest ones. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to purchase exactly x items: the x most expensive items. Then the free items would be the y cheapest among these x, which are the last y items in the sorted list (which we sorted in descending order, so the cheapest are the last).\n\nBut note: we sorted in descending order: \n  a[0] is the most expensive, a[1] next, ... a[n-1] is the cheapest.\n\nSo if we take the top x items: they are a[0] to a[x-1]. The cheapest y items in this set are the last y: a[x-y] to a[x-1].\n\nTherefore, the total free value = sum of a[x-y] to a[x-1].\n\nWe have precomputed the prefix sum array p, where:\n  p[0] = 0\n  p[1] = a[0]\n  p[2] = a[0]+a[1]\n  ...\n  p[i] = a[0]+...+a[i-1]\n\nSo the sum from index l to r (inclusive) in the array a is p[r+1] - p[l].\n\nIn our case, we want the sum from index (x-y) to (x-1) (0-indexed). That is:\n  total = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\nBut note: our array a is sorted in descending order. So the free items are the smallest in the set, and we are summing the smallest y items.\n\nTherefore, for each query (x, y), we can compute:\n  result = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\nHowever, note the note in the example: \n  \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8.\"\nBut wait: the example input is not provided. However, the example note says:\n  Input: n=4, q=3, prices = [5,3,5,1] and queries: (3,2), (2,1), (4,3)\n\nLet's do:\n  Sort descending: [5,5,3,1]\n  For (3,2): take the top 3: [5,5,3]. The two cheapest are 5 and 3? But wait: 5 and 3? Actually, the two cheapest are 3 and 1? \n  But wait: we have [5,5,3] -> the two cheapest are 3 and the next cheapest? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and one of the 5s? \n  This is incorrect: the two smallest in [5,5,3] are 3 and 5? \n\nBut note: the example says the two cheapest are 3 and 5? That doesn't make sense because 3 is cheaper than 5. Actually, the example says: \"the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\". \n\nWait, the example input prices: [5,3,5,1] -> sorted descending: [5,5,3,1]. Then the top 3: [5,5,3]. The two cheapest are the last two: 5 and 3? But 5 is not cheaper than 5? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"y cheapest\". In case of ties, we take the smallest ones. So the two cheapest in [5,5,3] are 3 and 5? But 3 is the smallest, then the next smallest is 5 (because there are two 5s). \n\nBut note: the array we have is sorted descending. The last element in the selected set (which is the smallest) is a[2] = 3, and the next last is a[1]=5? \n\nActually, the set of top x items in descending order: \n  a[0]=5, a[1]=5, a[2]=3.\n\nThe two cheapest: we want the two smallest. The smallest is 3 (at index2) and the next smallest is 5 (at index1). So we take a[1] and a[2]? \n\nBut note: the prefix sum array p is:\n  p[0]=0\n  p[1]=5\n  p[2]=5+5=10\n  p[3]=10+3=13\n  p[4]=13+1=14\n\nFor (3,2): \n  We want the sum from index (3-2)=1 to index 2? \n  That is: a[1] + a[2] = 5+3 = 8 -> which matches.\n\nSo the formula: p[x] - p[x-y] = p[3] - p[1] = 13 - 5 = 8.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,1): \n  x=2, y=1 -> we take the top 2: [5,5]. The cheapest one is the last one: a[1]=5? \n  But wait: the two items are at indices0 and1. The last one is a[1]=5. \n  So we want the sum from index (2-1)=1 to 1? -> a[1] = 5.\n  p[2]-p[1] = 10-5 = 5.\n\nFor (4,3): \n  x=4, y=3 -> we take the entire set: [5,5,3,1]. The three cheapest: 5,3,1? \n  Actually, the three smallest: 1,3,5? \n  But note: we have to take the last three in the sorted descending array: \n      indices: 1,2,3 -> a[1]=5, a[2]=3, a[3]=1 -> sum=5+3+1=9? \n  But the example says 1+2+3=6? \n\nWait, the example note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\"\n\nBut our array is [5,5,3,1] -> the three cheapest are 1,3, and one of the 5s? \n\nWait, the example input prices: [5,3,5,1] -> the three cheapest are 1,3, and the next cheapest? Actually, the three smallest numbers are 1,3, and then 5? But there are two 5s. The three smallest are 1,3,5? \n\nBut the example says 1+2+3=6? \n\nThis implies that the original array of prices might have been [1,2,3,?] but the example input is [5,3,5,1]. \n\nLet me check the note: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\"\n\nThis note does not match the example input? \n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \n  \"The second line contains n integers p1, p2, ..., pn (1<=pi<=10^6), where pi \u2014 the price of the i-th item.\"\n\nAnd the example: \n  Input: \n      4 3\n      5 3 5 1\n      3 2\n      2 1\n      4 3\n\nSo the third query: x=4, y=3 -> the customer buys all 4 items. The three cheapest are the three smallest: 1, 3, and 5? But 5 appears twice. The three smallest distinct? No, we take the three smallest by value: \n  The prices: [1,3,5,5] -> sorted ascending: [1,3,5,5]. The three smallest: 1,3,5 -> sum=9? \n\nBut the example output for the third query is 6? \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nWait, the note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\"\n\nThis note is for a different example? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"NoteIn the first query ... second ... third ...\". \n\nSo the example input is:\n  n=3? q=3? \n  But the input says: first line \"4 3\", then the prices \"5 3 5 1\", then queries: (3,2), (2,1), (4,3).\n\nBut the note says: \n  first query: (3,2) -> 8\n  second: (2,1) -> 5\n  third: (4,3) -> 6\n\nBut with our method for the third: \n  We have the array sorted descending: [5,5,3,1] -> take the entire array. The three cheapest: the last three: [5,3,1] -> sum=5+3+1=9.\n\nBut the example output for the third query is 6? \n\nThis indicates that the example note might be for a different set of prices? \n\nLooking at the note: \n  \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\"\n\nThis implies that the prices of the three cheapest are 1,2,3. So the entire set must be at least 4 items: one of which is 1,2,3 and then one more. \n\nBut the example input for the third query is for n=4 and the prices are [5,3,5,1]. \n\nSo the three cheapest are 1,3, and then the next smallest? The next smallest is 3? but 3 is already taken? or 5? \n\nThe problem does not say distinct. The three smallest in [5,3,5,1] are 1,3, and then 3? but there is only one 3. Then the next is 5? \n\nWait, the array sorted ascending: [1,3,5,5] -> the three smallest are 1,3,5? \n\nBut the example note says 1+2+3=6. \n\nThis suggests that the example note is for a different test case? \n\nLet me read the problem again: \n  \"NoteIn the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5, the two cheapest of them are 3 + 5 = 8. In the second query, a customer can buy two items worth 5 and 5, the cheapest of them is 5. In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\"\n\nThe third query: the items are 1,2,3 and then what? The problem says the store has n items. The third query says \"a customer has to buy all the items\", meaning the store has 4 items? because the free condition is at least 4 items? and the customer buys 4? but then the three cheapest are 1,2,3? so the fourth item must be at least 3? \n\nBut the example input for the third query is (4,3) and the prices are [5,3,5,1]. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"The following q lines contain two integers x_i and y_i each (1<=y_i<=x_i<=n)\".\n\nIn the example, the third query is (4,3) and n=4. \n\nBut the example output for the third query is 6? \n\nBut our calculation for the example input [5,3,5,1] for (4,3) is 9. \n\nThis implies that the example note is for a different set of prices? \n\nLooking at the note: \n  First query: (3,2) -> 8: which matches our calculation for [5,3,5,1] -> 8.\n  Second: (2,1) -> 5: matches.\n  Third: (4,3) -> 6: but we get 9.\n\nBut the note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\"\n\nThis suggests that the array of prices for the third example is [1,2,3,?] but the problem says the input is the same for all queries. \n\nThe problem says: \"The second line contains n integers p1, p2, ..., pn\"\n\nSo the same array for all queries. \n\nTherefore, the example input is fixed: [5,3,5,1]. \n\nBut then the third query output should be 9? \n\nBut the example note says 6. \n\nThis is a discrepancy. \n\nI see: the problem note says: \"Note\" and then gives three examples. The examples might be independent? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"NoteIn the first query ... second ... third ...\". \n\nSo the entire note is for one input: \n  n=4, q=3, prices = [5,3,5,1] and queries: (3,2), (2,1), (4,3)\n\nBut then the third query output is 6? \n\nThis is a contradiction. \n\nAlternatively, the example note might have a typo? \n\nLooking at the sample output: \n  The example says: \n      first query: 8\n      second: 5\n      third: 6\n\nBut our calculation: \n  first: 8 -> matches\n  second: 5 -> matches\n  third: 9 -> does not match.\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"the three cheapest of them\" in the third query. \n\nWhat if the customer does not have to take the entire set? The problem says: \"if a customer purchases at least x items\". So for x=4, the customer must purchase at least 4 items. Since there are only 4 items, the customer must purchase all. \n\nBut what if the customer can choose which 4 items? There are only 4. \n\nSo the free items are the three cheapest of the four. \n\nBut the three cheapest of [5,3,5,1] are 1,3, and then the next smallest? The next smallest is 3? but there is only one 3. Then the next is 5? \n\nSo the three smallest: 1,3,5 -> 1+3+5=9.\n\nBut the example note says 6. \n\nAlternatively, the example note might be for a different set of prices? \n\nThe problem says: \"Note\" and then the example. \n\nI see: the note says: \"In the first query, ... In the second query, ... In the third query, ...\" and then the example input is provided? \n\nBut the example input is provided in the problem? \n\nActually, the problem input specification: \n  The first line contains two integers n and q ...\n  The second line contains n integers ...\n\nSo the example input is: \n  4 3\n  5 3 5 1\n  3 2\n  2 1\n  4 3\n\nAnd the expected output is:\n  8\n  5\n  6\n\nBut 6 for the third? \n\nThis means our reasoning is flawed.\n\nAlternative reasoning:\n  The customer can choose any set of at least x items. So for the third query (x=4, y=3), the customer must buy at least 4 items. Since there are only 4, the customer buys all. Then the free items are the 3 cheapest. \n\n  But note: the problem says \"y cheapest of them are free\". The cheapest 3: \n      The prices: [1,3,5,5] -> sorted ascending: [1,3,5,5] -> the three cheapest: 1,3,5 -> 9.\n\n  However, the example output is 6.\n\n  This suggests that the example note is for a different test case? \n\n  The note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\"\n\n  This implies that the array of prices for the third example is [1,2,3,?] and the ? is at least 3? \n\n  But the problem says the same array for all queries.\n\n  Therefore, the example input must be different? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"Note\" and then the example. It might be a separate example? \n\n  The problem says: \"Note\" and then the example input and output. \n\n  The first example: \n      Input: \n          n=4, q=3, prices = [5,3,5,1], queries: (3,2), (2,1), (4,3)\n      Output: \n          8\n          5\n          6\n\n  But wait, the third query output is 6? \n\n  How can that be? \n\n  I see: the problem says \"Note\" and then the example. The example might be illustrating the rules with a different set of prices? \n\n  The note says: \"In the first query ...\" and then describes a purchase of three items: 5,3,5. But in the input we have 5,3,5,1. The customer does not have to buy the entire stock? \n\n  For the first query (x=3,y=2): the customer can choose any 3 items. The customer chooses the three most expensive: 5,5,3 -> free: 5+3=8? \n\n  But the customer might choose differently? \n\n  What if the customer chooses 5,5,1? Then the two cheapest are 1 and 5? -> 1+5=6? which is worse.\n\n  What if the customer chooses 5,3,1? Then the two cheapest are 1 and 3 -> 4? \n\n  So the best is 8.\n\n  For the third query: the customer must buy at least 4 items -> all. Then the three cheapest are 1,3, and then the next is 5? -> 1+3+5=9.\n\n  But the example output is 6.\n\n  This is a mystery.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might have a different interpretation: \n      \"the maximum total value of items received for free\"\n\n  But note: the free items are the y cheapest. So we want to maximize the free items? \n\n  However, the customer's goal is to maximize the free items? \n\n  But the store's goal in the query is to determine the maximum total value of free items that a customer can get? \n\n  The problem says: \"determine the maximum total value of items received for free\"\n\n  So the customer will try to choose a set of at least x items such that the sum of the y cheapest in that set is as large as possible.\n\n  In the third query: \n      The customer must buy at least 4 items -> only one set: the entire set. \n      Then the free items are the three cheapest: 1,3,5 -> 9.\n\n  But the example output is 6.\n\n  This suggests that the example note is for a different test case. \n\n  The note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\"\n\n  This implies that the array of prices for that example is [1,2,3,?] and the ? is at least 3, but the free items are 1,2,3 -> 6.\n\n  So the example input for the third query in the note is not the same as the provided input? \n\n  The problem says: \"Note\" and then the example. It is a separate example. \n\n  Therefore, we must trust the method: \n      We sort the prices in descending order.\n      We take the top x items (the x most expensive) because including a cheaper item would only reduce the value of the free items? \n\n  But wait: what if we include a very expensive item and also include some medium items? The free items are the y cheapest, so if we include a very expensive item and then some medium items, the free items might be the medium items and not the very expensive one? \n\n  However, the free items are the cheapest ones, so we want to avoid having very cheap items in the set. \n\n  The optimal strategy is to take the x most expensive items. Why?\n      Because if we replace any item in the set with a more expensive one, then the set becomes more expensive overall, but note: the free items are the cheapest ones. The cheapest ones in the set might become more expensive if we remove a cheap item and add an expensive one.\n\n  Example: \n      [10,5,1] and x=2, y=1.\n        Option1: take [10,5] -> free: min=5.\n        Option2: take [10,1] -> free: min=1 -> worse.\n        Option3: take [5,1] -> free: min=1 -> worse.\n\n      So the best is to take the two most expensive.\n\n  Another: \n      [10,5,1] and x=2, y=2: \n        We get the two cheapest in the set. \n        Option1: [10,5] -> free: 5+10? -> no, the two cheapest: 5 and 10? -> but 5 is the smallest, then 10? -> but wait, the two cheapest are the two smallest: 5 and 10? -> no, the two smallest in [10,5] are 5 and 10? -> but 5<10, so the free items are 5 and 10? -> that doesn't make sense.\n\n  Actually, the free items are the y cheapest, meaning the smallest ones. In [10,5] the two smallest are 5 and 10? -> but 5 is the smallest and 10 is the next smallest? -> then free items: 5+10=15.\n\n  But wait, that would be the entire set? \n\n  The problem says: \"y cheapest of them are free\", so the customer pays for the remaining (x-y) items. \n\n  In this case, the customer would pay for 0 items? \n\n  But the free items are the two cheapest, and there are only two items, so both are free? \n\n  So the free value is 5+10=15.\n\n  But if we take [10,1]: free items: 1 and 10 -> 11.\n  And [5,1]: free items: 1 and 5 -> 6.\n\n  So the best is 15.\n\n  Now, if we take the two most expensive: [10,5] -> free=15.\n\n  What if we take three items? \n      The customer can take at least 2, so taking 3 is allowed? \n      But the problem says: at least x items, and x=2. So the customer can take 3 items? \n      Then the free items are the 2 cheapest in the set of 3.\n\n  If we take [10,5,1]: the two cheapest are 1 and 5 -> 6.\n\n  So 6<15, so the customer would prefer the set of two items.\n\n  Therefore, the customer is not forced to take more than x items. The customer can take exactly x items.\n\n  So the optimal strategy is to take exactly the x most expensive items.\n\n  But then why in the third query of the example input the answer is 6? \n\n  I see: the example input for the third query is (4,3) and the array is [5,3,5,1]. \n      The customer must take at least 4 items -> only the entire set. \n      The free items are the three cheapest: 1,3, and then the next cheapest is 5? -> 1+3+5=9.\n\n  But the example output is 6.\n\n  This suggests that the example output in the problem's note is for a different array. \n\n  The problem's note says: \n      \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6.\"\n\n  This implies that the array for that example is [1,2,3, ...] but the ... is not specified. \n\n  And the three cheapest are 1,2,3 -> 6.\n\n  So the example input for the third query in the note is not the same as the first example input. \n\n  Therefore, we trust our method: \n      Sort the array in descending order.\n      Precompute prefix sums p[0..n] (0-indexed, p[0]=0, p[i]=a[0]+...+a[i-1])\n      For a query (x,y): \n          result = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n  And for the example input [5,3,5,1] and query (4,3): \n      sorted descending: [5,5,3,1]\n      p[0]=0, p[1]=5, p[2]=10, p[3]=13, p[4]=14\n      result = p[4]-p[1] = 14-5 = 9.\n\n  But the example output for the third query is 6.\n\n  This indicates that the example output in the problem's note might be for a different test case. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Note\" and then the example. It is a unified example. \n\n  After re-examining the problem statement: \n      \"NoteIn the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5, the two cheapest of them are 3 + 5 = 8.\"\n\n  This matches our calculation for the first query: 8.\n\n  \"In the second query, a customer can buy two items worth 5 and 5, the cheapest of them is 5.\"\n\n  This matches: 5.\n\n  \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\"\n\n  This does not match the array [5,3,5,1] because there is no 2. \n\n  Therefore, the array for the third query in the note is different. \n\n  The problem says: \"the store sells n items\", and then the input has n items. \n\n  In the note, the first query uses three items: 5,3,5 -> so the store has at least three items. The second query uses two of the 5's. The third query says \"all the items\", so the store has more than three? \n\n  But the input says n=4. \n\n  And the prices are 5,3,5,1. \n\n  There is no 2. \n\n  This is a discrepancy in the problem statement. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Note\" and then the example. It is common for notes to have a self-contained example. \n\n  Therefore, the note is for a different instance: \n      n=4, but the prices are not [5,3,5,1] but [ something else ].\n\n  In fact, the note says: \n      first query: buys three items: 5,3,5 -> so the array must have at least three items: 5,3,5.\n      second query: buys two items: 5,5 -> so the array must have at least two 5's.\n      third query: buys all items -> and the three cheapest are 1,2,3 -> so the array must have 1,2,3 and at least one more item (which is not specified).\n\n  So the array for the note example might be [1,2,3,5] or [1,2,3,4]? \n\n  Let's assume the array is [1,2,3,4] for the note example. \n      Then for the third query: x=4, y=3: \n          sorted descending: [4,3,2,1]\n          take the entire set: [4,3,2,1]\n          the three cheapest: 1,2,3 -> sum=6.\n\n  So the example output is 6.\n\n  Therefore, the note example uses a different array: [1,2,3,4] for the third query? \n\n  But the first query in the note: buys three items: 5,3,5 -> which are not in [1,2,3,4]. \n\n  This suggests that the note is not a single instance. \n\n  The problem says: \"Note\" and then three independent examples. \n\n  So we should not use the note as a single instance. \n\n  Conclusion: \n      For program1.py, we do:\n          sort the prices in descending order\n          compute prefix sums p[0..n] (0-indexed, p[0]=0, p[i]=p[i-1]+a[i-1] for i>=1)\n          for each query (x,y):\n              print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n  But note: the constraints: n,q up to 200000 -> we must do each query in O(1).\n\n  We have precomputed the prefix sum, so it is O(1) per query.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n      x, y = R()   # read the query\n      result = p[x] - p[x-y]\n      print(result)\n\n  However, the code already has:\n      for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We need to read x and y, then compute and print.\n\n  But note: the array a is sorted in descending order, and we have the prefix sum array p.\n\n  So:\n\n      for _ in range(q):\n          x, y = R()\n          # We have an array a of n items, sorted descending.\n          # We want the sum of the y items from the set of the top x items: which are the last y in the top x segment.\n          # In the array a[0:x], the last y items: indices from x-y to x-1.\n          # But our prefix sum p is defined for the entire array a (which is sorted descending).\n\n          # Therefore: \n          ans = p[x] - p[x-y]\n          print(ans)\n\n  However, note: the prefix sum p is defined as:\n        p[0] = 0\n        p[1] = a[0]\n        p[2] = a[0]+a[1]\n        ...\n        p[x] = a[0]+...+a[x-1]\n\n      and we want a[x-y] + ... + a[x-1] = (a[0]+...+a[x-1]) - (a[0]+...+a[x-y-1]) = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n  So it is correct.\n\n  But note: what if x-y is 0? \n      p[0]=0, so it works.\n\n  Example: x=1, y=1: \n      ans = p[1]-p[0] = a[0] - 0 = a[0] -> correct.\n\n  Therefore, we write:\n\n      for _ in range(q):\n          x, y = R()\n          print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n  However, the problem says: the customer can choose any set of at least x items. But we assumed taking exactly the top x items is optimal. \n\n  Why is that optimal? \n      Because if we take more than x items, then we are including some cheaper items. The free items are the y cheapest. The y cheapest in a set that includes more items might be even cheaper than the y cheapest in the top x. \n\n      For example: \n          [10,8,5,1] \n          Query: x=3, y=2.\n          Option1: take the top 3: [10,8,5] -> free: 5+8 = 13? (the two cheapest: 5 and 8) -> 13.\n          Option2: take all 4: [10,8,5,1] -> free: the two cheapest: 1 and 5 -> 6.\n\n      So taking more than x items might reduce the free value.\n\n      But what if we take more than x items but avoid the very cheap ones? \n          We cannot avoid the very cheap ones if we take more than x because the only items available are the ones we have. \n\n      However, we are allowed to choose any set of at least x items. \n\n          Option3: take [10,8,1] -> free: 1 and 8 -> 9 -> worse than 13.\n\n          Option4: take [10,5,1] -> free: 1 and 5 -> 6.\n\n          Option5: take [8,5,1] -> free: 1 and 5 -> 6.\n\n      So the best is 13.\n\n      Therefore, taking the top x items is optimal.\n\n  Why? \n      The free items are the y cheapest in the set. To maximize the free items, we want the y cheapest to be as large as possible. \n      We can control the set. We want to avoid including very cheap items. \n      The best way is to take the x most expensive items. Then the y cheapest in that set will be the smallest among the top x, which are the largest available items that are not too small.\n\n      If we include an item that is not in the top x, then we are including an item that is at most the x-th largest. But then we might push one of the free items to be this new item or even a smaller one? \n\n      Specifically, if we include an item that is cheaper than the (x-y+1)-th largest item, then that new item will be one of the free items, and it might be cheaper than the item that was the (x-y+1)-th largest (which would have been the smallest in the top x). \n\n      Therefore, it can only reduce the sum of the free items.\n\n      So the optimal is to take exactly the top x items.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n      from itertools import accumulate\n      I=input;R=lambda:map(int,I().split())\n      n,q=R();a=sorted(R())[::-1];p=[0]+list(accumulate(a))\n      for _ in range(q):\n          x,y=R()\n          print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n  But note: the array a is sorted in descending order. The prefix sum p is computed on that descending array.\n\n  However, the problem says: the customer can choose any set. But we are assuming that the top x items are the best. \n\n  This is a known problem: \"Free Items\" in promotions. \n\n  We are confident.\n\n  But note: the constraints: n,q up to 200000. The above code runs in O(n) for reading and O(q) for queries, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the for-loop body.\n\n  But the current code has:\n      for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We must replace the TODO with:\n\n          x,y=R()\n          print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  And the output format is: \n      {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n  So for program1, we output the string that completes the for loop.\n\n  However, the for loop body is two lines? \n\n  But the problem says: the missing lines or blocks.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      \"x,y=R()\\n  print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n\n  But note: the existing code has the for loop and the TODO. We are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write it as a single block? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n  We are missing two lines.\n\n  Now, for program2.py:\n\n  The code given:\n\n      a=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n      n=len(a)\n      for k in 0,1:\n          for i in range(19):\n              for j in range(n):\n                  l=j^1<<i\n                  if k^(l<j)and l<n:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n      print(*reversed(a))\n\n  We are to complete the TODO.\n\n  Problem description: \n      We are given n and then an array b of n integers: b1,n, b2,n, ..., bn,n.\n      We are to reconstruct an array a[1..n] such that if we build the matrix b as described, then the last column (for rows 1..n) equals the input.\n\n      The matrix b is defined by:\n          b_{i,0} = 0 for all i in [0, n]\n          b_{0,j} = a_j for j in [1, n]   (note: the problem says b_{0,i}=a_i for 1<=i<=n, so the first row (row0) from column1 to columnn is a[1..n])\n          b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j} for i,j>=1.\n\n      We are told that the archaeologists only know the values b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ..., b_{n,n}.\n\n      We are given the array a in the code is actually the array of b_{i,n} for i=1..n? \n\n      But the code reads:\n          a=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n          n=len(a)\n\n      So the array a is the last column (without the element at row0, because the input is for rows 1 to n).\n\n      The goal: output any array a (which is the first row: a1, a2, ..., an) that is consistent, or -1 if none.\n\n      The code then does:\n          for k in 0,1:\n              for i in range(19):   # 19 because 2^30, so 30 bits? but 19 is about 2^19? actually 2^19 is about 500000, and n<=500000, but 19 is the number of bits? 2^19 is 524288, which is >500000, so 19 bits are enough? \n                  for j in range(n):\n                      l = j ^ (1<<i)\n                      if k^(l<j) and l<n:\n                          # TODO\n\n          then prints: print(*reversed(a))\n\n      And the note: the example input: \n          n=3, and the last column: [0,2,1] -> which is b_{1,3}=0, b_{2,3}=2, b_{3,3}=1.\n\n      The example output: a = [1,2,3] -> but the code prints reversed(a) -> so it would print 3 2 1? \n\n      But the example output is 1 2 3.\n\n      Therefore, the code is reconstructing the array a in reverse order? \n\n      Actually, the code prints: print(*reversed(a)) -> so if we want the output to be [1,2,3], then the array a at the end should be [3,2,1].\n\n      But the problem says: output a1, a2, a3.\n\n      How is the matrix built?\n          We know:\n            b00 = 0, b01 = a1, b02 = a2, b03 = a3.\n            b10 = 0, b11 = b10 XOR b01 = 0 XOR a1 = a1.\n            b12 = b11 XOR b02 = a1 XOR a2.\n            b13 = b12 XOR b03 = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3.\n\n            b20 = 0, b21 = b20 XOR b11 = 0 XOR a1 = a1.\n            b22 = b21 XOR b12 = a1 XOR (a1 XOR a2) = a2.\n            b23 = b22 XOR b13 = a2 XOR (a1 XOR a2 XOR a3) = a1 XOR a3.\n\n            b30 = 0, b31 = b30 XOR b21 = a1.\n            b32 = b31 XOR b22 = a1 XOR a2.\n            b33 = b32 XOR b23 = (a1 XOR a2) XOR (a1 XOR a3) = a2 XOR a3.\n\n          The last column: \n            b13 = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3\n            b23 = a1 XOR a3\n            b33 = a2 XOR a3\n\n          The input: [0,2,1] -> \n            a1 XOR a2 XOR a3 = 0\n            a1 XOR a3 = 2\n            a2 XOR a3 = 1\n\n          We can solve: \n            From the first: a1 XOR a2 XOR a3 = 0 -> a1 = a2 XOR a3.\n            Then the second: a1 XOR a3 = (a2 XOR a3) XOR a3 = a2 = 2 -> so a2=2.\n            Then the third: a2 XOR a3 = 2 XOR a3 = 1 -> a3 = 1 XOR 2 = 3.\n            Then a1 = a2 XOR a3 = 2 XOR 3 = 1.\n\n          So a = [1,2,3].\n\n      But the code prints reversed(a) -> so if we have a = [1,2,3] at the end, then reversed(a) is [3,2,1] -> which is not [1,2,3].\n\n      Therefore, the code is using the array a for the last column? and then we are going to reconstruct the first row? \n\n      The variable a in the code is the last column: [b1,n, b2,n, ..., bn,n].\n\n      And we are going to reconstruct the first row: [a1, a2, ..., an] and then output it.\n\n      But the code prints reversed(a) -> so if we reconstruct the first row in the array a, then we output reversed(a) -> which is an, an-1, ... a1.\n\n      But the problem says: output a1, a2, ..., an.\n\n      So we must have the array a at the end as [an, an-1, ..., a1] so that when we reverse we get a1, a2, ... an.\n\n      Alternatively, the reconstruction might be done in reverse order.\n\n      How does the triple loop work?\n\n      The known relations:\n\n      We have the recurrence:\n          b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n      We are given: for i from 1 to n: b_{i,n} = a[i-1] (the array a we read).\n\n      We wish to find the first row: b_{0,1}, b_{0,2}, ... b_{0,n} = a1, a2, ... an.\n\n      Note: the recurrence can be written in terms of the first row and the last column? \n\n      There is a known solution: \n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} binom(i,j-k) is not straightforward.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the following property:\n\n          b_{i,j} = b_{i-1,j} XOR b_{i,j-1}\n\n          This is similar to the grid XOR from the first row and first column.\n\n      In fact, we know the first column: b_{i,0}=0 for all i, and the first row: b_{0,j}=a_j for j>=1.\n\n      Then we can compute any cell. But we only know the last column.\n\n      There is a combinatorial formula:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{j} C(i, j-k) mod 2 * a_{k+1}   ?\n\n      But note: the recurrence is linear. We can write:\n\n          b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n          This is the same as:\n\n          b_{i,j} = (XOR_{k=0}^{j-1} ? ) \n\n      Actually, it is known that:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{x=0}^{i} XOR_{y=0}^{j} [some condition] * b_{0,?} \n\n      But note the base: \n          b_{0,y} = a_y (for y>=1) and b_{x,0}=0.\n\n      We can use the following:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} C(i+j-k-1, i-k) mod 2 * a_{j} ??? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use the following known result for this grid XOR:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} C(j, i-k) mod 2 * a_{k}   ?\n\n      But I recall that in a similar problem (CodeForces), the transformation is:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k} a_{k}   for k such that the path from (0,k) to (i,j) has a combinatorial condition.\n\n      Specifically, the number of paths from (0,k) to (i,j) is C(i+j-k, i) mod 2? \n\n      Actually, the recurrence is:\n\n          b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n          This is the same as the XOR over the path from the first row and first column. But the first column is 0, so only the first row matters.\n\n          And the value at (i,j) is the XOR of the values a_{k} for which the number of paths from (0,k) to (i,j) is odd.\n\n          The number of paths from (0,k) to (i,j) is C(i+j-k, i) if k<=j, and 0 otherwise.\n\n          And we care about mod 2: by Lucas, C(n,k) mod 2 is 1 if and only if the binary representation of k is a subset of n.\n\n      But note: the grid has (0,k) to (i,j): \n          We move right and down? \n          From (0,k) to (i,j): we need to move down i times and right (j-k) times? \n          But we cannot go left. So k must be <= j.\n\n          The number of paths: C(i + (j-k), i) = C(i+j-k, i).\n\n          So:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k: k<=j and (i+j-k) choose i is odd} a_{k}\n\n      In particular, for the last column j = n:\n\n            b_{i,n} = XOR_{k: k<=n and (i+n-k) choose i is odd} a_{k}\n\n      We are given b_{i,n} for i=1..n.\n\n      We wish to find a[1..n] (which is a1,...,an).\n\n      This is a linear system. \n\n      But note: the matrix of the system is the incidence matrix of the combinatorial coefficients mod 2.\n\n      And the system is:\n\n          For i from 1 to n:\n              b_{i,n} = XOR_{k=0}^{n} [ if (i+n-k) choose i is odd and k<=n ] a_k\n\n          But note: k from 0 to n? but our a is indexed from 1 to n.

\n\n  But the problem's TODO is inside: \n      for k in 0,1:\n          for i in 19:\n              for j in n:\n                  l = j ^ (1<<i)\n                  if (k==0 and l>=j and l<n) or (k==1 and l<j and l<n): \n                      then do the operation.\n\n  This is not the same as the known solution.\n\n  Alternatively, we can change the condition to only do when l>=j and l<n, and then do the operation as in the known solution.\n\n  But the problem's condition is given as: \n      if k^(l<j) and l<n:\n\n  We can write:\n\n      condition = (k==0 and l>=j) or (k==1 and l<j)\n      and l<n\n\n  So for the known solution, they only do the first part (k==0 and l>=j) and skip the second part (k==1 and l<j). \n\n  But the problem's code has two passes: k=0 and k=1.\n\n  There is a known solution in Python for this problem (from a contest):\n\n      n = int(input())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      for k in range(2):\n          for i in range(19):\n              for j in range(n):\n                  l = j ^ (1 << i)\n                  if l < j or l >= n: continue\n                  if k == 0:\n                      if (j >> i) & 1:\n                          a[j] ^= a[l]\n                      else:\n                          a[l] ^= a[j]\n                  else:\n                      if (j >> i) & 1:\n                          a[l] ^= a[j]\n                      else:\n                          a[j] ^= a[l]\n      print(' '.join(map(str, a[::-1])))\n\n  This is the same as the C++ solution.\n\n  But note: they only do when l>=j and l<n (by skipping when l<j or l>=n).\n\n  So in our condition, we would never do the second pass (k=1) because in the second pass we would need to do when l<j, but they skip when l<j.\n\n  This suggests that the condition in the provided code (program2.py) is not matching the known solution.\n\n  However, the known solution only does the operation when l>=j and l<n, in both passes.\n\n  So perhaps the condition in the provided code is intended to be:\n\n      if l >= n: skip\n      if k==0 and l>=j: do op\n      if k==1 and l<j: do op   -> but this is never done because we are in the known solution and they skip l<j.\n\n  This is confusing.\n\n  Given the complexity, and that the known solution is available, we will output the code that is in the known solution, but we must fit the condition.\n\n  The known solution does for both k in [0,1] only when l>=j and l<n.\n\n  So in the provided code, the condition is: \n      if k^(l<j) and l<n:\n\n  We want to do the known solution's operation only when l>=j and l<n, for both k.\n\n  How to incorporate? \n\n      condition = (k==0 and l>=j) or (k==1 and l<j)\n\n  But for the known solution, we only want to do when l>=j and l<n, regardless of k.\n\n  So we would need to do in the first pass (k=0) when l>=j and l<n, and in the second pass (k=1) we would also need to do when l>=j and l<n? \n\n  But the condition for the second pass in the provided code is: k=1 and l<j -> which is not l>=j.\n\n  Therefore, to mimic the known solution, we should change the condition to simply: \n      if l < n and l > j:   -> but wait, the known solution does l>=j.\n\n  But note: l = j XOR (1<<i) -> it might be that l<j or l>j.\n\n  The known solution does for l>=j and l<n.\n\n  In the provided code, we can do:\n\n      if l >= n: \n          skip\n      else:\n          if k==0:\n              if l>=j:\n                  do op\n          else:\n              if l>=j:   # but then condition: k=1 and l>=j, but the condition in the if is: k^(l<j) -> for k=1 and l>=j: 1^(0)=1, so it would be taken.\n                  do op\n\n  But wait, the condition: \n      k^(l<j) \n      for l>=j: l<j is false -> 0, so k^0 = k.\n      so when k=0: condition=0? -> false.\n      when k=1: condition=1 -> true.\n\n  So in the provided condition, when l>=j and l<n, the condition is true only for k=1.\n\n  This is not what we want.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do the known solution's operation in the provided code by:\n\n      if l < n and (k == (l<j)): \n          then do the known solution's op for this k.\n\n  But the known solution does the op for both k in [0,1] and for l>=j and l<n.\n\n  So we want to do the op for both k and for l>=j and l<n.\n\n  The condition in the provided code: \n      if (k ^ (l<j)) and l<n: \n          ...\n\n  for l>=j: l<j is false, so condition = k ^ 0 = k.\n      when k=0: condition=0 -> false.\n      when k=1: condition=1 -> true.\n\n  for l<j: condition = k ^ 1.\n      when k=0: condition=1 -> true.\n      when k=1: condition=0 -> false.\n\n  Therefore, the condition in the provided code is:\n      for k=0: only when l<j and l<n.\n      for k=1: only when l>=j and l<n.\n\n  This is the opposite of the known solution.\n\n  So to do the known solution's op, we would need to swap the roles of k.\n\n  or do the op for the other k.\n\n  Given the complexity, and that the known solution is for condition (l>=j and l<n) for both k, we can change the condition to:\n\n      if (k==0) and (l>=j) and (l<n): \n          do op\n      if (k==1) and (l>=j) and (l<n):\n          do op\n\n  But the condition in the code is fixed: we cannot change the if condition.\n\n  Therefore, we must use the condition as given.\n\n  and inside the TODO, we will do the known solution's op, but for the current k and for the given (j,l) in the condition.\n\n  However, the known solution does different things for k=0 and k=1.\n\n  In the known solution for condition (l>=j and l<n) and for a fixed k, they do:\n\n      if k==0:\n          if (j has the i-th bit set): \n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n          else:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n      else: # k==1\n          if (j has the i-th bit set):\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  In our provided code, we are only entering the TODO when the condition (k^(l<j)) and (l<n) is true.\n\n  For the known solution's cases, we only want to do the op when l>=j and l<n, which in our condition happens only when k=1 and l>=j and l<n.\n\n  for k=0, we only do when l<j and l<n.\n\n  So to do the known solution's op for the case (l>=j and l<n) in the second pass (k=1) is straightforward.\n\n  For the first pass (k=0), we are doing when l<j and l<n. \n\n  The known solution does not do anything for l<j. \n\n  Therefore, we might skip the first pass? \n\n  But the known solution does two passes.\n\n  Alternatively, we can swap the roles of j and l when in the first pass (k=0) and l<j.\n\n  because if l<j, then we can swap j and l and then it becomes l>=j, and then do the op for the known solution's k=0.\n\n  then in the second pass (k=1) and l>=j, we do the known solution's k=1.\n\n  So in the TODO:\n\n      if k==0 and l<j and l<n:\n          # then swap j and l, and then do the known solution's k=0 op for (l, j) -> but note: after swap, the new j is l, and the new l is j.\n          # but we cannot swap, because we are in a for loop. Instead, we do the op for (l, j) as if we had swapped.\n\n          # known solution for k=0 on (l, j): \n          #   if (l has the i-th bit set): \n          #       a[l] ^= a[j]\n          #   else:\n          #       a[j] ^= a[l]\n          # \n          # But wait, the known solution for k=0 on (l, j) is: \n          #   if (l >> i) & 1:\n          #       a[l] ^= a[j]\n          #   else:\n          #       a[j] ^= a[l]\n          # \n          # This is exactly the else branch of the known solution for (j,l) in the first pass.\n\n      if k==0 and l>=j and l<n: \n          # then do the known solution for (j,l) in the first pass.\n\n  But our condition for k=0 is only l<j and l<n. We don't have l>=j in the first pass.\n\n  Therefore, for k=0, we only do the swapped version.\n\n  Similarly, for k=1 and l>=j and l<n, we do the known solution for (j,l) in the second pass.\n\n  for k=1 and l<j and l<n: \n      then do the swapped version of the known solution for the second pass.\n\n  But the known solution only does for l>=j, so in the second pass and for l<j, we skip in the known solution, so in our code for k=1 and l<j, we should skip? \n\n  However, our condition for k=1 is only l>=j and l<n, so we won't enter for l<j in the second pass.\n\n  Therefore, we only need to do for k=0 and l<j and l<n: \n          if (l >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n      and for k=1 and l>=j and l<n: \n          if (j >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  Let's test with the example: n=3, a = [0,2,1] (index0:0, index1:2, index2:1)\n\n  k=0:\n      i=0: \n          j=0: l=0^1=1 -> condition: k=0, l=1<j=0? -> 1<0 is false, so condition: 0^0=0 -> skip.\n          j=1: l=1^1=0 -> condition: 0^(0<1)=0^1=1 -> true. \n                then: if (l=0) has the i=0-th bit: 0 has the 0-th bit? -> 0 in binary: bit0=0 -> else: a[j] ^= a[l] -> a[1] = a[1] ^ a[0] = 2^0=2.\n          j=2: l=2^1=3 -> skip.\n      i=1: \n          j=0: l=0^2=2 -> condition: 0^(2<0)=0^0=0 -> skip.\n          j=1: l=1^2=3 -> skip.\n          j=2: l=2^2=0 -> condition: 0^(0<2)=0^1=1 -> true.\n                then: if (l=0) has the i=1-th bit: bit1 of 0 is 0 -> else: a[j] ^= a[l] -> a[2] = 1 ^ a[0]=1^0=1.\n      after k=0: a = [0,2,1]\n\n  k=1:\n      i=0:\n          j=0: l=1 -> condition: 1^(1<0)=1^0=1 -> true, and l=1<n=3 -> \n                if (j=0) has the i=0-th bit: 0 has bit0=0 -> else: a[0] ^= a[1] -> a[0]=0^2=2.\n          j=1: l=0 -> condition: 1^(0<1)=1^1=0 -> skip.\n          j=2: l=3 -> skip.\n      i=1:\n          j=0: l=2 -> condition: 1^(2<0)=1^0=1 -> true.\n                if (j=0) has the i=1-th bit: 0 has bit1=0 -> else: a[0] ^= a[2] -> a[0]=2^1=3.\n          j=1: skip.\n          j=2: skip.\n      after k=1: a = [3,2,1]\n\n  Then the code prints: print(*reversed(a)) = reversed([3,2,1]) = [1,2,3] -> which is the expected output.\n\n  Therefore, the TODO is:\n\n      if k == 0:\n          if (l >> i) & 1:   # if the i-th bit of l is set\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n      else: # k==1\n          if (j >> i) & 1:   # if the i-th bit of j is set\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  But note: in the condition for k=0, we are in the case l<j. \n      We are using the bit of l (which is the smaller index) to decide.\n\n  for k=1, we are in the case l>=j, and we use the bit of j.\n\n  This matches the above.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      if k == 0:\n          if (l >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n      else:\n          if (j >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  But note: the condition (l>>i)&1 and (j>>i)&1: we are using the current value of i (the bit number).\n\n  We are iterating i from 0 to 18.\n\n  This should work.\n\n  Let me test with the example provided in the note: \n      Input: n=3, a = [0,2,1] -> becomes [3,2,1] after the loops, then reversed to [1,2,3].\n\n  We did it above.\n\n  Another example: if the matrix is built from a=[1,2,3] then the last column should be [0,2,1] (as in the note).\n\n  But our code is for reconstruction: given last column [0,2,1] we got a=[1,2,3] (after reversing the final array).\n\n  The problem says: output a1, a2, a3 = 1,2,3.\n\n  So it is correct.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      x,y=R()\n      print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n  and for program2.py is:\n\n      if k == 0:\n          if (l >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n      else:\n          if (j >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  But note: in program2.py, the array is called 'a', and we are modifying it in place.\n\n  We output in JSON format:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"x,y=R()\\n  print(p[x]-p[x-y])\", \n        \"program2\": \"if k == 0:\\n        if (l >> i) & 1:\\n            a[l] ^= a[j]\\n        else:\\n            a[j] ^= a[l]\\n    else:\\n        if (j >> i) & 1:\\n            a[l] ^= a[j]\\n        else:\\n            a[j] ^= a[l]\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program1.py has the for loop and the TODO is in the for loop. We are replacing the TODO with two lines.\n\n  However, the existing code in program1.py has:\n\n      for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with two lines, so we must indent properly.\n\n  In program1.py, the missing code is two lines, and they should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is inside three loops, and the if condition, and then the TODO. We are replacing with a block of code.\n\n  We must be careful with the indentation.\n\n  For program1.py, the completion is:\n\n      x,y=R()\n      print(p[x]-p[x-y])\n\n  But note: the existing code uses 2 spaces? Let me see: \n\n      from itertools import accumulate\n      I=input;R=lambda:map(int,I().split())\n      n,q=R();a=sorted(R())[::-1];p=[0]+list(accumulate(a))\n      for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The for loop is indented by 0 spaces, and the TODO is indented by 4 spaces.\n\n  So the two lines should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n      \"    x,y=R()\\n    print(p[x]-p[x-y])\"\n\n  For program2.py, the existing code:\n\n      for k in 0,1:\n          for i in range(19):\n              for j in range(n):\n                  l=j^1<<i\n                  if k^(l<j)and l<n:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO is at an indentation level of 20 spaces? \n\n  We will provide the code with an extra 8 spaces (or 4 per level) but the existing code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\n  The block we are to put is:\n\n      if k == 0:\n          if (l >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n      else:\n          if (j >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  and it should be indented one more level (so 4 more spaces) than the condition.\n\n  The condition is at 20 spaces, so the block should be at 24 spaces.\n\n  But to be safe, we can provide the code with the same indentation as the condition.\n\n  Alternatively, we can provide the code without extra spaces and let the existing indentation handle it.\n\n  Since the problem does not specify, we will assume that the TODO is at the correct indentation level, and we will provide the code at the same level.\n\n  In the provided code for program2.py, the condition is:\n\n                  if k^(l<j)and l<n:\n                      # TODO\n\n  So the TODO is at an indentation of 20 spaces. We will provide the code at 20 spaces, and then the inner if and else should be indented 4 more.\n\n  Therefore, the string for program2 is:\n\n      \"if k == 0:\\n                if (l >> i) & 1:\\n                    a[l] ^= a[j]\\n                else:\\n                    a[j] ^= a[l]\\n            else:\\n                if (j >> i) & 1:\\n                    a[l] ^= a[j]\\n                else:\\n                    a[j] ^= a[l]\"\n\n  But this is messy.\n\n  Alternatively, we can provide the code without specifying the spaces, but the problem says \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n  We will assume that the missing code is:\n\n      for program1: two lines with 4-space indent each.\n      for program2: the block of code that should be placed at the TODO, at the same indentation level.\n\n  Since the problem does not specify the exact indentation level, we will use the minimal necessary.\n\n  For program1, we output:\n\n      \"    x, y = R()\\n    print(p[x] - p[x-y])\"\n\n  For program2, we output:\n\n      \"if k == 0:\\n        if (l >> i) & 1:\\n            a[l] ^= a[j]\\n        else:\\n            a[j] ^= a[l]\\n    else:\\n        if (j >> i) & 1:\\n            a[l] ^= a[j]\\n        else:\\n            a[j] ^= a[l]\"\n\n  But note: in program2, the existing code has the condition on the same line as the if, and then the TODO is on the next line with 4 more spaces.\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with a block that is 4 more spaces than the condition's line.\n\n  The condition's line is: \n                  if k^(l<j)and l<n:\n\n  and then the TODO is at 4 more spaces.\n\n  So our block should be at 4 more spaces than that.\n\n  Therefore, the first line of the block should be at the same level as the TODO.\n\n  and then the inner if-else should be indented 4 more.\n\n  So the program2 completion should be:\n\n      if k == 0:\n          if (l >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n      else:\n          if (j >> i) & 1:\n              a[l] ^= a[j]\n          else:\n              a[j] ^= a[l]\n\n  and we will represent this as a string with newlines and spaces.\n\n  We will use 8 spaces for the first level of the block and 12 for the inner.\n\n  But the existing condition is at 20 spaces, so the block should be at 20 spaces for the first line, 24 for the inner if, and 28 for the innermost.\n\n  However, to avoid specifying spaces, we can use the following: \n\n      In program2, the missing code is a block that is at the same indentation level as the TODO, and the TODO is at 4 spaces inside the innermost loop.\n\n  We will output the code as if it is at that level, and the user will insert it.\n\n  Given the complexity, we output the code as described.\n\n  Final output in JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    x, y = R()\\n    print(p[x] - p[x-y])\",\n        \"program2\": \"if k == 0:\\n        if (l >> i) & 1:\\n            a[l] ^= a[j]\\n        else:\\n            a[j] ^= a[l]\\n    else:\\n        if (j >> i) & 1:\\n            a[l] ^= a[j]\\n        else:\\n            a[j] ^= a[l]\"\n      }\n\n  But wait, in program2, the condition is on the same line as the 'if', so the block must be on the next line.\n\n  The TODO is on the next line, indented.\n\n  So the above string for program2 is a multi-line string that is intended to be inserted at the TODO.\n\n  The existing code has 20 spaces and then the condition. The next line for the TODO is 20+4=24 spaces.\n\n  Our program2 string has:\n\n      Line1: \"if k == 0:\" -> should be at 24 spaces? \n      Line2: \"        if (l >> i) & 1:\" -> this has 8 spaces, but we want 24+4=28 spaces? \n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  To avoid this, we output the code without extra leading spaces, and assume that the environment will insert it at the correct indentation.\n\n  The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n  So we output the code that is to be placed exactly at the TODO, and the TODO is at a certain indentation level. We don't have to worry about the absolute spaces.\n\n  Therefore, we output for program2 the string:\n\n      \"if k == 0:\\n    if (l >> i) & 1:\\n        a[l] ^= a[j]\\n    else:\\n        a[j] ^= a[l]\\nelse:\\n    if (j >> i) & 1:\\n        a"
