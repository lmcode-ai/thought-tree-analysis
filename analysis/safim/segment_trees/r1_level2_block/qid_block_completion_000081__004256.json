Then right: 2 and 0 (because index2 is still 0) -> different: subtract: (1+1)*(3-1-1)=2*1=2? Then update: then check right: 2 and 0 -> different: add 2? But wait: we are updating index1 to 2, then the right pair is between index1 (2) and index2 (0) -> so we subtract the old right pair (which was 0 and 0? actually no, because we haven't updated index2 yet) -> but at the time of updating index1, the value at index2 is still 0. So the old right pair for index1 was 0 and 0? Actually, no: the old value at index1 was 0, so the old right pair was 0 and 0 -> same -> no subtraction. Then after update, the right pair becomes 2 and 0 -> different -> add (1+1)*(3-1-1)=2*1=2. So after setting index1: \n            subtract left: 2 (because 1 and 0 were different) -> aws becomes 8-2=6\n            then update\n            add left: 2 (because 1 and 2 are different) -> 6+2=8\n            then right: no subtraction (because old was same) and then add 2 -> 10. Then set index2 to 3: Left: i=2: left pair (1,2): 2 and 0 -> different: subtract: (2)*(3-2)=2*1=2 -> aws=10-2=8\n          update to 3\n          then left: 2 and 3 -> different: add 2 -> 10\n          no right. Then total = 10. Now, let's compute manually: \n          base = 6\n          adjacent pairs: \n            (0,1): 1 and 2 -> different: contribution = 1*(3-1)=2\n            (1,2): 2 and 3 -> different: contribution = 2*(3-2)=2\n          total = 6+2+2 = 10 -> matches. However, note: the example in the problem: [1,2,2,4,5] -> 29. base = 15\n        pairs: \n          (0,1): 1,2 -> different: 1*4=4\n          (1,2): 2,2 -> same: 0\n          (2,3): 2,4 -> different: 3*2=6\n          (3,4): 4,5 -> different: 4*1=4\n        total = 15+4+6+4=29. So the method is correct. Therefore, we write update_awesomeness as:\n\n        def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n            n = len(arr)\n            old_val = arr[i]\n\n            #",

But the constraints are high, so we must do batch. Since the problem does not specify the efficiency, and the known solution in C++ might pass with while loops in O(n) total iterations, but in Python it might be borderline for 200000 iterations total (not per column) -> because the total number of vertical swaps is at most 200000, then the while loops overall run 200000 times. How? The total number of vertical swaps we do over the entire process is at most (total ones) which is <= 2*n, so 400000.",

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to address two separate programming challenges. The first involves efficiently updating and querying the sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments of an array after each update. The second involves determining the minimal number of swaps required to transform a 2xN matrix into a desired configuration or determining if it's impossible.\n\n### Approach for Program1: Sum of Awesomeness After Updates\n1. **Initial Setup**: The initial total awesomeness is the number of all possible subarrays, calculated as \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\). This accounts for each subarray having at least one block.\n2. **Adjacent Pairs Contribution**: For each adjacent pair in the array, if the elements are different, they contribute \\( i \\times (n - i) \\) to the total awesomeness, where \\( i \\) is the starting index of the pair.\n3. **Handling Updates**: When an element at index \\( i \\) is updated:\n   - **Left Pair (if \\( i > 0 \\))**: Adjust the contribution if the left adjacent pair (elements at \\( i-1 \\) and \\( i \\)) changes from same to different or vice versa.\n   - **Right Pair (if \\( i < n-1 \\))**: Similarly adjust the contribution for the right adjacent pair (elements at \\( i \\) and \\( i+1 \\)).\n4. **Efficiency**: Each update operation runs in \\( O(1) \\) time since only two adjacent pairs are checked per update, making the solution efficient for large inputs.\n\n### Approach for Program2: Minimal Swaps for Matrix Transformation\n1. **Initial Checks**: The solution processes each column of the 2xN matrices (current and desired) to compute cumulative differences in each row.\n2. **Vertical Swaps**: For each column, if there's an excess in one row and a deficit in the other, perform vertical swaps (counted in `ans`) to balance the differences between the rows.\n3. **Horizontal Moves**: The remaining differences after vertical swaps are handled by horizontal moves, which are accounted for by the sum of absolute values of the differences.\n4. **Final Check**: After processing all columns, if the cumulative differences for both rows are zero, output the total swaps; otherwise, output -1 indicating transformation is impossible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"n = len(arr)\\nold_val = arr[i]\\nif old_val == x:\\n    return curr_aws\\nif i > 0:\\n    if arr[i-1] != old_val:\\n        curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\\n    if arr[i-1] != x:\\n        curr_aws += i * (n - i)\\nif i < n-1:\\n    if old_val != arr[i+1]:\\n        curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\\n    if x != arr[i+1]:\\n        curr_aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\\narr[i] = x\\nreturn curr_aws\",\n  \"program2\": \"        ans += 1\\n        s0 += 1\\n        s1 -= 1\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program1**: The function `update_awesomeness` adjusts the total awesomeness by considering the impact of updating an element on its adjacent pairs. The left and right adjacent pairs are checked, and their contributions are updated if the elements change from equal to different or vice versa. The solution efficiently handles each update in constant time.\n- **Program2**: The solution processes each column, using vertical swaps to balance differences between rows. The remaining imbalances are handled by horizontal moves. The total swaps are accumulated, and if the final row differences are zero, the total swaps are printed; otherwise, -1 indicates the transformation is impossible. The approach efficiently processes each column in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs.",

    },
    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays after each update.\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\nNote: The total awesomeness for the entire array after each update must be printed.\n\nWe start with an initial array and then process m queries. Each query updates one element and we must output the new total.\n\nImportant: The total awesomeness for all contiguous subarrays can be computed by initially considering that the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 (for the first element) plus 1 for every index i (from l+1 to r) such that a[i] != a[i-1]. Therefore, the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray starting at l and ending at r is: 1 + (number of indices i in [l+1, r] such that a[i] != a[i-1]).\n\nThus, the total awesomeness over all subarrays is:\n  Total = (number of subarrays) + (for each adjacent pair (i-1, i), the number of subarrays that include both i-1 and i and for which a[i] != a[i-1])\n\nBut note: \n  The number of subarrays is n*(n+1)//2.\n\nAnd for an adjacent pair (i-1, i) (with i from 1 to n-1, 0-indexed indices i from 1 to n-1), the number of subarrays that include both positions i-1 and i is: i * (n - i) [because we can choose any start from 0 to i-1 and any end from i to n-1]. However, wait: \n  Actually, for a fixed adjacent pair at index i (between a[i] and a[i+1]), the number of subarrays that include both is: (i+1) * (n - i - 1) ??? \n\nBut note: \n  The adjacent pair (i, i+1) is at the boundary between the i-th and (i+1)-th element (0-indexed). \n  The subarray must start at any index from 0 to i and end at any index from i+1 to n-1. \n  So the count is: (i+1) * (n - i - 1).\n\nHowever, the problem states that the initial total awesomeness is computed as:\n  aws = (n * (n+1)) // 2   [which is the total number of subarrays]\n\nThen we subtract the contributions of adjacent pairs that are equal? Actually, no: we add 1 for every adjacent pair that is different? \n\nBut note: the awesomeness of a subarray is 1 (for the first element) plus 1 for every adjacent pair that is different. Therefore, the total awesomeness is:\n  Total = (number of subarrays) + (for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different, the number of subarrays that include that adjacent pair).\n\nSo if we let:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  and for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different, we add (i+1) * (n-i-1) [because that adjacent pair is included in that many subarrays].\n\nBut wait: actually, the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is included in a subarray [l, r] if and only if l <= i and r >= i+1. \n  The number of choices for l: from 0 to i -> (i+1) choices.\n  The number of choices for r: from i+1 to n-1 -> (n - i - 1) choices.\n\nSo the total contribution of a difference at (i, i+1) is (i+1)*(n-i-1).\n\nTherefore, the total awesomeness is:\n  base + sum_{for every adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different} (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\nBut note: the example in the note: \n  After the first query: [1,2,2,4,5] -> n=5, base = 15.\n\nAdjacent pairs:\n  (0,1): 1 and 2 -> different -> contribution: (0+1)*(5-0-1) = 1*4 = 4\n  (1,2): 2 and 2 -> same -> 0\n  (2,3): 2 and 4 -> different -> (2+1)*(5-2-1)= 3*2 = 6\n  (3,4): 4 and 5 -> different -> (3+1)*(5-3-1)=4*1=4\n\nTotal = 15 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 29 -> matches.\n\nSo we can maintain:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  and a variable for the current total differences: total_diff = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [ (i+1)*(n-i-1) * (1 if arr[i] != arr[i+1] else 0) ]\n\nThen the total awesomeness = base + total_diff.\n\nBut note: the problem updates one element at a time. When we update an element at position i, it can affect at most two adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). \n\nWe need to:\n  1. Remove the contributions of the adjacent pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) from total_diff if they were different (and then update the array and then add the contributions back if they become different after the update).\n  2. Also, note that the update might make an adjacent pair that was same become different, or vice versa.\n\nWe are given:\n  arr: the current array (we are maintaining in the main code as 'tar'? Actually, the main code uses two arrays: initially we have an array 'arr' from input, and then we have an array 'tar' which is initialized as [0]*n. Then we update 'tar' by calling update_awesomeness with the new value. But note: the initial loop:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  This suggests that we are building the array 'tar' by setting each element. So 'tar' is the current array.\n\n  Therefore, we should maintain the current array in 'tar'. \n\nPlan for update_awesomeness:\n  We are passed:\n      arr: the current array (which is named 'tar' in the main code, but note the function parameter is named 'arr')\n      i: the index to update\n      x: the new value\n      curr_aws: the current total awesomeness (which is base + total_diff)\n\n  Steps:\n      1. Check the current value at arr[i] (let's call it old_value) and the new value x. If old_value equals x, then nothing changes? But note: the array might have been built by previous updates, so we must update the array and then adjust the adjacent pairs.\n\n      However, note that the main code initializes 'tar' as [0]*n and then updates each element with the initial array. Then for each query, it updates one element.\n\n      We must:\n        - Remove the contributions of the adjacent pairs that involve index i (if they exist) from the total_diff (if they were different) and then update the array at i to x, and then add the contributions of the adjacent pairs that involve i (if they are different) and then update curr_aws accordingly.\n\n      Specifically, the adjacent pairs are:\n          left pair: (i-1, i)   -> only if i>=1\n          right pair: (i, i+1)  -> only if i < n-1\n\n      For each of these pairs, we do:\n          Before update:\n            if the two elements in the pair are different, then we subtract the contribution for that pair (which is (min_index+1)*(n - min_index - 1) but note: for the left pair the index of the pair is i-1 (so the adjacent index is i-1) and for the right pair the adjacent index is i.\n\n          How to compute the contribution for a pair at adjacent index j (meaning between j and j+1)? \n            contribution = (j+1) * (n - j - 1)   [if the two elements are different]\n\n      So:\n        Let old_left = (if i>=1: check arr[i-1] and arr[i] (the old value at i) -> if they are different, then we subtract (i) * (n - i) [because the adjacent index is i-1: so j = i-1 -> (j+1)=i, n-j-1 = n-i]? \n          Actually, adjacent index j = i-1: then the contribution is ( (i-1)+1 ) * (n - (i-1) - 1) = i * (n - i) -> because n - (i-1) - 1 = n - i.\n\n        Similarly, for the right pair: adjacent index j = i -> (i+1) * (n - i - 1).\n\n      Steps in the function:\n\n        old_val = arr[i]   # current value at position i\n\n        # We are going to update arr[i] to x.\n\n        # First, remove the contributions of the adjacent pairs that involve i (if they exist) for the old value.\n\n        # Left pair (i-1, i): \n          if i >= 1:\n            if arr[i-1] != old_val:\n                # This pair was contributing: we subtract the value for adjacent index = i-1: which is i * (n - i)\n                curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\n\n        # Right pair (i, i+1):\n          if i < n-1:\n            if old_val != arr[i+1]:\n                curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n        # Now update the array at position i to x.\n        arr[i] = x\n\n        # Then, add the contributions for the adjacent pairs that involve i (if they are different) for the new value.\n\n        # Left pair (i-1, i):\n          if i >= 1:\n            if arr[i-1] != x:\n                curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n\n        # Right pair (i, i+1):\n          if i < n-1:\n            if x != arr[i+1]:\n                curr_aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n        Then return curr_aws.\n\n      However, note: the base (which is the total number of subarrays) is already included in the initial aws (which was set to (n*(n+1))//2). And we are only adjusting the differences. So this should work.\n\n      But note: the initial state of the array is built by setting each element one by one. However, when we set the initial array, we start with an array of zeros? Then we update each element to the initial value. This might cause the adjacent pairs to be updated correctly? \n\n      Example: initial array: [1,2,3] for n=3.\n\n        Initially: tar = [0,0,0], aws = 6 (base: 3*4//2=6).\n\n        Then we set index0 to 1:\n          Left pair: none (i=0: no left)\n          Right pair: i=0, then 0 and 0: same -> no subtraction. Then update to 1: then check right: 1 and 0 -> different? But at that moment, the next element is still 0? So we add: (0+1)*(3-0-1)=1*2=2 -> aws becomes 8.\n\n        Then set index1 to 2:\n          Left: i=1: left pair (0,1): 1 and 0 -> different? Actually, at the moment we update index1, the current value at index1 is 0. So for left pair: 1 and 0 -> different: subtract: 1*(3-1)=1*2=2 -> then update to 2. Then left: 1 and 2 -> different: add 1*2=2. Then right: 2 and 0 (because index2 is still 0) -> different: subtract: (1+1)*(3-1-1)=2*1=2? Then update: then check right: 2 and 0 -> different: add 2? \n          But wait: we are updating index1 to 2, then the right pair is between index1 (2) and index2 (0) -> so we subtract the old right pair (which was 0 and 0? actually no, because we haven't updated index2 yet) -> but at the time of updating index1, the value at index2 is still 0. So the old right pair for index1 was 0 and 0? Actually, no: the old value at index1 was 0, so the old right pair was 0 and 0 -> same -> no subtraction. Then after update, the right pair becomes 2 and 0 -> different -> add (1+1)*(3-1-1)=2*1=2.\n\n          So after setting index1: \n            subtract left: 2 (because 1 and 0 were different) -> aws becomes 8-2=6\n            then update\n            add left: 2 (because 1 and 2 are different) -> 6+2=8\n            then right: no subtraction (because old was same) and then add 2 -> 10.\n\n        Then set index2 to 3:\n          Left: i=2: left pair (1,2): 2 and 0 -> different: subtract: (2)*(3-2)=2*1=2 -> aws=10-2=8\n          update to 3\n          then left: 2 and 3 -> different: add 2 -> 10\n          no right.\n\n        Then total = 10.\n\n        Now, let's compute manually: \n          base = 6\n          adjacent pairs: \n            (0,1): 1 and 2 -> different: contribution = 1*(3-1)=2\n            (1,2): 2 and 3 -> different: contribution = 2*(3-2)=2\n          total = 6+2+2 = 10 -> matches.\n\n      However, note: the example in the problem: [1,2,2,4,5] -> 29.\n\n        base = 15\n        pairs: \n          (0,1): 1,2 -> different: 1*4=4\n          (1,2): 2,2 -> same: 0\n          (2,3): 2,4 -> different: 3*2=6\n          (3,4): 4,5 -> different: 4*1=4\n        total = 15+4+6+4=29.\n\n      So the method is correct.\n\n      Therefore, we write update_awesomeness as:\n\n        def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n            n = len(arr)\n            old_val = arr[i]\n\n            # If the new value is the same as the old, then we don't need to do anything? \n            # But note: the adjacent pairs might be the same? Actually, if the value doesn't change, then the adjacent pairs remain the same. So we can skip?\n            if old_val == x:\n                return curr_aws\n\n            # Process left adjacent pair (i-1, i)\n            if i > 0:\n                # The left adjacent pair is (arr[i-1], arr[i])\n                # Before update: if arr[i-1] != old_val, then we had a contribution for this pair: we subtract it.\n                if arr[i-1] != old_val:\n                    # The adjacent index for the left pair is i-1 -> so the contribution is (i) * (n - i)\n                    curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\n                # After update: check with the new value\n                if arr[i-1] != x:\n                    curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n\n            # Process right adjacent pair (i, i+1)\n            if i < n-1:\n                if old_val != arr[i+1]:\n                    curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n                if x != arr[i+1]:\n                    curr_aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n            # Update the array at position i\n            arr[i] = x\n            return curr_aws\n\n      However, note: in the above, we are updating the array at the end. But when we check the right adjacent pair after update, we use the new value at i and the current value at i+1. But the value at i+1 might be updated later? Actually, no: we are updating one element at a time, and the array is maintained as the current state.\n\n      But note: in the left adjacent pair, we use the current value at i-1 (which is the latest) and the old value at i. Then we update i to x, and then for the right adjacent pair we use the new value at i and the current value at i+1 (which is the latest, but note: if we are updating i, then i+1 has not been updated in this call so it is the same as before).\n\n      This is correct.\n\n      However, we must note: the array is passed by reference and we update it. The main code uses the array 'tar' and we are updating it.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the body of update_awesomeness.\n\nFor program2.py:\n  We are to compute the minimal number of swaps to transform the current 2xn matrix into the desired one, or output -1 if impossible.\n\n  The problem: \n      We have two rows and n columns. We can swap two neighboring cells (adjacent horizontally or vertically).\n\n  Important: The total number of ones (and zeros) must be the same in the current and desired arrangements. Otherwise, output -1.\n\n  The approach in the code provided:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      a, b, x, y = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(4)]\n\n      Then:\n        s0 = s1 = ans = 0\n        for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n            s0 += m\n            s0 -= p\n            s1 += n\n            s1 -= q\n            while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                ans += 1\n                s0 -= 1\n                s1 += 1\n            while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n        print(-1 if s1 or s0 else ans)\n\n  What is this doing?\n\n  Let me denote:\n      current matrix: \n          row0: a[0..n-1]\n          row1: b[0..n-1]\n      desired matrix:\n          row0: x[0..n-1]\n          row1: y[0..n-1]\n\n  The idea is to consider the difference per column. However, the code is maintaining two variables s0 and s1 that accumulate the differences in the prefix for row0 and row1? \n\n  Actually, the code does:\n      s0 = (cumulative sum of a[0..i]) - (cumulative sum of x[0..i])   for row0\n      s1 = (cumulative sum of b[0..i]) - (cumulative sum of y[0..i])   for row1\n\n  But note: the entire matrix must have the same total ones. So at the end, s0 and s1 must be zero? Actually, the total for row0: sum(a) should equal sum(x) and similarly for row1? But note: the problem does not require that the total per row is the same, only the entire matrix. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"if it is possible\" -> so we must check that the total number of ones in the current matrix equals that in the desired. But the code does not check that at the beginning? \n\n  Actually, the code accumulates the differences per column and then at the end checks if s0==0 and s1==0? But note: at the end of the loop, we have processed all columns. Then s0 should be the total difference for row0: which is (sum(a) - sum(x)) and similarly s1 = (sum(b) - sum(y)). However, the entire matrix: the total ones in current = sum(a)+sum(b), and in desired = sum(x)+sum(y). So if these are not equal, then we output -1. But note: the code does:\n\n        print(-1 if s1 or s0 else ans)\n\n  This is incorrect: because if the entire matrix has the same total, then we must have s0 + s1 = 0? But the problem does not require per row? Actually, the entire matrix: the total ones must be the same. So we require s0 + s1 == 0? But the code checks s0==0 and s1==0. \n\n  However, note: the problem does not require that the per-row counts are the same? For example, we might have in the current matrix: row0 has 3 ones and row1 has 2 ones, and in the desired: row0 has 2 ones and row1 has 3 ones. Then the entire matrix has 5 ones. Then s0 at the end = 3-2=1, s1=2-3=-1 -> then s0+s1=0. But the code would see s0=1 and s1=-1 -> then it would output -1? That is incorrect.\n\n  Therefore, the provided code has a flaw: it is maintaining per-row differences and then at the end requires both to be zero. But we only require the entire matrix to have the same total? Actually, no: the problem does not require per row? \n\n  But note: the puzzle has two rows. The swaps can move a one from one row to the other? Actually, a vertical swap between the two rows in the same column would move a one from row0 to row1 and vice versa. So the total per row might change? \n\n  However, the problem does not require the per-row counts to be preserved? Actually, the entire matrix: the total number of ones is preserved. So we require that the total ones in the current matrix equals the total ones in the desired. \n\n  But the code does not check that. It accumulates the differences per column and then at the end checks if the cumulative differences for row0 and row1 are both zero. This is equivalent to requiring that the per-row counts are the same? \n\n  Actually, the problem: \n      We have two rows. The desired arrangement might have a different distribution of ones between the rows? \n\n  Example: \n      Current: \n          row0: [1,0]\n          row1: [0,0]\n      Desired:\n          row0: [0,0]\n          row1: [1,0]\n\n      This is possible: swap the 1 from (0,0) to (1,0) by one vertical swap.\n\n      Then:\n          s0: for column0: 1 - 0 = 1 -> s0=1, s1=0-0=0 -> then at column0: s0=1, s1=0.\n          Then for column1: 0-0=0, 0-0=0 -> s0=1, s1=0.\n          Then we output -1? \n\n  So the code as provided is flawed.\n\n  However, the note in the code: \n      \"we would like to make every prefix of a is same as a' (with a' is fixed)\"\n\n  This suggests that the code is using a different idea: it is trying to make the prefix sums of the two rows in the current matrix equal to the prefix sums of the two rows in the desired matrix? \n\n  But note: the problem does not require the prefix sums to be the same? It requires the entire arrangement to be the same.\n\n  The idea in the code: \n      We traverse column by column. For each column j, we update:\n          s0 = s0 + a[j] - x[j]   # difference in row0 up to column j\n          s1 = s1 + b[j] - y[j]   # difference in row1 up to column j\n\n      Then we have two while loops:\n\n          while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n              ans += 1\n              s0 -= 1\n              s1 += 1\n\n          while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      Then we add abs(s0) + abs(s1) to ans.\n\n  What does this do?\n\n  Consider: \n      s0 and s1 are the cumulative differences for row0 and row1. \n\n      The idea: \n          If in the current state we have an excess of ones in row0 (s0>0) and a deficit in row1 (s1<0), then we can fix one unit of this by swapping a one from row0 to row1? But note: we are at a particular column, and we can only swap adjacent cells. How can we fix the prefix? \n\n      Actually, the intended solution is known: \n          We define an array d of length n: d[i] = (a[i] + b[i]) - (x[i] + y[i])? \n          But then we also need to consider the possibility of moving ones between rows? \n\n      Alternatively, we can define:\n          Let c[i] = a[i]   (current row0 at column i)\n          Let d[i] = b[i]   (current row1 at column i)\n          And similarly for desired: e[i]=x[i], f[i]=y[i].\n\n          The total ones in the entire matrix must be the same: so sum(c)+sum(d) = sum(e)+sum(f). \n\n      Another idea: \n          We can consider the difference in the entire matrix: \n            total_diff = (sum(c)+sum(d)) - (sum(e)+sum(f)) \n          If not zero, output -1.\n\n      But also, we can consider the difference per column? \n\n      The known solution for this problem (from known problems like \"Swaps in the Matrix\"): \n          We note that the total number of ones in the entire current matrix must equal that in the desired. \n          Then, we can consider the following: \n            Let A = current matrix, B = desired matrix.\n            We can define an array d[0..n-1] = (a[0]-x[0], a[1]-x[1], ...) but that is per row0? \n\n          Actually, we can define the net flow? \n\n      Insight: \n          The minimal number of swaps is the inversion of the permutation? But the matrix has two rows.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use a state machine: \n          We note that the two rows are independent? Not exactly: because we can swap vertically.\n\n      Known similar problem: CodeForces \"Moving Segments\" or \"Swaps in the Matrix\" (but I recall a problem with two rows).\n\n      The intended solution: \n          We consider the cumulative difference for the entire matrix? \n\n          Let d[i] = (a[i] + b[i]) - (x[i] + y[i])   -> the net excess of ones in column i? Then the cumulative sum of d[0..i] must be zero at the end? \n\n          But also, we can consider the difference between the two rows? \n\n      Actually, the solution in the provided code is known from known problems (like CodeForces 1775C) or similar. \n\n      The idea in the code: \n          We maintain two variables: \n            s0: the cumulative difference for row0 (from column0 to current column) \n            s1: the cumulative difference for row1.\n\n          The key: \n            We can use a swap to move a one from row0 to row1 (if we have a one in row0 and a zero in row1 in the same column? and then swap vertically) to fix the prefix? \n\n          But note: we are allowed to swap any neighboring cells. So we can move a one from row0 to row1 in the same column? But that requires a vertical swap. However, we can also move ones horizontally.\n\n      The known solution (from known problems) for a 2xn matrix: \n          We define:\n            d[i] = a[i] - x[i]   # for row0\n            e[i] = b[i] - y[i]   # for row1\n\n          Then the total for the column i: d[i] + e[i] must be zero? Actually, no: because we can move ones between columns? \n\n      Actually, the entire matrix: the total ones is preserved. So the sum of d[i] over i and e[i] over i must be zero? But note: the entire matrix: \n          total_current = sum(a) + sum(b)\n          total_desired = sum(x) + sum(y)\n          so we require total_current == total_desired.\n\n      Then, we can define the net flow? \n\n      The solution in the code: \n          We traverse column by column. For each column, we update the cumulative differences for row0 and row1. \n          Then, we try to fix the differences by using vertical swaps in the current column? \n\n          Specifically, if we have an excess in row0 and a deficit in row1 (s0>0 and s1<0), then we can do a vertical swap in the current column? But note: we are at the current column, and we can only swap within the current column? Actually, we can swap vertically in the current column? \n\n          However, the problem allows swapping neighboring cells: so in the same column, we can swap the two cells? That is a vertical swap. \n\n          So if at the current column we have:\n              current: (a_current, b_current) and we want (x_current, y_current)\n              but we are accumulating the entire prefix.\n\n          The idea: \n              We can use a vertical swap at the current column to move one excess from row0 to row1? But note: we are not limited to the current column? Actually, we can also move ones horizontally? \n\n          The insight: \n              The minimal number of swaps is the sum of the absolute values of the cumulative differences? But we can also use vertical swaps to transfer between rows? \n\n          The known solution (from a known problem) is:\n\n              total = 0\n              s0 = 0, s1 = 0\n              for i in range(n):\n                  s0 += a[i] - x[i]\n                  s1 += b[i] - y[i]\n                  # If we have an imbalance, we can fix by swapping between rows in the same column? \n                  # But note: we can only swap adjacent cells. However, we can simulate moving an excess from row0 to row1 by a vertical swap? \n                  # But that vertical swap would fix one unit of s0 and one unit of s1? \n                  # Specifically: \n                  #   if s0>0 and s1<0: then we can do a vertical swap to move one from row0 to row1? \n                  #   This would: s0 decreases by 1, s1 increases by 1 -> and we count one swap.\n                  # Similarly, if s0<0 and s1>0: then we do a vertical swap to move one from row1 to row0? \n                  #   s0 increases by 1, s1 decreases by 1 -> one swap.\n\n                  # But note: we are allowed to do swaps anywhere? However, we are processing column by column. The vertical swap we are doing is at the current column? But we are not actually changing the array? \n\n                  # Actually, the idea is that we can use the current column as a \"buffer\" to transfer between rows? \n\n                  # Then, after these vertical swaps, we are left with the residual differences that we have to carry over to the next column? \n\n                  # How? \n                  #   The residual differences in row0 and row1 must be fixed by horizontal swaps? But note: we can also move ones to the next column? \n\n                  # Actually, the problem is known: the minimal number of swaps is the sum of the absolute values of the cumulative differences for the entire matrix? \n\n                  # But wait: the known solution for the problem \"Transforming a 2xn matrix\" is:\n\n                  total_ones = sum(a) + sum(b)\n                  if total_ones != sum(x) + sum(y):\n                      print(-1)\n                      return\n\n                  s = 0\n                  ans = 0\n                  for i in range(n):\n                      s += a[i] - x[i]   # this is the difference in row0 at column i\n                      # but also we have row1: but note the entire column: a[i]+b[i] = x[i]+y[i]? Not necessarily? \n                  # Actually, we don't require per column? \n\n                  # Alternatively, we define:\n                  #   d[i] = a[i] - x[i]   # row0\n                  #   e[i] = b[i] - y[i]   # row1\n                  #   Then the cumulative difference for row0: S0 = d[0]+d[1]+...+d[i]\n                  #   and for row1: S1 = e[0]+e[1]+...+e[i]\n                  #   But note: d[i]+e[i] = (a[i]+b[i]) - (x[i]+y[i]) = 0? -> because the entire matrix has the same total per column? \n                  #   Actually, no: the entire matrix has the same total, but not per column.\n\n                  # The known solution (from CodeForces submissions for similar problems) is:\n\n                  s = 0\n                  ans = 0\n                  for i in range(n):\n                      s += a[i] + b[i] - x[i] - y[i]\n                      # But then we have to account for the possibility of vertical swaps? \n\n                  # Actually, we can use two variables for the two rows? \n\n          The provided code uses two variables s0 and s1. And then:\n\n              while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                  ans += 1\n                  s0 -= 1\n                  s1 += 1\n\n              while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                  ans += 1\n                  s0 += 1\n                  s1 -= 1\n\n              ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n\n          Then at the end, if s0==0 and s1==0, we output ans, else -1.\n\n          Why? \n\n          Explanation: \n            The vertical swaps can fix the imbalance between the two rows. Specifically, if we have an excess in row0 and a deficit in row1, we can do a vertical swap to move one from row0 to row1. This fixes one unit of both. Similarly for the opposite.\n\n            Then the residual differences in each row (abs(s0) and abs(s1)) must be fixed by horizontal swaps? But note: we are not actually moving the ones horizontally in the code. \n\n          However, the horizontal moves are not explicitly done? The idea is that the residual differences are carried over to the next column? \n\n          But note: the code does not reset s0 and s1 after the while loops? It then adds the absolute values? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for the problem \"2xn\" is:\n\n            total = 0\n            s0 = 0\n            s1 = 0\n            ans = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                s0 += a[i] - x[i]\n                s1 += b[i] - y[i]\n                # Now, we can use vertical swaps to transfer between the two rows? \n                # But note: we can only do one vertical swap per adjacent pair? \n                # However, we are not limited to the current column? But the vertical swap in the current column can be done arbitrarily many times? \n                # But we are processing column by column, and we can do as many vertical swaps as needed in the current column? \n                # But the current column: we have already fixed the desired state? \n\n                # Actually, the vertical swaps we are simulating are not in the current column? They are in the entire matrix? \n\n                # The idea: \n                #   We can use the current column as a place to temporarily store the imbalance? \n\n                # But the known solution: \n                #   We do:\n                while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                    # This means we have an extra one in row0 and a missing one in row1: we can swap a one from row0 to row1? \n                    # This swap will cost 1? But where? It can be done anywhere? \n                    # Actually, we are not specifying the location. We are just counting that we need one swap to transfer.\n                    ans += 1\n                    s0 -= 1\n                    s1 += 1\n                while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                    ans += 1\n                    s0 += 1\n                    s1 -= 1\n                # Then, the remaining differences in s0 and s1 must be carried over to the next column? \n                # But note: the next column will also have differences. \n                # However, the absolute values of s0 and s1 are added to the answer? \n                ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n\n            if s0 != 0 or s1 != 0:\n                print(-1)\n            else:\n                print(ans)\n\n          But wait: the absolute values are added at every column? That would overcount. \n\n          Actually, the known solution (from a known problem \"Two Rows\" in CodeForces) is:\n\n            s = 0\n            ans = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                s += (a[i] + b[i]) - (x[i] + y[i])\n                if a[i] != x[i] or b[i] != y[i]:\n                    # But then we adjust? \n                    pass\n\n          Alternatively, we can use a different approach: \n            We note that the total number of ones in the entire matrix must be preserved. \n            Also, the minimal number of swaps is the inversion of the permutation of the ones? \n\n          But the provided code structure is as above. \n\n      After research, I recall that the problem is \"B. Swaps\" (or similar) and the solution is:\n\n          total1 = sum(a) + sum(b)\n          total2 = sum(x) + sum(y)\n          if total1 != total2:\n              print(-1)\n              return\n\n          s0 = 0\n          s1 = 0\n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(n):\n              s0 += a[i] - x[i]\n              s1 += b[i] - y[i]\n              # We can fix the imbalance by vertical swaps? \n              while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                  # We can do a vertical swap: move one from row0 to row1\n                  s0 -= 1\n                  s1 += 1\n                  ans += 1\n              while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                  s0 += 1\n                  s1 -= 1\n                  ans += 1\n              # Then, the remaining differences must be carried over? \n              # But note: the next column will account for the cumulative difference. \n              # However, the absolute values are not added here? \n\n          Then we also have to account for horizontal moves? \n\n      But the provided code adds: \n          ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n\n      And then at the end, if s0 or s1 is not zero, it prints -1? \n\n      However, the example I gave earlier:\n\n          Current: \n              a = [1,0] -> row0\n              b = [0,0] -> row1\n          Desired:\n              x = [0,0] -> row0\n              y = [1,0] -> row1\n\n          Column0:\n              a[0]=1, x[0]=0 -> s0 = 1\n              b[0]=0, y[0]=1 -> s1 = -1\n          Then we do:\n              while s0>0 and s1<0: \n                  we do: ans=1, s0=0, s1=0.\n              then ans += abs(0)+abs(0)=0 -> total ans=1.\n\n          Then column1: \n              a[1]=0, x[1]=0 -> s0=0\n              b[1]=0, y[1]=0 -> s1=0\n          Then no change.\n\n          Then at the end, s0=0, s1=0 -> output 1. Correct.\n\n      But what if we have:\n\n          Current: \n              row0: [1,0] \n              row1: [0,0]\n          Desired:\n              row0: [0,1]\n              row1: [0,0]\n\n          How many swaps? \n              We can swap horizontally: \n                  swap (0,0) and (0,1): two horizontal swaps? \n                  Actually: \n                      (0,0) and (0,1) are adjacent? \n                      We can swap (0,0) and (0,1): that moves the 1 to (0,1). Then we have row0: [0,1] and row1: [0,0]. -> 1 swap? \n\n          But wait: \n              Step1: swap (0,0) and (0,1): \n                  becomes: [0,1] in row0, and row1 remains [0,0]. -> done in 1 swap.\n\n          Now with the code:\n\n              Column0: \n                  s0 = 1 - 0 = 1\n                  s1 = 0 - 0 = 0\n                  then: no vertical swap.\n                  ans += abs(1)+abs(0)=1 -> so ans=1.\n\n              Column1:\n                  s0 = 1 (from column0) + (0-1) = 0\n                  s1 = 0 + (0-0)=0\n                  then no change.\n\n              Then output 1.

Correct.\n\n          However, what if:\n\n              Current: \n                  row0: [1,0]\n                  row1: [1,0]\n              Desired:\n                  row0: [0,1]\n                  row1: [0,1]\n\n              How many swaps? \n                  We can do:\n                    swap (0,0) and (0,1): then row0 becomes [0,1] -> done for row0? But then row1: [1,0] -> then we need to fix row1: swap (1,0) and (1,1): 2 swaps.\n\n              But also, we could do vertical swaps? \n                  swap (0,0) and (1,0): then we get:\n                      row0: [1,0] -> becomes [1,0] at row0? Actually, we swapped (0,0) and (1,0): \n                         row0: [1 (from row1), 0] -> [1,0] -> but row1: [1 (from row0),0] -> [1,0] -> no change? \n\n              Actually, we need to move the ones to the right. \n\n              The minimal swaps: 2.\n\n              With the code:\n\n                  Column0:\n                      s0 = 1-0=1\n                      s1 = 1-0=1\n                      then no vertical swap (because we require one positive and one negative) -> then ans += abs(1)+abs(1)=2.\n                  Column1:\n                      s0 = 1 + (0-1)=0\n                      s1 = 1 + (0-1)=0\n                      then no change.\n\n                  Total ans=2.

Correct.\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            b = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            x = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            y = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Check total ones?\n            # But the code at the end checks s0 and s1: if they are not zero, then output -1.\n            # However, if the total ones are not the same, then at the end s0 and s1 will not be zero? \n            # But note: s0 = (sum(a) - sum(x)), s1 = (sum(b)-sum(y)). \n            # And we require that the entire matrix: sum(a)+sum(b) = sum(x)+sum(y) -> which is equivalent to s0+s1==0.\n            # But the code at the end checks s0==0 and s1==0? \n            # So if the total ones are preserved but per row are not, then s0 and s1 might not be zero? \n\n            # Example: \n            #   a=[1,0], b=[0,0] -> total=1\n            #   x=[0,0], y=[0,1] -> total=1, but then:\n            #       s0 = 1-0 + 0-0 = 1\n            #       s1 = 0-0 + 0-1 = -1\n            #       then at the end: s0=1, s1=-1 -> then the code outputs -1? \n            #   But wait, we did the vertical swap in column0 and fixed it? \n\n            # Actually, the example above: \n            #   We had: \n            #       a=[1,0] -> row0\n            #       b=[0,0] -> row1\n            #       x=[0,0] -> row0\n            #       y=[0,1] -> row1\n            #   Then at column0: \n            #       s0 = 1-0=1\n            #       s1 = 0-0=0 -> then we don't do a vertical swap? \n            #       then ans += abs(1)+abs(0)=1 -> so ans=1.\n            #   Then at column1:\n            #       s0 = 1 + (0-0)=1\n            #       s1 = 0 + (0-1)=-1\n            #       then we do: while s0>0 and s1<0: \n            #           ans=2, s0=0, s1=0.\n            #       then ans += 0 -> total=2.\n            #   Then at the end, s0=0, s1=0 -> output 2.\n\n            # But the desired arrangement is achieved? \n            #   After the swaps: \n            #       We did two operations: \n            #         Operation1: at column0: we did a vertical swap? But we didn't do any vertical swap at column0? \n            #         Then at column1: we did a vertical swap? But at column1: we have (0,0) in current and (0,1) in desired? \n            #         How does a vertical swap at column1 help? \n            #         We have at column1: \n            #             current: row0=0, row1=0 -> but desired: row0=0, row1=1 -> we need to get a one in row1? \n            #         But we have an extra one in row0 (from column0) and we are at column1: we can move the one from row0 (which is at column0) to row1 at column1? \n            #         That requires two horizontal moves and one vertical? \n\n            #   The code counts 2 swaps? \n\n            #   How? \n            #       The two operations: \n            #         Operation1: we did a vertical swap at column0? But the code did the vertical swap at column1? \n            #         Actually, the code does not specify the location. It is a greedy transfer of the imbalance. \n\n            #   The minimal number of swaps is 2? \n            #         Step1: swap (0,0) and (0,1): moves the one from (0,0) to (0,1) -> then row0: [0,1] -> but desired row0: [0,0] -> not fixed.\n            #         Step2: swap (0,1) and (1,1): then row0: [0,0], row1: [0,1] -> done.\n\n            #   So 2 swaps.\n\n            #   Therefore, the code outputs 2.\n\n            #   But the desired arrangement is [0,0] for row0 and [0,1] for row1? \n            #       The example desired: \n            #           row0: [0,0]\n            #           row1: [0,1] -> but the example I described above for the desired was: \n            #               x = [0,0] -> row0: [0,0]\n            #               y = [0,1] -> row1: [0,1] -> that is the desired.\n\n            #   So it matches.\n\n            #   Therefore, the code works.\n\n          So the TODO in program2.py is to complete the second while loop:\n\n            while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                ans += 1\n                s0 += 1\n                s1 -= 1\n\n          And then the rest is as provided.\n\n          However, note: the example in the problem note: \n              \"In the first example the following sequence of swaps will suffice: ... It can be shown that 5 is the minimal possible answer in this case.\"\n\n          We must check with the first example.\n\n          The first example input is not provided in the note, but the sample input is:\n\n              n=6\n              current:\n                  row0: [1,0,0,1,0,0]\n                  row1: [0,1,0,0,0,1]\n              desired:\n                  row0: [1,1,1,0,0,0]   # but the note says: \n                  row1: [0,1,1,1,1,2]   -> wait, the note says: \n                  \"In the first example the following sequence of swaps will suffice: \n                    (2,1), (1,1), \n                    (1,2), (1,3), \n                    (2,2), (2,3), \n                    (1,4), (1,5), \n                    (2,5), (2,4).\"\n\n          Actually, the note does not provide the matrices. \n\n          But the problem says: \n              \"The first line contains an integer n (1<=n<=200000) ...\"\n\n          And the sample input is not provided. \n\n          We trust the algorithm.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n              ans += 1\n              s0 += 1\n              s1 -= 1\n\n      And note: the code then adds the absolute values and then at the end checks if both s0 and s1 are zero.\n\n      However, the example we did above with the desired arrangement [0,0] for row0 and [0,1] for row1 had an answer of 2, which matched.\n\n      But note: the problem says: \n          \"In the second example no matter what swaps you do, you won't get the desired arrangement, so the answer is -1.\"\n\n      How do we get -1? \n          The code at the end checks: \n              print(-1 if s1 or s0 else ans)\n\n          So if at the end s0 is not zero or s1 is not zero, we output -1.\n\n          This happens if the total per row are not the same? \n          But note: the entire matrix: the total ones must be the same. \n          However, the code does not require the per-row totals to be the same? It only requires that the cumulative differences at the end are zero? \n\n          Actually, the cumulative differences at the end are the total differences for row0 and row1: \n              s0 = sum(a) - sum(x)\n              s1 = sum(b) - sum(y)\n\n          And we require both to be zero? \n\n          But the entire matrix: \n              (sum(a)+sum(b)) = (sum(x)+sum(y))  => s0+s1=0.\n\n          However, the code requires s0==0 and s1==0. \n\n          So if the entire matrix total is preserved, then s0+s1=0, but we might have s0=1 and s1=-1 -> then the code outputs -1? \n\n          This is a flaw.\n\n      Example: \n          Current: \n              row0: [1] \n              row1: [0]\n          Desired:\n              row0: [0]\n              row1: [1]\n\n          Then total ones: 1 in both.\n\n          Column0:\n              s0 = 1-0=1\n              s1 = 0-1=-1\n              then we do: \n                  while s0>0 and s1<0: \n                      ans=1, s0=0, s1=0.\n              then ans += 0 -> total=1.\n          Then at the end, s0=0, s1=0 -> output 1. \n\n          But the code outputs 1, which is correct.\n\n      Why? Because the vertical swap fixed the per-row totals? \n\n      But what if:\n\n          Current: \n              row0: [1,0] \n              row1: [0,0]\n          Desired:\n              row0: [0,0]\n              row1: [0,1]\n\n          Then at the end of the loop, s0=0, s1=0? \n\n          How? \n            Column0: \n                s0 = 1-0=1\n                s1 = 0-0=0 -> then ans += 1 (from abs(s0)) -> ans=1.\n            Column1:\n                s0 = 1 + (0-0)=1\n                s1 = 0 + (0-1)=-1\n                then we do: while s0>0 and s1<0: \n                    ans=2, s0=0, s1=0.\n                then ans += 0 -> total=2.\n            Then output 2.\n\n          But the desired arrangement is achieved? \n            We need to move the one from (0,0) to (1,1). \n            We can do: \n                swap (0,0) and (0,1): then row0: [0,1] -> then swap (0,1) and (1,1): then row0: [0,0], row1: [0,1] -> 2 swaps.\n\n          So 2 is correct.\n\n      Therefore, the condition at the end is: \n          if s0 != 0 or s1 != 0: then output -1.\n\n      But note: the entire matrix total is preserved, so s0+s1 must be zero. However, the algorithm might not be able to fix the arrangement if the cumulative differences are not fixed by the vertical swaps and the absolute value additions? \n\n      Actually, the algorithm always fixes the arrangement? \n\n      The known solution for the problem (from CodeForces) uses the same idea and passes.\n\n      Therefore, we complete the TODO in program2.py as:\n\n          while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n              ans += 1\n              s0 += 1\n              s1 -= 1\n\n      And the rest of the code remains.\n\n  However, note: the problem constraints: n up to 200000. The while loops might be inefficient? \n\n  But note: the total number of vertical swaps we do is at most the total imbalance? And the total imbalance is bounded by the total ones, which is at most 2*n. And the while loops in each column: the number of iterations per column is at most the imbalance in that column? But the cumulative s0 and s1 can be large? \n\n  Actually, the while loops might run many times in one column? \n\n  We can optimize by:\n\n        k = min(-s0, s1)   # in the second while loop: s0<0 and s1>0 -> then we can do k swaps at once.\n        ans += k\n        s0 += k\n        s1 -= k\n\n  But the provided code uses while loops. However, the constraints are 200000, and the total number of vertical swaps is at most the total ones, which is 200000? So the while loop overall runs at most 200000 times? \n\n  Actually, the entire while loops over all columns: the total number of vertical swaps is bounded by the total ones, which is at most 400000? So it is O(n). \n\n  Therefore, we can use the while loops.\n\n  But the problem says: n up to 200000, and the while loops in each column might run up to 200000 times in one column? Then worst-case total O(n^2). \n\n  Example: \n      We have 100000 columns with s0=100000 and s1=-100000 in the first column? Then the while loop runs 100000 times in the first column. Then the next columns are zero. -> total 100000, which is acceptable? \n\n  But 100000 is acceptable for n=200000? \n\n  However, worst-case total vertical swaps is 200000 (the total ones) so the while loops overall run at most 200000 times? \n\n  Actually, each vertical swap we do in the while loop corresponds to one actual swap we are counting. And the total number of swaps we count is the answer, which is at most 400000? \n\n  But the problem says minimal number of steps, which can be large? \n\n  However, the problem constraints: n up to 200000, and the answer can be up to 400000? Then we cannot do a while loop that runs 400000 times in one column? \n\n  We must optimize the while loops to O(1) per column.\n\n  Therefore, we change the while loops to:\n\n        if s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n            k = min(s0, -s1)\n            ans += k\n            s0 -= k\n            s1 += k\n        if s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            k = min(-s0, s1)\n            ans += k\n            s0 += k\n            s1 -= k\n\n  But the provided code structure uses two while loops. We are allowed to change the code? \n\n  The problem says: \"Complete the code in python\" and the TODO is only in the second while loop. \n\n  However, the first while loop might also be inefficient. \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  Since the TODO is only the second while loop, and the first while loop is already provided, we must complete the second while loop as a while loop? \n\n  But note: the constraints. The problem says n, m up to 100000 for program1, but for program2, n up to 200000. \n\n  The intended solution for program2 uses the while loops and the total number of iterations in the while loops is bounded by the total number of vertical swaps, which is bounded by the total ones, which is O(n). So overall O(n). \n\n  Therefore, we can use:\n\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 += 1\n            s1 -= 1\n\n  But worst-case, this loop might run 200000 times in one column? Then the entire program would be O(n^2) and n=200000 -> 200000^2 = 40e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n  Therefore, we must change the while loop to a batch operation. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". And the missing code is only the body of the while loop? \n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". \n\n  We are allowed to change the first while loop as well? But the first while loop is already provided. \n\n  Alternatively, we can replace both while loops with batch operations. But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  Since the entire block for the two while loops is not efficient, and the problem constraints require efficiency, we should change both. \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n  The missing code for program2.py is only the second while loop. \n\n  We are in a dilemma. \n\n  However, the problem note says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  And the example of the output format is: \n        {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n  We must complete the code as required. \n\n  Given the constraints, we must do the batch optimization. But the problem says the missing code is only the second while loop. \n\n  But note: the first while loop is already provided and we are not allowed to change it? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the TODO. \n\n  We can output for program2.py the entire for loop? But that is not missing. \n\n  Alternatively, we can output only the missing while loop body? \n\n  But the while loop body is:\n\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 += 1\n            s1 -= 1\n\n  And hope that the test cases are not worst-case? \n\n  But the constraints are high, so we must do batch. \n\n  Since the problem does not specify the efficiency, and the known solution in C++ might pass with while loops in O(n) total iterations, but in Python it might be borderline for 200000 iterations total (not per column) -> because the total number of vertical swaps is at most 200000, then the while loops overall run 200000 times. \n\n  How? \n      The total number of vertical swaps we do over the entire process is at most (total ones) which is <= 2*n, so 400000. \n\n  Therefore, the while loops overall run at most 400000 times, which is acceptable.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 += 1\n            s1 -= 1\n\n  And similarly for the first while loop, it is:\n\n        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 -= 1\n            s1 += 1\n\n  And then we add the absolute values.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 += 1\n            s1 -= 1\n\n  And we output that.\n\n  But note: the code after the while loops does: \n        ans += abs(s0) + abs(s1)\n\n  This is for the horizontal moves? \n\n  And the vertical moves are counted in the while loops.\n\n  So the entire solution is as described.\n\n  We output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py in the required JSON format.\n\n  Summary:\n\n      program1: \n          def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n            n = len(arr)\n            old_val = arr[i]\n            if old_val == x:\n                return curr_aws\n            if i > 0:\n                if arr[i-1] != old_val:\n                    curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\n                if arr[i-1] != x:\n                    curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n            if i < n-1:\n                if old_val != arr[i+1]:\n                    curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n                if x != arr[i+1]:\n                    curr_aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n            arr[i] = x\n            return curr_aws\n\n      But note: the function in program1.py is already defined, so we only output the body? Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python\", and the function body is missing. We output the entire function body? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n      The missing code for program1.py is the body of the function. We output the code that goes inside the function.\n\n      Similarly, for program2.py, the missing code is the body of the second while loop.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  For program1.py, the missing block is the entire body of the function (from the first line to the return).\n\n  For program2.py, the missing block is the body of the while loop.\n\n  But note: the program1.py code provided has:\n\n        def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We output the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \n          n = len(arr)\n          old_val = arr[i]\n          if old_val == x:\n              return curr_aws\n          if i > 0:\n              if arr[i-1] != old_val:\n                  curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\n              if arr[i-1] != x:\n                  curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n          if i < n-1:\n              if old_val != arr[i+1]:\n                  curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n              if x != arr[i+1]:\n                  curr_aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n          arr[i] = x\n          return curr_aws\n\n      program2:\n          while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n              ans += 1\n              s0 += 1\n              s1 -= 1\n\n  But note: the program2 code has:\n\n        while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we output the two lines: \"ans += 1\", \"s0 += 1\", \"s1 -= 1\", with proper indentation.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  We output in JSON.\n\n  Format:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"n = len(arr)\\nold_val = arr[i]\\nif old_val == x:\\n    return curr_aws\\nif i > 0:\\n    if arr[i-1] != old_val:\\n        curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\\n    if arr[i-1] != x:\\n        curr_aws += i * (n - i)\\nif i < n-1:\\n    if old_val != arr[i+1]:\\n        curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\\n    if x != arr[i+1]:\\n        curr_aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\\narr[i] = x\\nreturn curr_aws\",\n        \"program2\": \"ans += 1\\n            s0 += 1\\n            s1 -= 1\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program2 part: the while loop body should be three lines, and the indentation: the code is inside a for loop and then a while loop. We output the three lines with the same indentation as the first while loop? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation level. But the first while loop has:\n\n        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 -= 1\n            s1 += 1\n\n  So we output:\n\n        ans += 1\n        s0 += 1\n        s1 -= 1\n\n  with the same indentation (one level of 4 spaces per line).\n\n  But in the JSON string, we can use \\n and then the same indentation? \n\n  Alternatively, we can output without extra spaces? \n\n  Since the problem does not specify, we output without extra indentation beyond the existing code structure.\n\n  We output the three lines as:\n\n        \"ans += 1\\ns0 += 1\\ns1 -= 1\"\n\n  But the existing code has indentation. We must match the indentation level of the first while loop.\n\n  The first while loop in the provided code has:\n\n        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 -= 1\n            s1 += 1\n\n  So the body is indented by 4 spaces. We do the same.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"ans += 1\\n    s0 += 1\\n    s1 -= 1\"\n\n  But wait, the first while loop body has three lines, each with 4 spaces of indentation relative to the while. \n\n  Actually, the code is:\n\n        while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n            ans += 1\n            s0 -= 1\n            s1 += 1\n\n  So the three lines are at the same level. We output:\n\n        \"    ans += 1\\n    s0 += 1\\n    s1 -= 1\"\n\n  But that would be 8 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the while loop is already at a certain indentation level. The missing code is the body of the while loop, so we output the three lines with one level of indentation (4 spaces) relative to the while.\n\n  But the existing code for the first while loop body is written as:\n\n            ans += 1\n            s0 -= 1\n            s1 += 1\n\n  which is 12 spaces from the beginning of the line? \n\n  We don't need to worry about the absolute indentation, only the relative. \n\n  We output the three lines as:\n\n        \"    ans += 1\\n    s0 += 1\\n    s1 -= 1\"\n\n  But the existing code in the for loop is:\n\n        for m, n, p, q in zip(a, b, x, y):\n            s0 += m\n            s0 -= p\n            s1 += n\n            s1 -= q\n            while s0 > 0 and s1 < 0:\n                ans += 1\n                s0 -= 1\n                s1 += 1\n            while s0 < 0 and s1 > 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So the while loop body should be indented by 8 spaces (relative to the for loop body which is 4 spaces). \n\n  We output for the second while loop body:\n\n        \"        ans += 1\\n        s0 += 1\\n        s1 -= 1\"\n\n  But that is 8 spaces per line? \n\n  Actually, the first while loop body is written with 8 spaces of indentation? \n\n  The entire code:\n\n        for ...:\n            ... (indented 4 spaces)\n            while ...:\n                ans ...   (indented 8 spaces)\n\n  So we output for the body of the second while loop: three lines, each starting with 8 spaces? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the three lines of code that go inside the while loop. The existing code has the while loop at a certain indentation level. We output the three lines with the same indentation as the first while loop body.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"        ans += 1\\n        s0 += 1\\n        s1 -= 1\"\n\n  But note: the first while loop body is written as:\n\n                ans += 1\n                s0 -= 1\n                s1 += 1\n\n  which is 8 spaces of indentation (if we count from the for loop). \n\n  So we do the same.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output without specifying the absolute indentation? The problem does not require the absolute indentation, but the code must run.\n\n  We output the three lines with the same relative indentation as the first while loop body.\n\n  Since the problem does not specify, we use 4 spaces per indent level. The while loop is at one indent level (4 spaces) inside the for loop, so the body is at two indent levels (8 spaces).\n\n  Therefore, the final output:\n\n      program1: \n          \"n = len(arr)\\nold_val = arr[i]\\nif old_val == x:\\n    return curr_aws\\nif i > 0:\\n    if arr[i-1] != old_val:\\n        curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\\n    if arr[i-1] != x:\\n        curr_aws += i * (n - i)\\nif i < n-1:\\n    if old_val != arr[i+1]:\\n        curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\\n    if x != arr[i+1]:\\n        curr_aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\\narr[i] = x\\nreturn curr_aws\"\n\n      program2: \n          \"        ans += 1\\n        s0 += 1\\n        s1 -= 1\"\n\n  But note: the program1 code: we have to be careful with the multiplication: i*(n-i) and (i+1)*(n-i-1). We wrote it without spaces.\n\n  This should be fine.\n\n  Let's hope."
