Step 1: not one distinct -> skip. Step 2: check adjacent: \n                'a' and 'b' -> not duplicate -> then 'b' and 'a' -> not duplicate -> so no adjacent duplicates. Step 3: \n                For b='a': split by 'a' -> ['', 'b', ''] -> segment 'b' -> distinct? yes (only one character). For b='b': split by 'b' -> ['a','a'] -> segment 'a' (first) -> distinct? yes; segment 'a' (last) -> distinct? yes. Then we output YES -> which is correct. But what about \"abac\": \n            distinct = {'a','b','c'}\n            Step 2: no adjacent duplicates? a->b: ok, b->a: ok, a->c: ok -> so no adjacent duplicates.

So we can write: if len(set(seg)) < len(seg): But it's the same. We'll use the above.

Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: \"aba\" -> \n                distinct = {'a','b'}\n                Step 2: no adjacent duplicates -> proceed. For b='a': split -> ['', 'b', ''] -> segments: only 'b' -> distinct -> no problem. For b='b': split -> ['a','a'] -> segments: 'a' and 'a' -> both distinct -> so YES.\n\n            Example 2: \"abb\" -> \n                distinct = {'a','b'}\n                Step 2: adjacent duplicates: at index1 and 2: 'b' and 'b' -> so we output NO.\n\n            Example 3: \"abc\" -> \n                distinct = {'a','b','c'}\n                Step 2: no adjacent duplicates. For b='a': split -> ['','bc'] -> segment 'bc': distinct -> yes. For b='b': split -> ['a','c'] -> both segments distinct -> yes. For b='c': split -> ['ab',''] -> segment 'ab': distinct -> yes -> YES. Example 4: \"aaba\" (which we know fails) -> \n                Step 2: adjacent duplicates: at index0 and 1: 'a' and 'a' -> NO.\n\n          Example 5: \"abac\" -> \n                Step 2: no adjacent duplicates? a->b: no, b->a: no, a->c: no -> so proceed. For b='a': split -> ['','b','c'] -> segments: 'b' and 'c' -> distinct -> ok. For b='b': split -> ['a','ac'] -> segment 'a' -> distinct; segment 'ac' -> distinct? \n                    set('ac') = {'a','c'} -> length=2, and len('ac')=2 -> distinct -> ok.\n                For b='c': split -> ['aba',''] -> segment 'aba': \n                    set('aba') = {'a','b'} -> length=2, but len('aba')=3 -> not distinct -> so we output NO.

But note: worst-case, if the string is long (like 200,000) and has 26 distinct characters, then we do 26 splits. Each split is O(n). So 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6 per test case?",

Step 2: i=0: s[0]=='a', s[1]=='a' -> adj_dup = True -> output \"NO\". But the entire string \"aa\" has only one distinct character? Actually, step1: distinct = {'a'} -> so we output \"YES\".

The third test case: 5 candies: [1,2,3,4,5] -> output 0. So the algorithm for program1.py:\n\n                  We are trying to simulate:\n\n                    We start with no candies eaten (s1=0, s2=0) -> then we record 0 candies? Then we let Alice eat the first candy -> s1=10, p1=1 -> then we check: s1>s2 -> then we let Bob eat the last candy: s2=10, p2=1 -> then we check: s1==s2 -> record: p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (3-1-1) = 1+1 = 2 -> then we let Alice eat the next? but then p1 becomes 2, and then we break? Actually, the while condition: \n                      After the first record: \n                         s1=10, s2=0 -> then we do the next if: s1>s2 -> so we do s2 += l[2] (which is 10) -> p2 becomes 1 -> then we break the condition? Then we check: \n                         if s1==s2: 10==10 -> then we record: p1 (which is 1) + (n-1-p2)= (3-1-1)=1 -> total=2 -> then we update: s1 += l[1] -> s1=10+20=30, p1=2. Then condition: p1-1=1 <= p2=1 -> true. Then we check: \n                         s1=30, s2=10 -> then we do the third if: s2 < s1 -> s2 += l[1] (which is the candy at index1? but Bob is at index1? and the array is [10,20,10] -> l[1]=20) -> s2=10+20=30, p2=0. Then condition: p1-1=1 <= p2=0 -> true? 1<=0 -> false? -> break. Then we print l2[-1] = 2. So it matches. Now, what to do when s1 < s2? Example: \n                    We have: \n                      s1=10, s2=0 -> then we update Alice: s1=10, then we check: s1>s2 -> so we update Bob: s2=10, p2=1 -> then we break? But then we check the condition again: \n                      if s1==s2: then we record and then update Alice: s1=10+20=30, p1=2 -> then condition: p1-1=1<=p2=1 -> true. Now: s1=30, s2=10 -> s1>s2 -> so we update Bob: s2=10+20=30, p2=0 -> then condition: 1<=0 -> false -> break. Then we output the last record: 2. But what if we have a situation where after updating Alice, s1 is still less than s2? Example: \n                    n=4, weights: [1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n                  Steps:\n\n                    p1=0, p2=3, s1=0, s2=0 -> s1==s2: record 0 + (4-1-3)=0 -> then update: s1=1, p1=1. Then condition: p1-1=0<=p2=3 -> true. Now: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2. Then condition: 0<=2 -> true. Now: s1=1, s2=3 -> s1<s2 -> what do we do?",

That is: p1 <= p2? But the condition is p1-1<=p2. Why not use p1<=p2? Let me simulate with n=1:\n\n                    p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: p1-1=-1<=0 -> true. Then we do: \n                         s1==s2 -> record 0, then update Alice: s1=w0, p1=1. Then condition: p1-1=0<=p2=0 -> true. Then we check: \n                         s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=w0, p2=-1. Then condition: 0<=-1 -> false -> break. Then output 0. If we use p1<=p2: \n                    Initially: p1=0, p2=0 -> true. Then update Alice: p1=1 -> then condition: 1<=0 -> false -> break -> then we output 0. But we missed the chance to update Bob? Actually, after updating Alice, we have s1=w0, s2=0 -> then we should update Bob? But the condition of the while loop is checked at the beginning of each iteration. We need to do:\n\n                    while p1<=p2: \n                        if s1==s2: record and then update Alice? then if s1<=s2: update Alice? \n                        then if s1>=s2: update Bob? But that might not be symmetric. Alternatively, we can do: while p1 <= p2:\n                        if s1 == s2:\n                            record the current total: p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                        if s1 <= s2:\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:\n                            s2 += l[p2]\n                            p2 -= 1\n\n                  Then for n=1:\n                    p1=0, p2=0 -> true. s1==s2 (0==0) -> record: 0 + (1-1-0)=0. then if s1<=s2 -> true -> s1=l[0], p1=1. then condition: p1=1, p2=0 -> false -> break. output 0. Then for the example: [10,20,10] (n=3)\n\n                    p1=0, p2=2 -> true. s1=0, s2=0 -> record: 0 + (3-1-2)=0 -> then update Alice: s1=10, p1=1. condition: p1=1<=p2=2 -> true. s1=10, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=10, p2=1. condition: 1<=1 -> true. s1=10, s2=10 -> record: 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then update Alice: s1=10+20=30, p1=2. condition: 2<=1 -> false -> break. output 2. But what if we have [1,1,1,3]?\n\n                    p1=0, p2=3 -> true. s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> update Alice: s1=1, p1=1. condition: 1<=3 -> true. s1=1, s2=0 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2. condition: 1<=2 -> true. s1=1, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=1+1=2, p1=2. condition: 2<=2 -> true. s1=2, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=2+1=3, p1=3. condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break. Then we output the last record? but we recorded 0 and 2? and we output 2? But we recorded at the moment when s1==s2: \n                    first: 0\n                    then: when s1=10 and s2=10 -> recorded 2? then we did not record again. How do we record the maximum?",

When did we have s1==s2 again? After updating Alice to p1=3: s1=3, s2=3 -> we should record: p1 + (n-1-p2) = 3 + (4-1-2)=3+1=4. But we did not record because we updated Alice in the same iteration? The algorithm above:\n\n                    while p1<=p2:\n                        if s1==s2: \n                            record = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # we record the current total\n                        if s1<=s2:\n                            update Alice\n                        else:\n                            update Bob\n\n                  But note: after recording, we update Alice (because s1<=s2) and then we break the condition? We should record every time s1==s2. In the example [1,1,1,3]:\n\n                    Iteration0: p1=0, p2=3 -> s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then update Alice: s1=1, p1=1. Iteration1: p1=1, p2=3 -> s1=1, s2=0 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2. Iteration2: p1=1, p2=2 -> s1=1, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=2, p1=2. Iteration3: p1=2, p2=2 -> s1=2, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=3, p1=3. Iteration4: p1=3, p2=2 -> condition fails. We did not record the state (s1=3, s2=3) because when we had s1=3 and s2=3, we were not in the loop? Actually, we updated Alice to s1=3 and p1=3 at iteration3, then the next iteration: p1=3, p2=2 -> condition p1<=p2 -> 3<=2 -> false -> break. How to capture the state when s1==s2 at the end? We can record after the loop? Alternatively, we can change the condition to:\n\n                    while p1<=p2:\n                        if s1 == s2:\n                            # record\n                            l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n                        if s1 <= s2:\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:\n                            s2 += l[p2]\n                            p2 -= 1\n\n                  But then we record at the beginning of the iteration. In the example [1,1,1,3]:\n\n                    Iteration0: p1=0, p2=3 -> s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then update Alice: s1=1, p1=1. Iteration1: p1=1, p2=3 -> s1=1, s2=0 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2. Iteration2: p1=1, p2=2 -> s1=1, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=2, p1=2. Iteration3: p1=2, p2=2 -> s1=2, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=3, p1=3. Iteration4: p1=3, p2=2 -> condition fails -> break. We did not record the state (3,3) because we never had s1==s2 again. But when we update Alice to s1=3, we have s1=3 and s2=3? -> no, s2 is still 3? Actually, after iteration3: \n                    s1=3, s2=3? -> no, s2 is 3 and s1 becomes 3 -> but we are at the next iteration? We need to record at the moment when s1==s2, but we are updating and then moving to the next iteration.",

Then: s1==s2 -> record 0, then update Alice: s1=l[0], p1=1. Then we do the next if: if p1-1>p2? -> 0>0 -> false. Then if s1 < s2? -> s1=l[0], s2=0 -> false. Then if s2 < s1: true -> update Bob: s2=l[0], p2=-1. Then the iteration ends. Then condition at the next iteration: p1-1=0<=p2=-1 -> false -> break. Then output l2[-1]=0. But we updated Bob even though there was no candy? The candy at p2=0 was already eaten by Alice? How can Bob eat it? This is a problem.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are guaranteed that the total length of all strings is <= 200,000.\n The key observation: \n The condition must hold for every substring t and every pair of characters (u, v). \n However, note that the problem states that the string s is perfectly balanced if for every non-empty substring t and for every two characters u and v that appear in s, the absolute difference |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n But note: the condition must hold for every pair of characters that are present in the entire string s? Actually, the problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\". However, note that in a substring t, the characters u and v might not appear? But the condition is only for u and v that are present in s (so even if they are not in t, we still consider?).\n\n However, let's read: \"the difference between the frequencies of u and v in t\" \u2014 if u is not in t, then f_t(u)=0. Similarly for v.\n\n Therefore, the condition must hold for every non-empty substring t and every pair of distinct characters (u, v) that appear anywhere in s.\n\n But note: the problem does not require the condition for pairs (u,v) that are not both present in s? Actually, it says \"u and v are characters present in s\". So we consider every pair (u,v) of characters that are in the entire string s, and for every substring t, we require |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\n However, consider: if a character u does not appear in t, then f_t(u)=0. So if in the entire string s there are two distinct characters, say 'a' and 'b', then for every substring t we must have |f_t('a') - f_t('b')| <= 1.\n\n This is a very strong condition.\n\n Let's think: \n Example: \"aba\" -> works as in the example.\n\n But what about \"aab\"? \n   Entire string s: has 'a' and 'b'. \n   Consider substring \"aa\": \n        f_t('a') = 2, f_t('b') = 0 -> |2-0| = 2 -> which is >1 -> so \"aab\" is not balanced.\n\n Similarly, \"abb\" fails as in the example.\n\n Therefore, the condition fails if there is any substring that has two of one letter and zero of another that appears in the entire string.\n\n How about \"abc\"? \n   The entire string has 'a','b','c'. \n   Consider substring \"a\": \n        a:1, b:0, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n        |1-0|=1 for a and c -> okay.\n        |0-0|=0 for b and c -> okay.\n   Similarly, \"ab\": a:1, b:1, c:0 -> |1-1|=0, |1-0|=1, |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n   \"abc\": a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n   \"b\": a:0, b:1, c:0 -> |0-1|=1 -> okay.\n   \"bc\": a:0, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n   \"c\": okay.\n\n So \"abc\" is okay.\n\n How about \"aabb\"? \n   Entire string: has 'a','b'\n   Consider substring \"aa\": |a:2, b:0| -> 2>1 -> fails.\n\n Therefore, we can deduce that the condition fails if there exists a contiguous substring that has two of one letter and zero of another letter that appears in the entire string.\n\n But note: the entire string might have more than two distinct characters? However, the condition must hold for every pair of distinct characters that appear in s.\n\n Therefore, if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then we must avoid having any contiguous substring that has two of one character and zero of another.\n\n However, note that the condition must hold for every pair. So if the string has three distinct characters, then we must avoid:\n   In any substring, for every pair (u,v): |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n How about \"aabc\"? \n   Entire string: 'a','b','c'\n   Consider substring \"aa\": \n        a:2, b:0, c:0 -> \n          |2-0| = 2 for (a,b) -> fails.\n\n Therefore, the condition is very strong: in fact, the only strings that satisfy the condition are those that do not contain any contiguous block of the same character of length 2? Actually, no: because \"aba\" is okay and has two a's but they are not contiguous? \n\n However, note: in \"aba\", the substring \"aba\" has two a's and one b -> |2-1|=1 -> okay. But what about the substring \"a\" (the first one): \n        a:1, b:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n        the substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n        the substring \"ba\": a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n\n But what if we have \"aaba\": \n   Entire string: 'a','b'\n   Substring \"aa\": a:2, b:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n Therefore, we can see that the condition fails if there is a contiguous segment of two identical characters? Actually, not necessarily contiguous? Because the substring doesn't have to be contiguous? Wait, substring is contiguous by definition.\n\n So the problem reduces to: \n   For the entire string s, let the distinct characters be set D.\n   For every contiguous substring t and every pair (u,v) in D, we must have |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n How can we check this without enumerating all substrings? (which is O(n^2))\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n Consider the following: \n   The condition must hold for every contiguous substring. In particular, it must hold for every contiguous substring of length 2: \n        For any two adjacent characters, say x and y, we must have |f_t(x)-f_t(y)|<=1? \n        But note: in a substring of length 2, if the two characters are the same, then we have two of one and zero of the other? \n        Example: \"aa\": then for the pair (a, b) [if b is in the entire string] we have |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n Therefore, if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then we cannot have two identical adjacent characters? \n\n However, what if the entire string has only one distinct character? \n   Then the set D has only one character. Then we don't have any pair? \n   The problem says: \"u and v are characters present in s\" \u2014 but if there is only one, then there is no pair? \n   So the condition is vacuously true? \n\n But note: the problem says \"for all possible triplets (t, u, v)\" \u2014 if there are no pairs (u,v) (because we need two distinct characters) then the condition holds? \n\n Therefore, for a string with only one distinct character, it is perfectly balanced.\n\n Now, what if the string has at least two distinct characters? \n   Then we must avoid having two identical adjacent characters? \n   But also, what about longer substrings? \n\n Consider: \"aba\" -> okay, but \"abc\" -> okay, but \"abac\" -> \n   Entire string: 'a','b','c'\n   Check substring \"aa\": we don't have \"aa\" as contiguous? Actually, we have \"aba\" and then 'c'. The substring \"aa\" does not appear? \n   However, what about \"abac\": \n        substring \"a\" (first): a:1, b:0, c:0 -> |1-0|<=1 -> okay.\n        substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> okay.\n        substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1, c:0 -> \n            |2-1|=1 (a and b) -> okay.\n            |2-0|=2 (a and c) -> fails.\n\n Therefore, we see that even without two adjacent identical characters, we can have a problem.\n\n How about \"abc\": \n   The distinct set is {'a','b','c'}.\n   The substring \"a\": a:1, b:0, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n   The substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n   The substring \"abc\": a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n   The substring \"b\": a:0, b:1, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n   The substring \"bc\": a:0, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n   The substring \"c\": okay.\n\n So \"abc\" is okay.\n\n How about \"abac\": \n   substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1, c:0 -> |2-0|=2 for (a,c) -> fails.\n\n Therefore, we see that if we have two occurrences of a letter and then a different letter and then a letter that is the same as the first, we get a problem.\n\n How about \"abaca\": \n   substring \"a\" (first): okay.\n   substring \"ab\": okay.\n   substring \"aba\": a:2, b:1, c:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n So the problem is: if we have two a's and in between we have a non-empty string that does not contain a? Actually, no: the substring \"aba\" has two a's and one b, and then we have a c that hasn't appeared? But note: the entire string has 'c', so we must consider.\n\n Therefore, we can deduce that the condition fails if there exists a contiguous substring that has two of one character and zero of another character that appears in the entire string.\n\n How to check for this without iterating over all substrings? \n\n Note: the total length of all strings is <= 200,000.\n\n We can try to use the following:\n\n   If the string has only one distinct character -> YES.\n\n   Otherwise, we must check that for every distinct character c, we never have two occurrences of c with no occurrence of some other distinct character d in between? \n\n But note: the condition might be broken by a substring that has two of one character and zero of another, but the two of the same character might not be consecutive? \n\n However, consider: \n   We have a substring that has two a's and zero b's (where b is some distinct character in the entire string). \n   Then the two a's must be in the substring and there is no b in between? Actually, if there is a b in between, then the substring that we take might skip the b? \n\n But note: the substring is contiguous. So if we have two a's and between them there is a b, then if we take the substring from the first a to the second a, then that substring contains the b. Then the frequency of b is at least 1. So then |f_t(a)-f_t(b)| = |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n Therefore, the problem only arises when we have two of the same character and between them there is no occurrence of some other distinct character? Actually, no: because we might have two a's and then later a b, but we can take a substring that ends at the second a and doesn't include the b? Then that substring has two a's and zero b's -> fails.\n\n So the condition fails if there exists a distinct character b and two indices i<j such that:\n   s[i] = s[j] = a (a is any character, and a might equal b? but we are considering distinct b? Actually, we are considering a pair (a,b) with a != b) \n   and in the substring s[i:j+1] (from i to j) there is no occurrence of b? \n   But note: the entire string has the character b, but we are taking a substring that does not include any b? \n\n However, we can also take a substring that does not include b? Then we have two a's and zero b's -> |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n Therefore, the condition fails if for some distinct character b (which is present in the entire string) and for some character a (which might be the same as b? but we are considering distinct a and b? Actually, we are considering a pair of distinct characters) we have a contiguous substring that has two a's and no b? \n\n But note: the condition must hold for every pair (u,v). So if we have two a's and no b in a substring, then the pair (a,b) fails.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid: for every distinct pair (a,b) and for every two a's that are consecutive (or with no b in between) ... but note: if the two a's are separated by other characters that are not b, then we can take a substring that starts at the first a and ends at the second a and skips the other non-b characters? Then that substring has two a's and zero b's -> fails.\n\n So the condition fails if there exists a distinct pair (a,b) and two indices i<j such that:\n   s[i] = s[j] = a, and in the entire segment [i, j] there is no b.\n\n How to check this for all pairs? The distinct pairs might be O(26^2) which is 650, but the total length of all strings is 200,000. However, we cannot iterate over all pairs and then over all pairs of indices.\n\n Alternate Insight:\n\n The condition must hold for every contiguous substring. In particular, the condition must hold for every contiguous substring of length 1, 2, and 3.\n\n We already know that for length 1: \n        For any character c, the substring has one c and 0 for others -> so for any other character d, |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n\n For length 2: \n        If the two characters are the same: then we have two of one and zero of the others -> fails if there is at least one other distinct character in the entire string.\n        If they are different: then we have one of each -> |1-1|=0 and |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n\n For length 3:\n        The possible patterns:\n          aaa: fails (because for any other character d, |3-0|=3)\n          aab: \n             For the entire string: if there is a third character c, then we must check: \n                 substring \"aab\": \n                    a:2, b:1, c:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n                 But if the entire string has only a and b? \n                    Then we only have a and b: \n                         |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n          aba: \n             Entire string: if has a and b and possibly others? \n                 substring \"aba\": \n                    a:2, b:1, and for any other character c:0 -> |2-0|=2 -> fails if there is a third character? \n                 But the entire string might have a third character? \n                 However, note: the entire string might be \"aba\" -> then distinct set is {a,b}. Then we don't have c. So we only check pairs (a,b): |2-1|=1 -> okay.\n\n          abb: similar to aab -> if the entire string has only a and b, then |1-2|=1 -> okay; but if there is a third character, then |0-2|=2 in the substring \"bb\" (which is of length 2) -> already fails.\n\n          abc: \n             Entire string: if has a,b,c -> then |1-1|=0 for every pair -> okay.\n             But if the entire string has more than these three? Then we have a fourth character d? Then in the substring \"abc\", we have d:0 -> then |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n\n Therefore, we see:\n\n   The condition fails if:\n     1. There is a contiguous substring of two identical characters and the entire string has at least two distinct characters? \n        Actually, if the entire string has exactly two distinct characters, then two identical adjacent characters: \n            substring \"aa\": then for the other character b, |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n        So two adjacent identical characters always fail if the entire string has at least two distinct characters.\n\n     2. Also, we saw that even without adjacent identical characters, we can have a problem in a substring of length 3: \n          Example: \"aba\" when the entire string has a third character? \n          But note: the entire string \"aba\" has only two distinct characters? \n          How about \"abac\" (which has three distinct characters) and the substring \"aba\" (which has two a's and one b, and no c) -> fails.\n\n        So we must avoid: \n          For any two distinct characters a and b, and for any occurrence of a, then the next occurrence of a must not have a gap that does not include every other distinct character? \n\n        Actually, the condition fails if there is a character a and two indices i<j such that s[i]=s[j]=a and between i and j there is at least one distinct character that does not appear? \n\n        But note: we don't require every distinct character to appear? We require that for every distinct character b (that is in the entire string) we must have at least one occurrence in the substring? \n\n        That is too strong: because then the entire string would have to have every distinct character in every contiguous substring? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: for the substring t, and for every distinct character b in the entire string, the frequency of b in t must be within 1 of the frequency of a in t? \n\n        So if the entire string has a character b that does not appear in the substring t, then we require |f_t(a) - 0| <= 1 -> so f_t(a) must be 0 or 1. \n\n        Therefore, if we have a substring t that has two a's and the entire string has a distinct character b that does not appear in t, then we have |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n\n        So the condition fails if there exists a contiguous substring t and a distinct character b (that appears in the entire string) such that b does not appear in t and t has at least two of some character a.\n\n        How to check for this? \n\n        We can use the following: \n          The condition fails if there exists a contiguous substring t that does not contain a particular character b (which is in the entire string) and that has at least two of some character a.\n\n        But note: we must check for every b? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n          The condition fails if there exists a character b and two indices i<j such that the contiguous substring from i to j does not contain b and has at least two of some character a.\n\n        How to check without iterating over all b and all i,j? \n\n        We can try to fix the character b that is missing. Then we break the string into contiguous segments that do not contain b. Then in each contiguous segment (which is b-free), we must not have two of the same character? \n\n        Why? Because if in a contiguous segment (without b) we have two a's, then we can take the substring that is the entire segment? or a part of it that has two a's? \n\n        Actually, if we have two a's in a contiguous segment without b, then we can take the minimal contiguous substring that contains these two a's and no b -> then that substring has two a's and zero b's -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, for each character b, we split the string by b, and then in each contiguous segment (without b) we check that all characters are distinct? \n\n        But note: the segment might be long, but if we have two identical characters in the same segment, then we have two of that character and no b -> fails.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n          Step 1: If the entire string has only one distinct character -> YES.\n\n          Step 2: Check for any adjacent identical characters? Actually, if we have two adjacent identical characters, then the substring of these two is a contiguous segment without any other character? and it has two of that character. Then if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then there is at least one character b (different from that character) that is missing in that substring -> fails.\n\n          But note: the adjacent identical characters form a contiguous substring of length 2 without the other character? -> fails.\n\n          Therefore, we can first check: \n            for i in range(n-1):\n                if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n            But note: what if the entire string has only one distinct character? Then we skip step 2? Actually, step 1 already handled that.\n\n          However, we also have the case of non-adjacent identical characters? \n\n          Step 3: For each distinct character b in the string, we split the string by b and get contiguous segments. Then for each segment, we check if there is any duplicate character in that segment? \n\n          How to do that? We can do:\n\n            total_chars = set(s)   # distinct characters in the entire string\n\n            for b in total_chars:\n                # split the string by b, but note: we remove b and get contiguous segments of non-b\n                segments = s.split(b)\n                for seg in segments:\n                    # if the segment has duplicate characters? \n                    # we can check: if len(seg) > len(set(seg)):\n                    #   then we have duplicate -> return \"NO\"\n                    pass\n\n          But note: the entire string might be long, but the total length of all strings is 200,000. However, the splitting for each distinct character: the total distinct characters per string is at most 26. And the total length of all segments over all splits is: for each string, we are splitting by each distinct character. The total length of the string is n, and we are doing 26 splits per string? Then the total work per string is 26 * (n) -> which is 26 * (n). And the total n over test cases is 200,000 -> 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6 -> acceptable.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is <= 200,000. So we can do:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check adjacent duplicates: \n                if any(s[i] == s[i+1] for i in range(len(s)-1)):\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Now, we need to check for non-adjacent duplicates in the same segment without a particular character?\n                # But note: we already checked adjacent duplicates, so no two adjacent are the same. \n                # However, we might have non-adjacent duplicates? \n\n                # Now, for each distinct character b, we split the string by b and check each segment for duplicates.\n\n                flag = False\n                for b in distinct:\n                    # Split the string by b -> we get a list of segments (without b)\n                    segments = s.split(b)\n                    for seg in segments:\n                        # In the segment, if there is any duplicate? \n                        # Since the segment is contiguous and we have no adjacent duplicates? \n                        # But non-adjacent duplicates: \n                        #   Example: \"acac\" -> if we split by 'b', we get the whole string? \n                        #   But wait, we are splitting by b. If the segment is \"acac\", then we have two 'a' and two 'c'. \n                        #   We need to check if there is a duplicate? Actually, we don't have adjacent duplicates, but we have non-adjacent? \n                        #   However, the condition fails if in the segment there is a duplicate? \n                        #   But note: the segment \"acac\" has two a's and two c's. Then we can take the entire segment? \n                        #   Then for the entire segment, we have two a's and two c's -> but what about the missing b? \n                        #   The entire segment does not contain b. Then for the pair (a,b): |2-0|=2 -> fails.\n                        #   So we must check: if in the segment there is any character that appears at least twice? \n                        #   How? We can check: if len(seg) > len(set(seg)): then there is a duplicate.\n\n                        if len(seg) > len(set(seg)):\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            flag = True\n                            break\n                    if flag:\n                        break\n                if flag:\n                    continue\n\n                # If we get here, then for every b and every segment, there are no duplicates -> then the string is balanced?\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n          But wait: what if the segment has three distinct characters? \n            Example: \"acbd\" -> if we split by b, we get [\"ac\", \"d\"] -> both segments have distinct characters -> okay.\n\n          However, what about the entire string? \n            The entire string has a,b,c,d. \n            Consider the substring \"ac\": \n                a:1, c:1, b:0, d:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n            But what about the substring \"acb\": \n                a:1, c:1, b:1, d:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n            And \"acbd\": all 1 -> okay.\n\n          But what about a more complex example: \n            s = \"acd\"\n            distinct = {'a','c','d'}\n            Check for adjacent duplicates: none.\n\n            Check for each b in distinct:\n                b='a': split by 'a' -> ['', 'cd'] -> segment '' (skip) and segment 'cd': distinct? yes -> okay.\n                b='c': split by 'c' -> ['a','d'] -> distinct? yes -> okay.\n                b='d': split by 'd' -> ['ac',''] -> segment 'ac': distinct? yes -> okay.\n\n            So we output \"YES\".\n\n          However, consider the substring \"acd\": \n                a:1, c:1, d:1 -> okay.\n\n          But what about the substring \"a\": \n                a:1, c:0, d:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n\n          So it is okay.\n\n          But what about: s = \"acda\"\n            distinct = {'a','c','d'}\n            Check adjacent duplicates: no adjacent duplicates? \n            Now, split by 'a': -> ['', 'cd', ''] -> segment 'cd': distinct? yes.\n            split by 'c': -> ['a','da'] -> segment 'da': distinct? yes? \n            split by 'd': -> ['ac','a'] -> segment 'ac': distinct? yes; segment 'a': distinct? yes.\n\n            So we output \"YES\".\n\n          However, consider the substring \"acda\": \n                a:2, c:1, d:1 -> then for the pair (a,c): |2-1|=1 -> okay; (a,d): |2-1|=1 -> okay; (c,d): |1-1|=0 -> okay.\n\n          But what about the substring \"a\" (the last one): \n                a:1, c:0, d:0 -> okay.\n\n          And the substring \"acd\": \n                a:1, c:1, d:1 -> okay.\n\n          And the substring \"cda\": \n                a:1, c:1, d:1 -> okay.\n\n          But wait: what about the substring that is the entire string? \n                a:2, c:1, d:1 -> okay.\n\n          However, what about the substring \"aa\"? \n            We have two a's? But they are not contiguous? \n            The substring \"aa\" is not contiguous? Actually, the two a's are at index0 and index3. The substring from index0 to index3 is \"acda\", which has two a's and one c and one d. \n            But we can take a substring that is only the two a's? That would be non contiguous? No, contiguous substring must be consecutive. \n\n          Therefore, the substring \"aa\" is not contiguous. The contiguous substrings that start at the first a and end at the last a is \"acda\", which has two a's but also has c and d. \n\n          How about a substring that is the first a and the last a without the middle? That is not contiguous.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot have a contiguous substring that is \"aa\" because the two a's are separated.\n\n          But note: the condition fails only if we have a contiguous substring that has two a's and zero of some other distinct character? \n\n          In the entire string, the distinct characters are a,c,d. \n          Consider the substring that is the first a: \n             a:1, c:0, d:0 -> okay.\n          The substring that is the last a: \n             a:1, c:0, d:0 -> okay.\n\n          There is no contiguous substring that has two a's and zero of c? because any contiguous substring that has two a's must include the entire string from the first a to the last a, which includes c and d.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm might be:\n\n            Step 1: If the entire string has only one distinct character -> YES.\n            Step 2: Check for any adjacent duplicate characters -> if found, NO.\n            Step 3: For each distinct character b, split the string by b and in each segment check that the segment has distinct characters (i.e., no duplicate in the segment) -> if any segment has duplicates, then NO.\n            Step 4: Otherwise, YES.\n\n          But note: what if the string is \"aba\" (with distinct characters {'a','b'})? \n            Step 1: not one distinct -> skip.\n            Step 2: check adjacent: \n                'a' and 'b' -> not duplicate -> then 'b' and 'a' -> not duplicate -> so no adjacent duplicates.\n            Step 3: \n                For b='a': split by 'a' -> ['', 'b', ''] -> segment 'b' -> distinct? yes (only one character).\n                For b='b': split by 'b' -> ['a','a'] -> segment 'a' (first) -> distinct? yes; segment 'a' (last) -> distinct? yes.\n            Then we output YES -> which is correct.\n\n          But what about \"abac\": \n            distinct = {'a','b','c'}\n            Step 2: no adjacent duplicates? \n                a->b: ok, b->a: ok, a->c: ok -> so no adjacent duplicates.\n            Step 3: \n                For b='a': split -> ['', 'b', 'c'] -> segments: 'b' (distinct), 'c' (distinct) -> ok.\n                For b='b': split -> ['a','ac'] -> segment 'a' (ok), segment 'ac': distinct? yes -> ok.\n                For b='c': split -> ['aba',''] -> segment 'aba': \n                    Check: 'aba' -> has 'a','b','a' -> duplicates? \n                    set('aba') = {'a','b'} -> length=2, but len('aba')=3 -> duplicates -> so we output NO.\n\n          This matches: because we found a segment (when splitting by 'c') that has duplicates -> NO.\n\n          Therefore, the code:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                distinct = set(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check adjacent duplicates\n                adj_dup = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        adj_dup = True\n                        break\n                if adj_dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check for each distinct character b\n                flag = False\n                for b in distinct:\n                    segments = s.split(b)\n                    for seg in segments:\n                        if seg == \"\":\n                            continue\n                        # Check if seg has duplicate characters?\n                        if len(seg) != len(set(seg)):\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            flag = True\n                            break\n                    if flag:\n                        break\n                if not flag:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n          However, note: the split method will remove all occurrences of b. But what if the segment is long? \n\n          But note: the total length of the segments for one split is n (because we remove b, so the sum of the lengths of the segments is n - (number of b's)). And we are doing at most 26 splits per test case. And the total n over test cases is 200,000 -> so total work is 26 * (sum of n over test cases) = 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6 -> acceptable.\n\n          Let's test with the provided examples:\n\n            Example 1: \"aba\" -> \n                distinct = {'a','b'}\n                Step 2: no adjacent duplicates -> proceed.\n                For b='a': split -> ['', 'b', ''] -> segments: only 'b' -> distinct -> no problem.\n                For b='b': split -> ['a','a'] -> segments: 'a' and 'a' -> both distinct -> so YES.\n\n            Example 2: \"abb\" -> \n                distinct = {'a','b'}\n                Step 2: adjacent duplicates: at index1 and 2: 'b' and 'b' -> so we output NO.\n\n            Example 3: \"abc\" -> \n                distinct = {'a','b','c'}\n                Step 2: no adjacent duplicates.\n                For b='a': split -> ['','bc'] -> segment 'bc': distinct -> yes.\n                For b='b': split -> ['a','c'] -> both segments distinct -> yes.\n                For b='c': split -> ['ab',''] -> segment 'ab': distinct -> yes -> YES.\n\n          Example 4: \"aaba\" (which we know fails) -> \n                Step 2: adjacent duplicates: at index0 and 1: 'a' and 'a' -> NO.\n\n          Example 5: \"abac\" -> \n                Step 2: no adjacent duplicates? \n                    a->b: no, b->a: no, a->c: no -> so proceed.\n                For b='a': split -> ['','b','c'] -> segments: 'b' and 'c' -> distinct -> ok.\n                For b='b': split -> ['a','ac'] -> segment 'a' -> distinct; segment 'ac' -> distinct? \n                    set('ac') = {'a','c'} -> length=2, and len('ac')=2 -> distinct -> ok.\n                For b='c': split -> ['aba',''] -> segment 'aba': \n                    set('aba') = {'a','b'} -> length=2, but len('aba')=3 -> not distinct -> so we output NO.\n\n          Therefore, the code should be:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                distinct = set(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check adjacent duplicates\n                adj_dup = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        adj_dup = True\n                        break\n                if adj_dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                flag = False\n                for b in distinct:\n                    segments = s.split(b)\n                    for seg in segments:\n                        if len(seg) > len(set(seg)):\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            flag = True\n                            break\n                    if flag:\n                        break\n                if not flag:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n          However, note: the segment might be empty? We can skip empty segments because they have no duplicates.\n\n          We can change the inner loop to skip empty segments? Actually, we can skip because an empty segment has no duplicates.\n\n          But we can also leave it: \n              len(seg)=0 -> set(seg)=0 -> 0==0 -> no duplicate.\n\n          So we don't need to skip.\n\n          But note: the split method: \n              For example, if the string starts with b, then the first segment is empty.\n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          However, note: the problem constraints say that the total length of all test cases is <= 200,000. But note: the input says the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200,000. So we are safe.\n\n          Let's run the provided examples:\n\n            Example: \"aa\" -> \n                distinct = {'a'} -> so step1: YES.\n\n            Example: \"ab\" -> \n                distinct = {'a','b'} -> step2: no adjacent duplicates? \n                    a and b -> not duplicate -> then step3: \n                    for b='a': split -> ['','b'] -> segment '' -> skip? we don't skip, but len('')=0, set('')=0 -> 0==0 -> no duplicate.\n                    for b='b': split -> ['a',''] -> same -> no duplicate -> YES.\n\n          But wait: the example \"ab\" is balanced? \n            Substrings: \n                \"a\": a:1, b:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n                \"b\": a:0, b:1 -> |0-1|=1 -> okay.\n                \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> |0| -> okay.\n            So YES.\n\n          Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is <= 200,000. But we are doing 26 * (length of string) per test case. Since the total length of all strings is 200,000, the total work is 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n          But note: worst-case, if the string is long (like 200,000) and has 26 distinct characters, then we do 26 splits. Each split is O(n). So 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6 per test case? \n          However, the total length of all test cases is 200,000. So the worst-case is one test case with n=200,000. Then we do 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6 operations -> acceptable.\n\n          But note: the split operation in Python for a string of length n is O(n). And we are doing 26 splits per test case. So for one test case of length n, we do 26*n. \n\n          Since the total n over test cases is 200,000, then the total work is 26 * (sum of n) = 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6.\n\n          Therefore, we can code accordingly.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe.\n\n          Let's code accordingly.\n\n          But note: we must be cautious because the split operation might create many small strings. However, the total memory is the same as the input.\n\n          We'll write the code accordingly.\n\n          One more example: \"a\" -> \n            distinct = {'a'} -> YES.\n\n          Example: \"ab\" -> YES.\n\n          Example: \"aa\" -> YES? But wait, \"aa\" has two adjacent duplicates? \n            Step 2: i=0: s[0]=='a', s[1]=='a' -> adj_dup = True -> output \"NO\". \n            But the entire string \"aa\" has only one distinct character? \n            Actually, step1: distinct = {'a'} -> so we output \"YES\". \n\n          So we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, the code:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                distinct = set(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check adjacent duplicates\n                adj_dup = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        adj_dup = True\n                        break\n                if adj_dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                flag = False\n                for b in distinct:\n                    segments = s.split(b)\n                    for seg in segments:\n                        if len(seg) != len(set(seg)):\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            flag = True\n                            break\n                    if flag:\n                        break\n                if not flag:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n          However, note: we can break early if we find a duplicate.\n\n          But wait: the condition is: if the length of the segment is not equal to the length of the set of the segment -> duplicate.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do: \n              if len(seg) > len(set(seg)): \n          because duplicates make the set smaller.\n\n          We'll use: if len(seg) != len(set(seg)): -> but actually, duplicates make the set smaller, so we can use:\n              if len(set(seg)) < len(seg):\n\n          But the condition for duplicate is exactly that. So we can use either.\n\n          We'll use: if len(seg) != len(set(seg)): -> it's the same.\n\n          But note: the set(seg) is at most the length of seg, and equal only if distinct.\n\n          So we can write: if len(set(seg)) < len(seg):\n\n          But it's the same.\n\n          We'll use the above.\n\n          Let me test with the example \"aba\" for b='b': \n              segments = ['a','a'] -> \n                  for seg='a': len(set('a'))=1, len(seg)=1 -> no duplicate.\n                  for seg='a': same.\n\n          Example \"abac\" for b='c': \n              seg = 'aba': len(set('aba'))=2, len('aba')=3 -> 2<3 -> duplicate -> NO.\n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          We'll output the code accordingly.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is 200,000. We are doing 26 * (length of the string) per test case. Since the total length is 200,000, the total operations is 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable in Pyton.\n\n          But note: worst-case, if the string is long and has 26 distinct characters, we are doing 26 splits. Each split: the split operation in Python is O(n). So total O(26*n) per test case.\n\n          Since the total n over test cases is 200,000, then the total operations is 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6.\n\n          We'll run the code.\n\n          However, note: the problem constraints say that the total length of all test cases is 200,000. So worst-case we have one test case of 200,000 -> 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6 -> acceptable.\n\n          We'll code accordingly.\n\n          But note: we can optimize by breaking early in the inner loop if we find a duplicate.\n\n          We are already breaking.\n\n          Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is 200,000, but the input says \"the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we are safe.\n\n          Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can do:\n\n            total_n = 0\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                n = len(s)\n                total_n += n\n                # ... \n\n          But we don't need to track total_n because the problem guarantees it.\n\n          We'll output the code.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is 200,000, but the input says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we are safe.\n\n          Code:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                n = len(s)\n                # Check adjacent duplicates\n                adj_dup = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        adj_dup = True\n                        break\n                if adj_dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                flag = False\n                for b in distinct:\n                    segments = s.split(b)\n                    for seg in segments:\n                        if len(seg) != len(set(seg)):\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            flag = True\n                            break\n                    if flag:\n                        break\n                if not flag:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n          Let me test with the sample test cases:\n\n            Sample 1: \"aba\" -> YES\n            Sample 2: \"abb\" -> NO (by adjacent duplicate)\n            Sample 3: \"abc\" -> YES\n            Sample 4: \"a\" -> YES\n\n          But the problem sample: \n            Input: \n                4\n                aba\n                abb\n                abc\n                a\n\n            Output:\n                YES\n                NO\n                YES\n                YES\n\n          However, the problem sample output for the first test case is YES? \n            But the problem says: \n                For the first test case: ... the answer is 2 -> but wait, that was program1? \n\n          This is program2: \n            The problem says: \n                Example: \n                  \"aba\" -> YES\n                  \"abb\" -> NO\n                  \"abc\" -> YES\n\n          So we output:\n\n            YES\n            NO\n            YES\n            YES\n\n          But the sample input has 4 test cases: \n            \"a\" -> YES.\n\n          Therefore, we are good.\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is 200,000. We are doing 26 * (length of s) per test case. \n\n          But note: the worst-case distinct characters might be 26, and the string length might be 200000. Then we do 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6 per test case. And if there is only one test case, that's acceptable. But if there are 10,000 test cases? \n\n          But the problem says: the total length of all test cases (i.e., the sum of |s|) is <= 200000. So the worst-case is one test case of 200000, and the rest are empty? \n\n          So we are safe.\n\n          We'll run the code.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so the worst-case total work is 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6.\n\n          We'll output the code.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is 200,000, so we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                n = len(s)\n                # Check adjacent duplicates\n                adj_dup = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        adj_dup = True\n                        break\n                if adj_dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                flag = False\n                for b in distinct:\n                    segments = s.split(b)\n                    for seg in segments:\n                        if len(seg) != len(set(seg)):\n                            print(\"NO\")\n                            flag = True\n                            break\n                    if flag:\n                        break\n                if not flag:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe.\n\n          But note: the inner loop over segments: the total length of the segments for one split is n (because we remove b, so the total length of the segments is n - (number of b's)). And we are doing 26 splits per test case. The total over all test cases is 26 * (sum of n) = 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6.\n\n          We'll run it.\n\n          However, note: the set(seg) operation: the worst-case for one segment is the length of the segment. The total length of all segments for one split is n, and we do 26 splits per test case -> 26 * n per test case. And the total n over test cases is 200000 -> 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6.\n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          We'll output the code.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py is as above.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" and the code we are given for program2.py is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\r\n                # TODO: Your code here\r\n\n          So we must output the code that goes inside the loop.\n\n          We'll output:\n\n            s = input().strip()\n            distinct = set(s)\n            if len(distinct) == 1:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                continue\n            n = len(s)\n            # Check adjacent duplicates\n            adj_dup = False\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                    adj_dup = True\n                    break\n            if adj_dup:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                continue\n\n            flag = False\n            for b in distinct:\n                segments = s.split(b)\n                for seg in segments:\n                    if len(seg) != len(set(seg)):\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        flag = True\n                        break\n                if flag:\n                    break\n            if not flag:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n          But note: the outer loop is already given.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\n\n          Output Specification: For each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the condition.\n\n          Example: \n            Input: \n                4\n                3\n                10 20 10\n                6\n                2 1 4 2 4 1\n                5\n                1 2 3 4 5\n                6\n                1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n            Output:\n                2\n                6\n                0\n                6\n\n          We are given the code for program1.py:\n\n            I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n            for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                n=I()[0]\n                l=I()\n                l2=[]\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    if s1 == s2: l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2); s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                    if s1 < s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                    if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n                print(l2[-1])\n\n          We must complete the missing part.\n\n          The idea:\n\n            We are using two pointers: \n                p1: the next candy Alice will eat (from the left)\n                p2: the next candy Bob will eat (from the right)\n\n            s1: the total weight Alice has eaten so far.\n            s2: the total weight Bob has eaten so far.\n\n            We want to maximize the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) when s1 == s2.\n\n            The algorithm:\n\n                We start with p1=0, p2=n-1, s1=0, s2=0.\n                We have a list l2 to record the total candies eaten at the moment when s1==s2.\n\n                The while condition: p1-1<=p2 -> but note: when p1=0, then p1-1 = -1, and p2>=0 -> so condition holds.\n\n                The steps:\n\n                  if s1 == s2: \n                      we record the current total candies: p1 (number of candies Alice has eaten) and (n-1-p2) (number of candies Bob has eaten) -> total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                      then we let Alice eat the next candy: s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n                  if s1 < s2: \n                      we need to increase s1? But note: we just did an equality check and then updated Alice? \n                      Actually, after updating Alice, we then check if s1 < s2? \n                      Then we do ... what? \n\n                  if s2 < s1: \n                      then we let Bob eat the next candy: s2 += l[p2]; p2 -= 1\n\n                But note: after the equality check and update, we then check the next two conditions? \n\n                However, the code has:\n\n                  if s1 == s2: ... then update Alice and p1.\n                  if s1 < s2: ... \n                  if s2 < s1: ...\n\n                This means that after the first if, we might then fall into one of the next two.\n\n                But note: after updating Alice, s1 might become greater than s2? Then we would then do the third if? \n\n                The problem: we are missing the code for the second if.\n\n                What should we do when s1 < s2? \n                  We want to increase s1? But note: we just updated Alice and now s1 is still less than s2? Then we should let Alice eat one more? \n\n                However, the structure of the code: \n                  We are in a while loop that continues as long as p1-1<=p2? \n\n                Actually, the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> after we update p1, we have p1-1 (which is the last index Alice ate) and p2. We require that the next candy for Alice (if any) would be at p1 (which is now the next one) and for Bob at p2.\n\n                But note: the condition p1-1<=p2: \n                    Initially: p1=0 -> p1-1 = -1, p2 = n-1 -> -1<=n-1 -> true.\n                    After Alice eats the first candy: p1 becomes 1 -> then p1-1=0, and p2 is n-1 -> 0<=n-1 -> true.\n\n                The loop condition should be: while p1 <= p2? \n\n                But the condition is written as: while (p1-1<=p2)\n\n                Why? \n\n                Let me simulate:\n\n                  Initially: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> condition: -1<=n-1 -> true.\n\n                  After Alice eats one: p1=1 -> condition: 0<=p2 (which is n-1) -> true.\n\n                  We want to stop when Alice and Bob have met? \n\n                Actually, when p1-1 > p2 -> then we break.\n\n                But note: when p1-1 = p2, that means Alice has eaten up to p1-1 and Bob has eaten from p2 down to p1 (if any) but they might have met? \n\n                Example: n=1: \n                    p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true.\n                    Then we do: \n                         if s1==s2 (both 0) -> record: l2.append(0 + (1-1-0) = 0+0=0? \n                         then s1 becomes l[0], p1 becomes 1.\n                    Then condition: p1-1 = 0 <= p2=0 -> true.\n                    Then we check: \n                         s1 = l[0], s2=0 -> so if s1==s2? no.\n                         if s1 < s2? no.\n                         if s2 < s1: then we do s2 += l[0] -> p2 becomes -1.\n                    Then condition: p1-1 = 0 <= p2=-1 -> false -> break.\n                    Then we print l2[-1] = 0.\n\n                But the expected answer for n=1: \n                    Alice and Bob cannot eat the same total weight? \n                    Because if Alice eats the candy, then Bob has nothing -> s1=w0, s2=0 -> not equal -> so they eat 0 candies? \n                    But the example output for n=1 would be 0.\n\n                However, the example: \n                    Input: \n                        4\n                        3\n                        10 20 10\n                        6\n                        2 1 4 2 4 1\n                        5\n                        1 2 3 4 5\n                        6\n                        1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n                    Output: 2, 6, 0, 6.\n\n                The third test case: 5 candies: [1,2,3,4,5] -> output 0.\n\n                So the algorithm for program1.py:\n\n                  We are trying to simulate:\n\n                    We start with no candies eaten (s1=0, s2=0) -> then we record 0 candies? \n                    Then we let Alice eat the first candy -> s1=10, p1=1 -> then we check: s1>s2 -> then we let Bob eat the last candy: s2=10, p2=1 -> then we check: s1==s2 -> record: p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (3-1-1) = 1+1 = 2 -> then we let Alice eat the next? but then p1 becomes 2, and then we break? \n\n                  Actually, the while condition: \n                      After the first record: \n                         s1=10, s2=0 -> then we do the next if: s1>s2 -> so we do s2 += l[2] (which is 10) -> p2 becomes 1 -> then we break the condition? \n                      Then we check: \n                         if s1==s2: 10==10 -> then we record: p1 (which is 1) + (n-1-p2)= (3-1-1)=1 -> total=2 -> then we update: s1 += l[1] -> s1=10+20=30, p1=2.\n                      Then condition: p1-1=1 <= p2=1 -> true.\n                      Then we check: \n                         s1=30, s2=10 -> then we do the third if: s2 < s1 -> s2 += l[1] (which is the candy at index1? but Bob is at index1? and the array is [10,20,10] -> l[1]=20) -> s2=10+20=30, p2=0.\n                      Then condition: p1-1=1 <= p2=0 -> true? 1<=0 -> false? -> break.\n\n                  Then we print l2[-1] = 2.\n\n                  So it matches.\n\n                Now, what to do when s1 < s2? \n\n                  Example: \n                    We have: \n                      s1=10, s2=0 -> then we update Alice: s1=10, then we check: s1>s2 -> so we update Bob: s2=10, p2=1 -> then we break? \n                  But then we check the condition again: \n                      if s1==s2: then we record and then update Alice: s1=10+20=30, p1=2 -> then condition: p1-1=1<=p2=1 -> true.\n                      Now: s1=30, s2=10 -> s1>s2 -> so we update Bob: s2=10+20=30, p2=0 -> then condition: 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n\n                  Then we output the last record: 2.\n\n                But what if we have a situation where after updating Alice, s1 is still less than s2? \n\n                  Example: \n                    n=4, weights: [1, 1, 1, 3]\n\n                  Steps:\n\n                    p1=0, p2=3, s1=0, s2=0 -> s1==s2: record 0 + (4-1-3)=0 -> then update: s1=1, p1=1.\n                    Then condition: p1-1=0<=p2=3 -> true.\n                    Now: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2.\n                    Then condition: 0<=2 -> true.\n                    Now: s1=1, s2=3 -> s1<s2 -> what do we do? \n\n                  We are missing the code for the second if.\n\n                  We should let Alice eat the next candy? \n\n                  So we do: s1 += l[1] -> s1=2, p1=2.\n\n                  Then condition: p1-1=1<=p2=2 -> true.\n                  Now: s1=2, s2=3 -> s1<s2 -> then we let Alice eat the next: s1=2+1=3, p1=3.\n\n                  Then condition: p1-1=2<=p2=2 -> true.\n                  Now: s1=3, s2=3 -> record: p1 + (n-1-p2) = 3 + (4-1-2)=3+1=4 -> then update: s1 += l[3] -> s1=3+3=6, p1=4.\n\n                  Then condition: p1-1=3<=p2=2 -> false -> break.\n\n                  Then we output 4.\n\n                  But is that valid? \n                    Alice ate [1,1,1,3] -> total=6\n                    Bob ate nothing? because p2=2 -> Bob ate the candy at index3? but we updated Bob only once: he ate the candy at index3 (which is 3) and then p2 became 2. Then we didn't update Bob again.\n\n                  How many candies did Bob eat? \n                    Bob eats from the right: initially p2=3 -> he ate the candy at index3 (weight=3) -> then p2 becomes 2 -> so Bob ate one candy.\n\n                  Alice ate the first three: [1,1,1] -> total=3, and Bob ate the last one: 3 -> total=3. \n                  But then we updated Alice again: after the record, we updated Alice to eat the next candy? but p1=3 -> that is the last candy? but Bob already ate the last candy? \n\n                  This is a problem: we are allowing both to eat the same candy? \n\n                  The condition: we must not let them eat the same candy.\n\n                  The algorithm: \n                    We have two pointers: \n                      Alice: from left, Bob: from right.\n                    We are updating:\n                      When we update Alice, we do p1++ (so we are eating the candy at p1 and then moving to the next).\n                      When we update Bob, we do p2-- (so we are eating the candy at p2 and then moving to the next from the right).\n\n                  The total candies eaten by Alice: p1 (because she has eaten from index0 to index p1-1).\n                  The total candies eaten by Bob: n-1 - p2 (because he has eaten from index n-1 down to p2+1).\n\n                  In the example: \n                    After the first record: \n                         Alice: p1=1 -> she has eaten [0] -> weight=1.\n                    Then we update Bob: p2=3 -> Bob eats index3 -> then p2 becomes 2 -> so Bob has eaten [3] -> one candy.\n                    Then we update Alice: p1=1 -> then we update again: p1=2 -> Alice has eaten [0,1] -> weight=1+1=2.\n                    Then update Alice again: p1=3 -> Alice has eaten [0,1,2] -> weight=3.\n                    Then we record: when s1=3, s2=3 -> total candies: Alice has eaten 3, Bob has eaten 1 -> total=4.\n\n                  But note: the candy at index2 is eaten by Alice, and the candy at index3 is eaten by Bob. They are distinct.\n\n                  However, after the record, we update Alice: p1=4 -> but there is no candy at index3? because the array has index0..3. \n\n                  And then we break.\n\n                  So the record was at the moment when Alice had eaten [0,1,2] and Bob had eaten [3] -> total=4.\n\n                  But is that valid? \n                    Alice: [1,1,1] -> total=3\n                    Bob: [3] -> total=3 -> fair.\n\n                  And they ate 4 candies.\n\n                  But what if we try to get more? \n                    They cannot eat more because the candy at index2 is already eaten by Alice and index3 by Bob, and there is no more.\n\n                  So 4 is the answer.\n\n                  Therefore, when s1 < s2, we should let Alice eat the next candy.\n\n                  So the missing code for the second if is: \n                      s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n                  But note: we must be cautious: we are in a loop and we have updated p1 and p2. We must break the loop when p1-1>p2? \n\n                  The condition: while (p1-1<=p2) -> so when p1-1>p2, we break.\n\n                  After we update Alice: p1 increases by 1 -> then we break if p1-1>p2.\n\n                  Similarly for Bob.\n\n                  Therefore, the code for the second if is: \n                      if s1 < s2: \n                          s1 += l[p1]\n                          p1 += 1\n\n                  But note: what if p1 is already beyond p2? \n                    The condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> so p1-1 is the last index Alice ate. \n                    When we update Alice: we set p1 = p1+1, then the next time we check the condition: (p1-1) <= p2? \n                    If p1-1 becomes p2+1, then the condition fails and we break.\n\n                  So we are safe.\n\n                  Let me test with the example: \n                    n=4, [1,1,1,3]\n\n                    Step0: p1=0, p2=3, s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then update Alice: s1=1, p1=1.\n                    Step1: condition: 0<=3 -> true.\n                         s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2.\n                    Step2: condition: 0<=2 -> true.\n                         s1=1, s2=3 -> s1<s2 -> update Alice: s1=1+l[1]=1+1=2, p1=2.\n                    Step3: condition: 1<=2 -> true.\n                         s1=2, s2=3 -> s1<s2 -> update Alice: s1=2+l[2]=2+1=3, p1=3.\n                    Step4: condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n                         s1=3, s2=3 -> record: p1 + (n-1-p2) = 3 + (4-1-2)=3+1=4 -> then update Alice: s1=3+l[3]=3+3=6, p1=4.\n                    Step5: condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n                    Then output 4.\n\n                  But note: when we update Alice at step4, we are eating the candy at index3? but Bob has not eaten it? \n                    Bob has eaten the candy at index3? \n                    Initially, Bob ate the candy at index3 (which was 3) and then p2 became 2. \n                    Then Alice ate the candy at index3? \n\n                  This is the same candy? \n\n                  The array: \n                    index0:1, index1:1, index2:1, index3:3.\n\n                  Bob ate index3 -> so that candy is gone. Then Alice cannot eat it.\n\n                  How do we avoid that?\n\n                  The pointers: \n                    Alice: from left to right: she eats from index0 to index p1-1. \n                    Bob: from right to left: he eats from index n-1 down to p2+1.\n\n                  So the candies that are eaten are:\n                    Alice: indices [0, p1-1]\n                    Bob: indices [p2+1, n-1]\n\n                  The condition: we must have the two intervals disjoint.\n\n                  How do we ensure that? \n\n                  The condition of the while loop: p1-1 <= p2 -> meaning the last index Alice has eaten (p1-1) is <= the last index Bob has not eaten (p2) -> so the next candy for Alice is at p1 (which is p1-1+1) and for Bob at p2 (which is the next from the right). \n\n                  But note: if p1-1 == p2, then the next candy for Alice is at p1 = p2+1 -> which is beyond Bob's next candy? \n\n                  Actually, the next candy for Alice is at index p1 (which is the first uneaten from the left) and for Bob at index p2 (the first uneaten from the right). \n\n                  The condition p1-1<=p2 means that the last eaten by Alice (at p1-1) is to the left of the next uneaten by Bob (at p2). \n\n                  But when we update Alice: we eat the candy at p1 -> then we set p1 = p1+1. \n                  Then the last eaten by Alice becomes p1-1 (which is the one we just ate). \n\n                  Similarly, when we update Bob: we eat the candy at p2 -> then we set p2 = p2-1.\n\n                  The condition for the next iteration: p1-1 <= p2? \n                    This means: the last eaten by Alice (p1-1) must be <= the next uneaten by Bob (which is now p2, but note: Bob has eaten the candy at p2, so the next uneaten by Bob is p2-1? Actually, no: Bob's next candy is the one at p2-1? \n\n                  Actually, the state at the beginning of the loop:\n\n                    Alice has eaten [0, p1-1] -> so the next available for Alice is p1.\n                    Bob has eaten [p2+1, n-1] -> so the next available for Bob is p2.\n\n                  The condition: we require that the next available for Alice (p1) is <= the next available for Bob (p2). \n\n                  But the condition in the code is: p1-1<=p2.\n\n                  Why? \n\n                  Example: \n                    Initially: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> p1-1 = -1, p2 = n-1 -> -1<=n-1 -> true.\n\n                  After Alice eats one: p1 becomes 1 -> then condition: 0<=p2 -> which is true until p2>=0.\n\n                  But when p1 becomes 3 and p2 becomes 2: \n                    condition: 3-1=2<=2 -> true.\n\n                  Then we update Alice: p1 becomes 4 -> condition: 4-1=3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n                  So the condition is: while the last index eaten by Alice (p1-1) is <= the next available index for Bob (p2) -> meaning that there is at least one candy that is not eaten? \n\n                  Actually, the condition should be: while there is at least one candy that is not eaten by either? \n                    That is: p1 <= p2? \n\n                  But the condition is p1-1<=p2.\n\n                  Why not use p1<=p2? \n\n                  Let me simulate with n=1:\n\n                    p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: p1-1=-1<=0 -> true.\n                    Then we do: \n                         s1==s2 -> record 0, then update Alice: s1=w0, p1=1.\n                    Then condition: p1-1=0<=p2=0 -> true.\n                    Then we check: \n                         s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=w0, p2=-1.\n                    Then condition: 0<=-1 -> false -> break.\n\n                  Then output 0.\n\n                  If we use p1<=p2: \n                    Initially: p1=0, p2=0 -> true.\n                    Then update Alice: p1=1 -> then condition: 1<=0 -> false -> break -> then we output 0.\n\n                  But we missed the chance to update Bob? \n\n                  Actually, after updating Alice, we have s1=w0, s2=0 -> then we should update Bob? \n\n                  But the condition of the while loop is checked at the beginning of each iteration. \n\n                  We need to do:\n\n                    while p1<=p2: \n                        if s1==s2: record and then update Alice? \n                        then if s1<=s2: update Alice? \n                        then if s1>=s2: update Bob? \n\n                  But that might not be symmetric.\n\n                  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    while p1 <= p2:\n                        if s1 == s2:\n                            record the current total: p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                        if s1 <= s2:\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:\n                            s2 += l[p2]\n                            p2 -= 1\n\n                  Then for n=1:\n                    p1=0, p2=0 -> true.\n                    s1==s2 (0==0) -> record: 0 + (1-1-0)=0.\n                    then if s1<=s2 -> true -> s1=l[0], p1=1.\n                    then condition: p1=1, p2=0 -> false -> break.\n                    output 0.\n\n                  Then for the example: [10,20,10] (n=3)\n\n                    p1=0, p2=2 -> true.\n                    s1=0, s2=0 -> record: 0 + (3-1-2)=0 -> then update Alice: s1=10, p1=1.\n                    condition: p1=1<=p2=2 -> true.\n                    s1=10, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=10, p2=1.\n                    condition: 1<=1 -> true.\n                    s1=10, s2=10 -> record: 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then update Alice: s1=10+20=30, p1=2.\n                    condition: 2<=1 -> false -> break.\n                    output 2.\n\n                  But what if we have [1,1,1,3]?\n\n                    p1=0, p2=3 -> true.\n                    s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> update Alice: s1=1, p1=1.\n                    condition: 1<=3 -> true.\n                    s1=1, s2=0 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2.\n                    condition: 1<=2 -> true.\n                    s1=1, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=1+1=2, p1=2.\n                    condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n                    s1=2, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=2+1=3, p1=3.\n                    condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n                    Then we output the last record? but we recorded 0 and 2? and we output 2? \n\n                  But we recorded at the moment when s1==s2: \n                    first: 0\n                    then: when s1=10 and s2=10 -> recorded 2? \n                    then we did not record again.\n\n                  How do we record the maximum? \n\n                  The original code uses a list l2 and then prints l2[-1]. But we want the maximum total candies when s1==s2.\n\n                  In the example [1,1,1,3]: \n                    We recorded 0 and then 2? but the answer should be 4? \n\n                  When did we have s1==s2 again? \n                    After updating Alice to p1=3: s1=3, s2=3 -> we should record: p1 + (n-1-p2) = 3 + (4-1-2)=3+1=4.\n\n                  But we did not record because we updated Alice in the same iteration? \n\n                  The algorithm above:\n\n                    while p1<=p2:\n                        if s1==s2: \n                            record = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # we record the current total\n                        if s1<=s2:\n                            update Alice\n                        else:\n                            update Bob\n\n                  But note: after recording, we update Alice (because s1<=s2) and then we break the condition? \n\n                  We should record every time s1==s2.\n\n                  In the example [1,1,1,3]:\n\n                    Iteration0: p1=0, p2=3 -> s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then update Alice: s1=1, p1=1.\n                    Iteration1: p1=1, p2=3 -> s1=1, s2=0 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2.\n                    Iteration2: p1=1, p2=2 -> s1=1, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=2, p1=2.\n                    Iteration3: p1=2, p2=2 -> s1=2, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=3, p1=3.\n                    Iteration4: p1=3, p2=2 -> condition fails.\n\n                  We did not record the state (s1=3, s2=3) because when we had s1=3 and s2=3, we were not in the loop? \n\n                  Actually, we updated Alice to s1=3 and p1=3 at iteration3, then the next iteration: p1=3, p2=2 -> condition p1<=p2 -> 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n                  How to capture the state when s1==s2 at the end? \n\n                  We can record after the loop? \n\n                  Alternatively, we can change the condition to:\n\n                    while p1<=p2:\n                        if s1 == s2:\n                            # record\n                            l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n                        if s1 <= s2:\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:\n                            s2 += l[p2]\n                            p2 -= 1\n\n                  But then we record at the beginning of the iteration.\n\n                  In the example [1,1,1,3]:\n\n                    Iteration0: p1=0, p2=3 -> s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> then update Alice: s1=1, p1=1.\n                    Iteration1: p1=1, p2=3 -> s1=1, s2=0 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2.\n                    Iteration2: p1=1, p2=2 -> s1=1, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=2, p1=2.\n                    Iteration3: p1=2, p2=2 -> s1=2, s2=3 -> update Alice: s1=3, p1=3.\n                    Iteration4: p1=3, p2=2 -> condition fails -> break.\n\n                  We did not record the state (3,3) because we never had s1==s2 again.\n\n                  But when we update Alice to s1=3, we have s1=3 and s2=3? -> no, s2 is still 3? \n\n                  Actually, after iteration3: \n                    s1=3, s2=3? -> no, s2 is 3 and s1 becomes 3 -> but we are at the next iteration? \n\n                  We need to record at the moment when s1==s2, but we are updating and then moving to the next iteration.\n\n                  How about we record after an update? \n\n                  The original code structure:\n\n                    while (p1-1<=p2):\n                        if s1 == s2: \n                            l2.append(...)\n                            s1 += l[p1]; p1+=1   # update Alice immediately after recording\n                        if s1 < s2: \n                            ... update Alice\n                        if s2 < s1:\n                            ... update Bob\n\n                  In the example [1,1,1,3]:\n\n                    Step0: p1=0, p2=3, s1=0, s2=0 -> record: 0 -> then update Alice: s1=1, p1=1.\n                    Then condition: p1-1=0<=p2=3 -> true.\n                    Then check: s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2 -> update Bob: s2=3, p2=2.\n                    Then condition: 0<=2 -> true.\n                    Then check: s1=1, s2=3 -> s1<s2 -> update Alice: s1=1+l[1]=2, p1=2.\n                    Then condition: 1<=2 -> true.\n                    Then check: s1=2, s2=3 -> s1<s2 -> update Alice: s1=2+l[2]=3, p1=3.\n                    Then condition: 2<=2 -> true.\n                    Then check: s1=3, s2=3 -> record: 3 + (4-1-2)=4 -> then update Alice: s1=3+l[3]=6, p1=4.\n                    Then condition: 3<=2 -> false -> break.\n\n                  Then we output l2[-1]=4.\n\n                  This matches.\n\n                  Therefore, the missing code for the second if is: \n                      s1 += l[p1]; p1 += 1\n\n                  And the condition in the while loop is: while (p1-1<=p2)\n\n                  But note: the condition in the while loop is written as: while (p1-1<=p2)\n\n                  We'll complete the code for program1.py:\n\n                    I=lambda:[int(i) for i in input().split()]\n                    for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                        n=I()[0]\n                        l=I()\n                        l2=[]\n                        s1,s2=0,0\n                        p1,p2=0,n-1\n                        while (p1-1<=p2):\n                            if s1 == s2: \n                                l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n                                s1 += l[p1]\n                                p1 += 1\n                            if p1-1 > p2:   # we break the inner ifs? \n                                break\n                            if s1 < s2: \n                                s1 += l[p1]\n                                p1 += 1\n                            if p1-1 > p2:\n                                break\n                            if s2 < s1: \n                                s2 += l[p2]\n                                p2 -= 1\n                        print(l2[-1] if l2 else 0)\n\n                  But wait: after the first if, we update p1, and then we check if p1-1>p2? then break. \n                  Then we check s1<s2? and then update p1 again? and then check again? \n\n                  However, the condition of the while loop is checked at the beginning of each iteration. \n\n                  But we are in the middle of the iteration? \n\n                  Actually, the code has three ifs in a row. \n\n                  After the first if, we might have updated p1, and then we check the next if: if s1 < s2? \n\n                  But we must break if p1-1>p2? \n\n                  How about we break out of the loop? \n\n                  Alternatively, we can rely on the while condition? \n\n                  But the while condition is only checked at the start of the loop. \n\n                  We are in the same iteration. \n\n                  We must break out of the current iteration if after an update the condition fails? \n\n                  But the problem: after updating Alice in the first if, we might have p1-1>p2? then we should break immediately? \n\n                  Example: n=1: \n                    Step0: p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true.\n                    Then: s1==s2 -> record 0, then update Alice: s1=l[0], p1=1.\n                    Then we do the next if: if p1-1>p2? -> 0>0 -> false.\n                    Then if s1 < s2? -> s1=l[0], s2=0 -> false.\n                    Then if s2 < s1: true -> update Bob: s2=l[0], p2=-1.\n                    Then the iteration ends.\n                    Then condition at the next iteration: p1-1=0<=p2=-1 -> false -> break.\n                    Then output l2[-1]=0.\n\n                  But we updated Bob even though there was no candy? \n\n                  The candy at p2=0 was already eaten by Alice? \n\n                  How can Bob eat it? \n\n                  This is a problem.\n\n                  We must not allow Bob to eat a candy that has been eaten by Alice.\n\n                  The condition: the next candy for Bob is at p2, but if p2 < p1-1, then the candy at p2 has already been eaten by Alice? \n\n                  Actually, the candies eaten by Alice are [0, p1-1]. The candies eaten by Bob are [p2+1, n-1]. \n\n                  The next candy for Bob is at p2, which must be >= p1? \n\n                  But in the example: after Alice ate the candy at 0, p1=1. Then the next candy for Bob is at p2=0 -> but that candy is already eaten by Alice.\n\n                  So we must break after the first if if p1-1>p2? \n\n                  Actually, we should break immediately after any update that makes p1-1>p2.\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                    while (p1-1<=p2):\n                        if s1 == s2: \n                            l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                            if p1-1 > p2:   # after update, check\n                                break\n                        if p1-1 > p2:\n                            break\n                        if s1 < s2: \n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                            if p1-1 > p2:\n                                break\n                        if p1-1 > p2:\n                            break\n                        if s2 < s1: \n                            s2 += l[p2]\n                            p2 -= 1\n                    print(l2[-1] if l2 else 0)\n\n                  But this is messy.\n\n                  Alternatively, we can break the loop with a condition in the while, and then after each update we check and break with 'break' but then we have to break out of the while.\n\n                  We can do:\n\n                    while (p1-1<=p2):\n                        if s1 == s2: \n                            l2.append(p1 + n-1-p2)\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                            if p1-1 > p2:\n                                break\n                            continue   # then we go to the next iteration? \n                        if s1 < s2: \n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:   # s2 < s1\n                            s2 += l[p2]\n                            p2 -= 1\n                        if p1-1 > p2:\n                            break\n\n                  But note: after the first if, we do a continue, so we skip the rest.\n\n                  Why? \n\n                  In the first if, we updated Alice, and then we break if needed, and then we continue to the next iteration.\n\n                  But then we skip the other"
