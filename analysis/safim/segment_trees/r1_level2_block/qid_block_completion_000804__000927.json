So we must check after every update? and the while condition is l<=h? However, after step5: \n      We updated Bob: we took the candy at index 3? and then set h=2? Then we check: a==b? -> 3==3 -> then we set ans = l (which is 3) + (n - h - 1) = 3 + (6-2-1)=3+3=6. Then we break because l=3 and h=2 -> l>h -> so we break. So the algorithm is correct? Therefore, the missing else block is:\n        a = a + l1[l]\n        l = l + 1\n\n  But note: we must be cautious: the array index for l is from 0 to n-1. However, what if l becomes n? then we break? Example: [1,1] \n      Step0: l=0, h=1, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add l1[0]=1 -> a=1, l=1 -> then check: a==b? 1==0? no.\n      Step1: a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> add l1[1]=1 -> b=1, h=0 -> then check: a==b? 1==1 -> ans = 1 (from left) + (2-0-1)=1+1=2 -> then l=1, h=0 -> break. So it works. But what about the third test case: [3, 6, 3] -> the answer is 0? \n      Step0: l=0, h=2, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add l1[0]=3 -> a=3, l=1 -> check: 3==0? no.\n      Step1: a=3, b=0 -> a>0 -> add l1[2]=3 -> b=3, h=1 -> check: 3==3 -> ans = 1 (from left) + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then l=1, h=1 -> next iteration. Step2: l=1, h=1 -> a=3, b=3 -> a<=b -> add l1[1]=6 -> a=9, l=2 -> check: 9==3? no. Then we break? because l=2, h=1 -> l>h? no, l==2 and h==1 -> l>h? yes? 2>1 -> break. So we output 2? but the expected answer is 0? Why 0?",

Similarly, if the segment has no B? then set b=1. But if the segment has both? then we don't set b=1. So we can write:\n\n          if i:   # non-empty\n              if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n\n      But note: if the segment has length>=2 and has both R and B? then we don't set b=1. Therefore, the code for the for-loop in program2.py is:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n              if i:   # non-empty segment\n                  if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                      b = 1\n\n      However, we can also write without the if i: because if i is empty, then len(i)==0, and we skip? But we have:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n              if i:   # then we check\n\n      Alternatively, we can skip empty segments?

This matches. Therefore, we output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n            l = l + 1\", \"program2\": \"if i: # non-empty segment\\n            if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n                b = 1\"}\n\n  But note: the program2.py code must be indented properly?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code so that it solves the candy problem.\n\nThe problem: \n  - There are t test cases.\n  - For each test case: n and a list of n integers (weights of candies).\n  - Alice eats from the left (a contiguous segment from the left), Bob from the right (a contiguous segment from the right).\n  - They cannot eat the same candy.\n  - They want the total weight eaten by Alice to equal that eaten by Bob, and they want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nApproach in program1.py:\n  We are given a skeleton that uses two pointers (l from left, h from right) and two variables a (for Alice's current total) and b (for Bob's current total). The idea is to try to balance the two totals.\n\n  The skeleton:\n      for t in range(int(input())):\n          n = int(input())\n          l1 = list of weights\n          l = 0, h = n-1, ans = 0, a = 0, b = 0\n          while l <= h:\n              if a > b:\n                  then we add the candy at h to Bob and move h left.\n              else:\n                  [TODO] we are to add to Alice? But note: the condition is \"if a<=b\", then we add to Alice? However, note the note: they can only eat from the left (Alice) and right (Bob). Also, we are trying to balance.\n\n  However, note the example: \n      In the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> Alice: [7,3,20] (30), Bob: [10,8,11,1] (30) -> total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n  The skeleton currently:\n      if a > b: \n          b += l1[h]; h--\n      else: \n          [TODO]\n\n  We must complete the else part. Since if a<=b, we should add to Alice? Because if Bob's total is already more, then we need to add to Alice to catch up? But note: we are starting from both ends and we want to maximize the number of candies.\n\n  The skeleton also has:\n      if a == b:\n          ans = l + (n - h - 1)   [because l is the next available from left, so we have eaten l candies from left? Actually, l is the next index to eat from left? But note: we are moving l and h as we assign. So when we add a candy to Alice, we do l++? Similarly for Bob, h--.\n\n  How the counting works:\n      Initially, we haven't eaten any. Then:\n        - When we add to Alice: we take l1[l] and then do l++? \n        - Similarly, when we add to Bob: we take l1[h] and then h--.\n\n      Then the total candies eaten so far is: \n          from left: l (because we started at 0 and now l is the next, so we have eaten l candies from left)\n          from right: n - 1 - h (because we started at n-1 and now h is the next from right, so we have eaten n-1 - h candies from right)\n\n      So total = l + (n - 1 - h) = l + n - h - 1.\n\n  We update ans whenever a==b, and we want the maximum total candies when a==b.\n\n  Therefore, in the else block (which is when a<=b) we should add the left candy to Alice and move l to the right.\n\n  So the else block should be:\n        a = a + l1[l]\n        l = l + 1\n\n  However, note: what if a==b? Then we are going to add to Alice? But that would break the equality? But then we update ans only when a==b? Actually, we check after the update? \n\n  The code does:\n      if a > b: update Bob\n      else: update Alice\n      then if a==b: update ans.\n\n  But note: after updating, we check if a==b? \n\n  However, consider: \n      Initially: a=0, b=0 -> we go to else -> then we add the first candy to Alice: a becomes w0, l becomes 1. Then we check: if a==b? -> 0==0? no, because a is now w0 and b is 0. So we don't update.\n\n  Then next iteration: if a>0? then we update Bob? \n\n  But we must note: we are updating and then checking. So we update ans only when we get a==b.\n\n  However, we must also note that we might have multiple opportunities for a==b. We want the maximum total candies? So we update ans whenever we get a==b and then continue? \n\n  But the problem: if we continue, we break the balance? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: they eat contiguous segments from the left and right. And we are allowed to stop at any time? But note: the entire segment from left and entire from right? Actually, they can stop at any point. So we are simulating:\n\n      We start with no candies. Then we can add to Alice until we get a total that is at least Bob's? Then we add to Bob until Bob's total is at least Alice's? And whenever they are equal, we record the total number of candies.\n\n  But note: we are allowed to stop at any time? However, the problem does not require that we use all candies? We are just trying to maximize the total number of candies.\n\n  The algorithm: \n      We traverse from both ends. We maintain two pointers and two sums. \n      We start with a=0, b=0.\n      Then we do:\n          if a <= b: then we add the next left candy to Alice (because we need to increase a to catch up with b, or if equal we can add to either? but if we add to Alice then a becomes greater? but then we will add to Bob? and we might get a new balance?).\n          if a > b: then we add the next right candy to Bob.\n\n      And whenever a==b, we record the current total candies (l + n - h - 1) and then we continue? \n\n      Why continue? Because we might get a better (larger) total? \n\n      But note: we are moving the pointers and we are going to cover the entire array? and we are updating ans every time we get a balance? and we want the maximum? \n\n      However, the problem: if we have multiple balances, we want the one with the maximum total candies? \n\n      Example: [1,1,1,1,1,1] \n          Initially: a=0, b=0 -> we add left: a=1, l=1 -> then a==b? no -> then since a>0 and b=0, we add to Bob: b=1, h=4 -> now a==b? yes -> ans = 1 (from left) + (6-4-1)=1 -> total=2? \n          Then we continue: now a=1, b=1 -> we add to Alice: a=2, l=2 -> then a> b -> add to Bob: b=2, h=3 -> ans = 2 + (6-3-1)=2+2=4 -> update ans to 4.\n          Then continue: a=2, b=2 -> add to Alice: a=3, l=3 -> then a> b -> add to Bob: b=3, h=2 -> now l>h -> break. \n          So we get ans=4.\n\n      But the maximum total candies is 6? because they can each take 3? \n          Alice: [1,1,1] -> 3\n          Bob: [1,1,1] -> 3\n          total=6.\n\n      Why didn't we get 6? \n          Because when we have l=3 and h=2, we break. But we had a balance at 3 and 3? \n\n      How do we capture that? \n          We update ans at the step when we have a=3 and b=3? But we break the loop when l>h? \n\n      Actually, we break when l>h? but at the last step: \n          We had a=2, b=2 -> then we add to Alice: l becomes 3, a=3 -> then we check: l<=h? -> 3<=2? false -> so we break without checking the condition? \n\n      So we missed the last balance.\n\n  Therefore, we must check for balance after every update? and then break when l>h? \n\n  But note: the condition in the while loop is l<=h. So when we update and then l becomes 3 and h=2, we break without checking the condition? \n\n  How to fix? \n\n  Alternatively, we can update ans whenever we have a==b, even if we break? \n\n  But the problem: we break the loop when l>h? and we have updated the last candy? \n\n  Actually, we can update ans at the moment we have a==b, and then continue until the pointers cross? \n\n  However, the above example [1,1,1,1,1,1] would be:\n\n      Step0: l=0, h=5, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add l1[0]=1 -> a=1, l=1 -> then check: a==b? 1==0? no.\n      Step1: a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> so add l1[5]=1 -> b=1, h=4 -> then check: a==b? yes -> ans = 1 (from left) + (6-4-1)=1+1=2 -> record ans=2.\n      Step2: l=1, h=4 -> a=1, b=1 -> a<=b -> add l1[1]=1 -> a=2, l=2 -> check: 2==1? no.\n      Step3: a=2, b=1 -> a>1 -> add l1[4]=1 -> b=2, h=3 -> check: 2==2 -> ans = 2 (from left) + (6-3-1)=2+2=4 -> update ans=4.\n      Step4: l=2, h=3 -> a=2, b=2 -> a<=b -> add l1[2]=1 -> a=3, l=3 -> check: 3==2? no.\n      Step5: a=3, b=2 -> a>2 -> add l1[3]=1 -> b=3, h=2 -> now l=3, h=2 -> break.\n\n      We missed the balance at a=3, b=3? because we broke without checking? \n\n  How to capture the balance at a=3, b=3? \n      We did not check after the last update? because after updating Bob at step5, we set h=2 and then the while condition fails? \n\n  But note: after step5, we set h=2 and then we break? and we did not check the condition a==b? \n\n  Therefore, we should check after every update? and we do: in step5, after updating Bob, we set b=3 and then we check: a==b? -> 3==3 -> then we update ans = 3 (from left: l=3) + (6-2-1)=3+3=6.\n\n  But wait: how many candies from the right? \n      We started at index 5, then we took 5 and 4 and 3? so that's 3 candies? \n      total = 3 (left) + 3 (right) = 6.\n\n  So we must check after every update? and the while condition is l<=h? \n\n  However, after step5: \n      We updated Bob: we took the candy at index 3? and then set h=2? \n      Then we check: a==b? -> 3==3 -> then we set ans = l (which is 3) + (n - h - 1) = 3 + (6-2-1)=3+3=6.\n\n  Then we break because l=3 and h=2 -> l>h -> so we break.\n\n  So the algorithm is correct? \n\n  Therefore, the missing else block is:\n        a = a + l1[l]\n        l = l + 1\n\n  But note: we must be cautious: the array index for l is from 0 to n-1. \n\n  However, what if l becomes n? then we break? \n\n  Example: [1,1] \n      Step0: l=0, h=1, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add l1[0]=1 -> a=1, l=1 -> then check: a==b? 1==0? no.\n      Step1: a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> add l1[1]=1 -> b=1, h=0 -> then check: a==b? 1==1 -> ans = 1 (from left) + (2-0-1)=1+1=2 -> then l=1, h=0 -> break.\n\n  So it works.\n\n  But what about the third test case: [3, 6, 3] -> the answer is 0? \n      Step0: l=0, h=2, a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add l1[0]=3 -> a=3, l=1 -> check: 3==0? no.\n      Step1: a=3, b=0 -> a>0 -> add l1[2]=3 -> b=3, h=1 -> check: 3==3 -> ans = 1 (from left) + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> then l=1, h=1 -> next iteration.\n      Step2: l=1, h=1 -> a=3, b=3 -> a<=b -> add l1[1]=6 -> a=9, l=2 -> check: 9==3? no.\n      Then we break? because l=2, h=1 -> l>h? no, l==2 and h==1 -> l>h? yes? 2>1 -> break.\n\n      So we output 2? but the expected answer is 0? \n\n  Why 0? The note: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n  But we got 2? \n\n  What's the third test case? \n      The note says: [3,6,3] -> but the example in the problem? \n      The problem says: \n          \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n      However, we found a way: Alice eats the first candy (3) and Bob eats the last candy (3) -> total 2 candies? and they both have 3? \n\n      But wait: the problem says: \n          \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n      So Alice must eat a contiguous segment from the left? and Bob from the right? and they cannot skip? \n\n      In [3,6,3]:\n          Alice can only eat: [3] or [3,6] or [3,6,3]? \n          Bob can only eat: [3] or [6,3] or [3,6,3]? \n\n      If Alice eats [3] and Bob eats [3] (the last candy), then they do not overlap? because the middle candy is not eaten? \n\n      But note: the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\". So if Alice eats the first candy, Bob cannot eat the first candy? but the last candy is not the first? \n\n      However, the candies are in a row: \n          positions: 0: 3, 1:6, 2:3.\n          Alice eats from the left: she must take a contiguous segment starting at the left. So she can take [0] -> then the remaining are [1,2]. Bob eats from the right: he must take a contiguous segment starting at the right. So he can take [2] -> then the middle candy is left? \n\n      That is allowed? \n\n      Then why is the answer 0? \n\n      The note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n      But we found a way: 3 and 3? \n\n      Let me check the example in the problem: \n          The first test case: [1,2,1] -> answer=2 -> Alice takes the first (1), Bob takes the last (1) -> total 2.\n\n      So why is [3,6,3] different? \n\n      The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\" -> meaning that they cannot have the same non-zero total? \n\n      But we have 3 and 3? \n\n      I see: the problem says \"they want to be fair\" meaning that the total weight of candies eaten by Alice must equal that eaten by Bob. \n\n      And we have 3==3? \n\n      The note says the answer is 0? \n\n      This is confusing.\n\n  Let me check the sample test cases from the problem:\n\n      Test case 1: n=2, [1,2] -> answer=2? but the note says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2\"\n\n      Test case 2: n=6, [1,1,1,1,1,1] -> answer=6? but the note says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> wait, that doesn't match: the weights are [1,1,1,1,1,1]? \n\n      Actually, the second test case in the note: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n      So the weights for the second test case must be [7, ...]? \n\n      The note says: \n          \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n      So the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> n=8.\n\n      Therefore, the third test case must be [3,6,3]? and the note says the answer is 0? \n\n      Why? \n\n      I see: the problem says \"they want to eat the same total weight of candies\". But note: if they eat the two candies (first and last) then the total weight is 3 for Alice and 3 for Bob -> same. \n\n      But the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\" -> meaning that they cannot achieve a non-zero total that is equal? \n\n      But they did achieve 3 and 3? \n\n      The problem says: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" -> so we are maximizing the total number of candies? \n\n      In the third test case: \n          We found 2 candies? \n          But the note says the answer is 0? \n\n      This is a contradiction.\n\n  After checking the original problem (from a contest): \n      The problem is \"Candies\" from Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3), problem C.\n\n      The sample test cases for that problem are:\n        Input: \n            4\n            3\n            10 20 10\n            6\n            2 1 4 2 4 1\n            5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            6\n            1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n        Output:\n            2\n            6\n            0\n            6\n\n      So the third test case is [1,2,3,4,5] -> and the answer is 0.\n\n      And the first test case: [10,20,10] -> answer=2: \n          Alice: [10] (from left) -> 10\n          Bob: [10] (from right) -> 10\n          total candies=2.\n\n      The second test case: [2,1,4,2,4,1] -> answer=6: \n          Alice: [2,1,4] -> 2+1+4=7\n          Bob: [2,4,1] -> 2+4+1=7? but wait: \n          The array: [2,1,4,2,4,1] -> Bob must take from the right: [1,4,2]? but that is 1+4+2=7? \n          But the note says: Bob eats the first three from the right: [1,4,2]? \n          However, the problem says: Bob eats from the right: contiguous segment from the right? so he can take [1,4,2]? but that is not contiguous from the right? \n          Actually, the contiguous segment from the right must be the last three: [2,4,1]? \n          But 2+4+1=7? \n\n          So Alice: [2,1,4] (from the left) and Bob: [2,4,1] (from the right) -> but note: the array is [2,1,4,2,4,1]. \n          If Alice takes the first three: [2,1,4] and Bob takes the last three: [2,4,1] -> then the middle two are not taken? \n          But the problem says: they cannot eat the same candy? and the middle two are not eaten? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" meaning contiguous from the right? so the last three: indices 3,4,5? \n          But the array: \n            index0:2 (Alice)\n            index1:1 (Alice)\n            index2:4 (Alice)\n            index3:2 (Bob)\n            index4:4 (Bob)\n            index5:1 (Bob)\n\n          So Bob's segment is [2,4,1]? which is contiguous from the right? \n\n          Then total candies: 3+3=6.\n\n      The third test case: [1,2,3,4,5] -> why 0? \n          We need to find contiguous segments from the left and right that do not overlap and have the same total? \n          Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1,2,3,4] -> 10, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [4,5] -> 9 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [4,5] -> 9 -> not equal.\n          ... \n          There is no way? \n\n      Therefore, the third test case is [1,2,3,4,5] and the answer is 0.\n\n      But the note in the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n      So the sample test case [3,6,3] was not the third test case? \n\n      The problem says: \n          \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n      So the fourth test case: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> n=8.\n\n      Therefore, the third test case in the problem's note is [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n      But the problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\" for the third test case: n=5, [1,2,3,4,5] -> and the answer is 0.\n\n      So our algorithm for [1,2,3,4,5]:\n          Step0: a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add w0=1 -> a=1, l=1 -> check: 1==0? no.\n          Step1: a=1, b=0 -> a>0 -> add w4=5 -> b=5, h=3 -> check: 1==5? no.\n          Step2: a=1, b=5 -> a<=b -> add w1=2 -> a=3, l=2 -> check: 3==5? no.\n          Step3: a=3, b=5 -> a<=b -> add w2=3 -> a=6, l=3 -> check: 6==5? no.\n          Step4: a=6, b=5 -> a>5 -> add w3=4 -> b=9, h=2 -> check: 6==9? no.\n          Then l=3, h=2 -> break.\n\n          We never had a==b? so ans remains 0? \n\n      So we output 0? which is correct.\n\n      But what about [3,6,3]? \n          We have: \n            Step0: a=0, b=0 -> a<=b -> add 3 -> a=3, l=1 -> check: 3==0? no.\n            Step1: a=3, b=0 -> a>0 -> add last 3 -> b=3, h=1 -> check: 3==3 -> ans = 1 (from left) + (3-1-1)=1+1=2 -> so we output 2.\n\n      But the problem says: the third test case is [1,2,3,4,5]? and the fourth is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? \n\n      So the example [3,6,3] is not provided? \n\n      Therefore, our algorithm for program1.py is:\n\n        for t in range(int(input())):\n            n = int(input())\n            l1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            l = 0\n            h = n-1\n            ans = 0\n            a = 0\n            b = 0\n            while l <= h:\n                if a > b:\n                    b += l1[h]\n                    h -= 1\n                else:\n                    a += l1[l]   # because we are in the else: a<=b -> so we add to Alice to try to catch up?\n                    l += 1\n                if a == b:\n                    ans = l + (n - h - 1)   # because we have eaten l from left and (n-1 - h) from right? \n            print(ans)\n\n      But wait: what if we have multiple opportunities? we update ans every time we get a balance? and we want the maximum? \n\n      However, note: as we move the pointers, the total number of candies (l + n-h-1) is increasing? \n          Because we are always adding one candy per step? \n          Actually, we do one step per iteration: either l increases or h decreases? so the total candies eaten is increasing? \n\n      But we are updating ans whenever we get a balance? and we are going to cover the entire array? \n\n      However, the total candies eaten is l + (n-h-1). \n          Initially: l=0, h=n-1 -> total=0 + (n - (n-1) - 1)=0.\n          Then we add one candy: either l becomes 1 -> total=1 + (n - (n-1) -1)=1+0=1? \n          or h becomes n-2 -> total=0 + (n - (n-2) -1)=0+ (2-1)=1.\n\n      Then we update ans only when we get a balance? \n\n      But note: the total candies is increasing? because we are adding one per step? and we are going to do at most n steps? \n\n      However, we are not necessarily increasing the total candies? because when we update, we are adding one candy, but the total candies is l + (n-h-1). \n\n      Actually, l is increasing and h is decreasing? so the total candies is l + (n-h-1) = (l) + (n-1-h) -> which is increasing? because l is increasing and h is decreasing? \n\n      But note: when we add to Alice: l increases by 1 -> total increases by 1.\n      When we add to Bob: h decreases by 1 -> then (n-1-h) increases by 1? because h becomes h-1, so n-1-(h-1) = n-1-h+1 = (n-1-h)+1 -> so total increases by 1.\n\n      So the total candies is the number of steps? \n\n      Therefore, the last balance we get will be the one with the maximum total candies? \n\n      But what if we get a balance at step k and then at step k' (k'>k) we get another balance? then k' has more candies? \n\n      So we want the last balance? \n\n      However, we update ans every time we get a balance? so we record the last balance? \n\n      Example: [1,1,1,1] \n          Step0: a=0, b=0 -> add Alice: a=1, l=1 -> total=1 -> no balance.\n          Step1: a=1, b=0 -> add Bob: b=1, h=2 -> balance: a==b=1 -> ans = 1 (from left) + (4-2-1)=1+1=2.\n          Step2: l=1, h=2 -> a=1, b=1 -> add Alice: a=2, l=2 -> no balance? \n          Step3: a=2, b=1 -> add Bob: b=2, h=1 -> balance: a==b=2 -> ans = 2 (from left) + (4-1-1)=2+2=4.\n\n          Then we break? because l=2, h=1 -> l>h? \n\n          So we output 4? which is correct.\n\n      Therefore, we update ans every time we get a balance? and the last balance will be the one with the maximum total candies? \n\n      So the code for program1.py is as above.\n\n      But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 200000? so we are doing at most 200000 steps? \n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n          a = a + l1[l]\n          l = l + 1\n\n      However, we must be cautious: what if l is already at the end? \n          The while condition is l<=h, so when we are at the else block, l<=h? so we can safely take l1[l]? \n\n      So we write:\n\n        else:\n            a += l1[l]\n            l += 1\n\n  Now for program2.py:\n\n  Problem: \n      We have a stamp that covers two adjacent cells and colors them as BR or RB. We can use the stamp multiple times, and it can overlap arbitrarily. We start with a white (W) row of cells. We are given a target string s (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B'). We must determine if it is possible to achieve s.\n\n  Approach:\n      The note says: \n          - The stamp must cover two adjacent cells? and we can rotate it? so we can use either BR or RB.\n          - We can stamp multiple times on the same cell? but note: each stamping recolors both cells? \n\n      Important: \n          - We cannot stamp a single cell? because the stamp covers two adjacent cells.\n\n      Therefore, if there is a single cell that is not white? then we must have at least two non-white cells? and they must be adjacent? \n\n      But note: we can overlap? so we can have long segments? \n\n      Observation:\n          - The entire segment of non-white cells must be contiguous? because we stamp two adjacent cells? and we can only stamp contiguous segments? \n\n      However, note: we can leave white gaps? but the stamp must cover two adjacent cells? so if we have two non-white cells that are separated by a white? then we cannot have stamped the two non-white cells? because the stamp covers two adjacent? \n\n      Actually, the stamping operations can be done arbitrarily? but the stamp must cover two adjacent cells? and we can do multiple stampings? \n\n      How about the following: \n          We can break the string into contiguous segments of non-white cells? because white cells must remain white? and we never stamp a white cell to make it white? \n\n      So we can split the string by 'W' and then check each contiguous non-white segment independently.\n\n      For a contiguous segment of non-white cells (say of length L):\n          - If L==1: then we cannot have a non-white? because we cannot stamp a single cell? -> invalid.\n          - If L>=2: then we need to check if we can form the segment with the stamp? \n\n      But note: the stamping operations can overlap arbitrarily? and we can use either BR or RB? \n\n      What are the constraints on the segment?\n          - The segment must be colorable with the two colors? and the pattern must be such that adjacent cells are different? \n\n      However, note: we can use the stamp multiple times? and the stamp always colors two adjacent cells with different colors? \n\n      Therefore, the entire segment must be bipartite? meaning that adjacent cells must be different? \n\n      But wait: we can stamp arbitrarily? and we can cover the same cell multiple times? \n\n      Example: \n          We want to make \"RR\": \n            We can do: \n                Start: WW\n                Stamp the two with RB? -> then we get RB? \n                Then we stamp the same two again? but this time we use BR? -> then we get BR? \n                Then we stamp again? ... \n\n          How does the stamping work? \n            The stamping operation: \n                It sets two adjacent cells to either (B,R) or (R,B). \n\n          So if we stamp the same pair multiple times, the colors will alternate? \n\n          Therefore, the color of a cell is determined by the number of times it has been stamped? \n            - If a cell is stamped an odd number of times, then it will be the opposite of the initial (which is white? but white is not R or B) -> actually, we start with white? and then the first stamp sets it to either R or B? \n\n          However, note: we can also have overlapping stampings? \n\n          Example: \n            Three cells: \n              We can stamp [0,1] with BR -> [B, R, W]\n              Then stamp [1,2] with RB -> [B, B, B]? \n                  But wait: the stamp sets the two cells to (R,B) or (B,R). \n                  So if we stamp [1,2] with RB: then cell1 becomes R? but it was R? then we set it to B? and cell2 becomes B? \n                  So we get [B, B, B]? \n\n          But we want to make \"BBB\" -> is that possible? \n\n          However, the problem says: \n              For the fifth test case: \"BRB\" -> possible? \n              For the sixth: \"RBB\" -> possible? \n              For the seventh: \"W\" -> possible? \n\n          But what about \"BBB\"? \n\n          How to achieve \"BBB\" for three cells? \n            We start: WWW\n            Step1: stamp [0,1] with BR: -> [B,R,W]\n            Step2: stamp [0,1] again with BR: -> [R,B,W] -> because the first stamp: set to BR, then the same stamp again: sets to BR? but wait: \n                The stamp sets the two cells to BR? so if we apply the same stamp again, it will set [0,1] to BR? so we get BR? \n            Step3: stamp [0,1] with BR: -> [B,R,W] -> it alternates? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use different rotations? \n            Step1: [0,1] with BR -> [B,R,W]\n            Step2: [0,1] with RB -> [R, B, W] -> because RB: so set cell0 to R and cell1 to B? \n            Step3: [0,1] with BR -> [B, R, W] -> and so on.\n\n          How to get BBB? \n            We can also stamp [1,2]:\n            Step1: [0,1] with BR -> [B,R,W]\n            Step2: [1,2] with RB -> [B, B, B]? \n                Because: \n                  [1,2] is set to RB: so cell1 becomes R? but wait: the stamp sets the two cells to the colors? \n                  Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to the pattern: \n                      If we use RB on [1,2]: then cell1 becomes R? and cell2 becomes B? \n                  So we get [B, R, B]? \n\n          How to get [B, B, B]? \n            Step1: [0,1] with BR -> [B,R,W]\n            Step2: [0,1] with BR again -> [R,B,W] -> because the stamp sets to BR: so cell0 becomes B? then if we apply BR again, it sets cell0 to R and cell1 to B? \n            Step3: [1,2] with BR -> [R, R, B] -> then we have R at cell1? \n            Step4: [0,1] with BR -> [B, R, B] -> not BBB.\n\n          It seems difficult? \n\n      After reading the note: \n          The fifth test case: \"BRB\" -> possible? \n          The sixth: \"RBB\" -> possible? \n          The seventh: \"W\" -> possible? \n\n      And the second, third, fourth test cases: \n          \"RR\", \"R\", \"B\" -> not possible? \n\n      Therefore, the conditions for a contiguous segment of non-white cells:\n          - It must have at least two cells? \n          - And the entire segment must not be of the same color? \n\n      But wait: the fifth test case: \"BRB\" -> has two B's and one R? and it is possible? \n          The segment \"BRB\": \n            adjacent: \n                cell0: B, cell1: R -> different? \n                cell1: R, cell2: B -> different? \n            so it is alternating? \n\n      The sixth: \"RBB\": \n          cell0: R, cell1: B -> different? \n          cell1: B, cell2: B -> same? \n\n      But the note says the sixth test case: \n          \"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> RBB\" \n          How? \n            Step1: stamp the middle and right: [1,2] with RB? -> then we get: \n                WWW -> stamp [1,2] with RB: -> W, R, B -> so the string is \"WRB\"? \n            But the target is \"RBB\" -> which is R at index0, B at index1, B at index2? \n\n          How to get R at index0? \n            Step1: stamp [0,1] with RB: -> [R, B, W] \n            Step2: stamp [1,2] with BR: -> [R, R, B]? -> because stamping [1,2] with BR: sets cell1 to B? but wait: \n                Actually, the stamp sets the two cells: \n                    [1,2] with BR: sets cell1 to B and cell2 to R? -> then we get [R, B, R]? \n\n          The note says: \n              \"WWW -> W RB -> RBB\" \n              Step1: WWW -> stamp [1,2] with RB: -> then we get: W, R, B -> \"WRB\" \n              Then step2: stamp [0,1] with RB? -> then [0,1] becomes RB? so we get R, B, B -> \"RBB\"\n\n          So it is possible? \n\n      Therefore, the segment \"RBB\" is possible? even though it has two adjacent B's? \n\n      How? \n          The key: the same cell can be stamped multiple times? and the color flips? \n\n          In the example: \n            Step1: stamp [1,2] with RB: \n                cell1: W -> R? \n                cell2: W -> B? \n                -> \"WRB\"\n\n            Step2: stamp [0,1] with RB: \n                cell0: W -> R? \n                cell1: R -> becomes B? because the stamp sets the two cells to RB? meaning: \n                    The stamp sets the two cells: \n                        cell0: R (if we use RB: the first cell becomes R? but wait: the stamp can be used as either BR or RB? \n                    Actually, the stamp has two forms: \n                        Form1: left becomes B, right becomes R? \n                        Form2: left becomes R, right becomes B? \n\n                In step2, we use the stamp on [0,1] as RB? meaning: \n                    We want the left cell (0) to become R and the right cell (1) to become B? \n                So we set cell0 to R and cell1 to B? \n                Then we get: R, B, B -> \"RBB\"\n\n          So the segment \"RBB\" is possible? \n\n      But note: the segment \"RBB\" has two adjacent B's? but that is at positions 1 and 2? and we did not stamp [1,2] again? \n\n      How about the constraint that adjacent cells must be different? \n          The problem does not require that adjacent cells are different? \n          The stamp always sets two adjacent cells to different colors? but then we can stamp different pairs? \n\n      However, after multiple stampings, adjacent cells might become the same? \n\n      Therefore, the condition is not that the entire segment must be alternating? \n\n      What is the invariant? \n\n      Insight: \n          The stamping operation: \n              It sets two adjacent cells to one of the two patterns: { (R,B), (B,R) }.\n\n          Therefore, the entire segment must have at least one R and at least one B? \n\n          Why? \n              Because if we have a segment of all R's? \n                  How to get an R? \n                  We start with W. \n                  To get an R, we must be stamped at least once? and in that stamping, the adjacent cell must be set to B? \n                  But then we have at least one B? \n\n          Similarly, if we have a segment of all B's? we must have at least one R? \n\n          Therefore, a segment of all R's is impossible? and a segment of all B's is impossible? \n\n      So the conditions for a contiguous segment (non-white) of length L:\n          - L>=2? \n          - The segment must contain at least one R and at least one B? \n\n      But what about \"RBR\" (alternating)? \n          It has at least one R and one B? -> valid.\n\n      What about \"RBB\" (as above)? \n          It has at least one R and one B? -> valid.\n\n      What about \"RRB\"? \n          We can do: \n            Start: WWW\n            Step1: stamp [0,1] with RB: -> [R, B, W]\n            Step2: stamp [0,1] again with BR: -> [B, R, W] -> then we have [B,R,W]\n            Step3: stamp [1,2] with RB: -> [B, R, B] -> but we want \"RRB\" at positions: \n                We want: \n                    index0: R -> but we have B? \n            Alternatively:\n                Step1: [0,1] with RB: -> [R,B,W]\n                Step2: [1,2] with BR: -> [R, R, B]? \n                    Because: stamp [1,2] with BR: sets cell1 to B and cell2 to R? -> [R, B, R]? \n                Step3: then we can stamp [0,1] with RB: -> [R becomes R? but wait: \n                    We set [0,1] to RB: so cell0 becomes R? and cell1 becomes B? -> [R, B, R] -> not RRB.\n\n          How to get RRB? \n            Step1: [0,1] with RB: -> [R, B, W]\n            Step2: [0,1] again with RB: -> [R, B] becomes RB? -> so we set cell0 to R and cell1 to B? -> same? \n            Step3: [0,1] with BR: -> [B, R, W]\n            Step4: [0,1] with RB: -> [R, B, W] -> it alternates.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n            Step1: [0,1] with RB: -> [R,B,W]\n            Step2: [0,1] with RB: again? -> [R,B] -> same? \n            Step3: [0,1] with BR: -> [B,R,W]\n            Step4: [0,1] with BR: -> [R,B,W] -> no.\n\n          How about:\n            Step1: [0,1] with RB: -> [R,B,W]\n            Step2: [0,1] with BR: -> [B,R,W]\n            Step3: [0,1] with RB: -> [R,B,W] -> same as step1.\n\n          How to get the middle cell to R? \n            We can stamp [1,2]? \n            Step1: [0,1] with RB: -> [R,B,W]\n            Step2: [1,2] with RB: -> [R, R, B] -> then we have \"RRB\" -> that's it.\n\n          So \"RRB\" is possible? \n\n      Therefore, the condition: \n          - The segment must have at least one R and at least one B? \n\n      And note: the entire segment must be contiguous? \n\n      So the algorithm for program2.py:\n\n        We split the string by 'W' to get the contiguous non-white segments.\n\n        For each segment:\n            If the segment is empty? skip.\n            If the segment has length 1: then it's impossible -> we return \"NO\".\n            If the segment has length>=2: \n                Check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? \n                If not (i.e., if the segment is all 'R' or all 'B'), then impossible.\n\n        If all segments are valid, then \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n      But note: what if the entire string is white? \n          Then we have no non-white segment? -> valid.\n\n      Example test cases from the problem:\n\n        Test case: \"RR\" -> \n            Segment: \"RR\" -> length>=2 -> but it has no 'B'? -> invalid -> \"NO\". -> matches the note: \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible\" -> the second test case: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> \"NO\".\n\n        Test case: \"R\" -> length=1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n        Test case: \"B\" -> length=1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n        Test case: \"BRB\" -> \n            Segment: \"BRB\" -> has at least one 'B' and one 'R'? -> valid.\n\n        Test case: \"RBB\" -> \n            Segment: \"RBB\" -> has at least one 'R' and one 'B'? -> valid.\n\n        Test case: \"W\" -> valid.\n\n      But what about the example: \"RRB\" -> we saw it is possible? \n          Segment: \"RRB\" -> has at least one R and one B? -> valid.\n\n      However, what about \"RRR\"? \n          Segment: \"RRR\" -> no 'B'? -> invalid.\n\n      Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:   # note: the input: first line t, then for each test case: n and then a string. We are taking every second line starting from index2? \n            b = 0   # we will set b=1 if we find an invalid segment?\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # we split the string (without the newline) by 'W'\n                # i is a contiguous non-white segment? \n                if i == '': \n                    continue\n                if len(i)==1: \n                    b = 1   # invalid\n                else:\n                    # check if it has at least one 'R' and one 'B'\n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b = 1   # invalid\n            # Then we print: \n            #   if b==0 -> \"YES\", else \"NO\"\n            # The print: 'YNEOS'[b::2] -> \n            #   if b=0: then 'YNEOS'[0::2] -> take every 2nd char starting at 0: 'YES'\n            #   if b=1: then 'YNEOS'[1::2] -> 'NO'\n            print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n      But note: the input: \n          The first line: t\n          Then for each test case: \n              first line: n\n              second line: the string\n\n          We are reading: [*open(0)] -> which is a list of lines.\n\n          Then [2::2] -> starting from index2 (the first test case string is at index2? because index0: t, index1: n for first test, index2: string for first test, index3: n for second test, index4: string for second test, ...) -> so we take every second line starting at index2: that is the strings.\n\n          Then we split each string by 'W'? and check the segments.\n\n      However, note: the string might have a newline? we do s[:-1] to remove the newline? \n\n      But what if the last line doesn't have a newline? \n\n      Since the problem says: the total n over test cases <= 100000, and we are reading from stdin, we assume the input ends with a newline? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use .strip()? but the problem says the string has length n? \n\n      We do: s[:-1] -> but if the last line doesn't have a newline, then s might not have a newline? \n\n      How about: \n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()   # remove newline and any extra spaces? but the problem says only W, R, B.\n\n      But the problem says: the string only contains W, R, B.\n\n      Alternatively, we can do: \n          for i in s.strip().split('W'):\n\n      However, the skeleton uses: s[:-1].split('W') -> so we must use that? \n\n      But if the last test case does not have a newline, then s might not have a newline? then s[:-1] would remove the last character? which is bad.\n\n      Therefore, we can do: \n          s = s.rstrip('\\n')   # but the skeleton uses s[:-1] -> so we stick to that? \n\n      But the problem says: the total length of the string over test cases <= 100000? and we are guaranteed the format? \n\n      We'll assume the input has a newline? \n\n      Alternatively, we can do: \n          s = s.rstrip()\n\n      But the skeleton uses: s[:-1] -> so we do as the skeleton? \n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the body of the for-loop? \n\n      We write:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i:   # if i is not empty\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b = 1\n                else:\n                    if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                        b = 1\n\n      But note: we can break early? but the problem says the total length is <=100000? and we are doing one pass? \n\n      However, we can also set b=1 and break? but the problem does not require that.\n\n      We can do:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i != '':   # non-empty segment\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b = 1\n                    # we can break? but the problem says the total n<=100000? and we are processing each segment? \n                elif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n\n      But note: we must check all segments? because if one segment is invalid, then the whole is invalid? so we can break? but we don't have to? \n\n      However, we can set b=1 and then continue? because we are going to check the condition at the end? \n\n      But we can break early? \n\n      But the problem: the total length of the string over test cases <= 100000? so we can do without break? \n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i:   # non-empty\n                if len(i)==1 or 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    # break? but we can break? but there might be multiple segments? \n                    # Actually, we can break the inner loop? but we must check all segments? \n                    # Because if one segment is invalid, then the answer is \"NO\", so we can break the inner loop? but we don't need to break the entire test case? because we are going to set b=1 and then the rest of the segments don't matter? \n                    # But we can break the inner loop? but we are in a for-loop? we can break out of the for-loop? \n                    # However, we can simply set b=1 and then break? to avoid unnecessary checks? \n                    break   # break the inner for-loop? \n\n      But note: we are iterating over segments? if one segment is invalid, then the entire test case is invalid? so we can break? \n\n      However, the problem says the total length of the string over test cases <= 100000? and the worst-case we do one pass? \n\n      We can do:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i:   # non-empty\n                if len(i)==1:\n                    b = 1\n                    break   # break the inner for-loop? \n                if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n      But what if there are multiple segments? and the first segment is valid? but the second is invalid? we must check all? \n\n      Therefore, we cannot break? \n\n      Example: \n          s = \"RWWB\" -> \n            split by 'W': ['R', '', 'B'] -> \n            segment1: \"R\" -> invalid -> so we set b=1 and break? \n            segment2: \"\" -> skip.\n            segment3: \"B\" -> invalid? but we already broke? \n\n      Actually, we break the inner for-loop? so we skip the rest of the segments? \n\n      But we only need one invalid segment to make the entire test case invalid? so we can break? \n\n      However, we are setting b=1 and then we break? then we skip the rest of the segments? which is fine? \n\n      But what if we have two segments: \n          segment1: valid? \n          segment2: invalid? \n          then we set b=1 and break? -> correct.\n\n      But what if we have two segments: \n          segment1: invalid? -> set b=1 and break? -> then we don't check segment2? but that's okay? \n\n      Therefore, we can break to save time? \n\n      Alternatively, we can do without break? \n\n      Since the total length of the string is <=100000? and the total over test cases is <=100000? we can do without break? \n\n      But the problem says the total n over test cases <=100000? so the total length of all strings is <=100000? \n\n      Therefore, we can do:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i:   # non-empty\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    # and we break? or not? \n                    # We break to avoid unnecessary checks? but the problem constraints are small? \n                    # But worst-case: we have one test case with a long string? and we break at the first segment? \n                    # Without break, we do a full scan? \n                    # Since the total length is bounded, we can do without break? \n\n      However, the skeleton does not have a break? \n\n      We'll do without break? \n\n      But note: the condition: \n          if len(i)==1: invalid.\n          else: if the segment has no 'R' or no 'B': invalid.\n\n      We can combine:\n\n          if len(i)==1 or (set(i) != {'R','B'}): \n          But wait: set(i) might be {'R','B'}? but if the segment has both R and B? then set(i) is {'R','B'}? \n          But if the segment is \"RRB\", set(i) is {'R','B'}? -> valid? \n          But if the segment is \"RR\", set(i) is {'R'} -> then we want to set b=1? \n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          if len(i)==1 or (set(i) in [{'R'}, {'B'}]): \n              b=1\n\n      But that is the same as:\n\n          if len(i)==1 or (set(i)=={'R'}) or (set(i)=={'B'}): \n              b=1\n\n      But note: the set of a string of length 1: set(i) is a singleton? so we would set b=1? which is already covered by len(i)==1? \n\n      So we can do:\n\n          if len(i)==1:\n              b=1\n          else:\n              if set(i)=={'R'} or set(i)=={'B'}:\n                  b=1\n\n      But creating a set for each segment? the total length of the string is 100000? and the total over test cases is 100000? but the sum of the lengths of the strings is 100000? so the total work is O(n)? \n\n      Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          if len(i)==1:\n              b=1\n          else:\n              hasR = False\n              hasB = False\n              for char in i:\n                  if char=='R': hasR=True\n                  if char=='B': hasB=True\n              if not (hasR and hasB):\n                  b=1\n\n      This is O(|i|) per segment? and the total over segments is the length of the string? so overall O(n)? \n\n      But the problem: the total n over test cases <=100000? so we can do.\n\n      However, the skeleton does not specify? \n\n      We choose the efficient one? \n\n      But note: the condition: \n          if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i: \n          This is O(|i|) per segment? and the total over segments is the length of the string? so overall O(n)? \n\n      So we can do:\n\n          if len(i)==1:\n              b=1\n          else:\n              if 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                  b=1\n\n      This is the same as: \n          if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i): \n              b=1\n\n      But note: if the segment has length>=2, then we check if it has at least one R and one B? \n\n      However, if the segment has no R? then 'R' not in i -> True -> set b=1.\n      Similarly, if the segment has no B? then set b=1.\n\n      But if the segment has both? then we don't set b=1.\n\n      So we can write:\n\n          if i:   # non-empty\n              if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n\n      But note: if the segment has length>=2 and has both R and B? then we don't set b=1.\n\n      Therefore, the code for the for-loop in program2.py is:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n              if i:   # non-empty segment\n                  if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                      b = 1\n\n      However, we can also write without the if i: because if i is empty, then len(i)==0, and we skip? \n\n      But we have:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n              if i:   # then we check\n\n      Alternatively, we can skip empty segments? \n\n      So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n              if i:   # non-empty\n                  if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                      b = 1\n\n      But note: the condition: \n          if len(i)==1: then we set b=1.\n          else: if the segment has no R or no B: set b=1.\n\n      This matches.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n            l = l + 1\", \"program2\": \"if i: # non-empty segment\\n            if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n                b = 1\"}\n\n  But note: the program2.py code must be indented properly? \n\n  The skeleton for program2.py:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b=0\n          for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n          print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n  We must complete the for-loop body? \n\n  We write:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n          if i:   # non-empty\n              if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n\n  But note: the condition: \n      if len(i)==1: invalid.\n      or if there's no R? or if there's no B? \n\n  We can write:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n          if i: \n              if len(i)==1 or not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                  b = 1\n\n  But that is the same.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n          if i: \n              if len(i)==1:\n                  b = 1\n              elif 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i:\n                  b = 1\n\n  But the combined condition is also clear.\n\n  We choose the combined condition.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if i: \n            if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n\n  But note: the condition \"('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i)\" is equivalent to \"not ('R' in i and 'B' in i)\".\n\n  We write it as above.\n\n  Now, we output the JSON.\n\n  Important: the code must be exactly as it would appear in the program? \n\n  For program1.py: the missing code is two lines? and they are indented by 8 spaces? because the else: is at the same level as the if? and the if is indented by 4? \n\n  The skeleton:\n\n        while(l<=h):\n            if(a>b):\n                b=b+l1[h]\n                h=h-1\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n                a = a + l1[l]\n                l = l + 1\n\n  But note: the existing code uses b=b+l1[h] and h=h-1? so we use the same style? \n\n  We write:\n\n                a = a + l1[l]\n                l = l + 1\n\n  For program2.py: the missing code is the body of the for-loop? \n\n  The skeleton:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n  We write:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i: \n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n\n  But note: the existing code has the for-loop already? so we only need the body? \n\n  Actually, the skeleton has:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we must complete the body? \n\n  We write the body as:\n\n            if i: \n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n\n  But note: the variable b is defined as 0 at the beginning? \n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n                l = l + 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"if i: \\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n                    b = 1\"\n      }\n\n  However, the program2 part: the body of the for-loop? \n\n  But the for-loop is already written? we only need the body? \n\n  The skeleton for program2.py has the for-loop header? so we only write the body? \n\n  But the body must be indented? \n\n  The entire for-loop in program2.py after completion:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i: \n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n\n  But note: the existing code has a comment at the end of the for-loop header? we remove the comment? \n\n  Actually, the skeleton has:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the comment with the body? \n\n  So the body is:\n\n            if i: \n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n\n  But the indentation: the for-loop body must be indented by 4 spaces? \n\n  In the skeleton, the for-loop is at the same level as the b=0? so the body should be indented by 4 spaces? \n\n  Therefore, we write:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i: \n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n\n  But in the JSON string, we must represent the newlines? \n\n  We write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"if i: \\n            if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n                b = 1\"\n\n  But wait: the existing for-loop header is already there? we are only providing the body? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\" and we are to fill in. \n\n  For program2.py, the missing block is the body of the for-loop? \n\n  Therefore, we output the body? \n\n  But note: the body is a block of three lines? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT the entire program\".\n\n  So for program1.py, we output the two lines that go in the else block? \n\n  For program2.py, we output the three lines that form the body of the for-loop? \n\n  But the body of the for-loop in program2.py is:\n\n        if i: \n            if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                b = 1\n\n  And we must indent it appropriately? \n\n  In the skeleton, the for-loop header is at the same level as the b=0? and the body must be indented one level? \n\n  So the body should be indented by 4 spaces? \n\n  But in the JSON string, we write the code as a string? \n\n  We write:\n\n      \"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n                l = l + 1\",\n      \"program2\": \"if i: \\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n                    b = 1\"\n\n  However, the program1 part: the two lines? and we have 16 spaces at the beginning of each? because the else block is indented by 12? and then the two lines should be indented by 16? \n\n  But the existing code in the else block? the skeleton has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with two lines? each indented by 12 (if we count the base indentation of the while loop as 8? and the if/else as 12? \n\n  Actually, the skeleton:\n\n        while(l<=h):\n            if(a>b):\n                b=b+l1[h]\n                h=h-1\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The else block is at the same level as the if block? which is 4 spaces? \n\n  But the code inside the if block is indented by 8? \n\n  So the two lines for the else block should be indented by 8? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation? but we must match the style? \n\n  The existing code in the if block:\n\n                b=b+l1[h]\n                h=h-1\n\n  So we do the same for the else block:\n\n                a = a + l1[l]\n                l = l + 1\n\n  Therefore, the two lines for program1.py are:\n\n        a = a + l1[l]\n        l = l + 1\n\n  But we must write them with the same indentation as the if block? \n\n  In the JSON, we write the two lines with a newline and the same indentation? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and we are to output the two lines? \n\n  We write:\n\n        \"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l + 1\"\n\n  But wait: the existing if block has two lines? and they are indented by 8? so we do the same? \n\n  Actually, the skeleton uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n  The else: is at level 4? and the code inside should be at level 8? \n\n  So we write:\n\n        \"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l + 1\"\n\n  For program2.py: the body of the for-loop? \n\n  The for-loop is at the same level as the b=0? which is level 4? and the body should be indented by 8? \n\n  But the body we are writing has:\n\n        if i:   -> at level 8? \n            if ... -> at level 12? \n                b=1 -> at level 16? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact number? but we must match the style? \n\n  Alternatively, we can write without extra indentation? and the user will insert? \n\n  But the problem says: we are to fill in the missing lines? \n\n  We assume that the base indentation for the for-loop body is 4? \n\n  Then:\n\n        for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            # body: we write:\n            if i: \n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n\n  So the body has:\n\n        Line1: if i:   -> indented by 4? \n        Line2: if ... -> indented by 8? \n        Line3: b=1 -> indented by 12? \n\n  But the existing for-loop header is at level 4? and the body must be indented by 4? \n\n  Actually, in Python, the body of a for-loop must be indented? \n\n  We write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"if i:\\n    if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\"\n\n  But that might be too little? \n\n  Alternatively, we write with 4 spaces per level? \n\n  We choose:\n\n        \"program2\": \"if i:\\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n                    b = 1\"\n\n  But the exact number of spaces? \n\n  The skeleton for program2.py has:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            b=0\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n            print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n  The for-loop body is missing? \n\n  We are to write the body? which should be at the same level as the b=0? \n\n  Actually, the body of the outer for-loop is the entire block from b=0 to the print? \n\n  The inner for-loop body must be indented by 4 relative to the inner for-loop? \n\n  So:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            b=0\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # this line is at level 4? \n                ...   # this must be at level 8? \n            print(...)   # at level 4? \n\n  Therefore, the body of the inner for-loop must be indented by 8? \n\n  Then the if i: must be at level 8? \n        the next if: at level 12? \n        the b=1: at level 16? \n\n  But the problem does not specify? \n\n  We write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"if i:\\n                if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n                    b = 1\"\n\n  with 16 spaces for the first line of the body? \n\n  But that is not necessary? \n\n  Alternatively, we can write without specifying the exact spaces? and use the same as the skeleton? \n\n  Since the skeleton uses 4 spaces per indent? \n\n  We write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"    if i:\\n        if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n            b = 1\"\n\n  But that would be:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n    if i:\n        if ...:\n\n  which is not valid? \n\n  We must not add extra indentation? because the for-loop already requires one indent? \n\n  The body of the for-loop should be one indent more than the for-loop header? \n\n  In the skeleton, the for-loop header is at level 4? so the body should be at level 8? \n\n  We write the body as:\n\n        if i:   # at level 8? \n            if ...:   # at level 12? \n                b=1   # at level 16? \n\n  But we can write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"if i:\\n    if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\"\n\n  and then when inserted, it will be:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i:\n                    if ...:\n                        b = 1\n\n  which is 4 spaces for the for-loop body, then 4 more for the if, then 4 more for the inner if, then 4 more for the assignment? \n\n  But the total: \n      The for-loop body: one level: 4 spaces? \n          then the if i: -> 4 more? total 8? \n          then the inner if: 4 more? total 12? \n          then the assignment: 4 more? total 16? \n\n  That matches.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l + 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"if i:\\n    if len(i)==1 or ('R' not in i) or ('B' not in i):\\n        b = 1\"\n      }\n\n  But wait: the program1 part: the two lines? we have \"\\n        \" meaning a newline and 8 spaces? \n\n  But the existing if block has:\n\n        b=b+l1[h]\n        h=h-1\n\n  which are two lines? and they are at the same level? \n\n  We want the two lines for the else block to be at the same level? \n\n  We write:\n\n        \"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l + 1\"\n\n  This will be inserted as:\n\n            else:\n                a = a + l1[l]\n                l = l + 1\n\n  which is 8 spaces for the two lines? \n\n  This matches the if block.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer."
