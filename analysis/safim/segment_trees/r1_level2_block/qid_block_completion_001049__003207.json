(2,4): 2->1->3->4 -> three edges. But the pair (2,4) is not in the summation in the note? The note only lists 5 pairs. The summation in the problem is over all pairs: 1<=i<j<=n. There are 6 pairs for n=4. The note lists only 5 terms. Why? The matrix has:\n            c[0][1]=566, c[0][2]=239, c[0][3]=1, \n            c[1][2]=1, c[1][3]=2, \n            c[2][3]=30. So the pairs are:\n            (0,1): 566\n            (0,2): 239\n            (0,3): 1\n            (1,2): 1\n            (1,3): 2\n            (2,3): 30\n\n        The note lists:\n            566 (0,1) -> d=1\n            239 (0,2) -> d=1  -> but in the tree, (0,2) is (1,3) in the node numbering? This is very confusing.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts. We must output only the missing code in a JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is the length if the sum is positive, negative of the length if the sum is negative, and 0 if zero.\n\nThe provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to compute the maximum value. The missing part is in the loop for i in range(1, n+1). After updating dp[i], we also update a dictionary `dmx` that stores the best dp value for a given prefix sum.\n\nThe comment says: \n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should update `dmx[pref[i]]` to be at least dp[i]. However, note that the code already uses two Fenwick trees and a dictionary. The dictionary `dmx` is used for the case when we have a segment that ends at i and we have seen the same prefix sum before? Actually, the state transition considers three cases:\n\n1. The segment ending at i is positive: then we look for a prefix that is less than the current prefix (so that the segment sum is positive) and we use the Fenwick tree for positive (pfen) to get the best value for indices with prefix in the sorted order that are less than the current.\n\n2. The segment ending at i is negative: then we look for a prefix that is greater than the current (so that the segment sum is negative) and we use the Fenwick tree for negative (nfen).\n\n3. The segment ending at i has a sum of zero: then the value for that segment is 0, but note that we can also break the segment arbitrarily. However, the code also uses a dictionary `dmx` that maps a prefix sum to the best dp value at an index with that prefix. This is for the case when we have a segment that starts at an index j and ends at i such that the sum of the segment is zero? Actually, the state transition for the zero case is: if we have a segment from j to i with sum zero, then we can set the segment to have value 0 and then the total value would be dp[j] (because the segment from 0 to j is already partitioned) plus 0. So we look for j such that pref[j] = pref[i] and then dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]).\n\nBut note: the state transition for the zero case is already taken care of by the dictionary. In the loop, we have:\n    dp[i] = max( ... , dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n\nSo after we compute dp[i], we must update the dictionary for the key pref[i] to be the maximum of the current value and dp[i]. Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut note: we want to update the dictionary so that for the same prefix, we have the best dp value. However, we are going to use it in the next indices. So we update it.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n    if pref[i] in dmx:\n        if dp[i] > dmx[pref[i]]:\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n    else:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the above can be written as:\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\nBut note: we are using -INF as the initial value. We can use the same -INF? However, the dictionary might not have the key. We can do:\n\n    if pref[i] not in dmx:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n    else:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx[pref[i]], dp[i])\n\nBut the problem says the constraints are large and we are updating for every i. We can do one line.\n\nHowever, note that the dictionary `dmx` was initialized with {0:0}. So for the first time we see a prefix, we set it to dp[i]. Otherwise, we update to the maximum.\n\nBut the code already has:\n    dmx[0] = 0\n\nSo for i=0, we set that. Then for i>=1, we update.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\nBut note: we are using -INF in the code, which is 1<<30. However, 1<<30 is about 1e9, but the dp values can be as large as n (which is 500000) and then multiplied by the length? Actually, the maximum value of a segment is the length (if positive) and we are adding up to 500000 segments. The worst-case positive value would be if every segment is positive and we break into single elements? Then each positive element would give 1, and there are n elements. So maximum dp[n] is n. But negative? We have negative segments that subtract. However, we are taking maximum. So the dp values can be negative? But the maximum we are storing in the dictionary should be the best.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is 500000. So we can update the dictionary.\n\nBut the problem: the dictionary key is the prefix sum, which can be as low as -10^9 * 500000, which is -5e14. But we are using a dictionary so it's a hash table. However, the total n per test case is up to 500000, and the total n over test cases is 500000. So we are safe.\n\nSo the missing line in program1.py is:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\nBut wait: the code already uses -INF = 1<<30. We can use -INF? But 1<<30 is 2^30 which is about 1e9, but our dp[i] might be negative and we want to compare. However, the problem says the array values can be negative and the dp might be negative. We should use a very small number. Alternatively, we can use -10**18 because the absolute value of the worst dp is at most 500000 (if all positive) and at worst -500000 (if all negative). So -10**18 is safe.\n\nBut note: the code already uses -INF for the Fenwick trees. We can use the same -INF? But the dictionary is independent. However, to be consistent, we can use -10**18? Or we can define a new constant? But the missing code is only one line.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    if pref[i] in dmx:\n        if dp[i] > dmx[pref[i]]:\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n    else:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. And the missing code is one line? Actually, the TODO is at the same indentation level. But note: the code has:\n\n        if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we must write two lines? Actually, we can write:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut wait: what if there is already a value? We want the maximum. The condition is: if dp[i] is greater than the current value, then we update. So we can simply do:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBecause the condition already checks that dp[i] is greater than the current value (if any). If the key is not present, then dmx.get returns -INF, and if dp[i] > -INF, then we set it. And if the key is present and dp[i] is greater, then we set it. So that is safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the condition is:\n\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n\nSo if dp[i] is greater, then we update. So we can write:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut what if we have multiple indices with the same prefix? We want the best dp value for that prefix. And we are updating the dictionary only when we get a better one. So that is correct.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem is about constructing a binary search tree that minimizes the total communication cost. The provided code uses dynamic programming for the optimal BST. The recurrence is:\n\n    f[l][r] = min_{k in [l, r)} { f[l][k] + f[k+1][r] + cost }\n\nThe cost for splitting at k is:\n\n    C = f[l][k] + S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k) + f[k+1][r] + S[r][n] - S[k+1][n] - rec(k+1, r)\n\nBut note: the function `rec` is defined as:\n\n    rec(i, x) = S[x][x] - S[x][i] - S[i][x] + S[i][i]\n\nBut what is S? The matrix S is built as:\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        row = list of n integers from input\n        for j in range(n):\n            S[i+1][j+1] = r[j] + S[i][j+1] + S[i+1][j] - S[i][j]\n\nSo S is the 2D prefix sum of the matrix c.\n\nThe function rec(i, x) is the sum of the submatrix from (i, i) to (x-1, x-1)? Actually, note the indices: the matrix c is 0-indexed, and we built S for indices from 0 to n (inclusive). The formula for the sum of the rectangle from (i, j) to (x-1, y-1) is:\n\n    S[x][y] - S[i][y] - S[x][j] + S[i][j]\n\nBut in rec(i, x) we have:\n\n    rec(i, x) = S[x][x] - S[x][i] - S[i][x] + S[i][i]\n\nThis is the sum of the submatrix from (i, i) to (x-1, x-1). But note: the matrix is symmetric.\n\nThe recurrence in the code for the cost C is:\n\n    C = f[l][k] + (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) \n        + f[k+1][r] + (S[r][n] - S[k+1][n] - rec(k+1, r))\n\nBut what does this represent? In the classical optimal BST, the cost of a node at level d is frequency * (d+1). But here, the cost is the sum over all pairs of the communication cost (which is the distance in the tree) multiplied by the number of messages. However, the problem uses a different formulation.\n\nActually, the recurrence is derived by considering the cost added when making k the root of the segment [l, r]. The cost added is the sum of the messages that cross the root? Actually, when we split at k, the root k will be the common ancestor for all pairs (i, j) where i is in [l, k] and j in [k+1, r]. The distance between i and j in the tree will be (distance from i to k) + (distance from j to k). But note the tree is built recursively. However, the classical formulation for optimal BST with weights on the edges? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the following: the total cost is the sum_{i<j} c[i][j] * d[i][j]. The distance d[i][j] is the sum of the edge weights? But the tree is unweighted? Actually, the problem does not say the edges have weights, so we assume unweighted. Then the distance is the number of edges.\n\nIn the classical optimal BST (with given frequencies for keys) we have a recurrence:\n\n    f(i, j) = min_{i<=r<=j} { f(i, r-1) + f(r+1, j) + w(i, j) }\n\nwhere w(i, j) is the sum of the frequencies of the nodes from i to j. But here, the cost is not on the nodes but on the pairs.\n\nThis problem is known as the \"Optimal Binary Search Tree\" for the case of a symmetric cost matrix? Actually, it is the \"minimum communication spanning tree\" on a line with the BST constraint? \n\nThe recurrence in the code is:\n\n    C = f[l][k] + (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) \n        + f[k+1][r] + (S[r][n] - S[k+1][n] - rec(k+1, r))\n\nBut note: the term (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) is the same as:\n\n    (S[k][n] - S[l][n]) - (S[k][k] - S[k][l] - S[l][k] + S[l][l])\n\nBut what does this represent? \n\nAlternatively, we can interpret the recurrence as:\n\n    total_cost = f[l][k] (for left subtree) + f[k+1][r] (for right subtree) \n                 + (cost of the root k for the entire set [l, r])\n\nBut the cost of the root k is the sum of the messages that go through the root? That is, the messages between a node in [l, k] and a node in [k+1, r]. The distance for these pairs will be increased by 2 (because they go from left to root and then to right, so two edges) for every pair? Actually, the entire path from i to j (if i and j are in different subtrees) will be 2 (the root is counted as a node, but the edges: from i to root is (depth_i - depth_root) but note the root is at depth 0? Actually, the tree is built from the root down. The distance between i and j is (depth_i - depth_root) + (depth_j - depth_root) + 2? Actually, the root is one node, and the edges: from i to the root is (number of edges) = depth_i, and from j to the root is depth_j, and then the entire path is depth_i + depth_j? But wait, the root is the common ancestor. The distance is (depth_i - depth_k) + (depth_j - depth_k) + 2? Actually, the root k is at depth 0, then the left subtree nodes are at depth at least 1, and the right subtree similarly. The distance between i (in left) and j (in right) is (1 + depth_i_in_left) + (1 + depth_j_in_right) = 2 + depth_i_in_left + depth_j_in_right. But note: the entire cost for the pair (i,j) is c[i][j] * (2 + ...). However, the recurrence in the code does not account for the entire tree? \n\nActually, the recurrence is derived by the following:\n\n    The total cost can be broken by the contribution of edges. Each edge is traversed by a message as many times as the number of pairs that go through that edge. But the problem is symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following known result: the total cost is the sum over all edges of the weight of the edge multiplied by the number of pairs that go through that edge. Since the tree is unweighted, the weight is 1. So the total cost is the sum over edges of the number of pairs that go through that edge.\n\nWhen we choose a root k, the edge from k to the left subtree will be traversed by all pairs that have one endpoint in the left subtree and the other in the entire set excluding the left subtree (which is the right subtree and the rest of the tree? But note the entire tree is built from the root). Actually, the entire set of pairs that go through the edge from k to the left child is the pairs that have one endpoint in the left subtree and the other in the entire rest of the tree (which includes the right subtree and the root and the rest of the tree above the root? But the root is k, and the rest of the tree above the root is not built yet? Actually, the recurrence is for the entire segment [l, r] and we are building a subtree for [l, r]. The rest of the tree is not considered because we are building a BST for the entire set? \n\nActually, the problem states: the tree must contain all members. So the entire set is [1, n]. We are building the tree for the entire set. The recurrence is for the segment [l, r] (0-indexed, from l to r-1? or inclusive?).\n\nIn the code, the dp state is f[l][r] for the segment [l, r) (l inclusive, r exclusive) because the loop for c in range(1, N) and l in range(0, N-c) and r = l+c. And the segment [l, r] is of length c. Then we split at k in [l, r) (from l to r-1). The left subtree is [l, k] and the right subtree is [k+1, r]. \n\nThe cost for the root k is the sum of the messages between the left subtree and the entire rest of the tree? But note: the entire rest of the tree is the right subtree and the rest of the tree that is not in [l, r]? Actually, the recurrence should only account for the pairs that are entirely within [l, r]? \n\nBut the recurrence in the code uses:\n\n    C = f[l][k] + (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) \n        + f[k+1][r] + (S[r][n] - S[k+1][n] - rec(k+1, r))\n\nWhat is S[k][n]? The matrix S is the 2D prefix sum of the entire matrix? Then S[k][n] is the sum of the entire k-th row? Actually, no: S is built as a 2D prefix sum from (0,0) to (i,j). So S[i][j] is the sum of the submatrix from (0,0) to (i-1, j-1)? Actually, the indices: we have for i in range(n): we set S[i+1][j+1] = ... So S is (n+1) x (n+1). Then S[k][n] is the sum of the entire k-th row? Actually, no: the entire matrix is n x n. \n\nBut note: the matrix c is given for n x n. The term S[k][n] is the sum of the first k rows and all n columns? Actually, the prefix sum S[i][j] = sum_{x=0}^{i-1} sum_{y=0}^{j-1} c[x][y]. Then:\n\n    S[k][n] = sum_{x=0}^{k-1} sum_{y=0}^{n-1} c[x][y]\n\nSimilarly, rec(l,k) = S[k][k] - S[k][l] - S[l][k] + S[l][l] = the sum of the submatrix from (l, l) to (k-1, k-1). \n\nSo the term (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) = \n    [sum_{x=l}^{k-1} sum_{y=0}^{n-1} c[x][y]] - [sum_{x=l}^{k-1} sum_{y=l}^{k-1} c[x][y]]\n\nBut note: the entire set of pairs that involve the left subtree [l, k] and the rest of the tree? The rest of the tree includes the right subtree [k+1, r] and also the nodes outside [l, r]? But the recurrence is for the segment [l, r] only? Then why are we subtracting rec(l,k) (which is the internal pairs within [l, k])? \n\nActually, the term (S[k][n] - S[l][n]) is the sum of the rows from l to k-1 and all columns? Then we subtract rec(l,k) which is the pairs within [l, k] (because the submatrix from (l,l) to (k-1,k-1) is the pairs (i,j) with i,j in [l, k]). So the remaining is the pairs that have the first coordinate in [l, k] and the second coordinate not in [l, k]? That is, the pairs that go from the left subtree to the rest of the entire set (which includes the right subtree and the nodes outside [l, r]). But the recurrence is for the segment [l, r] only? Then we should only consider the pairs within [l, r]. \n\nBut the term (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) includes pairs that go from [l, k] to the entire set (including indices outside [l, r]). That is not correct because the state f[l][r] is for the segment [l, r] and we are only responsible for the pairs within [l, r]. \n\nTherefore, the recurrence might be flawed? But note the problem: the total cost is over all pairs (i,j) with 1<=i<j<=n. So we must account for all pairs. However, the recurrence is breaking the problem into two independent subtrees? Then the cost for the root k is the cost of the pairs that have one element in the left subtree and the other in the right subtree? \n\nActually, the cost for the root k is the cost of the pairs that cross the root: that is, one in the left and one in the right. The distance for such a pair is 2 (because they go from left to root to right). But also, the root will be the common ancestor for these pairs. And then the entire path for the pair (i,j) will be broken into two parts: from i to the root and from the root to j. But note: the entire tree is built recursively, and the distance from i to j is the sum of the distances from i to the root and from the root to j. However, the root k is at depth 0, then the left subtree is built with root at depth 1, and the right subtree similarly. So the distance from i to j is 2 (the two edges: i to k and k to j) plus the distances within the subtrees? Actually, no: the distance from i to k is 1 (if i is the direct child) plus the depth of i in the left subtree? \n\nBut the recurrence in the code does not account for the entire depth? It only accounts for the immediate cost of the root? Then the recurrence should be:\n\n    f(l, r) = min_{k in [l, r)} { f(l, k) + f(k+1, r) + 2 * (w(l, k, k+1, r)) }\n\nwhere w(l, k, k+1, r) is the total messages between the left segment [l, k] and the right segment [k+1, r]. \n\nBut note: the term 2 * (sum_{i in [l,k], j in [k+1, r]} c[i][j])\n\nIn the code, the term (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) is not the sum of the messages from [l,k] to [k+1, r]? It is the sum of the messages from [l,k] to the entire set except [l,k]. But we only want the messages from [l,k] to [k+1, r]. \n\nSo the recurrence in the code is not correct? But the problem says: the total n is 200, so we can precompute the sum for any segment. \n\nLooking at the code, the function rec(l,k) is the sum of the submatrix (l to k-1, l to k-1). Then the term (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) is the sum of the messages from the segment [l, k] to the entire set except the segment [l, k]. But we want only the messages from [l,k] to [k+1, r]. \n\nTherefore, the recurrence should be:\n\n    cost = 2 * (sum_{i=l}^{k} sum_{j=k+1}^{r} c[i][j])\n\nBut the code does not have that. \n\nAlternatively, the recurrence in the code might be using a different idea: the entire cost for the segment [l, r] is the cost of the left subtree plus the cost of the right subtree plus the cost of the root. The cost of the root is the sum of the messages that go through the root, which is 2 * (sum_{i in [l,k], j in [k+1, r]} c[i][j]). But the code does not multiply by 2? \n\nActually, the recurrence in the code does not multiply by 2. Why? \n\nBut note: the classical optimal BST recurrence for the case of linear distance (like in the problem of minimizing the total distance for a binary search tree) is:\n\n    f(i, j) = f(i, k-1) + f(k+1, j) + w(i, j)\n\nwhere w(i, j) is the sum of the frequencies of the nodes in the subtree (i, j). This is because when we move the root down, the entire subtree is one level deeper, so we add the frequencies of the nodes in the subtree once per level. But here, the cost is on the pairs. \n\nActually, the cost for a pair (i,j) is the distance in the tree. The distance is the number of edges. When we build the tree, the root k will add 2 to the distance of every pair (i,j) with i in [l,k] and j in [k+1, r]. So the total cost added by the root is 2 * (sum_{i in [l,k], j in [k+1, r]} c[i][j]). \n\nBut the recurrence in the code does not have the factor 2. \n\nHowever, the recurrence in the code is:\n\n    C = f[l][k] + (S[k][n] - S[l][n] - rec(l,k)) \n        + f[k+1][r] + (S[r][n] - S[k+1][n] - rec(k+1, r))\n\nThis is missing the factor 2 and also includes extra terms that are not the cross terms. \n\nAlternatively, the recurrence might be:\n\n    f(l, r) = min_{k} { f(l, k) + f(k+1, r) + (w(l, k, k+1, r)) }\n\nwhere w(l, k, k+1, r) = 2 * (sum_{i in [l,k], j in [k+1, r]} c[i][j])\n\nBut the code does not have the factor 2. \n\nBut the sample: n=4, and the matrix is:\n\n  0 566 239 1\n  566 0 1 2\n  239 1 0 30\n  1 2 30 0\n\nThe minimal cost is 839. \n\nIn the sample, the tree is: root=3 (which is the node with number 3? but note: the matrix is 0-indexed for nodes 0,1,2,3). The tree: [0, -2, 3] and [-4] -> wait, the note says: [0, -2, 3] and [-4] -> but the nodes are 1,2,3,4? \n\nActually, the note says: \n    The minimal possible total cost is 566*1+239*1+30*1+1*2+1*2=839.\n\nThe pairs: \n    (1,2): 566 * 1\n    (1,3): 239 * 1\n    (1,4): 1 * 2\n    (2,3): 1 * 2   -> but wait, the matrix: \n        c[0][1]=566, c[0][2]=239, c[0][3]=1, c[1][2]=1, c[1][3]=2, c[2][3]=30.\n\nThe note says: 566*1 + 239*1 + 30*1 + 1*2 + 1*2 = 566+239+30+2+2 = 839.\n\nBut the tree: \n    The note says: the optimal partition is [0, -2, 3] and [-4] -> that doesn't match.\n\nActually, the tree description: \n    For the sample, the tree is: \n        root is node 3 (which is the number 3) -> but the matrix indices: node0=1, node1=2, node2=3, node3=4.\n        Then the tree: \n            root is 3 (node2) -> then left subtree: [0,1] (nodes 1 and 2) and right subtree: [3] (node4).\n        Then for the left subtree: we must have a root. The root must be between 0 and 1. Since the left subtree must have numbers less than 3, and the right subtree greater than 3. \n        The left subtree: the root must be either 1 or 2. If we choose 2 (node1) as the root, then the left child is 1 (node0). \n        So the tree:\n            root: 3 (node2)\n                left: 2 (node1)\n                    left: 1 (node0)\n                right: 4 (node3)\n\n        Then the distances:\n            (1,2): path: 1->2->3? but wait, the tree: \n                node0 (1) is at depth 2, node1 (2) is at depth 1, node2 (3) is at depth 0, node3 (4) is at depth 1.\n            (1,2): 1->2: path: 1->2->3->2? no, the tree is: \n                node0 (1) is a child of node1 (2), and node1 is a child of node2 (3). \n                So the path from 1 to 2: 1->2->3->2? Actually, the tree is directed? \n\n        Actually, the tree is undirected. The distance between 1 and 2: \n            from node0 to node1: 1 edge (from 1 to 2), then from node1 to node2: 1 edge, then from node2 to node1: not needed. \n            Actually, the path from 1 to 2: 1->2 (one edge) and then 2 is the parent of 1? \n\n        The tree: \n            node2 (3) is the root.\n            node1 (2) is the left child of node2.\n            node0 (1) is the left child of node1.\n            node3 (4) is the right child of node2.\n\n        Then the path from 1 to 2: 1->2: that's one edge? \n        But the matrix says c[0][1] (which is between node0 and node1) = 566. The distance is 2? Because 1->2->3->2? \n\n        Actually, the distance between node0 and node1: \n            node0 to node1: direct edge? then distance=1.\n        But the tree: node0 is connected to node1, and node1 to node2, and node2 to node3.\n        So the distance between node0 and node1 is 1.\n        between node0 and node2: 2.\n        between node0 and node3: 2 (node0->node1->node2->node3) -> 3 edges? \n\n        Let me draw:\n\n            root: node2 (3)\n                 /   \\\n            node1 (2)  node3 (4)\n            /\n        node0 (1)\n\n        Then:\n            distance(0,1) = 1\n            distance(0,2) = 2\n            distance(0,3) = 2? -> no, from 0 to 3: 0->1->2->3: that's 3 edges.\n\n        But the note says: \n            566 * 1: for (1,2): distance=1 -> matches.\n            239 * 1: for (1,3): but in the matrix, c[0][2]=239 (node0 and node2) -> distance=2, so cost=239*2? \n        This does not match.\n\n        The note says: 239 * 1 -> so the distance for (1,3) is 1? \n\n        How can that be? \n\n        The tree in the note: \n            [0, -2, 3] and [-4] -> this might be a partition of the array, not the tree. \n\n        The problem says: output the parent array. \n\n        The sample output: \n            The minimal cost is 839.\n\n        And the tree description: \n            For each team member from 1 to n output the number of the member in its parent node, or 0 for the leader.\n\n        The sample input has 4 nodes. \n\n        The sample output might be: \n            parent[1] = 2, parent[2] = 3, parent[3] = 0, parent[4] = 3.\n\n        Then the tree is:\n            node3 (3) is the root (parent=0).\n            node2 (2) has parent 3.\n            node1 (1) has parent 2.\n            node4 (4) has parent 3.\n\n        Then the distances:\n            (1,2): 1->2->3->2? -> no, the path from 1 to 2: 1->2 and then 2->3? but then back? \n            Actually, the tree is undirected.

Why?\n\n        The matrix has:\n            c[0][1]=566, c[0][2]=239, c[0][3]=1, \n            c[1][2]=1, c[1][3]=2, \n            c[2][3]=30.\n\n        So the pairs are:\n            (0,1): 566\n            (0,2): 239\n            (0,3): 1\n            (1,2): 1\n            (1,3): 2\n            (2,3): 30\n\n        The note lists:\n            566 (0,1) -> d=1\n            239 (0,2) -> d=1  -> but in the tree, (0,2) is (1,3) in the node numbering? \n        This is very confusing.\n\n        Let me re-index the matrix: the team member 1 corresponds to index0, member2 to index1, member3 to index2, member4 to index3.\n\n        The tree: \n            member3 (index2) is the root.\n            member1 (index0) is the left child of the root.\n            member2 (index1) is the left child of member1.\n            member4 (index3) is the right child of the root.\n\n        Then the distances:\n            (0,1): member1 and member2: path: index0->index1: in the tree, node0 to node1: direct edge? -> distance=1.\n            (0,2): member1 and member3: node0 to node2: node0->node2: direct edge? -> no, node0 is child of node2, so one edge.\n            (0,3): member1 and member4: node0->node2->node3: two edges.\n            (1,2): member2 and member3: node1->node0->node2: two edges.\n            (1,3): member2 and member4: node1->node0->node2->node3: three edges.\n            (2,3): member3 and member4: node2->node3: one edge.\n\n        Then the cost:\n            (0,1): 566 * 1 = 566\n            (0,2): 239 * 1 = 239\n            (0,3): 1 * 2 = 2\n            (1,2): 1 * 2 = 2\n            (1,3): 2 * 3 = 6\n            (2,3): 30 * 1 = 30\n            total = 566+239+2+2+6+30 = 845.\n\n        This is not 839.\n\n        The tree in the sample solution: \n            [0, -2, 3] and [-4] -> this might be a partition for a different problem. \n\n        Given the complexity, and since the code is provided and we only need to fill in the TODO, we trust the recurrence in the code. \n\n        The TODO in program2.py is in the loop for k in range(l, r):\n\n            if C < f[l][r]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We should update f[l][r] and also record the root for the segment [l, r] at Rt[l][r] = k.\n\n        So the missing code is:\n\n            f[l][r] = C\n            Rt[l][r] = k\n\n        But note: the code has:\n\n            if C < f[l][r]:\n                f[l][r] = C\n                Rt[l][r] = k\n\n        So the missing code is two lines:\n\n            f[l][r] = C\n            Rt[l][r] = k\n\n        But the code already has:\n\n            if C<f[l][r]: \n\n        then we should do the assignment.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n            f[l][r] = C\n            Rt[l][r] = k\n\n        But note: the code uses `Rt` to store the root for the segment [l, r]. \n\n        So we update f[l][r] to the new minimum cost C, and record that the root for this segment is k.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            f[l][r] = C\n            Rt[l][r] = k\n\nBut note: the code uses `Rt` as a 2D array. We are in the loop for k. We want to record the k that gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n    program1: the missing code is: \n            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n    program2: the missing code is:\n            f[l][r] = C\n            Rt[l][r] = k\n\nBut note: the code in program2.py has:\n\n    if C<f[l][r]: \n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We must do two assignments.\n\n    We write:\n\n        f[l][r] = C\n        Rt[l][r] = k\n\n    in the next two lines.\n\nBut the code is in the same block.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is two lines.\n\nNow, output in JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n    \"program2\": \"            f[l][r] = C\\n            Rt[l][r] = k\"\n}\n\nBut note: the code in program1.py has 8 spaces for the inner block, and then the TODO is at 12 spaces. So the missing code for program1.py is at 12 spaces. We should output the same indentation.\n\nIn program2.py, the TODO is in a loop that is at 4 spaces, and the condition is at 6 spaces, and the TODO is at 6 spaces. Then the missing code should be at 8 spaces.\n\nBut the code in program2.py:\n\n    for k in G(l,r):\n        C = ... \n        if C<f[l][r]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    The TODO is at 8 spaces? Actually, the code uses 2 spaces per level. \n\n    The code:\n\n        for k in G(l,r):\n            C = ... \n            if C<f[l][r]:   # this line is at 6 spaces (because for: 4, if: 6)\n                # TODO: Your code here   -> at 8 spaces\n\n    So the missing code should be at 8 spaces.\n\n    We write:\n\n            f[l][r] = C\n            Rt[l][r] = k\n\n    Each line should be indented by 8 spaces.\n\n    But the code in the problem for program2.py uses 2 spaces per indent? \n\n    The code: \n        R,G=lambda:map(int,input().split()),range;n,=R();Fa=[0]*n;N=n+1\n        A=lambda:[[0]*N for _ in G(N)];S,Rt,f=A(),A(),A()\n        ...\n\n        for c in G(1,N):\n          for l in G(N-c):\n            r=l+c;f[l][l+c]=float('inf')\n            for k in G(l,r):\n              C= ... \n              if C<f[l][r]:   # this is at 6 spaces (because for l: 4, for k: 6, if: 8? Let me count)\n\n    Actually, the code:\n\n        for c in G(1,N):\n          for l in G(N-c):\n            r=l+c;f[l][l+c]=float('inf')\n            for k in G(l,r):\n                C = ... \n                if C<f[l][r]:   # TODO\n\n    The code uses 2 spaces for the first indent, then 4, then 6, then 8 for the if.\n\n    So the TODO is at 8 spaces, and the missing code should be at 10 spaces.\n\n    But the code in the problem might be:\n\n        for k in G(l,r):\n          C = ... \n          if C<f[l][r]:   # TODO\n\n    This is not clear. \n\n    However, the problem says: output the missing code. We output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO, which is 8 spaces from the leftmost? \n\n    But the TODO is in a block that is indented. We output:\n\n        \"            f[l][r] = C\\n            Rt[l][r] = k\"\n\n    for program2.py, with 12 spaces? \n\n    But the TODO in program2.py is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer) or 10? \n\n    To be safe, we output the same indentation level as the TODO. Since the TODO is at the same level as the condition, and the condition is at 6 spaces (from the for loops), then the missing code should be at 8 spaces.\n\n    Alternatively, we count the spaces in the provided code for program2.py:\n\n        for c in G(1,N):\n          for l in G(N-c):\n            r=l+c;f[l][l+c]=float('inf')\n            for k in G(l,r):\n              C= ... \n              if C<f[l][r]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n    The code uses 2 spaces for the first for, 4 for the second, 6 for the third, and 8 for the if. \n\n    So the missing code should be at 10 spaces? \n\n    But the TODO is at the same level as the condition, which is 8 spaces. \n\n    We output:\n\n        for program2.py: two lines, each starting with 10 spaces? \n\n    However, the problem does not require the exact spaces, but the same indentation level as the surrounding code. \n\n    Since the TODO is at the same level as the condition, and the condition is at 8 spaces, then the missing code should be at 8 spaces? \n\n    But the condition is at 8 spaces, and the TODO is in the next line at 8 spaces? \n\n    Actually, the condition is:\n\n        if C<f[l][r]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n    So the TODO is in the same line. The next line should be the body of the if, which should be indented one more level. \n\n    In the code, the next line is not provided. We are to fill in the body. \n\n    The body should be indented by 2 more spaces? \n\n    The code style: the code uses 2 spaces per indent. \n\n    So the body of the if should be at 10 spaces. \n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          f[l][r] = C\n          Rt[l][r] = k\n\n    with 10 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n    But the code in the problem might be using a different number of spaces. \n\n    Alternatively, the code in the problem for program2.py is:\n\n        for k in G(l,r):\n          C = ... \n          if C<f[l][r]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n    This is 2 spaces for the for, 4 for the assignment and if. Then the TODO is at 4 spaces? \n\n    Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"output only the missing code\", and the TODO is in the if block, we output the two lines with one level of indentation more than the if. \n\n    But the if is at 6 spaces (from the outer for loops) and the body should be at 8 spaces. \n\n    We'll output for program2.py:\n\n        \"          f[l][r] = C\\n          Rt[l][r] = k\"\n\n    with 10 spaces? \n\n    Let me count the spaces in the provided code for program2.py:\n\n        for c in G(1,N):\n          for l in G(N-c):\n            r=l+c;f[l][l+c]=float('inf')\n            for k in G(l,r):\n              C = ... \n              if C<f[l][r]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n    The for c: 0 spaces\n    for l: 2 spaces\n    for k: 4 spaces\n    if: 6 spaces\n\n    So the body of the if should be at 8 spaces. \n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is two lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\n\n    We write:\n\n        \"        f[l][r] = C\\n        Rt[l][r] = k\"\n\n    But wait, 8 spaces? \n\n    The if is at 6 spaces, then the body should be at 8 spaces. \n\n    So each line of the body should have 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\n    But the code in the problem might be using 2 spaces per indent, and the if is in a triple nested loop: \n\n        for c: 0\n          for l: 2\n            for k: 4\n              if: 6\n\n        then body: 8.\n\n    So we output 8 spaces.\n\n    Alternatively, to be safe, we output the same number of spaces as the surrounding code. The line above the TODO is:\n\n        if C<f[l][r]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n    This line is at 6 spaces. The body should be at 8 spaces.\n\n    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        \"        f[l][r] = C\"\n        \"        Rt[l][r] = k\"\n\n    with 8 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n    But note: the code in the problem might be using 2 spaces per indent, and the for k is at 4 spaces, then the if is at 6 spaces, then the body at 8 spaces.\n\n    So we output:\n\n        program2: \"        f[l][r] = C\\n        Rt[l][r] = k\"\n\n    But the TODO is in the same line as the if. The body of the if is the next lines. \n\n    So the first line of the body is after the if.\n\n    We output two lines, each with 8 spaces.\n\n    However, the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n    We output for program1.py: one line (with 12 spaces) and for program2.py: two lines (each with 8 spaces).\n\n    But the TODO in program1.py is at 12 spaces? \n\n    The code in program1.py:\n\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n            pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n            nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n            if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    The for loop is at 4 spaces, then the body is at 8 spaces. The if is at 8 spaces, and the TODO is at 12 spaces.\n\n    So the missing code for program1.py should be at 12 spaces.\n\n    We output: \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n    (which is 12 spaces: 3 indents of 4 spaces? but the code uses 4 spaces per indent? The for is 4, then if is 8, then body 12.)\n\n    But the code in program1.py: the for loop is at 4 spaces, then the assignment to dp[i] is at 8, then the if is at 8, and the body of the if should be at 12.\n\n    So we output 12 spaces.\n\n    Therefore, the final answer:\n\n    {\n        \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n        \"program2\": \"        f[l][r] = C\\n        Rt[l][r] = k\"\n    }\n\n    But wait, the program2.py code uses 2 spaces per indent, so 8 spaces might be 4 indents? \n\n    We count for program2.py: \n\n        for c in G(1,N):   -> 0\n          for l in G(N-c):   -> 2\n            r=l+c; ...       -> 4\n            for k in G(l,r):   -> 4\n              C = ...          -> 6\n              if C<f[l][r]:    -> 6\n                 ...            -> 8\n\n    So the body of the if should be at 8 spaces.\n\n    We output 8 spaces for each line.\n\n    But the TODO is in the same line as the if. The body is the next lines. \n\n    So we output two lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\n\n    However, the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. \n\n    We output the JSON string with the two strings.\n\n    Note: the newline in program2 is represented as \\n.\n\n    Let me write the JSON:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"            dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n            \"program2\": \"        f[l][r] = C\\n        Rt[l][r] = k\"\n        }\n\n    But the program2 part: the two lines are \"        f[l][r] = C\" and \"        Rt[l][r] = k\", with 8 spaces at the beginning of each.\n\n    This should be correct.\n\n    However, note: in program2.py, the variable is `Rt` (capital R) or `rt`? The code uses `Rt`.\n\n    And in the assignment, we use `Rt[l][r] = k`.\n\n    So it is correct.\n\n    We output the JSON."
