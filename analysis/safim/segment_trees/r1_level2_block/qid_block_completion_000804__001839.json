Next: a<=b? 1<=1 -> else: add l1[1]=2 -> a=3, l=2. Then condition: a=3, b=1 -> a>b -> then we do: b += l1[1]=2 -> b=3, h=0 -> now l=2, h=0 -> l>h -> break?

Then we take it for Alice: then l becomes 2 and h remains 1. Then we break the while loop condition? Actually, the condition is l<=h -> 2<=1 -> false, so we break. But then we don't do the next step? Wait, the structure:\n\n    while(l<=h):\n        if(a>b):\n            ... # update b and h\n        else:\n            ... # update a and l\n\n        if(a==b):\n            ans = l + n - h - 1 So after the else branch (where we took the middle candy for Alice) we set l=2. Then we check a==b? (a=3, b=1) -> false. Then the while condition: l=2, h=1 -> 2<=1 -> false -> break. So we don't do the a>b branch again? Then we never take the middle candy for Bob? But then how did we get a==b again? We didn't. So the simulation I did earlier was incorrect: we never updated Bob again after the middle candy was taken by Alice. So the problem in the simulation above was that after the first two steps (l=1, h=1) we have a==b (1==1) and set ans=2. Then we take the middle candy for Alice (so a becomes 3, l becomes 2) and then we break. Then we output ans=2. But then why did we set ans=2? Because we set it at the first time we had a==b. Then we set it again? Actually, we set it at the first time and then we don't set it again because the next time a!=b. So we output 2. But what about the example: [1,2,1] -> the answer is 2. Now, the second example: n=4, weights = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> the example says the answer is 7.",

Then when a==b, we set ans = l + (n - h - 1). - Alice has eaten [0, l-1] -> l candies. - Bob has eaten [h+1, n-1] -> (n-1 - h) candies. So total = l + (n-1 - h) = l + n - h - 1.

Then h would be 3? Because we start at n-1=7 and then we take 7,6,5,4 -> then h becomes 3. So Bob has eaten from index4 to index7 -> that's 4 candies. Then the total = 3 (Alice) + 4 (Bob) = 7. But in the formula: l=3, h=3? Then ans = 3 + 8 - 3 - 1 = 3+4=7. Correct. So the formula is correct. But how do we get a=30 and b=30? We must simulate:\n\nWe start: l=0, h=7, a=0, b=0. Step1: a<=b -> take l1[0]=7 -> a=7, l=1. Step2: a=7, b=0 -> a>b -> take l1[7]=1 -> b=1, h=6. Step3: a=7, b=1 -> a>b -> take l1[6]=11 -> b=12, h=5. Step4: a=7, b=12 -> a<=b -> take l1[1]=3 -> a=10, l=2. Step5: a=10, b=12 -> a<=b -> take l1[2]=20 -> a=30, l=3.\nStep6: a=30, b=12 -> a>b -> take l1[5]=8 -> b=20, h=4.\nStep7: a=30, b=20 -> a>b -> take l1[4]=10 -> b=30, h=3. Now we have a==b=30. Then we set ans = l + n - h - 1 = 3 + 8 - 3 - 1 = 7. Then the while condition: l=3, h=3 -> l<=h -> true.\nStep8: a<=b? 30<=30 -> else: take l1[3]=5 -> a=35, l=4. Then we break because l=4>h=3. So we set ans=7 at step7, and then we do one more step but then a!=b and we break. Then we output 7. So the algorithm is: we update the pointers and whenever a==b we record the total candies at that moment.",

So the total count is increasing. Therefore, the last time we have a==b will have the largest count. So we can just set ans to the current total at every a==b and then the last one will be the maximum? But consider: \nWe have a==b at step k: total = k. Then we add more candies: we add one to Alice -> total becomes k+1 (but a!=b). Then we add one to Bob -> total becomes k+2, and then a==b again? Then we set ans to k+2. So the last a==b has a larger count. Therefore, we can just set ans to the current total every time we have a==b and then the last one will be the maximum. But what if we have a==b at step k, then we add more and then we never have a==b again? Then we have recorded k, but there might be a later a==b? Actually, we are traversing until l<=h. So we will have a chance to set ans to the last a==b. But note: the example [1,2,1]: we set ans=2 at the first a==b (when we had 2 candies) and then we never set it again. But then we break. So we output 2. But what if we have a sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1] (n=6). Step1: a=1, l=1 -> a==b? no.\nStep2: b=1, h=5 -> a==b: 1==1 -> ans = 1 + (6-5-1)=1+0=1?",

That's wrong. Why? The formula: \n- Alice has eaten candies from index0 to index l-1 -> that's l candies. - Bob has eaten candies from index h+1 to index n-1 -> that's (n-1 - h) candies. In the example: \nl=1 -> Alice has eaten [0] -> 1 candy. h=5 -> Bob has eaten [5] -> 1 candy? But then the next available for Bob is at index4? So the candies Bob has eaten are from index5 to index5 -> that's 1 candy. Then the total = 1+1=2. But the formula: l + n - h - 1 = 1 + 6 - 5 - 1 = 1. We see: the total candies = l (for Alice) + (n-1 - h) (for Bob) = 1 + (6-1-5) = 1+0=1?",

Then he takes one candy -> then h becomes 4. Then the next time he would take at index4. But in the example, we only took one candy for Bob. So the candies Bob has eaten are from index5 to index5 -> that's 1 candy. How do we represent that? We have: Initially: h = 5 -> candy at 5 is available. After taking: h becomes 4 -> then the candies Bob has taken are the ones from the original h=5 down to h+1? Actually, we have taken the candy at h=5 and then set h=4. Then the candies Bob has taken are the indices from h+1 (which is 5) to n-1 (which is 5). So that's one candy. But the count: (n-1 - h) = (5 - 4) = 1? But wait: h is now 4. So the count = (n-1 - h) = 5 - 4 = 1? That is correct. But in the formula: we have l + (n-1 - h) = 1 + (5-4) = 1+1=2. But in the code: we have h=4 at the moment we set ans. So the formula: l + n - h - 1 = 1 + 6 - 4 - 1 = 2. But in the simulation above, after step2 we set h=5? Actually, we started at h=5, then we did: b = b + l1[5] -> then h = h-1 -> h becomes 4. So at the moment we check a==b, we have l=1 and h=4. Then the formula: l + n - h - 1 = 1 + 6 - 4 - 1 = 2. So the formula is correct. Therefore, the missing code in the else branch is:\n\n            a += l1[l]\n            l += 1\n\nBut note: we must be cautious of the index.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code in the while loop. The current code has a TODO in the else branch.\n\nThe problem: \nAlice eats from the left, Bob from the right. They want the total weight eaten by Alice (a) to equal that eaten by Bob (b). We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten (which is the count from the left up to Alice's last candy plus the count from the right up to Bob's last candy).\n\nThe current code uses two pointers (l from left, h from right) and two sums (a for Alice, b for Bob). The idea is:\n- If a > b, then we add the next candy from the right to Bob (to try to make b catch up).\n- Otherwise (a <= b), we add the next candy from the left to Alice.\n\nBut note: the condition checks if a==b and then sets ans = l + (n - h - 1). This is because:\n- l is the next index for Alice (so the number of candies Alice has eaten is l, because we started at 0 and then we have done l++ in the else branch? Actually, let's see the current code structure.\n\nHowever, the current code does not update l in the else branch. We must complete the else branch.\n\nThe current code for the while loop:\n\n    while(l<=h):\n        if(a>b):\n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        if(a==b):\n            ans=l+n-h-1\n\nWe note that when a<=b, we should take a candy from the left for Alice. So we should do:\n            a = a + l1[l]\n            l = l + 1\n\nBut note: the condition (a==b) is checked after every step. And we update ans only when a==b.\n\nHowever, the problem says: we want the maximum total candies. So we record every time we have a==b, and then we take the maximum such total? Actually, the code sets ans to the current total when a==b. But note that we are moving the pointers and the total candies eaten at that point is l (from the left) and (n-1 - h) from the right? Actually, the number of candies Bob has eaten is (n-1 - h) because h started at n-1 and then we decrement h. So the total is l + (n-1 - h). But note: the current state: \n- Alice has eaten candies [0, l-1] -> l candies.\n- Bob has eaten candies [h+1, n-1] -> (n-1 - h) candies.\n\nBut the code sets: ans = l + n - h - 1 -> which is l + (n - h - 1). This is correct.\n\nBut note: the while loop condition is l<=h. We are updating either h (when a>b) or l (when a<=b). We must update l in the else branch.\n\nSo the missing code in the else branch is:\n            a += l1[l]\n            l += 1\n\nBut wait: what if we have a==b and then we update? We are checking after the update. So that's okay.\n\nHowever, note that the condition (a==b) might be true after updating either branch. So we are good.\n\nBut there is a catch: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so this two-pointer approach is efficient.\n\nBut note: the example test cases. Let's simulate the first test case:\n\nExample 1: n=3, weights = [1, 2, 1]\n\nInitially: l=0, h=2, a=0, b=0, ans=0.\nFirst: a<=b (0<=0) -> else: add l1[0]=1 -> a=1, l=1.\nNow: a=1, b=0 -> a>b -> then we do: b += l1[2]=1, h=1 -> now a=1, b=1 -> then we set ans = l + n - h - 1 = 1 + 3 - 1 - 1 = 2. Then the loop condition: l=1, h=1 -> l<=h -> true.\nNext: a<=b? 1<=1 -> else: add l1[1]=2 -> a=3, l=2.\nThen condition: a=3, b=1 -> a>b -> then we do: b += l1[1]=2 -> b=3, h=0 -> now l=2, h=0 -> l>h -> break? Actually, after updating h to 0, the condition l<=h becomes 2<=0 -> false, so we break. But we set ans=2 at the first time we had a==b.\n\nBut note: we might have multiple times when a==b. The problem asks for the maximum total candies. However, we are updating ans every time we have a==b. And we are moving the pointers until they cross. The last time we had a==b is when we had 2 candies. But what if we can get a==b again? Actually, after we set a=3 and b=1, then we update b to 3 and then we have a==b again? Then we would set ans again? But note: when we update b to 3, we then check: a==b? yes. Then we set ans = l + n - h - 1 = 2 + 3 - 0 - 1 = 4? But that would be 4 candies? But the example says the answer is 2.\n\nWait, let me check: after the second update of the else branch (l=2) and then the if(a>b) branch: we update b to 3 and h becomes 0. Then we check a==b: 3==3 -> true. Then we set ans = 2 + 3 - 0 - 1 = 4. But the example says the answer is 2.\n\nThis indicates that we are not supposed to count the same candy twice? Actually, when l=2, Alice has eaten [0,1] -> two candies. Bob has eaten [2] and then we add [1]? But wait: the candy at index1 was already considered for Alice? Then we are giving it to Bob? That's not allowed.\n\nThe problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\".\n\nSo the two pointers must not cross. The condition in the problem: they eat from the left and right without overlapping.\n\nTherefore, the pointers l and h must be such that the candies Alice eats are [0, l-1] and Bob eats [h+1, n-1]. The candies in between [l, h] are not eaten. So when we update, we are only adding a candy that hasn't been eaten.\n\nBut in the simulation above, when we set l=2, that means Alice has eaten indices0 and index1. Then we update Bob: we take h=1 -> but index1 is already eaten by Alice? That's a problem.\n\nActually, the code uses the same array and the pointers are moving. We start with the entire array [0, n-1]. Then:\n- When we take from the left (l), we are taking the candy at index l and then l increases (so the next available left candy is l+1).\n- When we take from the right (h), we are taking the candy at index h and then h decreases.\n\nBut note: the candy at index l is the next available on the left, and the candy at index h is the next available on the right. The two sets are disjoint until the pointers cross.\n\nIn the simulation: \nStep1: l=0, h=2 -> Alice takes index0 -> l becomes 1. Then Bob takes index2 -> h becomes 1. Then we have a==b: 1==1 -> ans= 1 (from Alice) + 1 (from Bob) = 2. Then the next step: l=1, h=1 -> we are at the same candy. Then we do: since a<=b (1<=1) -> we take the candy at index1 for Alice: a becomes 1+2=3, l becomes 2. Then we check: a==b? 3==1 -> no. Then we do: a>b -> we take the candy at index1 for Bob? But wait, h is 1, so we take l1[1]=2 -> b becomes 1+2=3, h becomes 0. Then we check: a==b -> 3==3 -> then we set ans = 2 (from Alice: indices0,1) + (n-1 - h) = (n-1 - h) = 3-1-0? Actually, Bob has eaten indices2 and index1? But index1 was already taken by Alice? \n\nThis is the problem: we are allowing the same candy to be taken by both? \n\nThe code must ensure that we do not use the same candy twice. The condition in the while loop: l<=h. When l==h, that candy is still available. But then we assign it to either Alice or Bob. Then the next step: if we assign it to Alice, then l becomes l+1 and h is still h (but then l>h). Then we break. Similarly for Bob.\n\nBut in the above, we assigned the middle candy to Alice (so l becomes 2) and then we try to assign the same candy (now at index1, but h is 1) to Bob? That's because we updated l to 2, but h is still 1. Then we do: a>b -> we take candy at h=1 (which is the same candy that Alice just took) -> that's wrong.\n\nSo we must not allow the same candy to be taken twice. The code must be designed so that the candy at the current l and h are the next available. But when we take the candy at l, we move l to l+1, and then the next available left candy is at l (which is the next one). Similarly for h.\n\nBut when we take the candy at l, we move l to l+1, and then the next available left candy is at l, and the next available right candy is still at h (which hasn't been taken). Then if we then take from the right, we take the candy at h and then move h to h-1.\n\nBut in the simulation, after the first two steps (l=1, h=1) we have one candy left (at index1). Then we take it for Alice: then l becomes 2 and h remains 1. Then we break the while loop condition? Actually, the condition is l<=h -> 2<=1 -> false, so we break. But then we don't do the next step? \n\nWait, the structure:\n\n    while(l<=h):\n        if(a>b):\n            ... # update b and h\n        else:\n            ... # update a and l\n\n        if(a==b):\n            ans = l + n - h - 1\n\nSo after the else branch (where we took the middle candy for Alice) we set l=2. Then we check a==b? (a=3, b=1) -> false. Then the while condition: l=2, h=1 -> 2<=1 -> false -> break.\n\nSo we don't do the a>b branch again? Then we never take the middle candy for Bob? \n\nBut then how did we get a==b again? We didn't. So the simulation I did earlier was incorrect: we never updated Bob again after the middle candy was taken by Alice.\n\nSo the problem in the simulation above was that after the first two steps (l=1, h=1) we have a==b (1==1) and set ans=2. Then we take the middle candy for Alice (so a becomes 3, l becomes 2) and then we break. Then we output ans=2.\n\nBut then why did we set ans=2? Because we set it at the first time we had a==b. Then we set it again? Actually, we set it at the first time and then we don't set it again because the next time a!=b. So we output 2.\n\nBut what about the example: [1,2,1] -> the answer is 2.\n\nNow, the second example: n=4, weights = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> the example says the answer is 7.\n\nHow does our algorithm work for that?\n\nBut note: the example says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (total 30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (total 30). So total candies: 3+4=7.\n\nWe must have at some point a==b=30 and then we set ans = l + (n-h-1) = 3 + (8 - 4 - 1) = 3 + (3) = 6? That doesn't match.\n\nWait: n=8. Then when a==b, we set ans = l + (n - h - 1). \n- Alice has eaten [0, l-1] -> l candies.\n- Bob has eaten [h+1, n-1] -> (n-1 - h) candies.\n\nSo total = l + (n-1 - h) = l + n - h - 1.\n\nIn the example: l=3 (because Alice has eaten 3 candies: indices0,1,2) -> l=3.\nBob has eaten 4 candies: indices4,5,6,7 -> so the next available for Bob is at index3? But we didn't take index3? Actually, the example says Bob ate from the right: [10,8,11,1] which are the last four. So the next available for Bob would be at index3? Then h would be 3? Because we start at n-1=7 and then we take 7,6,5,4 -> then h becomes 3. So Bob has eaten from index4 to index7 -> that's 4 candies. Then the total = 3 (Alice) + 4 (Bob) = 7.\n\nBut in the formula: l=3, h=3? Then ans = 3 + 8 - 3 - 1 = 3+4=7. Correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nBut how do we get a=30 and b=30? We must simulate:\n\nWe start: l=0, h=7, a=0, b=0.\n\nStep1: a<=b -> take l1[0]=7 -> a=7, l=1.\nStep2: a=7, b=0 -> a>b -> take l1[7]=1 -> b=1, h=6.\nStep3: a=7, b=1 -> a>b -> take l1[6]=11 -> b=12, h=5.\nStep4: a=7, b=12 -> a<=b -> take l1[1]=3 -> a=10, l=2.\nStep5: a=10, b=12 -> a<=b -> take l1[2]=20 -> a=30, l=3.\nStep6: a=30, b=12 -> a>b -> take l1[5]=8 -> b=20, h=4.\nStep7: a=30, b=20 -> a>b -> take l1[4]=10 -> b=30, h=3.\n\nNow we have a==b=30. Then we set ans = l + n - h - 1 = 3 + 8 - 3 - 1 = 7.\n\nThen the while condition: l=3, h=3 -> l<=h -> true.\nStep8: a<=b? 30<=30 -> else: take l1[3]=5 -> a=35, l=4.\nThen we break because l=4>h=3.\n\nSo we set ans=7 at step7, and then we do one more step but then a!=b and we break. Then we output 7.\n\nSo the algorithm is: we update the pointers and whenever a==b we record the total candies at that moment. And we want the maximum total candies? But note: we are updating ans every time we have a==b. And we are traversing the entire array. The last time we have a==b might not be the maximum? Actually, the total candies is increasing? But when we add more candies, the sums become larger and we might break the equality? \n\nBut note: we are moving the pointers and the total candies we have recorded is the current l and the current h. The total candies at a==b is l + (n-1-h). And we are moving the pointers from the ends inward. The total candies we have recorded is the number of candies eaten so far. And we are updating ans every time we have a==b. But we are not taking the maximum over the entire run? We are just setting ans to the last time we had a==b? \n\nBut the problem: we want the maximum total candies. So we should record the maximum total candies we have seen so far when a==b. The current code sets ans to the current total whenever a==b. But if we have multiple a==b, we want the one with the largest total candies? \n\nBut note: as we move the pointers, the total candies (l + n-1-h) is increasing? Actually, no: we are adding candies one by one. The total candies is the sum of the left part and the right part. But the count of candies is increasing? Actually, the count is: \n- Initially: 0\n- Then we add one candy: either left or right -> count=1\n- Then we add another -> count=2, etc.\n\nBut when we have a==b at an early stage (say count=2) and then later we have a==b at count=7, we want 7. The current code sets ans to 2 and then later to 7. So we output 7? \n\nBut note: the code sets ans to 7 at the last time we have a==b. But what if we have a==b at count=2 and then we never have a==b again? Then we output 2? But the problem says: we want the maximum number of candies they can eat in total. So we should record the maximum total candies over all a==b events.\n\nThe current code: \n    if(a==b):\n        ans = l + n - h - 1\n\nThis overwrites ans every time. So we only remember the last time we had a==b. But we want the maximum. So we should do:\n\n    if a==b:\n        current_total = l + n - h - 1\n        if current_total > ans:\n            ans = current_total\n\nBut the problem: the initial ans=0. And if we never have a==b, then we output 0. That matches the third example.\n\nBut the current code sets ans=0 initially. Then we update only when a==b. But we are not taking the maximum over the entire run? We are just setting ans to the current total. But if we have multiple a==b, we want the largest total. So we should do:\n\n    if a==b:\n        current_total = l + n - h - 1\n        ans = max(ans, current_total)\n\nBut the current code does not do that. It sets ans to the current total. So if we have an a==b with total=2 and then later an a==b with total=7, we set ans=7. But if we have an a==b with total=7 and then later an a==b with total=2 (which is not possible because we are moving the pointers and the total candies is increasing? Actually, the total candies (the count) is increasing: we are always adding one candy at a time. The count of candies eaten is l + (n-1-h). And l is increasing and h is decreasing, so the count is increasing? Actually, no: we are adding one candy at a time, so the count is increasing by one each step. Therefore, the last time we have a==b will have the largest count? \n\nBut wait: we are not necessarily having a==b at every step. And the count of candies eaten is the number of left candies plus the number of right candies. And we are adding one candy at a time. So the total count is increasing. Therefore, the last time we have a==b will have the largest count. So we can just set ans to the current total at every a==b and then the last one will be the maximum? \n\nBut consider: \nWe have a==b at step k: total = k.\nThen we add more candies: we add one to Alice -> total becomes k+1 (but a!=b).\nThen we add one to Bob -> total becomes k+2, and then a==b again? Then we set ans to k+2. \n\nSo the last a==b has a larger count. Therefore, we can just set ans to the current total every time we have a==b and then the last one will be the maximum. \n\nBut what if we have a==b at step k, then we add more and then we never have a==b again? Then we have recorded k, but there might be a later a==b? Actually, we are traversing until l<=h. So we will have a chance to set ans to the last a==b.\n\nBut note: the example [1,2,1]: we set ans=2 at the first a==b (when we had 2 candies) and then we never set it again. But then we break. So we output 2.\n\nBut what if we have a sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1] (n=6). \nStep1: a=1, l=1 -> a==b? no.\nStep2: b=1, h=5 -> a==b: 1==1 -> ans = 1 + (6-5-1)=1+0=1? That's not right: we have eaten 2 candies. \nActually: l=1 (so Alice has eaten 1 candy: index0) and h=5 (so Bob has eaten 1 candy: index5). Then the total candies = 1 (Alice) + 1 (Bob) = 2. \nBut the formula: l + n - h - 1 = 1 + 6 - 5 - 1 = 1. \n\nThat's wrong. \n\nWhy? \nThe formula: \n- Alice has eaten candies from index0 to index l-1 -> that's l candies.\n- Bob has eaten candies from index h+1 to index n-1 -> that's (n-1 - h) candies.\n\nIn the example: \nl=1 -> Alice has eaten [0] -> 1 candy.\nh=5 -> Bob has eaten [5] -> 1 candy? But then the next available for Bob is at index4? So the candies Bob has eaten are from index5 to index5 -> that's 1 candy. Then the total = 1+1=2.\n\nBut the formula: l + n - h - 1 = 1 + 6 - 5 - 1 = 1.\n\nWe see: the total candies = l (for Alice) + (n-1 - h) (for Bob) = 1 + (6-1-5) = 1+0=1? \n\nWait, the number of candies Bob has eaten is (n-1 - h) ? \n- Bob starts at h = n-1 (which is 5). Then he takes one candy -> then h becomes 4. Then the next time he would take at index4. But in the example, we only took one candy for Bob. So the candies Bob has eaten are from index5 to index5 -> that's 1 candy. How do we represent that? \nWe have: \n    Initially: h = 5 -> candy at 5 is available.\n    After taking: h becomes 4 -> then the candies Bob has taken are the ones from the original h=5 down to h+1? Actually, we have taken the candy at h=5 and then set h=4. Then the candies Bob has taken are the indices from h+1 (which is 5) to n-1 (which is 5). So that's one candy.\n\nBut the count: (n-1 - h) = (5 - 4) = 1? But wait: h is now 4. So the count = (n-1 - h) = 5 - 4 = 1? That is correct.\n\nBut in the formula: we have l + (n-1 - h) = 1 + (5-4) = 1+1=2.\n\nBut in the code: we have h=4 at the moment we set ans. So the formula: l + n - h - 1 = 1 + 6 - 4 - 1 = 2. \n\nBut in the simulation above, after step2 we set h=5? Actually, we started at h=5, then we did: \n    b = b + l1[5] -> then h = h-1 -> h becomes 4.\n\nSo at the moment we check a==b, we have l=1 and h=4. Then the formula: l + n - h - 1 = 1 + 6 - 4 - 1 = 2. \n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in the else branch is:\n\n            a += l1[l]\n            l += 1\n\nBut note: we must be cautious of the index. \n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: \nWe are given an integer n. We form a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. We can swap any two distinct indices any number of times. We want that the string \"BAN\" does not appear as a subsequence. We are to find the minimum number of operations and one such sequence.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n    if k == 1:\n        ans = max(1, k - 1)\n        print(ans)\n        print(1, 2)\n    else:\n        t = []\n        p = [0, 1, 2] * k   # This represents: for each block of \"BAN\", we have indices: \n                             # 0 for 'B', 1 for 'A', 2 for 'N'\n        x, y = 0, len(p) - 1\n        while x < y:\n            while x < y and p[x] != 1: x += 1\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n            if x >= y:\n                break\n            t.append([x + 1, y + 1])\n            p[x], p[y] = p[y], p[x]\n        print(len(t))\n        for x, y, in t:\n            print(x, y)\n\nThe idea for k>=2:\nWe are creating an array p that represents the positions of the characters in the string. For example, for k=2: \n    p = [0,1,2,0,1,2] \nwhich corresponds to the string: \n    index0: 'B', index1: 'A', index2: 'N', index3: 'B', index4: 'A', index5: 'N'\n\nWe are initializing two pointers: x at the beginning and y at the end.\n\nThen we are moving x until we find an element that is 1 (which represents 'A') and y until we find an element that is 2 (which represents 'N'). Then we swap them. Then we continue until x and y meet.\n\nBut the TODO: we need to complete the inner while loop for y.\n\nSo the missing part in the while condition for y is: we want to skip any character that is not 'N' (which is represented by 2). So we do:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: \n                y -= 1\n\nBut note: we must not forget to decrement y. \n\nBut then after we swap, we do: \n    t.append([x+1, y+1])   # because the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n    swap p[x] and p[y]\n\nThen we continue: we do not update x and y? Actually, after swapping, we leave x and y at their current positions? Then we move x and y in the next iteration? \n\nBut note: after swapping, the element at x becomes 2 (because we swapped an 'A' (1) with an 'N' (2))? Then the next time we look for an 'A' at x, we skip this one? Similarly, the element at y becomes 1? Then the next time we look for an 'N' at y, we skip this one? \n\nBut we are not updating x and y after the swap? We break the inner while loops and then we do the swap. Then we start the outer loop again: and then we do the inner while loops again? \n\nBut we have to move the pointers? Actually, after swapping, we have to move the pointers? The code does not move x and y after the swap. But then the next iteration: we start with the same x and y? \n\nBut note: we break the inner while loops and then we swap. Then we do nothing to x and y? Then the next iteration: we start with the same x and y? But we have swapped the elements at x and y. Then we do:\n\n    while x < y and p[x] != 1: ... \n    while x < y and p[y] != 2: ...\n\nBut if we swapped, then at position x we now have 2 (so we skip in the first inner while) and then we look at y: we have 1 (so we skip in the second inner while). Then we break? \n\nBut we need to move the pointers? Actually, after swapping, we should move the pointers? \n\nThe code does not explicitly move the pointers. But note: after swapping, we break the inner while loops and then we do the swap and then we break the if? Then we go to the next iteration of the outer while. Then we start the inner while loops again. \n\nBut the inner while loops will skip the current x and y? \n\nAlternatively, we can move the pointers after the swap? The problem: we are swapping an 'A' and an 'N'. Then we want to move x to the next position and y to the previous position? \n\nBut the code does not do that. Instead, we are going to skip the current x and y in the next inner while loops? \n\nBut the inner while loops are at the beginning of the outer while. So we start by skipping non-1's for x and non-2's for y. \n\nBut the current x (after swap) has a 2 -> so we skip it? Then we move x to the next one? Similarly, the current y has a 1 -> so we skip it? Then we move y to the previous one? \n\nSo we don't need to move them explicitly? \n\nBut the code: \n    while x < y:\n        while x < y and p[x] != 1: x += 1   # this will move x until it finds a 1 (or meets y)\n        while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1    # similarly for y\n        if x >= y: break\n        ... swap and record\n\nThen after the swap, we do not change x and y. Then the next iteration: we start by moving x (which now has a 2) -> so we skip it: x++ until we find a 1? Similarly for y: we skip the 1 and move y-- until we find a 2.\n\nSo it's okay.\n\nBut what about the example k=2? \n    p = [0,1,2,0,1,2] \n    x=0, y=5.\n\n    First inner while: \n        x: p[0]=0 -> skip -> x=1 -> p[1]=1 -> stop.\n    Second inner while: \n        y: p[5]=2 -> stop.\n    Then we swap p[1] and p[5]: \n        p becomes: [0,2,2,0,1,1]\n    Then we record (1+1,5+1) = (2,6).\n\n    Then the next iteration: \n        x=1, y=5.\n        First inner while: p[1]=2 -> skip -> x=2 -> p[2]=2 -> skip -> x=3 -> p[3]=0 -> skip -> x=4 -> p[4]=1 -> stop.\n        Second inner while: p[5]=1 -> skip -> y=4 -> p[4]=1 -> skip -> y=3 -> p[3]=0 -> skip -> y=2 -> p[2]=2 -> stop.\n        Now x=4, y=2 -> x>=y -> break.\n\n    So we have one swap: [2,6]. \n\n    Then we output:\n        1\n        2 6\n\n    But the example note says: for the second test case, we swap s(2)_2 and s(2)_6 -> which is (2,6). So that matches.\n\n    However, the example note says: converting to \"BNNBAA\". But our string after swap: \n        original: \n            index0: 'B' (0)\n            index1: 'A' (1) -> becomes 2 -> 'N'\n            index2: 'N' (2) -> remains 2 -> 'N'\n            index3: 'B' (0)\n            index4: 'A' (1) -> remains 1? But we swapped index1 and index5. \n            index5: 'N' (2) -> becomes 1 -> 'A'\n\n        So the string: \n            index0: 'B'\n            index1: 'N' (from the swap: originally at index5 was 'N')\n            index2: 'N'\n            index3: 'B'\n            index4: 'A'\n            index5: 'A' (from the swap: originally at index1 was 'A')\n\n        So the string is \"B\" (index0), \"N\" (index1), \"N\" (index2), \"B\" (index3), \"A\" (index4), \"A\" (index5) -> \"BNNBAA\". \n\n    So it matches.\n\n    But the problem: is this the minimum? The example says for k=1 we do one swap. For k=2 we do one swap. \n\n    How about k=3? \n        p = [0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2]\n        We do:\n            First: \n                x: start at0 -> skip until index1 (1) -> x=1.\n                y: start at8 -> p[8]=2 -> stop.\n                swap (1,8): \n                    p[1] becomes 2, p[8] becomes 1.\n                Then we record (2,9)\n\n            Then:\n                x: now at1 -> we skip because p[1]=2 -> then x=2: p[2]=2 -> skip, x=3:0->skip, x=4:1->stop.\n                y: now at8: p[8]=1 -> skip, then y=7: p[7]=1 -> skip, y=6:0->skip, y=5:2->stop.\n                Then swap (5,6)? Actually, x=4, y=5 -> swap (5,6) -> but wait: \n                We swap p[4] and p[5]: \n                    p[4] was 1 -> becomes 2\n                    p[5] was 2 -> becomes 1\n                Then we record (5,6)\n\n            Then next:\n                x: now at4: p[4]=2 -> skip, then x=5: p[5]=1 -> stop.\n                y: now at5: but we swapped so y is now 5? Actually, after the swap we set y=5? Then we break because x=5 and y=5 -> x>=y.\n\n            So we have two swaps: (2,9) and (5,6). \n\n        Then we output:\n            2\n            2 9\n            5 6\n\n        But is that minimal? \n\n    The problem says: we are to output the minimum number of operations. \n\n    How do we know the minimum? The note says: for k=1, we do 1 swap. For k=2, we do 1 swap. For k=3, we do 2 swaps? \n\n    Actually, the problem says: \"It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most 10^5 operations under the constraints of the problem.\" and k<=100.\n\n    The provided code for k>=2 uses this two-pointer approach. \n\n    But the problem: what is the minimum? \n\n    We note: \n        The string has k occurrences of \"BAN\". \n        The subsequence \"BAN\" is formed by: a 'B' (0), then an 'A' (1), then an 'N' (2). \n\n        We want to break every occurrence of the subsequence? But note: we can break multiple by one swap? \n\n        The idea: if we swap every 'A' with an 'N' from the right half, we break the pattern. \n\n        How many swaps? We need to swap at least ceil(k/2) times? \n\n        For k=1: ceil(1/2)=1 -> matches.\n        For k=2: ceil(2/2)=1 -> matches.\n        For k=3: ceil(3/2)=2 -> matches.\n\n        So the minimum number of swaps is ceil(k/2). \n\n        But the code for k>=2: \n            We are swapping the first ceil(k/2) 'A's with the last ceil(k/2) 'N's? \n\n        How many swaps? The number of swaps we do is the number of pairs we form. And we break when x>=y. \n\n        How many swaps? \n            We start with x at the beginning and y at the end. \n            We pair the first 'A' with the last 'N', then the next 'A' with the next to last 'N', etc. \n            How many? It's the number of pairs we can form until the pointers cross. \n\n        The number of pairs: k//2? But for k=3: we do 2 swaps? Actually, 3//2 = 1? But we did 2. \n\n        Actually, we do: \n            k=3: we do two swaps: the first 'A' (at index1) and the last 'N' (at index8) -> then the next 'A' (at index4) and the next available 'N' (at index5). \n\n        Why two? Because there are two 'A's in the first half? \n\n        Actually, the total number of 'A's is k. We are going to swap the first floor((k+1)/2) 'A's? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note: we are going to do ceil(k/2) swaps. \n\n        But the code: \n            We break when x>=y. \n            How many swaps? It's the number of pairs we can form. \n\n        For k=1: we do 1 swap -> ceil(1/2)=1.\n        For k=2: we do 1 swap -> ceil(2/2)=1.\n        For k=3: we do 2 swaps -> ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n        So the number of swaps is ceil(k/2). \n\n        But the code for k>=2: \n            We are not printing the number of swaps as ceil(k/2). We are printing len(t). \n\n        And we are forming t as the list of swaps. \n\n        So the code for k>=2 is correct.\n\n        But the initial code for k==1: \n            ans = max(1, k-1) \n            for k=1: max(1,0)=1 -> then we print 1 and then (1,2). \n\n        But what if k=0? The problem says n>=1. \n\n        However, the problem says: for k>=1. \n\n        But the code for k>=2: \n            We are using two pointers and we are swapping the first ceil(k/2) pairs. \n\n        But note: the problem says: we can do zero operations? But for k=1, we must do at least one. \n\n        So the code for k==1 is correct.\n\n        But the problem: the code for k>=2: \n            We have: \n                t = []\n                p = [0,1,2] * k\n                x, y = 0, len(p)-1\n                while x < y:\n                    ... \n\n            Then we print len(t) and then the swaps.\n\n        But what if k=0? The problem says k>=1. \n\n        So the missing part in the inner while for y is: \n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: \n                y -= 1\n\n        But note: we must be cautious: we are decrementing y until we find a 2. \n\n        This matches the example.\n\n        However, the problem: the code for k>=2 does not cover k=1? We have an if k==1 and else for k>=2. \n\n        So we are good.\n\n        But the problem says: the input t (number of test cases) and then for each test case, an integer n (which is k in the code). \n\n        The code: \n            n = int(input())\n            for i in range(n):\n                k = int(input())\n                if k==1:\n                    ...\n                else:\n                    ...\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n            y -= 1\n\n        But note: the line is:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        We must write it as one line? \n\n        Actually, the code has:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must complete the line. We can write:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        But note: the code after the while loop has an if and then a break. \n\n        So we write: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But we must be careful: the entire line is:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        However, the code as given has a comment at the end of the line? Actually, the TODO is at the end. So we just need to complete the line.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: \n                y -= 1\n\n        But the original code has the TODO in the middle of the line? Actually, the line is:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        This is a comment. We can replace the entire line? But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We are to output the missing code. Since the TODO is in the middle of the line, we can output the entire corrected line? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the code that goes in the TODO part? But the TODO part is the body of the while loop. \n\n        The problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        We are to output in JSON: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        For program1, we output: \n            \"a += l1[l]\\n            l += 1\"\n\n        For program2, we output the code that should replace the TODO. But the TODO is in the middle of a line. \n\n        Actually, the TODO is in the else branch and the line is incomplete. We are to complete the line. \n\n        The intended code for the inner while loop for y is: \n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        But the line is already started. We only need to complete the body of the while loop? \n\n        The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We can output: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the line is:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We can write the body as \"y -= 1\", but then we must also note that we are in a while loop that might require multiple steps? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write a block? But the code is written as a one-liner? \n\n        But the problem: the code might be written as:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        So we output: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But what if we need multiple lines? The problem says: we can output a block? \n\n        However, the TODO is at the end of the line. So we can simply put the statement.\n\n        But note: the next line is:\n\n            if x >= y:\n                break\n\n        So we must not break the indentation.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program2: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But wait: what if there are multiple steps? The while loop condition: we want to decrement y until we find a 2. So we do:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2:\n                y -= 1\n\n        But the original code has the while condition and then a comment. We are to replace the TODO with the body. \n\n        The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        Since the while loop body is a single statement, we can write: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        And then the next line is the if statement. \n\n        But the code as given has the while loop without a body? We are to complete the body. \n\n        So we write: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the entire corrected line? But the problem says not to output the entire program. \n\n        We are to output only the missing part. \n\n        The missing part is the body of the while loop. \n\n        Therefore, we output: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the problem says \"blocks\" so we can output multiple lines? But here we only need one.\n\n        However, the example for program1 had two lines. We output two lines for program1.\n\n        For program2, we output one line.\n\n        But wait: the code for program2 has:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to complete the TODO. We can write:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        But that would be the entire line. But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the part after the colon? \n\n        Alternatively, we can consider: the TODO is at the end of the line. We are to write the body. \n\n        The body is \"y -= 1\". \n\n        So we output: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the next line is an if statement. We are not changing that.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for program2 is \"y -= 1\".\n\n        However, let me check: if we put \"y -= 1\" in the TODO, then the line becomes:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1   # but the comment is still there? \n\n        Actually, the comment is part of the original code? We are not removing it? \n\n        But the problem: the TODO is a comment. We are to replace the TODO with code? \n\n        Actually, the code is:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to write the body of the while loop. The body should be on the next line? Or we can put it on the same line? \n\n        The style: the first while loop for x is:\n\n            while x < y and p[x] != 1: x += 1\n\n        So it is written as a one-liner. \n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        But the problem: we are to output only the missing code. The missing code is the expression that goes in the body. \n\n        Since the body is a single statement, we can write: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But if we output \"y -= 1\", then the entire line becomes:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        which is what we want.\n\n        Alternatively, if the body is intended to be on the next line, we would output:\n\n            \\n        y -= 1\n\n        But the original code for the x while loop is a one-liner. So we do the same for y.\n\n        Therefore, we output: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output in JSON. \n\n        We must escape the string? \n\n        We are to output a string. \n\n        For program1: we have two lines: \n            \"a += l1[l]\\n            l += 1\"\n\n        For program2: one line: \n            \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But wait: the program1 code has 12 spaces after the newline? We must preserve the indentation? \n\n        The original program1: \n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO comment with two lines. The first line: \"a += l1[l]\" and the second: \"l += 1\". And we must indent them to the same level as the code in the else branch.\n\n        The current code in the else branch is at the same indentation as the if branch. \n\n        The if branch has:\n\n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n\n        So the else branch should have two lines with the same indentation. \n\n        Therefore, we output for program1: \n            \"a += l1[l]\\n            l += 1\"\n\n        (with 12 spaces at the beginning of the second line? Actually, the original code has 8 spaces for the while loop and then 4 for the if/else? Then 8 more for the branch? So the else branch is indented by 12? We can count: \n\n        The code:\n\n        for t in range(int(input())):   # 0\n            n=int(input())               # 4\n            l1=list(map(int,input().split()))   #4\n            l=0                          #4\n            h=n-1                        #4\n            ans=0                         #4\n            a=0                           #4\n            b=0                           #4\n            while(l<=h):                  #4\n                if(a>b):                  #8\n                    b=b+l1[h]             #12\n                    h=h-1                 #12\n                else:                     #8\n                    # TODO: Your code here   #12\n                if(a==b):                 #8\n                    ans=l+n-h-1           #12\n            print(ans)                    #4\n\n        So the else branch has two lines that should be at 12 spaces. \n\n        But the TODO is a comment at 12 spaces. We replace that comment with:\n\n            a += l1[l]\n            l += 1\n\n        and each line should be indented by 12 spaces. \n\n        But the problem: the code we output is the string that goes in the else branch. \n\n        We output: \n            \"a += l1[l]\\n            l += 1\"\n\n        The string has a newline and then 12 spaces? \n\n        How many spaces? The current level is 12. \n\n        We can count: the else branch is at 8, then the comment is at 12. So we need 12 spaces for the two lines. \n\n        But the string: \n            \"a += l1[l]\\n            l += 1\"\n\n        The second line has 12 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the original code uses 4 spaces per indent. The while is at 4, the if/else at 8, and the body at 12. \n\n        So we need 12 spaces for the body. \n\n        The string: \n            \"a += l1[l]\\n            l += 1\"\n\n        The part after the newline: 12 spaces? \n\n        We can count: \n            \"            \" -> 12 spaces? Actually, 12 characters.\n\n        But in the code, the indentation is 12 spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we can output without specifying the spaces? But the problem requires the exact code.\n\n        We output the two lines with the same indentation as the if branch above. \n\n        Therefore, we output: \n            program1: \"a += l1[l]\\n            l += 1\"\n\n        For program2: we output: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the program2 code has:\n\n            while x < y and p[x] != 1: x += 1\n\n        So the y while loop should be similar: one line.\n\n        Therefore, the JSON:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"a += l1[l]\\n            l += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"y -= 1\"\n        }\n\n        But wait: the program2 code has:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO comment with \"y -= 1\", so the entire line becomes:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        But the comment is still there? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is a comment. We are to remove it? \n\n        The problem: we are to complete the code. The TODO is a placeholder. We remove it and put the code. \n\n        But the code we output is the body. We are not removing the comment? \n\n        How about we output: \"y -= 1\" and then the comment is still there? That would be:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: # TODO: Your code here\n            y -= 1\n\n        That's not what we want.\n\n        We must replace the entire line? \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We are to output the code that completes the line. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the entire corrected line? But the problem says not to output the entire program. \n\n        We are to output only the missing part. \n\n        The missing part is the body of the while loop. \n\n        But the body is not a block? It is a single statement. \n\n        We can write: \"y -= 1\" and then the line becomes:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1   # but the comment is still there? \n\n        Actually, the comment is on the same line? We are not removing it. \n\n        But the comment is part of the original code? We are to leave it? \n\n        The problem: the TODO is a comment that we are to replace with code. But the code is not a comment. \n\n        We must remove the TODO comment? \n\n        How? \n\n        The problem does not say. \n\n        But note: the example for program1: we are replacing a comment with two lines. \n\n        For program2, we are replacing a comment with a statement on the same line. \n\n        We can output: \"y -= 1  \" to override the comment? \n\n        But that's not clean. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the entire line? \n\n        But the problem says: only the missing code. \n\n        I think the intended solution is to output the body of the while loop as a string, and then the system will replace the TODO line with:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        because the body is \"y -= 1\" and we put it after the colon. \n\n        So we output: \"y -= 1\"\n\n        And then the line becomes:\n\n            while x < y and p[y] != 2: y -= 1\n\n        which is what we want.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
