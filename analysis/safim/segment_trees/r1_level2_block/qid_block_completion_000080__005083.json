    },
    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute, after each update, the total sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,1,1] has awesomeness 1, [1,2] has 2, [1,2,2] has 2, [1,2,2,3] has 3.\n\nWe note that the total awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays can be computed by considering the contributions of the boundaries between adjacent elements.\n\nSpecifically, consider two adjacent elements a[i] and a[i+1]. They contribute to the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] if and only if the subarray includes both i and i+1, and if a[i] != a[i+1]. In such a case, the boundary between i and i+1 will cause an extra block (so the awesomeness of the subarray is increased by 1 because of this boundary).\n\nMoreover, note that the entire set of contiguous subarrays that include the segment [i, i+1] is: l in [1, i] and r in [i+1, n]. There are i * (n - i) such subarrays.\n\nTherefore, the total awesomeness for the entire array is:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2   (each single element is a subarray and has awesomeness 1, and then we add the boundaries)\n\nBut note: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 (for the first element) plus the number of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j] != a[j+1].\n\nTherefore, the total sum is:\n  total = (number of subarrays) + (for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) with a[i]!=a[i+1], the number of subarrays that include this boundary)\n\nBut note: the base of 1 per subarray is the same as if we had a boundary at the beginning of each element? Actually, we can think:\n\n  total = (number of subarrays) + (for each boundary i (from 1 to n-1) that is a change, add the number of subarrays that include that boundary)\n\nHowever, note that the first element always starts a block, so the awesomeness is 1 + (number of boundaries inside the subarray that are changes). Therefore, the total is:\n\n  total = (n*(n+1)//2) + (for each i from 0 to n-2, if a[i] != a[i+1] then add (i+1)*(n-i-1))\n\nBut wait: the subarray [l, r] has l from 0 to n-1 and r from l to n-1 (if we use 0-indexing). The boundary between i and i+1 is included in a subarray if l<=i and r>=i+1. The number of such subarrays is (i+1) * (n - i - 1) because:\n  - l can be from 0 to i (i+1 choices)\n  - r can be from i+1 to n-1 (n-i-1 choices)\n\nSo initial total = n*(n+1)//2 + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [ (i+1)*(n-i-1) * (1 if a[i]!=a[i+1] else 0) ]\n\nBut note: the base n*(n+1)//2 is the total number of subarrays? Actually, the total number of contiguous subarrays is n*(n+1)//2. And each subarray has at least one block. Then each boundary that is a change adds 1 to the awesomeness of the subarrays that include that boundary.\n\nTherefore, we can maintain:\n  ans = base + sum_{for each adjacent pair i (0-indexed) that is a change} ( (i+1) * (n-1-i) )\n\nHowever, note that the base is the total number of subarrays? Actually, the base is the total number of subarrays? Yes, because each subarray has at least one block. Then each boundary that is a change adds 1 for every subarray that includes that boundary.\n\nBut wait: the base is the entire n*(n+1)//2? Actually, the awesomeness of a subarray is 1 (for the first block) plus the number of boundaries that are changes within the subarray. So:\n\n  total_awesomeness = (number of subarrays) + (for each boundary i that is a change, the number of subarrays that include that boundary)\n\nSo we can write:\n\n  total_awesomeness = n*(n+1)//2 + S, \n  where S = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [ (a[i] != a[i+1]) * (i+1) * (n-1-i) ]\n\nNow, we have m queries. Each query updates one element at index i (1-indexed) to x. This update might change the boundaries at positions i-1 (if i>1) and i (if i<n). Specifically, the boundaries are between (i-1 and i) and (i and i+1). \n\nWe need to:\n  - Remove the contributions of the old boundaries (if they were changes) at positions i-1 and i (if they existed) from S.\n  - Update the array a at position i to x.\n  - Add the contributions of the new boundaries at positions i-1 and i (if they are changes) to S.\n\nThen the total_awesomeness = n*(n+1)//2 + S.\n\nBut note: the base (n*(n+1)//2) is constant.\n\nSo we can precompute the initial S and then update S at each query.\n\nSteps for program1.py:\n\n  n, m = map(int, input().split())\n  a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n  # Precompute the initial S:\n  base = n*(n+1)//2\n  S = 0\n  # We'll create an array for the boundaries? Actually, we can precompute for each adjacent pair.\n  # But we are going to update, so we need to store the current state.\n\n  # Alternatively, we can maintain S and update it per query.\n\n  # For each boundary index i (0-indexed boundary between i and i+1), the contribution is (i+1)*(n-1-i) if a[i]!=a[i+1].\n\n  # Initially:\n  for i in range(n-1):\n      if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n          S += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n  total_awesomeness = base + S\n\n  # But note: the base is constant? Actually, the base is the total number of subarrays, which is fixed.\n\n  # However, the problem says: after each query, print the total.\n\n  # For each query (i, x): \n  #   index = i-1 (0-indexed)\n  #   We are going to change a[i-1] to x.\n\n  # This change affects:\n  #   The boundary at (i-2, i-1) if i-1 > 0 (i.e., if i-1 is not the first element) -> boundary index = i-2 (0-indexed boundary index between i-2 and i-1)\n  #   The boundary at (i-1, i) if i-1 < n-1 -> boundary index = i-1 (0-indexed)\n\n  # Also, the boundary at (i, i+1) if i < n? Actually, the element at i-1 is updated, so the boundaries that involve the updated element are:\n  #   left boundary: between the element at position i-2 and the updated element at i-1 (if i-1>0)\n  #   right boundary: between the updated element at i-1 and the element at i (if i-1 < n-1)\n\n  # Steps for a query (i, x) (with i being 1-indexed index to update):\n  #   pos = i-1 (0-indexed)\n  #   old_value = a[pos]\n  #   new_value = x\n\n  #   We remove the contributions of the boundaries that are now invalid (if they were active) and then add the new ones.\n\n  #   For the left boundary (if pos > 0):\n  #       old_left: a[pos-1] vs old_value -> if they were different, then we had a contribution of (pos) * (n-1 - (pos-1)) = (pos) * (n-pos)\n  #       new_left: a[pos-1] vs new_value -> if they are different, then we will add (pos) * (n-pos)\n  #   Similarly, for the right boundary (if pos < n-1):\n  #       old_right: old_value vs a[pos+1] -> if different, contribution was (pos+1) * (n-1 - pos) = (pos+1)*(n-pos-1)\n  #       new_right: new_value vs a[pos+1] -> if different, we add (pos+1)*(n-pos-1)\n\n  #   Then update a[pos] = x.\n\n  #   Then update S: \n  #       S = S - (old_left_contribution if existed) - (old_right_contribution if existed)\n  #       then add the new_left_contribution and new_right_contribution if they exist.\n\n  #   Then total_awesomeness = base + S\n\n  # However, note: the base is fixed? Actually, the base is the total number of subarrays, which is n*(n+1)//2, and it never changes.\n\n  # But note: the base is fixed? The number of subarrays is fixed: n*(n+1)//2.\n\n  # Therefore, we can do:\n\n  #   base = n*(n+1)//2   (constant)\n\n  #   For each query, we update S and then output base + S.\n\n  # However, note: the example: \n  #       n=5, m=?\n  #       initial array: [1, 2, 3, 2, 5]\n  #       Query: 4 4 -> update index 4 (0-indexed index 3) from 2 to 4.\n\n  #   Before update: \n  #       boundaries: \n  #         0: 1 vs 2 -> different -> add 1*4 = 4\n  #         1: 2 vs 3 -> different -> add 2*3 = 6\n  #         2: 3 vs 2 -> different -> add 3*2 = 6\n  #         3: 2 vs 5 -> different -> add 4*1 = 4\n  #         S = 4+6+6+4 = 20\n  #         base = 15, so total = 35.\n\n  #   But the example says after the first query (which is updating index 4 to 4) the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29.\n\n  #   Why 29? \n  #       base = 15\n  #       Now boundaries:\n  #         0: 1 vs 2 -> different -> 1*4 = 4\n  #         1: 2 vs 2 -> same -> 0\n  #         2: 2 vs 4 -> different -> 3*2 = 6\n  #         3: 4 vs 5 -> different -> 4*1 = 4\n  #         S = 4+0+6+4 = 14, so total = 15+14=29.\n\n  #   So we see that the update at index 4 (0-indexed index 3) affects boundaries at index2 (between 2 and 3) and index3 (between 3 and 4). But note: the update at index3 (0-indexed) affects:\n  #       left boundary: between index2 and index3 -> which is boundary index2 (0-indexed boundary index = 2)\n  #       right boundary: between index3 and index4 -> boundary index3 (0-indexed boundary index = 3)\n\n  #   However, the example also shows that the boundary at index1 (0-indexed boundary index=1) changed? Actually, the update at index3 (0-indexed) does not affect the boundary at index1? \n  #   But wait: the array was [1,2,3,2,5] and we update the 4th element (index3) to 4 -> becomes [1,2,3,4,5]? \n  #   Actually, the example says: after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n  #   The problem says: the first query is \"4 4\", meaning update the 4th element to 4. The initial array is [1,2,3,2,5].

  I think we should output the code as described and hope.\n\n  #   However, note: the example output for the first query is 29, which is for the array [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n  #   We can compute for [1,2,2,4,5] with our method:\n  #       base = 15\n  #       boundaries: \n  #         i0: 1!=2 -> 1*4=4\n  #         i1: 2==2 -> 0\n  #         i2: 2!=4 -> 3*2=6\n  #         i3: 4!=5 -> 4*1=4\n  #         S = 4+0+6+4 = 14\n  #         total = 15+14=29.\n\n  #
