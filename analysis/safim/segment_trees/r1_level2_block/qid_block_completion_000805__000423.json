Operation4: backward: [1-1=0,0,0,0] -> [0,0,0,0] and move to pos0 -> then we are at 0? But we have the array [0,0,0,0]? not [1,-1,1,-1]. How to get [1,-1,1,-1]? We must:\n                    Start at 0: \n                        forward: a0=1, at1. Then we want to get a1=-1: we can only do that by leaving a1 to the left? but to leave a1 to the left we must be at1 and then do a backward move: then a1 becomes -1 and we move to0. Then we are at0. Then we do forward again: a0 becomes 2, at1. Then forward: a1 becomes 0, at2. Then forward: a2 becomes 1, at3. Then backward: a3 becomes -1, at2. Then we are at2? not at0. How to get back to0? Then from2: we can do backward: a2 becomes 0, at1. Then backward: a1 becomes -1, at0. Then the array: a0=2, a1=-1, a2=0, a3=-1 -> not [1,-1,1,-1]. It seems difficult. Known solution from Codeforces submissions for the same problem (problem B in a contest) is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input()) a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                total = 0\n                ok = True\n                seen_zero = False\n                for i in range(n):\n                    total += a[i]\n                    if total < 0:\n                        ok = False\n                    if total == 0:\n                        seen_zero = True\n                    else:\n                        if seen_zero:\n                            ok = False\n                if ok and total == 0:\n                    print(\"Yes\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"No\") So the condition: if we have seen_zero and then we get a non-zero, then it's invalid.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about Alice and Bob eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code does:\n   t = number of test cases\n   for each test case:\n        n = number of candies\n        a = list of weights\n\n        x = sum(a) // 2   (this is a hint that the maximum total weight each can have is at most half the total)\n\n        Then it initializes s=0 and an empty dictionary d.\n        It iterates over the candies from left (Alice's side) and for each:\n            s += current candy weight\n            if s > x: ... (the TODO)\n            then it sets d[s] = idx+1   (the number of candies taken from the left to get this sum)\n\n        Then it does a similar thing from the right (Bob's side) but in reverse:\n            s=0, r=0\n            for each candy from the right:\n                s += current candy weight\n                if s is in d, then r = (number of candies from the right) + d[s] (which is the number of candies from the left that gave the same sum)\n\n        Then it prints r.\n\n The issue: The note says that in the first test case the answer is 2, but the provided code without the TODO might not work.\n\n The TODO: The note in the problem says that if the current sum s becomes greater than x (which is half the total) then we break? Because we cannot have a sum exceeding half the total? But note: the total sum might be odd, so we are only interested in sums that are at most half? However, the example test case 4: \n        weights: [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10]\n        total = 80, so x=40. \n        Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, then if she takes the next 5: 35 -> then 15 would make 50 -> too much? But note Bob is also taking from the right.\n\n However, the problem says: they want to be fair -> same total weight. And they want to maximize the total number of candies.\n\n The idea: We are going to precompute the prefix sums from the left and store the number of candies (index+1) for each prefix sum. But note: we can break early when the prefix sum exceeds half the total? Because if the prefix sum is already more than half, then we cannot form a matching with Bob? Actually, Bob's part must be at most the remaining, but note: the entire array is fixed. However, the problem does not require that they eat all candies. They can leave some in the middle.\n\n But note: the condition is that they eat from the two ends without overlapping. So the two segments (from left and from right) must be disjoint.\n\n The key: We are going to look for a common sum S such that the prefix from the left is S and the suffix from the right is S. Then the total candies eaten is (number of candies in the prefix) + (number of candies in the suffix). We want to maximize that.\n\n However, the total sum of the entire array might be 2S, but they don't have to eat the entire array. But note: if they leave some in the middle, then the two segments are disjoint.\n\n The algorithm in the code:\n   We build a dictionary d that maps a prefix sum to the number of candies (the index+1) that achieved that sum. But note: we break when the prefix sum becomes too large? Actually, we don't want to consider prefix sums that are greater than half the total? Because if the prefix sum is already greater than half, then we cannot have a matching suffix (since the suffix would have to be at least as big as the prefix to match? but wait, the suffix is also starting from the right and we are going to match the same sum). Actually, we can break when the prefix sum exceeds half the total? Because if the prefix sum is already > total/2, then we cannot have a matching suffix that equals the prefix? Because the total of the entire array is fixed, and if the prefix is more than half, then the suffix (which is the remaining) is less than half? But note: the suffix we are taking is a contiguous segment from the right, and the entire array might not be taken. However, the condition is that the two segments are disjoint and the sum of the two segments must be equal. Therefore, the sum S must be at most total/2.\n\n So we can break the first loop when s > x (which is total//2). But note: total might be odd, so x = total//2 (integer division) which is floor(total/2). Then we break because we cannot use a prefix that is already more than half? Actually, we can break because any further prefix will be even larger and we are only interested in sums that are at most total//2? But note: we might have a prefix that is exactly total//2? Then we don't break until after we record that.\n\n However, the code currently does:\n        if s > x: \n            ... (TODO: what to do here? break? or skip? or continue?)\n\n The next step: we are going to iterate from the right and check if the suffix sum is in the dictionary. But if we break the first loop, then we don't record any prefix sum beyond x. That is acceptable because any prefix beyond x is too big to be matched by a suffix (since the suffix would have to be at least the same, but the entire array is fixed and the suffix is taken from the right without overlapping, so the total of the two segments would be 2S, which must be <= total? Actually, 2S <= total -> S <= total/2). So we break the loop when s > x.\n\n Therefore, we can break the loop when s > x? But note: we are building the dictionary for all prefix sums that are <= x. However, we must record the prefix sum that is exactly x? Then we break after we record it? Actually, we can break after we have passed x? Because the next candy will make it even larger? So we break when s > x? But note: we are at the current candy and we have already added it. Then we break? But we have already recorded the prefix sum for the current index? Actually, we do the check after adding. Then we record d[s] = idx+1 even if s > x? That is not what we want.\n\n Therefore, we should break the loop when s > x? Actually, we can break the loop at the moment we exceed x? Because we don't want to record any prefix that is above x? And also, we don't want to continue because the next will be even larger? So we break.\n\n But note: what if we break, then we don't process the rest of the prefix? That is acceptable because we are only interested in prefix sums that are <= x.\n\n So the TODO: break the loop when s > x.\n\n However, let's test with the example: [1,1] -> total=2, x=1.\n   idx0: i=1 -> s=1 -> not >1 -> record d[1]=1.\n   idx1: i=1 -> s=2 -> 2>1 -> break. Then we don't record d[2]=2? That's okay because we don't need 2.\n\n Then from the right:\n   reverse: [1,1]\n   idx0: i=1 -> s=1 -> check: 1 in d -> then r = 0+1 + d[1] = 1+1 = 2 -> which is correct.\n\n Another example: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> total=80, x=40.\n   We build prefix until we exceed 40? \n        prefix: 7 -> 10 -> 30 -> 35 -> 50 (break at 50? so we stop at 35? which is the 4th candy? but note the example says Alice ate [7,3,20] -> 30, and Bob ate [10,8,11,1] -> 30. So we need to record the prefix 30 at index2 (3 candies) and then when we see the suffix 30 (which is 10+8+11+1=30) at 4 candies, then total=7.\n\n   How do we get the suffix 30? \n        We traverse from the right: \n            start: 10 -> s=10 -> not in d? (d has: 7,10,30,35) -> 10 is in d? yes, but then r = 1 (from right) + d[10] (which is 2) -> 3? \n            then 10+8=18 -> not in d.\n            then 10+8+11=29 -> not in d.\n            then 10+8+11+1=30 -> in d -> then r = 4 (from right) + d[30] (which is 3) -> 7.\n\n   So we need to record the prefix 30. But note: we break at 35? because 35<=40? no, 35<=40 -> we don't break. Then we record 35. Then next: 35+15=50 -> 50>40 -> break. So we break at that point and don't record 50? and we have recorded 35? but we don't need 35? we need 30 and 35? but 30 was recorded.\n\n   So the break condition is: if s > x: break. But note: we break after we have added the current candy and found s>x? Then we break without recording the current s? Actually, we break after the check and before the recording? The code currently has:\n\n        s += i\n        if s > x: \n            ...   # TODO: break? \n        d[s] = idx+1\n\n   But if s > x, we don't want to record that? So we should break without recording? So we do:\n\n        s += i\n        if s > x:\n            break\n        d[s] = idx+1\n\n   However, what if we break, then we skip the recording? That is what we want.\n\n   But what if we break at the first candy? Then we don't record the first candy? Actually, if the first candy is already > x, then we break and don't record. Then when we do the suffix, we might have a suffix that is 0? but note: we are not recording 0? and the prefix dictionary doesn't have 0? Actually, the problem says they can eat zero candies? but the example test case 3: [0]? Actually, the example test case 3: [1, -1]? No, the problem says: for the third test case, there is no way to eat the same non-zero weight -> answer 0. But the array is given? Actually, the input for the third test case: n=2, [1, -1]? But wait, the weights are positive? The problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn (1<=wi<=10000)\". So all weights are positive. Then the third test case: [1, -1] is not possible? Actually, the example says: for the fourth test case: [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10]. So the third test case must be: n=2, [1,1]? but that was the first test case? \n\n   Actually, the note says: \n        For the first test case: [1,1] -> answer 2.\n        For the second test case: [2,1,4,3] -> answer 6? but wait, the note says: Alice eats the first three from the left: [2,1,4] -> 7, Bob eats the first three from the right: [4,3,1]? but the array is [2,1,4,3]? then the first three from the left: [2,1,4] and the first three from the right: [3,4,1]? but that overlaps. \n\n   Correction: the note says for the second test case: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\". The array must be of length 6? Actually, the note says: \"the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total)\". So the array has 6 candies? and they eat all? So the array: [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6] -> Alice: [a1,a2,a3] and Bob: [a6,a5,a4]? and the condition is that the sum of Alice = sum of Bob = 7? and the entire array sum=14? \n\n   So the second test case: n=6, [2,1,4,3,1,2]? but then the sum of the first three: 2+1+4=7, and the last three: 2+1+3=6? not 7. Alternatively: [1,2,3,4,1,2]? then Alice: 1+2+3=6, Bob: 2+1+4=7? not equal. How about [1,2,4,3,1,2]? then Alice: 1+2+4=7, Bob: 2+1+3=6? no. [2,3,2,1,2,3]? Alice: 2+3+2=7, Bob: 3+2+2=7? and the entire array: 2+3+2+1+2+3=13? not 14. \n\n   Actually, the note says: \"they cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten\". So the entire array is eaten? Then the array must be of length 6 and the entire array sum is 14? and they split into two sets of 3 each with sum 7? So the array: [1,3,3,3,3,1]? then Alice: 1+3+3=7, Bob: 1+3+3=7? and the middle is empty? Actually, the array is [1,3,3,3,3,1] -> then the first three: [1,3,3] and the last three: [1,3,3]? but the last three are the 6th,5th,4th? so the array: \n        index0:1, index1:3, index2:3, index3:3, index4:3, index5:1.\n        Alice: [0,1,2] -> 1+3+3=7\n        Bob: [5,4,3] -> 1+3+3=7.\n\n   So the prefix: \n        s0=1 -> record d[1]=1\n        s1=4 -> record d[4]=2\n        s2=7 -> record d[7]=3 -> then next: 7+3=10 -> which is >14//2=7? so break? because 10>7? then we break.\n\n   Then from the right:\n        start: 1 -> s=1 -> in d? yes -> then r = 1 (from right) + d[1] (which is 1) = 2.\n        then 1+3=4 -> in d -> r = 2+2=4.\n        then 1+3+3=7 -> in d -> r = 3+3=6.\n\n   So we get 6.\n\n   Therefore, the break condition is: if s > x: break.\n\n   So for program1.py, the missing code is: \"break\"\n\n   But note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so breaking early is efficient.\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem: We have an array that we want to achieve by moving a pointer and doing operations. The operations are:\n   - If not at last, increase current by 1 and move to next.\n   - If not at first, decrease current by 1 and move to previous.\n\n And after all operations, the pointer must be at the first element.\n\n Conditions:\n   - The total sum of the array must be 0? because every time we move forward we add 1 to the current and then move, and when we move backward we subtract 1 and then move? Actually, the net effect: \n        Consider the entire sequence of operations. Each forward move: \n            operation: add 1 to current and move to next -> so the current element is increased by 1 and then we leave it? \n        Each backward move: subtract 1 from current and move to previous.\n\n        How does the array get built? \n            The array starts as [0,0,...,0]. \n            The operations: \n                Forward: at position i, we do: a[i] += 1, then move to i+1.\n                Backward: at position i, we do: a[i] -= 1, then move to i-1.\n\n        Now, note that the pointer starts at 0 and must end at 0.\n\n        We can model the entire journey as a sequence of moves. The net effect on the array can be seen by the number of times we leave a node in the forward direction and the backward direction? Actually, each time we traverse an edge from i to i+1, we leave i by a forward move (which adds 1 to a[i]) and then we might come back? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think of the array as being built by the net visits? Actually, the value at a node i is the number of times we left i to go to i+1 minus the number of times we left i to go to i-1? But note: \n            When we are at i and we go to i+1: we add 1 to a[i] and then move to i+1.\n            When we are at i and we go to i-1: we subtract 1 from a[i] and then move to i-1.\n\n        Also, when we come to i from i-1 (by a forward move) we don't change a[i]? and when we come to i from i+1 (by a backward move) we don't change a[i]? \n\n        Actually, the operations only change the current element when we leave it? \n\n        Therefore, the value at position i is:\n            a[i] = (number of times we left i to go to i+1) - (number of times we left i to go to i-1)\n\n        But note: we start at 0 and end at 0. We can model the entire path as a walk that starts and ends at 0.\n\n        How about the net flow? \n            Let f(i) be the number of times we traverse the edge from i to i+1 (forward) and b(i) be the number of times we traverse the edge from i+1 to i (backward). Then the value at i:\n                a[0] = f(0) - b(0)   [because we leave 0 to go to 1: f(0) times, and we leave 0 to go to -1? but we cannot go to -1? so we never leave 0 to the left? Actually, the pointer is at 0 and we can only do the forward move? or the backward move? but backward from 0 is not allowed? so condition: the pointer is not on the first element -> so at 0 we cannot go backward? so b(0)=0? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"If the pointer is not on the first element, ...\". So at 0, we cannot do the backward move. Similarly, at the last element we cannot do the forward move.\n\n        Therefore, the moves are constrained: \n            We can only leave a node i to the right if we are at i and i is not the last? and to the left if we are at i and i is not the first.\n\n        Now, the value at i:\n            a[i] = (number of forward moves from i) - (number of backward moves from i)\n\n        But note: we also have incoming moves? \n            How do we get to i? \n                We can come from i-1 (by a forward move) and then we leave? \n                We can come from i+1 (by a backward move) and then we leave?\n\n            However, the operation only changes the current node when we leave? \n\n        So the value a[i] is only affected by the leaves from i? \n\n        Therefore, we have:\n            a[0] = f(0)   [because we cannot leave backward from 0, so b(0)=0]\n            For i from 1 to n-2: \n                a[i] = f(i) - b(i)\n            For a[n-1]: we cannot leave forward from n-1? so a[n-1] = -b(n-1)\n\n        But note: the entire path must be such that the net flow is consistent? \n            The number of times we enter a node must equal the number of times we leave? \n            For node 0: \n                We start at 0 (so one extra time at the beginning) and we end at 0 (so one extra time at the end). \n                The moves: \n                    We leave 0: f(0) times to go to 1.\n                    We enter 0: b(0) times from 1? but b(0) is the backward moves from 0? which we said is 0? and also from the right? we cannot? \n                Actually, we start at 0: that counts as being at 0 at the beginning. Then we leave f(0) times to 1. Then we come back to 0? how? by a backward move from 1? which would be: at 1 we do a backward move: then we subtract 1 at 1 and move to 0. Then we are at 0. \n\n            So the net flow at 0 (except the start and end) is:\n                in(0) = b(1)   [the backward moves from 1 to 0]\n                out(0) = f(0)\n                and we have: \n                    start: +1\n                    end: we are at 0 at the end: so we must have the net: \n                    (1 + in(0)) = out(0) + 1   -> because we start at 0 and end at 0? \n                    => 1 + b(1) = f(0) + 1  -> so b(1)=f(0)\n\n            Similarly, for node 1:\n                in(1) = f(0) [from 0] + b(2) [from 2 to 1 by backward moves]\n                out(1) = f(1) + b(1) [leaving to 2 and to 0]\n                and we don't start or end at 1? so in(1)=out(1) -> f(0)+b(2)=f(1)+b(1)\n\n            But we have a[0]=f(0)=? and a[1]=f(1)-b(1)=?\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a different idea:\n\n        We know the entire path must start at 0 and end at 0. We can model the walk as a sequence of steps. Let d[i] be the net number of times we have passed from i to i+1 (forward) minus the net number of times we have passed from i+1 to i (backward). Then the value at i is d[i] - d[i-1]? \n\n        Actually, consider:\n            When we go from i to i+1: we add 1 to a[i] and then we are at i+1. \n            When we go from i+1 to i: we subtract 1 from a[i+1] and then we are at i.\n\n            But note: the value at i is also affected by moves that leave i to the left? and to the right? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a prefix sum approach:\n\n        Let p[0] = 0.\n        For i from 0 to n-1:\n            We have: \n                a[i] = (number of times we left i to the right) - (number of times we left i to the left)\n\n            But note: the number of times we leave i to the right is the same as the number of times we enter i+1 from the left? \n            Similarly, the number of times we leave i to the left is the same as the number of times we enter i-1 from the right? \n\n        Actually, we can define an array d[0..n] for edges: \n            Let d[0] = number of times we went from 0 to 1 (forward) \n            d[1] = number of times we went from 1 to 2 (forward) \n            ... \n            d[n-1] = number of times we went from n-1 to n? but we cannot, so d[n-1]=0? \n\n            And also, we have backward moves: \n            Let e[0] = number of times we went from 1 to 0? \n            e[1] = number of times we went from 2 to 1? \n\n        Then the value at i:\n            a[0] = d[0] - e[0]   [but we cannot leave 0 to the left? so e[0]=0? and we cannot leave n-1 to the right? so d[n-1]=0?]\n\n            Actually, the problem says we cannot leave the first to the left? so e[0] must be 0? and we cannot leave the last to the right? so d[n-1]=0? \n\n            For i=0: a[0] = d[0] - 0 = d[0]\n            For i=1: a[1] = d[1] - e[1] \n            But note: the net flow at node 1: \n                in(1) = d[0] (from 0) + e[2] (from 2 to 1) \n                out(1) = d[1] (to 2) + e[1] (to 0)\n                and the net flow: in(1)=out(1) -> d[0]+e[2] = d[1]+e[1] -> which we can rearrange: d[0] - e[1] = d[1] - e[2] \n            But we see: a[0] = d[0] = d[0] - e[0] (with e[0]=0) -> so a[0]=d[0]\n            a[1] = d[1] - e[1] = (d[0] + e[2] - e[1]) - e[1]? -> not matching.\n\n        Another idea: \n            We can define an array p[0..n] of the net forward moves on the edges? \n            Let p[0] = total net forward moves from 0 to 1? (which is d[0] - e[0]? but e[0]=0, so p[0]=d[0])\n            Then at node 1: the net forward moves from 1 to 2: p[1] = d[1] - e[1]? \n            Then the value at node 0: a[0] = p[0] \n            The value at node 1: a[1] = p[1] - p[0]? \n            Why? because the moves that leave node1 to the right: d[1] and to the left: e[1]? so a[1]=d[1]-e[1] = p[1]? but then how is it related to p[0]? \n\n        Actually, consider the net moves that have passed through the edges? \n            The value at node 0: we start at 0, then we do p[0] net moves to the right? so we leave 0 p[0] times? so a[0]=p[0]? \n            Then at node 1: we have p[0] net moves coming in? and then we do p[1] net moves to the right? and also we might have moves that go back? but note: the net moves that leave node1 to the right is p[1]? and the net moves that leave node1 to the left is ...? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use a well known solution for this problem: \n            Conditions:\n                1. The total sum of the array must be 0.\n                2. The prefix sums (starting from the left) must be nonnegative? \n                3. And once the prefix sum becomes zero at some point, then the rest must be zero? \n\n        Actually, known similar problem: \"Robot on Array\".\n\n        The known solution for the same problem (from known contests) is:\n            - Check that the total sum is 0.\n            - Check that the prefix sums are nonnegative.\n            - Additionally, we must ensure that the first time we get a zero prefix (if we get any) then from that point onward we never have a positive move? Actually, no: we can have moves after a zero? but the condition is that we cannot have a positive prefix after a zero? because if we have a zero at position i, then the pointer must be at the first element at the end? and we are at position i? but we are not at the first element? \n\n        Actually, the known solution (from the note in the code) is:\n\n            if sum(arr) != 0: return False\n\n            psum = 0\n            f = 0   # flag: have we encountered a zero prefix?\n            for i in range(n):\n                psum += arr[i]\n                if psum < 0:\n                    return False\n                if psum == 0:\n                    f = 1\n                elif f:   # meaning we have encountered a zero before and now we have a positive prefix again?\n                    if psum > 0:\n                        return False   # because we cannot have a positive prefix after a zero? \n\n            return True\n\n        But the note says: \n            In the first test case: [0,0,...,0]? but the example says: \n                \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" \n            So the first test case must be: n=4, [0,0,0,0]? but the example says the pointer won't be on the first element? so it fails? \n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\"\n\n            So the array is [0,0,0,0]? and we can obtain it? but the condition is that the pointer must be at the first element at the end? so if we do no moves, we are at the first element? so it should be valid? \n\n        Correction: the example says: \"but the pointer won't be on the first element\" meaning that the example they are referring to is not valid? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"after we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element\". So the first test case must be an example that fails? \n\n        The note says: \n            \"One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown below: \n                <0,0,0,0> (underlined at first) -> ... -> <2, -1, -1, 0> (with the pointer at the first element)?\"\n\n        The second test case: [2, -1, -1, 0]? \n            total = 0.\n            prefix: \n                i0: 2 -> nonnegative -> then set f=0? \n                i1: 2-1=1 -> nonnegative -> f=0\n                i2: 1-1=0 -> then set f=1\n                i3: 0+0=0 -> then we are done.\n\n            Then we have: at i3, we have f=1 and then we have a zero? so no problem? \n\n        But the example in the note: \n            The array: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> valid.\n\n        Now, what about the condition: \n            \"elif f: ...\" -> if we have encountered a zero and then we get a nonzero? then we must fail? \n\n        Why? \n            Because if we have a zero at some point (say at index i), that means the pointer has returned to the start? (but note: the prefix sum being zero does not necessarily mean the pointer is at the start? it means the net moves have balanced? but the pointer could be anywhere?).\n\n        Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                if a[0] < 0:\n                    print(\"No\")\n                    continue\n                s = 0\n                has_zero = False\n                valid = True\n                for x in a:\n                    s += x\n                    if s < 0:\n                        valid = False\n                    if s == 0:\n                        has_zero = True\n                    else:\n                        if has_zero:\n                            valid = False\n                if valid and s==0:\n                    print(\"Yes\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"No\")\n\n        But wait, the condition in the else: if we have encountered a zero and then we get a non-zero? then it's invalid? \n\n        Why? \n            Because if we have a zero at some prefix, then the pointer has returned to the start? and then we do more operations? but then the array after that must be zero? because we are starting again? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: once the prefix sum becomes zero, then the rest of the array must be zero? \n\n        But the example: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> \n            prefix: \n                index0: 2 -> nonnegative, has_zero=False -> then condition: else: skip.\n                index1: 1 -> nonnegative, has_zero=False -> skip.\n                index2: 0 -> set has_zero=True.\n                index3: 0 -> then we are in the branch: if s==0: has_zero remains True? and then the condition: else: ... -> but s==0, so we don't go to the else? \n\n        Now, what if we have: [1, -1, 1]? \n            total=1 -> not zero -> invalid? \n        What if we have: [1, -1, 0, 0]? \n            prefix: \n                index0: 1 -> nonnegative, has_zero=False.\n                index1: 0 -> set has_zero=True.\n                index2: 0 -> then we are in the if s==0: set has_zero=True (already true) -> then the next: \n                index3: 0 -> same.\n            Then we have: at index2 and index3: we are in the state has_zero=True and s=0 -> so we don't enter the else? \n            But the condition: after a zero we have non-zero? we don't have non-zero? \n\n        What if we have: [1, -1, 1, -1]? \n            total=0.\n            prefix: \n                1 -> nonnegative -> has_zero=False.\n                0 -> has_zero=True.\n                then next: 1 -> now we have: s=1 and has_zero=True -> then we enter the else: and set valid=False? \n\n        Why is [1,-1,1,-1] invalid? \n            We start at 0: \n                We can do: \n                    forward: a[0] becomes 1, pointer at 1.\n                    backward: at 1: we do: a[1] becomes -1, then move to 0 -> now we are at 0? \n                    then we do forward: a[0] becomes 2, pointer at 1.\n                    then forward: a[1] becomes 0, pointer at 2.\n                    then forward: a[2] becomes 1, pointer at 3.\n                    then backward: a[3] becomes -1, then move to 2? \n                    then backward: a[2] becomes 0, move to 1? \n                    then backward: a[1] becomes -1, move to 0? \n                Then we have: a[0]=2, a[1]=-1-1=-2, a[2]=0, a[3]=-1? -> not [1,-1,1,-1].\n\n            Alternatively, we try:\n                Start: [0,0,0,0] at pos0.\n                Operation1: forward: [1,0,0,0] -> pos1.\n                Operation2: forward: [1,1,0,0] -> pos2.\n                Operation3: backward: [1,1-1=0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0] and then move to pos1.\n                Operation4: backward: [1-1=0,0,0,0] -> [0,0,0,0] and move to pos0 -> then we are at 0? \n                But we have the array [0,0,0,0]? not [1,-1,1,-1].\n\n            How to get [1,-1,1,-1]? \n                We must:\n                    Start at 0: \n                        forward: a0=1, at1.\n                    Then we want to get a1=-1: we can only do that by leaving a1 to the left? but to leave a1 to the left we must be at1 and then do a backward move: then a1 becomes -1 and we move to0. Then we are at0. \n                    Then we do forward again: a0 becomes 2, at1.\n                    Then forward: a1 becomes 0, at2.\n                    Then forward: a2 becomes 1, at3.\n                    Then backward: a3 becomes -1, at2.\n                Then we are at2? not at0.\n\n            How to get back to0? \n                Then from2: we can do backward: a2 becomes 0, at1.\n                Then backward: a1 becomes -1, at0. \n                Then the array: a0=2, a1=-1, a2=0, a3=-1 -> not [1,-1,1,-1].\n\n            It seems difficult. \n\n        Known solution from Codeforces submissions for the same problem (problem B in a contest) is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                total = 0\n                ok = True\n                seen_zero = False\n                for i in range(n):\n                    total += a[i]\n                    if total < 0:\n                        ok = False\n                    if total == 0:\n                        seen_zero = True\n                    else:\n                        if seen_zero:\n                            ok = False\n                if ok and total == 0:\n                    print(\"Yes\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"No\")\n\n        So the condition: if we have seen_zero and then we get a non-zero, then it's invalid.\n\n        Why? \n            Because if we have a zero at some prefix, that means we have returned to the start? and then we should not do any more operations? because if we do, then we are leaving the start again? and then we must return again? but the condition is that we must end at the start? so we can do operations after returning? but then we must return again? \n\n            However, the condition is that the entire array is built and then we are at the start? so we can have multiple returns? \n\n        But the known solution says: once we have a zero (meaning we have returned to the start at some point) then the rest of the array must be zero? \n\n        Why? \n            Because if we have a non-zero after a zero, then we have left the start again? and then we must have a way to return? but the problem does not require that we return at intermediate steps? only at the end? \n\n        However, consider: \n            [0,1,-1] -> \n                prefix: \n                    index0: 0 -> seen_zero=True.\n                    index1: 1 -> then we have: seen_zero is True and non-zero -> invalid? \n                But is [0,1,-1] valid? \n                    Start at0: \n                        We are at0: we can do a forward: a0=1, then at1? -> but then we have a0=1? not 0.\n\n            How to get a0=0? \n                We start at0: we do nothing? then we are at0. Then we want to set a0=0? we have it. Then we want to set a1=1? we must leave a1? but to set a1=1 we must be at1 and then do a forward move? but to get to1 we must do a forward move from0: which would set a0=1? \n\n            Alternatively, we do:\n                Start at0: \n                    forward: a0=1, at1.\n                    forward: a1=1, at2.\n                    backward: a2=-1, at1.\n                    backward: a1=0, at0.\n                Then we have: a0=1, a1=0, a2=-1 -> not [0,1,-1].\n\n            How about:\n                Start at0: \n                    backward: not allowed? \n                So we cannot leave a0=0 and then have a1=1? \n\n            Therefore, [0,1,-1] is invalid? \n\n        But what if we have: [0,0]? \n            prefix: \n                index0:0 -> seen_zero=True.\n                index1:0 -> then we don't enter the else? \n            valid? \n\n        How to build [0,0]? \n            We do nothing? then we are at0? and the array is [0,0]? valid.\n\n        So the condition: \n            - total=0\n            - prefix sums are nonnegative\n            - once we get a zero, the rest must be zero.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code in the TODO is: \n            return 0   (which means invalid, because the function returns 0 for failure and 1 for success)\n\n        But note: the code already has:\n\n            if psum < 0: return 0\n\n            if psum==0: f=1\n\n            elif f: \n                ...   # then we have a non-zero after a zero -> invalid.\n\n        So we do: \n            if f: \n                return 0   # because we have seen a zero and then we have a non-zero? \n\n        However, note: the condition is: we have seen a zero (f is True) and then we have a non-zero? \n\n        But the current state: we are in the 'elif f' block? which means psum !=0 and f is True? so we return 0.\n\n        So the missing code: \"return 0\"\n\n        But note: we break the loop as soon as we see this condition? \n\n        However, the problem says: the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so we can break early.\n\n        But the code structure: \n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                ... \n                if psum < 0: return 0\n                if psum==0: f=1\n                elif f: \n                    return 0   # break the function immediately\n\n            Then we return 1 at the end.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Let's test with the example [2, -1, -1, 0]:\n            i0: psum=2 -> nonnegative -> f=0 -> then condition: elif f: skip.\n            i1: psum=1 -> nonnegative -> f=0 -> skip.\n            i2: psum=0 -> set f=1.\n            i3: psum=0 -> set f=1 (remains) -> then condition: if psum==0 -> set f=1 (already set) -> then skip the elif.\n\n            Then we return 1 -> \"Yes\".\n\n        Now test with [1, -1, 1, -1]:\n            total=0 -> pass.\n            i0: psum=1 -> f=0 -> skip.\n            i1: psum=0 -> set f=1.\n            i2: psum=1 -> then condition: elif f: -> we return 0 -> \"No\".\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \"return 0\"\n\n        However, note: the problem says the array can have negative numbers? and we are checking psum<0? and then returning 0? and then if we have a non-zero after a zero we return 0? \n\n        This matches the known solution.\n\n        But note: what if we have a zero and then a zero? that is allowed? because we don't enter the elif? \n\n        Example: [0,0] -> \n            i0: psum=0 -> set f=1.\n            i1: psum=0 -> set f=1 (again) -> then we don't enter the elif? \n\n        So we return 1.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \"return 0\"\n\n        But note: the code structure: \n            for i in range(len(arr)):\n                psum += arr[i]\n                if psum < 0:\n                    return 0\n                if psum==0:\n                    f = 1\n                elif f:\n                    return 0   # this is the TODO\n\n        So the TODO is: return 0\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the condition \"elif f\" is only entered when psum !=0 and f is True? \n\n        So we write: \n            elif f:\n                return 0\n\n        But the code already has the \"elif f:\" and then the TODO is the body? \n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is: \"return 0\"\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\".

In program2.py, the TODO is a block? but it's a single line? \n\n        But note: the code in program2.py has:\n\n            elif f:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO comment with \"return 0\", so the block becomes:\n\n            elif f:\n                return 0\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" meaning the code that replaces the TODO? \n\n        So for program2.py, the missing code is the line \"return 0\", and for program1.py, the missing code is the line \"break\".\n\n        However, in program1.py, the code currently has:\n\n            if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO? so we write: \"break\" (without the quotes) and then the next line is \"d[s] = idx+1\" which we don't want to run if we break? \n\n        Actually, the code in program1.py:\n\n            s += i\n            if s > x: \n                ...   # we put break here\n            d[s] = idx+1\n\n        We want to break and skip the recording? so we do:\n\n            s += i\n            if s > x: \n                break\n            d[s] = idx+1\n\n        But the TODO is only the body of the if? \n\n        So the missing code for program1.py is: \"break\"\n\n        Therefore, the answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"break\",\n            \"program2\": \"return 0\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that goes in the TODO. \n\n        However, in program1.py, the TODO is in the line with the if condition? and we are to put the code in the body? \n\n        The code: \n            if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to write the code that goes in the body? so we write: \"break\"\n\n        And in program2.py: \n            elif f:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We write: \"return 0\"\n\n        So we output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"break\",\n            \"program2\": \"return 0\"\n        }\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        We output the json.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: in program1.py, the break is a single line? and in program2.py, the return 0 is a single line? \n\n        But what if the block requires multiple lines? \n\n        In this case, each is one line.\n\n        Therefore, the answer."
