    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n We are simulating falling stones in a grid. The grid has obstacles and stones. Stones fall until they hit an obstacle, the floor, or another stone that has already stopped.\n\n The provided code does:\n   a = [input() for _ in range(n)]   # reads the grid\n\n   Then, it transposes the grid (using zip(*a)) and then for each column (which is now a string of the column) it splits by 'o' (obstacles). \n   This breaks the column into segments between obstacles.\n\n   Then, for each segment, it sorts the characters in reverse order (which effectively moves all stones (represented by '*') to the bottom (which in the segment is the right when we reverse) because when we sort in reverse, the '*' (which has ASCII 42) is greater than '.' (ASCII 46) so they come first. Then we join the segments back with 'o'.\n\n   Then, we transpose back and output row by row.\n\n However, the output part is incomplete. We have:\n        for row in zip(*at):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n We need to output each row as a string. Since `row` is a tuple of characters, we can join them to form a string.\n\n So we can do: print(''.join(row))\n\n But note: the problem says \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\", but the sample outputs do have new lines for each row and each test case? \n Actually, the problem says \"output a grid with n rows and m columns\", meaning we output n lines for each test case.\n\n However, the note says \"it is in the samples just for clarity\" meaning that the sample outputs have new lines for each test case? \n But actually, we must output the grid for each test case with n rows (each row is a string of m characters) and then move to the next test case.\n\n Since the problem has multiple test cases, we must output each test case's grid as n lines.\n\n But note: the provided code already has a loop for each test case. We are inside the test case loop.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is to print each row as a string.\n\n However, note that the problem says: \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\" meaning that we don't output an extra blank line after the test case? \n But we do output each row of the grid on a separate line.\n\n So we can do:\n        for row in zip(*at):\n            print(''.join(row))\n\n But note: the problem says \"output a grid with n rows and m columns\", so we output n lines per test case.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the problem says \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\", meaning that after the last row of the grid we don't output an extra blank line? \n But the sample outputs do have a newline at the end of each row? That is standard.\n\n Actually, the sample input and output format is:\n\n Input:\n   t\n   n m\n   grid lines...\n\n Output:\n   for each test case: n lines of m characters.\n\n So we output the grid for the test case, and then the next test case's grid.\n\n But note: the problem says \"it is in the samples just for clarity\" meaning that the sample outputs have a blank line between test cases? \n Actually, the problem says: \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\", meaning that we don't output an extra blank line after the entire grid of a test case? \n However, the sample outputs in the problem statement might have a blank line for clarity, but we are not required to output that.\n\n But the problem says: \"output a grid with n rows and m columns\", so we output n rows. Each row is a string and we output a newline at the end of each row.\n\n So the code for program1.py missing part is:\n\n        for row in zip(*at):\n            print(''.join(row))\n\n However, note: the problem says \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\", meaning that we don't output an extra newline after the last row of the grid? \n But the last row of the grid must have a newline? Actually, the problem does not specify, but the sample outputs do have each row on a separate line.\n\n Since we are using print, by default it adds a newline. And that is the desired behavior.\n\n But note: the problem says \"You don't need to output a new line after each test\", meaning that we don't output an extra blank line between test cases? \n Our code for the next test case will start after the last row of the previous test case. So we are not outputting an extra blank line.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n        for row in zip(*at):\n            print(''.join(row))\n\n However, we must consider that the problem has multiple test cases. The outer loop is for _ in range(int(input()).\n\n But note: the problem says the input of test cases. We are reading t test cases.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is the above print.\n\n But wait: what if we have multiple test cases? The above code will output the grid for the current test case. Then the next test case will be processed.\n\n So that's correct.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n We are given a string s of length n (for each test case) and we must decide if it is possible to form the picture using the stamp.\n\n The stamp covers two adjacent cells and colors them as BR or RB. We can use the stamp multiple times on the same cell. The entire stamp must be within the grid.\n\n Important: the initial state is all white (W). We can only change the color by stamping.\n\n Observations:\n\n 1. The stamp always changes two adjacent cells at a time. Therefore, if there is an isolated non-white cell (i.e., a non-white cell that has no non-white neighbor) then it is impossible? Not exactly: because we can stamp overlapping.\n\n 2. Note that the stamping operation is reversible? Actually, we can think of the process as building the picture from white. However, note that the stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell, so the color of a cell can be changed multiple times.\n\n 3. We note that the entire picture must be partitioned into segments of consecutive non-white cells? Actually, white cells are fixed? But note: we can stamp on white cells to color them, and then stamp again to change the color? However, the stamp always colors two adjacent cells.\n\n 4. The key is to note that the stamping operation is linear? Actually, we can model the problem as a graph or by using dynamic programming.\n\n However, note the constraints: the total n over test cases is 10^5. So we need an O(n) solution per test case.\n\n Insight:\n\n  Consider the following:\n\n  - The stamp always changes two adjacent cells: one to R and one to B. Therefore, the entire process must preserve that the number of R and B in the entire picture must be balanced? Not exactly: because we can stamp the same cell multiple times.\n\n  But note: each stamping operation adds one R and one B. However, if we stamp a cell multiple times, we can change the color. For example, if we stamp a cell that was previously R, we might change it to B and then again to R? Actually, the stamping operation always sets the two cells to specific colors: either BR or RB.\n\n  However, note that the operation is not additive. It sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we stamp a segment multiple times, the last stamp that covers a cell determines its color.\n\n  Alternate approach:\n\n  We can break the string into contiguous segments of non-white cells. Because white cells cannot be changed once they are left white? Actually, we can only change a cell if we stamp it. But if we never stamp on a white cell, it remains white. And if we do stamp on a white cell, then we must stamp with the stamp covering two adjacent cells (so at least two consecutive non-white cells must appear).\n\n  Therefore, any white cell that is adjacent to a non-white cell must be part of a stamp that covers both? Actually, the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So if we have a non-white cell, then it must have been stamped at least once. And if it is isolated (with white neighbors) then it must have been stamped in a pair that included a neighbor? But if the neighbor is white, then that neighbor was never stamped? Then how did the non-white cell become non-white? Because the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. So we cannot have an isolated non-white cell.\n\n  Therefore, the non-white cells must appear in contiguous segments of at least two? Actually, no: because we can have overlapping stamps. For example, we can have a segment of three non-white cells: \n      WWW -> W (stamp on the last two) -> W RB -> then stamp on the first two: BR B -> so we get BRB.\n\n  But note: we can also have a segment of one non-white? The problem says: \n      \"The stamp must completely fit on the given n cells\" meaning that we cannot stamp a single cell. Therefore, we cannot have a single non-white cell? \n\n  However, consider: \n      Example: n=1: then we cannot use the stamp at all. So the only possible picture is \"W\". \n      Example: n=2: then we can have \"BR\", \"RB\", but not \"BB\" or \"RR\" because the stamp always produces one R and one B.\n\n  Therefore, in a contiguous segment of non-white cells (with white boundaries or ends of the array), we must have:\n\n      - The segment must have at least two cells? Actually, no: because we can have a segment of one? But wait: we cannot stamp a single cell. So if we have a segment of one non-white, then how did that cell become non-white? It must have been stamped with a stamp that covered two adjacent cells. But if the adjacent cell is white, then that adjacent cell would have been turned into a color? \n\n  Actually, if we have a segment of one non-white, then that cell must have been stamped with a stamp that covered that cell and an adjacent cell. But then the adjacent cell would have been colored too. Therefore, we cannot have a segment of one non-white.\n\n  So the non-white cells must form contiguous segments of at least two? \n\n  However, consider the example: \n      n=3: we can have \"BRB\", \"RBR\", \"BRR\", etc.? \n\n  But note: the example in the problem: \n      \"B R B B W\" -> which has a segment of three non-white and then one white? and then one non-white? Actually, no: the last is white. So the segment is of length 4? Actually, the example is \"BRBBW\", which has a segment of 4 non-white? \n\n  Actually, the example in the problem: \n      \"B R B B W\" -> the last is white, so the segment is the first four.\n\n  But the problem also has: \n      \"For the fifth test case: WWW -> W RB -> BRB\" -> which is a segment of three.\n\n  And the sixth: WWW -> W RB -> RB B -> which becomes RBB? \n\n  So we can have segments of any length? But note: we cannot have a segment of one non-white.\n\n  Therefore, we must have that every contiguous segment of non-white cells must have at least two cells? \n\n  However, what about a segment of two? \n      We can have: \n          WW -> stamp: becomes BR or RB -> so that's valid.\n\n  But what about a segment of one? \n      It is impossible.\n\n  Also, note: what about the entire string? \n      Example: n=1: if the string is \"W\", that's valid. If it is \"R\" or \"B\", then invalid.\n\n  Now, what about the colors? \n\n  In a contiguous segment of non-white cells, we can assign the colors arbitrarily? \n\n  Actually, note: the stamping operation always sets two adjacent cells to be one R and one B. Therefore, the entire segment must have an equal number of R and B? \n\n  But consider: \n      We can stamp multiple times. For example, we can have:\n          WW -> stamp: becomes BR -> then stamp again on the same two: becomes RB -> then again BR, etc. \n      But note: the last stamp operation determines the color.\n\n      Also, we can stamp overlapping. For example, three cells: \n          WWW -> stamp the first two: BR W -> then stamp the last two: BR (then the last two become RB) -> so we get B (from the first stamp) and then the second cell was first R then stamped again to become B? and the third becomes B? \n\n      Actually, the second stamp: \n          The second stamp covers the second and third: \n             originally: second cell is R, third is W.\n             stamping with the stamp: we can choose either RB or BR. \n             If we choose BR: then the second becomes B and the third becomes R -> so we get B B R? \n             If we choose RB: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B -> so we get B R B.\n\n      So we can get different colorings.\n\n  How to check the coloring?\n\n  Insight from known solutions: \n      We can break the string by 'W' and check each contiguous non-white segment.\n\n      Conditions for a contiguous segment (say of length L) to be valid:\n        1. L must be at least 2? Actually, we saw that a segment of length 1 is impossible. But what about length 0? skip.\n        2. The segment must not have all the same color? Actually, no: we can have \"BRB\" which is valid, but we can also have \"BB\" in a segment? \n           How? \n             Example: two cells: \n                 We can only get BR or RB. So we cannot get BB or RR.\n\n           Therefore, in a segment of two, we must have one R and one B.\n\n           For three: \n                 We can have \"BRB\", \"RBR\", \"BRR\" (if we do: \n                    WWW -> stamp the last two: W becomes RB -> then stamp the first two: if we use BR then we get B (for the first) and R (for the second) but then the second was already R? so we get B R B? \n                 Actually, we cannot get \"BRR\" for the entire three? \n\n           How to get \"BRR\"? \n                 Step1: stamp the middle and last: \n                    WWW -> becomes W and then the last two become RB -> so we get W, R, B -> then we stamp the first two: \n                    We stamp the first (W) and second (R): we can choose either BR or RB. \n                    If we choose BR: then the first becomes B, the second becomes R -> so we get B, R, B -> not BRR.\n                    If we choose RB: then the first becomes R, the second becomes B -> so we get R, B, B -> which is RBB.\n\n           How to get BRR? \n                 Step1: stamp the first two: \n                    WWW -> becomes BR W -> then stamp the last two: \n                         The last two are W and W -> we stamp and get (say) RB -> so we get BR RB -> but wait, the second cell is R and the third becomes B? so we get B, R, B -> not BRR.\n\n           Alternatively: \n                 Step1: stamp the first two: BR W -> then stamp the second and third: \n                         The second is R and the third is W: \n                         We can choose: \n                            if we use BR: then the second becomes B and the third becomes R -> so we get B, B, R -> that's BBR.\n                            if we use RB: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B -> so we get B, R, B.\n\n           So we can get BBR? which is two B's and one R? \n\n           But note: the problem says the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. And we can do overlapping arbitrarily.\n\n           However, we cannot get two adjacent R's? \n\n           Actually, we can: \n                 Consider: \n                    Step1: stamp positions 1 and 2: \n                         WW -> becomes (say) BR -> now we have B R W.\n                    Step2: stamp positions 2 and 3: \n                         We stamp R and W: \n                         We can choose: \n                            if we choose RB: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B -> so we get B R B -> not two R's.\n                            if we choose BR: then the second becomes B and the third becomes R -> so we get B B R -> no two R's.\n\n           How to get two R's adjacent? \n\n           Actually, we can do:\n                 Start: WWW\n                 Step1: stamp positions 2 and 3: becomes W and then RB -> so we have W, R, B.\n                 Step2: stamp positions 1 and 2: \n                         We stamp W and R: \n                         We choose: \n                            if we choose RB: then the first becomes R and the second becomes B -> so we get R, B, B -> no two R's.\n                            if we choose BR: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R -> so we get B, R, B.\n\n           It seems we cannot get two R's adjacent? \n\n           But wait: what if we stamp the same pair twice? \n                 Example: two cells: \n                    Step1: stamp with BR: becomes B R.\n                    Step2: stamp again with BR: becomes B (from the first stamp) then the stamp sets the two to BR again: so the first becomes B (if we use BR: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R) -> same as before? \n                 Or if we use RB the second time: \n                    Then the two cells become R and then B? so we get R B.\n\n           So we can change the two cells arbitrarily? But note: we can only set the two cells to either BR or RB. So we can never have two R's or two B's in a two-cell segment.\n\n           Therefore, in a two-cell segment, we must have one R and one B.\n\n           For a segment of three: \n                 We can have: \n                    BBB -> impossible? \n                    RRR -> impossible?\n                    BRB -> possible? \n                    RBR -> possible?\n                    BBR -> possible? \n                    etc.\n\n           How about BBR? \n                 We saw above that we can get BBR? \n                 Example: \n                    WWW -> stamp the first two with BR: becomes B R W -> then stamp the last two with BR: becomes B R becomes B, then the last two: the second is R and the third is W: \n                         stamping the second and third with BR: the second becomes B and the third becomes R -> so we get B, B, R.\n\n           So we can get BBR. \n\n           But note: the entire segment must have at least one R and one B? Actually, no: we can have all B? \n                 Example: two cells: we cannot have BB.\n\n           However, for three cells: \n                 We can have BBB? \n                    How? \n                    Step1: stamp the first two: BR -> then stamp the first two again with RB: then we get RB -> so the first becomes R and the second becomes B -> then we stamp the first two again with BR: then first becomes B and second becomes R -> we cannot get BBB.\n\n           Actually, we can never have three B's? \n                 Because each stamping operation that covers a cell sets it to either R or B. But note: we can cover a cell multiple times. \n                 However, the stamp always sets one cell to R and the other to B. So the entire history: the number of times a cell is set to R and B must be considered? \n\n           Alternate invariant: \n                 Consider the positions: \n                    Let the positions be 0-indexed.\n                    Each stamping operation on positions i and i+1: \n                         It adds 1 to the count of R at one of the two and 1 to the count of B at the other? \n                    Actually, it sets the color, but we can think of the net effect modulo 2? \n\n           However, the operation is not linear because it sets the color arbitrarily? \n\n           Known solution: \n                 We can break the string by 'W' and check each contiguous segment of non-W.\n\n                 Conditions for a segment:\n                    - The segment must have at least one cell? Actually, we skip empty segments.\n                    - The segment must have at least two cells? Actually, no: we can have a segment of one? But we argued that a segment of one is impossible.\n\n                 But note: the problem has examples: \n                    \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                 The second test case: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> valid? \n                 The third: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> invalid? \n                 The fourth: n=3, s=\"RBR\" -> valid? \n\n                 Actually, the problem says: \n                    \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                 But wait: the second test case: n=2, s=\"RB\" -> we can do: stamp once -> so it is valid? \n                 The problem says: \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\" meaning that we cannot stamp a single cell? But we can stamp the entire two cells? \n\n                 Actually, the problem says: \"it is not possible to stamp a single cell\", meaning that the stamp must cover two cells, so we cannot change a single cell independently. But we can change two cells at a time.\n\n                 The examples that are impossible: \n                    The second test case: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> impossible? \n                    The third: n=3, s=\"RRR\" -> impossible? \n                    The fourth: n=3, s=\"R\" -> wait, but the string length is 3? \n\n                 The problem says: \n                    \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1\u2264n\u226410^5) \u2014 the length of the picture. The second line of each test case contains a string s\"\n\n                 And the examples: \n                    \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                 So the second test case: n=2, s=\"RR\" -> NO.\n                 Third: n=3, s=\"RRR\" -> NO.\n                 Fourth: n=3, s=\"R\" -> but wait, the string is of length 3? and it is \"R\"? -> that would be \"R\" and then two more? Actually, the problem says: \n                    \"The second line of each test case contains a string s\" of length n.\n\n                 So the fourth test case: n=3, s=\"R\" -> but that string is of length 1? -> no, it must be of length 3. \n\n                 Actually, the problem says: \n                    \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\"\n\n                 And the sample input is not provided. But the known examples:\n\n                 After checking known problems: \n                    This is problem B from Codeforces Round #734 (Div. 3). \n\n                 Known solution: \n                    We break the string by 'W'. For each segment (which is a contiguous non-W segment), we check:\n                      - If the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n                      - Otherwise, we check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? \n                         Actually, no: because we can have a segment of two: \"RR\" is invalid, but \"RB\" is valid.\n\n                 But note: we can have a segment of two that is \"RR\" -> invalid, \"BB\" -> invalid, \"RB\" -> valid, \"BR\" -> valid.\n\n                 How about a segment of three: \n                    \"RRR\" -> invalid? \n                    \"RBR\" -> valid? \n                    \"BBB\" -> invalid.\n\n                 So the condition: \n                    The segment must have at least one R and at least one B? \n                    But that would make \"R\" (in a segment of one) invalid (which is correct) and \"RR\" (segment of two) invalid? because it has no B? -> that matches.\n\n                 However, what about \"RB\" -> has one R and one B -> valid.\n                 \"RBR\" -> has two R's and one B -> has at least one R and one B -> valid.\n\n                 Therefore, the condition for a contiguous non-W segment is:\n                    - The segment must not be of length 1.\n                    - The segment must contain at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'.\n\n                 But note: what if the segment is empty? we skip.\n\n                 Then we can do:\n\n                    for each test case:\n                      n = int(input().strip())\n                      s = input().strip()\n\n                      # split s by 'W' to get segments\n                      segments = s.split('W')\n\n                      valid = True\n                      for seg in segments:\n                          if seg == '': \n                              continue\n                          if len(seg) == 1:\n                              valid = False\n                              break\n                          # if the segment has at least two, check if it has both R and B?\n                          if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                              valid = False\n                              break\n\n                      print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n                 However, note: the total length of all segments over test cases is at most 10^5? because the sum of n over test cases is 10^5.\n\n                 But wait: what if the string is \"RWR\"? \n                    Then we get two segments: ['R', 'R'] -> both are of length 1 -> invalid.\n\n                 What if the string is \"RWBR\"? \n                    Then segments: ['R', 'BR'] -> \n                         segment1: \"R\" -> invalid.\n\n                 This matches: we cannot have an isolated non-white.\n\n                 But what about the example: \n                    Example 5: \"BRB\" -> valid? \n                         segment: if there's no W in the middle? then the entire string is one segment: \"BRB\" -> length>=2 and has both R and B -> valid.\n\n                 Example 6: \"RBB\" -> segment: \"RBB\" -> has both R and B -> valid.\n\n                 Example 7: \"W\" -> segment: [''] -> skip -> valid.\n\n                 However, the problem says: \n                    Example 7: \"don't need to use the stamp at all\" -> so the string is all white? -> valid.\n\n                 But what about: \n                    n=1: \n                       s = \"R\" -> segment: ['R'] -> invalid -> NO -> correct because we cannot stamp a single cell.\n\n                 But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, and the sum of n is 10^5. So we can do the split and then iterate over segments.\n\n                 However, note: the input reading in program2.py is:\n\n                    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n                 This reads: \n                    [*open(0)] is all lines from stdin.\n                    [2::2] means starting from index 2 (the third line) and then every two lines. \n                    Why? \n                         The first line is t.\n                         Then for each test case: \n                             first line: n\n                             second line: the string s.\n\n                    So the test case strings are at indices 2, 4, 6, ... \n\n                 Therefore, the variable s in the loop is the string for the test case (including the newline). We should strip.\n\n                 So the code for program2.py:\n\n                    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                        s = s.strip()\n                        n = len(s)   # but note: the first line of the test case is n, and the second line is s. However, we have the string s, and we know n = len(s) because the problem says the string has length n. But the input n might be different? \n\n                 Actually, the problem says: \n                    \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1\u2264n\u226410^5) \u2014 the length of the picture. The second line of each test case contains a string s\"\n\n                 So the string s has length n. Therefore, we can use n = len(s).\n\n                 But note: the input n might be provided, but we don't need it because we have the string.\n\n                 So we can do:\n\n                    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                        s = s.strip()\n                        segs = s.split('W')\n                        valid = True\n                        for seg in segs:\n                            if seg == '':\n                                continue\n                            if len(seg)==1:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n\n                        print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n                 However, note: what if the segment has no R? then we break. Similarly for no B.\n\n                 But what if the segment has both? then we continue.\n\n                 This matches.\n\n                 However, let's test with the examples:\n\n                    Example 1: \"BRB\" -> one segment: \"BRB\" -> valid -> YES.\n                    Example 2: \"RR\" -> segment: \"RR\" -> no B -> invalid -> NO.\n                    Example 3: \"RRR\" -> segment: \"RRR\" -> no B -> invalid -> NO.\n                    Example 4: \"R\" -> segment: \"R\" -> invalid -> NO.\n                    Example 5: \"BRB\" -> YES.\n                    Example 6: \"RBB\" -> segment: \"RBB\" -> has R and B -> YES.\n                    Example 7: \"W\" -> no non-empty segment -> YES.\n\n                 But the problem says:\n                    Example 5: \"BRB\" -> YES.\n                    Example 6: \"RBB\" -> actually the example in the problem for the sixth test case: \n                         \"WWW -> W RB -> RB B -> which becomes RBB\" -> so the result is \"RBB\", which is a segment of three. \n                         Our code: segment = \"RBB\" -> has R and B -> YES.\n\n                 However, note: the example in the problem for the sixth test case: \n                    The example says: \n                         WWW -> W RB -> then stamp the first two: becomes RB B -> so the result is \"RBB\". \n\n                 But wait: the example says: \n                    \"For the sixth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> RBB\"\n\n                 Actually, the example: \n                    Step1: WWW -> stamp the last two: so we get W and then the last two become RB -> so we have W, R, B -> then they say: \n                    then stamp the first two: \n                         They say: becomes RBB? \n                         How? \n                         Stamping the first two: \n                            The first is W and the second is R: \n                            If we use the stamp as RB: then the first becomes R and the second becomes B -> so we get R, B, B -> which is RBB.\n\n                 So the result is \"RBB\", which is a string of three non-white? \n\n                 But note: the entire string is non-white? Actually, no: the first two become non-white and the third was already non-white? \n\n                 Actually, the entire string becomes non-white: RBB.\n\n                 So our code: \n                    s = \"RBB\" -> split by 'W' -> ['RBB'] -> valid.\n\n                 However, what about a mixed example: \n                    s = \"RWWB\" -> \n                         segments: split by 'W' -> ['R','','B'] -> \n                         segment1: 'R' -> invalid.\n\n                 So we output NO.\n\n                 But is that correct? \n                    We have two non-white cells: the first and the last. They are separated by white. \n                    How to get the first cell to be R and the last to be B? \n                         We can stamp the first two? but the first two are R and W: \n                            We can stamp the first two: \n                                Then the first becomes (if we use RB) R and the second becomes B? -> but then the second becomes B, which is non-white? \n                         Then we have: R B W -> then we stamp the last two? \n                                The last two are B (from the second cell) and W? \n                                Then we stamp: the second and third: \n                                    We can set to either BR or RB: \n                                    If we set to BR: then the second becomes B and the third becomes R -> so we get R, B, R -> not RWWB.\n\n                         Alternatively, we can stamp the last two first: \n                            Start: WWWW -> \n                            Stamp the last two: set to (say) RB -> so we get WW RB -> then stamp the first two: \n                                set to RB: then first becomes R, second becomes B -> so we get R, B, R, B -> not RWWB.\n\n                 Actually, we cannot have two non-white cells separated by white? because the stamp must cover two adjacent cells. We cannot jump over the white? \n\n                 Therefore, the non-white cells must be contiguous? \n\n                 But note: we can have non contiguous? \n                    Example: \n                         n=4: \n                         We want: R W W B -> \n                         How? \n                            Step1: stamp the first two: \n                                becomes R B W W -> \n                            Step2: stamp the last two: \n                                becomes R B W B? -> no, we get R B and then the last two become (say) RB -> so we get R B W R B? -> wait, we have 4 cells: \n                                    After step1: [R, B, W, W]\n                                    Step2: stamp the last two: set to RB -> so we get [R, B, R, B] -> not RWWB.\n\n                 How about: \n                    Step1: stamp the first two: set to RB -> [R, B, W, W]\n                    Step2: stamp the second and third: \n                            The second is B and the third is W: \n                            set to (say) BR: then the second becomes B (stays) and the third becomes R? -> [R, B, R, W] -> then stamp the third and fourth: \n                            set to RB: then the third becomes R and the fourth becomes B -> [R, B, R, B] -> not RWWB.\n\n                 It seems we cannot have two non-white cells separated by white? \n\n                 Therefore, the non-white cells must be contiguous? \n\n                 Actually, the stamping operation always covers two adjacent cells. So if we have two non-white cells that are not adjacent, then we must have colored the cells in between? \n\n                 Therefore, the non-white cells must form contiguous segments? \n\n                 So our splitting by 'W' is correct: we get the contiguous segments of non-white.\n\n                 Therefore, the solution for program2.py is as above.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, and we are splitting and then iterating over segments. The total length of all strings is 10^5, so it is efficient.\n\n  But note: the split function might create many small segments? but the total length is the same.\n\n  Therefore, we write:\n\n      program1.py: \n          missing code: \n              for row in zip(*at):\n                  print(''.join(row))\n\n      program2.py: \n          missing code: \n              for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                  s = s.strip()\n                  segs = s.split('W')\n                  valid = True\n                  for seg in segs:\n                      if seg == '':\n                          continue\n                      if len(seg)==1:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                      if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                  print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, but the input t can be up to 10000? \n      However, the constraint says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so the total length of all strings s is <= 10^5.\n\n  Therefore, we are safe.\n\n  However, note: the input reading in program2.py: \n        [*open(0)] reads all lines at once. The total number of lines is 1 + 2*t (because each test case has two lines). \n        And the total length of the lines is: \n            The first line: t (a number, small)\n            Then for each test case: \n                first line: n (a string of digits, at most 6 digits per test case? because n<=10^5 -> 6 digits)\n                second line: a string of length n.\n\n        The total length of the input is: \n            length(first line) + sum_{test cases} (length(n as string) + n + 1)   [because each line has a newline?]\n\n        But the constraint says the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so the total input size is about 10^5 + (number of test cases)*(length of the n string) + 1.\n\n        The number of test cases t <= 10000, but the sum of n is 10^5, so the maximum number of test cases is 100000? but the sum of n is 10^5, so the maximum number of test cases is 10^5? but t is at most 10000? \n\n        Actually, the constraint: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so the total length of the second lines is 10^5. The first lines (the n's) are at most 10000*6 = 60000, which is acceptable.\n\n        But the problem says: the total n (the length of the strings) is 10^5, so the total input size is about 10^5 + 10000* (length of the string for n) + 1, which is about 10^5 + 10000*6 = 160000, which is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, we output the missing code as:\n\n      program1: the string: \n          \"for row in zip(*at):\\n        print(''.join(row))\"\n\n      But note: the existing code has 4 spaces for the for loop and 6 spaces for the body? \n\n      The existing code:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are replacing the TODO with two lines: \n          for row in zip(*at):\n              print(''.join(row))\n\n      But the indentation: the existing for loop is indented by 4 spaces? and the body should be 8? Actually, the code we are given:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The TODO line is indented by 2 more? so 6? \n\n      But in the provided code, the for loop is at 4 spaces and the body is at 6? \n\n      We'll write the body at 6 spaces.\n\n      Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n              print(''.join(row))\n\n      with 4 spaces for the for and 6 for the print? \n\n      Actually, the code we are given:\n\n          I=lambda:map(int,input().split())\n          for _ in range(int(input())):\n              n,m=I()\n              a=[input() for _ in range(n)]\n\n              at=[''.join(col).split('o') for col in zip(*a)]\n              f=lambda s:''.join(sorted(s,reverse=True))\n              at=['o'.join(map(f, col)) for col in at]\n\n              for row in zip(*at):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The TODO is at 6 spaces. So we replace the TODO with:\n\n                print(''.join(row))\n\n      But note: we are in a loop for test cases, and we are about to output the grid for the current test case.\n\n      However, we must output the grid for the current test case. The next test case will then be read.\n\n      So the code for program1.py is:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n              print(''.join(row))\n\n      But we must write it with the same indentation: 6 spaces.\n\n  For program2.py, we are replacing the entire TODO: \n\n      The existing code: \n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We need to write the body of the for loop. The body should be indented.\n\n      We write:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          segs = s.split('W')\n          valid = True\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '':\n                  continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n          print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n      But note: the variable s in the loop is a line from the input. We are iterating over the test case strings.\n\n      However, the existing code: \n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n      So we are iterating over the lines that are the second line of each test case.\n\n      We must be cautious: the string s might have a newline at the end, so we strip.\n\n      Then we split by 'W'. Then we check each segment.\n\n      Then we print the answer.\n\n      But note: the problem says to output t lines, one for each test case.\n\n      This code will output one line per test case.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \"print(''.join(row))\" but note: we are in a for loop that iterates over rows. We must output each row.\n\n      Actually, the entire block for program1 is:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n              print(''.join(row))\n\n      But we must write it with the same indentation.\n\n      The existing code for program1 has:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We replace the TODO line with two lines? Actually, we replace the TODO line with a print statement.\n\n      Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          for row in zip(*at): print(''.join(row))\n\n      But that would be one line? but the existing code has the for loop and then a comment. We are replacing the comment and the next line? Actually, the TODO is a comment. We can remove it and put the print.\n\n      But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n      The TODO is a single line? but we are replacing it with a single line? \n\n      Actually, the TODO is:\n\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We replace that with:\n\n          print(''.join(row))\n\n      But note: the for loop body must be indented. The existing code has the for loop and then a line with a comment. We are replacing that one line with one line of code.\n\n      However, the body of the for loop is currently one line (the comment). We are replacing that one line with one line: the print.\n\n      So the missing code for program1 is:\n\n          print(''.join(row))\n\n      But wait: the existing code has:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are replacing the line with the comment with:\n\n          print(''.join(row))\n\n      And the indentation level is the same.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n      So for program1, we output the string: \"print(''.join(row))\"\n\n      But note: the existing code has a for loop that is not complete: the body is missing. We are providing the body.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". In program1, the missing block is the body of the for loop, which is one line.\n\n      For program2, the entire body of the for loop is missing? The existing code is:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      This is one line. We are to replace the TODO with a block of code? \n\n      We can write:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          segs = s.split('W')\n          valid = True\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '':\n                  continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n          print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n      But note: the existing line ends with a comment. We are replacing the comment with a block? Actually, we are replacing the entire line? \n\n      The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to complete the code. The TODO is at the end of the for loop header. We need to write the body.\n\n      We can write the body as a multi-line block. The indentation: the body of the for loop should be indented.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2 is the entire block above, but we must write it as a string that can be inserted at the TODO.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n      For program2, the missing code is the body of the for loop. But note: the existing code has the for loop header. We are only replacing the TODO with the body? \n\n      Actually, the existing code has:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are to replace the comment with the body? But the body must be indented. We can write:\n\n          \\n    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n      But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output in the json.\n\n      Alternatively, we can write the entire block as a string with newlines and tabs? but the problem does not specify the indentation level.\n\n      The existing code in program2 has no indentation? Actually, the entire program is:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      So we are to write the body with 4 spaces per level? \n\n      But the problem does not specify. However, the program1 code uses 4 spaces for the outer loop and 6 for the inner.\n\n      For consistency, we use 4 spaces for the outer and then 4 more for the inner.\n\n      However, the existing for loop in program2 is at the top level? \n\n      Actually, the entire program2 is:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]: ... \n\n      So the body of the for loop should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n      Then the inner for loop (for seg in segs) should be indented by 8, and its body by 12.\n\n      But that might be too deep. Alternatively, we can use 2 or 4.\n\n      Since the problem does not specify, we use 4 spaces for the first indent and then 4 for the next.\n\n      So:\n\n          s = s.strip()   -> 4 spaces\n          segs = ...      -> 4\n          valid = ...     -> 4\n          for seg in segs: -> 4\n              if ...:     -> 8\n              ...         -> 12? \n\n      Actually, we can write:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              segs = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for seg in segs:\n                  if seg == '':\n                      continue\n                  if len(seg)==1:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n                  if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n      But the problem says: we are only to output the missing code. The missing code for program2 is the entire block that is the body of the for loop.\n\n      Therefore, we output:\n\n          program1: \"print(''.join(row))\"   [with the same indentation as the TODO: 6 spaces? but we are replacing the TODO line, so we write the line at the same indentation level: 6 spaces?]\n\n      However, the existing code in program1 has:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The TODO line is at 6 spaces. We replace it with:\n\n            print(''.join(row))\n\n      So the string for program1 is: \"print(''.join(row))\"\n\n      For program2, the missing code is the entire body of the for loop, which is:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          segs = s.split('W')\n          valid = True\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '':\n                  continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n          print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n      But we must write it as a string that can be inserted at the TODO. However, the TODO is at the end of the for loop header. We are replacing the comment with a newline and then the body? \n\n      Actually, the existing code is:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are replacing the comment with a newline and then the body? \n\n      But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the block of code that is missing.\n\n      We output the block as a string with newlines.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" meaning we output the code as a string.\n\n      We are to return a json: \n          {\"program1\": \"completion1\", \"program2\": \"completion2\"}\n\n      For program1, the completion is: \"print(''.join(row))\"\n\n      For program2, the completion is: \n          \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n      But note: the indentation for program2: the entire block is the body of the for loop, so it should be indented one level. We use 4 spaces for the first level.\n\n      However, the existing for loop in program2 is at the top level. So the body should be indented. We use 4 spaces.\n\n      The inner for loop (for seg in segs) is then indented 4 more? so 8? and the if statements inside that for loop are 8? and the body of the if is 12? \n\n      But that is acceptable.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use:\n\n          program2: \n            \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n      But the inner for loop body: we use 4 spaces for the inner block? \n\n      Actually, we can write:\n\n          for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              s = s.strip()\n              segs = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for seg in segs:\n                  if seg == '': \n                      continue\n                  if len(seg)==1:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n                  if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n      The inner for loop body: the if statements are at 8 spaces (two indents) and the body of the if (like continue, break) are at 12? \n\n      But we can write the body of the if on the same line? \n\n      Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '': continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              ...\n\n      But that is less readable.\n\n      We'll write with proper indentation: 4 spaces per level.\n\n      So:\n\n          level0: for s in ...: \n          level1: 4 spaces: s = ...\n          level1: 4 spaces: segs = ...\n          level1: 4 spaces: valid = ...\n          level1: 4 spaces: for seg in segs:\n          level2: 8 spaces: if seg == '': \n          level3: 12 spaces: continue   -> but we can avoid the block for the continue by putting it on the same line? \n          However, we can write:\n\n              if seg == '': continue\n\n          at 8 spaces.\n\n          Similarly, we can write:\n\n              if len(seg)==1: \n                  valid = False\n                  break\n\n          at 8 spaces for the if, and 12 for the break? \n\n      But the problem does not specify. We'll write:\n\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '': continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n\n      Then the body of the inner for loop is 8 spaces for the if statements, and 12 for the break and assignment? \n\n      Actually, we can write the break on the same line? \n\n      Alternatively, we can write:\n\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '': \n                  continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n\n      This is clear.\n\n      The indentation:\n\n          level1: 4 spaces: for seg in segs:\n          level2: 8 spaces: if ...: \n          level3: 12 spaces: continue\n          level2: 8 spaces: if ...: \n          level3: 12 spaces: valid = ...; break   -> but we have two lines? \n\n      We can write:\n\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '': \n                  continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n\n      So the code for program2 is:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          segs = s.split('W')\n          valid = True\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '': \n                  continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n          print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n      And we indent each line by 4 spaces relative to the for loop header.\n\n      But the for loop header is already at the top level? and we are replacing the TODO with a block that is the body of the for loop.\n\n      Therefore, the entire block above is the body, and we indent each line of the body by 4 spaces.\n\n      So the string for program2 is:\n\n          \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '': \\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n      But note: the inner if bodies are indented by 4 more spaces (so 8 in total for the body). \n\n      We use 4 spaces for the first indent (the body of the outer for) and then 4 more for the inner for body, and then 4 more for the inner if bodies? \n\n      Actually, we can use:\n\n          program2_body = \"\"\"\n    s = s.strip()\n    segs = s.split('W')\n    valid = True\n    for seg in segs:\n        if seg == '': \n            continue\n        if len(seg)==1:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\"\"\"\n\n      But the first line of the body is at 4 spaces, then the for seg in segs: is at 4, then the ifs are at 8, and the continue/break are at 12.\n\n      However, we can write the inner for body with 4 spaces per indent? \n\n      Alternatively, we can write without the extra indent for the inner for body? \n\n      But the problem does not specify. We'll use 4 spaces per indent level.\n\n      Level 1: 4 spaces for the entire body of the outer for.\n      Level 2: 8 spaces for the body of the inner for (the for seg in segs)\n      Level 3: 12 spaces for the body of the ifs.\n\n      But that is acceptable.\n\n      However, to save space, we can write the inner for body without the extra newlines? \n\n      But the problem does not require minimal code.\n\n      We'll write as above.\n\n  Final output:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"print(''.join(row))\", \n        \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program2 string has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? and then the inner parts have more. \n\n  However, the entire block is the body of the outer for loop, so it should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop header.\n\n  The for loop header is:\n\n      for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n  Then the body is:\n\n        s = s.strip()\n        segs = s.split('W')\n        ... \n\n  So the first line of the body is indented 4 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, we write the string for program2 with each line starting with 4 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the first line of the body is \"s = s.strip()\", and we want that to be indented 4 spaces. So the string for program2 is:\n\n      \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    ... \"\n\n  But note: the inner for loop: the line \"for seg in segs:\" is also at 4 spaces? but that is the same level as the previous lines. Then the body of that for loop is 8 spaces.\n\n  We write:\n\n      \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n  This means:\n\n      Line1: 4 spaces: \"    s = s.strip()\"\n      Line2: 4 spaces: \"    segs = ...\"\n      Line3: 4 spaces: \"    valid = ...\"\n      Line4: 4 spaces: \"    for seg in segs:\"\n      Line5: 8 spaces: \"        if ...\"\n      Line6: 12 spaces: \"            continue\"\n      Line7: 8 spaces: \"        if ...\"\n      Line8: 12 spaces: \"            valid = ...\"\n      Line9: 12 spaces: \"            break\"\n      ... \n\n  But wait, the inner for loop body must be indented. We use 4 more spaces (so 8 in total) for the inner for body.\n\n  The structure:\n\n      for s in ...:\n          s = ...   (4 spaces)\n          for seg in segs:   (4 spaces)\n          if ...:   (8 spaces)   -> this is the body of the inner for? \n\n  Actually, the body of the inner for must be indented relative to the inner for header. So we use 8 spaces for the inner for body.\n\n  Therefore, the code:\n\n      for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n          s = s.strip()\n          segs = s.split('W')\n          valid = True\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '':\n                  continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n          print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n  How many spaces?\n\n      Line1: 0: for s in ...:\n      Line2: 4: s = ...\n      Line3: 4: segs = ...\n      Line4: 4: valid = ...\n      Line5: 4: for seg in segs:\n      Line6: 8: if ...:\n      Line7: 12: continue\n      Line8: 8: if ...:\n      Line9: 12: valid = ...; break   -> but we have two lines: \n          Line9: 12: valid = False\n          Line10: 12: break\n      Line11: 8: if ...:\n      Line12: 12: valid = ...; break\n      Line13: 4: print(...)\n\n  So the string for program2 is:\n\n      \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n  But note: the inner for body: the if statements are at 8 spaces (one level of 4 added) and the bodies (continue, break, assignment) are at 12 (another 4).\n\n  We write the string with:\n\n      \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n  This has:\n\n      Line1: \"    s = s.strip()\" -> 4 spaces at the beginning? actually, the string starts with 4 spaces.\n\n  But when we insert, the entire block will be:\n\n      for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n          s = s.strip()\n          segs = s.split('W')\n          valid = True\n          for seg in segs:\n              if seg == '':\n                  continue\n              if len(seg)==1:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n              if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                  valid = False\n                  break\n          print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n  Which is correct.\n\n  Therefore, we output the json.\n\n  Note: the program1 part: we are replacing the TODO line with \"print(''.join(row))\", and the existing line has 6 spaces? \n\n  The existing code:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The first line of the for loop is at 4 spaces? and the body line (the TODO) is at 6. We replace the TODO line with:\n\n            print(''.join(row))\n\n  So the string for program1 is: \"print(''.join(row))\", and it will be at 6 spaces.\n\n  But the problem does not require the indentation to be specified? we are just replacing the line.\n\n  We assume the existing indentation level for the body is 6 spaces? \n\n  Alternatively, we can write the program1 completion as:\n\n      \"    print(''.join(row))\"\n\n  with 6 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the existing code has 6 spaces for the body. So we write:\n\n      program1: \"    print(''.join(row))\"\n\n  But wait, the existing code has 6 spaces? \n\n      The code:\n\n          for row in zip(*at):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The for loop is at 4 spaces, and the body is at 6. So the body line should be indented 2 more? \n\n      How many spaces? \n\n          The outer loop: 4 spaces.\n          The inner body: 6 spaces? \n\n      But 6 = 4+2? \n\n      We can write the body as 6 spaces: \n\n          \"  print(''.join(row))\"   -> 2 spaces? \n\n      But the existing body line has 6 spaces? \n\n      Actually, the code we are given:\n\n          I=lambda:map(int,input().split())\n          for _ in range(int(input())):\n              n,m=I()\n              a=[input() for _ in range(n)]\n\n              at=[''.join(col).split('o') for col in zip(*a)]\n              f=lambda s:''.join(sorted(s,reverse=True))\n              at=['o'.join(map(f, col)) for col in at]\n\n              for row in zip(*at):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The last two lines: the for loop is at 4 spaces? \n\n          The entire block after the test case is at 4 spaces? \n\n          Then the for loop: \n              for row in zip(*at): -> 4 spaces? \n              then the body: 6 spaces? \n\n      Actually, the body is at 6 spaces: the comment has 6 spaces.\n\n      So we replace the comment with:\n\n                print(''.join(row))\n\n      So the string for program1 is: \"print(''.join(row))\" but with the same 6 spaces? \n\n      How do we represent 6 spaces? \n\n      We can write the string as: \"  print(''.join(row))\" with two spaces? but that would be 2 spaces, not 6.\n\n      Actually, the existing line has 6 spaces. We are replacing the entire line. We want the new line to have the same indentation.\n\n      Therefore, we write the string for program1 as:\n\n          \"  print(''.join(row))\"   -> but that is 2 spaces? \n\n      We need 6? \n\n      Alternatively, we can count: the outer loop is at 4, then the for loop body is at 6 (which is 4+2). So we use 2 more spaces.\n\n      So the string is: \"  print(''.join(row))\" -> 2 spaces at the beginning.\n\n      But when we insert, the line becomes:\n\n                print(''.join(row))\n\n      which is 6 spaces? \n\n      Actually, the existing line is:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n      which is 6 spaces. We replace it with:\n\n                print(''.join(row))\n\n      So the string we output for program1 is: \"print(''.join(row))\" without the spaces? because the existing indentation is already there? \n\n      But the problem says: we are replacing the TODO line. We are replacing the entire line. The existing line has 6 spaces. We want the new line to have the same 6 spaces and then the code.\n\n      Therefore, we must include the 6 spaces? \n\n      But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing, without the context.\n\n      We are only to output the code that replaces the TODO, not the entire line.\n\n      The TODO is a comment. We are replacing that comment with a print statement. The print statement should be at the same indentation.\n\n      So we output the print statement without the indentation? \n\n      But then how will it be inserted? \n\n      The problem says: we are to output the missing code. The missing code is the body of the for loop, which is the print statement.\n\n      We output: \"print(''.join(row))\"\n\n      And the system will put it at the same indentation level as the TODO.\n\n      Therefore, we do not include the spaces.\n\n  So the final answer:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"print(''.join(row))\",\n        \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program2 string has the entire body, including the indentation.\n\n  We output the json.\n\n  Let me write the program2 string with explicit newlines and tabs? but we use \\n for newlines and we use spaces.\n\n  We write the program2 string as:\n\n      \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if seg == '':\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg)==1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n  This is a string that when printed will have:\n\n      Line1: \"    s = s.strip()\"\n      Line2: \"    segs = s.split('W')\"\n      Line3: \"    valid = True\"\n      Line4: \"    for seg in segs:\"\n      Line5: \"        if seg == '':\"\n      Line6: \"            continue\"\n      Line7: \"        if len(seg)==1:\"\n      Line8: \"            valid = False\"\n      Line9: \"            break\"\n      Line10: \"        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\"\n      Line11: \"            valid = False\"\n      Line12: \"            break\"\n      Line13: \"    print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\"\n\n  This is 13 lines.\n\n  We output the json with these strings.\n\n  Note: the program1 string is one line: \"print(''.join(row))\"\n\n  And program2 is the multi-line string above.\n\n  We return the json."
