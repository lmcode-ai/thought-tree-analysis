We'll define:\n\n          class Fenw:\n              def __init__(self, size):\n                  self.n = size\n                  self.tree = [-10**18] * (self.n+1)   # 1-indexed, size+1\n\n              def update(self, idx, val):\n                  i = idx+1\n                  while i <= self.n:\n                      if val > self.tree[i]:\n                          self.tree[i] = val\n                      i += i & -i\n\n              def query(self, idx):   # query prefix [0, idx] (0-indexed)\n                  if idx < 0:\n                      return -10**18\n                  i = idx+1\n                  res = -10**18\n                  while i:\n                      if self.tree[i] > res:\n                          res = self.tree[i]\n                      i -= i & -i\n                  return res\n\n      Then in the main:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              # compute prefix\n              pref = [0]*(n+1)\n              for i in range(1, n+1):\n                  pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n              # compress pref\n              comp = sorted(set(pref)) comp_map = {x:i for i,x in enumerate(comp)}\n              size = len(comp)\n\n              fenw1 = Fenw(size)\n              fenw2 = Fenw(size) best0 = {}\n\n              dp = [-10**18] * (n+1)\n              dp[0] = 0\n\n              idx0 = comp_map[pref[0]]\n              rev_idx0 = size-1 - idx0\n              fenw1.update(idx0, 0)   # dp[0]-0\n              fenw2.update(rev_idx0, 0) # dp[0]+0\n              best0[pref[0]] = 0\n\n              for i in range(1, n+1):\n                  idx = comp_map[pref[i]]\n                  rev_idx = size-1 - idx\n\n                  cand1 = fenw1.query(idx-1) + i\n                  cand2 = best0.get(pref[i], -10**18)\n                  cand3 = fenw2.query(rev_idx-1) - i\n\n                  dp[i] = max(cand1, cand2, cand3)\n\n                  # update\n                  fenw1.update(idx, dp[i]-i)\n                  fenw2.update(rev_idx, dp[i]+i) if pref[i] in best0:\n                      if dp[i] > best0[pref[i]]:\n                          best0[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n                  else:\n                      best0[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n              print(dp[n])\n\n  But note: the constraints: a_i can be as low as -10^9, and the prefix sums can be huge. But we are compressing per test case. However, the total n is 500000, so the total distinct prefix values per test case is at most n+1, which is <=500001. But the Fenwick tree update and query are O(log(size)), and the total operations per test case is O(n) -> so total time per test case O(n log(n)), and total time over test cases: O( (sum of n) * log(n_i) ) -> the sum of n is 500000, and the maximum n_i for one test case is 500000, so log(n_i) is about 20 -> 500000*20 = 10e6, which is acceptable. But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total operations is 500000 * log(500000) which is about 500000*20 = 10e6. However, we have two Fenwick trees per update -> 2 * 10e6 operations, which is acceptable in Pyton? We hope so. But note: the problem constraints: t up to 500000, but the total n is 500000, so the maximum t is 500000 (if each test case n=1). Then the total distinct prefix values per test case: 2 (for n=1: pref[0] and pref[1]). So the Fenwick trees are small. We'll code accordingly. However, note: the Fenwick tree for the reversed array: we are building a Fenwick tree of size = size (the number of distinct prefix values).",

We maintain a frequency count 'freq' for skipped elements in a.\n\n              While j < n:\n                  if i < n and a[i]==b[j]: then we match, and move both.\n                  else:\n                      if we have b[j] in freq and freq[b[j]]>0, then we use one occurrence of b[j] from the skipped elements, and move j.\n                      else:\n                          if we still have a[i] available, then we skip a[i] (add to freq) and move i.\n\n              If we can match all b, then j==n. This matches the example:\n\n              a = [1,4,2,2,1] -> reversed: [1,2,2,4,1]\n              b = [4,2,2,1,1] -> reversed: [1,1,2,2,4]\n\n              i=0, j=0: a[0]=1, b[0]=1 -> match, i=1, j=1. i=1, j=1: a[1]=2, b[1]=1 -> not match, and freq[1] is 0? -> so we skip a[1]=2: freq[2] becomes 1, i=2.\n              i=2, j=1: a[2]=2, b[1]=1 -> not match, and freq[1] is 0 -> skip a[2]=2: freq[2] becomes 2, i=3.\n              i=3, j=1: a[3]=4, b[1]=1 -> not match, and freq[1] is 0 -> skip a[3]=4: freq[4] becomes 1, i=4. i=4, j=1: a[4]=1, b[1]=1 -> match, i=5, j=2. Now j=2: b[2]=2 -> we check freq: we have freq[2]=2>0 -> use one: freq[2] becomes 1, j=3. j=3: b[3]=2 -> use one: freq[2] becomes 0, j=4.\n              j=4: b[4]=4 -> use one: freq[4] becomes 0, j=5 -> done. So it returns YES. Now the provided code in program2.py is different. We have:\n\n              an=an[::-1]\n              bn=bn[::-1]\n              used={}\n              pa=0\n              prv=None\n              for c in bn:\n                  while c not in (an[pa],prv):\n                      if used.get(an[pa],0)<=0:\n                          # TODO: return False? return False\n                      used[an[pa]]-=1\n                      pa+=1\n                  if c==an[pa]:\n                      pa+=1\n                  else:\n                      used[prv]=used.get(prv,0)+1\n                  prv=c\n\n          This is different.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem of partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values defined by:\n  For a subarray [l, r]: \n      value = (r-l+1) if sum>0, 0 if sum=0, -(r-l+1) if sum<0.\n\nWe note that the problem constraints are high (n up to 500000 per test, but total n over test cases <= 500000) so we need an efficient solution.\n\nThe known solution for this problem uses dynamic programming and a segment tree (or Fenwick tree) for optimization.\n\nLet:\n  dp[i] = maximum total value we can achieve for the prefix ending at i (i.e., considering a[0..i-1] for 0-indexed array)\n\nWe have:\n  dp[0] = 0\n  For i from 1 to n:\n      dp[i] = max_{0<=j<i} { dp[j] + sign(S) * (i - j) } \n        where S = prefix[i] - prefix[j] (the sum of subarray from j to i-1)\n\nBut note: the value for the segment [j, i-1] is:\n        if S>0: then value = (i - j) -> so dp[j] + (i - j)\n        if S=0: then value = 0 -> so dp[j] + 0\n        if S<0: then value = -(i - j) -> so dp[j] - (i - j)\n\nWe can rewrite:\n  dp[i] = max( \n        max_{j: prefix[i] - prefix[j] > 0} { dp[j] + (i - j) },\n        max_{j: prefix[i] - prefix[j] = 0} { dp[j] },\n        max_{j: prefix[i] - prefix[j] < 0} { dp[j] - (i - j) }\n  )\n\nAlternatively, we can express:\n  dp[i] = max( \n        i + max_{j: prefix[j] < prefix[i]} { dp[j] - j },\n        max_{j: prefix[j] = prefix[i]} { dp[j] },\n        -i + max_{j: prefix[j] > prefix[i]} { dp[j] + j }\n  )\n\nBut note: we must consider j from 0 to i.\n\nWe can use a Fenwick tree or segment tree to maintain:\n  For a given prefix value, we want to query:\n      - The maximum value of (dp[j] - j) for all j with prefix[j] < prefix[i]\n      - The maximum value of (dp[j] + j) for all j with prefix[j] > prefix[i]\n  And also we need to store the best dp[j] for prefix[j] = prefix[i].\n\nHowever, note that the prefix values can be very large (and negative) and we have up to 500000 distinct prefix values.\n\nWe can compress the prefix array.\n\nSteps:\n  Precompute the prefix array for the current test case: \n        pref[0] = 0\n        pref[i] = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{i-1}\n\n  Then we want to compress the array of pref[0..n] (for the current test case).\n\n  We maintain:\n      dp[0] = 0.\n\n  We'll use three data structures:\n      - A Fenwick tree (or segment tree) for the condition (pref[j] < pref[i]) to get max (dp[j]-j)\n      - A dictionary (or just update a value for the same prefix) for (pref[j] == pref[i])\n      - A Fenwick tree (or segment tree) for the condition (pref[j] > pref[i]) to get max (dp[j]+j)\n\n  But note: the constraints say that the total n over test cases is <= 500000, so we can do a Fenwick tree for each test case? \n  However, the total n is 500000, but the prefix array for one test case can be up to 500000, and we have multiple test cases, but the total n is bounded by 500000.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5*10^5\".\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      Let T = total n over test cases <= 500000.\n\n      We can process each test case independently, but we must compress the prefix array for that test case.\n\n  Steps for one test case:\n\n      n = given\n      a = list of n integers\n\n      pref = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      Now, we want to compress the array pref[0..n] (size n+1).\n\n      Let comp = sorted(set(pref))\n\n      Then, we can map each prefix value to an index.\n\n      We'll create:\n          tree1: for the condition (pref[j] < pref[i]) -> we want max (dp[j]-j) for j with comp_index[j] < comp_index[i]\n          tree2: for the condition (pref[j] > pref[i]) -> we want max (dp[j]+j) for j with comp_index[j] > comp_index[i]\n\n      And we also maintain a dictionary for the same prefix: best0[value] = max(dp[j] for j with pref[j]=value)\n\n      However, note that we are iterating from j=0 to i, so we update as we go.\n\n      We initialize:\n          dp[0] = 0.\n\n          We have j=0: pref[0]=0.\n\n          We update:\n              tree1: at index of 0, we update with dp[0]-0 = 0.\n              tree2: at index of 0, we update with dp[0]+0 = 0.\n              best0[0] = 0\n\n      Then for i from 1 to n:\n\n          Let idx = index of pref[i] in comp.\n\n          candidate1 = query tree1 for [0, idx-1] -> then candidate1 + i\n          candidate2 = best0.get(pref[i], -10**18)   # because we can have multiple j with same prefix, we take max\n          candidate3 = query tree2 for [idx+1, len(comp)-1] -> then candidate3 - i\n\n          dp[i] = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)\n\n          Then update:\n              tree1: at idx, update with dp[i] - i   (if dp[i]-i is greater than current at idx for tree1? Actually, we are maintaining the maximum for each index. But note: we want the maximum value for each prefix value? Actually, we are storing by the compressed index. So we update the Fenwick tree (or segment tree) at idx with dp[i]-i. Similarly for tree2: update at idx with dp[i]+i.\n\n          Also update best0: best0[pref[i]] = max(best0.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\n      However, note: we are updating the trees and best0 for each i.\n\n      But note: the trees are for j from 0 to i. We are iterating i from 0 to n.\n\n  But wait: the segment tree or Fenwick tree we are using must support point updates and range queries.\n\n  We can use two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) for the two queries.\n\n  However, note: we are updating at the same index for both trees? Actually, we update at the same compressed index for both trees? But the two trees store different values.\n\n  We need:\n      tree1: stores for each compressed index the maximum value of (dp[j]-j) for j that have that prefix.\n      tree2: stores the maximum value of (dp[j]+j) for j that have that prefix.\n\n  How to update:\n      When we compute dp[i], we update:\n          tree1: at position idx, set to max(current value at idx, dp[i]-i)\n          tree2: at position idx, set to max(current value at idx, dp[i]+i)\n\n  But note: we are using Fenwick trees for maximum? Fenwick trees for maximum are not standard (because maximum doesn't have an inverse) but we can do a Fenwick tree that supports point updates and range maximum queries? Actually, we can use a segment tree for maximum.\n\n  However, the constraints: total n (over test cases) is 500000, and each test case we have n+1 points (the prefix array). But the total n (over test cases) is 500000, so we can build a segment tree for each test case? The size of the segment tree for one test case is O(n) and the total n is 500000, so total memory would be O(500000*log(500000)) which is acceptable? But note: we have multiple test cases, but the total n is 500000, so the total number of prefix points is 500000 + (number of test cases). Actually, the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total number of prefix points is 500000 + t (t<=500000) -> worst-case 1000000? Actually, each test case has n+1 prefix points, and the sum of n is 500000, so total prefix points = 500000 + t. Since t (number of test cases) is at most 500000, total prefix points is at most 1000000. But note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5*10^5\", so the total prefix points is 500000 + t, and t (the number of test cases) is the first integer. The first integer t can be up to 500000, but the sum of n is 500000, so the maximum t is 500000? Actually, if each test case has n=1, then t can be 500000. So total prefix points = 500000 (for the n's) + t (the 0's? actually each test case has one extra 0 at the beginning) -> so total prefix points = (n1+1) + (n2+1) + ... = (sum of n) + t = 500000 + t <= 1000000.\n\n  So we can build a segment tree for each test case? But building a segment tree for 1000000 points for each test case? The total number of test cases t is at most 500000? But the total n is 500000, so the maximum t is 500000? Then we would build 500000 segment trees? That would be too heavy.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a Fenwick tree for maximum? But note: Fenwick tree for maximum only supports point updates and prefix/suffix maximum? Actually, we can use:\n\n      For tree1: we want the maximum value in the range [0, idx-1] (which is a prefix). We can maintain a Fenwick tree that supports point updates and prefix maximum.\n\n      For tree2: we want the maximum value in the range [idx+1, end] (which is a suffix). We can maintain a Fenwick tree for the suffix? Or we can reverse the array.\n\n  Actually, for tree2: we can store the values in reverse order? Or we can use a Fenwick tree that supports suffix maximum by building a Fenwick tree for the reversed array? Alternatively, we can use a segment tree that supports range maximum queries. But note: the total number of operations (n per test case) is 500000, and the total n over test cases is 500000, so we can build a segment tree for each test case? But the total number of test cases t can be up to 500000? That would be 500000 segment trees, each of size about 1000000? That would be 500000 * (4 * 1000000) integers? That is 2e9 integers, which is too much.\n\n  We must avoid building a segment tree for each test case.\n\n  Instead, note that the total n (the length of all test cases) is 500000, so the total number of prefix points is 500000 + t (<=1000000). And the total number of test cases t is at most 500000, but we cannot build 500000 segment trees.\n\n  Alternative approach: we can use coordinate compression for each test case and then use a Fenwick tree for maximum (for the prefix) and similarly for the suffix? But we need two Fenwick trees: one for the prefix maximum (for tree1) and one for the suffix maximum (for tree2). \n\n  How to build a Fenwick tree for maximum? We can do:\n\n      We initialize the tree with -infinity.\n\n      update(i, value): \n          while i < size:\n              tree[i] = max(tree[i], value)\n              i = i | (i+1)\n\n      query(i): maximum from 0 to i (inclusive) for the prefix Fenwick tree? Actually, for tree1 we want the maximum in [0, idx-1]. We can do query(idx-1).\n\n      Similarly, for tree2 (suffix) we can build a Fenwick tree that supports [i+1, end]. We can build a Fenwick tree for the reversed array? Or we can use a Fenwick tree that supports suffix by storing the array in reverse order.\n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      Let size = len(comp)\n\n      tree1: Fenwick tree for maximum for the entire array (for indices 0 to size-1) for the condition: we want the maximum (dp[j]-j) for indices j with compressed index <= some value? But we want [0, idx-1]. So we can do:\n\n          candidate1 = tree1.query(idx-1)   # if idx-1 is negative, then skip.\n\n      tree2: we want the maximum in [idx+1, size-1]. We can build a Fenwick tree that supports suffix? Or we can build a Fenwick tree for the reversed array? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use one Fenwick tree for the entire array and then do a range query? But Fenwick tree for maximum doesn't support arbitrary range queries easily? We can do:\n\n          candidate3 = tree2.query_range(idx+1, size-1)   -> but we don't have a Fenwick tree that does that for maximum.\n\n      Instead, we can build two Fenwick trees: one for the prefix and one for the suffix? \n\n      For the suffix, we can build a Fenwick tree that stores the maximum for the suffix: \n\n          We can define an array for the suffix: \n              suf[i] = maximum value in the range [i, size-1]\n\n          But updating a suffix Fenwick tree? Actually, we can use a Fenwick tree that is built for the reversed array? \n\n      Alternatively, we can use a segment tree? But we cannot build a segment tree for each test case because the total test cases might be 500000.\n\n  We must note: the total n (over test cases) is 500000, but the total number of prefix points (which is the size of the Fenwick tree for one test case) is (n+1) for that test case. The total of these sizes is 500000 + t (<=1000000). And the total number of test cases t is at most 500000, but the total operations (update and query) is O(n) per test case, so total operations is 500000. So we can build a Fenwick tree for each test case? The memory for one Fenwick tree is O(size) and the total memory for all Fenwick trees would be the sum of (n_i+1) for each test case, which is 500000 + t (<=1000000). But we have two Fenwick trees per test case: so total memory 2*(500000+t) integers? That is about 2000000 integers, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, the problem: building a Fenwick tree for each test case: we have t test cases, and t can be 500000. The time to build a Fenwick tree: we need to initialize an array of size (size+1) for each test case. The total memory would be the sum of (size_i) for each test case, which is the total prefix points (500000+t) and we have two trees per test case -> 2*(500000+t) integers. Since 500000+t<=1000000, total memory 2000000 integers? But note: each test case has its own Fenwick trees. The total memory is 2 * (total prefix points) = 2*(500000+t) <= 2000000, which is acceptable.\n\n  But the total number of test cases t can be 500000, and each test case we build two Fenwick trees of size (size_i) (which is the number of distinct prefix values? Actually, we compress the prefix array per test case, so the size of the Fenwick tree is the number of distinct prefix values? Actually, we compress to an index from 0 to (size_i-1). But we need the Fenwick tree to have size = size_i. The total memory for all Fenwick trees is the sum over test cases of 2 * (size_i). But note: the total prefix points (the array we compress) is (n_i+1) for test case i, and the distinct size_i is at most (n_i+1). The total of (n_i+1) over test cases is (500000 + t) (since the sum of n_i is 500000, and there are t test cases). So the total memory for Fenwick trees is 2*(500000+t) <= 2000000 integers, which is acceptable.\n\n  Steps for one test case:\n\n      n = ... \n      a = ...\n      pref = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n      comp = sorted(set(pref))\n      comp_map = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(comp)}   # mapping from value to index (0-indexed)\n\n      size = len(comp)\n\n      # Initialize Fenwick trees for maximum (for prefix and suffix) and a dictionary for the same prefix.\n      # We'll create two Fenwick trees: \n      #   fenw1: for the prefix maximum of (dp[j]-j) for the compressed index. We want to query [0, idx-1] -> so we need a Fenwick tree that supports prefix maximum.\n      #   fenw2: for the suffix maximum of (dp[j]+j) for the compressed index. We want to query [idx+1, size-1]. We can build a Fenwick tree that supports suffix? \n      #           Alternatively, we can build a Fenwick tree for the reversed array? \n\n      # How to build Fenwick tree for maximum for the suffix? We can build a Fenwick tree that is indexed from the end? \n      #   Instead, we can use one Fenwick tree for the entire array and then do a range query? But Fenwick tree for maximum doesn't support arbitrary range queries. \n      #   Alternatively, we can build a Fenwick tree for the suffix by storing the array in reverse order? \n\n      # Let's build fenw2 for the entire array for maximum, but we want the maximum from [idx+1, size-1]. We can build a Fenwick tree that is for the reversed array: \n      #   We define an array for the reversed indices: \n      #       index_in_fenw2 = size - 1 - idx\n      #   Then the suffix [idx+1, size-1] in the original array becomes the prefix [0, size-1-idx-1] in the reversed array.\n\n      # But we can avoid that by building a Fenwick tree that supports suffix? Actually, we can do:\n\n      #   We maintain an array T for fenw2 of size (size+1) (0-indexed, indices 0..size-1) and we want to update at index i and query the maximum from i to size-1? \n      #   But Fenwick tree for suffix maximum is not standard. \n\n      # Alternatively, we can use a segment tree? But we don't want to build a segment tree because of the total test cases? \n\n      # Actually, we can use two Fenwick trees: one for the prefix (for the condition <) and one for the suffix (for the condition >) by building a Fenwick tree for the entire array and then for the suffix we can use:\n\n      #   We build a Fenwick tree for the entire array (for the original indices) for maximum, but then we cannot do a suffix query efficiently? \n\n      # Instead, we can build a Fenwick tree for the suffix by storing the array in reverse order? \n\n      # Let's define:\n      #   fenw1: for the original compressed indices (0..size-1) for the values (dp[j]-j). We want to query the prefix [0, idx-1].\n      #   fenw2: we build for the array of (dp[j]+j) but for the reversed compressed indices: \n      #           Let rev_comp = comp[::-1]   -> but we don't need the values, we just need the indices: \n      #           We map an original index i to rev_i = size-1-i.\n      #           Then the condition (pref[j] > pref[i]) becomes (rev_comp_index[j] < rev_comp_index[i])? \n      #           Actually, if we have two values: x and y, then x>y in the original array means that the index of x in the original comp is > the index of y. \n      #           Then in the reversed array: the index of x becomes rev_i = size-1-i, and the index of y becomes rev_j = size-1-j, and then rev_i < rev_j.\n      #           So we can build a Fenwick tree for the reversed indices for the prefix maximum? \n\n      # So for fenw2: \n      #   We will store the values (dp[j]+j) at position rev_j = size-1 - j (where j is the compressed index in the original comp) and then we want to query the prefix [0, rev_i-1] in the reversed array? \n      #   But note: the condition for j: we want j such that the original index j > i (in the compressed array) -> which becomes rev_j = size-1-j < size-1-i = rev_i? \n      #   Actually, we want j such that j (original index) > i -> then rev_j = size-1-j < size-1-i. So we want to query the prefix [0, rev_i-1] in the reversed array? \n\n      # Alternatively, we can avoid reversing by building a Fenwick tree for the original array for the entire range and then do a range query? But Fenwick tree for maximum doesn't support arbitrary range queries. \n\n      # We'll build two Fenwick trees for maximum that support prefix queries: \n      #   fenw1: for the original compressed indices (0-indexed) for the array of (dp[j]-j). We update at index = comp_index, and we query [0, idx-1].\n      #   fenw2: for the reversed compressed indices: we define an array rev_comp_index = size-1 - comp_index. Then we build a Fenwick tree for the array of (dp[j]+j) at index = rev_comp_index. Then we want to query the prefix [0, rev_comp_index[i]-1] in the reversed array? \n      #           But note: the condition for j: we want j such that comp_index[j] > comp_index[i] -> then rev_comp_index[j] = size-1 - comp_index[j] < size-1 - comp_index[i] = rev_comp_index[i]. So we want to query the prefix [0, rev_comp_index[i]-1] in the reversed array? \n\n      # Actually, we can do:\n\n      #   Let rev_i = size-1 - comp_index[i]\n      #   Then the condition j: comp_index[j] > comp_index[i]  <=> rev_comp_index[j] < rev_comp_index[i]. \n      #   So we want the maximum (dp[j]+j) for j with rev_comp_index[j] < rev_comp_index[i]. \n\n      #   Then we can use a Fenwick tree (for the reversed array) that supports prefix maximum for indices [0, rev_comp_index[i]-1].\n\n      # So we build:\n      #   fenw1: size = size, for the original indices.\n      #   fenw2: size = size, for the reversed indices (which we map an original index j to rev_j = size-1 - j).\n\n      # Steps for i (from 0 to n, but note: we start with j=0 at the beginning):\n\n      #   dp[0] = 0.\n      #   idx0 = comp_map[pref[0]]   # which is the index of 0 in comp.\n      #   rev_idx0 = size-1 - idx0\n      #   Update fenw1: at index idx0, set to max(fenw1[idx0], dp[0]-0) = 0.\n      #   Update fenw2: at index rev_idx0, set to max(fenw2[rev_idx0], dp[0]+0) = 0.\n\n      #   best0 = a dictionary: we also update best0[pref[0]] = 0.\n\n      #   Then for i from 1 to n (i is the index in the prefix array, so we are at pref[i] and we are computing dp[i]):\n\n      #       idx = comp_map[pref[i]]\n      #       rev_idx = size-1 - idx\n\n      #       candidate1 = fenw1.query(idx-1)   # maximum in [0, idx-1] for (dp[j]-j) -> then candidate1 + i\n      #       candidate2 = best0.get(pref[i], -10**18)\n      #       candidate3 = fenw2.query(rev_idx-1)   # maximum in the reversed array for indices [0, rev_idx-1] (which corresponds to j with rev_comp_index[j] < rev_idx, i.e., comp_index[j] > idx) -> then candidate3 - i\n\n      #       dp[i] = max(candidate1 + i, candidate2, candidate3 - i)\n\n      #       Then update:\n      #           fenw1.update(idx, dp[i]-i)\n      #           fenw2.update(rev_idx, dp[i]+i)\n      #           best0[pref[i]] = max(best0.get(pref[i], -10**18), dp[i])\n\n      #   Then the answer for the test case is dp[n]? \n\n      # But note: the problem says we are partitioning the entire array. The dp state we defined is for the prefix ending at i (so the entire array is partitioned from 0 to n). So we output dp[n].\n\n  However, note: the problem says the array a has n elements, and we have pref[0..n] (n+1 elements). We are iterating i from 0 to n? Actually, we are iterating i from 0 to n (inclusive). But note: the partition is defined on the array a[0..n-1]. The state dp[i] is the maximum value for the prefix a[0..i-1]. So we want dp[n] for the entire array.\n\n  But note: the example: \n      Test case 1: [1,2,-3] -> n=3, pref = [0,1,3,0]. Then we want dp[3] = 1.\n\n  Implementation of Fenwick tree for maximum (prefix queries):\n\n      We'll create a class:\n\n          class Fenw:\n              def __init__(self, size):\n                  self.n = size\n                  self.tree = [-10**18] * (self.n+1)   # 1-indexed, so we use 1..n\n\n              def update(self, index, value):\n                  # index: 0-indexed in our array, so we convert to 1-indexed: pos = index+1\n                  i = index+1\n                  while i <= self.n:\n                      if value > self.tree[i]:\n                          self.tree[i] = value\n                      i += i & -i\n\n              def query(self, index):\n                  # query the prefix [0, index] (0-indexed) -> so we want [1, index+1] in 1-indexed.\n                  # if index < 0, return -10**18\n                  if index < 0:\n                      return -10**18\n                  i = index+1\n                  res = -10**18\n                  while i>0:\n                      if self.tree[i] > res:\n                          res = self.tree[i]\n                      i -= i & -i\n                  return res\n\n      But note: the Fenwick tree for maximum does not support arbitrary range queries, but we only need prefix queries.\n\n      For fenw1: we want the maximum in [0, idx-1] (0-indexed). We can do:\n          candidate1 = fenw1.query(idx-1)\n\n      For fenw2: we built for the reversed array. We have an array of size = size. We map an original index j to rev_j = size-1 - j. Then we build a Fenwick tree for the reversed array? Actually, we are storing the value (dp[j]+j) at position rev_j. Then we want to query the prefix [0, rev_i-1] in the reversed array? \n\n          candidate3 = fenw2.query(rev_i-1)   # which gives the maximum (dp[j]+j) for j with rev_comp_index[j] <= rev_i-1, i.e., comp_index[j] >= size - (rev_i-1) ??? \n\n      Actually, we defined rev_j = size-1 - j (where j is the original compressed index). Then the condition we want: j such that j (original) > i (original) -> which is j>i -> then rev_j = size-1-j < size-1-i = rev_i. So we want the maximum in the reversed array for indices [0, rev_i-1] (which corresponds to j with rev_j in [0, rev_i-1]). \n\n      So we do: candidate3 = fenw2.query(rev_i-1)   # if rev_i-1 is negative, then skip.\n\n  However, note: the reversed index rev_j is in the range [0, size-1]. \n\n  But what if rev_i-1 is negative? then we skip.\n\n  We'll initialize the Fenwick trees with a very small number (like -10**18).\n\n  Steps:\n\n      dp = [-10**18] * (n+1)\n      dp[0] = 0\n\n      comp = sorted(set(pref))\n      size = len(comp)\n      comp_map = {}\n      for i, x in enumerate(comp):\n          comp_map[x] = i\n\n      fenw1 = Fenw(size)   # for the original array: stores (dp[j]-j) at index = comp_map[pref[j]]\n      fenw2 = Fenw(size)   # for the reversed array: stores (dp[j]+j) at index = size-1 - comp_map[pref[j]]\n\n      best0 = {}\n\n      # update for j=0:\n      idx0 = comp_map[pref[0]]\n      rev_idx0 = size-1 - idx0\n      fenw1.update(idx0, dp[0]-0)\n      fenw2.update(rev_idx0, dp[0]+0)\n      best0[pref[0]] = dp[0]\n\n      for i in range(1, n+1):   # i from 1 to n (inclusive) -> because we have pref[0..n]\n          idx = comp_map[pref[i]]\n          rev_idx = size-1 - idx\n\n          cand1 = fenw1.query(idx-1) + i   # if there is no j in [0,idx-1], then cand1 = -10**18 + i -> which is very small, but we have to consider the possibility of no candidate?

And when we query the prefix [0, rev_idx-1] we get the maximum value for indices in the reversed array from 0 to rev_idx-1.\n\n  But note: the reversed index for j=0 is 3-1-0? -> no, we defined rev_idx = size-1 - original_index. \n      For j=0: original_index = comp_map[0]=2 -> rev_idx = 3-2=1? \n      For j=1: original_index=2 (for pref[1]=0) -> rev_idx=1? \n      For j=2: original_index=1 (for pref[2]=-2) -> rev_idx=3-1=2? \n      For j=3: original_index=3 (for pref[3]=1) -> rev_idx=3-3=0? \n      For j=4: original_index=0 (for pref[4]=-3) -> rev_idx=3-0=3? \n\n      Then when i=4: rev_idx=3, we query [0,2] -> which includes j=0 (rev_idx=1), j=1 (rev_idx=1), j=2 (rev_idx=2), j=3 (rev_idx=0) -> so we get max(0,1,1,6)=6.\n\n  So the code for program1.py:\n\n      We'll implement the Fenwick tree for maximum (prefix queries) as above.\n\n      But note: the total n (over test cases) is 500000, so we must be careful with the Fenwick tree initialization: we build two Fenwick trees per test case, and the size of each Fenwick tree is the number of distinct prefix values in that test case.\n\n      We'll define:\n\n          class Fenw:\n              def __init__(self, size):\n                  self.n = size\n                  self.tree = [-10**18] * (self.n+1)   # 1-indexed, size+1\n\n              def update(self, idx, val):\n                  i = idx+1\n                  while i <= self.n:\n                      if val > self.tree[i]:\n                          self.tree[i] = val\n                      i += i & -i\n\n              def query(self, idx):   # query prefix [0, idx] (0-indexed)\n                  if idx < 0:\n                      return -10**18\n                  i = idx+1\n                  res = -10**18\n                  while i:\n                      if self.tree[i] > res:\n                          res = self.tree[i]\n                      i -= i & -i\n                  return res\n\n      Then in the main:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              # compute prefix\n              pref = [0]*(n+1)\n              for i in range(1, n+1):\n                  pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n              # compress pref\n              comp = sorted(set(pref))\n              comp_map = {x:i for i,x in enumerate(comp)}\n              size = len(comp)\n\n              fenw1 = Fenw(size)\n              fenw2 = Fenw(size)\n              best0 = {}\n\n              dp = [-10**18] * (n+1)\n              dp[0] = 0\n\n              idx0 = comp_map[pref[0]]\n              rev_idx0 = size-1 - idx0\n              fenw1.update(idx0, 0)   # dp[0]-0\n              fenw2.update(rev_idx0, 0) # dp[0]+0\n              best0[pref[0]] = 0\n\n              for i in range(1, n+1):\n                  idx = comp_map[pref[i]]\n                  rev_idx = size-1 - idx\n\n                  cand1 = fenw1.query(idx-1) + i\n                  cand2 = best0.get(pref[i], -10**18)\n                  cand3 = fenw2.query(rev_idx-1) - i\n\n                  dp[i] = max(cand1, cand2, cand3)\n\n                  # update\n                  fenw1.update(idx, dp[i]-i)\n                  fenw2.update(rev_idx, dp[i]+i)\n                  if pref[i] in best0:\n                      if dp[i] > best0[pref[i]]:\n                          best0[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n                  else:\n                      best0[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n              print(dp[n])\n\n  But note: the constraints: a_i can be as low as -10^9, and the prefix sums can be huge. But we are compressing per test case.\n\n  However, the total n is 500000, so the total distinct prefix values per test case is at most n+1, which is <=500001.\n\n  But the Fenwick tree update and query are O(log(size)), and the total operations per test case is O(n) -> so total time per test case O(n log(n)), and total time over test cases: O( (sum of n) * log(n_i) ) -> the sum of n is 500000, and the maximum n_i for one test case is 500000, so log(n_i) is about 20 -> 500000*20 = 10e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 500000, so the total operations is 500000 * log(500000) which is about 500000*20 = 10e6.\n\n  However, we have two Fenwick trees per update -> 2 * 10e6 operations, which is acceptable in Pyton? We hope so.\n\n  But note: the problem constraints: t up to 500000, but the total n is 500000, so the maximum t is 500000 (if each test case n=1). Then the total distinct prefix values per test case: 2 (for n=1: pref[0] and pref[1]). So the Fenwick trees are small.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the Fenwick tree for the reversed array: we are building a Fenwick tree of size = size (the number of distinct prefix values). And we update at the reversed index.\n\n  But note: the reversed index: rev_idx = size-1 - idx, which is in the range [0, size-1]. So we can use the same Fenwick tree class.\n\n  But note: the Fenwick tree we built for the reversed array: the indices we use are the reversed indices, which are in [0, size-1]. So we can use the same class.\n\n  We'll code the Fenw class and then use it.\n\n  However, the provided code already has a class Seg, but we are not using it. We'll replace with Fenw.\n\n  But the provided code has a function my_main(). We'll complete the code in the provided structure.\n\n  The provided code for program1.py:\n\n      We see that it already has:\n\n          input = stdin.readline\n          finp = [int(x) for x in stdin.buffer.read().split()]\n\n      And then a function inp(). We can use the fast input.\n\n      We note: the total input numbers: t (1 number) + for each test case: n (1 number) and n integers -> total numbers = 1 + t*(1+n). The total n over test cases is 500000, so the total numbers is 1 + t + (sum of n) = 1 + t + 500000. Since t<=500000, total numbers <= 1000001.\n\n      We can read the entire input at once? The provided finp is already reading the entire buffer.\n\n      We'll use:\n\n          t = finp[0]\n          index = 1\n          for i in range(t):\n              n = finp[index]; index+=1\n              a = finp[index:index+n]; index+=n\n\n      Then we process.\n\n  We'll write the Fenw class and then the main loop.\n\n  But note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is 500000, but the total distinct prefix values per test case is the distinct values in the prefix array of that test case. The worst-case distinct values is n+1, which is <=500001. But the Fenwick tree for one test case has size = distinct_count, and we build two per test case. The total memory: sum over test cases of 2*(distinct_count) <= 2*(500000+t) <= 2000000, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the Fenw tree has an array of size (size+1). So for one test case: 2*(size+1) integers. The total over test cases: 2*(total distinct prefix values + t) = 2*(500000+t+t) = 2*(500000+2*t) -> worst-case t=500000 -> 2*(500000+1000000)=3000000 integers -> 12 MB? acceptable.\n\n  We'll code accordingly.\n\n  But note: the Fenw tree update and query: we do 2 updates and 2 queries per i (and i from 1 to n, so n per test case). The total n over test cases is 500000, so total operations 2*2*500000 = 2000000, which is acceptable.\n\n  Let's code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the provided code already has a class Seg, but we are not using it. We'll remove it and use Fenw.\n\n  We'll write:\n\n      class Fenw:\n          ... as above ...\n\n      Then in my_main:\n\n          t = finp[0]\n          idx = 1\n          pans = []\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = finp[idx]; idx+=1\n              a = finp[idx:idx+n]; idx+=n\n\n              # compute prefix\n              pref = [0]*(n+1)\n              for i in range(1, n+1):\n                  pref[i] = pref[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n              # compress\n              comp = sorted(set(pref))\n              comp_map = {}\n              for i, x in enumerate(comp):\n                  comp_map[x] = i\n              size = len(comp)\n\n              fenw1 = Fenw(size)\n              fenw2 = Fenw(size)\n              best0 = {}\n\n              dp = [-10**18]*(n+1)\n              dp[0] = 0\n\n              idx0 = comp_map[pref[0]]\n              rev_idx0 = size-1 - idx0\n              fenw1.update(idx0, dp[0]-0)\n              fenw2.update(rev_idx0, dp[0]+0)\n              best0[pref[0]] = dp[0]\n\n              for i in range(1, n+1):\n                  pos = comp_map[pref[i]]\n                  rev_pos = size-1 - pos\n\n                  cand1 = fenw1.query(pos-1) + i\n                  cand2 = best0.get(pref[i], -10**18)\n                  cand3 = fenw2.query(rev_pos-1) - i\n\n                  dp[i] = max(cand1, cand2, cand3)\n\n                  fenw1.update(pos, dp[i]-i)\n                  fenw2.update(rev_pos, dp[i]+i)\n                  if pref[i] in best0:\n                      if dp[i] > best0[pref[i]]:\n                          best0[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n                  else:\n                      best0[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n              pans.append(str(dp[n]))\n\n          print('\\n'.join(pans))\n\n  But note: the Fenw class: we must initialize with a very small number. We'll use -10**18.\n\n  However, the values of dp[i] can be as low as -10**18? and we are adding i (which is up to 500000) so we must use a very small initial value? We are using -10**18.\n\n  But note: the problem constraints: the answer can be negative? but the example answers are positive.\n\n  We'll use -10**18 as -INF.\n\n  But note: the Fenw tree update: we are updating with a value that might be -10**18, and then we do max. That is acceptable.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the Fenw tree for maximum: the update and query are as above.\n\n  But note: the Fenw tree query: when we query an empty range, we return -10**18.\n\n  We'll write the Fenw class.\n\n  But note: the provided code already has a class Seg, we can remove it.\n\n  We'll replace the class Seg with:\n\n      class Fenw:\n          __slots__ = ('n', 'tree')\n          def __init__(self, size):\n              self.n = size\n              self.tree = [-10**18] * (self.n+1)\n\n          def update(self, idx, val):\n              i = idx+1\n              while i <= self.n:\n                  if val > self.tree[i]:\n                      self.tree[i] = val\n                  i += i & -i\n\n          def query(self, idx):\n              if idx < 0:\n                  return -10**18\n              i = idx+1\n              s = -10**18\n              while i:\n                  if self.tree[i] > s:\n                      s = self.tree[i]\n                  i -= i & -i\n              return s\n\n  Then in my_main, we use it.\n\n  However, note: the Fenw tree update: we are updating the value at an index to be the maximum of the current value and the new value. This is correct.\n\n  But note: the Fenw tree for maximum does not support range queries beyond the prefix. We are only doing prefix queries, so it's okay.\n\n  We'll run the examples to be sure.\n\n  But note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is 500000, and we are doing 2*2*n operations (two trees, each update and query per i) -> 4*n, which is 2000000, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the Fenw tree update and query are O(log(size)), and the size is the number of distinct prefix values, which is at most n+1. So log(size) is about 20.\n\n  Total operations: 4 * (total n) * 20 = 4 * 500000 * 20 = 40000000, which is acceptable in Python? We hope so.\n\n  We'll output the code for program1.py accordingly.\n\n  But note: the problem says: Output only the missing code. The provided code has:\n\n      from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque\n      import bisect\n      from sys import stdin, stdout\n      from itertools import repeat\n      import math\n\n      MOD = 998244353\n      input = stdin.readline\n      finp = [int(x) for x in stdin.buffer.read().split()]\n\n      ... and then some functions ...\n\n      class Seg(object): ...   # we remove this and replace with Fenw\n\n      Then my_main.\n\n  We'll write the Fenw class and then the my_main function as described.\n\n  But note: the provided code has a function my_main() that is called at the end. We'll complete the body of my_main.\n\n  However, the provided code for program1.py already has:\n\n      def my_main():\n          # print(500000)\n          # for i in range(500000):\n          #     print(1)\n          #     print(-1000000000)\n          ii = 0 \n          kase = finp[ii];ii+=1\n          pans = []\n          for skase in range(kase):\n              # print(\"Case #%d: \" % (skase+1), end='')\n              n = finp[ii];ii+=1\n              da = finp[ii:ii+n];ii+=n\n              # ... and then it has a comment and a TODO ...\n\n  We'll replace the TODO part with our code.\n\n  Actually, the provided code has:\n\n      pref = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + da[i-1]\n\n      # Then it has:\n      #   spos, sneg = sorted([(pref[i], -i) for i, v in enumerate(pref)]), sorted([(pref[i], i) for i, v in enumerate(pref)])\n      #   ordpos, ordneg = [0] * (n+1), [0] * (n+1)\n      #   pfen, nfen = Fenwick(n), Fenwick(n)\n      #   dmx = {}\n      #   for i in range(n+1):\n      #       ordpos[-spos[i][-1]] = i\n      #       ordneg[sneg[i][-1]] = i\n      #   dp = [0] * (n+1)\n      #   dmx[0] = 0\n      #   pfen.modify(ordpos[0], 0)\n      #   nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[0], 0)\n      #   for i in range(1, n+1):\n      #       dp[i] = max(i+pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i])-i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF))\n      #       pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n      #       nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n      #       if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n      #           dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n      #   pans.append(str(dp[n]))\n\n  This is an alternative implementation that uses two Fenwick trees and a dictionary. But it uses a class Fenwick that is not defined? \n\n  Actually, the provided code has a class Fenwick? But the code we see only has class Seg. \n\n  We are going to replace the entire body of the for-loop in my_main with our solution.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  We see that the provided code for program1.py has a class Seg and then a function my_main that reads the input and then for each test case does:\n\n      n = finp[ii]; ii+=1\n      da = finp[ii:ii+n]; ii+=n\n\n      and then it has a long comment and a TODO.\n\n  We'll replace from the computation of pref to the end of the test case.\n\n  So we'll write:\n\n      pref = [0]*(n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + da[i-1]\n\n      # Then compress, and then our Fenw trees and dp.\n\n  But note: the provided code already computes pref? \n\n  Actually, the provided code does not compute pref? It has a comment that says:\n\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we'll write the entire block from the computation of pref to the appending of dp[n].\n\n  However, we must define the Fenw class. But the problem says: output only the missing code. We are to output the entire missing block for program1.py? \n\n  The problem says: Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\n\n  And the output format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n  For program1.py, we are to output the code that goes in the TODO part? \n\n  But note: the provided code for program1.py has:\n\n      def my_main():\n          ii = 0 \n          kase = finp[ii];ii+=1\n          pans = []\n          for skase in range(kase):\n              n = finp[ii];ii+=1\n              da = finp[ii:ii+n];ii+=n\n              # ... then a long comment and a TODO ...\n\n  The TODO is in the for-loop for the test case.\n\n  We'll output the code that replaces from the computation of pref to the end of the for-loop for the test case.\n\n  But note: the provided code after the TODO has:\n\n        pans.append(str(dp[n]))\n    print('\\n'.join(pans))\n\n  So we only need to compute dp[n] and append.\n\n  We'll write:\n\n      # Compute prefix array\n      pref = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          pref[i] = pref[i-1] + da[i-1]\n\n      # Compress the prefix array\n      comp = sorted(set(pref))\n      comp_map = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(comp)}\n      size = len(comp)\n\n      # Initialize data structures\n      # We'll define a Fenw class? But we must define it outside the function? \n      # However, the problem says: output only the missing block. We are only to output the block for the test case? \n      # But the Fenw class is not defined in the provided code. \n\n  We have two options:\n\n      Option 1: define the Fenw class inside my_main? But that is inefficient and not allowed in the problem? \n\n      Option 2: the problem expects that we output the entire missing block including the Fenw class? But the Fenw class should be defined outside the loop.\n\n  However, the provided code already has a class Seg. We can replace that class with our Fenw class.\n\n  So we must output two parts for program1:\n\n      Part 1: replace the class Seg with our Fenw class.\n\n      Part 2: replace the block in the for-loop for the test case.\n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing lines or blocks. \n\n  We see that the class Seg is already defined, but we are not using it. We can remove it and define Fenw in its place.\n\n  So for program1.py, we output:\n\n      program1: the code for the Fenw class and then the block for the test case.\n\n  But note: the provided code has:\n\n      class Seg(object):\n          def __init__(self, n):\n              self._da = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n              self._op = [-INF] * (n * 5)\n\n          def update(self, p):\n              self._op[p] = max(self._op[p*2], self._op[p*2+1])\n\n          def modify(self, pos, x, p, l, r):\n              if l==r-1:\n                  self._da[p] = self._op[p] = x\n                  return\n              mid = (l+r)//2\n              if pos < mid:\n                  self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\n              else:\n                  self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n              self.update(p)\n\n          def query(self, x, y, p, l, r):\n              if x <= l and r <= y:\n                  return self._op[p]\n              if x >= r or y<=l:\n                  return -INF\n              mid = (l+r)//2\n              return max(self.query(x, y, p*2, l, mid), self.query(x, y, p*2+1, mid, r))\n\n  We replace this with our Fenw class.\n\n  So we output for program1:\n\n      class Fenw:\n          __slots__ = ('n', 'tree')\n          def __init__(self, size):\n              self.n = size\n              self.tree = [-10**18] * (self.n+1)\n\n          def update(self, idx, val):\n              i = idx+1\n              while i <= self.n:\n                  if val > self.tree[i]:\n                      self.tree[i] = val\n                  i += i & -i\n\n          def query(self, idx):\n              if idx < 0:\n                  return -10**18\n              i = idx+1\n              s = -10**18\n              while i:\n                  if self.tree[i] > s:\n                      s = self.tree[i]\n                  i -= i & -i\n              return s\n\n      And then in the test case loop:\n\n          pref = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              pref[i] = pref[i-1] + da[i-1]\n\n          comp = sorted(set(pref))\n          comp_map = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(comp)}\n          size = len(comp)\n\n          fenw1 = Fenw(size)\n          fenw2 = Fenw(size)\n          best0 = {}\n\n          dp = [-10**18] * (n+1)\n          dp[0] = 0\n\n          idx0 = comp_map[pref[0]]\n          rev_idx0 = size-1 - idx0\n          fenw1.update(idx0, dp[0]-0)\n          fenw2.update(rev_idx0, dp[0]+0)\n          best0[pref[0]] = dp[0]\n\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              pos = comp_map[pref[i]]\n              rev_pos = size-1 - pos\n\n              cand1 = fenw1.query(pos-1) + i\n              cand2 = best0.get(pref[i], -10**18)\n              cand3 = fenw2.query(rev_pos-1) - i\n\n              dp[i] = max(cand1, cand2, cand3)\n\n              fenw1.update(pos, dp[i]-i)\n              fenw2.update(rev_pos, dp[i]+i)\n              if pref[i] in best0:\n                  if dp[i] > best0[pref[i]]:\n                      best0[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n              else:\n                  best0[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          pans.append(str(dp[n]))\n\n  But note: the provided code after the test case loop is:\n\n      print('\\n'.join(pans))\n\n  So we are done.\n\n  However, we must use a large negative constant. We'll use -10**18.\n\n  But note: the provided code has a constant INF = 1<<30, which is about 1e9. We can use -10**18.\n\n  We'll use -10**18.\n\n  Now for program2.py:\n\n  Description: \n      We are given two arrays a and b (both of length n) and b is a permutation of a.\n      We can do an operation: choose l, r with 1<=l<r<=n and a[l]=a[r], then set a[l..r] = [a[l+1], a[l+2], ..., a[r], a[l]].\n      We want to know if we can transform a into b.\n\n  Input: \n      t test cases. For each: n, then array a, then array b.\n\n  Output: \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n  Example: \n      Test case 1: a = [1,2,3,1,2,3], b = [3,1,2,3,2,1] -> output YES? but the example operations are not shown.\n\n  The note examples:\n\n      In the first test case: [1,3,2,2] -> choose l=2, r=5 (1-indexed) -> [1,3,2,2] becomes [1,3,2,2] with l=2, r=5? \n          Actually, the array is 0-indexed? \n          Operation: choose l and r such that a[l]=a[r]. Then set a[l..r] = [a[l+1], a[l+2], ..., a[r], a[l]].\n\n          Example: [1,3,2,2]: \n              l=2, r=5: but the array has only 4 elements -> indices 0 to 3.\n          The example says: [1,3,3,2,2] -> then [1,3,3,2,2] becomes ... \n\n      Actually, the example in the note:\n\n          Test case 1: [1,2,3,1,2,3] -> becomes [3,1,2,3,2,1]? \n\n      The operation: \n          We choose l and r with a[l]=a[r].

(because the while loop condition breaks when an[pa] is either c or prv). \n\n          And then we do: used[prv] += 1.\n\n          This means: we are not using the current an[pa] to match c, but we are using the previous matched element (prv) to stand in for c? \n\n          And then we are adding one extra copy of prv to 'used'? \n\n          But why would we do that?\n\n          Let me try with the example: \n\n              a = [1,4,2,2,1] -> an = [1,2,2,4,1]\n              b = [4,2,2,1,1] -> bn = [1,1,2,2,4]\n\n          Initialize: used={}, pa=0, prv=None.\n\n          c = 1 (first in bn)\n              while: an[pa]=1 -> c is 1, so the condition \"c not in (an[pa], prv)\" is false -> break.\n              then: c==an[pa] -> True, so pa becomes 1, and prv=1.\n\n          c = 1 (next in bn)\n              while: an[pa]=2, c=1, prv=1 -> so 1 is in (2,1) -> breaks? \n                  condition: c not in (an[pa], prv) -> 1 not in (2,1) -> false? \n                  Actually, 1 is in (2,1) because prv=1 -> so condition is false -> break.\n              then: c==an[pa]? 1==2? no -> so we do: used[prv] = used.get(1,0)+1 -> used[1]=1, and prv=1.\n\n          c = 2 (next in bn)\n              while: an[pa]=2, c=2, prv=1 -> condition: 2 not in (2,1) -> false -> break.\n              then: c==an[pa] -> yes, so pa=2, prv=2.\n\n          c = 2 (next in bn)\n              while: an[pa]=2, c=2, prv=2 ->"
