Then we take another from left: s1 becomes w0+w1, then if w0+w1 == w_{n-1}, then total=3? But note: at that point, we have taken two from left and one from right? Actually, total = 2 (from left) + 1 (from right) = 3. Then we take from right: s2 becomes w_{n-1}+w_{n-2}, and if that equals w0+w1, then total=4?

But we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # which would be n? because p1 = n and p2 = -1? \n              # p1: we have taken from 0 to n-1 -> p1 = n\n              # p2: we have taken from n-1 to 0 -> p2 = -1, so n-1 - (-1) = n -> total = n + n = 2n? That's not right. Actually, let me compute: \n            total candies = (candies taken by Alice) + (candies taken by Bob) = p1 (because she took from 0 to p1-1) and Bob took from p2+1 to n-1 -> (n-1-p2). So total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = (p1 - p2) + (n-1) After the loop, we have p1 = ... and p2 = ...?",

Then we break the tie: s1<=s2 -> true, so we take l[0]=1 -> s1=1, p1=1. Now: p1=1, p2=1 -> still in the loop. Now s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal. Then we do: s1>s2 -> so we take from the right: l[1]=1 -> s2=1, p2=0. Now p1=1, p2=0 -> p1>p2? 1>0 -> break. Then we check: s1==s2 -> true, so we update max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1 = 2. So we output 2. That matches. But note: we did not record the equality at the beginning?",

We remove it. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from `s1,s2=0,0` to the print, but we have to replace the existing while loop and the print. Specifically, we replace:\n\n          l2= []\n          s1,s2=0,0\n          p1,p2=0,n-1\n          while (p1-1<=p2): if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n              if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n              if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n          print(l2[-1])\n\n          with:\n\n          s1,s2=0,0\n          p1,p2=0,n-1\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2: if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n          print(max_candies)\n\n          But note: the condition in the while loop: we changed from `(p1-1<=p2)` to `p1<=p2`. And we removed the `l2` line. So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n          s1,s2=0,0\n          p1,p2=0,n-1\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n          print(max_candies)\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\".",

But note: the problem says the sequence a is non-increasing and we are given a_0, a_1, ..., a_n, and for i>n, a_i=0. The example: n=1, and a = [2,1] (because n=1, so we have two numbers: a0, a1).

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two players, Alice and Bob, eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight eaten by each to be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code uses two pointers (p1 starting at 0 and p2 starting at n-1) and two sums (s1 for Alice and s2 for Bob). The idea is to move the pointers and update the sums until the pointers cross. We are to record the total number of candies eaten (which would be p1 + (n-1-p2)) whenever the two sums are equal.\n\nHowever, note that the condition in the while loop is currently written as `while (p1-1<=p2)`, which seems incorrect. We should change it to `while p1 <= p2` (or similar) to avoid an infinite loop and to correctly traverse.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total number of candies eaten is the sum of the candies eaten by Alice (p1) and by Bob (n-1-p2). So the total count is p1 + (n - 1 - p2). However, when they meet, we have to be cautious.\n\nThe provided code has a list `l2` which is currently empty and then it prints `l2[-1]` at the end. This will cause an error because we never append to `l2`. Instead, we should record the maximum total candies whenever s1 == s2.\n\nWe can do:\n  if s1 == s2:\n      total_candies = p1 + (n - 1 - p2)\n      # and then we record this total_candies (and then we want the maximum over the entire process)\n\nBut note: we are moving the pointers and updating the sums. We want the maximum total candies over the entire process.\n\nWe can have a variable `max_candies` that we update whenever s1==s2. Then at the end we print `max_candies`.\n\nHowever, the problem says that the total of n over test cases is at most 200,000, so we can do:\n\nRevised plan for program1.py:\n  Initialize max_candies = 0.\n  Use two pointers: p1=0, p2=n-1, s1=0, s2=0.\n  While p1 <= p2:\n      if s1 == s2:\n          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten p1 candies (from 0 to p1-1) and Bob has eaten from p2+1 to n-1, which is n-1-p2 candies.\n          # Then we try to extend? But note: we can also continue to see if we can get a larger total? However, we are going to continue the process.\n          # But note: we are going to update the pointers. We can record the current total and then update the pointers.\n          # However, we must update the pointers in such a way that we break the tie. The problem is: if we have s1==s2, we can either take from the left or the right? But note the problem: we are allowed to have non-overlapping. We want to maximize the total candies, so we record the current total and then we can try to extend? Actually, we can only record the current total and then we have to update one of the pointers to break the tie? But the problem says we can't skip, so we have to take contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right.\n\n      Then, if s1 <= s2: we add a candy from the left (to s1 and move p1) because we want to increase s1 to catch up with s2? But note: if s1==s2, we can break the tie arbitrarily? Actually, we can do:\n\n      We have three conditions? The current code has two ifs after the equality check. But note: if we are in the state s1==s2, then the next two ifs will both be false? So we must break the tie. We can do: if s1<=s2 then we add from left, else from right. But note: we want to continue the process until the pointers cross.\n\n  However, the provided code does:\n      if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n      if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n  But if s1==s2, then we do nothing? Then we get stuck. So we must break the tie in the equality case.\n\n  We can change the order: when s1==s2, we record the current total and then we try to take one from the left? But note: we can also take one from the right? Actually, we can do either. However, we want to maximize the total candies. But note: we are going to continue the process and we might get a larger total later? So we record the current total and then we break the tie by taking from the left? Or from the right? Actually, it doesn't matter because we are going to simulate until the pointers cross and we record every time we have equality.\n\n  So we can do:\n      if s1 == s2:\n          max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because we are about to take one more? Actually, no: at the moment of equality, we have already taken the candies that make s1 and s2. The next candy hasn't been taken. So the current state: Alice has taken p1 candies (from index0 to p1-1) and Bob has taken from p2+1 to n-1 (so n-1-p2 candies). So total = p1 + (n-1-p2). Then we break the tie by taking one from the left? But note: we are going to update the pointers. We can break the tie arbitrarily.\n\n      Then we break the tie: if s1 <= s2, then we take from the left. Why <=? Because if s1==s2, we take from the left? That would be one way.\n\n  But note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is bounded, so we can do:\n\n  Revised code for the while loop:\n\n      max_candies = 0\n      while p1 <= p2:\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total as a candidate\n          if s1 <= s2:\n              s1 += l[p1]\n              p1 += 1\n          else:\n              s2 += l[p2]\n              p2 -= 1\n\n      But wait: what if at the end we have s1==s2? We would break the loop without recording? So we can check after the loop? Or we can record inside the loop and then after the loop if the last state was equal? Actually, we can record every time we have equality and then take the maximum candidate.\n\n  However, note: the problem says that we want the maximum total candies. The candidate we record is the total at the moment of equality. And we are traversing the entire array, so we will record every time we have an equality. And we want the maximum total candies? Actually, the total candies is increasing as we take more? But note: when we take more, the total candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) increases? Actually, no: because p1 increases and p2 decreases, so the total candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) = (p1 - p2) + (n-1). As p1 increases and p2 decreases, (p1-p2) increases. So the total candies increases as we take more candies? But we are not necessarily taking more candies: we are moving the pointers. Actually, the total candies is p1 (from the left) and (n-1-p2) from the right, so total = p1 + (n-1-p2). As we move, p1 increases and p2 decreases, so the total increases? Actually, when we take one candy (either from left or right) the total increases by 1. So the later we have an equality, the more candies we have eaten. Therefore, we are interested in the last time we have equality? But note: we might have multiple equalities and we want the maximum total, which would be the last one? However, consider: we start with 0 candies (so 0=0) and total=0. Then we take one from left: s1 becomes w0, then we take one from right: s2 becomes w_{n-1}. Then if w0==w_{n-1}, we have total=2. Then we take another from left: s1 becomes w0+w1, then if w0+w1 == w_{n-1}, then total=3? But note: at that point, we have taken two from left and one from right? Actually, total = 2 (from left) + 1 (from right) = 3. Then we take from right: s2 becomes w_{n-1}+w_{n-2}, and if that equals w0+w1, then total=4? So the total increases by one each time we take a candy. Therefore, the last time we have equality is the maximum total.\n\n  However, what if we have an equality at the very end? We break the loop when p1>p2. So we can record the last equality? But note: we break the loop when p1>p2, meaning we have taken all candies? But we cannot take the same candy twice.\n\n  But note: the problem says that they cannot eat the same candy. So when we take a candy, we remove it.\n\n  Therefore, we can record every time we have an equality and then the last recorded equality (which has the highest total) is the answer? Actually, the total is increasing, so the last equality we meet is the maximum.\n\n  However, what if we have an equality at the last step? For example, when we take the last candy and then the sums become equal? But note: we break the loop when p1>p2. We can adjust the loop to include the last step? The current condition is `while p1<=p2`. When p1==p2, we can still take one candy? But we can only take one candy: either from the left or the right? Then the other pointer will move and then we break? Actually, we take one candy and then the pointers will cross? So we can record the equality at the last step.\n\n  But note: the provided code has a while condition: `while (p1-1<=p2)`. That condition is equivalent to `p1 <= p2+1`. That is too broad? Because when p1=0, then p1-1=-1, which is <= p2 (which is at least 0) -> true. Then we do the loop. Then we update and then we check again. Actually, that condition might lead to an infinite loop? Because when p1 becomes p2+1, then p1-1 = p2, which is <= p2 -> true. Then we do the loop again? Then we try to access l[p1] when p1 is n? That would be out of bounds.\n\n  So we change the while condition to `while p1 <= p2`? But then we miss the last step? Actually, we want to process as long as there are candies to take? So `while p1<=p2` is the standard.\n\n  However, the problem says: we cannot skip candies. So we take one at a time.\n\n  Revised plan for program1.py:\n\n      t = number of test cases\n      for each test case:\n          n = int(input())\n          l = list of n integers\n          s1, s2 = 0, 0\n          p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because we have taken p1 from left and (n-1-p2) from right? \n                  # But note: the candies taken by Alice: indices [0, p1-1] -> p1 candies.\n                  # Bob: indices [p2+1, n-1] -> (n-1 - p2) candies.\n                  # So total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n\n          # But what if at the last step (when we break the loop) we have s1==s2? We didn't record it because we broke the loop? \n          # Actually, when we break the loop, we have p1>p2. But the last step: we updated one pointer and then the condition fails. \n          # However, we can check: after the loop, if s1==s2, then we can update max_candies? But note: after the loop, we have taken one more candy? Actually, the last update was done and then we broke the loop. But the condition for equality was not checked in the loop? Because we broke the condition.\n\n          # Alternatively, we can check after the loop? But note: the condition in the loop: we break when p1>p2. So after the last update, we break. We can check after the loop? But the problem: we are not allowed to take the same candy twice.\n\n          # Actually, we can do: after the loop, we check if s1==s2? Then we update max_candies? But note: at that point, we have taken all candies? So total = n. But we can do:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # which would be n? because p1 = n and p2 = -1? \n              # p1: we have taken from 0 to n-1 -> p1 = n\n              # p2: we have taken from n-1 to 0 -> p2 = -1, so n-1 - (-1) = n -> total = n + n = 2n? That's not right.\n\n          Actually, let me compute: \n            total candies = (candies taken by Alice) + (candies taken by Bob) = p1 (because she took from 0 to p1-1) and Bob took from p2+1 to n-1 -> (n-1-p2). \n            So total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = (p1 - p2) + (n-1)\n\n          After the loop, we have p1 = ... and p2 = ...? \n\n          How we break: \n            We break when p1>p2. \n            The last step: we had p1<=p2, then we updated one pointer. Then we break.\n\n          Example: n=1: \n            Initially: p1=0, p2=0 -> enter loop.\n            s1=0, s2=0 -> record max_candies = 0 + (1-1-0) = 0? \n            Then we do: if s1<=s2 -> true, so we add l[0] to s1, then p1 becomes 1.\n            Then we break the loop because p1=1>p2=0.\n            Then we check after the loop: s1 = l[0], s2=0 -> not equal.\n\n          But the answer for n=1 should be 0? Because they cannot both eat the same total? \n\n          However, the problem says: for the first test case (which is n=2, candies [1,1]) the answer is 2. \n\n          So for n=1: we have one candy. They cannot both eat the same non-zero weight? So 0.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" and \"Bob can eat any number from the right\". They can choose to eat 0? Then both have 0. But then the total candies eaten is 0. So the answer is 0.\n\n          So the above code for n=1: we record max_candies=0 at the beginning. Then we update and break. Then we don't have an equality at the end. Then we output 0.\n\n          Now, what about n=2: [1,1]:\n            p1=0, p2=1 -> enter loop.\n            s1=0, s2=0 -> record max_candies = 0 + (2-1-1) = 0? That doesn't seem right.\n\n          Let me compute: \n            total = p1 (number of candies Alice has taken) + (n-1-p2) (number of candies Bob has taken)\n            At the start: p1=0, p2=1 -> Alice has taken 0, Bob has taken 0 -> total=0.\n\n          Then we break the tie: s1<=s2 -> true, so we take l[0]=1 -> s1=1, p1=1.\n            Now: p1=1, p2=1 -> still in the loop.\n            Now s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n            Then we do: s1>s2 -> so we take from the right: l[1]=1 -> s2=1, p2=0.\n            Now p1=1, p2=0 -> p1>p2? 1>0 -> break.\n            Then we check: s1==s2 -> true, so we update max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n          So we output 2. That matches.\n\n          But note: we did not record the equality at the beginning? We recorded 0, but then we updated to 2 at the end. So we need to record the last equality? Actually, we record every time we have equality and then we take the maximum? But note: the total is increasing? So the last one is the maximum.\n\n          However, we can simply record the last time we had equality? Because the total is increasing. So we can just update max_candies every time we have equality and then the last one will be the maximum.\n\n          But what if we have multiple equalities? For example: [1,2,3,1,2,3]? \n          We want to record the last one? Actually, the total number of candies is increasing: each time we take one candy, the total increases by 1. So the last equality we meet has the largest total.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # update to the current total\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n\n          # Then after the loop, we don't need to check again? Because if we break the loop, we have p1>p2, and we cannot take more. But what if we break the loop and then s1==s2? We didn't check in the last update? \n\n          Actually, in the last update: we updated one pointer and then the condition p1<=p2 fails. But we did not check the equality after the update? So we must check after the loop? \n\n          Example: [1,1] as above: we break the loop and then we check and update.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n\n          if s1 == s2 and p1>p2:   # but note: we broke the loop because p1>p2, and we have updated the sums. But we didn't check the equality at the last state?\n          Actually, the last update: we updated one candy and then the pointers crossed. Then we break. We did not check the equality after that update? \n\n          But note: the condition in the loop: we break when p1>p2. The last update: we updated one pointer and then the condition fails. So we break without checking the equality. Therefore, we must check after the loop? \n\n          However, after the loop, we have updated the sums and the pointers. We can check:\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because we have taken p1 from left and (n-1-p2) from right.\n\n          But note: in the [1,1] example, after the loop: p1=1, p2=0 -> total = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1=2.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n          But wait: what if we have multiple equalities? Then we update max_candies multiple times and the last one (after the loop) will overwrite? But we want the maximum total, which is the last one. So that's okay.\n\n          However, what if we have an equality in the loop and then after the loop we have another? Actually, after the loop we break, so we only check once after the loop. And the after-loop state is the final state.\n\n          But note: the after-loop state: we have taken all candies? Then the total is n? And if the total weight is even? Then we can have s1==s2? Then we update to n? But that's the maximum possible? So that's good.\n\n          However, we are updating max_candies in the loop and then again after the loop? We want the last one. So we can simply do:\n\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\n          But then if we have an equality both in the loop and after the loop, we overwrite the loop value with the after-loop value? And the after-loop value is larger? So that's okay.\n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid the after-loop check by adjusting the loop condition? But the problem: we break the loop when p1>p2, and the last update might cause an equality that we didn't check.\n\n          Another idea: we can check the equality at the beginning of the loop? But then the initial state (0,0) is recorded? Then we update. Then the next state: we update and then check? But we break the loop when p1>p2, so we might miss the last update.\n\n          Actually, we can change the order: we update the pointers and then check? But then we are checking after the update? Then we don't miss the last update? But note: we update the pointers and then the condition p1<=p2 might fail? Then we break without checking the next state? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          while True:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              if p1>p2: break\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n\n          Then we check the equality at the beginning of the loop, and then we break if the pointers have crossed? But note: we break after the equality check? Then we break only after we have updated the pointers? \n\n          But the condition for breaking: we break if p1>p2? But we break after the equality check? Then we break after we have updated the pointers? \n\n          However, we update the pointers in the previous iteration? Then we break at the beginning of the next iteration? \n\n          Example: [1,1]:\n            Iteration1: \n                s1=0, s2=0 -> record max_candies = 0 + (2-1-1)=0.\n                p1<=p2 -> true, so we don't break.\n                s1<=s2 -> true: s1 becomes 1, p1 becomes 1.\n            Iteration2:\n                s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n                p1=1, p2=1 -> p1<=p2 -> true, so we don't break.\n                s1>s2 -> true: so we take from right: s2 becomes 1, p2 becomes 0.\n            Iteration3:\n                s1=1, s2=1 -> record max_candies = 1 + (2-1-0)=2.\n                now check: p1=1, p2=0 -> p1>p2? 1>0 -> break.\n\n          So we output 2.\n\n          This avoids the after-loop check.\n\n          But note: the condition for the while loop: we break when p1>p2? But we break at the beginning of the iteration? So we don't process the state when p1>p2? That's what we want.\n\n          However, we are updating the pointers and then we break at the next iteration? So we have processed the state after the update? \n\n          This seems better.\n\n          But note: the initial state: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> we enter the loop. We check the initial state (0,0) and then update.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:   # we break at the beginning of the next iteration? Actually, we break when we detect p1>p2 at the beginning? But we want to break immediately? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          while True:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              if p1 > p2: \n                  break\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n\n          Then we break when p1>p2? But note: we break after the equality check? \n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          But the problem: the total n over test cases is bounded by 200,000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps per test case.\n\n          So we choose this structure.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n          We replace the while condition and the body.\n\n          Specifically, we change:\n\n          l2=[] -> we don't need l2. We remove that line.\n          Then we do:\n\n          max_candies = 0\n          p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n          s1, s2 = 0, 0\n          while True:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n              if p1 > p2:\n                  break\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n\n          Then we print(max_candies)\n\n          But note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is bounded by 200,000, so we are safe.\n\n          However, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 200,000. So we are safe.\n\n          But note: the initial code had a line `l2=[]` and then `print(l2[-1])`. We remove that.\n\n          So the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from the initialization of s1,s2,p1,p2 and the while loop and then the print.\n\n          But the problem says: we are to output only the missing lines? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". And the provided code has:\n\n          for _ in range(I()[0]):\n              n=I()[0]\n              l=I()\n              l2=[]\n              s1,s2=0,0\n              p1,p2=0,n-1\n              while (p1-1<=p2):\n                  if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                  if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                  if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n              print(l2[-1])\n\n          We are to replace the while loop and the print? And remove l2? \n\n          We can do:\n\n          for _ in range(I()[0]):\n              n=I()[0]\n              l=I()\n              s1,s2=0,0\n              p1,p2=0,n-1\n              max_candies = 0\n              while True:\n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                  if p1 > p2:\n                      break\n                  if s1 <= s2:\n                      s1 += l[p1]\n                      p1 += 1\n                  else:\n                      s2 += l[p2]\n                      p2 -= 1\n              print(max_candies)\n\n          But note: the condition in the if after the break: we use `if s1<=s2` and then `else`. This covers all cases? Because if s1==s2, we take the left? That's arbitrary.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify which one to take when equal? But we can take either? So it's okay.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" and \"Bob can eat any number from the right\". They are independent? But we are simulating: we take one at a time? Actually, we are building the sums. The order of taking doesn't matter? Because the total weight is fixed. But we are constrained by the contiguous segments? Actually, we are taking contiguous from the left and contiguous from the right? And we are building the sums by taking one at a time? \n\n          This greedy approach is known for the \"Two Sum\" type problem? Actually, it's a standard two pointers.\n\n          Therefore, we write:\n\n          We remove the line `l2=[]` and the while loop and the print, and replace with:\n\n          We'll write:\n\n          for _ in range(I()[0]):\n              n = I()[0]\n              l = I()\n              s1, s2 = 0, 0\n              p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n              max_candies = 0\n              while p1 <= p2:   # we can also do: while True, but then break when p1>p2. Alternatively, we can break when p1>p2 at the beginning of the loop? \n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                  if s1 <= s2:\n                      s1 += l[p1]\n                      p1 += 1\n                  else:\n                      s2 += l[p2]\n                      p2 -= 1\n              if s1 == s2 and p1>p2:   # after the loop, we have p1>p2, and we check the sums?\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              print(max_candies)\n\n          But wait: the while loop condition is `p1<=p2`. Then we break when p1>p2? Then we check after the loop? \n\n          This is the same as the first approach? \n\n          We can do either. Let me test with [1,1] in the while loop:\n\n            p1=0, p2=1: enter loop -> s1==s2 (0==0) -> max_candies=0+(2-1-1)=0.\n            then s1<=s2 -> true: s1=1, p1=1 -> now p1=1, p2=1: still in loop? \n            then s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n            then s1>s2 -> true: so we do s2+=l[1]=1, p2=0 -> now p1=1, p2=0 -> then condition p1<=p2? 1<=0 -> false -> break.\n            then we check: s1==s2? 1==1 -> true, so we update max_candies = 1 + (2-1-0)=2.\n            then print 2.\n\n          So that works.\n\n          But note: the condition after the loop: we check if s1==s2 and p1>p2? Actually, after the loop we always have p1>p2? Because we break when p1>p2? So we can just check s1==s2.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n          for _ in range(I()[0]):\n              n = I()[0]\n              l = I()\n              s1, s2 = 0, 0\n              p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n              max_candies = 0\n              while p1 <= p2:\n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                  if s1 <= s2:\n                      s1 += l[p1]\n                      p1 += 1\n                  else:\n                      s2 += l[p2]\n                      p2 -= 1\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              print(max_candies)\n\n          This is simpler.\n\n          But note: what if we break the loop and then s1 != s2? Then we leave max_candies as the last recorded value in the loop? Which is the last time we had equality? \n\n          Example: [1,2,3] -> \n            Initially: s1=0, s2=0 -> record max_candies=0.\n            Then we take left: s1=1, p1=1 -> now p1=1, p2=2: in loop.\n            Then s1=1, s2=0 -> take right: s2=3, p2=1 -> now p1=1, p2=1: in loop.\n            Then s1=1, s2=3 -> take left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2 -> now p1=2, p2=1 -> break.\n            Then we check: s1=3, s2=3 -> equal? Then update max_candies = 2 + (3-1-1)=2+1=3? \n            But the total candies: Alice took [0,1] -> 2 candies, Bob took [2] -> 1 candy? total=3? \n            And the weights: Alice: 1+2=3, Bob:3 -> equal? So that's valid? Then the answer is 3.\n\n          But the problem: the candies are [1,2,3]. Alice must take contiguous from the left: she can take [1] or [1,2] or [1,2,3]. Bob from the right: [3] or [2,3] or [1,2,3]. \n          If Alice takes [1,2] (weight=3) and Bob takes [3] (weight=3), then total candies=3. So that's the maximum? \n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n          We'll write:\n\n          for _ in range(I()[0]):\n              n = I()[0]\n              l = I()\n              s1, s2 = 0, 0\n              p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n              max_candies = 0\n              while p1 <= p2:\n                  if s1 == s2:\n                      max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # record the current total\n                  if s1 <= s2:\n                      s1 += l[p1]\n                      p1 += 1\n                  else:\n                      s2 += l[p2]\n                      p2 -= 1\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              print(max_candies)\n\n          But note: the initial code had a variable `l2` that we don't use. We remove it.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from `s1,s2=0,0` to the print, but we have to replace the existing while loop and the print.\n\n          Specifically, we replace:\n\n          l2=[]\n          s1,s2=0,0\n          p1,p2=0,n-1\n          while (p1-1<=p2):\n              if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n              if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n              if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n          print(l2[-1])\n\n          with:\n\n          s1,s2=0,0\n          p1,p2=0,n-1\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n          print(max_candies)\n\n          But note: the condition in the while loop: we changed from `(p1-1<=p2)` to `p1<=p2`.\n\n          And we removed the `l2` line.\n\n          So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n          s1,s2=0,0\n          p1,p2=0,n-1\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n          print(max_candies)\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". And the existing code has the for loop and the input reading. We are only replacing the block after `l2=[]` and before the print.\n\n          However, we are removing the `l2=[]` line. So we must include that removal? \n\n          Alternatively, we can leave the `l2=[]` line and then overwrite? But that's unnecessary. We remove it.\n\n          Therefore, the completion for program1.py is the above block without the `l2=[]` line.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the entire block that is missing? Actually, the problem says: \"with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in\". And the provided code has a TODO.\n\n          We are replacing the entire block from the line `l2=[]` to the `print(l2[-1])`? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n          So we output the code that replaces the part from after `l = I()` to the end of the for loop body? \n\n          Specifically, we output:\n\n          s1,s2=0,0\n          p1,p2=0,n-1\n          max_candies = 0\n          while p1 <= p2:\n              if s1 == s2:\n                  max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n              if s1 <= s2:\n                  s1 += l[p1]\n                  p1 += 1\n              else:\n                  s2 += l[p2]\n                  p2 -= 1\n          if s1 == s2:\n              max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n          print(max_candies)\n\n          But note: the existing code has `l2=[]` and then the while loop. We are removing `l2=[]` and replacing the while loop and the print.\n\n          So that block is the completion for program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  The problem is about an infinite grid and a non-increasing sequence a_i. The grid cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x, and black otherwise. We start with one doll at (0,0). We can do operations: remove a doll at (x,y) and place two dolls at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). The goal is to have 0 dolls on every white cell. We want the minimum number of operations modulo 10^9+7.\n\n  The provided code:\n\n      N = 4 * 10**5 + 5\n      MOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n      fact = [1]\n      invf = [1]\n\n      for i in range(1, N):\n          fact.append(fact[i-1] * i % MOD)\n          invf.append(pow(fact[-1], MOD-2, MOD))\n\n      def C(m, n):\n          if n < 0 or m < n:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n      n = int(input())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      ans = sum(C(v+i, i+1) for i, v in enumerate(a)) % MOD\n      print(ans)\n\n  The TODO is in the C(m,n) function: we need to return 0 when n<0 or m<n? Because the binomial coefficient is 0 in that case.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\n  Then the rest of the code: it computes the answer as the sum over i from 0 to n of C(a_i + i, i+1) mod MOD.\n\n  But note: the problem says the sequence a is non-increasing and we are given a_0, a_1, ..., a_n, and for i>n, a_i=0.\n\n  The example: n=1, and a = [2,1] (because n=1, so we have two numbers: a0, a1). Then the answer is 5? \n\n  The code: \n      i=0: C(2+0, 0+1) = C(2,1)=2\n      i=1: C(1+1,1+1)=C(2,2)=1\n      total=3? but the example says 5 operations.\n\n  So what's the correct formula?\n\n  The note in the problem says: one of the optimal sequences has 5 operations.\n\n  The example: n=1? Actually, the input: the first line is n, then n+1 integers. So for the first example, n=1? Then the input would be:\n      1\n      2 1\n\n  Then the code computes: \n      i=0: C(2+0,1)=C(2,1)=2\n      i=1: C(1+1,2)=C(2,2)=1\n      total=3.\n\n  But the example says 5 operations.\n\n  Therefore, the provided formula might be incorrect? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Print the answer modulo 10^9+7\", and the example output is 5.\n\n  So what is the correct solution?\n\n  After reading known similar problems: this is a known problem from a contest. The solution is:\n\n      ans = 0\n      for i in range(n+1):\n          if a[i] > i:\n              ans = (ans + C(a[i]+i, i+1)) % MOD\n\n      But wait, the example: a0=2, a1=1. Then for i=0: a0=2>0 -> true: add C(2,1)=2.\n                i=1: a1=1>1? false -> skip.\n                total=2.\n\n  That's not 5.\n\n  Alternatively, the known solution for the problem \"CF1534E\" or similar? \n\n  Actually, the problem is \"CF1534C\" or \"CF1534D\"? \n\n  After checking: the problem is from Codeforces Round #729 (Div.2) - Problem C. \n\n  The known solution: \n      ans = 0\n      for i in range(len(a)):\n          if a[i] > i:   # but note: the sequence is non-increasing, so a[0] is the largest? \n              break\n          ans = (ans + C(i, a[i]) ) % MOD   # or something else?\n\n  Actually, the known solution for the problem \"Dolls\" (which is the name in the note) is:\n\n      ans = 0\n      for i in range(n+1):\n          if i==0 or a[i] < a[i-1]:   # because the sequence is non-increasing, but we are given that it is non-increasing? \n          # Actually, we are guaranteed non-increasing? \n          # Then we can use:\n          if a[i] > i: \n              continue   # skip? \n          # Then we add C(i - a[i] + ??? ) \n\n  Alternatively, the known solution from the editorial:\n\n      The answer is: sum_{i=0}^{inf} C(i + a_i, i+1)   but then we have to consider that a_i is non-increasing and becomes 0? \n\n  But the example: \n      n=1, a=[2,1]\n      i=0: C(0+2, 0+1)=C(2,1)=2\n      i=1: C(1+1,1+1)=C(2,2)=1\n      i>=2: a_i=0, so C(i+0, i+1)=C(i, i+1)=0 (by our C function) \n      total=3.\n\n  But the expected answer is 5.\n\n  So the formula might be different.\n\n  After reading the note: the example has 5 operations. The grid: \n      white cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) -> because a0=2 -> y<2: y=0,1; a1=1 -> y<1: y=0. But wait, the problem says: \n          cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x.\n      So for x=0: y<2 -> y=0,1 -> (0,0) and (0,1) are white.\n      for x=1: y<1 -> y=0 -> (1,0) is white.\n      for x>=2: a_x=0 -> no white cells.\n\n      So white cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0).\n\n      But the note says: \"cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\" -> that doesn't match? \n\n  Actually, the example input: \n      n=1, a0=2, a1=1 -> then a0=2, a1=1, and for i>=2, a_i=0.\n\n      Then (0,0): y=0<2 -> white.\n      (0,1): y=1<2 -> white.\n      (0,2): y=2<2 -> false -> black.\n      (1,0): y=0<1 -> white.\n      (1,1): y=1<1 -> false -> black.\n      (1,2): black.\n      (2,0): y=0<0 -> false -> black.\n\n      So the white cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). \n\n  But the note says: (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white? That implies a0>=2 and a1>=2? \n\n  The example in the note: \n      \"In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\"\n\n      So a0 must be at least 2? and a1 must be at least 2? \n\n  But the input: \n      The first line: n=1 -> then a0, a1 are given? \n      Then a0=2, a1=2? \n\n  But the example says: \n      \"Consider the first example. ... Let us use triples ... Initially the state of the grid is (0,0,1).\"\n\n      Then after 5 operations, we have no dolls on white cells.\n\n  So the input for the first example might be:\n      n=1\n      a0=2, a1=2   # then a_i=0 for i>=2.\n\n      Then the grid: \n        (0,0): white, (0,1): white, (0,2): black.\n        (1,0): white, (1,1): white, (1,2): black.\n        (2,y): black for all y.\n\n      Then the white cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n\n      Then the code:\n\n          i=0: C(2+0,1)=C(2,1)=2\n          i=1: C(2+1,2)=C(3,2)=3\n          total=5.\n\n      That matches.\n\n  Therefore, the formula is: \n        ans = sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i + i, i+1)   [mod 10^9+7]\n\n  And the C function should return 0 when n<0 or m<n.\n\n  So the TODO in program2.py is to complete the C function:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\n  But note: the function parameters: the function is defined as C(m, n). So the condition is: if n<0 or m<n.\n\n  So we write:\n\n      def C(m, n):\n          if n < 0 or m < n:\n              return 0\n          return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n  That's it.\n\n  But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". In program2.py, the missing block is only the two lines in the TODO.\n\n  However, the provided code has:\n\n      def C(m, n):\n          if n < 0 or m < n:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          return fact[m] * invf[n] % MOD * invf[m-n] % MOD\n\n  We are to replace the TODO line with the two lines? Or just the condition and return 0? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\n  So the completion for program2.py is:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\n  But note: the existing code has the comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", which we remove.\n\n  So we output:\n\n      if n < 0 or m < n:\n          return 0\n\n  And that's the only missing block.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n  For program1.py: the block of code that we determined.\n\n  For program2.py: the two lines.\n\n  In JSON format:\n\n  {\n      \"program1\": \"s1,s2=0,0\\np1,p2=0,n-1\\nmax_candies = 0\\nwhile p1 <= p2:\\n    if s1 == s2:\\n        max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\n    if s1 <= s2:\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\\n    else:\\n        s2 += l[p2]\\n        p2 -= 1\\nif s1 == s2:\\n    max_candies = p1 + (n-1-p2)\\nprint(max_candies)\",\n      \"program2\": \"if n < 0 or m < n:\\n    return 0\"\n  }\n\n  But note: the program1.py block: we have to be careful with the indentation? We use 4 spaces per level? Or the same as the context? The existing code uses 4 spaces.\n\n  We output the string exactly as it would appear in the program.\n\n  However, the existing program1.py has the line `l2=[]` which we are replacing? But in our completion, we omit that line. And we replace the while loop and the print.\n\n  And for program2.py, we output the two lines that replace the TODO.\n\n  But note: in program2.py, the TODO is inside the function. We are replacing the TODO comment with the two lines.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer."
