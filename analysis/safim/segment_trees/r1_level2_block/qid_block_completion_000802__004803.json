But the total over test cases is 200000, so the maximum number of test cases is 20000, but the strings are short on average. But the problem says: the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000. So we can do an O(n) or O(n*alphabet) solution per test case? The alphabet is 26. But note: the condition must hold for every substring? There are O(n^2) substrings. We cannot iterate over all. We need an insight.

For 'b': [1,3] -> substring = s[1:4] = \"bcb\", distinct = {'b','c'} -> which is not D (because D has 'a') -> bad_found -> \"NO\". But wait, the example \"abcba\" should be bad? Because the substring \"bcb\" has distinct = {'b','c'} and misses 'a'. Then for u='a' and v='b', we have |0-2|=2>1 -> bad. So \"NO\" is correct. But what about \"aabba\": \n  D = {'a','b'}\n  For 'a': positions [0,1,4] -> \n      consecutive pairs: [0,1]: substring = \"aa\" -> distinct={'a'} ! = D -> bad -> break -> \"NO\". But note: we break at the first bad substring. However, the provided code in program2.py has a different structure:\n\n  t = int(input()) while (t > 0):\n      t -= 1\n      s = str(input())\n      var = set(s)\n      ans = \"YES\"\n      for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n          if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) ! = len(var):\n              # TODO:",

Then we move the pointers:\n- If lsum < rsum, we move the left pointer to the right and add the next candy to Alice.\n- If rsum < lsum, we move the right pointer to the left and add the next candy to Bob.\n- If they are equal, we record the current total candies eaten (i+1 from left and n-j from right, so total = (i+1) + (n-j)) and then we move the left pointer (or right, but the code moves left) to try for a longer sequence.\n\nHowever, note that when they are equal, we record the current count and then we move the left pointer (as in the provided code). But we must also consider that after moving the left pointer, we break the equality and then we continue. We are to maximize the total number of candies.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total candies eaten is the number of candies Alice eats plus the number of candies Bob eats. And we are to maximize that.\n\nThe provided code has a TODO in the `elif rsum < lsum` block. We need to complete that block similarly to the `lsum < rsum` case.\n\nAlso note: the initial setup is that we start with lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[n-1]. Then we enter the while loop (i < j). In the case of equality, we set best = i + (n-1-j) + 2. Why +2? Because i is the current left index (0-indexed) and j is the current right index (0-indexed). The number of candies Alice has eaten is i+1 (from index0 to index i) and Bob has eaten n-j (from index j to the end). So total = (i+1) + (n-j). But note that i starts at 0 and j at n-1, so initially: \n  Alice: 1 candy, Bob: 1 candy -> total=2.\n\nBut note: when we are at indices i and j, we have already included those. So the count for Alice is i+1 and for Bob is n-j.\n\nSo the total is (i+1) + (n-j) = i + 1 + n - j.\n\nBut in the code: \n  best = i + (n-1-j) + 2 \n        = i + n - 1 - j + 2 \n        = i - j + n + 1 \nwhich is not the same as (i+1) + (n-j) = i+1+n-j = i+n-j+1.\n\nActually, (n-1-j) is the number of candies from j to the end? Actually, the candies Bob has eaten are from j to the end, which is n - j (because j is 0-indexed, so the last candy is at index n-1, and the number of candies from j to n-1 is (n-1 - j + 1) = n - j). So the total is (i+1) + (n-j) = i+1+n-j.\n\nBut the code does: i + (n-1-j) + 2 = i + n - 1 - j + 2 = i + n - j + 1, which is the same. So that is correct.\n\nNow, what is missing?\nWe have to complete the `elif rsum < lsum` block. We should do:\n    j -= 1\n    rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because we are in a while loop with condition i < j. Also, we must update the sums accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, we must note that after the while loop, we print `best`. However, what if there is no equality? Then best remains 0. But note: it is possible that the best is 0? Actually, the problem says they want to eat the same total weight. It is possible that they cannot eat any candy? But note: they can choose to eat zero candies? However, the problem says \"non-zero\" in the note? Actually, the note says \"they can't skip candies\" meaning they have to eat contiguous from the end, but they can choose to eat zero? Actually, the problem says \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" meaning she can choose 0? But the problem also says \"they want to be fair\" meaning same total weight. If both eat 0, then they are fair. But the problem says \"the most number of candies\", so 0 is the minimum. We are to maximize.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" and the example: the answer is 2.\n\nSo 0 is a valid answer only when they cannot find any non-zero solution? But the problem does not require non-zero? However, the note says \"non-zero\" in the example? Actually, the example says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\" and the answer is 2. So they are eating at least one each? \n\nBut the problem does not explicitly say they must eat at least one. However, the problem says \"they can eat\" meaning they can choose zero? But the condition of fairness (0=0) is satisfied. However, the problem says \"the most number\", so if we can get 2, that's better than 0.\n\nIn the code, we start with lsum=arr[0] and rsum=arr[n-1]. So we are already considering at least one candy for each. But what if n==1? Then we have i=0, j=0 -> but the while condition is i<j, so we skip. Then we print best=0. But for n=1, they cannot both eat because the candy is only one. So the answer should be 0. That is correct.\n\nBut what if we have a solution with one candy for Alice and zero for Bob? That is not allowed because Bob must eat from the right and if Alice eats the first candy, then Bob has nothing? But the problem says Bob eats from the right. So if Alice eats the first candy, then the candy is gone and Bob has nothing. Similarly, if Bob eats the last candy, then Alice has nothing. So they cannot both eat if the candy is the same one. Therefore, the only way to have a solution is when they eat distinct sets of candies (so the sets are disjoint and from opposite ends). Therefore, the solution must have at least one candy from the left and one from the right? Actually, the problem says: Alice eats from the left (any contiguous from the left) and Bob from the right (any contiguous from the right). They cannot eat the same candy. So the candies they eat must be two disjoint contiguous segments: one at the beginning and one at the end.\n\nTherefore, the minimum they can eat is 0 (if they both eat zero) but that is not the maximum. We are to maximize. And the problem does not require that they must eat? So if they can eat at least one candy each, then we have a solution of 2. But if they cannot, then 0.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"the most number of candies\", so we are to maximize the total.\n\nIn the code, we start with one candy for each. Then we try to extend. But what if we have a solution where one of them eats zero? Then we would not enter the while loop? And best remains 0. But that is acceptable because 0 is the answer.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number\" meaning including zero? But then Bob can also eat zero. So 0 is a valid solution. But the problem says \"the most number\", so if we can get 2, we prefer 2. The algorithm is designed to look for solutions where both eat at least one.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that both must eat at least one? They can choose to eat zero. But then the total is 0. However, we are to maximize the total number of candies. So we are looking for the maximum total. The algorithm is designed to consider at least one candy for each. But what if we have a solution with more than one candy for one and zero for the other? That is not possible because if one eats zero, then the other must eat zero to have the same weight (0). So the total is 0. But we can have a solution with two candies (one each) if the weights are equal? So we are already considering that.\n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py:\n\nWe complete the missing block with:\n    j -= 1\n    rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: we must be cautious of the index. We are at j, and we want to move j to the left, so we do j -= 1 and then add arr[j] (which is the next candy to the left).\n\nHowever, there is a potential issue: the while loop condition is i < j. When we do j -= 1, we might break the condition? But the condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration.\n\nBut note: what if we have updated and then i and j become equal? Then we break and we don't process further.\n\nAlso, we must note that we update the sums and then the next iteration we check again.\n\nBut there is a bug: in the equality case, we update the best and then we move the left pointer. But what if after moving the left pointer, we break the condition? We should also consider moving the right pointer? Actually, the problem is symmetric. The solution in the note for the first test case: [1,2,1] -> Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [1] -> total=2. But what if we have [1,1,1]? \n  Initially: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0+ (n-1 - (n-1)) + 2 = 0+0+2 = 2.\n  Then we move i to 1: lsum becomes 1+1=2, then we compare: 2>1 -> then we move j: j becomes n-2, rsum becomes 1+1=2 -> then we have i=1, j=n-2 (which is 1) -> then we check: 2==2 -> then best = 1 + (n-1-1) + 2 = 1 + (n-2) + 2 = 1 + (3-2) + 2 = 1+1+2=4? But n=3, so total=4? That is not possible because there are only 3 candies.\n\nWait, let me recalc: \n  n=3, arr=[1,1,1]\n  Step1: i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0 + (3-1-2) + 2? \n      Actually, the code: \n          best = i + (n-1-j) + 2 \n          i=0, j=2 -> 0 + (3-1-2) + 2 = 0 + (0) + 2 = 2 -> correct.\n      Then we do: i=1, lsum=1+arr[1]=2.\n      Now i=1, j=2: then we have lsum=2, rsum=1 -> so we move j: j becomes 1 -> but then i=1 and j=1 -> break. \n      So we never get the second equality.\n\nBut note: when we have i=1 and j=2, we break the condition? Actually, the condition is i<j -> 1<2 -> true. Then we do the update: because lsum=2>1, we do j-=1 -> j=1, then rsum += arr[1] -> rsum=1+1=2. Then we break the loop because i=1 and j=1 -> next iteration i<j fails.\n\nBut we missed the opportunity to record the equality at i=1 and j=1? Actually, when we update j to 1, we break the loop. But note: we are in the same iteration? After updating, we break the loop? Actually, the while loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration. So after updating j and rsum, we break the loop? Then we don't check the condition again.\n\nBut we have an equality at the moment we update? We don't check. So we need to check after updating? Actually, we can move the check for equality to after the updates? But the code structure is:\n\n  while i < j:\n      if lsum < rsum: ... \n      elif rsum < lsum: ... \n      else: ... \n\nSo we only check at the beginning of the loop.\n\nTherefore, we might miss the case when we update and then become equal? Actually, no: because after updating, we break the loop? But we don't break the loop immediately after updating; we break at the next iteration. However, we have updated the sums and then the next iteration we check again? But in the next iteration, we check the condition and then we check the sums.\n\nBut in the example [1,1,1]:\n  After the first equality (i=0, j=2): we set best=2, then we update i to 1 and lsum=2.\n  Then we enter the loop again: i=1, j=2 -> i<j -> true.\n      Now lsum=2, rsum=1 -> so we do the elif block: j becomes 1, rsum becomes 1+arr[1]=2.\n      Then we break the loop? No, we break the loop only at the next iteration? Actually, we do the update and then the loop ends? Then we go to the top: i=1, j=1 -> i<j is false -> so we break.\n\nBut we never check the state when i=1 and j=1? Actually, we don't need to because the candies must be disjoint. When i and j meet, they are the same candy, so we cannot have both.\n\nBut what if we have an even length? For example, [1,1,1,1]: \n  Start: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best=0+(4-1-3)+2 = 0+0+2=2 -> then i=1, lsum=2.\n  Then i=1, j=3: lsum=2, rsum=1 -> move j: j=2, rsum=1+arr[2]=1+1=2 -> now i=1, j=2 -> i<j -> true.\n      Now lsum=2, rsum=2 -> equal -> best = 1 + (4-1-2) + 2 = 1+1+2=4 -> then we move i: i=2, lsum=2+arr[2]=3.\n      Then i=2, j=2 -> break.\n\nSo we get 4.\n\nBut 4 is the total? Alice ate [1,1] (the first two) and Bob ate [1,1] (the last two). That is valid.\n\nSo the code for program1.py is:\n\nIn the elif block: \n    j -= 1\n    rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: we must be cautious that j might become less than i? Actually, we do j-=1 and then the next iteration we check i<j. So if j becomes i, we break.\n\nBut what if j becomes less than i? Then we break the loop and that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n    j -= 1\n    rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: the problem constraints say that the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so the two pointers will run in O(n) per test case and overall O(total_n) which is acceptable.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are to determine if a string s is perfectly balanced. The condition: for every substring t and for every two characters u, v in the entire string s, the absolute difference between the frequency of u and v in t is at most 1.\n\nHowever, note the problem says: \"for all possible triplets (t, u, v) such that t is a non-empty substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\". \n\nBut note: the entire string s? Actually, the set of characters u and v are from the entire string s? But the substring t might not contain u or v? Then the frequency of u in t might be 0. The condition: |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\nBut if u is not in t, then f_t(u)=0. Similarly for v. So if t does not contain u and v, then |0-0|=0<=1 -> okay.\nIf t contains u but not v, then |f_t(u)-0| = f_t(u). This must be <=1? So f_t(u) must be 1? Similarly, if t contains v but not u, then f_t(v) must be 1? \n\nBut wait: what if t has two u's? Then |2-0|=2>1 -> not allowed. Therefore, in any substring t, if a character u appears, it must appear at most once? And similarly, if two different characters u and v appear, then they must appear at most once? Actually, the condition must hold for every pair of characters that are present in the entire string s. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"u and v are characters present in s\". So we consider every pair of distinct characters that appear anywhere in s? And also for the same character? Actually, if u and v are the same? The problem says \"u and v are characters present in s\", so they can be the same? Then |f_t(u) - f_t(u)| = 0 <=1 -> always true. So we only care about distinct u and v? \n\nBut the condition does not specify distinct? So we must consider u and v arbitrarily (including the same). But the same is always 0. So effectively, we only need to worry about distinct u and v.\n\nTherefore, the condition is: for every substring t and for every distinct pair of characters u, v that appear in s, we must have |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\nBut note: if a substring t contains a character u, then the frequency of u in t is at least 1. And if it does not contain v, then the frequency of v is 0. Then |f_t(u)-0| = f_t(u) must be <=1. Therefore, in any substring t, no character can appear more than once? Because if u appears twice, then for any v that is not in t, we have |2-0|=2>1. Also, if t contains two u's and one v, then |2-1|=1 -> acceptable? But wait, what if we have a third character w that is not in t? Then |2-0|=2>1 -> not acceptable. Therefore, the substring t must contain every character that appears in s? \n\nBut that is not possible because we can take a substring of length 1? Then it contains only one character. Then for that substring, for the character that is in the substring (say u) and for a character not in the substring (say v), we have |1-0|=1 -> acceptable. But if we take a substring of length 2 that has two of the same character, say \"aa\", then for u='a' and v='b' (if 'b' is in s), we have |2-0|=2>1 -> not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the condition implies that no substring of length>=2 can have two of the same character? Actually, that is too strong? Because what if the entire string has only one character? Then for any substring, we have only one character. Then for u and v: if u and v are the same, then |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|=0. But if u and v are distinct? Then one of them is the character in the string and the other is not? But wait: the entire string has only one character, so the set of characters in s is {a}. Then we only consider u and v in {a}. So we only have (a,a) -> 0. So it's acceptable? \n\nBut the example: \"abb\" is not acceptable. And \"aba\" is acceptable.\n\nSo what is the pattern?\n\nObservation: \n1. In any substring t, the frequency of any character that appears in t must be at most 1? Because if a character appears twice, then for any character that does not appear in t (and there must be at least one character in s that does not appear in t? Not necessarily: what if the entire string has only one character? Then every substring has only that character and no other character is present in s? Then we don't have a v that is not in t? \n\nBut note: the condition is for every pair of characters u and v that are present in s. If the entire string has only one character, then the set of characters in s is {a}. Then we only consider pairs (a,a) -> which is always 0. So it's acceptable.\n\nBut what if the entire string has two distinct characters? Then for a substring t that has two 'a's and no 'b', then for u='a' and v='b', we have |2-0|=2>1 -> not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the condition breaks if there is a substring that has two of the same character and misses at least one character that appears in the entire string.\n\nBut note: the condition must hold for every substring. So if the entire string has two distinct characters, then every substring must contain both characters? That is impossible for a substring of length 1. \n\nTherefore, the condition can only be satisfied if the entire string has at most one distinct character? But the example \"abc\" is acceptable. \n\nLet me check \"abc\": \n  The characters in s: {'a','b','c'}.\n  Substrings of length 1: \n      \"a\": for u and v in {'a','b','c'}:\n          |f_t(a)-f_t(b)| = |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n          |f_t(a)-f_t(c)| = |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n          |f_t(b)-f_t(c)| = |0-0|=0 -> acceptable? Actually, we must consider every pair? So we have to check (a,b), (a,c), (b,c) and also the same? But same is 0. So all are <=1.\n  Substrings of length 2:\n      \"ab\": \n          a:1, b:1, c:0 -> \n          |a-b|=0, |a-c|=1, |b-c|=1 -> acceptable.\n      \"bc\": similarly acceptable.\n  Substrings of length 3: \n      \"abc\": a:1, b:1, c:1 -> all differences 0 -> acceptable.\n\nSo \"abc\" is acceptable.\n\nBut what about \"aab\"? \n  Characters: {'a','b'}.\n  Substring \"aa\": \n      a:2, b:0 -> |a-b|=2>1 -> not acceptable.\n\nSo the condition is that no substring can have two of the same character? But then \"abc\" is acceptable because it has all distinct? \n\nBut what about \"aba\"? \n  Characters: {'a','b'}.\n  Substring \"aba\": \n      a:2, b:1 -> |a-b|=1 -> acceptable? \n  But also check other substrings:\n      \"a\": |a-b|=1 -> acceptable.\n      \"b\": |a-b|=1 -> acceptable? Actually, in \"b\": a:0, b:1 -> |0-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n      \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> acceptable.\n      \"ba\": same as \"ab\".\n      \"aa\": does not appear? Actually, the substring \"aa\" is not in \"aba\". \n\nBut wait: the string \"aba\" has substrings: \n  \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"aba\". \n  There is no \"aa\". \n\nSo the condition is that no two adjacent characters can be the same? Actually, if two same characters are adjacent, then we have a substring \"aa\" which is bad. But what if they are not adjacent? \n\nExample: \"abcba\": \n  Consider the substring \"aba\": \n      a:2, b:1 -> |a-b|=1 -> acceptable? \n  But what about the substring \"aa\"? There is no contiguous substring \"aa\". \n  However, what about the substring from index0 to index4: \"abcba\": \n      a:2, b:2, c:1 -> \n          |a-c|=|2-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n          |b-c|=|2-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n          |a-b|=0 -> acceptable.\n\nBut what about the substring \"abcb\": \n      a:1, b:2, c:1 -> \n          |a-b|=|1-2|=1 -> acceptable.\n          |a-c|=0 -> acceptable.\n          |b-c|=1 -> acceptable.\n\nBut what about the substring \"bcb\": \n      b:2, c:1 -> |b-c|=1 -> acceptable.\n\nSo it seems acceptable? \n\nBut wait: the condition must hold for every pair of characters that are in the entire string. The entire string has 'a','b','c'. In the substring \"bcb\", we have b:2, c:1, and a:0. Then:\n  |a-b| = |0-2| = 2 -> not acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the substring \"bcb\" breaks the condition because for u='a' and v='b', we have |0-2|=2>1.\n\nSo the condition is very strong: every substring must contain every character that appears in the entire string? But that is impossible for a substring of length 1? \n\nBut note: the problem says \"u and v are characters present in s\". So we must consider every pair of characters that appear in s, even if they are not in the substring? Then the condition applies even when one of the characters is not in the substring.\n\nTherefore, the condition is: for every substring t and for every pair of characters u, v that appear in the entire string s, we have |f_t(u) - f_t(v)| <= 1.\n\nThis implies:\n  In any substring t, the frequency of any character that appears in s must be either 0 or 1? Because if a character u appears 2 times in t, then for a character v that does not appear in t (if such v exists in s), we have |2-0|=2>1. \n\nBut what if the entire string s has only one character? Then we don't have such v? Then it's acceptable? \n\nBut if the entire string s has two or more distinct characters, then for any substring t, if t misses a character v that is in s, then every character u that appears in t must appear exactly once? And also, if a character u appears in t, then it must appear at most once? \n\nBut also, if a substring t contains two distinct characters, then it must contain every character? Because if it misses one, then for the character u that appears twice (if that happens) and the missing character v, we have |2-0|=2. \n\nTherefore, the condition breaks if:\n  There exists a substring t that does not contain all the characters of s and contains at least one character twice? \n\nBut also, if a substring t contains all the characters of s, then we can have multiple? But note: if a substring t contains all the characters, then the frequency of each character must be at most 1? Because if one character appears twice, then for a character that appears once, we have |2-1|=1 -> acceptable? But wait, what about a third character? If there are three characters, and one appears twice and the others once, then the difference between the twice and the once is 1 -> acceptable. But what about the difference between the twice and a character that is not in the substring? But the substring contains all characters? So there is no character missing? \n\nTherefore, the condition for a substring t that contains all the characters of s is that the frequencies can differ by at most 1? Actually, the condition is for every pair: |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1. This implies that the frequencies of the characters in t are either k or k+1 for some k? But note: the condition must hold for every pair. So the maximum frequency and the minimum frequency in t must differ by at most 1.\n\nBut the problem is that we also have substrings that do not contain all the characters. For such substrings, we require that no character appears more than once? \n\nSo the conditions for the entire string s to be perfectly balanced are:\n1. The entire string s must not contain any character more than once? -> No, because \"aba\" is acceptable and 'a' appears twice. But note: the substring \"a\" (the first one) is acceptable? But the substring \"aba\" is acceptable? But the substring \"a\" (the last one) is acceptable? But what about the substring \"aa\"? It doesn't appear in \"aba\". \n\nBut what if we have a string with two 'a's that are not adjacent? Then we can have a substring that starts at the first 'a' and ends at the last 'a'? Then that substring contains two 'a's and possibly other characters. But if the entire string has more than one distinct character, then that substring must contain all the distinct characters? And the frequencies must be balanced? \n\nBut the condition is very strong. How can we check it efficiently?\n\nNote: the problem constraints: the total length of all strings is <= 200000. But the number of test cases t can be up to 20000, but the total length is 200000, so the maximum length of one string might be 200000? But the total over test cases is 200000, so the maximum number of test cases is 20000, but the strings are short on average.\n\nBut the problem says: the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000.\n\nSo we can do an O(n) or O(n*alphabet) solution per test case? The alphabet is 26.\n\nBut note: the condition must hold for every substring? There are O(n^2) substrings. We cannot iterate over all.\n\nWe need an insight.\n\nObservation: \nThe condition fails if there exists a substring t and two characters u, v such that |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|>=2. \n\nThis can happen in two ways:\n  (a) There is a substring t that contains at least two of the same character and misses at least one character (that appears in s).\n  (b) There is a substring t that contains all the characters, but the frequencies of two characters differ by at least 2.\n\nBut note: (a) is the most common? Because (b) might be rare? \n\nActually, (a) is easier to check: we can look for any substring of length 2 that has the same character? Then if we have \"aa\", then for any character v that is in s and not in \"aa\" (if there is at least one other character in s), then |2-0|=2>1 -> fails. But if the entire string has only one character, then we don't have such v? So it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, if the string has at least two distinct characters, then any two consecutive characters must be distinct? Because if we have two consecutive same characters, then the substring \"aa\" fails.\n\nBut what about non consecutive? Consider \"aba\": \n  The characters: 'a','b'. \n  The substring \"aa\" does not appear? But the two a's are separated by a b. \n  However, we can take the substring \"aba\": \n      a:2, b:1 -> |a-b|=1 -> acceptable? \n  But what about the pair (a, b) in the substring \"aba\": acceptable. \n  But what about the substring that is the entire string? It's acceptable.\n\nBut wait: we must check for every pair? In the substring \"aba\", we have a:2, b:1 -> acceptable. But what about the substring that is the first and the last a? That substring is \"aba\" (if we take the entire string) or we can take the substring from the first a to the last a? That is \"aba\", which we already checked.\n\nBut what if we have \"abba\": \n  Characters: 'a','b'. \n  Check substring \"bb\": \n      a:0, b:2 -> |a-b|=2>1 -> fails.\n\nTherefore, if the string has two consecutive same characters and the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then we have a bad substring.\n\nBut what if the entire string has only one distinct character? Then we don't have a v that is not in the substring? So it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, condition (a) fails only when there is a duplicate (two consecutive same) and the entire string has at least two distinct characters.\n\nBut what about non consecutive duplicates? \n  Example: \"abcabc\" ... we have duplicates but not consecutive? \n  Consider the substring \"a\" (the first one) and the substring \"a\" (the last one) is not contiguous? \n  But we can take a substring that covers two a's? For example, the entire string? \n      Then we have a:2, b:2, c:2 -> acceptable? \n  But what if we take a substring that covers two a's and one b? \n      For example, \"abca\": \n          a:2, b:1, c:1 -> \n          |a-b|=1, |a-c|=1, |b-c|=0 -> acceptable.\n\nBut what if we take a substring that covers two a's and misses one character? \n  The entire string has three distinct characters. So if we take a substring that misses one character, say we miss 'c', then we have a substring that has only 'a' and 'b'. \n  Example: the substring \"ab\" (the first two) is acceptable. \n  But what about the substring \"a\" (the first one) -> acceptable. \n  What about the substring \"aa\"? There is no contiguous \"aa\". \n  But what about the substring from the first a to the last a? That is \"abc a\" -> \"abca\", which has a:2, b:1, c:1 -> and we have the character 'c' in the substring? So it doesn't miss any character? \n\nBut what if we have a string with four distinct characters: \"abcd\" and we have two a's? Then we can take a substring that starts at the first a and ends at the second a? Then the substring contains a:2, and the other characters? But if the two a's are not consecutive, then the substring will contain at least the characters between them? So it will contain all the characters that appear between the two a's? But we might not have the entire set? \n\nExample: \"a b c d a\" -> the substring from the first a to the last a is \"abcda\", which contains all the characters. Then the frequencies: a:2, b:1, c:1, d:1 -> acceptable? \n\nBut what if we have \"a b a d\"? \n  The entire string has characters: {'a','b','d'}.\n  The substring \"aba\": \n      a:2, b:1, d:0 -> \n          |a-d|=|2-0|=2>1 -> fails.\n\nTherefore, we have a bad substring: \"aba\" (which is from index0 to index2) because it has two a's and misses the character 'd'. \n\nSo the condition fails if there exists a substring that contains two of the same character and misses at least one character that appears in the entire string.\n\nHow to check for this? \n\nWe can do:\n  For each distinct character c, we can look for two occurrences of c that are close enough such that not all distinct characters of s appear between them? \n\nBut note: the entire string has a set of distinct characters, say D. The substring between two occurrences of c (including both) must contain all the distinct characters? Otherwise, we have a bad substring.\n\nBut what if the two occurrences of c are adjacent? Then the substring is \"cc\", which has length 2. Then we require that the substring \"cc\" contains all distinct characters? But if |D|>1, then it cannot contain all distinct characters? So it fails.\n\nSimilarly, if the two occurrences of c are separated by k characters, then the substring has length = k+2. The distinct characters in that substring must be the entire set D? \n\nTherefore, for each character c, the gap between two consecutive occurrences of c must be large enough to cover all distinct characters? \n\nBut note: we can also have non consecutive occurrences? We have to check every pair? That would be O(n^2). \n\nBut note: the total length of all strings is 200000. However, the worst-case for one string: if the string has 200000 characters, and we have to check every pair of same character? That would be O(n^2) per character? And if a character appears many times, the number of pairs is O(n^2) per character? Then overall O(n^2) per test case? That is too slow.\n\nWe need a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: \n  The condition fails if there exists a substring t that contains two of the same character and does not contain all distinct characters of s.\n\nWe can try to check for minimal bad substrings. The minimal bad substring would be of the form: \n  [c ... c] (with no c in between) and the distinct characters in between are not the entire set? \n\nBut note: the substring must be contiguous. \n\nWe can do:\n  Let D = set(s) and let m = len(D).\n  We know that if m==1, then we are safe? \n  If m>=2, then we must avoid any two consecutive same characters? But we saw that even non consecutive can be bad.\n\nBut note: the minimal bad substring might be of length at most m+1? Why? \n  Consider: we have a substring that starts and ends with the same character c, and the inner part has at most m-1 distinct characters? Then the entire substring has distinct characters = {c} union (the inner distinct) which is at most m? But if it is less than m, then we are missing at least one character? \n\nBut the entire substring must be contiguous. \n\nTherefore, we can do:\n  For each distinct character c, we can record the positions where c appears.\n  Then for each consecutive occurrence of c at positions i and j (with j>i), we consider the substring s[i:j+1]. We then check the distinct characters in s[i:j+1]. If the distinct characters in that substring are not the entire set D, then we have found a bad substring.\n\nBut the total length of the string is 200000, but the total over test cases is 200000. However, the number of distinct characters per string? The worst-case distinct characters is 26. So for each character c, we can iterate over the consecutive occurrences and then check the distinct characters in the substring? \n\nHow to check distinct characters in the substring quickly? We can precompute the distinct characters in the entire string? But for each substring? The length of the substring might be long. \n\nBut note: the total length of all strings is 200000. But if we do for each consecutive occurrence of each character, and the number of consecutive occurrences for a character c is (freq(c)-1), then the total number of consecutive pairs over all characters and all test cases is (n-1) per test case? Because each character in the string is the start of a consecutive occurrence? Actually, the total number of consecutive pairs for one character c is (freq(c)-1). The sum over c of (freq(c)-1) = (n - (number of distinct characters)) <= n. And the total n over test cases is 200000. So we have 200000 consecutive pairs to check? \n\nBut for each consecutive pair, we need to know the distinct characters in the substring s[i:j+1]. We can do this with a segment tree? But that would be O(log n) per query? Then total O(200000 * log(200000)) which is acceptable? But we are in Python and the total length of all strings is 200000, but the total consecutive pairs is 200000? Then 200000*log2(200000) is about 200000*18 = 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\nBut we can do better? \n\nWe can precompute the distinct characters in the entire string? But we need for the substring. \n\nAlternatively, we can use a sliding window? But the consecutive pairs for a character c: the gap between two consecutive c's might be large. \n\nBut note: we are only interested in whether the distinct characters in the substring s[i:j+1] is the entire set D? \n\nWe can precompute the distinct characters for the entire string? Then for a substring, we can check if the distinct characters in the substring is a proper subset of D? But we need to know if it is exactly D? \n\nBut we can use a frequency array and a segment tree? Or we can use a two pointers and a frequency array? \n\nBut note: the consecutive pairs for a character c: the positions i and j. The substring s[i:j+1] is contiguous. We can use a precomputation of the distinct characters in the entire string? Then we can use a segment tree or a sparse table for distinct count? But that is heavy.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute the next occurrence of each character? \n\nBut note: we are only checking consecutive occurrences of the same character. The gap between two consecutive c's is the segment from i to j. We want to know if the distinct characters in that segment is the entire set D? \n\nWe can do: \n  Precompute an array last_occurrence for each character? \n  Precompute the next occurrence for each character? \n\nBut we can also precompute the distinct characters in the entire string: D, and |D|=m.\n\nThen, we can use a technique to check the distinct count in a segment? We can use a Fenwick tree? But we are in Python and the total number of queries is 200000, and the alphabet is 26. \n\nWe can simply iterate over the substring? The length of the substring might be long. The worst-case: a consecutive pair of c might be the entire string? Then the distinct characters in the substring is D? Then we skip. But the total length of all substrings we check? The total length of all such substrings over all consecutive pairs? The sum of (j-i+1) over all consecutive pairs? \n\nBut note: the total length of the string is n, and the consecutive pairs for a character c: the gaps. The sum of the lengths of the gaps for one character c: \n  If the positions of c are p0, p1, p2, ..., pk-1, then the consecutive pairs: (p0, p1): length = p1-p0+1, (p1, p2): length = p2-p1+1, ... \n  The total for c: (p1-p0+1) + (p2-p1+1) + ... + (p_{k-1}-p_{k-2}+1) = (p_{k-1} - p0) + (k-1). \n  Then the total over all c: \n      For each character c: the total gap length is (last_occurrence - first_occurrence) + (freq(c)-1) \n      And then we sum over c? \n\nBut note: each position in the string might be counted multiple times? Actually, the entire string might be scanned many times? \n\nThe worst-case: if the string is \"aaa...a\", then we have one character. Then we don't check? Because m=1, we skip? \n\nIf the string has two distinct characters, and one character appears n/2 times? Then the total gap length for that character: \n  The positions: p0, p1, ... p_{k-1} (k = n/2). \n  The total gap length = (p_{k-1}-p0) + (k-1) = (last - first) + (k-1) <= n + n/2 = O(n). \nThen the total over all characters: the other character? We do the same? Then total O(n). \n\nBut the total over test cases: the sum of n is 200000, so the total gap length we iterate is 200000? \n\nBut wait: we are iterating over each consecutive pair and then for the substring we are checking the distinct characters? We can do that by iterating the substring? Then the total work per consecutive pair is the length of the substring? Then the total work is the sum of the lengths of these substrings? \n\nBut the sum of the lengths of these substrings is the total gap length we defined? And that total over all consecutive pairs and all test cases is bounded by? \n\nIn one test case: \n  For one character c: the sum of the lengths of the consecutive gaps is (last_occurrence - first_occurrence) + (freq(c)-1) \n  Then the total for the entire string: \n      sum_{c in D} [ (last_occurrence(c) - first_occurrence(c)) + (freq(c)-1) ]\n\nBut note: the entire string length is n. The term (last_occurrence(c) - first_occurrence(c)) is at most n, and there are at most 26 distinct characters? So the total is at most 26*n? \n\nBut the total n over test cases is 200000, so 26*200000 = 5.2e6? That is acceptable in Python? \n\nBut worst-case: one test case with n=200000, and 26 distinct characters? Then 26*200000 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n  For each test case:\n      s = given string\n      D = set(s)\n      m = len(D)\n      if m==0: # empty string? \n          print(\"YES\")\n      elif m==1:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          # Build a list of positions for each character in the alphabet.\n          pos = {}\n          for i, char in enumerate(s):\n              if char not in pos:\n                  pos[char] = []\n              pos[char].append(i)\n\n          # We'll check for each character c that appears at least twice:\n          bad_found = False\n          for c in pos:\n              lst = pos[c]\n              if len(lst) < 2:\n                  continue\n              # Check consecutive pairs in lst\n              for idx in range(1, len(lst)):\n                  i0 = lst[idx-1]\n                  i1 = lst[idx]\n                  # substring = s[i0:i1+1]\n                  # We want to know the distinct characters in this substring.\n                  # We can extract the substring and then use set? \n                  # But the substring might be long? But the total over all consecutive pairs is 5.2e6? \n                  # Since the total length of all such substrings is bounded by 26*n (and n is the length of the string in this test case) and the total n over test cases is 200000, then the total length of all substrings we extract is 26 * (sum of n for test cases) = 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6 -> acceptable.\n                  substr = s[i0:i1+1]\n                  distinct_in_sub = set(substr)\n                  if distinct_in_sub != D:\n                      # Then we found a bad substring: s[i0:i1+1]\n                      bad_found = True\n                      break\n              if bad_found:\n                  break\n\n          if bad_found:\n              print(\"NO\")\n          else:\n              print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait: what if the entire string has two distinct characters, and we have a consecutive pair of the same character? Then the substring \"aa\" (if consecutive) has distinct characters = {'a'} which is not D (which is {'a','b'}) -> bad_found becomes True -> we print \"NO\". That matches the example \"aab\" -> \"NO\".\n\nBut what about \"aba\": \n  For 'a': positions [0,2]\n      consecutive pair: from 0 to 2 -> substring = \"aba\", distinct = {'a','b'} = D -> not bad.\n  For 'b': positions [1] -> skip.\n  Then we don't break -> print \"YES\".\n\nBut what about \"abba\": \n  For 'a': positions [0,3] -> substring = \"abba\", distinct = {'a','b'} = D -> not bad? \n  But we also have 'b': positions [1,2] -> consecutive pair: substring = s[1:3] = \"bb\", distinct = {'b'} != D -> bad_found = True -> \"NO\".\n\nThat matches.\n\nBut what about \"abcda\": \n  D = {'a','b','c','d'}\n  For 'a': positions [0,4] -> substring = \"abcda\", distinct = {'a','b','c','d'} = D -> not bad.\n  For 'b': positions [1] -> skip.\n  For 'c': positions [2] -> skip.\n  For 'd': positions [3] -> skip.\n  Then we print \"YES\".\n\nBut what about \"abcba\": \n  D = {'a','b','c'}\n  For 'a': [0,4] -> substring = \"abcba\", distinct = D -> not bad.\n  For 'b': [1,3] -> substring = s[1:4] = \"bcb\", distinct = {'b','c'} -> which is not D (because D has 'a') -> bad_found -> \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, the example \"abcba\" should be bad? Because the substring \"bcb\" has distinct = {'b','c'} and misses 'a'. Then for u='a' and v='b', we have |0-2|=2>1 -> bad. So \"NO\" is correct.\n\nBut what about \"aabba\": \n  D = {'a','b'}\n  For 'a': positions [0,1,4] -> \n      consecutive pairs: \n          [0,1]: substring = \"aa\" -> distinct={'a'} != D -> bad -> break -> \"NO\".\n\nBut note: we break at the first bad substring.\n\nHowever, the provided code in program2.py has a different structure:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  while (t > 0):\n      t -= 1\n      s = str(input())\n      var = set(s)\n      ans = \"YES\"\n      for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n          if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n      print(ans)\n\nThis code is checking every substring of length = len(var) (which is m). It checks if the distinct characters in that substring is m. If not, then it sets ans to \"NO\" and breaks? \n\nBut the note says: \n  for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n      if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\nBut the example: \n  s = \"aba\", var = {'a','b'} -> m=2.\n  We check substrings of length 2: \n      s[0:2] = \"ab\" -> set has size 2 -> skip.\n      s[1:3] = \"ba\" -> set has size 2 -> skip.\n  Then we print \"YES\".\n\nBut what about \"aab\": \n  m=2.\n  substrings of length 2:\n      s[0:2]=\"aa\" -> set has size 1 -> then we do something? \n\nThe TODO: we are to set ans to \"NO\" and break? \n\nBut the example \"aab\" should be \"NO\". \n\nBut what about \"abc\": \n  m=3, but the string length is 3, so we check only one substring: \"abc\" -> set size=3 -> skip -> \"YES\".\n\nBut what about \"abca\": \n  m=3, we check substrings of length 3:\n      \"abc\" -> 3 -> skip.\n      \"bca\" -> 3 -> skip.\n  Then we print \"YES\", but is that correct? \n      The entire string has distinct characters {'a','b','c'}.\n      Check substring \"aa\": not present? \n      But what about the substring \"abca\": \n          a:2, b:1, c:1 -> \n          |a-b|=1, |a-c|=1, |b-c|=0 -> acceptable? \n      But what about the substring \"a\" (the last one) -> acceptable? \n      But what about the substring \"aa\"? not present? \n      However, we have the substring from the first a to the last a: \"abca\", which is the entire string? \n      But also, we have the substring \"a\" (the first) and \"a\" (the last) -> acceptable.\n\nBut wait: the substring \"aa\" is not contiguous? \n\nBut what about the substring \"aca\"? \n  It is not contiguous? The string is \"a b c a\", so the substring \"aca\" is not contiguous? \n\nSo it seems that the provided code only checks contiguous substrings of length m? \n\nBut the condition requires checking all substrings. \n\nHowever, the note in the problem: \n  For the first test case we have ... \n  For the second test case we have ... \n\nBut the provided code in program2.py is checking every substring of length m? \n\nWhy length m? \n\nInsight: \n  If there is a substring of length m that does not contain all distinct characters, then we have a bad substring? Not necessarily: because we might have a substring of length m that is missing one character, but then we have a character that appears 0 times and another that appears 1 time? Then |0-1|=1 -> acceptable? \n\nBut wait: the condition fails only if there is a substring that has two of the same character and misses at least one character? But a substring of length m that misses one character? Then it has at most m-1 distinct characters. But we are checking that the distinct count is m? So if we find one that is not m, then we break? \n\nBut is that sufficient? \n\nConsider: \n  The condition fails if there is a substring that has two of the same character and misses at least one character. \n  Such a substring must have at least two of one character and zero of another, so the distinct count is at most m-1? \n  But also, the length of the substring might be greater than m? \n\nBut note: the minimal such substring might be of length 2? (if we have two consecutive same and the entire string has m>=2) -> then distinct count=1, which is less than m. \n\nBut the provided code checks only substrings of length m? \n\nSo if we have a bad substring of length 2, and m>2, then the code will not check it? \n\nExample: \"aab\" (m=2) -> the code checks substrings of length 2: \n  \"aa\" -> distinct=1 !=2 -> then we set ans=\"NO\". -> correct.\n\nBut what if we have a bad substring of length 3 in a string with m=3? \n  Example: \"aabc\" -> m=3. \n  The bad substring might be \"aa\" (length=2) -> distinct=1 !=3 -> the code does not check? \n\nBut the code checks only substrings of length 3. \n  \"aab\" -> distinct=2 (which is not 3) -> then we set ans=\"NO\". \n\nBut is \"aab\" a bad substring? \n  It has two a's and one b, and misses c. Then for u='a' and v='c', we have |2-0|=2>1 -> bad. \n\nBut the code catches it because the distinct count in \"aab\" is 2, not 3. \n\nBut what if the bad substring is of length 4? \n  Example: \"aabb\" (m=2) -> \n      The bad substring \"aa\" (length=2) -> distinct=1 !=2 -> caught.\n\n  Example: \"aaab\" (m=2) -> \n      substrings of length 2: \n          \"aa\" -> distinct=1 -> caught.\n\n  Example: \"abbb\" (m=2) -> \n      substrings of length 2: \n          \"ab\" -> distinct=2 -> skip.\n          \"bb\" -> distinct=1 -> caught.\n\n  Example: \"aabcd\" (m=4) -> \n      The bad substring \"aa\" (length=2) -> distinct=1 !=4 -> caught? \n          But the code checks only length=4? \n          The substring \"aabc\" (length=4) has distinct=3 !=4 -> caught.\n\nBut what if the bad substring is of length greater than m and has distinct count less than m? \n  Then the code will catch it in the window of length m? \n\nBut note: if there is a bad substring t (which has distinct count < m), then consider a window of length m that is contained in t? That window will also have distinct count < m? \n\nBut not necessarily: \n  Example: t = \"aabc\" (which is bad) and m=3. \n      The entire string has distinct set D = {'a','b','c'} -> m=3.\n      The substring t has distinct count=3? -> no, \"aabc\" has distinct count=3? \n      But the bad substring we are concerned with is \"aa\" (which is contained in t) -> distinct count=1. \n      But the code checks windows of length 3: \n          \"aab\" -> distinct=2 -> which is less than 3 -> caught.\n\nTherefore, if there is any substring that has distinct count < m, then there is a contiguous substring of length m that has distinct count < m? \n\nBut note: the distinct count of a substring of length m cannot exceed m, and if there is a gap in the distinct characters, then a window of length m might not cover the entire distinct set? \n\nBut the condition for the entire string: we require that every substring has the property. And if there is a substring that has distinct count < m, then we have a bad substring. And the code checks every window of length m: if any window has distinct count < m, then we break and say \"NO\". \n\nBut is the converse true? If every window of length m has distinct count = m, then is the string perfectly balanced? \n\nConsider: \n  We require that for every substring and for every pair of characters u,v in D, |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|<=1.\n\n  But if every window of length m has distinct count = m, then every window of length m contains every character exactly once? \n\n  Then the string must be composed of contiguous blocks of the distinct characters in some order? \n\n  Example: m=3, and the string is \"abcabc\". \n      Every window of length 3: \n          \"abc\", \"bca\", \"cab\", \"abc\" -> distinct=3.\n      But what about a window of length 4? \n          \"abca\": distinct=3 -> but we don't require that the distinct count is m for windows larger than m? \n      But the condition: for the substring \"abca\", we have a:2, b:1, c:1. \n          |a-b|=1, |a-c|=1, |b-c|=0 -> acceptable.\n      What about a window of length 2? \n          \"ab\": distinct=2 -> but we don't check? \n          But the condition: for u='a' and v='c', we have |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n          for u='b' and v='c', |1-0|=1 -> acceptable.\n          for u='a' and v='b', |1-1|=0 -> acceptable.\n\n  So it seems acceptable.\n\n  But what if the string is \"abcd\" (m=4) and we have a window of length 4: \"abcd\" -> distinct=4 -> acceptable. \n      But what about a window of length 1: \"a\" -> distinct=1 -> acceptable? \n          |a-b|=1, |a-c|=1, |a-d|=1 -> acceptable.\n\n  But what if the string is \"aabc\" (m=3) and we have a window of length 3: \n      \"aab\": distinct=2 -> not 3 -> we catch and say \"NO\".\n\n  But what if the string is \"aabcd\" (m=4) and we have a window of length 4: \n      \"aabc\": distinct=3 -> not 4 -> we catch.\n\n  But what if the string is \"aa\" (m=2): \n      windows of length 2: \"aa\" -> distinct=1 -> not 2 -> we catch.\n\n  But what if the string is \"a\" (m=1): \n      then the range is for i in range(1-1+1)=range(1): \n          substring = s[0:1]=\"a\" -> distinct=1 -> skip -> \"YES\".\n\n  And for m=0? \n\n  But the problem says: non-empty substring? and the string has at least length 1.\n\n  However, what if the string is \"abacaba\" (m=3)? \n      The distinct set is {'a','b','c'}.\n      We check windows of length 3:\n          \"aba\" -> distinct=2 -> not 3 -> we break and say \"NO\".\n\n  But is \"abacaba\" perfectly balanced? \n      Consider the substring \"aba\": \n          a:2, b:1, c:0 -> \n          |a-c|=|2-0|=2>1 -> not acceptable. \n      So it should be \"NO\", and we catch.\n\n  But what if the string is \"abc\" (m=3) -> \n      windows of length 3: \"abc\" -> distinct=3 -> skip -> \"YES\".\n\n  But what if the string is \"ab\" (m=2) -> \n      windows of length 2: \"ab\" -> distinct=2 -> skip -> \"YES\".\n\n  But what if the string is \"a\" (m=1) -> \"YES\".\n\n  But what if the string is \"aa\" (m=1) -> \n      Then the distinct set has size 1. \n      We check windows of length 1: \n          for i in range(2-1+1)=range(2): \n              i=0: \"a\" -> distinct=1 -> skip.\n              i=1: \"a\" -> distinct=1 -> skip.\n          -> \"YES\".\n\n  But \"aa\" is acceptable? \n      The entire string has distinct set {'a'} -> then we only consider pairs (a,a) -> 0. \n      So it is acceptable.\n\n  But what if the string is \"aab\" (m=2) -> \n      We check windows of length 2: \n          \"aa\": distinct=1 -> not 2 -> break -> \"NO\".\n\n  This matches.\n\nTherefore, the provided code in program2.py is checking: \n  For a string s, let m = len(set(s)).\n  For every starting index i in [0, n-m] (so that the substring s[i:i+m] has length m), we check if the distinct characters in that substring is m. \n  If we find one that is not, then we set ans = \"NO\" and break.\n\n  Otherwise, we leave ans as \"YES\".\n\nBut the code currently has:\n\n  for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n      if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to set ans to \"NO\" and break out of the loop.\n\nSo we can do:\n  ans = \"NO\"\n  break\n\nBut note: the code initializes ans = \"YES\". Then if we find a counterexample, we set ans to \"NO\" and break.\n\nSo the TODO part is:\n  ans = \"NO\"\n  break\n\nBut what if we find one that is not m, we break immediately.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n  ans = \"NO\"\n  break\n\nBut note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 200000. The loop runs at most n-m+1 times, and for each we do set(s[i:i+m]) which is O(m). The total work per test case is O(m*(n))? \n\nBut the worst-case m is 26, and the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total work is 26 * 200000 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the worst-case m might be 26, and the string length n might be 200000, then the work per test case is 26 * (200000 - 26 + 1) = 26 * 199975 = 5.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we complete program2.py with:\n  ans = \"NO\"\n  break\n\nBut what if there are multiple test cases? The break will break out of the for loop, then we print ans and then the next test case.\n\nSo the code for program2.py is:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  while (t > 0):\n      t -= 1\n      s = str(input())\n      var = set(s)\n      ans = \"YES\"\n      for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n          if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n              ans = \"NO\"\n              break\n      print(ans)\n\nBut note: the problem says the total length of all strings is <= 200000, so the worst-case total work is 5.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the worst-case might be when the string is long and m is large? But m is at most 26.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is the elif block: \n    j -= 1\n    rsum += arr[j]\n\nAnd for program2.py, the missing code in the if block is:\n    ans = \"NO\"\n    break\n\nBut note: the problem says to output in JSON format: \n  {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nWe must output the exact code that is missing? \n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is one line? Actually, two lines? \n  The TODO is in the elif block, and we need two lines: \n      j -= 1\n      rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut we must be careful: the indentation. The code is in an elif block. \n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is two lines? \n      ans = \"NO\"\n      break\n\nBut note: the break is to break out of the for loop.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n  \"program2\": \"            ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n            break\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has 4 spaces for indentation. The current block is indented by 8 spaces (because it is inside the while loop and the if-elif block). The provided code in program1.py for the if block is:\n\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nSo the elif block should be similarly indented.\n\nIn the program1.py code, the missing part is in the elif block, which is at the same level as the if and else. So we output two lines with 8 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the existing code in the if block has 8 spaces for the two lines. So we output:\n\n    j -= 1\n    rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut the existing code in the if block has 8 spaces (two levels of 4). So we output two lines with 8 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the existing code has:\n\n    for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe TODO is at an indentation of 12 spaces (three levels). We output:\n\n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\nBut the existing code in the for loop and if block is at 8 and 12 spaces. So we output two lines at 12 spaces.\n\nBut note: the break must be at the same level as the assignment.\n\nTherefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n  \"program2\": \"            ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n            break\"\n}\n\nBut wait: in program1.py, the existing code in the if block is:\n\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nSo we do similarly for the elif block.\n\nIn program2.py, the existing code in the for loop is:\n\n        for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n            if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we replace the TODO with:\n\n                ans = \"NO\"\n                break\n\nBut the code has 4 spaces per level. The for loop is at 8 spaces (because the while loop is 4, then for is 8). The if is 12, and the TODO is 16? Actually, the provided code in program2.py has:\n\n    for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the for loop is at 8 spaces (one tab of 4 and then 4 more) and the if is at 12, and the TODO is at 12? Actually, the TODO is aligned with the if? \n\nLooking at the code:\n\n    for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the if is at 8 (because the for is at 8, and the if is inside the for, so 12? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per indent. \n\nThe structure:\n\nwhile (t > 0):\n    t -= 1\n    s = ...   [4 spaces]\n    var = ... [4 spaces]\n    ans = ... [4 spaces]\n    for ...:  [4 spaces]\n        if ...: [8 spaces]\n            ... [12 spaces]\n\nBut the provided code has:\n\n    for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the for is at 4 spaces? Actually, the while loop body is indented 4, then the for is indented 4 (so 8 in total) and the if is indented 4 more (so 12) and the TODO is at 16? \n\nBut the code is:\n\nt = int(input())\nwhile (t > 0):\n    t -= 1\n    s = str(input())\n    var = set(s)\n    ans = \"YES\"\n    for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nSo the for loop is at 4 spaces (relative to the while) and the if is at 8 spaces? \n\nTherefore, the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\nBut the TODO is a comment at the same level as the if body. So we need to output two lines at 8 spaces? \n\nBut the if body should be indented one more level? \n\nIn Python, we need to indent the code under the if. So the correct indentation for the if body is 8 spaces? \n\nActually, the while loop is 4, the for is 8, the if is 12, and the body of the if should be 16? \n\nBut the provided code has the TODO comment at 12 spaces? \n\nLooking at the code: \n\n    for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe for loop: the line starts at 4 spaces? Then the next line (if) is at 8 spaces? Then the TODO is at 12? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nWe must output the code that replaces the TODO, with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\nBut the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\nwith 12 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\nBut the existing code in the for loop and if block: the if condition is at 8 spaces, and the TODO is at 12. So the body of the if should be at 12.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is two lines, each starting with 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces? However, we must match the existing indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the code without the leading spaces? But the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that would be pasted in the TODO.\n\nIn the context, the TODO is at the same indentation level as the body of the if. So we output:\n\nans = \"NO\"\nbreak\n\nBut that would be at the same indentation as the TODO comment? \n\nBut the TODO comment is at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nWe must output the exact two lines that would replace the TODO, with the same indentation.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation level? However, we know the structure.\n\nTo be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\nIn program1.py, the missing code is two lines, each with 8 spaces (because the existing code in the if block has 8 spaces). \n\nIn program2.py, the missing code is two lines, each with 12 spaces? \n\nBut let me count the spaces in the provided program2.py code:\n\nThe code:\n\nt = int(input())\nwhile (t > 0):\n    t -= 1\n    s = str(input())\n    var = set(s)\n    ans = \"YES\"\n    for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n    print(ans)\n\nThe while loop body: \n    t -= 1   -> 4 spaces\n    s = ...   -> 4 spaces\n    var = ... -> 4 spaces\n    ans = ... -> 4 spaces\n    for ...:  -> 4 spaces\n        if ...:  -> 8 spaces\n            ...   -> 12 spaces\n\nSo the TODO is at 12 spaces. Therefore, the replacement code should be at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    j -= 1\\n    rsum += arr[j]\",\n  \"program2\": \"            ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n            break\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the existing code in the if block is:\n\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nwhich is 8 spaces per line? Actually, the code in the question for program1.py:\n\n    while i < j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nThe if block has two lines at 8 spaces. The elif block should have the same. So we output two lines at 8 spaces? But the code block for the if is:\n\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nwhich is 12 spaces? \n\nWait, the structure:\n\n    while i < j:   [0 spaces? but the while is inside a function?]\n\nActually, the entire program1.py:\n\nimport math as m\n\ni = input()\ninp = []\nfor a in range(0,int(i)):\n    inp += [[input(), input()]]\n\ndef maxx(arr):\n    if arr == []:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return max(arr)\n\nfor s in inp:\n    n = int(s[0])\n    arr = [int(x) for x in s[1].split()]\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = n-1\n    lsum = arr[i]\n    rsum = arr[j]\n\n    best = 0\n    while i < j:\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n        elif rsum < lsum:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        else:\n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n    print(best)\n\nSo the while loop is at 4 spaces (inside the for loop). The if, elif, else are at 8 spaces. The bodies of the if, elif, else should be at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the existing if block has:\n\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nat 12 spaces.\n\nSo the missing code for the elif block should be two lines at 12 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, the else block has:\n\n            best = i + (n-1-j) + 2\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nat 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut the code in the question for the if block is at 12 spaces? \n\nSo we output:\n\n            j -= 1\n            rsum += arr[j]\n\nFor program2.py, we output:\n\n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\nat 12 spaces.\n\nBut wait, in program2.py, the for loop is at 4 spaces (inside the while) and the if is at 8 spaces? Then the body of the if should be at 12 spaces? \n\nBut the provided code in the question for program2.py has:\n\n    for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe for loop is at 4 spaces (relative to the while) and the if is at 8 spaces? Then the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\nTherefore, the replacement code should be at 12 spaces.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            j -= 1\\n            rsum += arr[j]\",\n  \"program2\": \"            ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n            break\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has 12 spaces for the body, and program2.py also has 12 spaces? \n\nBut the program1.py code has 12 spaces per line, and program2.py also 12? \n\nBut the program1.py code has 12 spaces for the two lines, and program2.py has 12 spaces for the two lines.\n\nBut the program1.py code has 12 spaces for the two lines, but the existing code in the if block is also at 12 spaces? \n\nTherefore, we output the above.\n\nBut note: in program1.py, the existing code in the if block is:\n\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nSo we do similarly for the elif block.\n\nIn program2.py, the existing code in the for loop is:\n\n        if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nand we replace the TODO with:\n\n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\nat the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, the JSON is:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            j -= 1\\n            rsum += arr[j]\",\n  \"program2\": \"            ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n            break\"\n}\n\nBut note: the quotes in the string for program2: we have to escape the quotes.\n\nSo we output the string with escaped double quotes.\n\nBut the JSON itself uses double quotes, so we must escape the double quotes inside the string.\n\nTherefore, the value for program2 is: \n  \"            ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n            break\"\n\nSimilarly, for program1, we don't have quotes.\n\nFinal JSON string:\n\n{\"program1\": \"            j -= 1\\n            rsum += arr[j]\", \"program2\": \"            ans = \\\"NO\\\"\\n            break\"}\n\nBut note: the program1 code has two lines, so we use \\n. Similarly for program2.\n\nLet me write the exact string for program1: \n  Line1: 12 spaces and then \"j -= 1\"\n  Line2: 12 spaces and then \"rsum += arr[j]\"\n\nFor program2:\n  Line1: 12 spaces and then \"ans = \\\"NO\\\"\"\n  Line2: 12 spaces and then \"break\"\n\nBut the number of spaces: 12. How many is 12? We can count as 12.\n\nBut to be precise, the existing code in program1.py for the if block has 12 spaces? \n\nIn the provided code:\n\n        if lsum < rsum:\n            i += 1\n            lsum += arr[i]\n\nThe body is indented by 4 more spaces than the if? The if is at 8 spaces (from the while at 4) and the body at 12.\n\nSo we output 12 spaces for each line.\n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, and the two pointers in program1.py will run in O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nAnd for program2.py, the total work is O(26 * total_length) which is 5.2e6, acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as above."
