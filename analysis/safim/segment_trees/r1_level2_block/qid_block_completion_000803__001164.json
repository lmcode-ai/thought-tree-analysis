But note: we start with lsum=arr[0] and rsum=arr[n-1]. Then we enter the loop. Then we might never get an equality? Then best remains 0? Then we output 0? That's correct. So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    best = i+1 + n - j\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n    else:\n        break\n\nBut note: the code after the else block is already the end of the while loop? So we break out? But what if we don't break? Then we continue the while loop? So we write:\n\n        else:\n            best = i+1 + n - j\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000? So this is linear per test case? And the sum of n is 200,000? So it's acceptable. Now for program2.py:\n\nWe are to complete the code for the tiling problem.",

But the condition if mod_a<=2 was there to filter? but the new condition might be true even if mod_a>2? Example: a=3, w=4, l=5: \n            mod_a = 4 % 3 = 1, which is<=2 -> we enter the if. then we check the conditions: \n                (4%3==0? -> no) and (5%3==0? -> no) -> false\n                (4%3==0? -> no) and (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> false (because first part false)\n                (4-2)%3=2%3=2 -> not 0? -> false\n                (4-1)%3=3%3=0 and (5-1)%3=4%3=1 -> false\n                (4-2)%3=2%3=2 -> not 0 -> false\n                (4-1)%3=0 and (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> true? so we add a=3? And the example says for w=3, l=5, a=3 is valid? but here w=4, l=5? For w=4, l=5, a=3: \n            total area = 2*(4+5)-4=14, not divisible by 3? -> but wait, we are only iterating on divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2=4+5-2=7? and 3 is not a divisor of 7? so we wouldn't consider a=3? Therefore, the condition if mod_a<=2 is not needed? and might filter out valid a? For example, a=4: \n            half_perimeter = 7? then 4 is not a divisor of 7? so we skip? So the condition if mod_a<=2 is not necessary? and might be harmful?",

Given the complexity, and the known solution from Codeforces, we output the six-condition check and remove the if mod_a<=2 condition? But the problem: we must output only the missing code? and the TODO block is inside the if mod_a<=2: \n\n        If we remove the if, we are changing more than the TODO block? Alternatively, we can simply put the six-condition check inside the if mod_a<=2: and hope that it catches all? But note: the condition if mod_a<=2 is not necessary? and might skip valid a? For example, a=3, w=1 (but w>=3) -> not possible? a=3, w=3: mod_a=0, which is<=2 -> caught. a=3, w=4: mod_a=1, caught.\n        a=3, w=5: mod_a=2, caught.\n        a=3, w=6: mod_a=0, caught.\n        a=3, w=7: mod_a=1, caught.\n        a=3, w=8: mod_a=2, caught.\n        a=3, w=9: mod_a=0, caught. So for a>=3, w>=3, w % a is in the range [0, a-1]? and since a>=3, then w % a can be 0,1,2,...,a-1. But we only consider 0,1,2? What if w % a = 3? then we skip? Example: a=4, w=7, l= something? \n            half_perimeter = w+l-2 = 7+l-2 = 5+l? We require that a=4 divides half_perimeter? so 5+l must be divisible by 4? \n            l = 3, then half_perimeter=5+3=8, divisible by 4? Then mod_a = 7 % 4 = 3, which is>2? so we skip? But is a=4 valid for w=7, l=3? Conditions:\n                    Condition 1: 7%4=3, 3%4=3 -> not 0. Condition 2: 7%4=3, (3-2)%4=1 -> not 0. Condition 3: (7-2)%4=5%4=1, 3%4=3 -> not 0. Condition 4: (7-1)%4=6%4=2, (3-1)%4=2%4=2 -> not 0. Condition 5: (7-2)%4=1, (3-1)%4=2 -> not 0. Condition 6: (7-1)%4=2, (3-2)%4=1 -> not 0.\n                -> not valid? So we are safe. Therefore, the condition mod_a<=2 might be a heuristic that is always sufficient? But to be safe, we will keep the if mod_a<=2 and then do the six-condition check inside?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The current code sets up two pointers and two sums (lsum and rsum) and moves the pointers until they meet. The goal is to find the maximum total number of candies eaten (which is i+1 from the left and n - j from the right) such that the sums are equal.\n\nIn the else block (when lsum == rsum), we record the current total candies (i+1 + (n - j)) and then we need to move one of the pointers to look for more possibilities. However, note that the problem says the total number of candies eaten must be maximized.\n\nBut note: the example test cases. In the fourth test case, the answer is 7. The example says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (which are the first, second, and fifth from the left? Actually, note the candies are in a row and Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. The example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] which are the last four? But then the total candies would be 3+4=7. The weights: 7+3+20 = 30 and 10+8+11+1=30.\n\nHowever, the current code only moves one pointer when the sums are not equal. When they are equal, we record the best so far and then we must move at least one pointer to continue. But note: we might have multiple possibilities? Actually, we can move both pointers? Because if we only move one, we break the equality. However, we can try to move the left pointer and then the right pointer? But the problem is that we are trying to maximize the total number of candies.\n\nThe idea: we want to record the current total (i+1 + (n - j)) and then we move both pointers? Because if we only move one, then the sums become unequal and we might miss a longer sequence? Actually, we can move both because the current candies at i and j are already accounted for and we can try to extend? But note: we are in a two-pointer method that is similar to the \"two-sum\" in a sorted array? However, the array is not sorted? But note: the problem does not require the array to be sorted? Actually, the array is arbitrary.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the total of n over test cases is at most 200,000. The two-pointer method must be linear.\n\nHow the current code works:\n- We start with lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[n-1].\n- Then we have two pointers i at 0 and j at n-1.\n- We move the left pointer if lsum < rsum (adding the next left candy) and the right pointer if rsum < lsum (adding the next right candy).\n- When they are equal, we record the total candies (i+1 + n - j) and then we must move at least one pointer? But note: we can move both? Because if we move only one, then the sums become unequal and we might not get the same sum again? However, we are trying to maximize the total candies. We can record the current best and then move the left pointer? But then we break the equality? Actually, we can move both because the current candies at i and j are already included and we can try to add the next ones? But note: we are not allowed to skip candies? So we have to move both? Because if we don't, we are stuck? \n\nSo in the else block, we do:\n    best = i+1 + n - j   # because we have i+1 candies on the left and n - j on the right (since j is included and we have n-1 - j + 1 = n - j candies on the right)\n    Then we move both pointers: i += 1 and j -= 1, and update lsum and rsum? But what if moving both breaks the condition? We can do that and then continue the while loop? However, we must be cautious: we might run into the case where i becomes >= j? Then we break.\n\nBut note: we are in the while loop condition i < j. After we record, we move both and then update the sums. However, we must check that i and j are still in bounds? The update: \n    i += 1\n    if i < j:   # because we are going to add arr[i] only if i < j? But after moving, i might be >= j? Then we break the loop.\n    Similarly for j.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n    best = i+1 + n - j   # record the current total\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n    else:\n        break\n\nBut note: what if after moving both, we have i==j? Then we break and we don't process the middle? But that's okay because we cannot eat the same candy twice.\n\nHowever, consider: we are at a state where lsum == rsum. Then we move both and update the sums. Then we continue the while loop. But we might get another equality? And we update best again? But that would be a larger total? Actually, the total number of candies would be (i+1) + (n - j) = (i0+2) + (n - (j0-1)) = (i0+1+1) + (n - j0 + 1) = (i0+1 + n - j0) + 2. So it increases by 2. But we are looking for the maximum total, so we want the last time we had an equality? Actually, we want the maximum total at any equality.\n\nBut note: we are updating best every time we have an equality. So we are taking the maximum? Actually, we are overwriting best? But we want the maximum total candies? And since we are moving from the ends inward, the total candies we record in best is increasing? Actually, no: the total candies is (i+1) + (n - j). As we move the pointers inward, the left part increases (because i increases) and the right part increases (because j decreases) so the total (i+1 + n - j) = (i - j + n + 1) and as i increases and j decreases, (i - j) increases? So the total increases? Actually, we are adding more candies? But wait: we are moving the pointers and including more candies? Actually, no: we start with the two ends and then we add more candies by moving the pointers. But when we have an equality, we record the current total and then we move both pointers? Then we are including two more candies? So the total increases by 2? Therefore, the last equality we get would be the maximum? But what if we get an equality at the beginning and then we don't get any more? Then we have recorded the first one? But we want the maximum total? Actually, we want the maximum total candies for which the sums are equal. And since the total candies increases as we move the pointers, we want the last one? But note: it is possible that we get multiple equalities? And we want the one with the largest total? So we should update best every time we have an equality? And then we move both? Because the next one might be even larger? But if we break the equality by moving both, we might not get an equality again? However, we are updating best to the last (and largest) total we have seen? \n\nBut consider: we start with i=0, j=n-1. Then we move until we get an equality. Then we record best = 1+1 = 2? Then we move both: i=1, j=n-2. Then we update lsum = arr[0]+arr[1], rsum = arr[n-1]+arr[n-2]. Then we continue. We might get another equality? Then we update best to 2 + (n - (n-2)) = 2 + 2 = 4? Then we move both again? So we are increasing the total by 2 each time we get an equality? And we update best to the latest (and largest) total? \n\nBut what if we get an equality at a total of 2, then we move both and then we don't get an equality again? Then we break? Then we have best=2? But what if there was a possibility of a total of 4? We would have updated best to 4? So we are doing the right thing.\n\nHowever, what if we get an equality at total=2, then we move both and then we get an inequality? Then we start moving one pointer until we get an equality? Then we might get an equality at total=4? Actually, no: because we moved both and then we have an inequality? Then we move one pointer until we get an equality? But note: we are updating the sums by moving the left pointer if lsum < rsum, etc. So we might get an equality again? Then we update best to 4? \n\nBut note: the total candies at a later step might be more than 2? But we are updating best every time we get an equality? So we are taking the maximum total? Actually, we are updating best to the last equality we get? But it might not be the maximum? Actually, the total candies is (i+1 + n - j). As we move the pointers (either by moving one or both) the value of (i+1 + n - j) is increasing? Because i is increasing and j is decreasing? So the total is increasing? Therefore, the last equality we get is the maximum? So we can update best every time we get an equality? And then at the end, we output best? \n\nBut note: what if we never get an equality? Then best remains 0? And that's the answer? (like the third test case).\n\nSo the plan for the else block:\n    best = i+1 + n - j   # current total candies\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n    else:\n        break   # because we cannot go further\n\nBut wait: what if after moving both, i becomes j? Then we break. But what if i becomes j and we break? That's okay because we cannot have the same candy.\n\nHowever, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i becomes j? Then we break. But what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i < j? Then we update the sums and continue.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious: we are updating the sums only if i < j? But if we move both and then i==j, we break and don't update the sums? That's okay because we don't need to.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i < j? Then we update the sums and then we might get an inequality? Then we start moving one pointer? And then we might get another equality? Then we update best to a larger value? \n\nSo the code for the else block should be:\n\n    best = i+1 + n - j   # record the current total\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n    else:\n        break\n\nBut note: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i==j? Then we break. But we have updated best to the current total? That's the last one.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i < j? Then we update the sums and then we continue? Then we might get an equality again? Then we update best to a larger value? \n\nBut note: the total candies at the next equality would be (i+1) + (n - j) = (i_prev+1+1) + (n - (j_prev-1)) = (i_prev+1) + (n - j_prev) + 2. So it increases by 2? So we are capturing the maximum? \n\nHowever, there is a problem: what if we have an equality at (i, j) and then we move both and then we get an equality at (i+1, j-1)? Then we update best to the new total? But what if the new total is larger? That's what we want.\n\nBut consider: the example test case 2: n=3, arr=[1,2,1]. \n    Initially: i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality: best = 0+1 + 3-2 = 1+1 = 2? Then we move both: i=1, j=1 -> break? Then we output 2? But the example says for the first test case the answer is 2? That matches.\n\nTest case 2: n=3, arr=[1,2,1] -> answer=2? But the example says the first test case? Actually, the example says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2\"\n\nBut the example also has a second test case: n=4, arr=[7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? Actually, the example says: \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". But wait, the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? Then Alice eats the first three: 7+3+20=30, Bob eats the last four: 10+8+11+1=30? So the total candies is 3+4=7.\n\nHow does our algorithm handle [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]?\n    n=8\n    i=0, j=7: lsum=7, rsum=1 -> lsum>rsum -> j moves to 6: rsum=1+11=12 -> lsum=7, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> i moves to 1: lsum=7+3=10 -> lsum=10, rsum=12 -> lsum<rsum -> i moves to 2: lsum=10+20=30 -> now lsum=30, rsum=12 -> lsum>rsum -> j moves to 5: rsum=12+8=20 -> lsum=30, rsum=20 -> lsum>rsum -> j moves to 4: rsum=20+10=30 -> now lsum=30, rsum=30 -> equality: best = 3 (i=2: so left count=3) + (n - j = 8-4=4) = 7. Then we move both: i=3, j=3 -> break? Then we output 7.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut note: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we get an equality again? For example, [1,1,1,1]: \n    i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> best=1+ (4-3)=1+1=2 -> then move both: i=1, j=2: lsum=1+1=2, rsum=1+1=2 -> best= (2) + (4-2)= 2+2=4 -> then move both: i=2, j=1 -> break? Then output 4? That's correct: they each eat 2? total 4.\n\nBut wait: the condition: they cannot eat the same candy. And they are eating all? So that's valid.\n\nSo the code for the else block is:\n\n    best = i+1 + n - j\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n    else:\n        break\n\nBut note: what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i==j? Then we break. But we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then we move both and then i < j? Then we update the sums and then we continue? Then we might get an equality again? Then we update best to a larger value? \n\nBut note: the total candies is increasing? So we are capturing the maximum? \n\nHowever, what if we have an equality and then we move both and then we get an inequality? Then we start moving one pointer? And then we might get an equality again? Then we update best to a value that is (i+1 + n - j) which is (i_prev+1+some_moves) + (n - (j_prev-1 - some_moves))? How does that compare? Actually, we are moving the pointers so that i increases and j decreases? So the total (i+1 + n - j) is increasing? So the last equality we get is the maximum? \n\nBut wait: if we move the left pointer by one (so i increases by 1) and j remains, then the total becomes (i+2) + (n - j) = (i+1 + n - j) + 1. Similarly, if we move the right pointer, the total becomes (i+1) + (n - (j-1)) = (i+1 + n - j) + 1. So every time we move a pointer, the total increases by 1? But when we move both, we increase by 2? \n\nTherefore, the total is non-decreasing? So we can update best every time we get an equality? And the last one is the maximum? \n\nBut note: we are updating best only when we get an equality? And we are moving the pointers in such a way that the total is increasing? So the last equality we get is the maximum? \n\nTherefore, we can do as above.\n\nBut what if we break out of the loop without having updated best? Then we output best=0? That's correct for the case when there is no equality? \n\nBut note: we start with lsum=arr[0] and rsum=arr[n-1]. Then we enter the loop. Then we might never get an equality? Then best remains 0? Then we output 0? That's correct.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    best = i+1 + n - j\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n    else:\n        break\n\nBut note: the code after the else block is already the end of the while loop? So we break out? \n\nBut what if we don't break? Then we continue the while loop? \n\nSo we write:\n\n        else:\n            best = i+1 + n - j\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n            if i < j:\n                lsum += arr[i]\n                rsum += arr[j]\n            else:\n                break\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200,000? So this is linear per test case? And the sum of n is 200,000? So it's acceptable.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are to complete the code for the tiling problem. The problem: we have a bathroom of width w and length l. The interior uses (w-2)*(l-2) 1x1 tiles. The boundary uses 1xa tiles (which can be rotated so they are effectively ax1 as well). The boundary consists of the outer ring. The boundary has total area: w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l) - 4. We need to cover the boundary with tiles of size 1xa (so the area must be divisible by a). But also, the tiles must fit along the edges? \n\nThe problem: for which a can we tile the boundary? \n\nThe boundary has four edges: top, bottom, left, right. But the corners are shared? So the boundary is composed of four segments:\n    top: length l, but the corners are shared? Actually, the top edge has length l, but the two corners are also part of the left and right edges? So the top edge without corners is l-2? Similarly, the bottom edge is l-2? The left edge without corners is w-2? The right edge is w-2? And the corners? We have four corners. \n\nBut note: the boundary is a cycle? The total perimeter is 2*(w+l) - 4? Because the four corners are each counted once? Actually, the area of the boundary is w*l - (w-2)*(l-2) = 2*(w+l)-4? \n\nBut the problem: we are going to use tiles of size 1xa. The tile can be placed horizontally or vertically. The entire boundary must be tiled without gaps. \n\nConstraints: \n   - The entire boundary must be covered by the 1xa tiles. Therefore, the total area of the boundary must be divisible by a: (2*(w+l)-4) % a == 0? But that is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nAdditionally, the tiles must fit along the edges? How? \n\nConsider the four corners: each corner is a 1x1 square? But we are using 1xa tiles? The tile must cover the entire segment? Actually, no: the tile can be placed arbitrarily? But the problem says: \"She needs exactly (w-2)*(l-2) of these [1x1] for the interior. On the boundary she uses 1xa tiles.\" \n\nBut the boundary is broken into four segments? And each segment must be covered by tiles that are aligned along that segment? \n\nThe problem: the boundary has four sides. Each side must be covered by tiles that are placed along that side? And the tiles can be rotated? So for the top and bottom sides (length l), we can use tiles of length a (if placed horizontally) or we can use tiles of length 1 (if placed vertically) but then they would have to be stacked? Actually, the tile is 1xa: so if placed horizontally, it covers a consecutive segment of length a and height 1. If placed vertically, it covers a consecutive segment of height a and width 1? But the boundary has height 1 for the top and bottom? and width 1 for the left and right? \n\nSo for the top side: we have a rectangle of size 1 x l. We can cover it with tiles of 1xa placed horizontally? Then we require that a divides l? But wait: we can also use tiles placed vertically? But the top side is only 1 unit high? So we cannot place a tile of height a (if a>1) vertically? Because it would stick out? Therefore, for the top and bottom sides, we must use tiles placed horizontally? Then the length l must be divisible by a? Similarly, for the left and right sides (which are of height w and width 1), we must use tiles placed vertically? Then the height w must be divisible by a? \n\nBut wait: what about the corners? The corners are shared by two sides. We can use a tile that covers part of the top and part of the left? But the problem does not say that. The problem says: \"On the floor boundary\" meaning the entire boundary? And the tiles can be rotated? But the example pictures show: \n   For a=1: the entire boundary is covered by 1x1 tiles? \n   For a=2: the top side is covered by two tiles: one covering the first two units and the next covering the next two? and similarly for the other sides? \n   For a=3: the top side is covered by one tile of length 3? and the bottom by one tile of length 3? and the sides: each side of height 3? but the sides have height 3? so one tile of 1x3 placed vertically? \n\nBut note: the bathroom is 3x5? Then the top side is 5 units long? and the bottom side is 5? the left and right are 3 units high? \n   For a=3: \n        top: 5 must be divisible by 3? -> no? \n        left: 3 is divisible by 3? \n        but the top and bottom: 5 is not divisible by 3? \n\nHow did they do it? The example says a=3 is valid. \n\nLooking at the example picture: \n   The top side: they use one tile that covers the entire top? But 5 is not divisible by 3? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"The tiles can also be rotated by 90 degrees.\" and they can be placed arbitrarily? \n\nBut note: the boundary is connected. The key is that the corners can be covered by tiles that are placed in the adjacent side? \n\nActually, the problem does not require that each side is covered independently? We can cover the boundary as a whole? \n\nBut the boundary is a cycle? We can use a tiling that wraps around? \n\nHowever, the problem is simpler: we note that the boundary has four linear segments? and the corners are fixed? \n\nBut the known solution for this problem: \n   The valid a must be divisors of the total perimeter? (which is 2*(w+l)-4) and also satisfy one of the following conditions:\n\n   Condition 1: a divides (w) and a divides (l) -> then we can cover the entire boundary? but wait: the top and bottom: we need to cover l, and the sides: w? but then we require a divides l and a divides w? \n\n   Condition 2: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l) -> ? \n   Condition 3: a divides (w) and a divides (l-1) -> ?\n   Condition 4: a divides (w-2) -> then we can cover the top and bottom? and the sides? \n\nActually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is to consider the divisors of the total perimeter and then check one of four conditions? \n\nThe four conditions that are known in the editorial for the problem (which is Codeforces Round #735 (Div. 2), problem C) are:\n\n   Condition 1: a must be a divisor of the total perimeter? (so 2*(w+l)-4) must be divisible by a? \n\n   Additionally, one of the following must hold:\n\n   1. a divides w and a divides l? -> then we can cover each side independently? \n   2. a divides w and a divides (l-1)? \n   3. a divides (w-1) and a divides l?\n   4. a divides (w-2) and a divides l? \n   5. a divides w and a divides (l-2)? \n\nBut wait, the known solution from the sample code we are given: \n\n    solutions = {1, 2}\n    for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n        div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)\n        if mod_i != 0:\n            continue\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                ...   # we are missing code here\n\nWhat is half_perimeter? It is w + l - 2? But the total perimeter of the boundary is 2*(w+l)-4? So half_perimeter is (w+l-2)? and the total perimeter is 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter? \n\nSo the total perimeter is 2 * half_perimeter? Therefore, a must divide 2 * half_perimeter? But note: the problem says the tile can be 1xa? so the area condition: a must divide the total area? which is 2 * half_perimeter? \n\nBut the code is iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? Why? \n\nActually, the total area is 2 * half_perimeter? So a must divide 2 * half_perimeter? But the code is only considering divisors of half_perimeter? Then we are missing divisors that divide 2 * half_perimeter but not half_perimeter? \n\nBut note: the code also includes 1 and 2? \n\nAnd then in the loop, we are iterating from 2 to sqrt(half_perimeter) and then for each divisor i, we consider a = i and a = half_perimeter // i? \n\nBut then we are missing divisors that are factors of 2 * half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter? \n\nHowever, the problem constraints: the output contains at most 200,000 integers? and the known solution is to consider the divisors of the total perimeter? \n\nBut the code uses half_perimeter = w+l-2? and then we consider divisors of half_perimeter? and then we also consider a=1 and a=2? \n\nBut note: the total perimeter is 2 * half_perimeter? so if a divides half_perimeter, then a divides the total perimeter? but also, if a divides 2 * half_perimeter, then we can have a that does not divide half_perimeter? \n\nBut the code does not consider divisors of 2 * half_perimeter? \n\nLooking at the known solution from Codeforces: \n\n   We consider the divisors of the total perimeter? which is 2*(w+l)-4? \n\nBut the code we are given: \n\n   half_perimeter = w + l - 2   -> which is (w+l-2)\n   Then we iterate over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nBut then we are missing divisors that are divisors of 2*(w+l)-4 but not of (w+l-2)? \n\nBut note: 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2) = 2 * half_perimeter? \n\nSo the divisors of 2 * half_perimeter are: \n   the divisors of half_perimeter and the divisors of half_perimeter multiplied by 2? and also the divisors of half_perimeter that are even? \n\nBut the code does not do that? \n\nHowever, the code also includes 2? and then in the loop, we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nBut then we are missing divisors that are divisors of 2 * half_perimeter but not divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nBut note: the condition in the code: \n\n    for a in [i, div]:   # where i is a divisor and div = half_perimeter // i\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            ...   # then we do something? \n\nWhat is the condition? \n\nThe known conditions for the tiling:\n\n   Condition 1: The total area must be divisible by a: so (2 * half_perimeter) % a == 0? \n\nBut the code does not check that? It only checks that a divides half_perimeter? because we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nBut then we are missing a that are divisors of 2 * half_perimeter but not of half_perimeter? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that under the problem constraints, the output contains at most 200,000 integers.\" and the known solution from the sample code we are given is to iterate over divisors of half_perimeter? \n\nSo we must be missing some a? \n\nBut the problem: the valid a must be divisors of the total perimeter? and also satisfy one of the four conditions? \n\nThe four conditions (from known solutions) are:\n\n   Condition A: (w % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)   -> then we can cover the entire boundary? \n   Condition B: (w % a == 0) and ((l-1) % a == 0) \n   Condition C: ((w-1) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)\n   Condition D: ((w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a == 0)   -> but wait, what about the corners? \n   Condition E: (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)\n   Condition F: ((w-1) % a == 0) and ((l-1) % a == 0)   -> but note: the total area: 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w-1 + l-1) = 2*(w-1) + 2*(l-1) -> then if a divides both (w-1) and (l-1), then a divides the total? \n\nBut wait: the total area is 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w-1 + l-1) = 2*(w-1) + 2*(l-1). So if a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1), then a divides the total? \n\nBut the conditions for the tiling: \n\n   We have four corners? \n\n   Actually, the known solution in the editorial for Codeforces Round #735 (Div. 2) problem C is:\n\n        Let g = (w-1, l-1) and then consider divisors of g? \n\n   But the known solution in the sample code we are given is:\n\n        solutions = {1, 2}\n        for i in range(2, floor(sqrt(half_perimeter)) + 1):\n            if half_perimeter % i != 0: continue\n            for a in [i, half_perimeter//i]:\n                if w % a <= 2 and (w % a == 0 or (w-1) % a == 0 or (w-2) % a == 0) and (l % a <= 2) and (l % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n   But that is not exactly what we have? \n\n   Actually, the code we are given has:\n\n        mod_a = w % a\n        if mod_a <= 2:\n            ...   # then we do something? \n\n   And then there is a missing block? \n\n   The note: the condition mod_a <= 2 might be because we are considering the residue of w modulo a? and if it is 0,1, or 2? then it might be one of the conditions? \n\n   But we also need to check the residue for l? \n\n   The known conditions: we require that the boundary can be tiled? and the residues at the corners? \n\n   The four conditions are:\n\n        Condition 1: w % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n        Condition 2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0\n        Condition 3: (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0\n        Condition 4: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n\n   But note: the total area condition: a must divide 2*(w+l)-4? \n\n   And the code is iterating over divisors a of half_perimeter? which is w+l-2? Then 2*(w+l)-4 = 2 * half_perimeter? and since a divides half_perimeter, then a divides 2 * half_perimeter? so the total area condition is satisfied? \n\n   Therefore, we only need to check one of the four conditions? \n\n   But the code only checks w % a <= 2? and then what? \n\n   We also need to check l? \n\n   The missing code might be:\n\n        if mod_a == 0:\n            # then w is divisible by a? then we require that l % a is 0 or 2? \n            # because conditions: \n            #   Condition 1: l % a == 0 -> valid\n            #   Condition 2: (l-2) % a == 0 -> valid\n            #   Condition 4: l % a == 0? \n            # But note: condition 4 is (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0? -> not this branch? \n            # Actually, we are in the branch w % a == 0? \n            # So we have condition 1: l % a == 0 -> valid\n            # and condition 2: (l-2) % a == 0 -> valid? \n            # But also condition 3: requires (w-1) % a == 0 -> not satisfied? \n            # So we need to check l % a and (l-2) % a? \n            if l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n        elif mod_a == 1:\n            # then (w-1) % a == 0? \n            # then condition 3: requires (l-1) % a == 0? \n            if (l-1) % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n        elif mod_a == 2:\n            # then (w-2) % a == 0? \n            # then condition 4: requires l % a == 0? \n            if l % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But wait: what about the condition for l modulo a in the case mod_a==0? we have two possibilities: l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0? \n\n   Similarly, for mod_a==1, we require (l-1) % a == 0? \n   for mod_a==2, we require l % a == 0? \n\n   But note: we also have to consider the possibility that the roles of w and l are swapped? But the problem: the bathroom has width w and length l? and the boundary is symmetric? \n\n   However, the conditions are not symmetric? because the top and bottom are of length l? and the sides are of height w? \n\n   But the conditions we have are:\n\n        Condition 1: w % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n        Condition 2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0   -> this is for the top and bottom: we cover the top and bottom with tiles? and the sides: we cover the sides with tiles? but the corners? we have two corners on the top and bottom that are not covered? and then we use two tiles of size 1x1? but wait, we are using 1xa tiles? \n\n   Actually, the known solution from the editorial is to consider the following:\n\n        The boundary can be partitioned in two ways:\n\n        Type 1: \n            - The four corners are covered by four tiles? each covering one corner and then extending along the edge? \n            - Then the top and bottom edges (without corners) must be covered by tiles that are placed horizontally? and the left and right edges (without corners) by tiles placed vertically? \n            - Then the top edge: length l-2 must be divisible by a? \n            - The bottom edge: length l-2 must be divisible by a? \n            - The left edge: height w must be divisible by a? \n            - The right edge: height w must be divisible by a? \n            -> This is not one of our conditions? \n\n        Type 2: \n            - The corners are covered by two tiles: one covering the top-left and part of the top? and one covering the top-right and part of the top? and similarly for the bottom? \n            - Then the top edge: the middle part (l-2) must be divisible by a? and the left and right edges: the entire height w must be divisible by a? \n            -> This is condition: a divides (l-2) and a divides w? -> condition 2 above.\n\n        Type 3: \n            - Similarly, condition 4: a divides (w-2) and a divides l.\n\n        Type 4: \n            - The corners are covered by one tile that covers two adjacent corners? \n            - Then we require that a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1)? \n\n        Type 5: \n            - The entire boundary is covered without special corner treatment? then a divides w and a divides l? \n\n   But wait: type 5: if a divides w and a divides l, then we can cover the top and bottom (each of length l) and the sides (each of length w) independently? \n\n   So the conditions are:\n\n        Condition 1: a divides w and a divides l.\n        Condition 2: a divides w and a divides (l-2).\n        Condition 3: a divides (w-2) and a divides l.\n        Condition 4: a divides (w-1) and a divides (l-1).\n\n   But note: the total area: \n        Condition 1: 2*(w+l)-4 = 2w+2l-4 -> divisible by a? since a|w and a|l, then a|(2w+2l) and then a|(2w+2l-4)? not necessarily? \n        Example: w=3, l=3, a=3: total area = 2*(3+3)-4=8, which is not divisible by 3? -> so condition 1 is not valid? \n\n   But wait: the bathroom is 3x3? \n        Interior: (3-2)*(3-2)=1 tile? \n        Boundary: 3*3 - 1 = 8? \n        How to cover with 1x3 tiles? 8 is not divisible by 3? -> so a=3 is not valid? \n\n   But the example: the first test case: w=3, l=5, and a=3 is valid? \n        Total area: 2*(3+5)-4 = 2*8-4=12? divisible by 3? \n\n   So condition 1: we require that a divides the total area? which is 2*(w+l)-4? \n\n   And if a divides w and a divides l, then a divides 2*(w+l)? but not necessarily 2*(w+l)-4? \n\n   Therefore, the conditions are not independent of the total area? \n\n   But the code already ensures that a divides half_perimeter = w+l-2? then 2*(w+l)-4 = 2*(w+l-2) is divisible by a? \n\n   So the conditions we check are:\n\n        Condition 1: w % a == 0 and l % a == 0   -> then valid? \n        Condition 2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0 -> valid? \n        Condition 3: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0 -> valid? \n        Condition 4: (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0 -> valid? \n\n   But note: the total area condition is already satisfied? \n\n   However, the code only has w % a? and then we are going to check l? \n\n   So the missing code might be:\n\n        if mod_a == 0:\n            # then w % a == 0\n            if l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n        elif mod_a == 1:\n            # then (w-1) % a == 0? \n            if (l-1) % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n        elif mod_a == 2:\n            # then (w-2) % a == 0? \n            if l % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But wait: what about the condition for l in the case mod_a==0? we have two possibilities: l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0? \n\n   And for mod_a==1, we require (l-1) % a == 0? \n   for mod_a==2, we require l % a == 0? \n\n   But note: the condition for mod_a==0: \n        if l % a == 0 -> condition 1\n        if (l-2) % a == 0 -> condition 2\n\n   For mod_a==2: \n        if l % a == 0 -> condition 3? \n\n   For mod_a==1: \n        if (l-1) % a == 0 -> condition 4\n\n   But what about the symmetric condition for condition 2 and 3? \n\n   Condition 2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0 -> we cover the top and bottom with tiles? and the sides: we cover the sides with tiles? but the top and bottom have a gap of 2? which is covered by the condition (l-2) % a == 0? \n\n   Condition 3: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0 -> similarly? \n\n   But in our code, for a given a, we are only checking w % a? and then we check l? \n\n   However, the condition for the bathroom might be asymmetric? but the problem does not distinguish between width and length? \n\n   But the input gives w and l? and we are iterating over divisors? \n\n   But note: the condition for the bathroom might be satisfied in one orientation? \n\n   However, the conditions we are checking are for the given w and l? \n\n   But what if we swap w and l? then condition 2 becomes: a divides l and a divides (w-2)? which is condition 3? \n\n   But in our code, we are only checking the residues for w? and then for l? we are not swapping? \n\n   How do we cover the condition 3? \n\n   In the above, for mod_a==2: we require l % a == 0? which is condition 3: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0? \n\n   And for mod_a==0: we also cover condition 2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0? \n\n   But wait: in the mod_a==0 branch, we check (l-2) % a == 0? \n\n   So we have covered:\n\n        Condition 1: w % a==0 and l % a==0 -> mod_a==0 and l%a==0\n        Condition 2: w % a==0 and (l-2)%a==0 -> mod_a==0 and (l-2)%a==0\n        Condition 3: (w-2)%a==0 and l%a==0 -> mod_a==2 and l%a==0\n        Condition 4: (w-1)%a==0 and (l-1)%a==0 -> mod_a==1 and (l-1)%a==0\n\n   But what about condition 3 in the symmetric form: (w-2)%a==0 and l%a==0? we have that? \n\n   And condition 2: we have that? \n\n   But what about condition 3: (w-2)%a==0 and (l-2)%a==0? -> that is not one of the conditions? \n\n   And condition 4: (w-1)%a==0 and (l-2)%a==0? -> not covered? \n\n   The known conditions are only these four? \n\n   From the editorial: \n        The valid a must be divisors of 2*(w+l)-4 and satisfy one of:\n\n          1. a | w and a | l\n          2. a | w and a | (l-2)\n          3. a | (w-2) and a | l\n          4. a | (w-1) and a | (l-1)\n\n   So we have covered all? \n\n   Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n        if mod_a == 0:\n            if l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n        elif mod_a == 1:\n            if (l-1) % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n        elif mod_a == 2:\n            if l % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: we must be cautious: the modulo operation: \n        (l-2) % a == 0 means that l mod a is 2? \n        But if a is 1, then (l-2)%1 is always 0? \n        Similarly, if a is 2, then (l-2)%2 is the same as l%2? \n\n   However, the code already includes 1 and 2? and we are iterating over divisors? \n\n   But what if a is 1? then we have already added it? so we don't need to add again? \n\n   Similarly, a=2 is already in the set? \n\n   But the set is a set? so duplicates are ignored? \n\n   However, we are iterating over divisors? and a might be 1 or 2 again? \n\n   So we use a set? \n\n   But note: the loop iterates over divisors? and we start with solutions = {1,2}? then we add more? \n\n   But what if a=1 is encountered again? then we try to add 1? which is already there? \n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   But what about the case when a is greater than w or l? \n        For example, a > w? then w % a = w? which is not <=2? unless w<=2? but w>=3? so w % a = w, which is >=3? so we skip? \n\n   Similarly, for l? we only check if the residue of w mod a is <=2? \n\n   Therefore, we skip a that are too large? \n\n   But note: a must be at most 2*(w+l)-4? but we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? which is w+l-2? and the divisors are at most half_perimeter? which is large? but the total number of divisors is small? \n\n   And the problem says the output contains at most 200,000 integers? \n\n   So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        if mod_a == 0:\n            if l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n        elif mod_a == 1:\n            if (l-1) % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n        elif mod_a == 2:\n            if l % a == 0:\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: we must be cautious: the condition (l-2) % a == 0: if l-2 is negative? but l>=3, so l-2>=1? \n\n   Similarly, l-1>=2? \n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   However, what if a is 1? then we have:\n        mod_a = w % 1 -> which is 0? \n        then we check: l % 1 is 0? -> true? and (l-2)%1 is 0? -> true? so we add 1? but 1 is already in the set? \n\n   Similarly, for a=2: \n        mod_a = w % 2 -> which is 0,1, or 2? \n        if 0: then we check l%2? or (l-2)%2? -> note: (l-2)%2 = l%2? so if l%2==0, then we add? if not, then we check (l-2)%2? which is the same? so we add 2? but 2 is already in the set? \n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   But what if a is half_perimeter? which might be large? then w % a = w? which is <=2 only if w<=2? but w>=3? so we skip? \n\n   Therefore, we only consider a that are divisors of half_perimeter and for which w % a is 0,1, or 2? and then we check the corresponding condition on l? \n\n   But note: we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? and then we consider a and div (which is half_perimeter // i)? \n\n   And we do the same check for both? \n\n   So the code for program2.py is:\n\n        for a in [i, div]:\n            mod_a = w % a\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                if mod_a == 0:\n                    if l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0:\n                        solutions.add(a)\n                elif mod_a == 1:\n                    if (l-1) % a == 0:\n                        solutions.add(a)\n                elif mod_a == 2:\n                    if l % a == 0:\n                        solutions.add(a)\n\n   But note: what if a is 1? then we are in the loop? and we do the check? but we already have 1 in the set? so we add it again? but set ignores duplicates? \n\n   Similarly for 2? \n\n   But what if half_perimeter is 1? then the loop doesn't run? but w>=3, l>=3, so half_perimeter = w+l-2>=4? \n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   However, we must consider the possibility that a=1 and a=2 might be divisors? and we are adding them again? but that's okay? \n\n   But note: the set solutions starts with {1,2}? and then we add more? \n\n   But what if a=1 is not a divisor of half_perimeter? then we don't add it? but the problem says a can be 1? and the total area is 2*(w+l)-4? which is divisible by 1? always? so a=1 should always be valid? \n\n   Similarly, a=2: the total area is 2*(w+l)-4? which is even? so divisible by 2? so a=2 should always be valid? \n\n   Therefore, we start with {1,2}? and then we add more? \n\n   But what if the conditions for a=1 or a=2 are not satisfied? \n        For a=1: \n            Condition: \n                mod_a = w % 1 = 0? \n                then we check: l % 1 == 0? -> true? so we add? \n            So condition is always satisfied? \n        For a=2: \n            mod_a = w % 2 -> 0,1, or 2? \n            if 0: then we check l%2==0 or (l-2)%2==0? -> (l-2)%2 = l%2? so if l%2==0, then we have one condition? if not, then (l-2)%2 = (l%2) which is 1? so we don't add? \n            But wait: if w%2==0, then we require l%2==0 or (l-2)%2==0? which is always true? because (l-2)%2 = l%2? and we don't require both? we require one of them? \n            Actually, we are checking: \n                if l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0\n            For a=2: \n                l % 2 is either 0 or 1? \n                (l-2) % 2 = (l%2) ? \n                so if l%2==0, then l%2==0 -> true? \n                if l%2==1, then (l-2)%2 = (1-0) = 1? -> false? \n            So if w%2==0 and l%2==1, then we do not add a=2? \n\n        But the total area is divisible by 2? so why wouldn't a=2 be valid? \n\n        How to tile with a=2 when w is even and l is odd? \n            Example: w=4, l=5? \n            Boundary area: 2*(4+5)-4 = 14? which is divisible by 2? \n            We need to cover the boundary with 1x2 tiles? \n            The boundary: \n                top: 5 units? we can cover with 2 tiles of 2 and one tile of 1? but we don't have 1x1? we have 1x2? \n            How? \n                We can cover the top: \n                    place one tile vertically at the top-left corner? covering the top-left and the left-top? \n                    then the top edge from the second unit to the last: 4 units? which is divisible by 2? \n                Similarly, the bottom: \n                    one tile vertically at the bottom-left? then the bottom edge from the second unit to the last: 4 units? \n                The left: from the second unit to the second last: 2 units? \n                The right: similarly? \n            But the top-left corner: we placed a vertical tile? that covers the entire left edge? but the left edge is 4 units? and the tile is 1x2? so it covers 2 units? \n\n            Actually, we can do:\n                Top edge: we cover the first two units with one tile? then the next two with one tile? and the last unit? we cover it with a tile placed vertically? but the vertical tile at the top-right corner? \n\n            This is possible? \n\n            The known conditions: \n                Condition 4: (w-1) % 2 = (4-1)%2=1 -> not 0? \n                Condition 1: w%2=0, l%2=1 -> not satisfied? \n                Condition 2: w%2=0, (l-2)%2 = (5-2)%2=1 -> not satisfied? \n                Condition 3: (w-2)%2=0, l%2=1 -> satisfied? \n            So we should have a=2? \n\n            But in our code for a=2: \n                mod_a = w % 2 = 0? \n                then we check: l % 2 = 1 -> false? \n                (l-2) % 2 = 1 -> false? \n                so we do not add? \n\n            But condition 3 is satisfied? and we are not checking condition 3 in the branch mod_a=0? \n\n            Condition 3: (w-2)%a==0 and l%a==0? \n                Here, (w-2)%2 = (4-2)%2=0? and l%2=1 -> not satisfied? \n\n            Actually, condition 3 is: (w-2)%a==0 and l%a==0? -> but l%a=1, not 0? \n\n            Condition 2: w%a==0 and (l-2)%a==0? -> (l-2)%2=1, not 0? \n\n            Condition 1: not satisfied? \n            Condition 4: (w-1)%2=1, (l-1)%2=0 -> not satisfied? \n\n            So none of the conditions are satisfied? \n\n            But the total area is divisible by 2? \n\n            How to tile? \n                We can use:\n                  - Condition: the boundary can be covered if we use a combination? \n\n            Known solution: the problem is complex? \n\n        After checking known Codeforces submissions, the valid conditions are:\n\n            Condition 1: w % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n            Condition 2: w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0\n            Condition 3: (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0\n            Condition 4: (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0\n            Condition 5: (w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0   -> new\n            Condition 6: (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0   -> new\n\n        Why? because the boundary has four sides? and the corners can be covered in more ways? \n\n        In the example w=4, l=5, a=2: \n            Condition 6: (w-1)%2 = 3%2=1 -> not 0? \n            Condition 5: (w-2)%2=0, (l-1)%2=0 -> satisfied? \n\n        So we need to add conditions 5 and 6? \n\n        Therefore, the conditions are:\n\n            if mod_a == 0:\n                if l % a == 0 or (l-2) % a == 0 or (l-1) % a == 0:   # but wait, what is the condition for (l-1) in this branch? \n                -> Actually, we need to check all conditions that involve w % a == 0? \n                   condition 1: l % a == 0\n                   condition 2: (l-2) % a == 0\n                   condition 6: (l-1) % a == 0? -> but condition 6 is: (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0? -> not this branch? \n\n        This is getting messy. \n\n        Alternatively, we can check all six conditions? \n\n        But the known solution in the sample code we are given in other submissions is to check:\n\n            def check(a):\n                if 2*(w+l-2) % a != 0:\n                    return False\n                if w % a == 0 and l % a == 0:\n                    return True\n                if w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n                    return True\n                if (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0:\n                    return True\n                if (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0:\n                    return True\n                if (w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0:\n                    return True\n                if (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n                    return True\n                return False\n\n        Then we would do:\n\n            if check(a):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But the problem: we are iterating over divisors of half_perimeter? and then we have a=1 and a=2 initially? \n\n        And then for each divisor a, we check the above conditions? \n\n        But note: the total area condition is already satisfied because a divides half_perimeter? and then 2*(w+l)-4 = 2 * half_perimeter is divisible by a? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                if a in solutions:   # already in? \n                    continue\n                if w % a == 0 and l % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                elif w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                elif (w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                elif (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                elif (w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n                elif (w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0:\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the set solutions already has 1 and 2? and we are iterating over divisors? and a might be 1 or 2? then we skip? \n\n        But what if a=1: \n            w % 1 == 0, l % 1 == 0 -> then we add? but it's already in? \n        a=2: \n            might be added by one of the conditions? \n\n        But the problem: the set might grow large? but the total number of divisors is O(sqrt(half_perimeter))? and the total over test cases is bounded by 200000? \n\n        However, the problem says the output contains at most 200000 integers? \n\n        But the above conditions cover all possibilities? \n\n        But note: the condition (w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0: \n            Example: w=4, l=5, a=2: \n                (4-2)%2=0, (5-1)%2=0 -> true? \n\n        So we add a=2? \n\n        But a=2 is already in the set? so we skip? \n\n        Therefore, we might not need to skip if a is in solutions? because we might have added it at the beginning? \n\n        Alternatively, we can simply add if it satisfies any condition? and the set will handle duplicates? \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n                   (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n                   ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n                   ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n                   ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n                   ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the residues might be negative? but we are using modulo? and a is positive? \n\n        However, the modulo operation in Python for positive a is non-negative? \n\n        But what if (l-2) is negative? then (l-2) % a might be a- (|l-2| % a) if l-2<0? \n            But l>=3, so l-2>=1? \n\n        Similarly, w-2>=1, w-1>=2, l-1>=2? \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n                   (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n                   ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n                   ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n                   ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n                   ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the condition (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) might be written as (w % a == 0) and ((l-2) % a == 0)? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or \\\n               ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        This covers the six conditions.\n\n        But note: the set solutions might already contain a? then add is a no-op? \n\n        So we can do that.\n\n        Given the time, we will output this.\n\n        However, the original code had a condition: if mod_a <= 2: ... \n        But we are not using that anymore? \n\n        But the problem: the set initially has 1 and 2? and then we are iterating over divisors? and for each divisor a, we check the six conditions? \n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n        We can write it in one line.\n\n        But note: the condition might be long? \n\n        Alternatively, we can break it into multiple lines? but the problem says: output only the missing code? \n\n        Since the missing code is in the TODO block, we can write:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        But note: the code already has an if mod_a<=2: ... but we are not using mod_a anymore? \n\n        We should remove the if mod_a<=2 condition? \n\n        Because the new condition does not require mod_a<=2? \n\n        But the original code had:\n\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                div, mod_i = divmod(half_perimeter, i)   # already computed, and we know mod_i==0\n                if mod_i != 0: continue   # skipped if not divisor? \n                ...   # then we have a in [i, div]\n                mod_a = w % a\n                if mod_a <= 2:\n                    ...   # TODO\n\n        We are replacing the TODO block with the new condition? \n\n        But the condition if mod_a<=2 was there to filter? but the new condition might be true even if mod_a>2? \n\n        Example: a=3, w=4, l=5: \n            mod_a = 4 % 3 = 1, which is<=2 -> we enter the if.\n            then we check the conditions: \n                (4%3==0? -> no) and (5%3==0? -> no) -> false\n                (4%3==0? -> no) and (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> false (because first part false)\n                (4-2)%3=2%3=2 -> not 0? -> false\n                (4-1)%3=3%3=0 and (5-1)%3=4%3=1 -> false\n                (4-2)%3=2%3=2 -> not 0 -> false\n                (4-1)%3=0 and (5-2)%3=3%3=0 -> true? \n            so we add a=3? \n\n        And the example says for w=3, l=5, a=3 is valid? but here w=4, l=5? \n        For w=4, l=5, a=3: \n            total area = 2*(4+5)-4=14, not divisible by 3? -> but wait, we are only iterating on divisors of half_perimeter = w+l-2=4+5-2=7? and 3 is not a divisor of 7? so we wouldn't consider a=3? \n\n        Therefore, the condition if mod_a<=2 is not needed? and might filter out valid a? \n\n        For example, a=4: \n            half_perimeter = 7? then 4 is not a divisor of 7? so we skip? \n\n        So the condition if mod_a<=2 is not necessary? and might be harmful? \n\n        Because if a is a divisor of half_perimeter, then we have to check the six conditions? regardless of w % a? \n\n        Therefore, we should remove the if mod_a<=2 condition? \n\n        So the code becomes:\n\n            for a in [i, div]:\n                if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n                    solutions.add(a)\n\n        And remove the mod_a assignment? or keep it? we don't use it? \n\n        We can remove the assignment? \n\n        But the code has:\n\n            mod_a = w % a   # we don't use it anymore? \n\n        We can remove that line? \n\n        But the problem: output only the missing code? and the TODO block is only the part inside the if mod_a<=2: \n\n        We are replacing the entire block? \n\n        So the TODO block is:\n\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace it with:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        And remove the line: mod_a = w % a? \n\n        But the problem: the TODO block is only the part after the if mod_a<=2: \n\n        The current code is:\n\n            if mod_a <= 2:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO block? \n\n        But if we remove the if mod_a<=2, then we change the structure? \n\n        The problem says: missing lines or blocks? \n\n        We are allowed to fill in the block? but not change the existing code? \n\n        However, the existing code might be flawed? \n\n        Given the complexity, and the known solution from Codeforces, we output the six-condition check and remove the if mod_a<=2 condition? \n\n        But the problem: we must output only the missing code? and the TODO block is inside the if mod_a<=2: \n\n        If we remove the if, we are changing more than the TODO block? \n\n        Alternatively, we can simply put the six-condition check inside the if mod_a<=2: and hope that it catches all? \n\n        But note: the condition if mod_a<=2 is not necessary? and might skip valid a? \n\n        For example, a=3, w=1 (but w>=3) -> not possible? \n        a=3, w=3: mod_a=0, which is<=2 -> caught.\n        a=3, w=4: mod_a=1, caught.\n        a=3, w=5: mod_a=2, caught.\n        a=3, w=6: mod_a=0, caught.\n        a=3, w=7: mod_a=1, caught.\n        a=3, w=8: mod_a=2, caught.\n        a=3, w=9: mod_a=0, caught.\n\n        So for a>=3, w>=3, w % a is in the range [0, a-1]? and since a>=3, then w % a can be 0,1,2,...,a-1. But we only consider 0,1,2? \n\n        What if w % a = 3? then we skip? \n\n        Example: a=4, w=7, l= something? \n            half_perimeter = w+l-2 = 7+l-2 = 5+l? \n            We require that a=4 divides half_perimeter? so 5+l must be divisible by 4? \n            l = 3, then half_perimeter=5+3=8, divisible by 4? \n            Then mod_a = 7 % 4 = 3, which is>2? so we skip? \n            But is a=4 valid for w=7, l=3? \n                Conditions:\n                    Condition 1: 7%4=3, 3%4=3 -> not 0.\n                    Condition 2: 7%4=3, (3-2)%4=1 -> not 0.\n                    Condition 3: (7-2)%4=5%4=1, 3%4=3 -> not 0.\n                    Condition 4: (7-1)%4=6%4=2, (3-1)%4=2%4=2 -> not 0.\n                    Condition 5: (7-2)%4=1, (3-1)%4=2 -> not 0.\n                    Condition 6: (7-1)%4=2, (3-2)%4=1 -> not 0.\n                -> not valid? \n            So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, the condition mod_a<=2 might be a heuristic that is always sufficient? \n\n        But to be safe, we will keep the if mod_a<=2 and then do the six-condition check inside? \n\n        Because if mod_a>2, then none of the conditions can be satisfied? \n\n        For example, if w % a = 3, then in the conditions we have:\n            (w % a == 0) -> false.\n            (w % a == 0) -> false.\n            ((w-2) % a == 0) -> (3-2) = 1 -> not 0? \n            ((w-1) % a == 0) -> (3-1)=2 -> not 0? \n            ((w-2) % a == 0) -> 1 -> not 0? \n            ((w-1) % a == 0) -> 2 -> not 0? \n\n        So we don't add? \n\n        Therefore, we can keep the if mod_a<=2 and then do the six-condition check? \n\n        The missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n                solutions.add(a)\n\n        And we leave the if mod_a<=2 in place? \n\n        This is safe.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program2.py the above line.\n\nSummary:\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code (in the else block) is:\n\n    best = i+1 + n - j\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n    else:\n        break\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code (in the TODO block) is:\n\n    if (w % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or (w % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and l % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-2) % a == 0 and (l-1) % a == 0) or ((w-1) % a == 0 and (l-2) % a == 0):\n        solutions.add(a)\n\nWe output in the required JSON format."
