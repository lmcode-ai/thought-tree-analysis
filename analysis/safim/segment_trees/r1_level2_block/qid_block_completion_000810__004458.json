The example: n=6, what is the answer? We need a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d=6 and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). The note doesn't provide n=6, but the sample outputs for n=4,5,7,8,9,10. We can try: \n      We want gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d). Possibilities:\n      One of the known examples: \n        n=4: (1,1,1,1) -> gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1. n=5: (1,2,1,1) -> gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1. n=7: (2,2,2,1) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2. n=8: (2,2,2,2) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2.\n        n=9: (2,4,2,1) -> gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2. n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1. For n=6, we can try: \n      Option: (1,1,1,3) -> then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,3)=3 -> not equal.\n      Option: (1,1,2,2) -> gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(2,2)=2 -> not equal.\n      Option: (1,2,1,2) -> gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,2)=2 -> not equal. Option: (2,2,1,1) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(1,1)=1 -> not equal. Option: (3,1,1,1) -> same as (1,3,1,1): gcd(1,3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works! and 3+1+1+1=6. So we can set: a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1. But the problem: the gcd is gcd(a,b)=gcd(3,1)=1, and lcm(c,d)=lcm(1,1)=1. So that works. Therefore, for n=6, we can do:\n      a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1. But the code currently has for n%4==0: \n      n=4: handled separately. n=8: handled by n%4==0: then a = n-6 = 8-6=2, b=2, c=2, d=2 -> (2,2,2,2) -> works. So for n=6, we can do:\n\n      a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1. But note: the code for n=5 sets: a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1. So in the n=6 branch:\n\n      a=3\n      b=1\n      c=1\n      d=1\n\n  However, the problem says: \"output any 4 positive integers\". But note: the example for n=5: (1,2,1,1) -> but the note says: \"In the second test case\" for program2.py: n=7 -> so n=6 is not in the note examples.",

The examples: \n        n=4: (1,1,1,1)\n        n=5: (1,2,1,1) -> so a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1.

Therefore, the missing code for program2.py in the n=6 branch is:\n\n      a = 3\n      b = 1\n      c = 1\n      d = 1\n\n  But note: 3+1+1+1=6. However, the branch for n%4==0 would handle multiples of 4, and 6 is not a multiple of 4, so we don't need to worry about conflict. So we write for the n=6 branch:\n\n      a = 3\n      b = 1\n      c = 1\n      d = 1 But wait, is there a more general solution?",

For example, for n==5:\n\n          a = c = d = 1\n          b = 2 So we do the same: four assignments, each on a new line, indented by 4 spaces? But the code for n==5 is written in two lines. We can do four lines. Therefore, the final answer:\n\n  program1: three lines: \n      \"a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\n  But note: the existing branch has three lines, each with 8 spaces of indentation (relative to the def solve)?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs with missing parts.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code uses two pointers (a and b) and two sums (suma and sumb). The idea is:\n- We start with a = -1 (so the next candy for Alice is at index0) and b = n (so the next candy for Bob is at index n-1).\n- We have a variable `cur` for the current count of candies eaten and `ans` to record the maximum count when the two sums are equal.\n\nThe while loop continues until the pointers cross. Inside:\n- If suma > sumb, then Bob eats a candy from the right (b decreases, sumb increases, cur increases by 1).\n- If suma < sumb, then Alice should eat a candy from the left (a increases, suma increases, cur increases by 1). But the code for this case is missing.\n- If they are equal, we record the current count as a candidate (ans = cur), then both eat one more candy (so we move both pointers and add the candies, and increase cur by 2).\n\nHowever, note that when they are equal, we are effectively trying to extend the solution by one candy from each side. But we must record the current count as a candidate because we might not get equality again.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total number of candies eaten is the sum of the candies eaten by Alice and Bob. When we have equality, we record the current total (cur) as the candidate for the maximum.\n\nThe missing part for the case `suma < sumb` is symmetric to the `suma > sumb` case.\n\nWe should do:\n    a += 1\n    suma += arr[a]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note: the condition checks if a>=b to break. We are moving a and b until they meet.\n\nHowever, there is a subtlety: when we are in the else (equal) branch, we move both pointers and add two candies. But in the other branches, we only move one pointer and add one candy.\n\nThe problem: the current code for the equal branch might cause the pointers to cross? Let's see: we do a+=1 and b-=1. Then we break if a>=b.\n\nBut note: when we have an odd number of candies and we are in the middle, we might set a = b-1 and then break? Actually, the condition is at the top of the loop.\n\nWe must be cautious: the condition at the top of the loop is `if a>=b: break`. So if after the equal branch we have a==b, then we break. But if we have a = b-1, then we do the loop again? Actually, after the equal branch we set a to a+1 and b to b-1. Then the next time we check: if a>=b? For example, if initially a was 0 and b was 3 (so a=0, b=3 -> then we set a=1, b=2). Then next time we enter the loop: a=1, b=2 -> then we break? No, because 1<2. Then we check the sums.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so the while loop is efficient.\n\nThe missing code for the `suma < sumb` branch is:\n\n    a += 1\n    suma += arr[a]\n    cur += 1\n\nBut note: the initial state: a=-1, so the first time we enter this branch, we set a=0 and take arr[0].\n\nHowever, the code for the `suma>sumb` branch is already provided.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the answer for the fourth test case is 7. Let me check the fourth test case: \nInput: n=10, arr = [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10, 2] \nBut the note says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (so 7+3+20=30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (so 10+8+11+1=30). Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\nHow does the algorithm work?\nWe start: a=-1, suma=0; b=10, sumb=0; cur=0, ans=0.\nThen we enter the loop: since suma==sumb, we set ans=0 (but we are going to update: a becomes 0, b becomes 9; suma=7, sumb=2; cur=2.\nThen: 7>2 -> so we move Bob: b becomes 8, sumb=2+10=12, cur=3.\nThen: 7<12 -> we move Alice: a becomes 1, suma=7+3=10, cur=4.\nThen: 10<12 -> move Alice: a becomes 2, suma=10+20=30, cur=5.\nThen: 30>12 -> move Bob: b becomes 7, sumb=12+8=20, cur=6.\nThen: 30>20 -> move Bob: b becomes 6, sumb=20+11=31, cur=7.\nThen: 30<31 -> move Alice: but a is 2, next would be a=3 -> but then a would be 3 and b=6? Then we break? Actually, we break when a>=b? a=3 and b=6 -> 3<6 so we continue. Then we move Alice: a=3, suma=30+5=35, cur=8. Then 35>31 -> move Bob: b=5, sumb=31+1=32, cur=9. Then 35>32 -> move Bob: b=4, sumb=32+15=47, cur=10. Then 35<47 -> move Alice: a=4 -> but a=4 and b=4 -> then we break? Then we never set ans to 7.\n\nSo what went wrong? The algorithm in the note does not seem to capture the solution.\n\nActually, the note says: Alice eats [7,3,20] and Bob eats [10,8,11,1]. So Alice stops at index2 (0-indexed: 0,1,2) and Bob starts from the right and eats indices 9,8,7,6? The array: \nindex0:7, index1:3, index2:20, index3:5, index4:15, index5:1, index6:11, index7:8, index8:10, index9:2.\n\nBob eats from the right: first candy: index9=2, then index8=10, then index7=8, then index6=11? That would be 2+10+8+11=31, not 30.\n\nWait, the note says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> that would be 10+8+11+1=30. So the candies Bob eats are: \nfrom the right: first candy is 2 (index9), then 10 (index8), then 8 (index7), then 11 (index6) -> but that is 2+10+8+11=31. \nAlternatively, if he eats without the last one? The note says: [10,8,11,1] -> so the 1 is at index5? But then he skipped the 15? That is not contiguous from the right.\n\nThe problem says: Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). So Bob must eat a contiguous segment from the right. The example: Bob eats the first three candies from the right? That would be [2,10,8]? But that is 2+10+8=20, not 30.\n\nActually, the example in the note for the fourth test case: \n\"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\"\n\nBut note: the candies are from left to right: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2]. \nAlice eats from the left: [7,3,20] -> that's the first three.\nBob eats from the right: [10,8,11,1] -> that would be the last four? But the last four are [10,8,11,1]? Actually, the last four are: index6=11, index7=8, index8=10, index9=2? That doesn't match. Alternatively, the last four in the array as given: \nThe array: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2] -> the last four: 2,10,8,11? But that is 2,10,8,11 -> 31.\n\nBut the note says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> that 1 is at index5? Then Bob must have eaten from index5 to index9? But that is not contiguous from the right? The problem says Bob eats from the right without skipping. So he must eat the last k candies.\n\nSo the example might be misstated? Or the array is: \nThe array: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2] \nBob eats the last four: [11,8,10,2]? But that is 11+8+10+2=31, not 30.\n\nAlternatively, Bob eats [1,11,8,10]? That is the segment from index5 to index8: 1+11+8+10=30. But that is not contiguous from the right? Because the last candy is 2 (index9) and he didn't eat it? But the problem says Bob eats from the right without skipping. So he must eat the last k candies. Therefore, he must eat the last candy (2) and then the next one (10) and then 8, then 11? Then that is 2,10,8,11=31.\n\nThis is confusing. But the problem statement says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". So Bob must eat a contiguous segment starting from the last candy and going left. Similarly, Alice must eat a contiguous segment starting from the first candy and going right.\n\nTherefore, the example: \nAlice: [7,3,20] -> total 30.\nBob: [10,8,11,1] -> but that is not contiguous from the right? The contiguous segment from the right that Bob eats must be the last k candies. So if Bob eats the last four, that would be [2,10,8,11]? But that is 2+10+8+11=31.\n\nAlternatively, the array might be: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10]? But the note says n=10.\n\nI see the note says: \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\" and the array has 10 candies. So the array is: \nindices: 0:7, 1:3, 2:20, 3:5, 4:15, 5:1, 6:11, 7:8, 8:10, 9:2.\n\nBob eats [10,8,11,1] -> that would be the candies at indices 8,7,6,5: 10,8,11,1 -> total 30. But that is not contiguous from the right? Because the last candy (index9:2) is not eaten. So Bob skipped the last candy? That is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the example might be incorrect? Or the problem allows non contiguous? But the problem says \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\". So Bob must eat a contiguous block at the right. Therefore, Bob must eat the last k candies.\n\nBut the example says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] which are not the last four? The last four are [2,10,8,11] (if we take the last four: index9,8,7,6). \n\nAlternatively, the array is written from left to right: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2] and Bob eats from the right: so he starts at the right and eats 2, then 10, then 8, then 11? That would be the last four: 2,10,8,11 -> 31.\n\nBut the note says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> that 1 is at index5. So Bob must have eaten from index5 to index8? But that is not contiguous from the right? The problem says \"from the right\", meaning the rightmost segment.\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" meaning he can choose any contiguous segment that is a suffix? So the entire segment from some index j to the end.\n\nTherefore, Bob's segment must be [j, n-1] for some j. So in the example, if Bob eats from index5 to index9: [1,11,8,10,2] -> that is 1+11+8+10+2=32. That is too much.\n\nAlternatively, Bob eats from index6 to index9: [11,8,10,2] = 31.\n\nBut the note says Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> that is 10+8+11+1=30. How can that be a suffix? The suffix of the array is [2,10,8,11,1]? No, the array is [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2] so the suffix of four is [11,8,10,2]? \n\nWait, the array: \nindex0:7\nindex1:3\nindex2:20\nindex3:5\nindex4:15\nindex5:1\nindex6:11\nindex7:8\nindex8:10\nindex9:2\n\nThe suffix of four: starting at index6: [11,8,10,2] -> that is 11+8+10+2=31.\n\nThe suffix of five: starting at index5: [1,11,8,10,2] = 32.\n\nThe suffix of three: [10,8,2]? But that is not contiguous? The suffix of three must be [8,10,2]? 8+10+2=20.\n\nHow do we get 30? The only contiguous suffix that sums to 30? There isn't one.\n\nBut the note says: \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". This is not a contiguous suffix. \n\nI see the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" and the example says \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" for the second test case. That implies that the rightmost three. So it must be contiguous.\n\nTherefore, the example in the note for the fourth test case might be in error? Or the array is different? The problem says: \"the fourth test case\" but doesn't provide the input.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the fourth test case\" and then the example: \nInput: n=10, and the array: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2]? \n\nAlternatively, the array might be: [7,3,20,5,15,10,8,11,1,2]? Then Bob eats the last four: [1,2]? That doesn't work.\n\nI think we must trust the algorithm: the two pointers method is classic for this problem (known as \"two pointers from ends to meet in the middle for equal sum\").\n\nThe known solution for this problem (from known problems like \"Maximum number of candies eaten by two people with equal total weight\") is:\n\nWe use two pointers:\n  left = 0, right = n-1\n  left_sum = 0, right_sum = 0\n  count = 0\n  best = 0\n  while left <= right:\n      if left_sum < right_sum:\n          left_sum += arr[left]\n          left += 1\n          count += 1\n      elif left_sum > right_sum:\n          right_sum += arr[right]\n          right -= 1\n          count += 1\n      else:\n          best = count   # because we are going to add more? Actually, we record when they are equal at a point where we can stop?\n          # But note: we might continue? Actually, we can record the candidate and then try to extend?\n          # However, the known solution is to record the candidate when they are equal and then continue.\n          # But the problem: we want the maximum total candies. So when they are equal, we record the total so far (count) and then we extend by one from each side? \n          # Actually, the provided code does: \n          #   ans = cur   -> record the candidate\n          #   then we extend: a+=1, b-=1, and add the candies, and cur+=2.\n\nBut the known solution for \"Candies\" (CodeForces problem) is:\n\n  left = 0\n  right = n-1\n  left_sum = 0\n  right_sum = 0\n  ans = 0\n  while left <= right:\n      if left_sum < right_sum:\n          left_sum += arr[left]\n          left += 1\n      else:\n          right_sum += arr[right]\n          right -= 1\n      if left_sum == right_sum:\n          ans = left + (n-1-right)   # because left is the count from the left, and n-1-right is the count from the right.\n\nBut note: the provided code uses a different indexing: \n  a starts at -1, and b starts at n. Then:\n      when we move Alice: a increases to a+1, then we add arr[a] and cur increases by 1.\n      when we move Bob: b decreases to b-1, then we add arr[b] and cur increases by 1.\n\nAnd when they are equal, we record the current cur as candidate and then we move both? \n\nBut why move both? The known solution does not do that. The known solution only moves one at a time and checks for equality at every step.\n\nThe provided code structure:\n\n  while True:\n      if a>=b: break\n      elif suma>sumb: move Bob\n      elif suma<sumb: move Alice   [missing code]\n      else: \n          ans = cur   # record candidate\n          then move both Alice and Bob (so we take one more from each side) and update sums and cur.\n\nBut why move both in the equal branch? Because we want to extend the solution? But then we might miss an opportunity to record a candidate? \n\nActually, the candidate is recorded at the moment of equality. Then we extend by one from each side. Then we continue. The next time we have equality, we record a new candidate (which is larger). \n\nBut what if after extending, we break the equality? Then we have a candidate at the previous equality. But the problem: we want the maximum total candies. \n\nHowever, the known solution is to record every time the sums are equal and then take the maximum total candies at that point. The provided code records the last time they were equal? But note: we are moving both pointers at the same time only when they are equal? \n\nAlternatively, we can record the candidate at every equality and then continue without moving both? But then we have to move one of them? \n\nI think the provided code is flawed. The known solution for the problem \"Candies\" (from CodeForces) is:\n\n  t = int(input().strip())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      l = 0\n      r = n-1\n      left_sum = 0\n      right_sum = 0\n      ans = 0\n      while l <= r:\n          if left_sum <= right_sum:\n              left_sum += arr[l]\n              l += 1\n          else:\n              right_sum += arr[r]\n              r -= 1\n          if left_sum == right_sum:\n              ans = l + (n - 1 - r)\n      print(ans)\n\nBut note: the total candies eaten is l (from the left) and (n-1 - r) from the right? Actually, l is the next index for Alice (so she has eaten from 0 to l-1 -> count = l) and Bob has eaten from r+1 to n-1 -> count = n-1 - r.\n\nAnd we update the candidate whenever the sums are equal.\n\nIn the provided code, we have a variable `cur` that counts the total candies eaten. How does it relate? \n  When we move Alice: cur increases by 1 -> because we ate one candy.\n  When we move Bob: cur increases by 1.\n  When we move both: cur increases by 2.\n\nBut in the known solution, we don't have to move both at the same time. We move one at a time and check for equality.\n\nSo the provided code might be an alternative: \n  It tries to extend by one from each side only when the sums are equal? \n\nBut the example test case 2: n=3, [7,7,7] -> the answer is 6? But that means they eat all candies. \n  In the provided code: \n      a=-1, b=3, suma=0, sumb=0, cur=0 -> enter the else: \n          ans=0, then a becomes 0, b becomes 2; suma=7, sumb=7; cur=2.\n      Then we enter the loop: a=0, b=2 -> a<b -> then check: 7==7 -> else branch: \n          ans=2, then a becomes 1, b becomes 1; suma=14, sumb=14; cur=4.\n      Then we break? because a>=b? (1>=1 -> break). Then we print ans=2? which is not 6.\n\nBut the answer should be 6? \n\nSo clearly the provided code is not working for the second test case.\n\nWhat is the second test case? \n  The note: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\nBut the array has only three candies? [7,7,7]. How can Alice eat three from the left and Bob eat three from the right? That would be the same three candies? \n\nThe problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So they cannot eat the same candy.\n\nTherefore, the second test case must be a different array. The note says: \"For the second test case\" but doesn't specify the array. The example in the problem statement for the second test case: \n  Input: n=3, [7,7,7] -> but then Alice eats three from the left? and Bob eats three from the right? That would require six candies, but there are only three.\n\nThe note says: \"the second test case\" in the problem description: \n  \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers\". So the second test case has n=3? and three candies. How can both eat three candies? That would be six candies, but there are only three.\n\nUnless the array has more than three candies? The note says: \"the answer is 6\" and \"all the candies have been eaten\". So there must be six candies? \n\nThe problem says: \"For the second test case\" and then \"n=3\" and then the array of three integers. That is inconsistent.\n\nLooking at the sample input from the problem statement? \n  The first test case: n=1, [10] -> answer=0? but the note says answer=2 for the first test case? \n\nThe first test case in the note: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2\"\n\nBut if n=1, then there is only one candy. Alice eats one from the left: [10]. Bob eats one from the right: the same candy? That is not allowed.\n\nSo the first test case must be n=2? \n\nThe problem says: \"The first line contains an integer t\", then for each test case: first integer n, then n integers.\n\nThe first test case in the sample input might be:\n  t=4\n  test1: n=2, [10,10] -> then Alice eats the first (10), Bob eats the last (10) -> total 2 candies.\n  test2: n=3, [7,7,7] -> but that doesn't work for 6 candies.\n\nActually, the note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\nThis implies that there are six candies: three on the left and three on the right? But the input says n=3? That doesn't match.\n\nUnless the second test case has n=6? and the array is [7,7,7,7,7,7]? Then Alice eats the first three: 7+7+7=21, Bob eats the last three: 7+7+7=21. Total candies: 6.\n\nSo the sample inputs might be:\n  test1: n=2, [10,10] -> answer=2\n  test2: n=6, [7,7,7,7,7,7] -> answer=6\n  test3: n=2, [1,2] -> answer=0\n  test4: n=10, [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2] -> answer=7\n\nBut the problem says for the first test case: n=1? and for the second test case: n=3? \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nGiven the constraints and the provided code structure, I think the intended solution for program1.py is to use two pointers and record the candidate whenever the two sums are equal, and then move one pointer at a time. The known solution is:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      l = 0\n      r = n-1\n      left_sum = 0\n      right_sum = 0\n      ans = 0\n      while l <= r:\n          if left_sum == right_sum:\n              ans = l + (n - 1 - r)   # because l candies on the left and (n-1 - r) on the right\n          if left_sum <= right_sum:\n              left_sum += arr[l]\n              l += 1\n          else:\n              right_sum += arr[r]\n              r -= 1\n      if left_sum == right_sum and l<=r+1:  # but after the loop, we can check? \n          ans = l + (n - 1 - r)\n      print(ans)\n\nBut wait, the above might not work exactly because after the loop we might have an equality.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  t = int(input())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      l = -1\n      r = n\n      left_sum = 0\n      right_sum = 0\n      ans = 0\n      while l < r:\n          if left_sum == right_sum:\n              ans = (l+1) + (n - r)   # because l+1 candies on the left (l is the last index eaten on the left) and n-r on the right.\n          if left_sum <= right_sum:\n              l += 1\n              if l < r:\n                  left_sum += arr[l]\n              else:\n                  break\n          else:\n              r -= 1\n              if l < r:\n                  right_sum += arr[r]\n              else:\n                  break\n      print(ans)\n\nBut the provided code in program1.py has a different structure. We are to complete the missing part.\n\nGiven the provided code in program1.py:\n\n  def solve():\n      n=read()\n      arr=readline()\n      ans,cur=0,0\n      a,suma=-1,0\n      b,sumb=n,0\n      while True:\n          if a>=b: break\n          elif suma>sumb:\n              b-=1\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=1\n          elif suma<sumb:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          else :\n              ans=cur\n              a+=1\n              b-=1\n              suma+=arr[a]\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=2\n      print(ans)\n\nWe see that the code for the 'suma<sumb' branch is missing.\n\nWe complete it symmetrically to the 'suma>sumb' branch:\n\n  a += 1\n  suma += arr[a]\n  cur += 1\n\nBut then we have the issue that the second test case (n=6, [7,7,7,7,7,7]) would be:\n\n  a=-1, b=6, suma=0, sumb=0, cur=0 -> enter else: \n      ans=0, then a=0, b=5, suma=7, sumb=7, cur=2.\n  Then a=0, b=5 -> a<b -> then suma==sumb -> else: \n      ans=2, then a=1, b=4, suma=14, sumb=14, cur=4.\n  Then a=1, b=4 -> a<b -> then suma==sumb -> else:\n      ans=4, then a=2, b=3, suma=21, sumb=21, cur=6.\n  Then a=2, b=3 -> a< b -> then suma==sumb -> else:\n      ans=6, then a=3, b=2 -> then a>=b (3>=2) -> break.\n  Then print(6) -> which is correct.\n\nBut what about the fourth test case: n=10, [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2]?\n\n  We want to achieve 7 candies: Alice: [7,3,20] (index0,1,2) and Bob: [1,11,8,10] (index5,6,7,8) -> but wait, Bob's segment must be contiguous from the right? \n  The array: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10,2]\n  Bob's contiguous segment from the right would be the last four: [2,10,8,11] -> sum=31, not 30.\n\n  Alternatively, if Bob eats the segment from index5 to index8: [1,11,8,10] -> sum=30, but that is not contiguous from the right? The contiguous from the right must include index9? \n\n  Therefore, the example might be using non contiguous segments? But the problem says they must be contiguous from the left for Alice and contiguous from the right for Bob.\n\n  How can the answer be 7? \n  Alice: [7,3,20] -> indices0,1,2 -> suma=30.\n  Bob: must eat a contiguous suffix: the last k candies. The only suffix that sums to 30 is the last three: [8,10,2] -> 8+10+2=20 -> not 30.\n  or last four: [11,8,10,2] = 31.\n  last five: [1,11,8,10,2] = 32.\n\n  There is no suffix that sums to 30.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\" -> which is not a suffix. It is a suffix of the entire array if we remove the last candy? But then it is not contiguous.\n\n  I think there is a mistake in the example explanation. The intended solution by the two pointers might be:\n\n  We simulate:\n\n      a=-1, b=10, suma=0, sumb=0, cur=0.\n      enter else: -> record ans=0, then a=0, b=9, suma=7, sumb=2, cur=2.\n      then suma>sumb? 7>2 -> move Bob: b=8, sumb=2+10=12, cur=3.\n      then suma=7, sumb=12 -> move Alice: a=1, suma=7+3=10, cur=4.\n      then suma=10, sumb=12 -> move Alice: a=2, suma=10+20=30, cur=5.\n      then suma=30, sumb=12 -> move Bob: b=7, sumb=12+8=20, cur=6.\n      then suma=30, sumb=20 -> move Bob: b=6, sumb=20+11=31, cur=7.\n      then suma=30, sumb=31 -> move Alice: a=3, suma=30+5=35, cur=8.\n      then break when a>=b? a=3, b=6 -> 3<6, so continue.\n      then suma=35, sumb=31 -> move Bob: b=5, sumb=31+1=32, cur=9.\n      then suma=35, sumb=32 -> move Bob: b=4, sumb=32+15=47, cur=10.\n      then a=3, b=4 -> a<b -> then suma=35, sumb=47 -> move Alice: a=4, suma=35+15=50, cur=11, then a=4, b=4 -> break.\n      then print(ans) -> but the last time we set ans was when? only in the else branch. We set ans=0, then ans=2, then we never set it again.\n\n  So the output would be 2, but the expected answer is 7.\n\n  Therefore, the provided code structure is flawed. The candidate for the answer should be recorded every time the sums are equal, not only when we are in the else branch and then extend.\n\n  We should change the else branch to record the candidate and then do one of the moves? or change the structure.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are only allowed to complete the missing part for the 'suma<sumb' branch.\n\n  Given the constraints, we must complete the 'suma<sumb' branch as:\n\n      a += 1\n      suma += arr[a]\n      cur += 1\n\n  And hope that the provided code works for the test cases.\n\n  However, the fourth test case does not work.\n\n  Alternatively, the note for the fourth test case might be in error and the intended answer is 0? or 2? \n\n  But the problem says: \"the answer is 7\".\n\n  I think there is a known issue with the provided code. The known solution for this problem (from CodeForces) is to record the candidate at every equality, not only when you are about to extend.\n\n  We should change the else branch to:\n\n      ans = cur   # record the candidate\n      # and then we have to move one of them? or both? \n      # But the provided code moves both. \n\n  But then we might miss the candidate at the last equality.\n\n  Alternatively, we can record the candidate and then move one of them arbitrarily? But that might break.\n\n  Given the time, and since we are only allowed to complete the missing part, we do:\n\n      a += 1\n      suma += arr[a]\n      cur += 1\n\n  for the 'suma<sumb' branch.\n\n  And hope that the test cases are such that the only time we have equality is when we are about to extend and then we get the maximum candidate.\n\n  But the fourth test case does not work.\n\n  Let me try a different approach: the known solution that passes on CodeForces for the problem \"Candies\" (I recall a problem like this: actually the problem is https://codeforces.com/contest/1476/problem/B)\n\n  But wait, the problem ID is not given.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might be https://codeforces.com/contest/1840/problem/D? no.\n\n  I found: https://codeforces.com/contest/1729/problem/C? no.\n\n  There is a problem \"Candy Party\" but not matching.\n\n  Given the constraints, we must output the missing code.\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n      a += 1\n      suma += arr[a]\n      cur += 1\n\n  For program2.py, we have to complete the case for n==6.\n\n  The code for program2.py:\n\n      for _ in range(int(input())):\n          n = int(input())\n\n          if n == 4:\n              a = b = c = d = 1\n\n          elif n == 5:\n              a = c = d = 1\n              b = 2\n\n          elif n == 6:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n          elif n%4 == 0:\n              c = d = b = 2\n              a = n-6\n\n          elif n%4 == 1:\n              d = 1\n              c = 2\n              a = 2\n              b = n-5\n\n          elif n%4 == 2:\n              d = 1\n              c = 1\n              a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n              b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n\n          else:\n              d = 1\n              c = 2\n              b = 2\n              a = n-5\n\n          print(a, b, c, d)\n\n  We need to handle n=6.\n\n  The example: n=6, what is the answer? \n      We need a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d=6 and gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d).\n\n  The note doesn't provide n=6, but the sample outputs for n=4,5,7,8,9,10.\n\n  We can try: \n      We want gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d).\n\n  Possibilities:\n      One of the known examples: \n        n=4: (1,1,1,1) -> gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n        n=5: (1,2,1,1) -> gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n        n=7: (2,2,2,1) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2.\n        n=8: (2,2,2,2) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2.\n        n=9: (2,4,2,1) -> gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2.\n        n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n  For n=6, we can try: \n      Option: (1,1,1,3) -> then gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,3)=3 -> not equal.\n      Option: (1,1,2,2) -> gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(2,2)=2 -> not equal.\n      Option: (1,2,1,2) -> gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,2)=2 -> not equal.\n      Option: (2,2,1,1) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(1,1)=1 -> not equal.\n      Option: (3,1,1,1) -> same as (1,3,1,1): gcd(1,3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works! and 3+1+1+1=6.\n\n  So we can set: a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1.\n\n  But the problem: the gcd is gcd(a,b)=gcd(3,1)=1, and lcm(c,d)=lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n  So that works.\n\n  Therefore, for n=6, we can do:\n      a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1.\n\n  But the code currently has for n%4==0: \n      n=4: handled separately.\n      n=8: handled by n%4==0: then a = n-6 = 8-6=2, b=2, c=2, d=2 -> (2,2,2,2) -> works.\n\n  So for n=6, we can do:\n\n      a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1.\n\n  But note: the code for n=5 sets: a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1.\n\n  So in the n=6 branch:\n\n      a=3\n      b=1\n      c=1\n      d=1\n\n  However, the problem says: \"output any 4 positive integers\". \n\n  But note: the example for n=5: (1,2,1,1) -> but the note says: \n        \"In the second test case\" for program2.py: n=7 -> so n=6 is not in the note examples.\n\n  We can output (3,1,1,1) or (1,3,1,1) or (1,1,1,3) etc. But the variables are a, b, c, d.\n\n  The condition: gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d). \n      If we set a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1: \n          gcd(3,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n  But the problem might expect a specific order? The examples: \n        n=4: (1,1,1,1)\n        n=5: (1,2,1,1) -> so a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1.\n\n  So we set:\n\n      a=3\n      b=1\n      c=1\n      d=1\n\n  However, the note for n=10: (3,5,1,1) -> so a=3, b=5, c=1, d=1.\n\n  So we can do similarly for n=6: a=3, b=1, c=1, d=1.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py in the n=6 branch is:\n\n      a = 3\n      b = 1\n      c = 1\n      d = 1\n\n  But note: 3+1+1+1=6.\n\n  However, the branch for n%4==0 would handle multiples of 4, and 6 is not a multiple of 4, so we don't need to worry about conflict.\n\n  So we write for the n=6 branch:\n\n      a = 3\n      b = 1\n      c = 1\n      d = 1\n\n  But wait, is there a more general solution? The problem says we can output any. And this works.\n\n  Therefore, the missing parts are:\n\n  program1.py: \n      in the branch `elif suma<sumb:`\n          a += 1\n          suma += arr[a]\n          cur += 1\n\n  program2.py:\n      in the branch `elif n==6:`\n          a = 3\n          b = 1\n          c = 1\n          d = 1\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and in the format: \n      {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n  We must output the exact code for the missing parts.\n\n  For program1.py, the missing code is a block of 3 lines. We output:\n\n      a += 1\n      suma += arr[a]\n      cur += 1\n\n  For program2.py, the missing code is 4 lines (assigning a, b, c, d). We output:\n\n      a = 3\n      b = 1\n      c = 1\n      d = 1\n\n  But note: the existing code for other branches uses the same variable names.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the code for program2.py has the branch for n==6, and we are to fill the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer in JSON:\n\n  {\n    \"program1\": \"a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"a = 3\\n    b = 1\\n    c = 1\\n    d = 1\"\n  }\n\n  But note: the indentation in program1.py: the current code in the while loop is indented by 4 or 8? The provided code:\n\n      while True:\n          if a>=b: break\n          elif suma>sumb:\n              b-=1\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=1\n          elif suma<sumb:\n              # TODO: Your code here   [we replace this with 3 lines, indented by 8 spaces? or 12?]\n\n  In the provided code, the body of the while loop is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the while). The existing branch has 12 spaces for the inner block? Actually, the existing branch for suma>sumb has:\n\n          elif suma>sumb:\n              b-=1\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=1\n\n  So each line is indented by 12 spaces (if the while is at 4, then the block is 8, and the inner if/elif is 8, then the body of the elif is 12). But in the given code, it is:\n\n  while True:\n      if a>=b: break\n      elif suma>sumb:\n          b-=1\n          sumb+=arr[b]\n          cur+=1\n\n  So the body of the elif is indented by 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, for the missing code, we use 8 spaces per indent? But the existing code in the branch has 8 spaces for the body.\n\n  So we output:\n\n      program1: \n          \"a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\n      (each line with 8 spaces at the beginning? but the existing code in the branch has 8 spaces for the body)\n\n  However, the code we are replacing is at the same level as the existing branch. So we use the same indentation.\n\n  In the given code, the existing branch has:\n\n          elif suma>sumb:\n              b-=1\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=1\n\n  The missing branch should be:\n\n          elif suma<sumb:\n              a += 1\n              suma += arr[a]\n              cur += 1\n\n  So the three lines are indented by 12 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the structure:\n\n  while True:\n      if ...: ...\n      elif ...: \n          ...   [this is indented by 8 spaces relative to the 'elif'?]\n\n  In Python, the body of the elif is a block and must be indented. The existing code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n  The provided code:\n\n  def solve():\n      ...   [4 spaces]\n      while True:\n          if ...: ...   [8 spaces]\n          elif ...: \n              ...   [12 spaces]\n\n  So we use 12 spaces for the body of the elif.\n\n  But in the string we output, we should have the exact code including the same indentation.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the code that would be placed in the TODO.\n\n  So for program1, the missing code is three lines, each starting with 12 spaces? \n\n  But the existing code in the suma>sumb branch is written without extra indentation in the problem statement? \n\n  In the problem statement, the code for the suma>sumb branch is:\n\n          elif suma>sumb:\n              b-=1\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=1\n\n  And the TODO is:\n\n          elif suma<sumb:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n              a += 1\n              suma += arr[a]\n              cur += 1\n\n  So the three lines should be at the same indentation level as the body of the suma>sumb branch.\n\n  Therefore, we output the three lines without any extra indentation beyond the existing 8 (or 12) spaces? \n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact indentation level. However, in the context, the code we are completing has the body of the elif indented by one level (which is typically 4 spaces). \n\n  Since the existing branch has:\n\n          elif suma>sumb:\n              b-=1\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=1\n\n  We do similarly for the missing branch.\n\n  So we output the three lines with the same indentation as the existing branch's body.\n\n  For program2, the missing code is in the branch:\n\n      elif n==6:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace with:\n\n      elif n==6:\n          a = 3\n          b = 1\n          c = 1\n          d = 1\n\n  But the existing code in other branches uses 4 spaces for the body? \n\n  For example, for n==5:\n\n          a = c = d = 1\n          b = 2\n\n  So we do the same: four assignments, each on a new line, indented by 4 spaces? \n\n  But the code for n==5 is written in two lines. We can do four lines.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n  program1: three lines: \n      \"a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\n  But note: the existing branch has three lines, each with 8 spaces of indentation (relative to the def solve)? \n\n  Actually, in the provided code for program1, the while loop is at 4 spaces, the if/elif are at 8 spaces, and the body of the if/elif are at 12 spaces.\n\n  But in the problem statement, the code is:\n\n          while True:\n              if a>=b: break\n              elif suma>sumb:\n                  b-=1\n                  sumb+=arr[b]\n                  cur+=1\n              elif suma<sumb:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So the body of the elif should be indented by 12 spaces (three levels: 4 for function, 4 for while, 4 for elif). \n\n  Therefore, the three lines should be indented by 12 spaces. But in the string we output, we cannot see the exact indentation of the surrounding code.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO, and it should be at the same indentation level as the existing branch.\n\n  So we output the three lines with the same indentation as the existing branch's body. In the existing branch, the body is written without extra leading spaces in the problem statement? \n\n  In the problem statement, the existing branch body is:\n\n                  b-=1\n                  sumb+=arr[b]\n                  cur+=1\n\n  So we output:\n\n                  a += 1\n                  suma += arr[a]\n                  cur += 1\n\n  But that has 16 or 18 spaces? \n\n  Alternatively, we output without worrying about the exact spaces and hope that the environment uses 4-space indentation? \n\n  Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we output the code with the minimal required indentation. The existing branch in the problem statement is shown with 8 spaces of indentation (relative to the while) but in the actual code it might be 4 or 8.\n\n  Given the instructions, we output the code as it would appear in the program, at the correct indentation level.\n\n  We assume the program uses 4-space indentation per level.\n\n  The structure:\n\n  def solve():\n  ...4 spaces: n=read()\n  ...4 spaces: arr=readline()\n  ...4 spaces: ans,cur=0,0\n  ...4 spaces: a,suma=-1,0\n  ...4 spaces: b,sumb=n,0\n  ...4 spaces: while True:\n  ........8 spaces: if a>=b: break\n  ........8 spaces: elif suma>sumb:\n  ...............12 spaces: b-=1\n  ...............12 spaces: sumb+=arr[b]\n  ...............12 spaces: cur+=1\n  ........8 spaces: elif suma<sumb:\n  ...............12 spaces: a += 1\n  ...............12 spaces: suma += arr[a]\n  ...............12 spaces: cur += 1\n  ........8 spaces: else:\n  ...............12 spaces: ans=cur\n  ...............12 spaces: a+=1\n  ...............12 spaces: b-=1\n  ...............12 spaces: suma+=arr[a]\n  ...............12 spaces: sumb+=arr[b]\n  ...............12 spaces: cur+=2\n  ...4 spaces: print(ans)\n\n  Therefore, for program1, the missing code is three lines, each indented by 12 spaces (which is 12 spaces at the beginning of the line).\n\n  But in the output, we cannot use 12 spaces literally because the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the existing code in the problem statement for the branch is shown with 8 spaces? \n\n  We must output the exact code that would be pasted into the TODO.\n\n  Since the TODO is at the same level as the comments, and the existing branch has three lines of code at the same indentation, we output the three lines with the same indentation as the existing branch.\n\n  How many spaces? The existing branch in the problem statement is:\n\n          elif suma>sumb:\n              b-=1\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=1\n\n  The body is indented by 4 spaces relative to the 'elif'? \n\n  In the problem statement, the 'elif' is at 8 spaces, and the body is at 12 spaces.\n\n  So we output for program1:\n\n      \"        a += 1\\n        suma += arr[a]\\n        cur += 1\"\n\n  But that would be 8 spaces? That might be not enough.\n\n  Alternatively, we count the spaces in the provided code for the existing branch: in the problem statement, the existing branch body is indented by 8 spaces (because the while is at 4, the elif at 8, and the body at 12). But in the text, it is represented as 8 spaces? \n\n  I think we should output the code as it would be in the program, with 12 spaces for each line of the body.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \n          \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\"\n\n  (each line has 12 spaces at the beginning)\n\n  But that might be too many.\n\n  Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the three lines of the body, we output the three lines without any extra indentation and assume the environment will adjust the indentation.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the code that would be placed in the TODO.\n\n  The TODO is at a certain indentation level. We output the three lines at the same indentation level as the existing branch's body.\n\n  In the provided code in the problem statement, the existing branch's body is written with 8 spaces of indentation (relative to the left margin) for the first non-whitespace character? \n\n  Let me count in the problem statement:\n\n  The code for the existing branch:\n\n          elif suma>sumb:\n              b-=1\n              sumb+=arr[b]\n              cur+=1\n\n  The first line of the body: \"b-=1\" is at the same level as the comment in the TODO: \n\n          elif suma<sumb:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So the body should be at the same level. Therefore, we output the three lines with the same indentation as the comment, which is one level of indentation (probably 4 spaces) more than the 'elif'.\n\n  Since the 'elif' is at 8 spaces, the body is at 12 spaces.\n\n  So we output for program1:\n\n      \"    a += 1\\n    suma += arr[a]\\n    cur += 1\"\n\n  with 4 spaces per indent? and the body is one indent (4 spaces) more than the 'elif'. But the 'elif' is at 8 spaces, so the body should be at 12 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, we output each line starting with 12 spaces.\n\n  But 12 spaces is:\n\n      for i in range(12): ' '\n\n  We can do:\n\n      program1_str = \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\"\n\n  For program2, the missing code is in the branch for n==6, and we output:\n\n      \"    a = 3\\n    b = 1\\n    c = 1\\n    d = 1\"\n\n  with 4 spaces of indentation for each line (because the branch is at 4 spaces and the body should be at 8 spaces? but the existing branch for n==5 has the body at 4 spaces? \n\n  In program2, the code:\n\n      if n == 4:\n          a = b = c = d = 1\n\n      elif n == 5:\n          a = c = d = 1\n          b = 2\n\n      elif n == 6:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The body of the if/elif branches are at 8 spaces? or 4? \n\n  In the problem statement, the body for n==4 and n==5 is written at 8 spaces? \n\n  For example:\n\n      if n == 4:\n          a = b = c = d = 1\n\n  The assignment is at 8 spaces.\n\n  So for n==6, we output:\n\n          a = 3\n          b = 1\n          c = 1\n          d = 1\n\n  with 8 spaces per line? \n\n  But in the string, we output with 4 spaces? \n\n  We output exactly as it would be in the program: each line of the body indented by 4 spaces relative to the 'elif'? \n\n  Since the 'elif' is at 4 spaces, the body should be at 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, for program2, we output:\n\n      \"        a = 3\\n        b = 1\\n        c = 1\\n        d = 1\"\n\n  (each line has 8 spaces at the beginning)\n\n  But that might be overkill.\n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the body of the branch, we output the code without any extra indentation and hope the indentation is corrected by the context.\n\n  However, the instructions are to output the exact code that would be pasted.\n\n  We decide to use the same indentation as the existing branches in the provided code.\n\n  For program1, the existing branch has the body at 12 spaces (three levels: 4 for function, 4 for while, 4 for the branch). So we use 12 spaces.\n\n  For program2, the existing branch for n==5 has two lines, each at 8 spaces (because the 'elif' is at 4 spaces, and the body is 4 more). So we use 8 spaces.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n  program1: \n      completion: \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\"\n\n  program2:\n      completion: \"        a = 3\\n        b = 1\\n        c = 1\\n        d = 1\"\n\n  But note: in the program2, the branch for n==5 has:\n\n          a = c = d = 1\n          b = 2\n\n  which is two lines, each at 8 spaces.\n\n  We are outputting four lines, each at 8 spaces.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Let's output the JSON.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  We output:\n\n  {\n    \"program1\": \"            a += 1\\n            suma += arr[a]\\n            cur += 1\",\n    \"program2\": \"        a = 3\\n        b = 1\\n        c = 1\\n        d = 1\"\n  }\n\n  But wait, in program1, the variable name is 'suma', not 'suma'. In the provided code, it is 'suma'. \n\n  And in the program2, we use 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  We are done."
