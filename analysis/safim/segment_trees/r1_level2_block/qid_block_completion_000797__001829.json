    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The current code has a while loop that uses two pointers (l and r) and two sums (a for Alice and b for Bob). The idea is to have Alice start from the left and Bob from the right, and we try to balance the two sums. When the sums are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (which is l from the left and (len(n)-1 - r) from the right, so total = l + (len(n)-1 - r) but note that the current code uses `f = len(n)-r+l-1` which is (l) + (len(n)-1 - r) = l + (n-1 - r) = l + n - 1 - r, but note that the total candies eaten is the number of candies Alice has eaten (l) plus the number Bob has eaten (n-1 - r). However, note that the indices: l starts at 0 and r at len(n)-1. When we add a candy to Alice, we do l+=1 (so l becomes the next left index and also the count of candies Alice has eaten). Similarly, when Bob eats a candy, we do r-=1 and that candy is counted.\n\nThe current code has:\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a += n[l]\n            l += 1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to complete the elif block. The condition is when Bob's current sum is less than Alice's, so we should add a candy to Bob. We do:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: after that, we have an if condition that checks if a==b and then sets f to the current total candies eaten. However, we must note that after adding to Bob, we might break the condition and then the loop might end. Also, we must update the total when a==b.\n\nBut note: the current code does not have an update for Bob in the missing part. So we add:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nHowever, note that the condition in the while loop is l<=r. We are moving l and r until they cross.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that the total candies eaten is the sum of the candies eaten by Alice and Bob. And when a==b, we set f to the current total. We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten. The code prints f at the end. However, note that the initial value of f is 0. So if no equal sum is found, it prints 0.\n\nBut the note in the problem: for the third test case, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is just two lines.\n\nBut note: the current code has an if condition for a<=b and then an elif for b<a. We must complete the elif.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nBut note: the code uses 4 variables: a,b,l,f. We are updating b and r.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem is about swapping letters in a string that is n times \"BAN\" so that \"BAN\" is not a subsequence. We are to output the minimum number of operations and the operations.\n\nThe given code handles:\n  if n==1: \n        print(1)\n        print(1,2)\n\n  elif n%2:  (i.e., n is odd)\n        print(int((n+1)/2))\n        for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n            print(e, e + int((3*n)/2))\n\n  else: (n is even)\n        print(int(n/2))\n        for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to complete the else part.\n\nLooking at the odd case: \n    It prints (n+1)//2 as the number of operations.\n    Then it loops with e starting at 2, then 5, 8, ... (step 3) until it reaches int((3*n+1)/2)+1.\n\nWhat is the pattern?\nFor n=1 (odd) we have an operation: (1,2) but note the code for n==1 is separate.\n\nFor n=2 (even): we are to output n/2 = 1 operation. The example in the note: swap s(2)_2 and s(2)_6 -> so indices 2 and 6 (1-indexed).\n\nThe string \"BANBAN\" has indices: \n  1: 'B'\n  2: 'A'\n  3: 'N'\n  4: 'B'\n  5: 'A'\n  6: 'N'\n\nThe example swaps index2 and index6: so we get:\n  index2 becomes 'N' and index6 becomes 'A'. The string becomes: \n      B (from1), N (from2), N (from3), B (from4), A (from5), A (from6) -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\nHow does the code for n=2 (even) work?\nIn the else part, we are to output one operation. The loop runs for e in range(2, ...) and we need to output one line.\n\nThe loop in the odd case: \n    for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n        print(e, e + int((3*n)/2))\n\nFor n=2 (even): \n    The loop should run for e in range(2, int((3*2+1)/2)+1, 3) -> int((6+1)/2)=int(7/2)=3, so the range is from 2 to 3 (exclusive) with step 3 -> only e=2.\n\nThen we need to print: e and e + int((3*n)/2) = 2 + int(6/2)=2+3=5? But the example swapped 2 and 6, not 2 and 5.\n\nWait, the example swapped index2 and index6. So for n=2, we want to swap 2 and 6.\n\nBut note: the odd case for n=3 (which is odd) uses:\n    operations: (3+1)//2 = 2 operations.\n    The loop: e in range(2, int((9+1)/2)+1, 3) -> int(10/2)=5, so e in [2, 5) with step 3 -> e=2 and then e=5? \n        Then we print for e=2: 2 and 2 + int(9/2)=2+4=6 -> (2,6)\n        for e=5: 5 and 5+4=9 -> (5,9)\n\nBut the string for n=3: \n  indices: \n    1: B, 2: A, 3: N, 4: B, 5: A, 6: N, 7: B, 8: A, 9: N\n\nAfter swapping (2,6): \n  index2 becomes the original index6: 'N'\n  index6 becomes the original index2: 'A'\n  Then swap (5,9):\n      index5 becomes the original index9: 'N'\n      index9 becomes the original index5: 'A'\n\nSo the string becomes:\n  1: B, 2: N, 3: N, 4: B, 5: N, 6: A, 7: B, 8: A, 9: A -> \"BNNBNNABA\"\n\nBut we need to avoid \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\nNow for even n, we want to do n/2 operations. The example for n=2: one operation swapping (2,6). How can we generalize?\n\nIn the even case, the loop runs for e in range(2, int((3*n+1)/2)+1, 3). The number of operations is n/2, and the step is 3 so we get n/2 operations? \n\nBut note: the range(2, ..., 3) for n=2: only one value (e=2). Then we need to print two indices.\n\nWhat should we print? The example swapped (2,6). How is 6 computed? \n  The total length is 3*n = 6. The last index is 6. \n\nIn the odd case, we did: e and e + (3*n)//2. For n=3, (3*3)//2 = 4 (integer division). But note: 3*n is 9, and 9//2 is 4 (integer division). \n\nBut for n=2: (3*2)//2 = 3. Then we would have printed (2, 2+3=5) but that is (2,5) which is not the example (2,6). \n\nSo what is the pattern? \n\nLooking at the example for n=2: we swapped the second character (which is the 'A' in the first \"BAN\") with the last character (which is the 'N' in the second \"BAN\"). \n\nIn general, we want to swap the 'A' in the i-th BAN with the last character of the (n-i+1)-th BAN? \n\nBut note the example for n=1: swapped (1,2) -> which is the first character (B) and the second (A). But wait, the example swapped index1 and index2? Actually the example says: swap s(1)_1 and s(1)_2 -> so (1,2). \n\nBut the code for n=1 is separate.\n\nFor n=2: we swapped index2 (which is the second character, the first 'A') and index6 (the last character, the last 'N').\n\nFor n=3: we swapped index2 (first 'A') with index6 (the last character of the second BAN? but note the second BAN ends at index6, and the third BAN ends at index9) and then index5 (the second 'A', which is the second character of the second BAN) with index9 (the last character of the third BAN).\n\nSo the pattern: \n  We are swapping the 'A' in the k-th BAN (which is at position 3*(k-1)+2) with the last character of the (n - k + 1)-th BAN (which is at position 3*(n - k + 1)).\n\nBut note: the k-th BAN: \n  k=1: positions 1,2,3 -> last character at 3\n  k=2: positions 4,5,6 -> last character at 6\n  k=3: positions 7,8,9 -> last character at 9\n\nSo for k=1, we swap the A at position 2 with the last character of the (n)th BAN (which is 3*n) -> but wait, for n=2: k=1: swap 2 with 3*2=6 -> that matches.\n\nFor k=2: we would swap the A at position 5 with the last character of the (n-1)th BAN? for n=3: k=2: swap 5 with the last character of the (3-2+1)=2nd BAN -> which is 6? but the code swapped 5 with 9.\n\nWait, the example for n=3 swapped 2 with 6 and 5 with 9. So k=1: swap 2 with 6 (which is the last character of the 2nd BAN? but 2nd BAN ends at 6) and k=2: swap 5 with 9 (the last character of the 3rd BAN). \n\nActually, we are swapping the k-th A (at index = 3*(k-1)+2) with the last character of the (n - k + 1)-th BAN (which is at index = 3*(n - k + 1)). \n\nFor k=1: \n   index1 = 3*(0)+2 = 2\n   index2 = 3*(n - 1 + 1) = 3*n\n\nFor k=2:\n   index1 = 3*(1)+2 = 5\n   index2 = 3*(n - 2 + 1) = 3*(n-1)\n\nBut for n=3: 3*(3-1)=6? but we swapped with 9. \n\nAlternatively, we are swapping the k-th A with the last character of the k-th BAN from the end? The last BAN is at position 3*n, the one before at 3*n-3, then 3*n-6, etc.\n\nBut note: the last character of the j-th BAN from the beginning is at 3*j. The j-th BAN from the end is the (n - j + 1)-th from the beginning? Then the last character of the j-th BAN from the end is 3*(n - j + 1).\n\nBut in the swap for the k-th A (which is in the k-th BAN from the beginning) we want to swap with the last character of the k-th BAN from the end? That would be 3*(n - k + 1).\n\nSo for k=1: 3*(n-1+1)=3*n -> so for n=2: 3*2=6 -> (2,6) -> correct.\n        for n=3: k=1: (2, 9) -> but the code for n=3 (odd) swapped (2,6) and (5,9). \n\nThat doesn't match.\n\nLooking at the odd case in the code: \n    for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n        print(e, e + int((3*n)/2))\n\nFor n=3: \n    e starts at 2, then 5 (step 3). \n    For e=2: we print (2, 2 + int(9/2)) -> 2+4=6 -> (2,6)\n    For e=5: (5,5+4=9) -> (5,9)\n\nSo the second index is computed as e + (3*n)//2. Note: (3*n)//2 for n=3 is 9//2=4 (integer division). \n\nBut for n=2 (even): \n    We want to do one operation: and we want to swap (2,6). \n    How to compute 6? 2 + (3*2)//? \n\nIf we use the same formula: e + (3*n)//2 -> for e=2: 2 + (6)//2 = 2+3=5 -> but that is (2,5) which is not 6.\n\nAlternatively, note that the example for n=2 swapped (2,6). 6 is 3*2 = 6. \n\nBut the odd case for n=3: the first swap is (2,6) and 6 = 3*2 (which is the end of the second BAN) but also 6 = 3*n - 3? for n=3: 9-3=6. \n\nAlternatively, we can see that the second index is 3*n - (e - 2) or something? \n\nActually, note the pattern of the swaps in the odd case: \n   e=2 -> swap with 6 (which is 3*n - 3? for n=3: 9-3=6) \n   e=5 -> swap with 9 (which is 3*n)\n\nBut 2 and 5: 5 = 2+3. And 6 and 9: 9=6+3.\n\nSo for the k-th swap (k starting at 0) we swap:\n   left index = 2 + 3*k\n   right index = (3*n) - 3*k\n\nFor k=0: left=2, right=3*n (which for n=3 is 9? but the code did 6 for the first swap in n=3).\n\nWait, the code for n=3: first swap (2,6) and second swap (5,9). \n   left indices: 2,5 -> which are 2+0, 2+3\n   right indices: 6,9 -> which are 6+0, 6+3? but 6 is 3*n - 3? \n\nWe can express the right index as: 3*n - 3*(k) for k=0: 9-0=9? but we got 6.\n\nAlternatively, the right index for the k-th swap: 3*(n - k) \n\nFor k=0: 3*(3-0)=9 -> but we want 6 for the first swap.\n\nHow about: 3*(n - k) - (3 - 2) ? \n\nAnother idea: the code in the odd case uses: \n    e + int((3*n)/2)\n\nFor n=3: 3*n/2 = 4.5 -> integer division in Python: 4.5 becomes 4? but note the code uses int((3*n)/2) -> for n=3: 9/2=4.5 -> int(4.5)=4? but in the code: \n    for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3): \n        print(e, e + int((3*n)/2))\n\nBut note: (3*n)/2 for n=3 is 9/2=4.5 -> int(4.5)=4? but in the example the code does: \n        print(int((n+1)/2))   # for n=3: (3+1)/2=2 -> integer? \n        and then the for loop: \n            e in range(2, int((9+1)/2)+1, 3) -> int(10/2)=5, so range(2,6,3) -> [2,5] (since 5<6, then next 5+3=8 which is >=6 -> stop). \n        Then for e=2: 2+int(9/2) -> 2+4=6 -> (2,6)\n        for e=5: 5+4=9 -> (5,9)\n\nSo the formula for the second index is: e + (3*n)//2? but note: 3*n//2 in integer division: 9//2=4.\n\nBut for n=2: 3*2=6, 6//2=3. Then for e=2: 2+3=5 -> but we want 6.\n\nSo what is the difference? The example for n=2 swapped with 6, which is 3*2. \n\nLooking at the even case: we want to swap the k-th A (at 2+3*(k-1)) with the last character of the (n-k+1)-th BAN (at 3*(n-k+1)). \n\nFor k=1: 3*(n-1+1)=3*n -> so 6 for n=2.\n\nSo for the even case, we should do:\n    for e in range(2, ...):\n        print(e, 3*n - (e-2))   ??? \n\nBut note: for k=1: e=2 -> then 3*n - (2-2)=3*n -> 6 for n=2 -> that works.\n\nBut what about k=2? for n=4: \n   k=1: e=2 -> swap (2, 3*4=12)\n   k=2: e=5 -> swap (5, 3*4 - (5-2)=12-3=9)\n\nBut the last character of the (n-k+1)-th BAN for k=2: n=4, k=2 -> 4-2+1=3 -> 3*3=9 -> matches.\n\nSo the formula: for a given e (which is the position of the A in the k-th BAN: e = 3*(k-1)+2), we want to swap with 3*(n - k + 1) = 3*n - 3*(k-1) = 3*n - (e - 2) because e-2 = 3*(k-1). \n\nSo: second index = 3*n - (e-2)\n\nBut note: 3*n - (e-2) = 3*n - e + 2.\n\nSo we can write: \n    print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\nLet me test for n=2, e=2: 3*2 - 2 + 2 = 6 -> correct.\n\nFor n=3, if we were to use the same formula for the even case? but n=3 is odd. However, the odd case in the code uses a different formula: e + (3*n)//2.\n\nBut wait, the odd case: \n    for e in [2,5] for n=3: \n        e=2: 3*3 - 2 + 2 = 9 -> but the code did 6 for the first swap.\n\nSo we have two different formulas? \n\nBut note the problem: the even case and odd case are handled separately. The odd case uses a different formula. \n\nHowever, the problem says: It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most 10^5 operations. And the note says for n=1 and n=2 we have specific operations.\n\nBut the example for n=1: swapped (1,2) -> which is not of the form above? because we are only starting e from 2. \n\nSo the even case: we are only looping for the A's that are at positions 2,5,8,... but note the first A is at 2. \n\nBut the example for n=1: we swapped (1,2) -> which is the first character (B) and the A. That is a different pattern.\n\nBut the problem says: for n=1 we have a separate branch.\n\nSo for the even case, we can do:\n    for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n        print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\nBut wait, the range: \n    The start is 2, step 3, and the end is int((3*n+1)/2)+1.\n\nFor n=2: \n    end = int((6+1)/2)+1 = int(7/2)+1 = 3+1 = 4? so range(2,4,3) -> [2] -> one iteration.\n\nFor n=4 (even): \n    end = int((12+1)/2)+1 = int(13/2)+1 = 6+1=7 -> so e in [2,5,8] but 8>=7? so only [2,5] -> two iterations? but we need n/2=2 operations.\n\nSo the range is correct.\n\nBut what about the indices: for n=4, e=2: swap (2, 3*4 - 2 + 2 = 12) -> (2,12)\n        e=5: swap (5, 12 - 5 + 2 = 9) -> (5,9)\n\nBut the last character of the first BAN from the end is 12 (for the 4th BAN) and for the second BAN from the end is 9 (for the 3rd BAN). And the A's: the first A at 2, the second A at 5. \n\nSo the code for the even case in the else block should be:\n        print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\nBut note: the problem says the indices are 1-indexed.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py in the else block is:\n        print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\nBut wait, the variable n is the given integer. \n\nSo to summarize:\n\nFor program1.py: \n    We add two lines in the elif block:\n        b += n[r]\n        r -= 1\n\nFor program2.py:\n    In the else block, we replace the TODO with:\n        print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\n\nBut note: the code for program2.py in the else block already has a for loop. We just need to complete the print statement.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the specified JSON format.\n\nImportant: We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the two lines for the elif block.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the print statement in the for loop of the else block.\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and we are replacing that with two lines. However, the existing code has the elif condition and the comment. We are to output only the two lines that complete the elif block.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the else block has a for loop and a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\". We are to output the print statement that goes there.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\",\n  \"program2\": \"            print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the original. In program1.py, the elif block is indented by 8 spaces (because the while loop is indented by 4, and the elif is inside the while). The two lines we add should be indented by 12 spaces? \n\nLooking at the existing code for program1.py:\n\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe if block has two lines, each indented by 8 more spaces (so 4+4=8). Similarly, the elif block should have two lines indented by 8 more spaces.\n\nBut the existing code has a comment in the elif block that is indented by 12? Actually, the original code might have mixed tabs and spaces, but we'll use 4 spaces per level.\n\nThe structure:\n\nwhile l<=r:\n    [4 spaces] if a<=b:\n    [8 spaces] a+=n[l]\n    [8 spaces] l+=1\n    [4 spaces] elif b<a:\n    [8 spaces] ...   (we are replacing the comment with two lines at 8 spaces)\n\nBut the comment is at 12? Actually, the original code has:\n\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the comment is at 8 spaces (because the elif is at 4 and the block is indented by 4 more). So we write the two lines at 8 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the for loop in the else block is:\n\n        for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the comment with a print statement at 12 spaces? But the existing code in the odd case has:\n\n        for e in range(2, int((3 * n + 1)/2) + 1, 3):\n            print(e,e + int((3*n)/2))\n\nSo the print is at 12 spaces? Actually, the for loop is at 8 (because the else: is at 4, then the for is at 8, and the body at 12). But the example in the code for the odd case has the print at 12.\n\nSo we write the print at 12 spaces.\n\nBut in the JSON string, we must represent the newlines and the exact indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\nFor program1: the two lines with 8 spaces at the beginning of each.\n\nBut note: the existing code in the elif block has 8 spaces for the comment? Actually, the comment is at 12? Let me count:\n\nThe code:\n\nfor n in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n    n=[*map(int,n.split())]\n    a,b,l,f=[0]*4;r=len(n)-1\n    while l<=r:\n        if a<=b:\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n        elif b<a:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThe while loop is at 4 spaces. The if and elif are at 8 (4 for the while block, then 4 for the if/elif). The body of the if is at 12 (two lines: a+=... and l+=1). The body of the elif is the comment at 12.\n\nSo we should write the two lines for the elif block at 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore:\n\n            b += n[r]\n            r -= 1\n\nEach line has 12 spaces? Actually, the existing code uses 4-space indentation. The while is 4, then the if/elif are 4 more (so 8), then the body of if/elif is 4 more (so 12). \n\nBut the existing code for the if block has:\n\n            a+=n[l]\n            l+=1\n\nSo we do the same for the elif.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the for loop body should be indented by 4 more than the for loop. The for loop is at 8 (because the else: is at 4, then the for is at 8). Then the body of the for is at 12.\n\nSo the print statement should be at 12.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is two lines, each starting with 12 spaces.\n\nBut note: the existing code in the if block has 12 spaces. So we do the same.\n\nIn the JSON, we represent:\n\n\"program1\": \"            b += n[r]\\n            r -= 1\"\n\n\"program2\": \"            print(e, 3*n - e + 2)\"\n\nBut note: in program2.py, the variable is `e`, and we have `3*n - e + 2`.\n\nLet me test for n=2: e=2 -> 3*2 - 2 + 2 = 6 -> correct.\n\nOne more: for n=4, e=5: 3*4 -5+2 = 12-5+2=9 -> correct.\n\nSo we output the JSON as specified."
