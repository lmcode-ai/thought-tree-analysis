So:\n        x_{n-2} = y_{n-1}\n\nNow, we have:\n   a_i = x_i - y_i   for every i. And the flow conditions:\n   For i=0: y_1 = x_0   => a_0 = x_0 - y_0. But note: we cannot have a left move from 0? So y_0 = 0. Therefore, a_0 = x_0. Then from the flow condition: y_1 = x_0 = a_0. For i=1: \n        x_0 + y_2 = x_1 + y_1   => a_0 + y_2 = x_1 + a_0   => y_2 = x_1. Then a_1 = x_1 - y_1 = x_1 - a_0. => x_1 = a_1 + a_0, and y_2 = a_1 + a_0. For i=2:\n        x_1 + y_3 = x_2 + y_2   => (a_0+a_1) + y_3 = x_2 + (a_0+a_1)   => y_3 = x_2. Then a_2 = x_2 - y_2 = x_2 - (a_0+a_1) => x_2 = a_2 + a_0 + a_1. We see a pattern: \n        Let s_i = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_i. Then for i, we have: \n            a_i = x_i - y_i\n            and the flow condition: x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i   => y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i - x_{i-1} But we also have from the previous step: y_i = x_{i-1}? Actually, from the flow condition at i-1: \n            x_{i-2} + y_i = x_{i-1} + y_{i-1}   => and we know from the pattern that y_i = s_{i-1}? Alternatively, we can derive:\n            We know: \n                a_0 = x_0\n                a_1 = x_1 - y_1 = x_1 - x_0   => x_1 = a_0 + a_1\n                a_2 = x_2 - y_2 = x_2 - x_1 => x_2 = a_0+a_1+a_2\n\n        So it seems: x_i = s_i = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_i. And then y_{i+1} = x_i? because from the flow condition at i: \n            x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i   => but we also have y_i = x_{i-1} (from the pattern) and then:\n            x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + x_{i-1}   => y_{i+1} = x_i. Therefore, the condition for the last element (i=n-1) is:\n            y_{n-1} = x_{n-2}   => which is s_{n-2} = s_{n-2} (so that holds). But also, we have a_{n-1} = x_{n-1} - y_{n-1} = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = a_{n-1}? => This is consistent.",

But we require that for i (which is not the last) s_i>=0. So if a[i] < 0, then we break? However, the code in the 'elif tot==0' block only checks if a[i]!=0? and then does something? Actually, if tot==0 and a[i] is negative, then the next cumulative sum s_i = a[i] <0 -> invalid. So we should break. But the code doesn't break in that block. It only breaks if tot<0. So we need to handle: In the block: \n                elif tot == 0:\n                    if a[i] ! = 0:\n                        # then we set tot = a[i]? but then we break if it becomes negative?

Then we break the loop immediately? and then print \"No\". This satisfies: because the cumulative at index0 is negative -> invalid. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the two lines:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        However, note: we must be cautious: if we break, we break the for loop and then print \"No\". If we set tot = a[i] and then continue, that's the intended behavior. So for program1.py, the completion is: \n            \"if a[i] < 0:\\n                break\\n            tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But note: the indentation.",

But the tot assignment is at the same level as the inner if? Therefore, the code for program1 is:\n\n            Line1: \"                    if a[i] < 0:\"\n            Line2: \"                        break\"\n            Line3: \"                    tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But wait, the tot assignment should be outside the inner if a[i]<0?

Then the tot assignment: we break out of the inner if, so we go back to 12 spaces? But the tot assignment should be done only if a[i]>=0? so it should be in the else of the inner if? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            else:\n                tot = a[i]\n\n        But that adds an extra line. Or we can do:\n\n            if a[i] < 0: break\n            tot = a[i] But that is not the style.

We replace the comment with:\n\n                        if a[i] < 0:\n                            break\n                        tot = a[i] So the code becomes:\n\n                        if a[i] < 0:\n                            break\n                        tot = a[i]\n\n        The first line: 12 spaces + \"if a[i] < 0:\" -> 12 spaces for the if, then 16 for the break, then 12 for the tot.

Therefore, we can do:\n\n            ans = n - m\n            if m < n:\n                ans += (n-1)//m\n\n          But the code has a while loop. We can break the loop by doing:\n\n            ans += (n-1)//m\n            break\n\n          But the while loop condition is while(m<n). We break after one iteration? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            clones = (n-1)//m\n            ans += clones\n            break\n\n          Then we break the loop. But the condition of the while loop: we break after the first iteration? Therefore, the TODO block is:\n\n            clones = (n-1) // m\n            ans += clones\n            break\n\n          But note: the while loop runs only once?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are processing t test cases. For each test case, we have an array `a` of size n.\nWe are to determine if we can obtain the array `a` with the operations described and end with the pointer at the first element.\n\nThe provided code sets `tot = a[0]` and then iterates from index 1 to n-1.\nThe idea is to simulate the constraints:\n\nObservations:\n1. The operations are:\n   a. Move forward: add 1 to current and move to next (only if not last)\n   b. Move backward: subtract 1 from current and move to previous (only if not first)\n\n2. The pointer must end at the first element.\n\nWe can think of the process as:\n- We start at index0 with 0, and we must end at index0.\n- The operations are similar to walking left and right. Each time we move right we add one to the current, and when we move left we subtract one.\n\nHowever, note that the problem is asking: given the array `a`, can we achieve it?\n\nKey constraints from the problem:\n- The entire process must end at the first element.\n\nWe can model the journey as a sequence of moves. Let:\n- Let `x_i` be the number of times we move from i to i+1 (right move from i)\n- Let `y_i` be the number of times we move from i+1 to i (left move from i+1)\n\nThen, the net effect at position i (for i from 0 to n-1) is:\n- For i=0: \n    We start at 0. \n    We can only leave to the right (x0 times) and come back from the right (y1 times? but note: we can only come from the next element, which is index1) so actually:\n    a0 = x0 - y1   [because every time we leave 0 to right we add 1 (so x0) and every time we come back from 1 we subtract 1 (so y1) but note: when we come back from 1 we are at 0 and we subtract 1? Actually, the operation for moving left: at the current element (which is 1) we subtract 1 and then move to 0. So the effect on 1 is that we subtract 1 when leaving to the left? And the effect on 0 is that we add 1 when arriving from the right? Actually, no: the operation is: if the pointer is not on the first element, decrease the element the pointer is currently on by 1 and then move to the previous. So when we are at index1 and we do a left move, we subtract 1 from index1 and then move to index0. Therefore, the value at index0 is only increased by the right moves that start at index0 (each right move from index0 adds 1 to index0 and then moves to index1) and is not directly affected by the left moves that come to index0 (because the subtraction happens at the element we are leaving, not the one we are arriving at).\n\nSo actually, the value at index0 is only the number of times we left index0 to the right (each time we leave we add 1) minus the number of times we left index0 to the left? But we cannot leave index0 to the left because we are at the first element. So actually, the value at index0 is the number of times we left index0 to the right (x0). However, note that we might come back to index0? How does that affect?\n\nWait, let's break down:\n\nAt index0:\n- We start at 0.\n- We can only do a right move: which adds 1 to index0 and moves to index1. So each right move from 0 adds 1 to index0 and moves to 1.\n- Then, if we are at index1 and we do a left move: we subtract 1 from index1 and move to index0. This does not change index0.\n\nTherefore, the value at index0 is exactly the number of times we left index0 to the right (x0).\n\nBut note: we might leave index0 multiple times? Actually, we can come back to index0 and then leave again. So the total value at index0 is the net number of times we started a right move from index0.\n\nSimilarly, for index1:\n- We arrive at index1 by a right move from index0 (which doesn't change index1) and then we can leave to the right (which adds 1 to index1 and moves to index2) or leave to the left (which subtracts 1 from index1 and moves to index0). Also, we can arrive from the left (from index2? no, from index0? only by a right move from index0) and then leave to the left (which subtracts 1) or to the right (which adds 1). But note: the moves that start at index1: \n   - Right moves: each adds 1 to index1 and moves to index2.\n   - Left moves: each subtracts 1 from index1 and moves to index0.\n\nAlso, the net number of times we are at index1 is the number of times we arrived from index0 (which is x0) minus the number of times we left to the left (y1) and also minus the number of times we left to the right (x1) because we leave from index1? Actually, the net flow must be zero? Because we start and end at index0.\n\nWait, we must end at index0. So the entire journey must have the same number of moves from 0 to 1 as from 1 to 0? Actually, the entire path must be a walk that starts and ends at 0.\n\nTherefore, the net number of times we leave 0 to the right (x0) must equal the number of times we come back from 1 to 0 (y1). Similarly, for index1: the net number of times we leave index1 to the right (x1) must equal the number of times we come back from index2 to index1 (y2). And so on.\n\nBut note: we never come back to the last element? Actually, we cannot leave the last element to the right. So for the last element, we can only leave to the left? But we don't want to because we must end at the first. So the last element must be left only by left moves? Actually, we must eventually leave the last element? But we must end at the first. So we must leave the last element by a left move? But then we come to the second last.\n\nTherefore, the value at index i (for i from 0 to n-1) is:\na0 = x0 - y1   ??? \n\nWait, let me reexamine the operations:\n\nOperation 1: (if not last) \n   current element (say at i) is increased by 1 -> then move to i+1.\n   So: a_i becomes a_i + 1, and then we are at i+1.\n\nOperation 2: (if not first)\n   current element (at i) is decreased by 1 -> then move to i-1.\n\nSo the value at i is:\n   a_i = (# of times we did operation1 at i) - (# of times we did operation2 at i)\n\nBut note: we can also pass through i multiple times.\n\nHowever, the net effect is that:\n   a_i = (number of times we started a right move from i) - (number of times we started a left move from i)\n\nBut also, we must have the condition that the entire journey starts and ends at 0, and the moves must be consistent.\n\nMoreover, we can model the entire journey as a sequence of moves and define:\n   Let x_i = number of right moves from i (so from i to i+1)\n   Let y_i = number of left moves from i (so from i to i-1) [but note: we cannot have left moves from 0]\n\nThen the value at i is: a_i = x_i - y_i.\n\nBut also, the net flow at each position (except the boundaries) must be zero? Actually, the number of times we enter i must equal the number of times we leave i.\n\nHow do we enter i?\n   - From the left: by a right move from i-1 (x_{i-1})\n   - From the right: by a left move from i+1 (y_{i+1})\n\nHow do we leave i?\n   - To the right: x_i\n   - To the left: y_i\n\nBut note: we start at 0 and end at 0. So for i=0:\n   We start at 0 (so we have an initial presence at 0) and we end at 0 (so we have a final presence at 0). Therefore, the net flow at 0 is: \n        (initial) + (arrivals) = (departures) + (final)\n        => 1 + (y_1) = (x_0) + 1   => so y_1 = x_0.\n\nFor i>=1 and i<=n-2:\n        (arrivals) = (departures)\n        => x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i\n\nFor i = n-1 (last element):\n        We start at 0, so we don't start at n-1. And we end at 0, so we don't end at n-1. Therefore:\n        x_{n-2} = y_{n-1}   [because we can only arrive from the left and leave to the left?]\n\nBut note: we cannot leave the last element to the right? So x_{n-1} = 0? And we cannot have a left move from the last element? Actually we can: the operation says if not on the first element (so last element is not first? unless n=1) then we can do a left move. So for n>=2, the last element can do left moves.\n\nSo for i = n-1:\n        arrivals: x_{n-2} (from the left) \n        departures: y_{n-1} (to the left) \n        and we don't have any initial or final presence? So:\n        x_{n-2} = y_{n-1}\n\nNow, we have:\n   a_i = x_i - y_i   for every i.\n\nAnd the flow conditions:\n   For i=0: y_1 = x_0   => a_0 = x_0 - y_0. But note: we cannot have a left move from 0? So y_0 = 0. Therefore, a_0 = x_0.\n        Then from the flow condition: y_1 = x_0 = a_0.\n\n   For i=1: \n        x_0 + y_2 = x_1 + y_1   => a_0 + y_2 = x_1 + a_0   => y_2 = x_1.\n        Then a_1 = x_1 - y_1 = x_1 - a_0.\n\n        => x_1 = a_1 + a_0, and y_2 = a_1 + a_0.\n\n   For i=2:\n        x_1 + y_3 = x_2 + y_2   => (a_0+a_1) + y_3 = x_2 + (a_0+a_1)   => y_3 = x_2.\n        Then a_2 = x_2 - y_2 = x_2 - (a_0+a_1)   => x_2 = a_2 + a_0 + a_1.\n\n   We see a pattern: \n        Let s_i = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_i.\n        Then for i, we have: \n            a_i = x_i - y_i\n            and the flow condition: x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i   => y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i - x_{i-1}\n\n        But we also have from the previous step: y_i = x_{i-1}? Actually, from the flow condition at i-1: \n            x_{i-2} + y_i = x_{i-1} + y_{i-1}   => and we know from the pattern that y_i = s_{i-1}? \n\n        Alternatively, we can derive:\n            We know: \n                a_0 = x_0\n                a_1 = x_1 - y_1 = x_1 - x_0   => x_1 = a_0 + a_1\n                a_2 = x_2 - y_2 = x_2 - x_1   => x_2 = a_0+a_1+a_2\n\n        So it seems: x_i = s_i = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_i.\n\n        And then y_{i+1} = x_i? because from the flow condition at i: \n            x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + y_i   => but we also have y_i = x_{i-1} (from the pattern) and then:\n            x_{i-1} + y_{i+1} = x_i + x_{i-1}   => y_{i+1} = x_i.\n\n        Therefore, the condition for the last element (i=n-1) is:\n            y_{n-1} = x_{n-2}   => which is s_{n-2} = s_{n-2} (so that holds).\n\n        But also, we have a_{n-1} = x_{n-1} - y_{n-1} = x_{n-1} - x_{n-2} = a_{n-1}? \n            => This is consistent.\n\n        However, note that we cannot have a left move from the first element? and we cannot have a right move from the last? \n        So we must have:\n            y_0 = 0 and x_{n-1} = 0? \n\n        But from the equation: \n            a_{n-1} = x_{n-1} - y_{n-1} \n            and we have x_{n-1} = s_{n-1}? \n\n        But wait, we defined x_i = s_i for i from 0 to n-1? \n        Then a_{n-1} = s_{n-1} - s_{n-2} = a_{n-1} -> holds.\n\n        However, the constraint that we cannot have a right move from the last element forces x_{n-1} = 0? \n        But we have x_{n-1} = s_{n-1}. Therefore, we must have s_{n-1} = 0.\n\n        Also, we must have the flow condition at the last element: \n            x_{n-2} = y_{n-1}   -> which we have because y_{n-1} = x_{n-2} (from the pattern) and that holds.\n\n        But also, we must have the journey end at 0. The condition we derived for the entire array is that the cumulative sums must be nonnegative? and the total cumulative sum at the end must be zero? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n          s_0 = a0 = x0 >=0? \n          s_1 = a0+a1 = x1 >=0?\n          ... \n          s_{n-1} = 0.\n\n        Why nonnegative? Because x_i (the number of right moves from i) must be nonnegative. Similarly, y_i (the number of left moves from i) must be nonnegative? and we have y_i = x_{i-1} (for i>=1) which is nonnegative if the previous x's are.\n\n        Therefore, the necessary conditions are:\n          Condition 1: s_{n-1} = 0.\n          Condition 2: For every i from 0 to n-2, s_i >= 0.\n          Condition 3: Also, note that we cannot have a left move from the first element, so we must have y_0=0. But we have a0 = x0 - y0 = x0, so that's consistent.\n\n        However, what about the last element? We have a_{n-1} = s_{n-1} - s_{n-2} = -s_{n-2}? But wait, we have s_{n-1}=0, so a_{n-1} = -s_{n-2}. But that doesn't have to be negative? \n\n        Actually, from the equation: \n            a_{n-1} = x_{n-1} - y_{n-1} = 0 - s_{n-2} = -s_{n-2}   -> so a_{n-1} must be negative? \n\n        But that is not necessarily the case. Let me check the derivation for the last element:\n\n        We have: \n            x_{n-1} = s_{n-1} = 0? \n            and y_{n-1} = x_{n-2} = s_{n-2}? \n            so a_{n-1} = 0 - s_{n-2} = -s_{n-2}.\n\n        Therefore, the last element must be the negative of the cumulative sum at the second last? \n\n        But wait, the cumulative sum at the last element is s_{n-1} = s_{n-2} + a_{n-1} = 0 -> so a_{n-1} = -s_{n-2}. \n\n        So condition 2: for i from 0 to n-2, s_i>=0, and condition 1: s_{n-1}=0, and condition 3: a_{n-1} = -s_{n-2}? \n\n        Actually, condition 1 and the definition of s_{n-1} = s_{n-2} + a_{n-1} = 0 implies a_{n-1} = -s_{n-2}. So condition 3 is automatically satisfied if condition 1 holds? \n\n        Therefore, the conditions are:\n          s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n-2} must be >=0, and s_{n-1} must be 0.\n\n        But note: what if n=1? \n          Then we have only a0. \n          Conditions: \n            s0 = a0 must be 0? because s_{n-1}=s0=0? \n          But also, we start at 0 and we cannot do any right move (because then we would leave the only element and then we must come back? but we cannot come back from an element that doesn't exist). So we can only do nothing? then a0=0.\n\n        Therefore, for n=1: \n          We must have a0=0.\n\n        Now, let's test with the example in the note:\n\n        Example 1: \n          Input: [0,0,0,0] -> n=4\n          s0 = 0 -> nonnegative\n          s1 = 0+0=0 -> nonnegative\n          s2 = 0 -> nonnegative\n          s3 = 0 -> 0 -> condition holds -> \"Yes\"\n\n        Example 2: \n          The example in the note: [2, -1, -1, 0] \n          s0 = 2 -> nonnegative\n          s1 = 2 + (-1) = 1 -> nonnegative\n          s2 = 1 + (-1) = 0 -> nonnegative\n          s3 = 0+0=0 -> condition holds -> \"Yes\"\n\n        But the note says: \n          \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\"\n\n        Wait, the problem says: \"after we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element\". So the example [0,0,0,0] must be obtained and the pointer must end at the first element? \n\n        The example says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> meaning that the example [0,0,0,0] cannot be obtained? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"But there is one additional rule. After we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element.\"\n\n        So the example [0,0,0,0] must be obtained with the pointer at the first element? \n\n        How? \n          We start at index0: [0,0,0,0] -> we do nothing? then we are at index0. So it is possible.\n\n        But the note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> that seems contradictory.\n\n        Actually, the note has two test cases: \n          The first test case: n=1, a=[0] -> then we must have the pointer at the first element? and we can do nothing -> so it is possible.\n\n          The second test case: n=4, a=[2,-1,-1,0] -> the example shows how to get it and end at the first element.\n\n        The note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> that must be a different first test case? \n\n        The problem says: \"The first line contains a single integer t\" and then the test cases.\n\n        The sample input is not provided in the note. But the note says: \n          \"One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown below.\"\n\n        So the first test case in the sample input might be the one with n=1 and a=[0]? and the second test case is the one with n=4 and a=[2,-1,-1,0]? \n\n        But then the note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> that would be for the first test case? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"Determine whether it's possible to obtain a after some operations or not\" with the condition that the pointer is at the first element.\n\n        So the first test case (n=1, a=[0]) is possible? \n\n        The note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> that suggests that the first test case is not possible? \n\n        But wait, the note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> meaning that we can get the array [0] but the pointer would not be at the first element? \n\n        How? \n          We start at the first element (which is the only element) and we do nothing: then we have the array [0] and the pointer is at the first element. \n\n        So the note must be referring to a different test case? \n\n        Actually, the problem statement says: \n          \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1<=n<=200000) \u2014 the size of array a. The second line of each test case contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n        And the note says: \n          \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\"\n\n        This implies that the first test case in the sample input is not n=1? \n\n        The sample input is not provided. But the problem says: \n          \"But there is one additional rule. After we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element.\"\n\n        So even if we can get the array, if the pointer is not at the first element, then we don't accept.\n\n        Therefore, the conditions we derived (s_i>=0 for i=0..n-2 and s_{n-1}=0) are necessary and sufficient? \n\n        However, the note says: \n          \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\"\n\n        So the first test case must be one that fails? \n\n        Let me check with the example: \n          The note says: \n            \"One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown below.\"\n\n          So the second test case is [2,-1,-1,0] -> which we saw satisfies the conditions.\n\n        What is the first test case? \n          The problem says: \"The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=1000)\".\n\n          The sample input might be:\n            t=2\n            n=1\n            [0]\n            n=4\n            [2,-1,-1,0]\n\n          But then the first test case (n=1, [0]) satisfies: \n            s0 = 0 -> and n-1=0, so we require s0=0 -> yes.\n\n          So the note must be referring to a different first test case? \n\n        Actually, the note says: \n          \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\"\n\n        This implies that the array can be obtained by the operations, but the pointer is not at the first element at the end. Therefore, we must output \"No\" for that test case? \n\n        So the problem is: we require the pointer to be at the first element at the end. \n\n        Therefore, the conditions we derived (s_i>=0 for i=0..n-2 and s_{n-1}=0) are exactly the conditions that ensure the journey ends at the first element? \n\n        So the first test case in the note must be one that does not satisfy s_{n-1}=0? \n\n        Let me assume the first test case in the sample input is: \n          n=2, a=[0,0]\n\n        Then:\n          s0 = 0 (>=0) -> ok\n          s1 = 0+0=0 -> condition holds -> \"Yes\"\n\n        But the note says: \"we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element\". \n\n        How can we get [0,0] without ending at the first element? \n          We start at index0: [0,0]. \n          We do a right move: \n             index0 becomes 1, then move to index1 -> [1,0] and pointer at index1.\n          Then we do a left move from index1: \n             index1 becomes -1, then move to index0 -> [1,-1] -> not [0,0].\n\n        Alternatively, we do nothing: then we have [0,0] and pointer at index0 -> that's valid.\n\n        So the note must be referring to a different test case? \n\n        After re-reading the note: \n          \"Note: In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element. One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown below.\"\n\n        The first test case might be: \n          n=1, a=[1] \n          Then: \n            s0 = 1 -> but we require s0=0? -> fails -> so we output \"No\".\n\n        But the note says: \"we can obtain the array after some operations\" -> meaning we can get [1]? \n          How? \n            Start at index0: [0]\n            We do a right move? but n=1 -> we cannot do a right move (because we are at the last element). \n            We cannot do a left move because we are at the first. \n            So we cannot change the array? \n\n          Therefore, we cannot get [1]? \n\n        So the note must be referring to a test case that we can get the array but without the pointer at the first? \n\n        The problem says: \"Determine whether it's possible to obtain a after some operations or not\" with the condition that the pointer is at the first element.\n\n        Therefore, even if we can get the array without the pointer at the first, we don't accept.\n\n        So the conditions we have are correct.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm for program1.py:\n\n          For a test case:\n            n = int(input())\n            a = list of n integers\n\n            Let s = 0\n            If n==0: then ... but n>=1.\n\n            Conditions:\n              Condition 1: The cumulative sum at the last element must be 0: \n                  total = sum(a) -> but note: we only need the cumulative at the last index? \n                  Actually, we need the cumulative at each step.\n\n            Steps:\n              We traverse from i=0 to n-1:\n                s += a[i]\n                If i == n-1: \n                    we require s==0\n                Else: \n                    we require s>=0\n\n            But note: if at any step i (before n-1) we get s<0, then we break and output \"No\".\n\n            Also, if we get to the last element and s !=0, then we output \"No\".\n\n            However, what if we break in the middle? The provided code has:\n\n                tot = a[0]\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if tot < 0:\n                        break\n                    elif tot == 0:\n                        if a[i] != 0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n                    else:\n                        tot += a[i]\n                else:\n                    if tot == 0:\n                        print(\"Yes\")\n                        continue\n\n                print(\"No\")\n\n            This code already sets tot = a[0] (which is s0). Then for i from 1 to n-1, it updates.\n\n            In the case when tot==0, it checks if a[i]!=0. Why?\n\n            Let me think: \n              If at step i-1, the cumulative sum s_{i-1}=0, then the next cumulative sum s_i = a[i]. \n              But we require that for i (which is not the last) s_i>=0. So if a[i] < 0, then we break? \n\n            However, the code in the 'elif tot==0' block only checks if a[i]!=0? and then does something? \n\n            Actually, if tot==0 and a[i] is negative, then the next cumulative sum s_i = a[i] <0 -> invalid. So we should break.\n\n            But the code doesn't break in that block. It only breaks if tot<0. \n\n            So we need to handle: \n              In the block: \n                elif tot == 0:\n                    if a[i] != 0:\n                        # then we set tot = a[i]? but then we break if it becomes negative? \n                    But wait, if a[i] is negative, then we set tot = a[i] and then in the next iteration we break because tot<0? \n\n            However, the code does not update tot in that block. \n\n            The provided code does not update tot in the 'elif tot==0' block. It only updates in the 'else' block (when tot>0). \n\n            So we must update tot in the 'elif tot==0' block? \n\n            Actually, the cumulative sum at step i is tot (which is the cumulative up to i-1) plus a[i]. \n\n            So in the block where tot==0, we are at index i (from 1 to n-1). Then the cumulative sum for index i is 0 + a[i] = a[i]. \n\n            Then we should set tot = a[i]. \n\n            But note: if a[i] is negative, then we break in the next iteration? but we are at index i and we have a negative cumulative? which is invalid. So we should break immediately? \n\n            However, the condition of the for loop: we check at the beginning of the loop iteration (for index i) the current tot (which is the cumulative up to i-1). \n\n            Then we update tot for the current index i? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                elif tot == 0:\n                    if a[i] < 0:   # because then the cumulative at i becomes a[i] which is negative -> invalid\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        tot = a[i]   # then we set tot to a[i] and then we continue? \n\n            But note: if a[i] is positive, then we set tot = a[i] and then in the next iteration we will be in the 'else' branch and add the next a[i+1]? \n\n            However, what if a[i] is 0? then we leave tot=0? and then the next iteration we are again in the 'elif tot==0' block? \n\n            But the condition: if a[i]!=0 -> then we break? that doesn't make sense. \n\n            Actually, the note says: \n                if a[i]!=0: \n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            But we must break if a[i] is negative? and if a[i] is positive we set tot to a[i]? and if a[i] is zero we leave tot=0? \n\n            However, the problem: if we have tot=0 and then a[i]=0, then the cumulative at i is 0 -> which is allowed (nonnegative) and we continue.\n\n            So the TODO block should be:\n\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    tot = a[i]   # because we are now at index i, the cumulative is a[i] (since the previous cumulative was 0)\n\n            But wait, what if we have multiple zeros? \n                Example: [0,0,1] -> \n                  i=1: tot=0, then we see a[1]=0 -> we don't break? and we leave tot=0? \n                  Then i=2: tot=0, then we see a[2]=1 -> we set tot=1? \n                Then we break out of the loop? and then we go to the else clause? and then check tot==0? -> no, tot=1 -> so we print \"No\". \n\n            But wait, the cumulative at the last element must be 0? \n                s0 = 0\n                s1 = 0\n                s2 = 1 -> not 0 -> so it should be \"No\". \n\n            So the code is correct: we break out of the for loop and then print \"No\". \n\n            However, the code has an else clause for the for loop: \n                else: \n                    if tot==0:\n                        print(\"Yes\")\n                        continue\n\n            So if we complete the for loop without breaking, then we check if tot==0? \n\n            But note: in the last iteration, we update tot for the last element? \n\n            How? \n              The for loop runs for i from 1 to n-1 (so the last index we process is i=n-1). \n              Then we set tot = ... for the last element? \n\n            Actually, the code in the 'else' branch (for tot>0) does: tot += a[i] for i from 1 to n-1. \n            And in the 'elif tot==0' branch we set tot = a[i] for the current i (if a[i]>=0). \n\n            Therefore, at the end of the for loop, tot is the cumulative sum at the last element? \n\n            So we require tot==0.\n\n            Therefore, the code structure is:\n\n                tot = a[0]   # which is the cumulative at index0\n                if n==1:\n                    then we skip the loop and then check if tot==0 -> then \"Yes\", else \"No\"\n\n                But the for loop runs from 1 to n-1. \n\n            For n=1: \n                the for loop does not run -> then we go to the else clause of the for loop? \n                The else clause of a for loop runs if we did not break. \n                Then we check: if tot==0 -> then \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\n            So for n=1: we require a0==0.\n\n            Now, what if we have a0 negative? \n                tot = a0 (negative) -> then we break the for loop at the first check? because we check at the beginning of the loop: if tot<0 -> break. \n                But note: the for loop runs for i in range(1, n). If n>1, then we break. \n                But if n==1, we don't enter the loop -> then we check tot==0? -> no -> \"No\".\n\n            So the code for program1.py:\n\n                We need to complete the block:\n\n                    elif tot == 0:\n                        if a[i] != 0:\n                            # We break if a[i] is negative? and if positive we set tot? \n                            # Actually, if a[i] is negative, we break. If positive, we set tot to a[i]. If zero, we leave tot=0? \n                            # But the condition says \"if a[i]!=0\", so we only do something when a[i]!=0? \n                            # We can do:\n                            if a[i] < 0:\n                                break\n                            else:\n                                tot = a[i]   # because if a[i] is positive, we set tot to a[i] and then we will be in the positive branch next time?\n                        # else: if a[i]==0, we do nothing? and then the next iteration we are still in the tot==0 branch? \n\n            However, if we do nothing when a[i]==0, then tot remains 0. That is correct.\n\n            But the problem: if we have a[i] positive, we set tot = a[i]. Then in the next iteration, we are in the 'else' branch (tot>0) and we do tot += a[i+1]. \n\n            That is correct.\n\n            But note: what if a[i] is negative? we break -> then we print \"No\".\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                tot = a[i]\n\n            However, note: if we break, we don't set tot? and then we break the loop and print \"No\". \n\n            But if we don't break, we set tot = a[i] and then we continue.\n\n            But what if a[i] is positive? we set tot = a[i] and then we break the current iteration and go to the next? \n\n            Actually, we break out of the current block and then the next iteration? \n\n            So we can write:\n\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                tot = a[i]\n\n            But note: we must not break the loop if a[i] is positive? we only break if negative. \n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    tot = a[i]\n\n            But the problem: if a[i] is positive, we set tot and then the loop continues? \n\n            However, we must not break the loop for positive? \n\n            So:\n\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                tot = a[i]\n\n            This will break the loop only when a[i] is negative. For positive, we set tot and then the loop continues.\n\n            But what if a[i] is zero? we skip the block? because the condition is \"if a[i]!=0\". \n\n            So we only do the above when a[i]!=0. \n\n            Therefore, the code for the block is:\n\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                tot = a[i]\n\n            However, if a[i] is positive, we set tot = a[i] and then we break out of the current if-elif-else? and then the next iteration we check the updated tot? \n\n            That is correct.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a long sequence of zeros? \n            Example: [0,0,0,0] -> \n                tot = 0\n                i=1: a[1]=0 -> skip the block (because a[i]==0) -> then we go to the next iteration with tot=0.\n                i=2: a[2]=0 -> skip -> tot=0.\n                i=3: a[3]=0 -> skip -> then the loop ends. Then we check: tot==0 -> \"Yes\".\n\n        And [0,0,0,1] -> \n            i=3: a[3]=1 -> then we set tot=1 -> then the loop ends? and then we check tot==0? -> no -> \"No\". \n            But the cumulative at the last element is 0+0+0+1=1 -> not zero -> so \"No\" is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        But note: we are in the block for \"elif tot==0\" and \"if a[i]!=0\", so we can write:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        However, what if a[i] is positive? we set tot = a[i] and then we break the current if-elif-else? and then the next iteration we are in the 'else' branch? \n\n        Actually, the next iteration we start by checking the new tot. If tot>0, we go to the else branch and then do tot += a[i] for the next element? \n\n        But wait, we are at index i, and we set tot = a[i] (which is positive) and then the next iteration we are at index i+1: \n            Then we check: tot>0 -> so we do tot += a[i+1]? \n\n        That is correct: the cumulative at index i is a[i] (which is positive) and then we add a[i+1] to get the cumulative at index i+1.\n\n        Therefore, the code is:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int,input().split()))\n                tot = a[0]\n                # If the first element is negative? then we break in the loop? but the loop starts at index1. \n                # But note: if n==1, we skip the loop and then check tot==0? \n                # But if n>=2 and a0<0, then we break at the first check in the loop? \n                # Actually, the loop starts at i=1: \n                #   if tot<0 -> break -> then we print \"No\"\n                # So if a0<0, then tot<0 -> we break the loop and print \"No\". \n                # That is correct because the cumulative at index0 must be nonnegative? and if it's negative we break.\n\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if tot < 0:\n                        break\n                    elif tot == 0:\n                        if a[i] != 0:\n                            if a[i] < 0:\n                                break\n                            tot = a[i]   # only if a[i] !=0 and a[i]>=0, we set tot to a[i]\n                        # else: if a[i]==0, we do nothing -> tot remains 0.\n                    else:\n                        tot += a[i]\n                else:\n                    if tot == 0:\n                        print(\"Yes\")\n                        continue\n\n                print(\"No\")\n\n        But what if a0 is negative? \n            Then we break the loop immediately? and then print \"No\". \n\n        This satisfies: because the cumulative at index0 is negative -> invalid.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the two lines:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        However, note: we must be cautious: if we break, we break the for loop and then print \"No\". \n        If we set tot = a[i] and then continue, that's the intended behavior.\n\n        So for program1.py, the completion is: \n            \"if a[i] < 0:\\n                break\\n            tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But note: the indentation. The current code has 8 spaces for the block inside the for loop, and then 12 spaces for the elif block. Then 16 spaces for the if block inside.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        But the existing code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" at the same indentation as the if a[i]!=0.\n\n        So we replace the TODO with:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        But note: the existing code has:\n\n            if a[i] != 0:\n\n        So we are inside that if. \n\n        Therefore, the code becomes:\n\n            elif tot == 0:\n                if a[i] != 0:\n                    if a[i] < 0:\n                        break\n                    tot = a[i]\n\n        This is the completion for program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n    We are given: \n        from collections import Counter\n\n        for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n            n=len(li:=li.split());\n            m = max(Counter(li).values())\n            ans =n-m\n            while(m<n):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            print(ans)\n\n    The problem: \n        We have an array. We can do:\n          Operation1: clone any array (cost 1)\n          Operation2: swap two elements from any two copies (cost 1 per swap? but note: one swap operation swaps two elements, so one operation)\n\n        We want the minimal number of operations to get at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\n    The idea:\n\n        We can do:\n          Step 1: clone the array k times. Then we have k+1 copies.\n          Step 2: swap elements between copies to bring all occurrences of a particular value to one copy.\n\n        How many swaps? \n          We want one copy to have all elements equal to x. \n          How many elements in that copy are already x? \n          Initially, in the original array, we have frequency f(x) for x.\n\n          Then, in the k+1 copies, we have (k+1)*f(x) occurrences of x. \n          We want to put n copies of x in one array. \n\n          How many x's are missing in that array? n - f(x) (if we choose the original array) but we can choose any array to be the target.\n\n          Actually, we can choose any copy to be the target. The target copy must have n x's.\n\n          How do we get the x's? \n            We can take x's from other copies. \n\n          How many x's are available? (k+1)*f(x) in total. \n          We need n x's in the target. So we require (k+1)*f(x) >= n.\n\n          The number of x's that we need to bring into the target is: n - f(x) (if we choose the original as the target) but note: we can choose any copy as the target. Actually, we can choose the copy that already has the most x's? \n\n          Actually, we can design the swaps arbitrarily. The minimal k must satisfy: (k+1)*f(x) >= n.\n\n          But we can choose x to be the element with the maximum frequency m. Then we require (k+1)*m >= n.\n\n          Then k >= ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n          But note: we can do swaps? \n\n          How many operations? \n            We do k cloning operations (each cloning is one operation) and then we do some swaps.\n\n          How many swaps? \n            We need to gather n x's in the target copy. The target copy initially has at most m x's? but note: we have k+1 copies, and the total number of x's is (k+1)*m? no, the total number of x's is the same as the original: m? \n\n          Actually, we start with one copy: which has m x's. Then we clone: now we have two copies, each with m x's? no, cloning duplicates the entire array. So each copy has the same array. Therefore, the total number of x's is (k+1)*m? \n\n          But we cannot create new elements, we can only swap. \n\n          Therefore, the total number of x's is m (the frequency in the original array) multiplied by the number of copies? no: when we clone, we duplicate the entire array. So if the original array has m x's, then after k clones we have k+1 copies, each with m x's? so total x's = (k+1)*m.\n\n          Now, we want to form one copy that has n x's. We can take x's from other copies. The maximum we can put in the target copy is the entire set of x's? but we need n x's. So we require (k+1)*m >= n.\n\n          How many swaps? \n            We need to move x's from other copies to the target. Each swap moves one x from a non-target copy to the target copy? and at the same time, we move a non-x from the target copy to the non-target copy.\n\n          How many x's are already in the target? at least m (if we choose the original as the target) but we can choose the copy that initially has the most x's? actually, all copies are identical. \n\n          So the target copy initially has m x's. We need n - m more x's. \n\n          And each swap can bring one x from another copy to the target? \n\n          Therefore, the number of swaps is n - m.\n\n          But note: we can also swap within the same copy? but that doesn't help because we are moving an x from one position to another in the same copy? we don't get an extra x.\n\n          So we must get the x's from other copies. \n\n          Therefore, the total operations = k (clones) + (n-m) (swaps).\n\n          And we must choose k such that (k+1)*m >= n.\n\n          We want to minimize k + (n-m).\n\n          We have: k >= ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n          Then total operations = ceil(n/m)-1 + (n-m) ?\n\n          But note: we can choose k minimally: k0 = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n          Then total operations = k0 + (n-m) = ceil(n/m) - 1 + n - m.\n\n          However, the example: \n            First test case: n=3, a=[1,1,1] -> m=3, then k0 = ceil(3/3)-1 = 1-1=0, then operations = 0 + (3-3)=0 -> correct.\n\n          Second test case: n=6, a=[0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 (for 0? but note: 0 appears twice, 3 appears twice -> m=2). \n            Then k0 = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2, then operations = 2 + (6-2)=6.\n\n          The note says the answer is 6.\n\n          But wait, the note says: \n            \"In the second test case it is possible to create a copy of the given array. After that there will be two identical arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] \n             After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array: \n                 [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] \n             Now let's create a copy of the first array: \n                 [0,0,0,3,7,0], [0,0,0,3,7,0], [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n             Let's swap elements in the first two copies: \n                 [0,0,0,0,0,0], [3,7,0,3,7,0], [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n             Finally, we made a copy where all elements are equal and made 6 operations.\"\n\n          The operations: \n            1 clone -> 1 operation (now 2 copies)\n            then 4 swaps? (to get the first copy to have 5 zeros? but then they did one more clone and then two swaps) -> total operations: 1 (clone) + 4 (swaps) + 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 8? \n\n          But the note says 6 operations.\n\n          Actually, the note says: \n            \"After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array\" -> that step: they did 2 swaps? (because they moved two zeros from the second copy to the first? and moved two non-zeros from the first to the second) -> 2 swaps? \n            Then they cloned the first array: 1 operation -> then swapped two more times: 2 swaps -> total: 1 (initial clone) + 2 (swaps) + 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 6.\n\n          How does that relate to our formula? \n            n=6, m=2 -> k0 = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2, then operations = 2 + (6-2)=6.\n\n          So the formula is: \n            ans = ceil(n/m) - 1 + (n - m)\n\n          But note: we can also choose a different element? but we choose the one with the maximum frequency m. \n\n          Therefore, the minimal number of operations is: ceil(n/m) - 1 + (n-m)\n\n          However, the provided code:\n\n            m = max(Counter(li).values())\n            ans = n - m\n            while(m<n):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            print(ans)\n\n          We are to complete the while loop.\n\n          The while loop condition: while m < n.\n\n          We know: \n            We need to do k = ceil(n/m) - 1 cloning operations, and then n-m swaps? \n            So total operations = k + (n-m) = ceil(n/m)-1 + (n-m)\n\n          How to compute that in the loop? \n\n          The idea: \n            We start with one copy. \n            We can do a clone: then we have two copies, and then we can swap. \n\n            But note: after each clone, the total number of available x's (for the element with frequency m) increases by m (because the new copy has m x's). \n\n            We need at least n x's in total to form one copy with n x's.\n\n            Initially, total x's = m.\n            After k clones, total x's = m * (k+1).\n\n            We require m*(k+1) >= n.\n\n            The minimal k is: k_min = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n            Then total operations = k_min + (n-m)   [because we do k_min clones and n-m swaps]\n\n          But note: the swaps: we need to move n-m x's from other copies to the target? \n\n          However, we can also use multiple clones to get more x's? \n\n          Therefore, the answer is: \n            ans = (ceil(n/m)-1) + (n-m)\n\n          But we can compute k_min without a loop? \n\n          Alternatively, we can simulate the cloning operations? \n\n          The provided code initializes ans = n-m (which is the number of swaps) and then in the while loop, which runs while m<n, we do something to update.\n\n          What is the while loop doing? \n\n          The note: \n            \"while(m<n):\"\n\n          We can think: \n            Each clone operation gives us m more x's. \n            We start with total_x = m, and we need total_x >= n.\n\n            We do one clone: \n                operations += 1   (because we are counting the clone operation)\n                total_x += m   -> but note: we are not actually changing m? \n\n            But the variable m is the frequency in the original array. It doesn't change.\n\n          How do we update? \n\n          Actually, the variable m is fixed. \n\n          The idea: \n            We are going to do k cloning operations. Then the total x's becomes m*(k+1). \n            We require m*(k+1) >= n -> k >= ceil(n/m)-1.\n\n            Then total operations = k + (n-m) = ceil(n/m)-1 + (n-m)\n\n          How to compute ceil(n/m)? \n            k_min = (n + m - 1) // m - 1   ? \n            But if n is divisible by m, then ceil(n/m)=n/m, so k_min = n/m - 1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            k_min = 0\n            current_total = m\n            while current_total < n:\n                k_min += 1\n                current_total += m   # because we clone and get m more x's\n\n            Then total operations = k_min + (n-m)\n\n          But note: the while loop condition in the code is while(m<n). And we are updating what? \n\n          The code has:\n\n            ans = n - m   # this is the number of swaps\n            while(m<n):\n                # TODO: update ans and m?\n\n          We can simulate the cloning operations: \n            Each time we clone, we do:\n                ans += 1   # because we count the clone operation\n                m = m * 2   ?  -> no, because m is the frequency per copy? and we are not changing the frequency per copy, we are increasing the total available x's.\n\n          But note: the variable m is the maximum frequency in the original array. It doesn't change.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the variable m as the total available x's? \n\n          But the problem: we have multiple copies. \n\n          Actually, we can reinterpret: \n            Let available = m   (the total x's we have initially, which is the frequency in the original array, but note: we have one copy so available = m)\n            Then we do:\n                while available < n:\n                    # we do a clone: which gives us a new copy that has m x's? so we add m to the total available x's? \n                    available += m   # but wait, the new copy has m x's, but we can take x's from it? so the total available x's becomes available + m.\n                    ans += 1   # for the clone operation\n\n            Then at the end, we have available x's >= n, and we do n - (original m) swaps? \n\n          But note: the original ans was set to n-m (the swaps). Then we add the clone operations.\n\n          So the total operations = (n-m) + (number of clones)\n\n          But the number of clones is the number of times we did the while loop.\n\n          Therefore, the TODO block is:\n\n                ans += 1   # for the clone operation\n                m *= 2     # ? \n\n          Why m *= 2? \n\n          Actually, after a clone, the total available x's becomes m (from the original) + m (from the clone) = 2m? \n\n          Then we set m = 2m? \n\n          But then the next clone would add 2m? \n\n          However, the next clone: we clone one of the copies? which one? we can choose any. The new copy will have the same array? so it has the same frequency of x? which is the original m? \n\n          Therefore, the total available x's becomes 2m + m = 3m? \n\n          But wait: we have three copies: the original and two clones? each has m x's? so total x's = 3m.\n\n          So we should not update m (the frequency per copy) but we are using m to represent the total available x's? \n\n          The code uses m for two purposes? \n\n          Actually, the variable m is defined as:\n\n            m = max(Counter(li).values())\n\n          This is the frequency in the original array. It does not change.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot update m. \n\n          We need a new variable? but the code does not have one.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the variable ans to be the total operations (which starts at n-m, the swaps) and then we add the number of clones. \n\n          And we can compute the number of clones as the minimal k such that m*(k+1) >= n.\n\n          How to compute k without a new variable? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            total = m\n            while total < n:\n                clones += 1\n                total += m   # because each clone adds m x's\n\n            ans += clones\n\n          But the code does not have a new variable. \n\n          We can use the variable m? but we need the original m for the total available x's computation.\n\n          Alternatively, we can update a variable that we have? \n\n          The code has:\n\n            ans = n - m   # the swaps\n            while m < n:\n                # we do one clone: \n                ans += 1\n                m += m   # ? -> but then m becomes 2m? \n\n          But then the condition: while m < n -> if we set m = 2m, then we break when m>=n.\n\n          How many times do we run the loop? \n            We start with m0 = original m.\n            Then we set m = 2*m0, then 4*m0, ... until >=n.\n\n          The number of clones is the number of iterations.\n\n          But note: the total available x's after k clones is: m0 * (2^k) ? \n            Actually: \n                Initially: m0\n                After 1 clone: m0 + m0 = 2*m0\n                After 2 clones: 2*m0 + m0 = 3*m0? not 4*m0.\n\n          We are not doubling the total available x's, we are adding m0 each time.\n\n          Therefore, we cannot set m = 2*m. \n\n          We need to add m0 each time. But we don't have m0 stored? \n\n          We can store the original m? \n\n          But the code does not have a new variable.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the variable ans to accumulate the clones and use a separate variable for the total available x's? \n\n          But the code does not have a new variable.\n\n          How about we change the condition? \n\n          We know: \n            We need to do k clones such that: m0*(k+1) >= n.\n\n            Then k = ceil(n/m0) - 1.\n\n          Then we can do:\n\n            ans += max(0, (n + m - 1) // m - 1)   # but note: if n<=m, then we don't need any clone.\n\n          But the while condition is while m<n, so we are in the loop only when m<n.\n\n          How to compute k without a loop? \n\n            k = 0\n            if m < n:\n                k = (n - 1) // m   # because ceil(n/m) = (n+m-1)//m, then k_min = (n+m-1)//m - 1\n                # but (n+m-1)//m is the ceiling of n/m.\n\n            Then ans += k\n\n          But the problem: the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, but n can be up to 10^5, and t up to 10000, but the total n<=10^5, so we can do a loop for the number of clones? \n\n          However, the while loop in the code is:\n\n            while(m<n):\n                # TODO\n\n          We want to break out of the loop after k_min iterations? \n\n          But we don't want to run k_min times if k_min is large? \n\n          Alternatively, we can break out in one step? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            # We are going to do k_min = ceil(n/m) - 1 clones, so we break the loop and add k_min to ans?\n            # But the loop condition is while(m<n). We cannot break the loop in one iteration? \n\n          How about we do:\n\n            ans += (n - 1) // m   # because ceil(n/m)-1 = (n-1)//m   ??? \n\n          Let me check: \n            ceil(n/m) = (n+m-1)//m   (integer division)\n            Then ceil(n/m)-1 = (n+m-1)//m - 1.\n\n          But (n-1)//m is not the same.\n\n          Example: n=6, m=2 -> ceil(6/2)=3, then k_min=2.\n            (n-1)//m = 5//2 = 2 -> so we can do: \n                ans += (n-1)//m\n\n          Then total ans = (n-m) + (n-1)//m = (6-2) + 2 = 6.\n\n          Example: n=5, m=2 -> ceil(5/2)=3, k_min=2.\n            (n-1)//m = 4//2=2 -> ans = (5-2)+2 = 5.\n\n          But is that correct? \n            We need 2 clones: then total x's = 2*(2+1)=6>=5 -> then we do 5-2=3 swaps -> total operations=2+3=5.\n\n          Example: n=4, m=3 -> \n            k_min = ceil(4/3)-1 = 2-1=1 -> then operations = 1 + (4-3)=2.\n            (n-1)//m = 3//3=1 -> ans = (4-3)+1=2.\n\n          Example: n=3, m=3 -> \n            k_min = ceil(3/3)-1=0 -> operations=0.\n            (n-1)//m = 2//3=0 -> ans= (3-3)+0=0.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            ans = n - m\n            if m < n:\n                ans += (n-1)//m\n\n          But the code has a while loop. We can break the loop by doing:\n\n            ans += (n-1)//m\n            break\n\n          But the while loop condition is while(m<n). We break after one iteration? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            clones = (n-1)//m\n            ans += clones\n            break\n\n          Then we break the loop.\n\n          But the condition of the while loop: we break after the first iteration? \n\n          Therefore, the TODO block is:\n\n            clones = (n-1) // m\n            ans += clones\n            break\n\n          But note: the while loop runs only once? \n\n          However, we break the loop, so it runs only once.\n\n          But what if we don't break? then it would run forever? \n\n          So we break.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n\n            for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(li:=li.split());\n                m = max(Counter(li).values())\n                ans =n-m\n                while(m<n):\n                    clones = (n-1) // m\n                    ans += clones\n                    break\n                print(ans)\n\n          But wait, what if we don't break? then the next iteration m is still the same and we do the same thing? \n\n          We break to avoid infinite loop? \n\n          Alternatively, we can simply break the loop by not having a loop? \n\n          But the problem says \"complete the code\", and the code has a while loop.\n\n          We can also do:\n\n            ans += (n-1) // m\n            break\n\n          without the variable clones.\n\n          So:\n\n            ans += (n-1) // m\n            break\n\n          This is the completion.\n\n        However, note: the array elements can be negative? but the frequency is always positive. \n\n        But the array elements are read as strings? because we split the string and then use Counter on the string. \n\n        The problem: the array elements are integers, but we are reading them as strings? \n\n        Example: \n          Input: \"1 1 1\" -> li.split() -> ['1','1','1'] -> then m=3.\n\n        But what if the array has negative numbers? \n          Example: \"1 -1 1\" -> then the elements are ['1', '-1', '1'] -> then frequency of '1' is 2, frequency of '-1' is 1 -> m=2.\n\n        That is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n            ans += (n-1) // m\n            break\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is while(m<n). We break immediately. \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid the while loop by not having it? but the problem says to complete the code and the while loop is there.\n\n        We break after one iteration.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            ans += (n-1) // m\n            break\n\n        But note: the integer division in Python for nonnegative numbers is floor division. (n-1)//m is the floor of (n-1)/m, which is the same as ceil(n/m)-1? \n\n        We have: \n            ceil(n/m) = (n+m-1)//m   (for positive integers)\n            Then ceil(n/m)-1 = (n+m-1)//m - 1 = (n-1)//m   ??? \n\n        Let me check: \n            n=6, m=2: \n                ceil(6/2)=3, then 3-1=2.\n                (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 -> same.\n\n            n=5, m=2: \n                ceil(5/2)=3, then 3-1=2.\n                (5-1)//2 = 4//2=2 -> same.\n\n            n=4, m=3: \n                ceil(4/3)= ceil(1.33)=2, then 2-1=1.\n                (4-1)//3 = 3//3=1 -> same.\n\n        Therefore, (n-1)//m = ceil(n/m)-1.\n\n        So the code is correct.\n\n        However, what if m==0? \n            Then n must be 0? because m is the max frequency, and n is the length. But n>=1, so m>=1.\n\n        Therefore, we are safe.\n\n        So the completions:\n\n          program1: \n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n          program2:\n            ans += (n-1) // m\n            break\n\n        But note: the problem says the output format is a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n        We must output the exact code strings.\n\n        For program1, the code is two lines, and we must be careful with the indentation. The existing code has 12 spaces for the inner if block? \n\n        Actually, the existing code:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int,input().split()))\n                tot = a[0]\n\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if tot < 0:\n                        break\n                    elif tot == 0:\n                        if a[i] != 0:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n                            if a[i] < 0:\n                                break\n                            tot = a[i]\n\n        So the code for program1 is:\n\n            \"            if a[i] < 0:\\n                break\\n            tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But note: the existing code has 12 spaces at the beginning of the line for the inner if. So we must preserve that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write the two lines with the same indentation? \n\n        The current block is at 16 spaces? (because it is inside two ifs: the for loop and the elif and then the if a[i]!=0). \n\n        Actually, the structure:\n\n            for i in ...:\n                ... (8 spaces)\n                elif ...:   (8 spaces)\n                    if ...:   (12 spaces)\n                        ...   (16 spaces)\n\n        So the two lines we add should be at 16 and 20 spaces? \n\n        But the break and tot assignment are inside the if a[i]!=0 and then inside the if a[i]<0? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            elif tot == 0:\n                if a[i] != 0:\n                    if a[i] < 0:   # 16 spaces\n                        break       # 20 spaces\n                    tot = a[i]      # 16 spaces? but this is after the if, so same level as the inner if.\n\n        How about:\n\n            elif tot == 0:\n                if a[i] != 0:\n                    if a[i] < 0:\n                        break\n                    tot = a[i]\n\n        The break is at 16+4=20, and the tot assignment is at 16? \n\n        But the tot assignment is at the same level as the inner if? \n\n        Therefore, the code for program1 is:\n\n            Line1: \"                    if a[i] < 0:\"\n            Line2: \"                        break\"\n            Line3: \"                    tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But wait, the tot assignment should be outside the inner if a[i]<0? \n\n        So:\n\n            if a[i] != 0:\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                tot = a[i]\n\n        Therefore, the tot assignment is at the same level as the inner if, so 12 spaces? \n\n        The structure:\n\n            for i in ...:\n                ... (8 spaces)\n                elif ...:   (8 spaces)\n                    if ...:   (12 spaces)\n                        if ...:   (16 spaces)\n                            ... (20 spaces)\n                        ... (12 spaces)   for the tot assignment\n\n        Actually, the tot assignment is after the inner if, so it is at 12 spaces.\n\n        How many spaces? \n\n        The existing code has 12 spaces for the line \"if a[i] != 0:\". Then the next line we want to add:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:   -> at 12 spaces? no, we are inside the if a[i]!=0, so we add 4 more -> 16 spaces.\n\n        Then the break: 20 spaces.\n\n        Then the tot assignment: we break out of the inner if, so we go back to 12 spaces? \n\n        But the tot assignment should be done only if a[i]>=0? so it should be in the else of the inner if? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            else:\n                tot = a[i]\n\n        But that adds an extra line.\n\n        Or we can do:\n\n            if a[i] < 0: break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        But that is not the style.\n\n        Given the constraints, we output:\n\n            \"    if a[i] < 0:\\n        break\\n    tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But we must match the existing indentation.\n\n        The existing code has:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int,input().split()))\n                tot = a[0]\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if tot < 0:\n                        break\n                    elif tot == 0:\n                        if a[i] != 0:\n\n        The next line after the if a[i]!=0: is currently a comment. We replace the comment with:\n\n                        if a[i] < 0:\n                            break\n                        tot = a[i]\n\n        So the code becomes:\n\n                        if a[i] < 0:\n                            break\n                        tot = a[i]\n\n        The first line: 12 spaces + \"if a[i] < 0:\" -> 12 spaces for the if, then 16 for the break, then 12 for the tot.\n\n        Therefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n            \"if a[i] < 0:\\n                break\\n            tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But wait, the existing code has 12 spaces for the if a[i]!=0, then we add:\n\n            Line1: 12 spaces + \"if a[i] < 0:\" -> that's 12 spaces\n            Line2: 16 spaces + \"break\"\n            Line3: 12 spaces + \"tot = a[i]\"\n\n        How many spaces per level? 4.\n\n        So:\n\n            Level0: 0\n            Level1: 4\n            Level2: 8\n            Level3: 12\n            Level4: 16\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            elif tot == 0:   # at level2 (8 spaces)\n                if a[i] != 0:   # at level3 (12 spaces)\n                    if a[i] < 0:   # at level4 (16 spaces)\n                        break       # at level5 (20 spaces)\n                    tot = a[i]      # at level4 (16 spaces)  -> but wait, this is after the if, so it should be at level3? \n\n        Actually, the tot assignment should be at the same level as the inner if? \n\n        The structure:\n\n            for i in range(1, n):\n                ... (level1: 4 spaces)\n                elif ...: (level1: 4 spaces? but the code has 8? \n\n        Let me count the existing code:\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):   # level0\n                n = int(input())             # level1: 4 spaces\n                a = list(map(int,input().split()))   # level1: 4 spaces\n                tot = a[0]                   # level1: 4 spaces\n\n                for i in range(1, n):        # level1: 4 spaces\n                    if tot < 0:              # level2: 8 spaces\n                        break                # level3: 12 spaces\n                    elif tot == 0:           # level2: 8 spaces\n                        if a[i] != 0:        # level3: 12 spaces\n                            # TODO            # level4: 16 spaces\n\n        So the TODO is at 16 spaces.\n\n        Then we replace the TODO with:\n\n                            if a[i] < 0:     # 16 spaces\n                                break         # 20 spaces\n                            tot = a[i]        # 16 spaces   -> but this is after the if, so it should be at 16 spaces? \n\n        But note: the tot assignment should be done only when a[i] is not negative? and we break if negative. \n\n        So:\n\n            if a[i] != 0:\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    tot = a[i]\n\n        But we can avoid the else by:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        And this is at the same level as the inner if? \n\n        Actually, after the inner if, we do the tot assignment. \n\n        But the tot assignment is not inside the inner if. \n\n        Therefore, the tot assignment is at 16 spaces? \n\n        But note: the break breaks the for loop, so if we break, we don't do the tot assignment.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            elif tot == 0:\n                if a[i] != 0:\n                    if a[i] < 0:\n                        break\n                    tot = a[i]\n\n        The tot assignment is at 16 spaces? \n\n        But the existing code has the if a[i]!=0 at 12 spaces, then the next line we want to add:\n\n            Line1: 12 spaces + \"if a[i] < 0:\" -> no, we are inside the if a[i]!=0, so we are at 12 spaces, then we add an if: so we indent to 16.\n\n        So:\n\n            Line1: 16 spaces + \"if a[i] < 0:\"\n            Line2: 20 spaces + \"break\"\n            Line3: 16 spaces + \"tot = a[i]\"\n\n        Therefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n            \"if a[i] < 0:\\n    break\\ntot = a[i]\"\n\n        but with 16, 20, and 16 spaces respectively.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            program1_str = \"                if a[i] < 0:\\n                    break\\n                tot = a[i]\"\n\n        How many spaces? \n            The first line: 16 spaces -> 16/4=4 tabs? but we use spaces.\n\n            We can count: \n                The existing code has 12 spaces for the if a[i]!=0, then we add:\n\n                    if a[i] < 0:   -> 12+4=16 spaces\n                    break           -> 16+4=20 spaces\n                    tot = a[i]      -> 16 spaces (because we go back after the if)\n\n        So:\n\n            Line1: 16 spaces + \"if a[i] < 0:\"\n            Line2: 20 spaces + \"break\"\n            Line3: 16 spaces + \"tot = a[i]\"\n\n        Therefore, the string is:\n\n            \"                if a[i] < 0:\\n                    break\\n                tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But note: the third line is 16 spaces: 16 spaces = 16 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without counting spaces? \n\n        Since the existing code has 12 spaces for the if a[i]!=0, we add 4 more spaces for the inner if.\n\n        So:\n\n            program1 = \"    if a[i] < 0:\\n        break\\n    tot = a[i]\"\n\n        but then the total spaces for the first line would be 12+4=16? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            base_indent = 12\n            then we add:\n                line1: base_indent + 4 = 16 spaces: \"if a[i] < 0:\"\n                line2: base_indent + 8 = 20 spaces: \"break\"\n                line3: base_indent + 0 = 12 spaces? -> no, the tot assignment is at the same level as the inner if? which is base_indent? \n\n        But the tot assignment is not inside the inner if, it is after it? so it should be at base_indent (12 spaces) or at base_indent+4 (16 spaces) because it is inside the if a[i]!=0? \n\n        The structure:\n\n            if a[i] != 0:   # 12 spaces\n                ... inner if ...   # 16 spaces\n                tot = a[i]         # 12 or 16? \n\n        Actually, the tot assignment is part of the if a[i]!=0 block, so it should be at 16 spaces? \n\n        But we want to do it only if a[i] is not negative? and we break if negative. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if a[i] != 0:\n                if a[i] < 0:\n                    break\n                else:\n                    tot = a[i]\n\n        Then the tot assignment is inside the else, so 20 spaces? \n\n        But that is more lines.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if a[i] != 0 and a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            elif a[i] != 0:   # then a[i]>=0\n                tot = a[i]\n\n        But that is two conditions.\n\n        Given the simplicity, we output:\n\n            if a[i] < 0:\n                break\n            tot = a[i]\n\n        at the same indentation as the inner if? \n\n        Actually, the inner if (a[i]!=0) has a block that is two statements: an if and a break, and then an assignment? \n\n        But the assignment is not in the if, it is after the if. \n\n        Therefore, the assignment is at the same level as the inner if? \n\n        But the inner if is at 16 spaces, and the assignment is also at 16 spaces? \n\n        So the three lines:\n\n            16 spaces: if a[i] < 0:\n            20 spaces:     break\n            16 spaces: tot = a[i]\n\n        But then if a[i] is negative, we break and skip the assignment. If positive, we do the assignment.\n\n        However, if a[i] is zero, we skip the inner if a[i]!=0 entirely.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            elif tot == 0:\n                if a[i] != 0:   # 12 spaces\n                    if a[i] < 0:   # 16 spaces\n                        break      # 20 spaces\n                    tot = a[i]     # 16 spaces\n\n        This is valid.\n\n        Therefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n            \"    if a[i] < 0:\\n        break\\n    tot = a[i]\"\n\n        but with 16, 20, 16 spaces.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            program1 = \"    if a[i] < 0:\\n        break\\n    tot = a[i]\"\n\n        But to be precise, we use:\n\n            program1 = \"                if a[i] < 0:\\n                    break\\n                tot = a[i]\"\n\n        because:\n          The base is 12 spaces, then we add 4 more for the inner if -> 16 spaces for the if and the tot assignment, and 20 for the break.\n\n        How many spaces? 16 and 20.\n\n        But 16 spaces: 16 characters of space.\n\n        We can generate:\n\n            line1: 16 spaces + \"if a[i] < 0:\"\n            line2: 20 spaces + \"break\"\n            line3: 16 spaces + \"tot = a[i]\"\n\n        So:\n\n            program1 = \"                if a[i] < 0:\\n                    break\\n                tot = a[i]\"\n\n        For program2, the code is:\n\n            ans += (n-1) // m\n            break\n\n        at the same indentation as the while loop body.\n\n        The while loop body is at 8 spaces? \n\n        The code:\n\n            for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(li:=li.split());\n                m = max(Counter(li).values())\n                ans =n-m\n                while(m<n):\n                    # TODO\n\n        So the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n        We replace with:\n\n                    ans += (n-1) // m\n                    break\n\n        So the string for program2 is:\n\n            \"ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n\n        But we need 8 spaces for each line? \n\n        Actually, the while loop body should be indented by 4 more? \n\n        The existing code has 4 spaces for the for loop body, then the while loop is inside, so 8 spaces.\n\n        So:\n\n            program2 = \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n\n        But the break is also at 8 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            program2 = \"    ans += (n-1) // m\\n    break\"\n\n        but the base is 8 spaces? \n\n        We can count: \n            for loop: 4 spaces for the body.\n            while loop: 8 spaces for the body.\n\n        So the two lines are at 8 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, the string for program2 is:\n\n            \"    ans += (n-1) // m\\n    break\"\n\n        But wait, the first line of the while loop body is at 8 spaces, then the break is also at 8 spaces.\n\n        So:\n\n            program2 = \"ans += (n-1) // m\\nbreak\"\n\n        but then we lose the indentation.\n\n        We must include the indentation.\n\n        So:\n\n            program2 = \"    ans += (n-1) // m\\n    break\"\n\n        This is 4 spaces per level? and the while loop body is one level (4 spaces) more than the while loop line.\n\n        But the while loop line is at 4 spaces, so the body is 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for ...:   # 0\n                ...    # 4 spaces\n                while ...:   # 4 spaces\n                    ...   # 8 spaces\n\n        Therefore, the two lines are at 8 spaces? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            program2 = \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n\n        but that is 8 spaces per line.\n\n        Or:\n\n            program2 = \"    ans += (n-1) // m\\n    break\"   # 4 spaces per line? -> 4+4=8? \n\n        Actually, 4 spaces for the first indent and then 4 more for the while body -> 8.\n\n        But the string should be:\n\n            \"        ans += (n-1) // m\"\n            \"        break\"\n\n        So:\n\n            program2 = \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n\n        But note: the existing code has 8 spaces for the while loop body.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"                if a[i] < 0:\\n                    break\\n                tot = a[i]\"\n            program2: \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n\n        But we can also use the exact string as we would type.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without specifying the exact spaces? but the problem requires the exact code.\n\n        Given the complexity, we output the json.\n\n        Example output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"                if a[i] < 0:\\n                    break\\n                tot = a[i]\",\n                \"program2\": \"        ans += (n-1) // m\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2 has two lines, each with 8 spaces at the beginning? \n\n        Actually, in the program2 code, the while loop body should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the while? \n\n        The code:\n\n            for ...:\n                n=...\n                m=...\n                ans=...\n                while ...:\n                    ...   # 4 spaces inside the while\n\n        But the for loop body is 4 spaces, so the while loop is 4 spaces, and the while loop body is 8 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, the two lines are 8 spaces each.\n\n        But the string we output should be the exact code to put in the TODO.\n\n        So we output."
