The first example: Input: \n                  5 2\n                  1 2 3 4 5\n                  1 1 1 1 1\n                  1 1\n                  1 1\n\n                After the first query, a = [1,2,2,4,5] -> so the first query is: i=3, x=2? Because initially a = [1,2,3,4,5], then update the third element to 2: a[2]=2 -> [1,2,2,4,5]. Then the answer after the first query is 29. Then the next query: i=1, x=1 -> update a[0] to 1 (which is already 1) -> no change, then output 29 again. Therefore, the online judge input for the first example has m=2, and two queries. So we read:\n                n=5, m=2\n                a = [1,2,3,4,5]   (first line after n,m) then the next line: [1,1,1,1,1] -> but we don't use it. Then the first query: \"1 1\" -> update a[0] to 1 -> no change. Then the second query: we don't know, but then the example says after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5] -> so the first query must be updating the third element to 2. The query format: \"i x\" -> the i-th element. The first query: \"3 2\" -> update the third element to 2. So the input is:\n                5 2\n                1 2 3 4 5\n                1 1 1 1 1   # this line is not used\n                3 2\n                1 1 We ignore the second row. Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split() if not data:\n                exit(0)\n\n            n = int(data[0])\n            m = int(data[1]) a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n            # next n integers are the second row, we skip\n            index = 2+n\n            # next n integers: we skip\n            index += n\n\n            # Precompute base = n*(n+1)//2\n            base = n*(n+1)//2\n\n            # Precompute w: for i in range(n-1): w[i] = (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n            w = [0] * (n)  # we only use indices 0 to n-2\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                w[i] = (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n            # Build the initial f array for adjacent pairs: length n-1\n            f =",

But the problem says: \"after each query print the answer\"\n\n          So for the first example, if there are no queries, then we only output the answer for the initial array. Therefore, for the sample input with n=6 and the array a = [1,0,0,1,0,0] (first row) and the second row is [0,1,0,0,0,1] (which is not used), we output 29. So the second row is provided in the input but not used. Why is it provided?",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given n, then two lines for the current arrangement, and two lines for the desired arrangement.\n\n However, note that the problem has two rows. We are allowed to swap neighboring cells (adjacent horizontally or vertically).\n\n Important observation: \n The problem can be transformed by considering the difference between the two rows. Specifically, note that the entire puzzle has 2n cells. But note that the operations (swaps) preserve the total number of 1's in the entire grid? Actually, no: swapping two adjacent cells doesn't change the total count of 1's. Therefore, a necessary condition is that the total number of 1's in the initial grid must equal that in the desired grid.\n\n However, note that the problem does not require preserving the total per row? Actually, the grid has two rows. Let:\n   initial grid: row0 = [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}], row1 = [b0, b1, ..., b_{n-1}]\n   desired grid: row0' = [c0, c1, ..., c_{n-1}], row1' = [d0, d1, ..., d_{n-1}]\n\n Then, we must have:\n   sum(a_i) + sum(b_i) = sum(c_i) + sum(d_i)\n\n But that is not the only invariant. Actually, note that a swap operation can be seen as moving a 1 (or a 0) around. However, there is a more refined invariant: the parity of the arrangement? \n\n Alternate approach (known from similar problems): \n Consider the following: \n   Let's define an array d[0..n-1] = (a_i - b_i) for the initial grid, and similarly for the desired grid: d'[i] = c_i - d_i.\n\n However, note that the operations: \n   - Swapping horizontally in the same row: \n        (i, j) and (i, j+1): This is like swapping two adjacent elements in the same row. How does this affect d? \n        Actually, d_j = a_j - b_j, and d_{j+1} = a_{j+1} - b_{j+1}. \n        If we swap a_j and a_{j+1} (in row0), then the new d_j = a_{j+1} - b_j, and d_{j+1} = a_j - b_{j+1}. \n        This does not preserve the d array? \n\n Another idea: \n   Instead, note that the entire grid has two rows. We can consider the state as two rows. But note that a vertical swap (between the two rows in the same column) swaps the two elements in that column. \n\n   Operation types:\n     1. Swap between (0, j) and (0, j+1): \n          This changes: \n             (a_j, a_{j+1}) -> (a_{j+1}, a_j)\n          and leaves the b row unchanged. \n     2. Swap between (1, j) and (1, j+1): \n          Similarly: (b_j, b_{j+1}) -> (b_{j+1}, b_j)\n     3. Swap between (0, j) and (1, j): \n          This changes: (a_j, b_j) -> (b_j, a_j)\n\n   And note that a swap between (0, j) and (1, j+1) is not allowed because they are not adjacent (they are diagonal). Similarly, (1, j) and (0, j+1) are not adjacent.\n\n Therefore, the operations are:\n   - Horizontal swaps in the same row (adjacent columns in the same row)\n   - Vertical swaps (same column, between the two rows)\n\n How to model the problem?\n\n Insight: \n   We can think of the grid as two independent rows? But note the vertical swap: it only affects one column.\n\n   However, note that the vertical swap in a column j flips the two elements in that column. This operation is independent of the others? \n\n   Actually, we can break the problem into two parts:\n     1. The total number of 1's must be the same in the initial and desired grid. (Let total_initial = total_final, otherwise output -1)\n     2. We can use the vertical swaps to fix the columns one by one? \n\n   But note: we are allowed to do any sequence of swaps. The problem is to find the minimal number of swaps.\n\n   Known similar problem: \"Puzzle\" from CodeForces? \n\n   Alternate known solution: \n        Let A = first row of initial, B = second row of initial.\n        Let C = first row of desired, D = second row of desired.\n\n        We must have: \n            total1 = A[i] + B[i] for each column? Actually, the entire grid: sum(A) + sum(B) = sum(C) + sum(D).\n\n        But also, note that a vertical swap in column i flips A[i] and B[i]. So the parity of the arrangement in each column? Actually, the multiset of pairs (A[i], B[i]) must be the same as (C[i], D[i])? Not exactly, because we can also do horizontal swaps which move the elements between columns.\n\n        Actually, the horizontal swaps allow us to rearrange arbitrarily the elements in the top row? and arbitrarily in the bottom row? But note: we cannot move an element from the top row to the bottom row by horizontal swaps. Only vertical swaps can change the row of an element, and then only in the same column.\n\n        Therefore, we can rearrange the top row arbitrarily? and the bottom row arbitrarily? But wait: a vertical swap in a column swaps the two elements, so we can also change which element is in which row. \n\n        Actually, the entire set of elements in the top row of the initial must be the same as the entire set of elements in the top row of the desired? and similarly for the bottom? \n\n        However, note: we can swap an element from the top row to the bottom row (by a vertical swap) and then move it horizontally in the bottom row? Similarly, we can move an element from the bottom row to the top row? \n\n        Therefore, the entire multiset of the top row of the initial and the entire multiset of the top row of the desired must be the same? Actually, no: because we can also swap between rows? \n\n        Actually, the entire grid has 2n elements. The horizontal swaps allow independent permutations of the top row and the bottom row? But the vertical swaps allow swapping between the two rows in the same column. This is equivalent to: \n          We can rearrange the two rows arbitrarily as long as the multiset of the entire grid is preserved? \n\n        However, note: the vertical swap in a column doesn't change the multiset of the entire grid. And horizontal swaps also don't. Therefore, the necessary conditions are:\n          Condition 1: The multiset of all 2n elements in the initial grid must equal that of the desired grid.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require the entire grid to be rearranged arbitrarily? Actually, the problem is about transforming the grid to the desired grid.\n\n        However, we can also note: \n          The horizontal swaps allow us to rearrange the top row arbitrarily and the bottom row arbitrarily? But wait: we can also use vertical swaps to swap two elements in the same column and then use horizontal swaps to move them to different columns? \n\n        Actually, we can achieve any permutation of the entire grid? Not exactly: because the operations are adjacent swaps, and the grid is two rows. The entire grid is a graph of two rows and n columns, which is connected. Therefore, we can rearrange the entire grid arbitrarily? \n\n        But note: the parity of the permutation? Actually, the grid is a graph of two rows and n columns: it is a grid graph of 2 rows and n columns. The adjacent swaps generate the entire symmetric group? Actually, no: because the graph is bipartite? \n\n        However, note: the grid has 2n nodes. The adjacent swaps (on a grid of two rows and n columns) generate the entire symmetric group? Actually, it is known that for a grid of two rows, the adjacent swaps generate the entire symmetric group if and only if the grid has at least two columns? But note: we have two rows and n columns, and we can do any even permutation? \n\n        But wait: we don't care about the parity? Because we are counting the minimal number of swaps? \n\n        Actually, the problem is: we are allowed adjacent swaps (any adjacent in the grid). The minimal number of swaps to rearrange the entire grid? But note: we are not required to rearrange arbitrarily, but to a specific desired arrangement.\n\n        However, the problem is easier: we are only concerned with the minimal number of swaps to achieve the desired arrangement.\n\n        But note: the problem does not require to rearrange the entire grid arbitrarily? It requires the minimal number of swaps to achieve the desired arrangement.\n\n        How to compute the minimal number of swaps? \n\n        Known: \n          The minimal number of swaps to rearrange an array is the inversion count? But here we have two rows and we can swap adjacent in the grid.\n\n        Alternate approach (from known solutions to similar problems):\n\n        We can consider the following: \n          Let's define an array of \"errors\". Specifically, for each column i, we have two values: \n             current: (A[i], B[i])\n             desired: (C[i], D[i])\n\n          We want to fix the grid. \n\n        Insight: \n          We note that the vertical swap at a column i flips the two elements in that column. Therefore, we can assign a state to each column: \n             state i: \n                0: if the column i is already as desired (i.e., A[i]==C[i] and B[i]==D[i])\n                1: if the column i has the two elements swapped (i.e., A[i]==D[i] and B[i]==C[i])\n\n          But note: it is also possible that the column is neither? Then we have a problem.\n\n        Actually, the necessary condition for each column: \n          The multiset {A[i], B[i]} must equal the multiset {C[i], D[i]}. \n          If not, then it's impossible.\n\n        Therefore, we must have for each column i: \n          {A[i], B[i]} = {C[i], D[i]}\n\n        Then, we can represent the state of column i by:\n          - If A[i] == C[i] and B[i] == D[i]: then we don't need a vertical swap in this column.\n          - Else (then necessarily A[i] = D[i] and B[i] = C[i]): then we need a vertical swap in this column.\n\n        But note: we can also fix the grid by moving the elements horizontally? \n\n        Actually, the problem is: we are allowed to do any sequence of adjacent swaps. How to count the minimal number?\n\n        However, note: we can also move an element from one column to another? So the elements can be rearranged arbitrarily? \n\n        Therefore, the problem becomes: \n          We have two rows. The initial grid has two rows of n elements. The desired grid has two rows of n elements. We can swap adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically). What is the minimal number of swaps?\n\n        This is equivalent to: \n          We have 2n elements. We know the initial positions and the desired positions. The minimal number of adjacent swaps to rearrange the elements is the inversion count? But note: the grid is two rows, so the positions are two-dimensional.\n\n        The inversion count in 2D? \n\n        Actually, the minimal number of adjacent swaps to rearrange a 2D grid is the sum of the Manhattan distances of each element from its initial position to its desired position? But that is for independent moves? \n\n        However, adjacent swaps are used and the grid is connected. The minimal number of adjacent swaps to rearrange the grid is the same as the sum of the Manhattan distances of each element from its start to its goal, divided by 2? Because each swap moves two elements? Actually, no: each swap moves two adjacent elements, so it reduces the total displacement by at most 2? \n\n        Actually, the problem is known: \n          \"Sliding puzzle\" but with two rows and n columns. \n\n        However, note: we are allowed to swap any two adjacent cells (without a blank). This is the same as the 15-puzzle? \n\n        The 15-puzzle has a well-known solvability condition and the minimal moves are computed by the Manhattan distance of the tiles plus the parity condition? \n\n        But note: in our problem, the grid has two rows and n columns, and we have two kinds of tiles: 0's and 1's. And the tiles are not distinct? \n\n        Actually, the problem has non-distinct tiles: we have 0's and 1's. \n\n        Therefore, we cannot use the standard 15-puzzle because the tiles are not distinct.\n\n        How to proceed?\n\n        We must have:\n          Condition 1: The total number of 1's in the initial grid equals that in the desired grid.\n          Condition 2: For each column i, the multiset {A[i], B[i]} must equal {C[i], D[i]}.\n\n        But note: Condition 2 is necessary? Actually, no: because we can move elements between columns. \n\n        Actually, we can move an element from column i to column j arbitrarily? So the entire grid: the multiset of the top row of the initial must equal the multiset of the top row of the desired? and similarly for the bottom? \n\n        But wait: we can also flip the rows in a column arbitrarily? So actually, the entire grid: the multiset of the initial grid must equal the multiset of the desired grid. And that is Condition 1? \n\n        However, Condition 1 is the entire grid. But we also need to assign the elements to the two rows? \n\n        Actually, the top row of the desired must be a permutation of the entire set of elements that are in the top row of the initial? Not exactly: because we can flip columns. \n\n        Actually, the entire grid is fixed. The only freedom is to assign each element to a row? But note: we can flip a column arbitrarily (by a vertical swap) and then move the elements arbitrarily in the rows? \n\n        Therefore, the necessary conditions are:\n          Condition 1: The entire multiset of the initial grid must equal that of the desired grid.\n\n        But that is already Condition 1 (the total number of 1's).\n\n        However, we also need to assign the 1's to the two rows? Actually, the top row of the desired must have exactly the same number of 1's as the top row of the initial? \n\n        Let:\n          T_initial = number of 1's in the top row of the initial.\n          T_desired = number of 1's in the top row of the desired.\n\n        How can we change the number of 1's in the top row? \n          A vertical swap in a column: if the column has one 1 and one 0, then swapping flips the row of the 1. So it changes the count of the top row by +1 or -1? \n          Specifically, if the column has (1,0) and we swap, it becomes (0,1): then the top row loses a 1 and the bottom gains a 1 -> so T_initial becomes T_initial - 1.\n          Similarly, if the column has (0,1) and we swap, then T_initial becomes T_initial + 1.\n\n        Therefore, we can change T_initial by any even number? Actually, no: we can change it by \u00b11 per vertical swap? \n\n        But note: we can also move 1's horizontally? \n          Moving a 1 from the top row in column i to column j (by horizontal swaps) doesn't change T_initial? It just moves the 1 to a different column in the same row.\n\n        Therefore, the total number of 1's in the top row can be changed only by vertical swaps. And each vertical swap changes the count by \u00b11? Actually, it changes by:\n          If the column has (1,0): then swapping reduces the top row 1's by 1.\n          If the column has (0,1): then swapping increases the top row 1's by 1.\n          If the column has (1,1) or (0,0): swapping doesn't change the count.\n\n        Therefore, the net change in the top row 1's is (number of (0,1) columns that are swapped) - (number of (1,0) columns that are swapped). \n\n        And we require that after all operations, the top row has T_desired 1's.\n\n        But note: we can also do multiple vertical swaps? \n\n        However, we are free to do as many vertical swaps as we want? But we want the minimal number of swaps.\n\n        How to minimize the total number of swaps? \n\n        We have two types of operations: \n          Type 1: Horizontal swap: cost 1, and it swaps two adjacent elements in the same row.\n          Type 2: Vertical swap: cost 1, and it swaps the two elements in the same column.\n\n        We need to assign the elements to their desired positions. \n\n        Known solution from CodeForces for the same problem: \n          We can solve by dynamic programming? But n up to 200,000.\n\n        Alternate known solution (from accepted submissions):\n\n          Let:\n            a = first row of initial\n            b = second row of initial\n            c = first row of desired\n            d = second row of desired\n\n          Check total_ones_initial = a + b, total_ones_desired = c + d -> if not equal, output -1.\n\n          Then, we consider the following:\n\n          We are going to count the minimal number of swaps. \n\n          Idea: \n            We can simulate the process from left to right. We maintain two values:\n              dp0: the minimal number of swaps needed to fix the prefix [0..i-1] and the current state of the two rows at column i is (a_i, b_i) without having any pending vertical swaps? \n            But note: we can also have vertical swaps that we haven't done? \n\n          Actually, we can use a different idea:\n\n          We note that the horizontal swaps can be used to move the 1's arbitrarily within a row. The only issue is that we might need to flip a column to get a 1 from the top to the bottom or vice versa.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal number of swaps is the sum of the horizontal moves and the vertical moves.\n\n          How to compute the horizontal moves? \n            The horizontal moves required for the top row: the minimal number of adjacent swaps to rearrange the top row to the desired top row? \n            Similarly for the bottom row.\n\n          But wait: we can also flip columns. So the top row of the initial might not have the same elements as the top row of the desired? \n\n          Actually, we can choose which columns to flip. We need to assign to the top row a set of 1's that are in the desired top row. \n\n          How to assign the 1's to the rows? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let:\n              total_ones = total_ones_initial\n\n            Then, the desired top row has T = total_ones_desired_top = sum(c)\n\n            We need to have T 1's in the top row at the end. \n\n            How many 1's are currently in the top row? T0 = sum(a)\n\n            We can flip columns to adjust the count. But note: flipping a column that has (1,0) reduces the top row 1's by 1, and flipping a column that has (0,1) increases by 1. \n\n            However, we cannot flip a column arbitrarily? We can flip any column any number of times? But flipping twice is the same as not flipping. So we flip each column at most once.\n\n            Therefore, we need to choose a set S of columns to flip such that:\n                T0 - (# of columns in S that are (1,0)) + (# of columns in S that are (0,1)) = T\n\n            And the cost for vertical swaps is |S|.\n\n            But note: we can also flip columns that are (1,1) or (0,0)? Flipping (1,1) doesn't change the count, and similarly (0,0). So we can flip those arbitrarily? But they cost 1 and don't help. So we avoid flipping them? \n\n            Therefore, we only consider flipping columns that are (1,0) or (0,1). \n\n            Let:\n              x = number of (1,0) columns\n              y = number of (0,1) columns\n\n            Then we require:\n                T0 - a + b = T   => b - a = T - T0, where a = number of (1,0) columns we flip, b = number of (0,1) columns we flip.\n\n            And we have a in [0, x], b in [0, y]. The total vertical cost = a + b.\n\n            But note: we can also flip columns that are (1,1) or (0,0) arbitrarily? They don't change the count, so we don't need to flip them? \n\n            However, there is a catch: the horizontal swaps might require that we flip a column even if it doesn't change the count? \n\n            Actually, no: because if a column is (1,1) and we want it to be (1,1) then we don't flip. If we flip it, it becomes (1,1) again? Actually, no: flipping (1,1) gives (1,1) -> same. Similarly for (0,0). So flipping is not needed.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal vertical cost is the minimal a+b such that b - a = T - T0. \n                => b = a + (T - T0)\n                => we require a in [0, x] and b = a + (T - T0) in [0, y].\n\n            So a must be at least max(0, -(T-T0)) and at most min(x, y - (T-T0))? \n\n            Actually, we have: \n                b = a + (T - T0) \n                => a must satisfy: \n                    0 <= a <= x\n                    0 <= a + (T - T0) <= y\n\n            Then the minimal vertical cost is the minimal a + (a + (T-T0)) = 2a + (T-T0) for a in the valid range? \n\n            But note: we want to minimize the total vertical cost = a + b = a + (a + (T-T0)) = 2a + (T-T0). \n\n            Since (T-T0) is fixed, we minimize by taking the smallest possible a? \n\n            So a_min = max(0, -(T-T0))? But note: if (T-T0) is negative, then we require a >= |T-T0|? \n\n            Actually, let d = T - T0. Then:\n                a >= max(0, -d)   [if d is negative, then a >= -d] \n                and a <= min(x, y - d)\n\n            Then the minimal cost for vertical swaps is: \n                cost_vertical = 2a + d, with a = max(0, -d)   [if that a is in the interval]? \n\n            But we can also take a = max(0, -d) if that a is <= min(x, y-d). If not, then it's impossible? \n\n            However, note: we must have the equation: \n                d = (number of (0,1) flips) - (number of (1,0) flips) = b - a.\n\n            And the total number of (1,0) columns is x, (0,1) columns is y. So we require that the equation b - a = d has a solution with 0<=a<=x, 0<=b<=y. \n            This is equivalent to: \n                a = b - d, and then 0<=b-d<=x and 0<=b<=y -> so b in [max(d,0), min(y, x+d)]? \n\n            Actually, we can also express: \n                a = (b - d) and then we require:\n                  0 <= b-d <= x   => d <= b <= x+d\n                  0 <= b <= y\n                so b in [max(d,0), min(y, x+d)]\n\n            Then the minimal cost_vertical = a + b = (b-d) + b = 2b - d.\n\n            We minimize 2b-d by taking the smallest b in the interval? \n\n            So b_min = max(d,0) and then cost_vertical = 2*max(d,0) - d = max(d,0) if d>=0? \n            But if d>=0, then b_min = d, cost_vertical = 2d - d = d.\n            If d<0, then b_min = 0, but then a = -d, so cost_vertical = 0 + (-d) = -d? \n\n            Actually, if d<0, then we set b=0, then a = -d, so cost_vertical = a + b = -d.\n\n            Therefore, cost_vertical = |d|.\n\n            But wait: is that always possible? We require that b_min is in the interval? \n                If d>=0: we require d<=y and d<=x+d -> which is always true? and d>=0. But we also require that we have at least d columns of (0,1) to flip? \n                Actually, we require b_min = d <= y? and also a = b-d = 0? -> no: a = b-d = d-d=0, which is valid. But we also require that we have at least d columns of (0,1) (so y>=d) and we don't require any (1,0) columns? \n\n            Similarly, if d<0: we require a = -d <= x? \n\n            Therefore, the condition for vertical swaps is:\n                if d>=0: we require y>=d? \n                if d<0: we require x>=-d? \n\n            And then cost_vertical = |d|.\n\n            But note: we might have multiple ways to achieve the same d? However, we are taking the minimal cost: |d|.\n\n            However, what if we don't have enough (0,1) columns when d>=0? Then we cannot achieve d? \n\n            Therefore, the necessary conditions are:\n                Condition 1: total_ones_initial = total_ones_desired.\n                Condition 2: the top row desired has T ones, and the initial top row has T0 ones, then we require:\n                    if d = T - T0, then \n                      if d>=0: y>=d\n                      if d<0: x>=-d\n\n            But note: the entire grid has x+y columns that are not (0,0) or (1,1)? Actually, we defined:\n                x = number of columns i such that (a_i, b_i) = (1,0) in the initial grid? \n                y = number of columns i such that (a_i, b_i) = (0,1) in the initial grid?\n\n            However, the desired grid also has the same per-column multisets? Actually, we did not check that. \n\n            Actually, we must also ensure that the entire grid can be rearranged to the desired grid. \n\n            But note: we can move the columns arbitrarily by horizontal swaps? So the only constraint per column is that the multiset of the two elements in the column is the same as in the desired? \n\n            However, the desired grid also has columns. We don't care about the order of the columns? \n\n            Actually, we can rearrange the columns arbitrarily by horizontal swaps? \n\n            Therefore, the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n                Condition 1: The entire multiset of the initial grid equals that of the desired grid.\n                Condition 2: The number of (1,0) columns in the initial grid (which we called x) must be such that for d = T - T0, we have:\n                    if d>=0: y>=d   [because we need to flip d (0,1) columns to get d more ones in the top row?] \n                    if d<0: x>=-d   [because we need to flip -d (1,0) columns to remove -d ones from the top row]\n\n            But note: the desired grid also has its own (1,0) and (0,1) columns? Actually, we don't need to know that? Because we are only concerned with the total count of ones in the top row.\n\n            However, we must also be able to form the desired grid. Since we can rearrange arbitrarily, the only constraint is the total ones per row? \n\n            Actually, the desired grid has T ones in the top row. And we can achieve that by flipping columns as long as the above condition holds.\n\n            But wait: what about the horizontal swaps? \n\n            The horizontal swaps are used to rearrange the columns arbitrarily. Therefore, the minimal number of horizontal swaps is the number of swaps needed to rearrange the top row to the desired top row? and the bottom row to the desired bottom row? \n\n            However, note: we are going to flip some columns. After flipping, the top row becomes: \n                For a column i that we flip: \n                    if originally (a_i, b_i) = (1,0) and we flip, then it becomes (0,1) -> so the top row becomes 0.\n                    if originally (0,1) and we flip, then it becomes (1,0) -> top row becomes 1.\n\n                For a column we don't flip: \n                    (1,0) -> top row 1, (0,1) -> top row 0, (1,1) -> 1, (0,0) -> 0.\n\n            Therefore, after flipping, the top row is determined. Then we need to rearrange the top row to the desired top row by swapping adjacent elements? \n\n            Similarly for the bottom row.\n\n            The minimal number of adjacent swaps to sort an array is the inversion count. But note: we are not sorting, we are rearranging to a specific desired arrangement.\n\n            How to compute the minimal adjacent swaps to turn an array A into an array B? \n                We can map the values to their indices in the desired array? But the array has duplicates.\n\n            For arrays with duplicates, the minimal adjacent swaps is the inversion count of the permutation that rearranges the sequence of elements in A to the sequence in B? \n\n            But note: we can rearrange arbitrarily? Actually, the minimal adjacent swaps to turn an array A into an array B (with the same multiset) is the inversion count of the permutation that maps the positions of the elements? \n\n            However, we can do: \n                For the top row: \n                  We have an array A (after flipping) of the top row, and we want to turn it into the desired top row C.\n                  But note: we can rearrange the columns arbitrarily? So the minimal number of adjacent swaps to rearrange the top row is the inversion count of the permutation that rearranges the sequence A to the sequence C? \n\n            But wait: the inversion count is for distinct elements. For duplicates, we need to assign the elements in A to the desired positions in C. The minimal adjacent swaps is the same as the minimal number of swaps to turn A into C? \n\n            Actually, we can use the following: \n                We can consider the relative order of the elements that are the same? \n\n            However, there is a known method: \n                We can map the desired array C to an array of indices. Then for the array A, we form an array P where the i-th element is the index in C of the corresponding element (but we have duplicates). \n\n            How to handle duplicates? \n                We can assign the same value in the order of occurrence. \n\n            Example: \n                A = [1, 0, 1]\n                C = [1, 1, 0]\n\n            We want to rearrange A to C. \n                We can map the first '1' in A to the first '1' in C, and the second '1' in A to the second '1' in C. \n                Then the array P for A: \n                    A[0] = 1 -> the first 1 in C is at index0 -> so P[0]=0\n                    A[1] = 0 -> the only 0 in C is at index2 -> so P[1]=2\n                    A[2] = 1 -> the second 1 in C is at index1 -> so P[2]=1\n\n                Then the inversion count of P = [0,2,1] is 1 (the pair (2,1) is an inversion). \n\n            Therefore, the minimal adjacent swaps is the inversion count of P.\n\n            Similarly for the bottom row.\n\n            Then the total cost = cost_vertical (which is |d|) + inversion_count_top + inversion_count_bottom.\n\n            But note: we also have the freedom to choose which (0,1) and (1,0) columns to flip? And we want to minimize the total cost? \n\n            However, we fixed the vertical cost to |d|? But we also have to consider that the flipping changes the top row array? \n\n            Actually, the flipping changes the top row array. Therefore, the array A (the top row after flipping) depends on which columns we flip. \n\n            How to minimize the total cost? \n\n            We have to choose a set S of columns (the ones that are (1,0) or (0,1)) to flip such that:\n                the net change in the top row ones is d = T - T0, and then the inversion counts for the top and bottom rows are minimized.\n\n            This seems complex.\n\n        Known solution from CodeForces: \n          We can use a different approach: \n\n          Let's define an array f of the entire grid? \n\n          We note that the answer is the sum over all pairs of adjacent cells (in the desired grid) that are different? \n\n          Actually, the awesomeness of a subsegment is the number of blocks. The problem asks for the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments? \n\n          But wait: the problem we are solving is different! \n\n          We are given two grids and we want the minimal number of adjacent swaps to transform one to the other. \n\n          However, the problem statement: \n            \"After each query print the sum of awesomeness values among all subsegments of array a\"\n\n          But wait, the problem we are solving is not the same as the one described in the example? \n\n          Let me reread the problem: \n\n          \"Stanley has decided to buy ... the minimal possible number of operations in which she can get the desired arrangement.\"\n\n          But then the input specification: \n            n, m, then the initial array (two lines), then m queries (each query: i, x) meaning update the i-th element of the array a to x.\n\n          And after each query, we must print the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments.\n\n          This is a completely different problem! \n\n          I think I mixed up two problems. \n\n          The problem we are to solve is: \n            We have an array a (which is 2 x n) and we are going to update it in m queries. After each query, we want:\n                sum_{l=1}^{n} sum_{r=l}^{n} g(l, r)\n            where g(l, r) is the awesomeness of the contiguous subsegment from l to r (which is a contiguous segment in the first row and the same contiguous segment in the second row? Actually, the problem says: \"b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\" but a is 2xn? \n\n          Let me read the example: \n            After the first query a is [1,2,2,4,5] -> but wait, the example input is: \n                \"5 2\n                 1 2 3 4 5\n                 1 1 1 1 1\n                 1 1\n                 1 1\"\n\n          This doesn't match. \n\n          Actually, the example in the note: \n            \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\n          But the input has two rows? \n\n          The problem says: \"the array a\" and then two lines. \n\n          And the example: \n            Input: \n                5 2\n                1 2 3 4 5\n                1 1 1 1 1\n                1 1\n                1 1\n\n          This means the initial grid is:\n                row0: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n                row1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n          Then the first query: i=1, x=1 -> change the first element to 1. So the grid becomes:\n                row0: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with the first element updated to 1 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (but it was 1 already) -> so no change? \n\n          Then the next query: i=1, x=1 -> again no change.\n\n          But the example says after the first query the array a is [1,2,2,4,5] -> wait, that doesn't match the input. \n\n          Let me read the sample input from the note: \n            \"In the first example the following sequence of swaps will suffice: ... and the answer is 29\"\n\n          And the sample input is: \n                6\n                1 0 0 1 0 0\n                0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n          So the grid is:\n                row0: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n                row1: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\n          and the desired grid is not given in the note? \n\n          The note only shows the current grid and then the awesomeness for every subsegment. \n\n          The problem has two parts: \n            Part 1: We are given the initial grid and then a desired grid, and we want the minimal number of swaps to transform the initial grid to the desired grid. -> this is the \"gift\" for Ibragim.\n            Part 2: But the online judge problem is: \n                   We are given n, m, then the initial grid (two rows), then m queries that update the grid, and after each query we must output the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments.\n\n          The two are different. \n\n          The online judge problem is: \n            We have a fixed grid (2 x n) that is updated, and we want after each update the value:\n                sum_{l=1}^{n} sum_{r=l}^{n} g(l, r)\n\n            where for a contiguous subsegment [l, r] (which is a contiguous segment in the grid, but note: the grid has two rows, so the subsegment [l, r] in the grid means the two rows from column l to r? \n            But the awesomeness is defined for a one-dimensional array. \n\n          How is the grid represented as a one-dimensional array? \n\n          The problem says: \"b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\" \n\n          This suggests that the grid is given as two rows, but the array a is not defined. \n\n          Actually, the input is: \n                n, m\n                a1, a2, ..., an   (first row)\n                b1, b2, ..., bn   (second row)\n\n          Then the array a in the problem is the concatenation of the two rows? \n\n          But the example: \n                [1,0,0,1,0,0] and [0,1,0,0,0,1] -> then the array a would be of length 12? \n\n          The contiguous subsegment [l, r] would be from index l to r in this concatenated array? \n\n          But the awesomeness is defined for a one-dimensional array. \n\n          However, the example then lists subsegments like [1;1] (which is [1]), [1;2] (which is [1,0] if we take the first row only? or [1,0] from the first row and then the second row is not included? \n\n          The example: \n            [1;1]: [1] -> from the first row first element.\n            [1;2]: [1] + [2] -> wait, the example says [1] and [2] -> so it's not the concatenated array.\n\n          The problem says: \"the array b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\" \n\n          This implies that the grid is not being treated as two rows? \n\n          Let me read the input specification: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n            \"The third line contains n integers ...\"\n\n          So the array a is the first row, and the second row is another array. \n\n          Then what is the contiguous subsegment [l, r]? \n            The problem says: \"b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\"\n\n          This suggests that it is only the first row? \n\n          But then why two rows? \n\n          The example: \n            \"the awesomen of an array [1, 1, 1] is 1\"\n\n          In the sample: \n            [1;1] in the first row: [1] -> awesomeness=1.\n            [1;2] in the first row: [1,0] -> awesomeness = 2.\n\n          But the example also has: \n            [2;3] in the first row: [0,0] -> awesomeness=1.\n\n          However, the example says: \n            [1;1]: [1] -> 1\n            [1;2]: [1,0] -> 2\n            [1;3]: [1,0,0] -> 2   (blocks: [1] and [0,0])\n            [1;4]: [1,0,0,1] -> 3\n            [1;5]: [1,0,0,1,0] -> 4\n            [2;2]: [0] -> 1\n            [2;3]: [0,0] -> 1\n            [2;4]: [0,0,1] -> 2\n            [2;5]: [0,0,1,0] -> 3\n            [3;3]: [0] -> 1\n            [3;4]: [0,1] -> 2\n            [3;5]: [0,1,0] -> 3\n            [4;4]: [1] -> 1\n            [4;5]: [1,0] -> 2\n            [5;5]: [0] -> 1\n\n          Sum = 1+2+2+3+4+1+1+2+3+1+2+3+1+2+1 = 29.\n\n          But the grid has two rows: \n                row0: [1,0,0,1,0,0]\n                row1: [0,1,0,0,0,1]\n\n          The problem says: \"the array a\" and then two lines. \n\n          And the contiguous subsegment [l, r] is taken from the first row only? \n\n          Then why is the second row provided? \n\n          The example input has two rows, but the awesomeness is computed only on the first row? \n\n          Let me read the problem statement again: \n            \"You are given an array a of length n\"\n\n          and then \"the i-th element of the array a\"\n\n          and the queries: \"a query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x\"\n\n          So the array a is one-dimensional! \n\n          But the input has two rows? \n\n          The sample input: \n                6\n                1 0 0 1 0 0\n                0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n          This is for n=6, and then two rows? \n\n          This is very confusing. \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n            \"The third line contains n integers\"\n\n          and then the queries. \n\n          But then the array a is the first row? and the second row is extra? \n\n          The problem says: \"Stanley has decided to buy a new desktop PC made by the company \"Monoblock\", and to solve captcha on their website, he needs to solve the following task.\"\n\n          and the task is: \n            \" the awesomeness of an array ... \"\n\n          and then \"You are given an array a of length n\"\n\n          So the array a is one-dimensional. \n\n          Therefore, the second row in the input is not used? \n\n          But the sample input has two rows, and the sample output is 29 for the first example. \n\n          Let me compute for the first row: [1,0,0,1,0,0] -> and we are to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments.\n\n          We did that above and got 29.\n\n          So the second row is not used? \n\n          Then why is it in the input? \n\n          The input specification: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n            \"The next two lines\" -> wait, it says: \n                \"The second line contains ...\"\n                \"The last two lines\" -> no, it says: \n                    \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n                    \"The next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries\"\n\n          But the sample input has after the first line (n, m) then two lines of n integers, and then m lines of queries.\n\n          The problem says: \n                \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries\"\n\n          So the first two lines after n and m are the array a and then another array? \n\n          But the array a is only one array. \n\n          I see the confusion: the problem says \"array a\", but then provides two arrays. \n\n          Re-read the input specification: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n            \"The third line contains n integers\"\n\n          and then the queries update \"the i-th element of the array a\"\n\n          So the array a is only the first row. The second row is not used? \n\n          But the sample input has two rows and the sample output is 29 for the first example, which is computed on the first row.\n\n          Therefore, the second row is not used. \n\n          Why then is it in the input? \n\n          Let me check the sample input in the note: \n                Input: \n                  5 2\n                  1 2 3 4 5\n                  1 1 1 1 1\n                  1 1\n                  1 1\n\n          This means: \n                n=5, m=2\n                array a = [1,2,3,4,5]\n                then a line of 5 integers: [1,1,1,1,1] -> what is this? \n\n          The problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n          and then \"The last two lines\" -> it says: \"the next m lines\", so the second line is the array a, and the third line is extra.\n\n          This is a mistake in the problem statement? \n\n          But the sample input has two rows. \n\n          I think the online judge might be feeding two rows, but the problem says array a is one-dimensional. \n\n          How to resolve? \n\n          Looking at the sample output: \n                After the first query: a = [1,2,2,4,5] -> and then the answer is 29.\n\n          How do we get [1,2,2,4,5]? \n                Initial a = [1,2,3,4,5]\n                Query: \"1 1\" -> update the 1st element to 1 -> so a becomes [1,2,3,4,5] (no change)\n                Then query: \"1 1\" -> again no change.\n\n          This does not yield [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n          Unless the second row is the array a? \n\n          If we take the second row as the array a: \n                Initial a = [1,1,1,1,1]\n                Query: \"1 1\" -> update the first element to 1 -> no change.\n                Query: \"1 1\" -> no change.\n\n          Not [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n          Unless the queries update both rows? \n\n          The problem says: \"a query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x\"\n\n          array a is one-dimensional.\n\n          But the sample input has two rows. \n\n          I think there is a misunderstanding. \n\n          Let me read the problem statement again: \n            \"You are given an array a of length n\"\n\n          and then the input has two rows. \n\n          And the sample output for the first example is 29, which is computed on the array [1,0,0,1,0,0] (which is the first row of the sample input).\n\n          Therefore, the array a is the first row. The second row is not used. \n\n          Then why does the sample input have two rows? \n\n          The sample input: \n                6\n                1 0 0 1 0 0\n                0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n          and then no queries? \n\n          The problem says: \"There are m queries\", but in the first example, m is not given. \n\n          The first example in the note does not mention queries. It only shows the grid and the awesomeness for every subsegment. \n\n          Then the second example: \n                \"In the second example no matter what swaps you do, you won't get the desired arrangement, so the answer is -1.\"\n\n          This suggests that the first part of the problem (before the queries) is to output the answer for the initial array, and then after each query update the array and output the answer.\n\n          But the problem says: \"after each query print the answer\"\n\n          So for the first example, if there are no queries, then we only output the answer for the initial array.\n\n          Therefore, for the sample input with n=6 and the array a = [1,0,0,1,0,0] (first row) and the second row is [0,1,0,0,0,1] (which is not used), we output 29.\n\n          So the second row is provided in the input but not used. \n\n          Why is it provided? \n\n          The problem might have been intended to use both rows, but the awesomeness is defined for a one-dimensional array. \n\n          I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n          But the sample input has two rows, and the sample output is 29 for the first example, which is computed on the first row.\n\n          Therefore, we can assume that the array a is the first row, and the second row is to be ignored? \n\n          However, the second example: \n                \"no matter what swaps you do, you won't get the desired arrangement\"\n\n          This suggests that the desired arrangement is given in the input? \n\n          The input specification does not mention the desired arrangement. \n\n          Let me read the input specification again: \n            \"The first line contains two integers n and m\"\n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n            \"The next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries\"\n\n          There is no desired arrangement in the input. \n\n          The only thing close to desired arrangement is the queries that update the array a.\n\n          Therefore, the online judge problem is: \n            We have an array a of length n, and we will have m updates. After each update, we want:\n                sum_{l=1}^{n} sum_{r=l}^{n} g(l, r)\n            where g(l, r) = the awesomeness of the subarray a[l..r] (which is the number of contiguous blocks of identical numbers).\n\n          And the sample: \n                n=6, a = [1,0,0,1,0,0] -> answer=29.\n\n          So the second row in the input is not used. \n\n          Why is it there? \n\n          The sample input has two rows, but the problem says only one array a. \n\n          I think the online judge might be feeding two rows for a different problem. \n\n          But the sample input for the first example has two rows, and the sample output is 29, which is for the first row.\n\n          Therefore, we will read the first row as the array a, and ignore the second row.\n\n          However, the sample input for the second example might be different. \n\n          The second example: \n                \"In the second example no matter what swaps you do, you won't get the desired arrangement, so the answer is -1.\"\n\n          This suggests that the answer for the second example is -1. \n\n          How to get -1? \n\n          The only condition to output -1 is if it's impossible to achieve the desired arrangement? \n\n          But in this problem, there is no desired arrangement. We are only updating the array and after each update we are computing a function on the array.\n\n          Therefore, the online judge problem does not output -1. \n\n          This is very confusing. \n\n          I think the problem statement has mixed two problems. \n\n          The intended online judge problem is: \n            We have an array a of length n, and m updates. After each update, compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments.\n\n          And the sample input: \n                6\n                1 0 0 1 0 0\n                0 1 0 0 0 1   # this line is not used\n                ... queries\n\n          But the sample input has two rows, and the first example has no queries, so we output 29.\n\n          Then the queries update the array a (the first row) and we update the answer.\n\n          Therefore, we can ignore the second row.\n\n          How to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments for an array a of length n? \n\n          The awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is the number of contiguous blocks of identical numbers. \n\n          For example, for [1,0,0,1,0,0] (n=6), we have 15 subarrays. We computed manually and got 29.\n\n          How to compute it efficiently and support updates? \n\n          We note that the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] = 1 + (number of indices i from l+1 to r such that a[i] != a[i-1]).\n\n          Therefore, \n             g(l, r) = 1 + sum_{i=l+1}^{r} [a_i != a_{i-1}]\n\n          Then the total sum = \n             sum_{l=1}^{n} sum_{r=l}^{n} 1 + sum_{l=1}^{n} sum_{r=l}^{n} sum_{i=l+1}^{r} [a_i != a_{i-1}]\n\n          = (number of subarrays) + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [a_i != a_{i-1}] * (number of subarrays that include the adjacent pair (i-1, i))\n\n          The number of subarrays is n*(n+1)/2.\n\n          For a fixed adjacent pair (i, i+1) (0-indexed), the number of subarrays that include this adjacent pair is: \n             the subarray must start at <= i and end at >= i+1.\n             start: from 0 to i (i+1 choices)\n             end: from i+1 to n-1 (n-i-1 choices)\n             so total = (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n          Therefore, \n             total = n*(n+1)//2 + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [a[i] != a[i+1]] * ((i+1) * (n-i-1))\n\n          But wait, let's test with n=2: \n             subarrays: [0], [1], [0,1]\n             awesomeness: 1, 1, and for [0,1]: if a0!=a1 then 2, else 1.\n             total = 1+1+ (2 if a0!=a1 else 1) = either 4 or 3.\n\n          Our formula: \n             n*(n+1)//2 = 3.\n             then for i=0: if a0!=a1, then add 1 * (1 * (2-0-1)) = 1*1 = 1 -> total=4, which is correct.\n             if a0==a1, then add 0 -> total=3, which is correct.\n\n          Therefore, the formula is:\n             ans = n*(n+1)//2 + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} f(i) * ((i+1) * (n-i-1))\n             where f(i) = 1 if a[i] != a[i+1], else 0.\n\n          Now, we have to support m updates. \n\n          When we update one element at position i, it can affect:\n             the adjacent pairs: (i-1, i) and (i, i+1)\n\n          So we can maintain:\n             total = base + extra, where base = n*(n+1)//2, and extra = sum_{i} f(i) * w(i), with w(i) = (i+1)*(n-i-1).\n\n          We precompute w(i) for i in [0, n-2].\n\n          Initially, we can compute extra by iterating over i.\n\n          Then, when updating position i (0-indexed), we will:\n             For each adjacent pair that involves i: \n                - the pair (i-1, i): index = i-1\n                - the pair (i, i+1): index = i\n\n             We will subtract the current contribution of these two pairs (if they exist) from extra.\n             Then update a[i] = x.\n             Then add the new contribution of these two pairs.\n\n          And then output: base + extra.\n\n          But note: if i==0, then only the pair (0,1) is affected.\n          if i==n-1, then only the pair (n-2, n-1) is affected.\n\n          However, we must also consider that the update might change the element at position i, which is part of the adjacent pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1).\n\n          Example: \n             n=3, a = [1,2,3] \n             base = 3*4//2 = 6.\n             extra = \n                 i=0: a0!=a1 -> 1, w(0)=1*(3-0-1)=1*2=2 -> 2\n                 i=1: a1!=a2 -> 1, w(1)=2*(3-1-1)=2*1=2 -> 2\n                 extra = 4, total=10.\n\n             Manually: \n                 [0]:1, [1]:1, [2]:1, [0,1]:2, [1,2]:2, [0,1,2]:3 -> total=1+1+1+2+2+3=10.\n\n          Update: set a[1] = 2 -> then a = [1,2,3] -> no change, so extra remains 4.\n\n          Update: set a[1] = 1 -> then a = [1,1,3]\n             pairs: \n                 (0,1): 1==1 -> 0\n                 (1,2): 1!=3 -> 1\n             extra = 0 * w(0) + 1 * w(1) = 0 + 2 = 2.\n             total = 6+2 = 8.\n\n          Manually:\n             [0]:1, [1]:1, [2]:1, [0,1]:1, [1,2]:2, [0,1,2]:2 -> 1+1+1+1+2+2=8.\n\n          Therefore, the plan is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            # ignore the next line\n            input()  # the second row, we don't use it\n\n            # Precompute base = n*(n+1)//2\n            base = n*(n+1)//2\n\n            # Precompute w[i] for i in range(n-1): w[i] = (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n            w = [0] * (n)\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                w[i] = (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n            # Build an array f of length n-1: f[i] = 1 if a[i]!=a[i+1] else 0\n            f = [0] * (n-1)\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                    f[i] = 1\n\n            # extra = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} f[i] * w[i]\n            extra = 0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                extra += f[i] * w[i]\n\n            # We'll maintain the array a and the array f (for the adjacent pairs) and extra.\n\n            # For each query:\n            #   i, x: update the element at position i (1-indexed) to x.\n            #   Convert i to 0-indexed: pos = i-1.\n\n            #   Steps for update at pos:\n            #     1.

\n\n          We must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\n          Let me recast the formula:\n\n             g(l, r) = 1 + (# of indices i in [l+1, r] such that a[i]!=a[i-1])\n\n             Sum_{l, r} g(l, r) = \n                 = sum_{l, r} 1   [which is base = n*(n+1)//2] \n                   + sum_{l, r} [number of indices i in [l+1, r] such that a[i]!=a[i-1]]\n\n             = base + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [a[i]!=a[i-1]] * (number of subarrays that include the segment [i-1, i])\n\n             The segment [i-1, i] is included in a subarray [l, r] if and only if l<=i-1 and r>=i.\n                 l in [0, i-1] (i choices) and r in [i, n-1] (n-i choices) -> total = i * (n-i)\n\n          But note: in 0-indexed, the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is at positions i-1 and i.\n\n          In our example: n=6, \n             i=0: pair (0,1): included in subarrays: l in [0,0] (1 choice) and r in [1,5] (5 choices) -> 1*5 = 5.\n             i=1: pair (1,2): included in l in [0,1] (2 choices) and r in [2,5] (4 choices) -> 2*4=8.\n             i=2: pair (2,3): 3*3=9.\n             i=3: pair (3,4): 4*2=8.\n             i=4: pair (4,5): 5*1=5.\n\n          So the formula for the extra part is: \n             extra = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} [a[i]!=a[i+1]] * ( (i+1) * (n-i-1) )   [because the pair (i, i+1) is at index i in the f array, and the number of subarrays that include it is (i+1) * (n-i-1) ?]\n\n          But note: \n             for the pair at index i (0-indexed, between a[i] and a[i+1]), the number of subarrays that include it is:\n                 l can be from 0 to i -> (i+1) choices\n                 r can be from i+1 to n-1 -> (n-i-1) choices\n                 so (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\n          And we computed 5+8+9+8+5 = 35, then base=21, total=56, which is not 29.\n\n          What is the mistake?\n\n          Let me compute manually for the subarray [0,1] (l=0, r=1): \n             g(0,1) = 1 + (if a0!=a1 then 1 else 0) = 1+1 = 2.\n\n          In our formula, the pair (0,1) is counted in the extra part: 1 * 5 = 5, but the subarray [0,1] is only one subarray that contains the pair (0,1) and it should contribute 1 to the extra part? \n\n          But our count for the pair (0,1) is 5 subarrays: \n             [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [0,4], [0,5] -> 5 subarrays.\n\n          And each of these subarrays has the pair (0,1) and it is a change, so each of these subarrays gets an extra 1 from this pair.\n\n          But the awesomeness for [0,1] is 2, which is 1 (base) + 1 (for the change at (0,1)).\n          For [0,2]: the awesomeness = 1 (base) + (changes at (0,1) and (1,2)) = 1 + 2 = 3? \n          But wait, the array [0,2] is [1,0,0] -> changes: (1->0) and (0->0) -> only one change? \n          Actually, the awesomeness is defined as the number of contiguous blocks. \n             [1,0,0] has blocks: [1], [0,0] -> 2 blocks.\n\n          So g(0,2)=2.\n\n          How many changes? \n             change at (0,1): 1->0 -> change, and (1,2): 0->0 -> no change.\n          So only one change.\n\n          Therefore, the formula: \n             g(l, r) = 1 + (# of changes in the subarray) \n          is not correct.\n\n          The number of blocks = 1 + (number of indices i in [l+1, r] such that a[i] != a[i-1])\n\n          In [1,0,0]: \n             blocks: [1] and [0,0] -> 2 blocks.\n             changes: only at (0,1): 1->0 -> one change -> 1+1=2, which is correct.\n\n          In [0,2]: the subarray is [1,0,0] -> changes: at index0: 1->0 (which is the only change) -> 1+1=2.\n\n          But then for [0,5]: the entire array [1,0,0,1,0,0] \n             changes: \n                0: 1->0 -> change\n                1: 0->0 -> no\n                2: 0->1 -> change\n                3: 1->0 -> change\n                4: 0->0 -> no\n             so 3 changes -> 1+3=4.\n\n          And the example says [1,0,0,1,0,0] has awesomeness 4.\n\n          So the formula is correct.\n\n          Then why for n=6, a=[1,0,0,1,0,0] we have extra = 5+0+9+8+0 = 22? \n             i0: 1->0: change -> 5\n             i1: 0->0: no -> 0\n             i2: 0->1: change -> 9\n             i3: 1->0: change -> 8\n             i4: 0->0: no -> 0\n             total extra = 5+9+8 = 22.\n\n          Then total = base (21) + extra (22) = 43.\n\n          But the example says 29.\n\n          What is the manual sum?

\n\n          The problem note says: \n                6\n                1 0 0 1 0 0\n                0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n          and then it lists the subsegments for the array [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          The example in the note for the awesomeness of the subsegments is for the array [1,2,2,4,5] (which is of length 5) and the answer is 29.\n\n          But the input has n=6 and two rows.\n\n          I think the example in the note is for a different instance.\n\n          The first example in the note says: \n                \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\n          and then it lists the subsegments.\n\n          So the array is [1,2,2,4,5] (length=5).\n\n          Let's compute for [1,2,2,4,5]:\n             base = 5*6//2 = 15.\n             w = [1*(5-1-1)=1*3=3, 2*2=4, 3*1=3, 4*0?

\n\n          The problem says: \n                \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n                \"The next two lines\" -> it says \"the next m lines\", so for the first example, m=0, so only two lines: the first row and then the second row? \n\n          But the array a is only the first row. \n\n          Therefore, for the first example, we would read:\n                n=5, m=0? \n                then the next line: \"1 2 2 4 5\"\n                then the next line: ... but m=0, so we are done.\n\n          But the sample input has two rows even for the first example? \n\n          The sample input in the note has two rows: \n                1 0 0 1 0 0\n                0 1 0 0 0 1\n\n          and then no queries, and the answer is 29.\n\n          This is for n=6, not n=5.\n\n          I see the example in the note for the awesomeness calculation is for the array [1,2,2,4,5] (n=5) and the answer is 29, but the sample input has n=6 and a different array.\n\n          The problem note says: \n                \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\n          so the array at that point is [1,2,2,4,5] (n=5), and then they say \"and the answer is 29\".\n\n          Then they show the calculation for every subsegment of [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n          Therefore, the sample input for the first example is not the one with two rows of 6 elements.\n\n          The online judge will provide: \n                first line: n, m\n                second line: the array a of n integers\n                then if m>0, the next m lines are queries.\n\n          But the sample input in the problem note for the first example has two rows of n=6, and then queries? \n\n          I think the problem note has two different examples.\n\n          The first example: \n                Input: \n                  5 2\n                  1 2 3 4 5\n                  1 1 1 1 1\n                  1 1\n                  1 1\n\n                After the first query, a = [1,2,2,4,5] -> so the first query is: i=3, x=2? \n                Because initially a = [1,2,3,4,5], then update the third element to 2: a[2]=2 -> [1,2,2,4,5].\n\n                Then the answer after the first query is 29.\n\n                Then the next query: i=1, x=1 -> update a[0] to 1 (which is already 1) -> no change, then output 29 again.\n\n          Therefore, the online judge input for the first example has m=2, and two queries.\n\n          So we read:\n                n=5, m=2\n                a = [1,2,3,4,5]   (first line after n,m)\n                then the next line: [1,1,1,1,1] -> but we don't use it.\n\n          Then the first query: \"1 1\" -> update a[0] to 1 -> no change.\n          Then the second query: we don't know, but then the example says after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5] -> so the first query must be updating the third element to 2.\n\n          The query format: \"i x\" -> the i-th element.\n\n          The first query: \"3 2\" -> update the third element to 2.\n\n          So the input is:\n                5 2\n                1 2 3 4 5\n                1 1 1 1 1   # this line is not used\n                3 2\n                1 1\n\n          We ignore the second row.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n            import sys\n\n            data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            if not data:\n                exit(0)\n\n            n = int(data[0])\n            m = int(data[1])\n            a = list(map(int, data[2:2+n]))\n            # next n integers are the second row, we skip\n            index = 2+n\n            # next n integers: we skip\n            index += n\n\n            # Precompute base = n*(n+1)//2\n            base = n*(n+1)//2\n\n            # Precompute w: for i in range(n-1): w[i] = (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n            w = [0] * (n)  # we only use indices 0 to n-2\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                w[i] = (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n            # Build the initial f array for adjacent pairs: length n-1\n            f = [0] * (n-1)\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                if a[i] != a[i+1]:\n                    f[i] = 1\n\n            extra = 0\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                extra += f[i] * w[i]\n\n            # We have m queries, each query is two integers: i and x\n            #   They are at data[index: index+2*m]\n            queries = list(map(int, data[index:index+2*m]))\n            index = 0\n            # We'll maintain the array a\n            out_lines = []\n            for i in range(m):\n                pos = queries[index] - 1  # 0-indexed position\n                x = queries[index+1]\n                index += 2\n\n                # Update the left neighbor pair (pos-1, pos) if exists\n                if pos > 0:\n                    # the pair at index = pos-1 (between pos-1 and pos)\n                    j = pos-1\n                    extra -= f[j] * w[j]\n                    # update f[j]: now a[j] is the current value (not updated yet) and the new value at pos is x\n                    if a[j] != x:\n                        f[j] = 1\n                    else:\n                        f[j] = 0\n                    extra += f[j] * w[j]\n\n                # Update the right neighbor pair (pos, pos+1) if exists\n                if pos < n-1:\n                    j = pos\n                    extra -= f[j] * w[j]\n                    if x != a[pos+1]:\n                        f[j] = 1\n                    else:\n                        f[j] = 0\n                    extra += f[j] * w[j]\n\n                a[pos] = x\n                total = base + extra\n                out_lines.append(str(total))\n\n            # Output each result on a new line.\n            print(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\n          Let's test with the first example update: \n                n=5, m=2, a = [1,2,3,4,5]\n                base = 15\n                w = [ (1)*(5-1)=4, (2)*(5-2)=6, (3)*(5-3)=6, (4)*(5-4)=4]\n                f = [ \n                  1 (1!=2) -> 1, \n                  1 (2!=3) -> 1, \n                  1 (3!=4) -> 1, \n                  1 (4!=5) -> 1\n                ]\n                extra = 4+6+6+4 = 20\n                total = 15+20 = 35.\n\n                Query1: \"3 2\" -> pos=2 (0-indexed), x=2.\n                  a = [1,2,3,4,5] -> update a[2] to 2 -> becomes [1,2,2,4,5]\n\n                  Left neighbor: pos=2>0 -> j=1 (the pair between index1 and index2)\n                      extra: subtract f[1]*w[1] = 1*6 = 6 -> extra=14\n                      update f[1]: a[1] is 2, new a[2] is 2 -> 2==2 -> f[1]=0\n                      add 0 -> extra=14.\n                  Right neighbor: pos=2<4 -> j"
