    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given the following incomplete code:\n\nf=open(0)\nR=lambda:map(int,next(f).split())\nn,q=R();p=[0]\nfor w in sorted(R()): # TODO: Your code here\nfor _ in \" \"*q: x, y=R();print(p[n-x+y]-p[n-x])\n\nWe note that the problem requires processing up to 200,000 items and queries. The idea is to use a prefix sum array to quickly compute the sum of a contiguous segment of the sorted array.\n\nThe current code reads n and q, then initializes p as [0]. Then it sorts the list of prices. However, the loop that iterates over the sorted prices is incomplete. We need to build the prefix sum array.\n\nThe sorted prices are in increasing order. The problem states that if a customer buys at least x items, then the y cheapest of them are free. But note: the customer can choose which items to buy. To maximize the free value, the customer would want the free items to be as expensive as possible. However, the free items are the y cheapest among the purchased ones. Therefore, the strategy is to buy a set of items that includes as many expensive items as possible, but note that the free items are the cheapest ones in the purchase.\n\nActually, the trick is: the customer can choose which items to buy. To maximize the free value, we want the free items (which are the y cheapest in the purchase) to be as expensive as possible. How? We can choose to buy exactly x items. Then the free items are the y cheapest of those x. To maximize the free value, we want the y cheapest in the purchase to be as expensive as possible. But note: if we include too many cheap items, then the free items (which are the cheapest) will be cheap. So the best is to take the x items that are the most expensive. Why? Because then the cheapest items in that set will be the ones that are as expensive as possible.\n\nExample: [1,2,3,5,5] (sorted in increasing order). For x=3, y=2: we take the three most expensive: [3,5,5]. Then the two cheapest in that set are 3 and 5 -> free value 8.\n\nBut if we take [5,5,3] (which are the three most expensive) then the two cheapest are 3 and 5? Actually, the set is the same as [3,5,5] when sorted. So the free items are the two smallest in the set: 3 and 5.\n\nSo the plan:\n1. Sort the prices in increasing order. Then the most expensive items are at the end.\n2. We want to quickly compute the sum of the y items that are the cheapest in the set of x most expensive. But note: the set of x most expensive is the last x items in the sorted array. Then the cheapest y items in that set are the first y items of that segment? Actually, the segment of the last x items is from index n-x to n-1. But when we take the last x items, the smallest in that segment are the first few of that segment? Actually, the segment of the last x items is sorted in increasing order? The entire array is sorted. So the segment from n-x to n-1 is sorted in increasing order. Therefore, the cheapest y items in that segment are the first y items of that segment.\n\nBut note: the prefix sum array p is built for the entire sorted array. We have to build the prefix sum array so that we can quickly compute the sum of the first k items? Actually, we need the sum of the segment from index a to b.\n\nHowever, the current code prints: p[n-x+y] - p[n-x]\n\nLet me see: \np is the prefix sum array, so p[i] = sum of prices from index 0 to i-1? Or 0-indexed?\n\nThe current code initializes p=[0]. Then we are going to iterate over the sorted prices. We need to build the prefix sum array.\n\nThe sorted array: let's call it a[0..n-1] (in increasing order). Then the last x items are a[n-x] to a[n-1]. The cheapest y items in that segment are a[n-x] to a[n-x+y-1]. The sum of these y items is: \n   sum = (prefix[n-x+y] - prefix[n-x])\n\nBut note: the prefix array is usually built so that:\n   p[0] = 0\n   p[1] = a[0]\n   p[2] = a[0]+a[1]\n   ...\n   p[i] = a[0]+...+a[i-1]\n\nSo the sum of a[L] to a[R] is p[R+1] - p[L].\n\nTherefore, the segment from index L = n-x to index R = n-x+y-1 (inclusive) has:\n   L = n-x, R = n-x+y-1\n   Then the sum = p[R+1] - p[L] = p[n-x+y] - p[n-x]\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nBut we must build the prefix sum array for the entire sorted array.\n\nThe current code has:\n   p = [0]\n   for w in sorted(R()): \n        # we need to append to p: the next prefix sum = last element of p + w\n\nSo we can do:\n   p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\nBut note: the sorted array is in increasing order. The prefix array p will then have length n+1: indices 0..n.\n\nSo the missing code in the loop is: \n   p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\nBut note: the sorted(R()) returns the sorted list of prices. We are iterating over each price w in that sorted list.\n\nTherefore, the completed loop:\n\n   for w in sorted(R()):\n        p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\nHowever, note: the initial p is [0]. Then we append the cumulative sums.\n\nBut wait: the problem says the input prices are in an unsorted list. We sort them and then build the prefix sum.\n\nBut note: the example: \n   Input: n=5, q=3, prices = [1,2,3,5,5]\n   Then sorted: [1,2,3,5,5]\n   p = [0, 1, 3, 6, 11, 16]\n\nThen for a query (x=3, y=2): \n   n-x = 5-3 = 2, n-x+y = 2+2=4\n   p[4] = 11, p[2] = 3 -> 11-3 = 8 -> correct.\n\nAnother query (x=2, y=1): \n   n-x = 3, n-x+y=4 -> p[4]-p[3] = 11-6 = 5 -> correct.\n\nAnother query (x=5, y=3): \n   n-x=0, n-x+y=3 -> p[3]-p[0]=6-0=6 -> correct.\n\nSo the code for program1.py is:\n\nf=open(0)\nR=lambda:map(int,next(f).split())\nn,q=R();p=[0]\nprices = sorted(R())\nfor w in prices:\n    p.append(p[-1] + w)\nfor _ in range(q):   # Note: the original code uses for _ in \" \"*q: ... which is the same as for _ in range(q)\n    x, y = R()\n    print(p[n-x+y] - p[n-x])\n\nBut note: the original code uses for _ in \" \"*q: ... which is a common trick to loop q times. We can leave that.\n\nHowever, the problem says: Output only the missing code. The missing code is the loop that builds the prefix array.\n\nBut note: the original code has:\n   for w in sorted(R()): # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must complete that for loop. The rest is already there.\n\nSo the missing part for program1.py is the body of that for loop. We can write:\n   p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\nBut note: the variable w is the current element from the sorted list.\n\nTherefore, the completion for program1.py is:\n   p.append(p[-1] + w)\n\nBut note: the original code has a for loop without a body. We must write the body.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the missing lines or blocks. So we must write the entire block? Actually, the for loop is already started. We just need to write the body.\n\nBut note: the next line is a for loop for the queries. We must be careful: the indentation.\n\nThe original code:\n\nfor w in sorted(R()): # TODO: Your code here\nfor _ in \" \"*q: x, y=R();print(p[n-x+y]-p[n-x])\n\nThis is invalid because after the first for loop there is no body. We must fix the indentation? Actually, the problem says the code is given as is. We are to fill the missing part.\n\nWe see that the first for loop has no body. Then the next for loop is at the same indentation level. That would be a syntax error.\n\nTherefore, we must complete the first for loop with a body. Then the next for loop is at the same level as the first for loop.\n\nSo the corrected program1.py should be:\n\nf=open(0)\nR=lambda:map(int,next(f).split())\nn,q=R();p=[0]\nfor w in sorted(R()): \n    p.append(p[-1] + w)   # this is the missing line\nfor _ in \" \"*q: \n    x, y=R()\n    print(p[n-x+y]-p[n-x])\n\nBut note: the original code for the query loop is written in one line. We can leave it.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is the line: \"    p.append(p[-1] + w)\".\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" and in the format: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nFor program1.py, the missing part is the body of the for loop. We write the line: \"    p.append(p[-1] + w)\".\n\nBut note: the indentation is 4 spaces? The original code uses spaces. We'll use 4 spaces per level.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe incomplete code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\\n')[1:]\n    r = []\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    return r\nprint(*main(), sep='\\n')\n\nWe have to process t test cases. The first line is t, and then t lines of six-digit strings.\n\nFor each test case string i (which is a string of six digits), we need to check if the sum of the first three digits equals the sum of the last three digits.\n\nWe can do:\n   first_sum = int(i[0]) + int(i[1]) + int(i[2])\n   last_sum = int(i[3]) + int(i[4]) + int(i[5])\n   if first_sum == last_sum:\n        r.append(\"YES\")\n   else:\n        r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says we can output in any case, but the example outputs are in uppercase. We'll output \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nWe can write:\n\n   r.append(\"YES\" if first_sum == last_sum else \"NO\")\n\nSo the missing code for the for loop in program2.py is:\n\n        a = i.strip()   # though the input is six digits, but just in case? The problem says one string of six digits per test.\n        # Actually, the split by '\\n' and then each i is a string of six digits? But the problem says: one string of six digits per test.\n        # However, the example input: \n        #   3\n        #   213132\n        #   973894\n        #   045207\n        # So each i is a string of six digits. We don't need to strip? But it's good to be safe.\n        # Alternatively, we can do:\n        #   if len(i) == 0: continue   # but the problem says t test cases, so there should be t lines.\n        # We'll assume each i is a string of six digits.\n\n        # So:\n        s1 = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\n        s2 = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\n        if s1 == s2:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut we can do it in one line:\n\n        r.append(\"YES\" if sum(int(d) for d in i[:3]) == sum(int(d) for d in i[3:]) else \"NO\")\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n        if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:6])):\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the string has six digits, so we can safely take i[3:6] or just i[3:].\n\nWe'll write:\n\n        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is the body of the for loop:\n\n        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\n\nBut note: the variable i is the string of six digits.\n\nTherefore, the completion for program2.py is: \n        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\n\nNow, we output the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n    \"program2\": \"        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 part: the line must be exactly as it would appear in the program. The for loop is already started, so we only write the body line.\n\nHowever, the program1 code has a for loop that is incomplete. We are providing the body of that for loop.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, we are providing the body of the for loop that iterates over the test cases.\n\nBut note: the program2 code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and then the next line is \"return r\". We must replace the TODO comment with the code? Actually, we are to fill the missing block. The missing block is the entire body of the for loop for the test cases.\n\nBut the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". In program2, the missing part is the block that processes one test case.\n\nWe write the line: \"        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\"\n\nBut note: the indentation. The for loop is at the same level as the rest of the function. The body of the for loop must be indented one more level (which is 8 spaces, but we use 4 per level so 8 spaces). However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but the original code uses 4 spaces. We'll use 4 spaces for each level.\n\nIn the given program2.py, the for loop is:\n\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO line with the code. We write the code at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\nSo the line we write is: \"        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\"\n\nBut note: the original code has 8 spaces at the beginning of the line? Actually, the function main is indented by 4, then the for loop is indented by 8, and the body of the for loop should be indented by 12. However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the code that replaces the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without the extra spaces? But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nWe'll output the exact line that should be in the program.\n\nIn the program, the line should be at the same indentation level as the comment. The comment is at 8 spaces (if the function is 4 and the for loop is 8, then the body is 12). But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the original code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo the line for program2 should be indented by 8 more spaces? Actually, no: the function body is indented by 4, then the for loop is indented by 4 (relative to the function) and the body of the for loop is indented by 8 relative to the function start? \n\nBut the problem says: the code is given as:\n\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the TODO line is at 8 spaces (if the function is 4, then the for is 8, and the body is 12). But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, we can assume that the body of the for loop must be at the same level as the comment.\n\nTherefore, we write the line with the same indentation as the comment: 8 spaces from the function definition? Actually, the function definition is at 0, then the function body is indented 4, then the for loop is indented 4 more (so 8 total), then the body of the for loop is indented 4 more (so 12 total). But the comment is at 12? \n\nLooking at the code:\n\ndef main():\n    s = ...   # 4 spaces\n    r = []    # 4 spaces\n    for i in s:   # 4 spaces\n        # TODO: ...   # 8 spaces\n\nSo the body of the for loop must be at 8 spaces (relative to the function start) or 4 more than the for? Actually, in Python, the body of a loop is indented one more level. The standard is 4 spaces per level.\n\nTherefore, the line we write for program2 must be indented by 8 spaces (from the left margin) or 4 more than the for? \n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. We are to output the line that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at 8 spaces. We write the same line at 8 spaces? Actually, the problem does not require the exact spaces? But we must write the code that can be inserted.\n\nWe'll write the line with 8 spaces at the beginning? But the problem does not specify. However, the original code uses 4 spaces per indent. So:\n\nThe function main: 4 spaces for the body.\nThe for loop: 8 spaces for the body.\n\nSo the line for program2 should be:\n\n        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\n\nThat is: 8 spaces (two levels of 4) at the beginning.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the string that is exactly the line of code.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n    \"program2\": \"        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\"\n}\n\nBut wait: in program1, the for loop body is at one level of indentation (4 spaces). So we write \"    \" (4 spaces) and then the code.\n\nIn program2, the for loop body is at two levels (8 spaces). So we write \"        \" (8 spaces) and then the code.\n\nAlternatively, we can write without specifying the exact spaces? But the problem says the code is given and we are to complete it. The original code uses the same indentation.\n\nWe'll output as above.\n\nBut note: the program1 code has the for loop without a body. We are adding one line of body. The body must be indented. The original for loop is at the same level as the previous lines. The body should be one level deeper. The previous lines are at 0 indentation? Actually, the code:\n\nf=open(0)\nR=lambda:map(int,next(f).split())\nn,q=R();p=[0]\nfor w in sorted(R()): # ... \n    ...   # this should be indented\n\nSo the body of the for loop in program1 should be indented by 4 spaces. Therefore, we write: \"    p.append(p[-1] + w)\" (with 4 spaces at the beginning).\n\nSimilarly, in program2, the for loop body is at 8 spaces (because the function body is 4, and the for loop body is 4 more). So we write 8 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces? However, the example code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    p.append(p[-1] + w)\",\n    \"program2\": \"        r.append('YES' if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])) else 'NO')\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 line uses single quotes. We can use double quotes? The problem does not specify. But the original code uses single quotes in the print? Actually, the original code doesn't have any quotes. We can use either. We'll use single quotes as in the example.\n\nAlternatively, we can use double quotes to be consistent with JSON? But the value is a string. We must escape if necessary.\n\nIn the program2 line, we have single quotes. We can write it as is in the JSON string, because the JSON string is in double quotes.\n\nSo the final answer."
