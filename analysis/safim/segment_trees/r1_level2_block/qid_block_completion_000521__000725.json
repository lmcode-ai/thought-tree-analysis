So in the output, we write:\n\n  \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut that is not correct: we want the JSON to contain the escape sequence for newline, which is \\n, meaning one backslash and an n. But when we write the string in the JSON, we write the two characters: backslash and n to represent a newline. So the actual text for the program2 value is:\n\n  \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut to represent this in JSON, we must escape the newlines as \\n. So the JSON string will have:\n\n  \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut wait: this is confusing. Let me clarify: The string we want for program2 is (without the quotes):\n      rating = int(n)\n      if rating >= 1900:\n          print('Division 1')\n      ... etc. This string has newlines.",

For example, the output might be:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\n  But this is shown with the escape sequences. So in our answer, we output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\n  This is not what we want. The correct way is to use the following for the program2 string in the JSON:\n\n      \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  and then when we serialize to JSON, the newlines will be escaped as \\n. But since we are not using a JSON serializer, we must do it manually. We output the following string for program2 in the JSON:\n\n      \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  and then in the overall JSON, we escape any double quotes and newlines. But the only special characters in the program2 string are the newlines.",

But the problem says output the missing code as a string in JSON. We'll do:\n\n  \"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\",\n  \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nBut note: the indentation for the if-elif-else: the entire block is the body of the for-loop, so we indent by 4 spaces. Then the if, elif, else are at the same level as the assignment to r? Then we indent the print by 4 more? That would be 8 spaces. But that is acceptable. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n  \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut the problem says the output must be exactly \"Division X\", and the example uses double quotes.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are reading n and q, then a list of n prices.\nWe sort the prices in descending order and then build a prefix sum array 'a' such that a[i] is the sum of the first i items (which are the most expensive i items because we sorted in descending order).\n\nHowever, note that the problem requires: for a query (x, y), the customer must purchase at least x items and then the y cheapest of those purchased are free. The strategy is to buy exactly x items (because buying more might not help since we can only get y free and we want the maximum free value) and then the free items are the y cheapest in that set. To maximize the free value, we want the set of x items to have the largest possible y cheapest items. This is equivalent to: we take the x items that are the most expensive (so that the cheapest y among them are as large as possible). But note: the free items are the cheapest in the set. So if we take the top x most expensive items, then the cheapest y in that set are the last y of the sorted (in ascending order) of these x. However, we sorted in descending order.\n\nAlternatively, we can sort the entire list in ascending order. Then the free items would be the first y of the selected set? But note: we want the maximum free value. Actually, we want the set of x items that has the largest possible y smallest items. This is achieved by taking the largest x items (so that the smallest among them are as large as possible). \n\nSo let's sort the prices in ascending order: then the largest x items are the last x. The y smallest in that set are the first y of the last x? Actually, no: in ascending order, the last x items are the largest. The smallest y in the last x would be the first y of the last x? But that is not contiguous. Actually, the last x items in ascending order are [a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}] and we take the last x: [a_{n-x}, a_{n-x+1}, ..., a_{n-1}]. The smallest y in this set are the first y of this contiguous block? Actually, yes: because the block is sorted in ascending order. So the smallest y are a_{n-x} to a_{n-x+y-1}. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"y cheapest\" meaning the smallest ones. So the free value is the sum of the y smallest in the set. However, we want the maximum free value. And we are forced to take at least x items. We can choose any x items? Then the best is to take the x largest items. Then the y smallest in that set are the smallest y of the largest x. \n\nSo we can do:\n  sort the array in ascending order: p[0] <= p[1] <= ... <= p[n-1]\n  Then the set of x items we choose is the last x: p[n-x] to p[n-1].\n  The y smallest in that set are the first y of that segment: p[n-x] to p[n-x+y-1].\n\nBut note: the problem says \"at least x\", so we could take more? However, if we take more than x, then we are adding cheaper items? Actually, we can only get y free. So if we take more than x, then the set of free items would be the y cheapest in the entire purchase. If we add an item that is cheaper than the ones we have, then that cheaper item would be included in the free set, which might reduce the free value (because we are replacing a more expensive one that was in the free set by a cheaper one). Therefore, it is optimal to take exactly x items.\n\nSo the free value for a query (x,y) is the sum of the segment p[n-x] to p[n-x+y-1]? Actually, no: because the segment from n-x to n-x+y-1 is the smallest y in the set of the largest x. But note: the set of the largest x is the last x in the ascending sorted array. The smallest y in that set are the first y of that segment? Actually, yes.\n\nBut wait: in ascending order, the last x are the largest. The smallest in that set is the first element of that segment (which is p[n-x]) and the next smallest is p[n-x+1], etc. So the y smallest are p[n-x] to p[n-x+y-1]. \n\nTherefore, we can precompute a prefix sum array for the entire sorted array (in ascending order) so that we can quickly compute the sum of any contiguous segment.\n\nHowever, the provided code sorts in descending order and then builds an array 'a' by iterating. Then it does:\n  for each query (x,y): print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: in the provided code, we have:\n  a = [0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:\n      ... we are building a by appending a new element.\n\nIn the provided code, the list 'a' is built by taking the sorted prices in descending order. Then the prefix sum array 'a' would be:\n  a[0] = 0\n  a[1] = first element (which is the largest price)\n  a[2] = largest + second largest\n  ...\n\nBut then the query: a[x] is the sum of the top x prices (the x largest). Then a[x] - a[x-y] is the sum of the top (x) minus the top (x-y). That would be the sum of the prices from the (x-y+1)-th largest to the x-th largest? \n\nBut note: the free items are the y cheapest in the set of x items. In the set of the top x items (which are the largest x), the cheapest y are the last y in the descending order? Actually, in the set of the top x (largest) sorted in descending order: \n  [largest, second largest, ..., (x-th largest)]\nThe cheapest in this set is the last one (the x-th largest). The next cheapest is the (x-1)-th largest? Actually, no: in descending order, the last one is the smallest. So the y cheapest are the last y in this list. \n\nBut the prefix sum array 'a' built from descending order (largest first) has:\n  a[0] = 0\n  a[1] = largest\n  a[2] = largest + second largest\n  ...\n  a[x] = sum of the top x\n\nThen the last y in the top x are the (x-y+1)-th to the x-th in the descending list? Actually, the last y are the smallest y. How do we get the sum of the last y? \n  total of top x: a[x]\n  total of the top (x-y): a[x-y] \n  then the last y: a[x] - a[x-y] is the sum of the (x-y+1)-th to the x-th in the descending list? That is exactly the y smallest in the set.\n\nSo the approach in the provided code is:\n  sort the prices in descending order\n  build prefix sums: a[0]=0, a[1]=p0, a[2]=p0+p1, ... a[i] = a[i-1] + p_{i-1} (for the descending list)\n\nThen for a query (x,y): \n  the set of items we choose is the top x (largest x) in descending order: [p0, p1, ..., p_{x-1}]\n  the y smallest in this set are the last y: [p_{x-y}, p_{x-y+1}, ..., p_{x-1}]? \n  But note: in the descending list, the last y are the smallest. The sum of these y is the total of the last y in the prefix array: which is a[x] (the sum of the first x) minus a[x-y] (the sum of the first x-y). \n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut the provided code has a TODO: we are building the list 'a' by iterating over the sorted list in descending order. We need to build the prefix sum array.\n\nThe current code:\n  a = [0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:\n      ... we need to append to a: the last element of a plus x.\n\nSo we do:\n  a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nBut note: the sorted(g()) returns the prices in ascending order? Then [::-1] reverses to descending.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is to build the prefix sum array.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the store has n items. We are building a prefix sum array of length n+1 (indices 0..n). Then we can answer the query for any x (which is at most n) and y (which is at most x).\n\nSo the code for program1.py:\n\n  n, q = g()\n  prices = sorted(g())   # ascending\n  a = [0]\n  for price in prices[::-1]:   # now we traverse in descending order\n      a.append(a[-1] + price)\n\nBut note: the provided code already has:\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]: \n\nSo we can do:\n\n  a = [0]\n  for price in sorted(g())[::-1]:\n      a.append(a[-1] + price)\n\nBut then the next line: for b in [0]*q: ... uses a. However, note that the array a now has n+1 elements: indices 0 to n.\n\nBut the query: we are going to use a[x] and a[x-y]. Since x and x-y are at least 0 and at most n, and we have n+1 elements, it's safe.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is the body of the for-loop: we need to append the current prefix.\n\nBut note: the provided code already has the for-loop header and the next line for the queries. So we only need to complete the for-loop body.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n  a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nBut note: the variable in the loop is named 'x'. So we can write:\n\n  a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nHowever, the problem says: Output only the missing lines or blocks. The existing code has:\n\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are missing the body of the for-loop. We must add one line: appending to a.\n\nBut note: the next line is \"for b in[0]*q: ...\", which is already there.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing part is the body of that for-loop: one line.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are reading t test cases. The first line is t, then t lines each with a rating.\n\nFor each rating, we output the division.\n\nThe divisions:\n  Division 1: rating >= 1900\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n  Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nWe can use if-else.\n\nThe code:\n\n  for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n      rating = int(n.strip())\n      if rating >= 1900:\n          print(\"Division 1\")\n      elif rating >= 1600:\n          print(\"Division 2\")\n      elif rating >= 1400:\n          print(\"Division 3\")\n      else:\n          print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the divisions are defined as:\n  Division 1: 1900 <= rating\n  Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n  Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n  Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\nOur conditions are:\n  if rating >= 1900 -> Division 1\n  else if rating >= 1600 -> Division 2 (because if it's >=1600 and not >=1900, then 1600<=rating<=1899)\n  else if rating >= 1400 -> Division 3 (because then 1400<=rating<=1599)\n  else -> Division 4.\n\nThis matches.\n\nBut note: the input has negative ratings? Yes, and our condition for Division 4 is rating<=1399, which includes negatives.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is the body of the for-loop: we convert the string to an integer and then use if-elif-else.\n\nBut note: the provided code has:\n  for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must write the code for the loop body.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  r = int(n)\n  if r >= 1900: ...\nBut we can do it in one line? Actually, we need multiple lines.\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the block of code that goes in the loop.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n  r = int(n)\n  if r >= 1900:\n      print(\"Division 1\")\n  elif r >= 1600:\n      print(\"Division 2\")\n  elif r >= 1400:\n      print(\"Division 3\")\n  else:\n      print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the variable n is a string from the file, including newline. We can use n.strip() or int(n) will ignore the newline.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n  r = int(n.strip())\n\nBut the problem says the input is an integer per line. So int(n) also works because the newline is stripped by int? Actually, yes.\n\nBut to be safe, we can do int(n.strip()). However, the problem does not specify extra spaces. The note says: one integer per line.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  r = int(n)\n\nBut the example input: \n  t\n  rating1\n  rating2\n  ...\n\nThe [*open(0)][1:] gives the lines without the first. Each element n is a string that might have a newline. int(n) handles it.\n\nSo we can write:\n\n  r = int(n)\n\nNow, we output the code as a string in the JSON.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" and in the specified format.\n\nWe must output:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nFor program1, the missing code is the body of the for-loop: one line.\n\nFor program2, the missing code is the entire body of the for-loop: multiple lines.\n\nBut note: the existing code in program1.py has:\n\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n  for b in[0]*q:x,y=g();print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\nWe are to fill the body of the first for-loop. So the missing code for program1 is:\n\n  a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nBut note: we must be careful with indentation. The existing for-loop is at the same level as the previous lines. The body should be indented.\n\nHowever, the problem says: output the missing code. We are to output the code that goes in the TODO part.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the existing code is:\n\n  for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to output the body of the loop (with proper indentation).\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo for program1, we output the string: \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\" (with 4 spaces of indentation? But the existing code uses 0 or 4? The provided code uses 0? Actually, the provided code in the example uses no indentation? But that's not valid. Actually, the example code:\n\n  r=open(0)\n  g=lambda:map(int,next(r).split())\n  n,q=g()\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n  for b in[0]*q:x,y=g();print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\nThis is not valid because the for-loop body is missing and the next for-loop is at the same level. We must have at least one line in the first for-loop.\n\nSo the intended code for program1 is:\n\n  r=open(0)\n  g=lambda:map(int,next(r).split())\n  n,q=g()\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:\n      a.append(a[-1] + x)   # this is the missing line\n  for b in[0]*q:x,y=g();print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is: \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\" (with 4 spaces).\n\nBut note: the problem does not specify the indentation level. However, the existing code in the problem statement for program1 uses 0 indentation? Actually, the example code is:\n\n  r=open(0)\n  g=lambda:map(int,next(r).split())\n  n,q=g()\n  a=[0]\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n  for b in[0]*q:x,y=g();print(a[x]-a[x-y])\n\nThis is not valid Python because the for-loop must have a body. We are to fill the body. The body must be indented. Since the rest of the code does not use consistent indentation, we assume 4 spaces.\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the existing code is:\n\n  for n in[*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to fill the body. The body should be indented.\n\nSo for program2, we output:\n\n  r = int(n)\n  if r >= 1900:\n      print(\"Division 1\")\n  elif r >= 1600:\n      print(\"Division 2\")\n  elif r >= 1400:\n      print(\"Division 3\")\n  else:\n      print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing in the program. For program2, the entire body of the for-loop is missing. So we output the above block, but each line should be indented by 4 spaces? Actually, the entire block is the body of the for-loop.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n  r = int(n)\n  if r >= 1900: print(\"Division 1\")\n  elif r >= 1600: print(\"Division 2\")\n  elif r >= 1400: print(\"Division 3\")\n  else: print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut the problem does not specify style. However, the example in the note uses multiple lines. But the existing code in program1 uses a one-line for-loop for the queries. We can do either. But for clarity, we do the multi-line.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string that would be inserted.\n\nSo for program1, we output: \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\" (without the quotes, and with 4 spaces).\n\nFor program2, we output:\n\n    r = int(n)\n    if r >= 1900:\n        print(\"Division 1\")\n    elif r >= 1600:\n        print(\"Division 2\")\n    elif r >= 1400:\n        print(\"Division 3\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Division 4\")\n\nBut note: the entire block must be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for-loop? Actually, the for-loop is at the top level. The body should be indented by 4 spaces. And the inner blocks (if, elif, else) should be indented by 4 more.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, we are to output the code that when inserted runs correctly.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire block without extra newlines? But the problem says the existing code has the for-loop header and we are to fill the body.\n\nSo we output:\n\n  program1: \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\"\n  program2: a multi-line string.\n\nBut in JSON, we must escape newlines and quotes? Actually, we are to output a JSON string. The value for \"program1\" and \"program2\" are strings.\n\nWe can represent the program2 part as:\n\n  \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nBut note: we must escape the double quotes inside.\n\nAlternatively, we can use single quotes in the print? But the problem says the output should be \"Division X\", so we use double quotes in the string.\n\nBut in the JSON string, we can use backslash to escape.\n\nAlternatively, we can use triple quotes? But the problem says output the missing code as a string in JSON.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  \"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\",\n  \"program2\": \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\n    else:\\n        print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n\nBut note: the indentation for the if-elif-else: the entire block is the body of the for-loop, so we indent by 4 spaces. Then the if, elif, else are at the same level as the assignment to r? Then we indent the print by 4 more? That would be 8 spaces. But that is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut the problem says the output must be exactly \"Division X\", and the example uses double quotes. But in Python, single and double are the same. We can use single to avoid escaping.\n\nSo we choose single quotes for the print.\n\nAlternatively, we can use double and escape.\n\nBut the problem does not specify. We'll use single to avoid escaping.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n  program1: \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\"\n  program2: \"    r = int(n)\\n    if r >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif r >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif r >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut note: the variable name in program2: we used 'r'. We could use any name.\n\nAlternatively, we can use:\n\n  rating = int(n)\n\nBut the problem does not specify.\n\nWe'll use 'rating' for clarity.\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. We can choose.\n\nLet me use:\n\n  program2: \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nNow, we output the JSON.\n\nBut note: the entire JSON must be on one line? Or can it be multi-line? The problem does not specify. We'll output a compact JSON.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the string without newlines? But that would be hard to read. But the problem does not require human readability.\n\nBut the problem says: Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nWe'll output:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\nBut note: in JSON, we must escape backslashes? Actually, we use \\n to represent a newline. But in a string, we write \"\\\\n\" to represent a single backslash and an n? No, we use \\n to represent a newline. But when we write the string in JSON, we use the two-character sequence: backslash followed by n to represent a newline.\n\nBut in the JSON string, we represent a newline by the escape sequence \\n. So we write the string with \\n and then when we output the JSON, we use double quotes and escape the double quotes inside? Actually, we are using single quotes for the print, so we don't need to escape double quotes.\n\nBut the entire string for program2 has double quotes? No, we are using single quotes for the print, so we can use double quotes for the JSON string.\n\nAlternatively, we can use triple quotes? But the problem says output the JSON.\n\nWe'll generate the string with actual newline characters? But then we must escape them in the JSON string.\n\nActually, in JSON, a string can contain escape sequences. We write the newline as \\n.\n\nSo the string for program2 is:\n\n  \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut when we put this in a JSON string, we must escape the newlines? Actually, no: we can write the string with the literal newline? But that would break the JSON. Instead, we represent each newline as the two-character sequence: backslash and 'n'.\n\nSo we replace each newline with \\n.\n\nBut we are writing a string in code, so we have to double the backslash? Actually, no: when we output the JSON, we output the string with the escape sequences.\n\nBut we are writing the JSON as a string. We can do:\n\n  import json\n  result = {\n      \"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\",\n      \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n  }\n  print(json.dumps(result))\n\nBut we are not writing code to output, we are writing the answer.\n\nSo we output:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\nBut this is not valid because the newlines are not escaped. We must escape them as \\n.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the string with \\n.\n\nSo the program2 string is:\n\n  \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut that would be: we are writing two backslashes? Actually, no: we want the JSON string to contain the escape sequences. So we output the string with the two-character representation: backslash followed by n.\n\nBut in the JSON, the string value for program2 is a string that when interpreted has newlines? Actually, we can do either: literal newlines in the JSON string (which is allowed in JSON if we are generating it programmatically? but not in a file) or escape them.\n\nThe problem does not specify. But to be safe, we escape them.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and then we output the JSON. We are writing the JSON as a string. We can use the standard JSON representation.\n\nSo we output:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\nBut wait: this would have two backslashes? Actually, no: when we write the string, we use one backslash to escape the n. But in the representation, we write the backslash as a backslash. So in the actual output, we write:\n\n  \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    ...\"\n\nBut that is not possible because we are writing a string. We must escape the newline as \\n.\n\nSo we output the string with the escape sequences.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a tool to generate the JSON. But we are writing by hand.\n\nWe decide to output:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\nBut this is not valid JSON because the newline in the string breaks the line. We must not have literal newlines in the JSON string. We must use \\n.\n\nTherefore, we replace every newline in the program2 string with the two-character sequence: backslash and n.\n\nSo the program2 string becomes:\n\n  \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut when we write this in a JSON string, we write the backslash as a double backslash? Actually, no: we write the backslash once. For example, the string \"a\\nb\" in JSON is written as \"a\\nb\".\n\nSo in the output, we write:\n\n  \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut that is not correct: we want the JSON to contain the escape sequence for newline, which is \\n, meaning one backslash and an n.\n\nBut when we write the string in the JSON, we write the two characters: backslash and n to represent a newline.\n\nSo the actual text for the program2 value is:\n\n  \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut to represent this in JSON, we must escape the newlines as \\n. So the JSON string will have:\n\n  \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\nBut wait: this is confusing. Let me clarify:\n\n  The string we want for program2 is (without the quotes):\n      rating = int(n)\n      if rating >= 1900:\n          print('Division 1')\n      ... etc.\n\n  This string has newlines. When we put it in a JSON string, we represent the newline by the two-character sequence: backslash (represented as '\\\\' in a string) and 'n'. But actually, in JSON, we write the two-character sequence: a backslash followed by an 'n' to represent a newline.\n\n  So the JSON string for program2 is:\n\n      \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  But when we write this as a string in the output, we must not break the line. We write it as a single line with the escape sequences.\n\n  However, in the output of our answer, we are writing a string that is the JSON. So we must escape the backslash? Actually, no: we write the backslash and the n as two characters.\n\n  For example, in Python, if we were to write:\n\n      s = \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if ...\"\n\n  then to represent it in JSON, we do:\n\n      json_string = '\"' + s.replace('\"', '\\\\\"').replace('\\n', '\\\\n') + '\"'\n\n  But wait, that would replace the newline by two characters: backslash and n.\n\n  But actually, the standard way is to use the escape sequences.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the json.dumps function which does this automatically.\n\n  But since we are not writing code, we output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\n  But this has double backslashes? Actually, in the actual output, we write a single backslash and then an 'n'. But in the string representation, we write two backslashes to represent one.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify whether to use raw string or not. We are to output the JSON.\n\n  We decide to output the JSON with the newline escape sequences as \\n.\n\n  But note: in the final output, the program2 string should be a single line containing the escape sequences.\n\n  For example, the value for program2 is a string that contains the characters: space, space, space, space, 'r','a','t','i','n','g',' ','=',' ','i','n','t','(','n',')','\\','n', ... \n\n  But wait, the '\\' is not followed by 'n'? We write it as two characters: a backslash and an 'n'. But that is not a newline. \n\n  I think I made a mistake: in JSON, the newline is represented by the two-character sequence: a backslash and a lowercase n. So in the JSON text, we write:\n\n      \"line1\\nline2\"\n\n  and this is a string with an embedded newline.\n\n  But when we are generating the JSON as a string to output, we write the two characters: backslash and n to represent one newline character.\n\n  However, in the actual output, we must not write a literal newline in the JSON string. We must write the two characters: backslash and n.\n\n  But in the context of this problem, since we are outputting text, we output the two characters.\n\n  So the program2 string in the JSON is:\n\n      \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  But this is not valid because the newlines in the JSON source would break it.\n\n  Therefore, we must escape the newlines in the JSON string by writing \\n.\n\n  How to do it: we replace each newline in the program2 string with the two-character sequence: backslash and n.\n\n  But then the program2 string becomes:\n\n      \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  This is not what we want because then the actual string would contain the literal backslash and n, not a newline.\n\n  We are confused.\n\n  Let me try an example in Python:\n\n      import json\n      d = {\n          \"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\",\n          \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n      }\n      s = json.dumps(d)\n      print(s)\n\n  This will output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\n  But this is a string that has newlines? Actually, no: the json.dumps function will escape the newlines as \\n, so the output will be a single line with \\n in the string.\n\n  For example, the output might be:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\n  But this is shown with the escape sequences.\n\n  So in our answer, we output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\\\n        print('Division 1')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\\\n        print('Division 2')\\\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\\\n        print('Division 3')\\\\n    else:\\\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\n  This is not what we want.\n\n  The correct way is to use the following for the program2 string in the JSON:\n\n      \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  and then when we serialize to JSON, the newlines will be escaped as \\n.\n\n  But since we are not using a JSON serializer, we must do it manually.\n\n  We output the following string for program2 in the JSON:\n\n      \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  and then in the overall JSON, we escape any double quotes and newlines.\n\n  But the only special characters in the program2 string are the newlines. We replace each newline with the two-character sequence \\n.\n\n  So the text for program2 becomes:\n\n      \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  and then we put it in the JSON string.\n\n  But to write it in a text file, we must not have newlines. So we represent the newline as \\n.\n\n  Therefore, the final JSON is:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\",\n        \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n      }\n\n  But this has newlines in the program2 string. We must not have newlines in the JSON. We must use \\n for each newline.\n\n  So we type:\n\n      \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  as a single line with the \\n as two characters.\n\n  For example, the program2 string in the JSON will be:\n\n      \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n\n  and this is a valid JSON string.\n\n  So we output the following JSON:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\n  This is a single line.\n\n  But note: the program2 string has embedded newline characters represented as \\n (two characters: backslash and n). When this JSON is parsed, the program2 string will have newlines.\n\n  However, in the context of this problem, we are to output the code. The code for program2 should have newlines.\n\n  So this is correct.\n\n  Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\",\n        \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"\n      }\n\n  But as a compact JSON:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"    a.append(a[-1] + x)\", \"program2\": \"    rating = int(n)\\n    if rating >= 1900:\\n        print('Division 1')\\n    elif rating >= 1600:\\n        print('Division 2')\\n    elif rating >= 1400:\\n        print('Division 3')\\n    else:\\n        print('Division 4')\"}\n\n  We output this."
