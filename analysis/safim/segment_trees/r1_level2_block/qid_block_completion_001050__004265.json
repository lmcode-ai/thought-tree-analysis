But note: if m0 > t, then even if we open all n pipes, we cannot fill the system in time? Actually, because T_min(k) >= m0 for every k. Therefore, if m0 > t, then it's impossible -> output -1. If m0 <= t, then we require ceil(S/k) <= t, which is equivalent to k >= ceil(S/t). Therefore, the minimum k is k_min = ceil(S/t). But note: we must also have k_min >= ceil(S/t). However, is that sufficient? Because then T_min(k_min) = max(m0, ceil(S/k_min)) and we know:\n   ceil(S/k_min) <= t   because k_min = ceil(S/t) -> k_min >= S/t -> S/k_min <= t -> ceil(S/k_min) <= ceil(t) = t? Actually, if S is divisible by t, then k_min = S/t, and then ceil(S/k_min)=ceil(t)=t. If not, then k_min = ceil(S/t) = floor(S/t)+1, then S/k_min < t? Not necessarily: \n   k_min = ceil(S/t) = k0, then k0-1 < S/t <= k0 -> S/t <= k0 -> S <= k0 * t -> then ceil(S/k0) <= t? Actually, we have S <= k0 * t, so ceil(S/k0) < = ceil(k0*t/k0) = ceil(t) = t? But note: ceil(S/k0) is the smallest integer >= S/k0. Since S/k0 <= t, then ceil(S/k0) <= t? Not exactly: if S/k0 is not an integer, then ceil(S/k0) <= t? Example: S=10, t=3 -> k0 = ceil(10/3)=4. Then S/k0 = 10/4 = 2.5 -> ceil(2.5)=3 <= 3 -> yes. Example: S=10, t=4 -> k0=ceil(10/4)=3 -> S/k0=10/3\u22483.33 -> ceil=4, which is <=4? yes. But wait: we require ceil(S/k0) <= t? Actually, we have S <= k0 * t -> S/k0 <= t -> then ceil(S/k0) <= t? This is true because if S/k0 <= t, then ceil(S/k0) is at most ceil(t) but note t is integer? Yes, t is integer. So if S/k0 <= t, then ceil(S/k0) <= t? Actually, if S/k0 is an integer, then ceil(S/k0)=S/k0<=t. If not, then ceil(S/k0) <= t? Since S/k0 <= t, then the smallest integer greater than or equal to S/k0 is at most t? Example: S/k0 = 3.9, t=4 -> ceil=4<=4 -> yes. Example: S/k0 = 4.0, t=4 -> ceil=4<=4 -> yes. Example: S/k0 = 4.1, t=4 -> but wait, we have S <= k0*t -> 4.1 <= 4? no. So that case doesn't happen. Therefore, if we set k_min = ceil(S/t), then ceil(S/k_min) <= t. And we also have m0<=t (by the condition above). Therefore, T_min(k_min) = max(m0, ceil(S/k_min)) <= t? Actually, we have both m0<=t and ceil(S/k_min)<=t, so the maximum is <=t. Therefore, the answer for a query t is:\n   if m0 > t: then -1\n   else: ceil(S/t)\n\nBut note: the example test case:\n\nInput: \n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nIn the example, the answers for t=1,3,4 are -1.

For [4,1,1,4,5]:\n        s0=4 -> ceil(4/1)=4.\n        s1=5 -> ceil(5/2)=3. s2=6 -> ceil(6/3)=2. s3=10 -> ceil(10/4)=3. s4=15 -> ceil(15/5)=3. m0 = 4. then for t<4: -1.\n        for t=4: ceil(15/4)=4.\n        for t=5: ceil(15/5)=3.\n        for t=6: ceil(15/6)=3. then the output for the example input [1,5,3,4,4,6] would be:\n        t=1: -1\n        t=5: 3\n        t=3: -1   [ because 3<4]\n        t=4: 4\n        t=4: 4\n        t=6: 3\n\n   but the example expects for the fourth query (t=4) -1, not 4. and for the fifth query (t=4) 4, not -1. This is a contradiction. The example note says: for the sixth query ( which is t=6) the answer is 3, and for the second query ( which is t=5) the answer is 3, and for the fifth query ( which is t=4) the answer is 4. and for the fourth query (t=4) the answer is -1. So two queries with t=4: one outputs -1 and one outputs 4? This is not possible. Given the time, and since we must output the missing code for program2.py, and the TODO is in the loop over queries, and the example code in program2.py already computes:\n\n   p=0\n   m=0\n   for i,v in enumerate(I().split()):\n        p+=int(v)\n        m=max(m,(p+i)//(i+1))\n\n   then for each query t, we must output something. and the note in the example code: for the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4 -> 4 pipes. Therefore, for the fifth query ( which is t=4) the answer is 4. and for the fourth query ( which is t=4) the answer is -1? that doesn't make sense. Perhaps the example note has a different volumes array.\n\n   volumes =",

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to complete the missing parts in two separate Python programs. The first program (`program1.py`) involves finding the maximum sum of values from partitioning an array optimally, while the second program (`program2.py`) deals with determining the minimum number of pipes needed to fill all locks within a given time.\n\n### Solution for `program1.py`\nThe missing code in `program1.py` is within the `modify` method of the `Seg` class. This method updates a segment tree for range maximum queries. The `else` branch in the `modify` method is incomplete. The solution involves recursively modifying the right child of the current segment tree node when the position to update is in the right half of the current segment.\n\n**Missing Code:**\n- In the `else` branch, call `self.modify` on the right child with the appropriate parameters: `self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)`.\n\n### Solution for `program2.py`\nThe missing code in `program2.py` processes multiple queries to determine the minimum number of pipes needed to fill all locks within a given time. The solution involves:\n1. Reading the number of locks and their volumes.\n2. Calculating the total volume of water needed (`p`) and the maximum value `m` derived from the prefix sums and their ceiling values when divided by their respective positions.\n3. For each query, if the given time `t` is less than `m`, it's impossible to fill all locks, so output `-1`. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of pipes as the ceiling of the total volume divided by the time, i.e., `(p + t - 1) // t`.\n\n**Missing Code:**\n- For each query, read the time `t`.\n- If `t < m`, print `-1`.\n- Otherwise, print `(p + t - 1) // t`.\n\n### Final Code\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\",\n  \"program2\": \"    t = int(I())\\n    if t < m:\\n        print",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete. We must output only the missing code in the specified JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe note that the provided code has a TODO in the segment tree modify function. The segment tree is used for range maximum queries. The modify function is recursive and when the position is in the right child, we must complete the code.\n\nThe missing part in the segment tree modify function is when the position is in the right half. We should call modify on the right child and then update the parent.\n\nSpecifically, the current code for the left child is:\n    if pos < mid:\n        self.modify(pos, x, p*2, l, mid)\nFor the right child, we should do:\n    else:\n        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nBut note: the segment tree is built for the range [l, r) (half-open). The condition for the right child is when pos >= mid.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nHowever, note that the current code for the left child uses the interval [l, mid) and the right child [mid, r). This is consistent.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing line is:\n        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\nBut wait, the entire program1.py code is provided and we are only to fill in the missing part. The TODO is in the else branch of the if statement in the modify method of the Seg class.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\nThe code is incomplete. We are given:\n\nI=input;n=int(I());p=m=0\nfor i,v in enumerate(I().split()):\n  p+=int(v);m=max(m,(p+i)//(i+1))\nfor _ in [0]*int(I()):\n  # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must complete the for loop that processes the queries.\n\nThe problem: We are given n, then a list of n integers (volumes of locks), then q queries. For each query t_j, we must output the minimum number of pipes to open so that after t_j seconds all locks are filled. If impossible, output -1.\n\nNote: The example note and the problem description explain that water flows from a lock to the next when it overflows. We have to fill all locks.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The total volume of water required is the sum of all v_i (let S = v1+v2+...+vn).\n2. However, because of the cascading overflow, the time to fill the system depends on the distribution of pipes and the volumes.\n\nAnother important point: The water from a pipe in an earlier lock can help fill multiple downstream locks, but only if the upstream locks are already full.\n\nWe note that the example computes:\n  m = max(m, (p+i) // (i+1))\nwhere p is the cumulative sum of the first i+1 volumes (since i starts at 0, the first volume is at index0).\n\nWhy? Consider the first i+1 locks. The water that enters the system must eventually fill these locks. However, note that water from a pipe at a lock j (<= i) can contribute to the locks from j to i. But the constraint is that the lock j must be full before water flows to j+1. The worst-case constraint for the first i+1 locks is that we must have at least ceil( (v0 + v1 + ... + vi) / (number of pipes in the first i+1 locks) ) seconds? Actually, the note in the code: (p+i)//(i+1) is equivalent to ceil(p/(i+1))? Not exactly: (p+i)//(i+1) is the same as ceil(p/(i+1))? Let me check:\n\n  ceil(p/(i+1)) = (p + i) // (i+1)   [if we use integer arithmetic] because:\n      (p + i) // (i+1) = floor((p+i)/(i+1)) \n  But note: \n      p = v0+v1+...+vi\n      We want the minimum time required to fill the first i+1 locks? Actually, the constraint is that the entire system must be filled, but the critical point is that the lock i must be filled. However, the water that enters at any pipe in the first i+1 locks can only contribute to the first i+1 locks until they are full.\n\nBut note: the problem states that we must fill all locks. However, the mayor's query is: we can choose which pipes to open arbitrarily. We want the minimum number of pipes such that after t seconds, all locks are full.\n\nHow to think:\n  The total water that must be delivered is S = v0+v1+...+v_{n-1}. In t seconds, we can deliver at most t * (number of pipes) liters. But note: the water is distributed in a cascading manner. However, there is a more critical constraint: the lock i cannot be filled until the lock i-1 is full? Actually, the water flows from lock i to lock i+1 only when lock i is full. Therefore, the time to fill the entire system is at least the maximum over i of (time to fill the first i+1 locks) divided by the number of pipes that contribute to the first i+1 locks? But note: we can choose which pipes to open arbitrarily.\n\nLet x_i be the number of pipes we open in the first i+1 locks. Then the water that can be delivered to the first i+1 locks in t seconds is at most t * x_i. However, we must have t * x_i >= v0+v1+...+v_i. Therefore, we must have x_i >= ceil( (v0+...+v_i) / t ). But note: we cannot assign fractional pipes. Also, the pipes we open in the first i+1 locks are at most the total pipes we open (say k). Therefore, for each i, we must have k >= ceil( (v0+...+v_i) / t ). Therefore, the minimum k must be at least max_{i} ceil( (v0+...+v_i) / t ).\n\nBut wait: is that sufficient? Actually, note that the water from a pipe at a lock j (which is in the first i+1 locks) can only contribute to the first i+1 locks until they are full. So the condition is necessary. Is it sufficient? We can assign the pipes arbitrarily. However, there is another constraint: the lock i must be filled, but the water that enters at a lock j (with j>i) does not help the first i+1 locks. Therefore, the condition is also sufficient? \n\nBut note: the example also considers the constraint that the lock i must be filled even if the water comes from an upstream pipe? Actually, the water from a pipe at a lock j (j<=i) can contribute to the first i+1 locks. The water from a pipe at a lock j>i does not help the first i+1 locks. Therefore, the condition is: for each i, the number of pipes in the first i+1 locks (call it x_i) must satisfy x_i * t >= s_i (where s_i = v0+...+v_i). Therefore, the minimum total pipes k must be at least max_i ceil(s_i / t). However, note that we can choose the pipes arbitrarily, so we can always assign at least ceil(s_i/t) pipes in the first i+1 locks? But the total pipes we have is k, and we can assign at most k pipes in the first i+1 locks. Therefore, k must be at least ceil(s_i/t) for every i. Therefore, the minimum k is k0 = max_i ceil(s_i/t). But note: we also have the constraint that the entire system must be filled: k * t >= S (the total volume). However, note that when i = n-1, s_i = S, so ceil(S/t) is included in the max. Therefore, k0 = max_i ceil(s_i/t) is the candidate.\n\nBut wait: the example also computes m = max(m, (p+i)//(i+1)) where p = s_i (the prefix sum for the first i+1) and i from 0 to n-1. What is this m? \n  (s_i + i) // (i+1) = ceil(s_i/(i+1))? \n  Actually: \n      ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b\n  So: ceil(s_i/(i+1)) = (s_i + i) // (i+1)   [because (s_i + i) // (i+1) = floor((s_i+i)/(i+1)) and since (s_i+i)/(i+1) might not be integer, but note: \n      s_i/(i+1) <= (s_i+i)/(i+1) < s_i/(i+1) + 1, so floor((s_i+i)/(i+1)) = ceil(s_i/(i+1))? \n  Actually, if s_i is divisible by (i+1), then (s_i+i) = (i+1)*k + i = k*(i+1)+i, then (s_i+i)//(i+1) = k + i//(i+1) = k (since i//(i+1)=0). \n  If not, let s_i = k*(i+1) + r (0<r<=i), then (s_i+i) = k*(i+1) + r + i = k*(i+1) + (r+i). Now, r+i >= i+1? because r>=1 -> r+i>=i+1? \n      Actually, r+i can be as low as 1+i, which is i+1. So (s_i+i) = (k+1)*(i+1) + (r-1). Then (s_i+i)//(i+1) = k+1. \n  But ceil(s_i/(i+1)) = k+1. So indeed: (s_i+i)//(i+1) = ceil(s_i/(i+1)).\n\nBut note: the m computed in the loop is the maximum over i of ceil(s_i/(i+1)). Why is that important?\n\nActually, the problem says: we must fill the entire system. However, there is a constraint that we cannot have more than one pipe per lock? Actually, we can open any set of pipes arbitrarily. But note: the problem does not restrict the same lock having multiple pipes? Actually, the problem says \"open pipes\" meaning we can open any set of pipes. Each lock has one pipe, and we can choose to open it or not. So we are choosing a subset of locks to open their pipes.\n\nBut note: the condition we derived above is: k must be at least ceil(s_i/t) for every i. However, the example code computes m = max_i ceil(s_i/(i+1)). How does that relate?\n\nActually, the value m is the minimum time required to fill the entire system if we are allowed to use at most k pipes? But note: the problem asks: for a given time t, what is the minimum number of pipes? \n\nWe have two conditions:\n1. k must be at least ceil(S/t) [for the entire system].\n2. For each i, k must be at least ceil(s_i/t).\n\nBut note: the example code also computes m = max_i ceil(s_i/(i+1)). This m is the minimum time required to fill the system? Why?\n\nConsider: if we use k pipes, then the time required to fill the entire system must be at least max_i ceil(s_i / min(k, i+1))? Actually, the first i+1 locks can be filled by at most min(k, i+1) pipes? Because we can have at most i+1 pipes in the first i+1 locks (one per lock). Therefore, the time required to fill the first i+1 locks is at least ceil(s_i / min(k, i+1)). Therefore, the total time must be at least max_i ceil(s_i / min(k, i+1)). \n\nBut note: we are allowed to choose which pipes to open arbitrarily. Therefore, the minimum time T_min(k) for a fixed k is:\n   T_min(k) = max_i [ ceil(s_i / min(k, i+1)) ]\n\nBut note: when k >= i+1, then min(k, i+1)=i+1, so ceil(s_i/(i+1)). When k < i+1, then ceil(s_i/k). Therefore:\n   T_min(k) = max( max_{i: i+1<=k} ceil(s_i/(i+1)), max_{i: i+1>k} ceil(s_i/k) )\n\nBut note: the value m computed in the example code is m0 = max_i ceil(s_i/(i+1)). Then for k>=? we have T_min(k) = m0? Actually, if k>=n, then for every i (i+1<=n<=k) so T_min(k)=m0. For k<n, we have to consider the indices i>=k. For these, we use ceil(s_i/k). Therefore, T_min(k) = max( m0, max_{i>=k} ceil(s_i/k) ). But note: the maximum over i>=k of ceil(s_i/k) is at least ceil(S/k) (because when i=n-1, s_i=S). Therefore, T_min(k) = max( m0, ceil(S/k) )? Not exactly: we must take the maximum over all i, including i from 0 to n-1. For i<k, we have ceil(s_i/(i+1)) <= m0 (by definition of m0) and for i>=k, we have ceil(s_i/k) which is at least ceil(S/k) (if we take i=n-1) but also note that for i in [k, n-1], s_i is increasing. So the maximum for i>=k is ceil(S/k) because S is the largest. However, is ceil(s_i/k) for i>=k necessarily <= ceil(S/k)? Actually, s_i <= S, so ceil(s_i/k) <= ceil(S/k). Therefore, the maximum over i>=k is ceil(S/k). Therefore, T_min(k) = max( m0, ceil(S/k) ).\n\nBut note: we must also consider that for i<k, we have ceil(s_i/(i+1)) <= m0, and for i>=k, we have ceil(s_i/k) <= ceil(S/k). Therefore, T_min(k) = max(m0, ceil(S/k)).\n\nTherefore, for a given time t, we require:\n   max(m0, ceil(S/k)) <= t   =>   ceil(S/k) <= t and m0<=t.\n\nBut note: if m0 > t, then even if we open all n pipes, we cannot fill the system in time? Actually, because T_min(k) >= m0 for every k. Therefore, if m0 > t, then it's impossible -> output -1.\n\nIf m0 <= t, then we require ceil(S/k) <= t, which is equivalent to k >= ceil(S/t). Therefore, the minimum k is k_min = ceil(S/t). But note: we must also have k_min >= ceil(S/t). However, is that sufficient? Because then T_min(k_min) = max(m0, ceil(S/k_min)) and we know:\n   ceil(S/k_min) <= t   because k_min = ceil(S/t) -> k_min >= S/t -> S/k_min <= t -> ceil(S/k_min) <= ceil(t) = t? Actually, if S is divisible by t, then k_min = S/t, and then ceil(S/k_min)=ceil(t)=t. If not, then k_min = ceil(S/t) = floor(S/t)+1, then S/k_min < t? Not necessarily: \n   k_min = ceil(S/t) = k0, then k0-1 < S/t <= k0 -> S/t <= k0 -> S <= k0 * t -> then ceil(S/k0) <= t? \n   Actually, we have S <= k0 * t, so ceil(S/k0) <= ceil(k0*t/k0) = ceil(t) = t? But note: ceil(S/k0) is the smallest integer >= S/k0. Since S/k0 <= t, then ceil(S/k0) <= t? Not exactly: if S/k0 is not an integer, then ceil(S/k0) <= t? \n   Example: S=10, t=3 -> k0 = ceil(10/3)=4. Then S/k0 = 10/4 = 2.5 -> ceil(2.5)=3 <= 3 -> yes.\n   Example: S=10, t=4 -> k0=ceil(10/4)=3 -> S/k0=10/3\u22483.33 -> ceil=4, which is <=4? yes.\n\nBut wait: we require ceil(S/k0) <= t? Actually, we have S <= k0 * t -> S/k0 <= t -> then ceil(S/k0) <= t? \n   This is true because if S/k0 <= t, then ceil(S/k0) is at most ceil(t) but note t is integer? Yes, t is integer. So if S/k0 <= t, then ceil(S/k0) <= t? \n   Actually, if S/k0 is an integer, then ceil(S/k0)=S/k0<=t. If not, then ceil(S/k0) <= t? \n   Since S/k0 <= t, then the smallest integer greater than or equal to S/k0 is at most t? \n   Example: S/k0 = 3.9, t=4 -> ceil=4<=4 -> yes.\n   Example: S/k0 = 4.0, t=4 -> ceil=4<=4 -> yes.\n   Example: S/k0 = 4.1, t=4 -> but wait, we have S <= k0*t -> 4.1 <= 4? no. So that case doesn't happen.\n\nTherefore, if we set k_min = ceil(S/t), then ceil(S/k_min) <= t. And we also have m0<=t (by the condition above). Therefore, T_min(k_min) = max(m0, ceil(S/k_min)) <= t? \n   Actually, we have both m0<=t and ceil(S/k_min)<=t, so the maximum is <=t.\n\nTherefore, the answer for a query t is:\n   if m0 > t: then -1\n   else: ceil(S/t)\n\nBut note: the example test case:\n\nInput: \n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nIn the example, the answers for t=1,3,4 are -1. For t=2,5,6 the answers are 3,4,5? Actually, the example says:\n  In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1.\n\nBut let's compute for the example:\n  n=5, volumes = [1,2,3,4,5]\n  S = 15\n  Compute m0 = max_i ceil(s_i/(i+1)):\n      i=0: s0=1 -> ceil(1/1)=1\n      i=1: s1=1+2=3 -> ceil(3/2)= ceil(1.5)=2\n      i=2: s2=6 -> ceil(6/3)=2\n      i=3: s3=10 -> ceil(10/4)= ceil(2.5)=3\n      i=4: s4=15 -> ceil(15/5)=3\n      so m0 = max(1,2,2,3,3)=3.\n\n  Therefore, for t=1: 3>1 -> -1.\n        t=2: 3>2 -> -1? but the example says t=1,3,4 are -1. So t=2 is also -1? \n        However, the example says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\", meaning that t=2 is not -1? \n\nBut wait, the example note says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\" (so 3 pipes) and t=5? Actually, the example input has 6 queries: t=1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nBut the example output for the second query (t=2) is 3? and for the fifth and sixth? \n\nLet me reexamine: the example note says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\" and the time is 4 seconds? Actually, the example says: \"After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full. In the following 1 second ...\". So the total time is 5 seconds? But the query is t_j=5? \n\nBut the example input for the sixth query is t=5? Actually, the example says: \"the sixth query\" meaning the last one? \n\nThe example input: \n  5\n  1 2 3 4 5\n  6\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  6\n\nSo the sixth query is t=6.\n\nBut the example says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\" and then after 4 seconds ... and then 1 more second -> total 5 seconds. So for t=5, we can do it? Then the answer for t=5 is 3? \n\nBut according to our formula:\n   For t=2: m0=3>2 -> -1? but the example says the second query (t=2) is not -1? \n\nWait, the example says: \"In the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\". So the second query is t=2? How can that be? With t=2 seconds, we can only get 2*3=6 liters. But the total volume is 15. So it's impossible? \n\nI see: the example note says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\". So the second query (t=2) is not -1? But then the example says: \"In the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\". This must be for a different t? \n\nActually, the example input has 6 queries. The example note says: \"There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1.\" So the second, fifth, and sixth are not -1.\n\nBut then what is the second query? t=2? Then we must output 3? But 3*2=6 < 15 -> impossible? \n\nI think I made a mistake: the example note says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes at locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full.\" -> so the time is 4 seconds? But the query is t=4? But the example says the answer for t=4 is -1? \n\nThis is confusing. Let me read the problem statement again: the example note says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full. In the following 1 second, 1 liter of water is transferred to locks 2 and 5. The lock 3 is filled by its own pipe.\" -> so after 5 seconds, lock2 gets 1 liter (from lock1) and lock5 gets 1 liter (from lock4) and lock3 gets 1 liter from its own pipe. Then after 5 seconds, lock2 has 1 liter (but needs 2) -> not full? \n\nWait, the volumes: \n   lock1:1, lock2:2, lock3:3, lock4:4, lock5:5.\n\nAfter 4 seconds:\n   lock1: gets 4 seconds of water from pipe1 -> 4 liters, but volume=1 -> so 1 liter in lock1 and 3 liters overflow to lock2.\n   lock2: gets 3 liters? but then lock2 has 3 liters, which is more than 2 -> so lock2 becomes full and overflows 1 liter to lock3.\n   lock3: gets 1 liter from lock2 and 4 seconds from its own pipe? but wait, we opened pipe3 -> so lock3 gets 4 seconds from its own pipe? and 1 liter from lock2 -> total 5 liters? but volume=3 -> so 3 liters in lock3 and 2 liters overflow to lock4.\n   lock4: gets 4 seconds from its own pipe? and 2 liters from lock3 -> total 6 liters? volume=4 -> so 4 liters in lock4 and 2 liters overflow to lock5.\n   lock5: gets 2 liters? \nAfter 4 seconds: \n   lock1: full, lock2: full, lock3: full, lock4: full, lock5: 2/5.\n\nThen in the next second (second 5):\n   lock1: already full -> overflows to lock2: 1 liter -> lock2 is full -> overflows to lock3: 1 liter -> lock3 is full -> overflows to lock4: 1 liter -> lock4 is full -> overflows to lock5: 1 liter -> lock5 gets 2+1=3.\n   Also, lock3 gets 1 liter from its own pipe? but lock3 is already full -> so that 1 liter overflows to lock4? and then to lock5? -> so lock5 gets 1 more? total 4.\n   And lock4 gets 1 liter from its own pipe? but full -> overflows to lock5: 1 liter -> lock5 gets 5? \n   So after 5 seconds, lock5 is full.\n\nTherefore, the system is filled after 5 seconds. So for t=5, we can do it with 3 pipes.\n\nBut the query t=5: we output 3.\n\nNow, what about t=2? \n   We require the entire system to be filled in 2 seconds. \n   The total water needed is 15. We can open at most 5 pipes -> 5*2=10 < 15 -> impossible? \n   Therefore, for t=2, we output -1? \n\nBut the example says the second query is not -1? \n\nWait, the example input has 6 queries: \n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  6\n\nThe example note says: \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\". So the second query (t=2) is not -1? \n\nBut our calculation: m0=3. For t=2: m0=3>2 -> impossible -> output -1. \n\nThis contradicts the example note. \n\nI see: the example note says: \"In the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\". But that was for t=5? \n\nActually, the example note says: \n  \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1, 3, and 4. ... Similarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\"\n\nBut it doesn't specify the time for the second query. The problem says: \"the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled no later than after t_j seconds.\"\n\nSo the second query has t_j = 2? Then it's impossible. But the example says the answer for the second query is 3? \n\nI think there is a misunderstanding: the example input has 6 queries, but the example note only explains two of them: the sixth and the second. The second query might be t=5? and the sixth t=6? \n\nBut the input order: \n  first query: t=1 -> answer -1\n  second query: t=2 -> answer -1? but the example says the second query is not -1? \n\nAlternatively, the example note might be referring to the second example test case? \n\nLooking back: the problem says: \"In the first example test\" and then describes 6 queries. \n\nBut the example input: \n  n=5, volumes = [1,2,3,4,5], q=6, and then the queries: 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nAnd the example output: \n  -1\n  3   [for the second query?]\n  -1\n  -1\n  4   [for the fifth?]\n  5   [for the sixth?]\n\nBut wait, the example note says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\" -> so 3 pipes, but the output for the sixth query is 5? \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, the example note might be for a different test case? \n\nThe problem says: \"The picture illustrates 5 locks with two open pipes at locks 1 and 3. Because locks 1,3, and 4 are already filled, effectively the water goes to locks 2 and 5.\" -> that picture is for a fixed state, not necessarily the solution for a query.\n\nAnd then: \"Note that the volume of the i-th lock may be greater than the volume of the i+1-th lock.\" -> so the example test might be different.\n\nActually, the example test case is provided in the note: \n  \"In the sixth query we can open pipes at locks 1,3,4: ... and the sum of values is ...\"\n\nBut wait, the problem has two different problems? program1 and program2. The example note for program2 is separate.\n\nThe example note for program2 says: \n  \"There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes. In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. ... Similarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4.\"\n\nSo the example test case for program2 is:\n\n  n=5, volumes = [ ... ]? \n\nBut the example says: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\" -> so the first lock has volume 4? \n\nLet me assume the example test case for program2 is:\n  n=5\n  volumes: [4, ?, ...] \n\nBut the example says: \"the lock 3 is filled by its own pipe\" and \"locks 1 and 4 are full\" after 4 seconds. Then the volumes might be:\n   lock1: 4, lock2: something, lock3: something, lock4: 4, lock5: something.\n\nBut the example says: after 4 seconds, lock1 and lock4 are full. Then lock1: volume=4 -> requires 4 seconds. lock4: volume=4 -> requires 4 seconds. \n\nThen lock2: volume= something, lock3: volume= something, lock5: volume= something.\n\nThe example says: in the next second, 1 liter is transferred to lock2 and lock5. So lock2 gets 1 liter and lock5 gets 1 liter. \n\nAnd lock3 is filled by its own pipe in that second? so lock3 must have volume=1? \n\nBut then the total volume = 4 (lock1) + ? (lock2) + 1 (lock3) + 4 (lock4) + ? (lock5) = at least 9.\n\nFor the sixth query: t=6? and we use 3 pipes? \n\nBut the example says: \"In the sixth query\" -> so the sixth query has t=6? \n\nAnd the answer is 3.\n\nFor the second query: t=2? -> impossible? \n\nBut the example says the second query is not -1 and can be done with 3 pipes? \n\nWait, if the first lock has volume=4, then even if we open a pipe at lock1, it takes 4 seconds to fill lock1. Therefore, for any t<4, it's impossible. \n\nSo the first lock requires at least 4 seconds. Therefore, for t=1,2,3: impossible -> -1. \n\nFor t>=4, we can consider.\n\nThe example says: \n   queries 1,3,4: -1 -> so query1: t=1 -> -1, query3: t=3 -> -1, query4: t=4 -> -1? \n\nBut why t=4 is -1? \n\nThe example says: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\" -> but then after 4 seconds, the first lock is full, but the others might not be. \n\nIn fact, the example says: in the sixth query (t=6) we can do it with 3 pipes. \n\nSo for t=4: is it possible? \n   We must fill the entire system in 4 seconds. \n   The first lock requires 4 seconds to fill. \n   The other locks: the water for lock2 must come from the overflow of lock1. But lock1 overflows only after it is full, i.e., at the end of second 4. So lock2 gets water only at the very end? and then we need additional time to fill lock2? \n\nTherefore, it's impossible to fill lock2 in 4 seconds. \n\nSimilarly, lock3 and lock4 and lock5 require additional time. \n\nTherefore, for t=4: impossible -> -1.\n\nFor t=5: \n   We can open pipes at locks 1,3,4. \n   In 5 seconds:\n        lock1: gets 5 seconds of water? -> 5 liters -> fills at second4, then overflows 1 liter to lock2 at each second after? \n        Actually, at second1: lock1 gets 1 liter -> not full -> no overflow.\n        second2: lock1 gets 1 more -> 2 liters.\n        second3: lock1 gets 1 more -> 3 liters.\n        second4: lock1 gets 1 more -> 4 liters -> full. Then at second5: lock1 gets 1 liter -> overflows to lock2: 1 liter.\n        lock3: gets 5 seconds of water? -> 5 liters. But if the volume of lock3 is 1, then it fills at second1 and then overflows? \n        But the example says lock3 is filled by its own pipe -> so it gets 5 liters? but if its volume is 1, then it overflows 4 liters to lock4? \n\nThis is complex. \n\nGiven the complexity, let us trust the formula we derived: \n   Let S = total volume.\n   Let m0 = max_i ceil(s_i/(i+1))   [where s_i = v0+...+v_i]\n\n   For a query t:\n        if t < m0: then output -1\n        else: output ceil(S/t)\n\nBut in the example test case that has the first lock volume=4, what is m0?\n   i=0: s0=4 -> ceil(4/1)=4.\n   i=1: s1=4+v1 -> if v1 is 1, then s1=5 -> ceil(5/2)=3.\n   i=2: s2=4+1+v2 -> if v2=1, then s2=6 -> ceil(6/3)=2.\n   i=3: s3=4+1+1+v3 -> if v3=4, then s3=10 -> ceil(10/4)=3.\n   i=4: s4=4+1+1+4+v4 -> if v4=5, then s4=15 -> ceil(15/5)=3.\n   so m0 = max(4,3,2,3,3)=4.\n\n   Then for t=4: m0=4<=4 -> then k = ceil(S/t)=ceil(15/4)=4.\n   But the example says for t=4 the answer is -1.\n\nSo our formula fails for this example.\n\nTherefore, we must reconsider.\n\nThe flaw: the constraint T_min(k) = max( m0, ceil(S/k) ) is not the whole story. \n\nWe must account for the fact that the water from a pipe at a lock i only starts contributing to the next lock after lock i is full. Therefore, the time to fill lock i might be more than just the total water divided by the number of pipes. \n\nAlternative solution:\n\nWe note that the system can be seen as a series of locks that must be filled in order. The water from a pipe at lock j can only contribute to lock i (for i>=j) after the locks j, j+1, ..., i-1 are full. \n\nThis is a known problem: \"filling locks\". \n\nKnown solution: \n   Let f(k) = minimum time to fill all locks using k pipes.\n   How to compute f(k)? \n        We note that the water from a pipe at lock j will fill lock j and then contribute to lock j+1, etc. The time to fill lock i is at least the time to fill the water that must go through lock i, divided by the number of pipes that are at or before i.\n\n        Specifically, the total water that must flow through lock i is the sum of the volumes of locks i, i+1, ..., n-1? Actually, no: the water that enters at lock j will eventually contribute to every lock from j to n-1. But the constraint is that lock i cannot receive water from a pipe at lock j (for j<=i) until locks j to i-1 are full.\n\n        We can use a greedy / binary search? \n\nBut note: the constraints: n,q up to 200000.\n\nThere is a known solution in C++ for this problem (from Codeforces submissions for the same problem) that does:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   v = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   q = int(input())\n   s = sum(v)\n   m = 0\n   p = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        p += v[i]\n        m = max(m, (p + i) // (i+1))\n   for _ in range(q):\n        t = int(input())\n        if t < m:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((s + t - 1) // t)\n\nBut this is exactly what we had, and it fails the example.\n\nBut wait, the example test case that fails is:\n   v = [4,1,1,4,5] -> total=15, m0=4.\n   for t=4: output = ceil(15/4)=4, but the answer should be -1.\n\nTherefore, the known solution in Codeforces might be different.\n\nAfter checking, there is a solution that does:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   mx = 0\n   s = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        s += a[i]\n        mx = max(mx, (s+i)//(i+1))\n   tot = s\n   q = int(input())\n   for _ in range(q):\n        t = int(input())\n        if t < mx:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((tot + t - 1) // t)\n\nBut this is the same as above.\n\nHowever, there is a different known solution:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   v = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(v)\n   m = 0\n   cur = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        cur += v[i]\n        # The first i+1 locks require at least ceil(cur/(i+1)) seconds.\n        m = max(m, (cur+i)//(i+1))\n   # Also, the entire system requires at least ceil(s/k) seconds for k pipes, but also note the structural constraint per lock.\n   # However, there is an additional constraint: the time must be at least the maximum of the volumes? \n   # Actually, the first lock requires at least v0 seconds (if we have one pipe) or ceil(v0/x) seconds for x pipes at lock0, but we can have only one pipe at lock0.\n\n   # But note: the first lock can only be filled by pipes at lock0 or earlier? but there is no earlier. So the time must be at least v0.\n   # In fact, the first lock requires at least v0 seconds because the pipe at lock0 delivers 1 liter per second. Even if we have a pipe at lock0, it takes v0 seconds to fill it.\n\n   # Therefore, m = max(m, v0, v1, ...) ? \n\n   # But wait: the first lock: if we have a pipe at lock0, then it takes v0 seconds. If we don't, then we rely on overflow from upstream? but there is no upstream. So the first lock must have a pipe? or can it be filled by a pipe at a downstream lock? -> no, because water flows downstream. So the first lock can only be filled by a pipe at lock0. Therefore, the time must be at least v0.\n\n   # In our example: v0=4, so m should be at least 4. And it is.\n\n   # But then why is t=4 not sufficient? because the first lock is filled at second4, but the water for the second lock can only start flowing at second5? \n\n   # Therefore, the entire system cannot be filled in 4 seconds because the second lock hasn't received any water until second4 is over.\n\n   # This indicates that the time required is at least (v0) + (time to fill the second lock) ? \n\n   # But note: the water for the second lock can come from the pipe at lock0 overflow and also from a pipe at lock1 or lock2, etc. \n\n   # However, the pipe at lock1 can deliver water to lock1 from the start. But lock1 cannot receive water until lock0 is full? \n\n   # Actually, the problem says: \"water exceeding the volume of the lock i is transferred to lock i+1\". Therefore, lock0 must be full before any water can go to lock1. \n\n   # Therefore, the water for lock1 can only start arriving after v0 seconds. Then we need additional time to fill lock1. \n\n   # Similarly, lock2 can only start receiving water after lock1 is full, which is after (v0 + v1) seconds? \n\n   # But wait: if we open a pipe at lock1, then lock1 is receiving water from the pipe from the beginning. However, until lock0 is full, the water from the pipe at lock1 is filling lock1, but lock1 cannot overflow until it is full. \n\n   # But the catch: lock1 cannot be filled until lock0 is full? Actually, no: lock1 can be filled independently by its own pipe. However, the pipe at lock1 delivers water to lock1 at 1 liter per second. So lock1 will have some water, but if lock0 overflows, that water goes to lock1 and might fill it faster. \n\n   # The system is: at each second, every open pipe delivers 1 liter to its lock. If the lock is not full, the water stays. If it is full, the water overflows to the next lock.\n\n   # Therefore, lock1 can be receiving water from two sources: its own pipe and the overflow from lock0. \n\n   # However, the overflow from lock0 only starts after lock0 is full. \n\n   # Therefore, the time to fill lock1 is at least: \n        max( \n            v0,   # because until then lock0 is not full and no overflow to lock1 \n            ceil((v0+v1)/x)   # where x is the number of pipes at lock0 and lock1 \n        ) \n   ? \n\n   This is complex.\n\nGiven the complexity, we turn to a known accepted solution for the problem \"River Locks\" (problem link: https://codeforces.com/contest/1700/problem/C)\n\nActually, the problem is from Codeforces Round #797 (Div. 3) problem C. \n\nThe editorial: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/104088\n\nSolution from editorial for problem C:\n\n   #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n   using namespace std;\n\n   void solve() {\n     int n; cin >> n;\n     vector<int> v(n); \n     for (auto &x : v) cin >> x;\n     int64_t total = accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0LL);\n     int64_t min_prefix = 0;\n     int64_t cur_prefix = 0;\n     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cur_prefix += v[i];\n        min_prefix = min(min_prefix, cur_prefix);\n     }\n     int64_t start = -min_prefix;\n     cur_prefix = start;\n     for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cur_prefix += v[i];\n     }\n     int q; cin >> q;\n     while (q--) {\n        int t; cin >> t;\n        if (t < start) {\n            cout << -1 << '\\n';\n        } else {\n            cout << (total + t - 1) / t << '\\n';\n        }\n     }\n   }\n\n   // But wait, this is different.\n\n   # Or this solution in Python:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   v = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(v)\n   min_prefix = 0\n   current = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        current += v[i]\n        if current < min_prefix:\n            min_prefix = current\n   start = -min_prefix   # the initial water level needed in the first lock to avoid negative.\n\n   # Then for a query t:\n   #   if t < start: -1\n   #   else: ceil(s/t)\n\n   # How does this work for the example [4,1,1,4,5]?

no, then ceil(6/1)=6.\n        query2: t=3 -> ceil(6/3)=2.\n        query3: t=6 -> ceil(6/6)=1.\n        So output: 6, 2, 1.\n\n   But the sample output: \n        -1\n        2\n        1\n\n   So for t=1: output -1.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: if t < something then -1.\n\n   In the editorial solution: they use 'start' = x = -min_prefix = 0, then if t < start (0) -> -1, but t>=0, so never happens.\n\n   This is not matching.\n\n   The intended solution in the editorial is different. The editorial says:\n\n   We can binary search on the number of pipes. For a fixed number of pipes open, we can simulate greedily. But that is O(n) per binary search -> O(n log n) per query, which is too heavy.\n\n   The editorial solution for the query is: \n        Let x = -min_prefix, then the initial water level in the first lock must be at least x. Then the total water that must be delivered is x + tot.\n        Then the number of seconds must be at least x (because the initial water is delivered at time0? or over time?) and also the rate must be at least ceil((x+tot)/t) pipes.\n\n        But also, the initial water x must be in the first lock at time0? \n\n        The problem says: initially all locks are empty. Then we open the pipes at time0. \n\n        So the initial water level is 0. Therefore, we must deliver at least x liters to the first lock to cover the deficit. \n\n        How is x delivered? by the pipes. \n\n        Therefore, the total water that must be delivered by the pipes is x + tot.\n\n        Then the time t must be at least ceil((x+tot)/k) for some k, and also we must have the initial x delivered to the first lock within the first ceil(x/k) seconds? and then the system can be filled within the remaining time? \n\n        This is complex.\n\n   The editorial solution in the link above does: \n        start = -min_prefix\n        then for query t: \n            if t < start: print(-1)\n            else: print(ceil((start+tot)/t))\n\n   For the sample test case [1,2,3]:\n        start = 0, tot=6.\n        t=1: 0+6=6, ceil(6/1)=6 -> output 6, but expected -1.\n\n   So that doesn't work.\n\n   Another known solution from a top contestant ( tourist) for problem C:\n\n   #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n   using namespace std;\n\n   int main() {\n        ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n        cin.tie(0);\n        int n;\n        cin >> n;\n        vector<long long> v(n);\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            cin >> v[i];\n        }\n        long long total = accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0LL);\n        long long min_prefix = 0;\n        long long current = 0;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            current += v[i];\n            min_prefix = min(min_prefix, current);\n        }\n        current = -min_prefix;\n        long long saved = current;\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n            current += v[i];\n        }\n        int q;\n        cin >> q;\n        while (q--) {\n            int t;\n            cin >> t;\n            if (t < saved) {\n                cout << -1 << '\\n';\n            } else {\n                // How many pipes are needed? \n                // The total water to deliver is 'current' = saved + total.\n                // And we have to deliver it within t seconds.\n                // The number of pipes must be at least ceil(current / t).\n                // But also, the initial saved must be delivered, and the time for that is ceil(saved / ?) -> but note: we can use multiple pipes to deliver the initial saved.\n                // However, the first lock can only be filled by pipes at lock0. \n                // But the water for the first lock can come from any pipe at or before lock0? only lock0.\n                // Therefore, the number of pipes that can contribute to the first lock is the number of pipes at lock0. \n                // But we can have only one pipe at lock0.\n                // Therefore, the time to deliver the initial 'saved' to the first lock is at least saved seconds.\n                // So we require saved <= t.\n                // and then the rest of the system: 'current - saved' = total, can be delivered by the pipes in the system within t seconds, but note the overflow might deliver to multiple locks.\n\n                // However, the solution simply does:\n                cout << (current + t - 1) / t << '\\n';\n            }\n        }\n   }\n\n   For the sample [1,2,3]:\n        total=6.\n        min_prefix = 0.\n        saved = 0.\n        current = 0 + 6 = 6.\n        Query1: t=1: saved=0<=1, then ceil(6/1)=6.\n        Query2: t=3: ceil(6/3)=2.\n        Query3: t=6: ceil(6/6)=1.\n        This gives 6,2,1, but expected -1,2,1.\n\n   So for t=1, it should be -1. Why? \n        The solution checks: if t < saved: -1.\n        saved=0, so t=1>=0, so it outputs 6.\n\n   This is not matching.\n\n   The intended solution is more complex.\n\n   We must. in fact, note that the first lock requires at least v0 seconds if we have one pipe at lock0. In the sample [1,2,3]: v0=1, so with one pipe it takes 1 second to fill the first lock. Then the second lock can receive overflow. \n\n   for t=1: \n        pipe at lock0: in 1 second, delivers 1 liter -> fills lock0.\n        then the overflow from lock0 in the next second? but there is no next second because t=1.\n        so lock1 and lock2 are not filled.\n\n   Therefore, it's impossible.\n\n   So the time must be at least the maximum over i of ( the time until the water from the pipes reaches lock i and fills it ).\n\n   Specifically, the water for lock0 must be delivered by t. \n   for lock1: the water can come from pipe0 (overflow) and pipe1. \n        the water from pipe0 can only start after lock0 is full, which takes at least v0 seconds.\n        then the water for lock1: needs v1 seconds if we have a pipe at lock1 delivering throughout, but also the overflow from lock0 might deliver some.\n\n   This is very complex.\n\nGiven the time, and since the problem is known, we can look for an accepted solution in Python.\n\n Here is an accepted solution in Python for the problem \"River Locks\" (Codeforces Round #797 (Div. 3), problem C):\n\n   n = int(input())\n   v = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   low = 0\n   s = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        s += v[i]\n        if s < low:\n            low = s\n   # low is the minimum prefix sum\n\n   # We must start with at least 'init = -low' in the first lock to avoid negative.\n   init = -low\n   # Then the total water that must be delivered is init + s.\n   total = init + s\n\n   # The time to deliver the init water to the first lock: because the first lock can only be filled by a pipe at lock0, and we can have only one pipe at lock0, so it takes init seconds to deliver init liters to the first lock.\n   # Therefore, we require init <= t.\n   # Then, the total water to deliver is total, and we have t seconds, so the number of pipes must be at least ceil(total / t).\n   # However, note that after the first lock is full, the overflow can go to the next locks, and we can have multiple pipes.\n\n   # But also, the entire system must be filled within t seconds, so the total water total must be <= t * (number of pipes).\n\n   # Therefore, for a query t:\n   #   if t < init: then -1\n   #   else: the minimum number of pipes is ceil(total / t)\n\n   # For the sample [1,2,3]:\n   #   v = [1,2,3]\n   #   prefix: [1, 3, 6] -> low = 0.\n   #   init = 0.\n   #   total = 0+6=6.\n   #   for t=1: ceil(6/1)=6.\n   #   for t=3: ceil(6/3)=2.\n   #   for t=6: ceil(6/6)=1.\n   #   but the sample expects for t=1: -1.\n\n   # Why is t=1 impossible? because even with 6 pipes, we need 1 second to deliver 6 liters, but the first lock has volume 1 -> in the first second, the first lock gets 6 liters? -> it becomes full and overflows 5 to the next lock, then the next lock gets 5 and becomes full (volume2) and overflows 3 to the last lock, which then has 3, which is its volume. \n   # so it is possible with 6 pipes.\n\n   # Therefore, the sample test case in the problem statement might be using a different example.\n\n   # The sample provided in the problem statement for problem C is: \n        # There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1. \n        # We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes. \n\n   # So the first lock has volume 4. \n   # In the example test case: \n        n=5\n        volumes = [4, 1, 1, 4, 5] \n        queries: 1,2,3,4,5,6\n\n   # prefix: [4,5,6,10,15] -> low=0.\n   # init=0.\n   # total=15.\n   # for t=4: ceil(15/4)=4.\n   # for t=5: ceil(15/5)=3.\n   # for t=6: ceil(15/6)=3.\n\n   # But the example says for t=4: -1.\n\n   # Why? because the first lock requires 4 seconds to fill. With 4 pipes, in 4 seconds, we can deliver 16 liters. \n   # How does the water flow for the example [4,1,1,4,5] with 4 pipes open at locks0,1,2,3 (or any) and t=4 seconds:\n        lock0: gets 4 seconds * (1 if pipe0 open) -> 4 liters, becomes full.\n        lock1: \n            from pipe1: 4 seconds * (1 if pipe1 open) -> 4 liters.\n            from overflow of lock0: only after lock0 is full, which is at the end of second4, so overflow from lock0: 0 during the 4 seconds.\n            so lock1 has 4>=1 -> full, overflows 3 to lock2.\n        lock2: \n            from pipe2: 4 seconds * (1 if pipe2 open) -> 4 liters.\n            from overflow of lock1: 3 liters.\n            total 7>=1 -> full, overflows 6 to lock3.\n        lock3:\n            from pipe3: 4 seconds * (1 if pipe3 open) -> 4 liters.\n            from overflow of lock2: 6 liters.\n            total 10>=4 -> full, overflows 6 to lock4.\n        lock4: \n            from pipe4: if open, 4 seconds -> 4 liters.\n            from overflow of lock3: 6 liters.\n            total 10>=5 -> full.\n        So it is possible with 4 pipes.\n\n   Therefore, the example note that says \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\" might be for a different test case.\n\n   or the example note is for the sample [1,2,3] with queries including t=1 being -1 because with one second and any number of pipes, it's impossible to fill the first lock if its volume is 1? \n        but with one second and one pipe, we can fill the first lock. \n        then the second and third are not filled.\n\n   So for [1,2,3] and t=1, it's impossible to fill the entire system.\n\n   Therefore, the condition is: if the total water that must be delivered (init + tot) > t * n, then it's impossible? \n        but in [1,2,3] with t=1: init+tot=0+6=6, and t * n = 1 * 3 = 3 -> 6>3 -> so impossible, so output -1.\n\n   But then for [4,1,1,4,5] and t=4: init+tot=0+15=15, and t * n = 4 * 5 = 20 -> 15<=20, so possible.\n\n   So the solution might be: \n        if (init + tot) > t * n: then -1\n        else: ceil((init+tot)/t)\n\n   For [1,2,3] and t=1: 6 > 3 -> -1.\n   for [1,2,3] and t=3: 6<=9 -> ceil(6/3)=2.\n   for [1,2,3] and t=6: 6<=18 -> ceil(6/6)=1.\n\n   For [4,1,1,4,5] and t=4: 15<=20 -> ceil(15/4)=4.\n\n   But the example note for problem C says: for the sixth query ( which is t=6) in the example test ( which has volumes [4,1,1,4,5] ) the answer is 3.\n\n   and for the second query ( which is t=2) in the example test, the answer is 3.\n\n   for t=2: 15 > 2*5=10 -> 15>10 -> -1.\n   for t=5: 15<=5*5=25 -> ceil(15/5)=3.\n   for t=6: 15<=6*5=30 -> ceil(15/6)=3.\n\n   and for t=1,3,4: \n        t=1: 15>5 -> -1.\n        t=3: 15>15? no, 15<=15 -> ceil(15/3)=5.\n        t=4: 15<=20 -> ceil(15/4)=4.\n\n   But the example says for the second query ( which is t=2) is 3, not -1.\n\n   So this is not matching.\n\nGiven the complexity and the time, and since the problem is from a contest, the intended solution is the one with the initial water level to avoid negative prefix. And the condition is only on the initial water level and the total water.\n\nBut the sample test [1,2,3] with t=1: we must output -1, and the solution with if (0+6) > 1 * 3 -> 6>3 -> -1, which is correct.\n\n for the example test with [4,1,1,4,5]:\n   query1: t=1 -> 15>1*5=5 -> -1.\n   query2: t=2 -> 15>2*5=10 -> -1.\n   query3: t=3 -> 15>3*5=15 -> 15>15 is false, so 15<=15 -> ceil(15/3)=5.\n   query4: t=4 -> 15<=20 -> ceil(15/4)=4.\n   query5: t=5 -> ceil(15/5)=3.\n   query6: t=6 -> ceil(15/6)=3.\n\n   The example note says: queries 1,3,4 are -1 -> that would be t=1, t=3, t=4.\n   but our output for t=4 is 4, not -1.\n\n   and for t=3: we output 5, not -1.\n\n   So this does not match the example note.\n\nAfter re-reading the example note: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4\" -> so 3 pipes, and it works for t=5 seconds. \n   for t=5: our output is 3, which matches.\n\n   for the second query: \"Similarly, in the second query one can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\"\n   -> so the second query has t=5? then output 3.\n\n   for the fifth query: \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4.\" -> 4 pipes, and t=? the example doesn't specify the time for the fifth query.\n\n   The example input has queries: 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\n   If the second query is t=5, then our output for the second query is 3.\n   The sixth query is t=6, output 3.\n\n   then the fifth query is t=5? -> output 3, but the example says open 4 pipes.\n\n   or the fifth query is t=4? -> output 4.\n\n   So the example input might be:\n        n=5\n        volumes = [4,1,1,4,5]\n        q=6\n        queries = [1,5,3,4,4,6]\n\n   then:\n        query0: t=1 -> -1\n        query1: t=5 -> 3\n        query2: t=3 -> ceil(15/3)=5 (not -1) -> but the example says queries 1,3,4 are -1, so query2 (t=3) should be -1.\n\n   This is not matching.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the problem statement of program2.py is the one with the locks and the example note, and the example note says for the first example test ( which has 6 queries) the answers for queries 1,3,4 are -1, and for the sixth query ( which is the sixth) the answer is 3, and for the second query the answer is 3, and for the fifth query the answer is 4.\n\n   Therefore, the queries are:\n        query1: t=1 -> -1\n        query2: t=5 -> 3\n        query3: t=3 -> -1\n        query4: t=4 -> -1\n        query5: t=4 -> 4   (wait, but the example note says the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4 -> so 4, and it works for t=4 seconds? -> then output 4)\n        query6: t=6 -> 3\n\n   then the input would be:\n        1\n        5\n        4 1 1 4 5\n        6\n        1\n        5\n        3\n        4\n        4\n        6\n\n   and the output:\n        -1\n        3\n        -1\n        -1\n        4\n        3\n\n   For this input, with our last solution:\n        init = 0, total=15.\n        for t=1: 15>1*5=5 -> -1.\n        for t=5: ceil(15/5)=3.\n        for t=3: 15>3*5=15 -> 15>15 is false, so ceil(15/3)=5. (not -1)\n\n   So we must output 5 for t=3, but the example expects -1.\n\n   Therefore, we must have an additional constraint.\n\n   The intended solution in the editorial of the contest is: \n        if t < the initial water level ( which is -min_prefix) then -1.\n        else: ceil(( total + init ) / t)\n\n   For the example [4,1,1,4,5]:\n        min_prefix = 0, init=0.\n        for any t>=0, we never output -1.\n        for t=3: ceil(15/3)=5.\n        for t=4: ceil(15/4)=4.\n        for t=5: ceil(15/5)=3.\n        for t=6: ceil(15/6)=3.\n\n   which does not match the expected -1 for t=3 and t=4.\n\n   We must therefore try the solution with the per lock constraint.\n\n   We return to the first solution we considered: \n        m0 = max_i ceil(s_i/(i+1))\n        then for query t: \n             if t < m0: -1\n             else: ceil(s/t)   where s = total volume.\n\n   For [4,1,1,4,5]:\n        s0=4 -> ceil(4/1)=4.\n        s1=5 -> ceil(5/2)=3.\n        s2=6 -> ceil(6/3)=2.\n        s3=10 -> ceil(10/4)=3.\n        s4=15 -> ceil(15/5)=3.\n        m0 = 4.\n        then for t<4: -1.\n        for t=4: ceil(15/4)=4.\n        for t=5: ceil(15/5)=3.\n        for t=6: ceil(15/6)=3.\n\n   then the output for the example input [1,5,3,4,4,6] would be:\n        t=1: -1\n        t=5: 3\n        t=3: -1   [ because 3<4]\n        t=4: 4\n        t=4: 4\n        t=6: 3\n\n   but the example expects for the fourth query (t=4) -1, not 4.\n\n   and for the fifth query (t=4) 4, not -1.\n\n   This is a contradiction.\n\n   The example note says: for the sixth query ( which is t=6) the answer is 3, and for the second query ( which is t=5) the answer is 3, and for the fifth query ( which is t=4) the answer is 4.\n\n   and for the fourth query (t=4) the answer is -1.\n\n   So two queries with t=4: one outputs -1 and one outputs 4? \n\n   This is not possible.\n\nGiven the time, and since we must output the missing code for program2.py, and the TODO is in the loop over queries, and the example code in program2.py already computes:\n\n   p=0\n   m=0\n   for i,v in enumerate(I().split()):\n        p+=int(v)\n        m=max(m,(p+i)//(i+1))\n\n   then for each query t, we must output something.\n\n   and the note in the example code: for the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4 -> 4 pipes.\n\n   Therefore, for the fifth query ( which is t=4) the answer is 4.\n\n   and for the fourth query ( which is t=4) the answer is -1? that doesn't make sense.\n\n   Perhaps the example note has a different volumes array.\n\n   volumes = [0, -2, 3, -4] for program1.py, and for program2.py the example is independent.\n\n   We must output the code for program2.py based on the intended solution in the contest.\n\n   The intended solution in the contest for problem C is: \n        n = int(input())\n        v = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s = sum(v)\n        m = 0\n        current = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            current += v[i]\n            if current < 0:\n                # but wait, the solution we saw before with the prefix minimum\n                pass\n        # then for queries: \n        #   if t < ceil(s/n) or something else? \n\n   or the solution that passed is:\n\n   n = int(input())\n   a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n   s = sum(a)\n   m = 0\n   for i in range(n):\n        m = max(m, (sum(a[0:i+1]) + i) // (i+1) )\n   q = int(input())\n   for _ in range(q):\n        t = int(input())\n        if t < m:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((s + t - 1) // t)\n\n   For the sample [1,2,3]:\n        m = max( (1+0)//1=1, (3+1)//2=2, (6+2)//3=2) = 2.\n        then for t=1: 1<2 -> -1.\n        for t=2: 2>=2 -> ceil(6/2)=3.\n        for t=3: ceil(6/3)=2.\n        for t=6: ceil(6/6)=1.\n        but expected for t=3: 2, for t=6:1, for t=2:3, for t=1: -1.\n\n   For [4,1,1,4,5]:\n        m = max( (4+0)//1=4, (5+1)//2=3, (6+2)//3=2, (10+3)//4=13//4=3, (15+4)//5=19//5=3) = 4.\n        then for t<4: -1.\n        for t=4: ceil(15/4)=4.\n        for t=5: ceil(15/5)=3.\n        for t=6: ceil(15/6)=3.\n\n   then for the example input queries [1,5,3,4,4,6]:\n        1: -1\n        5: 3\n        3: -1\n        4: 4\n        4: 4\n        6: 3\n\n   which matches the expected output for the example not at least in the ones that are not -1.\n\n   and the example note says: \n        queries 1,3,4 are -1: in this output, query1 (t=1) and query3 (t=3) are -1, and query4 (t=4) is 4, not -1.\n        but the example note says query4 ( which is the fourth query) is -1.\n\n   unless the example note has a different indexing for the queries.\n\n   or the example note has a different test case.\n\n Given the instructions, we must output the missing code for program2.py as:\n\n   for _ in [0]*int(I()):\n        t = int(input())\n        if t < m:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((s + t - 1) // t)\n\n   where s = total sum = p at the end of the loop.\n\n   and m = the max we computed.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n        t = int(input())\n        if t < m:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   But note: after the loop, p is the total sum.\n\n   In the code: \n        p=0\n        for i,v in enumerate(I().split()):\n            p += int(v)\n            m = max(m, (p+i)// (i+1) )\n        then in the loop for queries, we have to use p (the total) and m.\n\n   So the missing code is these 5 lines.\n\n   However, the for loop is already there: for _ in [0]*int(I()): \n\n   So the TODO is to replace the TODO with the code for one query.\n\n   Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   if t < m:\n        print(-1)\n   else:\n        print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   But note: the input for each query is one integer, and we are using I() which is input, but in the program2.py code, they use I=input, so input() is the same as I().\n\n   Also, we must use integer division for ceiling: \n        ceil(a/b) = (a+b-1)//b\n\n   here a = p, b = t.\n\n   Therefore, (p + t - 1) // t.\n\n   But note: if p is 0, then (0+t-1)//t = (t-1)//t = 0, which is correct.\n\n   So for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n   t = int(input())\n   if t < m:\n        print(-1)\n   else:\n        print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   But note: the code might have to use // for integer division.\n\n   Let's test with the sample [1,2,3]:\n        p=6, m=2.\n        for t=2: (6+2-1)//2 = (7//2)=3.\n        for t=3: (6+3-1)//3 = (8//3)=2.\n        for t=6: (6+6-1)//6 = (11//6)=1.\n\n   which is the expected number of pipes.\n\n   Therefore, we use this.\n\n   For program1.py, the missing code is in the else branch of the modify method in the Seg class: \n        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\n\n   So we output:\n\n   {\n     \"program1\": \"        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\",\n     \"program2\": \"    t = int(input())\\n    if t < m:\\n        print(-1)\\n    else:\\n        print((p + t - 1) // t)\"\n   }\n\n   But note: the missing code in program1.py is only the one line in the else branch.\n\n   In program1.py, the TODO is in the else branch, and the solution is to call self.modify on the right child.\n\n   For program2.py, the missing code is the 5 lines (including the read) for the query.\n\n   However, the for loop in program2.py is:\n\n        for _ in [0]*int(I()):\n\n   and then the TODO. We replace the TODO with the code for one query.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program2.py missing part is:\n\n        t = int(input())\n        if t < m:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   But note: in the program2.py code, the input is read with I=input, and we are using input() which is now I, but the input for the query is from stdin.\n\n   Since the program2.py code uses: I=input, then input() is the same as I().\n\n   However, the code for the query might be: t = int(I()), but the given code in program2.py uses input in a different way: the first I() is for n, then I().split() for the volumes, then I() for q, and then for the queries.\n\n   In the code: \n        I=input;n=int(I());p=m=0\n        for i,v in enumerate(I().split()):\n            p+=int(v);m=max(m,(p+i)//(i+1))\n        for _ in [0]*int(I()):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So in the loop, we must read the query which is one integer.\n\n   Therefore, we use: t = int(I())\n\n   or since I is input, and input() returns a string, we can do: t = int(I().strip())\n\n   But the previous uses: for the number of queries: int(I()), and for the volumes: I().split().\n\n   So for the query, we can do: t = int(I())\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        t = int(I())\n        if t < m:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   But wait, the variables: m and p are defined in the outer scope.\n\n   Yes.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   program1: \"        self.modify(pos, x, p*2+1, mid, r)\"\n   program2: \"    t = int(I())\\n    if t < m:\\n        print(-1)\\n    else:\\n        print((p + t - 1) // t)\"\n\n   But note: in program2.py, the code is all in one line initially, but we can use newlines.\n\n   However, the given program2.py code has the for loop and then a comment, so we replace the TODO with the code, and we must indent properly.\n\n   The for loop is:\n\n        for _ in [0]*int(I()):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace with:\n\n        for _ in [0]*int(I()):\n            t = int(I())\n            if t < m:\n                print(-1)\n            else:\n                print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the inside of the for loop.\n\n   So in the JSON, for program2, we put the string for the inside of the for loop.\n\n   Alternatively, the TODO is only at one line, but we need to output multiple lines.\n\n   The instruction: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n   For program2.py, the missing code is the block for the for loop body.\n\n   So we output:\n\n        t = int(I())\n        if t < m:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   But note: the variable I is defined as input, and m and p are defined.\n\n   We output in the JSON as a string with newlines.\n\n   Let's format it.\n\n   We are to output only the missing code, not the for loop.\n\n   The for loop is already there.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the body of the for loop.\n\n   So we output the above 5 lines as a string.\n\n   However, in the given program2.py, the for loop is:\n\n        for _ in [0]*int(I()):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We must replace the TODO comment with the code.\n\n   So the missing code is the code that should be in the for loop.\n\n   Therefore, we output for program2: the string \n        \"t = int(I())\\nif t < m:\\n    print(-1)\\nelse:\\n    print((p + t - 1) // t)\"\n\n   But note: the indentation. In the for loop, the body is indented. The code we output should be with the same indentation as the TODO comment.\n\n   In the given code, the TODO is at the same indentation as the for loop body.\n\n   So we output the code with the same indentation level.\n\n   In the string, we use spaces for indentation. The original code uses 4 spaces per indent? or not specified.\n\n   Since the surrounding code in program2.py: \n        for _ in [0]*int(I()):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The TODO is indented by 4 spaces? or one level.\n\n   In Python, we can use any consistent. We will use 4 spaces for each indent level.\n\n   The if-else should be indented one level more than the for loop.\n\n   Therefore, the code for the for loop body should be:\n\n        t = int(I())\n        if t < m:\n            print(-1)\n        else:\n            print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   Each line is indented by 4 spaces more than the for loop.\n\n   Since the for loop is already there, and the body will be at one indent level, we output the code with the indent of 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   Alternatively, in the JSON string, we can output the code exactly as it should appear in the for loop body.\n\n   Therefore, for program2, the string is:\n\n        \"    t = int(I())\\n    if t < m:\\n        print(-1)\\n    else:\\n        print((p + t - 1) // t)\"\n\n   But note: the for loop already has one level of indent, so the body should be indented one more level. In the given code, the TODO is at that indent level.\n\n   So we output the code with an initial 4 spaces for the first line, and then the if-else with additional spaces.\n\n   Alternatively, to be safe, we output the code as it would be placed, with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\n   Since the TODO is at one level, we output the code at that level.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n   t = int(I())\n   if t < m:\n        print(-1)\n   else:\n        print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   but then we must indent within the for loop.\n\n   In the for loop, the body is typically indented. In the string, we can use:\n\n   \"t = int(I())\\nif t < m:\\n    print(-1)\\nelse:\\n    print((p + t - 1) // t)\"\n\n   and when placed in the for loop, it will be:\n\n        for _ in [0]*int(I()):\n            t = int(I())\n            if t < m:\n                print(-1)\n            else:\n                print((p + t - 1) // t)\n\n   This is valid Python if the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces.\n\n   Therefore, we output for program2: the string \"t = int(I())\\nif t < m:\\n    print(-1)\\nelse:\\n    print((p + t - 1) // t)\"\n\n   But note: the variable is 'p', not 's'. In the code, the total sum is in 'p'.\n\n   Yes.\n\n   So the final answer."
