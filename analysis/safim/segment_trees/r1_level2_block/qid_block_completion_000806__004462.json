The code uses if-elif, so if a1%3==0, we use the first branch. Otherwise, if a1%4==0, we use the last branch. For example, n=9: a1=8 -> 8%3 ! =0 -> then check 8%4==0 -> so we use the last branch. For n=5: a1=4 -> 4%3 ! =0 -> then 4%4==0 -> so we use the last branch: g=4//4=1 -> output (1,2,1,1) -> which is valid. But what about n=13? a1=12 -> 12%3==0 -> so we use the first branch: (12//3, 12//3, 12//3, 1) = (4,4,4,1) -> sum=4+4+4+1=13. Check: gcd(4,4)=4, lcm(4,1)=4 -> works. Alternatively, if we use the last branch for n=13: \n            g = (13-1)//4 = 12//4=3 -> output (3,6,3,1) -> sum=3+6+3+1=13, and gcd(3,6)=3, lcm(3,1)=3 -> works. But the problem says \"if there are several possible answers you can output any of them\". So both are acceptable. Therefore, we complete the branch for a1%4==0 by:\n\n            g = (n-1) // 4\n            print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\n        But note: the example test case n=10: \n            The example output: (3,5,1,1) -> because gcd(3,5)=1 and lcm(1,1)=1. How is n=10 handled? 10 is even -> so we go to the else branch (not the odd branch). The code for even: \n                else:\n                    a1 = a-2\n                    print(a1//2-1, a1//2+1, 1, 1)\n\n            For a=10: a1=8 -> then output (8//2-1, 8//2+1, 1, 1) = (4-1,4+1,1,1) = (3,5,1,1) -> which matches. So we don't have to worry about n=10. But what about n=17? It's odd -> a1=16 -> 16%3 ! =0 -> 16%4==0 -> so we use the last branch: g=(17-1)//4=16//4=4 -> output (4,8,4,1) -> sum=4+8+4+1=17. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py in the branch \"elif a1%4==0:\" is:\n\n            g = (a-1) // 4   # because a is the input n\n            print(g, 2*g, g, 1) But note: the variable in the code is `a` for the input. So we have:\n\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                g = (a-1) // 4\n                print(g, 2*g, g, 1)",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends and trying to have the same total weight while maximizing the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py does the following:\n1. It reads the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case, it reads n and the list of candy weights.\n3. It computes x = total sum of candies // 2 (since they want to be fair, the maximum each can have is at most half the total).\n4. Then it builds a dictionary `d` that maps a prefix sum to the number of candies (index+1) taken from the left until the prefix sum exceeds x (which is half the total).\n5. Then it computes a suffix sum and checks if that suffix sum is in the dictionary (meaning there was a prefix with the same sum). If so, then we can have a fair split. The total candies eaten in that case would be (prefix count) + (suffix count).\n\nHowever, the code after the second loop is incomplete. We need to complete the second loop to update `r` (the result) appropriately.\n\nSpecifically, in the second loop (which iterates the array in reverse to compute the suffix sum), we have:\n    s += i\n    if s in d:\n        ... # we need to update r\n\nWe want to update r to be the maximum total candies (prefix count + suffix count) for which the prefix sum equals the suffix sum. But note: the prefix and suffix must not overlap. The condition in the problem is that Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot eat the same candy.\n\nSo when we have a suffix sum `s` that is in the dictionary `d`, then we have a prefix of length `d[s]` and a suffix of length `idx+1` (because we are iterating from the right, and `idx` is 0-indexed in the reversed array, so the suffix length is `idx+1`). However, we must ensure that the prefix and suffix do not overlap. The total candies eaten would be `d[s] + (idx+1)`, but we must check that `d[s] + (idx+1) <= n` (which it should be because we broke the prefix loop when s exceeded x, and the suffix is taken from the other end). However, we must also note that the entire array might be covered? Actually, if the prefix and suffix together cover the entire array, that's acceptable only if the entire array is partitioned? But note: the problem says they can't eat the same candy, so the prefix and suffix must be disjoint.\n\nThe condition for non-overlap: the prefix ends at index `d[s]-1` (0-indexed) and the suffix starts at `n-1-idx` (0-indexed). We require that the prefix end is strictly to the left of the suffix start: `d[s]-1 < n-1-idx`  => `d[s] + (idx+1) < n+1` -> which is always true because the total candies eaten is at most n? Actually, we must avoid overlapping. But note: the problem does not require that the entire array is contiguous? Actually, the prefix is taken from the left and the suffix from the right, and they are contiguous. So if the prefix and suffix meet or cross, that would be an overlap.\n\nTherefore, we must only consider cases where the prefix and suffix do not overlap. The condition is: `d[s] + (idx+1) <= n`. But note: if they exactly meet, then the middle candy is not eaten? Actually, the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot skip, so they eat contiguous segments from the ends. The segments are disjoint if the prefix ends before the suffix starts.\n\nBut note: the entire array might be partitioned? Actually, the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\". So if the prefix and suffix together cover the entire array, that's acceptable. However, we must check that the prefix and suffix do not share any candy. The condition for non-overlap is: the prefix covers indices [0, d[s]-1] and the suffix covers [n - (idx+1), n-1]. We require that d[s] <= n - (idx+1). So the next candy after the prefix is at index d[s] and the suffix starts at n - (idx+1). We require d[s] <= n - (idx+1). But note: if d[s] == n - (idx+1), then the candy at that index is not assigned? Actually, the prefix ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix starts at n - (idx+1). So if d[s] == n - (idx+1), then the prefix ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix starts at d[s] (so no overlap). Therefore, the condition is that the prefix and suffix are disjoint as long as the prefix length plus the suffix length is at most n.\n\nBut note: the problem says they can eat any number from their end, but they cannot skip. So the segments are contiguous from the ends and disjoint by the structure.\n\nTherefore, when we find a suffix sum `s` that is in the dictionary, we can update:\n    total_candies = d[s] + (idx+1)\n    and we want the maximum total_candies over all such s.\n\nHowever, note that the same sum might appear multiple times? But the dictionary `d` stores the first occurrence (lowest index) for a given prefix sum? Actually, we break the prefix loop when s exceeds x, and we store the prefix sum and the number of candies. Since we are going from left to right, we store the earliest occurrence of a prefix sum? But note: we want the maximum total candies, so we want the prefix with the smallest number of candies for a given sum? Actually, no: we want the prefix with the largest number of candies? Actually, we store the prefix sum and the count (which is the index+1). And we break when the prefix sum exceeds x. So for a given sum, we store the first time we achieve that sum? Actually, we store the last time we achieved a sum? Because we break when exceeding x, and we are storing every step until we break. But note: we are storing the prefix sum at every step until we break. So for a given sum, we store the last occurrence? Actually, we store the last occurrence because we are iterating and updating for every index until we break. But if the same sum appears again? Actually, the prefix sums are strictly increasing because all weights are positive. So each prefix sum is unique? Actually, no: it's possible to have the same prefix sum? But the weights are positive, so the prefix sums are strictly increasing. Therefore, each prefix sum is unique.\n\nSo the dictionary `d` has unique keys.\n\nTherefore, in the second loop, when we have a suffix sum `s` that is in `d`, then we can compute the total candies as `d[s] + (idx+1)`. We then update `r` to be the maximum of these total candies.\n\nBut note: the problem says that they can also choose to eat zero candies? The problem says \"non-zero\" in the example? Actually, the example says for the third test case the answer is 0. So we must consider the possibility of 0.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" and the condition is that the total weight eaten by Alice equals that by Bob.\n\nIn the provided code, `r` is initialized to 0. So if we don't find any matching sum, then 0 is printed.\n\nTherefore, we can complete the second loop as:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d:\n            # Check non-overlap: the prefix has d[s] candies, the suffix has idx+1 candies, and we require d[s] + (idx+1) <= n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the condition `d[s] + (idx+1) <= n` is necessary? Actually, because the entire array has n candies, and we are taking d[s] from the left and (idx+1) from the right, the total is d[s] + (idx+1). This total cannot exceed n. So the condition is always true? Actually, it is possible that the prefix and suffix overlap? How? The prefix covers indices [0, d[s]-1] and the suffix covers [n - (idx+1), n-1]. The condition for non-overlap is that the prefix ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix starts at n - (idx+1). We require that d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. But note: if d[s] + (idx+1) == n, then the entire array is covered? Actually, the prefix and suffix together cover the entire array? Then the condition is satisfied? But note: the candy at position d[s] to n - (idx+1)-1 is not eaten? Actually, if d[s] + (idx+1) == n, then the entire array is partitioned: the prefix covers [0, d[s]-1] and the suffix covers [d[s], n-1]? Actually, the suffix starts at n - (idx+1) and goes to n-1. The number of candies in the suffix is (idx+1). So the suffix covers the last (idx+1) candies. The prefix covers the first d[s] candies. The condition for non-overlap is that the two segments do not share any candy. The last candy of the prefix is at index d[s]-1 and the first candy of the suffix is at index n - (idx+1). We require that d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) < n+1, which is always true because d[s] and (idx+1) are at most n. But if d[s] + (idx+1) == n, then the suffix starts at index n - (idx+1) = d[s] (because d[s] = n - (idx+1)). Then the prefix ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix starts at d[s] -> no overlap. So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, we don't need an extra condition? We can just update:\n\n    if s in d:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the suffix sum might be found in the dictionary, but the total candies might be more than n? Actually, d[s] is at most n, and (idx+1) is at most n, but their sum might be more than n? How? The prefix and suffix are disjoint only if the two segments do not overlap. The maximum total candies without overlap is n. But if d[s] + (idx+1) > n, then there is an overlap? Actually, we are iterating the suffix from the right. The prefix is built from the left until the sum exceeds x (half the total). The suffix is built from the right until the entire array is covered? But note: the condition for non-overlap is that the prefix and suffix do not share any candy. The total number of candies eaten is d[s] + (idx+1). This number must be at most n. But if it is more than n, that would be impossible. However, because the entire array has n candies, and we are taking two disjoint sets, the total cannot exceed n. Therefore, d[s] + (idx+1) is always <= n? Actually, no: because the prefix and suffix might overlap? How? Consider: \n    n=5, and suppose we have a prefix of 3 candies and a suffix of 3 candies. Then 3+3=6>5 -> but that would be impossible because there are only 5 candies. \n\nBut note: the prefix and suffix are taken from the two ends. The prefix is the first d[s] candies, the suffix is the last (idx+1) candies. The condition for non-overlap is that the two segments do not share any candy. This requires that the entire array is at least d[s] + (idx+1) in length? Actually, the array has n candies. The two segments are disjoint if the prefix ends before the suffix starts. The condition is: d[s] <= n - (idx+1). Then the total candies eaten is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. So if we have d[s] + (idx+1) > n, then the condition d[s] <= n - (idx+1) fails. Therefore, we must check that the two segments do not overlap.\n\nBut note: the dictionary `d` was built for the entire array? Actually, the prefix loop breaks when the prefix sum exceeds x (half the total). The suffix loop goes until the entire array is traversed? Actually, the suffix loop iterates over the reversed array, so it goes from the last element to the first. But we break the prefix loop when the prefix sum exceeds x, so the prefix dictionary only has sums that are <= x. The suffix sum also starts from the right and increases. When we get a suffix sum that is in the dictionary, we must check that the two segments do not overlap.\n\nTherefore, we must check: if the prefix length plus the suffix length is at most n, then they are disjoint? Actually, the condition for disjointness is: \n    prefix_length + suffix_length <= n   [because the entire array has n candies, and if the two segments are disjoint, then the total number of candies in the two segments is prefix_length+suffix_length, which must be <= n]\n\nBut note: the entire array might have more than prefix_length+suffix_length? Then the condition is that the two segments are disjoint? Actually, the condition is that the prefix segment [0, prefix_length-1] and the suffix segment [n-suffix_length, n-1] do not overlap. This happens if and only if prefix_length <= n - suffix_length. This is equivalent to prefix_length + suffix_length <= n.\n\nSo we can check: if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then they are disjoint? Actually, no: because the condition for non-overlap is that the prefix ends at d[s]-1 and the suffix starts at n - (idx+1). We require d[s] <= n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. So the condition is the same.\n\nTherefore, we can update:\n\n    if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the entire array is n, so d[s] + (idx+1) cannot exceed n? Actually, it can be less than or equal to n. And if it is equal to n, that's acceptable (as discussed). So we can do:\n\n    if s in d:\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is always true? Because d[s] is the number of candies in the prefix and (idx+1) is the number in the suffix, and they are disjoint? Actually, they are disjoint only if the prefix and suffix do not cover the same candy. The condition for disjointness is d[s] <= n - (idx+1). Then the total candies is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. So the condition is necessary to avoid overlapping? Actually, the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is equivalent to the disjointness condition? Yes.\n\nBut note: it is possible that the prefix and suffix overlap? How? Only if the prefix and suffix together cover more than n candies? That's impossible. Actually, the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is always true? Because the entire array has n candies. But wait: the prefix and suffix might cover the same candy? Then the total distinct candies would be less than d[s] + (idx+1). But the problem states that they cannot eat the same candy. So we must avoid that. Therefore, we must check that the two segments are disjoint. The condition is d[s] <= n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. So we can use that.\n\nBut note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary and sufficient? Yes.\n\nHowever, note that the prefix and suffix are taken from the two ends, so the condition for non-overlap is that the prefix does not extend into the suffix. The condition is: the last index of the prefix (d[s]-1) must be less than the first index of the suffix (n - (idx+1)). This is equivalent to d[s] <= n - (idx+1). And that is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n    if s in d:\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is always true? Actually, no: because the prefix and suffix might overlap? How? Consider: \n    n=3, and we have a prefix of 2 candies and a suffix of 2 candies. Then 2+2=4>3 -> but that would be an overlap. \n\nBut how can we get a prefix of 2 and a suffix of 2 in an array of 3? The prefix would be the first two, the suffix would be the last two. Then the middle candy is counted twice? Actually, the suffix of 2 would be the last two: indices 1 and 2. The prefix would be indices 0 and 1. Then the candy at index 1 is in both. So we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, we must check that the two segments are disjoint. The condition is d[s] <= n - (idx+1). \n\nBut note: in the example above, d[s]=2, (idx+1)=2, then 2 <= 3-2 -> 2<=1 -> false. So we skip.\n\nSo we must check the condition. However, the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is equivalent? Actually, 2+2=4>3 -> so we skip. So we can use the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, that condition is not equivalent to the disjointness condition. The disjointness condition is d[s] <= n - (idx+1). This is equivalent to d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Yes, because we are adding (idx+1) to both sides? Actually, no: \n    d[s] <= n - (idx+1)   <=>   d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\nSo they are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n    if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary to avoid overlap. However, the problem states that the entire array has n candies, and we are taking two segments from the ends. The maximum without overlap is n. But the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is always true? Actually, no: as in the example above (n=3, prefix=2, suffix=2 -> 4>3). So we must check.\n\nTherefore, we complete the code in program1.py as:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the problem says the total candies eaten is the number of candies (count) and we are maximizing that.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the same suffix sum might appear multiple times? But the suffix sum is strictly increasing? Because we are adding positive numbers. So each suffix sum is unique? Actually, the suffix sum is computed from the right, and the weights are positive, so the suffix sum is strictly increasing as we add more from the right. Therefore, each suffix sum is unique.\n\nSo we can break early? Actually, we don't need to. We want the maximum total candies, so we have to check every suffix that matches a prefix.\n\nBut note: the suffix sum might exceed x? Actually, we don't break the suffix loop. We go through the entire array? But the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the condition `d[s] + (idx+1) <= n` is necessary to avoid overlap. We must include it.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: For each test case, we are given an integer n (>=4) and we must find four positive integers a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d=n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d).\n\nThe provided code handles:\n    if a % 4 == 0: then we output (a//4, a//4, a//4, a//4)\n    else:\n        if a % 2 == 1 (i.e., odd): \n            then it sets a1 = a-1 (so now a1 is even) and then:\n                if a1 % 3 == 0: then output (a1//3, a1//3, a1//3, 1)\n                elif a1 % 4 != 0: then set a1 = a-2 and output (a1//2, a1//2+1, 1, 1)\n                elif a1 % 4 == 0: then ... (we have to complete this branch)\n\nBut note: the example test cases:\n\n    n=4: (1,1,1,1) -> handled by the first branch (4%4==0) -> (1,1,1,1) -> gcd(1,1)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n    n=7: 7%4 !=0 -> then 7 is odd -> a1=6 -> 6%3==0 -> (2,2,2,1) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\n    n=8: 8%4==0 -> (2,2,2,2) -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> works.\n\n    n=9: 9%4 !=0 -> odd? 9 is odd -> a1=8 -> 8%3 !=0 -> then 8%4==0? Actually, 8%4==0 -> so we go to the branch we have to complete.\n\n    But the example output for n=9 is (2,4,2,1) -> 2+4+2+1=9, and gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\n    How do we get (2,4,2,1) from the branch a1=8 (which is 8) and a1%4==0?\n\n    We have to output four numbers: a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d = n = 9.\n\n    The branch: a1 = a-1 = 8, and 8%4==0 -> then we are in the branch that we have to complete.\n\n    We note that the example output is (2,4,2,1). How can we relate that to 8? \n\n    Alternatively, the problem says that we can output any solution.\n\n    We need to assign four numbers. We have a1 = n-1 = 8. We are in the branch where 8 is divisible by 4. Then we can do:\n\n        We want to set a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d = n = 9.\n\n        We can try: \n            Let g = 2 (for example). Then we require gcd(a,b)=2 and lcm(c,d)=2.\n\n        How to set a and b? They must be multiples of 2. And we require gcd(a,b)=2. We can set a=2, b=2? Then a+b=4. Then c+d=5. And we require lcm(c,d)=2. The numbers c and d must be divisors of 2? So they can be 1 and 2? Then 1+2=3, but we need 5. Alternatively, we can set a=2, b=4 -> then gcd(2,4)=2. Then a+b=6. Then c+d=3. And we require lcm(c,d)=2. We can set c=1, d=2 -> then lcm(1,2)=2. That gives (2,4,1,2) -> but the example output is (2,4,2,1). Same.\n\n        So we can output: (2,4,1,2) or (2,4,2,1). \n\n        How to generate this? \n\n        We have n=9. We are in the branch: \n            a1 = n-1 = 8, and 8%4==0.\n\n        We can set:\n            a = 2, b = 4, c = 1, d = 2 -> but note: the example output is (2,4,2,1) -> same.\n\n        How to compute these from n? \n\n        We note that we want:\n            a = 2, b = 4 -> a+b = 6, then c+d = 3. And we set c=2, d=1? Actually, the example output is (2,4,2,1). \n\n        But note: the example output for n=9 is (2,4,2,1). \n\n        How about: \n            a = 2, b = 2 * (k) for some k? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let g be a divisor we choose. We set a = g, b = g * k, then gcd(a,b)=g. And we set c and d such that lcm(c,d)=g. \n\n        We know that lcm(c,d)=g, so both c and d must be divisors of g. We can set c=1, d = g? Then lcm(1,g)=g. But then we have:\n            a + b + c + d = g + g*k + 1 + g = g*(k+2) + 1 = n.\n\n        For n=9: \n            g*(k+2) + 1 = 9 -> g*(k+2)=8.\n\n        We can choose g=2, then 2*(k+2)=8 -> k+2=4 -> k=2 -> then b=2*2=4. So we get (2,4,1,2) -> but that sums to 2+4+1+2=9. \n\n        However, the example output is (2,4,2,1). But that is the same set.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and the order of a, b, c, d? The example output is (2,4,2,1). So we can output (2,4,1,2) as well? The problem says \"output any\".\n\n        However, the example output for n=9 is (2,4,2,1). How do we get 2 and 1 for c and d? Actually, we can set c=2, d=1? Then lcm(2,1)=2. So that works.\n\n        So we can set: \n            a = g, b = g * k, c = g, d = 1? Then the sum: g + g*k + g + 1 = g*(k+2)+1 = n.\n\n        For n=9: g*(k+2)=8. We choose g=2, then k=2 -> b=4. Then output (2,4,2,1). \n\n        How to compute g and k? We have g*(k+2) = n-1. And we are in the branch where n-1 is divisible by 4? Actually, the condition is a1%4==0, meaning (n-1) % 4 == 0. So n-1 is divisible by 4. Then we can set g=2? Then 2*(k+2)=n-1 -> k+2 = (n-1)//2. Then k = (n-1)//2 - 2. Then b = g * k = 2 * ((n-1)//2 - 2) = (n-1) - 4.\n\n        Then the four numbers are:\n            a = 2\n            b = (n-1) - 4\n            c = 2\n            d = 1\n\n        Then the sum: 2 + (n-1-4) + 2 + 1 = (n-1) - 4 + 5 = n. \n\n        But check: for n=9: \n            a=2, b= (9-1)-4 = 8-4=4, c=2, d=1 -> (2,4,2,1) -> works.\n\n        But what if n-1-4 is positive? Since n>=4, and in this branch n is at least 5 (because n-1 divisible by 4, so n>=5). Then (n-1)>=4, so b = n-5 >= 0? But we require positive integers. For n=5: \n            a1 = 4 -> divisible by 4 -> then we use this branch.\n            a=2, b= (5-1)-4 = 0 -> not positive.\n\n        So we cannot use g=2 for n=5? \n\n        We must choose g appropriately. \n\n        Alternatively, we can set g= (n-1)//4? Then we have:\n            g*(k+2) = n-1 -> k+2 = 4 -> k=2. Then b = g * 2 = 2g. Then the numbers: a = g, b = 2g, c = g, d = 1. Then the sum: g+2g+g+1 = 4g+1 = n. But we have n-1 = 4g -> so 4g+1 = n -> which is true. \n\n        For n=5: g = (5-1)//4 = 1. Then a=1, b=2, c=1, d=1 -> (1,2,1,1). Check: \n            gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works. \n            Sum=1+2+1+1=5.\n\n        For n=9: g=(9-1)//4=2. Then (2,4,2,1) -> works.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            g = (n-1) // 4\n            Then output: (g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\n        But note: we must have g>=1? Since n>=5 and n-1 divisible by 4, then g>=1.\n\n        However, what if n-1 is divisible by 4 but g might not be an integer? But we are doing integer division? Actually, the condition is that (n-1)%4==0, so (n-1)//4 is an integer.\n\n        Therefore, for the branch a1%4==0, we can output:\n\n            g = (n-1) // 4\n            print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\n        But note: the example output for n=9 is (2,4,2,1) -> which is (g, 2*g, g, 1) with g=2.\n\n        However, the problem says \"positive integers\". The numbers: g, 2g, g, 1 are positive? Since g>=1, yes.\n\n        But what if n-1 is divisible by 4 and also by 3? Then we have two branches: \n            if a1%3==0: then we output (a1//3, a1//3, a1//3, 1)\n            elif a1%4!=0: ... \n            elif a1%4==0: ...\n\n        The code uses if-elif, so if a1%3==0, we use the first branch. Otherwise, if a1%4==0, we use the last branch.\n\n        For example, n=9: a1=8 -> 8%3 !=0 -> then check 8%4==0 -> so we use the last branch.\n\n        For n=5: a1=4 -> 4%3 !=0 -> then 4%4==0 -> so we use the last branch: g=4//4=1 -> output (1,2,1,1) -> which is valid.\n\n        But what about n=13? \n            a1=12 -> 12%3==0 -> so we use the first branch: (12//3, 12//3, 12//3, 1) = (4,4,4,1) -> sum=4+4+4+1=13. \n            Check: gcd(4,4)=4, lcm(4,1)=4 -> works.\n\n        Alternatively, if we use the last branch for n=13: \n            g = (13-1)//4 = 12//4=3 -> output (3,6,3,1) -> sum=3+6+3+1=13, and gcd(3,6)=3, lcm(3,1)=3 -> works.\n\n        But the problem says \"if there are several possible answers you can output any of them\". So both are acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we complete the branch for a1%4==0 by:\n\n            g = (n-1) // 4\n            print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\n        But note: the example test case n=10: \n            The example output: (3,5,1,1) -> because gcd(3,5)=1 and lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n        How is n=10 handled? \n            10 is even -> so we go to the else branch (not the odd branch). \n            The code for even: \n                else:\n                    a1 = a-2\n                    print(a1//2-1, a1//2+1, 1, 1)\n\n            For a=10: a1=8 -> then output (8//2-1, 8//2+1, 1, 1) = (4-1,4+1,1,1) = (3,5,1,1) -> which matches.\n\n        So we don't have to worry about n=10.\n\n        But what about n=17? \n            It's odd -> a1=16 -> 16%3 !=0 -> 16%4==0 -> so we use the last branch: g=(17-1)//4=16//4=4 -> output (4,8,4,1) -> sum=4+8+4+1=17.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py in the branch \"elif a1%4==0:\" is:\n\n            g = (a-1) // 4   # because a is the input n\n            print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\n        But note: the variable in the code is `a` for the input. So we have:\n\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                g = (a-1) // 4\n                print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\n        However, note: we are inside the block where a is odd. And we set a1 = a-1. But we don't use a1 for g? We use a (the original n). \n\n        Alternatively, we can use: g = a1 // 4, because a1 = a-1. So:\n\n            g = a1 // 4   # since a1 is divisible by 4\n\n        Then we output (g, 2*g, g, 1). \n\n        This is the same as (a1//4, 2*(a1//4), a1//4, 1). \n\n        For n=9: a1=8, g=8//4=2 -> (2,4,2,1) -> works.\n\n        For n=5: a1=4, g=1 -> (1,2,1,1) -> works.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            g = a1 // 4\n            print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\n        This is equivalent and uses a1.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    g = a1 // 4\n    print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\nBut note: the code structure:\n\n    if a%4==0:\n        ...\n    else:\n        if a%2==1:\n            a1 = a-1\n            if a1%3==0:\n                ...\n            elif a1%4!=0:\n                ...\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                g = a1 // 4\n                print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\n        else:\n            ... # even but not divisible by 4\n\nNow, we output the missing code for both programs in the specified JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the block inside the second loop for the condition `if s in d:`, which is:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the code in the second loop is:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe must complete the TODO. We write the block above.\n\nBut note: the indentation. The entire block must be indented appropriately. However, the problem says to output only the missing code. So we output:\n\n        if s in d:\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is for the branch `elif a1%4==0:`, which is:\n\n        g = a1 // 4\n        print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\nBut note: the existing code has:\n\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with the two lines.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"        if s in d:\\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"        g = a1 // 4\\n        print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code has an extra closing parenthesis in the existing code? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n        else:\n            if a%2==1:\n                a1=(a-1)\n                if a1%3==0:\n                    print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n                elif a1%4!=0:\n                    a1=a-2\n                    print(a1//2,a1//2+1,1,1)\n                elif a1%4==0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO. We must be careful: the existing code has an extra closing parenthesis in the print statements? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n    print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)   -> three closing parentheses? Actually, that's a syntax error.\n\nWait, the provided code for program2.py:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\r\n    a=int(input())\r\n    if a%4==0:\r\n        print(a//4,a//4,a//4,a//4)\r\n    else:\r\n        if a%2==1:\r\n            a1=(a-1)\r\n            if a1%3==0:\r\n                print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\r\n            elif a1%4!=0:\r\n                a1=a-2\r\n                print(a1//2,a1//2+1,1,1)\r\n            elif a1%4==0:\r\n                # TODO: Your code here\r\n        else:\r\n            a1=a-2\r\n            print(a1//2-1,a1//2+1,1,1)\r\n        \r\n    \n\nThe print statements have the correct number of parentheses? Actually, the first print in the branch a1%3==0: \n    print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1) -> that's four arguments, so it's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the next print: \n    print(a1//2,a1//2+1,1,1) -> four arguments.\n\nSo the code we output for program2.py must be:\n\n        g = a1 // 4\n        print(g, 2*g, g, 1)\n\nBut note: the existing code uses integer division (//) and we do the same.\n\nTherefore, the final answer."
