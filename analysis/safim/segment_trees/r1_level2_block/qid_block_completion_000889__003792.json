However, the input specification for the entire problem: \n          The first line t (1<=t<=100), and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5.

There is a discrepancy. I see: the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string\" with i<j.\n\n          In the list:\n\n            Let the strings be indexed 0 to 6:\n\n               0: ab\n               1: cb\n               2: db\n               3: aa\n               4: cc\n               5: ef\n               6: ff\n\n          The pairs with i<j:\n\n            (0,1): ab, cb -> valid. (0,2): ab, db -> valid. (0,3): ab, aa -> valid. (0,4): ab, cc -> both differ? -> no.\n            (0,5): ab, ef -> both differ? -> no.\n            (0,6): ab, ff -> both differ? -> no. (1,2): cb, db -> valid. (1,3): cb, aa -> both differ -> no.\n            (1,4): cb, cc -> valid. (1,5): cb, ef -> both differ -> no.\n            (1,6): cb, ff -> both differ -> no.\n\n            (2,3): db, aa -> both differ -> no.\n            (2,4): db, cc -> both differ -> no.\n            (2,5): db, ef -> both differ -> no.\n            (2,6): db, ff -> both differ -> no.\n\n            (3,4): aa, cc -> both differ -> no.\n            (3,5): aa, ef -> both differ -> no.\n            (3,6): aa, ff -> both differ -> no.\n\n            (4,5): cc, ef -> both differ -> no.\n            (4,6): cc, ff -> both differ -> no.\n\n            (5,6): ef, ff -> valid. So the valid pairs with i<j are:\n\n            (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,4), (5,6) -> 6 pairs. But the example says the valid pairs are:\n\n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\n          That is: \n            (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,4) -> 5 pairs.",

So that doesn't work. Another known solution (from a known contest) for the same problem:\n\n        We define:\n          Let x[0] = 0\n          Let x[1] = A[0]   (so that the first element becomes 0: because the operation at index1 will subtract from index0? but we haven't done anything to index0) Then for i from 2 to n-1:\n          x[i] = A[i-1] - x[i-1] - x[i-2]\n\n        Then the condition for the last element: A[n-1] must equal x[n-2] + x[n-1]? But in the example: \n          n=7, A = [2, -1, 3, 1, 4, -2, 9]\n\n          x0 = 0\n          x1 = 2\n          x2 = A[1] - x1 - x0 = -1 - 2 - 0 = -3 -> negative -> invalid, so we output -1? but the example says 4 operations. This does not match. After rethinking:\n\n   We can write the equations for the final values:\n\n        f0 = A0 + x1\n        f1 = A1 + x2 - x1\n        f2 = A2 + x3 - x2 + x1   -> because an operation at index1 (x1 times) adds x1 to index0 and index2, and an operation at index2 (x2 times) adds x2 to index1 and index3, and then the operation at index2 also subtracts the original value? Actually, the operation at index i (0-indexed) does:\n        A[i-1] becomes A[i-1] + A[i]   -> but note the A[i] at the time of operation is the current value at i, which might have been changed by previous operations? This is a linear system?",

Actually, the known solution in the contest (from a known AC submission) is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split())) if n == 1:\n                    print(0)\n                    continue\n                x = [0] * n\n                x[0] = 0\n                x[1] = a[0]\n                for i in range(2, n):\n                    x[i] = a[i-1] - x[i-1] - x[i-2]\n                if x[n-1] + x[n-2] ! = a[n-1]:\n                    print(-1)\n                else:\n                    if min(x) < 0:\n                        print(-1)\n                    else:\n                        print(sum(x[1:-1]))\n\n        But note: the example input: \n            n=7, a = [2, -1, 3, 1, 4, -2, 9]\n\n        Then:\n            x0 = 0\n            x1 = a0 = 2\n            x2 = a1 - x1 - x0 = -1 - 2 - 0 = -3 -> negative -> so we output -1? But the example output is 4. So what is the issue?",

Let x_i be the number of times we apply the operation at position i (0-indexed, for i in [1, n-2]). Note that an operation can be applied multiple times.\n\n Then, the final value at each position j can be expressed as:\n   A0_j = A_j \n          + (if j-1 is in [1, n-2])? x_{j-1} * A_{j}   [because when we operate at j-1, we add A_{j-1} to j, but note that A_{j-1} itself changes?]\n\n However, the operation affects adjacent elements and the operation at a given index affects the next and previous. Moreover, the operation flips the sign at the center.\n\n After some known similar problems (like CodeForces problems) and known solutions, we can use the following:\n\n Let's define:\n   For even-indexed positions (0-indexed) and odd-indexed positions, the operations form a linear system.\n\n Alternatively, note that the problem has been solved in known contests. One known solution:\n\n   We can define:\n     Let x0 = A0\n     Let x1 = A1\n     For i>=2: \n        We have: A_i = x_i - x_{i-1} - x_{i-2}   ??? \n\n But actually, we can model the effect of operations as:\n\n   Consider the transformation as a linear system. Let x_i be the number of times we apply the operation at position i (for i from 1 to n-2, 0-indexed).\n\n   Then the final value at:\n      position 0: A0 + x1 * A1? \n\n Actually, we can write:\n\n   Let the initial array be A, and let the vector of operations be x (of length n, but only indices 1 to n-2 are used, so x[0] and x[n-1] are 0?).\n\n   Then the final value at index i is:\n      f_i = A_i + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} - x_i   ??? \n\n But note the operation at i: \n   It adds A_i to A_{i-1} and A_{i+1}, and then sets A_i to -A_i.\n\n   However, if we do x_i operations at i, then:\n\n   Consider the contribution of an operation at j to the element at i:\n      - If i = j, then the operation at j flips the sign and we also subtract the original value? Actually, each operation at j multiplies the value at j by -1 and then also adds the original value (but note the original value is changing) so it's linear only if we consider the entire system.\n\n Alternatively, we can write the equations:\n\n   f0 = A0 + x1\n   f1 = A1 + x0 + x2 - x1   ... but note we don't have x0.\n\n Actually, we can write:\n\n   f0 = A0 + x1\n   f1 = A1 + x2 - x1 + x0? -> but x0 is not allowed (operations only from index1 to n-2). So we set x0=0 and x_{n-1}=0.\n\n   Then:\n      f0 = A0 + x1\n      f1 = A1 + x2 - x1\n      f2 = A2 + x3 - x2 + x1   -> wait, because an operation at index1 (which is j=1) adds to index0 and index2. Then an operation at index2 (j=2) adds to index1 and index3, and also flips the sign at index2.\n\n   Actually, the operation at j (0-indexed) adds the value at j to j-1 and j+1, and then sets j to -value. But note that the value at j at the time of operation might have been changed by previous operations.\n\n   This is complex because of the sign flip. However, note that we can do multiple operations arbitrarily. \n\n   Known solution approach (from CodeForces) for this problem:\n\n   We note that the problem is about \"Lemper Cooking Competition\". There is a known solution:\n\n      Let n = number of stoves.\n      We are going to define an array x of length n, but we set:\n          x0 = 0\n          x1 = A0\n          Then for i from 2 to n-1: \n             x_i = A_{i-1} + x_{i-2}   [but then we require that the final value at i-1 becomes 0?]\n\n      Actually, we want non-negative, but the known solution uses:\n\n          We define:\n            x[0] = 0\n            x[1] = A[0]\n            for i in range(2, n):\n                x[i] = A[i-1] - x[i-1] - x[i-2]\n\n          Then the final value at position i (for i from 0 to n-1) is:\n            f0 = A0 - x0 - x1? \n\n      But note: the operation at a stove i (0-indexed) is represented by x_i? and the effect is:\n\n          f0 = A0 - x1\n          f1 = A1 - x0 - x2 + x1? \n\n      Actually, the known solution in CodeForces for this problem (problem C in a contest) is:\n\n          We set:\n            x[0] = 0\n            x[1] = A[0]\n            for i in range(2, n):\n                x[i] = A[i-1] - x[i-1] - x[i-2]\n\n          Then we require:\n            A[n-1] == x[n-2] + x[n-1]   (for the last element)\n\n          And for the final array to be non-negative, we require:\n            For each i from 0 to n-2: x[i] >= 0\n            For each i from 0 to n-1: the value at the last element condition and also the intermediate values?\n\n      Actually, the final value at position i (for i from 0 to n-1) is:\n\n          f0 = A0 - x1   -> but we set x1 = A0, so f0 = 0? \n          f1 = A1 - x0 - x2 = A1 - 0 - x2 = A1 - (A0 - x1) ??? \n\n      Alternatively, we can derive:\n\n          After the operations, the value at position 0: \n             We have an operation at index1 (if we do x1 times) that adds x1 * (original value at index1) to index0? But note the original value at index1 is changed by operations at index2? \n\n      This is complex.\n\n   Actually, known solution from a CodeForces submission for the same problem:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            if n == 1:\n                print(0 if arr[0] == 0 else -1)\n                continue\n            x = [0] * n\n            x[0] = 0\n            x[1] = arr[0]\n            valid = True\n            for i in range(2, n):\n                x[i] = arr[i-1] - x[i-1] - x[i-2]\n            if x[n-1] + x[n-2] != arr[n-1]:\n                valid = False\n            if min(x) < 0:\n                valid = False\n            if not valid:\n                print(-1)\n            else:\n                # Count the number of operations? But note: the operations are represented by x? \n                # Actually, the operations are the x_i for i in [1, n-2]? \n                # But note: the problem asks for the minimum number of operations. How is x related to the operations?\n                # In fact, each x_i (for i from 1 to n-2) is the number of times we applied the operation at position i? \n                # Then the total operations would be the sum of x[1:n-1]? \n                total_ops = sum(x[1:n-1])\n                print(total_ops)\n\n   However, let's test with the example: \n        Example: n=7, A = [2, -1, 3, 1, 4, -2, 9]\n\n        We set:\n          x0 = 0\n          x1 = A0 = 2\n          x2 = A1 - x1 - x0 = -1 - 2 - 0 = -3   -> negative -> invalid? but the example says it is possible.\n\n   So that doesn't work.\n\n   Another known solution (from a known contest) for the same problem:\n\n        We define:\n          Let x[0] = 0\n          Let x[1] = A[0]   (so that the first element becomes 0: because the operation at index1 will subtract from index0? but we haven't done anything to index0)\n\n        Then for i from 2 to n-1:\n          x[i] = A[i-1] - x[i-1] - x[i-2]\n\n        Then the condition for the last element: A[n-1] must equal x[n-2] + x[n-1]? \n\n        But in the example: \n          n=7, A = [2, -1, 3, 1, 4, -2, 9]\n\n          x0 = 0\n          x1 = 2\n          x2 = A[1] - x1 - x0 = -1 - 2 - 0 = -3 -> negative -> invalid, so we output -1? but the example says 4 operations.\n\n   This does not match.\n\n   After rethinking:\n\n   We can write the equations for the final values:\n\n        f0 = A0 + x1\n        f1 = A1 + x2 - x1\n        f2 = A2 + x3 - x2 + x1   -> because an operation at index1 (x1 times) adds x1 to index0 and index2, and an operation at index2 (x2 times) adds x2 to index1 and index3, and then the operation at index2 also subtracts the original value? \n\n   Actually, the operation at index i (0-indexed) does:\n        A[i-1] becomes A[i-1] + A[i]   -> but note the A[i] at the time of operation is the current value at i, which might have been changed by previous operations? \n\n   This is a linear system? We can write:\n\n        Let the initial array be A, and let x be the vector of operation counts.\n\n        Then the final value at i is:\n\n          f_i = A_i \n                 + (if i>=1) x_{i+1}   [because an operation at i+1 adds to i?] \n                 + (if i>=1) ... \n\n        Actually, the operation at j (0-indexed) affects:\n          j-1: adds the value that was at j at the moment of the operation. But the value at j at the moment of the operation is: \n                the initial A_j plus the contributions from operations at j-1 and j+1? \n\n        This is circular.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the idea of representing the final value as a linear combination of the initial A and the x's.\n\n   However, note that the problem has been solved in CodeForces and the solution is known to be:\n\n        We define:\n          x0 = 0\n          x1 = A0\n          for i from 2 to n-1:\n             x_i = A_{i-1} - x_{i-1} - x_{i-2}\n          Then we require:\n             x_{n-1} = A_{n-1} - x_{n-2}   [for the last element?] -> but then the equation for the last element is: \n                 f_{n-1} = A_{n-1} + x_{n-2}   (because the operation at n-2 adds to n-1) and we want f_{n-1} >=0? \n\n        But wait, the known solution then checks:\n             if x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} == A_{n-1}? \n\n        Actually, the equation for the last element (index n-1) is:\n             f_{n-1} = A_{n-1} + x_{n-2}   (because the operation at index n-2 (which is the last operation that affects n-1) adds x_{n-2} to n-1? \n        But we also have the operation at n-1? but n-1 is not allowed because the operation must be from index1 to n-2 (so 0-indexed indices 1 to n-2). So the last element is only affected by the operation at n-2.\n\n        And we want f_{n-1} = A_{n-1} + x_{n-2} to be non-negative? \n\n        But then what about the equation for the last element in the recurrence? \n\n        The recurrence for i = n-1 (the last element we compute) is:\n             x_{n-1} = A_{n-2} - x_{n-2} - x_{n-3}\n\n        And then we require for the last element: \n             A_{n-1} = x_{n-2} + x_{n-1}   ??? \n\n        Why? \n\n        Actually, the known solution in the contest (from a known AC submission) is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                if n == 1:\n                    print(0)\n                    continue\n                x = [0] * n\n                x[0] = 0\n                x[1] = a[0]\n                for i in range(2, n):\n                    x[i] = a[i-1] - x[i-1] - x[i-2]\n                if x[n-1] + x[n-2] != a[n-1]:\n                    print(-1)\n                else:\n                    if min(x) < 0:\n                        print(-1)\n                    else:\n                        print(sum(x[1:-1]))\n\n        But note: the example input: \n            n=7, a = [2, -1, 3, 1, 4, -2, 9]\n\n        Then:\n            x0 = 0\n            x1 = a0 = 2\n            x2 = a1 - x1 - x0 = -1 - 2 - 0 = -3 -> negative -> so we output -1? \n\n        But the example output is 4.\n\n        So what is the issue?\n\n        Let me reindex the array: the stoves are from 0 to 6.\n\n        The recurrence is defined for i from 2 to n-1 (0-indexed indices 2 to 6, but n=7 so indices 2 to 6). \n\n        However, the recurrence for x2 uses a1 (which is the second element, index1) and x1 and x0.\n\n        But the example input: \n            a = [2, -1, 3, 1, 4, -2, 9]\n\n        We have:\n            x0 = 0\n            x1 = 2\n            x2 = a[1] - x1 - x0 = -1 - 2 - 0 = -3 -> negative.\n\n        This indicates that the solution above is not matching the example.\n\n        Another known solution (from a different contestant) for the same problem:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                if n == 1:\n                    print(0)\n                    continue\n                # We are going to define an array x of length n, but we only care about indices 0 to n-1\n                # We set:\n                #   x0 = 0\n                #   x1 = a0\n                #   for i from 2 to n-1: x_i = a_{i-1} - x_{i-1} - x_{i-2}\n                #   then we require a_{n-1} = x_{n-2} + x_{n-1}\n                x = [0] * n\n                x[0] = 0\n                x[1] = a[0]\n                for i in range(2, n):\n                    x[i] = a[i-1] - x[i-1] - x[i-2]\n                if x[n-1] + x[n-2] != a[n-1]:\n                    print(-1)\n                else:\n                    if min(x) < 0:\n                        print(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # Count the operations: the operations are the x_i for i in the range [1, n-2] (0-indexed indices 1 to n-2)\n                        print(sum(x[1:n-1]))\n\n        But the example fails.\n\n        After reading the problem again: \n          Operation at index i (1-indexed, so 0-indexed index i-1) for i from 2 to N-1 (so 0-indexed indices 1 to n-2).\n\n          The operation does:\n             A_{i-1} = A_{i-1} + A_i\n             A_{i+1} = A_{i+1} + A_i\n             A_i = -A_i\n\n          But note: the operation is done one stove at a time, and we can do the same stove multiple times.\n\n        Let me try a small example: n=3, A = [a, b, c]\n\n        Operation at index1 (0-indexed index1) is allowed (since 1-indexed index2 is not allowed? wait: 1-indexed indices: stove1, stove2, stove3. Operation allowed on stove2 (which is index1 in 0-indexed) because 2 is between 2 and 3-1=2.\n\n        Operation at index1 (0-indexed index1):\n           A0 becomes a + b\n           A2 becomes c + b\n           A1 becomes -b\n\n        Then the array becomes: [a+b, -b, c+b]\n\n        Now, if we do the operation again at index1:\n           A0 becomes (a+b) + (-b) = a\n           A2 becomes (c+b) + (-b) = c\n           A1 becomes -(-b) = b\n\n        So two operations at the same stove cancel out? \n\n        Therefore, we can assume that we do at most one operation at each stove? Not necessarily, but the linear system might be set up with integer counts (and possibly negative counts meaning we do the operation in reverse? but the problem doesn't allow that).\n\n        Actually, the problem says \"zero or more operations\", and we can do any number of times.\n\n        Now, let me try to set up the equations for n=3:\n\n          Let x = number of operations at index1 (0-indexed).\n\n          Then:\n            f0 = a + x * b   [because each operation at index1 adds b to index0? but note: after the first operation, the value at index1 becomes -b, so the next operation would add -b?]\n\n          Actually, the effect of x operations at index1:\n\n            The pattern:\n               Operation 1: \n                  A0 = a + b\n                  A1 = -b\n                  A2 = c + b\n               Operation 2:\n                  A0 = (a+b) + (-b) = a\n                  A1 = b\n                  A2 = (c+b) + (-b) = c\n               Operation 3:\n                  A0 = a + b\n                  A1 = -b\n                  A2 = c + b\n\n            So it alternates.\n\n          Therefore, if we do x operations, then:\n            If x is even:\n               f0 = a + (x//2)*b - (x//2)*b = a   [but wait, the operations in pairs cancel?]\n\n          Actually, we can break down:\n\n            Let x = 2k: then we have done k pairs, and the array becomes [a, b, c] -> same as initial.\n\n            Let x = 2k+1: then we have [a+b, -b, c+b]\n\n          So the final value at index0: \n             if x mod 2 == 0: a\n             else: a+b\n\n          Similarly, index1: \n             if x mod 2 == 0: b\n             else: -b\n\n          index2: \n             if x mod 2 == 0: c\n             else: c+b\n\n          This is not linear in x.\n\n        Therefore, the linear system approach with integer counts x_i (which can be any nonnegative integer) might not be linear in the way we thought.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the fact that the provided code in the problem uses a SegmentTree and a process that does an inversion count, we must reconsider.\n\n        The provided code in the problem:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n            process(A)\n\n            def process(A):\n                n = len(A)\n                A1 = []\n                curr = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    curr += A[i]\n                    A1.append([curr, i])\n                if min(A1)[0] < 0 or max(A1)[0] != A1[-1][0]:\n                    print(\"-1\")\n                    return\n                A1.sort()\n                A1 = [[i, A1[i][1]] for i in range(n)]\n                A1.sort(key=lambda a:a[1])\n                S = SegmentTree(data=[0 for i in range(n)])\n                answer = 0\n                for x, i in A1:\n                    answer += S.query(x+1, n)\n                    S[x] = 1\n                print(answer)\n\n        This code does:\n\n          Step 1: Compute the prefix sums: \n              prefix[i] = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i]\n\n          Step 2: Check if any prefix sum is negative or if the total sum (prefix[n-1]) is not equal to the maximum prefix sum? \n             Actually, it checks: min(prefix) < 0 OR the maximum prefix sum is not equal to the last prefix sum? \n             But the last prefix sum is the total sum.\n\n          Step 3: Then it sorts the prefix sums and then reindexes them by their rank (so A1 becomes [rank, original index] for each prefix sum).\n\n          Step 4: Then it does an inversion count? \n             It initializes a segment tree of zeros of length n.\n             Then for each prefix sum (in the order of the original index) it:\n                 adds the number of elements in the segment tree that are in the range [x+1, n) (which are the prefix sums greater than the current one) to the answer.\n                 then sets the position x in the segment tree to 1.\n\n          This is counting the number of inversions in the prefix sums? \n\n        How does this relate to the problem?\n\n        The problem is about counting pairs (i, j) with i<j and the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\n        But wait, the problem we are given in program1.py is about stoves and operations, not about strings.\n\n        There seems to be a mismatch.\n\n        Let me read the problem again: \n\n          \"Given n strings, each of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k', output the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the i-th string and the j-th string differ in exactly one position.\"\n\n        And the input specification: \n          t test cases, then for each test case: n, and n strings.\n\n        But the provided code in program1.py reads:\n\n          n = int(input())\n          A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n\n        This reads integers, not strings.\n\n        This indicates that the provided code in the problem is for a different problem.\n\n        Therefore, we must be cautious.\n\n        The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and then gives a description.\n\n        But the provided code is for program1.py and program2.py.\n\n        And the example of program1.py reads integers and then calls process(A) with a list of integers.\n\n        And the example output for the first example is 4.\n\n        The example input for the first example is:\n            t=1, then n=7, A = [2, -1, 3, 1, 4, -2, 9]\n\n        And the example output is 4.\n\n        So the problem is about the stove temperatures.\n\n        But the provided code in program1.py does not match the problem description of the string pairs.\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        After re\u2010examining the problem statement at the top: \n\n          \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n          And then there are two programs: program1.py and program2.py.\n\n          The description for program1.py is: \n             \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem: \n                 Description: ... (the stove problem) ...\"\n\n          And then the code for program1.py is provided with some missing parts.\n\n          And then there is program2.py with a different description? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n          And the output format is a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n        Therefore, we have two separate programs.\n\n        Let's focus on program1.py first.\n\n        The provided code for program1.py is:\n\n            import sys\n            input = sys.stdin.buffer.readline \n\n            class SegmentTree:\n                ... (with a missing part in the query function)\n\n            def process(A):\n                ... (as above)\n\n            n = int(input())\n            A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n            process(A)\n\n        The missing part in the SegmentTree is in the query function:\n\n            if stop & 1:\n                ...   # we have to fill this\n\n        And the process function has a condition that if the minimum prefix sum is negative or the maximum prefix sum is not the last prefix sum, we output -1.\n\n        Then it does an inversion count on the prefix sums.\n\n        How does this solve the stove problem?\n\n        We must derive the connection.\n\n        Insight for the stove problem:\n\n          We are allowed to do operations that transfer values. In fact, the operation at index i (0-indexed, i from 1 to n-2) can be seen as:\n\n             We are moving value from stove i to stoves i-1 and i+1, and flipping the sign of the value at i.\n\n          But note the flip: if we do the operation twice, it cancels.\n\n          However, we can also see the entire process as a linear system if we consider the operations in a particular order.\n\n          There is a known solution that uses prefix sums and inversion count? \n\n          Let me try to see the effect on the prefix sums.\n\n          Consider the prefix sums P_i = A0 + A1 + ... + A_i.\n\n          Operation at index i (0-indexed, i from 1 to n-2) affects:\n\n             A_{i-1} becomes A_{i-1} + A_i\n             A_i becomes -A_i\n             A_{i+1} becomes A_{i+1} + A_i\n\n          How does this affect the prefix sums?\n\n          Let the prefix sums before the operation be:\n             P_{i-1} = A0+...+A_{i-1}\n             P_i = P_{i-1} + A_i\n             P_{i+1} = P_i + A_{i+1}\n\n          After the operation:\n\n             The new array at positions:\n                i-1: A_{i-1} + A_i\n                i: -A_i\n                i+1: A_{i+1} + A_i\n\n             New prefix sums:\n                P'_{i-1} = P_{i-1} + A_i\n                P'_i = P'_{i-1} + (-A_i) = P_{i-1} + A_i - A_i = P_{i-1}\n                P'_{i+1} = P'_i + (A_{i+1}+A_i) = P_{i-1} + A_{i+1} + A_i\n\n             Compare to the old P_{i+1} = P_{i-1} + A_i + A_{i+1] -> so P'_{i+1} = P_{i+1}\n\n             And for j>=i+2, the prefix sums remain the same.\n\n             Also, for j < i-1, the prefix sums remain the same.\n\n          So the operation changes:\n             P_{i-1} becomes P_{i-1} + A_i = P_i\n             P_i becomes P_{i-1}\n             And P_{i+1} remains the same.\n\n          In other words, the operation swaps P_{i-1} and P_i, and leaves the other prefix sums unchanged.\n\n          Therefore, the set of prefix sums is invariant up to permutation? \n\n          Specifically, the multiset of prefix sums is invariant.\n\n          And the last prefix sum P_{n-1} is invariant.\n\n          Also, the condition for the final array to be non-negative is that in the final configuration, every stove is non-negative.\n\n          How do we express the final stove values in terms of prefix sums?\n\n          In the final array, we have:\n             f0 = P0\n             f1 = P1 - P0\n             f2 = P2 - P1\n             ...\n             f_{n-1} = P_{n-1} - P_{n-2}\n\n          So the final array is non-negative if and only if the sequence of prefix sums is non-decreasing? \n\n          But note: \n             f0 = P0 >=0\n             f1 = P1 - P0 >=0  => P1>=P0\n             f2 = P2 - P1 >=0  => P2>=P1\n             ... \n             and also the last prefix sum P_{n-1} is fixed.\n\n          Therefore, the final array is non-negative if and only if the prefix sums form a non-decreasing sequence ending with P_{n-1} and starting with P0>=0.\n\n          But wait, the initial P0 = A0, which might be negative.\n\n          The operations allow us to swap adjacent prefix sums (at positions i-1 and i, for i from 1 to n-2). \n\n          We are allowed to do any number of such adjacent swaps. \n\n          Therefore, we can rearrange the prefix sums (except the last one, which is fixed) arbitrarily? \n\n          But note: the swaps are only between adjacent pairs and only for indices from 1 to n-2 (0-indexed) in the prefix array? \n\n          The prefix array has indices 0 to n-1.\n\n          The operation at stove i (0-indexed i from 1 to n-2) swaps the prefix sums at positions i-1 and i.\n\n          So we can do adjacent swaps on the prefix array for indices 0 to n-2? \n\n          Specifically, we can swap P_{i-1} and P_i for i from 1 to n-2.\n\n          This means we can rearrange the prefix sums at indices 0 to n-2 arbitrarily, but the last prefix sum P_{n-1} is fixed.\n\n          Therefore, the condition for the existence of a solution is:\n\n             The last prefix sum P_{n-1} must be equal to the total sum, which is fixed, and we require that it is possible to rearrange the prefix sums (the first n-1 prefix sums) so that the sequence is non-decreasing and the last element is P_{n-1}.\n\n          But note: we can rearrange arbitrarily the first n-1 prefix sums? \n\n          Actually, we can only swap adjacent pairs in the range [0, n-2] (0-indexed indices in the prefix array). This means we can permute the first n-1 prefix sums arbitrarily.\n\n          Therefore, we can sort the first n-1 prefix sums arbitrarily, and then set the last one to P_{n-1} (which is fixed).\n\n          The conditions for non-negative final array are:\n\n             Let Q = sorted(prefix[0: n-1])   # the first n-1 prefix sums sorted in non-decreasing order.\n             Then we require:\n                 Q[0] >= 0\n                 Q is non-decreasing\n                 and the last element of the entire prefix array (which is fixed) is P_{n-1} and must be >= the last element of Q (because the final stove value at the last stove is P_{n-1} - Q_last, and we require that to be non-negative? \n                 But wait, in the final array, the prefix sums after rearrangement should be:\n\n                    P0' = Q0\n                    P1' = Q1\n                    ...\n                    P_{n-2}' = Q_{n-2}\n                    P_{n-1}' = P_{n-1}   (fixed)\n\n                 Then the final stove values:\n                    f0 = P0' = Q0 >=0\n                    f1 = P1' - P0' = Q1 - Q0 >=0  -> which is true because Q is non-decreasing.\n                    ...\n                    f_{n-1} = P_{n-1} - P_{n-2}' = P_{n-1} - Q_{n-2} >=0   -> so we require P_{n-1} >= Q_{n-2]\n\n          But note: in the sorted prefix array, the largest among the first n-1 is Q_{n-2}. And we require P_{n-1} >= Q_{n-2}.\n\n          Also, we require that the last prefix sum P_{n-1} is the largest? \n\n          In the provided code, it checks:\n\n             if min(A1)[0] < 0 or max(A1)[0] != A1[-1][0]:\n                 print(\"-1\")\n                 return\n\n          Here, A1 is the list of prefix sums (for i in range(n): [prefix_i, i]).\n\n          So min(A1)[0] is the minimum prefix sum. We require it to be >=0.\n\n          And max(A1)[0] is the maximum prefix sum, and A1[-1][0] is the last prefix sum (which is the total sum). We require that the maximum prefix sum is the last one.\n\n          Why must the maximum be the last one? \n\n          Because in the final arrangement, we want the last prefix sum to be the largest? \n\n          But note: after we arbitrarily permute the first n-1 prefix sums, we can make the last prefix sum (which is fixed) be the largest by ensuring that in the sorted order we put the largest of the first n-1 at the end? but we cannot move the last prefix sum.\n\n          Actually, the last prefix sum is fixed and must be the maximum because:\n\n             In the final non-decreasing sequence of prefix sums, the last element (which is the total sum) must be the largest.\n\n          Therefore, the necessary conditions are:\n\n             (1) The last prefix sum (total sum) must be the maximum of all prefix sums.\n             (2) The minimum prefix sum must be non-negative.\n\n          If these conditions are not met, it is impossible -> output -1.\n\n          If they are met, then we can arrange the prefix sums arbitrarily for indices 0 to n-2, so we can make the sequence non-decreasing. \n\n          But then why do we need to count inversions?\n\n          The problem asks for the minimum number of operations.\n\n          How do we relate the number of operations to the number of swaps in the prefix array?\n\n          Each operation is an adjacent swap in the prefix array for indices i-1 and i (for i from 1 to n-2). \n\n          Therefore, the minimum number of operations needed to sort the prefix array (the first n-1 elements) to a non-decreasing sequence is the number of inversions in the first n-1 prefix sums? \n\n          But note: we can only swap adjacent elements, and the minimum number of adjacent swaps to sort an array is the number of inversions.\n\n          However, we are not necessarily sorting the entire prefix array of n elements? \n\n          We have:\n\n             We can rearrange arbitrarily the first n-1 prefix sums (indices 0 to n-2) by adjacent swaps (which are the operations).\n\n          And we want the entire sequence of prefix sums (including the last one fixed) to be non-decreasing. \n\n          Since the last prefix sum is the maximum, we only need to sort the first n-1 prefix sums in non-decreasing order and then the last one is already at the end and is the largest.\n\n          Therefore, the minimum number of operations is the number of inversions in the first n-1 prefix sums.\n\n          But the provided code does:\n\n             A1 = list of [prefix_i, i] for i in range(n)\n             Then it checks the min and max conditions.\n\n             Then it sorts A1 by the prefix sum value, and then assigns a rank (from 0 to n-1) to each prefix sum? \n\n             Then it reorders the prefix sums by the original index? \n\n             Then it uses a segment tree to count the number of inversions in the entire array of ranks? \n\n          However, note that the last prefix sum is fixed and should not be moved? \n\n          But the condition we checked ensures that the last prefix sum is the maximum, so in the sorted order by value, the last element (with the largest value) would be at the end. \n\n          In the inversion count, we are counting the number of inversions in the entire array of ranks? \n\n          But we only need to sort the first n-1 elements. The last element is fixed and is the largest, so it should be at the end. \n\n          Therefore, we can consider the entire array? \n\n          The inversion count in the entire array of the ranks of the prefix sums (for all n elements) would count the inversions among the first n-1 and also between the last element and the others? \n\n          But the last element is the largest, so it will not form an inversion with any element? \n\n          Specifically, an inversion is a pair (i, j) with i<j and a[i] > a[j]. Since the last element is the largest, there is no j>i such that a[i] > a[j] for i being the last element. And for j being the last element, if i is not the last element, then a[i] <= a[j] (because a[j] is the largest) so no inversion involves the last element.\n\n          Therefore, the inversion count in the entire array is the same as the inversion count in the first n-1 elements.\n\n          So the provided code is counting the inversion count in the array of the ranks of the prefix sums.\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Step 1: Compute the prefix sums: P[0..n-1]\n            Step 2: Check: \n                min(P) >= 0 and max(P) == P[-1]\n\n            Step 3: Create an array A1 = [ (P[i], i) for i in range(n) ]\n            Step 4: Sort A1 by the value of P[i]. Then assign ranks: \n                After sorting, the smallest P[i] gets rank 0, next gets 1, ... up to n-1.\n                Then create an array B of length n: for each original index i, we assign the rank of P[i].\n\n            Step 5: Now, we want to count the number of inversions in the array B (which is the same as the inversion count in the permutation defined by the ranks).\n\n            Step 6: Use a segment tree to count the inversions: \n                We traverse the array B in the original index order (which is the order of increasing i from 0 to n-1). \n                For each element B[i] = x, we count the number of elements that have been seen that have a rank greater than x (i.e., in the segment tree, we query the range [x+1, n-1] and add to the answer). Then we update the segment tree at position x to 1.\n\n          This counts the number of inversions.\n\n          Therefore, the minimum number of operations is the number of inversions in the array of ranks of the prefix sums.\n\n          But note: the problem says the answer may be large, and we are using a segment tree that counts inversions in O(n log n).\n\n          Now, the missing part in the segment tree's query function:\n\n            We are building a segment tree for range sum queries.\n\n            The query function is for the range [start, stop) (stop is exclusive).\n\n            The current code:\n\n                res_left = res_right = self._default\n                while start < stop:\n                    if start & 1:\n                        res_left = self._func(res_left, self.data[start])\n                        start += 1\n                    if stop & 1:\n                        # MISSING: we need to do something for the right side.\n\n            The standard segment tree for range query (sum) that covers [l, r) (with l inclusive, r exclusive) is:\n\n                while start < stop:\n                    if start & 1:\n                        res_left = func(res_left, data[start])\n                        start += 1\n                    if stop & 1:\n                        stop -= 1\n                        res_right = func(data[stop], res_right)   # note: because the segments are [start, stop) and we are using a 0-indexed segment tree, and the tree is built in an array of size 2*size.\n\n            But note: the segment tree is built with the leaves at [size, size+n). The query for [l, r) is done by:\n\n                l0 = l, r0 = r\n                l += size, r += size\n                res = default\n                while l < r:\n                    if l & 1:\n                        res = func(res, data[l])\n                        l += 1\n                    if r & 1:\n                        r -= 1\n                        res = func(res, data[r])   # or func(data[r], res) if the function is not commutative? \n\n            However, in the provided code, the function is typically sum, which is commutative.\n\n            The provided code has:\n\n                if start & 1:\n                    res_left = func(res_left, data[start])\n                    start += 1\n                if stop & 1:\n                    ... \n\n            We need to adjust the right side: we take the element at stop-1.\n\n            So:\n\n                if stop & 1:\n                    stop -= 1\n                    res_right = func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n\n            Then after the while loop, we combine res_left and res_right: func(res_left, res_right).\n\n            But note: the order? The segment tree is built such that the leaves are in increasing order. The query [start, stop) is from left to right. The right side we are taking from the highest index first? \n\n            Actually, the standard way is:\n\n                res = default\n                l = start, r = stop\n                while l < r:\n                    if l & 1:\n                        res = func(res, data[l])\n                        l += 1\n                    if r & 1:\n                        r -= 1\n                        res = func(res, data[r])\n                    l //= 2\n                    r //= 2\n\n            But the provided code does not do that. It does:\n\n                while start < stop:\n                    if start & 1: ... \n                    if stop & 1: ... \n                    start //= 2\n                    stop //= 2\n\n            And then combines res_left and res_right.\n\n            The provided code has:\n\n                res_left = res_right = default\n                while start < stop:\n                    if start & 1:\n                        res_left = func(res_left, data[start])\n                        start += 1\n                    if stop & 1:\n                        ...   # we need to do: stop -= 1, then res_right = func(data[stop], res_right)\n                    start //= 2\n                    stop //= 2\n\n                return func(res_left, res_right)\n\n            So the missing part is:\n\n                stop -= 1\n                res_right = func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n\n          Therefore, for the segment tree query function, we fill:\n\n            if stop & 1:\n                stop -= 1\n                res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n\n          But note: the variable names: we have res_right and we are combining from the right.\n\n          However, the function might be non-commutative? The default function is sum, which is commutative, so it doesn't matter.\n\n        Now, what about program2.py?\n\n        The problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        So program1.py outputs something, and program2.py reads from stdin and processes.\n\n        We are not given the code for program2.py, but we are to complete it.\n\n        The description for program2.py is:\n\n          \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\n           Description: Given n strings, each of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k', output the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the i-th string and the j-th string differ in exactly one position.\"\n\n        And the input specification: \n          t test cases, then for each test case: n, and n strings.\n\n        The output specification: for each test case, the number of pairs.\n\n        The example: \n          For the first test case: \n            Input: \n                1\n                7\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                ef\n                ff\n            Output: 5? but the example says 5 pairs.\n\n          However, the example in the problem says: \n            For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\n          So 5 pairs.\n\n        How to count?\n\n          We have strings of length 2. We want pairs (i,j) such that the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\n          We can count:\n\n            For a string s, we can consider:\n\n              Option 1: the first character matches, then the second differs.\n              Option 2: the second character matches, then the first differs.\n\n          But note: if we count by the differing position, we might overcount? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use a frequency map.\n\n          Let f(x, y) be the frequency of the string (x,y).\n\n          Then the total pairs that differ in exactly one position:\n\n            For a fixed string s = (a, b):\n\n              For the first position differing and the second matching: \n                 We consider all strings that have second character = b and first character != a. The count for first character = c (c != a) is f(c, b).\n\n              For the second position differing and the first matching:\n                 We consider all strings that have first character = a and second character != b. The count for second character = c (c != b) is f(a, c).\n\n          But note: we are counting pairs (i,j) and we will count each pair twice? \n\n          Actually, we are iterating over each string and counting the pairs that include that string as the first element? \n\n          Then the total count would be:\n\n            total = 0\n            for each string (a,b):\n                count1 = (sum_{c != a} f(c, b))   # for the first position differing\n                count2 = (sum_{c != b} f(a, c))   # for the second position differing\n                total += count1 + count2\n\n          But then each pair (i,j) is counted twice: once from i and once from j? \n\n          Actually, no: we are counting for each string s_i, the number of s_j (j>i) that differ in exactly one position? \n\n          But in the above, we are counting for each string s_i, the number of s_j (for any j, including j<i) that differ in exactly one position.\n\n          And then we would count each pair twice: (i,j) and (j,i). But we only want i<j.\n\n          Also, we want to count each pair once.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            total = 0\n            for each string (a,b):\n                count1 = (sum_{c in letters, c != a} f(c, b)) \n                count2 = (sum_{c in letters, c != b} f(a, c))\n                total += count1 + count2\n\n            then total // 2   because each pair is counted twice.\n\n          But note: the frequency f(a,b) includes the string (a,b) itself? \n\n          When we count for a particular string (a,b), we are including the string itself in the frequency? \n\n          We should subtract the string itself? \n\n          Actually, we want to count pairs of distinct indices.\n\n          So for a string (a,b), we should not count itself.\n\n          Therefore:\n\n            count1 = (sum_{c != a} f(c, b))   # this includes all strings with second char b and first char != a, including those that appeared before? \n            but note: the frequency f(c,b) counts all occurrences.\n\n          However, we are iterating over every string, so we will count:\n\n            For the first string (a,b): \n                count1 = (number of other strings with second char b and first char != a) \n                count2 = (number of other strings with first char a and second char != b)\n\n          But the frequency map f(c,b) does not distinguish the current string.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            total = 0\n            freq = defaultdict(int)\n            # First, build frequency map for all strings.\n            for each string s in the test case:\n                freq[s] += 1\n\n            for each string s = (a,b) in the test case:\n                # We want to count the strings that differ in exactly one position with s.\n                # But note: we are going to count every pair twice: once for each endpoint.\n\n                # For the first position: \n                for c in \"abcdefghijk\":\n                    if c != a:\n                        total += freq.get(c+b, 0)\n                # For the second position:\n                for c in \"abcdefghijk\":\n                    if c != b:\n                        total += freq.get(a+c, 0)\n\n            then total //= 2   # because each pair is counted twice.\n\n          However, the constraints: n up to 10^5, and the alphabet size is 11 (from 'a' to 'k'). \n\n          So the inner loops run 11+11 = 22 per string, total 22 * n, which is 2.2e6, acceptable.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 10^5.\n\n        However, the input specification for the entire problem: \n          The first line t (1<=t<=100), and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n          for test_case in range(t):\n              n = int(input())\n              strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n          Then build the frequency map for this test case.\n\n        But note: the example input:\n\n           1\n           7\n           ab\n           cb\n           db\n           aa\n           cc\n           ef\n           ff\n\n          Then:\n\n            freq = \n                'ab':1, 'cb':1, 'db':1, 'aa':1, 'cc':1, 'ef':1, 'ff':1\n\n          For string \"ab\":\n             first position: c in 'a' to 'k' except 'a': \n                 c='b': 'bb' -> 0\n                 c='c': 'cb' -> 1\n                 c='d': 'db' -> 1\n                 ... others 0 -> total 2\n             second position: c in 'a' to 'k' except 'b':\n                 c='a': 'aa' -> 1\n                 c='c': 'ac' -> 0\n                 ... -> total 1\n             so for \"ab\": 2+1 = 3\n\n          For string \"cb\":\n             first position: except 'c': \n                 'a': 'ab' -> 1\n                 'b': 'bb' -> 0\n                 'd': 'db' -> 1\n                 ... -> 2\n             second position: except 'b':\n                 'a': 'ca' -> 0\n                 'c': 'cc' -> 1\n                 ... -> 1\n             total 3\n\n          For string \"db\":\n             first position: except 'd': \n                 'a': 'ab' -> 1\n                 'b': 'bb' -> 0\n                 'c': 'cb' -> 1\n                 ... -> 2\n             second position: except 'b': \n                 ... -> 1 (only 'aa'?

The frequency map includes the entire set.\n\n          We are not excluding the current string? \n\n          For the current string \"ab\", we count:\n\n            first position: \n               'cb' and 'db' -> these are other strings -> correct.\n\n            second position:\n               'aa' -> which is another string -> correct.\n\n          For \"cb\":\n            first position: \n               'ab' and 'db' -> correct.\n            second position:\n               'cc' -> correct.\n\n          For \"db\":\n            first position: \n               'ab' and 'cb' -> correct.\n\n          For \"aa\":\n            second position: \n               'ab' -> correct.\n\n          For \"cc\":\n            second position: \n               'cb' -> correct.\n\n          For \"ef\":\n            first position: \n               'ff' -> correct.\n\n          For \"ff\": none.\n\n          So the count for \"aa\" is 1 (from 'ab') and for \"ab\" we counted 'aa'? \n\n          But note: when we are at \"aa\", we count the string \"ab\" (which is a different string) for the second position? \n\n          And when we are at \"ab\", we count \"aa\" for the second position? \n\n          So the pair (ab, aa) is counted twice: once from ab and once from aa.\n\n          Similarly, (ab, cb) is counted from ab and from cb.\n\n          So every pair is counted twice.\n\n          Therefore, we have 10 counts? but we got 11.\n\n          Let me recount the total:\n\n            ab: 3\n            cb: 3\n            db: 2\n            aa: 1\n            cc: 1\n            ef: 1\n            ff: 0\n            total = 3+3+2+1+1+1 = 11\n\n          Why 11? \n\n          The pairs are 5, so we expect 10.\n\n          The extra one: \n\n            For \"aa\": \n               second position: we count 'ab' -> that's one.\n\n            For \"ab\": \n               second position: we count 'aa' -> that's one.\n\n            So the pair (aa, ab) is counted twice -> that's 2.\n\n          But we also have:\n\n            (ab, cb): 2\n            (ab, db): 2\n            (cb, db): 2\n            (cb, cc): 2\n\n          Total 2*5 = 10.\n\n          So why 11? \n\n          I see: the string \"aa\" has first character 'a' and second character 'a'. When we do:\n\n            For the second position: we look for strings with first char 'a' and second char != 'a'. \n                We have \"ab\": that's one.\n\n            For the first position: we look for strings with second char 'a' and first char != 'a'. \n                We have none? \n\n          So only 1 for \"aa\".\n\n          Similarly, for \"ab\": \n            first position: second char is 'b', so we look for first char != 'a' and second char 'b': we have \"cb\", \"db\" -> 2.\n            second position: first char 'a', second char != 'b': we have \"aa\" -> 1.\n\n          So 3 for \"ab\".\n\n          Now, for \"cb\":\n            first position: second char 'b', first char != 'c': we have \"ab\", \"db\" -> 2.\n            second position: first char 'c', second char != 'b': we have \"cc\" -> 1.\n            total 3.\n\n          For \"db\":\n            first position: second char 'b', first char != 'd': we have \"ab\", \"cb\" -> 2.\n            second position: first char 'd', second char != 'b': none -> 0.\n            total 2.\n\n          For \"cc\":\n            first position: second char 'c', first char != 'c': none -> 0.\n            second position: first char 'c', second char != 'c': we have \"cb\" -> 1.\n            total 1.\n\n          For \"ef\":\n            first position: second char 'f', first char != 'e': we have \"ff\" -> 1.\n            second position: first char 'e', second char != 'f': none -> 0.\n            total 1.\n\n          For \"ff\": 0.\n\n          Total = 3+3+2+1+1+1 = 11.\n\n          But the pairs are 5, so we have 10 counts? \n\n          The issue: the pair (aa, ab) is counted twice: \n             from \"aa\": we count \"ab\" (for second position: because 'aa' and 'ab' differ in the second position? \n                 aa: (a,a) and ab: (a,b) -> differ in second position -> valid.\n             from \"ab\": we count \"aa\" (for second position: because 'ab' and 'aa' differ in the second position? \n                 ab: (a,b) and aa: (a,a) -> differ in second position -> valid.\n\n          So the pair (aa,ab) is valid and is counted twice.\n\n          Similarly, every valid pair is counted twice.\n\n          Therefore, the total number of pairs is 5, and we have 10 counts? but we have 11.\n\n          What is the 11th count? \n\n          Let me list the counts per pair:\n\n            (ab, cb): counted in ab (first position: cb) and in cb (first position: ab) -> 2\n            (ab, db): 2\n            (ab, aa): 2\n            (cb, db): 2\n            (cb, cc): 2\n\n          Total 10.\n\n          So why 11? \n\n          I see: the string \"aa\" is counted as having one neighbor: \"ab\". \n          \"ab\" has three neighbors: \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\".\n          \"cb\" has three neighbors: \"ab\", \"db\", \"cc\".\n          \"db\" has two neighbors: \"ab\", \"cb\".\n          \"cc\" has one neighbor: \"cb\".\n          \"ef\" has one neighbor: \"ff\".\n          \"ff\" has zero.\n\n          Total counts: 1+3+3+2+1+1 = 11.\n\n          And then we divide by 2 -> 5.5 -> which is not an integer.\n\n          But note: the pair (aa,ab) is one pair, but it is counted in \"aa\" and in \"ab\", so two counts.\n\n          The total counts (11) is 2 * (number of pairs) + 1? \n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          I see the mistake: the pair (aa,ab) is one pair, and it is counted twice: once in \"aa\" and once in \"ab\". Similarly, every pair is counted twice. So the total count should be 2 * 5 = 10.\n\n          Why did we get 11? \n\n          Let me recalc manually for \"aa\" and \"ab\":\n\n            For \"aa\": \n               second position: we look for strings with first char 'a' and second char not 'a'. \n                  We have \"ab\": that's one.\n\n            For \"ab\":\n               first position: we look for strings with second char 'b' and first char not 'a'. \n                  We have \"cb\", \"db\" -> two.\n               second position: we look for strings with first char 'a' and second char not 'b'. \n                  We have \"aa\" -> one.\n\n            So for \"ab\": 3.\n\n          But note: the string \"aa\" is present in the list. When we are at \"aa\", we count \"ab\". When we are at \"ab\", we count \"aa\". \n\n          So the pair (aa,ab) is counted twice: once in \"aa\" and once in \"ab\". \n\n          Now, is there a pair that is counted three times? \n\n          The total count is 1 (from \"aa\") + 3 (from \"ab\") + 3 (from \"cb\") + 2 (from \"db\") + 1 (from \"cc\") + 1 (from \"ef\") = 11.\n\n          The only possibility is that there is a pair that is counted three times? \n\n          But we only have 5 pairs.\n\n          Alternatively, we might be counting the same string twice? \n\n          How did we build the frequency map? \n\n            We built the frequency map for the entire list of strings.\n\n          Then when we iterate over the strings, for each string s, we use the frequency map that includes the current string.\n\n          Therefore, for the current string s = (a,b), when we count:\n\n            For the first position: we count all strings with second char b and first char != a, including the current string? \n\n          But the current string has first char a, so it is excluded? \n\n          Similarly, for the second position: we count all strings with first char a and second char != b, and the current string has second char b, so it is excluded.\n\n          So we are not counting the current string.\n\n          Then why 11? \n\n          Let me list the counts again:\n\n            \"aa\": \n                second position: first char 'a', second char not 'a': only \"ab\" -> 1.\n\n            \"ab\":\n                first position: second char 'b', first char not 'a': \"cb\", \"db\" -> 2.\n                second position: first char 'a', second char not 'b': \"aa\" -> 1.\n                total 3.\n\n            \"cb\":\n                first position: second char 'b', first char not 'c': \"ab\", \"db\" -> 2.\n                second position: first char 'c', second char not 'b': \"cc\" -> 1.\n                total 3.\n\n            \"db\":\n                first position: second char 'b', first char not 'd': \"ab\", \"cb\" -> 2.\n                second position: first char 'd', second char not 'b': none -> 0.\n                total 2.\n\n            \"aa\": already done?

\n\n          But wait, we have a pair (ef, ff): \n             They differ in the first position: 'e' vs 'f', and the second position is 'f' for both? \n             So exactly one position.\n\n          And we counted: \n             for \"ef\": first position: we counted \"ff\" -> 1 count.\n             for \"ff\": we counted 0.\n\n          So the pair (ef,ff) is only counted once? \n\n          Why? \n\n          Because when we are at \"ef\", we count \"ff\" (which is a different string) -> 1.\n          When we are at \"ff\", we do not count \"ef\" because for the first position: \n             second char is 'f', first char not 'f': we look for first char not 'f' and second char 'f'. \n                 \"ef\" has first char 'e' (which is not 'f') and second char 'f' -> so we should count it.\n\n          But in our count for \"ff\", we did:\n\n             first position: second char 'f', first char != 'f': \n                 we iterate c from 'a' to 'k' except 'f': \n                    c='a': \"af\" -> not present\n                    ...\n                    c='e': \"ef\" -> present -> count 1.\n\n          So we should have counted 1 for \"ff\" in the first position.\n\n          But in our manual count for \"ff\", we said 0.\n\n          That's the error.\n\n          For \"ff\":\n             first position: \n                 for c in \"abcdefghijk\" (which is 11 letters) and c != 'f': \n                    string = c + 'f'\n                 we have only \"ef\" present -> 1.\n             second position: \n                 for c in \"abcdefghijk\" and c != 'f': \n                    string = 'f' + c\n                 we have none -> 0.\n             so total 1.\n\n          Then the total becomes 1 (aa) + 3 (ab) + 3 (cb) + 2 (db) + 1 (cc) + 1 (ef) + 1 (ff) = 12.\n\n          Then 12/2 = 6.\n\n          But the example says 5 pairs.\n\n          What are the pairs?\n\n            (aa, ab): differ in second position.\n            (ab, cb): first position.\n            (ab, db): first position.\n            (cb, db): first position.\n            (cb, cc): second position.\n            (ef, ff): first position.\n\n          So 6 pairs.\n\n          But the example output says 5.\n\n          The example says: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\n          So they did not include (ef, ff)? \n\n          Why? \n\n          The example input has 7 strings: \n            ab, cb, db, aa, cc, ef, ff\n\n          The example says: \n            the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\n          So (ef, ff) is not listed.\n\n          But it should be: \n             ef and ff: first character: 'e' vs 'f' -> differ, second character: 'f' vs 'f' -> same.\n\n          So it should be counted.\n\n          The example output says 5, but we have 6.\n\n          I see: the example output in the problem says:\n\n            For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... and (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> that's 5.\n\n          And then it says: For the second test case ... and for the third test case, there are no pairs.\n\n          So the first test case has 5 pairs.\n\n          Why did we count 6? \n\n          The example input has 7 strings, and we counted 6 pairs.\n\n          Let me list all pairs that differ in exactly one position:\n\n            ab: (a,b)\n            cb: (c,b) -> differs from ab in first position -> valid.\n            db: (d,b) -> differs from ab in first position -> valid.\n            aa: (a,a) -> differs from ab in second position -> valid.\n            cc: (c,c) -> differs from cb in second position -> valid.\n            ef: (e,f)\n            ff: (f,f) -> differs from ef in first position -> valid.\n\n            Also, \n               cb and db: (c,b) and (d,b) -> first position -> valid.\n               cb and aa: (c,b) and (a,a) -> both positions differ -> not valid.\n               cb and cc: (c,b) and (c,c) -> second position -> valid.\n               db and aa: (d,b) and (a,a) -> both differ -> not valid.\n               db and cc: (d,b) and (c,c) -> both differ -> not valid.\n               db and ef: both differ -> not valid.\n               aa and cc: (a,a) and (c,c) -> both differ -> not valid.\n               aa and ef: both differ -> not valid.\n               aa and ff: both differ -> not valid.\n               cc and ef: both differ -> not valid.\n               cc and ff: both differ -> not valid.\n               ef and ff: first position -> valid.\n\n          So the valid pairs are:\n\n            (ab, cb), (ab, db), (ab, aa), (cb, db), (cb, cc), (ef, ff)\n\n          That's 6.\n\n          But the example says 5.\n\n          The example output for the first test case is 5.\n\n          The example input in the problem for the first test case is:\n\n            Input: \n                7\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                ef\n                ff\n\n          And the example output is 5.\n\n          There is a discrepancy.\n\n          I see: the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string\" with i<j.\n\n          In the list:\n\n            Let the strings be indexed 0 to 6:\n\n               0: ab\n               1: cb\n               2: db\n               3: aa\n               4: cc\n               5: ef\n               6: ff\n\n          The pairs with i<j:\n\n            (0,1): ab, cb -> valid.\n            (0,2): ab, db -> valid.\n            (0,3): ab, aa -> valid.\n            (0,4): ab, cc -> both differ? -> no.\n            (0,5): ab, ef -> both differ? -> no.\n            (0,6): ab, ff -> both differ? -> no.\n\n            (1,2): cb, db -> valid.\n            (1,3): cb, aa -> both differ -> no.\n            (1,4): cb, cc -> valid.\n            (1,5): cb, ef -> both differ -> no.\n            (1,6): cb, ff -> both differ -> no.\n\n            (2,3): db, aa -> both differ -> no.\n            (2,4): db, cc -> both differ -> no.\n            (2,5): db, ef -> both differ -> no.\n            (2,6): db, ff -> both differ -> no.\n\n            (3,4): aa, cc -> both differ -> no.\n            (3,5): aa, ef -> both differ -> no.\n            (3,6): aa, ff -> both differ -> no.\n\n            (4,5): cc, ef -> both differ -> no.\n            (4,6): cc, ff -> both differ -> no.\n\n            (5,6): ef, ff -> valid.\n\n          So the valid pairs with i<j are:\n\n            (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,4), (5,6) -> 6 pairs.\n\n          But the example says the valid pairs are:\n\n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\n          That is: \n            (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (1,4) -> 5 pairs.\n\n          They did not include (5,6): (ef, ff).\n\n          Why? \n\n          The problem says: \"consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'\", and 'e' and 'f' are in 'a' to 'k'. \n\n          The example output in the problem says 5.\n\n          There is a possibility that the example input in the problem is different.\n\n          The problem says for the first test case:\n\n            Input: \n                7\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                ef\n                ff\n\n          But in the example of the output, they list 5 pairs.\n\n          And they say: \"the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\" -> that's the fifth.\n\n          So they did not include (ef, ff).\n\n          Why? \n\n          I see: the problem says \"from 'a' to 'k'\", which is 11 letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k.\n\n          So 'e' and 'f' are included.\n\n          But the example output is 5.\n\n          There is a possibility that the example input is actually:\n\n            The problem says: \n                Then follows 7 lines: \n                  ab\n                  cb\n                  db\n                  aa\n                  cc\n                  ef\n                  ff\n\n          But in the example of the output, they only list 5 pairs that involve the first 5 strings? \n\n          Or perhaps the example input is without the last two strings? \n\n          The example input says 7, but then lists 7 strings.\n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... (5 pairs)\".\n\n          So we must output 5 for the first test case.\n\n          How can we reconcile? \n\n          The example output in the problem does not include (ef, ff). \n\n          Therefore, we must output 5 for the first test case.\n\n          But our count for the given 7 strings is 6.\n\n          This indicates that the example input might be different.\n\n          Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n            \"Given n strings, each of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'\"\n\n          and the example input: \n               7\n               ab\n               cb\n               db\n               aa\n               cc\n               ef\n               ff\n\n          and the example output: 5.\n\n          But our count is 6.\n\n          I see: the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string have exactly one position p (1<=p<=2) such that ...\".\n\n          In the pair (ef, ff): \n             first position: e vs f -> differ.\n             second position: f vs f -> same.\n          -> exactly one position.\n\n          So it should be counted.\n\n          Unless the problem has a different example input.\n\n          The problem also says: \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...

\n\n          The only way is to not count the pair (ef, ff).\n\n          Why would we not count it? \n\n          The problem says: \"consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'\", and 'e' and 'f' are in the range.\n\n          Unless the example input for the first test case is:\n\n            7\n            ab\n            cb\n            db\n            aa\n            cc\n            ac   <- instead of ef\n            ca   <- instead of ff\n\n          But then the string \"ac\" and \"ca\" would be there.\n\n          And then the valid pairs might be 5.\n\n          Given the time, we output the code as described.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is at most 10^5, and the alphabet is small, so our solution for program2.py is O(n * 22) = O(22 * 10^5) = 2.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n          We'll output the code.\n\n          For program1.py, the missing part in the segment tree is:\n\n            if stop & 1:\n                stop -= 1\n                res_right = self._func(self.data[stop], res_right)\n\n          For program2.py, we output the code as described.\n\n          However, the example of the string problem in the problem statement for the second test case has 6 pairs, and our code will output for the second test case: \n\n            strings = [\"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\"]\n\n            We build freq:\n                \"aa\":1\n                \"ac\":2\n                \"ca\":2\n                \"cc\":1\n\n            For \"aa\":\n               first position: \n                  for c in alphabet (11 letters) not 'a': \n                     c+b = c+'a': \n                         'ba','ca','da',... -> only 'ca' has freq 2 -> count 2.\n               second position:\n                  for c in alphabet not 'a': \n                     a+c = 'a'+c: \n                         'ab','ac','ad',... -> 'ac' has freq 2 -> count 2.\n               total for \"aa\": 4.\n\n            For \"ac\":\n               first position: \n                  for c not 'a': \n                     c+'c': 'ac' is not included?
