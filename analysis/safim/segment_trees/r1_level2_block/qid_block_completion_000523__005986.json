    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given n, q and a list of prices. We sort the array in descending order and then compute a prefix sum array (so that arr[i] becomes the sum of the first i+1 largest prices). However, note that the problem requires the maximum total value of items received for free.\n\nIn a query (x, y): \n- The customer must purchase at least x items, and then the y cheapest of those purchased are free.\n- To maximize the free value, the customer would choose x items such that the y cheapest among them are as expensive as possible. But note: the free items are the cheapest ones in the purchase. So we want to have as many high-priced items as possible, but the free ones are the smallest in the set we choose.\n\nStrategy:\nWe can think: we want to have a set of x items that has the largest possible y smallest items. How? \n- We can choose x items. The free items are the y smallest. So the free value is the sum of the y smallest in that set.\n- To maximize the free value, we want the y smallest in the set to be as large as possible.\n\nBut note: if we choose the x largest items, then the y smallest in that set are the last y of these x (which are the smallest in the set). Since the array is sorted in descending order, the x largest are the first x in our sorted array. Then the y smallest in that set are the last y in the segment of the first x (which are the smallest in that set). However, in our descending order, the last y in the segment of the first x are the smallest, so they are the ones from index x-y to x-1? Actually, no: in descending order, the first x are the largest. The smallest in that set is the last one (index x-1) and the next smallest is x-2, etc. So the y smallest are the last y in the segment [0, x-1] (i.e., from index x-y to x-1). \n\nBut note: we have a prefix sum array that is computed on the descending order. However, our prefix sum is for the entire array from the largest to the smallest.\n\nLet me reindex: \narr[0] is the largest, arr[1] is the next, ... arr[x-1] is the x-th largest.\n\nThe set of the x largest: indices 0 to x-1.\nThe y smallest in this set: the last y, which are indices x-y to x-1.\n\nSo the sum of the free items = (prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1]) if x-y-1 >=0, else prefix[x-1] (if x-y-1 is negative then we take from 0 to x-1 and subtract nothing? Actually, our prefix array is cumulative: arr[i] = arr[i] + arr[i-1]. So:\n\nWe have:\n  prefix[i] = p0 + p1 + ... + pi.\n\nWe want the sum from index (x-y) to (x-1). That is:\n  S = prefix[x-1] - (prefix[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\nBut note: our prefix array is built in descending order. However, the problem says: the free items are the cheapest, and we are including the cheapest of the set we bought. And we are taking the set of the x largest items, so the cheapest in that set are the last y of the x, which are the smallest in that set.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"maximum total value of items received for free\". And we are summing the y smallest in the set of x largest. Is that the maximum? \n\nConsider: if we choose a set that is not the x largest, then the y smallest in that set might be smaller than the y smallest in the set of the x largest? Actually, the y smallest in the set of the x largest are the largest possible y smallest? \n\nYes: because if we replace one of the large items with a smaller one, then the y smallest might become even smaller. So the best is to take the x largest.\n\nTherefore, for a query (x,y):\n  free_sum = prefix[x-1] - (prefix[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\nBut note: our prefix array is built such that:\n  prefix[0] = p0\n  prefix[1] = p0+p1\n  ...\n  prefix[x-1] = p0+...+p_{x-1}\n\nThe segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) is the sum of y elements: from index (x-y) to (x-1). This is:\n  prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1]   [if x-y-1 >=0]\n\nBut if x-y-1 is negative, that means we are taking from the beginning? Actually, if x-y-1 is negative, then we are taking the entire prefix from 0 to x-1? But that is only x elements, and we want y elements? Actually, if x-y-1 is negative, then x-y-1 is -1, and we don't have prefix[-1]. So we can handle:\n\n  if x == y:\n      then we take the entire set of x items? But note: the free items are the y cheapest, which is the entire set. So we want the sum of the entire set? That is prefix[x-1]. But we already have a condition for x==y: we print arr[x-1]. So in the else branch, we have x>y? Actually, the condition: if (x==y) then print arr[x-1]. So in the else branch, we have x != y, meaning y < x.\n\nSo in the else branch, we can do:\n  result = arr[x-1] - (arr[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? That happens when x-y-1 < 0, i.e., x-y < 1 -> but since y<=x, then x-y>=0, so x-y-1 can be -1 only when x-y=0? But we have x>y in the else branch, so x-y>=1. Therefore, x-y-1 is at least 0? Actually, if x=2, y=1: then x-y-1 = 0 -> then we do arr[1] - arr[0]. But that gives the last element? \n\nLet me test with a small example: \n  n=3, prices = [1,2,5] -> but we sort in descending order: [5,2,1]\n  prefix: \n      index0: 5\n      index1: 5+2=7\n      index2: 7+1=8\n\n  Query: x=2, y=1 -> we should get 2? (because the set of two largest: [5,2]; the cheapest is 2, so free value=2)\n\n  How do we compute?\n      x=2, y=1: \n          free_sum = arr[1] - arr[2-1-1] = arr[1] - arr[0] = 7 - 5 = 2 -> correct.\n\n  Query: x=3, y=2: \n      We are in else? Actually, no: because x==y? Then we use the if branch: print arr[2] = 8? But the example note: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\". But wait, our example has [1,2,5]? The example note uses a different example? \n\nLet me check the note: \n  First query: x=3, y=2 -> items: 5,3,5 -> free: 3+5=8 -> so the array was [5,3,5]? \n  Then sorted descending: [5,5,3]\n  prefix: [5, 10, 13]\n  Query (3,2): \n      if x==y? no -> else: \n          free_sum = arr[2-1] - arr[2-2-1] -> wait: x=3, y=2: \n          free_sum = arr[2] (which is the prefix for index2) minus arr[3-2-1] = arr[0]? \n          But wait: we want the two smallest in the set of three: which are the last two: indices 1 and 2? \n          So we want the sum from index1 to index2? \n          That is: prefix[2] - prefix[0] = 13 - 5 = 8 -> correct.\n\nBut note: our indices: \n  We have the set: [5,5,3] -> indices:0:5, 1:5, 2:3.\n  The two smallest: indices 1 and 2? Actually, the smallest is 3 (index2) and then 5 (index1) -> but wait, 5 is not smaller than 5? They are equal. So the two smallest are the two last: indices1 and 2? \n\nBut note: the prefix array we built is cumulative. So to get the sum from index a to index b (inclusive) we do: prefix[b] - prefix[a-1]. \n\nWe want the sum from index (x-y) to (x-1). \n  In the example: x=3, y=2: \n      from index (3-2)=1 to index 2: that's two elements: indices1 and 2.\n\nBut how to compute the sum of indices1 and 2? \n  prefix[2] = 13 (which is the sum of indices0,1,2)\n  prefix[0] = 5 (which is the sum of index0)\n  So the sum of indices1 and 2 = prefix[2] - prefix[0] = 8.\n\nSo the formula: \n  free_sum = prefix[x-1] - (prefix[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\nBut note: if x-y-1 is negative, we use 0? Actually, we can set a condition: if x-y-1 is negative, then we subtract 0. But in the else branch we have x>y, so x-y>=1, so x-y-1>=0? Actually, if x=1, y=0? but y>=1 by the input (1<=y<=x). So the minimum x-y is 0? but we have x>y so x-y>=1. Therefore, x-y-1 is at least 0. So we can safely do:\n\n  free_sum = arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1]\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is -1? Then we get an index error? Actually, if x=1, y=1: then we are in the if branch (x==y). So in the else branch, x>=2. Then x-y-1 = x-y-1, and since y>=1, then x-y-1 <= x-2. And we have built the prefix for indices 0 to n-1. But note: if x-y-1 might be negative? Only if x-y-1 < 0 -> x-y < 1 -> but we are in the else branch (x>y) so x-y>=1 -> x-y-1>=0. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, in the else branch, we can write:\n    print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? Actually, we have established that in the else branch, x>y, so x-y>=1, so x-y-1>=0. Therefore, we can do:\n\n    print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\n\nBut let me test with x=2, y=1: \n    arr[1] - arr[2-1-1] = arr[1] - arr[0] -> which is the entire set of two minus the first one? That gives the second one? Correct.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n    print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\n\nBut note: we must be cautious about the index. However, we have built the prefix array for the entire array. And we have n elements. The queries x and y are such that 1<=y<=x<=n, so x-1 is at most n-1, and x-y-1 is at least 0 and at most x-2 (which is <= n-2). So it's safe.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n    print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? We said it can't be because x>y. So we are safe.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are given t test cases. For each test case, we are given n (which can be up to 10^9) and we must compute the minimum number of lines needed to have at least n equilateral triangles.\n\nThe code already has a precomputation:\n\n  ctr = [0,0,0]\n  cnt = [0]   # cnt[i] = number of triangles when we have added i lines\n\n  while cnt[-1] < 10**9:\n      i = ctr.index(min(ctr))\n      cnt.append(cnt[-1] + 2*(sum(ctr) - ctr[i]))\n      ctr[i] += 1\n\nThen, for a test case, we do a binary search in the list `cnt` to find the smallest index m such that cnt[m] >= t (where t is the required n). Then we return the index m (which is the number of lines).\n\nBut note: the function `solve` is defined as:\n\n  def solve(sn):\n      t = int(sn)\n      s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n      while s < e:\n          m = (s+e)>>1\n          if cnt[m] >= t:\n              e = m\n          else:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to complete the else branch.\n\nIn the else branch, we know that cnt[m] < t. Then we want to search in the right half. So we set s = m+1.\n\nBut note: the binary search is set up to find the smallest index m such that cnt[m] >= t. \n\nStandard binary search for lower bound:\n\n  while s < e:\n      m = (s+e)//2\n      if cnt[m] >= t:\n          e = m\n      else:\n          s = m+1\n\nThen at the end, s is the answer.\n\nSo the missing code in the else branch is: \n    s = m+1\n\nBut note: the function returns str(s). And the test cases are processed by:\n\n  inp = sys.stdin.read().split()\n  inp.pop(0)   # remove the first element (which is t)\n  print('\\n'.join(map(solve, inp)))\n\nTherefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: \n    s = m+1\n\nBut let me check the example: \n  The note says: \n      In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed. \n      After adding the first line: 0 triangles? \n      Then after the second line: 2 triangles.\n\n  How does the precomputation go?\n\n  Initially: \n      ctr = [0,0,0]\n      cnt = [0]\n\n  Step1: \n      i = index of min(ctr) -> any index, say 0.\n      new_cnt = cnt[-1] + 2*(sum(ctr) - ctr[0]) = 0 + 2*(0-0)=0 -> then we append 0? \n      Then set ctr[0] = 1.\n\n      Now: ctr = [1,0,0], cnt = [0,0]\n\n  Step2:\n      min(ctr) is 0 -> at index1 or 2, say index1.\n      new_cnt = 0 + 2*( (1+0+0) - 0 ) = 2*1 = 2 -> append 2.\n      Then set ctr[1] = 1 -> ctr=[1,1,0]\n\n      cnt = [0,0,2]\n\n  Step3:\n      min(ctr) is 0 at index2.\n      new_cnt = 2 + 2*( (1+1+0) - 0 ) = 2 + 2*2 = 2+4=6 -> append 6.\n      ctr becomes [1,1,1]\n\n  Step4:\n      min(ctr) is 1 at any index, say index0.\n      new_cnt = 6 + 2*( (1+1+1) - 1 ) = 6 + 2*(2) = 6+4=10 -> append 10.\n\n  Then for n=1: we need at least 1 triangle -> the smallest index m such that cnt[m]>=1: \n      m=0: cnt[0]=0 -> <1 -> then set s=1? \n      m=1: cnt[1]=0 -> <1 -> then set s=2? \n      m=2: cnt[2]=2>=1 -> then set e=2 -> then s=2? \n      So we return 2? But the note says 2 lines are needed for n=1? Actually, the note says: \"In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed\". So for n=1 and n=2, we need 2 lines.\n\n  For n=1: the answer is 2? \n  For n=2: the answer is 2? \n  For n=3: we need 3 lines? \n\n  But our precomputation: \n      lines=0: 0 triangles -> not enough for n=1\n      lines=1: 0 triangles -> not enough\n      lines=2: 2 triangles -> enough for n=1 and n=2? \n      lines=3: 6 triangles -> enough for n=3 to n=6? \n\n  However, the note says: \"In the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines as shown below\" for n=3? \n\n  But wait: the note says: \n      \"In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed. After adding the first line, no equilateral triangles will be created no matter where it is added. But after adding the second line, two more triangles will be created at once.\"\n\n  So for n=1: we need 2 lines? \n  for n=2: we need 2 lines? \n  for n=3: we need 3 lines? \n\n  But our precomputation for 2 lines gives 2 triangles, which is >=2, so for n=1 and n=2 we return 2. For n=3, we need 3 lines because 2 lines only give 2 triangles (which is <3). Then 3 lines give 6 triangles (>=3) so we return 3.\n\n  Therefore, the binary search must be set to find the minimal number of lines (which is the index in the cnt array) such that cnt[index] >= n.\n\n  The binary search in the function `solve` is:\n\n      s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1   # s and e are indices in the cnt array.\n      while s < e:\n          m = (s+e)//2\n          if cnt[m] >= t:   # t is the required n\n              e = m\n          else:\n              s = m+1\n\n      return str(s)\n\n  This is standard lower_bound. \n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n        s = m+1\n\nBut note: the precomputation loop builds the cnt array. The index in the cnt array is the number of lines. For example:\n    cnt[0] = 0 -> 0 lines -> 0 triangles\n    cnt[1] = 0 -> 1 line -> 0 triangles\n    cnt[2] = 2 -> 2 lines -> 2 triangles\n    cnt[3] = 6 -> 3 lines -> 6 triangles\n    cnt[4] = 10 -> 4 lines -> 10 triangles\n\n  Then for n=1: we want the smallest index m such that cnt[m]>=1 -> that is m=2 (because cnt[0]=0, cnt[1]=0, cnt[2]=2>=1). So we return 2.\n\n  So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is: \n    print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\n\nand for program2.py is:\n    s = m+1\n\nNow, we output in the specified JSON format.\n\nNote: We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the line that goes in the else branch.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the line that goes in the else branch.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\nIn program1.py, the missing block is a single line. In program2.py, the missing block is a single line.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\",\n  \"program2\": \"            s = m+1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation must be exactly as in the provided code.\n\nIn program1.py, the else branch is indented by 4, and the TODO is at 8 spaces. We should output 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\nIn program2.py, the else branch is inside a while loop and an if, and the TODO is at 12 spaces. We should output 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output the exact string that would replace the TODO.\n\nLet me write the exact strings:\n\nFor program1.py: \n  The current code in the else branch is:\n      else:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO line with: \n          print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\n\n  But note: the TODO line is a comment. We remove that and put the print. The indentation: the else is at 4 spaces, then the next line should be 8 spaces. So the string is: \n        \"        print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\"\n\nFor program2.py:\n  The current code in the else branch is:\n          else:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO line with:\n              s = m+1\n\n  The else is at 8 spaces, and the next line should be 12 spaces. So the string is:\n        \"            s = m+1\"\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"        print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\",\n  \"program2\": \"            s = m+1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\nWe must use double quotes for the JSON keys and values.\n\nHowever, the example uses curly quotes in the problem statement, but we must use standard double quotes.\n\nSo the output:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        print(arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\", \"program2\": \"            s = m+1\"}\n\nBut note: the program1.py code has a closing parenthesis in the print? Actually, in the provided code, the print in the if branch is: \n        print (arr[x-1])\n\nSo we have a space and then the expression. We can do the same: \n        print (arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\n\nBut wait: the provided code uses a space after print? Actually, in the if branch: \n        print (arr[x-1])\n\nSo we should do the same: \n        print (arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact style. However, to be consistent, we use the same style.\n\nTherefore, the corrected string for program1.py: \n        \"        print (arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\"\n\nBut note: the if branch has a space after print. So we do the same.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might not care about the space. But to be safe, we match.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n{\"program1\": \"        print (arr[x-1] - arr[x-y-1])\", \"program2\": \"            s = m+1\"}"
