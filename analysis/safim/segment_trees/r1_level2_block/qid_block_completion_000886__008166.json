But wait: in the case of duplicates, we do:\n\n          Step1: set one duplicate to zero (using one operation) -> now we have one zero and m-1 non-zeros (because we set one non-zero to zero and the other non-zeros remain). Then we use the zero to clear the rest: one operation per non-zero -> total operations = 1 + (m-1) = m. So the answer for a test case is:\n          m = number of non-zero elements\n          if there is at least one zero: then operations = m\n          else:\n              if there is a duplicate (i.e., if the set of non-zero has size less than m): then operations = m\n              else: operations = m+1\n\n      However, note: if there is a duplicate, then the set of non-zero has size less than m. So we can write:\n\n          if there is at least one zero: \n              ans = m\n          else:\n              if len(set(a)) == m:   # because m is the count of non-zero, and if there's no duplicate then the set size is m\n                  ans = m+1\n              else:\n                  ans = m\n\n      But note: what if there are duplicates and no zero? Then we have m non-zeros and the set size is less than m -> then we use m operations. Example: [1,1,2] (no zero) -> m=3, set size=2 -> then ans=3. How?\n          Step1: set one of the 1's to 0 (because we have two 1's) -> [0,1,2] -> then we have one zero and two non-zeros. Step2: set (0,1) -> both to 0 -> [0,0,2] -> then one non-zero. Step3: set (0,2) -> both to 0 -> done. -> 3 operations. So that matches. But what about [1,1,1] (no zero)? m=3, set size=1 (which is less than 3) -> so ans=3. Step1: set two of the 1's: since they are equal, we set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] -> then we have one zero and two non-zeros. Step2: set the two 1's: we set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then one non-zero. Step3: set (0,1) -> both to 0 -> done. -> 3 operations. So the formula holds.

We can do: \n              if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n                  b = b - 1\n                  a.clear()   # then the next time the while condition fails. Then (a==[]) is true -> then we add (c==0) which is 1. Then print: (b_initial-1) + 1 - 0 = b_initial. That matches. So the TODO code:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n              b = b - 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      But note: we are in the loop, and we are popping an element. Then we check a.count(q) in the remaining list. Then we do the above. Example: [1,2,3] (c=0, no duplicate initially) -> \n          a = [1,2,3]\n          pop q=3 -> check a.count(3) in [1,2] -> 0 -> skip.\n          pop q=2 -> check a.count(2) in [1] -> 0 -> skip.\n          pop q=1 -> check a.count(1) in [] -> 0 -> skip. then print: b (which is 3) + 1 (because a is empty and c==0) - 0 = 4 -> correct. Example: [1,1,2] (c=0) -> \n          a = [1,1,2]\n          pop q=2 -> check a.count(2) in [1,1] -> 0 -> skip.\n          pop q=1 -> check a.count(1) in [1] -> 1>0 -> then we do: \n              if c==0 and a.count(1)>0 -> true. then set b = 3-1 = 2\n              then a.clear() -> now a is empty -> break. then print: b (2) + (a==[] -> True)*(c==0 -> 1) - c (0) = 2+1 = 3 -> correct. Example: [1,1,0] (c=1) -> \n          We don't enter the if condition because c==1 (so c>0) -> then we do nothing in the TODO. Then we pop until empty. Then print: b (3) + (a==[] -> True)*(c==0 -> 0) - c (1) = 3+0-1 = 2 -> correct? How many operations? m = 2 non-zeros: \n            Step1: use the zero to clear one non-zero: [0,1,0] -> then we have one non-zero and two zeros. Step2: use a zero to clear the last non-zero -> done. -> 2 operations. Example: [1,1,1] (c=0) -> \n          a = [1,1,1]\n          pop q=1 -> check a.count(1) in [1,1] -> 2>0 -> then we do:\n              c==0 -> true, so we set b = 3-1=2, and clear a -> then break.\n          print: 2 + 1 - 0 = 3 -> correct. Example: [1,2,2] (c=0) -> \n          a = [1,2,2]\n          pop q=2 -> check a.count(2) in [1,2] -> 1>0 -> then we do:\n              c==0 -> true, so set b=3-1=2, and clear a.\n          print: 2+1=3 -> but the correct answer is 3? How many operations? m=3 non-zeros, and there is a duplicate (the two 2's) -> so we should have 3 operations. How?\n            Step1: set one of the 2's to 0 (using the two 2's) -> [1,2,0] -> then we have two non-zeros and one zero. Step2: use the zero to clear the 1: [0,2,0] -> then one non-zero. Step3: use a zero to clear the 2 -> done. -> 3 operations. So 3 is correct. But wait: the array [1,2,2] has a duplicate, so we want 3 operations. The formula: m=3, and there is a duplicate -> so 3 operations. So the code works.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\nThe current code uses a defaultdict `d` to count the frequency of each string.\nThe idea is: for each string `s` (say \"xy\"), we consider two types of pairs:\n  1. Strings that have the same second character but a different first character (i.e., of the form \"?y\" where ? != x).\n  2. Strings that have the same first character but a different second character (i.e., of the form \"x?\" where ? != y).\n\nWe iterate over the 11 letters from 'a' to 'k'. For each string `s` we do:\n  For each letter c in ak:\n      If c != s[0]: then we look for the string c + s[1] and add the count of such strings we have seen so far.\n      If c != s[1]: then we look for the string s[0] + c and add the count of such strings we have seen so far.\n\nHowever, note that the current code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" in the second part. Also, note that the first part is already implemented.\n\nLooking at the current code for the second part:\n    if c != s[1]:\n        if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should add the count of the string (s[0] + c) to the total count. So we should do:\n    count += d[s[0] + c]\n\nBut note: the current code for the first part does exactly that. So we can complete the second part similarly.\n\nHowever, note that the same string might be counted multiple times? But the problem states that we are only counting pairs (i, j) with i<j. The algorithm is processing the strings one by one and counting the pairs that can be formed with the current string and the ones already seen (which are stored in the dictionary). So it is correct.\n\nBut wait: the current code for the first part is:\n    if c != s[0]:\n        if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\nWe can do the same for the second part.\n\nSo the missing line in program1.py is:\n    count += d[s[0] + c]\n\nBut note: the condition `if d[s[0] + c] > 0` is already checked, so we can just add.\n\nHowever, the problem says: the total n over test cases is at most 10^5, so this inner loop runs 11*2 per string, which is 22 per string -> 22 * 10^5 = 2.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the current code for the second part is inside the same loop over `ak` and the same condition. So we just need to add that line.\n\nBut wait: the current code for the first part is already implemented. The TODO is only in the second part.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing line is:\n            count += d[s[0] + c]\n\nBut note: the indentation. It should be at the same level as the comment.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n            count += d[s[0] + c]\n\nBut note: the problem says that the answer may be large and we must use 64-bit integers. The variable `count` is being incremented and is an integer in Python which can be arbitrarily large, so that's okay.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: We are to compute the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to 0.\n\nOperation rules:\n  - Choose two distinct indices i and j.\n  - If a_i = a_j, then we can change one of them to 0.\n  - Otherwise (a_i != a_j), we change both to min(a_i, a_j).\n\nWe want the minimum number of operations to make the entire sequence 0.\n\nThe provided code snippet:\n\n    for n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n        *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0)\n        while a:\n            q=a.pop()\n            if a.count(q)>0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n        print(b+(a==[])*(c==0)-c)\n\nThis code is a bit confusing. Let me try to understand:\n\n  - The input reading: [*open(0)] reads all lines. Then [2::2] takes every second line starting from index 2 (so the first line is t, then the next line is n, then the next line is the array, then the next test case: n, then array, etc.). So [2::2] gives the array lines (the second line of each test case, then the fourth, etc.).\n\n  - For each array line: \n        *a, = map(int, n.split())   -> creates the list a\n        b = len(a)\n        c = a.count(0)\n\n  Then we have a while loop that pops from a until a is empty.\n\n  Inside the loop: \n        q = a.pop()\n        if a.count(q) > 0:   # meaning there is at least one more occurrence of q in the remaining list?\n\n  Then we have a TODO.\n\n  Then the print statement: b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c\n\nThis does not look like a standard solution. We need to figure out the intended logic.\n\nLooking at the note: \n  Example: [1, 2, 3] -> 4 operations.\n\nWe need to design an algorithm:\n\nObservation:\n  - We can consider that an operation can clear at most two non-zero numbers? But note: sometimes we might create zeros and then use them to clear others.\n\nHowever, note the operations:\n  Case 1: If we have two equal non-zero numbers, we can set one of them to 0 in one operation. Then we are left with one non-zero and the other becomes 0? Actually, we set one of them to 0 and the other remains? But then we have to clear the remaining one.\n\n  Case 2: If we have two distinct non-zero numbers, we set both to the minimum. Then we have two numbers that are the same? Then we can use case 1 to set one to 0 and then the other to 0? That would take 2 operations to clear two numbers? But wait: \n      Operation 1: (a_i, a_j) -> both become min(a_i, a_j) = m. Then we have two m's.\n      Operation 2: we can set one of the m's to 0 (since they are equal) -> then we have one m and one 0.\n      Operation 3: then we can take the m and the 0? But note: 0 and m are distinct -> then we set both to min(0, m)=0. So that clears both? Then 2 operations for two numbers? Actually, 3 operations for two numbers? \n\nBut wait: the example: [1,2,3] -> 4 operations.\n\nAlternatively, we can think greedily:\n\n  We note that zeros are helpful because when we pair a non-zero with a zero, we can set the non-zero to zero? Actually, the operation: \n      If we have (0, x) with x != 0: \n          They are distinct -> we set both to min(0,x)=0. So one operation clears one non-zero (and the zero remains).\n\n  So if we have a zero, we can clear one non-zero per operation.\n\n  Without zeros, we have to create zeros.\n\n  How to create zeros?\n      - If we have two equal non-zero numbers: we can set one to zero in one operation (and the other remains non-zero). Then we have one zero and one non-zero. Then we can use the zero to clear the other non-zero in one more operation: total 2 operations for two non-zeros.\n      - If we have two distinct non-zero numbers: \n            Operation1: set both to m (the min). Then we have two m's. \n            Then we can do: Operation2: set one of the m's to 0 (using the same m: so two m's -> set one to 0). \n            Then Operation3: set the remaining m and the 0 to 0? Actually, we can do: (m,0) -> distinct -> set both to min(m,0)=0. So that's 3 operations for two non-zeros.\n\n  But note: we have more than two numbers. We can chain.\n\n  However, the problem asks for the minimum number of operations.\n\n  Alternate Insight:\n\n  We can break the sequence into groups by the value. Let:\n      Let f(x) be the frequency of x (for x != 0).\n\n  Steps:\n\n  We note that:\n      - If we have a zero, we can use it to clear non-zeros one by one (each non-zero takes one operation: pair with zero and become zero). But we can also use non-zeros to clear each other.\n\n  How to minimize operations?\n\n  We can consider:\n\n      Operation types:\n        Type A: when we pair two distinct non-zero numbers (without any zero) to create two same numbers? Then we can use that to create a zero? Then we can use that zero to clear others.\n\n      However, the example: [1,2,3] -> 4 operations.\n\n      How?\n          Step1: pair (1,2) -> both become 1 -> [1,1,3]\n          Step2: pair (1,1) -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,3]\n          Step3: pair (0,1) -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,3]\n          Step4: pair (0,3) -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0]\n\n      So we used 4 operations.\n\n      Alternatively, we could have:\n          Step1: pair (1,3) -> both become 1 -> [1,2,1]\n          Step2: pair (1,2) -> both become 1 -> [1,1,1]\n          Step3: pair (1,1) -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,1]\n          Step4: pair (0,1) -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,1]\n          Step5: pair (0,1) -> set both to 0 -> [0,0,0] -> 5 operations, which is worse.\n\n      So the strategy matters.\n\n  Known solution from known problems (this problem is from a contest):\n\n      We can use the following:\n\n        Let m = number of non-zero elements.\n\n        We know that if there is at least one zero, then we can clear each non-zero in one operation (by pairing with a zero). So total operations = m.\n\n        If there is no zero, then we have to create a zero. How?\n\n          We can break the non-zero numbers into groups by their value. \n\n          If there is a duplicate (at least two same numbers), then we can create a zero in 1 operation (by setting one of them to zero) and then we have m-1 non-zeros and one zero. Then we can clear the rest in m-1 operations. Total = 1 + (m-1) = m.\n\n          But if there are no duplicates? Then we have distinct non-zero numbers. Then we cannot create a zero in one operation. We have to:\n\n            Step1: take two distinct numbers and set both to the minimum. Then we create two same numbers (if we set two distinct numbers to the min, then we have two min values). Then we have a duplicate. Then we can create a zero in the next operation (by setting one of the duplicates to zero). Then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros. Then we clear the rest in (m-2) operations (because we started with m non-zeros, we turned two of them into the same min, then we turned one of those into zero and the other remains? Actually, we turned two into the same min, then we set one of the min to zero -> so we have one zero and one min and the other m-2 numbers. Then we use the zero to clear the min: one operation, and then the other m-2 numbers: m-2 operations. So total: 1 (first operation) + 1 (to create zero) + 1 (to clear the min) + (m-2) (to clear the rest) = m+1? \n\n          But wait: after step1: we set two distinct numbers to the min. Then we have two min values and the rest. Then step2: we set one of the min to zero. Then we have one min and one zero and the rest. Then step3: we use the zero to clear the min: one operation. Then we have one zero and the rest m-2 non-zeros. Then we clear the rest m-2 non-zeros in m-2 operations. Total: 1 + 1 + 1 + (m-2) = m+1.\n\n          However, we can do:\n\n            Step1: set two distinct numbers (say a and b, a<b) to a -> then we have two a's and the rest.\n            Step2: set one of the a's to zero (using the two a's) -> then we have one a and one zero and the rest.\n            Then we can use the zero to clear the other a: one operation -> then we have one zero and the rest m-2 non-zeros.\n            Then we clear the rest m-2 non-zeros in m-2 operations. Total: 1 + 1 + 1 + (m-2) = m+1.\n\n          But note: we can avoid the step of clearing the other a? Actually, we can use the zero to clear any non-zero. So after step2, we have one zero and the rest non-zeros (which are m-1 non-zeros: because we started with m, we changed two of them: one became zero and the other remains a, and the rest m-2 remain). So total non-zeros is 1 (the a) + (m-2) = m-1. Then we clear the entire m-1 non-zeros in m-1 operations. Total: 1 (step1) + 1 (step2) + (m-1) = m+1.\n\n          So if there are no duplicates and no zeros initially, then the answer is m+1.\n\n          But wait: what if m=0? Then we don't need any operations. But m>=? The problem says n>=2, but the array can have zeros.\n\n      However, the example: [1,2,3] -> m=3, no duplicates, no zeros -> then answer = 3+1 = 4, which matches.\n\n      But what about [1,2,3,4]? Then m=4, no duplicates -> answer = 5.\n\n      How?\n          Step1: set (1,2) to 1 -> [1,1,3,4] -> cost=1\n          Step2: set (1,1) -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,3,4] -> cost=2\n          Then we have 3 non-zeros: 1,3,4 and one zero. Then we can clear:\n          Step3: set (0,1) -> both to 0 -> [0,0,3,4] -> cost=3\n          Step4: set (0,3) -> both to 0 -> [0,0,0,4] -> cost=4\n          Step5: set (0,4) -> both to 0 -> done -> cost=5.\n\n      So 5 operations.\n\n      But is there a better way? \n          Step1: set (1,3) to 1 -> [1,2,1,4] -> cost=1\n          Step2: set (1,2) to 1 -> [1,1,1,4] -> cost=2\n          Step3: set (1,1) -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,1,4] -> cost=3\n          Step4: set (0,1) -> both to 0 -> [0,0,1,4] -> cost=4\n          Step5: set (0,1) -> both to 0 -> [0,0,0,4] -> cost=5\n          Step6: set (0,4) -> both to 0 -> done -> 6 operations.\n\n      So the first way is better.\n\n      Alternatively, we can try to create two zeros at the same time? \n          Step1: set (1,2) to 1 -> [1,1,3,4] -> cost=1\n          Step2: set (3,4) to 3 -> [1,1,3,3] -> cost=2\n          Step3: set (1,1) -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,3,3] -> cost=3\n          Step4: set (3,3) -> set one to 0 -> [0,1,0,3] -> cost=4\n          Then we have two zeros. Then:\n          Step5: set (0,1) -> both to 0 -> [0,0,0,3] -> cost=5\n          Step6: set (0,3) -> both to 0 -> done -> 6 operations.\n\n      So the minimal is 5.\n\n      Therefore, the formula:\n\n        Let m = number of non-zero elements.\n\n        If there is at least one zero in the beginning: then we can clear in m operations.\n\n        Else (no zero initially):\n            If there is at least one duplicate (i.e., at least one number appears at least twice): then we can clear in m operations (because we can create a zero in one operation without increasing the total non-zero count? Actually, we set one duplicate to zero and then we have m-1 non-zeros and one zero, then we clear the rest in m-1 operations: total m).\n\n            Else (all distinct): then we need m+1 operations.\n\n      But wait: in the case of duplicates, we do:\n\n          Step1: set one duplicate to zero (using one operation) -> now we have one zero and m-1 non-zeros (because we set one non-zero to zero and the other non-zeros remain). Then we use the zero to clear the rest: one operation per non-zero -> total operations = 1 + (m-1) = m.\n\n      So the answer for a test case is:\n          m = number of non-zero elements\n          if there is at least one zero: then operations = m\n          else:\n              if there is a duplicate (i.e., if the set of non-zero has size less than m): then operations = m\n              else: operations = m+1\n\n      However, note: if there is a duplicate, then the set of non-zero has size less than m. So we can write:\n\n          if there is at least one zero: \n              ans = m\n          else:\n              if len(set(a)) == m:   # because m is the count of non-zero, and if there's no duplicate then the set size is m\n                  ans = m+1\n              else:\n                  ans = m\n\n      But note: what if there are duplicates and no zero? Then we have m non-zeros and the set size is less than m -> then we use m operations.\n\n      Example: [1,1,2] (no zero) -> m=3, set size=2 -> then ans=3.\n\n      How?\n          Step1: set one of the 1's to 0 (because we have two 1's) -> [0,1,2] -> then we have one zero and two non-zeros.\n          Step2: set (0,1) -> both to 0 -> [0,0,2] -> then one non-zero.\n          Step3: set (0,2) -> both to 0 -> done. -> 3 operations.\n\n      So that matches.\n\n      But what about [1,1,1] (no zero)? \n          m=3, set size=1 (which is less than 3) -> so ans=3.\n          Step1: set two of the 1's: since they are equal, we set one to 0 -> [0,1,1] -> then we have one zero and two non-zeros.\n          Step2: set the two 1's: we set one to 0 -> [0,0,1] -> then one non-zero.\n          Step3: set (0,1) -> both to 0 -> done. -> 3 operations.\n\n      So the formula holds.\n\n      However, note: the provided code snippet:\n\n          for n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0)\n              while a:\n                  q=a.pop()\n                  if a.count(q)>0:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n              print(b+(a==[])*(c==0)-c)\n\n      We see:\n          b = len(a) = n (the length of the array)\n          c = count of zeros\n\n      Then the print statement: b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c\n\n      But note: after the while loop, a is empty? Because we are popping until empty.\n\n      The while loop: \n          while a: \n              q = a.pop()\n              if a.count(q) > 0: then do something?\n\n      What is the intended logic? \n\n      The intended logic might be to count duplicates? \n\n      Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n          m = b - c   # number of non-zero elements\n\n          Then:\n          if c > 0: # there is at least one zero\n              ans = m\n          else:\n              if there is a duplicate in the non-zero numbers: \n                  ans = m\n              else:\n                  ans = m+1\n\n      How to check for duplicates in non-zero numbers? We can do:\n\n          non_zero = [x for x in a if x != 0]\n          if len(non_zero) == len(set(non_zero)):\n              then no duplicates -> then if there's no zero we use m+1, else m.\n          but if there is a duplicate, then we use m.\n\n      However, the provided code does:\n\n          while a:\n              q = a.pop()\n              if a.count(q) > 0: \n                  # TODO\n\n      This is inefficient (a.count(q) is O(n) and we are doing for each element, so O(n^2)) and n<=100, so acceptable.\n\n      What is the purpose of the while loop? It might be to remove duplicates? \n\n      The variable b is the length of the array. Then we subtract c (the zeros) and then we have m = b - c.\n\n      The print statement: b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c\n\n          = b - c + (a==[])*(c==0)\n\n          = m + (a==[])*(c==0)\n\n      But note: after the while loop, a is empty -> so (a==[]) is True -> then we add 1 if c==0, else 0.\n\n      So: \n          if c>0: then we print m + 0 = m.\n          if c==0: then we print m + 1.\n\n      But wait: that would be m+1 in the no zero case, but we want m+1 only when there are no duplicates? \n\n      So the current code without the TODO would always do:\n\n          if there is at least one zero: m\n          else: m+1\n\n      But that is not correct: because if there are duplicates and no zero, we want m, not m+1.\n\n      Therefore, the TODO must be adjusting the count to account for duplicates? \n\n      The code in the TODO is inside the loop that pops an element and then checks if there is another occurrence of the same value in the remaining list. \n\n      How about: if we find a duplicate, then we set a flag to indicate that there is a duplicate? Then we can subtract 1 at the end? \n\n      But the print statement is fixed. Alternatively, the code might be trying to adjust the variable that is printed.\n\n      Alternatively, the code might be trying to remove duplicates? \n\n      Let me try to interpret the intended logic:\n\n          We have:\n            b = n (the length)\n            c = count of zeros\n\n          Then we want to compute the answer.\n\n          The current print statement: \n              print(b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c)\n\n          Without duplicates, we want: \n              if there is a zero: ans = m = b - c\n              if no zero and no duplicate: ans = m+1 = (b - c) + 1\n              if no zero and duplicate: ans = m = b - c\n\n          So the print statement currently gives (b - c) + (1 if c==0 else 0). \n\n          We want to avoid adding 1 if there is a duplicate (and no zero).\n\n          How about: if we find at least one duplicate, then we subtract 1 from the entire expression? But note: the expression is printed at the end.\n\n          Alternatively, we can set a flag:\n\n            has_dup = False\n            while a:\n                q = a.pop()\n                if a.count(q) > 0:\n                    has_dup = True\n\n            Then we can adjust the print statement.\n\n          But the code does not have a flag. \n\n      Another possibility: the while loop is intended to remove duplicates? And then the variable b is adjusted? \n\n      Actually, the variable b is set at the beginning and not changed.\n\n      How about: the TODO is to break out of the loop? Because if we find one duplicate, then we know there is a duplicate? Then we can break? But then we don't know if there is a duplicate? We need to know if there is at least one duplicate.\n\n      Alternatively, we can set a variable:\n\n          dup = 0\n          while a:\n              q = a.pop()\n              if a.count(q) > 0:\n                  dup = 1\n\n          Then the answer = (b - c) + (1 if c==0 and dup==0 else 0)\n\n          Then we can print: (b - c) + (1 if c==0 and dup==0 else 0)\n\n          But the print statement is fixed: b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c = (b - c) + (1 if c==0 else 0)\n\n          So we want to subtract 1 in the case when c==0 and dup==1? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            ans = (b - c) + (1 if c==0 else 0)\n            if dup and c==0:\n                ans -= 1\n\n          But the print statement is fixed. We cannot change it.\n\n      Therefore, the intended logic might be to adjust the variable b? \n\n      The code:\n\n          b = len(a)\n\n      Then we do:\n\n          while a:\n              q = a.pop()\n              if a.count(q) > 0:\n                  # TODO: we do something to b?\n\n      How about: we remove one occurrence of q from the list? But then we are popping anyway.\n\n      Alternatively, we can decrement b? \n\n      But note: the variable b is the initial length. We need that to compute m = b - c.\n\n      Another idea: the variable b is being used in the print statement. We want to subtract 1 from the entire expression in the case of duplicate and no zero? \n\n          print(b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c)\n\n          = (b - c) + (1 if c==0 else 0)\n\n          We want: \n            if c>0: then we want (b-c) = m.\n            if c==0 and there is a duplicate: we want (b-c) = m.\n            if c==0 and no duplicate: we want (b-c)+1 = m+1.\n\n          So we want to avoid adding 1 when there is a duplicate and c==0.\n\n          How about: if we find a duplicate, then we set a variable that will cause the term (a==[])*(c==0) to be 0? \n\n          But the term (a==[]) is always true at the end.\n\n      Alternatively, we can adjust the variable c? But c is the count of zeros.\n\n      Or we can adjust b? \n\n          We want: \n            if there is a duplicate and c==0, then we want to print: (b - c)   [without adding 1]\n            otherwise, we print: (b - c) + (1 if c==0 else 0)\n\n          So if we set b = b - 1 in the case of duplicate and c==0? But we don't know c==0 at the time of the loop? \n\n      Actually, we know c at the beginning.\n\n      How about:\n\n          if c == 0: \n              # then we are going to add 1 at the end, but if we find a duplicate we don't want that 1.\n              # so we can set a flag and then subtract 1 at the end? But we cannot change the print statement.\n\n      Another idea: the TODO is to break the loop and then set a variable? But the print statement is fixed.\n\n      Alternatively, the code might be intended to remove duplicates and then the length of the list becomes the number of distinct non-zero numbers? \n\n      But the problem: we need to know the total non-zero count (m) and whether there is a duplicate.\n\n      I think the provided code is not following the standard solution. \n\n      Let me try to reframe the provided code:\n\n          b = n (the length of the array)\n          c = count of zeros\n\n          Then the while loop: \n            while a is not empty:\n                pop an element q\n                if there is another q in the remaining list (a.count(q)>0) then do something.\n\n          What if we remove the duplicate we found? \n\n          We can remove one occurrence of q from the list? But we are popping from the list, so we are removing the last element. Then we check if there is another q in the remaining list. \n\n          How about: we want to count the number of duplicates? \n\n          Actually, the standard solution only needs to know: is there at least one duplicate? \n\n          So we can break after finding one duplicate? \n\n          Then:\n\n            dup = 0\n            while a and not dup:\n                q = a.pop()\n                if q in a:   # but note: a.count(q) might be inefficient, but n<=100\n                    dup = 1\n\n            Then the answer = (b - c) + (1 if c==0 and not dup else 0)\n\n          But the print statement is fixed: b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c\n\n          We cannot change the print statement.\n\n      How about: the TODO is to set a variable that will be used in the print statement? But the print statement is fixed.\n\n      Alternatively, the TODO is to adjust the variable c? \n\n      Or the variable b? \n\n      The print statement: b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c\n\n      We want to subtract 1 in the case of duplicate and c==0? \n\n          Then we can set b = b - 1 in the TODO? \n\n      But then we are changing b? \n\n      How about: if we find a duplicate and c==0, then we set b = b - 1? \n\n      But we are in the loop, and we know c at the beginning. \n\n      We can do:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n              b = b - 1   # then we break? because we only need one duplicate?\n\n      Then the print statement: \n          b + (a==[])*(c==0) - c\n\n          = (b_initial - 1) + 1 - 0   [if we found a duplicate and c==0] \n          = b_initial - 1 + 1 = b_initial.\n\n          But we want the answer to be m = b_initial - c = b_initial (since c=0) -> so we want b_initial.\n\n          But wait: without duplicate, we would have:\n              b = b_initial\n              then print: b_initial + 1 - 0 = b_initial+1.\n\n          And with duplicate, we set b = b_initial-1, then print: (b_initial-1) + 1 = b_initial.\n\n          So that matches: \n              if duplicate: we get b_initial (which is m, since m = b_initial because c=0)\n              if no duplicate: we get b_initial+1.\n\n      But what if there are multiple duplicates? We only need to set b once. So we can break after the first duplicate? \n\n      How about:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n              b = b - 1\n              break   # break out of the while loop? \n\n      But the problem: we are popping the last element. We break after popping one element and finding a duplicate? Then the list a is not empty? But the while loop condition: we break so we don't process the rest.\n\n      But the print statement has (a==[]): if we break, then a is not empty? Then (a==[]) is False -> then we add 0? \n\n          Then the print statement: b - c = (b_initial-1) - 0 = b_initial-1.\n\n          But we want b_initial (which is the original length) for m? \n\n      Alternatively, we don't break? Then we might decrement b multiple times? That would be wrong.\n\n      We only want to decrement b once.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0 and not_used_yet:\n              b = b - 1\n              not_used_yet = False   # so we don't do it again\n\n      But we don't have such a flag.\n\n      Alternatively, we break after the first time we decrement b.\n\n      But then the list a is not empty, so (a==[]) is false -> then the term (a==[])*(c==0) becomes 0.\n\n          Then we print: b - c = (b_initial-1) - 0 = b_initial-1.\n\n          But we want the answer to be b_initial (which is the number of non-zeros, and we want that as the answer when there is a duplicate and no zero).\n\n          So we are missing 1.\n\n      How about: we break and then we empty the list? \n\n          We can do: \n              if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n                  b = b - 1\n                  a.clear()   # then the next time the while condition fails.\n\n          Then (a==[]) is true -> then we add (c==0) which is 1.\n\n          Then print: (b_initial-1) + 1 - 0 = b_initial.\n\n          That matches.\n\n      So the TODO code:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n              b = b - 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      But note: we are in the loop, and we are popping an element. Then we check a.count(q) in the remaining list. Then we do the above.\n\n      Example: [1,2,3] (c=0, no duplicate initially) -> \n          a = [1,2,3]\n          pop q=3 -> check a.count(3) in [1,2] -> 0 -> skip.\n          pop q=2 -> check a.count(2) in [1] -> 0 -> skip.\n          pop q=1 -> check a.count(1) in [] -> 0 -> skip.\n          then print: b (which is 3) + 1 (because a is empty and c==0) - 0 = 4 -> correct.\n\n      Example: [1,1,2] (c=0) -> \n          a = [1,1,2]\n          pop q=2 -> check a.count(2) in [1,1] -> 0 -> skip.\n          pop q=1 -> check a.count(1) in [1] -> 1>0 -> then we do: \n              if c==0 and a.count(1)>0 -> true.\n              then set b = 3-1 = 2\n              then a.clear() -> now a is empty -> break.\n          then print: b (2) + (a==[] -> True)*(c==0 -> 1) - c (0) = 2+1 = 3 -> correct.\n\n      Example: [1,1,0] (c=1) -> \n          We don't enter the if condition because c==1 (so c>0) -> then we do nothing in the TODO.\n          Then we pop until empty.\n          Then print: b (3) + (a==[] -> True)*(c==0 -> 0) - c (1) = 3+0-1 = 2 -> correct? \n          How many operations? \n            m = 2 non-zeros: \n            Step1: use the zero to clear one non-zero: [0,1,0] -> then we have one non-zero and two zeros.\n            Step2: use a zero to clear the last non-zero -> done. -> 2 operations.\n\n      Example: [1,1,1] (c=0) -> \n          a = [1,1,1]\n          pop q=1 -> check a.count(1) in [1,1] -> 2>0 -> then we do:\n              c==0 -> true, so we set b = 3-1=2, and clear a -> then break.\n          print: 2 + 1 - 0 = 3 -> correct.\n\n      Example: [1,2,2] (c=0) -> \n          a = [1,2,2]\n          pop q=2 -> check a.count(2) in [1,2] -> 1>0 -> then we do:\n              c==0 -> true, so set b=3-1=2, and clear a.\n          print: 2+1=3 -> but the correct answer is 3? \n          How many operations? \n            m=3 non-zeros, and there is a duplicate (the two 2's) -> so we should have 3 operations.\n\n          How?\n            Step1: set one of the 2's to 0 (using the two 2's) -> [1,2,0] -> then we have two non-zeros and one zero.\n            Step2: use the zero to clear the 1: [0,2,0] -> then one non-zero.\n            Step3: use a zero to clear the 2 -> done. -> 3 operations.\n\n          So 3 is correct.\n\n      But wait: the array [1,2,2] has a duplicate, so we want 3 operations. The formula: m=3, and there is a duplicate -> so 3 operations.\n\n      So the code works.\n\n      However, note: what if the duplicate is not in the last element? \n\n          Example: [2,1,2] -> \n          a = [2,1,2] -> when we pop, we get 2, then the remaining list is [2,1] -> a.count(2) in [2,1] is 1 -> so we do the clear.\n\n      So the order doesn't matter.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n              b = b - 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      But note: the condition: we are inside the if a.count(q)>0. And we have the variable c (which is the count of zeros) and a (the list) and b (the length) available.\n\n      So we write:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n              b -= 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      But note: we are popping the last element. The list a at the time of the condition is the list without the popped element? \n\n      Yes: we did q = a.pop(), so the list a now has one less element.\n\n      But the condition a.count(q) > 0: we are counting the remaining list.\n\n      This matches.\n\n      However, note: what if the same element appears more than twice? We only need to know if there is at least one duplicate. So clearing after the first duplicate is enough.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n              b -= 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      But note: the variable c is defined at the beginning and does not change. It is the initial count of zeros.\n\n      We are not changing the zeros in the array? We are only counting initially.\n\n      This is acceptable.\n\n      So the final answer:\n\n        program1: the missing line is: \"            count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n        program2: the missing block is: \n            if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n                b -= 1\n                a.clear()\n\n      But note: in program2, the code is inside the while loop and the if condition. We must write the code with the same indentation.\n\n      However, the problem says: output only the missing code. And the format is a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n      For program1, the missing code is a single line.\n\n      For program2, the missing code is a block of two lines (with proper indentation).\n\n      But note: the TODO in program2 is inside the if condition. So the block we are to write is:\n\n          if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n              b -= 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      We must write it with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\n      The current code in program2 for the TODO is:\n\n        if a.count(q)>0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n      So we replace the TODO comment with:\n\n        if c == 0 and a.count(q) > 0:\n            b -= 1\n            a.clear()\n\n      But note: the condition we are in is already if a.count(q)>0. So we can write:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            b -= 1\n            a.clear()\n\n      However, we only want to do this if c==0 and there is a duplicate (which we already checked: a.count(q)>0). So we can write:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            b -= 1\n            a.clear()\n\n      But that is equivalent? Because we are already in the if a.count(q)>0.\n\n      However, the condition a.count(q)>0 is true, so we can skip checking again? \n\n      But the problem: we are in the block of \"if a.count(q)>0\", so we know that condition is true. Then we only need to check c==0.\n\n      So we can write:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            b -= 1\n            a.clear()\n\n      This is more efficient.\n\n      But the original condition in the problem is: if there is a duplicate and no zero. So we require both: no zero (c==0) and a duplicate (which we have by the outer if). \n\n      So we can write:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            b -= 1\n            a.clear()\n\n      This is sufficient.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            b -= 1\n            a.clear()\n\n      But note: we must break out of the loop? The a.clear() will make the list empty, so the while loop will break. So we don't need to break explicitly.\n\n      So the code for program2 is:\n\n        if c == 0:\n            b -= 1\n            a.clear()\n\n      Now, we output in the required JSON format.\n\n      Example output:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"            count += d[s[0] + c]\",\n          \"program2\": \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n        }\n\n      But note: the indentation in program2: the TODO is at the same level as the outer if. The outer if is:\n\n          if a.count(q)>0:\n              # TODO\n\n      So the code we write should be indented one level deeper than the outer if? \n\n      The outer if is already indented. The missing code should be:\n\n          if c == 0:\n              b -= 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      And the current indentation level for the TODO is 8 spaces? (since the while loop is 4, the if is 8). Then the inner if should be 12, and the two lines inside 16.\n\n      But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the context.\n\n      However, the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n      We can write:\n\n          program2: \n            \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n\n      How many spaces? The outer if is at 8 spaces (if the code uses 4 spaces per level). Then the inner if should be 8+4=12? But the TODO comment is at the same level as the outer if condition. We are replacing the TODO comment with the block.\n\n      So the block should be at the same level as the TODO comment? \n\n      Actually, the TODO comment is at the same level as the outer if. We are going to write multiple lines. The first line is an if statement at the same level, and then two lines indented one more.\n\n      But the existing code has:\n\n          while a:\n              q=a.pop()\n              if a.count(q)>0:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n          if c == 0:\n              b -= 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      So the entire block is:\n\n          if a.count(q)>0:\n              if c == 0:\n                  b -= 1\n                  a.clear()\n\n      So the missing code is:\n\n          if c == 0:\n              b -= 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      And the indentation: the first line of the missing code should be at the same level as the outer if's body (which is 8 spaces if the base is 4). Then the next two lines at 12 spaces.\n\n      But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the original program uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n      We can write:\n\n          \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n\n      This is 8 spaces for the first line and 12 for the next two? Actually, 8 and 12? \n\n      But the outer if body is at 8 spaces. Then the inner if should be 12? \n\n      However, the TODO comment is at 8 spaces. We are replacing the TODO comment with:\n\n          \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n\n      But that would be:\n\n          Line1: 8 spaces + \"if c == 0:\"\n          Line2: 12 spaces + \"b -= 1\"\n          Line3: 12 spaces + \"a.clear()\"\n\n      How many spaces? \n\n        The base: \n          while a: -> 4\n          q = a.pop() -> 8\n          if a.count(q)>0: -> 8\n          then the body of the if: 12? \n\n      But the original TODO comment is at 8? That doesn't match. \n\n      Actually, the body of the if is indented one more level. So the TODO comment should be at 12? \n\n      But the code provided for program2 is:\n\n          for n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0)\n              while a:\n                  q=a.pop()\n                  if a.count(q)>0:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n              print(b+(a==[])*(c==0)-c)\n\n      The TODO is at the same level as the body of the while and the body of the for? \n\n      Actually, the while loop body is indented by 4, and the if condition and the TODO are at 8? \n\n      Then the missing code should be at 8? But we are writing an if block. \n\n      We can write:\n\n          if c == 0:\n              b -= 1\n              a.clear()\n\n      This is three lines. The first line (if) should be at the same level as the TODO (which is 8). Then the body of the if should be 12.\n\n      So:\n\n          Line1: 8 spaces + \"if c == 0:\"\n          Line2: 12 spaces + \"b -= 1\"\n          Line3: 12 spaces + \"a.clear()\"\n\n      How to represent? \n\n        \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n\n      This uses 8 spaces for the first line and 12 for the next two (if we assume that 4 more spaces are added for each level).\n\n      But the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. So we output the string with the exact spaces.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use tabs? But the problem says spaces.\n\n      We'll use the above.\n\n      Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        program1: \"            count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n        program2: \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n\n      But note: in program1, the line is exactly as we wrote. The existing code has:\n\n            if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We replace the TODO with: \"count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n\n      And the indentation: the TODO is at the same level as the outer if. The outer if is:\n\n          if c != s[1]:\n              if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                  # TODO\n\n      So the TODO is at 16 spaces? (if 4 per level: 4 for for-loop, 4 for if, 4 for inner if -> 12? then the body of the inner if is 16). \n\n      But the code we are writing is at 16 spaces? \n\n      We write: \"            count += d[s[0] + c]\" -> 12 spaces? \n\n      Actually, the original code:\n\n          from collections import defaultdict\n          ak = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\"]\n\n          t = int(input())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              count = 0\n              d = defaultdict(int)\n              n = int(input())\n              for i in range(n):\n                  s = input()\n                  for c in ak:\n                      if c != s[0]:\n                          if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                              count += d[c + s[1]]\n                      if c != s[1]:\n                          if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                              # TODO: Your code here\n                  d[s] += 1\n              print(count)\n\n      The TODO is inside two ifs and a for loop and the outer for loop. The indentation:\n\n          for _ in range(t): -> 4\n              ... (4 spaces)\n              for i in range(n): -> 8\n                  ... (8 spaces)\n                  for c in ak: -> 12\n                      ... (12 spaces for the two ifs and their bodies)\n\n      The TODO is inside:\n\n          if c != s[1]: -> 12\n          then if d[...] > 0: -> 16\n          then the TODO at 20? \n\n      But the code we wrote: \"            count += d[s[0] + c]\" -> 12 spaces? \n\n      Actually, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But the existing code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n      The TODO is at 20 spaces? Then we should write 20 spaces? \n\n      But the problem says: output the missing code. We can count the spaces in the provided code for the TODO: it is at 16? \n\n      Actually, the provided code for program1 has:\n\n          if c != s[1]:\n              if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The first if: at 12 (because the for c in ak is at 8, then the body of the for is 12). Then the inner if: 16. Then the TODO: 20.\n\n      So we should write 20 spaces? \n\n      But the problem says: output only the missing line. We can write:\n\n          \"                count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n\n      (16 spaces? because the inner if body is 16? Actually, the inner if body is 16, so we write at 16? But the TODO is at 16? Then we write at 16.)\n\n      How many spaces? \n\n          Level 0: 0\n          Level 1 (for _ in): 4\n          Level 2 (for i in): 8\n          Level 3 (for c in): 12\n          Level 4 (if c != s[1]): 12 -> but the body of the for c in ak is 12, so the if is at 12? Then the body of the if (the inner if) is 16, and the body of the inner if is 20.\n\n      Actually, the inner if condition is at 16, and the body of the inner if is 20.\n\n      So the missing line should be at 20 spaces? \n\n      But the code we are replacing is at 20 spaces? \n\n      We write: 20 spaces + \"count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n\n      But the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? It only requires the code to run. \n\n      However, the problem says: output the missing code. We can output with the same indentation as the TODO (which is 20 spaces). \n\n      But the TODO is a comment. We are replacing it with a statement. \n\n      Alternatively, we can output the line without worrying about the exact spaces? But the problem says the code must run.\n\n      We can output:\n\n          \"                count += d[s[0] + c]\"   # 16 spaces? \n\n      How? \n\n          The for loop (for c in ak) is at 8, then the body of the for loop is 12. Then the if c != s[1] is at 12. Then the inner if is at 16. Then the body of the inner if is 20? \n\n      Actually, the provided code:\n\n          for c in ak:\n              if c != s[0]:\n                  ...   # this is at 16\n              if c != s[1]:\n                  if ...:   # this if is at 16\n                      ...   # this is at 20\n\n      So the TODO is at 20. We write at 20: 20 spaces.\n\n      But 20 spaces is a lot. We can write:\n\n          \"                    count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n\n      (20 spaces: 5 levels * 4 spaces = 20)\n\n      But the problem: the existing code for the first part (which is implemented) is:\n\n          if c != s[0]:\n              if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                  count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n      The line \"count += ...\" is at 20 spaces.\n\n      So we should write the same for the second part.\n\n      Therefore, the missing line for program1 is 20 spaces + \"count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n\n      We can write: \"                    count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n\n      But note: the line above the TODO is:\n\n          if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n\n      which is at 16 spaces. Then the TODO is at 20. So we write at 20.\n\n      So the final answer:\n\n        program1: \"                    count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n        program2: \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n\n      But wait: in program2, the existing code:\n\n          while a:\n              q=a.pop()\n              if a.count(q)>0:\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The TODO is at 12 spaces? (if the base is 4: while->4, then q=...->8, then if->8, then body of if->12). Then we write:\n\n          if c == 0:   -> at 12 spaces\n          then the body: 16 spaces.\n\n      So:\n\n          program2: \n            Line1: 12 spaces? -> we write \"    if c == 0:\" (but 4 spaces) -> but we need 12? \n\n      How about: we write:\n\n          \"    if c == 0:\\n        b -= 1\\n        a.clear()\"\n\n      But that would be 4 and 8? \n\n      We must write 12 and 16? \n\n      We can write:\n\n          \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n\n      This is 8 and 12? \n\n      But the TODO is at 8? \n\n      Actually, the code for program2 is:\n\n          for n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0)\n              while a:\n                  q=a.pop()\n                  if a.count(q)>0:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The while loop is at 4, the q=a.pop() at 8, the if at 8, and the body of the if at 12? \n\n      But the TODO is at 12? \n\n      Then we write:\n\n          Line1: 12 spaces + \"if c == 0:\"\n          Line2: 16 spaces + \"b -= 1\"\n          Line3: 16 spaces + \"a.clear()\"\n\n      So:\n\n          program2: \n            \"        if c == 0:\\n            b -= 1\\n            a.clear()\"\n\n      But wait: 12 spaces is represented by 12/4=3 tabs? But we use spaces. 12 spaces: \"            \" (12 spaces) is too long. \n\n      Actually, we can use 4 spaces per level. The structure:\n\n          for ...:   -> level0: 0\n          ... (body of for: 4 spaces)\n              while ...:   -> 4\n              ... (body of while: 8 spaces)\n                  if ...:   -> 8\n                  ... (body of if: 12 spaces)\n\n      So the TODO is at 12. We write:\n\n          Line1: 12 spaces: \"            if c == 0:\"\n          Line2: 16 spaces: \"                b -= 1\"\n          Line3: 16 spaces: \"                a.clear()\"\n\n      But that is 12 and 16. \n\n      How many characters? \n\n          \"            if c == 0:\" -> 12 spaces at the beginning? \n\n      We can write:\n\n          program2: \"            if c == 0:\\n                b -= 1\\n                a.clear()\"\n\n      But the existing TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n      Alternatively, we can count the spaces in the provided program2 code for the TODO: it is at 8? \n\n      The provided program2 code:\n\n          for n in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              *a,=map(int,n.split());b=len(a);c=a.count(0)\n              while a:\n                  q=a.pop()\n                  if a.count(q)>0:\n                      # TODO: Your code here\n\n      The for loop: 0\n      The next line: 4\n      The while: 4\n      The q=a.pop(): 8\n      The if: 8\n      The TODO: 12\n\n      So 12 spaces.\n\n      Therefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n\n          \"            if c == 0:\\n                b -= 1\\n                a.clear()\"\n\n      But note: the next line after the TODO is the end of the while loop? We are replacing the TODO with three lines. Then the while loop continues? But we do a.clear() which breaks the while loop.\n\n      So it's okay.\n\n      Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        program1: \"                    count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n        program2: \"            if c == 0:\\n                b -= 1\\n                a.clear()\"\n\n      But wait: in program1, the line is at 20 spaces? \n\n      The structure:\n\n          for _ in range(t):   -> 0\n          ... (4)\n          for i in range(n):   -> 4\n          ... (8)\n          for c in ak:   -> 8\n          ... (12)\n          if c != s[1]:   -> 12\n          ... (16)\n          if d[...] > 0:   -> 16\n          ... (20)\n\n      So 20 spaces: 20/4=5, so 5 levels.\n\n      We write: 20 spaces: \"                    \" (20 spaces) and then the code.\n\n      But 20 spaces is a string of 20 spaces.\n\n      We can write:\n\n          program1: \"                    count += d[s[0] + c]\"\n\n      This is 20 spaces at the beginning.\n\n      Alternatively, we can use the exact string.\n\n      Now, we output the JSON.\n\n      Example:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"                    count += d[s[0] + c]\",\n          \"program2\": \"            if c == 0:\\n                b -= 1\\n                a.clear()\"\n        }\n\n      But note: the newline in program2 must be represented as \\n.\n\n      We are done."
