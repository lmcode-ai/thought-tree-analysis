However, the condition: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5. So we can do a while loop that runs at most (n/m) times per test case? but the worst-case m=1, then clones = n, and the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the total clones over test cases would be 10^5? But note: the while loop runs clones from 0 to ceil(n/m)-1, and the total over test cases: \n            For a test case with n, the number of iterations is ceil(n/m) which is at most n. \n            The sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so the total iterations would be at most 10^5? However, worst-case: one test case with n=10, m=1 -> 10 iterations. Then another test case with n=10, m=1 -> 10 iterations.

But note: integer division in Python: (0)//3 is 0. Therefore, we can do:\n\n        clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1 \n        ans += clones\n        break\n\n  This is efficient.

We can do:\n\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n  But note: the while loop condition is m<n, and we break inside when we have enough. Therefore, we can replace the while loop with:\n\n          count = 0\n          while m < n:\n              count += 1\n              if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                  break\n          ans += count\n\n  But wait: the while loop condition is already m<n, so we can do:\n\n          count = 0\n          current = m\n          while current < n:\n              count += 1\n              current += m   # because we clone and get m more copies\n          ans += count\n\n  However, that is simpler? Example: n=6, m=2: \n              current=2 -> count=0 -> 2<6 -> count=1, current=4 -> 4<6 -> count=2, current=6 -> break -> ans = 4+2=6. This is the same. But note: the condition is while current < n, and we break when current>=n. We can do:\n\n              count = 0\n              current = m\n              while current < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n              ans += count",

This is acceptable. But note: we must initialize current and count? We can do:\n\n              current = m   # we start with m copies\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:   # this condition is true initially, and we break inside when current>=n\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n                  if current >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n          Example: n=6, m=2: current=2, count=0 -> enter loop:\n                  count=1, current=4 -> 4<6 -> continue? but we don't break -> then next iteration:\n                  count=2, current=6 -> break -> ans = 4+2=6. Example: n=4, m=3: \n              current=3, count=0 -> enter loop:\n                  count=1, current=6 -> break -> ans = (4-3)+1=2. This works. But note: we are updating current and count. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              current = m\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n                  if current >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n  However, we can avoid the variable current? We know that after k clones, current = m*(k+1). We can do:\n\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n  This avoids the current variable.",

Then we set n = len(li.split()) -> which is the length of the array? which should be n1? So it's correct. Now, we can compute:\n\n            ans = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          But note: the while loop condition: while (m < n). We can break out of the loop by not entering if m==n? However, we can simply set:\n\n            ans = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          and then break? But the code has a while loop. We must use the while loop?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given n, q and a list of prices. We sort the prices in descending order and compute a prefix sum array s.\nFor each query (x, y): \n  The customer must purchase at least x items. To maximize the free value (which is the sum of the cheapest y items in the purchase), \n  the customer would want to have as many cheap items as possible in the purchase. However, note that the free items are the cheapest y in the purchase.\n  The strategy: the customer will buy exactly x items. Why? Because if they buy more, they might include items that are more expensive and hence not free? \n  But note: the problem says \"if a customer purchases at least x items, then the y cheapest are free\". So we can choose any set of at least x items.\n  However, to maximize the free value, we want the y cheapest to be as large as possible. How? \n  We can choose which items to buy. We want to have y free items that are as expensive as possible. But note: the free items are the cheapest among the purchased ones.\n  Therefore, we want to have a set that has y items that are as expensive as possible, but note that if we include too many cheap items, then the free ones (the cheapest) will be the cheap ones.\n\n  Alternate approach: \n  Since we are allowed to choose any set of at least x items, we can choose exactly x items (because if we choose more, we can always drop the extra ones and not harm the free part: because the free part is the y cheapest, and if we drop an item that is not among the y cheapest, then the free part remains the same; but if we drop an item that is among the y cheapest, then we might get a cheaper set of free items? Actually, we want the free items to be as expensive as possible. So including more items might allow us to have a set of y free items that are more expensive? \n\n  However, note: the problem says \"y cheapest of them are free\". So if we buy more than x, then we have more items and the y cheapest might become smaller? \n\n  Actually, the optimal strategy is to buy exactly x items. Why?\n  Because if we buy more than x, say x+k, then the free items are the y cheapest in the entire set. But note that we can always choose a subset of exactly x items that contains the y items we want to be free and the rest being the most expensive ones. However, including extra items that are cheaper than the ones we have would force the free set to include those cheaper ones? \n\n  Therefore, we can assume that the customer buys exactly x items. Then the free value is the sum of the y smallest items in that set.\n\n  How to maximize the free value? We want the y smallest items in the set to be as large as possible. So we should avoid including very cheap items. \n\n  We can do:\n    We choose the set of x items that minimizes the presence of cheap items. Specifically, we can take the x largest items? But then the y smallest in that set would be the last y of the x largest? \n\n  Example: \n    n=5, prices = [1,2,3,4,5] (sorted ascending) -> we sort descending: [5,4,3,2,1]\n    Query: x=3, y=2 -> we take the 3 largest: [5,4,3]. The two smallest in this set are 3 and 4? -> no, the two smallest are 3 and 4? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 4? But wait: in the set [5,4,3] the two smallest are 3 and 4? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 4? Then the sum is 7? But note: the example in the note: \n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\" -> wait, that example has two 5's and one 3? Then the two cheapest are 3 and 5? \n\n  Actually, the example input: \n      n=3, q=3, p=[5,3,5]\n      Query1: x=3, y=2 -> free = 3+5 = 8? But note: the two cheapest in [5,3,5] are 3 and 5? But 3 is the smallest and then 5? So 3+5=8.\n\n  How do we get that? \n    We sort the prices in descending order: [5,5,3]\n    We want to choose x=3 items -> we have to take all. Then the two smallest are the last two: 5 and 3? -> but that would be 5+3=8? \n\n  So the idea: \n    We sort the prices in descending order. Then the set we choose for a query (x,y) is the top x items? But then the y smallest in that set are the last y items of the top x? \n\n  However, note: we are allowed to choose any set of at least x items. But if we choose a set that is not the top x, could we get a better free value? \n  Example: [5,5,3] and x=3, y=2: we must take all. \n  What if we have [1,2,3,4,5] and x=3, y=2? \n      Option1: take the top 3: [5,4,3] -> free: 3+4 = 7.\n      Option2: take [5,4,2] -> then the two smallest are 2 and 4 -> 6 -> worse.\n      Option3: take [5,4,1] -> 1+4=5 -> worse.\n      Option4: take [5,3,2] -> 2+3=5 -> worse.\n      Option5: take [4,3,2] -> 2+3=5 -> worse.\n\n  So the best is to take the top x items? \n\n  Why? Because we want the free items to be as expensive as possible. The free items are the y smallest in the set. To maximize the sum of the free items, we want the y smallest to be as large as possible. Therefore, we want to avoid including very small items. The best way is to take the x largest items. Then the y smallest in that set are the last y of the x largest, which are the largest among the small ones we are forced to include.\n\n  Therefore, for a query (x,y):\n      The free value = the sum of the smallest y items in the set of the top x items.\n\n  But note: we have sorted the array in descending order. So the top x items are p[0] to p[x-1]. The smallest y items in that set are the last y of that segment: from p[x-y] to p[x-1]? \n\n  Example: [5,5,3] (descending) for x=3, y=2: \n      The segment: [5,5,3] -> the last two: 5 and 3 -> but wait, that would be 5+3=8? But the example says 8. However, note: the example says the two cheapest are 3 and 5 -> which is 8.\n\n  But wait: in the set [5,5,3], the two smallest are 3 and 5? Actually, 3 is the smallest and then 5? So the two smallest are 3 and 5? \n\n  However, in the sorted descending array, the last two are [5,3]? Actually, the array is [5,5,3] -> the last two are 5 and 3? \n\n  But note: the array is sorted descending, so the smallest in the set is the last element. The two smallest are the last two: [5,3]? \n\n  Actually, the two smallest in the set are the two smallest numbers, regardless of order. In the set {5,5,3} the two smallest are 3 and 5? But there are two 5's. So the two smallest are 3 and 5? \n\n  How do we compute the sum? \n      We have the prefix sum array s for the descending array. \n      The entire set of x items: from index0 to index x-1.\n      The smallest y items in that set: they are the last y items in the descending array? \n      But note: in the descending array, the last part is the smallest.\n\n      So the segment we want: from index (x-y) to index (x-1) in the descending array? \n        Example: x=3, y=2: indices from 1 to 2? \n          s[3] = 5+5+3 = 13\n          s[1] = 5\n          Then the sum of the last two = s[3]-s[1] = 8 -> which is correct.\n\n      Therefore: \n          free_value = s[x] - s[x-y]\n\n  But wait: our prefix sum array s is 0-indexed with s[0]=0, s[1]=p0, s[2]=p0+p1, ... s[i] = sum of first i items (which are the top i items).\n\n      So for the top x items: the total sum = s[x]\n      The sum of the largest (x-y) items = s[x-y]   (because the first x-y items in the descending array are the largest)\n      Then the sum of the smallest y items in the set = s[x] - s[x-y]\n\n  Example: [5,5,3] -> s[0]=0, s[1]=5, s[2]=10, s[3]=13.\n      x=3, y=2: free_value = s[3]-s[1] = 13-5 = 8 -> correct.\n\n  Another example: [5,5] for x=2, y=1: \n      s[0]=0, s[1]=5, s[2]=10.\n      free_value = s[2]-s[1] = 10-5 = 5 -> correct.\n\n  Example: [1,2,3,4,5] (descending: [5,4,3,2,1])\n      Query: x=3, y=2: free_value = s[3]-s[1] = (5+4+3) - (5) = 12-5=7 -> which is 3+4=7? But wait: the two smallest in [5,4,3] are 3 and 4 -> 7 -> correct.\n\n  However, note: the example in the note: \n      Third query: x=5, y=3 -> free_value = s[5]-s[2] = (5+4+3+2+1) - (5+4) = 15-9=6 -> which is 1+2+3=6 -> correct.\n\n  Therefore, for each query (x, y):\n        free_value = s[x] - s[x-y]\n\n  But note: our prefix sum array s is built for the entire descending array. We have s[0]=0, s[1]=p0, s[2]=p0+p1, ... s[n]=sum of all.\n\n  However, what if x-y is negative? The problem states: y<=x, so x-y>=0.\n\n  So in program1.py, we can complete the for loop as:\n\n      for _ in [0]*q:\n          x, y = Y()\n          # Then compute: value = s[x] - s[x-y]\n          O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\n  But note: our array p has n items. We built s with n+1 elements: indices 0..n.\n      s[0]=0, s[1]=p[0], s[2]=p[0]+p[1], ... s[n]=total.\n\n  The query: x and y are given. We must have x<=n? (because x<=n by the input constraint). And x-y is between 0 and x.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      for _ in [0]*q:\n          x, y = Y()\n          O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  We are given t test cases. For each test case, we are given n and an array a.\n\n  We are to compute the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\n  Operations:\n      Type1: clone any array (costs 1 operation)\n      Type2: swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) on any positions (each swap costs 1 operation)\n\n  We start with one copy.\n\n  We note that we can do multiple clones and swaps arbitrarily.\n\n  The goal: at least one copy that has all elements equal.\n\n  Example: \n      Test case 1: [1,1,1] -> already all equal -> 0 operations.\n\n  Test case 2: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the example says 6 operations.\n\n  How to think?\n      We can use the following strategy:\n        We are going to create a copy that has all elements equal to a particular value, say x.\n        How do we get x in every position of one copy?\n          We need to have n copies of x in one array. \n\n        Initially, we have one copy of the array. We can clone and then swap elements arbitrarily.\n\n        Note: swapping between copies is allowed. So we can gather all the x's from all the clones we make.\n\n        Steps:\n          Step 1: We clone the original array as many times as needed. Each clone operation costs 1.\n          Step 2: We swap elements to move all x's into one array.\n\n        How many x's do we have in the entire set of arrays? \n          Initially, we have one array. Then we do k clone operations -> we have k+1 arrays.\n          The total number of x's is (frequency of x) * (k+1).\n\n        We need to have one array that has n x's. Therefore, we require: \n          (frequency of x) * (k+1) >= n   [because we need n x's for one array]\n\n        But note: we can also use other values? Actually, we are going to swap. We can swap an x from one array with a non-x from the target array? \n\n        The process:\n          We start with k+1 arrays. We choose one array to be the target. Initially, the target array has some x's and some non-x's. \n          We want to replace the non-x's in the target array with x's. For each non-x in the target array, we need to get an x from somewhere else.\n\n          However, we can also use x's that are in the target array? We don't need to swap those.\n\n          How many x's do we need in the target? We need n x's. The target initially has, say, f (which is the frequency of x in the original array) x's? \n          Actually, the target array initially has the same frequency as the original? But we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. \n\n          The total number of x's available in all arrays is f*(k+1). We need to assign n of them to the target. The rest can be distributed arbitrarily.\n\n          But note: we cannot create x's out of nothing. So we require f*(k+1) >= n.\n\n          How many swaps are needed?\n            The target array initially has f0 x's (which is the frequency of x in the original array? but note: the target array is one of the copies, so it has the same initial content). \n            We need to replace (n - f0) positions in the target array with x's. For each such replacement, we need to bring an x from another array and we have to put the non-x element somewhere else.\n\n            However, we can also swap between non-target arrays? But note: we are only concerned with making the target array all x. We don't care about the others.\n\n            For each non-x in the target array, we can swap it with an x from any other array. Each such swap fixes one element in the target.\n\n            Therefore, the number of swaps required is (n - f0).\n\n          But wait: what if we don't have enough x's? We require f*(k+1) >= n. We choose k to be the smallest integer such that f*(k+1) >= n.\n\n          Then the total operations = k (for cloning) + (n - f0) (for swaps).\n\n          However, note: the target array initially has f0 x's. So we only need to replace (n - f0) non-x's. And we have (f*(k+1) - f0) x's available in the non-target arrays? \n          Actually, we have f*(k+1) x's in total. We use n of them for the target. The rest are free to be anywhere. So we can indeed get (n - f0) x's from the non-target arrays.\n\n          Therefore, for a fixed x, the operations would be:\n            k = ceil(n / f) - 1   [because we need k+1 >= ceil(n/f) -> k = ceil(n/f)-1]\n            swaps = n - f0   [but note: f0 is the frequency of x in the original array? and we are using the same x?]\n\n          However, wait: the target array is one of the copies. The frequency of x in the target array initially is f0 (which is the same as the original). Then we need to replace (n - f0) elements.\n\n          But note: we are going to use x's from other arrays. The other arrays also have x's. The total available x's is f*(k+1). We are going to take (n - f0) x's from the non-target arrays? \n          But note: we can also take x's from the target array? Actually, we don't need to take the x's that are already in the target. We only need to replace the non-x's.\n\n          Therefore, the number of swaps is (n - f0).\n\n          Then total operations for this x: k + (n - f0) = (ceil(n/f) - 1) + (n - f0)\n\n          But note: we are free to choose x? Actually, we can choose any x that appears in the array. We want the minimal total operations.\n\n          However, the example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] (n=6). \n            Let x=0: \n                f = frequency(0) = 2.\n                k = ceil(6/2)-1 = ceil(3)-1 = 3-1 = 2.\n                swaps = 6 - 2 = 4.\n                total = 2+4 = 6 -> matches the example.\n\n            Let x=3:\n                f=2 -> same: k=2, swaps=6-2=4 -> total=6.\n\n            Let x=1: f=1 -> k=ceil(6/1)-1=6-1=5, swaps=6-1=5 -> total=10.\n            Let x=7: same as 1.\n\n          So the minimal is 6.\n\n          But what if we choose x that is not in the array? Then we cannot use it because we don't have that element. So we only consider x that appears.\n\n  However, wait: the example note says:\n        Step1: clone -> now two arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> 1 operation (so k=1, but we have k+1=2 arrays) -> then they do some swaps and then clone again and then more swaps.\n\n        But our calculation for x=0: k=2 (meaning two clone operations) -> then we have 3 arrays? \n\n        How does the example get 6 operations? \n          They did:\n            Operation1: clone -> 1 op (now 2 arrays)\n            Then 2 swaps? (they say: swap to get [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3]) -> 2 swaps? but then they did:\n            Operation2: clone the first array -> 1 op (total 2 ops) -> now 3 arrays\n            Then swap two elements in the first two copies: two swaps? -> 2 ops (total 4 ops) \n            Then total operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) + 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 6.\n\n        But our formula for x=0: \n            k = 2 (meaning two clone operations) -> 2 operations for cloning\n            swaps = 4 -> 4 swap operations\n            total = 6.\n\n        So it matches.\n\n        Why did the example break it into two sets of swaps? \n          They did:\n            First: after the first clone, they swapped two elements to get two zeros into the first array? \n            Then they cloned the first array (which now has three zeros) and then swapped two more zeros in.\n\n          But note: we are counting the total number of swaps: 4.\n\n        Therefore, the formula for a fixed x is:\n            Let f = frequency of x in the original array.\n            Let k = minimal integer such that f*(k+1) >= n -> k = ceil(n/f) - 1.\n            Then total operations = k + (n - f)   [because the target array initially has f x's, so we need to replace n-f non-x's]\n\n        But note: the target array is one of the copies. The frequency of x in the target array is f? \n\n        However, what if we choose a different x? The frequency f is the frequency of x in the original array. The target array initially has the same frequency f.\n\n        Therefore, for each distinct x, we compute:\n            k = ceil(n/f) - 1\n            total_ops = k + (n - f)\n\n        Then we take the minimum total_ops over all distinct x that appear.\n\n        But note: what if we choose an x that does not appear? then f=0 -> skip.\n\n        However, the problem says: we need to create a copy where all elements are equal. So we must choose an x that appears at least once.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          For each test case:\n            n = ... \n            a = list of n integers\n            Count frequencies: we already have m = max frequency? but note: we are going to iterate over distinct numbers? \n\n          Actually, the current code:\n\n            n=len(li:=li.split());   # This is incorrect: because li.split() gives the list of strings of the array, and then n is the length of that list? which is n? \n            But the next line: m = max(Counter(li).values())   -> m is the maximum frequency of any element.\n\n          However, note: the array elements can be negative and large, but we are using the string representation. This might be problematic? \n          But the input: the second line of the test case contains n integers. We are reading from open(0) and then for each test case we take every second line starting from the second line of the entire input.\n\n          The code: \n            for li in [*open(0)][2::2]:   # the first line is t, then the next lines: first line of test case: n, second line: the array. So [2::2] skips the first two lines? \n\n          Actually, the input structure:\n            t\n            (then for each test case: \n                n\n                a1 a2 ... an)\n\n          The [*open(0)] is a list: \n            index0: t\n            index1: n1\n            index2: a1 ... \n            index3: n2\n            index4: a2 ...\n\n          Then [2::2] takes every other line starting at index2: so the lines with the arrays.\n\n          Then: \n            n = len(li.split())   -> this sets n to the number of elements in the array? which is the n from the input? \n\n          But the next line: \n            m = max(Counter(li).values())   -> m is the maximum frequency.\n\n          Then: \n            ans = n - m   # which would be the number of swaps if we didn't do any cloning? \n\n          Then the while loop: \n            while (m < n):\n                # ... \n\n          How do we update? \n\n          We have: \n            total_ops = k + (n - m)   for the element with frequency m? \n\n          But note: we are iterating over distinct elements? Actually, we are not. We are using the maximum frequency m. \n\n          Why the maximum frequency? \n            Because if we choose the element with the highest frequency, then we minimize k (since k = ceil(n/f)-1, and f is maximized so k is minimized) and also (n-f) is minimized.\n\n          Therefore, the element with the maximum frequency will yield the minimal total operations.\n\n          Why? \n            Let f1 and f2 be frequencies and f1>=f2.\n            k1 = ceil(n/f1)-1, k2 = ceil(n/f2)-1 -> since f1>=f2, then k1<=k2.\n            And (n-f1) <= (n-f2).\n            So k1+(n-f1) <= k2+(n-f2).\n\n          Therefore, we only need to consider the element with the maximum frequency.\n\n          So the minimal total operations = (ceil(n/m) - 1) + (n - m)\n\n          How to compute ceil(n/m)? \n            We can do: \n                k = (n + m - 1) // m - 1   ? \n            But note: \n                We want the smallest integer k such that m*(k+1) >= n.\n\n            k+1 = ceil(n/m) -> so k = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n            How to compute ceil(n/m)? \n                ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1   [for positive integers]\n\n          Therefore: \n                k = (n-1)//m   # because ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1, then k = (n-1)//m\n\n          Then total_ops = (n-1)//m + (n - m)\n\n          But wait: \n            Example: n=6, m=2 -> \n                k = (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 -> then total_ops = 2 + (6-2) = 6 -> correct.\n\n          Example: n=3, m=3 -> \n                k = (3-1)//3 = 2//3 = 0 -> total_ops = 0 + (3-3)=0 -> correct.\n\n          Example: n=4, m=3 -> \n                k = (4-1)//3 = 3//3 = 1 -> total_ops = 1 + (4-3)=2.\n\n          But let's check: \n            We choose the element with frequency 3. \n            We need 4 of that element in the target array. \n            We start with 3 in the target. We need one more. \n            How many clones? \n                k+1 must be at least ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> so k=1 (one clone operation). \n            Then we have two arrays -> total of 3*2=6 elements. \n            We need to take one element from the non-target arrays to put in the target. \n            So one swap. \n            Total operations: 1 (clone) + 1 (swap) = 2 -> matches.\n\n          Therefore, we can compute:\n            ans = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          But note: the current code sets ans = n-m initially, and then we are going to update in the while loop? \n\n          The current code:\n\n            ans = n - m\n            while (m < n):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We can simulate the cloning process? \n\n          Alternatively, we can break the problem into:\n\n            We are going to do k clone operations and then (n-m) swap operations? \n            But note: the formula is k = ceil(n/m)-1, and then total = k + (n-m).\n\n          However, the while loop condition is while (m < n). What is the purpose?\n\n          The example note: \n            They did two cloning operations? and then 4 swaps? \n\n          How does the while loop work? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We start with one array. We have m copies of the element we are using (the one with max frequency). \n            We need n copies in the target. \n            We can do:\n                Let k = 0 (number of clones) and available = m (the current total copies of the element in all arrays).\n                While available < n:\n                    We do a clone: k++ and available += m   (because we clone an array that has m copies of the element? but wait, we are cloning an array that has the same distribution? so the new array has m copies? but note: we are going to use the element from the entire set of arrays, so the total available becomes available + m? \n                    Then we use one operation for the clone.\n\n                Then we need to do (n - m) swaps? \n\n          But note: the target array initially has m copies. We need to replace n-m non-copies. But we have available - m (from the non-target arrays) to use? Actually, we have available in total, and we use n for the target. The rest are available to be swapped. \n\n          However, the number of swaps is n - m (the initial m in the target are already in place, we need to bring n-m more from anywhere). \n\n          Therefore, the total operations = k (clones) + (n-m) (swaps).\n\n          How to compute k? \n            We start with available = m, and then while available < n:\n                k += 1\n                available += m   # because we clone one array and that array has m copies of the element? \n\n            But note: when we clone, we clone an entire array. The entire array has m copies of the element. So we get m more copies? \n\n          Then k is the smallest integer such that: m + k*m >= n   -> k >= (n-m)/m -> k = ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil((n/m)-1) -> but note: \n            m + k*m >= n  -> k >= (n-m)/m -> k = ceil((n-m)/m)\n\n          But note: \n            Example: n=6, m=2 -> (6-2)/2 = 4/2=2 -> k=2 -> total=2+4=6 -> correct.\n\n          Example: n=4, m=3 -> (4-3)/3 = 1/3 -> ceil(1/3)=1 -> k=1 -> total=1+1=2 -> correct.\n\n          Example: n=3, m=3 -> (3-3)/3=0 -> ceil(0)=0 -> total=0+0=0 -> correct.\n\n          Therefore, we can compute k = ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m-1)//m + 1? \n            But note: ceil(a) = (a-1)//1 + 1? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do: \n            k = 0\n            current = m\n            while current < n:\n                k += 1\n                current += m   # because we clone and get m more copies\n\n          Then total_ops = k + (n-m)\n\n          We can simulate in the while loop:\n\n            ans = n - m   # this is the swap part\n            current = m   # total available copies of the element\n            k = 0\n            while current < n:\n                k += 1\n                current += m\n            total_ops = k + (n-m)\n\n          But note: the current code sets ans = n-m initially, and then we are going to update in the while loop? \n\n          The current code:\n\n            ans = n-m\n            while (m < n):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We can update ans by adding 1 for each clone? and also we are increasing the available copies? but we don't track available copies? \n\n          Alternatively, we can update ans as we do clones? \n\n          How about:\n\n            We start with:\n                clones = 0\n                available = m\n                swaps = n - m   # we will need this many swaps\n\n            But we cannot do the swaps until we have enough available copies? \n\n            Actually, each clone operation gives us m more copies. We need total available >= n.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                while available < n:\n                    # do a clone: one operation\n                    clones += 1\n                    available += m\n                total_ops = clones + (n-m)\n\n          But note: the condition in the while loop is m < n -> which is the same as n-m>0. But we break when available>=n? \n\n          However, the while loop condition is while (m < n). This condition is fixed? \n\n          Actually, we are not updating m. So the condition m<n is always true? and we would loop infinitely? \n\n          We must change the condition? \n\n          Alternatively, we can break the problem without simulation: \n            We know: \n                k = ceil((n-m)/m)   -> but note: (n-m) might be 0? then k=0.\n\n            But we can compute k = (n - m + m - 1) // m = (n-1)//m   -> but wait: \n                ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(n/m - 1) = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n                But we know: ceil(n/m) = (n-1)//m + 1, so ceil(n/m)-1 = (n-1)//m.\n\n            Then total_ops = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            ans = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          But note: the current code has:\n\n            ans = n-m\n            while (m < n):\n                ...   # we are going to update ans?\n\n          How about we do:\n\n            ans = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          But wait: what if m==0? but m is the max frequency, and n>=1, so m>=1.\n\n          Therefore, we can break out of the while loop by not entering if we don't need to clone? \n\n          However, the problem says: the minimal number of operations. We have a formula.\n\n          The current code structure:\n\n            for li in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n = len(li:=li.split())   # This is incorrect: because the array is given as a string of n integers, so len(li.split()) is n? \n                m = max(Counter(li).values())\n                ans = n - m\n                while (m < n):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          But note: the variable n is set to the length of the array? which is the same as the n from the input? \n\n          However, the input for the test case: \n            first line: n (the integer)\n            second line: n integers\n\n          But we are reading the second line as li. Then we do:\n                li = li.split()   -> list of n strings? \n                n = len(li)   -> which is the same as the n from the input? \n\n          But the problem says: the first line of the test case is n. We are not using that n? \n\n          Actually, the code: \n            for li in [*open(0)][2::2]:   # this skips the first two lines? \n            But the first two lines are: \n                line0: t\n                line1: n1 (for the first test case) \n            Then line2: the array for the first test case.\n\n          Then we set n = len(li.split()) -> which is the length of the array? which should be n1? \n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          Now, we can compute:\n\n            ans = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          But note: the while loop condition: while (m < n). We can break out of the loop by not entering if m==n? \n\n          However, we can simply set:\n\n            ans = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          and then break? \n\n          But the code has a while loop. We must use the while loop? \n\n          Alternatively, we can update the ans in the while loop? \n\n          The intended logic in the while loop in the given code:\n\n            while (m < n):\n                # we are going to simulate the clone operations? \n\n          How about:\n\n            We know that each clone operation gives m more copies. We start with m copies. We need n copies. \n            The number of clones needed is the smallest k such that m + k*m >= n -> k = ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m-1)//m + 1? \n\n          But note: the while loop condition is m<n, and we are not updating m? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            # We have one array initially. We need to get at least n copies of the element. \n            # The total copies we have: initially m (in the first array). \n            # Each clone operation: we get one more array, which has m copies? so total copies becomes m*(clones+1) [because we have clones+1 arrays]\n            while m*(clones+1) < n:\n                clones += 1\n            ans = clones + (n - m)\n\n          Then we break? \n\n          But the while loop condition is m<n. We can do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            while m < n:\n                # We do one clone: \n                clones += 1\n                # Now, the total copies becomes m*(clones+1) \n                # But we don't update m? \n                # Actually, we break when m*(clones+1) >= n?\n                if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                    break\n\n            ans = clones + (n-m)\n\n          But this is inefficient? because the number of clones might be large? but note: the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and m>=1, so clones <= n/m <= n, and the sum of n is 10^5, so worst-case n=10^5, m=1 -> clones=10^5, and the total over test cases is 10^5, so worst-case 10^5 test cases? but t<=10000 and the sum of n<=10^5, so the total n over test cases is 10^5. \n\n          However, the condition: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5. So we can do a while loop that runs at most (n/m) times per test case? but the worst-case m=1, then clones = n, and the total n over test cases is 10^5, so the total clones over test cases would be 10^5? \n\n          But note: the while loop runs clones from 0 to ceil(n/m)-1, and the total over test cases: \n            For a test case with n, the number of iterations is ceil(n/m) which is at most n. \n            The sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so the total iterations would be at most 10^5? \n\n          However, worst-case: one test case with n=10, m=1 -> 10 iterations. Then another test case with n=10, m=1 -> 10 iterations. But the sum of n is 10^5, so the total number of test cases is at most 10^5? but the problem says the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5. \n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            # We break when m*(clones+1) >= n\n            while m < n:\n                clones += 1\n                if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                    break\n            ans += clones   # because initially ans = n-m, then we add the clone operations.\n\n          But wait: the initial ans = n-m, then we add clones -> total_ops = (n-m) + clones.\n\n          This matches: total_ops = clones + (n-m)\n\n          Example: n=6, m=2: \n            clones: \n                initially: m=2, n=6 -> m<n -> enter loop.\n                clones=1 -> m*(clones+1)=2*2=4 <6 -> continue\n                clones=2 -> m*(clones+1)=2*3=6>=6 -> break.\n                clones=2 -> ans = (n-m) + clones = 4+2=6 -> correct.\n\n          Example: n=4, m=3:\n            clones=0 -> m=3, n=4 -> enter loop.\n            clones=1 -> 3*(1+1)=6>=4 -> break.\n            ans = (4-3) + 1 = 1+1=2 -> correct.\n\n          Example: n=3, m=3: \n            m==n -> skip the loop -> ans = (3-3)=0 -> then we add clones=0 -> 0 -> correct.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            clones = 0\n            while m < n:\n                clones += 1\n                if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                    break\n            ans += clones\n\n          But note: the while loop condition is m<n, and we break inside when we have enough copies. \n\n          However, we can also do without the break by changing the condition? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            while m * (clones+1) < n:\n                clones += 1\n            ans += clones\n\n          But the condition in the while loop: we start with clones=0, and then we check: m*1 < n? then clones=1, then check m*2 < n? ... until we have m*(clones+1)>=n.\n\n          Then we break. \n\n          But the condition in the while loop is: while m*(clones+1) < n: \n            clones += 1\n\n          Then we break when m*(clones+1)>=n.\n\n          Then we set ans += clones.\n\n          This is the same.\n\n          However, the current code has:\n\n            while (m < n):\n\n          We must change the condition? \n\n          But note: if m>=n, we skip the loop. So we can do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            # We only enter if m < n\n            while m < n and m*(clones+1) < n:\n                clones += 1\n            ans += clones\n\n          But wait: if m*(clones+1) becomes >=n, we break? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            while m < n:\n                if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                    break\n                clones += 1\n\n          But that would be an infinite loop? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            while m < n:\n                clones += 1\n                if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                    break\n            ans += clones\n\n          This is the same as above.\n\n          Therefore, we can write:\n\n            clones = 0\n            while m < n:\n                clones += 1\n                if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                    break\n            ans += clones\n\n          But note: the condition m*(clones+1)>=n must eventually hold because m>=1 and n is fixed. \n\n          So we can also do:\n\n            clones = 0\n            while m < n:\n                clones += 1\n                # We break when we have enough copies: m*(clones+1) >= n\n                if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                    break\n            ans += clones\n\n          This is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        clones = 0\n        while m < n:\n            clones += 1\n            if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                break\n        ans += clones\n\n  But note: we must initialize clones=0.\n\n  However, the code currently:\n\n        ans = n-m\n        while (m < n):\n            # ... \n\n  We can do:\n\n        clones = 0\n        while m < n:\n            clones += 1\n            if m * (clones+1) >= n:\n                break\n        ans += clones\n\n  But note: we are updating ans by adding clones.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do without the extra variable clones? \n\n        count = 0\n        while m < n:\n            count += 1\n            if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                break\n        ans += count\n\n  This is the same.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        count = 0\n        while m < n:\n            count += 1\n            if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                break\n        ans += count\n\n  But note: the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n  We are only to output the missing code for the TODO part.\n\n  For program1.py: the missing code is one block (a for loop body) and for program2.py: the missing code is the block inside the while loop and the update of ans.\n\n  However, the TODO in program2.py is inside the while loop and then we have to update ans? \n\n  The current code for program2.py:\n\n      for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n=len(li:=li.split());\n          m = max(Counter(li).values())\n          ans =n-m\n          while(m<n):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          print(ans)\n\n  We need to fill the while loop and then update ans? \n\n  But note: the while loop must break and then we update ans? Actually, we are updating ans inside the while loop? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n=len(li:=li.split());\n          m = max(Counter(li).values())\n          ans =n-m\n          if m < n:   # we don't need the while loop? we are going to break after one update? \n              # But we might need multiple clones? \n          Actually, we are going to do a while loop that breaks after we count the number of clones.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n  But note: the while loop condition is m<n, and we break inside when we have enough. \n\n  Therefore, we can replace the while loop with:\n\n          count = 0\n          while m < n:\n              count += 1\n              if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                  break\n          ans += count\n\n  But wait: the while loop condition is already m<n, so we can do:\n\n          count = 0\n          current = m\n          while current < n:\n              count += 1\n              current += m   # because we clone and get m more copies\n          ans += count\n\n  However, that is simpler? \n\n          Example: n=6, m=2: \n              current=2 -> count=0 -> 2<6 -> count=1, current=4 -> 4<6 -> count=2, current=6 -> break -> ans = 4+2=6.\n\n          This is the same.\n\n          But note: the condition is while current < n, and we break when current>=n.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              count = 0\n              current = m\n              while current < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n              ans += count\n\n          This is simpler and avoids the multiplication each time? \n\n          But the multiplication is the same as adding? \n\n          We prefer the addition.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              count = 0\n              current = m\n              while current < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n              ans += count\n\n  But note: the current code already has:\n\n          ans = n - m\n\n          Then we do:\n\n          count = 0\n          current = m\n          while current < n:\n              count += 1\n              current += m\n          ans += count\n\n  Then we break out of the while loop? \n\n  However, the code has a while loop with condition (m<n). We are replacing that while loop? \n\n  Actually, the TODO is inside the while loop. We are going to replace the entire while loop? \n\n  But the problem says: output the missing code for the TODO. \n\n  We can do:\n\n      for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n=len(li:=li.split());\n          m = max(Counter(li).values())\n          ans =n-m\n          if m < n:\n              count = 0\n              current = m\n              while current < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n              ans += count\n          print(ans)\n\n  But the problem says: the TODO is inside the while loop. \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          n=len(li:=li.split());\n          m = max(Counter(li).values())\n          ans =n-m\n          # We are going to use the while loop that is already there?\n          count = 0\n          current = m\n          while m < n:   # we change the condition to current < n? but the condition is m<n -> which is the same as the initial condition? \n          Actually, we can do:\n\n              # We are inside the while loop: but the condition is m<n, which is true initially, but we want to break when current>=n?\n              # We can do:\n\n              count = 0\n              current = m\n              while m < n:   # but m is fixed, so this condition never changes -> we break inside?\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n                  if current >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n          But then we break out of the while loop? \n\n          However, the problem says: the while loop condition is (m<n). We are not allowed to change the condition? \n\n          We must use the given while loop condition? \n\n          But note: the problem says \"complete the code\", so we can change the condition? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              current = m\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  # We do one clone: \n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n                  if current >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n          But then we break out of the while loop? \n\n          However, the condition m<n is fixed? so if we break, we break the while loop? \n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          But note: we must initialize current and count? \n\n          We can do:\n\n              current = m   # we start with m copies\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:   # this condition is true initially, and we break inside when current>=n\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n                  if current >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n          Example: n=6, m=2: \n              current=2, count=0 -> enter loop:\n                  count=1, current=4 -> 4<6 -> continue? but we don't break -> then next iteration:\n                  count=2, current=6 -> break -> ans = 4+2=6.\n\n          Example: n=4, m=3: \n              current=3, count=0 -> enter loop:\n                  count=1, current=6 -> break -> ans = (4-3)+1=2.\n\n          This works.\n\n          But note: we are updating current and count. \n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              current = m\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  current += m\n                  if current >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n  However, we can avoid the variable current? \n\n          We know that after k clones, current = m*(k+1). \n\n          We can do:\n\n              count = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  count += 1\n                  if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                      break\n              ans += count\n\n  This avoids the current variable.\n\n  We'll choose the one without current for simplicity.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        count = 0\n        while m < n:\n            count += 1\n            if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                break\n        ans += count\n\n  But note: the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program. Only the part for the TODO.\n\n  The TODO is inside the while loop. We are replacing the entire while loop body? \n\n  We can write:\n\n        count = 0\n        while m < n:\n            count += 1\n            if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                break\n        ans += count\n\n  But note: the while loop condition is m<n, and we break inside. \n\n  However, the problem says: the while loop condition is (m<n). We are not changing the condition.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      For program1.py: \n          \"x, y = Y()\\n        O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\"\n\n      For program2.py: \n          \"count = 0\\n        while m < n:\\n            count += 1\\n            if m * (count+1) >= n:\\n                break\\n        ans += count\"\n\n  But note: the program2.py code has the while loop condition as (m<n). We are using the same condition.\n\n  However, the problem says: the TODO is inside the while loop. But we are replacing the entire while loop? \n\n  Actually, the given code has:\n\n        while(m<n):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        count = 0\n        while m < n:\n            count += 1\n            if m * (count+1) >= n:\n                break\n        ans += count\n\n  But wait: that would be nested while loops? \n\n  We must not do that. \n\n  We should replace the TODO with the body that we want to run inside the while loop? \n\n  But the intended logic is to break out of the while loop? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        # We are inside the while loop that runs while m<n. We want to break out after we count the clones? \n        # But we need to count the number of clones, which might be more than one? \n\n        # How about we do:\n\n        clones = 0\n        temp = m\n        while temp < n:\n            clones += 1\n            temp += m\n        ans += clones\n        break   # break the outer while loop\n\n  But note: the outer while loop condition is m<n. We break after we do this block? \n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Then the code for program2.py becomes:\n\n        while m < n:\n            clones = 0\n            temp = m\n            while temp < n:\n                clones += 1\n                temp += m\n            ans += clones\n            break\n\n  But this breaks after the first iteration of the outer while loop. \n\n  And the outer while loop condition is m<n, which is true, and then we break out of the outer while loop.\n\n  This is the same as not having the outer while loop? \n\n  Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n        clones = 0\n        temp = m\n        while temp < n:\n            clones += 1\n            temp += m\n        ans += clones\n\n  and then remove the outer while loop? \n\n  But the problem says: we must fill in the TODO inside the while loop. \n\n  We can do:\n\n        clones = 0\n        temp = m\n        while temp < n:\n            clones += 1\n            temp += m\n        ans += clones\n        break\n\n  This will break the outer while loop after we do the inner while loop.\n\n  But the inner while loop does the same as the formula.\n\n  However, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases is 10^5, so the inner while loop might be heavy? \n\n  But note: the inner while loop runs at most (n/m) times, and the sum of (n/m) over test cases might be large? \n\n  We can avoid the inner while loop by using the formula: clones = ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m-1)//m + 1? \n\n        clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1   if n>m, else 0\n\n  Then we do:\n\n        ans += clones\n\n  But then we break the outer while loop? \n\n  We can do:\n\n        clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1 \n        ans += clones\n        break\n\n  But note: if n==m, then clones = (0-1)//m+1 -> negative? \n\n  We only enter the outer while loop if m<n. Then n-m>0.\n\n        clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1 \n\n  Example: n=6, m=2: (6-2-1)//2+1 = (3)//2+1 = 1+1=2 -> correct.\n  Example: n=4, m=3: (4-3-1)//3+1 = (0)//3+1 = 0+1=1 -> correct.\n\n  But note: integer division in Python: (0)//3 is 0.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n        clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1 \n        ans += clones\n        break\n\n  This is efficient.\n\n  But the problem says: the TODO is inside the while loop. We are only doing one iteration? \n\n  We break after the first iteration. \n\n  This is acceptable because we only need to do this once.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1 \n        ans += clones\n        break\n\n  However, what if m==0? but m is at least 1.\n\n  So we output:\n\n      For program1.py: \n          \"x, y = Y()\\n        O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\"\n\n      For program2.py: \n          \"clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1\\n        ans += clones\\n        break\"\n\n  But note: the integer division in Python for nonnegative numbers is floor division. \n        (n-m-1) might be negative? but n>m so n-m-1>=0? \n        Example: n=2, m=1: n-m-1=0 -> 0//1+1=1 -> correct: clones=1.\n\n        Example: n=2, m=2: we don't enter the while loop.\n\n        But we are in the while loop only if m<n. And n-m-1>=0? \n          If n-m-1<0, then n-m-1 is negative? \n          Example: n=2, m=1: n-m-1=0 -> not negative.\n          Example: n=3, m=2: n-m-1=0 -> not negative.\n          Example: n=2, m=1: 0//1=0 -> 0+1=1.\n\n          But what if n-m-1 is negative? \n            n-m-1 < 0  => n-m < 1 => n-m<=0 -> but we are in the while loop only if m<n, so n-m>0, then n-m-1 can be 0 or positive? \n            Actually, if n-m==1, then n-m-1=0.\n            If n-m>=2, then n-m-1>=1.\n\n          So it's nonnegative.\n\n  Therefore, we can use floor division.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use: \n\n        clones = 0 if n <= m else (n - m - 1) // m + 1\n\n  But we are in the while loop only if n>m, so n<=m is not possible.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n        clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1\n\n  Then add to ans and break.\n\n  This is efficient.\n\n  We choose this.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n      program1: \"x, y = Y()\\n        O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\"\n      program2: \"clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1\\n        ans += clones\\n        break\"\n\n  But note: the program2.py code has the while loop. We break after the first iteration. \n\n  This is acceptable because we only need to do this calculation once.\n\n  Let's write in JSON.\n\n  Example output:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"x, y = Y()\\n        O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\", \"program2\": \"clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1\\n        ans += clones\\n        break\"}\n\n  But note: the program1.py code: the for loop is:\n\n        for _ in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        x, y = Y()\n        O.append(str(s[x]-s[x-y]))\n\n  And for program2.py:\n\n        while(m<n):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        clones = (n - m - 1) // m + 1\n        ans += clones\n        break\n\n  This will break out of the while loop after the first iteration.\n\n  We are done."
