In fact, if a0=2 and a1=2, then (0,0),(0,1) are white; (1,0),(1,1) are white. Then (0,2) is black, (1,2) is black, (2,0) is black (because a2=0), etc. So the example input in the note is not the same as the sample input provided in the problem statement. The problem says: \n      \"The first line of input contains one integer n (1<=n<=200000). The second line of input contains n+1 integers a0,a1,...,an\"\n\n  and the sample: \n       1\n       2 1\n\n  has n=1, and a0=2, a1=1. Therefore, the example note is for a different instance: probably a0=2, a1=2.

Now we have: (0,2), (1,1) [ two from op2 and one from op3 -> total two in (1,1) ], (2,0). Now we have to remove the two dolls at (1,1) (white) because a1=2, so (1,1) is white. Operation4: one doll at (1,1) -> (1,2) (black) and (2,1) (black). Now state: (0,2), (1,1)",

But the example note says 5 for the instance with a0=2, a1=2. For a0=2, a1=2: \n      i=0: j=0,1 -> C(0,0)=1, C(1,0)=1 -> 2.\n      i=1: j=0,1 -> C(1,1)=1, C(2,1)=2 -> 1+2=3. then ans = 2+3=5. So this yields 5 for the instance a0=2, a1=2. Therefore, the solution is: \n      ans = 0\n      for i in range(0, n+1):\n          if a[i] == 0: \n              break\n          for j in range(0, a[i]):\n              ans = ( ans + C(i+j, i) ) % mod\n\n  then output ans. For the sample \"1\\n2 1\": \n      i=0: j=0,1 -> C(0,0)=1, C(1,0)=1 -> 2.\n      i=1: a[1]=1 -> j=0 -> C(1+0,1)=C(1,1)=1. then ans = 2+1 = 3.\n\n  but the example input \"1\\n2 1\" is and the example output is 5 in the problem statement, but in the example note the instance is a0=2, a1=2.",

But the code has only the factorial array `f`. Since the problem's constraints are 200000, and we are doing 200000 iterations, and modular exponentiation with exponent 10**9+5 might be O(log(mod)) which is about 30 iterations, so 200000*30 = 6e6 -> acceptable in Python. Therefore, we can do. Let's test with the instance [2,2] (n=1) and index0:",

But note: we can also come from above? but we just argued that if we come from above (x-1, a_x) then (x-1, a_x) might be black? because a_{x-1}>=a_x, so a_x <= a_{x-1}, and then (x-1, a_x) is black? because a_x >= a_{x-1}? no: wait, the condition for (x-1, a_x) to be black is a_x >= a_{x-1}? but the sequence is non-increasing: a_{x-1}>=a_x. So a_x <= a_{x-1}. Therefore, (x-1, a_x) is white if a_x < a_{x-1}? because then a_x < a_{x-1} -> but the condition for whiteness is y < a_{x-1}. Here y = a_x, so if a_x < a_{x-1}, then (x-1, a_x) is white? and if a_x = a_{x-1}, then (x-1, a_x) is black. Therefore, if a_x = a_{x-1}, then we cannot pass through (x-1, a_x) because it is black and we would have stopped earlier. So we must avoid that cell. But the path to (x, a_x-1) must not go through any black cell. So the path to (x, a_x-1) must stay in the white region.

The ballot theorem: \n  If we have a boundary that is non-increasing, then the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay below the boundary (i.e., for every point (i,j) on the path, j <= a_i - 1) can be computed by:\n\n      f(x,y) = C(x+y, x) - sum_{i=0}^{x-1} C(x+y - i - a_i, x - i) * f(i, a_i)   ... ? But note: the known solution for this problem is to use a DP that iterates x from 0 to n, and uses a Fenwick tree or segment tree to accumulate the values. Alternatively, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n  Let dp[x] = the number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x) that are the first black cell at (x, a_x). But note: we argued that the first black cell must be (x, a_x) and the last move is a right move from (x, a_x-1).",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given:\n  n, q\n  list of n prices\n  q queries, each with x and y\n\nWe have to compute for each query: the maximum total value of items received for free.\n\nThe promotion: if a customer purchases at least x items, then the y cheapest of them are free.\n\nBut note: the customer can choose which items to purchase. So we want to maximize the free value, which is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase. However, note that the free items are the y cheapest, so to maximize the free value we want the y cheapest to be as large as possible. But also note that we are forced to purchase at least x items.\n\nHow to do it?\nWe can sort the prices in descending order. Then, consider that we are going to choose a set of x items. The free items will be the y smallest in that set. To maximize the free value, we want the y smallest in the set to be as large as possible.\n\nBut note: we can choose any set. So the best is to take the top (x) items? However, the free items are the y smallest in the set. So if we take the top x items, then the y smallest in that set are the last y of these top x. But is that the maximum?\n\nYes, because if we take a set that includes a small item, then that small item would be included in the free set and reduce the total free value. So the best is to take the top x items. Then the free value is the sum of the items from position (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted descending array? Actually, if we sort in descending order, then the top x are the largest. The y smallest in that set are the last y of the top x, which are the smallest in the set. But note: in descending order, the last y in the top x are the smallest. However, we have an array sorted in descending order: \n  [v0, v1, v2, ..., v_{x-1}]\nwhere v0>=v1>=...>=v_{x-1}. The y smallest are the last y: v_{x-y}, v_{x-y+1}, ..., v_{x-1}. But note: in the array sorted descending, the last y are the smallest. However, we want to sum them. But note: we have built a prefix sum array? \n\nLooking at the existing code:\n\n  prices.sort(reverse=True)\n  for i in range(1,arr[0]):   # arr[0] is n\n      prices[i] = prices[i] + prices[i-1]\n\nSo now prices[i] is the prefix sum from index0 to index i (inclusive) of the descending sorted array.\n\nNow for a query (x, y):\n  If x == y, then we are taking the top x items and the free set is the entire set, so the free value is the entire prefix sum of the top x, i.e., prices[x-1].\n\n  Otherwise, we note that the free value is the sum of the y smallest in the top x. In the descending sorted array, the top x are indices 0 to x-1. The y smallest in this set are the last y, which are indices (x-y) to (x-1). \n\nBut note: the prefix sum array we built is for the entire array. We have:\n  total of top x = prices[x-1]\n  total of top (x-y) = prices[x-y-1]   (if x-y-1>=0)\n\nThen the free value = total of top x - total of top (x-y) \n  = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\nBut what if x-y-1 is negative? Then we are subtracting nothing? Actually, if x-y==0, then we are taking the entire top x? But note: if x-y==0, then we are taking the top 0? which is 0. So then the free value = prices[x-1] - 0 = prices[x-1]. But that is the entire set? However, note that y=x? but we are in the else branch so x != y. So x-y>=1? Actually, the condition is y<=x, and we are in the else branch so x != y -> y < x. So x-y>=1. Therefore, x-y-1 is at least 0? Not exactly: if x-y=1, then x-y-1=0 -> valid. But what if x-y=0? that doesn't happen because y<=x and we are in else so y<x. So x-y>=1. Therefore, we can write:\n\n  free_value = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? Actually, since x>=y and y>=1, then x>=1. And x-y>=1, so x-y-1>=0? Actually, if x=1 and y=1, then we are in the if branch (x==y). So in the else branch, we have x>y. Then x-y>=1, so x-y-1>=0? Actually, if x=2, y=1: then x-y-1=0 -> valid. If x=1, y=0? but y>=1. So we are safe.\n\nBut note: our prefix sum array is built for indices 0 to n-1. What if x-y-1 is beyond the array? Actually, x<=n (because x<=n from the input). And we built the prefix sum for the entire array? But note: the loop for building the prefix sum is for i in range(1, arr[0]) -> arr[0] is n. So we built for indices 1 to n-1. So the array prices has n elements. The index x-1 must be in [0, n-1] because x<=n. Similarly, x-y-1 is in [0, n-1] because x-y>=1 -> x-y-1>=0 and x-y-1 <= x-1 <= n-1.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  ans.append(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n\nBut wait: let me test with the example.\n\nExample: \n  Input: \n    n=4, q=3\n    prices = [5, 2, 3, 1]   -> sort descending: [5,3,2,1]\n  Build prefix: \n      index0: 5\n      index1: 5+3=8\n      index2: 8+2=10\n      index3: 10+1=11\n  Query1: x=3, y=2 -> free value = prices[2] - prices[0] = 10 - 5 = 5? \n  But the example says: the two cheapest of the three items (which are 5,3,2) are 3 and 2 -> sum=5. Correct.\n\n  Query2: x=2, y=1 -> free value = prices[1] - prices[0] = 8-5=3? \n  But the example says: the cheapest of two items (5 and 5) is 5. But wait, in the example the prices were [5,5,3,1]? Actually, the example note says: \n      first query: items 5,3,5 -> so sorted descending: [5,5,3] -> then the two cheapest: 5 and 3 -> 8? \n      second query: two items 5 and 5 -> free 5.\n\n  But our input example in the note is different? The problem note says:\n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n      \"In the second query, a customer can buy two items worth 5 and 5, the cheapest of them is 5\"\n\n  So the array must be [5,3,5]? Then sorted descending: [5,5,3] -> prefix: \n      index0:5, index1:10, index2:13? \n      Then for (3,2): free = prices[2-1]? wait: x=3, y=2 -> free = prices[2] (which is the prefix for 3 items) minus prices[0] (which is the prefix for the first 3-2=1 item) -> 13-5=8 -> correct.\n      For (2,1): free = prices[1] - prices[0] = 10-5=5 -> correct.\n\n  But note: the example input in the note says the third query: \n      \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n  The third query: x=4, y=3? \n      Then free = prices[3] - prices[0] = 13 - 5 = 8? but expected 6.\n\n  What's the array? The note says: \"all the items\" -> [5,3,5]? but then the array has 3 items? Actually, the problem says: \"The store sells n items\", and the first input is n and q. The example note doesn't specify n and q, but the third query must be for n=4? because the example input in the problem says: \n      \"The first line contains two integers n and q (1<=n,q<=200000) \u2014 the number of items and the number of queries.\"\n      \"The second line contains n integers\"\n\n  The example note third query: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n  So the array must be [5,3,5,1]? Then sorted descending: [5,5,3,1] -> prefix: \n      index0:5, index1:10, index2:13, index3:14.\n      Query: x=4, y=3 -> free = prices[3] - prices[0] = 14-5=9 -> not 6.\n\n  What's the issue? The free set is the three cheapest in the set of four. The three cheapest are 1,3,5? but wait: the set of four is [5,5,3,1]. The three cheapest are 1,3, and one of the 5? no: the three smallest are 1,3, and then the next smallest is 3? but there is only one 3. Actually, the three smallest are 1,3, and then the next smallest is 5? So the free set is 1+3+5=9? but the example says 1+2+3=6.\n\n  This indicates that the example array is different. The note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\". So the array must be [1,2,3,4]? or [4,3,2,1]? \n\n  Let me assume the array is [4,3,2,1] (sorted descending: [4,3,2,1]). Then the three cheapest in the entire set are 1,2,3 -> sum=6. Then:\n      free = prices[3] - prices[0] = (4+3+2+1) - (4) = 10-4=6 -> correct.\n\n  How? \n      prices[3] = 4+3+2+1 = 10\n      prices[0] = 4   (which is the prefix for the first 4-3=1 item)\n\n  So the formula: free = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0) works.\n\n  But note: in the example [4,3,2,1] and (x=4,y=3): \n      x-y-1 = 4-3-1 = 0 -> so we subtract prices[0] (which is 4) from the total (10) to get 6.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in program1.py for the else branch is:\n\n        else:\n            # We need to subtract the prefix sum of the first (x-y) items from the prefix sum of the first x items.\n            # But note: our prefix array is 0-indexed: prices[i] = sum of items from index0 to index i.\n            # We want the sum of the last y in the top x: that is the entire top x minus the top (x-y).\n            # So free_value = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n            # However, if x-y==0, then we subtract nothing? but we are in else so x>y, so x-y>=1 -> x-y-1>=0.\n            # Therefore, we can write:\n            ans.append(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? We said it won't be because x>y. But what if x==0? but x>=y and y>=1 so x>=1. So we are safe.\n\n  However, note: our prefix array was built for indices 0 to n-1. But what if x-y-1 is negative? It cannot be because x-y>=1 -> x-y-1>=0. So we are safe.\n\n  But what if x-y-1 is beyond the array? Actually, x<=n, and we built the prefix for indices 0 to n-1. Since x-y-1 is at most x-1 (because y>=1) and x-1<=n-1, it is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        else:\n            ans.append(prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1])\n\nBut note: the example in the note for the third query: \n    n=4, and the array [1,2,3,4]? Actually, the example says the array is [1,2,3,4]? But the problem says the array is given as p1,...,pn. And we sort in descending order? So we get [4,3,2,1]. Then the prefix: \n        index0:4\n        index1:4+3=7\n        index2:7+2=9\n        index3:9+1=10\n    Then for (4,3): \n        free = prices[3] - prices[0] = 10-4=6 -> correct.\n\n  However, the example note says the array is [1,2,3,4]? but the input is the same as [4,3,2,1] when sorted descending? \n\n  So the code for program1.py is complete.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are given:\n  n\n  a0, a1, ..., an (and for i>n, a_i=0) and the sequence is non-increasing.\n\nWe have an infinite grid. The cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x, and black otherwise.\n\nWe start with one doll at (0,0). We can do an operation: remove a doll at (x,y) and place a doll at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y).\n\nGoal: make all white cells contain 0 dolls.\n\nWe are to compute the minimum number of operations modulo 10^9+7.\n\nHow to think?\n\nThe problem is non\u2010trivial. We note that the grid is defined by the sequence a. The white cells in row x are the columns from 0 to a_x-1.\n\nWe start with one doll at (0,0). We can break down the operations: each operation on (x,y) produces two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). We want to remove all dolls from white cells.\n\nNote: the operations can be done in any order and any doll can be chosen arbitrarily.\n\nWe note that the process is similar to a branching process. The initial doll at (0,0) must be moved out of the white cells? But note: (0,0) is white (since y=0 < a_0). So we must remove that doll. Similarly, we might have to remove dolls that land in white cells.\n\nHowever, note that the grid is infinite and the white cells are only the first a_x columns in row x. The black cells are safe? The goal is to have 0 dolls in white cells. Dolls in black cells are allowed.\n\nHow to remove a doll from a white cell? We can operate on it. But operating on a doll in a white cell produces two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). Now, (x,y+1) might be white or black? and (x+1,y) might be white or black.\n\nWe need to push the dolls to black cells? But note: the problem does not require black cells to be zero? only white cells. So we can have as many dolls as we want in black cells.\n\nTherefore, the goal is to move every doll that starts in a white cell to a black cell. However, note that the operations do not remove the doll until we operate on it. And when we operate, we break it into two. So we have to break the doll until all the pieces are in black cells.\n\nBut note: the operations can be done arbitrarily many times. However, we want the minimum number of operations.\n\nWe can model the entire process as a tree: the root is (0,0). Each operation on (x,y) produces two children: (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). The process stops when a doll lands in a black cell? Actually, we can stop operating on a doll once it is in a black cell. But note: we are allowed to leave dolls in black cells. So we only need to operate on dolls that are in white cells.\n\nTherefore, the total number of operations is the number of times we operate on a doll that is in a white cell. And note: we start with one doll at (0,0) (white) so we must operate at least once. Then we get two dolls: (0,1) and (1,0). If (0,1) is white? then we must operate on it? and similarly for (1,0). \n\nBut note: the sequence a is non-increasing. So a0>=a1>=a2>=...>=an>=0, and then zeros.\n\nThe condition for (x,y) to be white: y < a_x.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming? or combinatorial counting?\n\nNote: the operations are independent for each path? Actually, the entire process is a tree. The initial doll at (0,0) must be operated on. Then each of the two resulting dolls must be operated on if they are in white cells, and so on.\n\nThe total number of operations is the total number of nodes in the tree that are white? Because we operate exactly once on each white cell that ever has a doll. But note: a white cell might be visited multiple times? The problem says: multiple dolls can be present at a cell. So we have to count the number of times a doll is present in a white cell and then operated on.\n\nBut note: we can choose the order arbitrarily. We can delay operations arbitrarily. However, the minimal number of operations is the total number of white cells that are ever occupied by a doll? But wait: each operation produces two new dolls. And we start with one. The total number of dolls at the end is the number of leaves (if we stop when a doll is black). But we are not forced to stop: we can operate on a black cell? but we don't have to. So we can stop as soon as a doll is in a black cell.\n\nTherefore, the entire process is a tree that branches until every leaf is in a black cell. The number of operations is the number of internal nodes (each operation breaks one node into two, so the number of operations is the number of nodes that are broken, which is the total number of nodes minus the initial node? Actually, the initial node is broken, and then each broken node produces two children. The total number of nodes in the tree is 1 + 2*(number of operations). But also, the leaves are the dolls that end in black cells. So:\n\n  Let T = total number of nodes (which is the initial node plus the two from each operation) = 1 + 2 * (number of operations)\n  But also, T = 1 + (number of operations) [the internal nodes] + (number of leaves) \n  => 1 + 2 * (number of operations) = 1 + (number of operations) + (number of leaves)\n  => number of operations = number of leaves - 1.\n\nBut we start with one leaf? (the initial doll) but it is white so we break it. Then we get two leaves. Then we break the white ones. So the leaves at the end are the dolls that are in black cells. Therefore, the number of operations is (number of leaves) - 1.\n\nBut note: the initial node is broken, so it becomes an internal node. Then we have two leaves. Then if we break one of them, we get two new leaves and that leaf becomes internal. So the number of leaves increases by one for each operation.\n\nTherefore, the number of operations is (number of leaves at the end) - 1.\n\nBut what is the number of leaves at the end? Each leaf is a doll that is in a black cell. And we break every white cell until all are black. So the leaves are the dolls that end up in black cells.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the dolls to be distinct: multiple dolls can be at the same cell.\n\nHow to count the leaves? Each leaf is a path from (0,0) to a black cell? But note: the operations are deterministic: from (x,y) we go to (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). So each doll's journey is a path: a sequence of moves: either right (increasing y) or down (increasing x). And the path ends when it first hits a black cell? Actually, we can stop as soon as we hit a black cell. But note: we might have multiple paths that end at the same black cell? and we count the number of dolls that end at that black cell.\n\nBut note: the entire process is a tree. The leaves are the paths that go from (0,0) to a black cell without having any intermediate black cell? Actually, we stop at the first black cell we hit? But the problem does not specify that we stop at the first black cell. However, we can choose to stop as soon as a doll is in a black cell. So we do not break that doll. Therefore, each leaf corresponds to a path from (0,0) to a black cell that does not pass through any black cell earlier? Actually, we can stop at the first black cell encountered.\n\nTherefore, the leaf is the first black cell encountered along the path.\n\nBut note: the grid is defined: a cell (x,y) is black if y>=a_x. So the first time we have y>=a_x, we stop.\n\nBut note: we can also stop at a cell that is black even if we could have stopped earlier? but we don't have to. The minimal operations would require that we stop at the first black cell.\n\nTherefore, the leaf is uniquely determined by the path until the first black cell.\n\nBut note: the path is a sequence of moves: right (R) and down (D). The path from (0,0) to (x,y) has x downs and y rights? and the order is arbitrary. The condition for the path to stop at (x,y) is that (x,y) is the first black cell along the path. That means:\n\n  For all positions (x',y') along the path (with x'<=x, y'<=y, and (x',y') != (x,y)), the cell (x',y') is white? i.e., y' < a_{x'}.\n\nBut note: the path is a lattice path. The condition for the entire path is that every intermediate cell (x',y') must be white, and (x,y) is black.\n\nHow to count the number of paths that end at a particular black cell (x,y) as the first black cell? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the following:\n\n  The number of leaves is the number of paths from (0,0) to a black cell that do not contain any black cell as an intermediate.\n\nThis is similar to the ballot problem or the problem of counting paths that stay in a region.\n\nBut note: the grid is defined by the non-increasing sequence a. The condition for a cell (x,y) to be white is y < a_x. And the sequence a is non-increasing.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming? But note: n up to 200000, and a_i up to 200000.\n\nAlternatively, we can use generating functions or combinatorial identities.\n\nBut note: the problem is known and there is a known combinatorial solution.\n\nKnown similar problem: \"D. Jina in the Grid\" from a contest.\n\nSolution idea:\n\n  The answer is the sum over all black cells that are the first black cell in their path of the number of paths from (0,0) to that black cell that stay in the white region until the end.\n\nBut note: the entire path must be in white until the last step. The last step is black.\n\nHowever, we can also note: the minimal operations is (number of leaves) - 1. And the number of leaves is the number of such paths.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require distinct black cells: multiple paths can end at the same black cell? and we count each path as a leaf.\n\nTherefore, the total number of leaves is the sum over all black cells (x,y) of the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay in the white region (i.e., all intermediate cells are white) and the cell (x,y) is black.\n\nBut note: the condition for (x,y) to be black is y>=a_x. And the condition for the path to stay in white until (x,y) is that for every intermediate cell (x',y') (which is not (x,y)) we have y' < a_{x'}.\n\nBut note: the path is defined by the sequence of moves. The number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) is C(x+y, x). However, we have the restriction that the path never leaves the white region? Actually, the white region is defined by the sequence a: in row x, we can only be in columns [0, a_x-1]. But note: the path must stay in the white region until the last step. The last step is (x,y) which is black. So the path must be entirely in the white region for the prefix [from (0,0) to (x,y-1) if the last move is right, or to (x-1,y) if the last move is down]? Actually, the entire path except the last cell must be white.\n\nBut note: the last cell is (x,y). The step before the last could be (x-1,y) (if the last move is down) or (x,y-1) (if the last move is right). And we require that the entire path until the last step is white. So the last step is the only black cell.\n\nTherefore, the condition is:\n\n  The path from (0,0) to (x,y) must satisfy:\n      For every point (x',y') on the path that is not the last, we have y' < a_{x'}.\n\n  And we require that (x,y) is black: y>=a_x.\n\nBut note: the last step: if we arrive at (x,y) by a right move from (x,y-1), then we require that (x,y-1) is white? and (x,y) is black. Similarly, if we arrive by a down move from (x-1,y), then we require (x-1,y) is white? and (x,y) is black.\n\nBut note: the condition for (x,y) to be black is y>=a_x. And the condition for (x,y-1) to be white is y-1 < a_x -> y <= a_x. Similarly, for (x-1,y): we require y < a_{x-1}. But note: the sequence a is non-increasing, so a_{x-1}>=a_x. Therefore, if y>=a_x, then we have y < a_{x-1}? not necessarily: if a_{x-1}=a_x, then y>=a_x implies y>=a_{x-1} -> so (x-1,y) is black? which would break the condition.\n\nTherefore, the last move must be a right move? because if we come from (x-1,y) and y>=a_{x-1}? then (x-1,y) is black and we would have stopped earlier. So the only possibility to have (x,y) as the first black cell is to come from the left: (x,y-1). And we require that (x,y-1) is white: y-1 < a_x -> y <= a_x. But we also require (x,y) is black: y>=a_x. Therefore, we must have y = a_x.\n\nSo the only black cells that can be the first black cell are those with y = a_x. And the last move must be a right move.\n\nTherefore, the first black cell must be of the form (x, a_x) for some x. And the path must be entirely in the white region until the last step. The last step is a right move from (x, a_x-1) to (x, a_x).\n\nNow, what about the rest of the path? The path from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) must be entirely in the white region. And then we take a right move to (x, a_x) which is black.\n\nBut note: we can also come from above? but we just argued that if we come from above (x-1, a_x) then (x-1, a_x) might be black? because a_{x-1}>=a_x, so a_x <= a_{x-1}, and then (x-1, a_x) is black? because a_x >= a_{x-1}? no: wait, the condition for (x-1, a_x) to be black is a_x >= a_{x-1}? but the sequence is non-increasing: a_{x-1}>=a_x. So a_x <= a_{x-1}. Therefore, (x-1, a_x) is white if a_x < a_{x-1}? because then a_x < a_{x-1} -> but the condition for whiteness is y < a_{x-1}. Here y = a_x, so if a_x < a_{x-1}, then (x-1, a_x) is white? and if a_x = a_{x-1}, then (x-1, a_x) is black.\n\nTherefore, if a_x = a_{x-1}, then we cannot pass through (x-1, a_x) because it is black and we would have stopped earlier. So we must avoid that cell. But the path to (x, a_x-1) must not go through any black cell. So the path to (x, a_x-1) must stay in the white region.\n\nBut note: the path to (x, a_x-1) must also avoid the cell (x-1, a_x) if a_x = a_{x-1}? Actually, we don't have to avoid it if we don't use it. But if we use it, we would stop there. So we cannot use any black cell as an intermediate. Therefore, the path to (x, a_x-1) must avoid all black cells. But the black cells in row x' are the columns y'>=a_{x'}. So the condition for the path to (x, a_x-1) is that it never goes to a cell (x',y') with y'>=a_{x'}.\n\nThis is a classical problem: the number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) that stay below the boundary defined by the sequence a. The boundary is: in row i, we cannot go to column a_i or above.\n\nAnd the sequence a is non-increasing. This is the key.\n\nWe can use the ballot theorem for non-increasing boundaries.\n\nThe ballot theorem: \n  If we have a boundary that is non-increasing, then the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) that stay below the boundary (i.e., for every point (i,j) on the path, j <= a_i - 1) can be computed by:\n\n      f(x,y) = C(x+y, x) - sum_{i=0}^{x-1} C(x+y - i - a_i, x - i) * f(i, a_i)   ... ?\n\nBut note: the known solution for this problem is to use a DP that iterates x from 0 to n, and uses a Fenwick tree or segment tree to accumulate the values.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n  Let dp[x] = the number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x) that are the first black cell at (x, a_x). But note: we argued that the first black cell must be (x, a_x) and the last move is a right move from (x, a_x-1). Therefore, the number of such paths is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) that stay in the white region.\n\n  So dp[x] = number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) that never go above the boundary defined by the sequence a (i.e., in row i, we must have y < a_i).\n\n  How to compute dp[x]? \n\n  We can use the reflection principle? or the generating function.\n\n  But note: the sequence a is non-increasing. This is similar to the problem of counting paths below a non-increasing staircase.\n\n  We can use the following recurrence:\n\n      dp[0] = 1 if a_0>0? because we go from (0,0) to (0, a_0-1): but wait, if a_0>0, then we can have a path that goes right a_0-1 times? but we cannot go beyond a_0-1. So the path for x=0: we are at row0, and we go from (0,0) to (0, a_0-1) by moving right a_0-1 times. There is only one path. But if a_0==0, then we cannot have a path to (0,-1) -> so dp[0]=0.\n\n      Then for x>=1, we want to go to (x, a_x-1). The total number of paths without any restriction is C(x + a_x - 1, x). But we must subtract the paths that touch the boundary at some row i<=x.\n\n  We can use the reflection-like recurrence:\n\n      dp[x] = C(x + a_x - 1, x) - sum_{i=0}^{x-1} dp[i] * C( (x - i) + (a_x - a_i) - 1, x - i )\n\n  Why? The idea: subtract the paths that touch the boundary for the first time at row i. Then from (0,0) to (i, a_i) (which is the first black cell? but wait, we are counting paths that stay in white until (x, a_x-1), so if they touch the boundary at row i (i.e., go to a cell (i, a_i) which is black) then we break the condition. But note: we are not allowing any black cell, so we must avoid any cell (i,j) with j>=a_i. Therefore, if a path from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) goes above the boundary at row i (meaning it hits the boundary at row i), then we can reflect the path.\n\n  However, the standard reflection for a fixed boundary is known. But here the boundary changes per row.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following recurrence from known problems (like \"Monotonic Renumeration\" or \"Paths in a rectangle with obstacles\"):\n\n      dp[x] = number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) that stay below the boundary.\n\n      We can use:\n\n          dp[x] = binom(x + a_x - 1, x) - sum_{i=0}^{x-1} binom( (x-i) + (a_x - a_i - 1), x-i ) * dp[i]\n\n  But why subtract dp[i] * binom(...)? \n\n  Explanation: \n      The total paths: binom(x + a_x - 1, x) = C(x + a_x - 1, x).\n\n      Now, subtract the paths that touch the boundary at some row i. The first time they touch the boundary is at row i. Then we can split the path: \n          (0,0) to (i, a_i) [but staying below the boundary until the last step at i] -> which is exactly the definition of dp[i]? but note: dp[i] is defined for the first black cell at (i, a_i) and the path to (i, a_i-1) is the one that stays below. However, we are now going to (x, a_x-1) and we are considering the first violation at row i, meaning the first time the path hits the boundary at row i: which is the cell (i, a_i) -> but wait, we are counting paths that stay below the boundary (so they never hit a black cell) until the end. So we don't want any hit at a black cell. Therefore, the paths that hit the boundary at row i are those that at row i reach the column a_i (which is the boundary) and then we can reflect the rest of the path.\n\n  Actually, we can use the generating function and the inclusion-exclusion.\n\n  Known result: \n      Let F(x) = dp[x] = number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) that never go above the boundary.\n\n      Then: \n          F(x) = C(x + a_x - 1, x) - sum_{i=0}^{x-1} F(i) * C( (x-i) + (a_x - a_i - 1), x-i )\n\n  Why? \n      Consider a path that goes from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) and that touches the boundary at row i for the first time. Then we can split the path at the first time it hits the boundary: at row i, it hits the column a_i. But note: the boundary at row i is a_i, so the first time it hits the boundary is at (i, a_i). However, we are counting paths that stay below the boundary, so they never hit (i, a_i). Therefore, we must avoid any path that hits the boundary at any row.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n      The number of paths from (0,0) to (x, a_x-1) that avoid the boundary is:\n\n          F(x) = C(x + a_x - 1, x) - sum_{i=0}^{x-1} F(i) * C( (x-i) + (a_x - a_i), x-i )\n\n  But wait, if we consider the first time the path hits the boundary at row i, then we can reflect the part of the path from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1) by a horizontal reflection above the boundary? \n\n  Actually, the reflection principle for a non-increasing boundary is more complex.\n\n  There is a known solution for this problem: \n\n      dp[0] = 1 if a_0>0, else 0.\n      For x from 1 to n:\n          dp[x] = ( C(x + a_x - 1, x) - sum_{i=0}^{x-1} dp[i] * C( (x - i) + (a_x - a_i - 1), x - i ) ) % mod\n\n  But note: the term C( (x-i) + (a_x - a_i - 1), x-i ) is the number of paths from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1) without any restriction? But we have to account for the shift: after hitting (i, a_i), the path goes from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1). The number of such paths is C( (x-i) + (a_x-1 - a_i), x-i). But note: the move from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1) requires (x-i) right moves and (a_x-1 - a_i) down moves? no: we are going from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1): \n      We need to move (x-i) steps to the right and (a_x-1 - a_i) steps down? but wait, we are going from row i to row x: that's (x-i) downs? and from column a_i to column a_x-1: that's (a_x-1 - a_i) rights? \n\n  Actually, the moves: \n      We need to go from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1): \n          Down moves: x - i\n          Right moves: (a_x-1) - a_i   [if a_x-1 >= a_i, otherwise it's negative -> then no path]\n\n  But note: the sequence a is non-increasing: a_i >= a_{i+1} >= ... >= a_x. So a_i >= a_x. Therefore, a_x-1 - a_i is negative? unless a_i <= a_x-1. But a_i>=a_x, so a_i<=a_x-1 only if a_i = a_x and a_x>=1? then a_x-1 = a_i-1. So the number of rights is negative? \n\n  This indicates that the formula might be different.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the following: \n\n      The number of paths from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1) is C( (x-i) + (a_x-1 - a_i), x-i ) only if a_x-1 >= a_i? but if a_x-1 < a_i, then it's 0.\n\n  But note: a_i>=a_x, so a_x-1 < a_i is always true? unless a_x-1>=a_i -> which requires a_i<=a_x-1. But a_i>=a_x, so we require a_i<=a_x-1 -> a_x-1>=a_i>=a_x -> then a_i = a_x. Then the number of rights is a_x-1 - a_i = -1 -> which is negative -> 0.\n\n  Therefore, the term is 0 for all i such that a_i != a_x? and if a_i = a_x, then the number of rights is -1 -> 0. So the sum is always 0? \n\n  That cannot be.\n\n  We must have made a mistake in the direction.\n\n  Actually, from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1): \n      We need to move from row i to row x: that's (x-i) downs.\n      We need to move from column a_i to column a_x-1: that's (a_x-1 - a_i) which is negative? so we cannot move to the left? \n\n  The moves are only right and down. We cannot move left. Therefore, if a_x-1 < a_i, then there is no path. So the term is 0.\n\n  But then the recurrence becomes:\n\n      dp[x] = C(x + a_x - 1, x)   [because the sum is 0]\n\n  But that is not correct.\n\n  We must account for the fact that the path might have hit the boundary at an earlier row i even if we cannot go from (i, a_i) to (x, a_x-1) in a direct way? \n\n  The reflection principle for lattice paths with a boundary is usually done by reflecting over a horizontal line. But here the boundary is different per row.\n\n  Known solution in code from a contest:\n\n      n = int(input())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      mod = 10**9+7\n\n      # Precomputation of factorials and inverse factorials up to N (which is at least 500000? because x+y can be up to 400000? but we have a_i up to 200000, and x up to 200000, so x+a_x-1 <= 200000+200000 = 400000)\n      maxN = 500000\n      fact = [1]*(maxN+1)\n      invf = [1]*(maxN+1)\n      for i in range(1, maxN+1):\n          fact[i] = fact[i-1]*i % mod\n      invf[maxN] = pow(fact[maxN], mod-2, mod)\n      for i in range(maxN,0,-1):\n          invf[i-1] = invf[i]*i % mod\n\n      def C(n, r):\n          if r<0 or r>n: return 0\n          return fact[n] * invf[r] % mod * invf[n-r] % mod\n\n      dp = [0]*(n+1)\n      # We'll do for x from 0 to n: but note a has n+1 elements: a0, a1, ..., an.\n      # For x=0:\n      if a[0] > 0:\n          dp[0] = 1\n      else:\n          dp[0] = 0\n\n      # We'll use a Fenwick tree or segment tree for the summation? but note the recurrence:\n      #   dp[x] = C(x + a[x] - 1, x) - sum_{i=0}^{x-1} dp[i] * C( (x-i) + (a[x] - a[i]) - 1, x-i )\n      # But note: the term C( (x-i) + (a[x] - a[i]) - 1, x-i ) is nonzero only if (x-i) + (a[x]-a[i]) - 1 >= x-i and a[x]>=a[i]? \n      # But a is non-increasing: a[i] >= a[x] for i<=x.

But 200000*2=400000, so 531441 is enough.\n\n  Then they iterate over the list of n+1 integers (the a_i's). \n\n  We are to complete the TODO.\n\n  The known recurrence:\n\n      dp[i] = C(i+a[i], i) - sum_{j=0}^{i-1} [ if a[j] < a[i], then dp[j] * C( (i-j) + (a[i]-a[j]-1), i-j ) ]\n\n  And the answer is dp[n] (because the input has n+1 elements, and the last is a_n).\n\n  But note: the example: \n      Input: \n          n=1\n          a = [2, 1]   (since n=1, then a0, a1)\n\n      Then:\n          i=0: \n             dp[0] = C(0+2,0) - 0 = C(2,0)=1.\n          i=1:\n             dp[1] = C(1+1,1) - [ for j=0: a[0]=2>=a[1]=1 -> skip] = C(2,1)=2.\n\n      Then the answer is dp[1]=2.\n\n  But the example in the problem says the answer is 5.\n\n  This indicates that the answer is not dp[n]. \n\n  Let me read the problem again: \n      \"Print one integer \u2014 the answer to the problem, modulo 10^9+7.\"\n\n      The example: \n          Input: \n              1\n              2 1\n          Output: \n              5\n\n  So our recurrence might be different.\n\n  After re-thinking: \n\n      The number of leaves is the sum over i of the number of paths that have their first black cell at (i, a_i). But wait, we argued that the first black cell must be (i, a_i) for some i. Therefore, the total number of leaves is sum_{i} dp[i].\n\n      Then the number of operations = (number of leaves) - 1 = (sum_{i} dp[i]) - 1.\n\n  Therefore, in the example: \n      i=0: dp[0]=1\n      i=1: dp[1]=2\n      total leaves = 1+2 = 3, then operations = 3-1 = 2, but expected 5.\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  Alternatively, the number of operations is the number of internal nodes, which is the total number of nodes - 1 - (number of leaves). But the total number of nodes = 1 + 2 * (number of operations). And also = (number of leaves) + (number of internal nodes). \n      Let I = number of internal nodes, L = number of leaves.\n      Then: I + L = 1 + 2*I   => L = I+1.\n      So I = L-1.\n\n  Therefore, the number of operations is I = L-1.\n\n  But then in the example, L=3, then operations=2, but expected 5.\n\n  This indicates that our combinatorial model is not matching.\n\n  Let me simulate the example manually:\n\n      a0=2, a1=1, and for i>1, a_i=0.\n\n      White cells: \n          row0: y<2 -> y=0,1\n          row1: y<1 -> y=0\n          row2 and beyond: y<0 -> none.\n\n      We start with (0,0). We must operate on it. Then we get (0,1) and (1,0).\n\n      Now, (0,1): white? yes, because y=1<2. (1,0): white? yes, because y=0<1.\n\n      Then we operate on (0,1): remove it, and put (0,2) and (1,1). \n          (0,2): black? because y=2>=a0=2 -> black.\n          (1,1): black? because y=1>=a1=1 -> black.\n      Then we operate on (1,0): remove it, and put (1,1) and (2,0).\n          (1,1): black -> leave it.\n          (2,0): black? because a2=0, so y=0>=0 -> black.\n\n      Now we have: (0,2), (1,1) [two], (2,0). \n\n      But the white cells: \n          (0,0): gone, (0,1): gone, (1,0): gone.\n          (0,2): black -> allowed.\n          (1,1): black -> allowed.\n          (2,0): black -> allowed.\n\n      So after 2 operations on (0,0) and then on (0,1) and then on (1,0) -> total 3 operations? \n\n      But the example says 5.\n\n  Let me read the example note: \n      \"One of the optimal sequence of operations is as follows:\n          Do the operation with (0,0). Now the state of the grid is (1,0,1),(0,1,1).\n          Do the operation with (0,1). Now the state of the grid is (1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,2,1).\n          Do the operation with (1,0). Now the state of the grid is (1,1,2),(0,2,1),(2,0,1).\n          Do the operation with (1,1). Now the state of the grid is (1,1,1),(0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,1),(2,1,1).\n          Do the operation with (1,1). Now the state of the grid is (0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,2).\"\n\n      So they did 5 operations.\n\n  In our simulation, we did 3 operations. Why the discrepancy?\n\n  The issue: in the example, they did not stop at the first black cell. They allow multiple dolls in a cell, and they might need to operate on a black cell? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Your goal is to make all white cells contain 0 dolls.\"\n\n  The example grid: \n      white cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) -> because a0=2, a1=1, so (0,0),(0,1) are white; (1,0) is white; (1,1) is black? -> no, (1,1) is black because 1>=a1=1. \n\n  In the example, after the first operation on (0,0), we have (0,1) and (1,0) -> both white.\n\n  Then they operate on (0,1) -> produces (0,2) (black) and (1,1) (black).\n\n  Then they operate on (1,0) -> produces (1,1) (black) and (2,0) (black).\n\n  Now, the white cells: (0,0) is gone, (0,1) is gone, (1,0) is gone. But (0,0) is gone, (0,1) is gone, (1,0) is gone. So why are they not done? \n\n  The example then does two more operations on (1,1) (which is black). \n\n  Why do they operate on (1,1)? Because the goal is to have 0 dolls in white cells, and they can have any number in black cells. So operating on a black cell is allowed, but not required. \n\n  However, the example does it to achieve the goal with 5 operations. But our simulation achieved in 3. \n\n  The catch: the example's initial grid has a0=2, a1=1. In the example note, the grid has more white cells? \n\n  The example note says: \"cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\" -> wait, (1,1) is white? \n\n  But the problem says: the cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x.\n      (1,1): a1=1, so y=1 < 1 -> false, so (1,1) is black.\n\n  So the example note says: \"cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\" -> this is not consistent with a0=2, a1=1. \n\n  In fact, the example note has a0=2, a1=2? because then (1,1) would be white.\n\n  The example input is: \n       1\n       2 1\n\n  so a0=2, a1=1. Therefore, the white cells are:\n        (0,0), (0,1) -> because for row0: y<2 -> y=0,1.\n        (1,0) -> for row1: y<1 -> y=0.\n\n  So (1,1) is black.\n\n  Therefore, after three operations, we have no dolls in white cells. So the answer should be 3.\n\n  But the example note says the answer is 5 for the first example, and the first example input is:\n       1\n       2 1\n\n  output: 5.\n\n  This is a contradiction.\n\n  After re-read of the example note: \n      \"In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\"\n\n  This implies a0>=2 and a1>=2. In fact, if a0=2 and a1=2, then (0,0),(0,1) are white; (1,0),(1,1) are white. Then (0,2) is black, (1,2) is black, (2,0) is black (because a2=0), etc.\n\n  So the example input in the note is not the same as the sample input provided in the problem statement. \n\n  The problem says: \n      \"The first line of input contains one integer n (1<=n<=200000). The second line of input contains n+1 integers a0,a1,...,an\"\n\n  and the sample: \n       1\n       2 1\n\n  has n=1, and a0=2, a1=1.\n\n  Therefore, the example note is for a different instance: probably a0=2, a1=2.\n\n  So let's assume the instance in the example note is: \n        n=1\n        a0=2, a1=2\n\n  then we simulate:\n\n      We start with (0,0) (white). \n      Operation1: (0,0) -> (0,1) and (1,0) [ both white ].\n      Operation2: (0,1) -> (0,2) (black) and (1,1) (white).\n      Operation3: (1,0) -> (1,1) (white) and (2,0) (black).\n      Now we have: (0,2), (1,1) [ two from op2 and one from op3 -> total two in (1,1) ], (2,0).\n      Now we have to remove the two dolls at (1,1) (white) because a1=2, so (1,1) is white.\n      Operation4: one doll at (1,1) -> (1,2) (black) and (2,1) (black). Now state: (0,2), (1,1) [ one left ], (2,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n      Operation5: the last (1,1) -> (1,2) and (2,1). Then state: (0,2), (2,0), (1,2) [ two], (2,1) [ two].\n\n      Now no dolls in white cells.\n\n      So 5 operations.\n\n Therefore, the instance in the sample input \"1\\n2 1\" is not the instance of the example note. The example note is for a0=2, a1=2.\n\n So the sample input in the problem statement might be:\n\n      Input: \n          1\n          2 2\n\n      Output: \n          5\n\n  But the problem says: \n        Input: \n            1\n            2 1\n\n        Output: \n            5\n\n  -> This is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n  Or, the example note is for the instance a0=2, a1=1, and they consider (1,1) to be white? which would be if a1=2. \n\n  Given the confusion, and that the known solution in C++ for the instance \"1\\n2 1\" outputs 2 (which we got) but the example note says 5, we must use the combinatorial solution that matches the example note for the instance a0=2, a1=2.\n\n  For the instance a0=2, a1=2, n=1:\n\n      dp[0] = C(0+2,0) = C(2,0)=1.\n      dp[1] = C(1+2,1) - dp[0] * C( (1-0) + (2-2-1), 1-0 ) = C(3,1) - 1 * C(1 + (0-1), 1) = 3 - C(0,1) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n      Then the total number of leaves = dp[0] + dp[1] = 1+3 = 4.\n      Then the number of operations = leaves - 1 = 3, but expected 5.\n\n  This indicates that the combinatorial model is not simply the leaves of the tree.\n\n  We must count the number of times we operate on a doll, which is the number of internal nodes. And the number of internal nodes = number of operations = total nodes - leaves - 1? \n      total nodes = 1 + 2 * (number of operations)\n      internal nodes = number of operations\n      leaves = internal nodes + 1 = number of operations + 1\n\n      Therefore, number of operations = leaves - 1.\n\n  So with leaves=4, operations=3, but we need 5.\n\n  Alternatively, the tree might not be a binary tree? \n\n  Each operation takes one doll and produces two. So the tree is binary. The number of leaves is the number of dolls in black cells at the end. The number of internal nodes is the number of operations.\n\n  So the only possibility is that the number of leaves is 6 for the instance a0=2, a1=2? then operations=5.\n\n  How to get 6 leaves for a0=2, a1=2? \n\n  We simulate the example note's operations and count the leaves at the end: \n      After 5 operations, we have: \n          (0,2), (2,0), (1,2) [ two], (2,1) [ two] -> total 1+1+2+2 = 6.\n\n  Therefore, the number of leaves is 6.\n\n  So the combinatorial model: the number of leaves is the number of dolls in black cells at the end, and it is the sum over all black cells of the number of ways the doll can be there at the end.\n\n  But note: a doll in a black cell may appear from multiple paths. \n\n  In the example, the \n      (0,2): 1 doll\n      (2,0): 1 doll\n      (1,2): 2 dolls\n      (2,1): 2 dolls\n      total 6.\n\n  Therefore, the number of leaves = 6.\n\n  So the number of operations = 6 - 1 = 5.\n\n  Therefore, the combinatorial solution is: \n      leaves = sum_{i=0}^{n} dp[i]   // the number of first black cell at (i,a_i) is dp[i], but note: a cell (i,a_i) might be reached by dp[i] paths, but then we may have multiple dolls at the same cell? and in the example, we have multiple.\n\n  wait, in the example, the cell (1,2) has 2 dolls. Our dp[?] for (1,2) is not defined because (1,2) is not of the form (i, a_i) ( since a1=2, so (1,2) is not a first black cell; the first black cell for a1 is (1,2) only if a1=3?).\n\n  This indicates that the first black cell must be (i, a_i) for some i, and then the doll that first becomes black at (i, a_i) is counted in dp[i]. However, after that, we may operate on other dolls that are in while cells, and that may yield more dolls in black cells, and also yield duplicate in the same black cell.\n\n  Therefore, the model of the tree is not captured solely by the first black cell. \n\n  Given the complexity and the time, and that the intended solution for the contest is to use the generating function and the leave as the sum over i of dp[i] and then operations = (sum over i of dp[i]) - 1, and that the sample \"1\\n2 1\" should yield 2 (which is 3-1=2) but the problem says 5 for the example, we must abandon.\n\n  We note that the known solution for this problem in the contest is to output dp[n] ( for the last a_n) or something else.\n\n  In the known solution in C++ (efficient) that we found online for the problem \"D.

They have x and d.\n\n  What could x be? x might be the index.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      for index, z in enumerate(list of integers): \n          x = index   (0-indexed)\n          then do something with x and z.\n\n  then d = the answer.\n\n  In the example, for the first z=2 (x=0), and then z=1 (x=1).\n\n  We know that the answer for instance [2,1] is 5.\n\n  How to get 5 from [2,1]? \n\n  We note that the example simulation for [2,1] (which should be 3) is not 5, but the example note is for [2,2] and yields 5.\n\n  So for [2,2] (n=1, a0=2, a1=2), the answer is 5.\n\n  So let's assume the TODO is for the instance [2,2] to yield 5.\n\n  What to do for each z in [2,2] (x=0 and x=1) to update d to 5.\n\n  We have factorials precom up to 531441.\n\n  We might do:\n\n      d = ( d + something ) % m\n\n  with something involving x and z.\n\n  We try to compute for x=0, z=2: \n      something = C(0+2,0) = 1.\n  for x=1, z=2: \n      something = C(1+2,1) = 3.\n  then d = 1+3 = 4, then 4-1=3 for operations? not 5.\n\n  or maybe we are not summing dp[i] but something else.\n\n  We might be computing the total number of operations as the sum of something else.\n\n  Given the complexity and the time, and that the problem is very hard, and that the provided code in program2.py is short, we output a known solution that passed in online judges for this problem.\n\n  Known solution in Python for the problem ( from a passed submission ):\n\n      import sys\n      input = sys.stdin.readline\n      n = int(input())\n      a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      mod = 10**9+7\n\n      max_val = 500000\n      fact = [1] * (max_val+1)\n      for i in range(1, max_val+1):\n          fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod\n\n      inv_fact = [1] * (max_val+1)\n      inv_fact[max_val] = pow(fact[max_val], mod-2, mod)\n      for i in range(max_val,0,-1):\n          inv_fact[i-1] = inv_fact[i] * i % mod\n\n      def C(n, r):\n          if not 0<=r<=n: return 0\n          return fact[n] * inv_fact[r] % mod * inv_fact[n-r] % mod\n\n      # dp = [0] * (n+1)\n      # We'll use a Fenwick tree to do the summation over j with a[j] < a[i]\n      # But note: the recurrence: \n      #   dp[i] = C(i+a[i], i) - \n      #            sum_{j<i} [ if a[j] < a[i], then dp[j] * C( (i-j) + (a[i]-a[j]-1), i-j ) ]\n      # and then the answer is (sum_{i} dp[i] - 1) % mod   [ because operations = leaves - 1 ]\n\n      # However, for the instance [2,2] (n=1, a=[2,2]):\n      #   i=0: dp[0] = C(0+2,0)=1.\n      #   i=1: dp[1] = C(1+2,1) - [ for j<1: j=0, a[0]=2< a[1]=2 -> no, a[0] is not < a[1] (2<2 is false), so 0 ] = 3.\n      #   leaves = 1+3 = 4, operations = 4-1 = 3, not 5.\n\n      # So this is not.\n\n  Another known solution ( from a passed submission for the problem \"D.

Then for index=1, a[1] up to 200000, then 200000 iterations, and so on. Total iterations might be O(n * a_i) = 200000 * 200000 = 40e9 -> too slow.\n\n  Therefore, we must optimize.\n\n  We note that the inner loop is: \n      for j in range(0, z):\n          d += C(index+j, index)\n\n      = sum_{j=0}^{z-1} C(index+j, index) = C(index+z, index+1)   [ by the hockey-stick identity ]\n\n  because: \n      sum_{j=0}^{z-1} C(index+j, index) = C(index+z, index+1)\n\n  Therefore, we can replace the inner loop by a single binomial coefficient.\n\n  So:\n      for index, z in enumerate(a):\n          if z==0:\n              break\n          d = (d + C(index+z, index+1)) % mod\n\n  For the instance a0=2, a1=2 (n=1):\n      index=0, z=2: d = 0 + C(0+2,0+1) = C(2,1)=2.\n      index=1, z=2: d = 2 + C(1+2,1+1) = 2 + C(3,2)=2+3=5.\n\n  For the instance a0=2, a1=1 (n=1):\n      index=0, z=2: d = 0 + C(2,1)=2.\n      index=1, z=1: d = 2 + C(1+1,2)=2+C(2,2)=2+1=3.\n\n  Therefore, the answer for the sample \"1\\n2 1\" is 3, and for \"1\\n2 2\" is 5.\n\n  But the problem says the sample \"1\\n2 1\" should output 5, and the example note has the instance \"1\\n2 2\" and output 5.\n\n  So the problem's sample input \"1\\n2 1\" might be a typo, and it should be \"1\\n2 2\". \n\n  Given the problem says the sample input is \"1\\n2 1\" and the output is 5, and our solution for \"1\\n2 2\" is 5, we assume the intended sample is \"1\\n2 2\". \n\n  Therefore, we output the code for program2.py as:\n\n      for index, z in enumerate(list of integers):\n          if z == 0:\n              break\n          # Then we do: d = (d + C(index+z, index+1)) % mod\n          # How to compute C(index+z, index+1) with the precomputed factorials f?\n          # C(n, k) = f[n] * inv(f[k]) * inv(f[n-k]) % mod, but we don't have inv_fact in the code, but we can use pow(f[k], mod-2, mod) and similarly for f[n-k]? \n          # But the code has only f (which is factorials) up to 9**6=531441, but index+z might be up to (n + max(a_i)) = 200000+200000=400000, and 400000 < 531441, so it's within the range.\n\n          n_val = index + z\n          k_val = index+1\n          # But note: if index+1 might be > n_val, then C=0.\n          if k_val < 0 or k_val > n_val:\n              term = 0\n          else:\n              term = f[n_val] * pow(f[k_val], mod-2, mod) % mod * pow(f[n_val-k_val], mod-2, mod) % mod\n          d = (d + term) % mod\n\n  But wait, the provided code has a list `f` of factorials. We can do:\n\n          term = f[index+z] * pow(f[index+1], mod-2, m) * pow(f[index+z - (index+1)], mod-2, m) % m\n\n  =        term = f[index+z] * pow(f[index+1], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[ z-1 ], m-2, m) % m\n\n  But note: index+z - (index+1) = z-1.\n\n  However, if index+1 > index+z, then skip, but index+1 <= index+z because z>=1 (since if z==0 we break).\n\n  But if z==0, we break. So for z>=1, then index+z >= index+1.\n\n  Therefore, we can do in the TODO for each z:\n\n      if z==0: break\n      n_val = index + z\n      k_val = index+1\n      term = f[n_val] * pow(f[k_val], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[n_val - k_val], m-2, m) % m\n      d = (d + term) % m\n\n  But note: the pow with modular exponentiation might be slow, and we are within the loop of n+1 iterations, which is 200000+1, and each does two modular exponentiation with exponent m-2 (which is 10**9+5) -> might be slow.\n\n  Alternatively, we could have precomputed the inv_fact array. But the code has only the factorial array `f`.\n\n  Since the problem's constraints are 200000, and we are doing 200000 iterations, and modular exponentiation with exponent 10**9+5 might be O(log(mod)) which is about 30 iterations, so 200000*30 = 6e6 -> acceptable in Python.\n\n  Therefore, we can do.\n\n  Let's test with the instance [2,2] (n=1) and index0:"
