We can do:\n\n            while h+g <= m and e < r-1:\n                if lowest < highest:\n                    # add one more to Alice: at index e+1\n                    e += 1\n                    lowest += lst[e]\n                    g += 1\n                elif highest < lowest:\n                    # add one more to Bob: at index r-1\n                    r -= 1\n                    highest += lst[r]\n                    h += 1\n                else: # equal\n                    # record the current total: g+h\n                    index = g+h   # because this is a valid partition\n                    # then we add to Alice to see if we can get a larger one? if e < r-1:\n                        e += 1\n                        lowest += lst[e]\n                        g += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n          Then after the while loop, if we break and the last state was equality, we have recorded index. But what if we break because of the condition e>=r-1?",

In the condition, when we add to Alice at index e+1, we must ensure that e+1 < r.\n\n          In the example [1,2,3,2,1]:\n            After the first equality: e=0, r=4 -> then we add to Alice: e=1 -> then the state: e=1, r=4. Then we add to Bob: r=3 -> state: e=1, r=3. Then we have an equality: left_sum=1+2=3, right_sum=1+2=3 -> then we set index=4. Then we add to Alice: e=2 -> now e=2, r=3 -> then left_sum=1+2+3=6. Then we add to Bob: r=2 -> now r=2, but e=2 -> they meet at index2, and we are about to add the same candy? So we should not allow e to become >=r.\n\n          Therefore, in the while condition, we should have: e < r-1 for adding, because when we add to Alice, we do e+1, and we require e+1 < r.\n\n          In the branch for adding, we should also check if e+1 < r for Alice, and for Bob, we require r-1 > e.\n\n          So we can do in the branches:\n\n            if lowest < highest and e < r-1:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            elif highest < lowest and e < r-1: r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            elif lowest == highest:\n                index = g+h\n                if e < r-1:\n                    # we add to Alice\n                    e += 1\n                    lowest += lst[e]\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n            else: \n                break   # we cannot add to either without overlapping\n\n          Then for [1,2,3,2,1]:\n            After the first equality (e=0, r=4, index=2), we add to Alice: e=1, lowest=3, g=2. Then we have 3>1 -> add to Bob: r=3, highest=3, h=2 -> then we have equality: index=4. Then we try to add to Alice: e=2, but then e=2 and r=3 -> e<r-1? 2<2 -> false, so we break. So we output 4. But the optimal for [1,2,3,2,1] is to have Alice [0] and Bob [4] -> 2 candies, or Alice [0,1] and Bob [3,4] -> 4 candies, or Alice [0,1,2] and Bob [2,3,4] -> overlap at index2. So 4 is the maximum. However, the known solution would do:\n\n            l=0, r=4: left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> left_sum<=right_sum -> add a[0]=1 -> l=1, left_sum=1. then left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> add to right: a[4]=1 -> right_sum=1, r=3 -> then equality: index = 1 + (5-1-3) = 1+ (1) = 2.\n            then l=1, r=3: left_sum=1, right_sum=1 -> then left_sum<=right_sum -> add a[1]=2 -> left_sum=3, l=2. then left_sum=3, right_sum=1 -> add to right: a[3]=2 -> right_sum=3, r=2 -> then equality: index = 2 + (5-1-2)=2+2=4. then l=2, r=2: left_sum=3, right_sum=3 -> then add to left: a[2]=3 -> left_sum=6, l=3 -> then r=2, l>r -> break. output 4. So both methods give 4.",

For example, if e = r-2, then we can add one to Alice: e becomes r-1, and then the next candy for Bob would be at r-1, which is the same as Alice -> overlap. So we require e < r-1 for adding one more candy. Therefore, the while condition can remain `while h+g <= m` and we break in the branches if we cannot add. Given the above, for program1.py, the completion for the TODO branch is:\n\n            r -= 1\n            highest += lst[r]\n            h += 1 But with an if condition?",

So for the TODO branch, we output:\n\n                if e < r-1:\n                    r -= 1\n                    highest += lst[r]\n                    h += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        Therefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n          \"                if e < r-1:\\n                    r -= 1\\n                    highest += lst[r]\\n                    h += 1\\n                else:\\n                    break\"\n\n        But wait, the equality branch has:\n\n                lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                e+=1\n                g+=1\n                index = e + (m - r)\n\n        which is 4 lines, each indented by 12 spaces. So the above is consistent. However, the condition in the if: 'e < r-1' -> note: e and r are integers. We are good. Let's output the answer.",

Then: left_sum (a0) and right_sum (0) -> a0>0 -> so we do else: add a5 -> right_sum = a5, r=4 -> not equal. Then: if left_sum (a0) <= right_sum (a5)? -> if true, add a1 -> left_sum = a0+a1, l=2 -> then check: a0+a1 == a5? Then: if a0+a1 <= a5? -> if true, add a2 -> left_sum = a0+a1+a2 = 7, l=3 -> then check: 7 == a5? -> no, unless a5=7?

After we have left_sum=7, then we compare with right_sum (which is a5). Then 7>a5 -> so we add a4: right_sum = a5+a4 -> then 7>a5+a4? -> then add a3: right_sum = a5+a4+a3 = 7 -> then we check: 7==7 -> set ans = l (which is 3) + (n-1 - r) -> n=6, r=2? How did r become 2? Steps:\n\n            l=0, r=5: left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> add a0 -> l=1, left_sum=a0. Then: left_sum>0? -> no, but then we compare: a0>0 -> then we add a5 -> r=4, right_sum=a5. Then: if a0<=a5? -> if true, add a1 -> l=2, left_sum=a0+a1. Then: if a0+a1<=a5? -> if true, add a2 -> l=3, left_sum=7. Then: if 7<=a5? -> no -> so we add a4: r=3, right_sum=a5+a4. Then: if 7<=a5+a4? -> no -> so we add a3: r=2, right_sum=a5+a4+a3=7. Then: check: 7==7 -> set ans = l (3) + (6-1-2) = 3 + (3) = 6. So it works. Therefore, we can replace the while loop in program1.py with:\n\n          l = 0\n          r = m-1\n          left_sum = 0\n          right_sum = 0\n          index = 0\n          while l <= r: if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                  left_sum += lst[l]\n                  l += 1\n              else:\n                  right_sum += lst[r]\n                  r -= 1\n              if left_sum == right_sum:\n                  index = l + (m - 1 - r)   # because l is the count of left candies (we have added l candies: indices 0 to l-1) and the right has (m-1 - r) candies (indices r+1 to m-1) Then print(index)\n\n        But note: the provided code already has:\n\n          e = 0, r = m-1, and then a while loop with condition `h+g<=m`.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code has a while loop that tries to expand the segments from the left (for Alice) and the right (for Bob) until they meet.\n The idea is to have two pointers: one starting at the left (e) and one at the right (r). \n We maintain two running sums: `lowest` (the total weight of Alice's candies) and `highest` (the total weight of Bob's candies).\n We are trying to make these two sums equal. When they are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (which is e+1 from the left and m - r from the right, so total = (e+1) + (m - r) = e+1 + m - r).\n\n However, the provided code has some issues and incomplete parts.\n\n Let's analyze the provided code:\n\n   n = int(input())   # actually, this is the number of test cases, but the variable is reused? \n   for i in range(n):\n        h = 1          # not sure what h is for? \n        g = 1          # similarly g?\n        counter = 0\n        m = int(input())   # number of candies\n        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        index = 0      # this will store the answer for the test case: the maximum total candies eaten when the sums are equal\n        e = 0          # left pointer (current left candy index, so Alice has eaten [0, e] -> e+1 candies)\n        r = m-1        # right pointer (Bob has eaten [r, m-1] -> m - r candies)\n        highest = lst[m-1]   # Bob's current total (starting with the last candy)\n        lowest = lst[0]      # Alice's current total (starting with the first candy)\n\n        while h+g <= m:   # h and g are not updated in a way that matches the condition? Actually, h and g are incremented but we don't see their initial purpose.\n\n        Actually, let's see the condition: h+g <= m. Initially h=1, g=1 -> 2<=m. Then in the loop:\n          if lowest < highest:\n             lowest += lst[e+1]   # so we take the next left candy (e+1) and add to Alice\n             e += 1\n             g += 1               # why g? \n          elif highest < lowest:\n             # TODO: Your code here   -> we need to add to Bob? \n          elif highest == lowest:\n             # then we record the current total: index = e + (m - r)  -> but note: at this point, Alice has eaten e+1 candies? \n             # Actually, e is the current index of the last candy Alice ate. So the count is e+1 (from the left) and from the right: Bob has eaten from r to m-1 -> that's m - r candies.\n             # So total = (e+1) + (m - r) = e+1 + m - r.\n\n             Then the code does: \n                 lowest += lst[e+1]\n                 e += 1\n                 g += 1\n\n        This is problematic because when we have equality, we are only expanding the left? And then we break the condition? \n\n        Also, note that the condition in the while loop: h+g <= m. Initially h=1, g=1 -> 2<=m. Then we update g in the first branch and the third branch. But what about h? \n\n        Actually, the variables h and g are not used in the logic of the sums. They seem to be counters for the total candies eaten? But then we have e and r for the pointers.\n\n        Let me reframe the problem:\n\n        We want to have:\n          Alice: [0, i] -> sum_left = prefix[i]\n          Bob: [j, n-1] -> sum_right = suffix[j]\n\n        We want prefix[i] == suffix[j] and we want to maximize (i+1) + (n - j).\n\n        We can use two pointers: \n          left_ptr = 0, right_ptr = n-1\n          left_sum = arr[0], right_sum = arr[n-1]\n\n        Then we move:\n          if left_sum < right_sum: then we move left_ptr to the right and add to left_sum.\n          if left_sum > right_sum: then we move right_ptr to the left and add to right_sum.\n          if equal: we record the total candies = (left_ptr+1) + (n - right_ptr) and then we try to break by moving one of the pointers? But note: we can continue to see if we can get a larger total? However, the problem says they cannot skip, so we must have contiguous segments from the ends.\n\n        However, note: when we get an equality, we can break and then try to continue? Actually, we can continue by moving one pointer and then try to get another equality? But the problem asks for the maximum total candies.\n\n        But observe: if we have an equality at (i, j), then we can reset? Actually, no: we are expanding from the ends. We can only move the pointers inward.\n\n        Actually, the standard solution for this problem (which is known as \"Candies\" from a contest) is:\n\n          left_ptr = -1, right_ptr = n\n          left_sum = 0, right_sum = 0\n          ans = 0\n          while left_ptr < right_ptr:\n             if left_sum == right_sum:\n                 ans = (left_ptr+1) + (n - right_ptr)   # because left_ptr is 0-indexed: the number of left candies is left_ptr+1, and right candies is n - right_ptr.\n                 # then we can move one from the left to try to get more? \n                 left_ptr += 1\n                 if left_ptr < right_ptr:\n                     left_sum += arr[left_ptr]\n                 else:\n                     break\n             elif left_sum < right_sum:\n                 left_ptr += 1\n                 if left_ptr < right_ptr:\n                     left_sum += arr[left_ptr]\n                 else:\n                     break\n             else: # left_sum > right_sum\n                 right_ptr -= 1\n                 if left_ptr < right_ptr:\n                     right_sum += arr[right_ptr]\n                 else:\n                     break\n\n          Then we output ans.\n\n        But note: the above might not capture the last equality? Actually, we update ans only when we have equality. And we break when the pointers meet.\n\n        However, we want the maximum total candies. So we should update ans whenever we have an equality and then continue? Because we might have a later equality that gives more candies? Actually, no: because we are moving the pointers inward. The total candies at an equality is (left_ptr+1) + (n - right_ptr). As we move the pointers, the total candies might be updated to a larger value? Actually, no: because we are adding more candies to one side and then the other, but the total candies eaten is increasing? \n\n        Actually, the total candies eaten is (left_ptr+1) + (n - right_ptr). As we move the pointers, we are including more candies. But note: when we have an equality, we record the current total. Then we move the left pointer (in the equality branch) to try to get a new configuration. The next time we get an equality, the total candies might be larger? \n\n        However, consider: \n          Initially: left_ptr=-1, right_ptr=n -> left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> equality -> ans = 0+0 = 0? Then we move left_ptr to 0 -> left_sum = arr[0]. Then we continue.\n\n        We want to maximize the total. So we should record the maximum ans.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n          left_ptr = 0, right_ptr = n-1\n          left_sum = 0, right_sum = 0\n          ans = 0\n          while left_ptr <= right_ptr:\n             if left_sum == right_sum:\n                 ans = (left_ptr) + (n - 1 - right_ptr)  ??? \n\n        Actually, let me use the known solution from Codeforces for the same problem (Candies) (problem name: \"Candies\" in Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3) - C).\n\n        Known solution:\n\n          t = int(input())\n          for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            l = 0\n            r = n - 1\n            left_sum = 0\n            right_sum = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while l <= r:\n                if left_sum < right_sum:\n                    left_sum += a[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    right_sum += a[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if left_sum == right_sum:\n                    ans = l + (n - 1 - r)   # because l is the next left index (so the number of left candies is l, because we have added a[0] to a[l-1] -> l candies) and the right has from r+1 to n-1 -> n-1 - r candies.\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But note: the above does not exactly match the example. Let me test with the example:\n\n          Example 1: [1, 2, 1] -> n=3\n            l=0, r=2\n            left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> then we go to else? (since 0>=0) -> right_sum=1, r=1 -> then check: 0==1? no.\n            then left_sum<right_sum (0<1) -> left_sum=1, l=1 -> now left_sum=1, right_sum=1 -> set ans = 1 + (3-1-1) = 1+ (1) = 2 -> then l=1, r=1 -> then we do: left_sum>=right_sum -> so add to right: but wait, we have l<=r -> true. Then we do: since left_sum>=right_sum -> add a[r] (which is a[1]=2) to right_sum -> becomes 3, then r=0 -> now l=1, r=0 -> break? \n            Then we output 2 -> which is correct.\n\n          Example 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> n=8, expected answer 7? \n            How? \n            Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n            Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30\n            So total candies: 3 (from left) + 4 (from right) = 7.\n\n            In the known solution above, we would have:\n\n            We want to get to 30 on both sides.\n\n            The known solution above does not necessarily get the maximum total? Actually, it stops when the pointers cross? And it updates ans whenever there is an equality.\n\n            But note: the known solution above does not necessarily traverse all possibilities? \n\n        Actually, the known solution above is for a different problem? \n\n        After checking, the problem \"Candies\" in Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3) is exactly this. The known solution:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n              l = 0\n              r = n-1\n              suml = 0\n              sumr = 0\n              ans = 0\n              while l <= r:\n                  if suml <= sumr:\n                      suml += arr[l]\n                      l += 1\n                  else:\n                      sumr += arr[r]\n                      r -= 1\n                  if suml == sumr:\n                      ans = l + (n - r - 1)\n              print(ans)\n\n        But wait, in the example [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] we need to get 7. How does this algorithm work?\n\n          Step-by-step:\n\n          l=0, r=7: suml=0, sumr=0 -> then we do: if 0<=0 -> true: suml=7, l=1 -> then check: 7==0? no.\n          Then: l=1, r=7: now 7>0 -> so else: sumr=1, r=6 -> 7 vs 1 -> then if: 7>1 -> else: add to right: sumr=1+11=12, r=5 -> 7 vs 12 -> then we do if: 7<=12 -> true: add arr[1]=3 -> suml=10, l=2 -> 10 vs 12 -> then if: 10<=12 -> true: add arr[2]=20 -> suml=30, l=3 -> now 30 vs 12 -> then else: add to right: arr[5]=8 -> sumr=20, r=4 -> 30 vs 20 -> then else: add to right: arr[4]=10 -> sumr=30, r=3 -> now check: 30==30 -> set ans = l (which is 3) + (n - r - 1) = 3 + (8-3-1)=3+4=7 -> then l=3, r=3 -> we break? because l<=r -> true, then we do: if 30<=30 -> true: add arr[3]=5 -> suml=35, l=4 -> then check: 35==30? no -> then l=4, r=3 -> break.\n\n          So it outputs 7 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, we can fix program1.py by:\n\n          We note that the provided code has:\n            while h+g <= m:   # but h and g are not updated in a meaningful way? \n\n          Instead, we can use:\n\n            l = 0\n            r = n-1\n            left_sum = 0\n            right_sum = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while l <= r:\n                if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                    left_sum += arr[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    right_sum += arr[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if left_sum == right_sum:\n                    # then we record the total candies: \n                    #   left candies: l (because we have added l candies: indices 0 to l-1)\n                    #   right candies: n-1 - r (because we have added from r+1 to n-1 -> that's n-1 - r candies)\n                    # total = l + (n - 1 - r) -> but note: the example above used n - r - 1, which is the same as (n-1) - r + 0? Actually, the count is (l) + (n - 1 - r) = l + n - 1 - r.\n                    # However, in the example: l=3, r=3 -> 3 + 8 - 1 - 3 = 3+4=7 -> correct.\n                    ans = l + (n - 1 - r)   # but note: n is the total number of candies? which is m in the code.\n\n          But in the provided code, the variable for the number of candies is `m`. So:\n\n            ans = l + (m - 1 - r)   # but wait: we have l and r as pointers.\n\n          However, the provided code uses:\n            e: left pointer (which we are going to replace by l) and r: right pointer.\n\n          But note: the provided code already has:\n            m = int(input())   # number of candies\n\n          So we can rewrite the while loop.\n\n        However, the provided code has a variable `index` that is printed at the end. We can set `index = ans` at the end of the while loop? But note: the while loop condition in the provided code is `while h+g <= m` which we are going to change.\n\n        Let's restructure the code for the test case:\n\n          We'll do:\n\n            l = 0\n            r = m-1\n            left_sum = 0\n            right_sum = 0\n            index = 0   # we'll update index when we get an equality\n\n            while l <= r:\n                if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                    left_sum += lst[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    right_sum += lst[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if left_sum == right_sum:\n                    index = l + (m - 1 - r)   # because the left has l candies (indices 0 to l-1) and the right has (m-1 - r) candies (indices r+1 to m-1)\n\n            print(index)\n\n        But note: what if there is no equality? Then index remains 0? That matches the third test case: [3,6] -> no non-zero equality -> output 0.\n\n        However, the example: \n          Test case 1: [1, 2, 1] -> output 2.\n          Test case 2: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> output 7? but the example says 6? \n\n        Wait, the example says for the second test case: \n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n        But wait, the example says: \n          \"The second test case: Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n        How? \n          The array: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> but the example says the second test case? \n\n        Actually, the problem statement says:\n\n          \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n        And the second test case is:\n\n          \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n        So the second test case must be a different array.\n\n        The example second test case: \n          n=6? and the array? \n          The problem says: \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\"\n\n        But the example fourth test case is the one with 8 candies and answer 7.\n\n        Therefore, the code we are writing must work for the second test case as described: \n          Alice: first three from the left -> total 7\n          Bob: first three from the right -> total 7\n          and they have eaten 6 candies.\n\n        How do we get 6? \n          The array must be of length 6? \n          Example: [1,1,1,1,1,1]? but then if Alice eats 3 ones -> 3, Bob eats 3 ones -> 3, total 6.\n\n        But the problem says: \"the first three from the left\" and \"the first three from the right\" -> so the array must be such that the first three and the last three are non overlapping? \n\n        Actually, if the array has 6 candies: [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]\n          Alice: [a0, a1, a2] -> sum = 7\n          Bob: [a3, a4, a5] -> sum = 7\n\n        Then total candies eaten: 3+3=6.\n\n        How does our algorithm work for [a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] with a0+a1+a2 = 7 and a3+a4+a5=7?\n\n          Steps:\n\n          l=0, r=5\n          left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> left_sum<=right_sum -> add a0 -> left_sum=a0, l=1 -> then check: a0==0? no.\n          Then: if a0<=0? -> false? no, then we compare: a0 and 0 -> then we do: \n          Now: left_sum = a0, right_sum=0 -> then we do else: add a5 to right_sum -> right_sum = a5, r=4 -> then check: a0==a5? not necessarily.\n          ... until we get to the point where we have added a0, a1, a2 to left_sum and a3, a4, a5 to right_sum? \n\n          Actually, we are moving from the ends and adding until we get an equality. We don't necessarily get the partition at the middle? \n\n          How do we get the partition at the middle? \n\n          We want to have left_sum = a0+a1+a2 = 7, and right_sum = a3+a4+a5 = 7.\n\n          The algorithm:\n\n            l=0, r=5: left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> left_sum<=right_sum -> add a0 -> left_sum= a0, l=1 -> then not equal.\n            Then: left_sum (a0) and right_sum (0) -> a0>0 -> so we do else: add a5 -> right_sum = a5, r=4 -> not equal.\n            Then: if left_sum (a0) <= right_sum (a5)? -> if true, add a1 -> left_sum = a0+a1, l=2 -> then check: a0+a1 == a5? \n            Then: if a0+a1 <= a5? -> if true, add a2 -> left_sum = a0+a1+a2 = 7, l=3 -> then check: 7 == a5? -> no, unless a5=7? \n            Then: now left_sum=7, right_sum=a5 -> then we do: if 7<=a5? -> if true, we add a3? but that would be the next left? but that is the middle? \n\n          Actually, we are not going to get the partition at the middle until we have:\n\n            left_sum = a0+a1+a2 = 7\n            right_sum = a5+a4+a3 = 7\n\n          How do we add a3, a4, a5? \n\n          After we have left_sum=7, then we compare with right_sum (which is a5). Then 7>a5 -> so we add a4: right_sum = a5+a4 -> then 7>a5+a4? -> then add a3: right_sum = a5+a4+a3 = 7 -> then we check: 7==7 -> set ans = l (which is 3) + (n-1 - r) -> n=6, r=2? \n\n          How did r become 2? \n\n          Steps:\n\n            l=0, r=5: left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> add a0 -> l=1, left_sum=a0.\n            Then: left_sum>0? -> no, but then we compare: a0>0 -> then we add a5 -> r=4, right_sum=a5.\n            Then: if a0<=a5? -> if true, add a1 -> l=2, left_sum=a0+a1.\n            Then: if a0+a1<=a5? -> if true, add a2 -> l=3, left_sum=7.\n            Then: if 7<=a5? -> no -> so we add a4: r=3, right_sum=a5+a4.\n            Then: if 7<=a5+a4? -> no -> so we add a3: r=2, right_sum=a5+a4+a3=7.\n            Then: check: 7==7 -> set ans = l (3) + (6-1-2) = 3 + (3) = 6.\n\n          So it works.\n\n        Therefore, we can replace the while loop in program1.py with:\n\n          l = 0\n          r = m-1\n          left_sum = 0\n          right_sum = 0\n          index = 0\n          while l <= r:\n              if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                  left_sum += lst[l]\n                  l += 1\n              else:\n                  right_sum += lst[r]\n                  r -= 1\n              if left_sum == right_sum:\n                  index = l + (m - 1 - r)   # because l is the count of left candies (we have added l candies: indices 0 to l-1) and the right has (m-1 - r) candies (indices r+1 to m-1)\n\n          Then print(index)\n\n        But note: the provided code already has:\n\n          e = 0, r = m-1, and then a while loop with condition `h+g<=m`. We are going to change the entire inner part.\n\n        Since the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", and the TODO is only in the `elif highest<lowest` branch, but actually the entire logic is flawed, we might need to replace the whole while loop.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and we are allowed to fill in the missing parts. But note: the TODO is only in one branch. But the provided code has:\n\n          while h+g <= m:\n             if lowest < highest: ... \n             elif highest < lowest: ...   # TODO here\n             elif highest == lowest: ...\n\n        We are going to replace the entire while loop? But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program\"\n\n        We are to output only the missing parts. The TODO is in the `elif highest<lowest` branch. But the entire logic is incomplete. \n\n        Alternatively, we can fix the provided code by completing the TODO and also adjusting the other branches? \n\n        The provided code uses:\n\n          lowest = lst[0]   # Alice starts with the first candy\n          highest = lst[m-1] # Bob starts with the last candy\n\n          Then in the while loop:\n\n          if lowest < highest: \n             then add the next left candy to Alice: e+1, so g is incremented (g is the count of Alice's candies? but initially g=1, then becomes 2, etc.) and e is incremented.\n\n          elif highest < lowest: \n             then we should add the next right candy to Bob? \n\n          elif equal: then we record the current total: index = e + (m - r)   -> but note: at this point, Alice has eaten e+1 candies? \n                because e started at 0 (meaning the first candy) and then when we add, we do e+=1 -> then e becomes 1 meaning two candies? \n                Actually, the initial state: e=0 -> Alice has one candy (index0). Then when we add, we do e+=1 -> then e=1, and then we add lst[1] -> so now Alice has two candies: indices0 and 1.\n\n          So the total candies for Alice is e+1? \n          For Bob: initially r = m-1 -> one candy. Then when we add a candy to Bob, we do r-=1? and then Bob has the candies from r to m-1? but if we do r-=1, then Bob has two candies: the last one and the one before last? \n\n          But the provided code does not have a variable for Bob's count? It uses g for Alice? and h for Bob? \n\n          The condition: while h+g <= m:   # h is Bob's count? g is Alice's count? \n\n          Initially: h=1, g=1 -> total=2.\n\n          Then in the branch for Alice: we do g+=1 -> so g becomes 2, then total h+g=3, etc.\n\n          So we can complete the TODO:\n\n          elif highest < lowest:\n              highest += lst[r-1]   # because Bob is going to take the next candy to the left of the current r? \n              r -= 1\n              h += 1\n\n          And in the equality branch, we do:\n\n          elif highest == lowest:\n              # record the current total: \n              index = (e+1) + (m - r)   # because Alice: e+1 candies, Bob: m - r candies (since Bob has from r to m-1 -> that's m - r candies)\n              # then we expand Alice? \n              # But note: we can also expand Bob? or we can break? \n              # The problem: we want the maximum total. So we should continue? \n              # The provided code expands Alice: \n                 lowest += lst[e+1]\n                 e += 1\n                 g += 1\n\n          However, this might miss the opportunity to expand Bob and get a larger total? \n\n          Actually, we should try to continue until the segments meet? \n\n          But the known solution does not stop at the first equality? It continues until the pointers meet and records the last equality? \n\n          How can we fix the provided code to match the known solution? \n\n          We can change the condition: we want to run while e < r? \n\n          Actually, the condition `h+g <= m` is equivalent to the total candies eaten so far (h+g) is <= the total available. But we also have the pointers: e and r. We should break when e>=r? \n\n          The known solution uses l<=r. \n\n          Alternatively, we can restructure the provided code to use the two pointers without h and g? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", and the TODO is only in one branch. \n\n          However, the provided code has multiple issues. \n\n        Given the complexity, and since the problem allows us to output the missing code as a block, we can replace the entire while loop with the known solution? \n\n        But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we can output the entire block for the while loop? \n\n        However, the TODO is only in one branch. But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        We are to fill in the missing parts. The missing part in program1.py is the TODO in the `elif highest<lowest` branch. But the rest is provided? \n\n        But the provided code in the equality branch is also flawed? \n\n        After re-examining the problem: the known solution does not use the initial setting of `lowest` and `highest` to the first and last candy. It starts with zeros. \n\n        How about we adjust the provided code to start with zeros? \n\n        Actually, the provided code starts with:\n\n          e = 0, r = m-1\n          lowest = lst[0]   # so Alice has taken the first candy -> e=0, and g=1 (count=1)\n          highest = lst[m-1] # Bob has taken the last candy -> r=m-1, and h=1 (count=1)\n\n        Then the while condition: h+g<=m -> 2<=m -> true.\n\n        Then we compare: if lowest < highest? etc.\n\n        This is similar to the known solution after the first step? \n\n        But the known solution starts with zeros and then adds the first candy? \n\n        Actually, the known solution does:\n\n          l=0, r=n-1, left_sum=0, right_sum=0\n\n          Then in the first step: \n             if 0<=0 -> true: add arr[0] -> left_sum=arr[0], l=1.\n\n          Then next step: then compare left_sum and right_sum -> if left_sum>right_sum -> then add arr[n-1] to right_sum, r=n-2.\n\n        So the provided code is one step ahead? \n\n        We can adjust by:\n\n          Instead of starting with the first and last, we start with zeros and then the while loop condition: while e < r? \n\n        But the problem says: the provided code has a while loop condition `h+g<=m` and we are to complete the TODO.\n\n        Alternatively, we can complete the TODO and fix the equality branch? \n\n        The known solution updates the answer at every equality. So we should do the same.\n\n        We can change the provided code:\n\n          index = 0   # we'll update index whenever we have an equality.\n\n          while h+g <= m:\n              if lowest < highest:\n                  # we need to add a candy to Alice\n                  e += 1\n                  if e < m:   # to avoid index out of bounds? but condition h+g<=m should ensure we don't go over?\n                      lowest += lst[e]\n                  g += 1\n              elif highest < lowest:\n                  # TODO: add a candy to Bob\n                  r -= 1\n                  if r >= 0:   # but r is initially m-1, so r-1 is at least 0? \n                      highest += lst[r]\n                  h += 1\n              else: # equal\n                  # record the current total: \n                  #   Alice has g candies, Bob has h candies -> total = g+h\n                  # and we want to record the maximum total? \n                  index = g + h   # because at this equality, they have eaten g+h candies.\n                  # then we try to add a candy to Alice? to see if we can get a larger total? \n                  # But note: we can also add to Bob? \n                  # Actually, we can add to either? \n                  # The known solution adds to the left when equal? \n                  # But the known solution does: if left_sum<=right_sum -> then add to left. \n                  # So we do:\n                  e += 1\n                  if e < m and e < r:   # we must ensure we don't cross the right pointer? \n                      lowest += lst[e]\n                  g += 1\n\n          Then after the while loop, we print(index)\n\n        But will this work? \n\n        Example [1,2,1] (n=3):\n\n          e=0, r=2, lowest=1, highest=1, g=1, h=1 -> equality: then we set index = 1+1 = 2, then we add to Alice: e becomes 1, then we add lst[1]=2 -> lowest=3, g=2.\n          Then condition: h+g=3<=3 -> true.\n          Then compare: 3 and 1 -> 3>1 -> then we do the elif: add to Bob: r becomes 1, then add lst[1] to highest? -> but wait, Bob's candies are from the right. Bob has already taken the last candy (index2). Now we are taking index1? but that is the middle. \n\n          This is overlapping.\n\n        We must ensure that we do not let e>=r? \n\n        So we should break when e>=r? \n\n        Actually, in the while condition: h+g<=m, but we also need to ensure that there are candies left? \n\n        We can change the condition to: while h+g <= m and e < r-1? \n\n        But it's messy.\n\n        Given the time, and since the known solution is simpler, I propose to replace the entire block from the initialization of the pointers to the end of the while loop.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the TODO is only in one branch. \n\n        However, the problem also says: \"with missing lines or blocks\", so we can output a block that includes more than one line? \n\n        And the provided code has:\n\n          while h+g <= m:\n             ... # with a TODO in one branch\n\n        We are going to output the entire while loop block? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the missing part for the TODO and also note that the equality branch should record the answer and then expand, but also we must break the loop when e and r meet? \n\n        This is very error-prone.\n\n        After careful thought, I think the intended solution for program1.py is the known solution. And the provided code is an incomplete attempt. \n\n        Therefore, I will output for program1.py the entire while loop block, but only the block that is missing? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the entire while loop is present but with a TODO. We are to complete the TODO and also fix the other branches if necessary? \n\n        But the equality branch is also provided and it is not optimal.\n\n        How about we do:\n\n          We'll replace the while loop with:\n\n            l = 0\n            r = m-1\n            left_sum = 0\n            right_sum = 0\n            index = 0\n            while l <= r:\n                if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                    left_sum += lst[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    right_sum += lst[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if left_sum == right_sum:\n                    index = l + (m - 1 - r)\n\n          But then we must remove the existing while loop and the variables e, r, highest, lowest, h, g.\n\n        However, the provided code uses:\n\n          e=0, r=m-1, highest=lst[m-1], lowest=lst[0], h=1, g=1.\n\n        We are not using these.\n\n        So we are replacing from the line `while h+g <= m:` to the end of the while loop.\n\n        The code after the while loop is `print(index)`, which is already there.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing block is not just the TODO but the entire while loop logic. \n\n        Since the problem says we can fill in missing blocks, I will output the entire corrected block for the while loop and the necessary re-initialization? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and we are to output in the json: \n          { \"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\" }\n\n        What to put in \"completion\" for program1? \n\n        We are to fill in the TODO and also fix the equality branch? \n\n        Alternatively, we can keep the existing variables and try to mimic the known solution with the existing variables? \n\n        Let me try:\n\n          We can use:\n            e -> becomes the next left index to add (so far, Alice has candies [0, e] -> e+1 candies) -> but in the known solution, we use l as the next left index to add (and after adding, we increment l). \n            r -> the next right index to add.\n\n          We want to use:\n\n            left_sum = lowest, right_sum = highest.\n\n          But initially, we have already added the first and last. \n\n          We can start the while loop as:\n\n            while e < r-1:   # because if e and r are adjacent, then we cannot add more without overlapping.\n\n          But the known solution starts from scratch.\n\n        Given the complexity, and since the constraints are high (n up to 200000) and the total n over test cases is 200000, we can do the known solution which is O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, I will output the following completion:\n\n          We are replacing from the line `while h+g <= m:` to the end of the while loop with:\n\n            l = 0\n            r = m-1\n            left_sum = 0\n            right_sum = 0\n            index = 0\n            while l <= r:\n                if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                    left_sum += lst[l]\n                    l += 1\n                else:\n                    right_sum += lst[r]\n                    r -= 1\n                if left_sum == right_sum:\n                    index = l + (m - 1 - r)\n\n          But then we must remove the existing while loop. However, the existing while loop is the only while loop.\n\n        But the provided code has:\n\n          while h+g <= m:\n             ... # with a TODO\n\n        We are going to replace that while loop with the above block? \n\n        However, the above block uses different variables. We are not using h and g.\n\n        And after the while loop, we print(index) which is already there.\n\n        So for program1.py, the completion is the entire block of code from the while loop condition to the end of the while loop, but replaced by the known solution.\n\n        But note: the provided code has a variable `index` that is printed. We are setting `index` in the new while loop.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is the entire while loop block, but we are replacing it. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the provided code has a while loop that is incomplete. We are providing the entire while loop block.\n\n        So for program1.py, we output:\n\n          l = 0\n          r = m-1\n          left_sum = 0\n          right_sum = 0\n          index = 0\n          while l <= r:\n              if left_sum <= right_sum:\n                  left_sum += lst[l]\n                  l += 1\n              else:\n                  right_sum += lst[r]\n                  r -= 1\n              if left_sum == right_sum:\n                  index = l + (m - 1 - r)\n\n        But wait, the initializations of l, r, left_sum, right_sum, index are not in the provided code. We are to fill in the missing block, but the provided code already has:\n\n          index =0\n          e= 0\n          r =m-1\n          highest = lst[m-1]\n          lowest = lst[0]\n\n        We are not using these. So we must also remove these? \n\n        But the problem says: only output the missing code. We are only to output the code that is missing, which is the TODO and possibly adjustments.\n\n        Given the instructions, I think we are allowed to output the entire block that is missing, which in this case is the entire while loop and the necessary re-initialization? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the TODO is in one branch. \n\n        This is ambiguous.\n\n        Let me try to complete the provided code without changing the initial approach:\n\n          We keep:\n            e: next left index to add (currently, Alice has [0, e] -> e+1 candies, and the sum is `lowest`)\n            r: next right index to add (Bob has [r, m-1] -> m - r candies, sum `highest`)\n            h: count of Bob's candies (initially 1)\n            g: count of Alice's candies (initially 1)\n\n          The while condition: h+g<=m (which is the total candies eaten so far is less than or equal to the total available)\n\n          We also need to ensure that after adding, we don't overlap: so we require e < r-1? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            while h+g <= m and e < r-1:\n                if lowest < highest:\n                    # add one more to Alice: at index e+1\n                    e += 1\n                    lowest += lst[e]\n                    g += 1\n                elif highest < lowest:\n                    # add one more to Bob: at index r-1\n                    r -= 1\n                    highest += lst[r]\n                    h += 1\n                else: # equal\n                    # record the current total: g+h\n                    index = g+h   # because this is a valid partition\n                    # then we add to Alice to see if we can get a larger one? \n                    if e < r-1:\n                        e += 1\n                        lowest += lst[e]\n                        g += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n          Then after the while loop, if we break and the last state was equality, we have recorded index. But what if we break because of the condition e>=r-1? \n\n          Also, it is possible that we have an equality at the last move? \n\n          Example [1,2,1]: \n            e=0, r=2, g=1, h=1, lowest=1, highest=1 -> then we do the else: set index=2, then we try to add to Alice: e becomes 1, lowest=1+2=3, g=2.\n            then condition: h+g=3<=3 and e=1, r=2 -> e<r-1? 1<1 -> false -> break.\n            then print(index) -> 2.\n\n          Example [1,1,1,1]: \n            e=0, r=3: lowest=1, highest=1 -> index=2, then add to Alice: e=1, lowest=2, g=2.\n            then compare: 2>1 -> then add to Bob: r=2, highest=1+1=2, h=2.\n            then we have equality: index = 2+2=4.\n            then we try to add to Alice: e=2, but then e=2 and r=2 -> e<r-1? 2<1 -> false, break.\n            then print 4.\n\n          But is [1,1,1,1] valid? \n            Alice: [0,1] -> sum=2, Bob: [2,3] -> sum=2, total=4.\n\n          Example [1,2,3,2,1]: \n            e=0, r=4: lowest=1, highest=1 -> index=2, then add to Alice: e=1, lowest=3, g=2.\n            then compare: 3>1 -> add to Bob: r=3, highest=1+2=3, h=2 -> then we have equality: index=2+2=4.\n            then we add to Alice: e=2, lowest=3+3=6, g=3.\n            then compare: 6>3 -> add to Bob: r=2, highest=3+3=6, h=3 -> then we have equality: index=3+3=6.\n            then we try to add to Alice: e=3, but then e=3 and r=2 -> e>=r -> break.\n            print 6.\n\n          But wait, the entire array is eaten? \n            Alice: [0,1,2] -> 1+2+3=6\n            Bob: [2,3,4] -> 3+2+1=6 -> but wait, candy at index2 is eaten by both? \n\n          This is the flaw: we cannot eat the same candy.\n\n          In the condition, when we add to Alice at index e+1, we must ensure that e+1 < r.\n\n          In the example [1,2,3,2,1]:\n            After the first equality: e=0, r=4 -> then we add to Alice: e=1 -> then the state: e=1, r=4.\n            Then we add to Bob: r=3 -> state: e=1, r=3.\n            Then we have an equality: left_sum=1+2=3, right_sum=1+2=3 -> then we set index=4.\n            Then we add to Alice: e=2 -> now e=2, r=3 -> then left_sum=1+2+3=6.\n            Then we add to Bob: r=2 -> now r=2, but e=2 -> they meet at index2, and we are about to add the same candy? \n\n          So we should not allow e to become >=r.\n\n          Therefore, in the while condition, we should have: e < r-1 for adding, because when we add to Alice, we do e+1, and we require e+1 < r.\n\n          In the branch for adding, we should also check if e+1 < r for Alice, and for Bob, we require r-1 > e.\n\n          So we can do in the branches:\n\n            if lowest < highest and e < r-1:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            elif highest < lowest and e < r-1:\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            elif lowest == highest:\n                index = g+h\n                if e < r-1:\n                    # we add to Alice\n                    e += 1\n                    lowest += lst[e]\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n            else: \n                break   # we cannot add to either without overlapping\n\n          Then for [1,2,3,2,1]:\n            After the first equality (e=0, r=4, index=2), we add to Alice: e=1, lowest=3, g=2.\n            Then we have 3>1 -> add to Bob: r=3, highest=3, h=2 -> then we have equality: index=4.\n            Then we try to add to Alice: e=2, but then e=2 and r=3 -> e<r-1? 2<2 -> false, so we break.\n            So we output 4.\n\n          But the optimal for [1,2,3,2,1] is to have Alice [0] and Bob [4] -> 2 candies, or Alice [0,1] and Bob [3,4] -> 4 candies, or Alice [0,1,2] and Bob [2,3,4] -> overlap at index2.\n\n          So 4 is the maximum.\n\n          However, the known solution would do:\n\n            l=0, r=4: left_sum=0, right_sum=0 -> left_sum<=right_sum -> add a[0]=1 -> l=1, left_sum=1.\n            then left_sum=1, right_sum=0 -> add to right: a[4]=1 -> right_sum=1, r=3 -> then equality: index = 1 + (5-1-3) = 1+ (1) = 2.\n            then l=1, r=3: left_sum=1, right_sum=1 -> then left_sum<=right_sum -> add a[1]=2 -> left_sum=3, l=2.\n            then left_sum=3, right_sum=1 -> add to right: a[3]=2 -> right_sum=3, r=2 -> then equality: index = 2 + (5-1-2)=2+2=4.\n            then l=2, r=2: left_sum=3, right_sum=3 -> then add to left: a[2]=3 -> left_sum=6, l=3 -> then r=2, l>r -> break.\n            output 4.\n\n          So both methods give 4.\n\n          Therefore, we can complete the TODO in program1.py as follows:\n\n          In the branch `elif highest<lowest:` we do:\n\n            if e < r-1:\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          And in the equality branch, we do:\n\n            index = g + h   # record the current total\n            if e < r-1:\n                # expand Alice\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          And in the first branch, we should also check:\n\n            if e < r-1:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          And we change the while condition to: `while h+g <= m and e < r:`\n\n          But note: if e<r, then there is at least one candy between e and r.\n\n          However, in the branches, we require e<r-1 to add one more without overlapping? \n\n          For example, if e = r-2, then we can add one to Alice: e becomes r-1, and then the next candy for Bob would be at r-1, which is the same as Alice -> overlap.\n\n          So we require e < r-1 for adding one more candy.\n\n          Therefore, the while condition can remain `while h+g <= m` and we break in the branches if we cannot add.\n\n        Given the above, for program1.py, the completion for the TODO branch is:\n\n            r -= 1\n            highest += lst[r]\n            h += 1\n\n        But with an if condition? \n\n        The TODO branch is:\n\n          elif highest<lowest:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We will replace the TODO with:\n\n            if e < r-1:\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        And also, we must add the same if condition in the first branch and in the equality branch? \n\n        But the problem only asks for the TODO in that branch. \n\n        However, the provided code for the first branch is:\n\n          if lowest < highest:\n             lowest += lst[e+1]\n             e += 1\n             g += 1\n\n        This does not have the if condition. So it might cause overlap.\n\n        Therefore, to be safe, we might need to change all branches. But the problem only asks for the TODO.\n\n        Since the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and the provided code without bounds might work because the while condition h+g<=m ensures we don't exceed the total, but it doesn't ensure non-overlapping, we must have the bounds.\n\n        Given the instructions, I will only output the TODO branch for program1.py.\n\n        But note: the example [1,2,1] might work without the bound check because after the equality branch, we expand Alice and then the next step will have e=1, r=2, then in the next iteration: \n          condition: h+g=3<=3 -> true.\n          then we have: lowest=3, highest=1 -> then we do the TODO branch for highest<lowest? \n          then we do: r -= 1 -> r=1, then highest += lst[1] -> highest=1+2=3.\n          then we have: lowest=3, highest=3 -> then we do the equality branch: index = g+h = 2+2=4? -> but that's not valid because the candy at index1 is used by both.\n\n        Therefore, we must have the bound check in the TODO branch.\n\n        So for program1.py, the completion for the TODO branch is:\n\n            if e < r-1:\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        And we hope that the other branches are similarly fixed? \n\n        But the provided code for the first branch and the equality branch does not have the bound check. \n\n        However, the problem only requires to output the missing part for the TODO.\n\n        So for program1.py, we output only the block for the TODO branch.\n\n        But the TODO branch is only the elif branch. We are to output the code for that branch.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the completion is:\n\n            if e < r-1:\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        For program2.py:\n\n          The problem: count the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers that sum to n.\n\n          The provided code:\n\n            R=range\n            m=40001\n            d=10**9+7\n            p=[]\n            for i in R(1,m):\n                n=str(i)\n                if n==n[::-1]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            a=[1]+[0]*m\n            for i in p:\n                for j in R(i,m):\n                    a[j]+=a[j-i];a[j]%=d\n            for n in[*open(0)][1:]:print(a[int(n)])\n\n          The TODO is in the for loop: if i is palindromic, then we should add it to the list p.\n\n          So we do:\n\n            if n==n[::-1]:\n                p.append(i)\n\n          Then the next part: we are doing a dynamic programming for the number of ways.\n\n          We initialize a[0]=1 (because there is one way to make sum0: empty multiset).\n\n          Then for each palindromic number i, we iterate j from i to m, and do:\n\n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n          This is the standard coin change for unordered (which is what we want: distinct multisets).\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the completion for the TODO is:\n\n            p.append(i)\n\n        So the answer for program2.py is simply: p.append(i)\n\n        But note: the TODO is on the same line as the if condition. We can do:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]: p.append(i)\n\n        or in the next line.\n\n        Given the code style, we can do:\n\n          if n==n[::-1]: \n              p.append(i)\n\n        But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n        Since the TODO is at the end of the line, we can output: \"p.append(i)\".\n\n        However, the code after the TODO is already there: `a=[1]+[0]*m` etc.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the completion is: \"p.append(i)\".\n\n        But note: the provided code has a comment TODO, so we replace the TODO with the code.\n\n        So in the json, we output:\n\n          \"program1\": \"if e < r-1:\\n                r -= 1\\n                highest += lst[r]\\n                h += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\",\n          \"program2\": \"p.append(i)\"\n\n        However, for program1.py, we are only outputting the block for the TODO branch, not the entire while loop.\n\n        Let me double-check the fourth example with the provided code after fix:\n\n          [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] (n=8)\n\n          e=0, r=7: lowest=7, highest=1 -> highest<lowest -> then we do the TODO branch: \n             if e<r-1 (0<6) -> true: \n                 r=6, highest=1+11=12, h=2.\n          then: 7<12 -> then we do the first branch: \n             if e<r-1 (0<5) -> true: \n                 e=1, lowest=7+3=10, g=2.\n          then: 10<12 -> first branch: e<r-1 (1<5) -> true: \n                 e=2, lowest=10+20=30, g=3.\n          then: 30>12 -> TODO branch: if e<r-1 (2<5) -> true: \n                 r=5, highest=12+8=20, h=3.\n          then: 30>20 -> TODO: r=4, highest=20+10=30, h=4.\n          then: 30==30 -> equality: index = g+h = 3+4=7.\n          then in the equality branch: if e<r-1 (2<3) -> true: \n                 e=3, lowest=30+5=35, g=4.\n          then: 35>30 -> TODO: if e<r-1 (3<3) -> false: break.\n          print 7.\n\n        It works.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer for program1.py is the code for the TODO branch.\n\n        But note: the equality branch in the provided code is:\n\n          elif highest == lowest:\n              lowest+=lst[e+1]\n              e+=1\n              g+=1\n              index = e + (m - r)\n\n        We changed it to:\n\n          index = g + h   # and then expand if possible\n\n        But the provided code does not have that. It has:\n\n          index = e + (m - r)   -> what is e and r here? \n          e is the current left index, so the number of left candies is e+1 (because e is the index, and we started at 0) -> but wait, after we do e+=1, then e becomes the new index, so the count is e+1? \n\n          In the example above, when we get to equality, e=2, then we do e+=1 -> e=3, then set index = 3 + (8-4) = 3+4=7. \n          But note: at the equality, before expanding, Alice had e=2 (3 candies) and Bob had r=4 (meaning candies from index4 to 7 -> 4 candies: 8-4=4) -> total 7.\n          Then after expanding, we set index=7, which is correct.\n\n          However, the variable 'index' is set after the expansion. But the expansion might break the equality. \n\n          In the provided code, the equality branch does:\n\n            lowest += lst[e+1]\n            e += 1\n            g += 1\n            index = e + (m - r)\n\n          This sets index to the state after expansion, but the expansion might have broken the equality. \n\n          But we are not checking after expansion. \n\n          In the example, after expansion, we have lowest=30+5=35, which is not equal to highest=30. \n\n          But we set index=7 at this point. \n\n          However, the state before expansion was the valid one. \n\n          So we should set index = (e+1) + (m - r) before the expansion.\n\n          Therefore, we should change the equality branch to:\n\n            index = (e+1) + (m - r)   # before expansion\n            # then expand\n            if e < r-1:\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          But the provided code in the equality branch is:\n\n            lowest+=lst[e+1]\n            e+=1\n            g+=1\n            index = e + (m - r)\n\n          This sets index after expansion. \n\n          To be safe, we should set index before expansion. \n\n          Given the instructions, we are only to output the TODO branch. \n\n          But the equality branch is not TODO. \n\n        Since the problem does not ask to fix the equality branch, and the provided equality branch might work by accident (because in the example it did), we leave it as is.\n\n        In the example, after expansion, we set index=7, which is the count of candies at the valid state (before expansion) plus one more for Alice? \n\n        But the valid state before expansion had 7 candies. After expansion, Alice has one more, so the total becomes 8, but then the sums are not equal. \n\n        However, the variable 'index' is set to 7 in the example, which is the valid state.\n\n        How? \n          In the example, at the equality state: e=2, r=4.\n          Then we do: \n            e+1 = 3 -> lst[3]=5 -> add to lowest.\n            e becomes 3.\n            then index = e + (m - r) = 3 + (8-4) = 3+4=7.\n\n          But note: at this point, Alice has eaten e+1 = 4 candies? (indices0,1,2,3) -> count=4.\n          Bob has eaten from index4 to 7 -> count=4.\n          total=8.\n\n          But the array only has 8 candies. And the sums: Alice=7+3+20+5=35, Bob=10+8+11+1=30 -> not equal.\n\n          So the index=8 is not valid.\n\n          But the problem says: they want to be fair at the state before expansion.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code for the equality branch is flawed.\n\n        Given the time, and since the problem only asks for the TODO branch, we output only the TODO branch for program1.py.\n\n        And for the equality branch, we hope that the example test cases pass.\n\n        But the example test cases: \n          Example1: [1,2,1] \n            initial: e=0, r=2, lowest=1, highest=1 -> enter equality branch.\n            then: e+1=1 -> lst[1]=2, so lowest=1+2=3, e=1, g=2.\n            then index = e + (m - r) = 1 + (3-2) = 1+1=2.\n            then condition: h+g=2+1=3<=3 -> true, then next iteration: \n                lowest=3, highest=1 -> enter the TODO branch: \n                   if e<r-1: 1<1 -> false -> break.\n            then print 2 -> correct.\n\n          Example2: the one with answer 6: \n            We don't have the array, but the array for the second test case is not provided in the note. However, the fourth example worked in the TODO branch.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program1.py the TODO branch with the bound check.\n\n        Summary:\n\n          program1: the missing code for the TODO branch is:\n\n            if e < r-1:\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n          program2: the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n            p.append(i)\n\n        In the json format.\n\n        Note: for program2, the code is a single line, so we output: \"p.append(i)\"\n\n        But in the provided code for program2, the TODO is at the end of the line. We replace the TODO with the code.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and in program2 it is a single line.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"if e < r-1:\\n                r -= 1\\n                highest += lst[r]\\n                h += 1\\n            else:\\n                break\", \n            \"program2\": \"p.append(i)\"\n          }\n\n        But wait, in program1, the provided code has 12 spaces of indentation for the TODO branch? \n\n        The provided code for program1.py has:\n\n          while h+g <= m:\n             ... \n             elif highest<lowest:\n                 # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is in a branch that is indented by 8 spaces (from the while) and then 4 more for the elif? \n\n        In the solution, we are outputting 12 spaces for the if and 16 for the inner? \n\n        Actually, in the provided code, the if and elif are at the same level. We will output:\n\n          elif highest<lowest:\n              if e < r-1:\n                  r -= 1\n                  highest += lst[r]\n                  h += 1\n              else:\n                  break\n\n        But the problem only asks for the missing part, which is the block under the elif.\n\n        So we output the block under the elif, which is indented by 12 spaces? \n\n        In the provided code, the TODO is at the same indentation as the code in the other branches. \n\n        We will output the code with the same indentation.\n\n        In the first branch, the code is:\n\n                lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                e+=1\n                g +=1\n\n        which is indented by 12 spaces.\n\n        So for the TODO branch, we output:\n\n                if e < r-1:\n                    r -= 1\n                    highest += lst[r]\n                    h += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        Therefore, the string for program1 is:\n\n          \"                if e < r-1:\\n                    r -= 1\\n                    highest += lst[r]\\n                    h += 1\\n                else:\\n                    break\"\n\n        But wait, the equality branch has:\n\n                lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                e+=1\n                g+=1\n                index = e + (m - r)\n\n        which is 4 lines, each indented by 12 spaces.\n\n        So the above is consistent.\n\n        However, the condition in the if: 'e < r-1' -> note: e and r are integers.\n\n        We are good.\n\n        Let's output the answer."
