    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe have t test cases. For each test case, we are given n, m and a list a of n integers.\nWe must decide if it is possible to seat all n people on a circle of m chairs such that for the i-th person, there are at least a[i] empty chairs on both the left and the right (so the person occupies one chair and requires a[i] empty chairs on each side, meaning a total of 2*a[i] + 1 chairs per person, but note that the circle might allow sharing of empty spaces if arranged properly).\n\nHowever, note that the problem is about arranging in a circle and the constraints are large (m up to 10^9, n up to 10^5, but total n over test cases <= 10^5).\n\nApproach for program1:\n1. Since the circle is symmetric, we can think of the problem as requiring that the chairs occupied by people are at least a certain distance apart. But note that the condition for a person sitting at j is that the segment [j - a[i], j + a[i]] (mod m) is free of other people. This is a very strong condition: each person requires a contiguous block of 2*a[i]+1 chairs that are free (with wrap-around). However, note that the circle might break the contiguity.\n\nBut note: the problem says that if the i-th person sits at j, then the chairs (j - a[i]) mod m, (j - a[i] + 1) mod m, ... (j + a[i]) mod m must be free. This is a contiguous block of 2*a[i] + 1 chairs. However, because of the circle, if the block wraps around, it is still contiguous.\n\nThe key observation: \n- We cannot have two people because the circle might be broken by the wrap, but note that the condition is very strong: each person requires a contiguous free segment of length 2*a[i]+1.\n\nHowever, note that the problem is known to be solved by the following:\n  Sort the array a in descending order (so the most demanding person first).\n  The idea: the most demanding person will break the circle and then we can treat the circle as a line? But note that the circle has no beginning.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the total space required by the people must be at least the sum of their individual requirements? But note that the empty spaces can be shared. However, the condition is that each person must have a contiguous block of 2*a[i]+1. But if we place the people, the entire circle must be covered by these blocks? Actually, the blocks can overlap? But note: the condition says that the block for a person must be free of other people. However, the block does not necessarily have to be free of other blocks? Actually, the block must be free of other people, meaning that the same chair cannot be used by two people, but also that the same chair might be part of the empty space for two people? The problem states: \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\", meaning that the block is exclusive for that person? Actually, the block is the set of chairs that must be free (so no other person can sit in that block). Therefore, the blocks for two different people must be disjoint.\n\nBut note: the block for a person includes the chair they are sitting in and the a[i] chairs to the left and right. Therefore, the entire circle must be partitioned into disjoint blocks? Not exactly: the blocks might not cover the entire circle, but they must be disjoint.\n\nTherefore, the total space required is at least the sum of (2*a[i] + 1) for all i? However, because the circle is circular, we have to be cautious: the blocks might wrap and also the circle might have the last block and the first block adjacent.\n\nBut note: the condition does not require that the entire circle is covered by blocks, only that the blocks are disjoint and each block is of length 2*a[i]+1. Therefore, the total space required is at least the sum of (2*a[i] + 1) for all i? However, that might be too much because the blocks might be arranged to share the gaps? Actually, no: the blocks are disjoint. Therefore, we must have:\n  sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (2*a[i] + 1) <= m   ??? \n\nBut wait: consider two people. They require two blocks. However, if the circle is large enough, we can place them far apart. But the blocks must be disjoint. So the total length of the circle must be at least the sum of the lengths of the blocks? However, note that the circle is continuous and the blocks are contiguous. But the circle is one-dimensional and the blocks are disjoint contiguous segments. Therefore, the total length of the circle must be at least the sum of the lengths of the blocks? Actually, that is true for a line, but for a circle? The circle is topologically the same as a line with the ends connected. The sum of the lengths of disjoint contiguous segments in a circle can be at most the circle length. Therefore, we must have:\n  sum_i (2*a[i] + 1) <= m   ... (1)\n\nBut is that sufficient? Not exactly: consider the example test case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1]. Then the total required is (2*1+1) + (2*1+1) = 3+3 = 6, which is greater than 5. But the answer is \"YES\". So condition (1) is too strong.\n\nWhy? Because the blocks can overlap in the circle? But we said they must be disjoint. Actually, in the example, the two blocks do not cover the entire circle? And they are not overlapping? How are they arranged?\n\nIn test case 2: \n  The circle has chairs 0,1,2,3,4.\n  Suppose person1 sits at chair2: then the block is [1,2,3] (because 2-1=1, 2+1=3, and mod5: 1,2,3).\n  Person2 sits at chair0: then the block is [4,0,1] (because 0-1 = -1 mod5 = 4, and 0+1=1 -> so chairs 4,0,1).\n\nBut now we see that chair1 is in both blocks? That violates the condition. However, note the problem says: \"no one else should sit in the following chairs\". So chair1 must be free for both? But that is allowed as long as no one sits there. However, the problem is that the same chair can be part of the empty space for two people. Therefore, the blocks are allowed to overlap? Actually, the condition only says that no other person sits in that chair. So if a chair is required to be empty by two people, that is acceptable. Therefore, the blocks are not necessarily disjoint? They can share empty chairs.\n\nBut then what is the constraint? \n  Each person requires a contiguous block of 2*a[i]+1 chairs that are free (meaning no other person sits in that block). However, the same empty chair can be part of multiple blocks. Therefore, the total circle must be covered by the union of the blocks? And the blocks might overlap.\n\nBut note: the person sits in the center of the block. The condition does not require that the entire block is exclusively for that person? It only requires that no other person sits in that block. But if two blocks share an empty chair, that is acceptable because that chair remains empty. However, the problem is that the block for person i must be free of other people, meaning that no other person sits in that block. But if two blocks share an empty chair, that chair is not occupied by any person, so it is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the constraint is not the sum of the block lengths. Instead, we must arrange the people so that the entire circle can be covered by the union of the blocks? And the blocks must be arranged so that the center of each block (the person) is not inside the block of another? Actually, the condition for a person is that the entire block must be free of other people. This means that the center of any other person must not lie in the block of this person. Therefore, the centers (the chairs where people sit) must be at least (a[i] + a[j] + 1) apart? Because if two people are too close, then the center of one might fall in the block of the other.\n\nBut note: the block of person i extends a[i] to the left and a[i] to the right. So if person j sits within a[i] to the left or right of person i, then person j's center is in the block of person i? That is not allowed. Therefore, the minimal distance between two people i and j must be at least max(a[i], a[j]) + 1? Actually, no: if person i is at x and person j is at y, then we require that y is not in [x - a[i], x + a[i]] (mod m). Therefore, the distance between x and y must be at least a[i] + 1 (in the circular sense). Similarly, the distance must be at least a[j] + 1? Actually, we require both: \n  dist(x,y) >= a[i] + 1   and   dist(x,y) >= a[j] + 1.\n\nBut note: the circle distance: the minimal distance along the circle. The circle distance between x and y is min(|x-y|, m - |x-y|). However, the condition is that the entire segment [x - a[i], x + a[i]] must not contain y. The segment is contiguous and of length 2*a[i]+1. The condition that y is not in that segment is equivalent to the circular distance between x and y being at least a[i] + 1? Actually, no: because the segment wraps. The condition is that y must be at least a[i]+1 away in the circular sense? Actually, the condition is that the entire segment of 2*a[i]+1 consecutive chairs (including the center) must be free of other people. Therefore, the next person must be at least a[i] + 1 chairs away (in one direction) and then the other direction as well? But the circle is symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, we can break the circle by the most demanding person. Sort the a in descending order. Let the sorted array be b[0] >= b[1] >= ... >= b[n-1]. Then we can place the most demanding person at position 0. Then the next person must be at least at position b[0] + 1 (to avoid the block [0 - b[0], 0 + b[0]] = [-b[0], b[0]] mod m). Then the next person must be at least at position (b[0] + 1) + (b[1] + 1) and so on? But note that the circle wraps, so we also have to account for the gap from the last person to the first.\n\nActually, we can model the arrangement as: we break the circle at the most demanding person and then we have a line. Then we require that the total length of the circle is at least the sum of the gaps we need to leave between consecutive people (in the broken line) and also the gap from the last person back to the first.\n\nSpecifically, if we break the circle at the most demanding person (say person0 with a0 = b[0]), then we have a segment from 0 to m-1. We place person0 at 0. Then the next person (person1) must be at least at position b[0] + 1 + b[1] + 1? Actually, the minimal distance between person0 and person1 must be at least b[0] + 1 (to avoid the block of person0) and also at least b[1] + 1 (to avoid the block of person1). But note: the block of person0 extends from -b[0] to b[0] mod m. Since we broke the circle at 0, we can consider the next person must be at least at position b[0] + 1. Then the block for person1 will extend from (b[0]+1) - b[1] to (b[0]+1) + b[1]. We require that this block does not include the next person (person2) and also does not include person0? The distance from person1 to person0 is b[0]+1, which is greater than b[1]? Not necessarily: if b[1] > b[0], then the block of person1 would extend to the left beyond 0? But we sorted in descending order, so b[0] >= b[1]. Therefore, the block of person1 does not reach back to 0 because the distance from person1 to 0 is b[0]+1, and the block of person1 extends to the left by b[1] (which is <= b[0]), so the left end of person1's block is (b[0]+1 - b[1]) >= 1 (since b[0]>=b[1] and then +1). So it doesn't include 0.\n\nThen the next person (person2) must be at least at position (b[0]+1) + (b[1]+1). Why? Because the gap between person0 and person1 is at least b[0]+1 (from 0 to b[0]+1) and then the gap between person1 and person2 must be at least b[1]+1? Actually, the minimal distance between person1 and person2 must be at least max(b[1]+1, b[2]+1)? But note: we require that the block of person1 does not contain person2 and the block of person2 does not contain person1. The minimal distance to avoid both is max(b[1]+1, b[2]+1) = b[1]+1 (since we sorted descending). Therefore, we can place person2 at (b[0]+1) + (b[1]+1). Then the next at (b[0]+1) + (b[1]+1) + (b[2]+1), and so on.\n\nBut then we have to close the circle: the last person (say person k) must be placed at position x, and then the distance from x to the first person (0) must be at least (b[k] + 1) and also at least (b[0] + 1). However, the distance from x to 0 is m - x. And we have x = (b[0]+1) + (b[1]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1) for the last but one? Actually, we have n people. We placed the first at 0, then the next at (b[0]+1), then the next at (b[0]+1)+(b[1]+1), ... and the last at (b[0]+1)+(b[1]+1)+...+(b[n-2]+1). Then the gap from the last person to the first person is m - [ (b[0]+1) + (b[1]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1) ].\n\nBut the last person (the n-th) is at that position. The condition for the last person: the block extends from (position - b[n-1]) to (position + b[n-1]). We require that this block does not include the first person (0) and the next person (the one at (b[0]+1))? The distance from the last person to the first person must be at least b[n-1]+1 and also at least b[0]+1? Actually, the condition for the last person and the first person: the circular distance must be at least max(b[0]+1, b[n-1]+1) = b[0]+1 (since b[0] is the largest). Therefore, we require:\n  m - [ (b[0]+1) + (b[1]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1) ] >= b[0] + 1   ... (2)\n\nBut note: the last person also requires a gap of b[n-1]+1 to the next person (which is the first person). However, the condition (2) ensures that the gap from the last person to the first person is at least b[0]+1, which is at least b[n-1]+1 (since b[0]>=b[n-1]). Therefore, condition (2) is sufficient.\n\nBut wait: we have not accounted for the gap between the last person and the first person? Actually, the entire circle must be covered: the gaps we have are:\n  from 0 to the next person: at least b[0]+1 (but we used exactly b[0]+1 for the next person? Actually, we placed the next person at b[0]+1, so the gap from 0 to that person is exactly b[0]+1, which is sufficient for the block of the first person: [0-b[0], 0+b[0]] = [ -b[0], b[0] ] mod m. Since the next person is at b[0]+1, that is outside the block.\n\nSimilarly, the gap between the first person and the last person (going the other way) is m - (the total of the positions of the last person). We require that this gap is at least the maximum of (b[0]+1, b[n-1]+1) = b[0]+1.\n\nTherefore, the condition becomes:\n  Let b = sorted(a, reverse=True)\n  total_gap = (b[0] + 1)   # for the first gap (from the first person to the next)\n              + (b[1] + 1) # for the next gap\n              + ... \n              + (b[n-1] + 1)   # but wait, we have n gaps? \n\nActually, we have n gaps: \n  gap0: from the first person (at 0) to the next person: at least max(b[0]+1, b[1]+1) = b[0]+1? But we are using the sorted order and we are going to assign the gaps in the order of the sorted array. However, note that we have n people and we break the circle, so we have n gaps: the gaps between consecutive people (in the broken circle) and the gap from the last person back to the first.\n\nBut in our arrangement, we placed the first person at 0, then the next at (b[0]+1), then the next at (b[0]+1)+(b[1]+1), ... and the last at (b[0]+1)+...+(b[n-2]+1). Then the gap from the last person to the first person is m - [ (b[0]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1) ].\n\nNow, the last person (the one at the last position) requires a gap of at least b[n-1]+1 to the next person (which is the first person). But we also have the first person requiring a gap of at least b[0]+1 to the last person? Actually, the condition for the first person: the block extends from -b[0] to b[0]. The last person is at position x = (b[0]+1)+...+(b[n-2]+1). We require that the last person is not in the block of the first person. The block of the first person is [0-b[0], 0+b[0]] = [m-b[0], b[0]] (if we consider mod m, but we broke the circle at 0 so we are in the segment [0, m-1]). The last person is at x, which is at least (b[0]+1) (if n>=2) and then we add more, so x>=b[0]+1, which is greater than b[0]. Therefore, the last person is not in the block of the first person.\n\nBut the gap from the last person to the first person (going the other way) is the segment from x to m-1 and then 0. The length of that gap is m - x. We require that the block of the last person (which extends from x - b[n-1] to x + b[n-1]) does not include the first person? The first person is at 0. So we require that 0 is not in [x - b[n-1], x + b[n-1]] mod m. Since we broke the circle at 0, we are considering the segment [0, m-1]. The block of the last person is [x - b[n-1], x + b[n-1]]. We require that 0 is not in that segment? But 0 is at the beginning. The segment [x - b[n-1], x + b[n-1]] might wrap? Actually, if x + b[n-1] >= m, then the block wraps and covers [x - b[n-1], m-1] and [0, (x+b[n-1]) mod m]. To avoid 0, we require that the wrap-around part does not include 0? Actually, the condition is that the circular distance from x to 0 must be at least b[n-1]+1. The circular distance from x to 0 is min(x, m - x). But note: we have x = (b[0]+1)+...+(b[n-2]+1). Since we broke the circle at 0, the direct distance from x to 0 is x (if we go backwards) and m - x (if we go forwards). But the block of the last person extends backwards from x by b[n-1] and forwards by b[n-1]. The forward part goes to x+b[n-1] (which might be beyond m-1, so we wrap). The backward part goes to x - b[n-1]. We require that 0 is not in the block. The block in the circle is the union of [x - b[n-1], x + b[n-1]] (if no wrap) or if it wraps, then [x - b[n-1], m-1] and [0, (x+b[n-1]) mod m]. To avoid 0, we require that the wrap-around part does not include 0? Actually, if the block wraps, then the part that goes from 0 to (x+b[n-1]) mod m must not include 0? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, we can avoid wrap by requiring that the entire block is in [0, m-1] and then 0 is not in the block? But if x - b[n-1] >=0, then the block is entirely in [0, m-1] and we require 0 < x - b[n-1]? That is, x - b[n-1] > 0? But that is not necessary because the block might end at x - b[n-1] which is positive. However, if x - b[n-1] is negative, then the block wraps and covers [0, x+b[n-1]-m]? Actually, the block covers [x - b[n-1] mod m, ... , x+b[n-1] mod m]. To avoid 0, we require that 0 is not in that contiguous segment. The segment that wraps is from x - b[n-1] (negative) to x+b[n-1] (which mod m is x+b[n-1]-m). The condition for 0 to be avoided is that the wrap-around part does not extend to 0? Actually, the segment in the circle that includes 0 is from x - b[n-1] (which is negative) to x+b[n-1] mod m. The condition is that the segment does not include 0? But 0 is in the segment if x - b[n-1] <= -1 and then the segment goes to x+b[n-1] mod m, which is positive? Actually, the segment is contiguous and wraps, so it includes 0 if the segment covers from a negative number to a positive number? Specifically, if x - b[n-1] <= -1, then the segment covers [0, x+b[n-1] mod m] and also [x - b[n-1] + m, m-1]. Therefore, 0 is included in the segment? Actually, no: the segment is [x - b[n-1] mod m, x+b[n-1] mod m]. When we have a negative index, we add m. So the segment becomes [x - b[n-1] + m, m-1] and [0, x+b[n-1] - m] (if x+b[n-1] >= m). But note: we require that 0 is not in the block. The block includes the segment [0, x+b[n-1]-m] if x+b[n-1] >= m. Therefore, to avoid 0, we must have x+b[n-1] < m? Then the block does not wrap? But then 0 is not in the block? Actually, if the block does not wrap, then the block is entirely in [0, m-1] and 0 is not in the interval [x - b[n-1], x+b[n-1]]? That is true if x - b[n-1] > 0. But if x - b[n-1] <= 0, then the block wraps and then the segment that includes 0 is [x - b[n-1] + m, m-1] and [0, x+b[n-1] mod m]. Then 0 is included? Actually, 0 is included in the block if the block wraps? Because the block covers [x - b[n-1] + m, m-1] and [0, x+b[n-1] - m] (if x+b[n-1] >= m). Therefore, to avoid 0, we require that the block does not wrap? Or if it wraps, then the part that starts at 0 is not covered? Actually, the condition is that the circular distance from x to 0 must be at least b[n-1]+1. The circular distance from x to 0 is min(x, m - x). But note: the block of the last person extends b[n-1] in both directions. Therefore, the condition is that the circular distance from x to 0 must be at least b[n-1]+1. Since we broke the circle at 0, the direct distance from x to 0 (going backwards) is x. The other way is m - x. The minimal circular distance is min(x, m-x). We require min(x, m-x) >= b[n-1]+1.\n\nBut note: we have x = (b[0]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1). And we require min(x, m-x) >= b[n-1]+1.\n\nHowever, we also have the condition for the first person: the block of the first person extends to the left to -b[0] mod m, which is m - b[0]. The last person is at x. We require that the last person is not in the block of the first person. The block of the first person is [m - b[0], m-1] and [0, b[0]]. The last person is at x, which is at least (b[0]+1) (if n>=2) so x>=b[0]+1, which is greater than b[0]. Therefore, the last person is not in the [0, b[0]] part. But what about the [m - b[0], m-1] part? The last person is at x, which is less than m (if we have arranged correctly). We require that x is not in [m - b[0], m-1]. Therefore, we require x < m - b[0]. \n\nBut note: we also have the condition for the last person: the circular distance from x to 0 must be at least b[n-1]+1. The circular distance going backwards is x, and going forwards is m - x. We require min(x, m-x) >= b[n-1]+1. But note that b[0] >= b[n-1], so if we have x < m - b[0], then m - x > b[0] >= b[n-1], so the forward distance is at least b[0] which is >= b[n-1], so the condition min(x, m-x) >= b[n-1]+1 is satisfied? Not necessarily: we require at least b[n-1]+1. Since m-x > b[0] >= b[n-1], we have m-x >= b[0]+1? Not necessarily: we only have m-x > b[0] (if x < m - b[0], then m-x > b[0]). But we need m-x >= b[n-1]+1. Since b[0] >= b[n-1], we have m-x > b[0] >= b[n-1], so m-x >= b[0]+1? Actually, no: if m-x is an integer, then m-x > b[0] implies m-x >= b[0]+1. Therefore, the condition min(x, m-x) >= b[n-1]+1 is satisfied because m-x >= b[0]+1 >= b[n-1]+1.\n\nTherefore, the only constraint we have from the last person to the first person is that the last person must not be in the block of the first person? And that is x < m - b[0]? But note: the block of the first person is [m - b[0], m-1] and [0, b[0]]. We have x>=b[0]+1 (so not in [0,b[0]]) and we require x < m - b[0] to avoid [m-b[0], m-1]. Therefore, we require:\n  x < m - b[0]   =>   (b[0]+1) + (b[1]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1) < m - b[0]\n\nBut note: we have n-1 terms so far? We have n people: the first person is at 0, then we placed n-1 people at positions that are the cumulative sum of (b[0]+1), (b[1]+1), ... (b[n-2]+1). Then the last person is the (n-1)-th in the sorted list? Actually, we have sorted the list of n elements. We have used the largest (b[0]) for the first person, and then the next n-1 largest? Then the last person is the smallest? Actually, we sorted in descending order: b[0]>=b[1]>=...>=b[n-1]. We placed the first person (b[0]) at 0, then the next (b[1]) at b[0]+1, then b[2] at b[0]+1+b[1]+1, ... and the last person (b[n-1]) at the cumulative sum of (b[0]+1) to (b[n-2]+1). Then we require that the cumulative sum (which we call S) is less than m - b[0]. \n\nBut wait: the last person is at S, and we require S < m - b[0]. Then the gap from the last person to the first person (going the long way) is m - S, which must be at least b[0]+1? Actually, we have m - S > b[0] (from S < m - b[0]), so m - S >= b[0]+1. And that is sufficient for the last person's block to avoid the first person? Actually, we have the block of the last person: [S - b[n-1], S + b[n-1]]. The forward part: S + b[n-1] <= (m - b[0] - 1) + b[n-1] < m - b[0] + b[n-1] <= m - 1? (if b[0]>=b[n-1] and b[0]>=1) -> not necessarily: we don't know. But we also have the condition that the block of the last person must not wrap to include 0? We have already ensured that the last person is not in the block of the first person? Actually, the condition for the last person's block to not include the first person is that the circular distance from S to 0 is at least b[n-1]+1. We have two distances: \n  going backwards: S (which is the distance from 0 to S along the broken circle) \n  going forwards: m - S.\n\nThe minimal circular distance is min(S, m-S). We require min(S, m-S) >= b[n-1]+1. But we have m-S >= b[0]+1 (from S < m - b[0]) and b[0]>=b[n-1] so m-S>=b[0]+1>=b[n-1]+1. And S is at least (b[0]+1) (if n>=2) and then we add more, so S>=b[0]+1>=b[n-1]+1. Therefore, min(S, m-S) >= min(b[0]+1, m-S) = b[0]+1? Actually, we don't know which is smaller. But note: we have S = (b[0]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1) and we have m-S > b[0]. Therefore, min(S, m-S) is at least min(b[0]+1, b[0]+1) = b[0]+1? Actually, we don't know if S is less than m-S. But we have m-S > b[0] and S >= b[0]+1 (if n>=2). Therefore, min(S, m-S) is at least min(b[0]+1, b[0]+1) = b[0]+1? Actually, if n==1, then we have no other person? Then we require the entire circle must be at least 2*b[0]+1? But the problem states n>=2.\n\nBut note: the problem says n>=2. So we can assume n>=2.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the entire arrangement is:\n  S = (b[0]+1) + (b[1]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1)   [for the first n-1 people? Actually, we have placed n-1 people after the first? But we have n people: the first person (b[0]) and then n-1 others. The last of the n-1 others is the n-th person? Actually, we have placed the first person at 0, then the second at b[0]+1, the third at b[0]+1+b[1]+1, ... and the n-th at S = (b[0]+1) + ... + (b[n-2]+1). Then we require:\n      S < m - b[0]   ... (3)\n\nBut wait: what about the last person's own block? The last person is at S, and requires a block of 2*b[n-1]+1 chairs. But we have already ensured that the gap from the last person to the next (which is the first person) is m - S, which is at least b[0]+1, and the gap to the previous person (the one at S - (b[n-2]+1)) is at least b[n-2]+1 (which is >= b[n-1]+1 because we sorted descending). Therefore, the last person's block is satisfied? Actually, the block of the last person must be free of other people. The previous person is at S - (b[n-2]+1). The distance between the last person and the previous person is (b[n-2]+1). We require that the previous person is not in the block of the last person? The block of the last person extends from S - b[n-1] to S + b[n-1]. The previous person is at S - (b[n-2]+1). We require:\n      S - (b[n-2]+1) <= S - b[n-1] - 1   ? \n      => b[n-2]+1 >= b[n-1]+1   => b[n-2] >= b[n-1] which is true.\n\nTherefore, the condition (3) is sufficient? \n\nBut what if n==1? Then we have only one person. Then we break the circle and we have no other person. Then we require that the entire circle has at least 2*b[0]+1 chairs? That is, m>=2*b[0]+1. But condition (3) for n==1: we have no terms in S? So S=0. Then condition (3): 0 < m - b[0] -> m > b[0]. But we require m>=2*b[0]+1. Therefore, condition (3) is not sufficient for n==1.\n\nBut the problem states n>=2. So we don't have to worry about n==1? Actually, the input specification says n>=2. So we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm for one test case:\n  Read n, m and list a of n integers.\n  If n > m: then we cannot seat because each person requires at least 1 chair (so total chairs needed at least n, but m < n) -> \"NO\"\n  Otherwise, sort a in descending order (so a[0] is the largest).\n  Let S = 0\n  For i in range(n-1):   # we are going to add the gaps for the next n-1 people (the first person is fixed at 0, then we add n-1 gaps for the next n-1 people)\n        S += (a[i] + 1)   # but wait: we only have n-1 gaps? Actually, we have n-1 gaps for the n-1 people after the first. However, note that the gap for the i-th person (in the sorted list) is a[i]+1? But we are adding the gaps for the first n-1 in the sorted list (excluding the last one?).\n\n  Actually, we have the first person (a[0]) and then we place the next person (a[1]) at a[0]+1, then the next (a[2]) at a[0]+1+a[1]+1, ... and the last person (a[n-1]) at S = (a[0]+1) + (a[1]+1) + ... + (a[n-2]+1). Therefore, we are adding the gaps for the first n-1 people? But the last person (a[n-1]) is placed at S, and we do not add a gap for the last person? Actually, the gap for the last person is accounted for in the condition (3) (the gap from the last person to the first person must be at least a[0]+1, which is provided by m - S > a[0] -> m - S >= a[0]+1).\n\n  Therefore, we compute:\n      S = (a[0] + 1)   # for the first gap (from the first person to the second) \n            + (a[1] + 1)   # for the gap from the second to the third\n            + ... \n            + (a[n-2] + 1)   # for the gap from the (n-1)-th to the n-th person.\n\n  Then we check: if S + a[n-1] + 1 <= m? \n      But wait: condition (3) is S < m - a[0] -> S + a[0] < m.\n\n  However, note: the last person requires a block that extends a[n-1] to the right. The block of the last person goes from S - a[n-1] to S + a[n-1]. We require that the entire block is within the circle? Actually, we don't require that, but we require that the block does not include the first person. We have already ensured that the gap from the last person to the first person (the long way) is at least a[0]+1, which is sufficient. But we also require that the block does not extend beyond the circle? The circle has m chairs. The block is contiguous and of length 2*a[n-1]+1. The circle can accommodate it as long as the entire block is contained in the circle? Actually, the circle is circular, so the block is always contained? The issue is only the overlap with other people's blocks and the first person. We have already taken care of the first person. The previous person is at S - (a[n-2]+1). The distance from the last person to the previous person is a[n-2]+1, which is at least a[n-1]+1 (because a is sorted descending) so the previous person is not in the block of the last person.\n\n  Therefore, the condition is only (3): S + a[0] < m.\n\n  But wait: what if the last person's block extends beyond m? Then it wraps. But we have already considered the wrap in the condition for the first person? Actually, we broke the circle at the first person, so we are representing the circle as the segment [0, m-1]. The last person is at S, which is less than m (because S < m - a[0] and a[0]>=1). Then the block of the last person is [S - a[n-1], S + a[n-1]]. We require that S + a[n-1] < m? Not necessarily: it can wrap. But if it wraps, then the block covers [S - a[n-1], m-1] and [0, (S+a[n-1]) mod m]. The condition for the first person is that the first person (at 0) is not in the block. We have ensured that the circular distance from S to 0 is at least a[0]+1, which is at least a[n-1]+1, so 0 is not in the block. Therefore, we don't require S + a[n-1] < m.\n\n  Therefore, the condition is only: S < m - a[0]   ->   S + a[0] < m.\n\n  But note: we have not used a[n-1] in the condition? Actually, the last person's own requirement is automatically satisfied by the gaps we left? The gap to the previous person is a[n-2]+1 (which is >= a[n-1]+1) and the gap to the next person (the first person) is m - S, which is at least a[0]+1 (>= a[n-1]+1). Therefore, the block of the last person is free.\n\n  Therefore, the algorithm for one test case:\n      if n > m: \n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          sort a in descending order\n          S = 0\n          # we are going to add the gaps for the first n-1 people (the ones that come after the first person)\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              S += a[i] + 1\n          if S + a[0] < m:   # condition: S < m - a[0] -> S + a[0] < m\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait: what if the first person is the one with the largest requirement, and then we add the gaps for the next n-1 people? But note: the first person is at 0, and then we place the next person at a[0]+1, then the next at a[0]+1+a[1]+1, etc. The condition S + a[0] < m is the same as the cumulative gap for the n-1 people plus the gap for the first person's own requirement? Actually, the first person's own requirement is not added in S? But the condition for the first person is that the next person must be at least a[0]+1 away. That gap is included in S: the first term of S is a[0]+1.\n\n  Example test case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1] -> sorted descending: [1,1]\n      S = 0\n      for i in range(1):   # n-1 = 1\n          S += a[0] + 1 = 1+1 = 2\n      then condition: S + a[0] = 2 + 1 = 3 < 5 -> YES -> correct.\n\n  Example test case 3: n=2, m=5, a=[2,1] -> sorted descending: [2,1]\n      S = 0\n      for i in range(1): \n          S += 2+1 = 3\n      condition: 3+2 = 5 < 5? -> no -> NO -> correct.\n\n  Example test case 4: n=3, m=10, a=[2,2,1] -> sorted: [2,2,1]\n      S = (2+1) + (2+1) = 3+3 = 6\n      condition: 6+2 = 8 < 10 -> YES.\n\n  But the example test case 4 in the problem: n=3, m=10, a=[2,1,1] -> sorted: [2,1,1]\n      S = (2+1) + (1+1) = 3+2 = 5\n      condition: 5+2 = 7 < 10 -> YES.\n\n  However, the example test case 4 in the problem says: they can sit in chairs 1,4,7. \n      For the person at 1: a[0]=2 -> requires [1-2,1+2] mod10 = [9,10,0,1,2,3] -> that is 9,0,1,2,3? Actually, the circle: \n          chairs: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n          person at 1: requires chairs (1-2) mod10 = 9, (1-1)=0, 1, 2, 3 -> so chairs 9,0,1,2,3 must be free of other people? But there is a person at 4 and 7? They are not in that block? \n          person at 4: a[1]=1 -> requires [3,4,5] -> free? \n          person at 7: a[2]=1 -> requires [6,7,8] -> free? \n      But note: the block for the person at 1 includes chair 9,0,1,2,3. The person at 4 is at 4 -> not in the block. The person at 7 is at 7 -> not in the block. \n      However, the block for the person at 1 includes chair 0? But the problem says the chairs are numbered 0 to m-1. The block for the person at 1: \n          (1-2) mod10 = 9, (1-2+1)=0, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3 -> so chairs 9,0,1,2,3. \n      The person at 4 is at 4 -> not in the block. The person at 7 is at 7 -> not in the block. \n      But the block for the person at 1 includes chair 0? Then the person at 7 is at 7, but what about the block for the person at 7? It includes 6,7,8. The person at 1 is at 1 -> not in the block. \n      However, the block for the person at 1 includes chair 0? Then the person at 0? There is no person at 0. The block for the person at 1 requires that no other person sits in chairs 9,0,1,2,3. The person at 4 is at 4 -> not in that block. The person at 7 is at 7 -> not in that block. \n      Therefore, it is valid.\n\n  But our algorithm: \n      sorted a: [2,1,1] -> then S = (2+1) + (1+1) = 3+2=5, then condition: 5+2=7<10 -> YES.\n\n  Example test case 3 in the problem: n=2, m=5, a=[2,1] -> sorted: [2,1] -> S = (2+1)=3, condition: 3+2=5<5 -> false -> NO -> correct.\n\n  But what about the example test case 1: n>m -> we output \"NO\". \n\n  However, note: what if the condition S + a[0] < m is not satisfied, but we can arrange the people in a different order? We sorted in descending order. Why is that the best? Because the most demanding person requires the largest gap, so we break the circle at the most demanding person and then the next most demanding person is placed as close as possible? This minimizes the total gap used.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1.py:\n\n      I=lambda:[*map(int,input().split())]\n      t,=I()\n      while t:\n          t -= 1\n          data = I()\n          n = data[0]\n          m = data[1]\n          a = I()\n          if n > m:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              continue\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          # We break the circle with the largest requirement\n          # We need to account for the gaps for the next n-1 people\n          total_gap = 0\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              total_gap += a[i] + 1\n          # Now add the condition for the last person: we need the gap from the last person to the first person to be at least a[0]+1, which is provided by m - total_gap >= a[0]+1 -> total_gap + a[0] < m\n          if total_gap + a[0] < m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n  But wait: what if n==0? Then we skip the loop and then we do total_gap=0, then condition: 0+a[0] (but a[0] is undefined). But n>=2.\n\n  However, note: what if n==1? The problem says n>=2, so we don't have to worry.\n\n  But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do a loop over n-1 for each test case.\n\n  Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n  Example test case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1] -> sorted: [1,1] -> total_gap = a[0]+1 = 1+1=2; then condition: 2+1=3<5 -> YES -> correct.\n\n  Example test case 3: n=2, m=5, a=[2,1] -> sorted: [2,1] -> total_gap = 2+1=3; condition: 3+2=5<5? -> no -> NO -> correct.\n\n  Example test case 4: n=3, m=10, a=[2,1,1] -> sorted: [2,1,1] -> total_gap = (2+1) + (1+1) = 3+2=5; condition: 5+2=7<10 -> YES -> correct.\n\n  But what about the example test case 4 in the problem: they sit at 1,4,7. How does our model map? \n      We break the circle at the largest requirement (a[0]=2) and place that person at 0? But in the example, the person with a=2 sits at 1? \n\n  Why did we break the circle at the largest requirement? We assumed we place the largest requirement at 0. But we can rotate the circle arbitrarily. Therefore, the relative positions are what matter.\n\n  Therefore, the model is valid.\n\n  However, note: what if the largest requirement is not the first one we break? Actually, we break arbitrarily at the largest requirement. The circle is symmetric.\n\n  But what if we break at a different person? The problem does not require a particular order. We are using the most demanding person to break the circle because it requires the largest gap, so it is the most constraining.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1.py is as above.\n\n  But note: the condition in the code: \n      if n > m: \n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          sort a descending\n          total_gap = 0\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              total_gap += a[i] + 1\n          if total_gap + a[0] < m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n  However, note: we are using a[0] (the largest) in the condition. But what if we break the circle at the largest, and then the next largest, etc.?\n\n  But wait: what if we have two people with the same large requirement? We break at one of them. The condition is the same.\n\n  Therefore, we output the above code for program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  Description: \n      We have a stamp that covers two adjacent cells and colors them as BR or RB. The stamp can be used multiple times on the same cell. We start with a white row (all 'W'). We can stamp any two adjacent cells (and the stamp must fit entirely). We are given a target string s of length n (characters: 'W', 'R', 'B').\n\n  We must decide if it is possible to achieve s.\n\n  Observations:\n      - A white cell 'W' can only be achieved if the cell is never stamped? Or if it is stamped an even number of times in a way that the colors cancel? But note: the stamp always colors two adjacent cells. And the stamp sets one cell to R and the other to B. There is no way to set a cell to white after it has been stamped? Actually, the problem says: \"each usage of the stamp recolors both cells that are under the stamp\". And the stamp sets the two cells to either (R,B) or (B,R). Therefore, once a cell is stamped, it becomes either R or B. To make it white again, we would have to reverse the process? But the stamp only sets to R and B. Therefore, a white cell must never be stamped.\n\n      - Therefore, the white cells in the target string must be untouched. Then the non-white cells (which form contiguous segments? but not necessarily) must be stamped. However, note that the stamp covers two adjacent cells. Therefore, we can only have contiguous segments of non-white cells of even length? Not exactly: because we can stamp overlapping. For example, to make a segment of length 1: we cannot because the stamp covers two cells. Therefore, we must have at least two non-white cells in a contiguous segment? But note: we can stamp multiple times. For example, to make \"RB\": stamp once. To make \"R\": we cannot. Similarly, to make \"BRB\": we can do by stamping the first two to get RB? and then stamp the last two to get RB? but then the middle cell gets stamped twice: first as R (if we stamp the first two as RB) and then as B (if we stamp the last two as BR) -> then the middle cell becomes B? So we get R (from the first stamp) then the second stamp: the second cell becomes B and the third becomes R -> so we get R, B, R -> \"RBR\". But we wanted \"BRB\". \n\n  Actually, the problem states that the stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell. Each stamping sets the two cells to the two colors. Therefore, the color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that covers it? But note: the stamping is not necessarily in order? Actually, we can choose any order. \n\n  Known solution for similar problems: \n      We can break the string by the white cells. Then each contiguous segment of non-white cells must be achievable by the stamp.\n\n      Conditions for a contiguous segment (without white):\n        - The segment must have at least one cell? But if the segment has length 1, then it is impossible: because the stamp covers two cells. Therefore, we require that the segment length is at least 2? Actually, we can cover a segment of length 1 by stamping a pair that includes that cell and an adjacent cell? But then the adjacent cell would also be colored. Therefore, we cannot have an isolated non-white cell. So each contiguous segment of non-white must have length at least 2.\n\n        - Additionally, the entire segment must be colorable by the stamp. Note that the stamp always sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. Therefore, the segment must be bipartite? But note: the stamping operations can be done in any order and multiple times. The key is: what are the necessary conditions?\n\n      Known insight: \n          Let's consider the possibility of a segment. We can think of the operations as assigning a parity: for example, if we assign an index i as even and i+1 as odd, then the stamp operation at [i, i+1] would set even to R and odd to B, or even to B and odd to R. But note: if we stamp again at [i, i+1], then we can flip the colors. Therefore, the color of a cell is determined by the net number of times it has been stamped as the first color (R) or the second (B) in the stamp? \n\n      Actually, we can model the problem as: \n          We have a graph where each cell is a node and each stamping operation is an edge between two adjacent nodes. The stamping operation flips the colors of the two nodes: \n              If we stamp [i, i+1] as RB, then:\n                  cell i: if it was W, then becomes R? But wait, the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors regardless of the previous state. Therefore, it is not a flip but an assignment.\n\n      Alternate known solution from similar Codeforces problems (e.g., Round 784, Div.4, problem E? or similar):\n\n          We break the string by 'W'. For each contiguous segment of non-white (only 'R' and 'B'):\n            - If the segment has length 1, then it's impossible -> return \"NO\".\n            - Additionally, we require that the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? Actually, no: consider a segment of two: \"RR\" -> is that possible?\n                  We can do: \n                    Start: WW\n                    Stamp the two as BR: then we get BR -> not RR.\n                    Or stamp as RB: then we get RB -> not RR.\n                    How to get RR? \n                      Step1: stamp the two as BR: then we have BR.\n                      Step2: stamp the same two as RB: then we have RB -> then we have RB, not RR.\n                    Step1: stamp the two as BR: then we have BR.\n                    Step2: stamp the two as BR again: then we have RB? \n                    Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we stamp the same pair twice, we get:\n                      First: BR -> then if we stamp again as BR: we get BR? because it sets the first to B and the second to R? \n                    But wait: the stamp can be applied as either BR or RB. \n                      If we stamp as BR: then we get B at the first and R at the second.\n                      Then if we stamp as RB: then we get R at the first and B at the second.\n                    Then we have RB, not RR.\n\n                    How about overlapping? \n                      We have three cells: i, i+1, i+2. \n                      We want to make the first two RR.\n                      Step1: stamp [i, i+1] as BR: then we have B, R, W.\n                      Step2: stamp [i+1, i+2] as RB: then we have B, R (from the first stamp) and then stamp [i+1, i+2]: sets i+1 to R and i+2 to B -> then we have B, R, B.\n                      Then we have B, R, B -> not RR.\n\n                    Therefore, it seems impossible to get two adjacent R's? \n\n            But note: the problem example: \n                Example 5: \"BRB\" -> possible? \n                Example 6: \"RBB\" -> possible.\n\n            Actually, the example 5: \"BRB\" (n=3) -> \n                Step1: stamp the middle and the last: so stamp [1,2] as RB -> then we have WW -> becomes WRB? \n                But we start with WWW. \n                Step1: stamp [1,2] as RB: then we have W, R, B -> \"WRB\".\n                Step2: stamp [0,1] as BR: then we set [0,1] to B and R -> so we have B, R, B -> \"BRB\".\n\n            How about two R's? \n                We want \"RR\" in two adjacent cells. \n                We can do:\n                  Start: WWW (we need at least two, but we can have an extra white that we don't touch? but we are only concerned with two adjacent cells)\n                  Step1: stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R, B, W -> \"RBW\"\n                  Step2: stamp [0,1] as BR: then we have B, R, W -> \"BRW\"\n                  Step3: stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R, B, W -> we are flipping? \n\n            It seems we cannot get two R's. \n\n            Insight: \n                The stamp always sets one cell to R and the other to B. Therefore, in any contiguous segment of non-white, the number of R's and B's must be such that it is possible? \n\n            Actually, we can note that the entire coloring must be consistent with an alternating pattern? Because each stamping operation sets two adjacent cells to two different colors. And if we stamp multiple times, the last stamp on a cell determines its color. But note: we can change the color of a cell by stamping it again with a different orientation? \n\n            However, consider: \n                Operation on [i, i+1]: \n                  If we do it once: then we have either (R,B) or (B,R) at (i, i+1).\n                If we do it again with the same orientation: then we set it again to the same.\n                If we do it again with the opposite orientation: then we set it to (B,R) if it was (R,B) and vice versa.\n\n            Therefore, we can achieve any coloring that is an alternating pattern? But note: we can also stamp overlapping segments arbitrarily. \n\n            Known solution from Codeforces problems (e.g., \"Stamp Coloring\"): \n                Break the string by 'W'. For each contiguous segment of R and B:\n                  - If the segment has length 1: impossible -> return \"NO\".\n                  - Else, check if the segment has at least one R and at least one B. If the segment is all R or all B, then it is impossible? \n\n            Why? \n                Because if we have a segment of length>=2 and all the same color, say all R, then how can we achieve that? \n                  Consider two adjacent R's: \n                    To set two adjacent cells to R, we would need to stamp them in a way that both become R. But the stamp always sets one to R and the other to B. Therefore, we cannot have two adjacent R's? \n                Actually, we can: \n                  Example: \"RR\" in a segment of two. \n                    We can do:\n                      Start: WW\n                      Stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R and B -> not RR.\n                      Then stamp [0,1] as BR: then we have B and R -> not RR.\n                      Then stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R and B -> we are flipping.\n\n                How about using three cells? \n                  We have a segment of two, but we can use an adjacent cell? But the segment is only two, and the adjacent cell is white? Then we cannot stamp the white cell.\n\n            Therefore, we cannot have a contiguous segment of non-white of length>=2 that is all the same color? \n\n            But wait: the example \"RBB\" (example 6) is possible. \n                Step1: stamp [1,2] as RB: then we have W, R, B -> \"WRB\"\n                Step2: stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R, B, B -> \"RBB\" -> wait, we have two B's at the end? \n                But step2: stamp [0,1] as RB: sets cell0 to R and cell1 to B. Then we have R, B, B. But the cell1 was R from step1, then we set it to B? and cell2 remains B? \n\n            How about \"RR\" in a segment of two? \n                We want cell0 and cell1 to be R.\n                We can do:\n                  Step1: stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R, B.\n                  Step2: stamp [0,1] as BR: then we have B, R.\n                  Step3: stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R, B.\n                We cannot get two R's.\n\n            Therefore, the condition for a contiguous segment of non-white is:\n                - The segment must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n            But what if the segment has more than two? \n                Example: \"RRB\" -> \n                  We want: R, R, B.\n                  How?\n                    Step1: stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R, B, W -> but we have three cells? \n                    Step2: stamp [1,2] as BR: then we have R, B (from step1) and then stamp [1,2]: sets cell1 to B and cell2 to R -> then we have R, B, R -> not RRB.\n\n                Step1: stamp [0,1] as RB: R, B, W.\n                Step2: stamp [0,1] as BR: then we have B, R, W.\n                Step3: stamp [1,2] as RB: then we have B, R, B -> not RRB.\n\n            How about:\n                Step1: stamp [1,2] as RB: then we have W, R, B.\n                Step2: stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R, B, B -> \"RBB\", which is example6.\n\n            How to get \"RRB\"? \n                We can do:\n                  Step1: stamp [0,1] as RB: R, B, W.\n                  Step2: stamp [0,1] as RB again: then we have R, B -> but then we set to R, B again? \n                  Step3: stamp [0,1] as BR: then we have B, R, W.\n                  Step4: stamp [0,1] as RB: then we have R, B, W.\n\n            It seems difficult.\n\n            Alternate known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round 784, problem E: 2-Letter Strings) or actually a recent one: \n\n            Solution for \"Stamp Coloring\" from a known contest (Codeforces Global Round 18, problem B) is:\n\n                #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                using namespace std;\n\n                void solve() {\n                    int n;\n                    cin >> n;\n                    string s;\n                    cin >> s;\n                    vector<string> v;\n                    string temp = \"\";\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        if (s[i] == 'W') {\n                            if (temp != \"\") {\n                                v.push_back(temp);\n                                temp = \"\";\n                            }\n                        } else {\n                            temp += s[i];\n                        }\n                    }\n                    if (temp != \"\") {\n                        v.push_back(temp);\n                    }\n                    for (string str : v) {\n                        if (str.length() == 1) {\n                            cout << \"NO\\n\";\n                            return;\n                        }\n                        bool hasR = false, hasB = false;\n                        for (char c : str) {\n                            if (c == 'R') hasR = true;\n                            else hasB = true;\n                        }\n                        if (!hasR || !hasB) {\n                            cout << \"NO\\n\";\n                            return;\n                        }\n                    }\n                    cout << \"YES\\n\";\n                }\n\n                int main() {\n                    int t;\n                    cin >> t;\n                    while (t--) {\n                        solve();\n                    }\n                }\n\n            Therefore, the solution is:\n                Break the string by 'W' into contiguous segments of non-white.\n                For each segment:\n                  - If the segment has length 1 -> \"NO\"\n                  - Else, if the segment does not contain at least one 'R' and at least one 'B' -> \"NO\"\n                If all segments are valid, then \"YES\".\n\n            Why is that?\n                Because if a segment has only R's, then we cannot achieve it: because the stamp always produces one R and one B in each operation. Therefore, the entire segment must have at least one B? Similarly, at least one R.\n\n            Let's test with the examples:\n\n                Example 1: \"BRB\" (n=3) -> break: one segment \"BRB\": \n                    has R and B -> valid.\n\n                Example 2: \"RBB\" (n=3) -> segment \"RBB\": has R and B -> valid.\n\n                Example 3: \"RR\" -> segment \"RR\": has R but no B -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                Example 4: \"B\" -> segment \"B\": length=1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                Example 5: \"W\" -> segment is empty? then we skip -> valid.\n\n                Example 6: \"WW\" -> valid.\n\n                Example 7: \"\" -> valid.\n\n            But the problem examples:\n\n                Example test case 1: explained in the statement -> \"BRBBW\" -> but the example in the statement is \"BRBBW\"? Actually, the example in the statement is \"BRBBW\", but the example input for the test case might be different.\n\n            The problem examples:\n\n                The first test case: \"BRBBW\" -> \n                    Break: \"BRBB\" and then \"W\" -> segment \"BRBB\": has R and B -> valid.\n\n                The second, third, and fourth test cases: \n                    n=1: \"R\", \"B\", \"W\" -> \n                        \"R\": segment \"R\" -> length=1 -> invalid -> \"NO\"\n                        \"B\": segment \"B\" -> invalid -> \"NO\"\n                        \"W\": valid -> but the problem says for the fourth test case: n=1, s=\"W\" -> then we break: no non-white segment -> valid -> \"YES\"? \n                    But the problem says for the second, third, and fourth: \"NO\". \n                    However, the fourth test case: the problem says \"for the fourth test case, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\" -> but if the picture is \"W\", then we don't need to stamp -> possible. \n                    But the problem says: \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                What are the test cases?\n                  The second: n=1, s=\"R\" -> \"NO\"\n                  The third: n=1, s=\"B\" -> \"NO\"\n                  The fourth: n=1, s=\"W\" -> \"YES\"?\n                But the problem says the fourth test case is \"NO\". \n\n            Let me read the problem again: \n                \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n            Why is the fourth test case \"NO\"? \n                The fourth test case: n=1, s=\"W\" -> then we don't need to stamp. So it is possible. \n\n            But the problem says: \"it is not possible to stamp a single cell\". The stamp requires two cells. Therefore, if the picture has only one cell, and that cell is white, then we don't need to stamp -> possible. \n\n            However, the problem says the answer for the fourth test case is \"NO\". \n\n            Let me check the sample inputs:\n\n                The problem says:\n                  The first test case is explained -> \"YES\"\n                  The second, third, and fourth: \"NO\"\n                  The fifth: \"YES\"\n                  The sixth: \"YES\"\n                  The seventh: \"YES\"\n\n                The sample inputs:\n\n                  t=7\n                  n=5, s=\"BRBBW\" -> YES\n                  n=1, s=\"R\" -> NO\n                  n=1, s=\"B\" -> NO\n                  n=1, s=\"W\" -> NO   ??? \n                  n=3, s=\"RBR\" -> YES? but the fifth example is \"BRB\" -> n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> YES? \n                  n=3, s=\"RBB\" -> YES\n                  n=1, s=\"W\" -> YES? \n\n            But the problem says the fourth test case is \"NO\", and it is n=1, s=\"W\". \n\n            Why would \"W\" (a single white cell) be impossible? \n                The problem says: \"The stamp must completely fit on the given n cells\". For n=1, the stamp (which covers two cells) cannot be used because it would be partially outside. Therefore, we cannot use the stamp at all. \n                Then the only possibility is to have the initial state: all white. So if the target is \"W\", then we don't need to stamp -> it is possible.\n\n            But the problem says: \"it is not possible to stamp a single cell\" -> meaning that we cannot use the stamp on a single cell? That is true: we cannot use the stamp. But we don't need to. \n\n            However, the problem says: \"Given a final picture, is it possible to make it using the stamp zero or more times?\".\n\n            Zero times: then we have all white. So if the target is \"W\", then we can do zero times -> YES.\n\n            But the problem says the fourth test case is \"NO\". \n\n            There is a known issue: the problem says the fourth test case is n=1, s=\"W\", and the answer is \"NO\". \n\n            I see: the problem says: \n                \"The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1<=n<=10^5) \u2014 the length of the picture. The second line of each test case contains a string s \u2014 the picture you need to make.\"\n\n            And the sample test cases:\n\n                Test case 4: n=1, s=\"W\" -> but the problem says: \"For the fourth test case, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n            Why is it \"NO\"? \n\n            Rethink: \n                The stamp must cover two adjacent cells. In a picture of length 1, there are no two adjacent cells. Therefore, we cannot use the stamp. So the only possibility is the initial state: all white. \n                But the target is \"W\", which is the initial state. Therefore, we can achieve it by zero stamps.\n\n            However, the problem might be interpreting the stamping as requiring at least one stamp? But the problem says \"zero or more times\".\n\n            Known contest problem (Codeforces Global Round 18, problem B: https://codeforces.com/contest/1615/problem/B) is not this one.\n\n            Actually, the problem is from Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4), problem E: \n                https://codeforces.com/contest/1669/problem/E\n\n            But not exactly.\n\n            Another: Codeforces Round 706 (Div. 2) - problem C: \n\n            I recall: the problem is \"Stamp Coloring\" from a contest, and the known solution is the one I described. But the sample test case 4: n=1, s=\"W\" -> then the segment is empty? so we don't have any non-white segment -> then we return \"YES\". \n\n            But the problem says the fourth test case is \"NO\". \n\n            Let me read the problem statement again: \n                \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n            The second: n=1, s=\"R\" -> we break into one segment of length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\"\n            The third: n=1, s=\"B\" -> \"NO\"\n            The fourth: n=2, s=\"WW\" -> then we break: no non-white segment -> valid -> \"YES\"?\n            But the problem says the fourth is \"NO\". \n\n            The sample inputs in the problem:\n\n                The first test case: n=5, s=\"BRBBW\" -> YES\n                The second: n=1, s=\"B\" -> NO\n                The third: n=1, s=\"R\" -> NO\n                The fourth: n=1, s=\"W\" -> NO   ??? \n                The fifth: n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> YES\n                The sixth: n=3, s=\"RBB\" -> YES\n                The seventh: n=2, s=\"WW\" -> YES\n\n            But the problem says the fourth test case is n=1, s=\"W\" -> and it is \"NO\". \n\n            Why is it \"NO\"? \n                Because the stamp cannot be used on a single cell, but we don't need to use it. \n\n            There is a known problem: the problem might be that the entire picture must be stamped at least once? But the problem says \"zero or more times\".\n\n            After checking a known submission for a similar problem (Codeforces Round 706 (Div. 2), problem C: \n                https://codeforces.com/contest/1496/problem/C\n\n            Not matching.\n\n            Actually, the problem is from a recent contest: Codeforces Global Round 18, problem B: \n                https://codeforces.com/contest/1615/problem/B\n\n            But not matching.\n\n            I found: the problem is from Codeforces Round #727 (Div. 2), problem C: \n                https://codeforces.com/contest/1539/problem/C\n\n            Not matching.\n\n            Alternatively, the intended solution might be:\n\n                We can only achieve the target if:\n                  - The entire string is \"W\", then YES.\n                  - Otherwise, every contiguous segment of non-white must have length>=2 and must contain at least one R and at least one B.\n\n            But then for n=1, s=\"W\" -> YES.\n\n            The problem says the fourth test case (n=1, s=\"W\") is \"NO\". \n\n            There is a known issue in the problem statement: the fourth test case might be mislabeled.\n\n            But the problem says: \n                \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n            This might mean that the fourth test case is not \"W\" but something else?

\n                But the fifth test case: n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> YES.\n\n            The sixth: n=3, s=\"RBB\" -> YES.\n\n            The seventh: n=2, s=\"WW\" -> YES.\n\n            And the fourth test case: the problem says \"For the fourth test case, it is not possible to stamp a single cell\", and then the answer is \"NO\". \n\n            What could be the fourth test case? \n                It might be n=2, s=\"RW\" -> then we have a segment of length1 (the 'R') -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n            Therefore, the fourth test case might be: n=2, s=\"RW\" (or any with an isolated non-white).\n\n            Given the input specification: \n                The first line of each test case contains an integer n, then a string s of length n.\n\n            And the sample test cases in the input might be:\n\n                5\n                BRBBW\n                1\n                B\n                1\n                R\n                2\n                RW   # or something similar\n                3\n                BRB\n                3\n                RBB\n                2\n                WW\n\n            Then the answers:\n                BRBBW: break into \"BRBB\" -> valid -> YES\n                B: segment \"B\" -> length1 -> NO\n                R: segment \"R\" -> length1 -> NO\n                RW: break into \"R\" and then \"W\" -> segment \"R\" has length1 -> NO\n                BRB: segment \"BRB\" -> has R and B -> YES\n                RBB: segment \"RBB\" -> has R and B -> YES\n                WW: no segment -> YES\n\n            This matches the problem's answers: \n                YES, NO, NO, NO, YES, YES, YES.\n\n            Therefore, the fourth test case is not \"W\" (n=1) but a string of length>=2 that has an isolated non-white.\n\n            But the problem says: \"The fourth test case\" in the note is the one that is not possible to stamp a single cell -> meaning that there is a single non-white cell in the entire string? \n\n            Therefore, the solution for program2.py is:\n\n                for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    # s is the string for the test case, and it includes the newline? we should strip.\n                    n = ...? but we are iterating over the test cases: the first line of the test case is n, and the second line is s.\n\n                We are given: \n                  [*open(0)]: \n                    index0: t\n                    index1: n1\n                    index2: s1\n                    index3: n2\n                    index4: s2\n                    ...\n\n                We are taking [2::2] -> starting from index2 (the first test case's string) and then every two lines: so we get the strings.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  t = number of test cases\n                  then we skip the first two lines? \n\n                Actually, the code: \n                  for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                      s = s.strip()\n                      n = len(s)   # but the first line of the test case is the integer n, and the second line is the string of length n. But we are only taking the string lines.\n\n                We don't have the integer n for the test case in the loop? But we can get n = len(s.strip())? but the string might have trailing spaces? the problem says the string has length n.\n\n                We can do: \n                  s = s.strip()\n                  n = len(s)\n\n                Then we break the string by 'W' into segments.\n\n                Steps:\n                  segments = s.split('W')\n                  # but note: consecutive W's will give empty segments, which we can ignore.\n                  valid = True\n                  for seg in segments:\n                      if seg == \"\": \n                          continue\n                      if len(seg) == 1:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n                      # check if it has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'\n                      if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                          valid = False\n                          break\n\n                  if valid:\n                      print(\"YES\")\n                  else:\n                      print(\"NO\")\n\n            Let's test with the examples:\n\n                Example: s = \"B\" -> n=1, seg = ['B'] -> len=1 -> \"NO\"\n                Example: s = \"R\" -> \"NO\"\n                Example: s = \"W\" -> segments = ['', '']? because split by 'W' gives ['','']? \n                    We skip empty segments -> valid -> \"YES\"\n                Example: s = \"RW\" -> split by 'W' -> ['R'] -> len=1 -> \"NO\"\n                Example: s = \"BRB\" -> split by 'W' -> ['BRB'] -> has R and B -> \"YES\"\n                Example: s = \"RBB\" -> \"YES\"\n                Example: s = \"WW\" -> segments = ['','','']? -> split by 'W' gives ['',''] -> skip -> \"YES\"\n                Example: s = \"BRBBW\" -> split by 'W' -> ['BRBB',''] -> then we check 'BRBB': has R and B -> \"YES\"\n\n            But the problem says the fourth test case is \"NO\", and if the fourth test case is \"RW\", then we get \"NO\", which matches.\n\n            However, note: what if the string is \"WRW\"? \n                segments = ['','R',''] -> then we have a segment 'R' -> length1 -> \"NO\"\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n                for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    s = s.strip()\n                    if s == \"\": \n                        # but n>=1, so probably not\n                        print(\"YES\")\n                    else:\n                        segments = s.split('W')\n                        valid = True\n                        for seg in segments:\n                            if seg == \"\":\n                                continue\n                            if len(seg) == 1:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                        if valid:\n                            print(\"YES\")\n                        else:\n                            print(\"NO\")\n\n  But note: the problem says the total length of s over test cases <= 10^5, so this is efficient.\n\n  However, we can optimize the checking: \n        Instead of splitting, we can traverse the string and whenever we see a non-W, we accumulate until we see a W. Then check the accumulated segment.\n\n  But the split method is O(n) and the total n is 10^5, so it is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the string might be large, but the total length is bounded by 10^5.\n\n  Therefore, we output the above.\n\n  However, note: what if the segment is very long? The split will create a list of segments. That is acceptable.\n\n  Let's test with an empty string: \n      s = \"\" -> then segments = [''] -> then we skip the empty string? Actually, no: \n          split by 'W' of an empty string: [''] -> then we check: if seg==\"\", we skip? \n          then we have no non-empty segment -> valid.\n\n  But the problem: n>=1, so we won't get an empty string.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program2.py is as above.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total of n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n  We output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py in the required JSON format.\n\n  Note: the program1.py code must be inserted in the while loop.\n\n  For program1.py:\n\n      We have:\n\n          I=lambda:[*map(int,input().split())]\n          t,=I()\n          while t:\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We will replace the TODO with:\n\n          t -= 1\n          data = I()\n          n = data[0]\n          m = data[1]\n          a = I()\n          if n > m:\n              print(\"NO\")\n          else:\n              a.sort(reverse=True)\n              total_gap = 0\n              for i in range(n-1):\n                  total_gap += a[i] + 1\n              if total_gap + a[0] < m:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n  But note: what if we break the circle at the largest requirement, but there is an even larger gap requirement from another person? We sorted in descending order, so a[0] is the largest.\n\n  Therefore, we output the above.\n\n  However, note: the condition in the if statement: total_gap + a[0] < m.\n\n  But wait: the condition we derived was S < m - a[0] -> S + a[0] < m.\n\n  So it is correct.\n\n  For program2.py:\n\n      We have:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n      We will replace with:\n\n          s = s.strip()\n          if s == \"\": \n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              segments = s.split('W')\n              valid = True\n              for seg in segments:\n                  if len(seg)==0:\n                      continue\n                  if len(seg)==1:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n                  if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                      valid = False\n                      break\n              print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and we are doing a split and then a linear scan for each segment, which is O(n) per test case, and the total length is bounded, so it is acceptable.\n\n  We output the code in the JSON as strings.\n\n  Note: we must escape quotes if any? The code does not have quotes in the string, but we are writing a JSON string.\n\n  We will use a raw string or escape.\n\n  However, the problem says: Output only the missing code, NOT as markdown code. And in the JSON.\n\n  We write:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"t -= 1\\n        data = I()\\n        n = data[0]\\n        m = data[1]\\n        a = I()\\n        if n > m:\\n            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        else:\\n            a.sort(reverse=True)\\n            total_gap = 0\\n            for i in range(n-1):\\n                total_gap += a[i] + 1\\n            if total_gap + a[0] < m:\\n                print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n            else:\\n                print(\\\"NO\\\")\",\n        \"program2\": \"s = s.strip()\\n        if s == \\\"\\\":\\n            print(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        else:\\n            segments = s.split('W')\\n            valid = True\\n            for seg in segments:\\n                if len(seg)==0:\\n                    continue\\n                if len(seg)==1:\\n                    valid = False\\n                    break\\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n                    valid = False\\n                    break\\n            print(\\\"YES\\\" if valid else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program2.py code is for the loop: for s in [*open(0)][2::2]: ... \n\n  We are replacing the TODO with the block of code.\n\n  However, the program2.py code provided"
