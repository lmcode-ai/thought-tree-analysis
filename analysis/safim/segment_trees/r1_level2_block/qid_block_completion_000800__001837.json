But note: the condition `p1-1<=p2` is equivalent to `p1 <= p2+1`. This condition is true for p1=0 and p2=-1? But we start with p2=n-1 (>=0). So we can change it to `while p1 <= p2`? Actually, the condition `p1-1<=p2` is true for p1=0 and p2=-1? But we don't want to run when p2 is -1? So we change to `while p1 <= p2`? But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps? So let me restructure:\n\n    t = int(input().strip())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip()) w = list(map(int, input().split())) s1, s2 = 0, 0\n        p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n        l2 = [0]   # we start with 0: they eat nothing\n        while p1 <= p2:\n            if s1 == s2:\n                # record the current total: p1 (candies from left) and (n-1-p2) from right\n                total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                l2.append(total)\n                # break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n                s1 += w[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            elif s1 < s2:\n                s1 += w[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else: # s2 < s1\n                s2 += w[p2]\n                p2 -= 1\n\n        # After the loop, we output the last element of l2? But note: we might have an equal sum at the last step?",

So we are only to output the missing code? The missing code is only the block for `if s1 == s2`? But the condition of the while loop is given? So we don't change the condition? But the condition `while (p1-1<=p2)` might be intended? Actually, let me simulate with the first test case: n=2, w = [1,1] Initially: p1=0, p2=1, s1=0, s2=0. Condition: p1-1 = -1 <= p2=1 -> true.\n        s1==s2 -> true: \n            total = 0 + (2-1-1) = 0? -> but we want 2? Then we do: s1 += l[0] -> s1=1, p1=1. Then we check: s1 (1) and s2 (0): s1>s2 -> then we do: s2 += l[1] -> s2=1, p2=0. Then we break? because next condition: p1=1, p2=0: condition: p1-1=0<=p2=0 -> true. Then we enter: \n            s1=1, s2=1 -> equal: \n                total = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1 = 2 -> we record 2. then we break the tie: s1 += l[1] -> but p1=1, which is the last candy? and then p1 becomes 2? Then condition: p1=2, p2=0: condition: 2-1=1<=0? false -> break. Then we print l2[-1] = 2. So it works? But the total we recorded at the first time was 0? Then we recorded 2? Then we output 2? So we don't need to change the condition? Therefore, we can leave the condition as `while (p1-1<=p2)`? So the missing code for program1.py is only the block for `if s1 == s2`:\n\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total) s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n    But note: what if after we do p1+=1, p1 becomes n? Then we are out of bounds? But the condition will break? And we don't use l[p1] again? Because we break? But in the next iteration, we break? So it's safe? But what if we break the tie by moving the left? and then p1 becomes n? Then we break? So the code for program1.py missing block is:\n\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n    But note: the variable is `l` (the list of weights) and we are using `l[p1]`? Yes. But what if we break the tie by moving the right? The note: the first test case: \n        n=3, w=[7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> answer=7? How does it work?",

They eat 7 candies in total: Alice eats: [7,3,20] -> 30\n            Bob eats: [10,8,11,1] -> 10+8+11+1 = 30\n            Total candies: 3+4=7. So the answer is 7. The problem statement in the note says: \"the answer is 6\" -> but then it says \"because they eat six candies in total\" -> but 3+4=7. So the note has a mistake?",

Similarly for others. So it works. Therefore, for the odd case, we can use the same formula as the even case for k in range(n//2+1):\n\n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k   # because (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k\n\n            But wait: in the even case, the code did:\n\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n            Let me compute: \n                (3 * n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k -1 +1 = 3*n - 3*k. So we can do:\n\n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k\n\n            Then print(a, b)\n\n            But note: the indices are 1-indexed. So for program2.py, the TODO block is:\n\n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k\n                print(a, b) But wait: for k=0 in n=3: \n                a=1, b=9 -> that matches.\n\n            for k=1: a=4, b= 3*3 - 3*1 = 9-3=6 -> matches. So we can use the same as the even case? But the even case code:\n\n                for k in range((n // 2)):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1) In the odd case, we do:\n\n                for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                    a = 3*k+1\n                    b = 3*n - 3*k   # which is the same as (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1? \n                    # because (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k -1 +1 = 3*n-3*k. So we can write:\n\n                print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k) But the even case uses: (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k. So it's the same. Therefore, the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k\n                print(a, b) But we can do in one line: \n\n                print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k) So the code for the odd case:\n\n            else:\n                print(n//2+1)\n                for k in range((n//2)+1):\n                    print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n        But note: the indices must be distinct and within [1, 3*n]? For k in [0, n//2] (inclusive), the indices:\n\n            a = 3*k+1: \n                k=0 -> 1\n                k=1 -> 4\n                ...\n                k = n//2 -> 3*(n//2)+1\n\n            b = 3*n - 3*k: \n                k=0 -> 3*n\n                k=1 -> 3*n-3\n                ... k = n//2 -> 3*n - 3*(n//2) For k = n//2: \n                a = 3*(n//2)+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*(n//2)\n\n            We need to ensure a < b? For n=3: k=1: a=4, b=6 -> 4<6 -> valid. For n=5: k=2: a=7, b=15-6=9 -> 7<9. For k = n//2: \n                a = 3*(n//2)+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*(n//2) = 3*(n - n//2) For n odd: n//2 = floor(n/2)\n                n=5: n//2=2, then a=3*2+1=7, b=3*5-3*2=15-6=9 -> 7<9. For n=1: \n                n//2 = 0, then k in [0,0]: \n                    a=1, b=3*1 - 0 = 3 -> swap index1 and 3? But the sample for n=1: \n                    if n==1: \n                        print(1)\n                        print(\"1 2\") So we are printing \"1 3\", but the sample solution is \"1 2\". Why? The sample for n=1: \n                s(1)=\"BAN\" -> indices: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N.\n                swap(1,2): becomes: A, B, N -> \"ABN\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence. If we swap(1,3): becomes: N, A, B -> \"NAB\", which also does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? But the problem says: \"if there are multiple, output any\"\n\n            So both are valid? But the problem says: \"minimum number of operations\", and we are doing one swap? So it's acceptable. However, the sample solution for n=1 is \"1 2\", and for n=2 is \"2 6\", and for n>=3 we use the formula. But the problem says: \"if there are multiple, output any\"\n\n            So we can output any valid solution.",

Then we output the two lines with 16 spaces? But the even case body is at 16 spaces? So we output:\n\n            program2: \n                \"                ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\" But that is 16 spaces at the beginning of each line? Alternatively, we can count the existing code in the even case: \n\n            for k in range((n // 2)):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        How many spaces before 'ans'? In the provided code, it is:\n\n                        ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1) So 20 spaces? But the for loop is at 12 spaces? and the body is 16? Actually, the provided code for the even case:\n\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    print(n // 2)\n                    for k in range((n // 2)):\n                        ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        The for loop is at 8 (from the if) + 4 = 12? and the body at 16? So we output 16 spaces? But the string would be:\n\n            \"                ans = ...\"\n\n        with 16 spaces. But 16 spaces is 16 times ' '? We can generate: \n\n            program2_code = \"                ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n        But note: the even case has the same? So it's consistent. Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\\n        l2.append(total)\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"                ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n        }\n\n    But wait: in program1, the while loop body is already at 4 spaces?",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code so that it solves the candy problem. The provided code has a while loop and a condition that checks when the two sums (s1 for Alice and s2 for Bob) are equal. We are to record the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) when the sums are equal.\n\nThe idea is to use two pointers: one starting at the beginning (p1) and one at the end (p2). We move the pointers inward, adding the current candy to the side that has the smaller current sum. When the two sums become equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 (the number of candies Alice has eaten) plus (n-1-p2) (the number of candies Bob has eaten)). We then break out of the loop when the pointers cross.\n\nHowever, note that the condition in the while loop is currently: `while (p1-1<=p2):` which is incorrect. We should change it to `while p1 <= p2` because we are going to move p1 from 0 to n and p2 from n-1 down, and we want to include the case when they are at the same candy? Actually, note that when they are at the same candy, we can only assign it to one of them? But the problem says they cannot eat the same candy.\n\nBut the problem says: Alice eats from the left (a contiguous segment from the left) and Bob from the right (a contiguous segment from the right). They cannot overlap. So when the pointers cross, we stop.\n\nActually, the condition should be `while p1 <= p2`? However, note the current condition: `p1-1<=p2` initially p1=0, so condition is -1<=p2 -> which is always true? That doesn't seem right.\n\nLet me reexamine the problem and the code.\n\nThe provided code has:\n    while (p1-1<=p2):\n\nBut that condition is always true for p1=0 and p2>=0? Then we run until we break by the pointers crossing? Actually, we break when p1 becomes greater than p2? But the condition is `p1-1<=p2` meaning when p1-1>p2 we break. So when p1-1>p2, that is when p1>p2+1. But we want to break when p1>p2? Actually, we can break when p1>p2 because then they have crossed.\n\nBut note: we are incrementing p1 and decrementing p2. We start with p1=0, p2=n-1. We want to consider when p1<=p2? Actually, we can have p1 and p2 such that they meet at the same candy? But then we can only assign that candy to one of them? However, the problem says they cannot eat the same candy.\n\nBut the current condition is `p1-1<=p2` which is equivalent to `p1 <= p2+1`. This condition is true even when p1==p2+1? That is, when p1 has passed p2? Actually, we want to stop when p1>p2? So we can change the condition to `while p1 <= p2`? But note the code does:\n\n    if s1 == s2: \n        ...   # we record the total candies eaten so far: p1 (from the left) and (n-1 - p2) from the right? Actually, Bob has eaten from the right: the candies from p2+1 to n-1? So the count for Bob is (n-1 - p2). Then total = p1 + (n-1 - p2) = p1 + n - p2 - 1.\n\nBut wait, the total number of candies eaten is the number of candies Alice has eaten (which is p1, because she started at 0 and has eaten p1 candies: indices 0 to p1-1) and Bob has eaten (n-1 - p2) candies (from p2+1 to n-1). So total = p1 + (n-1 - p2).\n\nBut note: when we record the total, we should record it and then we can continue? Because we might have a better solution? Actually, we are moving the pointers and we want the maximum total candies when the sums are equal. So we should record every time the sums are equal? And then at the end we take the maximum? But the problem says \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\".\n\nHowever, the provided code only prints `l2[-1]` at the end. And we are appending the total to `l2` every time we have an equal sum? But note: we are moving the pointers and the condition `s1==s2` might occur multiple times? And we want the maximum total? But the total candies eaten is increasing? Actually, as we move the pointers, we are adding more candies? But wait: when we have an equal sum, we can then try to add more? Actually, we are not stopping when we get an equal sum? We are just recording and then we continue? But the problem is: we can only have contiguous segments from the left and right? And we are allowed to choose any contiguous segments? Actually, the way we are doing two pointers is: we start with nothing, then we add until the sums are equal? And then we record and then we continue? But note: we are moving the pointers independently: if s1 < s2, we add a candy to Alice? and if s2 < s1, we add to Bob? So we are increasing the total candies? And when we get an equal sum, we record the current total? Then we break? Actually, the problem does not require that we break? We can continue? But note: we are moving the pointers until they cross? And we record every time the sums are equal? Then we take the maximum? But the provided code does not have a list l2 defined? Actually, the code has:\n\n    l2 = []\n\nand then in the condition:\n\n    if s1 == s2: \n        ... # we are supposed to do something?\n\nBut the code is incomplete. We are to complete the code.\n\nSo the plan:\n\nWe initialize:\n    s1 = 0, s2 = 0\n    p1 = 0, p2 = n-1\n    l2 = []   # we will store the total candies eaten each time we have an equal sum\n\nThen we do:\n    while p1 <= p2:   # we change the condition to p1<=p2? because we can still consider when p1==p2? but then we can only take one? Actually, we are going to break the condition when p1>p2? But note: we are going to add from the left if s1 < s2, which will increment p1. Similarly for s2. So we break when p1>p2.\n\nBut the condition in the provided code is `while (p1-1<=p2)`. Let me see: initially p1=0, so condition is -1<=p2 -> true. Then we do the loop. Then we check if s1==s2: then we record the total? Then we check if s1 < s2: then we add l[p1] and p1++. Then if s2 < s1: then we add l[p2] and p2--.\n\nBut note: after we do the first condition (s1==s2) we then check s1<s2 and then s2<s1? But if s1==s2, then we skip both? Then we do nothing? Then we break? Actually, we don't break? We just record and then the next iteration? But we haven't moved the pointers? Then we get stuck? So we must move the pointers? Actually, we can break the symmetry by moving one pointer? But note: we are allowed to have multiple equal sums? And we want the maximum total? So we should record and then move one pointer? But which one? Actually, we can move the one that is smaller? But they are equal? Then we can move both? Or we can move one? But if we move one, then the sums become unequal? Then we continue? But we want to see if we can get a larger total? So we should move one? But which one? Actually, we can move the left one? Or the right one? But note: we are going to move one pointer arbitrarily? Actually, we can choose to move the left one? Because we are going to continue until we break? So we can do:\n\n    if s1 == s2:\n        # record the current total: p1 (candies from left) and (n-1-p2) from right -> total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        # Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n        # But note: we are going to move one pointer? Actually, we can move the left pointer? Then we do:\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\nBut wait, what if we have an equal sum and then we move the left pointer? Then s1 becomes larger? Then we might have to move the right pointer? But we are just continuing the process? However, we are not missing any equal sum? Because we are going to continue until the pointers cross? And we record every time we have an equal sum? Then at the end we take the maximum? But note: the problem says \"the most number of candies\", so we want the maximum total? But the total candies eaten when we have an equal sum is recorded. However, we are not storing the maximum? We are storing every occurrence? Then at the end we print l2[-1]? That would be the last time we had an equal sum? But the last time might not be the maximum? Actually, as we move the pointers, the total candies eaten (p1 + n-1-p2) is increasing? Because we are adding one candy per iteration? Actually, we are adding one candy per iteration? Because we do one candy per iteration? So the total candies eaten is increasing? Then the last time we have an equal sum would be the maximum? But wait: we are adding one candy at a time? So the total candies eaten is increasing? Then the last time we have an equal sum is the maximum? So we can just record the last one? But what if we have an equal sum at the beginning and then we never have again? Then we have to remember the maximum? Actually, we can store the maximum? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can store the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, we can store the last one? But note: the total candies eaten is increasing? Because we are always adding one candy per iteration? So the total candies eaten (p1 + n-1-p2) is increasing? Actually, p1 increases and p2 decreases? So the total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = (p1 - p2) + (n-1). Since p1 increases and p2 decreases, (p1-p2) increases? So the total is increasing? Therefore, the last time we have an equal sum is the maximum? So we can just record the last one? But what if we never have an equal sum? Then l2 is empty? Then we output 0? Because the problem says: if they cannot eat the same non-zero weight, then output 0? But note: they can always choose to eat 0 candies? But the problem says \"non-zero\"? Actually, the problem says: \"they want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" and we are to maximize the total number of candies. So if they cannot have the same positive weight, then they eat 0 candies? But the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\" and the condition is that the total weights are equal. So if they eat 0 candies, then the total weight is 0 for both? That is fair? But the problem says \"non-zero\" in the note? Actually, the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\" So we output 0.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n    if s1 == s2:\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        # We record this total? But we don't know if we will get a larger one? But the total is increasing? So we can just remember the last one? Actually, we can set a variable max_candies = max(max_candies, total) and then continue? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do that? But the provided code prints l2[-1] at the end? So we are storing every total? Then we take the last one? But if we have multiple, the last one is the maximum? Because the total is increasing? So we can do:\n\n        current_total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(current_total)\n\n    Then after the loop, we want to output the maximum? But note: the problem says \"print a single integer\" for each test case. So we should output the maximum total? But if l2 is not empty, we output the maximum? But the total is increasing? So the last one is the maximum? Then we can output l2[-1] if l2 is not empty? Otherwise 0? But the code prints l2[-1] at the end? So if we never had an equal sum, l2 is empty? Then we get an error? So we should initialize l2 with 0? Or we can do: if l2: print(l2[-1]) else: print(0)? But the code only prints l2[-1]? So we must ensure that if we never have an equal sum, we output 0? How? We can set l2 = [0] at the beginning? Then we update when we have an equal sum? Then at the end we print l2[-1]? But note: we might have an equal sum at the beginning (0==0) and then we record 0? Then we continue? Then we might get a positive one? Then we update? Then the last one is the maximum? But 0 is always there? Then we are safe? Actually, at the beginning: s1=0, s2=0 -> we record total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0? Then we break the tie by moving the left? Then we continue? Then we might get more? So we can do:\n\n    l2 = [0]   # because they can always choose to eat nothing? But note: the problem says they can choose any contiguous segments? So 0 is always an option? Then we start with 0.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"the most number of candies\", so we want the maximum? And we are going to update every time we have an equal sum? Then we output the last one? But the last one is the maximum? Because the total is increasing? So we can do:\n\n    if s1 == s2:\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n\n    Then after the loop, we print l2[-1]? But if we never have an equal sum after the initial 0, then we have l2=[0] and we output 0? That is correct.\n\nBut note: the initial state: p1=0, p2=n-1, s1=0, s2=0 -> we record total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0. Then we break the tie? We do:\n\n    if s1 < s2: ... -> but they are equal? so we skip? then we do if s2 < s1: ... -> skip? then we break the loop? because we don't move? Then we break? So we are stuck? So we must break the tie? We can do:\n\n    if s1 == s2:\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        # Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n    Then we continue? But note: we are in the loop? Then we check again? Then we might have s1>s2? Then we move the right pointer? etc.\n\nBut what if we are at the last candy? p1==p2? Then we do:\n\n    if s1==s2: we record, then we add the left candy? then p1 becomes p1+1 -> now p1>p2? Then we break? \n\nSo we change the condition to:\n\n    while p1 <= p2:   # because we want to include when p1==p2? \n\nBut the provided condition is `while (p1-1<=p2)`. We can change it to `while p1 <= p2`? \n\nBut note: the condition `p1-1<=p2` is equivalent to `p1 <= p2+1`. This condition is true for p1=0 and p2=-1? But we start with p2=n-1 (>=0). So we can change it to `while p1 <= p2`? Actually, the condition `p1-1<=p2` is true for p1=0 and p2=-1? But we don't want to run when p2 is -1? So we change to `while p1 <= p2`? \n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps? \n\nSo let me restructure:\n\n    t = int(input().strip())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        s1, s2 = 0, 0\n        p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n        l2 = [0]   # we start with 0: they eat nothing\n        while p1 <= p2:\n            if s1 == s2:\n                # record the current total: p1 (candies from left) and (n-1-p2) from right\n                total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                l2.append(total)\n                # break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n                s1 += w[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            elif s1 < s2:\n                s1 += w[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else: # s2 < s1\n                s2 += w[p2]\n                p2 -= 1\n\n        # After the loop, we output the last element of l2? But note: we might have an equal sum at the last step? Actually, we break the loop when p1>p2? So we don't check the last step? But we check at the beginning of the loop? So when p1>p2, we break? So we don't enter the loop? So we don't check the last state? \n\n        # But note: when we are in the last step: p1==p2, then we check: if s1==s2, we record and then we move p1 to p1+1 -> then p1>p2? Then we break? Then we output l2[-1]? \n\n        # But what if at the last step we have s1==s2? Then we record and then we break? \n\n        # However, what if we have an equal sum at the last step? Then we record and then we break? \n\n        # But what if we have an equal sum at the last step and then we break? Then we output that? \n\n        # But note: the total candies eaten at that step is p1 + (n-1-p2) = (p1) + (n-1-p2). After we add the left candy, p1 becomes p1+1, so the total we recorded is for the state before we added that candy? But wait: we recorded the total at the moment we had s1==s2? Then we added the candy? Then we break? \n\n        # Actually, we record the total at the state: \n        #   Alice has eaten [0, p1-1] -> p1 candies? Actually, no: Alice has eaten from 0 to p1-1 -> that's p1 candies? \n        #   Bob has eaten from p2+1 to n-1 -> that's (n-1 - p2) candies? \n        #   So total = p1 + (n-1-p2) -> that is the state at the beginning of the loop? \n\n        # But then we add the candy at p1? Then we break? \n\n        # Actually, we are recording the state at the beginning of the loop? \n\n        # But note: we are in the loop and we have p1<=p2? Then we check the current s1 and s2? \n\n        # So the state we are recording is the current state? \n\n        # Then we update? \n\n        # So the total we record is the current total candies eaten? \n\n        # Then we update by adding one more candy? \n\n        # But that candy breaks the equality? \n\n        # Then we break the loop? \n\n        # So we have recorded the state at the last equal sum? \n\n        # Then we output the last element of l2? \n\n        print(l2[-1])\n\nBut wait: what if we have an equal sum at the beginning of the loop and then we update and then we get another equal sum? Then we record again? And the total candies eaten is increasing? So the last one is the maximum? \n\nBut note: the total candies eaten is increasing? Because we are adding one candy per iteration? So the total = p1 + (n-1-p2) is increasing? Because p1 increases and p2 decreases? So the total increases? \n\nTherefore, the last recorded total is the maximum? \n\nBut what if we never have an equal sum? Then we only have the initial 0? Then we output 0? \n\nSo we can do:\n\n    l2 = [0]   # at the beginning, we have 0\n\n    while p1 <= p2:\n        if s1 == s2:\n            total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n            l2.append(total)\n            # Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n            s1 += w[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        elif s1 < s2:\n            s1 += w[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            s2 += w[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n\n    print(l2[-1])\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are doing at most 200000 steps per test case? But the sum of n over test cases is 200000? So we are safe.\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can do a while loop that runs n steps per test case? \n\nSo we change the condition to `while p1 <= p2`? \n\nBut the provided code has `while (p1-1<=p2)`. We can change it to `while p1 <= p2`? \n\nBut the provided code has:\n\n    while (p1-1<=p2):\n\nWe can change that to `while p1 <= p2`? \n\nBut note: the condition `p1-1<=p2` is equivalent to `p1 <= p2+1`. This condition is true for p1=0 and p2=-1? But we break when p1>p2? Actually, we want to break when p1>p2? So we can change it to `while p1<=p2`? \n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    We change the condition to `while p1 <= p2`? \n    And then in the if s1==s2 block, we do:\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s1 += l[p1]   # because we break the tie by moving the left? \n        p1 += 1\n\nBut note: the code already has:\n\n    if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we have to fill the TODO? \n\nActually, the provided code has:\n\n    if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe have to write the code for that block? \n\nSo:\n\n    if s1 == s2:\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\nBut note: what if after we do that, p1 becomes greater than p2? Then we break? \n\nBut the condition is at the beginning of the loop? So we break? \n\nBut what if we have an equal sum and then we move the left pointer and then p1 becomes greater than p2? Then we break? \n\nBut we have to break the tie? \n\nAlternatively, we can break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n\nBut what if we break the tie by moving the right pointer? It doesn't matter? Because the total is increasing? And we are going to record the next equal sum? But we are only moving one pointer? \n\nBut note: we are in the state s1==s2, and we move the left pointer: then s1 becomes s1 + l[p1] and p1 increases. Then in the next iteration, we might have s1>s2? Then we move the right pointer? \n\nBut we are not missing any state? \n\nSo we can do that? \n\nBut what if we break the tie by moving the right pointer? \n\n    if s1 == s2:\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s2 += l[p2]\n        p2 -= 1\n\nThat would also work? \n\nBut the problem does not specify? \n\nBut note: we are going to continue until the pointers cross? \n\nBut the total candies eaten is increasing? So the last recorded total is the maximum? \n\nBut if we break the tie arbitrarily, we might get different sequences? But the last recorded total should be the same? \n\nActually, no: because if we break the tie by moving the left, then we are adding a candy to Alice? Then we might get an equal sum later? Similarly for Bob? \n\nBut the problem does not require a particular sequence? \n\nBut we want the maximum total? \n\nSo we can break the tie arbitrarily? \n\nBut note: we must break the tie? Otherwise we get stuck? \n\nSo we choose to break the tie by moving the left? \n\nBut the note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000? So we are safe? \n\nBut what if we break the tie by moving the left? and then the next state we have s1>s2? Then we move the right? \n\nSo the code for program1.py:\n\n    We change the condition to `while p1 <= p2`? \n    But the provided condition is `while (p1-1<=p2)`. We can leave it? \n\n    Actually, the condition `p1-1<=p2` is true for p1=0 and p2=-1? But we start with p2>=0? So we break when p1-1>p2? which is when p1>p2+1? But we want to break when p1>p2? So we might run one extra step? \n\n    For example: when p1=p2+1? Then condition: p1-1 = p2 <= p2 -> true? Then we enter? Then we check: s1==s2? Then we do the block? Then we break? \n\n    But if we break the tie by moving the left? Then p1 becomes p1+1 -> then p1 = p2+2? Then we break? \n\n    But we have already moved beyond? \n\n    Actually, we want to break when p1>p2? So we can change the condition to `while p1<=p2`? \n\n    But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000? So we can change it? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\". \n\n    So we are only to output the missing code? \n\n    The missing code is only the block for `if s1 == s2`? \n\n    But the condition of the while loop is given? \n\n    So we don't change the condition? \n\n    But the condition `while (p1-1<=p2)` might be intended? \n\n    Actually, let me simulate with the first test case: n=2, w = [1,1]\n\n    Initially: p1=0, p2=1, s1=0, s2=0.\n    Condition: p1-1 = -1 <= p2=1 -> true.\n        s1==s2 -> true: \n            total = 0 + (2-1-1) = 0? -> but we want 2? \n            Then we do: s1 += l[0] -> s1=1, p1=1.\n        Then we check: s1 (1) and s2 (0): s1>s2 -> then we do: s2 += l[1] -> s2=1, p2=0.\n        Then we break? because next condition: p1=1, p2=0: condition: p1-1=0<=p2=0 -> true.\n        Then we enter: \n            s1=1, s2=1 -> equal: \n                total = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1 = 2 -> we record 2.\n                then we break the tie: s1 += l[1] -> but p1=1, which is the last candy? and then p1 becomes 2? \n        Then condition: p1=2, p2=0: condition: 2-1=1<=0? false -> break.\n        Then we print l2[-1] = 2.\n\n    So it works? \n\n    But the total we recorded at the first time was 0? Then we recorded 2? Then we output 2? \n\n    So we don't need to change the condition? \n\n    Therefore, we can leave the condition as `while (p1-1<=p2)`? \n\n    So the missing code for program1.py is only the block for `if s1 == s2`:\n\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n    But note: what if after we do p1+=1, p1 becomes n? Then we are out of bounds? But the condition will break? And we don't use l[p1] again? Because we break? \n\n    But in the next iteration, we break? \n\n    So it's safe? \n\n    But what if we break the tie by moving the left? and then p1 becomes n? Then we break? \n\n    So the code for program1.py missing block is:\n\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n    But note: the variable is `l` (the list of weights) and we are using `l[p1]`? \n\n    Yes.\n\n    But what if we break the tie by moving the right? \n\n    The note: the first test case: \n        n=3, w=[7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> answer=7? \n\n    How does it work? \n\n    We want to record the total when the sums are equal? \n\n    But we don't know the exact sequence? \n\n    But the problem says: we are to output the maximum total? \n\n    So we trust the algorithm? \n\n    Therefore, for program1.py, the missing block is:\n\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n    But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output the code for the block? \n\n    However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n    So for program1.py, we output the string for the block? \n\n    But note: the block is:\n\n        total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n    But we have to be careful: the indentation? \n\n    The existing code has:\n\n        if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n    So we have to write the next lines with the same indentation? \n\n    So the code for the block is:\n\n        total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\n        l2.append(total)\n        s1 += l[p1]\n        p1 += 1\n\n    But note: the variable is `l` (the list) and we are using `l[p1]`? \n\n    Yes.\n\n    But what if p1 is out of bounds? We are checking the condition at the beginning? So when we do p1+=1, we break the loop? \n\n    So it's safe? \n\n    Alternatively, we can break the tie by moving the right? \n\n    But the problem does not specify? \n\n    However, the note: the first test case: n=2, [1,1] -> we break the tie by moving the left? then we get 2? \n\n    But if we break the tie by moving the right? \n\n        if s1==s2:\n            total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n            l2.append(total)\n            s2 += l[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n\n    Then for n=2, [1,1]:\n        first: s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0, then s2=1, p2=0.\n        then condition: p1=0, p2=0: condition: 0-1=-1<=0 -> true.\n            then s1=0, s2=1 -> s1<s2: then s1 += l[0] -> s1=1, p1=1.\n        then condition: p1=1, p2=0: condition: 1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n            then s1=1, s2=1 -> record total = 1 + (2-1-0)=1+1=2? \n            then we break the tie: s2 += l[0] -> but p2=0, so l[0]=1 -> s2=2, p2=-1.\n        then break? \n        then output 2.\n\n    So same result? \n\n    But what about the third test case? n=3, [1,2,1] -> the answer is 0? \n\n    How does it work? \n\n    We start: p1=0, p2=2, s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0? then break the tie: say we move left: s1=1, p1=1.\n    Then condition: p1=1, p2=2: condition: 1-1=0<=2 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=0 -> s1>s2: then s2 += l[2]=1, p2=1.\n    Then condition: p1=1, p2=1: condition: 1-1=0<=1 -> true.\n        s1=1, s2=1 -> record total = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2? \n        then break the tie: move left: s1 += l[1]=2, p1=2.\n    Then condition: p1=2, p2=1: condition: 2-1=1<=1 -> true.\n        s1=2, s2=1 -> s1>s2: then s2 += l[1] -> but p2=1, so we add l[1]=2 -> s2=3, p2=0.\n    Then condition: p1=2, p2=0: condition: 2-1=1<=0 -> false -> break.\n    Then output 2? \n\n    But the expected answer is 0? \n\n    Why? \n\n    Because the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n    But we recorded 2? \n\n    Why? \n\n    Because we recorded when s1=1 and s2=1? But that is non-zero? \n\n    But the problem says: they cannot eat the same non-zero weight? \n\n    How? \n\n    The candies: [1,2,1]\n\n    Alice eats the first candy: weight=1, Bob eats the last candy: weight=1 -> total=1 each? \n\n    Then they eat 2 candies? \n\n    But the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n    So Alice eats [1] (the first candy) and Bob eats [1] (the last candy) -> that is valid? \n\n    Then why the note says 0? \n\n    The note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way for them to eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\" \n\n    But wait: the problem says: \"they want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" and \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\".\n\n    In the example: they eat 2 candies? \n\n    But the problem says: \"the answer is 0\"? \n\n    This is a contradiction? \n\n    Actually, the problem statement in the note: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n    But they did eat the same non-zero weight? \n\n    I see: the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" meaning they must have the same total weight? And they can choose which candies to eat? \n\n    In the example: they can choose to eat one candy each? and the total weight is 1 for both? \n\n    Then the answer should be 2? \n\n    But the note says 0? \n\n    This is confusing? \n\n    Let me check the problem statement: \n\n        \"For the third test case, there is no way for them to eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n    But wait: the third test case in the sample? \n\n    The problem has three sample test cases? \n\n    The first: n=2, [1,1] -> 2\n    The second: n=3, [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> 7\n    The third: n= something? \n\n    The note says: \"For the third test case, ...\" and then the fourth test case: n=1, [1] -> 0? \n\n    But the problem says: \"For each test case, print a single integer\"\n\n    The sample input:\n\n        t=4\n        n=2: [1,1] -> 2\n        n=3: [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> 7\n        n=3: [1,2,1] -> 0? \n        n=1: [1] -> 0\n\n    But why is [1,2,1] -> 0? \n\n    Let me read the problem again: \n\n        Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (contiguous from the left). \n        Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (contiguous from the right). \n\n    In the example [1,2,1]: \n        Alice can eat: \n            [] -> 0\n            [1] -> 1\n            [1,2] -> 3\n            [1,2,1] -> 4\n        Bob can eat:\n            [] -> 0\n            [1] (the last one) -> 1\n            [1,2] (the last two) -> 3\n            [1,2,1] -> 4\n\n        They want to have the same total weight? \n\n        If Alice eats [1] (weight=1) and Bob eats [1] (weight=1) -> total candies eaten=2? \n\n        But wait: the candies are contiguous?

There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2.\n            For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\"\n\n        But the sample input for the second test case is n=9, [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10] -> the answer is 6? \n\n        But the sample output in the problem statement for program1.py says: \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\", but the sample output in the provided sample input is 7? \n\n        This is confusing. \n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \n\n            \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n        The first three from the left: [7,3,20] -> sum=30? \n        The first three from the right: [10,8,11] -> sum=29? \n\n        That is not 7. \n\n        It says: \"total weight 7\" -> but 7 is the weight of the first candy? \n\n        This is a mess. \n\n        After checking the sample: \n\n            Input: \n                9\n                7 3 20 5 15 1 11 8 10\n\n            Output: 7\n\n        How 7? \n\n        They eat 7 candies in total: \n            Alice eats: [7,3,20] -> 30\n            Bob eats: [10,8,11,1] -> 10+8+11+1 = 30\n            Total candies: 3+4=7.\n\n        So the answer is 7.\n\n        The problem statement in the note says: \"the answer is 6\" -> but then it says \"because they eat six candies in total\" -> but 3+4=7.\n\n        So the note has a mistake? \n\n        Therefore, the sample test case [1,2,1] should output 2.\n\n        But the sample input in the problem statement for program1.py says the second test case is [1,2,1] and the output is 0? \n\n        This is an error in the problem statement? \n\n        Given the known problem (Codeforces 1669F), the sample input:\n\n            4\n            2\n            1 1\n            3\n            1 2 1\n            1\n            1\n            9\n            7 3 20 5 15 1 11 8 10\n\n        outputs:\n\n            2\n            2\n            0\n            7\n\n        So we should output 2 for [1,2,1].\n\n        Therefore, our algorithm works for [1,2,1]? \n\n        So we trust the algorithm? \n\n        For program1.py, the missing block is:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                total = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                l2.append(total)\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n\n        And we change the condition of the while loop? \n\n        But the condition is given as `while (p1-1<=p2)`, and we saw that it works for [1,1] and [1,2,1]? \n\n        So we leave the condition? \n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing block is:\n\n            total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\n            l2.append(total)\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        But note: the variable name is `l` for the list? \n\n        Yes.\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n        The code is:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())):\n                n = int(input())\n                if n == 1:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(\"1 2\")\n\n                elif n == 2:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(\"2 6\")\n\n                else:\n                    if n % 2 == 0:\n                        print(n // 2)\n                        for k in range((n // 2)):\n                            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n                    else:\n                        print(n // 2 + 1)\n                        for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to complete the TODO block for the odd case.\n\n        The problem: \n            We have a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. \n            We want to do the minimum number of swaps so that \"BAN\" is not a subsequence.\n\n        The sample: \n            n=1: swap indices 1 and 2 -> \"ABN\"\n            n=2: swap indices 2 and 6 -> \"BNNBAA\" -> but wait: \n                s(2) = \"BANBAN\"\n                swap index2 and index6: \n                    index: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:B, 5:A, 6:N\n                    swap index2 (A) and index6 (N) -> becomes: B, N, N, B, A, A -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n            How to avoid \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n                In \"BNNBAA\": \n                    B at index1, then we can find an A after? at index5, then an N after? but there is no N after index5? \n                    So we cannot form \"BAN\".\n\n        For the even case: \n            We do n//2 swaps.\n            For k in range(n//2):\n                swap (3*k+1) and (3*n - (3*k+1) + 1) \n                = swap (3*k+1) and (3*n - 3*k)\n\n            Example: n=2: \n                k=0: swap (1) and (3*2 - 0) = 6? -> swap index1 and index6? \n                But the sample swapped index2 and index6? \n\n            Let me check: \n                The indices: \n                    The first \"BAN\": \n                        B: index1, A: index2, N: index3\n                    The second \"BAN\":\n                        B: index4, A: index5, N: index6\n\n                The sample swapped index2 and index6: \n                    That is: A (index2) and N (index6) -> becomes: \n                        index1: B, index2: N, index3: N, index4: B, index5: A, index6: A -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n                But if we swap index1 and index6: \n                    index1: N, index2: A, index3: N, index4: B, index5: A, index6: B -> \"NANBAB\"\n                Then we can form \"BAN\": \n                    B at index4, A at index5, N at index3? -> but index3 is before index4? -> no, we need in increasing order? \n                    B at index4, A at index5, then we need an N after index5: index6 is B, then no N? \n                    But wait: we have an N at index1 and index3? but they are before index4? \n                    So we cannot form \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n\n                But the sample solution for n=2 was swapping index2 and index6? \n\n                The problem says: \"if there are multiple, output any\"\n\n            So both are valid? \n\n        For the even case, the code does:\n\n            for k in range(n//2):\n                ans = (3*k) + 1   # this is the index of the first character of the k-th \"BAN\": the 'B'? \n                but then they swap this index with (3*n - ans + 1) \n\n                For k=0: ans=1, then (3*n - 1 + 1) = 3*n -> so swap index1 and index(3*n)\n\n                For n=2: 3*2=6, so swap index1 and index6.\n\n                But the sample swapped index2 and index6? \n\n                Why? \n\n                The sample solution for n=2: \n                    print(\"2 6\")\n\n                So they swapped index2 and index6.\n\n                But the code for even case swaps index1 and index6.\n\n                This is different? \n\n                But both are valid? \n\n                The problem says: \"output any\"\n\n                So it's acceptable.\n\n        For the odd case: \n            We do n//2 + 1 swaps.\n\n            We have to output the swaps.\n\n            The TODO: for k in range((n//2)+1): \n                we have to output two indices.\n\n            What is the pattern? \n\n            We can do the same as the even case for the first n//2 swaps? and then one more swap? \n\n            But the sample for n=3: \n                s(3) = \"BANBANBAN\"\n\n                We need to do 2 swaps? \n\n                How about: \n                    swap1: k=0: swap index1 and index9 (3*3=9) -> \n                        becomes: swap B at1 and N at9: \n                            string: N, A, N, B, A, N, B, A, B\n                    swap2: k=1: swap index4 and index6? \n                        But the even case for k=1: \n                            ans = 3*1+1 = 4, then swap with 3*3 - 4 + 1 = 9-4+1=6? \n                        So swap index4 and index6: \n                            currently: \n                                index1: N, index2: A, index3: N, index4: B, index5: A, index6: N, index7: B, index8: A, index9: B\n                            swap index4 (B) and index6 (N): \n                                becomes: N, A, N, N, A, B, B, A, B\n\n                Now, can we form \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n                    We need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N' in increasing order.\n                    The first 'B' is at index6? then we need an 'A' after: index8 is 'A', then an 'N' after? but after index8: only index9 is 'B', no 'N'. \n                    Or a 'B' at index7: then 'A' at index8, then no 'N' after? \n                    Or a 'B' at index4: but then we can take 'A' at index5, then we need an 'N' after index5: index6 is 'B', then index7 is 'B', index8 is 'A', index9 is 'B' -> no 'N'. \n                    So it works.\n\n            But the sample for n=1 and n=2 are specific. \n\n            Alternatively, we can do the same pattern as the even case for the first n//2 swaps, and then for the last swap, we do something else? \n\n            But the code for even case does:\n\n                for k in range(n//2):\n                    a = 3*k+1\n                    b = 3*n - 3*k   # because (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k\n                    swap(a, b)\n\n            For the odd case, we do the same for k in range(n//2) [which is (n//2) swaps] and then one more swap? \n\n            What should the last swap be? \n\n            In the even case, we did n//2 swaps. In the odd case, we do n//2+1 swaps.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                for k in range(n//2):\n                    a = 3*k+1\n                    b = 3*n - 3*k\n                    print(a, b)\n\n                and then one more swap: what? \n\n            For n=3: \n                We do k=0: swap(1, 9) -> as above.\n                k=1: swap(4, 6) -> as above.\n                Then we need one more? \n\n            But we only need 2 swaps for n=3? \n\n            The code says: for k in range((n//2)+1): \n\n            So for n=3: n//2 = 1, so range(2): k=0 and k=1.\n\n            So we can do the same as the even case for k in range(n//2+1)? \n\n            For k=0: swap(1, 9)\n            For k=1: swap(4, 6)   # because 3*1+1=4, and 3*3 - 3*1 = 9-3=6? \n\n            But the even case formula: \n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k   # note: in the even case, they did: (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k\n\n            So for the odd case, we can use the same formula for k in range(n//2+1)? \n\n            But for k = n//2 (which is 1 for n=3) -> a=4, b=6 -> that is valid.\n\n            What about n=5? \n                n//2+1 = 3 swaps.\n                k=0: swap(1, 15)\n                k=1: swap(4, 12)\n                k=2: swap(7, 9)\n\n            How does the string become? \n                Initially: \n                    positions: \n                        1:B, 2:A, 3:N, 4:B, 5:A, 6:N, 7:B, 8:A, 9:N, 10:B, 11:A, 12:N, 13:B, 14:A, 15:N\n                After k=0: swap(1,15): \n                    1:N, 2:A, 3:N, 4:B, 5:A, 6:N, 7:B, 8:A, 9:N, 10:B, 11:A, 12:N, 13:B, 14:A, 15:B\n                After k=1: swap(4,12): \n                    4:N, 12:B -> \n                    now: \n                        1:N, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A, 6:N, 7:B, 8:A, 9:N, 10:B, 11:A, 12:B, 13:B, 14:A, 15:B\n                After k=2: swap(7,9): \n                    7:N, 9:B -> \n                    now: \n                        1:N, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A, 6:N, 7:B, 8:A, 9:N, 10:B, 11:A, 12:B, 13:B, 14:A, 15:B\n                    becomes: \n                        1:N, 2:A, 3:N, 4:N, 5:A, 6:N, 7:N, 8:A, 9:B, 10:B, 11:A, 12:B, 13:B, 14:A, 15:B\n\n            Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n                We need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N' in increasing order.\n                The 'B's are at indices: 9,10,12,13,15.\n                For a 'B' at 9: then we need an 'A' after 9: we have 'A' at 11 and 14. Then we need an 'N' after that? but after 11: we have no 'N'? \n                For a 'B' at 10: then 'A' at 11, then no 'N' after 11.\n                Similarly for others.\n\n            So it works.\n\n            Therefore, for the odd case, we can use the same formula as the even case for k in range(n//2+1):\n\n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k   # because (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k\n\n            But wait: in the even case, the code did:\n\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n            Let me compute: \n                (3 * n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k -1 +1 = 3*n - 3*k.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k\n\n            Then print(a, b)\n\n            But note: the indices are 1-indexed.\n\n            So for program2.py, the TODO block is:\n\n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k\n                print(a, b)\n\n            But wait: for k=0 in n=3: \n                a=1, b=9 -> that matches.\n\n            for k=1: a=4, b= 3*3 - 3*1 = 9-3=6 -> matches.\n\n            So we can use the same as the even case? \n\n            But the even case code:\n\n                for k in range((n // 2)):\n                    ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                    print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n            In the odd case, we do:\n\n                for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                    a = 3*k+1\n                    b = 3*n - 3*k   # which is the same as (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1? \n                    # because (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k -1 +1 = 3*n-3*k.\n\n            So we can write:\n\n                print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n            But the even case uses: (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k.\n\n            So it's the same.\n\n            Therefore, the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n                a = 3*k+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*k\n                print(a, b)\n\n            But we can do in one line: \n\n                print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n        So the code for the odd case:\n\n            else:\n                print(n//2+1)\n                for k in range((n//2)+1):\n                    print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n        But note: the indices must be distinct and within [1, 3*n]? \n\n        For k in [0, n//2] (inclusive), the indices:\n\n            a = 3*k+1: \n                k=0 -> 1\n                k=1 -> 4\n                ...\n                k = n//2 -> 3*(n//2)+1\n\n            b = 3*n - 3*k: \n                k=0 -> 3*n\n                k=1 -> 3*n-3\n                ...\n                k = n//2 -> 3*n - 3*(n//2)\n\n            For k = n//2: \n                a = 3*(n//2)+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*(n//2)\n\n            We need to ensure a < b? \n\n            For n=3: k=1: a=4, b=6 -> 4<6 -> valid.\n\n            For n=5: k=2: a=7, b=15-6=9 -> 7<9.\n\n            For k = n//2: \n                a = 3*(n//2)+1\n                b = 3*n - 3*(n//2) = 3*(n - n//2)\n\n            For n odd: n//2 = floor(n/2)\n                n=5: n//2=2, then a=3*2+1=7, b=3*5-3*2=15-6=9 -> 7<9.\n\n            For n=1: \n                n//2 = 0, then k in [0,0]: \n                    a=1, b=3*1 - 0 = 3 -> swap index1 and 3? \n                But the sample for n=1: \n                    if n==1: \n                        print(1)\n                        print(\"1 2\")\n\n                So we are printing \"1 3\", but the sample solution is \"1 2\".\n\n            Why? \n\n            The sample for n=1: \n                s(1)=\"BAN\" -> indices: 1:B, 2:A, 3:N.\n                swap(1,2): becomes: A, B, N -> \"ABN\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n                If we swap(1,3): becomes: N, A, B -> \"NAB\", which also does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n                But the problem says: \"if there are multiple, output any\"\n\n            So both are valid? \n\n            But the problem says: \"minimum number of operations\", and we are doing one swap? \n\n            So it's acceptable.\n\n            However, the sample solution for n=1 is \"1 2\", and for n=2 is \"2 6\", and for n>=3 we use the formula.\n\n            But the problem says: \"if there are multiple, output any\"\n\n            So we can output any valid solution.\n\n            Therefore, we can use the same formula for all k in the odd case.\n\n        But note: the even case for n=2: \n            k in range(1): \n                a=1, b=3*2 - 0? -> but the even case code: \n                    ans = 3*0+1=1\n                    then (3*2) - 1 + 1 = 6 -> so swap(1,6)\n\n            But the sample solution for n=2 was \"2 6\", but we are outputting \"1 6\".\n\n            And we argued that both are valid.\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, the missing block is:\n\n            print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n        But note: the even case uses: \n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        And (3 * n) - ans + 1 = 3*n - (3*k+1) + 1 = 3*n - 3*k.\n\n        So we can write: \n            print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n        But the even case code is already written? \n\n        So for the odd case, we do the same as the even case but for k in range(n//2+1)? \n\n        But the even case code is:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2)):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        And for the odd case, we do:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        That is, we can use the same print statement? \n\n        So we can write:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But the even case code is already written for the even case, and we are to complete the odd case? \n\n        The TODO is in the odd case block.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But the even case already defined a variable `ans`? \n\n        We can do the same.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            print(3*k+1, 3*n - 3*k)\n\n        But 3*n - 3*k is the same as (3*n) - (3*k+1) + 1? \n\n        So we can write either.\n\n        Let me choose the same as the even case for consistency.\n\n        So the missing block for program2.py is:\n\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But note: the even case uses the same variable name? \n\n        It's in a different scope? \n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        But we have to be careful: the even case code is:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2)):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        And the odd case:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        So it's symmetric.\n\n    Final answer:\n\n        program1: \n            total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\n            l2.append(total)\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n\n        program2:\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n    But note: the program1 code: we are using `l` for the list? \n\n    And in the program1, the list is called `l`? \n\n    Yes.\n\n    Format: \n        We output a json: \n        {\n            \"program1\": \"total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\\n        l2.append(total)\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n        }\n\n    But note: the indentation? \n\n    For program1: the block is inside the while loop and inside the if s1==s2. The existing code has the same indentation? \n\n    We output the code with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\n    For program1: the TODO is at the same indentation as the if block? \n\n    We output 4 lines? \n\n    For program2: the TODO is inside the for loop? \n\n    We output two lines? \n\n    But the program2 code for the even case has two lines: \n        ans = ... \n        print(...)\n\n    So we do the same.\n\n    Therefore, the answer is:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\\n        l2.append(total)\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"            ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n        }\n\n    But wait: the program1 code has the line: \n        if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We are to replace the TODO with the block? \n\n    So we remove the comment and put the block? \n\n    But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n    So we output the block of code that goes in that if block? \n\n    And for program2, the block that goes in the for loop? \n\n    But the program2 TODO is in a for loop? \n\n    We output the two lines? \n\n    However, the program2 code for the even case has:\n\n        for k in range((n // 2)):\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n    So for the odd case, we do the same? \n\n    But the program2 code for the odd case is:\n\n        else:\n            print(n // 2 + 1)\n            for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We replace the TODO with:\n\n        ans = (3 * k) + 1\n        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n    So the missing block is two lines? \n\n    But note: the even case has two lines? \n\n    So we output:\n\n        program2: \"ans = (3 * k) + 1\\nprint(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n    But the indentation: the for loop body is indented? \n\n    In the provided code, the for loop is:\n\n        for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n    So we output two lines with the same indentation? \n\n    We output:\n\n        \"            ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n    But the existing code in the even case has:\n\n        for k in range((n // 2)):\n            ans = (3 * k) + 1\n            print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n    And the odd case for loop is at the same indentation level? \n\n    So we output the same as the even case? \n\n    Alternatively, we can output without the extra indentation? \n\n    But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\"\n\n    We output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO? \n\n    The TODO is indented by 4 spaces? \n\n    We output:\n\n        \"ans = (3 * k) + 1\"\n        \"print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n    But we have to include the same indentation? \n\n    Since the for loop is already indented, and the TODO is at one more level, we output the two lines with that level of indentation? \n\n    But the problem does not specify the exact indentation? \n\n    However, to match the existing code, we output with 12 spaces? \n\n    But we don't know the exact indentation? \n\n    We can output without specifying the indentation? \n\n    But the program is in Python, so indentation matters.\n\n    We assume that the existing code has the for loop body indented by 4 or 8 spaces? \n\n    Looking at the provided code for program2.py:\n\n        for t in range(int(input())): \n            n = int(input())\n            if n == 1:\n                print(1)\n                print(\"1 2\")\n\n            elif n == 2:\n                print(1)\n                print(\"2 6\")\n\n            else:\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    print(n // 2)\n                    for k in range((n // 2)):\n                        ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n                else:\n                    print(n // 2 + 1)\n                    for k in range((n // 2) + 1):\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    The for loop in the else (odd) is at the same level as the for loop in the even case? \n\n    And the even case for loop body is indented by 8 spaces? (because the for loop is indented by 4 (from the else) and then the body by 4 more? \n\n    So the even case body is indented by 8 spaces? \n\n    Then the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n    So we output the two lines with 8 spaces? \n\n    But the program1.py block is also indented? \n\n    We output:\n\n        program1: \n            \"        total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\\n        l2.append(total)\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\"\n\n        This is 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        But the existing program1.py has:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        The if block is inside the while, so it should be indented. The existing code has the if condition at the same level as the while body? \n\n        We output 8 spaces? \n\n        But the existing code has the next line (if s1 < s2) at 8 spaces? \n\n        So we output the block at 8 spaces? \n\n        But the block has 4 lines? \n\n        We output each line with 8 spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we can output without the 8 spaces and let the existing indentation take over? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And the block is to be inserted at the TODO? \n\n        So we output the block as if we are writing at the same indentation level as the TODO? \n\n        The TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n        We output the block with 8 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify? \n\n        However, to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code\"\n\n        So we output the string with the newlines and the same indentation? \n\n        For program1, the block is 4 lines, each indented by 8 spaces? \n\n        But the existing code has the if condition at 8 spaces, and then the TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n        So we output:\n\n            \"        total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\\n        l2.append(total)\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\"\n\n        This has 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        For program2, we output:\n\n            \"        ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n        But wait, the even case in program2 has:\n\n            for k in range((n // 2)):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        The body is indented by 4 spaces? \n\n        But the code is:\n\n                    for k in range((n // 2)):\n                        ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        The for loop is inside an if and an else, so the for loop is at 12 spaces? and the body at 16 spaces? \n\n        Actually, let me count:\n\n            else:   # 8 spaces\n                if n % 2 == 0:   # 12 spaces\n                    ... # 16 spaces\n                else:   # 12 spaces\n                    ... # 16 spaces\n                    for k in ...:   # 16 spaces\n                        # TODO: 20 spaces?\n\n        But the provided code for the even case:\n\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    print(n // 2)\n                    for k in range((n // 2)):\n                        ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        The for loop body is indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n        So the body is at 16 spaces? \n\n        Then for the odd case, the for loop body should be at 16 spaces? \n\n        So we output for program2:\n\n            \"                ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n        But that is 16 spaces? \n\n        How many spaces? \n\n        The structure:\n\n            for t in range(int(input())):  # 0\n                n = int(input())   # 4\n                if n == 1:   # 4\n                    ...   # 8\n                elif n == 2:   # 4\n                    ...   # 8\n                else:   # 4\n                    if n % 2 == 0:   # 8\n                        ...   # 12\n                        for k in ...:   # 12\n                            ...   # 16\n                    else:   # 8\n                        ...   # 12\n                        for k in ...:   # 12\n                            ...   # 16   (the TODO)\n\n        So the TODO is at 16 spaces? \n\n        Then we output the two lines with 16 spaces? \n\n        But the even case body is at 16 spaces? \n\n        So we output:\n\n            program2: \n                \"                ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n        But that is 16 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        Alternatively, we can count the existing code in the even case: \n\n            for k in range((n // 2)):\n                ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        How many spaces before 'ans'? \n\n        In the provided code, it is:\n\n                        ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        So 20 spaces? \n\n        But the for loop is at 12 spaces? and the body is 16? \n\n        Actually, the provided code for the even case:\n\n                if n % 2 == 0:\n                    print(n // 2)\n                    for k in range((n // 2)):\n                        ans = (3 * k) + 1\n                        print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\n\n        The for loop is at 8 (from the if) + 4 = 12? and the body at 16? \n\n        So we output 16 spaces? \n\n        But the string would be:\n\n            \"                ans = ...\"\n\n        with 16 spaces.\n\n        But 16 spaces is 16 times ' '? \n\n        We can generate: \n\n            program2_code = \"                ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n        But note: the even case has the same? \n\n        So it's consistent.\n\n    Therefore, the final answer:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\\n        l2.append(total)\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"                ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n        }\n\n    But wait: in program1, the while loop body is already at 4 spaces? and the if block is at 8 spaces? \n\n    So we output the block for program1 at 8 spaces? \n\n    And for program2, at 16 spaces? \n\n    We output the string exactly as it should appear.\n\n    Let me write:\n\n        program1: \n            Line1: 8 spaces + \"total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\"\n            Line2: 8 spaces + \"l2.append(total)\"\n            Line3: 8 spaces + \"s1 += l[p1]\"\n            Line4: 8 spaces + \"p1 += 1\"\n\n        So the string: \n            \"        total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\\n        l2.append(total)\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\"\n\n        program2:\n            Line1: 16 spaces + \"ans = (3 * k) + 1\"\n            Line2: 16 spaces + \"print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n        So the string: \n            \"                ans = (3 * k) + 1\\n                print(ans, (3 * n) - ans + 1)\"\n\n    We output the json with these strings.\n\n    Note: the newline is represented as \"\\n\".\n\n    We output:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"        total = p1 + (n-1 - p2)\\n        l2.append(total)\\n        s1 += l[p1]\\n        p1 += 1\",\n            \"program2\":"
