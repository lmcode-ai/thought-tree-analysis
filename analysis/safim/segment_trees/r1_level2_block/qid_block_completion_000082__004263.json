Actually, if a is an integer, then ceil(a)=a, and if b>=a, then ceil(b)>=a. But since a is integer, ceil(b) is at least a, but could be a or more. However, note that if a<=b, then ceil(a) <= ceil(b) because if a is not integer, then ceil(a) = floor(a)+1, and since b>=a, then ceil(b) is at least ceil(a). Actually, if a<=b, then ceil(a) <= ceil(b) is true? Proof: \n   Let a, b be real numbers and a<=b. Let n = ceil(a). Then n-1 < a <= n. Since a<=b, then n-1 < a <= b, so ceil(b) is at least n. Therefore, ceil(a) <= ceil(b). Therefore, the function i -> ceil(S_i/t) is non-decreasing? But note: we are taking i from 1 to n, and S_i is non-decreasing. Therefore, the maximum of ceil(S_i/t) is at i=n: ceil(S_n/t). But wait: our earlier example: v = [100, 1, 1] with t=10: \n   S_1=100 -> ceil(100/10)=10\n   S_2=101 -> ceil(101/10)=11\n   S_3=102 -> ceil(102/10)=11 -> so the maximum is 11 at i=2 and i=3.

For t=7: ceil(15/7)=ceil(2.14...)=3 -> but the example says for the sixth query (which is t=5) we open 3 pipes, and for the fifth query (t=5) we open 4 pipes? Actually, the example says:\n\n        \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4.\"\n\n        So for t=5, the answer is 4?

But note: the condition for i=1: we require at least 10 pipes in the first lock? But we can only put 1 pipe at the first lock. So that condition is impossible? Actually, we have already checked that t>=minval. For this example, minval = max(100/1, 101/2, 102/3) = max(100, 50.5, 34) = 100. Since t=10<100, we would have printed -1. So the condition t>=minval ensures that for every i, S_i <= t * i? Actually, no: minval = max_i (S_i/i) = M, then for every i, S_i <= M * i. And if t>=M, then S_i <= t * i, so ceil(S_i/t) <= i (because S_i/t <= i, so ceil(S_i/t) <= i). Therefore, the condition that t>=minval ensures that ceil(S_i/t) <= i for every i, so we don't have an impossible condition for any segment.

Therefore, the maximum is always at i=n? Why? Because S_i <= S_n for all i, so S_i/t <= S_n/t, and then ceil(S_i/t) <= ceil(S_n/t). Therefore, the maximum is ceil(S_n/t)=ceil(T/t).

We have one pipe at lock1 and one at lock2 -> total 2 -> ok.\n            i=3: ceil(5/3)=2 -> we have 2 pipes in the entire system -> ok. So the maximum is 2. Therefore, the formula holds. However, note: the condition for the entire system is ceil(T/t)=ceil(5/3)=2, and that is the maximum over i? Actually, the condition for i=2 was also 2. So the maximum is 2.",

So after 4 seconds, lock1 has been full for 3 seconds, and lock4 becomes full at 4 seconds. So the note is not about the first lock requiring 4 seconds, but the fourth lock requiring 4 seconds. Then why is the answer for t=3 -1? Let me try to fill the system in 3 seconds with the minimum number of pipes for [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                Total water=14, so we need at least ceil(14/3)=5 pipes. But we only have 5 locks, so we can open 5 pipes. Now, can we fill the system in 3 seconds with 5 pipes? \n                    lock1: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters (>=1) -> full, overflows 2 to lock2.\n                    lock2: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters, plus 2 from lock1 -> 5 liters (>=2) -> full, overflows 3 to lock3. lock3: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters, plus 3 from lock2 -> 6 liters (>=2) -> full, overflows 4 to lock4.\n                    lock4: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters, plus 4 from lock3 -> 7 liters (>=4) -> full, overflows 3 to lock5.\n                    lock5: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters, plus 3 from lock4 -> 6 liters (>=5) -> full. So it works. Therefore, the answer for t=3 should be 5. But the example expected -1. I see the problem: the condition for the first lock is: we must have at least ceil(1/3)=1 pipe in the first lock -> we have one.\n            for the first two: ceil((1+2)/3)=ceil(3/3)=1 -> we have two pipes in the first two -> which is >=1 -> ok.\n            for the first three: ceil((1+2+2)/3)=ceil(5/3)=2 -> we have three pipes in the first three -> ok.\n            for the first four: ceil((1+2+2+4)/3)=ceil(9/3)=3 -> we have four pipes in the first four -> ok.\n            for the first five: ceil(14/3)=5 -> we have five pipes -> ok. So it is possible.",

Therefore, the sample input [1,2,2,4,5] for t=3 should be 5. But the example output says -1. I suspect the example input in the problem is [4,2,2,4,5] for the first lock=4. Let me assume that. Then for [4,2,2,4,5]:\n                T=17.\n                minval = max(4/1=4, (4+2)/2=3, (4+2+2)/3=8/3\u22482.66, (4+2+2+4)/4=12/4=3, (17/5=3.4) = 4. Then for t=3: 3<4 -> -1.\n                for t=4: ceil(17/4)=5.\n                for t=5: ceil(17/5)=4.\n                for t=6: ceil(17/6)=3.\n                for t=7: ceil(17/7)=3. But the example expected output for the sample is:\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            So for t=4: expected 3? -> but we got 5.\n            for t=5: expected 3 -> but we got 4.\n            for t=6: expected 3 -> matches.\n            for t=7: expected 3 -> matches. This does not match. I am confused. Let me read the sample input from the problem statement: \n                \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1<=ai<=10^9) \u2014 the array a.\"\n\n            And then: \n                \"In the next q lines you are given the descriptions of queries.",

We can put one pipe at lock1. i=2: ceil(3/5)=1 -> we must have at least 1 pipe in the first two locks.

Therefore, the sample input should be: \n                5\n                4 2 2 4 5\n                6\n                1\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n                7\n\n            Then:\n                T = 4+2+2+4+5 = 17.\n                minval = max(4/1=4, (4+2)/2=3, (4+2+2)/3=8/3\u22482.666, (4+2+2+4)/4=12/4=3, 17/5=3.4) = 4. Then for each query:\n                    t=1: 1<4 -> -1\n                    t=3: 3<4 -> -1\n                    t=4: 4>=4 -> ceil(17/4)=5 (because 17/4=4.25 -> ceil=5)\n                    t=5: ceil(17/5)=4 (because 17//5=3, remainder 2 -> 4)\n                    t=6: ceil(17/6)=3 (because 17//6=2, remainder 5 -> 3)\n                    t=7: ceil(17/7)=3 (because 17//7=2, remainder 3 -> 3) But the expected output is:\n                    -1\n                    -1\n                    -1\n                    3\n                    3\n                    3\n\n                So for t=4,5,6,7: we have 5,4,3,3, but expected 3 for the last three. How can the answer for t=4 be 3? We need 17 liters in 4 seconds with 3 pipes: 3*4=12 < 17 -> not enough water. Therefore, it must be that the sample input is [1,2,2,4,5] and the first lock is 1, and the minval is 2.8, and for t=3 the answer is 5, for t=5 the answer is 3. But the example output for the sample input is given as -1 for t=1,3,4 and 3 for t=5,6,7. For [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                t=1: 1<2.8 -> -1\n                t=3: 3>=2.8 -> 5\n                t=4: 4>=2.8 -> ceil(14/4)=4 (because 14//4=3, remainder 2 -> 4)\n                t=5: 3\n                t=6: 3\n                t=7: 3\n\n            This does not match the example output. I see the example output: -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            So the first three queries (t=1,3,4) are -1, and the last three (t=5,6,7) are 3. For [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                t=4: ceil(14/4)=4, not 3. How can the answer for t=4 be 3? We need 14 liters in 4 seconds with 3 pipes: 3*4=12 < 14 -> not enough. Therefore, it is impossible to use 3 pipes for t=4. The example output says 3 for t=4 is not given; it says -1 for t=4. The fourth query is t=5, not t=4. The queries are: \n                query1: t=1 -> -1\n                query2: t=3 -> -1\n                query3: t=4 -> -1\n                query4: t=5 -> 3\n                query5: t=6 -> 3\n                query6: t=7 -> 3\n\n            So for [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                t=1: 1<2.8 -> -1\n                t=3: 3>=2.8 -> ceil(14/3)=5 -> but the example expected -1 for the second query. This is a contradiction. After re-thinking the condition: \n                We must have t >= max_i (S_i / i)  (1)",

Therefore, the problem is: \n                We must have t >= minval, where minval = max_i (S_i / i)\n                and then the answer is ceil(T/t), BUT also we must ensure that ceil(S_i/t) < = i for every i? In this example, for t=5:\n                    i=1: ceil(5/5)=1<=1 -> ok.\n                    i=2: ceil(6/5)=2<=2 -> ok.\n                    i=3: ceil(7/5)=2<=3 -> ok.\n                    i=4: ceil(8/5)=2<=4 -> ok.\n                    i=5: ceil(15/5)=3<=5 -> ok. so it is possible. However, note that ceil(T/t) = 3, and we have 3 pipes. But is it sufficient to only ceil(T/t) and the minval condition? We argued that the minimum number of pipes is max_i ceil(S_i/t), and in this example:\n                    i=1: 1\n                    i=2: 2\n                    i=3: 2\n                    i=4: 2\n                    i=5: 3\n                so the maximum is 3. Therefore, the answer is 3. So the code is:\n                minval = 0\n                s = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += v[i]\n                    if s/(i+1) > minval:\n                        minval = s/(i+1)\n\n                for each query t:",

The entire system must be filled (each lock to its capacity) within t_j seconds.\n\nWe note:\n- The entire system requires a total of T = v1 + v2 + ... + vn liters.\n- However, because of the overflow, the time to fill the system is constrained by the fact that water must flow from left to right.\n\nKey observation:\nThe lock i cannot be filled until all the locks to the left of i are filled (because until then, the water that enters the left locks will overflow to the right). Therefore, the time to fill the system is at least the maximum over i of (S_i / i), where S_i = v1 + v2 + ... + v_i.\n\nWhy? Consider the first i locks. The total water that must go into these locks is S_i. Since we can have at most i pipes contributing to the first i locks (because a pipe at a lock j>i doesn't help the first i locks until the locks j-1 are full, but by then the first i locks must be full already), the time required is at least S_i / i.\n\nTherefore, the minimum time required to fill the entire system (if we use k pipes) is at least max_i (S_i / i). But note: we can choose which locks to put the pipes arbitrarily. However, the problem asks: for a given time t_j, what is the minimum number of pipes needed so that the entire system is filled by time t_j?\n\nWe note:\n- The total water required is T = S_n (the sum of all volumes).\n- In t seconds, we can pour at most k * t liters. Therefore, we must have k * t >= T. This is a necessary condition.\n\nBut also, we have the constraint from the chain: the time must be at least max_i (S_i / i). Actually, we can generalize: for the first i locks, the total water that must be in them is S_i. The water that ends up in the first i locks can come from any pipe at or to the left of i. However, note that water from a pipe at a lock j (j>i) does not contribute to the first i locks until the locks j-1 are full. Therefore, the water that ends up in the first i locks must come from the pipes that are at locks 1 to i. Let k_i be the number of pipes we have in the first i locks. Then the amount of water that can be delivered to the first i locks in time t is k_i * t. However, note that water that overflows from the first i locks goes to the right and doesn't help the first i locks. Therefore, we must have k_i * t >= S_i.\n\nBut note: we can choose the k pipes arbitrarily. However, if we put a pipe at a lock j (j>i), it doesn't help the first i locks until the entire chain from j to i is full? Actually, no: the water from a pipe at j>i will only start contributing to the first i locks after the entire segment from j down to i+1 is full. Therefore, in time t, the water that actually ends up in the first i locks is at most the water from the pipes in the first i locks (because the pipes beyond i haven't contributed to the first i locks until the locks between them and i are full, which might not happen until after time t). Therefore, the condition for the first i locks is: the number of pipes in the first i locks (call it k_i) must satisfy k_i * t >= S_i.\n\nBut note: we are free to assign the pipes arbitrarily. Therefore, for the entire system to be filled in time t, we must have for every i (1<=i<=n): the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(S_i / t). However, note that the pipes we put beyond i do not help the first i locks until the locks after i are full, which might take more time. Therefore, the condition is that the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(S_i / t). Then the total number of pipes k must be at least max_i { ceil(S_i / t) }.\n\nBut wait: is that sufficient? \nConsider: if we put k_i = ceil(S_i / t) pipes in the first i locks, then the water delivered to the first i locks in time t is at least k_i * t >= S_i. However, note that the pipes we put in the first i locks also help the later locks? Actually, no: the water from a pipe in the first i locks that overflows from the first i locks goes to the next locks. But we are only concerned with the first i locks: we need exactly S_i liters to be retained in the first i locks. The overflow is not counted for the first i locks. Therefore, the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of pipes k required for time t is:\n   k_min = max( ceil(S_1/t), ceil(S_2/t), ..., ceil(S_n/t) )\n\nBut note: we must also have k_min * t >= T (the total water) because the entire system requires T liters. However, note that T = S_n, so the condition for i=n is ceil(S_n/t) = ceil(T/t). And since k_min >= ceil(T/t), then k_min * t >= T is automatically satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the answer for a query t is:\n   k_min = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / t)\n\nHowever, note: if t is less than the minimum time (which we computed as minval = max_i (S_i / i)), then it's impossible. We already have a check for that: if t < minval then print -1.\n\nBut note: minval is defined as max_i (S_i / i). However, note that ceil(S_i/t) is defined only for t>0. And if t < minval, then there exists an i such that S_i / i > t, so S_i > t * i. Then ceil(S_i/t) > i. But note: we cannot have more than i pipes in the first i locks? Actually, we can have at most i pipes in the first i locks. Therefore, if ceil(S_i/t) > i, then it's impossible? \n\nBut wait: our condition for the first i locks requires that the number of pipes in the first i locks is at least ceil(S_i/t). However, we cannot put more than i pipes in the first i locks. Therefore, if ceil(S_i/t) > i, then it's impossible. And note: if t < minval, then for some i we have S_i > t * i, so ceil(S_i/t) >= floor(S_i/t)+1 > i (because S_i/t > i => floor(S_i/t) >= i? not exactly: if S_i/t > i, then ceil(S_i/t) might be i+1, which is greater than i). Therefore, we must check: if for any i, ceil(S_i/t) > i, then it's impossible? Actually, we already have the condition that t < minval (which is max_i (S_i/i)) implies that for that i, S_i > t * i, so ceil(S_i/t) > i. Therefore, we can use the minval condition to rule out the impossible cases.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"if it is impossible to fill all of the locks in given time, print -1\". So we have:\n\n   if t < minval: print -1\n   else: k_min = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / t)\n\nHowever, note: we must compute k_min efficiently. Since n and q can be up to 200,000, we cannot iterate over i for each query.\n\nHow to compute k_min = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / t) quickly?\n\nNote: ceil(S_i / t) = floor((S_i - 1) / t) + 1.\n\nBut note: we are taking the maximum over i of ceil(S_i/t). Since S_i is the prefix sum, and the array v_i is positive, S_i is non-decreasing. However, note that the function ceil(S_i/t) is not necessarily monotonic? Actually, as i increases, S_i increases, but the denominator is fixed. So ceil(S_i/t) is non-decreasing? Not exactly: consider t fixed. Then as S_i increases, ceil(S_i/t) is non-decreasing. Therefore, the maximum would be at i=n: ceil(S_n/t). But wait: that is not true. Consider:\n\n   v = [3, 1, 1], then:\n      S_1 = 3, S_2 = 4, S_3 = 5.\n   Let t=2:\n      ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2\n      ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2\n      ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3\n\n   So the maximum is 3 at i=3.\n\nBut also consider i=1: ceil(3/2)=2, which is less than 3.\n\nSo the maximum is at i=n? Not necessarily: what if we have a very large v1 and then small ones? \n\nExample: v = [100, 1, 1], t=10.\n   S_1 = 100 -> ceil(100/10)=10\n   S_2 = 101 -> ceil(101/10)=11\n   S_3 = 102 -> ceil(102/10)=11.\n\nSo the maximum is 11 at i=2 and i=3.\n\nBut note: the condition for i=1: we require at least 10 pipes in the first lock? But we can only put 1 pipe at the first lock. So that condition is impossible? Actually, we have already checked that t>=minval. For this example, minval = max(100/1, 101/2, 102/3) = max(100, 50.5, 34) = 100. Since t=10<100, we would have printed -1.\n\nSo the condition t>=minval ensures that for every i, S_i <= t * i? Actually, no: minval = max_i (S_i/i) = M, then for every i, S_i <= M * i. And if t>=M, then S_i <= t * i, so ceil(S_i/t) <= i (because S_i/t <= i, so ceil(S_i/t) <= i). Therefore, the condition that t>=minval ensures that ceil(S_i/t) <= i for every i, so we don't have an impossible condition for any segment.\n\nBut note: the condition for the entire system is that we must have at least ceil(S_n/t) pipes. And we can put at most n pipes. Since ceil(S_n/t) <= n (because t>=minval and minval>= S_n/n, so S_n/t <= n, then ceil(S_n/t)<=n), it is possible.\n\nTherefore, we can compute:\n   k_min = max_{i=1}^{n} ceil(S_i / t)\n\nBut note: since S_i is increasing, and the function f(i)=ceil(S_i/t) is not necessarily monotonic? Actually, because S_i is increasing, then for i1 < i2, S_i1 <= S_i2, so ceil(S_i1/t) <= ceil(S_i2/t) is not necessarily true? \n\nExample: \n   v = [1, 3], t=2.\n   S_1 = 1 -> ceil(1/2)=1\n   S_2 = 4 -> ceil(4/2)=2 -> so increasing.\n\nBut consider:\n   v = [3, 1], t=2.\n   S_1 = 3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n   S_2 = 4 -> ceil(4/2)=2 -> same.\n\nAnother example:\n   v = [2, 1, 1], t=2.\n   S_1=2 -> ceil(2/2)=1\n   S_2=3 -> ceil(3/2)=2\n   S_3=4 -> ceil(4/2)=2 -> so non-decreasing? \n\nActually, since S_i is non-decreasing, then S_i/t is non-decreasing, and the ceiling of a non-decreasing function is non-decreasing? Not exactly: consider two numbers a and b with a<=b. Then ceil(a) <= ceil(b)? Not necessarily: if a=1.5 and b=1.6, then ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2 -> same. But if a=1.9 and b=2.0, then ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2. If a=1.1 and b=1.9, then ceil(a)=2, ceil(b)=2. The only problem is when a is an integer and b is the next integer? Actually, if a is an integer, then ceil(a)=a, and if b>=a, then ceil(b)>=a. But since a is integer, ceil(b) is at least a, but could be a or more. However, note that if a<=b, then ceil(a) <= ceil(b) because if a is not integer, then ceil(a) = floor(a)+1, and since b>=a, then ceil(b) is at least ceil(a). Actually, if a<=b, then ceil(a) <= ceil(b) is true? \n\nProof: \n   Let a, b be real numbers and a<=b.\n   Let n = ceil(a). Then n-1 < a <= n. Since a<=b, then n-1 < a <= b, so ceil(b) is at least n. Therefore, ceil(a) <= ceil(b).\n\nTherefore, the function i -> ceil(S_i/t) is non-decreasing? But note: we are taking i from 1 to n, and S_i is non-decreasing. Therefore, the maximum of ceil(S_i/t) is at i=n: ceil(S_n/t). \n\nBut wait: our earlier example: v = [100, 1, 1] with t=10: \n   S_1=100 -> ceil(100/10)=10\n   S_2=101 -> ceil(101/10)=11\n   S_3=102 -> ceil(102/10)=11 -> so the maximum is 11 at i=2 and i=3.\n\nBut note: 11>10, so the maximum is 11. And since the function is non-decreasing, the maximum is at the last index? Actually, no: the function is non-decreasing? Then the maximum is at the last index. But in this example, the last index has 11 and the first index has 10, so the maximum is at the last index? Actually, the last index has 11 and the second index also has 11. So the maximum is 11 and it occurs at the last index? Actually, the last index has the same value as the second. So the maximum is at the last index? \n\nBut note: the function is non-decreasing, so the maximum is at the last index. Therefore, we can simply compute ceil(S_n/t) and that would be the answer? \n\nBut wait: what if the maximum occurs at an earlier index? \n\nExample: \n   v = [1, 100, 1], t=10.\n   S_1=1 -> ceil(1/10)=1\n   S_2=101 -> ceil(101/10)=11\n   S_3=102 -> ceil(102/10)=11.\n\nThe maximum is 11 at i=2 and i=3. So the maximum is at the last index? Yes, because the last index has 11. \n\nBut what if we have:\n   v = [1, 100, 1, 1000], t=10.\n   S_1=1 -> 1\n   S_2=101 -> 11\n   S_3=102 -> 11\n   S_4=1102 -> ceil(1102/10)=111.\n\nSo the maximum is 111 at i=4.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of the non-decreasing sequence is at the last element. So we can just compute ceil(S_n/t) and that is the answer?\n\nBut wait: what if the maximum is not at the last element? \n\nConsider: \n   v = [1, 100, 1, 1], t=10.\n   S_1=1 -> 1\n   S_2=101 -> 11\n   S_3=102 -> 11\n   S_4=103 -> ceil(103/10)=11.\n\nSo the maximum is 11, which occurs at i=2,3,4. But the last element is 11. So we can take the last element.\n\nTherefore, the maximum of the non-decreasing sequence is the last element. So k_min = ceil(S_n/t) = ceil(T/t).\n\nBut wait: what about the example in the problem?\n\nExample from the problem: \n   The first example test: \n        n=5, volumes: [1,2,3,4,5] -> total T=15.\n        queries: 1,3,4,5,6,7.\n\n   We know that for t=5: the answer is 3? But let's compute:\n        k_min = ceil(15/5)=ceil(3)=3 -> so that matches.\n\n   For t=6: ceil(15/6)=ceil(2.5)=3 -> matches.\n\n   For t=7: ceil(15/7)=ceil(2.14...)=3 -> but the example says for the sixth query (which is t=5) we open 3 pipes, and for the fifth query (t=5) we open 4 pipes? Actually, the example says:\n\n        \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4.\"\n\n        So for t=5, the answer is 4? \n\n   But wait, the example says: \n        \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\"\n\n        So for t=5, the sixth query? Actually, the problem says:\n\n        \"The third line contains one integer q (1<=q<=200000) \u2014 the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains one integer t_j\"\n\n        And the example input: \n           5\n           1 2 3 4 5\n           6\n           1\n           3\n           4\n           5\n           6\n           7\n\n        So the fifth query is t=5, and the sixth is t=6.\n\n        The example says: \n            In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1.\n\n        Then for t=5: the answer is 4? But our formula gives ceil(15/5)=3.\n\n        Why 4? \n\n   Let me reexamine the problem: \n        The answer for a query t is the minimum number of pipes so that after t seconds, all locks are filled.\n\n        How do we compute for t=5?\n\n        We have locks: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n        We open 3 pipes: at locks 1, 3, 4. \n        After 5 seconds:\n            Lock1: gets 5 liters -> full (1 liter) and overflows 4 liters to lock2.\n            Lock3: gets 5 liters -> full (3 liters) and overflows 2 liters to lock4.\n            Lock4: gets 5 liters (from its own pipe) plus 2 liters from lock3 -> 7 liters, which is more than 4? Actually, lock4 has volume 4, so it becomes full and overflows 3 liters to lock5.\n            Lock2: gets 4 liters from lock1 -> but lock2 has volume 2, so it becomes full and overflows 2 liters to lock3. But lock3 is already full? Then the overflow from lock2 goes to lock3, which is full, so it goes to lock4? But lock4 is also full, so it goes to lock5.\n\n            Lock5: gets 3 liters (from lock4) and 2 liters (from lock2 via lock3 and lock4) -> total 5 liters? But wait, the overflow from lock1 to lock2 is 4 liters, which fills lock2 (2 liters) and then 2 liters go to lock3. Lock3 is already full (from its own pipe) so the 2 liters go to lock4. Lock4 is already full (from its own pipe and the 2 from lock3) so the 2 liters go to lock5. Then lock5 gets 5 liters? \n\n        Actually, the water from the pipe at lock1: 5 liters -> lock1: 1 used, 4 to lock2.\n        lock2: gets 4 liters -> uses 2, then 2 to lock3.\n        lock3: gets 5 (from its own pipe) and 2 (from lock2) -> total 7? But wait, the pipe at lock3 is adding 5 liters? Actually, the pipe at lock3 is adding 1 liter per second for 5 seconds -> 5 liters. Then the water from lock2 (2 liters) comes in. So lock3 gets 5+2=7 liters. But lock3 only holds 3, so it overflows 4 liters to lock4. \n        lock4: gets 5 (from its own pipe) and 4 (from lock3) -> 9 liters. It only holds 4, so it overflows 5 to lock5.\n        lock5: gets 5 (from lock4) -> which is exactly 5.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, 3 pipes are sufficient for t=5.\n\n        Then why does the example say for the fifth query (t=5) we open 4 pipes? \n\n        Actually, the example says: \n            \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4.\"\n\n        But it doesn't say that 4 is the minimum. The minimum for t=5 is 3. \n\n        The problem says: \"the minimum number of pipes to open\".\n\n        So the answer for t=5 should be 3.\n\n        And the example output: \n            -1\n            -1\n            -1\n            3\n            3\n            3\n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.\" -> so the sixth query (t=6) is 3? \n\n        But wait: if we open 3 pipes at locks 1,3,4 for t=6 seconds, then:\n            lock1: 6 liters -> 1 used, 5 to lock2.\n            lock2: 5 liters -> 2 used, 3 to lock3.\n            lock3: 6 (from pipe) + 3 (from lock2) = 9 -> 3 used, 6 to lock4.\n            lock4: 6 (from pipe) + 6 (from lock3) = 12 -> 4 used, 8 to lock5 -> lock5 gets 8, but only needs 5 -> so it works.\n\n        But is 3 the minimum for t=6? \n            We have total water 15, and 3*6=18>=15, and the condition for the segments: \n                i=1: ceil(1/6)=1 -> ok\n                i=2: ceil((1+2)/6)=ceil(3/6)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> ok\n                i=3: ceil(6/6)=1 -> ok\n                i=4: ceil(10/6)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> so we need at least 2 pipes in the first 4 locks? \n                i=5: ceil(15/6)=ceil(2.5)=3.\n\n            So the maximum is 3. Therefore, 3 is the minimum.\n\n        Then why does the example say for the fifth query (t=5) we open 4 pipes? \n\n        Actually, the example input has 6 queries: \n           1\n           3\n           4\n           5\n           6\n           7\n\n        The answers: \n           t=1 -> -1\n           t=3 -> -1\n           t=4 -> -1\n           t=5 -> 3\n           t=6 -> 3\n           t=7 -> 3\n\n        But the example says: \n            \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4\" -> that would be for t=5? But the fifth query is t=5, and the minimum is 3, so why say 4? \n\n        The example is just illustrating that one can open 4 pipes and it would work, but the minimum is 3.\n\n        Therefore, our formula: \n            if t < minval: -1\n            else: ceil(T / t)   [because the maximum of ceil(S_i/t) is ceil(S_n/t) = ceil(T/t)]\n\n        But wait: what about the condition for the intermediate segments? \n\n        We argued that the condition is: for every i, the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(S_i/t). And we said that the maximum of ceil(S_i/t) is ceil(T/t). But that is not true: in the example for t=5, we have:\n            i=1: ceil(1/5)=1\n            i=2: ceil(3/5)=1\n            i=3: ceil(6/5)=ceil(1.2)=2\n            i=4: ceil(10/5)=2\n            i=5: ceil(15/5)=3\n\n        So the maximum is 3. \n\n        But note: the condition for the entire system (i=5) is 3, which is the maximum. \n\n        However, consider the example: \n            v = [3,1,1], t=2 -> we computed: \n                i=1: ceil(3/2)=2\n                i=2: ceil(4/2)=2\n                i=3: ceil(5/2)=3 -> so the maximum is 3.\n\n        But note: the total T=5, ceil(5/2)=3 -> same.\n\n        Therefore, it seems that the maximum is always at i=n? \n\n        Why? Because S_i is increasing and the ceiling function is non-decreasing, so the last element is the largest. \n\n        Therefore, we can compute for each query:\n            if t < minval: print -1\n            else: print ceil(T/t)\n\n        But wait: what if there is an i such that ceil(S_i/t) > ceil(T/t)? \n        Example: \n            v = [100, 1, 1] -> T=102, minval = max(100, 101/2, 102/3)=100.\n            For t=101: \n                ceil(100/101)=1\n                ceil(101/101)=ceil(1)=1\n                ceil(102/101)=ceil(1.01)=2 -> so the maximum is 2.\n\n            But ceil(T/t)=ceil(102/101)=2 -> same.\n\n        Therefore, the maximum is always at i=n? \n\n        Why? Because S_i <= S_n for all i, so S_i/t <= S_n/t, and then ceil(S_i/t) <= ceil(S_n/t). \n\n        Therefore, the maximum is ceil(S_n/t)=ceil(T/t).\n\n        So the answer for a query t is:\n            if t < minval: -1\n            else: ceil(T/t)\n\n        But wait: the example in the problem says for t=5, the answer is 3, and ceil(15/5)=3 -> matches.\n\n        However, let me test with the example that had a non-last maximum: \n            v = [3,1,1] (n=3, T=5), minval = max(3, 4/2=2, 5/3\u22481.66) = 3.\n            For t=2: \n                t=2 < minval=3 -> so we output -1? \n            But wait, minval=3, so t=2<3 -> -1. \n\n        But what if t=3? \n            Then ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2.\n\n        How can we do it with 2 pipes? \n            We open two pipes: say at lock1 and lock3.\n            After 3 seconds:\n                lock1: 3 (from pipe) -> full, overflows 0? (because 3 liters exactly) -> no overflow? \n                lock3: 3 (from pipe) -> but lock3 has volume 1, so it gets 1 liter and overflows 2 to lock4? but there is no lock4. \n                lock2: gets nothing? \n\n            So lock2 is not filled.\n\n            Alternatively, open at lock1 and lock2:\n                lock1: 3 seconds -> 3 liters (full) -> overflows 0? \n                lock2: 3 seconds -> 3 liters -> but volume is 1, so it becomes full and overflows 2 to lock3 -> lock3 gets 2 liters (which is more than 1) -> so lock3 becomes full.\n\n            So it works.\n\n            Therefore, the answer for t=3 is 2.\n\n            Our formula: ceil(5/3)=ceil(1.66)=2 -> matches.\n\n        But note: we must check the condition for the segments? \n            i=1: ceil(3/3)=1 -> we have 1 pipe in the first lock -> ok.\n            i=2: ceil((3+1)/3)=ceil(4/3)=ceil(1.33)=2 -> we must have at least 2 pipes in the first two locks. We have one pipe at lock1 and one at lock2 -> total 2 -> ok.\n            i=3: ceil(5/3)=2 -> we have 2 pipes in the entire system -> ok.\n\n        So the maximum is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the formula holds.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the entire system is ceil(T/t)=ceil(5/3)=2, and that is the maximum over i? Actually, the condition for i=2 was also 2. So the maximum is 2.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is ceil(T/t) and we don't need to iterate over i.\n\n        But wait: what if we have a scenario where the maximum is not at i=n? \n            v = [1, 100], t=100 -> \n                minval = max(1, 101/2)=50.5 -> so t=100>=50.5 -> possible.\n                T=101, ceil(101/100)=2.\n                Now check the segments:\n                    i=1: ceil(1/100)=1\n                    i=2: ceil(101/100)=2 -> so the maximum is 2.\n\n        So it is always the last segment that gives the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, we can compute:\n\n            n = int(lines[0])\n            v = list(map(int, lines[1].split()))\n            T = sum(v)\n            # Precompute minval = max_i (S_i / i) for i in [1, n]\n            minval = 0\n            s = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                s += v[i]\n                # i is from 0 to n-1 -> the prefix for the first i+1 elements\n                # so the segment index is i+1\n                if s / (i+1) > minval:\n                    minval = s / (i+1)\n\n            q = int(lines[2])\n            for j in range(q):\n                t = int(lines[3+j])\n                if t < minval:\n                    print(-1)\n                else:\n                    # Compute ceil(T/t)\n                    # If T % t == 0 then ceil(T/t)=T//t, else T//t + 1\n                    if T % t == 0:\n                        print(T // t)\n                    else:\n                        print(T//t + 1)\n\n        However, note: minval is a float. We are comparing t (an integer) with minval (a float). But note that minval might not be an integer. \n\n        But the problem says: if t < minval, then print -1. Since minval is the maximum of S_i/i, which might be fractional, and t is integer, we can do:\n\n            if t < minval: ...\n\n        But note: if minval is 50.5 and t=50, then 50<50.5 -> true -> -1.\n        if t=51, then 51>=50.5 -> false -> then we compute ceil(T/t).\n\n        However, what if minval is an integer? For example, if minval=100, then t=100 is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the condition for the segment that gives minval: say i0, then S_{i0} = minval * i0. Then for t = minval, we have ceil(S_{i0}/t) = ceil(minval * i0 / minval) = ceil(i0) = i0. And we can have at most i0 pipes in the first i0 locks, so it's acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            n = int(lines[0])\n            v = list(map(int, lines[1].split()))\n            T = sum(v)\n            minval = 0\n            s = 0\n            for i in range(n):\n                s += v[i]\n                # For the segment [0:i] (i+1 elements)\n                # The average is s/(i+1)\n                if s/(i+1) > minval:\n                    minval = s/(i+1)\n\n            q = int(lines[2])\n            out_lines = []\n            for j in range(q):\n                t = int(lines[3+j])\n                if t < minval:\n                    out_lines.append(\"-1\")\n                else:\n                    # Compute ceil(T/t)\n                    # But note: T and t are integers, so:\n                    #   if T % t == 0 -> T//t, else T//t + 1\n                    # However, note: if T==0 then ... but T>=n (since each v_i>=1) so T>=n>=1.\n                    if T % t == 0:\n                        out_lines.append(str(T//t))\n                    else:\n                        out_lines.append(str(T//t + 1))\n\n            print(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\n        But wait: the example input:\n\n            \"5\"\n            \"1 2 3 4 5\"\n            \"6\"\n            \"1\"\n            \"3\"\n            \"4\"\n            \"5\"\n            \"6\"\n            \"7\"\n\n        We compute:\n            T = 15\n            minval: \n                i0=0: s=1 -> 1/1=1 -> minval=1\n                i0=1: s=3 -> 3/2=1.5 -> minval=1.5\n                i0=2: s=6 -> 6/3=2 -> minval=2\n                i0=3: s=10 -> 10/4=2.5 -> minval=2.5\n                i0=4: s=15 -> 15/5=3 -> minval=3\n\n            Then queries:\n                t=1: 1<3 -> -1\n                t=3: 3<3? -> no, 3>=3 -> then ceil(15/3)=5 -> but wait, 15/3=5 -> ceil=5.\n\n            But the example expected for t=3: -1? \n\n            Why? Because minval=3, and t=3 is not less than minval? \n\n            However, the example says the first three queries (t=1,3,4) are -1. \n\n            But our minval=3, so t=3 is acceptable? \n\n            What's the issue?\n\n            The condition: minval = max_i (S_i / i) = 3. Then for the segment i=5: we have S_5=15, and 15/5=3 -> so we require at least ceil(15/3)=5 pipes? But we only have 5 locks. So we can put 5 pipes. \n\n            However, the problem says: \"if it is impossible to fill all of the locks in given time, print -1\". \n\n            Why is t=3 impossible? \n\n            Let me simulate for t=3:\n                We have 5 locks: [1,2,3,4,5]\n                We need to fill 15 liters in 3 seconds. We can open at most 5 pipes.\n\n                How much water can we pour? 5*3=15 -> exactly.\n\n                But the catch: the water must flow from left to right. \n\n                Condition for the first lock: we must have at least ceil(1/3)=1 pipe in the first lock -> we can put one pipe at lock1 -> then lock1 gets 3 liters -> full (1 liter) and overflows 2 liters to lock2.\n\n                Condition for the first two locks: we need at least ceil((1+2)/3)=ceil(3/3)=1 pipe in the first two locks? But we have one pipe at lock1 and we can put one at lock2? Actually, we can put one at lock2. But note: the condition is the number of pipes in the first two locks must be at least 1 -> we have one (at lock1) -> so that's 1 -> ok.\n\n                However, the water in the first two locks: \n                    lock1: 3 liters -> 1 used, 2 to lock2.\n                    lock2: we have a pipe at lock2: 3 liters, plus 2 from lock1 -> total 5 liters -> which is more than 2, so lock2 becomes full and overflows 3 to lock3.\n\n                Condition for the first three locks: we need at least ceil((1+2+3)/3)=ceil(6/3)=2 pipes in the first three locks. We have one at lock1 and one at lock2 -> total 2 -> ok.\n\n                Then lock3: gets 3 (from pipe at lock3) and 3 (from lock2) -> 6 liters -> which is more than 3, so full and overflows 3 to lock4.\n\n                Condition for the first four locks: ceil(10/3)=ceil(3.33)=4? -> wait, 10/3\u22483.33 -> ceil=4. But we only have 2 pipes in the first four locks? (one at lock1, one at lock2, and one at lock3? we haven't assigned lock3's pipe? Actually, we have a pipe at lock3, so that's 3 pipes? \n\n                How many pipes do we have? We have 5 pipes: one at each lock. \n\n                But the condition for the first four locks: we have pipes at lock1, lock2, lock3, and lock4? -> that's 4 pipes. So 4>=ceil(10/3)=4 -> ok.\n\n                Then lock4: gets 3 (from pipe) and 3 (from lock3) -> 6 liters -> which is more than 4, so full and overflows 2 to lock5.\n\n                lock5: gets 3 (from pipe) and 2 (from lock4) -> 5 liters -> full.\n\n                So it works.\n\n            Therefore, the answer for t=3 should be 5? \n\n            But the example says -1.\n\n            Why? \n\n            The problem says: \"The mayor of Divanovo is interested in q independent queries. For each query, suppose that initially all locks are empty and all pipes are closed. Then, some pipes are opened simultaneously. For the j-th query the mayor asks you to calculate the minimum number of pipes to open so that all locks are filled no later than after t_j seconds.\"\n\n            The minimum number of pipes for t=3: we just did it with 5 pipes. But is there a way with fewer? \n\n            We know that the total water is 15, and we have 3 seconds, so we need at least ceil(15/3)=5 pipes. So 5 is the minimum.\n\n            Then why the example says -1 for t=3? \n\n            Let me check the example note: \n                \"In the queries 1,3,4 the answer is -1\"\n\n            And the example input: \n                1\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n                7\n\n            So the second query is t=3, and the example says -1.\n\n            But we just showed that 5 pipes work.\n\n            The problem says: \"if it is impossible to fill all of the locks in given time, print -1\". \n\n            It is not impossible? \n\n            I see the issue: the condition minval=3, and we have t=3, but we also have the condition for the first lock: we need at least ceil(1/3)=1 pipe -> which we have. \n            for the first two: ceil(3/3)=1 -> we have 1 pipe in the first two? Actually, we have one pipe in lock1 and one in lock2 -> that's 2 pipes in the first two locks. But the condition only requires 1. \n\n            The condition is: the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(S_i/t). For i=1: ceil(1/3)=1 -> we have 1 pipe in the first lock? (if we put a pipe at lock1) -> yes. \n            for i=2: ceil(3/3)=1 -> we have 2 pipes in the first two locks -> which is more than 1 -> ok.\n\n            for i=3: ceil(6/3)=2 -> we have 3 pipes in the first three locks -> ok.\n\n            for i=4: ceil(10/3)=4 -> we have 4 pipes in the first four locks? (if we put pipes at lock1, lock2, lock3, lock4) -> yes, 4 pipes -> ok.\n\n            for i=5: ceil(15/3)=5 -> we have 5 pipes -> ok.\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n            But the example output is -1 for t=3? \n\n            I suspect the example input is not [1,2,3,4,5] for the first test? \n\n            The problem says: \n                \"There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1, 3, 4 the answer is -1. We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n\n            This note: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\" -> meaning that the first lock has volume 4? \n\n            Let me re-read the example: \n                \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4.

After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full.\"\n\n            This suggests that lock1 has volume 4? because it took 4 seconds to fill lock1? \n\n            But the input example: \n                \"5\"\n                \"1 2 2 4 5\"\n\n            So lock1=1, lock2=2, lock3=2, lock4=4, lock5=5.\n\n            How does lock1 get filled in 4 seconds? \n                If we open a pipe at lock1, then after 1 second, lock1 is full. \n\n            The example says: after 4 seconds, lock1 and lock4 are full. \n\n            So lock1 is full after 1 second, not 4.\n\n            I think the example input is not [1,2,2,4,5] for the sample that has the note about 4 seconds. \n\n            Let me read the sample input from the problem: \n                \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1<=ai<=10^9) \u2014 the array a.\"\n\n            And the sample: \n                \"5\"\n                \"1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n            Then the note: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\" -> that doesn't match because the first lock is 1.\n\n            I see the example has two different examples. The first example is the one with [1,2,3,4,5] and the second example is the one with the picture and [1,2,2,4,5]. \n\n            The sample input provided after the note is: \n                5\n                1 2 2 4 5\n                6\n                1\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n                7\n\n            And the expected output: \n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            So for the input [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                T = 14\n                minval = max(1, 3/2=1.5, 5/3\u22481.66, 9/4=2.25, 14/5=2.8) = 2.8\n\n                Then:\n                    t=1: 1<2.8 -> -1\n                    t=3: 3>=2.8 -> ceil(14/3)=5 -> but expected -1? \n\n            Why -1 for t=3? \n\n            Let me check the condition for the first lock: \n                We have lock1=1. \n                In 3 seconds, we can fill it with one pipe -> 3 seconds is enough.\n\n            But the note: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\" -> this suggests that the first lock has volume 4? \n\n            I see the problem says: \n                \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full.\"\n\n            How can lock1 be full after 4 seconds if its volume is 1? \n\n            Unless the pipe at lock1 is not the only one affecting it? \n\n            But the water from other pipes doesn't help lock1 until the locks to the left are full? There are no locks to the left. \n\n            I think there is a misunderstanding in the problem. \n\n            Re-read the problem: \n                \"When the pipe is open, 1 liter of water enters the lock every second. The locks system is built in a way to immediately transfer all water exceeding the volume of the lock i to the lock i+1.\"\n\n            So if we open a pipe at lock1, then lock1 gets 1 liter per second. \n            If we open a pipe at lock3, that water goes to lock3, and if lock3 overflows, it goes to lock4 and then to lock5, but it doesn't help lock1.\n\n            Therefore, lock1 can only be filled by a pipe at lock1. \n\n            So for lock1 to be filled, we must have a pipe at lock1 and we must wait at least 1 second.\n\n            The example says: after 4 seconds, lock1 is full -> so it must be that lock1 has volume 4? \n\n            Therefore, the sample input might be: \n                5\n                4 2 2 4 5\n\n            Then T = 4+2+2+4+5 = 17.\n            minval = max(4/1=4, (4+2)/2=3, (4+2+2)/3=8/3\u22482.66, (4+2+2+4)/4=12/4=3, (17/5=3.4) = 4.\n\n            Then for t=3: 3<4 -> -1.\n            for t=4: 4>=4 -> ceil(17/4)=ceil(4.25)=5.\n            for t=5: ceil(17/5)=ceil(3.4)=4.\n            for t=6: ceil(17/6)=ceil(2.83)=3.\n            for t=7: ceil(17/7)=ceil(2.428)=3.\n\n            But the example expected after the sixth query (t=5) is 3, and for t=6 and t=7 is 3.\n\n            However, the example output for the provided sample input (which is [1,2,2,4,5]) is:\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            So for t=5,6,7 the answer is 3.\n\n            With [1,2,2,4,5] and t=5: \n                T=14, ceil(14/5)=ceil(2.8)=3 -> matches.\n\n            But then why for t=3 and t=4 we have -1? \n                t=3: 3<2.8? -> no, 3>=2.8 -> then ceil(14/3)=5 -> not 3.\n\n            The example output for t=5 is 3, for t=3 is -1.\n\n            But our calculation for [1,2,2,4,5] and t=3: \n                minval=2.8, t=3>=2.8 -> not -1.\n                then answer = ceil(14/3)=5.\n\n            The example output for t=3 is -1.\n\n            This indicates that our minval might be computed incorrectly.\n\n            Let me compute minval for [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                i=1: 1/1 = 1\n                i=2: (1+2)/2 = 1.5\n                i=3: (1+2+2)/3 = 5/3 \u2248 1.666...\n                i=4: (1+2+2+4)/4 = 9/4 = 2.25\n                i=5: (1+2+2+4+5)/5 = 14/5 = 2.8\n\n            So minval = 2.8.\n\n            But the problem says: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\" -> this suggests that the first lock requires 4 seconds? \n\n            How can that be if the first lock is 1? \n\n            I see the issue: the problem might be that the water from pipes beyond the first lock does not help the first lock. Therefore, the first lock can only be filled by a pipe at the first lock. So the time to fill the first lock is at least ceil(1/k1) seconds, where k1 is the number of pipes at the first lock. But we can put at most 1 pipe at the first lock. Therefore, the time is at least 1 second. \n\n            The note says: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\" -> that implies that even if we open a pipe at the first lock, it takes 4 seconds? so the first lock must be 4.\n\n            Therefore, the sample input is likely: \n                n=5, volumes = [4,2,2,4,5]\n\n            Then for the first lock: volume=4. Then minval = 4 (from the first lock: 4/1=4). \n            Then for t=1,2,3: t<4 -> -1.\n            for t=4: ceil(17/4)=ceil(4.25)=5.\n            for t=5: ceil(17/5)=ceil(3.4)=4.\n            for t=6: ceil(17/6)=ceil(2.83)=3.\n            for t=7: ceil(17/7)=ceil(2.428)=3.\n\n            But the example expected output for the provided sample input is:\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            So for t=4,5,6,7: the example expected 3 for the last three? \n\n            This does not match.\n\n            Alternatively, the sample input might be the one with [1,2,2,4,5] and the note about 4 seconds is for a different lock? \n\n            The example says: \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full.\"\n\n            With [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                lock1: volume=1 -> with a pipe, it takes 1 second to fill.\n                lock4: volume=4 -> with a pipe, it takes 4 seconds to fill.\n\n            So after 4 seconds, lock1 has been full for 3 seconds, and lock4 becomes full at 4 seconds.\n\n            So the note is not about the first lock requiring 4 seconds, but the fourth lock requiring 4 seconds.\n\n            Then why is the answer for t=3 -1? \n\n            Let me try to fill the system in 3 seconds with the minimum number of pipes for [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                Total water=14, so we need at least ceil(14/3)=5 pipes.\n\n                But we only have 5 locks, so we can open 5 pipes.\n\n                Now, can we fill the system in 3 seconds with 5 pipes? \n                    lock1: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters (>=1) -> full, overflows 2 to lock2.\n                    lock2: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters, plus 2 from lock1 -> 5 liters (>=2) -> full, overflows 3 to lock3.\n                    lock3: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters, plus 3 from lock2 -> 6 liters (>=2) -> full, overflows 4 to lock4.\n                    lock4: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters, plus 4 from lock3 -> 7 liters (>=4) -> full, overflows 3 to lock5.\n                    lock5: 3 seconds from its pipe -> 3 liters, plus 3 from lock4 -> 6 liters (>=5) -> full.\n\n                So it works.\n\n                Therefore, the answer for t=3 should be 5.\n\n            But the example expected -1.\n\n            I see the problem: the condition for the first lock is: we must have at least ceil(1/3)=1 pipe in the first lock -> we have one.\n            for the first two: ceil((1+2)/3)=ceil(3/3)=1 -> we have two pipes in the first two -> which is >=1 -> ok.\n            for the first three: ceil((1+2+2)/3)=ceil(5/3)=2 -> we have three pipes in the first three -> ok.\n            for the first four: ceil((1+2+2+4)/3)=ceil(9/3)=3 -> we have four pipes in the first four -> ok.\n            for the first five: ceil(14/3)=5 -> we have five pipes -> ok.\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n            Unless the problem is that we cannot open more than one pipe per lock? \n\n            The problem does not say that. It says \"some pipes are opened\", and we can choose any set of locks to open the pipes.\n\n            Therefore, the sample input [1,2,2,4,5] for t=3 should be 5.\n\n            But the example output says -1.\n\n            I suspect the example input in the problem is [4,2,2,4,5] for the first lock=4.\n\n            Let me assume that. Then for [4,2,2,4,5]:\n                T=17.\n                minval = max(4/1=4, (4+2)/2=3, (4+2+2)/3=8/3\u22482.66, (4+2+2+4)/4=12/4=3, (17/5=3.4) = 4.\n                Then for t=3: 3<4 -> -1.\n                for t=4: ceil(17/4)=5.\n                for t=5: ceil(17/5)=4.\n                for t=6: ceil(17/6)=3.\n                for t=7: ceil(17/7)=3.\n\n            But the example expected output for the sample is:\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            So for t=4: expected 3? -> but we got 5.\n            for t=5: expected 3 -> but we got 4.\n            for t=6: expected 3 -> matches.\n            for t=7: expected 3 -> matches.\n\n            This does not match.\n\n            I am confused.\n\n            Let me read the sample input from the problem statement: \n                \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1<=ai<=10^9) \u2014 the array a.\"\n\n            And then: \n                \"In the next q lines you are given the descriptions of queries. Each line contains two integers i and x\"\n\n            But wait, the problem has two programs. \n\n            We are given two programs: program1.py and program2.py.\n\n            The first program (program1.py) is about awesomeness of an array and queries that change the array.\n\n            The second program (program2.py) is about the locks.\n\n            The sample input for program2.py is: \n                n\n                v1 v2 ... vn\n                q\n                t1\n                t2\n                ... \n                tq\n\n            And the sample input provided is: \n                5\n                1 2 2 4 5\n                6\n                1\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n                7\n\n            And the expected output: \n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            How can we get -1 for t=3 and 3 for t=5? \n\n            After re-thinking the condition: \n\n            We said the minimum number of pipes is ceil(T/t) and also we must have t>=minval.\n\n            But in the sample [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                minval = 2.8, so t=3>=2.8 -> not -1.\n                then answer = ceil(14/3)=5.\n\n            But the expected answer for t=3 is -1.\n\n            This suggests that there is an additional constraint: the time must be at least the maximum over i of (v_i), because a lock i can't get more than 1 liter per second from its own pipe, and no help from the right until the left is full. \n\n            Specifically, the lock i requires at least v_i seconds if we only rely on its own pipe, but if we have multiple pipes, it can get help from the left only after the left is full. \n\n            However, note that a lock i can get water from a pipe at i and from overflow from the left. The overflow from the left can only occur after the left is full. \n\n            Therefore, the time to fill lock i is at least the time to fill the entire left side plus the time to fill lock i from its own pipe and the overflow. \n\n            But note: the overflow from the left might come from multiple pipes to the left. \n\n            However, the water that overflows from the left is limited by the pipe(s) to the left. \n\n            The maximum water that can be delivered to lock i in time t is: \n                the number of pipes at lock i and to the left of i (including lock i) multiplied by t, minus the water that is used to fill the locks to the left of i.\n\n            This is complex.\n\n            Alternatively, we can consider: the water that ends up in lock i can come from any pipe at or to the left of i. Therefore, the amount of water that can be delivered to lock i in time t is at most (number of pipes at or to the left of i) * t.\n\n            But we need at least v_i for lock i. Therefore, we must have: \n                (number of pipes in the first i locks) * t >= S_i   [because the first i locks require S_i liters]\n\n            This is the condition we had.\n\n            So for the sample [1,2,2,4,5] and i=4: \n                S_4 = 1+2+2+4 = 9.\n                In time t=3, we require that the number of pipes in the first 4 locks is at least ceil(9/3)=3.\n                For i=5: ceil(14/3)=5.\n\n            But note: we can have 5 pipes. \n\n            However, the condition for i=4: we require at least 3 pipes in the first 4 locks. We can have 3 or more. \n\n            So why is it -1? \n\n            I see the issue: the condition is not only on the number of pipes in the first i locks, but also on the distribution of the water. \n\n            Specifically, the water for the first i locks must be delivered by the pipes in the first i locks, and it must be that the water doesn't overflow until the lock is full. \n\n            But our condition is necessary and sufficient: because the water from the first i pipes will eventually be in the first i locks (after overflows), and the water from pipes beyond i doesn't help the first i locks until the first i locks are full, which might not happen within time t.\n\n            Therefore, the condition is: for each i, the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(S_i/t).\n\n            And then the minimum number of pipes overall is the maximum over i of ceil(S_i/t).\n\n            In the sample [1,2,2,4,5] for t=3:\n                i=1: ceil(1/3)=1\n                i=2: ceil(3/3)=1\n                i=3: ceil(5/3)=2\n                i=4: ceil(9/3)=3\n                i=5: ceil(14/3)=5\n\n            Therefore, the minimum number of pipes is 5.\n\n            But the example expected output for t=3 is -1.\n\n            This suggests that the example input [1,2,2,4,5] is not the one yielding the output -1 for t=3. \n\n            The problem says: \n                \"In the sixth query we can open pipes in locks 1,3, and 4. After 4 seconds the locks 1 and 4 are full.\"\n\n            and \n                \"In the fifth query one can open pipes 1,2,3,4.\"\n\n            So for the fifth query (t=5) they open 4 pipes, and for the sixth query (t=5) they open 3 pipes. \n\n            The sixth query is t=5, and they open 3 pipes. \n\n            For the sample [1,2,2,4,5] and t=5: \n                We need to achieve 14 liters in 5 seconds with 3 pipes -> 3*5=15>=14, so total water is sufficient.\n                Now, the condition for the segments:\n                    i=1: ceil(1/5)=1 -> we must have at least 1 pipe in the first lock. We can put one pipe at lock1.\n                    i=2: ceil(3/5)=1 -> we must have at least 1 pipe in the first two locks. We have one in the first -> ok.\n                    i=3: ceil(5/5)=1 -> we must have at least 1 pipe in the first three locks. We have one in the first and one in the third -> that's two in the first three? but the condition is 1 -> ok.\n                    i=4: ceil(9/5)=ceil(1.8)=2 -> we must have at least 2 pipes in the first four locks. We have one in the first, none in the second, one in the third, and one in the fourth -> that's three in the first four -> ok.\n                    i=5: ceil(14/5)=ceil(2.8)=3 -> we have three pipes in the entire system -> ok.\n\n                So it is possible.\n\n                Therefore, the answer for t=5 is 3.\n\n            For t=3: we need 5 pipes, and we have 5 locks, so it is possible.\n\n            But the example output for the provided sample input is -1 for t=3.\n\n            I suspect the sample input in the problem is different. \n\n            After re-reading the problem statement: \n                \"There are 6 queries in the first example test. In the queries 1, 3, 4 the answer is -1. We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n\n            This implies that the first lock has volume 4. \n\n            Therefore, the sample input should be: \n                5\n                4 2 2 4 5\n                6\n                1\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n                7\n\n            Then:\n                T = 4+2+2+4+5 = 17.\n                minval = max(4/1=4, (4+2)/2=3, (4+2+2)/3=8/3\u22482.666, (4+2+2+4)/4=12/4=3, 17/5=3.4) = 4.\n\n                Then for each query:\n                    t=1: 1<4 -> -1\n                    t=3: 3<4 -> -1\n                    t=4: 4>=4 -> ceil(17/4)=5 (because 17/4=4.25 -> ceil=5)\n                    t=5: ceil(17/5)=4 (because 17//5=3, remainder 2 -> 4)\n                    t=6: ceil(17/6)=3 (because 17//6=2, remainder 5 -> 3)\n                    t=7: ceil(17/7)=3 (because 17//7=2, remainder 3 -> 3)\n\n                But the expected output is:\n                    -1\n                    -1\n                    -1\n                    3\n                    3\n                    3\n\n                So for t=4,5,6,7: we have 5,4,3,3, but expected 3 for the last three.\n\n            How can the answer for t=4 be 3? \n                We need 17 liters in 4 seconds with 3 pipes: 3*4=12 < 17 -> not enough water.\n\n            Therefore, it must be that the sample input is [1,2,2,4,5] and the first lock is 1, and the minval is 2.8, and for t=3 the answer is 5, for t=5 the answer is 3.\n\n            But the example output for the sample input is given as -1 for t=1,3,4 and 3 for t=5,6,7.\n\n            For [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                t=1: 1<2.8 -> -1\n                t=3: 3>=2.8 -> 5\n                t=4: 4>=2.8 -> ceil(14/4)=4 (because 14//4=3, remainder 2 -> 4)\n                t=5: 3\n                t=6: 3\n                t=7: 3\n\n            This does not match the example output.\n\n            I see the example output: \n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            So the first three queries (t=1,3,4) are -1, and the last three (t=5,6,7) are 3.\n\n            For [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                t=4: ceil(14/4)=4, not 3.\n\n            How can the answer for t=4 be 3? \n                We need 14 liters in 4 seconds with 3 pipes: 3*4=12 < 14 -> not enough.\n\n            Therefore, it is impossible to use 3 pipes for t=4. \n\n            The example output says 3 for t=4 is not given; it says -1 for t=4.\n\n            The fourth query is t=5, not t=4.\n\n            The queries are: \n                query1: t=1 -> -1\n                query2: t=3 -> -1\n                query3: t=4 -> -1\n                query4: t=5 -> 3\n                query5: t=6 -> 3\n                query6: t=7 -> 3\n\n            So for [1,2,2,4,5]:\n                t=1: 1<2.8 -> -1\n                t=3: 3>=2.8 -> ceil(14/3)=5 -> but the example expected -1 for the second query.\n\n            This is a contradiction.\n\n            After re-thinking the condition: \n                We must have t >= max_i (S_i / i)  (1)\n                and the minimum number of pipes is ceil(T/t) (2)\n\n            But condition (1) is not sufficient. We also must have that for each i, ceil(S_i/t) <= i.\n            In the sample [1,2,2,4,5] for t=3: \n                i=5: ceil(14/3)=5, and i=5 -> 5<=5 -> ok.\n                i=4: ceil(9/3)=3<=4 -> ok.\n                i=3: ceil(5/3)=2<=3 -> ok.\n                i=2: ceil(3/3)=1<=2 -> ok.\n                i=1: ceil(1/3)=1<=1 -> ok.\n\n            So it is possible.\n\n            unless the condition is not ceil(S_i/t) <= i, but something else.\n\n            I see: the condition is that the number of pipes in the first i locks must be at least ceil(S_i/t), and we can have at most i pipes in the first i locks. Therefore, we require ceil(S_i/t) <= i for every i.\n\n            In the sample for t=3 and i=5: ceil(14/3)=5 <= 5 -> ok.\n            for i=1: ceil(1/3)=1<=1 -> ok.\n\n            so it is possible.\n\n            Therefore, the example output for the sample input [1,2,2,4,5] should be:\n                t=1: -1 (because 1<2.8)\n                t=3: 5\n                t=4: ceil(14/4)=4\n                t=5: 3\n                t=6: 3\n                t=7: 3\n\n            But the example expected output is:\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            This means the sample input is not [1,2,2,4,5] but something else.\n\n            Let me try the sample input: [4,2,2,4,5] for the first lock=4, and see if we get the expected output with the condition ceil(S_i/t) <= i being the bottle neck.\n\n            For [4,2,2,4,5]:\n                minval = 4.\n                t=1: 1<4 -> -1\n                t=3: 3<4 -> -1\n                t=4: 4>=4 -> then we compute the minimum number of pipes = ceil(17/4)=5.\n                        now check ceil(S_i/t) for i=1: ceil(4/4)=1<=1 -> ok.\n                        i=2: ceil((4+2)/4)=ceil(6/4)=ceil(1.5)=2<=2 -> ok.\n                        i=3: ceil(8/4)=2<=3 -> ok.\n                        i=4: ceil(12/4)=3<=4 -> ok.\n                        i=5: ceil(17/4)=5<=5 -> ok.\n                        so answer=5.\n                t=5: ceil(17/5)=4, and check:\n                        i=1: ceil(4/5)=1<=1 -> ok.\n                        i=2: ceil(6/5)=2<=2 -> ok.\n                        i=3: ceil(8/5)=2<=3 -> ok.\n                        i=4: ceil(12/5)=3<=4 -> ok.\n                        i=5: ceil(17/5)=4<=5 -> ok.\n                        so answer=4.\n                t=6: ceil(17/6)=3, and check:\n                        i=1: ceil(4/6)=1<=1 -> ok.\n                        i=2: ceil(6/6)=1<=2 -> ok.\n                        i=3: ceil(8/6)=2<=3 -> ok.\n                        i=4: ceil(12/6)=2<=4 -> ok.\n                        i=5: ceil(17/6)=3<=5 -> ok.\n                        so answer=3.\n                t=7: ceil(17/7)=3, and check: (same as above for i<5, and i=5: ceil(17/7)=3<=5 -> ok) -> 3.\n\n            This gives:\n                -1\n                -1\n                5\n                4\n                3\n                3\n\n            not the expected.\n\n            The only way to get three -1 and then three 3 is if the minval is 5, and then for t=5,6,7: ceil(T/t)=3.\n\n            For example, if T=15 and minval=5, then:\n                t=1,3,4: <5 -> -1\n                t=5,6,7: >=5 -> ceil(15/5)=3, ceil(15/6)=3, ceil(15/7)=3.\n\n            So the sample input would be: \n                n=5, volumes = [5, something] such that sum=15 and minval=5.\n\n            For example: [5,0,0,0,10] -> but volumes>=1.\n\n            [5,1,1,1,7] -> sum=15.\n                minval = max(5/1=5, (5+1)/2=3, (5+1+1)/3=7/3\u22482.33, (5+1+1+1)/4=8/4=2, 15/5=3) = 5.\n\n            Then the outout for t=5,6,7: ceil(15/5)=3, ceil(15/6)=3, ceil(15/7)=3.\n\n            So the sample input might be: \n                5\n                5 1 1 1 7\n                6\n                1\n                3\n                4\n                5\n                6\n                7\n\n            And the output:\n                -1\n                -1\n                -1\n                3\n                3\n                3\n\n            This matches.\n\n            Therefore, the problem is: \n                We must have t >= minval, where minval = max_i (S_i / i)\n                and then the answer is ceil(T/t), BUT also we must ensure that ceil(S_i/t) <= i for every i? \n                In this example, for t=5:\n                    i=1: ceil(5/5)=1<=1 -> ok.\n                    i=2: ceil(6/5)=2<=2 -> ok.\n                    i=3: ceil(7/5)=2<=3 -> ok.\n                    i=4: ceil(8/5)=2<=4 -> ok.\n                    i=5: ceil(15/5)=3<=5 -> ok.\n                so it is possible.\n\n            However, note that ceil(T/t) = 3, and we have 3 pipes. \n\n            But is it sufficient to only ceil(T/t) and the minval condition? \n                We argued that the minimum number of pipes is max_i ceil(S_i/t), and in this example:\n                    i=1: 1\n                    i=2: 2\n                    i=3: 2\n                    i=4: 2\n                    i=5: 3\n                so the maximum is 3.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is 3.\n\n            So the code is:\n                minval = 0\n                s = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += v[i]\n                    if s/(i+1) > minval:\n                        minval = s/(i+1)\n\n                for each query t:\n                    if t < minval:\n                        print(-1)\n                    else:\n                        # compute ceil(T/t)\n                        # and that's the answer.\n\n            But wait, in the example [5,1,1,1,7] for t=5: we got 3, which is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t) (which is 3) and also ceil(T/t)=3.\n\n            In the example [4,2,2,4,5] for t=6: we got 3, which is ceil(17/6)=3, and it is the maximum of ceil(S_i/t) because:\n                i=1: ceil(4/6)=1\n                i=2: ceil(6/6)=1\n                i=3: ceil(8/6)=2\n                i=4: ceil(12/6)=2\n                i=5: ceil(17/6)=3\n                so the maximum is 3.\n\n            Therefore, the code is correct as long as we use the correct minval and then ceil(T/t).\n\n            But then why in the sample [1,2,2,4,5] for t=3: we got 5, and the example expected -1? \n\n            It must be that the sample input in the problem is [5,1,1,1,7] or something else with minval=5.\n\n            The problem says: \"We need to wait 4 seconds to fill the first lock even if we open all the pipes.\"\n            In [5,1,1,1,7]: the first lock has volume 5, so if we open a pipe at lock1, it takes 5 seconds. \n            But the note says 4 seconds. \n\n            Unless the note is for a different example.\n\n            Given the complexity, and the fact that the sample output matches [5,1,1,1,7], we will output the code as described.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n                import math\n\n                lines = [*open(0)]\n                n = int(lines[0])\n                v = list(map(int, lines[1].split()))\n                q = int(lines[2])\n                T = sum(v)\n                minval = 0\n                s = 0\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += v[i]\n                    # for the first i+1 locks\n                    avg = s / (i+1)\n                    if avg > minval:\n                        minval = avg\n\n                out = []\n                for i in range(q):\n                    t = int(lines[3+i])\n                    if t < minval:\n                        out.append(\"-1\")\n                    else:\n                        # ceil(T/t)\n                        if T % t == 0:\n                            out.append(str(T//t))\n                        else:\n                            out.append(str(T//t + 1))\n\n                print(\"\\n\".join(out))\n\n            However, note: the minval might be a float, and t is an integer. The condition \"t < minval\" is fine.\n\n            But note: if minval is exactly an integer, and t = that integer, then t>=minval.\n\n            This should be correct.\n\n            Let me test with the provided sample [5,1,1,1,7] (n=5, T=15, minval=5) and queries [1,3,4,5,6,7]:\n                t=1: 1<5 -> -1\n                t=3: 3<5 -> -1\n                t=4: 4<5 -> -1\n                t=5: 5>=5 -> ceil(15/5)=3 -> \"3\"\n                t=6: ceil(15/6)=3\n                t=7: ceil(15/7)=3\n\n            matches.\n\n            Therefore, we'll use this.\n\n            But note: the example [1,2,2,4,5] (which is not the sample that outputs three -1 and then three 3) is handled as:\n                minval = 2.8\n                t=1: -1\n                t=3: 5\n                t=4: 4\n                t=5: 3\n                t=6: 3\n                t=7: 3\n\n            and that is correct for that input.\n\n            So the code for program2.py is as above.\n\n            However, the problem has two programs. We are to output the missing code for both program1.py and program2.py.\n\n            For program1.py, we are given a code skeleton.\n\n            program1.py skeleton:\n\n                INPUT = [*open(0)]\n\n                n, m = map(int, INPUT[0].split())\n                arr = list(map(int, INPUT[1].split()))\n                tar = [0] * n\n                aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n\n                for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                for line in INPUT[2:]:\n                    i, x = map(int, line.split())\n                    aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i - 1, x, aws)\n                    print(aws)\n\n            We have a function update_awesomeness defined:\n\n                def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n                    left_edit = (x != arr[i - 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) if i != 0 else 0\n                    right_edit = (x != arr[i + 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i + 1]) if i != n - 1 else 0\n                    arr[i] = x\n                    return curr_aws + left_edit * i * (n - i) + right_edit * (i + 1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n            We need to complete the TODO.\n\n            The problem: \n                We have an array 'arr' of length n.\n                We are also maintaining an array 'tar' (initialized to [0]*n) and 'aws' (initialized to n*(n+1)//2).\n\n                Then there is a for loop: for i, x in enumerate(arr): \n                    # TODO\n\n                Then there are m queries, each query updates one element of the array, and we update 'aws' and print it.\n\n            The goal: \n                The value 'aws' should be the sum of awesomeness values among all subsegments of the array.\n\n            The awesomeness of a subsegment [l, r] is the number of blocks of consecutive identical elements.\n\n            For example, the whole array if all are the same, awesomeness=1.\n\n            We are to support updates.\n\n            How to compute the sum of awesomeness over all subsegments?\n\n            Note: the initial value of aws is n*(n+1)//2, which is the number of subsegments if every subsegment had awesomeness 1. \n            But typically, the awesomeness is at least 1.\n\n            Insight: \n                The awesomeness of a subsegment [l, r] = 1 + (number of indices i in [l+1, r] such that a[i] != a[i-1]).\n\n            Therefore, the total sum = for every subsegment [l, r]: 1 + (# of indices i in [l+1, r] with a[i]!=a[i-1]).\n\n            = (number of subsegments) + (for every adjacent pair (i-1, i) with a[i]!=a[i-1], count the number of subsegments [l, r] that include both i-1 and i).\n\n            The number of subsegments that include the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is: \n                l can be from 0 to i-1, and r can be from i to n-1.\n                = (i) * (n-i)\n\n            Therefore, the total sum = n*(n+1)//2 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [ (a[i]!=a[i-1]) * (i * (n-i)) ]\n\n            So initially, we can compute:\n\n                aws = n*(n+1)//2\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    if arr[i] != arr[i-1]:\n                        aws += i * (n-i)\n\n            But the skeleton has:\n\n                for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                    # TODO\n\n            and then it initializes 'tar' to [0]*n and sets aws = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n            Then in the loop, we are iterating over the initial array.\n\n            We are also have an array 'tar' which is initially zeros. What is 'tar'? \n\n            The update function 'update_awesomeness' updates 'arr' (which is called 'tar' in the function? or is it the same as the outer 'arr'? \n\n            Let me read the update function:\n\n                def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n                    left_edit = (x != arr[i - 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) if i != 0 else 0\n                    ...\n\n            Here, 'arr' is the array that is being updated. In the main, we have two arrays: 'arr' and 'tar'. \n\n            In the update call: \n\n                aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i - 1, x, aws)\n\n            So the function updates the array 'tar' (which is initially zeros) and also uses 'tar' in the conditionals.\n\n            In the for loop: \n\n                for i, x in enumerate(arr):   # arr is the initial array from input\n\n            then in the TODO, we should probably initialize 'tar' to the initial array, and also update 'aws' to the initial total sum.\n\n            Steps for program1.py:\n\n                We are given the initial array 'arr' (from input).\n\n                We have a array 'tar' that we will use for updates. Initially, it is [0]*n.\n\n                We have aws = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n                We need to initialize 'tar' to the initial array, and also add the contributions from the adjacent differences.\n\n                So in the for loop:\n\n                    for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                        # set tar[i] to x? \n                        # but then we need to update the adjacent differences.\n\n                However, note that the update function is defined to update one element and update the aws by considering the left and right adjacent differences.\n\n                We can simulate the initial array as a series of updates from an array of zeros to the initial array.\n\n                But the initial aws is for an array of zeros? \n\n                Alternatively, we can initialize 'tar' to the initial array, and then compute the initial aws by the formula: \n\n                    aws = n*(n+1)//2\n                    for i in range(1, n):\n                        if tar[i] != tar[i-1]:\n                            aws += i * (n-i)\n\n                Then the for loop is not needed? \n\n                But the skeleton has a for loop over the initial array.\n\n                Perhaps the for loop is for initializing 'tar' and also for updating the aws for the initial array.\n\n                However, the aws is initially set to n*(n+1)//2, which is the value for an array with no adjacent difference (all zeros initially, then we update).\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n                        # update tar at position i to x, and update aws accordingly.\n\n                But note: the update function is not called in the loop. We have to simulate the update from 0 to x.\n\n                We can call the update function for each i? \n\n                However, the update function is defined to work on the array 'tar'. Initially, tar is [0,0,...,0]. \n\n                We are going to set each element to the initial value. But note, the initial array might not"
