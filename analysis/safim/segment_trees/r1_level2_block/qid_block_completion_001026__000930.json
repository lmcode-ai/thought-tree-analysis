So for n>=2, the minimal total gap requirement is: \n      total_gap = 2*a0 + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1}) But wait: in the arrangement we described, we have the gaps: \n      gap0 = a0 (between the first and the second) \n      gap1 = a1 (between the second and the third)\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = a_{n-2} (between the (n-1)th and the nth)\n      gap_{n-1} = a0 (between the last and the first) But then the total gap is a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2}. But note that the last term in the array a_{n-1} is not included? Actually, the array a has n elements: a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. Then the gaps are:\n      gap0 = a0 (between a0 and a1)\n      gap1 = a1 (between a1 and a2)\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = a_{n-2} (between a_{n-2} and a_{n-1}) gap_{n-1} = a0 (between a_{n-1} and a0)   -> but here we use a0? But the gap between the last person (with a_{n-1}) and the first person (a0) must be at least max(a_{n-1}, a0) = a0. So that gap is a0. Therefore, the total gap requirement is:\n      a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2} \n      = 2*a0 + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2}) But note: the sum of the a's from a1 to a_{n-1} is (a1+a2+...+a_{n-1}), so we can write:\n      = a0 + (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1}) But wait, we are missing a_{n-1}? Actually, the gaps do not include a_{n-1}. Alternatively, we can write:\n      total_gap = a0 + (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-2}) = a0 + (sum(a) - a_{n-1]) But that is not symmetric. Actually, the gaps are:\n      gap0 = max(a0, a1) = a0\n      gap1 = max(a1, a2) = a1\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = max(a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}) = a_{n-2}   (because sorted descending, so a_{n-2}>=a_{n-1})\n      gap_{n-1} = max(a_{n-1}, a0) = a0\n\nSo total_gap = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-2} + a0 \n      = 2*a0 + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2}) But note: the sum of the entire array a is S = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1}. Then:\n      total_gap = 2*a0 + (S - a0 - a_{n-1}) \n                = a0 + S - a_{n-1} But we don't know if that is minimal?",

Actually, we can use the known result: the minimal total gap is 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2})? But note: the known solution in CodeForces for the same problem (e.g., Educational CodeForces Round 113 (Rated for Div. 2), problem D) is: if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          s = 2 * a[0] + n\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              s += a[i] if s <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, that is: \n      s = 2*a0 + n + (a1+...+a_{n-1}) = 2*a0 + n + (S - a0)\n      = a0 + n + S But then condition: a0 + n + S <= m.\n\nBut test with sample2: n=2, a=[1,1] -> \n      a0=1, S=2 -> s = 1+2+2 = 5 <=5 -> YES. Test with sample3: n=2, a=[1,2] -> \n      a0=2, S=3 -> s=2+2+3=7>5 -> NO.\n\nTest with sample4: n=3, a=[1,1,1] -> \n      a0=1, S=3 -> s=1+3+3=7<=10 -> YES. But what about the sample: n=3, m=10, a=[1,2,3]? \n      a0=3, S=6 -> s=3+3+6=12>10 -> NO. But we had an arrangement that failed, so that is consistent. But wait: the known solution in the problem \"Sitting in a circle\" (from the note) for test case 4: n=3, m=10, a=[1,1,1] -> YES, and our formula: 1+3+3=7<=10 -> YES. But why is the formula a0 + n + S? \n\nExplanation: The total space required is:\n          n (for the chairs of the persons) \n          plus the gaps: which we computed as a0 + S - a_{n-1}? But wait, the formula we derived for the gaps was: \n          total_gap = a0 + S - a_{n-1} [if we use the arrangement above] \n      Then the total chairs required = n + total_gap = n + a0 + S - a_{n-1} But the known solution uses: a0 + n + S.\n\nWhat is the relation? In the known solution, we have: \n          s = 2*a0 + n + (a1+...+a_{n-1}) = 2*a0 + n + (S - a0)\n          = a0 + n + S\n\n      So that matches: total chairs = n + total_gap = n + (a0 + S - a_{n-1})? But wait, in the known solution we did not subtract a_{n-1}. Actually, in the arrangement we described, the gaps were:\n      gap0 = a0\n      gap1 = a1\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = a_{n-2}\n      gap_{n-1} = a0 So the total gap = a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2} \n                     = a0 + (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-2}) \n                     = a0 + (S - a_{n-1])\n\n      Then total chairs = n + (a0 + S - a_{n-1]) But the known solution uses: a0 + n + S. So there is a discrepancy. Let me recalc for n=3, a=[1,1,1] (sorted descending: [1,1,1]):\n      gaps: gap0 = max(1,1)=1\n          gap1 = max(1,1)=1\n          gap2 = max(1,1)=1\n      total gap = 3\n      total chairs = n + total gap = 3+3=6. But the known solution: a0 + n + S = 1+3+3=7. Which one is correct?",

We can sort the array in descending order: a0>=a1>=...>=a_{n-1}\n      then the minimal gaps = a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2} \n          = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) = a0 + (a0 + a1+...+a_{n-2}) = a0 + (S - a_{n-1])\n\n      But note: the circle has n gaps. The gaps are:\n          between the first and the second: a0\n          between the second and the third: a1\n          ...\n          between the (n-1)th and the last: a_{n-2}\n          between the last and the first: a0 [because the last person has requirement a_{n-1}, but the gap is max(a_{n-1}, a0)=a0] So the sum = a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2} \n                = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2})\n\n      = a0 + (S - a_{n-1])   only if we let S = a0+a1+...+a_{n-1}? then a0 + (S - a_{n-1}) = a0 + (a0+...+a_{n-1} - a_{n-1}) = a0 + (a0+...+a_{n-2}) = a0 + (S' ) where S' = a0+...+a_{n-2} \n\n      But note: this is not the same as 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) because it includes an extra a0. Actually, 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n      and a0 + (S - a_{n-1}) = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-1} - a_{n-1}) = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-2}) = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) So it is the same. Therefore, the condition is:\n      if n > m: \n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          minimal_gap = 2 * a[0]  # for the two gaps adjacent to the first person? for i in range(1, n-1):   # from index 1 to n-2\n              minimal_gap += a[i]\n          # But note: if n==2, then the loop does not run, and minimal_gap = 2*a0.\n          # Then total chairs required = n + minimal_gap\n          if n + minimal_gap <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, for n=2: \n        minimal_gap = 2*a0\n        total = 2 + 2*a0\n        sample2: 2+2*1=4<=5 -> YES. For n=3: \n        minimal_gap = 2*a0 + a1 [since we run the loop for i=1 to n-2, which is i=1 only if n=3]\n        total = 3 + 2*a0 + a1\n        sample4: a0=1, a1=1 -> 3+2+1=6<=10 -> YES.\n\n But sample3: n=2, a0=2, a1=1 -> total=2+2*2=6>5 -> NO. However, we can also write:\n        minimal_gap = a[0] + sum(a[0:n-1])   # because a[0] appears twice? = a[0] + (a[0]+a[1]+...+a_{n-2}) But note: a[0:n-1] is from index0 to index n-2. Alternatively, we can do:\n        minimal_gap = a[0] + sum(a[0:len(a)-1]) \n        because the last element a_{n-1} is not included. But then for n=2: \n        a[0:1] = [a0] -> minimal_gap = a0 + a0 = 2*a0. For n=3: \n        a[0:2] = [a0, a1] -> minimal_gap = a0 + (a0+a1) = 2*a0+a1. So we can write: if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          if n == 1:\n              # then we require: 2*a0 +1 <= m? \n              # but the problem says n>=2, so we don't need this. pass\n          minimal_gap = a[0] + sum(a[0:n-1])   # note: a[0:n-1] is the first n-1 elements of the sorted array (which are the largest n-1 elements)\n          total_chairs = n + minimal_gap\n          if total_chairs <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n But note: the sum of the minimal gaps is exactly a0 + sum(a[0:n-1])? = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-2}) = 2*a0 + a1+...+a_{n-2} [for n>=2]\n\n This matches. However, there is a known solution that uses:\n\n      if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          s = a[0]\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              s += a[i]\n          s += a[0]   # then s = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1]) if s <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, this is different: it includes a_{n-1] in the summation. In our formula, we do not include a_{n-1}. But note: in the summation for i in range(1, n): a[i] includes a_{n-1}. So s = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1]) = 2*a0 + (S - a0) = a0 + S.\n\n Then condition: a0+S <= m.\n\n But sample2: 1+2=3<=5 -> YES. total chairs = n + minimal_gap = 2 + (2*a0 + a1+... but wait, we don't have a_{n-2} for n=2? In sample2: n=2, a0=1, a1=1 -> a0+S = 1+2=3. But the minimal_gap we computed was 2*a0 = 2, and total chairs=2+2=4. So the condition a0+S<=m is 3<=5 -> YES, but the actual requirement is 4 chairs. This is not matching. Therefore, the known solution that uses s = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1]) and then compares to m is missing the n chairs. But wait, the known solution might be intended to be:\n\n      total = a[0]  # the first gap (left of the first person) \n      for i in range(1, n):\n          total += a[i]   # the gap between the previous and the current? total += a[0]   # the last gap\n      # then the total circle length = total (gaps) + n (chairs) if total + n <= m:   # then",

So we can write: if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          if n == 1:\n              # the problem says n>=2, so skip\n              print(\"YES\" if 2*a[0]+1 <= m else \"NO\")\n          else:\n              minimal_gap = 2 * a[0]\n              for i in range(1, n-1):   # from index1 to index n-2\n                  minimal_gap += a[i] if n + minimal_gap <= m:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n But note: the summation for i in range(1, n-1) has n-2 elements. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      minimal_gap = a[0]  # the first gap (between the first and the second) and also the last gap (between the last and the first) will be added later as another a0. for i in range(1, n-1):\n          minimal_gap += a[i]\n      minimal_gap += a[0]   # now we have added the last gap.

How to fix? The code: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          We can change the string to 'YNEOS' (without the space) and then it would be 5 characters? \n                b=0: [0::2] -> indices 0,2,4 -> 'Y','E','S' -> \"YES\"\n                b=1: [1::2] -> indices 1,3 -> 'N','O' -> \"NO\"\n\n          But the given code has: \n                for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    b = 0\n                    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n          And then prints using 'YNEOS '[b::2]\n\n          The string 'YNEOS ' has a space at the end? Alternatively, we can use: \n                print('YES' if b==0 else 'NO') But the code is already set up to use the string trick. We can set b to 0 for valid and 1 for invalid, and then the string 'YNEOS ' will output \"YES\" for b=0 and \"NO \" for b=1. But the space might be included. To avoid the space, we can use a different string: 'YNEOS' (without the space) and then for b=1, we get \"NO\" (without space) because the indices 1,3 are 'N' and 'O', and then index5 is out of range. But the string 'YNEOS' has length 5: \n                b=0: [0::2] -> 0,2,4 -> \"YES\" (since index0='Y', index2='E', index4='S')\n                b=1: [1::2] -> 1,3 -> \"NO\" (index1='N', index3='O') So we should change the string to 'YNEOS' (without the space). But the given code has: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])",

How to check if the segment is not monochromatic:\n\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i: \n                  then it is either all 'B' or all 'R'\n\n          But note: the segment might be \"BB\", then 'R' not in i -> true -> invalid. So the condition: \n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i: \n                  then invalid. But what if the segment is \"B\", then we already caught by len(i)==1. So we can do:\n\n              if len(i)==1:\n                  b=1\n                  break\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i: \n                  b=1\n                  break\n\n          But note: the segment might be \"RR\", then 'B' not in i -> true -> invalid. This is what we want.",

Because if len(i)>=2, then we then check: if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i -> which is the same as: if not (contains both). But the condition is: \n                if i and (len(i)==1 or ('B' not in i or 'R' not in i)) This is equivalent to:\n                if i and ( len(i)==1 or ('B' not in i) or ('R' not in i) ) But if len(i)>=2, then we set b=1 if either 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i. But that is exactly if the segment is not containing both. And if len(i)==1, then we set b=1. So it is the same. But note: if len(i)==1, then the condition 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i is always true?",

Then we add for each next person: a[i] (for the gap between the previous and the next) and 1 for the chair of the next person?

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we have n, m and a list a of n integers.\nWe must decide if it is possible to seat all n people on a circle of m chairs with the given constraints.\n\nThe initial check in the code is: \n   if n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)>m:\n        print(\"no\")\nBut note: the problem says that the total number of chairs is m, and we have n people. Each person i requires at least a[i] empty chairs on both sides. However, note that the circle might allow some overlapping of the empty chairs? But the problem states that the person sitting at j requires that the chairs from (j - a[i]) mod m to (j + a[i]) mod m (inclusive) are all empty except for j. This means that the person occupies one chair and requires a[i] empty chairs on the left and a[i] on the right. However, because it's a circle, we have to be cautious.\n\nBut note: the condition in the problem is that the entire segment of 2*a[i]+1 chairs (centered at j) must be free for the i-th person? Actually, the problem says: no one else should sit in the chairs (j-a[i]) mod m, ... (j+a[i]) mod m. This includes the chair j? Actually, the person is sitting at j, so that chair is taken. The requirement is that the other chairs in that segment must be empty. So the segment has 2*a[i] + 1 chairs: the center j and a[i] to the left and a[i] to the right.\n\nHowever, the condition provided in the code: n + sum(a) + max(a) - min(a) > m, does not seem to be a complete solution.\n\nLet's think of a correct approach:\n\nWe note that the problem is similar to placing intervals (of length 2*a[i]+1) on a circle of length m without overlapping. But note: the circle is continuous and the intervals wrap around.\n\nHowever, the problem is known and has a known solution:\n\n1. Sort the list a in descending order (so the largest requirement first).\n2. The idea is that the first person (with the largest a) will break the circle. Then we can think linearly.\n\nBut note: the circle condition: we can break the circle at the point where the last person is seated? Actually, we can consider the circle as a line by cutting at one point. However, the requirement of the first person (largest a) must be satisfied, and then the next person must be placed at least (a[0] + a[1] + 2) apart? Actually, the empty space between two consecutive persons must be at least the maximum of the two adjacent requirements? \n\nActually, we can model the problem as: we need to assign positions to the n persons such that the distance between two adjacent persons (in the circle) is at least (a[i] + a[j] + 1) for the two persons i and j? But note: the requirement of each person is that there must be a[i] empty chairs on both sides. So between two persons i and j, the number of chairs between them (in the shorter arc) must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? Actually, the empty chairs between two adjacent persons must be at least a[i] (for the left side of person i) and a[j] (for the right side of person j). So the gap between person i and person j must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? But note: the chairs are discrete and the gap is the number of chairs between them. If we have two persons, then the gap between them (in one direction) must be at least a[i] + 1 (for the person i) and in the other direction at least a[j] + 1? Actually, the circle is symmetric. However, we can break the circle by the largest requirement.\n\nKnown solution from similar problems (e.g., CodeForces problems) is:\n\n- Sort the array a in descending order (so a0 >= a1 >= ... >= a_{n-1}).\n- Then, we require:\n      m >= a0 + a1 + 1 + (a0 + a1 + 1)   ??? \n\nActually, a known solution for this problem is:\n\n      total = 0\n      # sort a in descending order\n      a.sort(reverse=True)\n      # the first person requires 2*a0+1 chairs (including the one they sit on)\n      # then each next person requires a_i+1 chairs? But note: when placing the next person, we must leave a gap of a0 (for the first) and a1 (for the second) between them? Actually, we can arrange the persons in a circle with the condition that the gap between two consecutive persons (in the circle) must be at least the sum of their adjacent requirements plus one? \n\n      # Actually, we can model: \n      #   We break the circle at the first person. Then we have a linear arrangement. The first person requires a0 chairs to the left and a0 chairs to the right? But in a circle, we can think of the entire arrangement as having n segments of empty chairs. The condition for the segment between person i and person j (adjacent) must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? Why? Because the person i requires a[i] empty chairs to the right and person j requires a[j] empty chairs to the left, so the gap between them must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? Actually, the gap (number of chairs) between them must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? But note: the requirement of a[i] empty chairs on both sides: the gap to the next person on the right must be at least a[i] (on the right) and the gap to the next person on the left must be at least a[i] (on the left). So for two adjacent persons, the gap between them must be at least a[i] (from the left person) and a[j] (from the right person). Therefore, the gap must be at least max(a[i], a[j])? \n\nBut wait: the requirement is that the entire segment of 2*a[i]+1 chairs must be free for the person. However, when two persons are adjacent in the circle, the gap between them (the empty chairs) must cover both the right requirement of the left person and the left requirement of the right person. Therefore, the gap must be at least a[i] + a[j]? Actually, the segment for the left person extends a[i] to the right (from his sitting position) and the segment for the right person extends a[j] to the left (from his sitting position). So the gap between the two sitting positions must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? (because the sitting positions are separated by at least a[i] (from the left person) and a[j] (from the right person) and then the chair in the middle can be shared? Actually, the gap (the number of chairs between the two sitting positions) must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? \n\nBut note: the requirement for the left person: the chairs from his position to his right a[i] chairs must be empty. Similarly, the right person requires the chairs from his position to his left a[j] chairs must be empty. The gap between the two persons is the chairs from the next chair of the left person to the previous chair of the right person. That is exactly a[i] + a[j] chairs? \n\nHowever, the problem states: the segment for the left person includes his chair and then a[i] to the left and a[i] to the right. Similarly for the right person. The two segments must not overlap. Therefore, the distance between the two sitting positions (the number of steps from the left person to the right person) must be at least a[i] + 1 (to clear the right side of the left person) and then the right person sits at the next chair? Actually, no: the chairs are discrete. The left person sits at position x, then the next a[i] chairs to the right (including x+1, x+2, ... x+a[i]) must be empty. The right person sits at position y. The requirement for the right person: the chairs from y - a[j] to y must be empty? Actually, the requirement is symmetric: the segment for the right person is [y - a[j], y + a[j]]. \n\nTo avoid overlap, we must have: \n      x + a[i] < y - a[j]   =>   y - x >= a[i] + a[j] + 1\n\nSo the gap (in the circle) between the two sitting positions must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1.\n\nTherefore, for the entire circle, we have n gaps (between the n persons). The total length of the circle is m. The total space required is:\n      n (for the chairs occupied by the persons) \n      plus the gaps: for each adjacent pair (i, j) (in the circle) we need at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? \n\nBut note: the gaps are the empty chairs. The entire circle has m chairs. The persons occupy n chairs. The rest m-n chairs are the gaps. The condition is that the gaps must be partitioned into n segments (each segment between two adjacent persons) and each segment between person i and person j must be at least a[i] + a[j]? \n\nWait, the condition we derived: the gap (the empty chairs) between two adjacent persons i and j must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? But that would be the condition for the entire gap? Actually, the gap must be at least a[i] + a[j] + 1? Then the total empty chairs required would be the sum over adjacent pairs of (a[i] + a[j] + 1) but note that each gap is counted once. However, we have n gaps. But the condition we derived is for the linear arrangement? In the circle, we have n gaps.\n\nBut note: the condition for the gap between the last person and the first person? That must also be at least a[last] + a[first] + 1.\n\nTherefore, the total empty chairs required is:\n      sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a[i] + a[(i+1)%n] + 1) \nBut wait, that would be: \n      n (from the +1) + 2 * (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1})   [because each a[i] appears twice: once for the gap to the left and once for the gap to the right?]\n\nBut actually, each gap is between two persons, so the gap between person i and person i+1 must be at least a[i] + a[i+1] + 1. Then the total empty chairs required is:\n      (a0 + a1 + 1) + (a1 + a2 + 1) + ... + (a_{n-1} + a0 + 1) \n      = n + 2 * (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1])\n\nBut note: the entire circle has m chairs. The persons occupy n chairs, so the empty chairs are m - n. Therefore, we require:\n      m - n >= n + 2 * (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1])   ??? \n\nThat doesn't seem right because the total empty chairs required by the gaps is the sum of the gaps, which is the left-hand side, and the right-hand side is the condition we derived? Actually, the condition for each gap is independent, so the total empty chairs must be at least the sum of the minimum gaps. Therefore:\n      m - n >= (a0 + a1 + 1) + (a1 + a2 + 1) + ... + (a_{n-1} + a0 + 1) \n      => m - n >= 2*(a0+a1+...+a_{n-1}) + n \n      => m >= 2*(a0+a1+...+a_{n-1}) + 2*n \n\nBut wait, that condition is too strong. For example, in the sample test case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1]. Then:\n      2*(1+1) + 2*2 = 2*2 + 4 = 8, which is greater than 5 -> would output \"NO\", but the sample says \"YES\".\n\nSo what is the flaw? \n\nAlternative known solution from CodeForces problems (e.g., problem 1537D) is:\n\n      if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n          continue\n      a.sort(reverse=True)\n      total = a[0]  # the first person requires a0 on the left and a0 on the right? \n      # Then we add the next persons: each next person requires a_i+1? \n      # Actually, we can think: we place the first person at position 0. Then the next person must be at least a0 + a1 + 1 away? \n      # Then the next at least a1 + a2 + 1 away from the second? \n      # And the last person must be at least a_{n-1} + a0 + 1 away from the first? \n      # Then the total length required is: \n      #   a0 (for the left of the first) + a0 (for the right of the first) + ...? \n\nActually, a known solution for the same problem (from known submissions) is:\n\n      a.sort()\n      total = 0\n      for i in range(n):\n          total += max(a[i], a[(i+1)%n]) + 1   # or sometimes total += a[i] + a[(i+1)%n] + 1? \n\nBut note: the known solution for the problem \"Sitting in a circle\" (CodeForces) is:\n\n      if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          need = 2 * a[0] + 1\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              need += a[i] + 1\n          if need <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\nBut let's test with sample 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1] -> \n      sorted descending: [1,1]\n      need = 2*1+1 = 3, then for i=1: need += 1+1 = 5 -> 5<=5 -> YES.\n\nTest with sample 3: n=2, m=5, a=[1,2] -> \n      sorted descending: [2,1]\n      need = 2*2+1 = 5, then for i=1: need += 1+1 = 7 -> 7>5 -> NO -> which is correct.\n\nTest with sample 4: n=3, m=10, a=[1,1,1] -> \n      need = 2*1+1 = 3, then for i=1: 3+1+1=5, then for i=2: 5+1+1=7 -> 7<=10 -> YES.\n\nBut wait, the sample 4 in the note: they sit in chairs 1,4,7. The requirements are at least 1 empty chair on both sides. For the person at chair1: the segment [0,1,2] -> but chair0 and chair2 must be empty. Similarly, chair4: [3,4,5] -> chair3 and chair5 must be empty. Chair7: [6,7,8] -> chair6 and chair8 must be empty. Then chair9 is free? And the circle: from chair9 to chair0? The gap between chair7 and chair1: the circle goes 7,8,9,0,1 -> the gap between 7 and 1 is 3 chairs (8,9,0) which is enough? But the requirement for the gap between two persons: the gap between person at 1 and at 4: chairs 2,3 -> 2 chairs? which is 1+1? Actually, the gap between 1 and 4 is 2 chairs (2 and 3) and that is exactly 1+1? So the condition we derived earlier (for the linear arrangement) is that the gap must be at least a[i]+a[j]? But in the circle, the gap between two adjacent persons (in the circular order) is the number of chairs between them. In the arrangement: the order is 1,4,7. The gaps: \n  between 1 and 4: 2 chairs (2,3) -> 2 = 1+1 -> meets the requirement? \n  between 4 and 7: 2 chairs (5,6) -> 2 = 1+1 -> meets.\n  between 7 and 1: 3 chairs (8,9,0) -> 3 >= 1+1 -> meets.\n\nBut the formula we used: \n      need = 2*a0 + 1   # for the first person: we are reserving a0 on the left and a0 on the right? and the center? -> total 2*a0+1.\n      then for each next person i (from 1 to n-1): we add a[i] + 1? \n\nWhy a[i]+1? \n  The next person requires: \n      - The center (1 chair) and then a[i] to the right? But note: the gap between the previous person and the next person must be at least the requirement of the previous person's right and the next person's left? However, the previous person's right has already been partially covered? \n\nActually, the known solution in CodeForces for the problem \"Circle of Students\" (but not exactly) or \"Sitting in a circle\" is:\n\n      a.sort(reverse=True)\n      s = a[0]\n      for i in range(1, n):\n          s += a[i] + 1\n      if s <= m:\n          print(\"YES\")\n      else:\n          print(\"NO\")\n\nBut why is that? \n\nExplanation: \n  We break the circle at the point opposite to the first person. The first person requires a0 on the left and a0 on the right. But when we break the circle, we can use the same gap for the last person and the first person? Actually, the known solution is:\n\n      total = a[0]  # for the right side of the first person? \n      Then we add for each next person: a[i] (for the gap between the previous and the next) and 1 for the chair of the next person? \n\nBut wait, the first person takes 1 chair and then we need a0 on the left and a0 on the right. Then the next person: we place at a0 + a1 + 1 away from the first? Then we have used a0 (left of first) + a0 (right of first) + a1 (left of the next) and then the next person's chair? But the gap between the first and the next is a0 (from the first) and a1 (from the next) -> so we need a0+a1 chairs between them. Then the total for the first two persons: \n      first person: 1 (chair) + a0 (left) + a0 (right) \n      but then we break the circle: we don't need the entire circle? Actually, we are going to arrange the persons in a line? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: \n      The entire circle must have:\n          n (chairs for the persons) \n          plus the gaps: \n            between the first and the second: at least max(a0, a1) ? \n            but actually, the gap must be at least a0 (for the first) and a1 (for the second) -> so at least max(a0, a1) for the gap? \n\nBut note: the requirement for the first person: the gap to the next person (on the right) must be at least a0. The requirement for the second person: the gap to the first person (on the left) must be at least a1. Therefore, the gap must be at least max(a0, a1). Similarly, the gap between the second and the third must be at least max(a1, a2). And the gap between the last and the first must be at least max(a_last, a0). \n\nThen the total empty chairs required is the sum of the gaps: \n      gap_i >= max(a_i, a_{i+1})   for i from 0 to n-1 (with a_n = a0)\n\nTherefore, the total empty chairs (m-n) must be at least:\n      sum_{i=0}^{n-1} max(a_i, a_{i+1})   [with a_n = a0]\n\nBut note: the circle condition: the gap between the last and the first is also included.\n\nThen we require:\n      m - n >= max(a0, a1) + max(a1, a2) + ... + max(a_{n-1}, a0)\n\nBut let's test with sample 2: n=2, a=[1,1] -> \n      max(a0, a1) = max(1,1)=1, and max(a1, a0)=max(1,1)=1 -> total gaps = 2? \n      then m-n = 5-2 = 3 >= 2 -> YES.\n\nTest with sample 3: n=2, a=[1,2] -> \n      gaps: max(1,2)=2, max(2,1)=2 -> total gaps=4, then m-n=5-2=3 < 4 -> NO.\n\nTest with sample 4: n=3, a=[1,1,1] -> \n      gaps: max(1,1)=1, max(1,1)=1, max(1,1)=1 -> total=3, m-n=10-3=7>=3 -> YES.\n\nBut what about the sample: n=3, m=10, a=[1,2,3]? \n      sorted descending: [3,2,1] -> then the gaps: \n          between 3 and 2: max(3,2)=3\n          between 2 and 1: max(2,1)=2\n          between 1 and 3: max(1,3)=3\n          total gaps = 3+2+3 = 8, then m-n=10-3=7 <8 -> NO.\n\nBut is that correct? \n  The requirements: \n      person0: a0=3 -> requires 3 empty chairs on both sides -> so the segment of 7 chairs: 3 left, the center, 3 right.\n      person1: a1=2 -> segment of 5 chairs.\n      person2: a2=1 -> segment of 3 chairs.\n\n  How to arrange? \n      We have 10 chairs. \n      If we put the person with a0=3 at chair0, then the segment [0-3,0+3] = [7,8,9,0,1,2,3] -> that's 7 chairs. Then we cannot put any other person in chairs 1,2,3,7,8,9. \n      Then we have chairs 4,5,6. \n      Put the person with a1=2 at chair5: then the segment [5-2,5+2] = [3,4,5,6,7] -> but chair3 and chair7 are already in the segment of the first person? and chair3 is not available? Actually, chair3 is in the segment of the first person? So we cannot put the second person at 5. \n      Alternatively, put the second person at chair4: then segment [2,3,4,5,6] -> chair2 and 3 are in the first segment? \n      Similarly, chair6: [4,5,6,7,8] -> chair7 and 8 are in the first segment? \n      So it fails.\n\n  Therefore, the condition holds.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can sort and then compute the sum of max(a_i, a_{i+1}) for the circular array.\n\nHowever, we must sort the array? The condition: the gaps are between adjacent persons in the circle. But we are free to assign the positions arbitrarily? So we can choose the order of the persons arbitrarily? Then we can arrange the persons in any circular order. To minimize the total gaps, we should arrange the persons so that the large a_i are not adjacent? \n\nBut note: we can arrange the persons arbitrarily. Then we can sort the array and then arrange the largest requirement first, and then the next largest on the sides? \n\nActually, to minimize the total gaps, we can arrange the persons in sorted order and then place the largest in the middle? But in a circle, we can break the circle arbitrarily. \n\nThe minimal total gap requirement is achieved when we arrange the persons in sorted order and then the gaps are between consecutive persons in the sorted order? But note: the circle condition: the last and the first are adjacent. \n\nHowever, we can use the following: \n      sort the array in descending order: a0 >= a1 >= ... >= a_{n-1}\n      then the gaps we have to cover are:\n          between a0 and a1: max(a0, a1) = a0\n          between a1 and a2: max(a1, a2) = a1\n          ...\n          between a_{n-2} and a_{n-1}: max(a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}) = a_{n-2}\n          between a_{n-1} and a0: max(a_{n-1}, a0) = a0\n\n      So the total gaps = a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2}\n\n      = 2*a0 + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1})   [if n>=2]\n\nBut what if n==1? Then we have only one gap: between the same person? Then gap = max(a0, a0)=a0, and then we have one gap? But the circle: the gap is the entire circle? Actually, for one person: \n      The person requires 2*a0+1 chairs? So we require m>=2*a0+1.\n\nBut the problem states n>=2.\n\nSo for n>=2, the minimal total gap requirement is: \n      total_gap = 2*a0 + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-1})\n\nBut wait: in the arrangement we described, we have the gaps: \n      gap0 = a0 (between the first and the second) \n      gap1 = a1 (between the second and the third)\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = a_{n-2} (between the (n-1)th and the nth)\n      gap_{n-1} = a0 (between the last and the first)\n\nBut then the total gap is a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2}. But note that the last term in the array a_{n-1} is not included? \n\nActually, the array a has n elements: a0, a1, ..., a_{n-1}. Then the gaps are:\n      gap0 = a0 (between a0 and a1)\n      gap1 = a1 (between a1 and a2)\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = a_{n-2} (between a_{n-2} and a_{n-1})\n      gap_{n-1} = a0 (between a_{n-1} and a0)   -> but here we use a0? \n\nBut the gap between the last person (with a_{n-1}) and the first person (a0) must be at least max(a_{n-1}, a0) = a0. So that gap is a0.\n\nTherefore, the total gap requirement is:\n      a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2} \n      = 2*a0 + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2}) \n\nBut note: the sum of the a's from a1 to a_{n-1} is (a1+a2+...+a_{n-1}), so we can write:\n      = a0 + (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1}) \n\nBut wait, we are missing a_{n-1}? Actually, the gaps do not include a_{n-1}. \n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n      total_gap = a0 + (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-2}) \n      = a0 + (sum(a) - a_{n-1])\n\nBut that is not symmetric. \n\nActually, the gaps are:\n      gap0 = max(a0, a1) = a0\n      gap1 = max(a1, a2) = a1\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = max(a_{n-2}, a_{n-1}) = a_{n-2}   (because sorted descending, so a_{n-2}>=a_{n-1})\n      gap_{n-1} = max(a_{n-1}, a0) = a0\n\nSo total_gap = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-2} + a0 \n      = 2*a0 + (a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2})\n\nBut note: the sum of the entire array a is S = a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-1}. Then:\n      total_gap = 2*a0 + (S - a0 - a_{n-1}) \n                = a0 + S - a_{n-1}\n\nBut we don't know if that is minimal? Actually, we have arranged the persons in the circle in the order of descending. Is that the minimal total gap? \n\nYes, because we have placed the two largest requirements (a0) adjacent to each other? Actually, we have placed the largest requirement (a0) adjacent to the smallest (a_{n-1})? and then the gap between the largest and the smallest is a0 (which is the maximum of the two). And the other gaps are the maximum of two consecutive in the sorted descending array? which is the first of the two (the larger one). \n\nBut is there a better arrangement? \n  Consider: we have two large requirements. We want to avoid having two large requirements adjacent? \n  However, we have to form a circle. The minimal total gap is achieved when we put the largest requirement and then the next largest, and so on? Actually, we can use the known result: the minimal total gap is 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2})? \n\nBut note: the known solution in CodeForces for the same problem (e.g., Educational CodeForces Round 113 (Rated for Div. 2), problem D) is:\n\n      if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          s = 2 * a[0] + n\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              s += a[i]\n          if s <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, that is: \n      s = 2*a0 + n + (a1+...+a_{n-1}) \n      = 2*a0 + n + (S - a0)\n      = a0 + n + S\n\nBut then condition: a0 + n + S <= m.\n\nBut test with sample2: n=2, a=[1,1] -> \n      a0=1, S=2 -> s = 1+2+2 = 5 <=5 -> YES.\n\nTest with sample3: n=2, a=[1,2] -> \n      a0=2, S=3 -> s=2+2+3=7>5 -> NO.\n\nTest with sample4: n=3, a=[1,1,1] -> \n      a0=1, S=3 -> s=1+3+3=7<=10 -> YES.\n\nBut what about the sample: n=3, m=10, a=[1,2,3]? \n      a0=3, S=6 -> s=3+3+6=12>10 -> NO.\n\nBut we had an arrangement that failed, so that is consistent.\n\nBut wait: the known solution in the problem \"Sitting in a circle\" (from the note) for test case 4: n=3, m=10, a=[1,1,1] -> YES, and our formula: 1+3+3=7<=10 -> YES.\n\nBut why is the formula a0 + n + S? \n\nExplanation: \n      The total space required is:\n          n (for the chairs of the persons) \n          plus the gaps: which we computed as a0 + S - a_{n-1}? \n      But wait, the formula we derived for the gaps was: \n          total_gap = a0 + S - a_{n-1}   [if we use the arrangement above] \n      Then the total chairs required = n + total_gap = n + a0 + S - a_{n-1}\n\nBut the known solution uses: a0 + n + S.\n\nWhat is the relation? \n      In the known solution, we have: \n          s = 2*a0 + n + (a1+...+a_{n-1}) \n          = 2*a0 + n + (S - a0)\n          = a0 + n + S\n\n      So that matches: total chairs = n + total_gap = n + (a0 + S - a_{n-1})? \n\nBut wait, in the known solution we did not subtract a_{n-1}. \n\nActually, in the arrangement we described, the gaps were:\n      gap0 = a0\n      gap1 = a1\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = a_{n-2}\n      gap_{n-1} = a0\n\n      So the total gap = a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2} \n                     = a0 + (a0 + a1 + ... + a_{n-2}) \n                     = a0 + (S - a_{n-1])\n\n      Then total chairs = n + (a0 + S - a_{n-1])\n\nBut the known solution uses: a0 + n + S.\n\nSo there is a discrepancy.\n\nLet me recalc for n=3, a=[1,1,1] (sorted descending: [1,1,1]):\n      gaps: \n          gap0 = max(1,1)=1\n          gap1 = max(1,1)=1\n          gap2 = max(1,1)=1\n      total gap = 3\n      total chairs = n + total gap = 3+3=6.\n\nBut the known solution: a0 + n + S = 1+3+3=7.\n\nWhich one is correct? \n\nIn the sample4: they used 10 chairs? But the arrangement: chairs 1,4,7 -> total chairs used: 3, and the gaps: \n      between 1 and 4: 2 chairs (2,3) -> gap=2\n      between 4 and 7: 2 chairs (5,6) -> gap=2\n      between 7 and 1: 3 chairs (8,9,0) -> gap=3\n      total gap = 2+2+3 = 7, so total chairs = 3+7=10.\n\nBut our gap requirement per segment was 1? Why did we get 2,2,3? \n\nThe requirement per segment: \n      The gap between two adjacent persons must be at least the maximum of their a values? \n      For a=[1,1,1]: the gap must be at least 1? \n      But 2>=1, 2>=1, 3>=1 -> valid.\n\nBut the minimal gap we computed was 1 per segment? That would be 3 in total? But the actual arrangement used 7? \n\nThe condition is that the gap must be at least the maximum of the two adjacent a's. It can be more. The formula we derived is the minimal total gap required. \n\nTherefore, the condition for feasibility is:\n      n + (minimal total gap) <= m\n      => n + (a0 + S - a_{n-1}) <= m   [for the arrangement we described]\n\nBut wait, the known solution uses: \n      if a0 + n + S <= m: YES\n\nBut that is: \n      a0 + n + S = n + (a0 + S) \n      and our formula is n + (a0 + S - a_{n-1])\n\nSo they are different.\n\nWhich one is correct? \n\nLooking at known submissions for the problem \"Circle of Students\" (but note: the problem name might be different) or \"Sitting in a circle\", we find:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n, m = map(int, input().split())\n          a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          if n > m:\n              print(\"NO\")\n              continue\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          total = a[0]  # the first person: we reserve a0 on the left and a0 on the right? \n          for i in range(1, n):\n              total += a[i]\n          total += a[0]  # for the last gap? \n          if total <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\nBut that is: total = a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1}) + a0 = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1}) = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-1}) = a0 + S.\n\nThen the condition: a0 + S <= m? \n\nBut then the chairs for the persons? We haven't added n.\n\nActually, the above code does not account for the chairs of the persons? \n\nLet me check with sample2: n=2, a=[1,1] -> total = 1+1+1 = 3, then 3<=5 -> YES. But we need 2 chairs for the persons and 3 gap chairs? total 5 chairs -> matches.\n\nBut what is the meaning of 'total' in the above code? \n\nThe above code might be computing the total length of the circle required? including the persons? \n\nBut the code: \n      total = a[0]   # first gap? \n      then for i in range(1, n): total += a[i]   # adding the other gaps? \n      then total += a[0]   # the last gap? \n\n      total = a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1}) + a0 = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1])\n\nBut then we haven't added the n chairs for the persons. \n\nSo the condition should be: \n      total (which is the gaps) + n <= m   -> gaps + n <= m\n\nBut the code does: \n      if total <= m: \n\nThat would be: gaps <= m, but we also need to account for the n chairs? \n\nThis is a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, the code might be intended to be:\n\n      total = a[0]  # the first gap (left of the first person) \n      for i in range(1, n):\n          total += a[i]   # the gap between the i-1 and i? \n      total += a[0]  # the gap after the last person (which is also the gap between the last and the first) \n      # and then we also have the n chairs? \n\n      So the total circle length = total (gaps) + n (chairs) \n\n      Then condition: total + n <= m\n\nBut sample2: gaps = 1+1+1 = 3, then 3+2=5<=5 -> YES.\n\nSample3: gaps = 2+1+2 = 5, then 5+2=7>5 -> NO.\n\nSample4: gaps = 1+1+1+1 = 4? -> wait, for n=3: \n      gaps = a0 + a1 + a0 = 1+1+1 = 3, then 3+3=6<=10 -> YES.\n\nBut the sample4 arrangement used 10 chairs? \n\nThe minimal requirement is 6 chairs? Why did they use 10? \n\nActually, the minimal requirement is 6 chairs: \n      chairs: \n          person0: at some chair -> requires a0=1 empty on both sides -> so the segment of 3 chairs.\n          person1: next to person0? -> gap of 1 empty chair between them? \n          person2: next to person1? -> gap of 1 empty chair between them, and then between person2 and person0: gap of 1 empty chair? \n      total chairs: 3 (persons) + 3 (gaps) = 6.\n\nBut the problem says they sat in chairs 1,4,7 of 10 chairs. That is not minimal. \n\nSo the condition is: we require at least 6 chairs. Since m=10>=6, it is possible.\n\nTherefore, the correct condition is:\n      minimal_total_gap = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1])\n      minimal_total_chairs = n + minimal_total_gap\n\n      if minimal_total_chairs <= m: YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, in the gaps we have: \n      gap0 = a0   (between the first and the second)\n      gap1 = a1   (between the second and the third)\n      ...\n      gap_{n-2} = a_{n-2}   (between the (n-1)th and the nth)\n      gap_{n-1} = a0   (between the last and the first)\n\n      So the gaps are: a0 (appearing twice) and a1 to a_{n-2} (each once). \n      But note: the array a has n elements: a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}. \n      In the gaps, we are missing a_{n-1}? \n\n      total_gap = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n                = a0 + (a0 + a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n                = a0 + (S - a_{n-1])\n\n      So minimal_total_chairs = n + a0 + S - a_{n-1]\n\nBut sample2: n=2, a0=1, a1=1 -> \n      minimal_total_chairs = 2 + 1 + (1+1) - 1 = 2+1+2-1 = 4? \n      But we know it should be 5? \n\nWait, let me list the gaps for sample2: \n      We have two persons. \n      gap0 = max(a0, a1) = 1 (between them)\n      gap1 = max(a1, a0) = 1 (between the second and the first, closing the circle)\n      So two gaps of 1 each -> total gap=2.\n      total chairs = 2 (persons) + 2 (gaps) = 4.\n\nBut the sample2: m=5, and the arrangement used 5 chairs. \n\nWhy 4 is not enough? \n\nBecause the circle has 5 chairs. The minimal requirement is 4 chairs? But the problem says they sat in chairs 0 and 2? \n  Then the gaps: \n      between 0 and 2: gap=1 (chair1)\n      between 2 and 0: gap=2 (chairs3 and 4) -> because the circle: 2->3->4->0 -> that's 2 chairs? \n  So total gap=1+2=3.\n\nThe condition we derived is the minimal gap requirement per segment, but the segments are not independent. In the circle, the sum of the gaps must be m-n. And the condition is that each gap_i >= g_i, where g_i = max(a_i, a_{i+1}). \n\nThe minimal total gap is the sum of g_i. \n\nFor sample2: g0 = max(a0,a1)=1, g1 = max(a1,a0)=1, so minimal total gap=2. \n  Then we require m-n>=2 -> m>=4. \n  Since m=5>=4, it is possible.\n\nBut the arrangement used 3 gap chairs? That is more than the minimal. \n\nSo the condition is: \n      if n > m: NO\n      else if the sum of the minimal gaps (which is sum_{i} max(a_i, a_{i+1}) ) <= m - n: YES\n      else NO.\n\nBut how to compute the sum of the minimal gaps? \n      We can sort the array in descending order: a0>=a1>=...>=a_{n-1}\n      then the minimal gaps = a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2} \n          = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n      = a0 + (a0 + a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n      = a0 + (S - a_{n-1])\n\n      But note: the circle has n gaps. The gaps are:\n          between the first and the second: a0\n          between the second and the third: a1\n          ...\n          between the (n-1)th and the last: a_{n-2}\n          between the last and the first: a0   [because the last person has requirement a_{n-1}, but the gap is max(a_{n-1}, a0)=a0]\n\n      So the sum = a0 + a0 + a1 + a2 + ... + a_{n-2} \n                = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2})\n\n      = a0 + (S - a_{n-1])   only if we let S = a0+a1+...+a_{n-1}? \n        then a0 + (S - a_{n-1}) = a0 + (a0+...+a_{n-1} - a_{n-1}) = a0 + (a0+...+a_{n-2}) \n        = a0 + (S' ) where S' = a0+...+a_{n-2} \n\n      But note: this is not the same as 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) because it includes an extra a0.\n\n      Actually, 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n      and a0 + (S - a_{n-1}) = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-1} - a_{n-1}) \n                              = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n                              = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n\n      So it is the same.\n\n Therefore, the condition is:\n      if n > m: \n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          minimal_gap = 2 * a[0]  # for the two gaps adjacent to the first person? \n          for i in range(1, n-1):   # from index 1 to n-2\n              minimal_gap += a[i]\n          # But note: if n==2, then the loop does not run, and minimal_gap = 2*a0.\n          # Then total chairs required = n + minimal_gap\n          if n + minimal_gap <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, for n=2: \n        minimal_gap = 2*a0\n        total = 2 + 2*a0\n        sample2: 2+2*1=4<=5 -> YES.\n\n For n=3: \n        minimal_gap = 2*a0 + a1   [since we run the loop for i=1 to n-2, which is i=1 only if n=3]\n        total = 3 + 2*a0 + a1\n        sample4: a0=1, a1=1 -> 3+2+1=6<=10 -> YES.\n\n But sample3: n=2, a0=2, a1=1 -> total=2+2*2=6>5 -> NO.\n\n However, we can also write:\n        minimal_gap = a[0] + sum(a[0:n-1])   # because a[0] appears twice? \n        = a[0] + (a[0]+a[1]+...+a_{n-2}) \n\n But note: a[0:n-1] is from index0 to index n-2.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n        minimal_gap = a[0] + sum(a[0:len(a)-1]) \n        because the last element a_{n-1} is not included.\n\n But then for n=2: \n        a[0:1] = [a0] -> minimal_gap = a0 + a0 = 2*a0.\n\n For n=3: \n        a[0:2] = [a0, a1] -> minimal_gap = a0 + (a0+a1) = 2*a0+a1.\n\n So we can write:\n\n      if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          if n == 1:\n              # then we require: 2*a0+1 <= m?

\n        = a0 + (a0+a1+...+a_{n-2}) \n        = 2*a0 + a1+...+a_{n-2}   [for n>=2]\n\n This matches.\n\n However, there is a known solution that uses:\n\n      if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          s = a[0]\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              s += a[i]\n          s += a[0]   # then s = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1])\n          if s <= m:\n              print(\"YES\")\n          else:\n              print(\"NO\")\n\n But wait, this is different: it includes a_{n-1] in the summation. \n\n In our formula, we do not include a_{n-1}. \n\n But note: in the summation for i in range(1, n): a[i] includes a_{n-1}. \n\n So s = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1]) = 2*a0 + (S - a0) = a0 + S.\n\n Then condition: a0+S <= m.\n\n But sample2: 1+2=3<=5 -> YES.\n        total chairs = n + minimal_gap = 2 + (2*a0 + a1+... but wait, we don't have a_{n-2} for n=2? \n\n In sample2: n=2, a0=1, a1=1 -> a0+S = 1+2=3.\n        But the minimal_gap we computed was 2*a0 = 2, and total chairs=2+2=4.\n\n So the condition a0+S<=m is 3<=5 -> YES, but the actual requirement is 4 chairs.\n\n This is not matching.\n\n Therefore, the known solution that uses s = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-1]) and then compares to m is missing the n chairs.\n\n But wait, the known solution might be intended to be:\n\n      total = a[0]  # the first gap (left of the first person) \n      for i in range(1, n):\n          total += a[i]   # the gap between the previous and the current? \n      total += a[0]   # the last gap\n      # then the total circle length = total (gaps) + n (chairs) \n      if total + n <= m:   # then YES\n\n But the known solution does not have '+n' in the condition.\n\n We found a known submission for the problem \"Circle of Students\" (CodeForces) for a different problem? \n\n Given the time, we will trust the logical derivation: \n      minimal_gap = 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2])   [for n>=2]\n      total_chairs = n + minimal_gap\n\n      if n>m: NO\n      else if n+minimal_gap <= m: YES\n      else: NO\n\n But note: for n=2, there is no a_{n-2} because n-2=0. So the summation from 1 to n-2 is empty. Then minimal_gap = 2*a0.\n\n So we can write:\n\n      if n > m:\n          print(\"NO\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          if n == 1:\n              # the problem says n>=2, so skip\n              print(\"YES\" if 2*a[0]+1 <= m else \"NO\")\n          else:\n              minimal_gap = 2 * a[0]\n              for i in range(1, n-1):   # from index1 to index n-2\n                  minimal_gap += a[i]\n              if n + minimal_gap <= m:\n                  print(\"YES\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"NO\")\n\n But note: the summation for i in range(1, n-1) has n-2 elements. \n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      minimal_gap = a[0]  # the first gap (between the first and the second) and also the last gap (between the last and the first) will be added later as another a0.\n      for i in range(1, n-1):\n          minimal_gap += a[i]\n      minimal_gap += a[0]   # now we have added the last gap.\n\n But then we can write:\n\n      minimal_gap = 0\n      # the gaps: \n      #   gap0 = a0\n      #   gap1 = a1\n      #   ...\n      #   gap_{n-2} = a_{n-2}\n      #   gap_{n-1} = a0\n      # so:\n      minimal_gap = a0   # for gap0\n      for i in range(1, n-1):   # indices 1 to n-2: these are a1 to a_{n-2} -> n-2 elements\n          minimal_gap += a[i]\n      minimal_gap += a0   # for gap_{n-1}\n\n      total_chairs = n + minimal_gap\n\n But note: a0 is the largest, then a1, ... a_{n-1} is the smallest.\n\n This matches.\n\n However, the problem states that the total of n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do a loop over n-2 which is acceptable.\n\n But note: the initial condition in the given code was:\n\n      if n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)>m:\n          print(\"no\")\n\n We are replacing that with a more accurate condition.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, we will replace the TODO with:\n\n      a.sort(reverse=True)\n      if n == 1:\n          # though n>=2, but to be safe, but the problem says n>=2, so we skip\n          # Actually, the problem says n>=2.\n          total_needed = 2 * a[0] + 1\n      else:\n          total_gap = 2 * a[0]\n          for i in range(1, n-1):\n              total_gap += a[i]\n          total_needed = n + total_gap\n      if total_needed <= m:\n          print(\"yes\")\n      else:\n          print(\"no\")\n\n But note: the sample2: n=2, then the loop range(1, n-1) is range(1,1) -> empty, so total_gap=2*a0=2, total_needed=2+2=4<=5 -> YES.\n\n But sample3: n=2, a0=2, total_needed=2+2*2=6>5 -> NO.\n\n But sample4: n=3, a0=1, then loop i=1 to n-2 (i=1 to 2-1=2, so i=1 only) -> a[1]=1, total_gap=2*1+1=3, total_needed=3+3=6<=10 -> YES.\n\n But what if the array is not sorted in descending order? We sorted it.\n\n However, note: the initial condition in the given code was:\n\n      if n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)>m:\n          print(\"no\")\n\n We are replacing that with a more accurate condition. But the initial condition might be an optimization? \n\n We can do:\n\n      if n > m:\n          print(\"no\")\n      else:\n          a.sort(reverse=True)\n          total_gap = 2 * a[0]\n          for i in range(1, n-1):\n              total_gap += a[i]\n          if n + total_gap <= m:\n              print(\"yes\")\n          else:\n              print(\"no\")\n\n But note: the initial condition in the given code was:\n\n      if n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)>m:\n          print(\"no\")\n      else:\n          # TODO\n\n We can keep that initial condition as a fast rejection? \n\n But the condition n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a) might be not obviously related.\n\n Given the time, we will replace the entire else block with the new condition.\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do a loop over n for each test case, and the total n is 10^5, so it is acceptable.\n\n However, the initial condition might be an optimization for some cases.\n\n But let's compare:\n\n      Our condition: n + (2*a0 + a1+...+a_{n-2}) <= m\n\n      The given condition: n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a) > m -> then no.\n\n      But note: \n          sum(a) = a0+a1+...+a_{n-1}\n          max(a)=a0, min(a)=a_{n-1] (if sorted descending, then a0 is max, a_{n-1} is min)\n\n          so n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a) = n + (a0+...+a_{n-1}) + a0 - a_{n-1}\n\n      Our condition: \n          n + 2*a0 + (a1+...+a_{n-2}) = n + 2*a0 + (sum(a) - a0 - a_{n-1}) \n                                        = n + a0 + sum(a) - a_{n-1]\n\n      So it is the same as the given condition: n+sum(a)+a0 - a_{n-1]\n\n      Therefore, the given condition is exactly our condition! \n\n      So the given condition is:\n\n          if n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a) > m:\n              print(\"no\")\n          else:\n              print(\"yes\")\n\n      But wait, sample2: \n          n=2, sum(a)=2, max(a)=1, min(a)=1 -> n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)=2+2+1-1=4>5? no, 4<=5 -> then it would go to the else and print \"yes\" -> which is correct.\n\n      sample3: \n          n=2, sum(a)=3, max=2, min=1 -> 2+3+2-1=6>5 -> print \"no\" -> correct.\n\n      sample4: \n          n=3, sum(a)=3, max=1, min=1 -> 3+3+1-1=6<=10 -> print \"yes\" -> correct.\n\n      Therefore, the given initial condition is exactly the condition we derived.\n\n      So the TODO block is not needed? \n\n      But the sample test case 1: n>m -> the given condition: \n          if n>m: the initial condition in the given code is not there? \n\n      The given code has:\n\n          if n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)>m:\n              print(\"no\")\n          else:\n              # TODO\n\n      But if n>m, then n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a) >= n > m, so it will be true -> print \"no\", which is correct.\n\n      Therefore, the initial condition is sufficient.\n\n      But wait, is it always sufficient? \n\n      We derived that the minimal chairs required is n + (max(a) + sum(a) - min(a)). \n      And the condition is: if that minimal is <= m, then YES, else NO.\n\n      Therefore, the TODO block is not needed. We can simply print \"yes\" in the else block.\n\n      However, the sample test case 1: n>m -> we print \"no\" by the if condition.\n\n      So the TODO block can be:\n\n          print(\"yes\")\n\n      But wait, what if there is an arrangement that uses more than the minimal gap? \n\n      The condition we derived is the minimal chairs required. If the minimal is <= m, then we can always find an arrangement by using the minimal arrangement and then distributing the extra chairs arbitrarily.\n\n      Therefore, the condition is necessary and sufficient.\n\n      So the entire program1.py becomes:\n\n          for i in range(int(input())):\n              n,m=map(int,input().split())\n              a=list(map(int,input().split()))\n              if n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)>m:\n                  print(\"no\")\n              else:\n                  print(\"yes\")\n\n      But note: the sample test case 4: n=3, m=10, a=[1,1,1] -> \n          n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)=3+3+1-1=6<=10 -> prints \"yes\"\n\n      And sample test case 3: n=2, m=5, a=[1,2] -> 2+3+2-1=6>5 -> prints \"no\"\n\n      And sample test case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[1,1] -> 2+2+1-1=4<=5 -> prints \"yes\"\n\n      And sample test case 1: if n>m, then n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a) >= n > m -> prints \"no\"\n\n      Therefore, the TODO block is simply: print(\"yes\")\n\n But wait, the problem says: \n      \"Test case 1: n>m, so they can not sit down.\"\n\n      So the initial condition catches it.\n\n      However, note: the condition uses max(a)-min(a). What if the array is not sorted? The functions max and min will work.\n\n      Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the else block is:\n\n          print(\"yes\")\n\n But note: the problem says: \"You may print every letter in any case\", so \"yes\" is acceptable.\n\n However, the sample outputs are \"NO\" and \"YES\" in the problem statement? But the problem says it recognizes any case.\n\n So we can output \"yes\" in lowercase.\n\n But the initial condition prints \"no\" in lowercase.\n\n So for consistency, we use lowercase.\n\n But the problem sample outputs are in uppercase in the statement, but the problem says any case is recognized.\n\n Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        print(\"yes\")\n\n But wait, the given code already has:\n\n        if n+sum(a)+max(a)-min(a)>m:\n            print(\"no\")\n        else:\n            # TODO\n\n So we only need to output the TODO part.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n The code:\n\n      for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n          b = 0\n          for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n The idea: \n      The input is read. The test cases: the first two lines are the first integer and then the next two lines for the first test case, then the next two for the next, etc. The [2::2] takes every second line starting from index2 (the third line) and then every second line: so the lines are the strings s (the picture) for each test case.\n\n      Then for each test case, we split the string s (with the newline removed: s[:-1]) by the character 'W' (white). This splits the string into contiguous segments that are not containing 'W'. \n\n      For example, the string \"BWRBW\" -> split by 'W' -> ['B', 'R', 'B'].\n\n      The stamping operation: we can only stamp two adjacent cells at a time, and the stamp can be BR or RB. \n\n      The known solution for this problem is:\n\n          We note that the entire picture must be partitioned into segments of non-white cells. In each segment, we must be able to form the pattern with the stamp.\n\n          Conditions for a segment:\n            - If the segment has length 1, then it is impossible (because the stamp always stamps two cells).\n            - The segment must contain at least one 'B' and at least one 'R'? \n              Why? Because if a segment is all 'B', then how was it formed? \n                  Initially white. \n                  The stamp can only put one blue and one red at a time. \n                  If we stamp a cell multiple times, then the color flips? \n                  But the problem: each usage of the stamp recolors both cells. \n\n          Actually, the stamping operation is not additive in a simple way. \n\n          Known solution from CodeForces (problem \"Stamp\"):\n\n              The entire picture must be partitioned into contiguous non-white segments. For each segment:\n                  - If the segment has length 1: then it's impossible -> invalid.\n                  - Otherwise, we can form the segment if and only if it is not monochromatic? \n                    Why? Because if it is all 'B', then consider the parity of the operations? \n\n          However, note the operations: \n              The stamp can be applied arbitrarily. The key is that a cell can be stamped multiple times. \n\n          The known solution in the note: \n              The fifth test case: \"BRB\" -> possible? \n                  But the example: \n                      WWW -> W RB (using stamp on the last two) -> then BRB (using stamp on the first two) -> becomes BRB? \n                  But wait, the example: \n                      Step1: WWW -> W RB -> becomes W, then R at index1 and B at index2.\n                      Step2: stamp on index0 and index1: then becomes B at index0, R at index1, and then index2 remains B? -> \"BRB\" -> but the example says \"BRB\" is the result.\n\n              The sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> \n                  Step1: WWW -> W RB -> becomes W, R at index1, B at index2.\n                  Step2: stamp on index1 and index2: then index1 becomes B (because it was R and then stamped with RB: R becomes B? but wait, the stamp sets the two cells to either BR or RB. \n\n          How does restamping work? \n              The stamp sets the two cells to a specific pattern. It does not depend on the previous state? \n\n          Therefore, we can overwrite arbitrarily. \n\n          Conditions for a contiguous segment (without white) of length L:\n\n            We can form any pattern as long as the segment has at least one blue and one red? \n\n            Why? \n              We can start from the rightmost two and stamp them to the desired pattern. Then move left: stamp the next pair (which is the current left and the next) and so on. \n\n            But if the entire segment is the same color, say 'B', then we cannot form it? \n              Because the stamp always produces one 'B' and one 'R'. \n\n          Therefore, for a contiguous segment of non-white cells, we require that the segment is not all the same color.\n\n          But what if the segment has only one cell? Then we cannot use the stamp (because the stamp requires two adjacent cells). So we cannot change a white cell to a non-white? Actually, the segment has non-white cells, but if it is a single cell, then it must have been stamped at least once? But the stamp always stamps two cells. So a single cell cannot be stamped alone. Therefore, a segment of length 1 is impossible.\n\n          Algorithm for the test case:\n\n            Split the string by 'W' to get the contiguous non-white segments.\n\n            For each segment:\n                if the segment is empty: skip.\n                else if the segment has length 1: then it's invalid.\n                else if the segment has only one type of character (either all 'B' or all 'R'): then it's invalid.\n\n            If any segment is invalid, then the whole picture is invalid.\n\n          Then we set b to 1 if invalid, else 0.\n\n          The print statement: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          This is a trick: \n                if b=0: then 'YNEOS '[0::2] = 'Y' + 'E' + 'S'? -> but stepping by 2: \n                    index0: 'Y'\n                    index2: 'E' -> skip? \n                    Actually, it takes every other character: \n                        'YNEOS ' -> \n                        index0: 'Y'\n                        index2: 'E'\n                        index4: 'O'\n                        index6: (if any) ... but the string is 'YNEOS ' (with a space at the end) -> length 6.\n\n                But [0::2] of 'YNEOS ' (which is 'YNEOS ') -> \n                    indices: 0: 'Y', 2: 'E', 4: 'O' -> but we don't need the whole, we only take the first character? \n\n                Actually, the expression: \n                    'YNEOS '[b::2] \n                    if b=0: then it is 'YNEOS '[0::2] -> which is 'YES'? \n                    But wait: \n                        0: 'Y'\n                        2: 'E' -> but we want to skip? \n                    Actually, stepping by 2: \n                        [0::2] -> indices 0,2,4 -> 'Y','E','O' -> \"YEO\"\n\n                But the expected output is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\n          The trick: \n                'YNEOS ' is \"YES NO\" without the space? \n\n          Actually, the string is 'YNEOS ' -> \n                Y N E O S [space] \n                We want: \n                    if b=0: output \"YES\"\n                    if b=1: output \"NO\"\n\n          How? \n                'YNEOS '[0::2] = take every 2nd character starting at 0: \n                    index0: 'Y'\n                    index2: 'E'\n                    index4: 'S'? -> but the string: \n                        index0: 'Y'\n                        index1: 'N'\n                        index2: 'E'\n                        index3: 'O'\n                        index4: 'S'\n                        index5: ' '\n\n                So [0::2]: indices 0,2,4 -> \"Y\", \"E\", \"S\" -> \"YES\"\n\n                [1::2]: indices 1,3,5 -> \"N\", \"O\", \" \" -> \"NO \" -> but we don't want the space.\n\n          The code uses: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          So if b=0, it prints \"YES\", if b=1, it prints \"NO \"? \n\n          But the problem: the next test case will be printed in the next line. \n\n          However, the sample test cases: \n                t=1, n=3, s=\"BRB\" -> b=0 -> prints \"YES\" -> but the string is \"YES\", but the last character is index4, and then we have a space at index5? \n\n          Actually, the string is 'YNEOS ' (6 characters). \n                b=0: [0::2] -> [0,2,4] -> \"YES\"\n                b=1: [1::2] -> [1,3,5] -> \"NO \" (with a space at the end)\n\n          We don't want the space.\n\n          How to fix? \n\n          The code: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          We can change the string to 'YNEOS' (without the space) and then it would be 5 characters? \n                b=0: [0::2] -> indices 0,2,4 -> 'Y','E','S' -> \"YES\"\n                b=1: [1::2] -> indices 1,3 -> 'N','O' -> \"NO\"\n\n          But the given code has: \n                for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    b = 0\n                    for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n          And then prints using 'YNEOS '[b::2]\n\n          The string 'YNEOS ' has a space at the end? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use: \n                print('YES' if b==0 else 'NO')\n\n          But the code is already set up to use the string trick.\n\n          We can set b to 0 for valid and 1 for invalid, and then the string 'YNEOS ' will output \"YES\" for b=0 and \"NO \" for b=1. But the space might be included.\n\n          To avoid the space, we can use a different string: 'YNEOS' (without the space) and then for b=1, we get \"NO\" (without space) because the indices 1,3 are 'N' and 'O', and then index5 is out of range.\n\n          But the string 'YNEOS' has length 5: \n                b=0: [0::2] -> 0,2,4 -> \"YES\" (since index0='Y', index2='E', index4='S')\n                b=1: [1::2] -> 1,3 -> \"NO\" (index1='N', index3='O')\n\n          So we should change the string to 'YNEOS' (without the space).\n\n          But the given code has: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          And the string is written as 'YNEOS ' (with a space). \n\n          We are not allowed to change that? \n\n          The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n          So we must not change the existing code.\n\n          How about we set b to 0 for valid and 1 for invalid, and then the output for b=1 will be \"NO \" (with a space). But the judge will trim? or the problem says the answer is \"NO\", so the space might cause an issue.\n\n          Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for valid and 2 for invalid? \n                Then for b=0: 'YNEOS '[0::2] = \"YES\"\n                for b=2: 'YNEOS '[2::2] = 'E','O',' '? -> \"EO \" -> not \"NO\".\n\n          Or b=0 for valid and 4 for invalid? \n                [4::2] -> 'S',' ' -> \"S \".\n\n          We can set b = 0 for valid and 1 for invalid, and then the output for b=1 is \"NO \" (with space). But the problem says the judge recognizes the string, and \"NO \" is not \"NO\". \n\n          Therefore, we must avoid the space.\n\n          We can do:\n\n                print(('YES','NO')[b])\n\n          But the existing code uses: \n                print('YNEOS '[b::2])\n\n          And we are not allowed to change that.\n\n          How about we set b to 0 for valid and then for invalid we set b=1, but then we remove the space in the string? \n\n          But the string is fixed.\n\n          Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for valid and 4 for invalid? \n                Then for b=4: \n                    'YNEOS '[4::2] -> starting at index4: 'S', then index6 -> out of range -> so only 'S'. \n\n          We want \"NO\".\n\n          We can set b=0 for valid and 1 for invalid, and then the output is \"YES\" for valid and \"NO \" for invalid. But the judge might accept \"NO \"? \n\n          The problem says: \"You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\" and \"YES\" will all be recognized as positive answers).\"\n\n          But for negative, it should be \"NO\", and \"NO \" is not \"NO\". \n\n          Therefore, we must output without the space.\n\n          Given the constraints, we are only allowed to fill the TODO block.\n\n          We can change the value of b to be 0 for valid and 4 for invalid? \n                Then for invalid: \n                    'YNEOS '[4::2] -> starting at index4: 'S', then next is index6 -> out of range -> so we get 'S'. \n\n          That is not \"NO\".\n\n          We can set b=0 for valid and 1 for invalid, and then after the loop, we do nothing. But the print is fixed.\n\n          How about we do:\n\n                b = 0\n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                    if i == '':  # skip empty segments\n                        continue\n                    if len(i) == 1:\n                        b = 1   # invalid\n                        break\n                    # check if the segment is not monochromatic\n                    if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                        b = 1\n                        break   # or not break? because there might be multiple segments\n\n                # but if we break, we skip the rest segments? \n\n          But the problem: multiple segments. If one segment is invalid, the whole is invalid.\n\n          We can break out of the loop as soon as we find one invalid segment.\n\n          But note: the for loop is over segments. We can break out of the for loop by using break, but that only breaks the inner for. Then we set b=1.\n\n          Then the print will be \"NO \".\n\n          To avoid the space, we can change the string in the print? But we are not allowed.\n\n          Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for valid and 5 for invalid? \n                Then for b=5: \n                    'YNEOS '[5::2] -> starting at index5: space, then index7 -> out of range -> output space? \n\n          We are stuck.\n\n          Let me check the length of the string 'YNEOS ' is 6. \n                b=0: [0::2] -> 0,2,4 -> \"YES\"\n                b=1: [1::2] -> 1,3,5 -> \"N\", \"O\", \" \" -> \"NO \"\n                b=2: [2::2] -> 2,4 -> \"E\",\"S\" -> \"ES\"\n                b=3: [3::2] -> 3,5 -> \"O\",\" \" -> \"O \"\n                b=4: [4::2] -> 4 -> \"S\"\n                b=5: [5::2] -> 5 -> \" \"\n\n          We want b=1 to yield \"NO\", not \"NO \".\n\n          How about we set b = 1 for invalid, but then after the for loop, we do:\n\n                b = 1 if (condition) else 0\n\n          and then the print will output \"NO \" for b=1. \n\n          But the judge might ignore the space? \n\n          Given the problem says the string is recognized, and the example includes \"YES\" and \"NO\", and the output is per line, the space at the end of the line might be ignored by the judge.\n\n          But to be safe, we can avoid the space by not using the space in the string. But we are not allowed to change the existing code.\n\n          Therefore, we must output the missing code such that b is set to 0 for valid and to 1 for invalid, and then the print will be \"YES\" or \"NO \".\n\n          But the judge might accept \"NO \" as \"NO\". \n\n          Alternatively, we can set b to 0 for valid and 1 for invalid, and then in the print, it will be \"NO \", but then we can do nothing.\n\n          We'll hope that the judge trims the output.\n\n          Or the problem's example: \n                The sample test cases: \n                    \"NO\" for the second, third, fourth.\n\n          But the code: \n                for the second test case: \n                    n=1, string=\"R\" -> \n                    split by 'W': ['R'] -> \n                    segment: \"R\" -> length=1 -> invalid -> b=1 -> output \"NO \".\n\n          The problem says: \n                \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n          So the judge expects \"NO\".\n\n          But our output is \"NO \".\n\n          This might be a problem.\n\n          How about we set b = 0 initially, and then if we find an invalid segment, we set b = 1 and break out of the for loop. Then after the for loop, we do nothing.\n\n          And then the print outputs \"NO \".\n\n          But the judge might be using: \n                if output.strip() == \"YES\": ...\n\n          So the space might be trimmed.\n\n          Given the constraints, we output the code for the TODO block:\n\n          for each segment i (which is a string of non-white characters):\n\n              if i is empty: \n                  continue\n              if len(i)==1:\n                  b=1\n                  break\n              if i consists of only 'B' or only 'R':\n                  b=1\n                  break\n\n          But note: a segment might be \"BR\", which is valid.\n\n          How to check if the segment is not monochromatic:\n\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i: \n                  then it is either all 'B' or all 'R'\n\n          But note: the segment might be \"BB\", then 'R' not in i -> true -> invalid.\n\n          So the condition: \n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i: \n                  then invalid.\n\n          But what if the segment is \"B\", then we already caught by len(i)==1.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n              if len(i)==1:\n                  b=1\n                  break\n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i: \n                  b=1\n                  break\n\n          But note: the segment might be \"RR\", then 'B' not in i -> true -> invalid.\n\n          This is what we want.\n\n          However, what if the segment is \"RBRB\", then it has both, so valid.\n\n          But note: the condition: \n              if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i: \n          is equivalent to: if the segment does not contain 'B' OR does not contain 'R'. \n\n          So if it is missing one of them, then it's invalid.\n\n          Therefore, the TODO block is:\n\n              if i != '':   # skip empty\n                  if len(i)==1:\n                      b=1\n                      break\n                  if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                      b=1\n                      break\n\n          But note: the split might produce empty strings. We skip them.\n\n          But the for loop: \n                for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n\n          This will produce empty strings for consecutive W's or W at the beginning/end.\n\n          We skip empty strings.\n\n          We break as soon as we find one invalid segment.\n\n          But there might be multiple segments. We only need one invalid segment to make the whole invalid.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              if i != '':\n                  if len(i) == 1:\n                      b = 1\n                      break\n                  if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                      b = 1\n                      break\n\n          But note: the condition 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i is equivalent to: \n                not ('B' in i and 'R' in i)\n\n          So we can also do: \n                if not ('B' in i and 'R' in i):\n\n          But the above is the same.\n\n          We'll use the condition as written.\n\n          However, we can also do without break, but break is more efficient.\n\n          But the total length of the string over test cases is <= 10^5, and the split segments, and the condition is O(n) per segment, so it is acceptable.\n\n          But note: the break will break the inner for loop, so we skip the remaining segments.\n\n          This is acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              if i != '':\n                  if len(i) == 1:\n                      b = 1\n                      break\n                  if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                      b = 1\n                      break\n\n          But what if there is a segment that is not monochromatic, but then later a segment that is invalid? We break at the first invalid segment.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But what if the first segment is valid and the second is invalid? We would not break in the first, then in the second we break.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          However, what if we have multiple segments and the first is long and valid, and the second is invalid? We break in the second.\n\n          So the code is:\n\n              for i in s[:-1].split(\"W\"):\n                  if i != '':\n                      if len(i) == 1:\n                          b = 1\n                          break\n                      if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                          b = 1\n                          break\n\n          But note: the variable b is initialized to 0. If we never find an invalid segment, b remains 0.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          But what if there is a segment that is empty? We skip.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is as above.\n\n          However, we can write it more concisely:\n\n              if i and (len(i)==1 or 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i):\n                  b = 1\n                  break\n\n          But wait, the condition: \n                if i is not empty and (len(i)==1 or ('B' not in i or 'R' not in i)) \n          But note: if len(i)==1, then the second part is not evaluated? \n\n          But we want: \n                if the segment is non-empty and (either it has length1 or it is missing 'B' or missing 'R')\n\n          But the condition: \n                if i and (len(i)==1 or 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i)\n\n          is not the same as the two separate conditions.\n\n          Because if len(i)>=2, then we then check: if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i -> which is the same as: if not (contains both).\n\n          But the condition is: \n                if i and (len(i)==1 or ('B' not in i or 'R' not in i))\n\n          This is equivalent to:\n                if i and ( len(i)==1 or ('B' not in i) or ('R' not in i) )\n\n          But if len(i)>=2, then we set b=1 if either 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i. But that is exactly if the segment is not containing both.\n\n          And if len(i)==1, then we set b=1.\n\n          So it is the same.\n\n          But note: if len(i)==1, then the condition 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i is always true? \n                because a segment of length1: if it is 'B', then 'R' not in i is true.\n                if it is 'R', then 'B' not in i is true.\n                if it is not possible to be anything else? \n\n          So we can do:\n\n              if i and (len(i)==1 or 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i): \n                  b=1\n                  break\n\n          But wait, the condition is: \n                (len(i)==1) or ('B' not in i) or ('R' not in i)\n\n          This is true if at least one of these holds.\n\n          But if len(i)>=2 and the segment contains both 'B' and 'R', then the condition is false.\n\n          So it is correct.\n\n          However, to be clear, we can do:\n\n              if i:   # non-empty\n                  if len(i)==1 or 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                      b = 1\n                      break\n\n          But note: the condition 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i is true if at least one is missing. And if len(i)==1, then it is true. So we can combine.\n\n          But the original two if's are clearer.\n\n          Given the time, we output the two if's.\n\n          But note: the condition in the second if: \n                if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n\n          This is the same as: if the segment does not have both colors.\n\n          So we can also do:\n\n              if i: \n                  if len(i)==1:\n                      b=1\n                      break\n                  if set(i) in [{'B'}, {'R'}]:\n                      b=1\n                      break\n\n          But that is more expensive.\n\n          We'll use the condition with string containment.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              if i != '':\n                  if len(i) == 1:\n                      b = 1\n                      break\n                  if 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i:\n                      b = 1\n                      break\n\n          But note: the condition 'B' not in i or 'R' not in i is equivalent to: \n                if not ('B' in i and 'R' in i)\n\n          We can write:\n\n              if i:\n                  if len(i) == 1 or not ('B' in i and 'R' in"
