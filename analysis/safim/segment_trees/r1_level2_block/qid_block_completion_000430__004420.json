According to the known solution:\n\n                            while m < n:\n                                r += 1   # for the clone\n                                d = min(n - m, m)   # number of swaps we can do in this step\n                                r += d\n                                m += d\n\n                        Then break when m>=n. Example: n=6, m=2:\n                        iteration1: \n                            r=0 -> then r becomes 1 (clone), then d = min(4,2)=2, then r=1+2=3, then m=2+2=4.\n                        iteration2: \n                            m=4 <6 -> \n                                r=3+1=4 (clone) d = min(2,4)=2\n                                r=4+2=6\n                                m=4+2=6 -> break. So output 6. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                            r += 1\n                            d = min(n - m, m)\n                            r += d\n                            m += d\n\n        But note: the variable `n` is the length of the array, and `m` is the maximum frequency. However, the current code: \n            n = len(a)   # which is the length of the array? m = max frequency\n\n        Then we do the while loop. So the missing block is:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(n - m, m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 100000, and the while loop runs at most O(log n) steps? Because m at least doubles? In the first step: m becomes m + min(n-m, m) >= m + min(?, m) -> if m <= n/2, then d = m, so m becomes 2m. Then if m>n/2, then d = n-m, so m becomes n. So at most O(log n) steps. Therefore, it's efficient. So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(n - m, m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly\"\n\n        We are to output the missing code for both programs. Format: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        For program1.py: the missing code is one line: \n            total = 1\n            break\n\n        But note: the condition is written as: \n            if total < 0 or total ! = 0 and allzeros:\n\n        We must be careful: the condition might be written without parentheses? But in Python, \"or\" and \"and\" have priorities: \"and\" has higher priority.",

Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces Round 783) is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input()) a = list(map(int, input().split())) ok = True\n                s = 0\n                seen = False\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += a[i] if s < 0:\n                        ok = False\n                    if s == 0:\n                        seen = True\n                    if seen and s != 0:\n                        ok = False\n                if ok and s == 0:\n                    print(\"Yes\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"No\") So we must set a flag `ok` that becomes false if any condition fails, and then at the end we check that the total is zero and `ok` is still true. Therefore, we need to change the code to:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            total = 0\n            allzeros = False\n            valid = True   # we need to add this variable\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                total += x\n                if total < 0:\n                    valid = False\n                if allzeros and total ! = 0:\n                    valid = False\n                if total == 0:\n                    allzeros = True\n            if total ! = 0:\n                valid = False\n            print('YES' if valid else 'NO') But the original code does not have `valid`.",

If not at first element: decrease current element by 1 and move to previous.\n   - After all operations, the pointer must be at the first element.\n\n The provided code structure:\n   t = number of test cases\n   for each test case:\n        n = int(input())\n        then reads n integers\n\n   Inside the loop for each element in the array, we have:\n        total += x\n        if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n            # TODO: Your code here   (we need to do something to break or mark as invalid)\n        allzeros = allzeros or total == 0\n\n   Then after the loop, we print 'YES' if total==0 else 'NO'\n\n However, note the note: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> so we must ensure the pointer ends at the first element.\n\n After reading the problem and known solutions for similar problems (like \"Array Shrinking\" or \"Reverse Operations to Obtain Array\"), we can deduce:\n\n Conditions for the array `a` to be obtainable:\n   1. The total sum must be 0 (because every time we do an operation that moves right we add 1 and then when we move left we subtract 1, and we end at the first element so the net effect must be 0? Actually, note: the operations are not independent. But note that the entire process must have the same number of right moves as left moves? Actually, the net displacement is 0, but the effect on the array: \n        - Each right move from i to i+1: adds 1 to a[i]\n        - Each left move from i to i-1: subtracts 1 from a[i] (and then we are at i-1)\n\n   However, note that the operations are sequential. The entire journey must form a path that starts at index0 and ends at index0. The net effect on the array: \n        a[0] = (# of right moves starting at 0) - (# of left moves starting at 0) \n        For i (from 1 to n-2): \n            a[i] = (# of times we came from left and then went right) + ... \n        Actually, we can model the operations as:\n            Let r_i be the number of times we moved from i to i+1 (right moves) and l_i the number of times we moved from i to i-1 (left moves). Then:\n                a[0] = r_0 - l_0\n                For i from 1 to n-2: a[i] = (r_i + l_{i-1}) - (l_i + r_{i-1})? \n        Actually, note: \n            When we are at i, we can leave to the right (r_i) or to the left (l_i). We arrive at i from the left (if we came from i-1) or from the right (if we came from i+1). \n        Alternatively, we can use a prefix sum of the moves? \n\n   Known similar problem: \"Obtain the Sequence\" or \"Zero Array\". \n\n   Insight: \n        Let b_i be the net number of times we have passed from index i to i+1 (so right moves at i minus left moves at i+1? Actually, no). \n\n   Actually, we can use a greedy simulation from left to right. We know that we start at index0 and we must end at index0. We can think of the operations as a walk. The condition for the array:\n\n        a[0] must be non-negative? \n        and the walk must never go negative in the \"prefix\" of the journey? \n\n   However, note the note: \n        In the first test case: \n            We have an array that we can obtain but the pointer wasn't at the first element? But the problem says after we are done the pointer has to be on the first element.\n\n   Actually, the note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> meaning that without the rule we could, but with the rule we must have the pointer at the first element. So the example provided in the note is invalid? \n\n   The problem states: \"After we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element.\"\n\n   Therefore, the example in the note that ends at the first element is the second test case.\n\n   Conditions from known solutions (from Codeforces problems, e.g., Round 783, Div2 A) for similar problems:\n\n        Condition 1: The total sum must be 0? \n        Condition 2: The prefix sums (starting from the first element) must be non-negative until the last non-zero part? \n        Condition 3: And once the prefix sum becomes zero, then the rest must be zero? \n\n   Actually, the provided code has:\n        total = 0\n        for x in a:\n            total += x\n            if total < 0: -> then invalid\n            if total != 0 and allzeros: -> then invalid (because if we have already encountered a zero in the prefix, then we cannot have a non-zero again because that would mean we left the zero state and then came back, which is not allowed? Why? Because the pointer must end at the first element, and if we have a zero prefix at some point, that means the pointer was at the first element at that moment? But then we continue and then we have non-zero again? That would require leaving the first element again? But we are not allowed to have the pointer leave the first element after having returned? \n\n   Actually, the variable `allzeros` is set to True once we have encountered a prefix sum of zero. Then if we later have a non-zero prefix and `allzeros` is True, that is invalid.\n\n   Why? Because if we have a prefix sum of zero at some point (say at index i), that means the pointer has returned to the start (if we consider the entire journey up to that point). But then we continue and the prefix becomes non-zero again? That would require moving the pointer again to the right? But then at the end we must return to the start, so we must have the entire array such that the prefix never becomes zero in the middle? \n\n   Actually, the condition is: \n        The prefix sums must be non-negative and the only time the prefix sum is zero is at the very end? \n\n   However, the note example: \n        Second test case: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> but let's compute prefix:\n            index0: 2 -> non-negative\n            index1: 2 + (-1) = 1 -> non-negative\n            index2: 1 + (-1) = 0 -> then we set allzeros = True\n            index3: 0 + 0 = 0 -> but then we have total=0 at the end.\n\n        But the condition in the code: \n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros): \n            at index2: total=0 -> then we set allzeros = True? \n            at index3: total=0, then condition: total !=0 is false -> so no problem.\n\n        Then we print 'YES' because total==0.\n\n        However, the example in the note is [2, -1, -1, 0] and the code would output YES.\n\n        But what about the first test case? The note says: \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> meaning that without the rule we could, but with the rule we cannot? \n\n        The problem says: we must have the pointer at the first element at the end.\n\n        So the first test case must be one that fails? \n\n        The problem says: \"The first test case\" but doesn't specify the array. \n\n        Actually, the sample input is not provided. \n\n   But the problem says: \n        \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n ...\"\n\n   We have to complete the code so that it works.\n\n   The missing part: \n        The condition in the if-statement: \n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n            then we should break and mark as invalid? \n\n        However, the code after the loop only checks total==0. \n\n        We need to break out and mark as invalid if we get a negative prefix or if we get a non-zero after having had a zero prefix.\n\n        But note: we cannot break the loop because we have to read all the numbers? \n\n        We can set a flag and then break, but then we have to skip the rest of the numbers? \n\n        Alternatively, we can break the loop and then skip the rest? \n\n        The problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so we can break and then read the rest of the numbers? But that would complicate.\n\n        Instead, we can set a flag and then continue reading without doing anything? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            invalid = False\n            for i, x in enumerate(map(int, input().split())):\n                total += x\n                if total < 0 or (allzeros and total != 0):\n                    invalid = True\n                if total == 0:\n                    allzeros = True\n\n            Then at the end: if invalid or total != 0: print('NO') else: print('YES')\n\n        But the current code prints at the end: 'YES' if total==0 else 'NO'\n\n        We have to incorporate the invalid condition.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the array must be non-negative at every prefix? and also we cannot have a non-zero after a zero? \n\n        So we can change the print to:\n\n            if invalid or total != 0:\n                print('NO')\n            else:\n                print('YES')\n\n        But the current code does not have an `invalid` variable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the loop and set a flag, and then skip the rest of the numbers? \n\n        Since the input is given in one line, we are already reading the entire line. We cannot break the reading? \n\n        Actually, we are reading the entire array in one go: `input().split()`. The for-loop is over the array. So if we break the for-loop, we skip the rest of the array? \n\n        But then we have to remember that we broke and then at the end we output 'NO'. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            total = 0\n            allzeros = False\n            valid = True\n            for x in arr:\n                total += x\n                if total < 0:\n                    valid = False\n                if allzeros and total != 0:\n                    valid = False\n                if total == 0:\n                    allzeros = True\n\n            if total != 0:\n                valid = False\n\n            print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        But note: the condition \"allzeros and total != 0\" must be checked at every step. \n\n        However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so we can do this.\n\n        But the original code structure is:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            allzeros = False\n            total = 0\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                total += x\n                if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                allzeros = allzeros or total == 0\n\n            print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO')\n\n        We are missing the part to mark as invalid. We can set a flag and then break? But note: we must read the entire array? Because the next test case must read correctly.\n\n        Actually, we don't need to break the reading because we are already reading the entire array. But if we break the loop, we skip the rest of the array? \n\n        However, we cannot break the reading because we are in the middle of the for-loop. We can break to skip the rest of the array? \n\n        But the problem: if we break, we don't set `allzeros` for the rest? That's acceptable because we already know it's invalid.\n\n        However, we must not break the entire test case reading? We have to finish reading the current array? Actually, the for-loop is over the array. We are reading the entire array at once. The for-loop is over the list we just created. So breaking the loop is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the condition \"if total < 0 or (total !=0 and allzeros)\" should make us mark as invalid and then we can break? But what if we get a negative and then later it becomes non-negative? The condition says: if at any point the prefix is negative, it's invalid. Similarly, if we have a non-zero after a zero, it's invalid. So we can break.\n\n        However, the problem says: the array can have negative numbers? But the prefix must be non-negative? \n\n        So we can break as soon as we get an invalid condition? \n\n        But note: if we break, we skip the rest of the array. Then the total will not be the entire sum? \n\n        Then at the end we check total==0? That would be wrong because we broke early.\n\n        Therefore, we must not break? We have to continue to read the entire array? \n\n        Actually, we can break and then skip the rest of the array? But the problem says: the entire array is given and we have to read it to get the next test case. But we are reading the entire array in one line. So we don't need to break the reading? We can just mark as invalid and continue? \n\n        The condition: if we get an invalid condition at any step, then the answer is 'NO'. But we must still add the rest of the numbers? \n\n        However, if we get a negative prefix, then even if we add more and it becomes positive, it's still invalid? Similarly, if we get a non-zero after a zero, then the rest doesn't matter? \n\n        But note: the condition for non-zero after zero: once we have had a zero prefix (meaning we returned to the start at some point) and then we have a non-zero prefix again, that is invalid. And if we have a negative prefix at any point, that is invalid. \n\n        So we can break the loop? But then we don't read the entire array? \n\n        The problem: the next test case is on the next line. We are reading the entire array in one line. The for-loop is over the list of integers. So if we break the for-loop, we still have read the entire line? \n\n        Actually, no: we read the entire line with `input().split()`, then we are iterating over the list. So if we break the loop, we skip the rest of the numbers in the list, but we have already read the entire line. So that's acceptable.\n\n        But then the total will be only the partial sum? Then at the end we check total==0? That would be incorrect because we broke early.\n\n        Therefore, we must not break. We can set a flag and then ignore the rest? But we still have to add the numbers? \n\n        Actually, we can set a flag and then continue without doing the checks? \n\n        However, we must check the conditions for every step? Because if we get a negative prefix at step i, then at step i+1 we might get a positive? But the condition says: if at any point the prefix is negative, it's invalid. So we can set a flag and then skip the condition checks? \n\n        But note: the condition \"allzeros\" might be set again? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            invalid = False\n            for x in ...:\n                total += x\n                if not invalid:\n                    if total < 0 or (allzeros and total != 0):\n                        invalid = True\n                    if total == 0:\n                        allzeros = True\n                # else: skip\n\n            Then at the end: if invalid or total != 0: print('NO') else: print('YES')\n\n        But the original code does not have an `invalid` variable.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set `total` to a very negative number to force the condition to fail? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            if total < 0 or (allzeros and total != 0):\n                # Mark that we are in invalid state, and then we can set total to -10**18 so that it remains negative and we skip the allzeros update?\n                # But then we have to avoid updating allzeros in the future? \n\n        This is messy.\n\n        The intended solution in known problems (like Codeforces Round 783) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                s = 0\n                valid = True\n                seen_zero = False\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += a[i]\n                    if s < 0:\n                        valid = False\n                    if s == 0:\n                        seen_zero = True\n                    if seen_zero and s != 0:\n                        valid = False\n                if s != 0:\n                    valid = False\n                print(\"Yes\" if valid else \"No\")\n\n        But note: the condition \"if seen_zero and s != 0\" must break the validity? \n\n        However, in the example [0,1,-1,0]: \n            step0: s=0 -> seen_zero=True\n            step1: s=1 -> then condition: seen_zero and s!=0 -> invalid? \n            But wait, the example [0,1,-1,0] is valid? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the pointer must be at the first element at the end. \n\n        How can we get [0,1,-1,0]? \n            Start: [0,0,0,0] at index0.\n            Operation1: move right: [1,0,0,0] -> at index1.\n            Operation2: move left: [1,-1,0,0] -> at index0.\n            Then we are at index0. Then we do:\n            Operation3: move right: [2,-1,0,0] -> at index1.\n            Operation4: move right: [2,0,0,0] -> at index2? \n            Then we need to get to index0? \n\n        Actually, the example in the note: \n            [0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0] (right) -> [1,-1,0,0] (left) -> [2,-1,0,0] (right) -> [2,0,0,0] (right? but then we are at index2) -> then we need to move left twice? \n\n        Alternatively, the example in the note for the second test case: \n            [0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0] (right) -> [1,-1,0,0] (left) -> [2,-1,0,0] (right) -> [2,0,0,0] (right? but then we are at index2) -> then we move left: [2,0,-1,0] (left) -> [2,-1,-1,0] (left) -> but then we are at index0? \n\n        Actually, the note says: \n            $$$\\langle \\underline{0}, 0, 0,0\\rangle \\to \\langle 1, \\underline{0}, 0, 0 \\rangle \\to \\langle \\underline{1}, -1, 0, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle 2, \\underline{-1}, 0, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle 2, 0, \\underline{0}, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle 2, \\underline{0}, -1, 0\\rangle \\to \\langle \\underline{2}, -1, -1, 0\\rangle$$$\n\n        So the array [2,-1,-1,0] is obtained.\n\n        Now, what about [0,1,-1,0]? \n            We can do:\n                Start: [0,0,0,0] at0.\n                Move right: [1,0,0,0] at1.\n                Move right: [1,1,0,0] at2.\n                Move left: [1,1,-1,0] at1.\n                Move left: [1,0,-1,0] at0.\n                Then we are at0. Then we need to get the last element to 0? \n                But we have [1,0,-1,0] -> not [0,1,-1,0].\n\n        How about:\n                Start: [0,0,0,0] at0.\n                Move right: [1,0,0,0] at1.\n                Move left: [1,-1,0,0] at0.\n                Move right: [2,-1,0,0] at1.\n                Move right: [2,0,0,0] at2.\n                Move left: [2,0,-1,0] at1.\n                Move left: [2,-1,-1,0] at0. -> This gives [2,-1,-1,0] as in the note.\n\n        So [0,1,-1,0] might not be valid? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: we start at index0 and we must end at index0. The array [0,1,-1,0] has a prefix:\n            index0: 0 -> non-negative, and then we set seen_zero? \n            index1: 0+1=1 -> then seen_zero is True and 1!=0 -> invalid? \n\n        So the condition is: once we have seen a zero (meaning we have returned to the start at some point) then we cannot leave the start again? \n\n        Actually, the condition is: if we have seen a zero (i.e., the prefix sum becomes zero at some index i, meaning that the pointer has returned to the start at the end of step i) then for all j>i, the prefix must remain zero? \n\n        Why? Because if we have returned to the start, then the rest of the operations must be done without leaving the start? But we can leave the start again? \n\n        However, the problem says: after we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element. But if we leave the start again, then we must return again? \n\n        But note: the condition in the problem: the entire array must be built. The operations are interwoven. \n\n        Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces Round 783) is:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                ok = True\n                s = 0\n                seen = False\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += a[i]\n                    if s < 0:\n                        ok = False\n                    if s == 0:\n                        seen = True\n                    if seen and s != 0:\n                        ok = False\n                if ok and s == 0:\n                    print(\"Yes\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"No\")\n\n        So we must set a flag `ok` that becomes false if any condition fails, and then at the end we check that the total is zero and `ok` is still true.\n\n        Therefore, we need to change the code to:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            total = 0\n            allzeros = False\n            valid = True   # we need to add this variable\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                total += x\n                if total < 0:\n                    valid = False\n                if allzeros and total != 0:\n                    valid = False\n                if total == 0:\n                    allzeros = True\n            if total != 0:\n                valid = False\n            print('YES' if valid else 'NO')\n\n        But the original code does not have `valid`. We are only allowed to fill in the missing part? \n\n        The missing part is the TODO: inside the if condition. \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We want to mark as invalid, but we don't have a flag. \n                # We can set total to a negative value to force the final check to fail? \n                # But then we still have to avoid updating allzeros? \n                # Alternatively, we can set a variable? But we are not allowed to change the structure? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        The missing block is only the TODO part. \n\n        We can set a global flag? But we don't have one.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break and then set a variable? But the code after the loop only checks total==0.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We set a variable that we will remember? \n                # But we don't have one. \n\n        Actually, we can set `allzeros` to a special value? Or we can set `total` to a negative value and then break? \n\n        But note: we must read the entire array? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set a variable `invalid` and then break? But the problem says: we are only allowed to fill the TODO block? \n\n        The TODO block is only one line? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We set a flag that we will remember at the end? \n                # But we don't have a flag. \n\n        We can use `allzeros` to mark an invalid state? But then we have:\n\n            allzeros = allzeros or total == 0\n\n        If we set `allzeros` to True when we are invalid, that would be wrong.\n\n        Alternatively, we can set `total` to a very negative value so that the final check fails? \n\n        But then we have to avoid updating `allzeros`? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We set total to -10**18 and then break? \n                total = -10**18\n                break\n\n        Then at the end, total !=0 -> we print 'NO'. \n\n        But what if we break? Then we skip the rest of the array? \n\n        And we skip the update of `allzeros` for the rest? \n\n        But the condition for the rest doesn't matter because we already broke.\n\n        However, the problem: the array might be long and we break early? \n\n        But the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: the condition \"if total < 0\" might be hit multiple times? \n\n        Actually, we break after the first invalid condition.\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py:\n\n            if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n                total = -10**18\n                break\n\n        But then we must also avoid updating `allzeros` after we break? \n\n        The break will skip the rest of the array. Then the `allzeros` update is skipped for the rest? \n\n        But we break immediately after setting total to a negative value and break. \n\n        Then the next step: we break out of the loop. Then we do:\n\n            print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO')\n\n        Since we set total to -10**18, it's not zero -> we print 'NO'. \n\n        But what if we get a negative total? Then we set total=-10**18 and break -> then we print 'NO'. \n\n        What if we get a non-zero after allzeros? Then we set total=-10**18 and break -> then we print 'NO'. \n\n        What if we get a negative total and then later it becomes non-negative? But we break at the first negative, so we don't see the recovery. But the condition says: if at any point the prefix is negative, it's invalid. So we don't care about recovery.\n\n        However, what if we get a negative and then we break, but the total at the end would have been zero? \n\n        Example: [1, -2, 1] \n            step0: total=1 -> non-negative, allzeros=False -> then update allzeros: 1!=0 -> no update.\n            step1: total=1-2=-1 -> condition: total<0 -> we set total=-10**18 and break.\n            Then we print 'NO'. \n\n        But is [1,-2,1] valid? \n            Conditions: \n                The total sum is 0.\n                But the prefix: [1, -1] -> negative at step1 -> invalid.\n\n        So it's correct.\n\n        But what about [0, 0, 0]? \n            step0: total=0 -> condition: not (total<0) and not (total!=0 and allzeros) -> then set allzeros = False or 0 -> becomes True (because 0==0) -> allzeros=True.\n            step1: total=0 -> condition: total!=0 is false -> then set allzeros = True (remains True).\n            step2: total=0 -> same.\n            Then we print 'YES' because total==0.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        What about [1, -1, 0]? \n            step0: total=1 -> condition: not negative and (allzeros is False) -> then update allzeros: 1!=0 -> no update -> allzeros remains False.\n            step1: total=0 -> condition: not negative, and (allzeros is False) -> then condition fails? \n                    condition: total !=0 and allzeros -> 0 !=0 is false -> so condition fails? \n                    Then we update: allzeros = False or 0==0 -> becomes True.\n            step2: total=0 -> condition: not negative, and (allzeros is True and total!=0) -> 0!=0 is false -> condition fails.\n            Then we print 'YES' because total==0.\n\n        But is [1,-1,0] valid? \n            We must end at the first element. \n            How to build:\n                Start: [0,0,0] at0.\n                Move right: [1,0,0] at1.\n                Move left: [1,-1,0] at0. -> then we are at0. Then we need to set the last element to 0? \n                But we are at0 and we have [1,-1,0]. The last element is 0 already. \n                But we haven't touched the last element? \n\n            How to set the last element to 0? We never moved to the last element? \n\n            Actually, the problem: we can do operations any number of times. \n\n            We can do:\n                Start at0: [0,0,0]\n                Move right: [1,0,0] at1.\n                Move right: [1,1,0] at2. -> now we are at2.\n                Then we move left: [1,1,-1] at1.\n                Then move left: [1,0,-1] at0. -> then we are at0. \n                Then we have [1,0,-1] -> not [1,-1,0].\n\n            Alternatively:\n                Start: [0,0,0] at0.\n                Move right: [1,0,0] at1.\n                Move left: [1,-1,0] at0. -> then we are at0. \n                Then we move right: [2,-1,0] at1.\n                Move right: [2,0,0] at2.\n                Move left: [2,0,-1] at1.\n                Move left: [2,-1,-1] at0. -> then we have [2,-1,-1] -> not [1,-1,0].\n\n            How to get [1,-1,0]? \n                We can do:\n                    Start: [0,0,0] at0.\n                    Move right: [1,0,0] at1.\n                    Move left: [1,-1,0] at0. -> done? \n                But then the last element is 0? It is. \n                And we are at0. \n                But the array is [1,-1,0] -> valid.\n\n            So [1,-1,0] is valid.\n\n            In our simulation:\n                step0: total=1 -> allzeros=False -> then update: total!=0 -> so allzeros remains False.\n                step1: total=0 -> condition: total!=0 is false -> so condition fails. Then update: allzeros = False or 0==0 -> True.\n                step2: total=0 -> condition: total!=0 is false -> condition fails. Then update: allzeros remains True.\n                Then we print 'YES' because total==0.\n\n            Correct.\n\n        But what about [0,1,-1]? \n            step0: total=0 -> condition: not negative, and (allzeros is False) -> condition: total!=0 and allzeros -> false. Then update: allzeros becomes True.\n            step1: total=1 -> condition: total!=0 and allzeros (which is True) -> true -> we set total=-10**18 and break.\n            Then we print 'NO'.\n\n            Is [0,1,-1] valid? \n                We must end at0. \n                How to build:\n                    Start: [0,0,0] at0.\n                    Move right: [1,0,0] at1.\n                    Then we want to set a[0] to 0? But we already set it to 1? \n                    We can move left: [1,-1,0] at0. -> then we have [1,-1,0] -> not [0,1,-1].\n\n                Alternatively:\n                    Start: [0,0,0] at0.\n                    We are at0: we can only move right? \n                    Then we move right: [1,0,0] at1.\n                    Then move right: [1,1,0] at2.\n                    Then move left: [1,1,-1] at1.\n                    Then move left: [1,0,-1] at0. -> [1,0,-1] -> not [0,1,-1].\n\n                How to get a[0]=0? \n                    We start at0: we haven't done any operation? \n                    But then we have to set a[0]=0? \n                    Then we move right: [1,0,0] -> then we are at1. Then we move left: [1,-1,0] -> then we are at0. Then a[0]=1? \n\n                We cannot decrease a[0] without moving left? But we are at0, we cannot move left.\n\n                So [0,1,-1] is invalid? \n\n            Therefore, the condition is correct.\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py: \n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                total = -1   # any non-zero value that will make the final total!=0, but we break and then set to negative? \n                break\n\n        But note: if we break, we skip the rest of the array. Then the total we have is only the partial sum? \n\n        We want the final total to be non-zero? \n\n        Example: [0,1,-1] breaks at step1 (with total=1) and then we break. Then the final total=1 -> we print 'NO'. \n\n        But if we set total=-10**18, then we break and then we print 'NO'. \n\n        Alternatively, we can set a flag and then break? But we are not allowed to change the structure? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We set total to a value that will be non-zero at the end, and break to avoid further updates.\n                total = 1   # non-zero, then at the end we print 'NO'\n                break\n\n        But what if the total was negative? Then we set it to 1 and break -> then we print 'NO'. \n\n        But what if the total was negative and then we set it to 1? Then the final total is 1 -> we print 'NO'. \n\n        But what if the total was negative and then we break, but the rest of the array would have made the total zero? \n\n        Example: [1, -2, 1] -> at step1: total=-1 -> we set total=1 and break -> then we print 'NO'. \n\n        But [1,-2,1] is invalid because of the negative prefix. So it's correct.\n\n        However, we must not change the total arbitrarily? Because the condition for the rest of the array is not checked? \n\n        But we break, so we skip the rest. \n\n        But the problem: the total we have at the end is not the real total? \n\n        We don't care because we already know it's invalid. \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                total = 1   # any non-zero value\n                break\n\n        But note: we are breaking the loop. Then the variable `allzeros` is not updated for the rest? \n\n        That's acceptable.\n\n        However, we can also do without break? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We set a flag and then continue? But we don't have a flag. \n                # We can set total to a negative value and then continue? \n                # But then the next step: if total is negative, we will break again? \n                # We can set a variable? \n\n        But we are not allowed to add variables? \n\n        Alternatively, we can set `allzeros` to False? But that would break the condition for the next steps? \n\n        Actually, we can set `allzeros` to False? But then if we have a zero later, it would set it to True? \n\n        But we don't care because we are already invalid? \n\n        But the condition: if we set `allzeros` to False, then the next step: if we get a non-negative and not (total!=0 and allzeros) -> but we are still in an invalid state? \n\n        We want to avoid multiple breaks? \n\n        Actually, we can break to avoid the rest.\n\n        So the solution: break and set total to a non-zero value.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, so breaking early is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n            total = 1\n            break\n\n        But wait: what if we have a negative total? Then we set total=1 and break -> then the final total is 1 -> we print 'NO'. \n\n        What if we have a non-zero after allzeros? Then we set total=1 and break -> then we print 'NO'. \n\n        But what if we have a negative total and then we break, but the rest of the array is long? We break and skip the rest. \n\n        However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: the condition \"if total < 0 or (total !=0 and allzeros)\" might be hit multiple times? We break at the first.\n\n        So the code for program1.py missing part:\n\n            if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n                total = 1\n                break\n\n        But note: the condition is written as: \n            if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n\n        This is equivalent to: \n            if (total < 0) or (total !=0 and allzeros)\n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the condition \"total !=0 and allzeros\" might be evaluated only if total>=0? \n\n        But if total<0, we break. \n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Now, for program2.py:\n\n        Description: \n            We have an array. We can do:\n                Operation1: clone any array (costs 1 operation)\n                Operation2: swap any two elements from any two copies (costs 1 operation)\n\n            We want the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\n        Input: \n            t test cases. For each test case: n and array a.\n\n        Output: minimal number of operations.\n\n        Example: \n            If all elements are already equal -> 0 operations.\n\n        How to solve?\n            We can note:\n                We start with one copy.\n                We can clone to get more copies, and then swap elements between copies to collect all the same element in one copy.\n\n            The goal: have at least one copy that has all elements equal to some value x.\n\n            How many swaps? \n                In the note: \n                    Start: [0,1,3,3,7,0] \n                    Steps: \n                        1. Clone: now two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> operations=1\n                        2. Swap two elements: swap the 0 at the end of the first copy with the 3 at the end of the second copy? \n                            Then: [0,1,3,3,7,3] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> but then we have two zeros in the first copy? \n                    Actually, the note does:\n                        After cloning: two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n                        Then swap: \n                            swap the second element of the first copy (which is 1) with the last element of the second copy (which is 0) -> \n                                first copy: [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> has three zeros? \n                                second copy: [0,1,3,3,7,1] -> not matching.\n\n            Actually, the note says:\n                After cloning: two identical arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n                Then swap: \n                    swap the element at position1 (0-indexed) in the first copy (which is 1) with the element at position5 in the first copy? \n                    But the note says: \n                        [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> how?\n\n            It's complex.\n\n        Insight:\n            We need to form a copy that has all elements equal to x. \n            How many x's do we need? We need n copies of x (for the entire array of length n).\n\n            How many x's are available in the entire multiset? \n                Initially, we have one copy of the array. Then we clone, so we have two copies, then we can swap. \n\n            The entire set of elements we have is the multiset of the original array, and then we clone, so we have two copies of the original array. Then we swap, so the total multiset remains the same? \n\n            Actually, swapping doesn't change the multiset of the entire set of copies. \n\n            Therefore, to have a copy that is all x, we must have at least n copies of x in the entire multiset. \n\n            But initially, we have one copy of the array. So the frequency of x in the original array must be at least n? \n\n            But that is impossible unless the array is constant? \n\n            Actually, we can do multiple clones. \n\n            Let k be the number of clones we make. Then we have k+1 copies of the array. The entire multiset has (k+1) * (the original array).\n\n            Therefore, the frequency of x in the entire multiset is (k+1) * (frequency of x in the original array).\n\n            We require: (k+1) * freq >= n   =>   k+1 >= ceil(n / freq)\n\n            Then the number of clone operations is k.\n\n            But we also need swap operations: \n                In the target copy, we need n copies of x. We start with the original array: we have freq copies of x in that copy. \n                Then we need to bring in (n - freq) copies of x from other copies. \n                And we have to remove the non-x elements from the target copy? \n\n            How many swaps? \n                Each swap can bring one x into the target copy and remove one non-x from the target copy? \n                Actually, we can swap an element that is x in the target copy with a non-x in another copy? But that would remove an x from the target copy. \n\n            Alternatively, we can swap a non-x in the target copy with an x in another copy. This swap brings one x into the target copy and removes one non-x. \n\n            So we need to do (n - freq) swaps to bring in the missing x's? \n\n            But note: we might have to do multiple swaps per element? \n\n            Actually, each swap can fix one element: \n                We have a target copy. We want to replace every non-x element in the target copy by x. \n                For each non-x element, we need to swap it with an x from another copy. \n\n            Therefore, the number of swaps is (n - freq).\n\n            Then the total operations: \n                clone operations: k \n                swap operations: (n - freq)\n                total = k + (n - freq)\n\n            But we have: k+1 >= ceil(n / freq)  => k >= ceil(n / freq) - 1.\n\n            So the minimal total operations for a fixed x is: \n                k + (n - freq) = (ceil(n / freq) - 1) + (n - freq)\n\n            But note: we can choose x arbitrarily. \n\n            Therefore, we want: \n                min_{x in the array} { ceil(n / freq(x)) - 1 + n - freq(x) }\n\n            However, note: we might not need to do exactly ceil(n/freq(x)) clones? \n                We need at least n x's in the entire multiset: (k+1)*freq(x) >= n -> k >= ceil(n/freq(x)) - 1.\n\n            And then we need to do (n - freq(x)) swaps? \n\n            But wait: if we have multiple clones, we might get the x's from different clones. \n\n            Example: \n                n=3, array = [1,1,2] \n                Let x=1: freq(1)=2.\n                Then we require: (k+1)*2 >= 3 -> k+1>= ceil(3/2)=2 -> k>=1 -> so k=1.\n                Then total operations = 1 (clone) + (3-2)=2 -> 3 operations.\n\n            But is that minimal? \n                We start: [1,1,2]\n                Clone: now two copies: [1,1,2] and [1,1,2] -> operations=1.\n                Then swap: swap the last element of the first copy (2) with the last element of the second copy (2) -> no change? \n                Or swap the last element of the first copy (2) with the first element of the second copy (1): \n                    first copy: [1,1,1] -> done? \n                    second copy: [2,1,2] \n                So we did 1 clone and 1 swap -> total 2 operations.\n\n            Why the discrepancy? \n\n            The formula: \n                swaps: we need to replace the last element of the first copy (which is 2) with a 1. \n                We have an extra 1 in the second copy? \n                So we swap the 2 (in the first copy) with a 1 (in the second copy). \n                That takes 1 swap.\n\n            So we only need 1 swap, not (n-freq)=1? \n\n            But note: in the first copy, we had 2 ones initially. We need 3 ones. We replaced one non-one (the 2) with a one. So we did 1 swap.\n\n            So the number of swaps is indeed (n - freq(x)) = 1.\n\n            And the clone operations: k= ceil(n/freq(x))-1 = ceil(3/2)-1 = 2-1=1.\n\n            Total=1+1=2.\n\n            So the formula holds.\n\n            But the example in the note: \n                n=6, array = [0,1,3,3,7,0] \n                They did 6 operations? \n\n            Let's try with x=0: \n                freq(0)=2.\n                k+1 >= ceil(6/2)=ceil(3)=3 -> k>=2 -> so k=2 clones? \n                swaps = 6-2 = 4.\n                total operations = 2+4=6.\n\n            So they used x=0.\n\n            Why not x=3? \n                freq(3)=2 -> same as 0: k=2, swaps=4 -> total=6.\n\n            Why not x=1? \n                freq(1)=1 -> k+1>=ceil(6/1)=6 -> k=5, swaps=6-1=5 -> total=10.\n\n            Why not x=7? \n                same as 1.\n\n            So the minimal is 6.\n\n            Therefore, the solution for program2.py:\n\n                For a test case:\n                    n = int(input())\n                    a = list of n integers\n\n                We want to compute:\n                    Let freq = frequency of x in the array. But we want to minimize over x that appears in the array.\n\n                    However, note: we can choose any x that appears in the array.\n\n                    For each distinct x, let f = frequency of x.\n                    Then candidate = ceil(n/f) - 1 + (n - f)\n\n                    Then answer = min(candidate over all distinct x)\n\n                But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 100000, and the sum of n over test cases is <=100000? \n                    Actually, the input says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\n                So we can iterate over distinct x.\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the array can have negative numbers? But we are counting frequency, so it's the same.\n\n            But note: the array can have duplicates? We want distinct x.\n\n            How to compute: \n                Count frequency of each element.\n\n                Then for each distinct element x, let f = freq[x]\n                candidate = (ceil(n/f) - 1) + (n - f)\n\n                Then answer = min(candidate)\n\n            But note: we might have many distinct x? The total n over test cases is 100000, and the distinct elements per test case can be up to n, but the sum of n over test cases is 100000, so the total distinct elements over test cases is bounded by 100000? \n\n            Actually, the sum of n over test cases is 100000, so the total number of elements is 100000. Then the total distinct elements over test cases is at most 100000? \n\n            But worst-case: one test case with n=100000 -> distinct elements can be 100000. Then we do 100000 computations per test case? \n\n            But the total n over test cases is 100000, so there is only one test case? \n\n            Actually, the input says: \n                t (number of test cases) up to 10000, but the sum of n over test cases <=100000.\n\n            So the worst-case: 10000 test cases, each with n=10 -> then we can have up to 10 distinct per test case -> total distinct over test cases <= 100000.\n\n            So we can iterate over distinct elements.\n\n            But note: we can also iterate over frequencies? \n\n            Alternatively, we can iterate over the distinct frequencies? \n\n            Actually, we want to minimize: ceil(n/f) - 1 + n - f.\n\n            We can iterate over the distinct frequencies that appear? \n\n            How many distinct frequencies? The frequency f is between 1 and n. But the distinct values of f that appear in the array: at most O(sqrt(n))? \n\n            Actually, the distinct frequencies: the frequencies are the counts of the elements. The distinct counts: the sum of counts is n, so the distinct counts are at most O(sqrt(n))? \n\n            But worst-case: all distinct -> one frequency: 1 -> distinct counts=1.\n\n            Or: all same -> distinct counts=1.\n\n            Or: half distinct? \n\n            Actually, the distinct counts are the distinct values of the frequency. The number of distinct frequency values is at most O(sqrt(n))? \n\n            Why? Because the distinct frequencies must be divisors? Not necessarily. \n\n            Actually, the distinct frequencies: the frequencies are integers from 1 to n, but we only care about the ones that appear. \n\n            The number of distinct frequencies that appear is at most the number of distinct elements? \n\n            But we can group by frequency: \n\n                Let F be a list of frequencies that appear. Then for each frequency f in F, we compute candidate = ceil(n/f)-1 + n - f.\n\n            But note: the same frequency f might appear for multiple x, but we only need to compute once.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                freq_count = Counter(a)\n                freqs = set(freq_count.values())\n\n                ans = a big number\n                for f in freqs:\n                    k0 = (n + f - 1) // f   # ceil(n/f) = (n+f-1)//f\n                    candidate = (k0 - 1) + (n - f)\n                    if candidate < ans:\n                        ans = candidate\n\n                Then output ans.\n\n            But wait: is it valid for every frequency? \n\n            Example: n=3, f=2: \n                k0 = ceil(3/2)= (3+2-1)//2 = (4)//2 = 2 -> candidate = (2-1) + (3-2) = 1+1=2.\n\n            Correct.\n\n            But what if we have an element that appears f times, but we are not using that element? \n\n            Actually, we are iterating over the frequencies that appear. For each frequency f, there is at least one element x with frequency f. Then we can choose that x.\n\n            So the minimal candidate over the distinct frequencies is the answer.\n\n            However, note: the same frequency f might be achieved by multiple elements, but we only need to consider it once.\n\n            But what if we have an element with frequency f1 and another with frequency f2, and f1 != f2? Then we compute both.\n\n            So the code for program2.py:\n\n                from collections import Counter\n                ... (the given code already imports from collections import *)\n\n                The given code:\n\n                    for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                        n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                        while m<n:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        print(r)\n\n                We are given the array as a string in `a`, then we split it.\n\n                The current code: \n                    n = len(a)   # but note: a is the string split, so n is the number of elements? \n                    m = max frequency of the elements? \n                    r=0\n                    while m < n:\n                        # then we do something to update r and m? \n\n                But our solution: we want to compute the minimal candidate over distinct frequencies.\n\n                However, the current code does not match our solution.\n\n                How does the note example work? \n                    They do 6 operations. \n\n                The current code: \n                    while m < n:\n                        # then we do something and update r? \n\n                What is the intended solution? \n\n                Known solution from Codeforces (problem C from a recent contest) for the same problem:\n\n                    #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                    using namespace std;\n                    int main() {\n                        ios::sync_with_stdio(false);\n                        cin.tie(nullptr);\n                        int t;\n                        cin >> t;\n                        while (t--) {\n                            int n;\n                            cin >> n;\n                            vector<int> a(n);\n                            map<int, int> mp;\n                            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                                cin >> a[i];\n                                mp[a[i]]++;\n                            }\n                            int maxi = 0;\n                            for (auto x : mp) {\n                                maxi = max(maxi, x.second);\n                            }\n                            int ans = 0;\n                            while (maxi < n) {\n                                ans++;\n                                int d = min(n - maxi, maxi);\n                                ans += d;\n                                maxi += d;\n                            }\n                            cout << ans << \"\\n\";\n                        }\n                        return 0;\n                    }\n\n                Explanation of the known solution:\n\n                    Let maxi = maximum frequency.\n\n                    Then while maxi < n:\n                        ans++   -> this is a clone operation? \n                        Then d = min(n - maxi, maxi)   -> this is the number of swaps we can do in this clone step? \n                        Then ans += d   -> so we add d swaps.\n                        Then maxi += d   -> now the maximum frequency becomes maxi+d.\n\n                    Then when maxi>=n, we break.\n\n                    Why is this correct?\n\n                    Step-by-step for n=6, maxi=2 (for the element 0 or 3):\n\n                        Iteration1: \n                            maxi=2 <6 -> \n                                ans=1 (for the clone) \n                                d = min(6-2, 2)=min(4,2)=2\n                                ans +=2 -> ans=3\n                                maxi = 2+2=4\n                        Iteration2:\n                            maxi=4<6 -> \n                                ans=4 (after clone: 3+1=4)\n                                d = min(6-4,4)=min(2,4)=2\n                                ans +=2 -> 6\n                                maxi=4+2=6 -> break.\n\n                    So total=6.\n\n                    How does it work? \n                        After the first clone, we have two copies. Then we can swap up to maxi (which is 2) elements? \n                        Why 2? Because we can swap two of the non-x elements in the target copy with two x's from the new copy? \n\n                        Then the target copy now has 2 (original) + 2 (swapped in) = 4 x's.\n\n                        Then we clone again: now we have three copies. Then we swap: we can swap up to min(2,4) -> but wait, the new copy has 2 x's? \n\n                        Actually, the known solution: \n                            d = min(n - maxi, maxi) \n\n                        After the first clone, we have two copies. The target copy has 2 x's. The new copy has 2 x's. \n                        We can swap two non-x's from the target copy with two x's from the new copy. Then the target copy now has 4 x's.\n\n                        Then we clone again: now we have three copies. The target copy has 4 x's. The new copy has 2 x's (from the original array) and the other copy has 2 x's? \n                        Actually, we have three copies: \n                            copy1: 4 x's and 2 non-x's? \n                            copy2: 2 x's and 4 non-x's? \n                            copy3: 2 x's and 4 non-x's? \n\n                        Then we can swap two non-x's from copy1 with two x's from copy2 and copy3? \n\n                        But the known solution: \n                            d = min(6-4, 4)=2.\n\n                        Then we do 2 swaps: \n                            We swap two non-x's from copy1 with two x's from copy2 -> then copy1 becomes 6 x's? \n\n                        So total operations: \n                            clone1: 1 op, then 2 swaps: 3 ops.\n                            clone2: 1 op, then 2 swaps: 2 ops -> total 5? \n\n                        But the known solution counts: \n                            Iteration1: ans becomes 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3, then maxi=4.\n                            Iteration2: ans becomes 3+1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 6.\n\n                        So the known solution counts the clone and the swaps in the same iteration.\n\n                    Why is d = min(n-maxi, maxi)? \n                        In one clone operation, we get a new copy. The new copy has maxi x's (because the element x appears maxi times in the original array, and the clone is identical). \n                        Then we can swap up to maxi non-x's in the target copy with x's in the new copy? \n                        But we only need (n-maxi) more x's for the target copy. So we can swap up to min(n-maxi, maxi) in this step.\n\n                        Then the target copy gains min(n-maxi, maxi) x's -> so the new frequency in the target copy becomes maxi + min(n-maxi, maxi).\n\n                    Therefore, the known solution is:\n\n                        ans = 0\n                        maxi = max_frequency\n                        while maxi < n:\n                            ans += 1   # for the clone\n                            # we can swap up to min(n-maxi, maxi) elements\n                            swaps = min(n-maxi, maxi)\n                            ans += swaps\n                            maxi += swaps\n\n                    Then output ans.\n\n                How does it compare to our formula? \n                    Our formula: ceil(n/f)-1 + (n-f)   for the best f.\n\n                    For f=2: ceil(6/2)=3 -> 3-1 + (6-2)=2+4=6.\n\n                    The known solution: 6.\n\n                    For f=4: ceil(6/4)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> 2-1 + (6-4)=1+2=3.\n\n                    But wait, we can choose x that has frequency 4? \n\n                    But the array is [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the maximum frequency is 2. There is no element with frequency 4 initially.\n\n                    So we cannot choose an element that has frequency 4? \n\n                    Therefore, we must start with an element that appears in the original array.\n\n                    The known solution uses the maximum frequency and then grows it.\n\n                    But note: the known solution does not consider using a non-maximal frequency? \n\n                    Example: \n                        n=3, a=[1,1,2]: \n                            maxi=2 (for 1)\n                            while 2<3: \n                                ans=1 (clone)\n                                swaps = min(3-2,2)=1\n                                ans=1+1=2\n                                maxi=2+1=3 -> break.\n                            output 2.\n\n                    Our formula: \n                        for x=1: f=2 -> ceil(3/2)=2 -> candidate= (2-1)+(3-2)=1+1=2.\n                        for x=2: f=1 -> ceil(3/1)=3 -> candidate= (3-1)+(3-1)=2+2=4.\n\n                    So the minimal candidate is 2.\n\n                    Therefore, the known solution is equivalent to using the element with the maximum frequency.\n\n                    Why? \n                        Because the formula: \n                            candidate = ceil(n/f)-1 + (n-f)\n\n                        is minimized when f is as large as possible? \n\n                        Let f1 > f2, then:\n                            ceil(n/f1) <= ceil(n/f2)   (since f1>f2, then n/f1 < n/f2, so ceil(n/f1) <= ceil(n/f2))\n                            and (n-f1) < (n-f2)\n\n                        So the candidate for f1 is less than for f2.\n\n                    Therefore, we only need to consider the maximum frequency.\n\n                    So the solution for program2.py: \n                        We are given the array as a string in `a` in the loop.\n\n                        The current code:\n\n                            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                                while m<n:\n                                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                                print(r)\n\n                        We need to update r and m in the while loop.\n\n                        According to the known solution:\n\n                            while m < n:\n                                r += 1   # for the clone\n                                d = min(n - m, m)   # number of swaps we can do in this step\n                                r += d\n                                m += d\n\n                        Then break when m>=n.\n\n                    Example: n=6, m=2:\n                        iteration1: \n                            r=0 -> then r becomes 1 (clone), then d = min(4,2)=2, then r=1+2=3, then m=2+2=4.\n                        iteration2: \n                            m=4 <6 -> \n                                r=3+1=4 (clone)\n                                d = min(2,4)=2\n                                r=4+2=6\n                                m=4+2=6 -> break.\n\n                    So output 6.\n\n                    Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                            r += 1\n                            d = min(n - m, m)\n                            r += d\n                            m += d\n\n        But note: the variable `n` is the length of the array, and `m` is the maximum frequency.\n\n        However, the current code: \n            n = len(a)   # which is the length of the array? \n            m = max frequency\n\n        Then we do the while loop.\n\n        So the missing block is:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(n - m, m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 100000, and the while loop runs at most O(log n) steps? \n\n        Because m at least doubles? \n            In the first step: m becomes m + min(n-m, m) >= m + min(?, m) -> if m <= n/2, then d = m, so m becomes 2m.\n            Then if m>n/2, then d = n-m, so m becomes n.\n\n        So at most O(log n) steps.\n\n        Therefore, it's efficient.\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(n - m, m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly\"\n\n        We are to output the missing code for both programs.\n\n        Format: \n            {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n        For program1.py: the missing code is one line: \n            total = 1\n            break\n\n        But note: the condition is written as: \n            if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n\n        We must be careful: the condition might be written without parentheses? \n\n        But in Python, \"or\" and \"and\" have priorities: \"and\" has higher priority. So:\n\n            total < 0 or (total !=0 and allzeros)\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            total = 1\n            break\n\n        For program2.py: the missing code is a block of 3 lines:\n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(n - m, m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        But note: the while loop condition: while m<n: ... \n\n        We are updating m and r.\n\n        So the entire code for program2.py after completion:\n\n            from collections import*\n            for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    r += 1\n                    d = min(n - m, m)\n                    r += d\n                    m += d\n                print(r)\n\n        But note: the array `a` is split from a string, and the elements are strings. But the frequency counts: \n            For example, the array might be ['0','1','3','3','7','0'] -> then max frequency is 2 (for '0' and '3').\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, what if the array has negative numbers? \n            The string representation: e.g., ['-1','-1','2'] -> then frequency of '-1' is 2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n        Output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            total = 1\\n            break\",\n                \"program2\": \"            r += 1\\n            d = min(n - m, m)\\n            r += d\\n            m += d\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the indentation. In program1.py, the missing code is inside the for-loop and inside the if-block. The current indentation is 8 spaces? \n\n        In the given program1.py:\n\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                total += x\n                if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                allzeros = allzeros or total == 0\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with two lines. The first line must be indented by 8 more spaces? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is at the same indentation as the condition. We are in the if-block. \n\n        So the two lines should be indented by 12 spaces? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n        We can output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO? \n\n        The TODO is currently at 8 spaces (relative to the for-loop). Then the if-block adds 4 more? \n\n        Actually, the structure:\n\n            for ...:\n                ...   # 4 spaces\n                if ...:   # 4 spaces\n                    ...   # 8 spaces\n\n        So the missing code for program1.py should be two lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, the missing block is inside the while loop, which is inside the for-loop. \n\n        The current while loop:\n\n            while m<n:   # at 4 spaces\n                # TODO: at 8 spaces\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py should be 4 lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        We output the exact lines that would replace the TODO.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py:\n\n            \"            total = 1\\n            break\"\n\n        (each line has 12 spaces? Actually, the TODO is at 8 spaces, but the if-block is at 8 spaces? \n\n        Let me count:\n\n            The for-loop: \n                for ...:   -> 4 spaces\n                then the body: \n                    total += x   -> 8 spaces\n                    if ...:   -> 8 spaces\n                    then the if-block: 12 spaces.\n\n        So the two lines should be indented by 12 spaces.\n\n        But the TODO comment is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the given code:\n\n            input = __import__('sys').stdin.readline\n\n            def solve():\n                n = int(input())\n                allzeros = False\n                total = 0\n                for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                    total += x\n                    if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    allzeros = allzeros or total == 0\n\n                print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO')\n\n        The TODO is at 12 spaces (because the for-loop is 8, and the if is 12).\n\n        So the two lines we add should be at 12 and 12 (with the same indentation).\n\n        We can write:\n\n            \"        total = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        But wait: the for-loop body is 8 spaces, the if-block is 12 spaces. \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for x in ...:\n                ...   # 8 spaces\n                if ...:   # 8 spaces\n                    ...   # 12 spaces\n\n        So the two lines: \n            line1: 12 spaces + \"total = 1\"\n            line2: 12 spaces + \"break\"\n\n        But the next line after the if-block is at 8 spaces: \"allzeros = ...\"\n\n        We break and then we break the for-loop, so we skip the update of allzeros.\n\n        So the code:\n\n            for x in ...:\n                total += x\n                if ...:\n                    total = 1\n                    break\n                allzeros = ...   # skipped if we break\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: \"        total = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        But note: the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is at 12 spaces. We are replacing the TODO with two lines at the same indentation.\n\n        How many spaces? The original code uses 4-space indentation.\n\n        The structure:\n\n            def solve():\n                ...   # 4\n                for ...:   # 4\n                    ...   # 8\n                    if ...:   # 8\n                        ...   # 12\n\n        So we output 12 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output the same indentation as the surrounding code.\n\n        Since the TODO is at the same level, we output the same.\n\n        We can output:\n\n            program1: \"        total = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        with 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Let me count the spaces in the given code for program1.py:\n\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                total += x\n                if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The line with the if: starts at 8 spaces? \n        The TODO line: starts at 12 spaces.\n\n        So we need 12 spaces for each line.\n\n        But the problem: we are to output the missing code. We can output:\n\n            \"            total = 1\\n            break\"\n\n        with 12 spaces per line? \n\n        How? \n\n        We can write: 12 spaces for the first line and 12 spaces for the second.\n\n        But note: the total line length: \n\n            The first line: 12 spaces + \"total = 1\" -> 12+9 = 21\n            The second line: 12 spaces + \"break\" -> 12+5=17\n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces, but we must match the indentation.\n\n        Since the TODO is at 12 spaces, we output 12 spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem says spaces.\n\n        We'll assume 4-space indentation and output 12 spaces (which is 3 indentation levels: 4*3=12).\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py:\n\n            while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        The TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n        The structure:\n\n            for ...:\n                ...   # 4\n                while ...:   # 4\n                    ...   # 8\n\n        So the missing code should be at 8 spaces.\n\n        We output 4 lines, each with 8 spaces.\n\n        But the known solution: \n\n            r += 1\n            d = min(n - m, m)\n            r += d\n            m += d\n\n        So we write:\n\n            \"        r += 1\\n        d = min(n - m, m)\\n        r += d\\n        m += d\"\n\n        with 8 spaces per line.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            total = 1\\n            break\",\n                \"program2\": \"        r += 1\\n        d = min(n - m, m)\\n        r += d\\n        m += d\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2.py code: the while loop condition has a comment: \"# TODO: Your code here\", so we replace that line with the 4 lines.\n\n        We output the 4 lines without the comment.\n\n        So the while loop becomes:\n\n            while m<n:\n                r += 1\n                d = min(n - m, m)\n                r += d\n                m += d\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Let me test with the example n=3, m=2:\n\n            while 2<3 -> true:\n                r=0+1=1\n                d = min(1,2)=1\n                r=1+1=2\n                m=2+1=3 -> break.\n\n        Then print(2) -> correct.\n\n        For program1.py: the example [0,1,-1] (which is invalid) -> \n            step0: x=0 -> total=0 -> condition: 0<0? false. (0!=0 and allzeros) -> allzeros is initially False -> false. Then update: allzeros = False or 0==0 -> True.\n            step1: x=1 -> total=1 -> condition: 1<0? false. (1!=0 and allzeros) -> True -> then we set total=1 and break.\n            Then we print: 'YES' if total==0 else 'NO' -> total=1 -> 'NO'. Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we are done."
