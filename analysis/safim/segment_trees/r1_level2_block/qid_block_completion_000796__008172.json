So we need to change the algorithm. In the known problem (CodeForces 1669F), the solution is:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip()) arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        left = 0\n        right = n-1\n        a = 0\n        b = 0\n        ans = 0\n        while left <= right: if a < b:\n                a += arr[left]\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                b += arr[right]\n                right -= 1\n            if a == b:\n                ans = left + (n - right - 1)\n        print(ans)\n\n For [1,2]:\n   n=2, arr=[1,2]\n   left=0, right=1, a=0, b=0, ans=0.\n   a>=b -> false? -> then we do the else: b += arr[1]=2, right=0.\n   then a==b? 0==2 -> false. then left<=right: 0<=0 -> true. then a=0, b=2 -> a>=b? 0>=2 -> false, so a += arr[0]=1, left=1.\n   then a==b? 1==2 -> false. then left>right -> break, print ans=0. For [1,1]:\n   left=0, right=1.\n   a>=b (0>=0) -> else: b+=arr[1]=1, right=0.\n   a==b? 0==1 -> false. then a>=b? 0>=1 -> false, so a+=arr[0]=1, left=1.\n   a==b? 1==1 -> true, then ans = left + (n - right - 1) = 1 + (2-0-1)=1+1=2. then left>right -> break, print 2. So for [1,2] it outputs 0, for [1,1] outputs 2. But our sample input for the first test case is [1,2] and expected output is 2. So either the sample input for the first test case is [1,1] and not [1,2], or the problem is different.",

Then we need n-1 operations to convert the rest to zeros? \n        - So total = 1 + (n-1) = n. But is that minimum?\n\n   Alternatively, without creating a zero first, can we do better? Example: [1,2] (n=2)\n        Operation1: since 1!=2, change both to min(1,2)=1. -> [1,1]\n        Then in operation2: choose the two 1's, change one of them to 0. -> [0,1]\n        Then in operation3: choose 0 and 1, change both to 0 for the 1? -> wait, the operation: if we choose the 0 and the 1, then since 0!=1, we change both to min(0,1)=0. -> [0,0]. So 3 operations.

Can we do better? Operation1: choose 2 and 3 -> [2,2,3] -> then change to [2,2,2] (because min(2,3)=2) -> wait, the operation: change both to min(2,3)=2, so [2,2,2]. Then in the next operation, choose any two, say the first and second, and since they are equal, set one to 0: [0,2,2]. Then next: choose the 0 and a 2: [0,0,2]. Then next: choose the 0 and the last 2: [0,0,0] -> 4 operations. So seems 4 is the minimum for [1,2,3]. For [1,2] (n=2): \n        We can try:\n          Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> [1,1] (2 operations? because we change both to 1)\n          Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1]\n          Operation3: choose 0 and 1 -> [0,0]\n        -> 3 operations. So the number of operations for a test case with no zeros initially and no duplicates is n, because we need to create a zero and then use it to convert the others, but creating a zero takes more than one operation if there is no duplicate.",

However, if there is at least one duplicate, then we can create a zero in one operation, and then we have non-zeros = n-1 (because we set one candy to zero, the others are non-zero) -> then we need n-1 operations to convert the non-zeros, total = n.\n\n   But is there a possibility to do better if there are more duplicates?",

But the fourth test case for program1.py: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> expected output 7. In the two-pointer approach for the contiguous segments from the left and right with disjoint and the sum equal, we can do:\n\n   a = 0, b = 0\n   left = 0, right = n-1\n   count = 0\n   best = 0\n   while left <= right:\n        if a < b:\n            a += arr[left]\n            left += 1\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            b += arr[right]\n            right -= 1\n            count += 1\n        if a == b:\n            best = count   # or best = max(best, count)\n\n   then print best.\n\n   for [7,3,20,10,8,11,1]:\n        a=0, b=0\n        a< b -> false, so b+=1, right=6-1=5, count=1, a=0, b=1 -> not equal. a< b (0<1) -> true, so a+=7, left=1, count=2, a=7, b=1 -> not equal. a> b, so b+=11, right=4, count=3, a=7, b=12 -> not equal. a< b, so a+=3, left=2, count=4, a=10, b=12 -> not equal.\n        a< b, so a+=20, left=3, count=5, a=30, b=12 -> not equal.\n        a> b, so b+=8, right=3, count=6, a=30, b=20 -> not equal.\n        a> b, so b+=10, right=2, count=7, a=30, b=30 -> equal, best=7.\n\n   then left>right -> break, print 7. So this works. But for [1,2]:\n        a=0, b=0\n        a>=b -> else: b=2, count=1, a=0, b=2 -> not equal.\n        a< b: true, so a=1, count=2, a=1, b=2 -> not equal. then left>right -> break, best=0.\n\n   but expected best=2.\n\n   unless we consider that at count=2, even though a!=b, we force to check if there is a possibility? or we should have recorded the best when a==b only. In the sample [1,1] for n=2:\n        a=0, b=0 -> else: b=1, count=1, a=0, b=1 -> not.\n        then a< b: a=1, count=2, a=1, b=1 -> equal, best=2. so [1,1] works. [1,2] doesn't. But the sample output for [1,2] is 2, which is the total number of candies they ate, even though the sums are not equal?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight they eat to be equal. We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code uses a deque and a while loop. The idea is to have two pointers (or use a deque) to simulate eating from the left and right. However, the current code only pops from the right when a>=b, and we need to complete the else part.\n\nBut note: the current code has a variable `a` for Alice's total and `b` for Bob's total. The variable `cur` counts the total number of candies eaten so far. The condition `if a==b: ans = cur` updates the answer when the weights are equal.\n\nHowever, the current approach is flawed because it always adds to Bob when a>=b, and we need to add to Alice when a < b. But the provided code in the else part is missing.\n\nBut wait: the problem says that Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. The current code uses a deque and in the if part (a>=b) it pops from the right (which is Bob). In the else part, we should pop from the left (for Alice). However, the deque `l` is such that we can pop from the left with `l.popleft()`.\n\nSo the else part should be:\n    a += l.popleft()\n\nBut note: the problem says that they cannot skip candies. So we are simulating by having two pointers (or two ends of the deque). We start with no candies eaten, and then we have two totals: a (for Alice) and b (for Bob). We want to have a and b equal as much as possible, and we record the total number of candies eaten (cur) at the moment they are equal.\n\nHowever, the current code increments `cur` at the beginning of the loop and then does the pop. But note: we are popping one candy at a time. The condition `if a==b` then updates the answer to the current `cur` (which is the total count so far). But note: we are not stopping when we have an equality? We continue until all candies are eaten? Actually, we are popping until the deque is empty.\n\nBut the problem: we are allowed to have Alice and Bob eat arbitrary non-overlapping segments from the left and right respectively. We are not forced to alternate? However, the problem says that if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. And they eat in a row (so contiguous from the ends). But note: the problem does not require that they alternate moves. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten such that the total weight of Alice equals that of Bob.\n\nThe provided algorithm is a two-pointer like approach: we start with no candies, and then we have two pointers at the two ends. We can choose to add to the side that has the smaller current total. This is a common approach for such problems (like the two glasses problem).\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total weight must be equal. We are allowed to have non contiguous segments? Actually, no: Alice eats a contiguous segment from the left, and Bob from the right. But they can eat at different rates? However, the problem does not specify the order of eating. The key is that the candies they eat must be contiguous from the ends and non overlapping.\n\nThe algorithm: we can simulate by having two pointers at the ends and two running totals. We start with Alice at the left and Bob at the right. We can add to Alice if her total is less, or to Bob if his total is less. When the two totals become equal, we record the total number of candies eaten so far (which is the sum of the candies eaten by Alice and Bob). We then continue until we have processed all candies? But note: we are allowed to stop at any time? Actually, the problem does not require that they eat all candies. We are to maximize the total number of candies eaten such that the total weight is equal.\n\nSo we can stop at any time. However, the provided code does not break when we have an equality? It continues until the deque is empty. But that might be because we might get a better (larger) total number of candies later? Actually, we are updating `ans` every time we have an equality. So at the end, we print the last time we had an equality? But note: we might have multiple equalities and we want the maximum total candies. However, the problem says: the maximum number of candies they can eat in total.\n\nBut the algorithm: we are going to simulate until the deque is empty. We start with a=0, b=0. Then we have a while loop that runs until the deque is empty. We increment `cur` (which is the total candies eaten so far) at the beginning. Then if a>=b, we pop from the right and add to b. Otherwise, we pop from the left and add to a. Then if a==b, we set ans = cur.\n\nBut note: we are always popping one candy at a time. This is a greedy approach that is known for problems like \"Maximum Number of Candies Eaten by Two People\" (similar to some CodeForces problems). However, the problem is that we are not allowed to skip candies? But we are forced to eat from the ends? Actually, the problem says: Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (meaning she must eat a contiguous segment starting from the left) and Bob similarly from the right. So the two pointers approach is valid.\n\nBut the issue: we are updating `ans` every time we have an equality. And we are going until the deque is empty. However, we might have an equality in the middle and then later we break it? But we are updating `ans` to the last equality? Actually, we want the maximum total candies. So we should record the maximum `cur` for which a==b. But the current code sets `ans = cur` every time we have an equality. So at the end, we print the last equality we encountered? But what if we have multiple equalities? We want the maximum total candies, so we should record the maximum `cur` for which a==b.\n\nHowever, the problem examples: \nExample 1: [1,2] -> Alice eats [1] (weight=1), Bob eats [2] (weight=2) -> not equal? But wait, the example says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\" -> meaning Alice eats the first (weight=1) and Bob eats the last (weight=2) -> then they are not equal? \n\nWait, the example says: \"For the first test case, ... There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2\". How? They both eat one candy, so total candies is 2. But the weights: 1 and 2 are not equal. \n\nBut note: the example says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\" and then says \"the same total amount of weight\". This is a contradiction? \n\nLooking at the note: \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\" and the example input: the first test case has n=2 and weights [1,2]. How can they have the same total weight? They cannot. But the example says the answer is 2? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" and then the example says the answer is 2. How? \n\nActually, the example says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight.\" -> but 1 != 2. \n\nThis is confusing. But then the note says: \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\" and the example input: the first test case has n=2 and weights [1,2]. \n\nBut the sample input and output: \nInput: \n4\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\nOutput: \n2\n6\n0\n7\n\nSo the first test case: 2 -> output 2.\n\nBut how? They eat two candies and the weights are not equal? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" meaning they must have the same total weight. So if they eat two candies, then Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [2] -> total weight for Alice=1, Bob=2 -> not equal. So that is not valid. \n\nBut the example says the answer is 2. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that they can choose to stop at any time? So they don't have to eat all the candies they are allowed to? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" meaning she can choose to eat 0,1,...,k (contiguous from left). Similarly Bob. \n\nSo for the first test case, if Alice eats 0 candies and Bob eats 0 candies, then they both have 0 -> equal. Then the total candies eaten is 0. But the example says 2? \n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow that they eat simultaneously and stop when the totals become equal? \n\nBut the example: [1,2] -> if Alice eats the first (1) and Bob eats the last (2), then they have 1 and 2 -> not equal. Then they can continue? But there are no more candies. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> meaning she must eat a contiguous segment starting from the left. Similarly Bob. \n\nSo the only possibilities for [1,2]:\n- Alice eats 0, Bob eats 0: total=0 -> valid, total candies=0.\n- Alice eats 0, Bob eats 1: then Bob eats [2] -> Alice=0, Bob=2 -> not equal.\n- Alice eats 0, Bob eats 2: then Bob eats [2,?] but there is only one candy on the right? Actually, Bob eats from the right: he can eat the last candy, or the last two? But there are only two. So Bob can eat [2] or [1,2]? But wait: the candies are [1,2]. Bob eats from the right: so he can eat the last candy (which is 2) and then the next one to the left is 1? But then he would have to eat 1 as well? Because he can't skip? So Bob must eat contiguous from the right. So Bob can eat:\n   - 0: nothing\n   - 1: the last candy (2)\n   - 2: the last two (which is the entire set: [1,2]) but then Alice cannot eat any because they are overlapping? Actually, if Bob eats the entire set, then Alice eats nothing? Then Alice=0, Bob=3 -> not equal.\n\nSimilarly, Alice can eat:\n   - 0: nothing\n   - 1: the first candy (1)\n   - 2: both [1,2]\n\nSo the possibilities for both:\n\nAlice=0, Bob=0: total=0 -> valid, total candies=0.\nAlice=0, Bob=1: Bob eats [2] -> Alice=0, Bob=2 -> not equal.\nAlice=0, Bob=2: Bob eats [1,2] -> Alice=0, Bob=3 -> not equal.\nAlice=1, Bob=0: Alice=1, Bob=0 -> not equal.\nAlice=1, Bob=1: Alice eats [1], Bob eats [2] -> then Alice=1, Bob=2 -> not equal.\nAlice=1, Bob=2: Bob eats [1,2] -> but then the candy 1 is eaten by both? -> not allowed.\nAlice=2, Bob=0: Alice=3, Bob=0 -> not equal.\nAlice=2, Bob=1: Bob eats [2] -> but then candy 2 is eaten by both? -> not allowed.\nAlice=2, Bob=2: entire set by both -> not allowed.\n\nSo the only valid is 0. But the example says 2.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nBut wait: the problem statement says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\"\n\nThis implies that they are allowed to eat simultaneously? And the condition is that at the end, the total weight must be equal? But 1 != 2. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be that they are allowed to eat in turns? And they stop when the totals become equal? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" meaning she decides at the beginning how many to eat? \n\nBut the note says: \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2\" and the sample output is 2.\n\nAfter reading the problem again: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" meaning that the total weight of the candies Alice eats must equal the total weight of the candies Bob eats.\n\nBut in the first test case, if Alice eats the first candy (1) and Bob eats the last candy (2), then 1 != 2. \n\nUnless the problem does not require that they eat non-overlapping candies? But the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So they cannot both eat the same candy.\n\nBut then how is the first test case 2? \n\nI see: the problem says: \"For the first test case, ... There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight.\" -> meaning they cannot achieve the same total weight? Then the answer should be 0? But the example says 2.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might allow that they eat the same candy? But the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\".\n\nI think there is a misunderstanding. \n\nLooking at the sample outputs: \nFirst test case: 2 -> output 2.\nSecond test case: 3 ones -> output 6? How? \n   If they both eat 3 candies? But there are only 3 candies. Then Alice eats all three from the left: total=3, Bob eats all three from the right: total=3 -> equal. Then total candies eaten is 6? But there are only 3 candies. \n\nThis is impossible because they would be eating the same candies twice.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" and \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\". And they cannot overlap. So the entire set of candies is partitioned: some prefix (for Alice) and some suffix (for Bob) and the middle is uneaten? \n\nIn the second test case: [1,1,1]. \n   If Alice eats the first two and Bob eats the last two, then the middle candy (the second one) is eaten by both? -> not allowed.\n\nBut if Alice eats the first one and Bob eats the last one, then they both have 1 -> equal. Then total candies eaten is 2. But the example says 6? \n\nThe example says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" -> but wait, the weights are [1,1,1] so total weight for Alice would be 3, and for Bob would be 3. But how can Bob eat the first three from the right? The candies are [1,1,1]. The first three from the right is the entire set. And Alice also eats the entire set? Then they are overlapping? \n\nThis is impossible.\n\nBut the example says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total).\" \n\nThis implies that they are allowed to eat the same candy twice? But the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\".\n\nAlternatively, the example has different weights? The second test case: the example says the weights are [1,1,1] but then the total weight for Alice is 7? That doesn't match.\n\nLooking at the sample input: \n   The second test case: n=3, weights = [1,1,1] -> but the example says \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that must be a typo. It should be 3.\n\nBut then how can they both eat three candies? There are only three candies. \n\nThe only possibility is that they are allowed to eat overlapping sets? But the problem says they cannot.\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the problem statement: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\"\n\nSo the sets are disjoint.\n\nIn the second test case, if Alice eats the first candy and Bob eats the last two, then Alice=1, Bob=1+1=2 -> not equal.\nIf Alice eats the first two and Bob eats the last one, then Alice=1+1=2, Bob=1 -> not equal.\nIf Alice eats the first three, then Bob eats nothing: Alice=3, Bob=0 -> not equal.\nSimilarly, Bob eats the last three, Alice eats nothing: 0 and 3 -> not equal.\nIf Alice eats the first one and Bob eats the last one: then the middle one is not eaten by anyone. Then Alice=1, Bob=1 -> equal. Total candies eaten=2.\n\nBut the example says the answer is 6.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nLooking at the sample input for the second test case: \n   The first line of the test case: n=3.\n   The second line: 1 1 1.\n\nBut the example says: \"the answer is 6\".\n\nUnless the example meant a different input? The note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\" -> so the weights are not [1,1,1] but something else? \n\nThe sample input has 4 test cases. The second test case has n=3 and weights [1,1,1] -> but the example explanation says total weight 7. \n\nThis indicates that the sample input for the second test case in the note is not [1,1,1] but probably [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] is the fourth test case.\n\nThe sample input is:\n4\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\nSo the second test case is n=3, [1,1,1]. The example explanation for the second test case in the note must be for the fourth test case? \n\nThe note says:\n\"For the second test case, ... answer is 6\"\n\"For the fourth test case, ... answer is 7\"\n\nSo the second test case in the sample input is the one with [1,1,1] and the example explanation for the second test case in the note is actually for the fourth test case? \n\nBut then what is the answer for [1,1,1]? The sample output says 6.\n\nHow can they achieve 6? There are only 3 candies. Total candies eaten cannot exceed 3.\n\nThis is a mystery.\n\nAfter checking known problems: This is a known problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1669/problem/F\n\nIn the problem \"Eating Candies\", the sample input:\n2\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n2\n\nBut the problem statement in the note says for the second test case (with three ones) the answer is 6? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be: \n   There are n candies. Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they take turns. On Alice's turn, she eats one or more candies from the left (but contiguous and she can't skip) and similarly for Bob. But the problem says \"any number\", meaning they can choose how many to eat in one move? But then the moves are not predetermined.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" (at the beginning) and \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" (at the beginning). So it's not interactive.\n\nAfter re\u2010examining the sample output: \n   The sample output for the four test cases: 2, 6, 0, 7.\n\nTest case 1: n=2, [1,2] -> 2\nTest case 2: n=3, [1,1,1] -> 6\nTest case 3: n=3, [1,2,3] -> 0\nTest case 4: n=7, [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> 7\n\nHow can test case 2 be 6? There are only 3 candies.\n\nUnless the answer is not the number of candies but something else? But the problem says: \"print the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\".\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nAfter checking known problems: I recall a problem in CodeForces: https://codeforces.com/contest/1679/problem/B\n\nBut that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be: \n   They are allowed to eat in turns, one candy at a time. Alice starts from the left and Bob from the right. They can stop at any time. The condition is that the total weight of candies eaten by Alice equals that of Bob. And we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nIn this interpretation, for [1,1,1]:\n   Turn 1: Alice eats the first candy (a=1, b=0, candies eaten=1)\n   Turn 2: Bob eats the last candy (a=1, b=1 -> equal, total candies=2)\n   Then they can continue? \n   Turn 3: Alice eats the next candy (the second one) -> a=2, b=1 -> not equal.\n   Turn 4: Bob eats the next candy (which is the second one from the right, but the only one left is the second one) -> then Bob would have 1+1=2, and Alice has 1+1=2 -> equal. Total candies=4.\n   But there are only 3 candies.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nBut wait, after turn 2, there is one candy left in the middle. They cannot eat it without overlapping? \n\nSo the maximum is 2.\n\nBut the sample output for the second test case is 6.\n\nI see the problem: the sample input has t=4, and the second test case has n=3 and weights [1,1,1] -> output 6, but that is not possible.\n\nUnless the sample input for the second test case is not [1,1,1] but something else? \n\nThe problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, \u2026, wn\"\n\nFor the second test case: n=3, and the weights are [1,1,1] -> then output 6.\n\nThis is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the sample output for the second test case is 6 because the example explanation for the second test case in the note is for the fourth test case, and the sample output for the second test case is 6 for a different reason? \n\nBut the sample output is:\n2\n6\n0\n7\n\nSo the second test case outputs 6.\n\nAfter research, I found that this problem is from CodeForces round 784 (Div. 4) problem C: https://codeforces.com/contest/1669/problem/C\n\nBut that problem is about parity.\n\nAlternatively, it might be from an contest: \n\nKnown problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1675/problem/C\n\nNot matching.\n\nAnother known problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1669/problem/F\n\nTitle: Eating Candies\n\nIn the problem: \n   t=4\n   test1: n=2, [1,1] -> output 2\n   test2: n=2, [1,2] -> output 0? but sample output is 2 for the first test case in our problem.\n\nBut in our sample input, the first test case is [1,2] and output 2.\n\nIn the problem \"Eating Candies\" (https://codeforces.com/contest/1669/problem/F), the sample is:\n   Input:\n4\n2\n1 1\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 2 3\n7\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 8 10\n\n   Output:\n2\n0\n0\n7\n\nBut our sample input is:\n4\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\nAnd output:\n2\n6\n0\n7\n\nSo it's not the same.\n\nAt this point, I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement. But since we must complete the code, and the code for program1.py is provided with a TODO, we should complete it as:\n\n    else:\n        a += l.popleft()\n\nAnd then we hope that the algorithm is correct for the sample.\n\nBut the sample [1,2] with this code:\n\n   t=1, n=2, l = deque([1,2])\n   a=0, b=0, ans=0, cur=0.\n   Iteration 1: cur=1. Since a>=b (0>=0 -> true), so b += l.pop() -> b=2.\n        a=0, b=2 -> not equal, so ans not updated.\n   Iteration 2: cur=2. a=0, b=2 -> a>=b is false, so a += l.popleft() -> a=1.\n        then check: a==b? 1==2 -> false.\n   Then print ans=0.\n\nBut the expected output is 2.\n\nSo this does not work.\n\nThe algorithm must be different. In the known problem \"Eating Candies\" (CodeForces 1669F), the solution is to use two pointers at the ends and move in until they meet, and when the sums are equal, record the total number of candies eaten (i+j+1 or something). And then we want the maximum such total.\n\nIn that problem, the sample [1,1] for n=2: \n   Alice: [1] (index0), Bob: [1] (index1) -> then total candies=2, and the sums are equal.\n\nFor [1,2]: \n   Alice: [1] -> sum=1, Bob: [2] -> sum=2 -> not equal.\n   Alice: [1,2] -> sum=3, Bob: nothing -> not equal.\n   Alice: nothing, Bob: [1,2] -> not equal.\n   Alice: [1], Bob: [1,2] -> overlap? not allowed.\n   So no solution -> 0.\n\nBut our sample output for [1,2] is 2.\n\nSo our problem is different.\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the problem statement: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\nThis means that Alice takes a contiguous segment from the left (possibly empty) and Bob takes a contiguous segment from the right (possibly empty), and they must be disjoint. The condition is that the sum of Alice's segment equals the sum of Bob's segment, and we want to maximize the total number of candies in the two segments.\n\nFor [1,2]:\n   Alice takes [1] (sum=1), Bob takes [2] (sum=2) -> not equal.\n   Alice takes [1], Bob takes nothing -> 1 and 0 -> not equal.\n   Alice takes nothing, Bob takes [2] -> 0 and 2 -> not equal.\n   Alice takes nothing, Bob takes nothing -> 0 and 0 -> equal, total candies=0.\n\nSo the maximum is 0.\n\nBut the sample output is 2.\n\n unless they are allowed to eat in turns and stop when the sums are equal, and the total number of candies eaten is the number of turns times 2? \n\nIn that case, for [1,2]:\n   Turn 1: Alice eats the first candy (a=1), then Bob eats the last candy (b=2) -> then we have a=1, b=2, not equal. But then they have eaten 2 candies. But the condition is not satisfied.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem is that they eat simultaneously and in one move. Alice chooses a prefix and Bob chooses a suffix, and they must be disjoint. We want the sum of the prefix = sum of the suffix, and we maximize the total number of candies in the prefix and suffix.\n\nFor [1,2]: \n   The only way to have the sums equal is to have both segments empty -> 0.\n   But the sample output is 2.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nGiven the time, and since the provided code for program1.py has a TODO, and the known approach for such problems is to use two pointers and simulate from both ends, and the sample output for the known problem is 0 for [1,2], but our sample output is 2, I think there might be a mistake in the sample.\n\nBut the problem says: \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2\"\n\nSo we must output 2 for [1,2].\n\nHow can we achieve 2 for [1,2]? \n   If Alice eats the first candy (1) and Bob eats the last candy (2), then the sums are not equal, but the problem says \"There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight\". This implies that there is no way to have the same weight, so they choose to eat nothing? then 0. But the example says 2.\n\n unless the problem is asking for the total number of candies they ate, even if the sums are not equal? But the condition is that they want to be fair, so they only eat if the sums are equal. \n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the sample note: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\"\n\nThis implies that they ate two candies even though the weights are not equal. But the condition is that they want to be fair. So perhaps the problem is: they eat in turns (one move of Alice then one move of Bob) and they can stop at any time. The condition is that at the stop, the total weight must be equal. In the first test case, after Alice eats the first (1) and then Bob eats the last (2), the weights are not equal, so they cannot stop. Then they have no valid way to stop with non-zero weight. So the only valid is the initial state (0,0) -> 0.\n\nThe example says the answer is 2, which is not valid.\n\n unless the problem is: they eat in turns, and they must eat exactly one candy per turn. Alice starts from the left, Bob from the right. They stop when the sum of Alice's eaten candies equals the sum of Bob's eaten candies. If they never are equal, then they eat until there are no candies or until they meet. We want the maximum total number of candies eaten (Alice+Bob) for which at some point the sums were equal.\n\nIn [1,2]:\n   Turn 1: Alice eats the first candy -> a=1, b=0 -> not equal.\n   Turn 2: Bob eats the last candy -> a=1, b=2 -> not equal.\n   Then they stop because no more candies. But at no point were they equal. So the only time they were equal is at the beginning (0,0) -> 0 candies.\n\n So the answer should be 0.\n\nThis matches the known problem.\n\nBut the sample output for the first test case is 2.\n\n unless the problem counts the moves even if they are not equal, and then at the end if they are not equal, they are not fair, so they must choose a stopping point where they are equal. In the first test case, after move 1: a=1, b=0 -> not equal. after move 2: a=1, b=2 -> not equal. So they cannot stop at any move with the sums equal. Therefore, the only valid stop is at move 0: 0 candies.\n\n So the answer is 0.\n\n Given the sample output is 2 for the first test case, and 6 for the second, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n But the fourth test case: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> answer 7.\n\n In the known problem (CodeFor 1669F), the sample input:\n   n=7, [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> output 7.\n\n So our problem is the same as CodeForces 1669F: Eating Candies.\n\n In that problem, the sample:\n   test1: [1,1] -> output 2\n   test2: [1,2] -> output 0\n   test3: [1,2,3] -> output 0\n   test4: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> output 7\n\n But our sample input has:\n   test1: [1,2] -> output 2 ( in the sample, but in known problem it's 0)\n   test2: [1,1,1] -> output 6 ( in the sample, but in known problem for [1,1,1] is 2)\n\n So it's not the same.\n\n Given the time, and since the TODO in program1.py is small, and the provided algorithm is for the two-pointer approach, I will complete it as:\n\n    else:\n        a += l.popleft()\n\n and hope that the sample [1,2] is not the intended.\n\n But the sample [1,2] with this code outputs 0, but expected 2.\n\n So we need to change the algorithm.\n\n In the known problem (CodeForces 1669F), the solution is:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        left = 0\n        right = n-1\n        a = 0\n        b = 0\n        ans = 0\n        while left <= right:\n            if a < b:\n                a += arr[left]\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                b += arr[right]\n                right -= 1\n            if a == b:\n                ans = left + (n - right - 1)\n        print(ans)\n\n For [1,2]:\n   n=2, arr=[1,2]\n   left=0, right=1, a=0, b=0, ans=0.\n   a>=b -> false? -> then we do the else: b += arr[1]=2, right=0.\n   then a==b? 0==2 -> false.\n   then left<=right: 0<=0 -> true.\n   then a=0, b=2 -> a>=b? 0>=2 -> false, so a += arr[0]=1, left=1.\n   then a==b? 1==2 -> false.\n   then left>right -> break, print ans=0.\n\n For [1,1]:\n   left=0, right=1.\n   a>=b (0>=0) -> else: b+=arr[1]=1, right=0.\n   a==b? 0==1 -> false.\n   then a>=b? 0>=1 -> false, so a+=arr[0]=1, left=1.\n   a==b? 1==1 -> true, then ans = left + (n - right - 1) = 1 + (2-0-1)=1+1=2.\n   then left>right -> break, print 2.\n\n So for [1,2] it outputs 0, for [1,1] outputs 2.\n\n But our sample input for the first test case is [1,2] and expected output is 2.\n\n So either the sample input for the first test case is [1,1] and not [1,2], or the problem is different.\n\n The sample input says: \n  4\n  2\n  1 2\n  ...\n\n so it is [1,2].\n\n Given the provided code in program1.py is:\n\n   from collections import deque\n   for _ in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input())\n        l = deque(map(int, input().split()))\n        a, b = 0, 0\n        ans = 0\n        cur = 0\n        while l:\n            cur+=1\n            if a>=b:\n                b += l.pop()\n            else:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            if a==b:\n                ans = cur\n        print(ans)\n\n For [1,2]:\n   Start: l = deque([1,2])\n   Iteration1: cur=1, a>=b (0>=0) -> true, so b = 0+2 = 2, then a!=b, so ans not updated.\n   Iteration2: cur=2, a=0, b=2 -> a>=b is false, so we need to do the else. If we do a += l.popleft() -> a=1.\n        then a==b? 1==2 -> false.\n   then print ans=0.\n\n To get 2, we would need that at some point a==b and cur=2.\n\n So after the second iteration, if we set ans=2, but a!=b.\n\n unless we do the if a==b after the pop or popleft, and in the second iteration after the else part, a=0+1=1, b=2, not equal.\n\n So how to get 2 for [1,2] with this code? \n\n One possibility: they are allowed to eat the same candy? then for [1,2], if Alice eats the first (1) and Bob eats the first (1) (from the right? but the first from the right is 2) -> not.\n\n Another possibility: the condition a==b is checked after every candy eaten, and in the first test case, after the first candy eaten by Alice and the first candy eaten by Bob, even though the sums are not equal, we still count it? -> but the problem says they want the sums to be equal.\n\n Given the complexity, and since the second program is waiting, I will output for program1.py the code for the else part as `a += l.popleft()`, and for the sample [1,2] it outputs 0, but the expected is 2, so it's not correct.\n\n But the sample test case 2: [1,1,1] -> with this code:\n\n   l = deque([1,1,1])\n   Iteration1: cur=1, a>=b -> true, so b=1, then a==b? 0==1 -> false.\n   Iteration2: cur=2, a=0, b=1 -> a<b, so else: a=1, then a==b? 1==1 -> true, so ans=2.\n   Iteration3: cur=3, a=1, b=1 -> a>=b -> true, so b=1+1=2, then a==b? 1==2 -> false.\n   Then print ans=2.\n\n But the expected output is 6.\n\n So clearly not.\n\n I think the problem in program1.py is not this.\n\n After re\u2010reading the problem statement: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" (at once) and \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" (at once). So they each make one move. The move: Alice chooses a prefix (0 or more from the left) and Bob chooses a suffix (0 or more from the right) and the condition is that the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix, and the two segments are disjoint. We want to maximize the total number of candies in the union of the prefix and the suffix.\n\n For [1,2]:\n   The only way to have the sums equal is to have both empty -> 0.\n   or if we allow the entire array for both, but then they overlap.\n\n so 0.\n\n For [1,1,1]:\n   if Alice takes the first 1 and Bob takes the last 1, then the middle 1 is not taken. Then the sums are 1 and 1 -> equal. Total candies = 2.\n   if Alice takes the first 2 (sum=2) and Bob takes the last 1 (sum=1) -> not equal.\n   if Alice takes the first 1 and Bob takes the last 2 (sum=1 and sum=2) -> not equal.\n   if Alice takes nothing and Bob takes the last 1 -> 0 and 1 -> not equal.\n   etc.\n   So the maximum is 2.\n\n the sample expected output for the second test case is 6, which is not possible.\n\n Given the fourth test case: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> output 7.\n\n In this test case, n=7.\n   Alice takes [7,3,20] -> sum=30\n   Bob takes [10,8,11,1] -> sum=30\n   and they are disjoint: the first three and the last four.\n   total candies = 7.\n\n So the condition is that the two segments are disjoint and cover the entire array? or not necessarily? In this case, the middle is empty.\n\n So the solution for the fourth test case is valid.\n\n For the second test case [1,1,1]: \n   if Alice takes [1,1] (sum=2) and Bob takes [1] (sum=1) -> not equal.\n   if Alice takes [1] (sum=1) and Bob takes [1,1] (sum=2) -> not equal.\n   if Alice takes [1] and Bob takes [1] (the last one) -> then the middle one is not taken, and sums are 1 and 1 -> equal. total=2.\n\n So the maximum is 2.\n\n why does the sample output say 6 for the second test case? \n\n Unless the sample input for the second test case is not [1,1,1] but a different one. The sample input says:\n  3\n  1 1 1\n\n so it is [1,1,1].\n\n Given the provided code in program1.py is not for this solution, and the TODO is in the else part, and the sample expected output for the second test case is 6, which is not possible, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n But note: the problem says: \" the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\u00b710^5\"\n\n and the provided code uses a deque and a while loop that may run in O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\n Given the complexity, and since we have to output the code, I will complete program1.py as:\n\n    else:\n        a += l.popleft()\n\n and for program2.py, we have to complete the else part.\n\n For program2.py: \n   The problem: minimum number of operations to make the sequence all zeros.\n\n   In the operation: choose two distinct indices i, j.\n        if a_i = a_j, change one of them to 0.\n        else, change both to min(a_i, a_j).\n\n   We want the minimum number of operations.\n\n   The provided code: \n        if 0 in a:\n            print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   In the else part, there are no zeros initially.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   We can consider the following:\n   - If there is a duplicate, we can use one operation to change one of them to 0 (by choosing two indices with the same value and then setting one to 0).\n   - Then we can use the 0 to change others: because once we have a 0, we can do: choose 0 and a non-zero, then since 0 and x are not equal, we change both to min(0,x)=0. So one operation can eliminate one non-zero.\n\n   But initially, if there is no zero, we need to create a zero.\n\n   How to create a zero? \n        - If there is a duplicate, we can create a zero in one operation (by setting one of the duplicates to 0).\n        - Then the number of operations = 1 (to create the zero) + (n-1 - count(0 after this)) ... but after creating one zero, we have one zero and the rest non-zeros. Then we need n-1 operations to convert the rest to zeros? \n        - So total = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n\n   But is that minimum?\n\n   Alternatively, without creating a zero first, can we do better? \n\n   Example: [1,2] (n=2)\n        Operation1: since 1!=2, change both to min(1,2)=1. -> [1,1]\n        Then in operation2: choose the two 1's, change one of them to 0. -> [0,1]\n        Then in operation3: choose 0 and 1, change both to 0 for the 1? -> wait, the operation: if we choose the 0 and the 1, then since 0!=1, we change both to min(0,1)=0. -> [0,0]. \n        So 3 operations.\n\n   But if we do:\n        Operation1: choose the two (1 and2) -> [1,1] (operation1)\n        Operation2: choose the two 1's -> change one to 0: [0,1] (operation2)\n        Operation3: choose 0 and 1 -> [0,0] (operation3)\n        -> 3 operations.\n\n   But the sample in the note for [1,1,3] takes 4 operations.\n\n   In the sample in the problem note: \n        [1,2,3] -> operations: \n          1: choose a1=1 and a2=2 -> since 1<2, change both to 1: [1,1,3]\n          2: choose the two 1's: change one to 0: [0,1,3]\n          3: choose the 0 and 1: change the 1 to 0: [0,0,3]\n          4: choose the 0 and 3: change the 3 to 0: [0,0,0]\n        -> 4 operations.\n\n   So for [1,2] (n=2) -> 3 operations.\n\n   But the sample input for the first test case in the note has [1,2,3] and n=3, and output 4.\n\n   Now, in the provided code, for a test case with no zeros, we are in the else part.\n\n   What is the minimum number of operations for a sequence with no zeros and no duplicates? \n        We can create a zero in one operation if there is a duplicate, but if there is no duplicate, we cannot create a zero in one operation.\n\n   How to create a zero without a duplicate? \n        We can choose two distinct numbers, say x and y (x<y), then we change both to x. \n        Then we may create a duplicate.\n\n   For example, [1,2,3]:\n        We can do:\n          Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> [1,1,3]  (now we have a duplicate)\n          Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1,3] (now we have a zero)\n          Then we need two more operations: for the 1 and the 3.\n          Operation3: choose 0 and 1 -> [0,0,3]\n          Operation4: choose 0 and 3 -> [0,0,0]\n        -> 4 operations.\n\n   Can we do better? \n        Operation1: choose 2 and 3 -> [2,2,3] -> then change to [2,2,2] (because min(2,3)=2) -> wait, the operation: change both to min(2,3)=2, so [2,2,2].\n        Then in the next operation, choose any two, say the first and second, and since they are equal, set one to 0: [0,2,2].\n        Then next: choose the 0 and a 2: [0,0,2].\n        Then next: choose the 0 and the last 2: [0,0,0] -> 4 operations.\n\n   So seems 4 is the minimum for [1,2,3].\n\n   For [1,2] (n=2): \n        We can try:\n          Operation1: choose 1 and 2 -> [1,1] (2 operations? because we change both to 1)\n          Operation2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1]\n          Operation3: choose 0 and 1 -> [0,0]\n        -> 3 operations.\n\n   So the number of operations for a test case with no zeros initially and no duplicates is n, because we need to create a zero and then use it to convert the others, but creating a zero takes more than one operation if there is no duplicate.\n\n   Specifically, if there is at least one duplicate, then we can create a zero in one operation, and then convert the rest in n-1 operations, total n.\n   If there is no duplicate, then we can create a duplicate in one operation (by choosing two distinct numbers and setting both to the minimum, which will create a duplicate of the minimum), then in the next operation we can create a zero from the duplicate, and then convert the rest in n-2 operations, total n.\n\n   Therefore, in both cases, the number of operations is n.\n\n   But wait, in the example [1,2] (n=2) -> 3 = n+1.\n\n   For n=2, we have 2 elements. \n        If there is a duplicate initially: then we can do one operation to set one to 0, then one operation to set the other to 0? -> total 2.\n        If not, then 3.\n\n   So the else part in the code is for the case with no zeros and ... \n\n   The code currently: \n        if 0 in a:\n            print(len(a) - a.count(0))\n        else:\n            # TODO\n\n   In the if part: if there is at least one zero, then the number of operations is the number of non-zeros. Why? \n        Because with a zero available, in one operation we can convert one non-zero to zero: choose the zero and a non-zero, then since 0 and x are not equal, we change both to 0. But wait, we have to choose two indices. If we choose the zero and a non-zero, we set both to 0. But then we create an extra zero? \n        Example: [0,1,2] (n=3)\n            non-zeros: 2.\n            Operation1: choose the 0 and 1 -> set both to 0: [0,0,2] -> now non-zeros: 1.\n            Operation2: choose the 0 and 2 -> set both to 0: [0,0,0] -> 2 operations = number of non-zeros.\n\n        So that works.\n\n   For the else part (no zeros initially), we need to create a zero first.\n\n   How many operations to create the first zero? \n        - If there is a duplicate, we can create a zero in one operation: choose two duplicates and set one to 0.\n        - If there is no duplicate, then we need to create a duplicate first: one operation to set two distinct numbers to the minimum (which will create a duplicate), then one operation to set one of the duplicates to 0. Then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros. Then we need to convert the remaining n-2 non-zeros to zeros, which takes n-2 operations. \n          total = 1 (create duplicate) + 1 (create zero) + (n-2) = n.\n\n        - If there is a duplicate, then we can create a zero in one operation, and then convert the remaining n-2 non-zeros in n-2 operations, total = 1 + (n-2) = n-1.\n\n   But wait, if there is a duplicate, then initially there are at least two identical numbers. We can set one of them to 0 in one operation. Then we have n-1 non-zeros (because one became zero and the other duplicate is still there) and one zero. Then we can use the zero to convert the others: n-1 non-zeros would take n-1 operations. \n        total = 1 ( for creating the zero) + (n-1) = n.\n\n   This is not n-1.\n\n   Alternatively, after creating the zero, can we convert two at a time? \n        In one operation with the zero and a non-zero, we can convert that non-zero to zero. So one non-zero per operation.\n\n   Therefore, if there is at least one duplicate, the total operations = 1 ( to create the zero from the duplicate) + (n-1) [ to convert the other n-1 non-zeros] = n.\n\n   If there is no duplicate, then we need two operations to create the first zero ( first create a duplicate, then convert one of them to zero) and then n-2 operations for the remaining non-zeros, total = 2 + (n-2) = n.\n\n   Therefore, in both cases, the number of operations is n.\n\n   But for n=2 and no duplicate: [1,2] -> n=2, then operations=2? but we saw it takes 3.\n\n   Contradiction.\n\n   Let's do [1,2] (n=2, no duplicate, no zero):\n        Option1: \n           op1: choose 1 and 2 -> set both to 1: [1,1] (now we have a duplicate)\n           op2: choose the two 1's -> set one to 0: [0,1]\n           op3: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0: [0,0]\n           -> 3 operations.\n\n        Option2: \n           op1: choose 1 and 2 -> set both to 1: [1,1] \n           op2: choose the two 1's -> set the other to 0: [0,0]  -> 2 operations? \n                 In op2: when we choose two 1's, we can only change one of them to 0, not both. The problem says: \"change one of them to 0\". So in one operation on two duplicates, we can only set one of them to 0. The other remains 1.\n\n        Therefore, option2 is not valid for turning both to 0 in op2.\n\n   So it takes 3 operations for [1,2].\n\n   Therefore, the formula is not n.\n\n   Let's derive:\n\n        Let m = number of zeros initially = 0.\n        We need to create the first zero.\n            - If there is a duplicate, we can create a zero in 1 operation, and then we have m' = 1 and non-zeros = n-1.\n               then we need to convert the non-zeros: with a zero available, each operation can convert one non-zero to zero, so n-1 operations.\n               total = 1 + (n-1) = n.\n            - If there is no duplicate, then we need to create a duplicate first: 1 operation (choose two distinct numbers and set both to the minimum, which will create a duplicate of the minimum) -> then we have a duplicate and no zero.\n               then in the next operation, we can create a zero from the duplicate: 1 operation.\n               then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros = n-2 (because in the first operation we changed two numbers to the minimum, and in the second operation we changed one of the duplicates to zero) -> then we need n-2 operations to convert the non-zeros.\n               total = 1+1+(n-2) = n.\n\n        But wait, in the no duplicate case, after the first operation, we have a duplicate, but also we might have created a zero? no, because we set to the minimum of the two, which is not zero.\n\n        However, in the no duplicate case, after the first operation, we have a duplicate and still no zero. Then in the second operation, we can take two identical numbers (the duplicates) and set one of them to 0. Then we have one zero and the rest non-zeros. The number of non-zeros is n-1? because in the first operation, we changed two numbers to the minimum, and in the second operation, we changed one of them to 0. So the other one remains (as a non-zero) and the rest n-2 numbers are unchanged non-zeros. So non-zeros = (n-2) [unchanged] + 1 [ the other duplicate] = n-1.\n\n        Therefore, we need n-1 additional operations -> total = 2 + (n-1) = n+1.\n\n   For [1,2] (n=2): 2+ (2-1) = 3, which matches.\n\n   So summary:\n        if there is at least one zero initially:\n            operations = number of non-zeros = n - count(0)\n\n        else:\n            if there is at least one duplicate (at least one value appears at least twice) in the array:\n                operations = n   [ because: 1 ( to create a zero from a duplicate) + (n-1) ( to convert the rest) ]\n            else:\n                operations = n+1   [ because: 1 ( to create a duplicate) + 1 ( to create a zero from the duplicate) + (n-1) ( to convert the rest) ]\n\n   But wait, in the else branch (no duplicate), after creating the duplicate and then a zero, we have n-1 non-zeros? \n        Initially: n non-zeros, no duplicates.\n        Step1: create duplicate: choose two distinct numbers, say a_i and a_j, and set both to min(a_i,a_j). This changes two numbers to the same value. Now we have n-2+1 = n-1 numbers? no, we have n numbers: two of them are now the same (min_value), and the others unchanged. So we have n-2 unchanged non-zeros and 2 duplicates (non-zero) -> non-zeros = n.\n        Then in step2: we create a zero: choose the two duplicates and set one of them to 0. Then we have: one zero, one duplicate (non-zero), and n-2 unchanged non-zeros -> non-zeros = n-1.\n        Then we need n-1 operations to convert the non-zeros to zeros using the available zero.\n        total = 1 (step1) + 1 (step2) + (n-1) = n+1.\n\n   Therefore, the else part can be:\n\n        else:\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(n+1)\n            else:\n                print(n)\n\n   But note: the array might have more than one duplicate, but we only care if there is at least one duplicate.\n\n   However, if there is at least one duplicate, then we can create a zero in one operation, and then we have non-zeros = n-1 (because we set one candy to zero, the others are non-zero) -> then we need n-1 operations to convert the non-zeros, total = n.\n\n   But is there a possibility to do better if there are more duplicates? Probably not, because we can only create one zero per operation from a duplicate, and then one non-zero per operation.\n\n   So the else part: \n        if there is no zero, then if there is any duplicate in the array, then operations = n.\n        else (no duplicate) then operations = n+1.\n\n   Let's test with the sample from the note: [1,2,3] (n=3) -> no duplicate initially, so operations = 3+1 = 4. -> matches.\n\n   [1,2] (n=2) -> no duplicate initially, so operations = 2+1 = 3. -> matches.\n\n   [1,1,2] (n=3) -> has a duplicate (1 appears twice), and no zero initially, so operations = 3.\n\n   How to do [1,1,2] in 3 operations:\n        op1: because there is a duplicate (1), choose two 1's and set one to 0: [0,1,2]\n        op2: choose 0 and 1 -> set both to 0: [0,0,2]\n        op3: choose 0 and 2 -> set both to 0: [0,0,0]\n        -> 3 operations.\n\n   [1,2,2] -> similarly.\n\n   [1,1,1] (n=3) -> has duplicate, so operations = 3.\n        op1: choose two 1's and set one to 0: [0,1,1]\n        op2: choose the two 1's and set one to 0: [0,0,1]\n        op3: choose the two zeros? -> but we need to choose two distinct indices. We can choose a zero and the 1: set both to 0: [0,0,0]\n        -> 3 operations.\n\n   But the sample input for program1.py's second test case is [1,1,1] and it is for program1.py, not program2.py.\n\n   For program2.py, the sample input in the note: \n        \"In the first test case\" (for program2.py) has [1,2,3] -> output 4.\n\n   Therefore, the else part for program2.py is:\n\n        else:\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(n+1)\n            else:\n                print(n)\n\n   But wait, the variable `a` is the list, and `n` is the length.\n\n   However, the code in program2.py has:\n\n        input()\n        a = [*getInts()]\n\n   and then if 0 in a: ... else: ...\n\n   and in the else part, we have the array `a` and `n = len(a)`? \n\n   But the variable `n` is not defined in the else part. We can use `len(a)`.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        else:\n            if len(set(a)) == len(a):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n   But the problem says the first line of the test case is `n`, and then the list of `n` integers. In the function `solve()`, we do `input()` to read the first line (which is n) and then `a = [*getInts()]` which has `n` integers.\n\n   We can use `n = len(a)`.\n\n   But the code already read `n` with `input()`, but we didn't save it. We did:\n\n        input()\n        a = [*getInts()]\n\n   So `len(a)` is the same as the `n` from the input.\n\n   Therefore, we can use `k = len(a)`.\n\n   But to be safe, we can use `n_val = len(a)`.\n\n   However, the problem says the first line is the integer `n`, and then a list of `n` integers. So `len(a)` should be `n`.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        else:\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n   But note: the sample test case in the note for program2.py has n=3, [1,2,3] -> output 4.\n\n   This matches: since [1,2,3] has no duplicate, so output 3+1=4.\n\n   Another sample: [1,1,2] -> output 3.\n\n   Therefore, we output for program2.py in the else part:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\n However, the problem says: the first line of the test case is `n`, and we read it with `input()`, but then we don't use it. We can also use `n` from the first read, but we didn't save it. We did `input()` and then read `a` of length `n`.\n\n So in the else part, we have `a` as the list, and we can use `len(a)`.\n\n But note: the first line of the test case is read by `input()` and then the next line is the list. So the `input()` in the first line is not used. We can use `n = len(a)`.\n\n However, the problem says the first line is `n`, and then a list of `n` integers. So `len(a)` should be `n`.\n\n So the code for program2.py's else part is:\n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\n But wait, the sample input might have extra spaces? but the problem says the second line has `n` integers.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, we are still not sure.\n\n Given the time, and since the problem for program1.py is not clear, and the provided code for program1.py does not work for the sample [1,2] (outputs 0 but expected 2), I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement for program1.py.\n\n But the fourth test case for program1.py: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> expected output 7.\n\n In the two-pointer approach for the contiguous segments from the left and right with disjoint and the sum equal, we can do:\n\n   a = 0, b = 0\n   left = 0, right = n-1\n   count = 0\n   best = 0\n   while left <= right:\n        if a < b:\n            a += arr[left]\n            left += 1\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            b += arr[right]\n            right -= 1\n            count += 1\n        if a == b:\n            best = count   # or best = max(best, count)\n\n   then print best.\n\n   for [7,3,20,10,8,11,1]:\n        a=0, b=0\n        a< b -> false, so b+=1, right=6-1=5, count=1, a=0, b=1 -> not equal.\n        a< b (0<1) -> true, so a+=7, left=1, count=2, a=7, b=1 -> not equal.\n        a> b, so b+=11, right=4, count=3, a=7, b=12 -> not equal.\n        a< b, so a+=3, left=2, count=4, a=10, b=12 -> not equal.\n        a< b, so a+=20, left=3, count=5, a=30, b=12 -> not equal.\n        a> b, so b+=8, right=3, count=6, a=30, b=20 -> not equal.\n        a> b, so b+=10, right=2, count=7, a=30, b=30 -> equal, best=7.\n\n   then left>right -> break, print 7.\n\n   So this works.\n\n   But for [1,2]:\n        a=0, b=0\n        a>=b -> else: b=2, count=1, a=0, b=2 -> not equal.\n        a< b: true, so a=1, count=2, a=1, b=2 -> not equal.\n        then left>right -> break, best=0.\n\n   but expected best=2.\n\n   unless we consider that at count=2, even though a!=b, we force to check if there is a possibility? \n\n   or we should have recorded the best when a==b only.\n\n   In the sample [1,1] for n=2:\n        a=0, b=0 -> else: b=1, count=1, a=0, b=1 -> not.\n        then a< b: a=1, count=2, a=1, b=1 -> equal, best=2.\n\n   so [1,1] works.\n\n   [1,2] doesn't.\n\n   But the sample output for [1,2] is 2, which is the total number of candies they ate, even though the sums are not equal? \n\n   Given the problem statement: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\"\n\n   This implies that they ate two candies, even though the sums are not equal. But the condition is that they want to be fair (sums equal). \n\n   So the only explanation is that the problem is not requiring that the sums are equal, but something else. \n\n   Given the time, and since we have to output the code, and the fourth test case works with the two-pointer approach (output 7) and the sample [1,1] works (output 2), and the sample [1,1,1] ( which is the second test case in the input) with this approach:\n\n        [1,1,1]:\n            a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> else: b=1, count=1, a=0, b=1.\n            a< b -> a=1, count=2, a=1, b=1 -> equal, best=2.\n            then a>=b -> else: b=1, count=3, a=1, b=2 -> not.\n            then a< b -> a=1, but left is at index 2, and right is at index 0? -> left>right, break.\n            output 2.\n\n   but the expected output for the second test case is 6.\n\n   So unless the second test case in the sample input is not [1,1,1] but a different one, we are not matching.\n\n   The sample input says for the second test case: n=3, weights = [1,1,1] -> output 6.\n\n   This is not possible.\n\n   Therefore, I will output for program1.py the else part as `a += l.popleft()`, and for program2.py the else part as above.\n\n   And hope that the online judge has the test cases as in the known problem.\n\n   For program1.py, we are not passing the sample [1,2] (expected 2, we output 0) and [1,1,1] (expected 6, we output 2), but the fourth test case we output 7 which is correct.\n\n   Given the instructions, we must output only the missing code.\n\n   For program1.py, the missing code is one line: `a += l.popleft()`\n\n   For program2.py, the missing code is a block: \n\n        if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n            print(len(a)+1)\n        else:\n            print(len(a))\n\n   But the problem says: Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n   Note: program1.py and program2.py are separate programs. We are not piping the output of program1.py to the input of program2.py in the usual sense. The command is \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\", which means the output of program1.py is the input of program2.py.\n\n   But program1.py outputs the answer for each test case ( an integer) for t test cases, and program2.py also expects t test cases.\n\n   So the output of program1.py is the input of program2.py.\n\n   But the problem for program1.py and program2.py are different. This is not specified.\n\n   Given the complexity, I will output the code as described.\n\n   Therefore, the answer is:\n\n   {\n     \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n     \"program2\": \"if len(a) == len(set(a)):\\n        print(len(a)+1)\\n    else:\\n        print(len(a))\"\n   }\n\n But note: in program2.py, the else part is intended to be at the same indentation as the print in the if.\n\n   In program2.py, the current code in the else part is:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with the if-else block.\n\n   The code for program2.py after completion would be:\n\n        else:\n            if len(a) == len(set(a)):\n                print(len(a)+1)\n            else:\n                print(len(a))\n\n   But the sample [1,2,3] in program2.py has n=3, and it will output 4.\n\n   This matches the sample in the note.\n\n   So we output."
