But the problem asks for indices. There is a possibility: the problem intended to say that the first test case has n=5, not 6. So the input for the first test case should be:\n\n                5\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n\n          Then the distinct string pairs are 5, and the index pairs are 5. So the sample input in the problem is:\n\n                3\n                5\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                4   # because the second test case has 4 strings: aa, cc, ac, ca?",

So the missing code is: s = m+1\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: s = m+1\n\n          Let me test with the sample: \n             n=1: \n                 s=0, e= (say the array has at least index0,1,2,3,...)\n                 initially: s=0, e= let's say the last index is L (>=2) m = (0+L)//2, if cnt[m] < 1, then s = m+1.\n                 then eventually s becomes 2.\n\n          n=2: similarly s becomes 2.\n\n          n=3: \n             cnt[2]=2<3 -> then s becomes m+1, then next iteration: s=3, e=3 -> return 3.\n\n          n=0: then we return 0. But the sample output for the second test case is 2 for n= something that is<=2, and 3 for n= something>=3 and <=6. The sample input for the second test case is n=2, then output is 2. The third test case: n=3, output is 3. But the problem says for the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines. However, the sample output in the problem for program1.py's test cases is:\n\n                5\n                6\n                0\n\n          and for program2.py, the sample input is:\n\n                t=? then n values: probably the first test case n=2, then n= something else.

Note: the sample input for program1.py might be intended to be with n=5, then our code would output 5, and for the second test case with n=4 (distinct strings) we would output 8, but the problem sample output for the second test case is 6, which we cannot achieve. But the problem says the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, and our code is the known solution, so we output it.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\nThe current code uses a Counter to count the frequency of each string.\nThe current loop is:\n  for x in s:\n    for y in s:\n      if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])):\n          ... (missing code)\n\nBut note: This condition is too broad. It includes pairs that have the same first letter OR the same second letter, but we want pairs that have exactly one position different. That means we want pairs that are either:\n  - same first letter and different second letter, OR\n  - same second letter and different first letter.\n\nHowever, the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) would also include pairs that are identical (if both are same) and pairs that have both positions same? Actually, note that if the two strings are identical, then both positions are same, so we skip because of x!=y? But wait, the condition also includes pairs that are identical in one position and different in the other? Actually, the condition includes:\n  Case 1: same first letter -> then we require the second letter to be different? But the condition doesn't check that. Similarly, same second letter and then first letter different? But the condition doesn't enforce the other to be different.\n\nSo the current condition would include:\n  - pairs that are identical? -> no, because x!=y, but note: if two strings are identical, then they are the same key? Actually, the Counter keys are unique. So we are iterating over distinct strings. But the frequency matters: we have to account for multiple occurrences.\n\nThe problem: The current code does not account for frequency. We are iterating over distinct strings and then counting each pair (x,y) once. But if a string appears k times, then the pairs within that group are not considered.\n\nSo we must change the approach.\n\nWe can use the following idea:\n\nTotal pairs that differ in exactly one position = \n  (pairs that have the same first letter and different second letter) \n  + (pairs that have the same second letter and different first letter)\n\nBut note: if we have a string \"ab\", then:\n  - For same first letter: we look at all strings with first letter 'a' and second letter not 'b'\n  - For same second letter: we look at all strings with second letter 'b' and first letter not 'a'\n\nBut we cannot have a pair that is counted in both? because if two strings have the same first letter and same second letter, then they are identical and we skip. And if they have same first and same second, they are identical. So the two sets are disjoint.\n\nSo we can do:\n\nLet:\n  freq = Counter of all strings.\n\n  We also create:\n    by_first = defaultdict(Counter)   # key: first char, value: Counter of second chars\n    by_second = defaultdict(Counter)  # key: second char, value: Counter of first chars\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do O(n) per test.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  For each distinct string (a,b) with frequency f, then:\n    - The pairs that have the same first letter and different second letter: \n        We look at all strings with first letter a and second letter != b. Let total_a = sum(by_first[a].values())\n        Then the count for this group for same first letter and different second is: total_a - f   (because we subtract the ones that are (a,b))\n    - Similarly, for same second letter: total_b = sum(by_second[b].values()) and then subtract f.\n\nBut then we would be counting each pair twice? Because each pair (i,j) is considered when we look at the string i and when we look at the string j? Actually, no: if we do for each distinct string, then we are counting each pair twice? Because the pair (i,j) will be considered when we look at i and when we look at j.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  total = 0\n  for each distinct string (a,b) with frequency f:\n      same_first = by_first[a].total()   # total number of strings with first letter a\n      same_second = by_second[b].total() # total number of strings with second letter b\n\n      Then the pairs that have the same first letter (and then second letter different) that involve this string: \n          We can consider: for the group of first letter a, the pairs that have the same first letter and different second letter: \n          Actually, the entire group of first letter a: the pairs that have the same first letter and different second letter are the pairs of two strings in the group that have different second letters? But note: we are not required to count pairs of two different second letters? Actually, we want pairs that have the same first letter and different second letter. And that is the same as: for the group of first letter a, the number of pairs is: \n             total_pairs_in_group = C(total_a, 2) - (sum_{each second char c in group} C(freq(a,c), 2))\n          But wait, that counts all pairs that are in the same first letter group and have different second letters? Actually, no: \n             total pairs in the group = C(total_a,2)\n             pairs that have the same second letter = for each second letter c: C(freq(a,c),2)\n             so the pairs that have the same first letter and same second letter are subtracted? But we don't want those. We want the pairs that have same first and different second? Actually, that is exactly: total_pairs_in_group - (sum of pairs that are same second) = \n                 C(total_a,2) - sum_{c} C(freq(a,c),2)\n\n      Similarly, for same second letter: \n          total_pairs_in_second_group = C(total_b,2) - sum_{each first char c} C(freq(c,b),2)\n\n  But note: the pairs that we are interested in are exactly the union of these two sets? And they are disjoint? Actually, a pair that has same first letter and same second letter is not in either? But we are not counting those. And a pair that has same first and different second is in the first set, and same second and different first is in the second set. And a pair that has both different? we skip.\n\n  However, the problem: we are iterating by groups. We can precompute:\n\n      total_same_first = 0\n      for a in by_first:\n          total_a = sum(by_first[a].values())\n          for c in by_first[a]:\n              count_c = by_first[a][c]\n              total_same_first += count_c * (total_a - count_c)   # because for each string in (a,c), it pairs with all the other strings in the same first letter group that are not (a,c) -> that is (total_a - count_c) strings. But note: this counts each pair twice? (because (i,j) and (j,i) are the same) and we are iterating over each string? Actually, we are iterating by distinct (a,c). \n\n      Alternatively, we can do: \n          total_pairs_same_first = 0\n          for a, group in by_first.items():\n              total_a = sum(group.values())\n              # The number of pairs in this group that have different second letters: \n              #   = total_a * (total_a - 1) // 2   [all pairs] \n              #      - sum( count*(count-1)//2 for count in group.values() )\n              # But note: we are going to use the entire group? and then subtract the pairs that are same second?\n              # However, the problem: we are going to count each pair that has same first and different second exactly once? But wait, the problem asks for pairs of indices. And we are counting each unordered pair once.\n\n          Similarly for same_second.\n\n      Then total = total_pairs_same_first + total_pairs_same_second\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can iterate over the groups.\n\n  However, the current code structure is:\n\n      s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n\n  We can do:\n\n      from collections import defaultdict\n      by_first = defaultdict(int)   # we don't need nested counter? we can do: for each string, we break it.\n      by_second = defaultdict(int)  # but wait, we need to count the pairs? Actually, we need the entire distribution per first letter and per second letter? and also per string? \n\n  Actually, we need two dictionaries:\n      group_by_first = defaultdict(dict)   # but we can do: group_by_first[a] = Counter of second letters for first letter a?\n      But note: we have the entire Counter s.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      group_by_first = defaultdict(list)   # but we don't need the list, we need counts per second letter per first letter.\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n          by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n          by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))   # but we don't need by_second in the same way? \n\n      Actually, we can compute:\n\n          total_same_first = 0\n          for a in by_first:   # by_first is a dict: key: first char, value: a dict (second char -> count)\n              total_in_group = 0\n              for count in by_first[a].values():\n                  total_in_group += count\n              # Now, the pairs that have same first and same second: for each second char c, we have C(count,2) pairs that are same second? but we don't want those. We want the pairs that are same first and different second: \n              #   = total_in_group*(total_in_group-1)//2 - sum( count*(count-1)//2 for count in by_first[a].values() )\n              same_second_pairs = 0\n              for count in by_first[a].values():\n                  same_second_pairs += count*(count-1)//2\n              total_pairs_in_group = total_in_group*(total_in_group-1)//2\n              total_same_first += total_pairs_in_group - same_second_pairs\n\n          Similarly for by_second? Actually, no: we have to do the same for by_second? But wait, the same pair might be counted in both? \n\n      However, note: a pair that has same first letter and different second letter is only in the first group. Similarly, a pair that has same second letter and different first letter is only in the second group. And there is no pair that is in both? because if a pair has same first and same second, then they are identical and we skip? Actually, we are not skipping identical pairs? The problem: the pair (i,j) with i<j and the two strings are identical? Then they have 0 positions different -> not counted. So we are safe.\n\n      But wait: the problem says \"differ in exactly one position\". So identical pairs are not counted. And pairs that are same in one position and different in the other: they are either in the first group (if the same is the first) or the second group (if the same is the second). And they cannot be in both? because if they are same in both, then they are identical. If they are same in first and same in second? then identical. If they are same in first and different in second -> only first group. Same in second and different in first -> only second group. If they are different in both? then not in either.\n\n      So we can do:\n\n          total = 0\n          # Build by_first and by_second from the Counter s.\n\n          by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n          by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n\n          for string, count in s.items():\n              a, b = string[0], string[1]\n              by_first[a][b] += count\n              by_second[b][a] += count   # note: in by_second, we are grouping by second letter, and then by first letter.\n\n          # Now, for by_first: for each first letter group, we compute the total pairs that have same first and different second.\n          for a, group in by_first.items():\n              total_in_group = sum(group.values())\n              same_second = 0\n              for count in group.values():\n                  same_second += count*(count-1)//2\n              total_pairs_in_group = total_in_group*(total_in_group-1)//2\n              total += total_pairs_in_group - same_second\n\n          for b, group in by_second.items():\n              total_in_group = sum(group.values())\n              same_first = 0   # same first? actually, in the by_second group, we are grouping by second letter. Then for a fixed second letter, we have a group. The pairs that have same second letter and different first letter: \n              for count in group.values():\n                  same_first += count*(count-1)//2\n              total_pairs_in_group = total_in_group*(total_in_group-1)//2\n              total += total_pairs_in_group - same_first\n\n      But wait: is this double counting? Consider a pair (s1, s2) that has same first letter and different second letter: it is counted in the first part. And a pair that has same second letter and different first letter: counted in the second part. And they are disjoint? Yes.\n\n      However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the inner loops are over the distinct groups. The total distinct first letters? The letters are from 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters. So the groups are at most 11? and the inner loops are over the distinct second letters in that group? which is at most 11. So it's O(11*11) per test case? which is acceptable.\n\n      But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, meaning the total number of strings is <= 10^5. But the test cases are independent? and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5. So we can do this.\n\n  However, the current code structure is:\n\n      t=int(input())\n      while(t!=0):\n          n=int(input())\n          s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n          cnt = 0\n          ... we are going to replace the inner loops.\n\n  We must not use the double for loop over distinct strings because that would be O(11^2 * 10^5) worst-case? Actually, the distinct strings might be up to 121 (11*11) per test case? and then 121*121 = 14641 per test case? and then 100 test cases? 100*14641 = 1.46e6, which is acceptable? But the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the distinct strings per test case might be up to 121? and then 100 test cases: 100*121 = 12100 distinct strings? and then the double loop would be 12100 * 12100? which is 146.41e6? which might be borderline in Pyton? But note: the total distinct strings over test cases is at most 10^5? because the total n is 10^5? and each test case has distinct strings? no, the distinct strings per test case: the total distinct strings over test cases is at most 10^5? because the total n is 10^5? and each string is at least one. So the distinct strings over all test cases is <= 10^5? but the test cases are independent? Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\". So the total number of strings is <= 10^5. Therefore, the distinct strings over all test cases is at most 10^5? but we are processing each test case independently. And the distinct strings per test case: the worst-case distinct strings per test case is 121? because there are only 11*11=121 distinct strings. So the worst-case for one test case: n=10^5, but distinct strings at most 121. So the double loop over distinct strings in one test case: 121*121 = 14641, which is acceptable.\n\n  However, the current code does:\n\n      for x in s:\n          for y in s:\n              if condition: then ... \n\n      and then does something? but the code is incomplete.\n\n  But the problem says: we must output the missing code. The missing code is the part that is missing in the for loop and the rest.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do the group method without the double loop.\n\n  But note: the original code has:\n\n      print(cnt//2)\n\n  Why //2? because the double loop counts each pair twice? (once for (x,y) and once for (y,x))? But the condition has x!=y, so each unordered pair is counted twice? So then we divide by 2.\n\n  However, the original code does:\n\n      if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])):\n          ... (missing code)\n\n  What should we add? \n\n  We want to count the pair (x,y) if they differ in exactly one position. But note: the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) includes:\n      - if they have the same first letter and same second letter? -> then they are identical? but we skip because x!=y? but if they are identical, then they are the same key? so we don't have two identical keys? because we are iterating over distinct keys. So if a string appears multiple times, we are not iterating over duplicates? because s is a Counter, and we are iterating over keys.\n\n  So the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) is true for:\n      - same first letter and same second letter: but then x==y -> skipped by x!=y.\n      - same first letter and different second letter: then we want to count? \n      - same second letter and different first letter: then we want to count?\n      - same first letter and same second letter: skipped.\n\n  But also, if they have both same first and same second? then they are the same key -> skipped.\n\n  However, what if they have both same first and same second? then they are the same key -> not in the loop? because x and y are distinct keys.\n\n  But what about: \n      x = \"ab\", y = \"ac\": \n          same first letter? yes -> condition true -> we count.\n      x = \"ab\", y = \"cb\":\n          same second letter? yes -> condition true -> we count.\n      x = \"ab\", y = \"cd\": \n          condition false -> skip.\n\n  So the condition is exactly: they share at least one common letter in the same position? and then we count? but we want exactly one position different? \n\n  However, if they share one common letter and the other letter is different, then they differ in exactly one position? yes.\n\n  But note: if they share both common letters? then they are the same string -> skipped.\n\n  So the condition is correct? \n\n  Then what should we add? \n\n      We want to add the product of the frequencies? because if string x appears freq_x times and string y appears freq_y times, then the number of pairs between these two distinct strings is freq_x * freq_y.\n\n  So:\n\n      if (x[0]==y[0] and x[1]!=y[1]) or (x[1]==y[1] and x[0]!=y[0]):\n          cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n  But note: the condition we have is: (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) and x!=y. This condition is true for both the cases we want: \n      Case 1: same first and different second -> then (x[0]==y[0] and x[1]!=y[1]) -> true.\n      Case 2: same second and different first -> then (x[1]==y[1] and x[0]!=y[0]) -> true.\n\n  But also, if they have both same first and same second? then they are the same key -> skipped by x!=y.\n\n  And if they have same first and same second? then they are the same key -> not distinct.\n\n  So the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) is equivalent to: they share at least one common letter in the same position? and then we count the entire product? \n\n  But wait: what if they have same first and same second? -> skipped. \n  What if they have same first and same second? -> they are the same key -> not in the loop? because we are iterating over distinct keys and x!=y.\n\n  So we can do:\n\n      cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n  Then at the end, we do cnt//2? because each pair (x,y) is counted twice? (once as (x,y) and once as (y,x))? \n\n  But note: the loop:\n\n      for x in s:\n          for y in s:\n              if condition: \n                  cnt += s[x]*s[y]\n\n  This counts (x,y) and (y,x) separately? and they are both valid? and the condition is symmetric? so we are counting each unordered pair twice? so we divide by 2.\n\n  However, what about the pairs that are within the same key? we don't have that because we are iterating over distinct keys and x!=y.\n\n  But what about multiple occurrences? For two distinct keys (x and y), the number of pairs is s[x] * s[y]. And we are adding that for both (x,y) and (y,x)? so we are adding 2 * (s[x]*s[y])? then we divide by 2 -> that gives s[x]*s[y] for each unordered pair of distinct keys? which is correct.\n\n  However, we must note: the condition (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) also includes pairs that have both same first and same second? but we skip because x!=y? and if they are the same key, we skip? so we are safe.\n\n  But wait: what if we have two different strings that have both same first and same second? -> that is impossible? because if they have same first and same second, then they are the same string? so they are the same key.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n      cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the condition is written as (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]). This condition is true for the two cases we want. But note: if a pair has both same first and same second? then they are the same key -> skipped. So it's safe.\n\n  But what if a pair has same first and same second? -> same key -> skipped.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n      from collections import Counter\n\n      t=int(input())\n      while t:\n          n = int(input())\n          s = Counter(input() for _ in range(n))\n          cnt = 0\n          for x in s:\n              for y in s:\n                  if x != y and (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]):\n                      cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n          print(cnt//2)\n          t -= 1\n\n  But note: the condition in the original code was (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) -> same as (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]).\n\n  However, the problem: the total distinct strings per test case is at most 121? and 121*121 = 14641, which is acceptable for 100 test cases? but the total n over test cases is 10^5, but the distinct strings per test case: the worst-case distinct strings per test case is 121? and the total test cases: the sum of n is 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 100? and the worst-case distinct strings per test case is 121? so the total distinct strings over test cases is at most 100*121 = 12100? and then the double loop would be 12100 * 12100 = 146.41e6? which is 146 million iterations? which might be borderline in Python? \n\n  But note: the total distinct strings over test cases is 12100? and we are doing a double loop per test case? so for each test case, we do (distinct_i)^2. The worst-case test case: one test case with n=10^5? but the distinct strings is 121? then 121^2 = 14641. Then 100 test cases: 100 * 14641 = 1.4641e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, we can do the double loop.\n\n  So the missing code for program1.py is: \n      cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n  But note: the original code has a comment: # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we replace the TODO with: \n      cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n  However, the original code has:\n\n      for x in s:\n          for y in s:\n              if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])): \n                  # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We must complete the line: we add an indented line: cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n  But note: the next line is: print(cnt//2)\n\n  So the code for program1.py is:\n\n      from collections import Counter\n\n      t=int(input())\n      while(t!=0):\n          n=int(input())\n          s = Counter(input() for x in [1]*n)\n          cnt = 0\n          for x in s:\n              for y in s:\n                  if(x!=y and (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0])):\n                      cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n          print(cnt//2)\n          t-=1\n\n  But wait: the condition in the if-statement: (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) -> this is the same as (x[0]==y[0] or x[1]==y[1]). \n\n  However, the example: \n      First test case: \n          strings: [\"ab\", \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\"]\n          s = Counter: \n              'ab':2, 'cb':1, 'db':1, 'aa':1, 'cc':1\n\n          We want to count: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"): same first? no (a vs c), same second? b==b -> condition true -> count 2*1 = 2.\n            (\"ab\", \"db\"): same second? b==b -> true -> 2*1=2.\n            (\"ab\", \"aa\"): same first? a==a -> true -> 2*1=2.\n            (\"ab\", \"cc\"): no same first? a!=c, same second? b!=c -> false -> skip.\n            (\"cb\", \"db\"): same second? b==b -> true -> 1*1=1.\n            (\"cb\", \"aa\"): no -> skip.\n            (\"cb\", \"cc\"): same second? b!=c -> false? but wait: condition is (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]): \n                x='cb', y='cc': \n                    x[1]=='b', y[1]=='c' -> not same.\n                    x[0]=='c', y[0]=='c' -> same -> true -> count 1*1=1.\n            (\"db\", \"aa\"): skip.\n            (\"db\", \"cc\"): same first? d and c -> no; same second? b and c -> no -> skip.\n            (\"aa\", \"cc\"): same first? a and c -> no; same second? a and c -> no -> skip.\n\n          Total cnt = 2+2+2+1+1 = 8 -> then print 8//2 = 4? but the expected is 5.\n\n          What are the pairs? \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"): one pair? but we have two 'ab' and one 'cb': so two pairs: (ab1, cb), (ab2, cb) -> 2.\n            (\"ab\", \"db\"): similarly 2.\n            (\"ab\", \"aa\"): 2.\n            (\"cb\", \"db\"): 1.\n            (\"cb\", \"cc\"): 1.\n\n          Total pairs: 2+2+2+1+1 = 8? but the problem says 5 pairs? \n\n          The problem says: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\n          So 5 pairs? but we counted 8? \n\n          Why? because the two 'ab' are considered distinct. The problem: the input has n strings, and we are to count pairs of indices (i<j). So if there are two \"ab\", then the two \"ab\" form a pair? but they are identical -> they don't differ in exactly one position? so we skip. \n\n          However, in our method, we are counting distinct keys and then multiplying frequencies. \n\n          The pair between the two \"ab\": we skip because we are iterating over distinct keys and x==y? we skip. So we don't count the pair within the same key? \n\n          But the pairs that involve two different keys: \n            For the key \"ab\" and \"cb\": we count 2*1 = 2 -> which corresponds to (ab1, cb) and (ab2, cb) -> two pairs.\n            Similarly, \"ab\" and \"db\": 2 pairs.\n            \"ab\" and \"aa\": 2 pairs.\n            \"cb\" and \"db\": 1 pair.\n            \"cb\" and \"cc\": 1 pair.\n\n          Total 8 pairs? but the problem says 5? \n\n          What's the issue? \n\n          The problem: the example input is:\n\n            ab\n            ab\n            cb\n            db\n            aa\n            cc\n\n          The pairs that differ in exactly one position:\n\n            (0,2): \"ab\" and \"cb\" -> differ in first: a vs c -> one difference -> valid.\n            (0,3): \"ab\" and \"db\" -> valid.\n            (0,4): \"ab\" and \"aa\" -> valid: first letter same? a vs a, second letter b vs a -> different -> one difference.\n            (1,2): \"ab\" and \"cb\" -> valid.\n            (1,3): \"ab\" and \"db\" -> valid.\n            (1,4): \"ab\" and \"aa\" -> valid.\n            (2,3): \"cb\" and \"db\" -> valid: same second? b, first letter c vs d -> one difference.\n            (2,5): \"cb\" and \"cc\" -> valid: same first? c, second letter b vs c -> one difference.\n            (3,4): \"db\" and \"aa\" -> two differences -> skip.\n            (3,5): \"db\" and \"cc\" -> two differences -> skip.\n            (4,5): \"aa\" and \"cc\" -> two differences -> skip.\n\n          So we have 8 valid pairs? but the problem says 5? \n\n          Wait, the problem says: \n            For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\n          But note: the problem lists the strings, not the indices. And there are two \"ab\". So the pair (\"ab\", \"cb\") appears twice? but the problem lists it once? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string\". So they are considering the indices. Therefore, the example has 6 strings: \n            s0: \"ab\"\n            s1: \"ab\"\n            s2: \"cb\"\n            s3: \"db\"\n            s4: \"aa\"\n            s5: \"cc\"\n\n          The pairs (i,j) with i<j:\n\n            (0,2): \"ab\" and \"cb\" -> valid.\n            (0,3): \"ab\" and \"db\" -> valid.\n            (0,4): \"ab\" and \"aa\" -> valid.\n            (1,2): \"ab\" and \"cb\" -> valid.\n            (1,3): \"ab\" and \"db\" -> valid.\n            (1,4): \"ab\" and \"aa\" -> valid.\n            (2,3): \"cb\" and \"db\" -> valid.\n            (2,5): \"cb\" and \"cc\" -> valid.\n            (3,4): \"db\" and \"aa\" -> invalid.\n            (3,5): \"db\" and \"cc\" -> invalid.\n            (4,5): \"aa\" and \"cc\" -> invalid.\n\n          So 8 pairs? but the problem says 5? \n\n          This is a discrepancy. \n\n          Let me check the problem statement again: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\"\n\n          They list 5 pairs. But we found 8.\n\n          However, note: the example input has two \"ab\". The problem lists:\n\n            (\"ab\", \"cb\") -> this corresponds to two pairs: (0,2) and (1,2)\n            (\"ab\", \"db\") -> two pairs: (0,3) and (1,3)\n            (\"ab\", \"aa\") -> two pairs: (0,4) and (1,4)\n            (\"cb\", \"db\") -> one pair: (2,3)\n            (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> one pair: (2,5)\n\n          So total 2+2+2+1+1 = 8.\n\n          Therefore, the problem note is listing the distinct string pairs, but the count is 8.\n\n          But the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string\", so they are counting by indices. \n\n          And the example output should be 8? \n\n          However, the problem says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\"\n\n          So they list 5 distinct string pairs? but the actual count is 8.\n\n          The problem note might be ignoring duplicates? but the problem says \"the i-th string and the j-th string\", so we must count by indices.\n\n          Therefore, our method is correct: 8.\n\n          But the problem example output for the first test case is 5? \n\n          Let me check the sample input in the problem: \n            Input: \n                3\n                6\n                ab\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                2\n                aa\n                cc\n                5\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n\n            Output:\n                5\n                6\n                0\n\n          The first test case output is 5, not 8.\n\n          What's going on?\n\n          I see: the problem says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\"\n\n          They list 5 distinct string pairs? but they are not counting the duplicates? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string\", so we must count by indices.\n\n          But note: the example input has two \"ab\", so the pair (0,1) is a pair of two \"ab\": they are identical -> not counted. \n\n          And the pairs that involve two different indices with the same string? \n\n          The problem: the pair (0,1) is not counted because they are identical. But the pairs (0,2) and (1,2) are both counted? \n\n          Why does the problem list only one (\"ab\", \"cb\")? \n\n          I think the problem note is listing the distinct string pairs that appear, but the count is 8.\n\n          But the sample output is 5? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me check the second test case:\n\n            Input: \n                2\n                aa\n                cc\n\n            The problem says: \n                the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                    (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n            But wait, the input is \"aa\" and \"cc\", so there are only two strings? \n\n            Then the only pair is (0,1): \"aa\" and \"cc\" -> they differ in two positions -> not counted.\n\n            So the output should be 0? but the problem says 6? \n\n          I see: the problem note for the second test case says: \n            \"the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\"\n\n          But the input only has \"aa\" and \"cc\", so where did \"ac\" and \"ca\" come from?\n\n          This suggests that the problem note is not matching the sample input.\n\n          After re-reading the problem: \n            \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\"\n\n          But the input for the second test case is: \n                2\n                aa\n                cc\n\n          And the output is 6? \n\n          This is impossible.\n\n          I see: the problem says: \n            \"In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed.\"\n\n          This note is for program2.py, not program1.py.\n\n          So the sample outputs for program1.py are:\n\n            First test case: 5\n            Second test case: 6\n            Third test case: 0\n\n          How can we get 5 for the first test case?\n\n          Let me recount the first test case by hand, but only for distinct string pairs? \n\n          We have the distinct strings: \n            \"ab\": appears 2 times\n            \"cb\": 1\n            \"db\": 1\n            \"aa\": 1\n            \"cc\": 1\n\n          The distinct string pairs that differ in exactly one position:\n\n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"): one difference -> valid.\n            (\"ab\", \"db\"): valid.\n            (\"ab\", \"aa\"): valid.\n            (\"cb\", \"db\"): valid.\n            (\"cb\", \"cc\"): valid.\n\n          That's 5 distinct string pairs.\n\n          But the count by indices is 8.\n\n          The problem says: \"count the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j\"\n\n          So it should be 8.\n\n          However, the sample output is 5.\n\n          This indicates that the sample provided in the problem note for program1.py might be using different inputs? \n\n          Let me read the problem again: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\"\n\n          And then the input is:\n\n                6\n                ab\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n\n          But the problem note says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\"\n\n          This lists 5 pairs, but these are distinct string pairs. \n\n          How to get 5? \n\n          If we count by distinct string pairs, then we would do:\n\n            for each distinct string pair (x,y) that are not the same and that differ in exactly one position, we count 1.\n\n          But that is not what the problem asks.\n\n          The problem asks for pairs of indices.\n\n          There is a possibility: the problem intended to say that the first test case has 5, but then the sample input has only 5 strings? \n\n          Let me try with the following input for the first test case:\n\n                5\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n\n          Then the distinct strings: \n            \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\"\n\n          Pairs of indices:\n\n            (0,1): \"ab\",\"cb\" -> valid.\n            (0,2): \"ab\",\"db\" -> valid.\n            (0,3): \"ab\",\"aa\" -> valid.\n            (0,4): \"ab\",\"cc\" -> invalid.\n            (1,2): \"cb\",\"db\" -> valid.\n            (1,3): \"cb\",\"aa\" -> invalid.\n            (1,4): \"cb\",\"cc\" -> valid.\n            (2,3): \"db\",\"aa\" -> invalid.\n            (2,4): \"db\",\"cc\" -> invalid.\n            (3,4): \"aa\",\"cc\" -> invalid.\n\n          Total 5.\n\n          So the sample input for the first test case has 5 strings, not 6.\n\n          The problem says: \n            \"The first line of each test case contains a single integer n \u2014 the number of strings.\"\n\n          For the first test case, n=6 in the provided input, but the problem note example only lists 5 distinct pairs? and if we remove one string, we get 5 pairs.\n\n          This is a mistake in the problem note? or in the input example?\n\n          The input example says:\n\n                6\n                ab\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n\n          So n=6.\n\n          But the problem note lists only 5 distinct string pairs, and if we count by indices we get 8.\n\n          The output in the sample is 5.\n\n          This is very confusing.\n\n          I see: the problem note says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\"\n\n          and then lists 5 pairs, but these are not by indices, they are by distinct strings. And then the sample output is 5, which is the count of distinct string pairs that are valid? \n\n          But the problem asks for indices.\n\n          There is a known issue: the problem's sample output for the first test case is 5, but our method yields 8.\n\n          How can we get 5? \n\n          If we do not multiply by the frequency, then for distinct string pairs we count 1 for each distinct pair that satisfies the condition. Then we would get 5. But then we would not have the //2? \n\n          But the problem: the sample second test case has n=2, and distinct strings: \"aa\", \"cc\", and distinct string pairs: none -> 0, but the sample output is 6? \n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          I think there is a misunderstanding.\n\n          After re-examining the sample outputs provided in the problem for program1.py:\n\n            Input:\n                3\n                6\n                ab\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                2\n                aa\n                cc\n                5\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n\n            Output:\n                5\n                6\n                0\n\n          How can the second test case (n=2) output 6? \n\n          This is impossible.\n\n          I see: the sample input for the second test case is not \"aa\" and \"cc\", but something else? \n\n          The problem says for the second test case: \n            \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\"\n\n          This suggests that the second test case has at least the strings: \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\". \n\n          So the input for the second test case is not 2, but 4? \n\n          The input says:\n\n                2\n                aa\n                cc\n\n          This is n=2.\n\n          So the sample input and the problem note are not matching.\n\n          Given the confusion, I will rely on the known solution for this problem.\n\n          Known solution for the same problem (from Codeforces):\n\n          We can do:\n\n            by_first = {}\n            by_second = {}\n            by_both = {}\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                s = input().strip()\n                a, b = s[0], s[1]\n                by_first[a] = by_first.get(a,0) + 1\n                by_second[b] = by_second.get(b,0) + 1\n                by_both[s] = by_both.get(s,0) + 1\n\n            ans = 0\n            for a in by_first:\n                count = by_first[a]\n                ans += count*(count-1)//2\n\n            for b in by_second:\n                count = by_second[b]\n                ans += count*(count-1)//2\n\n            for s in by_both:\n                count = by_both[s]\n                ans -= 2 * (count*(count-1)//2)\n\n            print(ans)\n\n          But wait, this counts:\n\n            - Pairs with the same first letter: C(count,2) for each first letter group.\n            - Pairs with the same second letter: C(count,2) for each second letter group.\n            - Then subtract twice the pairs that are the same string? \n\n          Why twice? \n\n          Explanation: \n            A pair that is the same string (i.e., identical) will be counted in the first group (if they have the same first letter) and in the second group (same second letter) -> so they are counted twice in the first two steps. But we don't want them at all. Also, we want to subtract the pairs that are identical? but the problem doesn't want them. However, the first two steps also count non-identical pairs that have the same first letter or same second letter.\n\n          But note: we want only the pairs that have exactly one position different. \n\n          However, the first two steps count:\n\n            - All pairs that have the same first letter (including those that have the same second letter and those that have different second letter) -> but we want only those with different second letter? \n            - Similarly for second letter.\n\n          This known solution does:\n\n            total = (sum_{first letter groups} C(count_a,2)) + (sum_{second letter groups} C(count_b,2)) - 2 * (sum_{string} C(freq(string),2))\n\n          Why subtract twice the identical pairs? \n\n          Let's break down:\n\n            In the first step (same first letter), for a particular string \"ab\", the pairs within the \"ab\" group: there are C(freq,2) pairs that are identical in both letters. These are not wanted because we want exactly one difference. But also, the first step counts these pairs? \n\n            Similarly, the second step counts these pairs again.\n\n          So we have counted each identical pair twice (once in first step and once in second step). But we want to remove them completely. However, the identical pairs are not the only ones we want to remove? \n\n          Actually, the first step counts ALL pairs that have the same first letter, including those that are identical in both letters and those that are not. But we want to remove the pairs that are identical in both letters? because they have 0 differences. \n\n          However, the known solution subtracts twice the number of identical pairs? \n\n          Let me test with the first test case: n=6, distinct string \"ab\" appears 2, others 1.\n\n          by_first: \n            'a': count = 2 (from \"ab\") + 1 ( from \"aa\") + 0? -> wait, \"aa\" has first letter 'a' -> so 'a': 2+1 = 3.\n            'c': \"cb\", \"cc\" -> 2.\n            'd': \"db\" -> 1.\n          by_second:\n            'b': \"ab\"x2, \"cb\", \"db\" -> 4.\n            'a': \"aa\" -> 1.\n            'c': \"cc\" -> 1.\n          by_both: \n            \"ab\":2, \"cb\":1, \"db\":1, \"aa\":1, \"cc\":1.\n\n          Step1: \n            for 'a': C(3,2)=3\n            for 'c': C(2,2)=1\n            for 'd': 0\n            total1 = 3+1 = 4.\n\n          Step2:\n            for 'b': C(4,2)=6\n            for 'a':0\n            for 'c':0\n            total2 = 6.\n\n          Step3: for each string in by_both: \n            \"ab\": C(2,2)=1 -> multiplied by 2 -> 2\n            others: 0.\n            so subtract 2.\n\n          total = 4+6-2 = 8.\n\n          But the sample output is 5.\n\n          This known solution gives 8.\n\n          Another known solution from Codeforces for the same problem (which is a common problem) is:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            int main() {\n                int t;\n                cin >> t;\n                while (t--) {\n                    int n;\n                    cin >> n;\n                    map<string, int> cnt;\n                    vector<string> a(n);\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        cin >> a[i];\n                        cnt[a[i]]++;\n                    }\n                    long long ans = 0;\n                    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                        for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) {\n                            string t = a[i];\n                            for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'k'; c++) {\n                                if (c == a[i][j]) continue;\n                                t[j] = c;\n                                if (cnt.find(t) != cnt.end()) {\n                                    ans += cnt[t];\n                                }\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                    cout << ans/2 << \"\\n\";\n                }\n            }\n\n          This solution: \n            For each string a[i], and for each position j in [0,1], we consider changing the j-th character to any other letter from 'a' to 'k' (except the current one), and if the new string t is in the map, we add the frequency of t.\n\n            Then we divide by 2.\n\n          Why divide by 2? because each pair (i, j) will be counted twice: once when we change the string at i to get string j, and once when we change the string at j to get string i.\n\n          Let me test with the first test case: \n            strings: [\"ab\", \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\"]\n\n          For the first string \"ab\" (appearing twice, but we iterate over each index, so we will see \"ab\" twice).\n\n          For the first occurrence of \"ab\":\n            position0: change 'a' to any other letter (from 'a' to 'k' excluding 'a') -> 10 letters.\n                change to 'c': yields \"cb\" -> present, count=1.\n                change to 'd': yields \"db\" -> present, count=1.\n                change to 'a': skip.\n                change to 'b'..'k' (except 'a'): only 'c' and 'd' yield hits.\n            position1: change 'b' to any other letter (11-1=10) yields:\n                change to 'a': yields \"aa\" -> present, count=1.\n                change to 'c': yields \"ac\" -> not present.\n                ... only 'a' yields hit.\n            total for this occurrence: 2 (from position0) + 1 (from position1) = 3.\n\n          For the second occurrence of \"ab\": similarly 3.\n\n          For \"cb\":\n            position0: change 'c' to 'a' -> \"ab\" -> present, count=2.\n                       change 'c' to 'd' -> \"db\" -> present, count=1.\n                       change to others: no.\n                       -> 3.\n            position1: change 'b' to 'a' -> \"ca\" -> not present.\n                       change 'b' to 'c' -> \"cc\" -> present, count=1.\n                       -> 1.\n            total for \"cb\": 4.\n\n          For \"db\":\n            position0: change 'd' to 'a' -> \"ab\" -> count=2.\n                       change 'd' to 'c' -> \"cb\" -> count=1.\n                       -> 3.\n            position1: change 'b' to 'a' -> \"da\" -> not present.\n                       change 'b' to 'c' -> \"dc\" -> not present.\n                       ->0.\n            total for \"db\": 3.\n\n          For \"aa\":\n            position0: change 'a' to 'c' -> \"ca\" -> not present.\n                       change to others: not present.\n                       ->0.\n            position1: change 'a' to 'b' -> \"ab\" -> count=2.\n                       ->2.\n\n          For \"cc\":\n            position0: change 'c' to 'a' -> \"ac\" -> not present.\n                       change 'c' to 'd' -> \"dc\" -> not present.\n                       ->0.\n            position1: change 'c' to 'a' -> \"ca\" -> not present.\n                       change 'c' to 'b' -> \"cb\" -> count=1.\n                       ->1.\n\n          Sum = 3+3+4+3+2+1 = 16.\n          Then divide by 2 -> 8.\n\n          So it's 8.\n\n          Therefore, the sample output for the first test case should be 8, not 5.\n\n          Given the sample input has n=6 and the output is 8, but the problem sample output is 5, and the second test case has output 6 for n=2, which is impossible, I think there is a mistake in the provided sample outputs.\n\n          However, the problem says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\"\n\n          which is 5, but then says the output is 5.\n\n          How to get 5? \n\n          If we do not consider the frequency, and only distinct string pairs, then we would have 5.\n\n          But the problem asks for indices.\n\n          There is a possibility: the problem intended to say that the first test case has n=5, not 6.\n\n          So the input for the first test case should be:\n\n                5\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n\n          Then the distinct string pairs are 5, and the index pairs are 5.\n\n          So the sample input in the problem is:\n\n                3\n                5\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                4   # because the second test case has 4 strings: aa, cc, ac, ca?

(0,2) and (2,0) -> but the problem requires i<j. So (\"ac\", \"aa\") would be (2,0) -> not allowed.\n\n          So only 4.\n\n          This is not 6.\n\n          How to get 6? \n\n          If the second test case has more than 4 strings? \n\n          The problem note lists the following distinct string pairs: \n            (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\"), (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n          This is 6 string pairs, but many are duplicates by index if the string appears once.\n\n          If the input has duplicates, then we can get more.\n\n          For example, if the input for the second test case is:\n\n                6\n                aa\n                aa\n                cc\n                cc\n                ac\n                ca\n\n          then we can have more pairs.\n\n          Specifically, the distinct strings are: \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\", but \"aa\" appears twice, \"cc\" appears twice.\n\n          Then the index pairs:\n\n            between the two \"aa\": not counted.\n            between the two \"cc\": not counted.\n            between \"aa\" and \"cc\": not counted (2 differences).\n            between \"aa\" and \"ac\": \n                first 'a' same, second 'a' and 'c' different -> valid.\n                there are 2 (from the two \"aa\") * 1 (one \"ac\") = 2.\n            between \"aa\" and \"ca\": valid, similarly 2.\n            between \"cc\" and \"ac\": valid, 2.\n            between \"cc\" and \"ca\": valid, 2.\n            between \"ac\" and \"ca\": not valid.\n\n          Total = 2+2+2+2 = 8.\n\n          then divide by 2 in the known solution? no, in our double distinct key loop we would do:\n\n            distinct strings: \n                \"aa\":2, \"cc\":2, \"ac\":1, \"ca\":1.\n\n            distinct string pairs that are valid and distinct keys:\n\n                (\"aa\", \"ac\"): valid -> 2*1 = 2.\n                (\"aa\", \"ca\"): valid -> 2*1 = 2.\n                (\"cc\", \"ac\"): valid -> 2*1 = 2.\n                (\"cc\", \"ca\"): valid -> 2*1 = 2.\n                (\"ac\", \"ca\"): not valid.\n\n            also, note: (\"aa\", \"cc\") -> not valid.\n\n            total = 2+2+2+2 = 8.\n\n            then we do not divide by 2 in the final answer? but in our double loop we would have:\n\n                for x in distinct keys: for y in distinct keys: if x!= and condition -> add s[x]*s[y]\n\n            then we would get 8, and then we divide by 2 -> 4.\n\n          This is not 6.\n\n          I am not sure how to get 6.\n\n          Given the time, and since the problem is from Codeforces and known, I recall that the intended solution for the first test case is 8, and the sample output in the problem statement is likely a mistake.\n\n          But the problem says the sample output for the first test case is 5.\n\n          How to get 5 for the first test case with n=6? \n\n          One possibility: the problem is not counting the pairs within the same string twice? \n\n          In our double loop over distinct strings, we are for x and y distinct keys, and we are counting s[x]*s[y] for each ordered distinct pair (x,y) that satisfies the condition, then we divide by 2 to get the unordered distinct string pairs scaled by the product of frequencies.\n\n          But note: the condition might be applied in a way that if the two strings are the same, we skip, and for distinct keys, we are safe.\n\n          For the first test case, we got 8.\n\n          The only way to get 5 is to only count each distinct string pair once, regardless of frequency.\n\n          then for the first test case, we would do:\n\n            for x in s:\n                for y in s:\n                    if x< and condition: \n                        cnt += 1\n\n          then we would get 5.\n\n          but then the second test case with n=2 would be 0, not 6.\n\n          So that doesn't work.\n\n          Given the provided sample output for the first test case is 5, and our method yields 8, and the known solution yields 8, I think the sample output in the problem is for a different input.\n\n          Since the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and the sample input has t=3, and the sum of n is 6+2+5=13, which is within 10^5, and our double distinct key loop is O(121^2) per test case, which is safe, and it yields 8 for the first test case, and the problem sample output is 5, we must output the code that passes the sample as provided in the problem.\n\n          But the sample input in the problem is:\n\n                3\n                6\n                ab\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                2\n                aa\n                cc\n                5\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n\n          and the expected output is:\n\n                5\n                6\n                0\n\n          How to get 5 for the first test case? \n\n          I see: the condition in the if-statement: (x[1]==y[1] or x[0]==y[0]) \n          is true for the 5 distinct string pairs we listed, and then we do:\n\n              cnt += 1   ( not s[x]*s[y] )\n\n          then for the first test case, we would get 5 (because there are 5 distinct string pairs that satisfy the condition) and then we divide by 2? -> 5//2 = 2.5 -> not integer.\n\n          So not.\n\n          unless we do not divide by 2.\n\n          then for the first test case: 5.\n          for the second test case: distinct string pair: (\"aa\", \"cc\") -> condition: \n             (x[0]==y[0] -> 'a' and 'c' -> false; x[1]==y[1] -> 'a' and 'c' -> false) -> condition false -> 0.\n          for the third test case: 0.\n\n          then output: 5, 0, 0.\n\n          not 5,6,0.\n\n          How to get 6 for the second test case? \n\n          If we do:\n\n              cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n          for the second test case: \n             distinct strings: \"aa\" and \"cc\", and they are not satisfying the condition -> cnt=0.\n             then 0//2 =0.\n\n          not 6.\n\n          I am out of ideas.\n\n          Given the time, and since the problem is to output the missing code, and the missing code in program1.py is for the TODO, and the only thing we can do is to put:\n\n              cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n          and then divide by 2, and hope that the judge's test cases are correct (which they are, because the known solution passed in Codeforces), I will output that.\n\n          So for program1.py, the missing code is: \n              cnt += s[x] * s[y]\n\n          For program2.py, we have:\n\n          Description: \n            We are to find the minimum number of lines needed to create at least n equilateral triangles.\n\n          The code has:\n\n            import sys\n            ctr = [0, 0, 0]\n            cnt = [0]\n\n            while cnt[-1] < 10**9:\n                i = ctr.index(min(ctr))\n                cnt.append(cnt[-1] + 2*(sum(ctr) - ctr[i]))\n                ctr[i] += 1\n\n            def solve(sn):\n                t = int(sn)\n                s, e = 0, len(cnt) - 1\n                while s < e:\n                    m = (s + e) >> 1\n                    if cnt[m] >= t:\n                        e = m\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                return str(s)\n\n            inp = sys.stdin.read().split()\n            inp.pop(0)\n\n            print('\\n'.join(map(solve, inp)))\n\n          In the TODO in the function solve, in the binary search, we have:\n\n                while s < e:\n                    m = (s+e)//2\n                    if cnt[m] >= t:\n                        e = m\n                    else:\n                        s = m+1   # because we are looking for the first index such that cnt[index]>=t.\n\n          In binary search for the lower bound, we do:\n\n                if cnt[m] >= t:\n                    e = m\n                else:\n                    s = m+1\n\n          Then at the end, s is the first index such that cnt[s] >= t.\n\n          And we return str(s).\n\n          But note: the array cnt is 1-indexed? or 0-indexed? \n\n          The initial: \n              cnt = [0]\n          then we append to cnt.\n\n          So cnt[0] = 0.\n          cnt[1] = 0 + 2*(sum(ctr initially [0,0,0]) - ctr[i] (0)) = 0.\n          then we do ctr[i] += 1 -> ctr becomes [1,0,0]\n\n          next: \n             i = index of min(ctr) -> min is 0, so i=1 or i=2? whichever is first? \n             then cnt.append(0 + 2*( (1+0+0) - 0 ) = 2*1 = 2.\n          then ctr[1] becomes 1.\n\n          next: \n             ctr = [1,1,0], then i=2.\n             cnt.append(2 + 2*( (1+1+0) - 0 ) = 2 + 2*2 = 6.\n          then ctr[2] becomes 1.\n\n          next: \n             ctr = [1,1,1], then i=0 (because min is 1, and index0 is the first with 1)\n             cnt.append(6 + 2*( (1+1+1) - 1 ) = 6 + 2*(2) = 10.\n\n          So the array cnt might be:\n              index0: 0\n              index1: 0\n              index2: 2\n              index3: 6\n              index4: 10\n              ...\n\n          But the number of lines is the index? \n\n          The problem: we are to return the minimum number of lines.\n\n          In the example: \n             In the first and second test cases only 2 lines are needed.\n\n          For n=1 or n=2, we need 2 lines.\n\n          In our cnt array:\n             cnt[0]=0, cnt[1]=0, cnt[2]=2, cnt[3]=6, ...\n\n          For n=1: we need the smallest index such that cnt[index]>=1 -> index=2.\n\n          For n=2: index=2.\n\n          For n=3: we need index=3 because cnt[2]=2<3, cnt[3]=6>=3.\n\n          But the example says: after 2 lines, we have 2 triangles. So for n=1 or n=2, we need 2 lines.\n\n          So the number of lines is the index? \n\n          In the code, we are building an array cnt, and the index in the array is the number of lines? \n\n          How is the number of lines related to the index in the array cnt? \n\n          In the initialization: \n             cnt = [0]   -> this corresponds to 0 lines.\n          then we are appending the number of triangles for the next number of lines.\n\n          The variable 'ctr' is [0,0,0] initially, and then we are incrementing one of the three directions.\n\n          The number of lines added is the length of cnt - 1? \n\n          Because we start with 0 lines: cnt[0]=0.\n          then after the first line: we append cnt[1] = ... -> but the while loop appends one element per iteration, and the number of iterations is the number of lines we are simulating.\n\n          In the binary search, we are searching in the array cnt for the first index such that cnt[index]>=n.\n\n          But the index in the array cnt is the number of lines? \n\n          For example, for 0 lines: index0.\n          for 1 line: index1.\n          for 2 lines: index2.\n\n          So the number of lines is the index.\n\n          Therefore, in the binary search, we want to find the smallest index (>=0) such that cnt[index]>=n.\n\n          The binary search is:\n\n             s, e = 0, len(cnt)-1\n             while s < e:\n                 m = (s+e)//2\n                 if cnt[m] >= n:\n                     e = m\n                 else:\n                     s = m+1\n\n          Then we return s.\n\n          But note: the array cnt is non-decreasing.\n\n          However, the TODO is in the else branch.\n\n          So the missing code is: s = m+1\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is: s = m+1\n\n          Let me test with the sample: \n             n=1: \n                 s=0, e= (say the array has at least index0,1,2,3,...)\n                 initially: s=0, e= let's say the last index is L (>=2)\n                 m = (0+L)//2, if cnt[m] < 1, then s = m+1.\n                 then eventually s becomes 2.\n\n          n=2: similarly s becomes 2.\n\n          n=3: \n             cnt[2]=2<3 -> then s becomes m+1, then next iteration: s=3, e=3 -> return 3.\n\n          n=0: then we return 0.\n\n          But the sample output for the second test case is 2 for n= something that is<=2, and 3 for n= something>=3 and <=6.\n\n          The sample input for the second test case is n=2, then output is 2.\n\n          The third test case: n=3, output is 3.\n\n          But the problem says for the third test case, the minimum needed is 3 lines.\n\n          However, the sample output in the problem for program1.py's test cases is:\n\n                5\n                6\n                0\n\n          and for program2.py, the sample input is:\n\n                t=?\n                then n values: probably the first test case n=2, then n= something else.\n\n          Given the provided code for program2.py, the missing line is: s = m+1\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            program1: \"cnt += s[x] * s[y]\"\n            program2: \"s = m+1\"\n\n          In JSON format.\n\n          Note: the sample input for program1.py might be intended to be with n=5, then our code would output 5, and for the second test case with n=4 (distinct strings) we would output 8, but the problem sample output for the second test case is 6, which we cannot achieve.\n\n          But the problem says the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, and our code is the known solution, so we output it.\n\n          If the judge's test cases are the same as the sample input in the problem, then program1.py will output 8 for the first test case, but the expected is 5, so it will fail.\n\n          However, the known solution passed in Codeforces for the problem \"Count the Number of Pairs\" (or similar), so I think the sample input in the problem statement is not the same as the sample input in the Codeforces problem.\n\n          Given the instructions, we output the missing code as described.\n\n          Final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"cnt += s[x] * s[y]\",\n                \"program2\": \"s = m+1\"\n            }"
