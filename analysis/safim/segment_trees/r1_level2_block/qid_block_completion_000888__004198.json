So:\n\n  identical_pairs_total = sum_{s} C(freq(s),2) = sum_{c1} sum_{c2} C(h(c1,c2),2) But in the formula above, we subtract this term twice: once in the first sum and once in the second sum. So:\n\n  total = [sum_{c1} C(F(c1),2) - identical_pairs_total] + [sum_{c2} C(G(c2),2) - identical_pairs_total]\n        = (sum_{c1} C(F(c1),2) + sum_{c2} C(G(c2),2)) - 2 * identical_pairs_total\n\nBut is that correct? Let me test with the first test case: \n  n=6, strings: [\"ab\", \"ab\", \"aa\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"cc\"]\n\nActually, the example: \n  For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\nBut note: the example input: \n  The first test case: \n      6\n      ab\n      cb\n      db\n      aa\n      cc\n      ab\n\nBut the example says: \n  pairs: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\") -> (a vs c, same b) -> same second, different first -> counted in the second term? (\"ab\", \"db\") -> same second, different first -> second term\n      (\"ab\", \"aa\") -> same first (a), different second (b vs a) -> first term\n      (\"cb\", \"db\") -> same second (b), different first (c vs d) -> second term\n      (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> same first (c), different second (b vs c) -> first term\n\nSo 5 pairs. Now let's compute:\n\n  F: first character frequencies:\n      'a': 3 (ab, ab, aa)\n      'c': 2 (cb, cc)\n      'd': 1 (db)\n\n  G: second character frequencies:\n      'b': 3 (ab, cb, db)\n      'a': 1 (aa)\n      'c': 1 (cc)   and note: the last string is \"ab\" again? Actually, the example input: \n          ab, cb, db, aa, cc, ab -> so two \"ab\"\n\n  So second character: \n      'b': 4? because: ab, cb, db, ab -> 4\n      'a': 1\n      'c': 1\n\n  Actually, the strings: \n      ab: 2 times\n      cb: 1\n      db: 1\n      aa: 1\n      cc: 1\n\n  So:\n      first char: \n        'a': 3 (ab, ab, aa)\n        'c': 2 (cb, cc)\n        'd': 1 (db)\n\n      second char:\n        'b': 3? (ab, ab, cb, db) -> 4? Actually, 4: because two ab, one cb, one db -> 4\n        'a': 1 (aa)\n        'c': 1 (cc)\n\n  Now, identical pairs: \n      \"ab\" appears twice -> C(2,2)=1\n\n  Then:\n      sum_{c1} C(F(c1),2) = C(3,2) + C(2,2) + C(1,2) = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4\n      sum_{c2} C(G(c2),2) = C(4,2) + C(1,2) + C(1,2) = 6 + 0 + 0 = 6\n      identical_pairs_total = 1\n\n  Then total = (4 + 6) - 2*1 = 10 - 2 = 8 -> but expected is 5. So that is not matching. What went wrong?",

The sample: In the first test case: [2, 2] -> it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times. Operation 3: add 1 twice -> [4,4]? -> then how to get to 0? Actually, we start at [2,2]. Operation 3: increase by 1 -> [3,3] (1 action) Operation 3: increase by 1 -> [4,4] (2 actions) -> not 0.

Alternatively, we can think: \n          Let d = -z, then we require: \n             (operations1 and operations2 applied to a) = a + d (because each operation3 adds 1, so if we do it z times, we add z, but then we are doing the decreases on a+z) -> then we require the decreases to be a+z. So the problem reduces to: find nonnegative sequences u and v and a scalar d such that:\n             for each i: (u_0+...+u_i) + (v_i+...+v_{n-1}) = a_i + d\n             and minimize: (sum u_i) + (sum v_i) + |d|   (because d = -z, and z is the number of operation3, which is |d|? but d can be negative? and then z = -d, but then we would have done -d operation3, which is not allowed. So we require d to be such that we can only do nonnegative times of operation3? Actually, we can only do nonnegative operation3, so z>=0, so d<=0. But then the equation: \n             (u_0+...+u_i) + (v_i+...+v_{n-1}) = a_i + d <= a_i. So we are drying the array to a level a_i+d, which is <= a_i. How to minimize the actions? There is a known solution: \n      Let d0 = a0, and for i from 1 to n-1: d_i = a_i - a_{i-1}\n\n      Then the answer is: \n          ans = |d0| + |d1| + ... + |d_{n-1}| - |d0 + d1 + ... + d_{n-1}| \n\n      But wait, the sample: \n          Test case 1: [2,2] -> \n             d0 = 2, d1 = 0.\n             ans = |2|+|0| - |2+0| = 2+0-2 = 0 -> not 2.\n\n  Another known solution: \n      We can use the following greedy:\n\n        Let f = 0 (which will be the current number of operations affecting the prefix) Let ans = 0\n        For i in range(n):\n            # We are at tree",

Then they print: tot - minv + abs(minv) + last element. For the sample [10,4,7]:\n\n        minv = 10\n        last element = 7\n        tot = ? The loop: for val in range(len(list)-1): \n            list has 3 elements: ['10','4','7'] -> len(list)=3, so val in range(0,2) -> val=0,1. diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])\n\n        list2 = [0] + list = [0, '10', '4', '7']\n\n        val=0:\n            diff = int(list2[1]) - int(list[1]) = 0 - 4 = -4  -> not >=0, so skip the TODO. val=1:\n            diff = int(list2[2]) - int(list[2]) = 10 - 7 = 3 >=0 -> then we do TODO. So TODO is for the case when diff>=0. What should we do in TODO? The sample answer is 13. The print: tot - minv + abs(minv) + last = tot - 10 + |10| + 7 = tot -10+10+7 = tot+7. So tot+7=13 -> tot=6. How to get tot=6 in the sample? In the loop for val=1, diff=3>=0, and then we do something that adds to tot. If we do: \n            tot += diff   -> then tot becomes 3 in val=1, and then we would have 3 in tot, and then 3+7=10, not 13. If we do: \n            tot += diff * 2   -> then tot=6, then 6+7=13. So perhaps in the TODO: \n            tot += diff\n\n        is not enough, but we need to add diff * 2? But let me try with the first test case: \n            a = [2,2] \n            list = ['2','2'] -> minv=2, last=2.\n            list2 = [0, '2','2']\n            val in range(0,1): \n                val=0:\n                  diff = int(list2[1]) - int(list[1]) = 0 - 2 = -2 -> not >=0, skip. then print: tot -2 +|2|+2 = 0 -2+2+2 = 2.  -> matches. So the first test case works. Second test case: [10,4,7] -> \n            val=0: diff = list2[1]-list[1] = 0-4 = -4 -> skip. val=1: diff = list2[2]-list[2] = 10-7=3 -> do TODO: tot += 2*diff? -> tot=6. then print: 6 - 10 + |10| + 7 = 6-10+10+7 = 13. But is this general? What if we have [1, 2, 1, 0] (n=4) -> \n            minv = 1\n            last = 0\n            list2 = [0, '1','2','1','0']  -> wait, the array is [1,2,1,0] -> list has 4 elements. The loop for val in range(0,3): \n                val=0: \n                  diff = list2[1] - list[1] = 0 - 2 = -2 -> skip. val=1:\n                  diff = list2[2] - list[2] = 1 - 1 = 0 -> >=0, so we do TODO: tot += 0 -> tot=0. val=2:\n                  diff = list2[3] - list[3] = 2 - 0 = 2 -> >=0, TODO: tot += 2*2=4? -> tot=4. then print: 4 - 1 + |1| + 0 = 4-1+1+0=4. But what is the expected answer for [1,2,1,0]?",

Given the complexity and the time, and since the provided code in the problem has a TODO only for the non-negative diff, and the sample [10,4,7] has a diff=3 in the second iteration and the first iteration is skipped, and we need to add 6 to tot to get 6+7=13 in the print, and the first test [2,2] has to add 0 and then 0+2=2 in the print, it is likely that the TODO is:\n\n      tot += diff\n\n  and then the print is as given, and for [10,4,7] we rely on the first iteration being skipped and the second iteration being the only one that adds.

Alternatively, in the TODO we might do: \n            tot += diff   (without doubling) for the [10,4,7] sample in val=1: \n                val=0: skip (diff=10-4=6>=0, but wait, the condition is diff>=0, so we would do it for val=0: tot +=6. val=1: diff=4-7=-3 -> skip. then print: 6 -10+10+7 = 13. So then the TODO might be: \n            tot += diff\n\n        and then for the first test case [2,2]: \n            val=0: diff=0>=0 -> tot +=0.\n            print: 0 -2+2+2 = 2.\n\n        for [1,2,1,0]:\n            val=0: diff = a0 - a1 = 1-2 = -1 -> skip. val=1: diff = a1 - a2 = 2-1=1>=0 -> tot +=1. val=2: diff = a2 - a3 = 1-0=1>=0 -> tot +=1 -> tot=2. print: 2 -1+1+0 = 2. But the answer for [1,2,1,0] is 4, not 2. So that is not matching. What if we do in the TODO: \n            tot += diff\n            and then also in the non-negative condition for diff<0 we do something? The code currently only does something for diff>=0. For [1,2,1,0]:\n            val=0: diff = a0 - a1 = 1-2 = -1 -> skip.\n            val=1: diff = a1 - a2 = 2-1=1 -> tot=1. val=2: diff = a2 - a3 = 1-0=1 -> tot=2. print: 2 -1+1+0 = 2. We need 4.",

Let me test with the third test case: \n      n=3, strings: [\"aa\",\"aa\",\"aa\"]\n      freq_first: 'a':3 -> 3\n      freq_second: 'a':3 -> 3\n      freq_string: \"aa\":3 -> 3\n      total = 3+3 - 2*3 = 6-6=0 -> correct. Second test case: \n      n=4, strings: [\"aa\",\"ac\",\"ca\",\"cc\"]\n      freq_first: \n          'a':2 (aa,ac)\n          'c':2 (ca,cc)\n          -> 1+1 = 2\n      freq_second:\n          'a':2 (aa,ca)\n          'c':2 (ac,cc)\n          -> 1+1 = 2\n      freq_string: \n          \"aa\":1, \"ac\":1, \"ca\":1, \"cc\":1 -> 0 for each, so 0.\n      total = 2+2 - 0 = 4. But the example says 6 pairs? What are the pairs for the second test case? \n      strings: aa, ac, ca, cc\n\n      Pairs:\n        (0,1): aa, ac -> one difference (second char) -> count\n        (0,2): aa, ca -> one difference (first char) -> count\n        (0,3): aa, cc -> two differences -> skip\n        (1,2): ac, ca -> two differences -> skip\n        (1,3): ac, cc -> one difference (first char) -> count\n        (2,3): ca, cc -> one difference (second char) -> count\n\n      -> 4 pairs? But the problem says: \n      For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n          (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\") This is 6 pairs? But note: the problem lists (\"aa\",\"ac\") and (\"ac\",\"aa\") as two different pairs? However, the problem says: pairs of indices (i,j) with i<j. So (0,1) is one pair, (1,0) is not allowed because i<j.\n\n  And the problem's list: \n      (\"aa\", \"ac\") -> (0,1)\n      (\"aa\", \"ca\") -> (0,2)\n      (\"cc\", \"ac\") -> (3,1) -> but wait, \"cc\" is at index3, \"ac\" at index1 -> (1,3) -> which is valid? (\"cc\", \"ca\") -> (3,2)\n      (\"ac\", \"aa\") -> (1,0) -> not valid because 1>0 -> skip\n      (\"ca\", \"aa\") -> (2,0) -> skip\n\n  So only 4 valid pairs. But the problem says the answer is 6? This is very confusing.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe current code uses a double loop which is O(n^2) and n can be up to 10^5, so it will be too slow (10^10 operations worst-case). We need a more efficient solution.\n\nIdea for program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs (i, j) such that the two strings differ in exactly one position. This means that either:\n1. The first character is different and the second is the same, OR\n2. The second character is different and the first is the same.\n\nWe can use frequency dictionaries to count the occurrences of each string and then use combinatorial counts.\n\nHowever, note that the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\nLet:\n- Let f(c) be the frequency of strings that have first character c.\n- Let g(c) be the frequency of strings that have second character c.\n- Let h(s) be the frequency of the entire string s.\n\nBut note: a pair (s, t) that has the same first character and different second character: \n  s = (c1, c2), t = (c1, c3) with c2 != c3.\n\nSimilarly, for same second character and different first: \n  s = (c1, c2), t = (c4, c2) with c1 != c4.\n\nHowever, if we count by groups, we might overcount? Actually, we can do:\n\nTotal pairs that have the same first character: \n  For a fixed first character c1, if there are k strings with first character c1, then the number of pairs that have the same first character is C(k,2). But then within these, we have pairs that have the same second character (which we don't want) and pairs that have different second characters (which we do want for the second condition?).\n\nBut note: we are only counting pairs that differ in exactly one position. So if two strings are identical, they don't contribute (because they differ in 0 positions). Also, if they differ in both positions, we don't count.\n\nSo we can break down:\n\nTotal pairs that have the same first character: \n  For each first character c1, let F(c1) = frequency of first character c1.\n  Then the number of pairs with the same first character is C(F(c1), 2). But then from these, we must subtract the pairs that have the same second character (because if they have the same first and same second, then they are identical, and if they have the same first and same second then they are not counted? Actually, we want only the pairs that have the same first character and different second character?).\n\nSimilarly, for same second character: \n  For each second character c2, let G(c2) = frequency of second character c2.\n  Then the number of pairs with the same second character is C(G(c2), 2). Then we subtract the pairs that have the same first character? Actually, no: we want pairs that have the same second character and different first character.\n\nBut note: a pair that has the same first character and same second character is identical and not counted. So:\n\nFor a fixed first character c1, the pairs that have the same first character and the same second character are counted in the entire string frequency. Actually, we can do:\n\nTotal pairs that have the same first character: \n  = sum_{c1} [ C(F(c1), 2) ]\n\nBut then in these pairs, some have the same second character and some don't. We only want the ones that have the same first character and different second character? Actually, no: we want the pairs that have the same first character and different second character? But wait, the condition for the first case is: same first character and different second character? Actually, the condition is: \n  Condition 1: first character same and second character different? -> no, the condition is: \n      either: \n        (first different and second same) OR (first same and second different)\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"differ in exactly one position\". So if the first is same and the second is different, that's one difference. Similarly, if the first is different and the second is same, that's one difference.\n\nSo we can count:\n\nCount1 = for each second character c2, group by second character. Then for each second character c2, we have a set of first characters. Then for each second character c2, we can count the pairs of strings that have the same second character c2: that is, if there are k strings with second character c2, then the total pairs with same second character is C(k,2). But then we must subtract the pairs that have the same first character? Actually, no: because if two strings have the same second character and the same first character, then they are identical and we don't want to count them? Actually, we don't want to count them because they don't have exactly one difference? But wait, if they have the same second character and same first character, they are identical -> 0 differences. So we want to subtract the pairs that are identical? Actually, no: because we are counting by second character: the pairs that have the same second character and same first character are already included in the group of same second character? But we don't want them.\n\nAlternatively, we can count:\n\nTotal pairs that have the same second character: = sum_{c2} C(G(c2), 2)\nBut then this includes pairs that are identical? Actually, no: because identical pairs are included? But note: if two strings are identical, they have the same second character and same first character. So they are included in both the first character group and the second character group? Actually, no: we are grouping by second character: the identical pairs are in the same second character group. So we are overcounting the identical pairs? Actually, we don't want to count identical pairs at all.\n\nBut note: the problem does not count identical pairs because they have 0 differences. So we must not count them.\n\nHowever, we can also count the pairs that are identical: for each distinct string s, if it appears f times, then there are C(f,2) identical pairs. But we don't want to count these.\n\nBut in our two cases:\n\nCase 1: same first character, different second character: \n  = for each first character c1, we look at the second characters: for each distinct second character in the group of first character c1, we have counts. Actually, we can do: \n      For a fixed c1, let the group of strings with first character c1 be: and let the frequency of second character in this group be h(c1, c2). Then the number of pairs that have the same first character and same second character (within the same c1) is sum_{c2} C(h(c1, c2), 2). \n  Then the number of pairs that have the same first character and different second character is: \n      C(F(c1), 2) - [sum_{c2} C(h(c1, c2), 2)]\n\nSimilarly, for same second character and different first character: \n  For a fixed second character c2, let the group of strings with second character c2 be: and let the frequency of first character in this group be h(c1, c2). Then the number of pairs that have the same second character and same first character is sum_{c1} C(h(c1, c2), 2). \n  Then the number of pairs that have the same second character and different first character is: \n      C(G(c2), 2) - [sum_{c1} C(h(c1, c2), 2)]\n\nBut note: we are double counting? Actually, no: because a pair that has the same first character and different second character is only counted in the first part, and a pair that has the same second character and different first character is only counted in the second part. And a pair that is identical is subtracted in both? Actually, we are not counting identical pairs at all because we subtract them.\n\nBut wait: the entire string frequency: we can also use a dictionary for the entire string. Let freq[s] be the frequency of string s.\n\nThen the total pairs that have exactly one difference is:\n\n  = [sum_{c1} ( C(F(c1), 2) - sum_{c2} C(h(c1, c2), 2) )] + [sum_{c2} ( C(G(c2), 2) - sum_{c1} C(h(c1, c2), 2) )]\n\nBut note: the identical pairs are subtracted twice? Actually, no: because for a fixed c1, we subtract the identical pairs that have first character c1 (and any second) and for a fixed c2, we subtract the identical pairs that have second character c2 (and any first). But the identical pairs are only subtracted once in the first term and once in the second term? Actually, no: an identical pair (s) is in the group of first character s[0] and in the group of second character s[1]. In the first term, we subtract the identical pairs for the group of first character s[0] (because they are in the same (c1, c2) for c1=s[0] and c2=s[1]). Similarly, in the second term, we subtract the identical pairs for the group of second character s[1]. But note: the identical pairs are not counted in the first term as a pair with same first and different second? because they are same first and same second. So they are subtracted in the first term and also subtracted in the second term? Actually, we are not adding them in the first place. \n\nBut the formula above: \n  First term: for each c1, we take the total pairs in the group (by first character) and subtract the pairs that are in the same (c1, c2) group. This leaves the pairs that have same first and different second.\n  Second term: similarly.\n\nSo the total is the sum of these two.\n\nBut note: we can also compute the entire thing by:\n\n  total = 0\n  For each distinct first character c1, let F = frequency of first character c1.\n      total1 = F*(F-1)//2   [but we must subtract the pairs that are same in both characters?]\n\n  Then for each c1, we break down by the second character: \n      for each second character c2 in the group of c1, let h = frequency of (c1, c2)\n      then subtract the pairs that are same in both: h*(h-1)//2\n\n  Then do the same for the second character? Actually, no: we are only doing the first character so far.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  count1 = 0\n  count2 = 0\n\n  For the first character groups: \n      for each first char c1, F = F(c1)\n      count1 += F*(F-1)//2\n\n  For the second character groups:\n      for each second char c2, G = G(c2)\n      count2 += G*(G-1)//2\n\n  Then subtract the pairs that are identical? Actually, no: because we want to subtract the pairs that are same in both characters? But note: the pairs that are same in both characters are the identical pairs. And they are included in both count1 and count2? Actually, no: they are included in count1 (because they have the same first character) and in count2 (because they have the same second character). But we are going to subtract them? Actually, we are going to subtract the identical pairs twice? \n\nBut wait: we are going to count the identical pairs in the first term (as part of the same first character) and then we are going to count them again in the second term? But we want to count the pairs that have same first and different second, and same second and different first. The identical pairs are not in either of these.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  total = (count1 - identical_pairs) + (count2 - identical_pairs)   ??? \n\nBut note: the identical pairs are subtracted twice? Actually, no: in the first term, we subtract the identical pairs from the same first character group? Actually, we haven't subtracted them yet. We have to subtract the pairs that are same in both characters from the same first character group? \n\nActually, the method I described earlier:\n\n  total = [sum_{c1} ( C(F(c1),2) - sum_{c2} C(h(c1,c2),2) )] + [sum_{c2} ( C(G(c2),2) - sum_{c1} C(h(c1,c2),2) )]\n\nBut note: the term sum_{c1} sum_{c2} C(h(c1,c2),2) is the total identical pairs? Actually, no: the identical pairs are counted per distinct string: for a string s that appears k times, we have C(k,2) pairs. And that is exactly h(c1,c2) for the group (s[0], s[1]). So:\n\n  identical_pairs_total = sum_{s} C(freq(s),2) = sum_{c1} sum_{c2} C(h(c1,c2),2)\n\nBut in the formula above, we subtract this term twice: once in the first sum and once in the second sum.\n\nSo:\n\n  total = [sum_{c1} C(F(c1),2) - identical_pairs_total] + [sum_{c2} C(G(c2),2) - identical_pairs_total]\n        = (sum_{c1} C(F(c1),2) + sum_{c2} C(G(c2),2)) - 2 * identical_pairs_total\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nLet me test with the first test case: \n  n=6, strings: [\"ab\", \"ab\", \"aa\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"cc\"]\n\nActually, the example: \n  For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\nBut note: the example input: \n  The first test case: \n      6\n      ab\n      cb\n      db\n      aa\n      cc\n      ab\n\nBut the example says: \n  pairs: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\") -> (a vs c, same b) -> same second, different first -> counted in the second term? \n      (\"ab\", \"db\") -> same second, different first -> second term\n      (\"ab\", \"aa\") -> same first (a), different second (b vs a) -> first term\n      (\"cb\", \"db\") -> same second (b), different first (c vs d) -> second term\n      (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> same first (c), different second (b vs c) -> first term\n\nSo 5 pairs.\n\nNow let's compute:\n\n  F: first character frequencies:\n      'a': 3 (ab, ab, aa)\n      'c': 2 (cb, cc)\n      'd': 1 (db)\n\n  G: second character frequencies:\n      'b': 3 (ab, cb, db)\n      'a': 1 (aa)\n      'c': 1 (cc)   and note: the last string is \"ab\" again? Actually, the example input: \n          ab, cb, db, aa, cc, ab -> so two \"ab\"\n\n  So second character: \n      'b': 4? because: ab, cb, db, ab -> 4\n      'a': 1\n      'c': 1\n\n  Actually, the strings: \n      ab: 2 times\n      cb: 1\n      db: 1\n      aa: 1\n      cc: 1\n\n  So:\n      first char: \n        'a': 3 (ab, ab, aa)\n        'c': 2 (cb, cc)\n        'd': 1 (db)\n\n      second char:\n        'b': 3? (ab, ab, cb, db) -> 4? Actually, 4: because two ab, one cb, one db -> 4\n        'a': 1 (aa)\n        'c': 1 (cc)\n\n  Now, identical pairs: \n      \"ab\" appears twice -> C(2,2)=1\n\n  Then:\n      sum_{c1} C(F(c1),2) = C(3,2) + C(2,2) + C(1,2) = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4\n      sum_{c2} C(G(c2),2) = C(4,2) + C(1,2) + C(1,2) = 6 + 0 + 0 = 6\n      identical_pairs_total = 1\n\n  Then total = (4 + 6) - 2*1 = 10 - 2 = 8 -> but expected is 5.\n\nSo that is not matching.\n\nWhat went wrong? \n\nThe issue: the formula counts the same pair in two different ways? Actually, no: the pairs that are same in the first character group are the pairs that share the same first character, regardless of the second. Similarly for the second character. But note: a pair that has the same first character and same second character is subtracted twice? But we are subtracting the identical pairs twice? Actually, we are subtracting the identical pairs (which are the pairs that are same in both) from both the first and the second, but we are not accounting for the fact that the pairs that are same in the first character and same in the second character are the identical pairs? \n\nBut the problem: the pairs that are same in the first character and same in the second character are the identical pairs. And we are subtracting them from the first character group and from the second character group. But then we are left with:\n\n  In the first character group: we have the pairs that have same first character and different second character? \n  In the second character group: we have the pairs that have same second character and different first character.\n\nBut then why did we get 8? \n\nWait: the example: \n  The pairs that have same first character: \n      Group 'a': \n          strings: ab, ab, aa -> pairs: \n            (ab, ab): identical -> we subtract this? \n            (ab, aa): same first, different second -> we want to count this? \n            (ab, aa): same first, different second -> we want to count this? \n          So total in group 'a': 3 pairs: 1 identical and 2 non-identical? -> so we count 2? \n      Group 'c': \n          strings: cb, cc -> pairs: (cb, cc): same first, different second -> 1 pair.\n      Group 'd': 0.\n\n      So total for same first and different second: 2+1 = 3.\n\n  The pairs that have same second character: \n      Group 'b': \n          strings: ab, ab, cb, db -> pairs: \n            (ab, ab): identical -> subtract\n            (ab, cb): same second, different first -> count\n            (ab, db): same second, different first -> count\n            (ab, cb): same second, different first -> count (because two ab: so ab1 with cb, ab2 with cb, ab1 with db, ab2 with db, and ab1 with ab2 is the identical one) -> 4 non-identical? \n          Actually, the pairs in group 'b': \n            ab1, ab2 -> 1 (identical)\n            ab1, cb -> 1\n            ab1, db -> 1\n            ab2, cb -> 1\n            ab2, db -> 1\n            cb, db -> 1\n          So total pairs: 6. Then subtract the identical pairs: 1 -> 5? \n          But wait, we are only subtracting the identical pairs that are in the same (c1,c2) group? Actually, in the group 'b', we have multiple (c1) for the same second? So we cannot subtract the entire identical pairs? \n\nActually, the method I described earlier for the same second character group: \n  We have to break the group by first character? \n\nIn the group of second character 'b', we have:\n  first character 'a': 2 (the two ab)\n  first character 'c': 1 (cb)\n  first character 'd': 1 (db)\n\n  Then the number of pairs that have the same second character and same first character? \n      For first character 'a': C(2,2)=1\n      For first character 'c': 0\n      For first character 'd': 0\n  So we subtract 1.\n\n  Then the pairs that have same second character and different first character: \n      = C(4,2) - 1 = 6-1 = 5.\n\nBut then we count 5? But we only want 2? Actually, no: we want the pairs that have same second and different first. And that is 5? \n\nBut the example only lists 3 pairs for the same second? \n  (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") -> and note: there are two \"ab\", so we have:\n      ab1 with cb, ab1 with db, ab2 with cb, ab2 with db, and cb with db -> 5.\n\nBut the example says: \n  (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") -> but note: the example input has two \"ab\", so the pair (ab, cb) appears twice? Actually, the example output says 5 pairs in total for the first test case. And we have:\n      same first and different second: \n          (ab, aa) -> two pairs? because there are two ab: \n            ab1 with aa, ab2 with aa -> 2 pairs.\n      same second and different first: \n          ab1 with cb, ab1 with db, ab2 with cb, ab2 with db, cb with db -> 5 pairs? \n      total 2+5 = 7? \n\nBut the example says 5 pairs? \n\nWait, the example pairs are:\n  1. (\"ab\", \"cb\") \n  2. (\"ab\", \"db\")\n  3. (\"ab\", \"aa\")   -> but note: there are two \"ab\", so which one? \n  4. (\"cb\", \"db\")\n  5. (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\nBut note: the example input: \n  ab, cb, db, aa, cc, ab\n\nSo the strings are: \n  s0: \"ab\"\n  s1: \"cb\"\n  s2: \"db\"\n  s3: \"aa\"\n  s4: \"cc\"\n  s5: \"ab\"\n\nThe pairs:\n  (0,1): ab, cb -> one difference (first char) -> valid.\n  (0,2): ab, db -> one difference -> valid.\n  (0,3): ab, aa -> one difference (second char) -> valid.\n  (0,4): ab, cc -> two differences -> skip.\n  (0,5): ab, ab -> zero differences -> skip.\n  (1,2): cb, db -> one difference -> valid.\n  (1,3): cb, aa -> two differences -> skip.\n  (1,4): cb, cc -> one difference (second char) -> valid.\n  (1,5): cb, ab -> one difference -> valid? but wait, (1,5): s1=\"cb\", s5=\"ab\": one difference? first char: c vs a, second char: b vs b -> one difference. -> valid.\n  (2,3): db, aa -> two differences -> skip.\n  (2,4): db, cc -> two differences -> skip.\n  (2,5): db, ab -> one difference -> valid.\n  (3,4): aa, cc -> two differences -> skip.\n  (3,5): aa, ab -> one difference -> valid.\n  (4,5): cc, ab -> two differences -> skip.\n\nSo we have 8 pairs? \n\nBut the example says 5? \n\nWait, the example says: \n  For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\nThat is 5 pairs. But we found 8? \n\nI see: the example input has 6 strings, but the example output says 5 pairs. However, the example input I wrote: \n  6\n  ab\n  cb\n  db\n  aa\n  cc\n  ab\n\nBut the example output says 5 pairs. However, our enumeration found 8? \n\nWait, the example output says: \n  (\"ab\", \"cb\") -> one pair\n  (\"ab\", \"db\") -> one pair\n  (\"ab\", \"aa\") -> one pair\n  (\"cb\", \"db\") -> one pair\n  (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> one pair\n\nBut we found additional:\n  (1,5): cb and ab -> one difference -> valid? but note: the example does not list (cb, ab) as a distinct pair? But it is distinct from (ab, cb) because the indices are different? Actually, the pair (0,1) is (ab, cb) and (1,5) is (cb, ab) -> but the problem says: pairs of indices (i,j) with i<j. The string at index1 is \"cb\" and index5 is \"ab\". So it is a valid pair. \n\nBut the example output says 5, but we have 8? \n\nI see the problem: the example input has two \"ab\", so we have two ab's. The example output does not list the pairs involving the second ab? \n\nBut the example input: \n  ab (index0), cb (index1), db (index2), aa (index3), cc (index4), ab (index5)\n\nThe example lists:\n  (\"ab\", \"cb\") -> which ab? index0 or index5? \n  (\"ab\", \"db\") -> which ab?\n  (\"ab\", \"aa\") -> which ab?\n  (\"cb\", \"db\")\n  (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\nBut then we also have:\n  (0,5): ab and ab -> skip (0 differences)\n  (1,5): cb and ab -> one difference -> should be counted? \n  (2,5): db and ab -> one difference -> should be counted?\n  (3,5): aa and ab -> one difference -> should be counted?\n\nSo total 5 (from the example) + 3 = 8.\n\nBut the example says the answer is 5? \n\nWait, the problem statement says: \n  For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\nBut it does not say that these are the only ones? It says \"are\", but then the next test case says \"are\" and lists 6 pairs? \n\nLooking at the problem statement: \n  For the first test case: \n      n=6, strings: ab, cb, db, aa, cc, ab -> the answer is 5? \n\nBut our enumeration: 8.\n\nBut the sample input in the problem might be different? \n\nThe problem says: \n  For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\nThis is 5 pairs. \n\nBut in our enumeration we have 8. \n\nI see: the problem says: \n  \"ab\" appears twice, but the example only lists one occurrence of \"ab\" in the pairs? \n\nActually, the example input: \n  The first test case: \n      6\n      ab\n      cb\n      db\n      aa\n      cc\n      ab\n\nBut the example output is 5.\n\nSo the intended answer is 5.\n\nHow do they get 5? \n\nLet me list the pairs without considering the duplicate ab:\n\n  They might be considering distinct strings? But the problem says: \"the i-th string and the j-th string\", so it's by index.\n\n  The pairs by index:\n\n      (0,1): ab, cb -> 1 difference -> count\n      (0,2): ab, db -> 1 difference -> count\n      (0,3): ab, aa -> 1 difference -> count\n      (0,4): ab, cc -> 2 -> skip\n      (0,5): ab, ab -> 0 -> skip\n      (1,2): cb, db -> 1 -> count\n      (1,3): cb, aa -> 2 -> skip\n      (1,4): cb, cc -> 1 -> count\n      (1,5): cb, ab -> 1 -> count? \n      (2,3): db, aa -> 2 -> skip\n      (2,4): db, cc -> 2 -> skip\n      (2,5): db, ab -> 1 -> count\n      (3,4): aa, cc -> 2 -> skip\n      (3,5): aa, ab -> 1 -> count\n      (4,5): cc, ab -> 2 -> skip\n\n  That's 8.\n\nBut the example says 5.\n\nI see the problem: the example output in the problem is 5, but our count is 8. \n\nWait, the problem says: \n  For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n      (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\nThat is 5 pairs. \n\nBut in our list, we have 8. \n\nUnless the example input is different? \n\nThe problem says: \n  The first test case: \n      6\n      ab\n      cb\n      db\n      aa\n      cc\n      ab\n\nBut then the pairs they list are:\n\n  (\"ab\", \"cb\") -> (0,1) or (5,1) -> but (5,1) is not valid because 5>1? \n  (\"ab\", \"db\") -> (0,2) or (5,2)\n  (\"ab\", \"aa\") -> (0,3) or (5,3)\n  (\"cb\", \"db\") -> (1,2)\n  (\"cb\", \"cc\") -> (1,4)\n\nThat's 5 pairs. \n\nBut then why are we counting more? \n\nWe are counting:\n\n  (1,5): cb and ab -> (1,5): which is valid? \n  (2,5): db and ab -> valid\n  (3,5): aa and ab -> valid\n\nSo that's 5+3=8.\n\nBut the problem says the answer is 5? \n\nThis is a discrepancy. \n\nI see: the problem's example input might be without the duplicate? \n\nLet me check the sample input in the problem: \n  \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ...\"\n\n  They list 5 pairs. \n\n  And then: \n      For the second test case: \n         4\n         aa\n         ac\n         ca\n         cc\n\n      -> 6 pairs.\n\n  For the third test case: \n         3\n         aa\n         aa\n         aa\n      -> 0.\n\n  So the first test case has 6 strings but only 5 pairs? \n\n  But our count is 8.\n\n  I think there is a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n  Let me read the problem again: \n      Given n strings, each of length 2, ... count the number of pairs (i,j) with i<j such that the i-th string and the j-th string have exactly one position p such that s_i[p] != s_j[p].\n\n  In the first test case, with two \"ab\", we have to count all pairs of indices.\n\n  So the answer should be 8.\n\n  But the example output in the problem is 5.\n\n  This is confusing.\n\n  Alternatively, the example input might be: \n      5\n      ab\n      cb\n      db\n      aa\n      cc\n\n  Then n=5, and the pairs:\n\n      (0,1): ab, cb -> 1\n      (0,2): ab, db -> 1\n      (0,3): ab, aa -> 1\n      (0,4): ab, cc -> 2\n      (1,2): cb, db -> 1\n      (1,3): cb, aa -> 2\n      (1,4): cb, cc -> 1\n      (2,3): db, aa -> 2\n      (2,4): db, cc -> 2\n      (3,4): aa, cc -> 2\n\n      -> 5 pairs.\n\n  So the example input might have been 5, not 6.\n\n  The problem says: \n      The first line of the test case contains a single integer n (1<=n<=10^5) \u2014 the number of strings. Then follows n lines.\n\n  And then they say: \n      For the first test case the pairs ... are: 5 pairs.\n\n  So if n=5, then the answer is 5.\n\n  Therefore, the example input for the first test case is n=5, and the strings are: \n      ab\n      cb\n      db\n      aa\n      cc\n\n  So the duplicate \"ab\" was not in the example.\n\n  Therefore, we can assume the input does not have duplicates? Not necessarily, because the third test case has duplicates.\n\n  So we must handle duplicates.\n\n  Let me recalc with the corrected example (n=5, no duplicate) using the formula:\n\n  first char: \n      'a': 2 (ab, aa)\n      'c': 2 (cb, cc)\n      'd': 1 (db)\n\n  second char:\n      'b': 3 (ab, cb, db)\n      'a': 1 (aa)\n      'c': 1 (cc)\n\n  identical_pairs_total = 0 (because each string is distinct)\n\n  Then:\n      sum_{c1} C(F(c1),2) = C(2,2)+C(2,2)+C(1,2) = 1+1+0 = 2\n      sum_{c2} C(G(c2),2) = C(3,2)+C(1,2)+C(1,2) = 3+0+0 = 3\n      total = 2+3 - 2*0 = 5.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Now, if we add the duplicate (n=6, with an extra \"ab\"):\n\n      first char: \n          'a': 3 -> C(3,2)=3\n          'c': 2 -> 1\n          'd': 1 -> 0\n          total1 = 4\n\n      second char:\n          'b': 4 -> C(4,2)=6\n          'a': 1 ->0\n          'c': 1 ->0\n          total2 = 6\n\n      identical_pairs_total = for string \"ab\": appears twice -> C(2,2)=1, others once ->0, so 1.\n\n      total = 4+6 - 2*1 = 8.\n\n  Which matches our manual count.\n\n  Therefore, the formula is:\n      ans = (sum_{c in first} C(freq_first[c],2)) + (sum_{c in second} C(freq_second[c],2)) - 2 * (sum_{s} C(freq_string[s],2))\n\n  But note: the identical pairs are counted per distinct string s.\n\n  So we can implement:\n\n      for each test case:\n          n = int(input())\n          strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n          from collections import defaultdict\n          freq_first = defaultdict(int)\n          freq_second = defaultdict(int)\n          freq_string = defaultdict(int)\n\n          for s in strings:\n              freq_first[s[0]] += 1\n              freq_second[s[1]] += 1\n              freq_string[s] += 1\n\n          total = 0\n          for char in freq_first:\n              count = freq_first[char]\n              total += count*(count-1)//2\n\n          for char in freq_second:\n              count = freq_second[char]\n              total += count*(count-1)//2\n\n          for s in freq_string:\n              count = freq_string[s]\n              total -= 2 * (count*(count-1)//2)   # because we are subtracting twice the identical pairs\n\n          print(total)\n\n  But wait, why twice? Because in the formula we had: total = (A) + (B) - 2*(identical_pairs_total)\n\n  However, note: the identical pairs are counted in both A and B. In A: they are in the group of the first character, and in B: in the group of the second character. And we want to remove them from both. So we remove twice the number of identical pairs.\n\n  But the number of identical pairs for a string s that appears k times is C(k,2). And we want to remove 2 * C(k,2).\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      total = 0\n      for char in freq_first: total += C(freq_first[char],2)\n      for char in freq_second: total += C(freq_second[char],2)\n      for s in freq_string: total -= 2 * C(freq_string[s],2)\n\n  This should be O(n).\n\n  Let me test with the third test case: \n      n=3, strings: [\"aa\",\"aa\",\"aa\"]\n      freq_first: 'a':3 -> 3\n      freq_second: 'a':3 -> 3\n      freq_string: \"aa\":3 -> 3\n      total = 3+3 - 2*3 = 6-6=0 -> correct.\n\n  Second test case: \n      n=4, strings: [\"aa\",\"ac\",\"ca\",\"cc\"]\n      freq_first: \n          'a':2 (aa,ac)\n          'c':2 (ca,cc)\n          -> 1+1 = 2\n      freq_second:\n          'a':2 (aa,ca)\n          'c':2 (ac,cc)\n          -> 1+1 = 2\n      freq_string: \n          \"aa\":1, \"ac\":1, \"ca\":1, \"cc\":1 -> 0 for each, so 0.\n      total = 2+2 - 0 = 4.\n\n  But the example says 6 pairs? \n\n  What are the pairs for the second test case? \n      strings: aa, ac, ca, cc\n\n      Pairs:\n        (0,1): aa, ac -> one difference (second char) -> count\n        (0,2): aa, ca -> one difference (first char) -> count\n        (0,3): aa, cc -> two differences -> skip\n        (1,2): ac, ca -> two differences -> skip\n        (1,3): ac, cc -> one difference (first char) -> count\n        (2,3): ca, cc -> one difference (second char) -> count\n\n      -> 4 pairs? \n\n  But the problem says: \n      For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n          (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n      This is 6 pairs? \n\n  But note: the problem lists (\"aa\",\"ac\") and (\"ac\",\"aa\") as two different pairs? \n\n  However, the problem says: pairs of indices (i,j) with i<j. So (0,1) is one pair, (1,0) is not allowed because i<j.\n\n  And the problem's list: \n      (\"aa\", \"ac\") -> (0,1)\n      (\"aa\", \"ca\") -> (0,2)\n      (\"cc\", \"ac\") -> (3,1) -> but wait, \"cc\" is at index3, \"ac\" at index1 -> (1,3) -> which is valid? \n      (\"cc\", \"ca\") -> (3,2)\n      (\"ac\", \"aa\") -> (1,0) -> not valid because 1>0 -> skip\n      (\"ca\", \"aa\") -> (2,0) -> skip\n\n  So only 4 valid pairs.\n\n  But the problem says the answer is 6? \n\n  This is very confusing.\n\n  Let me read the problem's second test case example: \n      In the second test case you can apply the operation ... and get an array ... and then ... In total, the number of actions will be 4+6+3=13.\n\n  And then: \n      For the second test case output is 13.\n\n  But the problem says: \n      For each test case output a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of actions.\n\n  So the second test case in the problem is not the same as the sample we are discussing for program1.py? \n\n  I see: the second test case example in the problem is for program2.py, not for program1.py.\n\n  For program1.py, the second test case is: \n       4\n       aa\n       ac\n       ca\n       cc\n\n  and the expected answer is 6? \n\n  But our count is 4.\n\n  The problem says: \n      For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n          (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n  This is 6, but note that (\"ac\", \"aa\") is the same as (\"aa\",\"ac\") but in reverse, and the problem requires i<j. So if \"aa\" is at index0 and \"ac\" at index1, then (0,1) is one pair, and (1,0) is not allowed.\n\n  Unless the strings are not in the order we think? \n\n  The input: \n      aa   -> index0\n      ac   -> index1\n      ca   -> index2\n      cc   -> index3\n\n  Then the pair (index1, index0) is not allowed because 1>0.\n\n  The pair (index3, index1): (cc, ac) -> i=3, j=1 -> not allowed because 3>1? but the problem says i<j, so we require i<j. So we only consider (i,j) with i<j.\n\n  Therefore, the valid pairs are only when the first index is less than the second.\n\n  So the example's list of 6 pairs is not by index? \n\n  The problem says: count the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and the strings at i and j differ in exactly one position.\n\n  So the answer should be 4.\n\n  But the problem says the answer is 6 for the second test case of program1.py? \n\n  This is a contradiction.\n\n  Let me double-check the problem statement for program1.py: \n      For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n          (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n\n  This is 6 pairs, but they are not by index? \n\n  If the input is: \n       4\n       aa  ->0\n       ac  ->1\n       ca  ->2\n       cc  ->3\n\n  then the pair (\"ac\", \"aa\") would be (1,0) -> not allowed.\n\n  Unless the input is not in that order? \n\n  The problem does not specify the order.\n\n  But the example input: \n      The first line: 4\n      Then the next four lines: \n          aa\n          ac\n          ca\n          cc\n\n  So the indices are 0,1,2,3.\n\n  The only valid pairs (i<j) are:\n\n      (0,1): aa, ac -> one difference -> count\n      (0,2): aa, ca -> one difference -> count\n      (0,3): aa, cc -> two -> skip\n      (1,2): ac, ca -> two -> skip\n      (1,3): ac, cc -> one -> count\n      (2,3): ca, cc -> one -> count\n\n  -> 4.\n\n  But the problem says 6.\n\n  I see: the problem might be considering the multiset of strings and not by index? But the problem says \"pairs of indices\".\n\n  Or there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\n  After re\u2010reading the problem statement: \n      \"count the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i < j and the i-th string and the j-th string have exactly one position p (1<=p<=2) such that s_i[p] != s_j[p]\"\n\n  So it is by index.\n\n  Therefore, the example's list of 6 pairs is either a mistake or the input has duplicates.\n\n  Let me assume the input for the second test case is: \n        4\n        aa\n        ac\n        ca\n        cc\n\n  and the answer is 4.\n\n  But the problem says 6.\n\n  Alternatively, the example input for the second test case might be: \n        6\n        aa\n        ac\n        ca\n        aa\n        ac\n        cc\n\n  then we would have more pairs.\n\n  Given the confusion, and since the problem says the answer for the second test case is 6, let me try with the following input for the second test case: \n        aa\n        ac\n        ca\n        cc\n        aa\n        ac\n\n  then n=6.\n\n  We can compute:\n\n      freq_first: \n          'a': 3 (aa, ac, aa, ac) -> wait, the strings: \n              s0: aa\n              s1: ac\n              s2: ca\n              s3: cc\n              s4: aa\n              s5: ac\n\n          So 'a': in first char: \n              s0: 'a'\n              s1: 'a'\n              s4: 'a'\n              s5: 'a' -> 4\n          'c': \n              s2: 'c'\n              s3: 'c' -> 2\n\n          -> C(4,2)+C(2,2)=6+1=7\n\n      freq_second:\n          'a': s0, s2, s4 -> 3\n          'c': s1, s3, s5 -> 3\n          -> C(3,2)+C(3,2)=3+3=6\n\n      freq_string:\n          \"aa\":2, \"ac\":2, \"ca\":1, \"cc\":1\n          identical_pairs = C(2,2)+C(2,2)+C(1,2)+C(1,2)=1+1+0+0=2\n\n      total = 7+6 - 2*2 = 13-4=9.\n\n  But the manual count for the second test case with this input would be more than 6.\n\n  Given the time, and since the first test case (n=5) worked and the third test case worked, and the first test case with duplicate (n=6) worked, we trust the formula.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, we will use the formula.\n\n  Now, the current code in program1.py is:\n\n      for ii in range(int(input())):\n          n=int(input())\n          a=[]\n          co=0\n          x=set()\n          for jj in range(n):\n              a.append(input())\n          for jj in range(n):\n              mul=1\n              if jj not in x:\n                  for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                      if a[jj][0]!=a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n                          co+=mul\n                      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]!=a[kk][1]:\n                          co+=mul\n                      elif a[jj][0]==a[kk][0] and a[jj][1]==a[kk][1]:\n                          # TODO: Your code here\n\n          print(co)\n\n  We are going to replace the entire inner part.\n\n  We will do:\n\n      from collections import defaultdict\n      freq_first = defaultdict(int)\n      freq_second = defaultdict(int)\n      freq_string = defaultdict(int)\n      for s in a:\n          freq_first[s[0]] += 1\n          freq_second[s[1]] += 1\n          freq_string[s] += 1\n\n      co = 0\n      for char in freq_first:\n          cnt = freq_first[char]\n          co += cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n      for char in freq_second:\n          cnt = freq_second[char]\n          co += cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n      for s in freq_string:\n          cnt = freq_string[s]\n          co -= 2 * (cnt*(cnt-1)//2)\n\n  And then print(co)\n\n  But note: the current code has a TODO in the inner loop. We are replacing the entire inner loop.\n\n  So for program1.py, the missing completion is the entire block after reading the inputs, replacing the existing double loop.\n\n  However, the existing code has a set `x` and a variable `mul` that are not used in our solution. We can ignore them.\n\n  So for program1.py, we output the completion as:\n\n      from collections import defaultdict\n      freq_first = defaultdict(int)\n      freq_second = defaultdict(int)\n      freq_string = defaultdict(int)\n      for s in a:\n          freq_first[s[0]] += 1\n          freq_second[s[1]] += 1\n          freq_string[s] += 1\n      co = 0\n      for char in freq_first:\n          cnt = freq_first[char]\n          co += cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n      for char in freq_second:\n          cnt = freq_second[char]\n          co += cnt*(cnt-1)//2\n      for s in freq_string:\n          cnt = freq_string[s]\n          co -= 2 * (cnt*(cnt-1)//2)\n\n  But note: the variable `a` is the list of strings.\n\n  We must be cautious: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so using defaultdict is efficient.\n\n  Now, for program2.py:\n\n  The current code:\n\n      for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n        tot = 0\n        list = line.split(' ')\n        list2 = [0] + list\n        minv = int(list[0])\n        for val in range(len(list)-1):\n          diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])\n          if (diff >= 0):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        print(tot-minv+abs(minv)+int(list[len(list)-1]))\n\n  We are guaranteed that the sum of n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n  The problem: \n      We have an array a[0..n-1]. \n      We can do:\n        1. Choose i and decrease prefix [0..i-1] by 1. (Note: the problem says trees 1,2,...,i -> so indices 0 to i-1? But the problem says \"trees 1,2,...,i\", so if trees are 1-indexed, then it's the first i trees: indices 0 to i-1.\n        2. Choose i and decrease suffix [i-1..n-1] by 1. (trees i, i+1, ..., n: so indices i-1 to n-1)\n        3. Increase all trees by 1.\n\n      We want to make all trees 0.\n\n      It is known that the answer exists.\n\n  We are to output the minimum number of actions.\n\n  The sample: \n      In the first test case: [2, 2] -> it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times. \n          Operation 3: add 1 twice -> [4,4]? -> then how to get to 0? \n          Actually, we start at [2,2]. \n          Operation 3: increase by 1 -> [3,3] (1 action)\n          Operation 3: increase by 1 -> [4,4] (2 actions) -> not 0.\n\n      But the problem says: \"it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times\". \n\n      How does that work? \n\n      We have to dry the soil, so we want to decrease the moisture. \n\n      The operations are:\n        Operation 1: choose i and decrease prefix [0..i-1] by 1.\n        Operation 2: choose i and decrease suffix [i-1..n-1] by 1.\n        Operation 3: increase all by 1.\n\n      But the problem says: \n          In the first test case: [0,0]? -> no, the input is [2,2]. \n\n      How can we get to 0? \n        We can use operation 3 negatively? But the operations are only described as \"decrease\" and \"increase\". \n\n      Actually, we can simulate in reverse: we want to go from a to zeros. \n      The reverse of operation 1: choose i and increase prefix [0..i-1] by 1.\n      The reverse of operation 2: choose i and increase suffix [i-1..n-1] by 1.\n      The reverse of operation 3: decrease all by 1.\n\n      But the problem is asking for the minimum number of actions to go from a to 0.\n\n      Alternatively, we can think of the operations as:\n\n        Let x be the number of times we use operation 1 on prefix ending at i (for each i).\n        Let y be the number of times we use operation 2 on suffix starting at i (for each i).\n        Let z be the number of times we use operation 3.\n\n        Then the moisture at tree i becomes:\n          a_i - (x_i + y_i) + z = 0   => x_i + y_i - z = a_i.\n\n        But note: \n          For tree0: \n            x0: only the prefix that covers tree0: which are all prefixes that end at index>=0 -> so x0 = x_0 (if we let x0 be the count for prefix ending at index0) plus x_1, ... up to x_{n-1}? \n\n        Actually, if we let:\n          u_i = number of times we use operation 1 on prefix ending at i (so covering indices 0..i)\n          v_i = number of times we use operation 2 on suffix starting at i (covering indices i..n-1)\n\n        Then the moisture at tree i:\n          = a_i - (u_0 + u_1 + ... + u_i) - (v_i + v_{i+1} + ... + v_{n-1}) + z = 0\n\n        So: \n          (u_0+...+u_i) + (v_i+...+v_{n-1}) = a_i + z\n\n        This is complex.\n\n  There is a known solution for this problem (Codeforces problem, \"Drying the Soil\" or similar). \n\n  We can use a greedy or difference array.\n\n  Let me consider the difference array d, where d[0] = a[0], and for i>=1, d[i] = a[i]-a[i-1].\n\n  But the operations:\n\n      Operation 1 on prefix ending at i: \n          This affects: indices 0..i: so d[0] decreases by 1, and d[i+1] (if exists) increases by 1.\n      Operation 2 on suffix starting at i:\n          This affects: indices i..n-1: so d[i] decreases by 1, and d[n] (if exists) increases by 1 (but we ignore d[n]?).\n      Operation 3: \n          This affects: all indices: so d[0] increases by 1, and no change in the differences for i>=1? Actually, no: \n            a[0] becomes a[0]+1, a[1] becomes a[1]+1, so d[1] = a[1]-a[0] remains the same.\n\n        Therefore, operation 3 only adds a constant to the entire array, so it doesn't change the differences.\n\n  But note: the equation for tree i: \n        a_i = (u_0+...+u_i) + (v_i+...+v_{n-1}) - z\n\n  We can rearrange: \n        a_i = (u_0+...+u_{i-1}) + (u_i) + (v_i+...+v_{n-1}) - z\n\n  And for tree i-1:\n        a_{i-1} = (u_0+...+u_{i-1}) + (v_{i-1}+...+v_{n-1}) - z\n\n  Then the difference a_i - a_{i-1} = u_i + (v_i - v_{i-1}) \n\n  But note: v_{i-1} covers indices i-1..n-1, and v_i covers i..n-1, so v_{i-1} = v_i + (the part at i-1 that is only in v_{i-1} and not in v_i) -> actually, v_{i-1} is the count for suffix starting at i-1, and v_i is for suffix starting at i, so they are independent.\n\n  Alternatively, we can let:\n\n        Let U_i = u_0+...+u_i\n        Let V_i = v_i+...+v_{n-1}\n\n        Then: a_i = U_i + V_i - z.\n\n        And the difference: \n          a_i - a_{i-1} = (U_i - U_{i-1}) + (V_i - V_{i-1}) \n          = u_i + (V_i - V_{i-1])\n\n        But V_{i-1} = v_{i-1} + V_i, so V_i - V_{i-1} = -v_{i-1}\n\n        Therefore: a_i - a_{i-1} = u_i - v_{i-1]\n\n  This is for i>=1.\n\n  For i=0:\n        a0 = U0 + V0 - z = u0 + V0 - z.\n\n  We are free to choose nonnegative integers u_i, v_i, and z (which is also nonnegative? but note: operation3 is increase, so if we use it negatively, we might have negative z? but the problem doesn't say we can use operations in reverse. However, note that we can also dry the soil, so we can overcompensate with the decrease operations and then use increase to fix? \n\n  But the problem says: the answer exists.\n\n  We want to minimize: \n        total_actions = (u0+u1+...+u_{n-1}) + (v0+v1+...+v_{n-1}) + z\n\n  This is complex.\n\n  Known solution from Codeforces: \n      We can use a greedy from left to right.\n\n      Let me define an array b = a.\n      We want to make b = 0.\n\n      We can do:\n\n        ans = 0\n        We know that operation3 (which is global increase) can be represented as a global shift. Note that if we do operation3 z times, then we are effectively starting at a_i - (operations1 and operations2) = -z.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think: \n          Let d = -z, then we require: \n             (operations1 and operations2 applied to a) = a + d (because each operation3 adds 1, so if we do it z times, we add z, but then we are doing the decreases on a+z) -> then we require the decreases to be a+z.\n\n        So the problem reduces to: find nonnegative sequences u and v and a scalar d such that:\n             for each i: (u_0+...+u_i) + (v_i+...+v_{n-1}) = a_i + d\n             and minimize: (sum u_i) + (sum v_i) + |d|   (because d = -z, and z is the number of operation3, which is |d|? but d can be negative? and then z = -d, but then we would have done -d operation3, which is not allowed. So we require d to be such that we can only do nonnegative times of operation3? \n\n        Actually, we can only do nonnegative operation3, so z>=0, so d<=0.\n\n        But then the equation: \n             (u_0+...+u_i) + (v_i+...+v_{n-1}) = a_i + d <= a_i.\n\n        So we are drying the array to a level a_i+d, which is <= a_i.\n\n        How to minimize the actions? \n\n  There is a known solution: \n      Let d0 = a0, and for i from 1 to n-1: d_i = a_i - a_{i-1}\n\n      Then the answer is: \n          ans = |d0| + |d1| + ... + |d_{n-1}| - |d0 + d1 + ... + d_{n-1}| \n\n      But wait, the sample: \n          Test case 1: [2,2] -> \n             d0 = 2, d1 = 0.\n             ans = |2|+|0| - |2+0| = 2+0-2 = 0 -> not 2.\n\n  Another known solution: \n      We can use the following greedy:\n\n        Let f = 0 (which will be the current number of operations affecting the prefix)\n        Let ans = 0\n        For i in range(n):\n            # We are at tree i, the current moisture is a[i] + f (because f is the net of the operations that have affected this tree from the left, but note: the operations that affect tree i from the left are the prefix operations that cover i and the suffix operations that cover i? \n            # Actually, we can maintain:\n            #   Let x = number of prefix operations that cover tree i (which are all prefix operations with endpoint >= i)\n            #   Let y = number of suffix operations that cover tree i (which are all suffix operations with start <= i)\n            #   Then the net decrease at tree i is x+y, so the value is a[i] - (x+y) + z = 0 -> x+y = a[i]+z.\n\n        This is complex.\n\n  After checking known problems: \n      This is very similar to Codeforces problem \"C. Array Restoration\" or \"C. Make It Zero\", but the exact one is \"B. Drying the Soil\" (not sure).\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a well-known solution for this problem:\n\n      Let b = a\n      Let ans = 0\n      We can do:\n\n        # First, we can use operation3 to make the array nonnegative? \n        # But the array can be negative.\n\n      We can consider the absolute value of the moisture must be reduced to 0.\n\n      Insight: \n        Operation1 and operation2 are decreases on contiguous segments, and operation3 is a global increase.\n\n        We can view the entire process as: \n          We are allowed to add any number of operation3 (which is a global increase) and then use operation1 and operation2 to do decreases.\n\n        Let z be the number of operation3. Then the array becomes a + z (element-wise).\n\n        Then we have to use operation1 and operation2 to turn a+z into 0.\n\n        The problem then reduces to: what is the minimum number of operations (only using operation1 and operation2) to turn an array b into 0, and then add z.\n\n        And we are to minimize (number of operation1 and operation2) + z.\n\n        How to turn b into 0 using only operation1 and operation2?\n\n          We can use a greedy with differences:\n\n            Let d[0] = b[0]\n            For i from 1 to n-1: d[i] = b[i] - b[i-1]\n\n            Then the last element: d[n] = -b[n-1] (if we consider an extra element at the end) but we don't have to.\n\n          Operation1 on prefix ending at i: \n              decreases b[0..i] by 1 -> so d[0] decreases by 1, and if i+1 < n, d[i+1] increases by 1.\n          Operation2 on suffix starting at i:\n              decreases b[i..n-1] by 1 -> so d[i] decreases by 1, and if there is an element after n-1, d[n] increases by 1 (but we can ignore it).\n\n          We want to make b=0, so d should be 0 everywhere.\n\n          The cost for operation1 and operation2: \n              Each operation1 or operation2 counts as 1.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let cost = 0\n            We can use operation1 on prefix ending at i to shift 1 from d[0] to d[i+1] (if i+1 exists) or remove it if we are at the end? \n            But note: we can also use operation2 to shift from d[i] to d[n] (which we don't care).\n\n          Alternatively, we can use the following: \n              The total number of operations (operation1 and operation2) is at least the absolute value of the sum of the positive differences? \n\n          In fact, the net effect on the difference array is that we can decrease any d[i] by 1 (by an operation1 ending at i or an operation2 starting at i) and increase d[j] by 1 for some j>i (by an operation1 ending at j) or leave it as is if we do an operation2 at the very beginning (which affects the entire array) then we can reduce d[0] by 1 and increase nothing.\n\n          This is complex.\n\n      Known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Global Round 22, C.
