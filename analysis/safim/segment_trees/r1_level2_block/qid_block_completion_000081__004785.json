Then set arr[2]=2. left: arr[1]=2 and 2 -> 2==2 -> no add. right: 2 and 0 -> 2!=0 -> add (2+1)*(5-1-2)=3*2=6 -> curr_aws=19+6=25.

The contribution: i=4 -> 4*(5-4)=4*1=4 -> remove 4 -> curr_aws=29-4=25. right: none (i=4 is last) -> skip. Then set arr[4]=5. left: arr[3]=4 and 5 -> 4!=5 -> add 4*(5-4)=4 -> curr_aws=25+4=29. So we get 29 at the end. But note: the example says after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29. However, the example input has:\n\n  n, m = 5, 1? Actually, the example input: \n      \"5 1\"\n      \"1 2 2 4 5\"\n      then one query: \"1 1\" -> but wait, the initial array is already [1,2,2,4,5]? Then the first query: \"i, x\" -> i=1, x=1?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays after each update.\nThe awesomeness of an array is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\nNote: The initial total awesomeness (aws) is set to (n*(n+1))//2, which is the total number of subarrays. Why?\nBecause the minimum awesomeness for a subarray of length L is 1 (if all same) and maximum is L (if all different). \nBut note: the problem states that the awesomeness is the number of blocks. For a subarray [l, r], the awesomeness is 1 plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1].\n\nTherefore, the total awesomeness over all subarrays can be expressed as:\n  Total = (number of subarrays) + (number of adjacent pairs (i, i+1) that are different, counted in every subarray that contains them)\n\nBut note: \n  For a fixed adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different, how many subarrays include this adjacent pair?\n  The subarray must start at any index from 0 to i, and end at any index from i+1 to n-1.\n  So, the count is (i+1) * (n-1-i).\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n  Total = n*(n+1)//2 + (for each i from 0 to n-2, if a[i] != a[i+1] then (i+1)*(n-1-i))\n\nHowever, the problem requires updating the array and recalculating the total after each update.\n\nWe note that an update at position i (0-indexed) might affect:\n  - The adjacent pair (i-1, i): if i>0\n  - The adjacent pair (i, i+1): if i<n-1\n\nSo we can maintain:\n  total_aws = base (which is the total number of subarrays) + contributions from each adjacent pair that is different.\n\nBut note: base = n*(n+1)//2 is fixed? Actually, the base is the total number of subarrays, which is fixed.\n\nHowever, the initial code sets:\n  aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2   [this is the base]\n\nThen, we have an array `tar` which is the current array? Actually, the function `update_awesomeness` is called with `tar` and we update `tar` at index i to x.\n\nBut note: the initial loop:\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n      aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, curr_aws=aws)\n\nThis suggests that we are building the array and updating the awesomeness as we set each element.\n\nHowever, the initial array is given. We are going to set the array `tar` from zeros to the initial array? But the initial array is non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of the initial state of `tar` as zeros? But the problem says the array elements are at least 1. So zeros are not valid.\n\nActually, the code uses:\n  arr = list(map(int, INPUT[1].split()))\n  tar = [0] * n\n\nThen for each index i, we set tar[i] to the initial value from arr, and update the awesomeness.\n\nSo we are starting from an array of zeros and updating to the initial array.\n\nBut note: the base total_aws = n*(n+1)//2 is the total for an array of zeros? Actually, no. We are going to update to the initial array.\n\nWe can maintain the current array in `tar` and the current total awesomeness.\n\nThe total awesomeness can be computed as:\n  total_aws = base + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (if a[i] != a[i+1] then (i+1)*(n-1-i) else 0)\n\nBut wait: the base is the total number of subarrays? Actually, if all adjacent pairs are the same, then the awesomeness of every subarray is 1, so total_aws = base = n*(n+1)//2.\n\nBut if there is a break (adjacent pair different) at position i, then we add (i+1)*(n-1-i) to the base? \n\nBut note: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 + (number of breaks inside [l, r]). Therefore, the total over all subarrays is:\n  base (which is the total number of subarrays) + (for each break at position i, the number of subarrays that include the break at i).\n\nSo the formula is:\n  total_aws = base + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} (if a[i]!=a[i+1] then (i+1)*(n-1-i) else 0)\n\nBut note: (i+1) is the number of starting points (0..i) and (n-1-i) is the number of ending points (i+1..n-1). So the break at i is included in (i+1)*(n-1-i) subarrays.\n\nTherefore, we can maintain an array `breaks` (or just a variable for the total) that holds the current contributions from each adjacent pair.\n\nHowever, the update function is:\n\n  def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n      # arr: the current array (which we are updating at index i to x)\n      # i: the index to update (0-indexed)\n      # x: the new value\n      # curr_aws: the current total awesomeness\n\nWe need to:\n  1. Remember the old value at arr[i] (so we can see what breaks were there before the update)\n  2. Update arr[i] to x.\n\nThen, we adjust the breaks at positions (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). Specifically:\n\n  - For the break at (i-1, i): \n        Before update: if arr[i-1] != old_value, then we had a break and we were contributing (i) * (n-1 - (i-1)) = i*(n-i) to the total.\n        After update: if arr[i-1] != x, then we have a break and we need to add that contribution. Otherwise, we remove it.\n\n        So we need to subtract the old contribution (if the break existed) and add the new contribution (if the break exists now).\n\n  - Similarly for the break at (i, i+1):\n        Before: if old_value != arr[i+1] then we had a break at i, contributing (i+1)*(n-1-i) = (i+1)*(n-2-i)? \n        Actually, the break at position i (between i and i+1) is at index i (0-indexed break index). The formula for a break at index i (0-indexed) is (i+1) * (n-1-i). \n        But note: for the break between i and i+1, the break index is i (so the left element is at i, right at i+1).\n\n        So the contribution for break at i is (i+1) * (n-1-i). \n\n        However, note: \n          The starting points for a break at i: from 0 to i -> (i+1) choices.\n          The ending points: from i+1 to n-1 -> (n-1-i) choices.\n\n        So the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n  old = arr[i]   # but note: we are going to update arr[i] to x, so we save the old value.\n\n  # Step 1: Remove the old breaks that involved the old value at position i.\n  #   Break at (i-1, i): if i>0\n  if i > 0:\n      if arr[i-1] != old:\n          # This break existed: remove its contribution\n          curr_aws -= i * (n - i)   # because the break index is i-1? Actually, the break between i-1 and i is at index i-1 -> so the contribution is (i) * (n-1 - (i-1)) = i*(n-i)\n  if i < n-1:\n      if old != arr[i+1]:\n          # Break at (i, i+1): break index i -> (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n          curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n  # Step 2: Update the array\n  arr[i] = x\n\n  # Step 3: Add the new breaks that involve the new value at position i.\n  if i > 0:\n      if arr[i-1] != x:\n          curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n  if i < n-1:\n      if x != arr[i+1]:\n          curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n  Return curr_aws\n\nBut note: the initial state of the array `tar` is zeros. Then we set each element. When we set the first element, we are updating from 0 to the initial value. Then we set the next, etc.\n\nHowever, when we set the first element (i=0), we only have a break at (0,1) if the next element is set? But the next element is still 0. So we must be cautious: the array is being built from zeros to the initial array.\n\nBut the initial array is given. We are setting the entire array. The breaks we remove: initially, the array is zeros. So when we update an element from 0 to x, the adjacent elements might be zeros or already set? Actually, we are setting in order? The loop is:\n\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):   # arr is the initial array\n      aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\nSo we set index0, then index1, then index2, etc.\n\nAt the time we set index i, the indices < i have been set to the initial values, and indices >= i are still 0.\n\nTherefore, when updating index i, we have:\n  - The left neighbor: if i>0, then arr[i-1] is the initial value (non-zero) and the old value at i is 0 -> so if the initial value at i-1 was not 0? Actually, the initial value at i-1 is non-zero and the old value at i is 0, so they were different -> we had a break at (i-1, i) that we must remove? But wait, we never added that break? \n\nActually, we are building the array. When we set index i, we are updating from 0 to x. The breaks that we are going to remove are the breaks that were present when the array had the old value (0) at i. But when we set index i, we are in the middle of building the array. The breaks that we are removing were added in a previous update? \n\nBut note: the breaks that we are going to remove are the ones that were present at the time of the update. However, the adjacent elements that are still 0? \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the initial total_aws is set to base = n*(n+1)//2. Then we update each index from 0 to the initial value. \n\nBut the initial array of zeros: \n  Every adjacent pair is 0==0 -> no break? So the total_aws would be base? \n\nThen when we set the first element (i=0) to a0:\n  - The left neighbor: none (i=0, so no left)\n  - The right neighbor: currently 0 -> so if a0 != 0? yes, so we add a break at (0,1): (0+1)*(n-1-0) = 1*(n-1)\n\n  Then we set the second element (i=1) to a1:\n      - Left: at index0 is a0, old value at index1 was 0 -> so we remove the break at (0,1) because a0 != 0? But wait, we just set index0 to a0 and index1 was 0 -> so we had a break at (0,1). Now we set index1 to a1.\n        Then we remove the break at (0,1) if a0 != 0? Actually, we remove the break that was there (because a0 != 0) and then we check the new breaks: \n          - Left: a0 and a1 -> if a0 != a1 then we add the break at (0,1) again? \n          - Right: a1 and the next element (index2, which is still 0) -> if a1 != 0 then we add a break at (1,2): (1+1)*(n-1-1) = 2*(n-2)\n\n  But note: if a0 == a1, then we don't add the break at (0,1) again.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nHowever, we must note: the array is being built from zeros to the initial array. The breaks that we remove are the ones that were present in the current state (which has zeros for indices not set). The breaks that we add are the ones that will be present after the update.\n\nBut the problem: the initial array is given. We are building the array from zeros to the initial array. The total_aws we start with is base = n*(n+1)//2, which is the total for an array of zeros? Actually, for an array of zeros, every adjacent pair is the same -> so no break? Then total_aws = base.\n\nThen we update each index to the initial value. The update function must account for the changes.\n\nTherefore, the update_awesomeness function can be implemented as above.\n\nBut note: the formula for the break at index i (0-indexed break between i and i+1) is (i+1) * (n-1-i). For the break at (i-1, i) (which is break index i-1) the contribution is i * (n-i).\n\nSo the code for update_awesomeness:\n\n  old = arr[i]\n  arr[i] = x   # but wait, the function is called with `tar` and we are going to update it? Actually, the function is called with `tar` and we are going to update the array at index i to x.\n\n  However, the function does not return the array? It returns the new aws. So we must update the array inside the function.\n\nBut note: the function signature is:\n\n  def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n\nWe are allowed to update arr? Yes, because we are passing the list `tar` and we update it.\n\nSo:\n\n  old = arr[i]   # save the old value\n  arr[i] = x     # update the array\n\n  Then we adjust the breaks at (i-1, i) and (i, i+1) by:\n      For each adjacent break (left and right) we:\n          - Remove the contribution of the break if it existed (i.e., if the two elements were different) in the old state (with the old value at i).\n          - Add the contribution of the break if it exists in the new state (with the new value at i).\n\n  But note: we updated the array at i to x. So when checking the left neighbor (i-1 and i) we use the new value at i and the current value at i-1 (which might have been set earlier). Similarly for the right.\n\nHowever, the removal step must be done before updating the array? Because we need to know the old state.\n\nSo we should:\n\n  old = arr[i]\n  # Step 1: Remove the contributions from the breaks that involved the old value at i (if they existed) in the current state.\n  if i > 0:\n      if arr[i-1] != old:\n          curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\n  if i < n-1:\n      if old != arr[i+1]:\n          curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n  # Step 2: Update the array\n  arr[i] = x\n\n  # Step 3: Add the contributions for the breaks that now exist with the new value at i.\n  if i > 0:\n      if arr[i-1] != x:\n          curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n  if i < n-1:\n      if x != arr[i+1]:\n          curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n  return curr_aws\n\nBut note: the array is being built. Initially, the array is zeros. When we set the first element (i=0), we remove the break at (0,1) if it existed? \n  - Before update: arr[0] is 0, and arr[1] is 0 -> so they are equal -> no break to remove.\n  - Then we set arr[0] to x0.\n  - Then we check: \n        left: none (i=0, so skip left)\n        right: now arr[0]=x0 and arr[1]=0 -> if x0 != 0? yes -> so we add (0+1)*(n-1-0) = 1*(n-1)\n\nThen we set the second element (i=1):\n  - old = arr[1] = 0\n  - Remove breaks:\n        left: i=1>0 -> check arr[0] (which is x0) and old (0): if x0 != 0 -> true -> remove i*(n-i) = 1*(n-1) -> so we remove the break we added at the first update.\n        right: i=1 < n-1? if n>2 then check: old (0) and arr[2] (which is 0) -> 0==0 -> no break to remove.\n  - Then set arr[1] to x1.\n  - Then add breaks:\n        left: arr[0] and arr[1] -> if x0 != x1? then add 1*(n-1) [same as before?] \n        right: if x1 != 0? then add (1+1)*(n-1-1) = 2*(n-2)\n\nBut note: the break at (0,1) was removed and then if x0 != x1 we add it again. So if x0==x1, then we don't add it.\n\nThis matches.\n\nHowever, what if we update an element that is not at the beginning? The same logic applies.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the array is updated and then we must output the total awesomeness.\n\nWe must be cautious: the array is 0-indexed, and the indices in the update query are given as 1-indexed? The input: \"i\" (1-indexed) so we subtract 1.\n\nIn the main loop for queries:\n  for line in INPUT[2:]:\n      i, x = map(int, line.split())\n      aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i - 1, x, aws)\n\nSo the function is called with 0-indexed index.\n\nTherefore, the code for update_awesomeness is as above.\n\nBut note: the variable `n` is the global n. We can use it inside the function? Actually, the function is defined after n is defined? In the code, n is defined in the global scope and then the function is defined. But the function is called after n is defined. However, we can pass n? But the function doesn't have n. \n\nWe have two options:\n  Option 1: make n global inside the function? But the function is defined in the same scope as n is defined? Actually, the function is defined first, then we read n. So the function does not know n.\n\nWe must change the function to take n? But the function signature is fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the length of the array? But the array is of length n.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  n = len(arr)\n\nBut note: the array is `tar` which is of length n. So we can compute n = len(arr) at the beginning of the function.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n      n = len(arr)\n      old = arr[i]\n      # Remove the old breaks\n      if i > 0:\n          if arr[i-1] != old:\n              curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\n      if i < n-1:\n          if old != arr[i+1]:\n              curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n      arr[i] = x   # update the array\n\n      if i > 0:\n          if arr[i-1] != x:\n              curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n      if i < n-1:\n          if x != arr[i+1]:\n              curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n      return curr_aws\n\nBut note: the formula for the right break: (i+1) * (n-1-i) -> because the break is at index i (so the starting points are 0..i -> i+1, and ending points are i+1..n-1 -> n-1-i).\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nLet's test with the example: \n  After the first query: [1, 2, 2, 4, 5] -> n=5.\n\n  Base = 5*6//2 = 15.\n\n  Then we build the array from zeros to [1,2,2,4,5]:\n\n  Step0: arr = [0,0,0,0,0] -> base = 15.\n\n  Step1: set index0 to 1.\n      old = 0\n      left: none.\n      right: 0 and arr[1]=0 -> 0==0 -> no removal for right.\n      Then set arr[0]=1.\n      left: none.\n      right: 1 and 0 -> 1!=0 -> add (0+1)*(5-1-0)=1*4=4 -> curr_aws=15+4=19.\n\n  Step2: set index1 to 2.\n      old=0\n      left: arr[0]=1 and old=0 -> 1!=0 -> remove: i=1 -> 1*(5-1)=1*4=4 -> curr_aws=19-4=15.\n      right: old=0 and arr[2]=0 -> 0==0 -> no removal.\n      Then set arr[1]=2.\n      left: arr[0]=1 and 2 -> 1!=2 -> add 1*(5-1)=4 -> curr_aws=15+4=19.\n      right: 2 and 0 -> 2!=0 -> add (1+1)*(5-1-1)=2*3=6 -> curr_aws=19+6=25.\n\n  Step3: set index2 to 2.\n      old=0\n      left: arr[1]=2 and old=0 -> 2!=0 -> remove: i=2 -> 2*(5-2)=2*3=6 -> curr_aws=25-6=19.\n      right: old=0 and arr[3]=0 -> 0==0 -> no removal.\n      Then set arr[2]=2.\n      left: arr[1]=2 and 2 -> 2==2 -> no add.\n      right: 2 and 0 -> 2!=0 -> add (2+1)*(5-1-2)=3*2=6 -> curr_aws=19+6=25.\n\n  Step4: set index3 to 4.\n      old=0\n      left: arr[2]=2 and old=0 -> 2!=0 -> remove: i=3 -> 3*(5-3)=3*2=6 -> curr_aws=25-6=19.\n      right: old=0 and arr[4]=0 -> 0==0 -> no removal.\n      Then set arr[3]=4.\n      left: arr[2]=2 and 4 -> 2!=4 -> add 3*(5-3)=6 -> curr_aws=19+6=25.\n      right: 4 and 0 -> 4!=0 -> add (3+1)*(5-1-3)=4*1=4 -> curr_aws=25+4=29.\n\n  Step5: set index4 to 5.\n      old=0\n      left: arr[3]=4 and old=0 -> 4!=0 -> remove: i=4 -> but i=4: left break? i>0 -> yes, but i=4: left break is at (3,4). The contribution: i=4 -> 4*(5-4)=4*1=4 -> remove 4 -> curr_aws=29-4=25.\n      right: none (i=4 is last) -> skip.\n      Then set arr[4]=5.\n      left: arr[3]=4 and 5 -> 4!=5 -> add 4*(5-4)=4 -> curr_aws=25+4=29.\n\n  So we get 29 at the end.\n\nBut note: the example says after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29. However, the example input has:\n\n  n, m = 5, 1? Actually, the example input: \n      \"5 1\"\n      \"1 2 2 4 5\"\n      then one query: \"1 1\" -> but wait, the initial array is already [1,2,2,4,5]? \n\n  Then the first query: \"i, x\" -> i=1, x=1? That would set the first element to 1, which is the same? \n\n  Actually, the example says: \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\". \n\n  The problem says: \"There are m queries of two integers i, x. A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\"\n\n  The initial array is given. Then we have m queries. The first query is the first after the initial array.\n\n  But the code:\n\n      n, m = map(int, INPUT[0].split())\n      arr = list(map(int, INPUT[1].split()))\n      tar = [0] * n\n      aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n      # Then we process the queries: for each query, we update and print.\n\n  So the initial building of the array from zeros to the initial array is done in the for-loop. Then we process the queries.\n\n  The example input has m=1, so after building the array we have one query.\n\n  The example says: \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\". But the initial array is [1,2,2,4,5] and then the first query is \"1 1\", which sets the first element to 1 (same as before). So the array remains [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29.\n\n  How do we get 29? We just built the array and the total_aws is 29. Then we do the query: update index0 to 1 (same as before) -> so no change? Then we output 29.\n\n  Therefore, the initial building must yield 29.\n\n  We did: \n      Step0: base=15\n      Step1: set index0 to 1 -> 15+4=19\n      Step2: set index1 to 2 -> 19-4+4+6=25\n      Step3: set index2 to 2 -> 25-6+6=25? But we did 25-6=19 then +6=25? Then we added 6 for the right? -> 25+6=31? \n\n  Wait, I see an error in step3: \n      After setting index2 to 2:\n        left: we did not add because 2==2 -> so we only added the right break: 6 -> so 19+6=25.\n\n  Then step4: set index3 to 4: \n        remove left: 6 -> 25-6=19\n        then add left: 6 and right:4 -> 19+6+4=29.\n\n  Then step5: set index4 to 5:\n        remove left: 4 -> 29-4=25\n        then add left: 4 -> 25+4=29.\n\n  So the initial building yields 29.\n\n  Then the query: update index0 (which is 1) to 1: \n      old=1, new=1.\n      Remove breaks:\n          left: none.\n          right: old=1 and arr[1]=2 -> 1!=2 -> remove (0+1)*(5-1-0)=1*4=4 -> curr_aws=29-4=25.\n      Then set to 1.\n      Then add breaks:\n          left: none.\n          right: 1 and 2 -> 1!=2 -> add 4 -> 25+4=29.\n\n  So we get 29.\n\n  But what if we update to a different value? For example, update index0 to 2? \n      old=1, new=2.\n      Remove breaks:\n          right: 1 and 2 -> break existed -> remove 4 -> 29-4=25.\n      Then set to 2.\n      Then check: \n          left: none.\n          right: now 2 and arr[1]=2 -> 2==2 -> no break -> so we don't add the 4.\n      So total_aws=25.\n\n  Then we must recalc: \n      The array becomes [2,2,2,4,5]. \n      The breaks: \n          (0,1): 2==2 -> no break.\n          (1,2): 2==2 -> no break.\n          (2,3): 2!=4 -> break -> contribution: (2+1)*(5-1-2)=3*2=6.\n          (3,4): 4!=5 -> break -> contribution: (3+1)*(5-1-3)=4*1=4.\n      Total_aws = base (15) + 6+4 = 25.\n\n  So it matches.\n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n  def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n      n = len(arr)\n      old = arr[i]\n      # Remove the old breaks that involve the old value at i\n      if i > 0:\n          if arr[i-1] != old:\n              curr_aws -= i * (n - i)   # break at (i-1, i): break index = i-1 -> contribution = i * (n - i) [because starting points: 0..i-1 -> i, ending points: i..n-1 -> n-i]\n      if i < n-1:\n          if old != arr[i+1]:\n              curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)   # break at (i, i+1): break index = i -> (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n      arr[i] = x   # update the array\n\n      if i > 0:\n          if arr[i-1] != x:\n              curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n      if i < n-1:\n          if x != arr[i+1]:\n              curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n      return curr_aws\n\nBut note: the formula for the left break: the break between i-1 and i: \n  The break index is i-1. The number of starting points: from 0 to i-1 -> i choices.\n  The number of ending points: from i to n-1 -> n - i choices.\n  So the contribution is i * (n-i).\n\nFor the right break: the break between i and i+1: \n  The break index is i. The number of starting points: from 0 to i -> i+1 choices.\n  The number of ending points: from i+1 to n-1 -> n-1-i choices.\n  So the contribution is (i+1)*(n-1-i).\n\nThis matches.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are to count the number of distinct multisets of palindromic numbers that sum to n. \nWe note: the order does not matter (it's a multiset). So we are counting the number of partitions of n using palindromic parts.\n\nWe are generating a list of palindromic numbers up to 40000 (since n<=40000). Then we use dynamic programming for partitions.\n\nThe code:\n\n  R=range\n  m=40001\n  d=10**9+7\n  p=[]   # list of palindromic numbers\n  for i in R(1,m):\n      n_str = str(i)\n      if n_str == n_str[::-1]:\n          p.append(i)\n\n  Then we have:\n      a = [1] + [0]*m   # a[0]=1, a[i] will be the number of partitions of i.\n\n  Then we iterate over the palindromic numbers:\n\n      for i in p:\n          for j in R(i, m):\n              # TODO: update a[j] by adding the ways to form j by including the palindromic number i.\n\n  The recurrence for the partition problem: \n        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j - i]) % d\n\n  But note: the classical coin change problem: \n        for coin in coins:\n            for j from coin to m:\n                a[j] += a[j-coin]\n\n  This counts the number of distinct multisets (order doesn't matter) and the coins are the palindromic numbers.\n\n  However, the problem says: two ways are different if the frequency of at least one palindromic integer is different. So it is the classical partition function.\n\n  Therefore, the inner loop should be:\n\n        for j in range(i, m):\n            a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n  But note: the array `a` is being updated in increasing order of j. This is the standard unbounded knapSack? Actually, the problem does not bound the number of times we can use a palindromic number. So it is unbounded.\n\n  The classical coin change (unbounded) for counting the number of ways:\n\n        a[0] = 1\n        for each coin i in coins:\n            for j from i to m:\n                a[j] += a[j-i]\n\n  This is exactly what we need.\n\n  However, the palindromic list p is generated for numbers from 1 to 40000. Then we iterate over each coin (each palindromic number) and then for j from i to 40000.\n\n  The time complexity: the number of palindromic numbers up to 40000 is about 500? (because 1-digit: 9, 2-digit: 9, 3-digit: 90, 4-digit: 90, 5-digit: 300? Actually, 1 to 40000: \n      1-digit: 1..9 -> 9\n      2-digit: 11,22,...,99 -> 9\n      3-digit: 101,111,...,999 -> 90\n      4-digit: 1001,1111,...,9999 -> 90? but 40000 is 4-digit: the maximum is 39993? Actually, we go up to 40000, so the 4-digit palindromic numbers: \n          abba: a from 1 to 4, b from 0 to 9 -> a=1: 1001,1111,...,1991 -> 10; a=2: 2002,...,2992 -> 10; a=3: 3003,...,3993 -> 10; a=4: 4004 -> but 4004>40000? no, 4004<40000. \n          Actually, 40000: the next palindromic number after 39993 is 40004 which is >40000. So 4-digit: 90? Actually, 3-digit: 90, 4-digit: 90? \n      But 1 to 40000: \n          1-digit: 9\n          2-digit: 9\n          3-digit: 90\n          4-digit: 90? -> total 198.\n\n      Actually, we can count: \n          for 1-digit: 9\n          for 2-digit: 9\n          for 3-digit: 9*10 = 90 (first digit:1-9, second:0-9, third: same as first) -> but 1-digit and 2-digit are included? \n          for 4-digit: 9*10 = 90? (first:1-9, second:0-9, then the last two are mirror) -> but 4-digit: abba: a:1-9, b:0-9 -> 90.\n\n      Then 5-digit: the smallest is 10001, which is >40000? so we don't consider.\n\n      So total palindromic numbers: 9+9+90+90 = 198.\n\n  Then the inner loop: for each coin (198 coins) and j from i to 40000 -> total operations: 198 * 40000 ~ 7.92e6, which is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n  But note: the modulus is 10**9+7, stored in d.\n\n  However, the code already has:\n\n      a = [1] + [0]*m   # m=40001, so a[0]=1, a[1..40000]=0\n\n      for i in p:\n          for j in R(i, m):\n              a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\n  Then we read t test cases and for each n, we output a[n].\n\n  But note: the example: n=5 -> 7, n=12 -> 74.\n\n  We can test with n=5: \n      The palindromic numbers <=5: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\n      We initialize a[0]=1.\n\n      Then for coin=1:\n          j from 1 to 40000: \n            a[1] += a[0] -> 1\n            a[2] += a[1] -> 1\n            a[3] += a[2] -> 1\n            a[4] += a[3] -> 1\n            a[5] += a[4] -> 1\n\n      Then for coin=2:\n          j from 2 to 40000:\n            a[2] = 1 + a[0] = 1+1=2\n            a[3] = 1 + a[1] = 1+1=2\n            a[4] = 1 + a[2] = 1+2=3\n            a[5] = 1 + a[3] = 1+2=3\n\n      Then for coin=3:\n          j from 3 to 40000:\n            a[3] = 2 + a[0] = 2+1=3\n            a[4] = 3 + a[1] = 3+1=4\n            a[5] = 3 + a[2] = 3+2=5\n\n      Then for coin=4:\n          j from 4 to 40000:\n            a[4] = 4 + a[0] = 4+1=5\n            a[5] = 5 + a[1] = 5+1=6\n\n      Then for coin=5:\n          j from 5 to 40000:\n            a[5] = 6 + a[0] = 6+1=7\n\n      So a[5]=7 -> correct.\n\n  Then n=12: we get a[12]=74? We don't compute by hand, but the note says 74.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\n\nBut note: the code uses `R` for range and `m` as 40001.\n\nSo the completed code for program2.py is:\n\n  R=range\n  m=40001\n  d=10**9+7\n  p=[]\n  for i in R(1,m):\n      n=str(i)\n      if n==n[::-1]:p+=[i]\n  a=[1]+[0]*m\n  for i in p:\n      for j in R(i,m):\n          a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d   # This is the missing line\n\n  for n in[*open(0)][1:]:print(a[int(n)])\n\nNow, we output the missing code for both programs in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the body of the function update_awesomeness.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the inner assignment in the inner loop.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\nFor program1.py, the entire function body is missing? Actually, the function is defined with a TODO. We are to replace the TODO with the code.\n\nBut the function is:\n\n  def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the code we wrote.\n\nSimilarly, in program2.py, the TODO is in the inner loop.\n\nTherefore:\n\n  program1: the missing code is the entire function body (without the function definition) but note: the function definition is already there. We are to output the code that goes inside the function.\n\n  program2: the missing code is the single line: \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nAnd the output format: JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\nSo:\n\n  \"program1\": \"    n = len(arr)\\n    old = arr[i]\\n    if i > 0:\\n        if arr[i-1] != old:\\n            curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        if old != arr[i+1]:\\n            curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    if i > 0:\\n        if arr[i-1] != x:\\n            curr_aws += i * (n - i)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        if x != arr[i+1]:\\n            curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    return curr_aws\"\n\n  \"program2\": \"        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\nBut note: the program2 code has an indentation: the inner loop is already indented. The missing line should be indented by 8 spaces? Actually, the existing code has:\n\n      for i in p:\n          for j in R(i, m):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we replace the TODO with the line, and the line should be indented by 8 spaces? But the problem says \"output the missing code\", meaning the exact code that replaces the TODO.\n\n  However, the TODO is in the inner loop. The missing code is the line that does the update. We output that line with the same indentation as the TODO? The TODO is indented by 8 spaces? Actually, the TODO is at the same level as the for-loop. But the code we write must be at the same level.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". For program2, it's a single line. We output that line with the necessary indentation? Actually, the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we output only the line that goes in the inner loop.\n\n  However, the example output format: we output the string that is the code.\n\n  We note: the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n      for i in p:\n          for j in R(i, m):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with the line: \"a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\n  So the missing code for program2 is that line.\n\n  But the line must be indented? Actually, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level? The for-loops are indented by 4 and 8. So the inner line should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact string that would replace the TODO.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output without extra indentation? The problem does not specify. However, the program2.py code is written without extra indentation in the provided part? \n\n  Actually, the provided code:\n\n      R=range\n      m=40001\n      d=10**9+7\n      p=[]\n      for i in R(1,m):\n          n=str(i)\n          if n==n[::-1]:p+=[i]\n      a=[1]+[0]*m\n      for i in p:\n          for j in R(i,m):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n      for n in[*open(0)][1:]:print(a[int(n)])\n\n  The inner loop has the TODO at 8 spaces (two levels). So we output the line with 8 spaces? \n\n  But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the code that goes in the inner loop. The inner loop body is one line. We output that line with 8 spaces? \n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output without any indentation? But that would break the program.\n\n  Since the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the missing code is the body of the inner loop, we output the line with the same indentation as the TODO (which is 8 spaces). \n\n  But the TODO is a comment. We are replacing the comment with the code. So we output the line with 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. But the existing code uses 4 per level? \n\n  We'll assume 8 spaces (two levels of 4) for the inner loop.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code\", and the missing code is the line that does the update. We can output:\n\n        \"        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\n  with 8 spaces.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" \n\n  Alternatively, we can output without the indentation? But that would be incorrect.\n\n  We decide to output the code as it would be placed: with the same indentation as the for-loop body.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify. But the example output format is a string. We output the string that is the code for the missing part.\n\n  For program1, the missing part is the entire function body (without the function definition). We output the function body as a string, with the necessary indentation.\n\n  We'll use 4 spaces per level.\n\n  The function body:\n\n      n = len(arr)\n      old = arr[i]\n      if i > 0:\n          if arr[i-1] != old:\n              curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\n      if i < n-1:\n          if old != arr[i+1]:\n              curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n      arr[i] = x\n      if i > 0:\n          if arr[i-1] != x:\n              curr_aws += i * (n - i)\n      if i < n-1:\n          if x != arr[i+1]:\n              curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n      return curr_aws\n\n  We must format this as a string with newlines and the same indentation.\n\n  We'll use 4 spaces for the first indent, 8 for the inner.\n\n  So:\n\n      \"    n = len(arr)\\n    old = arr[i]\\n    if i > 0:\\n        if arr[i-1] != old:\\n            curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        if old != arr[i+1]:\\n            curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    if i > 0:\\n        if arr[i-1] != x:\\n            curr_aws += i * (n - i)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        if x != arr[i+1]:\\n            curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    return curr_aws\"\n\n  For program2:\n\n      \"        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\n  with 8 spaces at the beginning.\n\nBut note: the function in program1 is already indented by 4? The function definition is:\n\n  def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with the body. The body should be indented by 4 relative to the function definition. So we output the body with 4 spaces of indentation for each line? Actually, the entire body is at the same level as the TODO.\n\n  We output the body as:\n\n      line1: 4 spaces: \"    n = len(arr)\"\n      line2: 4 spaces: \"    old = arr[i]\"\n      etc.\n\n  But the function body is one level in. So we use 4 spaces per line.\n\n  However, the conditionals and inner blocks are further indented. We use 4 more spaces per level.\n\n  So the entire body is:\n\n      n = len(arr)   -> 4 spaces\n      old = arr[i]   -> 4 spaces\n      if i>0:        -> 4 spaces\n          if ...     -> 8 spaces\n          ...        -> 12 spaces? \n\n  But the standard is 4 per level. We'll do:\n\n      level0: 4 spaces (for the function body)\n      level1: 8 spaces (for the if block)\n      level2: 12 spaces (for the inner if)\n\n  However, the problem does not specify. We'll use 4 per level.\n\n  We write:\n\n      \"    n = len(arr)\\n    old = arr[i]\\n    if i > 0:\\n        if arr[i-1] != old:\\n            curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        if old != arr[i+1]:\\n            curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    if i > 0:\\n        if arr[i-1] != x:\\n            curr_aws += i * (n - i)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        if x != arr[i+1]:\\n            curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    return curr_aws\"\n\n  This uses:\n      Each line of the body is indented by 4 spaces (the first level of the function body).\n      The inner if statements: 8 spaces (4+4) for the condition, and then the inner statement: 12 spaces? \n\n  But the example: \n\n      if i>0:   -> 4 spaces for the if, then the inner if is 8 spaces? \n\n  Actually, the body of the if should be indented. We use:\n\n      if i>0:\n          if ...:   -> this is 8 spaces\n          ...        -> 12 spaces\n\n  But the problem: we have:\n\n      if i>0:\n          if ...: \n              ...   -> 12 spaces\n\n  So we output:\n\n      \"    n = len(arr)\"\n      \"    old = arr[i]\"\n      \"    if i > 0:\"\n      \"        if arr[i-1] != old:\"\n      \"            curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\"\n      ... \n\n  This is 4,4,4,8,12 for the subtraction.\n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but the code must run. The Python interpreter requires consistent indentation. We use 4 spaces per level.\n\n  We output the string as above.\n\n  For program2, we output:\n\n      \"        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n\n  with 8 spaces at the beginning (so that it is the body of the inner for-loop).\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n  \"program1\": \"    n = len(arr)\\n    old = arr[i]\\n    if i > 0:\\n        if arr[i-1] != old:\\n            curr_aws -= i * (n - i)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        if old != arr[i+1]:\\n            curr_aws -= (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    arr[i] = x\\n    if i > 0:\\n        if arr[i-1] != x:\\n            curr_aws += i * (n - i)\\n    if i < n-1:\\n        if x != arr[i+1]:\\n            curr_aws += (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    return curr_aws\",\n  \"program2\": \"        a[j] = (a[j] + a[j-i]) % d\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 line has a modulus operation? The problem says \"modulo 10^9+7\", and we have d=10**9+7. We use the variable d.\n\nWe output the JSON string.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and we have provided the code.\n\nBut note: the program1 function body: we have a line \"n = len(arr)\"? But the array is passed as `arr` and we need to know the length. This is correct.\n\nWe are confident.\n\nLet's write the JSON."
