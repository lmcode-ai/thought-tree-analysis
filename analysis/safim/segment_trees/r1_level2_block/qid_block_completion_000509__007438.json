So to get out of the white region in row x, we must move the doll to the right until y>=a_x? But note: we can also move down? Actually, we can move down: then we go to row x+1, and the white condition for row x+1: y < a_{x+1}. Since the sequence a is non-increasing: a_{x} >= a_{x+1}. Therefore, if we are at (x,y) and we move down to (x+1,y), then if y < a_{x+1} we are still white? How to get to a black cell? We need to have y>=a_x for row x, but if we move down we go to row x+1 and we require y>=a_{x+1}? Since a_{x+1} <= a_x, it might be easier to satisfy in a lower row? However, we can also move right: (x,y) -> (x,y+1). Then in the same row, we require y+1>=a_x?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: \n   We have n items with prices, and q queries. For each query (x, y): \n   If a customer buys at least x items, then the y cheapest ones are free.\n   We are to compute the maximum total value of items received for free.\n\n Approach:\n   We note that the customer can choose any set of items (so we choose the ones that maximize the free value).\n   Since the free items are the y cheapest among the purchased items, to maximize the free value we want to have as many expensive items as possible? \n   But note: the free items are the cheapest ones. So we want to have as many expensive items as possible that are not free? Actually, we want the free items to be as expensive as possible? \n   However, the free items are the cheapest ones in the purchase. Therefore, to maximize the free value, we want the y cheapest items in the purchase to be as expensive as possible.\n\n   How can we achieve that?\n   We can choose to buy a set of exactly x items. Then the free ones are the y cheapest in that set. \n   But note: the problem says \"at least x\", so we can buy more than x? However, if we buy more than x, then we get the y cheapest for free. But note that if we buy more, then the set of free items might be even cheaper? \n   Actually, the problem states: \"if a customer purchases at least x items, y cheapest of them are free\". So the customer can choose to buy more than x. However, we are to maximize the free value.\n\n   Observation: \n     The free value is the sum of the y cheapest items in the purchase. To maximize that, we want the y cheapest items to be as expensive as possible. \n     But if we buy more items, then we are adding items that are cheaper than the ones we already have? (because we can choose the items arbitrarily, so we choose the most expensive ones available). \n\n   Actually, we can choose any set of items. So the best strategy is to choose the set of items that has the largest y items (which will be the cheapest in that set) as expensive as possible.\n\n   How?\n     We sort the items in descending order. Then the free items will be the last y items in the chosen set. To maximize the sum of the last y items, we want the entire set to be as expensive as possible? \n     But note: if we choose a set of size k (k>=x), then the free items are the y smallest in that set. We can choose k arbitrarily? However, we are constrained by the requirement that we must have at least x items.\n\n   Actually, we can choose exactly x items? Why? \n     Because if we choose more than x, then we are including some items that are cheaper than the ones we could have excluded. And that might reduce the minimum y items? \n\n   Let's consider: \n     Suppose we choose a set S of size k (k>=x). The free items are the y smallest in S. \n     We can always replace S by a subset of S that has exactly x items and that contains the y smallest items? But note: if we remove some of the larger items, then the y smallest might become even smaller? \n\n   Actually, the best is to choose the set of exactly x items that has the largest possible y-th smallest element? \n\n   However, note: we are summing the y smallest. So we want the y smallest to be as large as possible and as many as possible? \n\n   Alternate approach:\n     Sort the entire list of prices in descending order. Then the free items in a set of k items (with k>=x) will be the last y items in the chosen set (if we take the top k items). \n     But note: we can choose any k items arbitrarily. So the best set of k items is the top k items (because we want the entire set to be as expensive as possible, so that the smallest y in that set are as expensive as possible).\n\n     Then the free value for a fixed k (>=x) is the sum of the last y items in the top k? But note: the top k in descending order: the last y are the smallest in the set. \n\n     However, we are allowed to choose k arbitrarily (as long as k>=x). So for a query (x,y), we want:\n        max_{k from x to n} { (sum of the last y in the top k) }\n\n     But note: the top k items are the k largest. The last y in the top k (when sorted descending) are the y smallest in the set. \n\n     How do we compute the sum of the last y in the top k? \n        If we have the prefix sum for the top k (in descending order), then the last y are the segment from index k-y to k-1? \n        Actually, if we have the array sorted in descending order: \n          a[0] >= a[1] >= ... >= a[k-1]\n        Then the last y are a[k-y] to a[k-1]. \n\n        But note: the prefix sum array p for the descending array: \n          p[0] = a[0]\n          p[1] = a[0]+a[1]\n          ...\n          p[i] = a[0]+...+a[i]\n\n        Then the sum of the last y in the top k is: \n          p[k-1] - p[k-1 - y]   ??? \n\n        Actually, if we have the prefix sum from 0 to i, then the sum from i to j (with i<=j) is p[j] - p[i-1]. \n\n        We want the segment from k-y to k-1: \n          start index = k-y, end index = k-1 -> that's y elements.\n\n        So the sum = p[k-1] - p[k-y-1]   (if k-y-1 >=0, else p[k-1] if k-y==0)\n\n        However, note: our prefix array p is 0-indexed and we have a [0] as the first.\n\n     But wait: is it beneficial to take more than x? \n        Consider: if we take k=x, then the free value = p[x-1] - p[x-y-1] (if we define p for the entire array in descending order).\n\n        If we take k=x+1, then the free value = p[x] - p[x+1-y-1] = p[x] - p[x-y]? \n\n        Which one is bigger? \n          We have: \n            k=x: free = a[x-y] + ... + a[x-1]   (in the descending array, these are the smallest y in the top x)\n            k=x+1: free = a[x+1-y] + ... + a[x]   (the smallest y in the top x+1)\n\n        Since the array is sorted descending, a[x] <= a[x-y] (because x-y < x, and the array is descending). \n        But note: the set of free items in k=x+1: the y smallest in the top x+1 are the last y of the top x+1, which are a[x+1-y] ... a[x]. \n        And the set of free items in k=x: the last y of the top x: a[x-y] ... a[x-1]. \n\n        Compare: \n          a[x+1-y] vs a[x-y]: since x+1-y = (x-y)+1, so a[x+1-y] <= a[x-y] (because the array is descending). \n          Similarly, every element in the free set for k=x+1 is <= the corresponding element in the free set for k=x? \n\n        Therefore, the free value for k=x+1 is less than or equal to that for k=x? \n\n        Actually, let me test with small numbers:\n          n=3, prices = [5,3,1] (descending: [5,3,1])\n          Query: x=2, y=1 -> then if we take k=2: free = min(5,3)=3 -> but the last 1 in the top2: the last one is 3 -> sum=3.\n          If we take k=3: free = the last 1 in the top3: which is 1 -> sum=1.\n\n        So indeed, taking more items might reduce the free value.\n\n        Therefore, for a fixed (x,y), the best is to take exactly x items? \n\n        Why? Because if we take more than x, we are adding cheaper items at the end, which then become the free ones? \n\n        But wait: what if we take more than x, but we avoid adding cheap items? \n          Actually, we are forced to take the top k? Because if we skip a more expensive item and take a cheaper one, then the set of items we take is not the top k? \n\n        However, note: we can choose any set. So we can choose the set that has the largest y items? \n\n        Actually, the free items are the y cheapest in the set. To maximize the sum of the y cheapest, we want the entire set to be as expensive as possible? \n\n        But if we are forced to take at least x items, then the best is to take the x most expensive items? Why?\n          Because if we take a set that includes a cheap item, then that cheap item will be one of the free ones? And that would reduce the free value? \n\n        Therefore, the optimal set is the x most expensive items. Then the free items are the y smallest in that set.\n\n        So for a query (x,y): \n          We take the top x items (largest x items) and then the free value is the sum of the smallest y items in that set.\n\n        How to compute that?\n          We sort the entire array in descending order. Then the top x items are a[0] to a[x-1]. \n          The smallest y in that set are the last y of these x: that is a[x-y] to a[x-1]. \n\n          So the sum = p[x-1] - p[x-y-1]   (if we have a prefix sum array p, where p[i] = a[0]+a[1]+...+a[i])\n\n          But note: our prefix array p is 0-indexed and we have a[0] at index0.\n\n          Example: \n            n=3, a = [5,3,1] (descending)\n            p[0]=5, p[1]=8, p[2]=9.\n            Query: x=2, y=1: \n              We take the top 2: [5,3]. The smallest 1 is 3.\n              How to compute: \n                x=2, y=1 -> we want the segment from index (2-1) to index (2-1) -> that is one element at index1? \n                But note: the last y in the top x: \n                  We have indices: 0:5, 1:3 -> the last y=1: index1? \n                Then the sum = p[1] - p[0] = 8-5 = 3 -> correct.\n\n          Another: x=3, y=2: \n            We take the top3: [5,3,1]. The smallest 2: 3 and 1 -> sum=4.\n            Compute: \n              We want the segment from index (3-2)=1 to index 2? \n              But our prefix: \n                p[2]=9, p[1]=8 -> then the segment from 1 to 2: 9 - 8 = 1? -> that's only the last element? \n\n          Correction: \n            We want the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1). \n            For x=3, y=2: from index 1 to 2 -> that's two elements: a[1] and a[2] -> 3+1=4.\n\n            How to compute with prefix: \n              p[2] - p[0] = 9 - 5 = 4? -> but that is the sum from index0 to index2 minus the prefix up to index0? That gives a[1]+a[2]? \n\n            Actually, our prefix array p is inclusive from 0 to i. \n            We have: \n              p[2] = a[0]+a[1]+a[2]\n              p[0] = a[0]\n              Then p[2]-p[0] = a[1]+a[2] -> correct.\n\n            So the formula: \n              free_value = p[x-1] - p[x-y-1]   if x-y-1 >=0, and if x-y==0 then we use p[x-1] (but then we are taking the entire top x? and y=x, so we take all? but then we subtract p[-1] which we don't have).\n\n          We built the prefix with a [0] at the beginning: \n            p = [0] + list(accumulate(a))\n\n          Then p[i] = sum of a[0] to a[i-1]? \n            Actually, if we do: \n              p = [0] + list(accumulate(a))\n            Then p[0]=0, p[1]=a[0], p[2]=a[0]+a[1], ... p[i] = sum of a[0] to a[i-1].\n\n          Then the segment from index i to j (inclusive) in the array a (0-indexed) is p[j+1]-p[i].\n\n          We want the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the array a? \n            That is: \n              start index = x-y, end index = x-1 -> that's (x-1) - (x-y) + 1 = y elements.\n\n            Then the sum = p[x] - p[x-y]   because:\n              p[x] = sum(a[0] to a[x-1])\n              p[x-y] = sum(a[0] to a[x-y-1])\n              Then p[x]-p[x-y] = a[x-y] + ... + a[x-1] -> which is the last y of the top x.\n\n          Example: \n            a = [5,3,1] (descending), then p = [0,5,8,9]\n            Query: x=2, y=1: \n              free_value = p[2] - p[2-1] = 8 - 5 = 3 -> correct.\n            Query: x=3, y=2:\n              free_value = p[3] - p[3-2] = 9 - 5 = 4 -> correct.\n\n          But note: what if y=x? \n            Then free_value = p[x] - p[0] = p[x] -> which is the entire top x? -> correct.\n\n          What if y=0? \n            The problem states: y>=1, so we don't have to worry.\n\n        Therefore, for each query (x,y), we output: p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n        However, note: our array a is sorted in descending order? \n          Yes, because we did: a = sorted(R())[::-1]   -> that sorts in ascending and then reverses -> descending.\n\n        And we built p as: p = [0] + list(accumulate(a))\n\n        Then for a query (x,y): \n          We need to compute: p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n        But note: our array a has n elements. We built p with n+1 elements: indices 0..n.\n\n        We must be cautious: \n          x can be at most n, and x-y>=0 (since y<=x).\n\n        So the indices x and x-y are in [0, n]? \n          x: from 1 to n (because x>=y>=1 and x<=n) -> but note: the input says x>=y>=1 and x<=n? \n          Actually, the input says: \"1<=y<=x<=n\", so x in [1, n] and y in [1, x].\n\n        Therefore, x-y is in [0, x-1] and x in [1, n]. \n\n        So we can compute: \n          free_value = p[x] - p[x-y]\n\n        Example: \n          n=3, a = [5,3,1] -> p = [0,5,8,9]\n          Query: (x=1,y=1): \n            free_value = p[1]-p[0] = 5-0 = 5 -> but wait: \n              We take the top 1: [5] -> the smallest 1 is 5 -> correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code in program1.py for the loop is:\n\n          x_i, y_i = map(int, input().split())\n          result = p[x_i] - p[x_i - y_i]\n          print(result)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the array has n items. But what if the query has x_i that is greater than n? \n          The input says: \"1<=y_i<=x_i<=n\", so x_i is at most n.\n\n        But note: our p array has length n+1. So we can index up to n.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n          for _ in range(q):\n              x, y = R()\n              print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n        But wait: the example in the note: \n          \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n          How does that match?\n\n          The example input: \n            n=3, q=3, and the prices: [5,3,5] -> but note: the example says the two cheapest in the set of three are 3 and 5? \n          Actually, the example says: \n            \"the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n\n          But wait: the two cheapest in [5,3,5] are 3 and 5? That is 8.\n\n          How do we process?\n            Sort the prices: [3,5,5] in ascending? Then descending: [5,5,3]\n            Then p = [0,5,10,13]   -> because 5, then 5+5=10, then 10+3=13.\n            Query: x=3, y=2: \n                free_value = p[3] - p[3-2] = 13 - p[1] = 13-5 = 8 -> correct.\n\n          Second query: x=2, y=1: \n                free_value = p[2]-p[1] = 10-5 = 5 -> but the example says 5? \n                The example: \"the cheapest of them is 5\" -> correct.\n\n          Third query: x=3, y=3: \n                free_value = p[3]-p[0] = 13-0 = 13? but the example says 1+2+3=6? \n\n          Wait, the example input for the third query: \n            \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n          But our example input prices are [5,3,5]? \n\n          There seems to be a discrepancy. The note says: \n            \"In the first query: ... three items worth 5,3,5\"\n            \"In the second query: ... two items worth 5 and 5\"\n            \"In the third query: ... all the items to receive the three cheapest: 1+2+3=6\"\n\n          This implies that the store has more than 3 items? \n\n          Actually, the problem statement says: \n            \"The store sells n items\"\n\n          And the input: \n            first line: n and q.\n\n          The example note does not specify n and q? \n\n          But the example input in the note: \n            Input: \n              3 3\n              5 3 5\n              3 2\n              2 1\n              3 3\n\n          Then the third query: x=3, y=3: \n            We take the top 3: [5,5,3] -> the three cheapest: 5,5,3 -> sum=13? \n\n          But the note says: 1+2+3=6? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Let me read the note again: \n            \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n          This implies that the store has more than 3 items? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"The store sells n items\", and the input says n=3. \n\n          So the example input has n=3. Then the third query: \n            The customer must buy at least 3 items -> so buys all 3. Then the three cheapest (which are all) are free -> total free value = 5+3+5 = 13? \n\n          But the note says 6? \n\n          I see: the example note is inconsistent. The problem statement says: \n            \"The store sells n items\" and the input has n=3. \n\n          However, the note says: \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n          This implies that the store has at least 3 items, but the prices are 1,2,3? \n\n          Actually, the problem statement says: the input for the prices is the second line: p1, p2, ..., pn.\n\n          So the example input: \n            n=3, and the prices: 5,3,5.\n\n          Therefore, the example note must be referring to a different input? \n\n          But the problem note says: \n            \"In the first query, ... three items worth 5,3,5\"\n\n          So the prices are 5,3,5.\n\n          Then the third query: \n            The customer buys all 3: the three cheapest are 3,5,5? -> the entire set? -> sum=13.\n\n          However, the note says 6. \n\n          This is a mistake in the note? \n\n          But wait: the problem statement says: \n            \"Note: In the first query, ...\"\n\n          And then the second and third. \n\n          The example input is: \n            3 3\n            5 3 5\n            3 2\n            2 1\n            3 3\n\n          Then the outputs should be: \n            8\n            5\n            13\n\n          But the note says: \n            first query: 8\n            second query: 5\n            third query: 6\n\n          This is inconsistent.\n\n          I see: the problem note says: \n            \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n          This implies that the store has items with prices 1,2,3? \n\n          But the input we are given is 5,3,5.\n\n          Therefore, the example note is for a different input? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The first line contains two integers n and q ... The second line contains n integers p1, p2, ...\"\n\n          The example note does not specify the input? \n\n          After reading the problem again: \n            The note says: \n              \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n              \"In the second query, a customer can buy two items worth 5 and 5, the cheapest of them is 5\"\n              \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n          This suggests that the store has at least 6 items? with prices including 1,2,3,5,5,3? \n\n          But the input says n=3? \n\n          I think the note is giving three independent examples? \n\n          The problem says: \"for the given values of x and y\", meaning for each query we are given x and y.\n\n          The example input: \n            n=3, q=3, prices = [5,3,5], and then the queries: \n              (3,2) -> output 8\n              (2,1) -> output 5\n              (3,3) -> output 13\n\n          But the note says for the third query: 6? \n\n          This is confusing. However, the problem statement says: \n            \"NoteIn the first query, ...\"\n\n          And then the second and third. \n\n          I think the note is not using the same input? \n\n          But the problem says: \"the store sells n items\", and the example input has n=3. \n\n          Therefore, the third query must be 13.\n\n          However, the problem note says 6. \n\n          I see: the problem note says: \n            \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n          This implies that the store has items: 1,2,3 and possibly others? But the customer buys all items (which are more than 3) and then the three cheapest are 1,2,3? \n\n          But the input for the third query is (x=3, y=3). The customer must buy at least 3 items. The store has n items. The customer can choose which items? \n\n          The problem says: \"the customer makes one purchase\" and \"the store sells n items\". \n\n          The customer can choose any set of items? \n\n          Therefore, for the third query, the customer can choose to buy the three items that are 1,2,3? Then the free value is 1+2+3=6? \n\n          But wait: the store has n items. The problem does not say that the customer is limited to the entire stock? \n\n          Actually, the customer can choose any set of items? \n\n          Therefore, for the third query (x=3, y=3): \n            The customer can choose any set of at least 3 items. To maximize the free value (which is the sum of the 3 cheapest in the set), the best is to choose the three most expensive items? \n            But then the free value would be the entire set? \n\n          However, note: the free value is the sum of the y cheapest in the set. To maximize that, we want the three cheapest in the set to be as expensive as possible. \n\n          How? \n            We choose the three most expensive items? Then the three cheapest in that set are the entire set? \n\n          But if we choose a set of more than 3 items, then the three cheapest might be cheaper? \n\n          Actually, the best is to choose the three items that are the three most expensive? \n\n          Why? \n            Because if we choose a set that includes a cheap item, then that cheap item will be one of the three cheapest? \n\n          Therefore, the best set is the three most expensive items? \n\n          But the store has items: 1,2,3,5,5,3? (if the store has 6 items) then the three most expensive are 5,5,3? -> free value=5+5+3=13? \n\n          How do we get 1+2+3=6? \n\n          The customer can choose the set {1,2,3}? Then the free value=1+2+3=6. \n\n          But is that the maximum? \n            If the customer chooses {5,5,3}: free value=13 -> which is bigger than 6.\n\n          Therefore, the maximum free value for (3,3) is 13, not 6.\n\n          The note says: \"a customer has to buy all the items\" -> meaning the entire stock? \n\n          But the problem does not require buying the entire stock. It requires buying at least x items. \n\n          The note says: \"a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free\" -> this implies that the store has more than 3 items? \n\n          And the three cheapest in the entire stock are 1,2,3? \n\n          Then the free value would be 1+2+3=6? \n\n          But the customer is not forced to buy the entire stock? The customer can choose any set of at least 3 items. \n\n          Therefore, the customer does not have to buy the entire stock. \n\n          The note is misleading? \n\n          The problem says: \"for the given values of x and y\", so for the third query we are given x=3, y=3. \n\n          The customer can choose any set of at least 3 items. The maximum free value is 13 (by choosing the three most expensive items) if the store has the items 5,5,3? \n\n          But the example input has n=3 and the items are 5,3,5. \n\n          Then the customer must choose the entire stock? because there are only 3 items. \n\n          Then the free value = 5+3+5 = 13? \n\n          The note says 6? \n\n          This is a contradiction.\n\n          I think the note is for a different input. \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"NoteIn the first query, ...\"\n\n          And then the second and third. \n\n          The first query: (3,2) -> output 8: which matches our computation for the input [5,3,5] -> 8.\n\n          The second query: (2,1) -> output 5: which matches.\n\n          The third query: (3,3) -> output 13: but the note says 6.\n\n          Therefore, the note must be for a different input? \n\n          The problem says: \n            \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\n          This implies that the store has at least 3 items, and the three cheapest in the entire store are 1,2,3. \n\n          But the input we are given is [5,3,5] for the first example? \n\n          So the note is giving two examples? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"Note\" and then three queries. \n\n          It might be that the note is for a different store? \n\n          But the problem says: \"the store sells n items\", and the input for the example in the note is not provided? \n\n          We must rely on the problem specification: \n            The customer can choose any set of items (any subset) of size at least x. \n\n          Therefore, for a given store with n items and prices, for a query (x,y), we do:\n\n            Sort the entire list of prices in descending order.\n            Then the best set is the top x items? (as argued) and the free value is the sum of the last y of the top x.\n\n          And we computed: p[x] - p[x-y] (with p the prefix sum of the descending array, with p[0]=0, p[1]=a0, etc.)\n\n          Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n            from itertools import accumulate\n            I=input; R=lambda:map(int,I().split())\n            n,q=R(); a=sorted(R())[::-1]; p=[0]+list(accumulate(a))\n            for _ in range(q):\n                x, y = R()\n                print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n        But note: the problem constraints: n,q up to 200,000. \n          Sorting: O(n log n) -> acceptable.\n          Building the prefix: O(n)\n          Each query: O(1)\n\n        So we are good.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\n  The problem: \n    We are given an integer n and a non-increasing sequence a0, a1, ..., an (and for i>n, a_i=0).\n    The grid: cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x, and black otherwise.\n\n    Initially, one doll at (0,0). \n    Operation: remove a doll at (x,y) and place a doll at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y).\n    Goal: make all white cells contain 0 dolls.\n\n    We are to compute the minimum number of operations modulo 10^9+7.\n\n  Approach:\n\n    The problem is complex. We note the provided code:\n\n        n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n        for i in range(1,9**6):f.append(f[-1]*i%m)\n        for z in map(int,input().split()):# TODO: Your code here\n        print(d%m)\n\n    We see:\n      - n is read.\n      - Then we build a list `f` of factorials up to 9**6 (which is 531441) modulo m? \n        But note: the constraints: a_i up to 200000, and n up to 200000. \n        Why factorials? Probably for combinatorics.\n\n      - Then we iterate over the sequence a0, a1, ... an (which is n+1 integers).\n\n    We have variables: \n        x: probably not used? or to be updated? \n        d: which will be the answer (and we print d%m)\n\n    We need to process each z (which is a_i) in the sequence.\n\n    How to solve the problem?\n\n    Insight from known similar problems (like CodeForces problems) and the example:\n\n      The goal is to remove all dolls from white cells. \n\n      The operation: \n        Removing a doll at (x,y) and placing two: at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y).\n\n      Note: \n        (x,y+1) is to the right? (since y increases: columns to the right) \n        (x+1,y) is down.\n\n      The grid: \n        White: (x,y) with y < a_x.\n\n      The initial doll is at (0,0). \n\n      We want to move all dolls out of the white cells? But note: the goal is to have 0 dolls in every white cell. \n        However, the black cells can have dolls? \n\n      The problem says: \"make all white cells contain 0 dolls\".\n\n      We can move dolls arbitrarily? \n\n      The operation: \n        It splits one doll into two: one to the right and one down.\n\n      We note that the grid is infinite. \n\n      How to model the problem?\n\n      Known similar problem: \"Jina goes to school\" or \"Dolls on a grid\".\n\n      We can think in terms of paths? \n\n      Each doll at (x,y) must be \"evacuated\" to a black cell? \n\n      But note: the operation does not remove the doll, it splits it. However, we can keep splitting until they are all in black cells? \n\n      Actually, the process stops when there is no doll in any white cell.\n\n      How many operations are required? \n\n      Note: one operation removes one doll and creates two. So the total number of dolls increases by one per operation.\n\n      Initially: 1 doll.\n      After k operations: we have 1+k dolls.\n\n      We need to assign each doll to a black cell? \n\n      But the problem does not require the dolls to be in black cells? It only requires white cells to have 0. \n\n      However, if a doll is in a white cell, we must split it until it moves out of the white region? \n\n      The white region for row x: y < a_x. So to get out of the white region in row x, we must move the doll to the right until y>=a_x? \n\n      But note: we can also move down? \n\n      Actually, we can move down: then we go to row x+1, and the white condition for row x+1: y < a_{x+1}. \n\n      Since the sequence a is non-increasing: a_{x} >= a_{x+1}. \n\n      Therefore, if we are at (x,y) and we move down to (x+1,y), then if y < a_{x+1} we are still white? \n\n      How to get to a black cell? \n        We need to have y>=a_x for row x, but if we move down we go to row x+1 and we require y>=a_{x+1}? \n\n      Since a_{x+1} <= a_x, it might be easier to satisfy in a lower row? \n\n      However, we can also move right: (x,y) -> (x,y+1). Then in the same row, we require y+1>=a_x? \n\n      Therefore, the minimal number of moves to get a doll from (x,y) to a black cell? \n\n      But note: we are allowed to split. The problem is to remove all dolls from white cells. \n\n      Alternate insight:\n\n        We can use dynamic programming or combinatorial counting.\n\n        Known solution for similar problems: \n          The key is to note that a doll at (x,y) can be removed by moving it to (x, a_x) (by moving right a_x - y times) and then moving down? \n\n        However, we can also move down first.\n\n        Actually, the problem is equivalent to: \n          We want to cover all white cells with \"operations\" that push the dolls out. \n\n        There is a known solution for this problem (from CodeForces): \n          The answer is the sum over i from 0 to n of (number of dolls that ever passed through (i, a_i - 1))? \n\n        But note: the example: \n          n=1? but the example input: \n            \"In the given grid, cells (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1) are white\" -> so a0=2, a1=2? (because white if y<2 -> so y=0,1 are white) and then a2=0? \n\n          The example input: \n            n=1? \n            But the example says: \"The first example\" and then 5 operations.\n\n          The input: \n            n=?\n            The sequence: a0, a1, ... an.\n\n          The example: \n            \"The first example\" -> the input: \n              n=1? \n              a0=2, a1=2? but then we have two values? so n=1 -> then we have a0 and a1? \n\n          Actually, the input: \n            first line: n\n            second line: n+1 integers: a0, a1, ..., an.\n\n          So for the example: n=1, then a0, a1.\n\n          The grid: \n            row0: white for y<2 -> so (0,0) and (0,1) are white.\n            row1: white for y<2 -> so (1,0) and (1,1) are white.\n            row2: white for y<0 -> none.\n\n          The initial doll: (0,0).\n\n          Operations: 5.\n\n        How to compute the answer?\n\n        Known solution from a similar problem (CodeForces 1684E) or (1685A)? \n\n        Actually, this problem is CodeForces 1685B - Linguistics.\n\n        But I recall a known solution:\n\n          The answer is: \n            d = 0\n            for i in range(n+1):\n                # Consider the cell (i, a_i - 1) if a_i>0, because if a_i==0 then there is no white cell in that row? \n                # But note: if a_i>0, then the cell (i, a_i-1) is the last white cell in row i? \n                # We need to push any doll that goes through (i, a_i-1) to the right to (i, a_i) (black) or down to (i+1, a_i-1) (which might be white if a_{i+1} > a_i? but the sequence is non-increasing, so a_{i+1} <= a_i) -> but if a_{i+1} > a_i-1, then (i+1, a_i-1) is white? \n\n            Actually, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n            Let dp[i][j] = number of operations that are related to row i and column j? \n\n        Alternatively, we note the provided code builds factorials up to 531441, which is about 500000, so we might need factorials for numbers up to 500000.\n\n        The known solution (from known submissions for the problem \"Dolls\" in CodeForces) is:\n\n          We traverse the sequence a_i for i from 0 to n.\n\n          We maintain a variable for the current \"available\" dolls from above? \n\n          The idea: \n            We start at (0,0). We must push the doll to the right until it becomes black? or push it down? \n\n          Actually, we can use a greedy: \n            We consider the points (i, a_i - 1) for i such that a_i > 0. \n\n          But note: the problem is to remove dolls from white cells. The critical point is the boundary: (i, a_i-1) is the last white cell in row i.\n\n          How many times must we use the boundary cell (i, a_i-1) as an intermediate? \n\n          Known solution (from a similar problem): \n            Let b_i = a_i - i. \n            Then we consider the sequence b_i. \n\n          But I found a known solution for the same problem (CodeForces 1685B) in a contest:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            typedef long long ll;\n            const int N = 500050;\n            const int mod = 1e9+7;\n\n            int n, a[N];\n            int fac[N], ifac[N];\n\n            int main(){\n                ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n                cin.tie(0);\n                fac[0] = 1;\n                for(int i = 1; i < N; i++) fac[i] = 1LL * fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n\n                cin >> n;\n                for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n\n                int ans = 0;\n                for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++){\n                    if(a[i] == 0) break;\n                    // C(i+a[i], i+1)\n                    int x = i + a[i];\n                    int y = i+1;\n                    // compute C(x, y) = fac[x] * inv(fac[y]) * inv(fac[x-y]) % mod;\n                    // but we don't have ifac? \n                    // However, note the provided code builds factorials only up to 9**6, but we need up to 500000? \n                }\n                cout << ans;\n            }\n\n          But this is not complete.\n\n        Another known solution (from an accepted submission for CF1685B):\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            const int maxn = 500100;\n            const int mod = 1e9 + 7;\n\n            int n, a[maxn], fac[maxn], invf[maxn];\n\n            int main() {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n                for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n                }\n                fac[0] = 1;\n                for (int i = 1; i < maxn; i++) {\n                    fac[i] = 1LL * fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n                }\n                int ans = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n                    if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                    // C(a[i] + i, i+1)\n                    int x = a[i] + i;\n                    if (x < i+1) continue;\n                    ans = (ans + fac[x] * 1LL * fac[i+1] % mod * fac[x-i-1] % mod ... ) // wait, we need combination C(x, i+1) = fac[x] * inv(fac[i+1]) * inv(fac[x-i-1]) % mod\n                    But we don't have inv? \n\n                }\n                printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n            }\n\n        Actually, the provided code in program2.py has built factorials up to 9**6 (which is 531441) but the maximum we need is a[i]+i, which can be up to 200000+200000 = 400000. \n\n        But 9**6 is 531441, which is greater than 400000, so we are safe.\n\n        The recurrence in the known solution: \n            ans = sum_{i=0}^{n} { C(a[i]+i, i+1) }   [if a[i]>0, and if a[i]==0 then break?]\n\n        Why break when a[i]==0? \n            Because the sequence is non-increasing and a_i=0 for i>n, but we are iterating only to n. \n            However, if a[i]==0, then there are no white cells in row i? and also for j>i, a_j=0? \n            But the problem says: for i>n, a_i=0. And we are iterating i from 0 to n.\n\n            But if a[i]==0 for some i<=n, then we break? \n\n        However, the sequence is non-increasing and a_i>=0. So if a_i==0, then for all j>=i, a_j=0.\n\n        Therefore, we can break.\n\n        How does this formula come about?\n\n          Consider the boundary cell (i, a_i-1). To evacuate a doll that is at (0,0) to avoid this cell, we might not pass through it? \n\n          But the known solution counts the number of paths from (0,0) to (i, a_i-1) and then we must use that cell? \n\n          Actually, the operation is not a path of one doll, but splitting. \n\n          Insight: \n            Each operation can be seen as a branching in a tree. The entire process is a tree with root (0,0). \n            The number of times the doll at (0,0) spawns a doll that passes through (i, j) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j) in the grid, moving only right and down? \n\n          But note: the operation: \n            (x,y) -> (x,y+1) and (x+1,y)\n\n          This is like: from (x,y) you can go right or down? \n\n          However, the doll at (x,y) is replaced by two dolls: one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). \n\n          So the number of dolls that pass through (x,y) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) in a grid with moves: \n            Actually, the moves are reversed: \n              To have a doll at (x,y), it could come from (x-1,y) by a down move (from the parent at (x-1,y) splitting to (x-1,y+1) and (x,y)) or from (x,y-1) by a right move.\n\n          But the recurrence is: \n            ways(0,0) = 1\n            ways(x,y) = (ways(x-1,y) + ways(x,y-1))   [if we consider the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) with right and down moves]\n\n          However, note: the process is not moving one doll but splitting. Each doll at (x,y) will be split and then the two children will be at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). \n\n          Therefore, the number of dolls that ever are present at (x,y) is exactly the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) in a grid with moves: right and down? \n\n          But the moves are: \n            From (x,y) we produce (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). \n            So the path from (0,0) to (x,y) would require: \n              x down moves and y right moves? \n            But the order is: we start at (0,0). \n            To get to (x,y): we need exactly x down moves and y right moves? \n\n          The number of paths: C(x+y, x) or C(x+y, y).\n\n          However, the doll at (x,y) is produced by a unique sequence of splits. And the number of times the doll is at (x,y) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) with moves: \n            At each step, we can choose which doll to split? \n\n          But note: the process is deterministic in the sense that every doll is split exactly once? \n\n          Actually, the problem does not specify the order of operations. We are to find the minimum number of operations. \n\n          However, regardless of the order, the number of dolls that pass through (x,y) is fixed? \n\n          But the known solution uses: \n            For the boundary cell (i, a_i-1): we must have at least one operation that pushes a doll out of this cell? \n\n          Actually, the problem requires that at the end there are no dolls in white cells. \n\n          The cell (i, a_i-1) is white. So we must eventually have no doll there. \n\n          How many times has a doll been at (i, a_i-1)? \n\n          And then we must have an operation for each such doll? \n\n          But note: one operation at (i, a_i-1) will remove the doll and put two: one at (i, a_i) (which is black) and one at (i+1, a_i-1) (which might be white if a_{i+1} > a_i-1?).\n\n          However, the doll at (i+1, a_i-1) will then require further operations if it is in a white cell? \n\n          The minimum number of operations is exactly the number of times a doll is present in any white cell? \n\n          But wait: one operation removes one doll from a white cell and puts two dolls (which might be in white or black). \n\n          However, the total number of operations is the sum over all white cells of the number of dolls that ever were in that cell? \n\n          But note: one operation at a cell (x,y) (which is white) will remove one doll from that cell and then we get two in the next cells. \n\n          Therefore, the total number of operations is the sum over all white cells (x,y) of the number of dolls that were present at (x,y) at the moment of the operation? \n\n          And since we can choose the order, we can delay the operations arbitrarily, but the total number of times a doll is in a white cell is fixed? \n\n          Actually, the number of times a doll is in a white cell is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) for every white cell (x,y)? \n\n          Then the answer would be: \n            sum_{(x,y) is white} C(x+y, x)\n\n          But note: the grid is infinite. \n\n          However, the white cells are only for x from 0 to n and for y from 0 to a_x-1? and for x>n, a_x=0, so no white cells.\n\n          So we can compute:\n            ans = 0\n            for x in range(0, n+1):\n                for y in range(0, a_x):\n                    ans = (ans + C(x+y, x)) % mod\n\n          But the constraints: a_x up to 200000, and n up to 200000, and the inner loop over y from 0 to a_x-1: worst-case a_x=200000, and n=200000, then the total operations is sum_{x} a_x, which is about 200000*200000 = 40e9 -> too slow.\n\n        We need a faster method.\n\n        We can change the order of summation:\n\n            ans = sum_{x=0}^{n} sum_{y=0}^{a_x-1} C(x+y, x)\n\n          Note: \n            sum_{y=0}^{k-1} C(x+y, x) = C(x+k, x+1)   [by the hockey-stick identity]\n\n          Why? \n            Hockey-stick identity: \n              C(n, r) + C(n+1, r) + ... + C(n+k, r) = C(n+k+1, r+1) - C(n, r+1)\n            But here: \n              sum_{y=0}^{k-1} C(x+y, x) = C(x, x) + C(x+1, x) + ... + C(x+k-1, x)\n            = C(x,0) + C(x+1,1) + ...? \n\n          Actually, we have: \n            C(x, x) = 1\n            C(x+1, x) = C(x+1,1) = x+1\n            ...\n\n          The identity: \n            sum_{y=0}^{k-1} C(x+y, x) = C(x+k, x+1)\n\n          Proof by induction or combinatorial: \n            The number of ways to choose x+1 elements from a set of size x+k+1 is C(x+k, x+1) = C(x+k, k-1) ? \n            But note: \n              C(x+k, x+1) = C(x+k, k-1) -> not obviously.\n\n          Actually, known identity: \n            sum_{j=0}^{k} C(n+j, j) = C(n+k+1, k)\n            But here we have: \n              sum_{y=0}^{k-1} C(x+y, x) = sum_{y=x}^{x+k-1} C(y, x) = C(x+k, x+1)   [by the identity: column sum]\n\n          The identity: \n            sum_{y=x}^{m} C(y, x) = C(m+1, x+1)\n\n          Then: \n            sum_{y=x}^{x+k-1} C(y, x) = C(x+k, x+1) - C(x, x+1) = C(x+k, x+1)   [since C(x, x+1)=0]\n\n          But note: our sum is from y=0 to k-1: \n            When y=0: C(x+0, x) = C(x,x)=1 -> which corresponds to j=x in the identity? \n            Actually, we are summing y from 0 to k-1: \n              j = x+y, so j from x to x+k-1.\n\n          Therefore, \n            sum_{y=0}^{k-1} C(x+y, x) = C(x+k, x+1)\n\n          So we have:\n            ans = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1)\n\n          But note: the identity: \n            C(x+a_x, x+1) = C(x+a_x, a_x-1)   [since C(n,k)=C(n,n-k)]\n\n          However, the known solution uses: \n            ans = sum_{x=0}^{n} C(x+a_x, x+1)   [if a_x>0]\n\n          And if a_x==0, then we break because the rest are zeros.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n          We have built factorials up to 9**6 (which is 531441) and stored in list `f`.\n\n          We need a function to compute nCr mod m? \n\n          But note: the provided code does not have an inverse factorial. \n\n          We can compute: \n            C(n, r) = f[n] * inv(f[r]) * inv(f[n-r]) % m\n\n          But we don't have inv. \n\n          However, we can precompute the inverse factorials? \n\n          But the provided code does not do that. \n\n          Alternatively, we can compute the combination for a specific (x+a_x, x+1) using:\n\n          But note: the provided code only builds factorials up to 9**6, and we have f as the factorial list.\n\n          We need to compute the modular inverse. \n\n          We can use Fermat's little theorem: \n            inv(a) = pow(a, m-2, m)\n\n          But m=10**9+7.\n\n          However, the numbers we are inverting (f[r] and f[n-r]) can be up to 531441, which is acceptable.\n\n          But the provided code does not have that. \n\n          Alternatively, we can precompute the inverse factorials in the same loop? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and we are only to fill in the missing block.\n\n          The missing block is inside the loop:\n\n            for z in map(int,input().split()):# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are iterating over the sequence a0, a1, ... an.\n\n          We have:\n            n: the integer we read\n            x: initialized to 0 (but we don't know what it is for) \n            d: initialized to 0 (we will add to d the combination for each term)\n            m = 10**9+7\n            f: factorials for 0 to 9**6 (which is 531441)\n\n          The maximum value we need for combination: \n            nCr for n = x + a_x, and r = x+1. \n            x goes from 0 to n (which is 200000), and a_x up to 200000, so n = x+a_x <= 400000.\n\n          But 400000 < 531441, so we are safe.\n\n          Steps for the loop:\n\n            i = 0,1,...,n   (we are iterating over the sequence, so the first z is a0, then a1, ... an)\n\n            For each index i (starting at 0) and value z = a_i:\n\n              if z == 0: break   # because the rest will be 0\n\n              n_val = i + z\n              r_val = i+1\n\n              # But note: if n_val < r_val, then C(n_val, r_val)=0 -> skip.\n\n              Otherwise, compute:\n                 comb = f[n_val] * pow(f[r_val], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[n_val - r_val], m-2, m) % m\n\n              Then d = (d + comb) % m\n\n          However, the problem says: \"minimum number of operations\", and the known solution is the sum of these combinations.\n\n          But note: the example: \n            n=1, a0=2, a1=2? \n            Then we break at a1? because a1=2>0, so we do both.\n\n            For i=0: z=2 -> n_val=0+2=2, r_val=1 -> comb = C(2,1)=2.\n            For i=1: z=2 -> n_val=1+2=3, r_val=2 -> comb = C(3,2)=3.\n            Then d = 2+3 = 5 -> matches.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the loop in program2.py is:\n\n            i = 0\n            for z in map(int, input().split()):\n                if z == 0:\n                    break\n                total = i + z\n                r = i+1\n                if total < r:\n                    # but note: z>=0, i>=0, and r=i+1, so total = i+z >= i+0 = i, and r=i+1 -> so if z==0 then we break, so z>=1.

The variable `x` is initialized to 0 and not used. We can use `x` as the index? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use a separate index. \n\n          Let's use `x` as the index? \n\n          The code:\n\n            n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n            for i in range(1,9**6):f.append(f[-1]*i%m)\n            for z in map(int,input().split()):\n                if z==0:\n                    break\n                total = x + z\n                r = x+1\n                # Since total>=r (because z>=1, so total=x+z>=x+1=r), we compute:\n                comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\n                d = (d + comb) % m\n                x += 1\n\n          But note: the sequence has n+1 integers. We break when z==0, and then we stop.\n\n          This matches.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the exponentiation pow(f[r], m-2, m) is expensive? But m is 10**9+7, and we do it for at most 200000 iterations. \n\n        But 200000 * 2 exponentiations? Actually, we do two exponentiations per iteration. \n\n        The exponentiation with exponent m-2 (which is 10**9+5) is O(log(m)) which is about 30 steps. So 200000*30*2 = 12e6, which is acceptable in Pyton? \n\n        Alternatively, we can precompute the inverse factorials for all numbers up to 9**6? \n\n        But the problem does not require that, and we are only to fill the block.\n\n        We'll do the exponentiation.\n\n        But note: the modulus is m=10**9+7.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for z in map(int,input().split()):\n                if z == 0:\n                    break\n                total = x + z\n                r = x + 1\n                # Compute modular inverses for f[r] and f[total-r]\n                inv_r = pow(f[r], m-2, m)\n                inv_tr = pow(f[total - r], m-2, m)\n                comb = f[total] * inv_r % m\n                comb = comb * inv_tr % m\n                d = (d + comb) % m\n                x += 1\n\n        However, we can write it in fewer lines.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\n\n        But note: total can be up to 400000, and we built factorials up to 531441, so we are safe.\n\n        But what if total - r is negative? \n          No, because total = x+z, r = x+1, and z>=1 -> total>=x+1 = r, so total-r = z-1>=0.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            comb = f[total] * pow(f[r] * f[total - r] % m, m-2, m) % m   # but this is one exponentiation\n\n        However, the two exponentiations are acceptable.\n\n        We'll do two exponentiations.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the block for the loop.\n\n        However, the variable `x` is defined outside and we update it.\n\n        So the entire block for the loop is:\n\n            for z in map(int,input().split()):\n                if z == 0:\n                    break\n                total = x + z\n                r = x + 1\n                comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\n                d = (d + comb) % m\n                x += 1\n\n        But note: the initial value of x is 0.\n\n        This matches.\n\n  Summary:\n\n    program1.py missing block:\n        for _ in range(q):\n            x, y = R()\n            print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n    program2.py missing block:\n        for z in map(int,input().split()):\n            if z == 0:\n                break\n            total = x + z\n            r = x + 1\n            comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\n            d = (d + comb) % m\n            x += 1\n\n  But note: the problem says to output in JSON format:\n\n        {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n    where \"completion\" is the string of the missing code.\n\n  We must be cautious: the missing code for program1.py is the for-loop body, and for program2.py is the for-loop body.\n\n  However, for program1.py, the existing code has:\n\n        for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We are to replace the TODO with:\n\n          x, y = R()\n          print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n  But note: the existing code uses R() to read integers.\n\n  For program2.py, the existing code has:\n\n        for z in map(int,input().split()):# TODO: Your code here\n\n    We are to replace the TODO with the block.\n\n  However, the program2.py loop body is multiple lines.\n\n  We output the string exactly as it would appear in the code.\n\n  But note: the program2.py code has a comment at the end of the for-loop line. We remove the comment and put the block.\n\n  Actually, the existing line in program2.py is:\n\n        for z in map(int,input().split()):# TODO: Your code here\n\n    We replace the entire line from the for to the colon, and then put the block? \n\n    But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\"\n\n    We are to fill the block for the for-loop.\n\n    So for program2.py, we output the block that is the body of the for-loop.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n    program1: \n        \"x, y = R()\\n        print(p[x] - p[x-y])\"\n\n    program2:\n        \"    if z == 0:\\n        break\\n    total = x + z\\n    r = x + 1\\n    comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\\n    d = (d + comb) % m\\n    x += 1\"\n\n  But note: the indentation. In program1, the for-loop body is indented by 4 spaces? The existing code uses 4 spaces.\n\n  In program2, the for-loop body should be indented by 4 spaces. We provide 4 spaces for each line.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the surrounding.\n\n  Since the existing program1 has:\n\n        for _ in range(q):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n    We use 4 spaces for the two lines.\n\n  For program2, the existing for-loop is at the same level as the previous for-loop (which uses 4 spaces). So the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n  But the problem does not specify. However, the initial code for program2 has:\n\n        n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n        for i in range(1,9**6):f.append(f[-1]*i%m)\n        for z in map(int,input().split()):# TODO: Your code here\n\n    The for-loop is at the same level (no extra indent). The body we are going to write should be indented.\n\n  We'll use 4 spaces for each level.\n\n  Therefore, the body of the for-loop in program2 should be indented by 4 spaces.\n\n  But the provided code in program2 has the for-loop on the same line as the comment. We replace the comment with the block, and the block should be indented.\n\n  So the block for program2 is:\n\n        if z == 0:\n            break\n        total = x + z\n        r = x + 1\n        comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\n        d = (d + comb) % m\n        x += 1\n\n  But note: the first line of the block is after the colon. We can write:\n\n        for z in map(int,input().split()):\n            if z == 0:\n                break\n            ... \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that goes in the TODO part.\n\n  In program2, the TODO is the body of the for-loop. So we output the body (with 4 spaces of indentation).\n\n  But the existing for-loop line is already there. We only output the body.\n\n  Therefore, for program2, the missing block is the body (with 4-space indentation).\n\n  We write:\n\n        \"    if z == 0:\\n        break\\n    total = x + z\\n    r = x + 1\\n    comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\\n    d = (d + comb) % m\\n    x += 1\"\n\n  But the first line of the body: we have to indent one level (4 spaces) for the entire block. \n\n  However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the block is the entire body.\n\n  We output the block as a string that would be inserted at the TODO.\n\n  Since the TODO is at the end of the for-loop line, we need to start a new line and then the body.\n\n  The body should be:\n\n        if z == 0:\n            break\n        total = x + z\n        r = x + 1\n        comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\n        d = (d + comb) % m\n        x += 1\n\n  And each line is indented by 4 spaces relative to the for-loop.\n\n  So the string for program2 is:\n\n        \"    if z == 0:\\n        break\\n    total = x + z\\n    r = x + 1\\n    comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\\n    d = (d + comb) % m\\n    x += 1\"\n\n  But the break should be indented one more level? \n\n  Actually, the body of the if should be indented. \n\n  We write:\n\n        if z == 0:\n            break\n\n  So the break is indented by 8 spaces? \n\n  But the problem: the entire block is at the same level of the for-loop body. \n\n  We'll use:\n\n        Line1: 4 spaces + \"if z == 0:\"\n        Line2: 8 spaces + \"break\"\n        Line3: 4 spaces + \"total = ...\"\n\n  But that is not standard. \n\n  Alternatively, we can write without extra indentation for the break? \n\n  But in Python, we must.\n\n  Therefore, the exact string for program2:\n\n        \"    if z == 0:\\n        break\\n    total = x + z\\n    r = x + 1\\n    comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\\n    d = (d + comb) % m\\n    x += 1\"\n\n  This means:\n\n        Line1: 4 spaces + \"if z == 0:\"\n        Line2: 8 spaces + \"break\"\n        Line3: 4 spaces + \"total = ...\"\n\n  But note: after the break, we have to unindent. \n\n  However, the next line is at 4 spaces, which is the same level as the if.\n\n  But the if block is only the break. Then we have an else? no, we break out of the loop.\n\n  Actually, if we break, we don't do the rest. \n\n  But the code after the break is not in the if. \n\n  We want:\n\n        if z==0: break   -> then we break and do not update x.\n\n        Otherwise, do the rest.\n\n  So the code:\n\n        if z == 0:\n            break\n        ... the rest ...\n\n  Therefore, the break is one statement in the if, and the rest is after the if.\n\n  So the indentation:\n\n        for z in ...:\n            if z==0:\n                break\n            total = ...\n            ...\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  We output the string as:\n\n        program1: \"x, y = R()\\n    print(p[x] - p[x-y])\"\n\n        But wait, the existing for-loop in program1 has 4 spaces of indentation, and the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the existing code:\n\n            for _ in range(q):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The first line of the for-loop is indented 4 spaces, and the comment is 6 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. We'll use 4 spaces for the body.\n\n        However, the initial code uses 4 spaces for the for-loop and then the comment is 4 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the code:\n\n            for _ in range(q):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The # is at 6 spaces? \n\n        But we are replacing the comment with two lines. We'll use 4 spaces for the two lines of the body.\n\n        So:\n\n            for _ in range(q):\n                x, y = R()\n                print(p[x] - p[x-y])\n\n        Therefore, the string for program1: \n            \"    x, y = R()\\n    print(p[x] - p[x-y])\"\n\n        But note: the first line of the body is 4 spaces, and the second is 4 spaces.\n\n  Final JSON:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"    x, y = R()\\n    print(p[x] - p[x-y])\",\n          \"program2\": \"    if z == 0:\\n        break\\n    total = x + z\\n    r = x + 1\\n    comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\\n    d = (d + comb) % m\\n    x += 1\"\n        }\n\n  But note: the program2 block has a line that is long. We can break it? \n\n  Alternatively, we can write the comb computation in two lines? \n\n  But the problem does not require pretty printing.\n\n  We output the string as is.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code without any extra formatting.\n\n  We write the JSON string.\n\n  Important: the backslashes must be escaped in JSON.\n\n  We'll use raw string or escape.\n\n  But we are writing a JSON string.\n\n  We do:\n\n        \"program1\": \"    x, y = R()\\n    print(p[x] - p[x-y])\",\n        \"program2\": \"    if z == 0:\\n        break\\n    total = x + z\\n    r = x + 1\\n    comb = f[total] * pow(f[r], m-2, m) % m * pow(f[total - r], m-2, m) % m\\n    d = (d + comb) % m\\n    x += 1\"\n\n  But the comb line is long. We leave it as one line.\n\n  This is the answer."
