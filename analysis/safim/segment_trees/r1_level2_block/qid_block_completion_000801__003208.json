The standard way:\n\n  S[i][j] = C[i][j] + S[i-1][j] + S[i][j-1] - S[i-1][j-1]\n\nBut the code does:\n\n  if i>0 and j>0:\n      S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n  elif i>0: \n      # TODO: Your code here\n  elif j>0:\n      S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\nActually, the initial S[i][j] is set to the input value. Then we are adding the prefix parts. For the first row (i=0) and j>0: we do S[0][j] += S[0][j-1] -> that is the prefix for the first row. For the first column (j=0) and i>0: we have an elif i>0 and j==0 -> we need to do: S[i][0] += S[i-1][0] (the element above). But the code currently has a TODO. So we should change the TODO part to:\n    S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\nBut note: the condition is \"elif i>0\", meaning j must be 0 (because if j>0 we did the first condition). So:\n\n  if i>0 and j>0: \n      S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n  elif i>0:   # then j==0\n      S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n  elif j>0:   # then i==0 and j>0\n      S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\nThat completes the prefix. However, note that the problem says: the total sum of n over test cases <= 200000. But n is the number of candies per test case, and the matrix is n x n. 200000 is the total n for all test cases, so each test case n can be up to 200, and the total n (across test cases) is 200000. But note: the matrix has n^2 elements. However, the constraint says the sum of n (the sizes) is <=200000. But wait: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So the total number of candies in all test cases is <=200000. Therefore, we can have at most 200000/1 = 200000 test cases? But n>=1, so maximum 200000 test cases? That doesn't make sense because t<=10000.",

So the intended solution is to use the O(n^3) DP for each test case, but only when n is small (<=200, because 200^3 = 8e6, and 10000 test cases with n=20: 20^3=8000, and 10000*8000=80e6, which is acceptable).

So the missing code is:\n\n   We replace the first line (n = ...) with:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n\n   and then in the prefix sum part, replace the TODO with:\n\n            S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\nBut note: the rest of the code (the DP and labeling) must be inside the loop. So the entire code after the first line is inside the loop. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the following string:\n\n   \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j, c_val in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\\n            S[i][j] = c_val\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j in range(n):\\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\\n            elif i > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\\n            elif j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n\nBut wait, the initial code already has the loop for reading the matrix:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\n            S[i][j] = c\n\nSo we don't need to change that. But the initial code then has the prefix sum loop:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n            elif i > 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            elif j > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] We only need to change the TODO line to: \"S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\"\n\nAnd then wrap the entire code after reading t in a loop. So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n   We add an outer loop and fix the one line. But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the fixed line and the outer loop.",

We did a simpler one. But the initial code does:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n      for j in range(n): if i>0 and j>0:\n              S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n          elif i>0:\n              # TODO: \n          elif j>0:\n              ... We fixed the TODO to: S[i][j] += S[i-1][j] for the case i>0 and j==0. But in our new code, we did:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            S[i][j] = c[i][j] if i>0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n            if j>0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n            if i>0 and j>0:\n                S[i][j] -= S[i-1][j-1]\n\nThis is the standard way and is equivalent. But note: the initial code's prefix sum might be different? Let's check for (0,0): In the initial code: \n        if i>0 and j>0: no -> then if i>0: no -> then if j>0: no -> so S[0][0] remains c[0][0] In our code: we do if i>0: no, if j>0: no, if i>0 and j>0: no -> so S[0][0]=c[0][0]\n\nFor (0,1): \n   Initial: j>0 -> S[0][1] += S[0][0] -> becomes c[0][1] + c[0][0] Our: we do j>0: add S[0][0] -> c[0][1] + c[0][0] -> same. For (1,0):\n   Initial: i>0 -> then in the elif i>0: S[1][0] += S[0][0] -> c[1][0] + c[0][0] Our: i>0 -> add S[0][0] -> c[1][0] + c[0][0] -> same. For (1,1):\n   Initial: i>0 and j>0: S[1][1] += S[1][0] + S[0][1] - S[0][0] \n        = c[1][1] + (c[1][0]+c[0][0]) + (c[0][1]+c[0][0]) - c[0][0] \n        = c[1][1] + c[1][0] + c[0][1] + c[0][0]\n   Our: c[1][1] + (c[0][0]+c[0][1]+c[1][0]) [from the row and column additions] and then subtract c[0][0] -> \n        = c[1][1] + c[0][0] + c[0][1] + c[1][0] - c[0][0] = same.

But Knuth's optimization is for the case when the cost is the expected search time (with weights on the nodes) and it is 1D. Here the cost is pairwise. Alternatively, we can use the following: the total cost is the same as the cost of the tree for the following: \n\n   total_cost = sum_{i} depth(i) * (row_i + col_i)\n\nwhere row_i = sum_{j} c_ij, and col_i = sum_{j} c_ij? But that would be 2 * sum_{j} c_ij. But then the cost is not capturing the pairwise distances properly. Actually, we have:\n\n   total_cost = sum_{i<j} c_ij * (depth(i) + depth(j) - 2 * depth(LCA(i,j))) = (sum_i depth(i) * (sum_{j} c_ij)) - 2 * sum_{i<j} c_ij * depth(LCA(i,j)) But the first term is linear in the depths.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given the number of test cases, but note: the input specification says the first line is t (number of test cases). However, the code reads n as the first integer and then the matrix of size n x n.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"The first line contains an integer t\", but the code reads n = int(input().strip()) and then the matrix. This suggests that the provided code is for one test case? However, the problem says there are t test cases.\n\nLooking at the code: \n  n = int(input().strip())\n  then reads n lines of n integers.\n\nBut the problem says: first line t, then for each test case: first line n, then a line of n integers.\n\nSo the provided code is incomplete because it does not handle t test cases.\n\nHowever, the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", meaning we can process each test case in a loop.\n\nBut the provided code does not have a loop for t. So we must fix that.\n\nAlso, the 2D prefix sum part: the code is building a 2D prefix sum array S. However, the way it is built is:\n\n  for i in range(n):\n      for j in range(n):\n          if i>0 and j>0: ... \n          elif i>0: ... (this part is missing, we have a TODO)\n          elif j>0: ...\n\nWe need to complete the prefix sum.\n\nBut note: the problem says the matrix is symmetric and has zeros on the diagonal.\n\nThe prefix sum S is built from the input matrix (which we'll call C). We want S[i][j] to be the sum of all elements in the rectangle from (0,0) to (i,j). The standard way:\n\n  S[i][j] = C[i][j] + S[i-1][j] + S[i][j-1] - S[i-1][j-1]\n\nBut the code does:\n\n  if i>0 and j>0:\n      S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n  elif i>0: \n      # TODO: Your code here\n  elif j>0:\n      S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\nActually, the initial S[i][j] is set to the input value. Then we are adding the prefix parts.\n\nFor the first row (i=0) and j>0: we do S[0][j] += S[0][j-1] -> that is the prefix for the first row.\n\nFor the first column (j=0) and i>0: we have an elif i>0 and j==0 -> we need to do: S[i][0] += S[i-1][0] (the element above). But the code currently has a TODO.\n\nSo we should change the TODO part to:\n    S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\nBut note: the condition is \"elif i>0\", meaning j must be 0 (because if j>0 we did the first condition). So:\n\n  if i>0 and j>0: \n      S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n  elif i>0:   # then j==0\n      S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n  elif j>0:   # then i==0 and j>0\n      S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\nThat completes the prefix.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: the total sum of n over test cases <= 200000. But n is the number of candies per test case, and the matrix is n x n. 200000 is the total n for all test cases, so each test case n can be up to 200, and the total n (across test cases) is 200000. But note: the matrix has n^2 elements. However, the constraint says the sum of n (the sizes) is <=200000. But wait: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So the total number of candies in all test cases is <=200000. Therefore, we can have at most 200000/1 = 200000 test cases? But n>=1, so maximum 200000 test cases? That doesn't make sense because t<=10000. Actually, the constraint on the sum of n is 200000, so the maximum n per test case can be 200000? But the problem says n<=200000 and the total n over test cases <=200000, meaning there is at most 1 test case? \n\nWait: the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So the total number of candies (the n for each test case summed over t test cases) is <=200000. Therefore, we can have multiple test cases, but the sum of the sizes (n) is bounded.\n\nBut the matrix is n x n. For one test case with n=200000, the matrix would have 40e9 elements, which is too big.\n\nWe must read the problem again: the input for each test case has n and then a list of n integers? Actually, no: the second line of the test case contains n integers? But wait, the problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\". But then what is the matrix? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"The next n lines contain n integers each, j-th number in i-th line is c_ij\". \n\nSo the input for one test case is:\n  n\n  then n lines, each with n integers.\n\nBut the constraint: the sum of n over all test cases <= 200000. This n is the number of candies. However, the matrix has n^2 elements. For n=200000, that's 40e9 integers, which is 40e9 * 4 bytes = 160 GB, which is too much.\n\nBut note: the constraint says \"the sum of n over all test cases\" is <=200000. So the total n (the sizes of the test cases) is 200000. Therefore, the largest test case can be n=200000, but then there is only one test case. Or there could be many test cases with small n.\n\nBut 200000 is the total n, so the maximum n in one test case is 200000, and there is only one test case. However, the problem says t (the number of test cases) is at least 1 and at most 10000. But the sum of n<=200000, so the maximum t is 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the average n is 20. So we can have up to 10000 test cases, but the total n is 200000, so the average n is 20.\n\nTherefore, we can process each test case independently and the matrix for one test case is n x n, but n is at most 200000? Actually, no: the total n over test cases is 200000, so the maximum n in one test case could be 200000? But then the matrix would be 200000x200000 which is 40e9 elements, which is too big.\n\nThis suggests that we must use a different approach. The provided code uses a 2D prefix sum and a DP that is O(n^3). But note the constraint: the total n over test cases is 200000, but that doesn't mean we can have one test case with n=200000? Actually, the constraint says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So the total n (the sum of the n's) is 200000. Therefore, the largest test case has n at most 200000, but the total n (for all test cases) is 200000, so there is only one test case? Because if the first test case has n=200000, then the sum is 200000 and we cannot have more. Or we can have two test cases: one with 100000 and one with 100000? But 100000*100000 = 10e9 for one matrix, which is 10e9*2 (for two) = 20e9 integers, which is 80 GB? That is too much.\n\nSo we must reconsider: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases\" meaning the sum of the values of n (the number of candies) for each test case. But the matrix for one test case has n^2 integers. How can we avoid storing the entire matrix?\n\nLooking at the provided code: it builds a 2D prefix sum S. But note: the problem says the matrix c is symmetric and has zeros on the diagonal. However, the DP recurrence in the code uses a function `acc(i1, i2, j1, j2)` which returns the sum of the submatrix from (i1, j1) to (i2-1, j2-1). \n\nBut the recurrence in the DP:\n\n  s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\n  s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n\nThis seems to be breaking the problem into two parts: [b, i) and [i+1, e). And then adding some costs.\n\nBut note: the problem is about building a binary search tree (BST) from the sequence of candies (which are numbered from left to right). The condition is that the tree must be a BST with the left subtree having smaller indices and the right having larger. This is exactly a Cartesian tree (or a BST built from a sorted key). The problem is known as the Optimal BST problem? But note: the cost is not the frequency of accessing a node but the communication cost between every pair.\n\nActually, the problem is known as the \"Optimal BST\" but with a cost that involves all pairs? \n\nAlternatively, note that the cost for a pair (i, j) is c_ij multiplied by the distance in the tree. The distance in the tree is the depth of i plus the depth of j minus twice the depth of the LCA. But the problem is symmetric.\n\nHowever, the provided code uses a DP that splits at a root and then adds the cost of the left and right subtrees and then adds some terms that come from the cross terms.\n\nBut the recurrence:\n\n  s += acc(0, b, b, i)   -> this is the sum of the submatrix from row0 to row b-1 and column b to i-1? \n  and acc(b, i, i, n)   -> submatrix from row b to i-1 and column i to n-1?\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the known solution for this problem: it is called the \"Garsia-Wachs\" algorithm? But note the constraints: n up to 200000? But the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can have one test case with n=200000. However, the known optimal BST with arbitrary cost for pairs is not standard.\n\nBut note: the problem has been studied: it is the problem of building a binary tree that minimizes the total communication cost for a given symmetric cost matrix? \n\nActually, the problem is known as the \"minimum cost of a binary search tree for the given pairwise costs\". There is a known O(n^3) DP. But with n up to 200000, we cannot do O(n^3). \n\nHowever, the constraint says the total n over test cases is 200000, but that total n is the sum of the n's. And the note says: the total n over all test cases does not exceed 200000. So the maximum n in a test case is 200000, but the total n (the sum of the sizes) is 200000. Therefore, there is only one test case? Because 200000 is the total n, so if one test case has n=200000, then we have only one test case. But the problem says t (the number of test cases) is at least 1 and at most 10000. So we can have up to 10000 test cases, but the sum of the n's is 200000, so the average n is 20. Therefore, we can have 10000 test cases each with n=20? Then the matrix for one test case is 20x20 = 400 integers, and 10000 test cases would be 10000*400 = 4e6 integers, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the problem is: we have multiple test cases, each with n (the number of candies) and an n x n matrix. The total n (the sum of the n's for all test cases) is <=200000. Therefore, the maximum n per test case is 200000, but the total n (across test cases) is 200000, so the maximum number of test cases is 10000, but the largest test case has n=200000 and then the rest must be 0? Actually, no: the sum of the n's is 200000. So if we have one test case with n=200000, then we have one test case. If we have two test cases, then n1+n2<=200000. \n\nBut note: the input says the first line is t, then for each test case: first line n, then n lines of n integers. The total n (the sum of the n's) is <=200000. However, the total number of integers we read is: \n  t (one integer) \n  then for each test case: \n        n (one integer)\n        then n lines, each with n integers -> total integers for one test case: 1 + n*n.\n\nBut the constraint says the sum of n (the n for each test case) is <=200000. So the total integers we read is: \n   t (<=10000) \n   plus for each test case: 1 (for n) + n*n.\n\nThe total n (the sum of the n_i) is 200000. But the total integers for the matrices is sum_i (n_i * n_i). This can be as large as 200000 * 200000 = 40e9 if one test case has n_i=200000, which is too big.\n\nBut wait: the constraint says \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". This means the sum of the values of n (the sizes) is 200000. However, the matrix for a test case of size n has n^2 integers. So the total integers we read is: \n   t (<=10000) \n   plus for each test case: 1 (for n) and then n^2 integers.\n\nThe total integers from the matrices is sum_{test cases} (n_i^2). \n\nThe worst-case: if we have one test case with n=200000, then n^2 = 40000000000, which is 40e9 integers, which is 40e9 * 4 bytes = 160 GB, which is too much.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". This is the sum of the n_i, not the sum of squares. So we must avoid storing the entire matrix for large n.\n\nTherefore, we must use a different approach that does not require storing the entire matrix. \n\nLooking at the recurrence in the provided code: it uses a 2D prefix sum. But if we cannot store the entire matrix, we cannot build the prefix sum.\n\nBut note: the problem says the matrix is symmetric and has zeros on the diagonal. Also, the cost for a pair (i,j) is symmetric. The total cost is the sum over all pairs (i<j) of c_ij * d_ij.\n\nIn the tree, the distance d_ij is the number of edges between i and j. This can be expressed as: \n   d_ij = depth(i) + depth(j) - 2 * depth(LCA(i,j))\n\nBut note: the tree is a BST. The LCA of i and j is the root of the subtree that contains both i and j. In a BST, the LCA of i and j is the node with the smallest index that lies between i and j? Actually, the LCA is the node with key that is between i and j? But the keys are the indices? The problem says: the candies are numbered from left to right. And the tree must satisfy: for a node v, the left subtree has indices < v and the right subtree has indices > v. So the BST is built on the sorted keys 1,2,...,n.\n\nTherefore, the LCA of i and j is the first node that lies between i and j? Actually, the LCA is the node with the smallest key that is between i and j? But the tree is built arbitrarily as long as the BST property holds. However, we are free to choose the root arbitrarily? The problem says: \"some member will be selected as a leader\" (the root) and then the tree must be a BST.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require the tree to be balanced. We are to minimize the total cost.\n\nThis problem is known as the \"Optimal Binary Search Tree\" for the case when the cost is defined by a matrix of pairwise communication costs? \n\nThere is a known O(n^3) dynamic programming solution for a similar problem (with weights on the nodes and frequencies for access) but here the cost is for every pair.\n\nHowever, there is a known result: when the cost matrix is a symmetric matrix and the cost for a pair is the distance in the tree multiplied by c_ij, then the total cost can be expressed as:\n\n   total_cost = sum_{i} depth(i) * (c_i_left + c_i_right) \n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem to capture the pairwise cost.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following:\n\n   total_cost = sum_{i<j} c_ij * d_ij = sum_{i} depth(i) * (sum_{j} c_ij) - 2 * sum_{k} depth(k) * (sum_{i,j in the subtree rooted at k} c_ij) \n\nBut that might not be linear in depth.\n\nActually, we can use the following: the distance d_ij is the sum of the edge weights along the path. But the tree is unweighted? The problem does not say the edges have weights, so each edge has weight 1. Then the distance is the number of edges.\n\nThe total cost can be written as:\n\n   total_cost = sum_{edges} (number of pairs (i,j) whose path goes through this edge) * (c_ij)\n\nBut note: the path from i to j goes through an edge e if and only if the edge e is on the path from i to j. And the entire path from i to j is the union of edges from i to LCA and from LCA to j.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following recurrence:\n\n   Let F(l, r) = the minimum total cost for the subtree containing the candies in the sorted order from l to r.\n\n   We choose a root k in [l, r]. Then the cost contributed by the root is: \n        cost_root = (sum_{i=l}^{k-1} sum_{j=k+1}^{r} c_ij)   [because the path from any i in [l,k-1] to any j in [k+1, r] must pass through the root? Actually, the path from i to j will go from i to k and then k to j? But note: the tree is a BST: the root k is the LCA of i and j if i<k<j. So the path from i to j goes through k and then goes to the left and right. But the entire path from i to j will use the edge from k to its left child and the edge from k to its right child? Actually, the path from i to j goes from i up to k and then down to j. The number of edges is (depth(i) - depth(k)) + (depth(j) - depth(k)) = depth(i)+depth(j)-2*depth(k). But in the recurrence, we are building the tree recursively. \n\nHowever, the recurrence in the provided code is:\n\n   s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\n   s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n\nThis is not standard.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following known recurrence for the optimal BST with arbitrary pairwise costs:\n\n   F(i, j) = min_{i<=k<=j} { F(i, k-1) + F(k+1, j) + cost(i, j, k) }\n\nwhere cost(i, j, k) = (sum_{a=i}^{k-1} sum_{b=k+1}^{j} c_ab)   [because for every pair (a,b) with a in [i,k-1] and b in [k+1, j], the path from a to b goes through the root k, and this adds 2 to the path length (because a->k and k->b, but wait: the entire path from a to b is not just these two edges, it goes from a to k and then k to b, but the edges from a to k are not just one edge, it's the entire path. However, in the recurrence, we are only accounting for the cost at the current split.\n\nActually, the recurrence in the literature for this problem (minimizing the total communication cost for pairwise requests in a BST) is:\n\n   F(i, j) = min_{i<=k<=j} { F(i, k-1) + F(k+1, j) } + W(i, j)\n\nwhere W(i, j) = sum_{a=i}^{j} sum_{b=i}^{j} c_ab   [but wait, that would count pairs within the same subtree?]\n\nBut note: the cost for a pair (a,b) is added every time we are in a node that is on the path from a to b. Specifically, the cost c_ab is added for every edge on the path from a to b. And there are d_ij edges, so the total cost is the sum over edges of the total c_ab that go through that edge.\n\nThis is the standard \"quadrangle\" and then the recurrence is the same as the one for the \"Optimal Search Tree\" with weights on the leaves and internal nodes? \n\nActually, there is a well-known result: when the cost is the sum over all pairs of the distance times the weight, then the cost of a tree is:\n\n   cost(tree) = sum_{edge} (total weight of pairs that go through the edge)\n\nBut the total weight of pairs that go through the edge (u,v) (where v is a child of u) is the total weight of pairs that have one endpoint in the subtree of v and the other outside the subtree of v.\n\nSo if we let W(i, j) = total weight of all pairs that have at least one endpoint in [i, j]? Actually, no: for a split at k, the cost of the edge from k to its left child would be the total weight of pairs that have one endpoint in [i, k-1] and the other in [k+1, j] or outside [i,j]? \n\nBut in the recurrence, when we are building the tree for [i, j] and choose root k, then the cost of the edges from k to the left and right subtrees will be incurred for every pair that has one endpoint in the left subtree and the other in the right subtree, and also for every pair that has one endpoint in the left subtree and outside the entire [i,j] and similarly for the right? \n\nThe recurrence in the provided code seems to be:\n\n   cost = acc(0, b, b, i)   # pairs with rows in [0, b-1] and columns in [b, i-1] -> this is pairs that have one candy in [0, b-1] and one in [b, i-1] (which is the left subtree we are about to build)\n   + acc(b, i, i, n)        # pairs with rows in [b, i-1] and columns in [i, n-1] -> pairs with one in the left subtree and one in the right subtree of the root? or one in the left subtree and one in the right part (which is not in the current subtree) \n   + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e)    # pairs with rows in [0, i] and columns in [i+1, e-1] -> this might be pairs with one outside and one in the right subtree?\n   + acc(i+1, e, e, n)      # pairs with rows in [i+1, e-1] and columns in [e, n-1] -> ?\n\nThis is not clear.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the total n over test cases is 200000 (which implies that the largest n is 200000 and there is only one test case, but then the matrix is too big), and the provided code uses a 2D prefix sum and an O(n^3) DP, which is not feasible for n=200000, we must conclude that the provided code is not efficient enough.\n\nHowever, the constraint on the total n over test cases is 200000, and the maximum n per test case might be small because the sum is 200000. For example, if we have 10000 test cases, then the average n is 20, and an O(n^3) per test case would be 8000 per test case, and 10000 * 8000 = 80e6, which is acceptable in Pyton.\n\nSo the intended solution is to use the O(n^3) DP for each test case, but only when n is small (<=200, because 200^3 = 8e6, and 10000 test cases with n=20: 20^3=8000, and 10000*8000=80e6, which is acceptable).\n\nBut note: the total n over test cases is 200000, and if we have many test cases with n=20, then the number of test cases is 200000/20 = 10000. And 10000 * (20^3) = 10000 * 8000 = 80e6 operations, which is acceptable in Python.\n\nTherefore, we can use the provided DP for each test case.\n\nBut the provided code does not have a loop for test cases. We must add it.\n\nAlso, the TODO in the prefix sum: for the case i>0 and j==0, we should do:\n\n   S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\nSo we change the TODO part to:\n\n   S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\nBut note: the initial S[i][j] is the value from input. Then we are building the prefix sum.\n\nHowever, the provided code for the DP and the function `acc` might be incorrect. Let me try to understand the recurrence.\n\nThe recurrence in the code:\n\n   s = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e)\n   s += acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n\nWhat do these terms represent?\n\nLet me denote the current segment as [b, e) (candies from index b to e-1). We are choosing a root at index i (which is in [b, e)). The left subtree will be [b, i) and the right subtree [i+1, e).\n\nThe cost added is:\n\n   acc(0, b, b, i): \n        rows: [0, b-1] and columns: [b, i-1] -> pairs that have one candy in [0, b-1] and one in [b, i-1] (which is the left subtree)\n\n   acc(b, i, i, n): \n        rows: [b, i-1] and columns: [i, n-1] -> pairs that have one in the left subtree [b, i-1] and one in [i, n-1] (which includes the root i and the right subtree and also candies to the right of e)\n\n   acc(0, i+1, i+1, e): \n        rows: [0, i] and columns: [i+1, e-1] -> pairs that have one in [0, i] (which includes the left subtree and the root) and one in the right subtree [i+1, e-1]\n\n   acc(i+1, e, e, n): \n        rows: [i+1, e-1] and columns: [e, n-1] -> pairs that have one in the right subtree and one in [e, n-1] (which is outside the current segment)\n\nBut note: the cost for a pair (x,y) should be counted when the path between x and y goes through the root of the current subtree? Actually, the cost for a pair (x,y) is the distance in the tree. The distance will be increased by 2 for every such split that separates x and y? Specifically, when we add an edge from the root to the left child, then every pair that has x in the left subtree and y outside the left subtree (which includes the right subtree and the rest of the tree) will have to use that edge. Similarly for the right child.\n\nBut the recurrence in the code seems to be counting specific rectangular regions.\n\nAlternatively, the cost added might be the cost incurred by the new edges we are creating: the edge from the root to the left child and the edge from the root to the right child. The cost for an edge is the total weight of pairs that have one endpoint in the subtree below that edge and the other endpoint outside that subtree.\n\nFor the left child (which covers [b, i-1]), the cost for the edge (root->left) is the total weight of pairs that have one endpoint in [b, i-1] and the other outside [b, i-1]. But the outside includes [0, b-1] and [i, n-1]. Similarly for the right child.\n\nHowever, the recurrence in the code does not seem to match. It might be that the author intended to count:\n\n   For the left child: \n        cost_left = (pairs with one in [b, i-1] and one in [0, b-1]) + (pairs with one in [b, i-1] and one in [i, n-1])\n   For the right child:\n        cost_right = (pairs with one in [i+1, e-1] and one in [0, i]) + (pairs with one in [i+1, e-1] and one in [e, n-1])\n\nBut note: the current subtree is [b, e-1], so the outside is [0, b-1] and [e, n-1]. The inside is [b, e-1]. The left child covers [b, i-1] and the right child covers [i+1, e-1]. The root is i.\n\nThe cost for the edge to the left child: \n   = (pairs with one in [b, i-1] and one in [0, b-1]) \n     + (pairs with one in [b, i-1] and one in [i, e-1])   [but note: the root i is in the current subtree and is not in the left child, so this includes the root and the right subtree] \n     + (pairs with one in [b, i-1] and one in [e, n-1])\n\nBut the code has:\n\n   acc(0, b, b, i) -> [0, b-1] x [b, i-1] -> matches the first part.\n   acc(b, i, i, n) -> [b, i-1] x [i, n-1] -> this includes [b, i-1] x [i, e-1] and [b, i-1] x [e, n-1] -> matches the second and third.\n\nSimilarly, for the right child:\n   cost for the edge to the right child = \n        (pairs with one in [i+1, e-1] and one in [0, i])   [which includes [0, b-1] and [b, i] (the left subtree and the root)] \n        + (pairs with one in [i+1, e-1] and one in [e, n-1])\n\nThe code has:\n   acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) -> [0, i] x [i+1, e-1] -> this includes [0, b-1] x [i+1, e-1] and [b, i] x [i+1, e-1] -> but note [b, i] includes the root i and the left subtree [b, i-1]. This matches the first part for the right child? But it also includes the root i? The root i is not in the right subtree, so pairs between the root and the right subtree should be counted? Actually, the path from the root to the right child is one edge, and that edge will be used by any pair that has the root and a node in the right subtree? But the root is not in the left child, so it should be counted for the right child edge? \n\nBut note: the pair (i, j) for j in the right subtree: the path from i to j uses the edge from i to the right child. So it should be counted in the cost for the right child edge.\n\nSimilarly, the pair (x, j) for x in the left subtree and j in the right subtree: the path from x to j goes through the root i and then uses the edge to the right child? Actually, it goes from x to i (using the left child edge of the root) and then from i to j (using the right child edge). So the edge from i to the right child is used by any pair that has one endpoint in the right subtree and the other endpoint not in the right subtree (which includes the left subtree and the root and the outside). But the cost for the edge to the right child is the total weight of pairs that have one in the right subtree and the other not in the right subtree.\n\nSo the cost for the right child edge = \n   = (pairs with one in [i+1, e-1] and one in [0, i])   [which is the entire left part including the root] \n   + (pairs with one in [i+1, e-1] and one in [e, n-1])\n\nThe code has:\n   acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) -> [0, i] x [i+1, e-1] -> this is the first part.\n   acc(i+1, e, e, n) -> [i+1, e-1] x [e, n-1] -> this is the second part.\n\nSo the recurrence seems to be:\n\n   cost = cost_left + cost_right \n        = [ acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) ]   // for the left child edge\n          + [ acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n) ]   // for the right child edge\n\nBut note: the pair (x,y) with x in [b, i-1] and y in [i+1, e-1] is counted in both cost_left and cost_right? \n   In cost_left: it is in [b, i-1] x [i, n-1] -> includes [b, i-1] x [i+1, e-1] because i+1 to e-1 is within [i, n-1] (if e-1>=i+1).\n   In cost_right: it is in [0, i] x [i+1, e-1] -> includes [b, i-1] x [i+1, e-1] because [b, i-1] is within [0, i].\n\nSo it is counted twice? \n\nBut the path for such a pair (x,y) goes through both the left child edge and the right child edge? So it should be counted twice? Yes, because the path from x to y goes from x up to the root (using the left child edge) and then down to y (using the right child edge). So both edges are used. Therefore, the cost for the pair (x,y) is 2, and we are adding 2 * c_xy. But in the recurrence, we are adding c_xy in cost_left and c_xy in cost_right, so total 2*c_xy. That is correct.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence is correct.\n\nBut note: the function `acc` is defined as:\n\n   def acc(i1, i2, j1, j2):\n        if i1 >= i2 or j1 >= j2:\n            return 0\n        a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\n        b = S[i2-1][j1-1] if j1 > 0 else 0\n        c = S[i1-1][j2-1] if i1 > 0 else 0\n        d = S[i1-1][j1-1] if i1 > 0 and j1 > 0 else 0\n        return a - b - c + d\n\nThis computes the sum of the submatrix from (i1, j1) to (i2-1, j2-1). \n\nBut note: the matrix is stored in S as a 2D prefix sum where S[i][j] = sum_{x=0}^{i} sum_{y=0}^{j} C[x][y].\n\nSo the sum for (i1, j1) to (i2-1, j2-1) is:\n\n   S[i2-1][j2-1] - S[i2-1][j1-1] - S[i1-1][j2-1] + S[i1-1][j1-1]\n\nBut the indices: if i1=0, then we don't subtract S[i1-1][...] because i1-1 is negative. The function handles that.\n\nHowever, the function `acc` is called with parameters that might be out of bounds? For example, if b=0, then acc(0, b, b, i) becomes acc(0,0,0,i) -> which returns 0 because i1=0, i2=0 -> i1>=i2 -> 0.\n\nSimilarly, if i+1>=e, then acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) becomes acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) and if i+1>=e, then it returns 0.\n\nSo it is safe.\n\nBut the recurrence in the DP:\n\n   M[b][e-1] = min_{i in [b, e)} { solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e) + [acc(0, b, b, i) + acc(b, i, i, n) + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) + acc(i+1, e, e, n)] }\n\nAnd then we record the root i in P[b][e-1].\n\nAfter building the DP, we do a recursive labeling to assign the parent.\n\nThe labeling function:\n\n   def label(b, e, p):\n        if e - b == 1:\n            sol[b] = str(p)\n            return\n        elif e - b == 0:\n            return\n        i = P[b][e-1]\n        sol[i] = str(p)\n        label(b, i, i+1)   # the left subtree: from b to i (exclusive of i? because the root is i) -> [b, i) \n        label(i+1, e, i+1) # the right subtree: [i+1, e)\n\nBut note: the parent of the root in the entire tree is 0. The root of the entire tree is the one that has parent 0.\n\nIn the initial call: label(0, n, 0). For the root of the entire tree, we set sol[i] = \"0\". Then for the left subtree, we call label(b, i, i+1) -> the parent of the root of the left subtree is i+1? But i+1 is the index of the root of the entire tree? Actually, the parent of a node is the member number (which is index+1? because the candies are numbered 1 to n). \n\nBut the problem: the candies are numbered 1 to n. The output should be for each team member from 1 to n, the parent's number (or 0 for the leader).\n\nIn the code, we are using 0-indexed indices. The array `sol` is indexed by the candy index (0-indexed). When we output, we output sol[0] to sol[n-1]. But the candy i (0-indexed) corresponds to the team member i+1. The parent we store for candy i is the parent's candy index? But the problem says: \"for each team member from 1 to n\", so we output the parent's team member number.\n\nIn the labeling:\n\n   For the root (at index i), we set sol[i] = str(p). The initial call has p=0, so the root gets parent 0.\n\n   For the left subtree: we call label(b, i, i+1). Here, the parent for the entire left subtree (which will have its own root) is set to i+1. But i+1 is the index of the root of the entire tree? But the root of the entire tree is at index i, so we want the parent of the left child's root to be the root's team member number, which is i+1 (because the candy index i corresponds to team member i+1).\n\n   Similarly, for the right subtree: we call label(i+1, e, i+1). The parent of the root of the right subtree is set to i+1 (the team member number of the root).\n\nBut wait: the parent of the left subtree's root should be the root's team member number, which is i+1. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo the labeling is correct.\n\nHowever, note: the left subtree covers [b, i) -> the root of the left subtree is at the index that we choose in the DP for the segment [b, i). Similarly for the right.\n\nBut the function `label` for the left subtree passes the parent as i+1 (the team member number of the current root). And the same for the right.\n\nTherefore, the code is almost complete. We only need to:\n\n  1. Add a loop for t test cases.\n  2. Complete the prefix sum for the case i>0 and j==0: S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\nBut note: the matrix is n x n. We are building a 2D prefix sum for the entire matrix. However, the matrix is symmetric and we only need to compute it once per test case.\n\nBut the DP uses the entire matrix? The function `acc` uses the global S. So we must build S for each test case.\n\nBut the total n over test cases is 200000, and the sum of n^2 over test cases might be large. However, the total n (the sum of the n_i) is 200000, but the total n_i^2 might be large. For example, if one test case has n=200000, then n^2=40000000000, which is too big.\n\nBut we have already argued that the total n_i (the sum of the sizes) is 200000, and the maximum n_i is 200000, but then there is only one test case. And 200000^2 = 40e9, which is too big.\n\nBut the problem says: the total n over all test cases does not exceed 200000. This means the sum of the n_i is 200000. And the matrix for one test case has n_i^2 integers. So if one test case has n_i=200000, then we have to store 40e9 integers, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid storing the entire matrix. How can we compute the `acc` function without storing the entire matrix?\n\nWe note that the `acc` function is only called with arguments that are contiguous intervals. And the recurrence for the DP only uses O(n^2) states? But the DP has states [b, e) with b and e in [0, n], so O(n^2) states. And for each state, we iterate over O(n) roots. So the total is O(n^3). But n is at most 200000? That is 200000^3 = 8e15, which is too many.\n\nBut the total n over test cases is 200000, and the average n is 20, so the maximum n in a test case is 200000? But then the DP for one test case with n=200000 would be O(200000^3) which is 8e15 operations, which is too many.\n\nTherefore, the provided DP is only feasible for small n (like n<=200). But the total n over test cases is 200000, and if there is one test case with n=200000, we cannot run the DP.\n\nHowever, the constraint says the total n over test cases is 200000, and the maximum n per test case is 200000, but then there is only one test case. And we cannot run the O(n^3) DP for n=200000.\n\nThis suggests that the intended solution is not the O(n^3) DP. There must be a more efficient algorithm.\n\nAfter research, this problem is known as the \"Optimal BST\" with the cost being the sum over all pairs of the distance times a weight. There is a known O(n^2) solution using Knuth's optimization? But Knuth's optimization is for the case when the cost is the expected search time (with weights on the nodes) and it is 1D. Here the cost is pairwise.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following: the total cost is the same as the cost of the tree for the following: \n\n   total_cost = sum_{i} depth(i) * (row_i + col_i)\n\nwhere row_i = sum_{j} c_ij, and col_i = sum_{j} c_ij? But that would be 2 * sum_{j} c_ij. But then the cost is not capturing the pairwise distances properly.\n\nActually, we have:\n\n   total_cost = sum_{i<j} c_ij * (depth(i) + depth(j) - 2 * depth(LCA(i,j)))\n\n   = (sum_i depth(i) * (sum_{j} c_ij)) - 2 * sum_{i<j} c_ij * depth(LCA(i,j))\n\nBut the first term is linear in the depths. The second term is more complex.\n\nThere is a known result: the problem can be reduced to the following: minimize sum_i depth(i) * w_i, where w_i = row_i + col_i - 2 * (something)? \n\nGiven the complexity, and the constraints, it is likely that the intended solution is the O(n^3) DP for small n, and we are only required to handle test cases with small n (because the total n is 200000, but the maximum n per test case is small).\n\nBut the total n over test cases is 200000, and if we have one test case with n=200000, we cannot do O(n^3). However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and the sum of n is 200000, so the maximum n in a test case is 200000, and there is only one test case. \n\nThis is a contradiction. We must have misread the constraint.\n\nRe-read: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". This means the sum of the sizes (n) for all test cases is 200000. So if we let T be the number of test cases, and n_1, n_2, ..., n_T, then n_1+n_2+...+n_T <= 200000.\n\nTherefore, the largest n_i is 200000, and then there is only one test case. Or two test cases: n1=100000, n2=100000, but then the matrix for one test case is 100000^2 = 10e9 integers, which is 40 GB, which is too much.\n\nUnless we do not store the matrix as a 2D array. We can compute the required sums without storing the entire matrix.\n\nHow can we compute the `acc` function without a 2D prefix sum array? \n\nThe `acc` function is defined on rectangular regions. We can precompute a 2D prefix sum, but that requires O(n^2) space.\n\nBut note: the matrix c is given by input. We have to at least read it. The total number of integers in the input for the matrices is sum_{test cases} (n_i^2). And the sum of n_i is 200000, but the sum of n_i^2 might be very large.\n\nFor example, if there is one test case with n=200000, then we have to read 40000000000 integers, which is 40e9 integers, which is 40e9 * 4 bytes = 160 GB, which is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, the only hope is that the matrix is given in a format that allows us to compute the required sums without storing the entire matrix, or that the matrix is sparse? But the problem does not say that.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following: the cost for a pair (i,j) is symmetric, and the recurrence only needs the sums over rectangular regions. We can precompute the 2D prefix sum on the fly without storing the entire matrix? But to compute the prefix sum, we need the entire matrix.\n\nThis is a dead end.\n\nGiven the time constraints, and the fact that the provided code is for small n, and the total n over test cases is 200000, we must assume that no test case has n>200, because otherwise the input would be too large. \n\nBut 200^2 = 40000 integers per test case, and the total n is 200000, so the number of test cases is 200000/200 = 1000 test cases. Then the total integers in matrices is 1000 * 40000 = 40e6, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we can assume that the maximum n per test case is 200, because 200000/200 = 1000 test cases, and 1000 * (200^3) = 1000 * 8000000 = 8e9 operations, which is borderline in C++ but in Python it might be too slow.\n\nBut the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and n>=1, so the maximum number of test cases is 200000, but then each n=1, and the matrix is 1x1, so it's 200000 test cases, each with n=1, then the total operations is 200000 * (1^3) = 200000, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the solution is to iterate for t test cases, and for each test case, if n==0, skip, else read the matrix, build the 2D prefix sum, run the DP, and output the parent array.\n\nSteps for one test case:\n\n  1. Read n.\n  2. Read n lines, each with n integers. This is the matrix c.\n  3. Build a 2D prefix sum array S of size n x n.\n        S[i][j] = c[i][j] \n                   + (S[i-1][j] if i>0 else 0) \n                   + (S[i][j-1] if j>0 else 0) \n                   - (S[i-1][j-1] if i>0 and j>0 else 0)\n  4. Initialize M and P as 2D arrays of size n x n, with -1.\n  5. Define the DP function solve(b, e) for the segment [b, e) (candies from b to e-1).\n        if e-b==0: return 0\n        if e-b==1: \n            M[b][e-1] = 0\n            return 0\n        if M[b][e-1] != -1: return it\n        then iterate i from b to e-1:\n            cost = solve(b, i) + solve(i+1, e) \n                   + acc(0, b, b, i) \n                   + acc(b, i, i, n) \n                   + acc(0, i+1, i+1, e) \n                   + acc(i+1, e, e, n)\n            if cost < best, update best and record i in P[b][e-1]\n        return best\n  6. Call solve(0, n)\n  7. Initialize an array sol of size n for the parent information.\n  8. Call label(0, n, 0)\n  9. Output the array sol as space separated integers.\n\nBut note: the function `acc` in the provided code uses the global S. We have to make sure the matrix S is for the current test case.\n\nWe must also note: the matrix indices in the function `acc` are [0, n) for both dimensions.\n\nHowever, the recurrence in the DP might be slow for n up to 200. The worst-case number of states is O(n^2) and for each state we do O(n) iterations, so O(n^3) per test case. For n=200, 200^3 = 8e6, which is acceptable in Python for the total number of test cases being at most 1000 (because 1000 * 8e6 = 8e9 operations, which might be borderline in Python in 10 seconds).\n\nBut the total n over test cases is 200000, and if the average n is 200, then the number of test cases is 1000, and 1000 * (200^3) = 8e9, which might be too slow in Python.\n\nWe must optimize the DP to be O(n^2) per test case. There is a well-known technique for optimal BST that reduces it to O(n^2) using Knuth's optimization, but that is for a different cost function. Here the cost function is different.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to optimize by precomputing the terms in the recurrence. The terms like acc(0, b, b, i) can be precomputed for all b and i? But the recurrence has many terms.\n\nGiven the complexity, and since the total n over test cases is 200000, and the maximum n per test case might be small (like 200), and 200^3=8e6 per test case, and the number of test cases is 200000 / (average n). If the average n is 200, then 1000 test cases * 8e6 = 8e9 operations, which in Python might be 8e9/1e6 = 8000 seconds, which is too slow.\n\nTherefore, we must hope that the average n is small. For example, if the average n is 100, then the number of test cases is 2000, and 2000 * (100^3) = 2000 * 1000000 = 2e9, which is 2000 seconds in Python, which is too slow.\n\nThis suggests that the intended solution is not the O(n^3) DP.\n\nAfter further research, there is a known solution for this problem: it is called the \"Optimal Binary Search Tree\" for the case when the cost is the sum over all pairs of the distance times a weight. It can be solved in O(n^2) using dynamic programming with Knuth's optimization if the cost matrix is a Monge array. But the matrix c is arbitrary symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the following: the cost for a tree is also equal to the sum over edges of the total weight of pairs that cross the edge. And the total weight of pairs that cross an edge (u,v) (where v is a child of u) is fixed for a given split. And the function is quadrangle inequality? \n\nIn fact, the recurrence is of the form:\n\n   F(i, j) = min_{i<=k<=j} { F(i, k-1) + F(k+1, j) } + W(i, j, k)\n\nBut in our case, the cost term is not just W(i, j) but depends on k. Specifically, the cost term is:\n\n   T(i, j, k) = acc(0, i, i, k) + acc(i, k, k, n) + acc(0, k+1, k+1, j) + acc(k+1, j, j, n)\n\nBut note: the first two terms (for the left child) depend on i, k, and the last two on k+1, j. And also, the entire cost term might be decomposable as:\n\n   T(i, j, k) = A(i, k) + B(k+1, j)\n\nwhere \n   A(i, k) = acc(0, i, i, k) + acc(i, k, k, n)\n   B(k+1, j) = acc(0, k+1, k+1, j) + acc(k+1, j, j, n)\n\nThen the recurrence becomes:\n\n   F(i, j) = min_{k} { F(i, k) + F(k+1, j) + A(i, k) + B(k+1, j) }\n\nThis does not obviously fit the quadrangle inequality.\n\nGiven the time, and since the problem is non-trivial, and the provided code is for the O(n^3) DP, and the constraints on the total n over test cases being 200000 might imply that the average n is very small (like 20), then we can use the O(n^3) DP.\n\nFor example, if the average n is 20, then the number of test cases is 10000, and 10000 * (20^3) = 10000 * 8000 = 80e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\nTherefore, we will implement the O(n^3) DP and hope that the average n is small.\n\nSteps for the code:\n\n  t = int(input().strip())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      c = []\n      for i in range(n):\n          c.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\n      # Build the 2D prefix sum S: size n x n\n      S = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n      for i in range(n):\n          for j in range(n):\n              S[i][j] = c[i][j]\n              if i>0:\n                  S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n              if j>0:\n                  S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n              if i>0 and j>0:\n                  S[i][j] -= S[i-1][j-1]\n\n      # But wait, the above is not the standard prefix sum. The standard is to have S[i][j] = sum_{x=0}^{i} sum_{y=0}^{j} c[x][y]\n      # We have built it correctly.\n\n      # However, the provided code in the initial code has a different order: it does it in a nested loop and has an if-elif-else.\n      # But we can do it in the above way.\n\n      # But the provided code has:\n      #   for i in range(n):\n      #       for j in range(n):\n      #           if i>0 and j>0: \n      #               S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n      #           elif i>0: \n      #               S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n      #           elif j>0:\n      #               S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n      #\n      # This is the same as what we did above, but we did it without conditionals by separate if's.\n\n      # Now, we define the function acc(i1, i2, j1, j2) as in the provided code.\n\n      # We then do the DP and labeling.\n\n      # But note: the DP in the provided code uses a 2D array M and P of size n x n. The state is [b, e) with e from b+1 to n.\n      # We have to allocate 2D arrays of size n x n.\n\n      # However, n is at most 200, so we can do it.\n\n      M = [[-1] * n for _ in range(n)]\n      P = [[-1] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n      # We'll define the solve function for [b, e) where e is exclusive.\n      # But note: the state [b, e) has length = e - b.\n      # We'll use memoization.\n\n      # But the provided solve function is for [b, e) (e exclusive).

So we are storing the parent as the team member number.\n\n      # Output the array sol_str as space separated.\n      print(\" \".join(sol_str))\n\nBut note: the initial code in the problem has a different structure. It does not have a loop for t. We added it.\n\nAlso, the initial code has a TODO in the prefix sum part. We fixed it by doing the prefix sum in a different way.\n\nHowever, the initial code has a nested loop for the prefix sum that is different. We did a simpler one.\n\nBut the initial code does:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n      for j in range(n):\n          if i>0 and j>0:\n              S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n          elif i>0:\n              # TODO: \n          elif j>0:\n              ...\n\nWe fixed the TODO to: S[i][j] += S[i-1][j] for the case i>0 and j==0.\n\nBut in our new code, we did:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            S[i][j] = c[i][j]\n            if i>0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n            if j>0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n            if i>0 and j>0:\n                S[i][j] -= S[i-1][j-1]\n\nThis is the standard way and is equivalent.\n\nBut note: the initial code's prefix sum might be different? Let's check for (0,0): \n   In the initial code: \n        if i>0 and j>0: no -> then if i>0: no -> then if j>0: no -> so S[0][0] remains c[0][0]\n   In our code: we do if i>0: no, if j>0: no, if i>0 and j>0: no -> so S[0][0]=c[0][0]\n\nFor (0,1): \n   Initial: j>0 -> S[0][1] += S[0][0] -> becomes c[0][1] + c[0][0]\n   Our: we do j>0: add S[0][0] -> c[0][1] + c[0][0] -> same.\n\nFor (1,0):\n   Initial: i>0 -> then in the elif i>0: S[1][0] += S[0][0] -> c[1][0] + c[0][0]\n   Our: i>0 -> add S[0][0] -> c[1][0] + c[0][0] -> same.\n\nFor (1,1):\n   Initial: i>0 and j>0: S[1][1] += S[1][0] + S[0][1] - S[0][0] \n        = c[1][1] + (c[1][0]+c[0][0]) + (c[0][1]+c[0][0]) - c[0][0] \n        = c[1][1] + c[1][0] + c[0][1] + c[0][0]\n   Our: c[1][1] + (c[0][0]+c[0][1]+c[1][0]) [from the row and column additions] and then subtract c[0][0] -> \n        = c[1][1] + c[0][0] + c[0][1] + c[1][0] - c[0][0] = same.\n\nSo it is correct.\n\nBut note: the function `acc` in the provided code uses:\n   a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\n   ...\n\nIn our code, S is the standard prefix sum, so it should work.\n\nHowever, the initial code has a function `acc` that uses:\n   if i1 >= i2 or j1 >= j2: 0\n   else: \n        a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\n        b = S[i2-1][j1-1] if j1>0 else 0\n        ...\n\nThis is for 0-indexed and the ranges [i1, i2) and [j1, j2).\n\nBut our S is the standard prefix sum, so it should work.\n\nLet me test with a small matrix.\n\nBut given the complexity, and since the problem is online, we will output the code as described.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". But the initial code provided is for one test case, and we are to complete the TODO and then output the entire program? But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". \n\nBut the example only has one program: program1.py. The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but in this case only program1.py is provided.\n\nLooking back: the problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program1.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and then \"Output only the missing code\". \n\nBut in the provided code, there is a TODO. Also, the code does not handle multiple test cases.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n  - We must add a loop for t test cases.\n  - We must complete the TODO in the prefix sum.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and in a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". Since only program1.py is provided, we only fill in program1.py.\n\nBut the example output format is: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nWe will output the entire program1.py with the TODO fixed and the test case loop added? But the problem says \"only the missing code\", meaning the parts that are missing.\n\nAlternatively, we are to output the completed parts that were missing, not the entire program.\n\nThe TODO is one line. And the loop for test cases is a block.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output only the lines that are missing.\n\nIn the provided program1.py, the TODO is in the prefix sum part. We need to change that one line.\n\nAlso, the program does not have a loop for test cases. We need to wrap the entire code (except the first line that reads t) in a for loop.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n   We replace the line that reads n and the following lines with a loop.\n\nBut the initial code:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n\n   S = ... \n\nWe change to:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        ... (the rest of the code, with the TODO fixed)\n\nAnd fix the TODO.\n\nBut the TODO is:\n\n   elif i > 0:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe change that to:\n\n   elif i > 0:\n        S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is the entire block that we would insert, but only the parts that are not in the original.\n\nAlternatively, we output the entire program1.py with the fixes? But the problem says not to output the entire program.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", we output the parts that are missing.\n\nWe output:\n\n   program1: the fixed line for the TODO and the loop for test cases.\n\nBut the TODO is one line, and the loop is a block.\n\nWe can output:\n\n   program1: \n        t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    [the entire body of the current program, with the TODO fixed]\n\nBut the entire body is long.\n\nAlternatively, we output only the parts that are changed.\n\nBut the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the block for the test case loop and the fixed line for the TODO.\n\nHowever, the TODO is inside a nested loop. We can output the fixed line and the outer loop.\n\nBut the initial code has:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n\n   S = ... (with TODO)\n\n   ... (rest)\n\nWe want to change the first line to read t, then loop for t, then read n, and fix the TODO.\n\nSo the missing code is:\n\n   We replace the first line (n = ...) with:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n\n   and then in the prefix sum part, replace the TODO with:\n\n            S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n\nBut note: the rest of the code (the DP and labeling) must be inside the loop.\n\nSo the entire code after the first line is inside the loop.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is the following string:\n\n   \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j, c_val in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\\n            S[i][j] = c_val\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j in range(n):\\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\\n            elif i > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\\n            elif j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n\nBut wait, the initial code already has the loop for reading the matrix:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\n            S[i][j] = c\n\nSo we don't need to change that.\n\nBut the initial code then has the prefix sum loop:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n            elif i > 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            elif j > 0:\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\nWe only need to change the TODO line to: \"S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\"\n\nAnd then wrap the entire code after reading t in a loop.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n   We add an outer loop and fix the one line.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the fixed line and the outer loop.\n\nHowever, the initial code is given as a string. We are to output the string that completes the program.\n\nWe output for program1:\n\n   The following string:\n\n      \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\\n            S[i][j] = c\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j in range(n):\\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\\n            elif i > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\\n            elif j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\\n    ... (the rest of the code is the same, but we cannot output the rest because it is not missing)\"\n\nBut the problem says only the missing code. The rest of the code (the function acc, the DP, the labeling) is already provided.\n\nTherefore, we only output the fixed line and the outer loop.\n\nBut the TODO is one line, and the outer loop is a block.\n\nAlternatively, we output the entire program1.py with the fixes? But the problem says not to.\n\nGiven the instructions, I think we are to output only the parts that are missing, which are:\n\n   - The TODO line: replace the comment with \"S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\"\n   - And wrap the code after reading t in a for loop.\n\nBut the initial code does not read t. So the first line is changed.\n\nSo for program1, the missing code is the following string:\n\n   \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\\n            S[i][j] = c\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j in range(n):\\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\\n            elif i > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\\n            elif j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n\nBut this is up to the prefix sum. The rest of the code (the function acc, the DP, the labeling) is already provided and should be inside the loop.\n\nHowever, the initial code has the rest. So in the output for program1, we only need to output the above string, and then the rest of the code is already there.\n\nBut the initial code has:\n\n   n = int(input().strip())\n\n   ... (the rest)\n\nWe are replacing that with the above string.\n\nTherefore, the completed program1.py would be:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\n                S[i][j] = c\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i > 0 and j > 0:\n                    S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\n                elif i > 0:\n                    S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\n                elif j > 0:\n                    S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\n\n        ... (the rest of the initial code: the function acc, the DP, the labeling)\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is the above string.\n\nBut note: the initial code has a variable `c` in the inner loop that is the weight, but in the matrix reading loop, we have:\n\n   for j, c in enumerate(...)\n\nBut then in the prefix sum loop, we have a variable `c` that is not defined. That's a problem.\n\nIn the initial code, the matrix is read into the variable `c`, but then in the prefix sum loop, there is no `c` defined. \n\nIn the initial code:\n\n   for i in range(n):\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\n            S[i][j] = c\n\n   then in the prefix sum loop:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                ...   # here we use S[i][j] which has been set to c.\n\nSo it is correct.\n\nBut in the TODO part, we use S[i][j] and update it.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut the initial code has a function `acc` and then the DP. We assume that is correct.\n\nHowever, the initial code has:\n\n   M = [[-1 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\n\n   and then in the function solve, it uses M[b][e-1]. The state is indexed by b and e-1, where e-1 is the last index in the segment.\n\n   But the segment [b, e) has length e-b, and the state is stored at M[b][e-1]. This is valid for e-1 in [0, n-1].\n\n   And the number of states is n x n.\n\n   But when e-1 < b, we don't use it.\n\n   The function solve is called with (0, n), then (0, i) and (i+1, n), etc.\n\n   We allocate M as n x n, and we use only the states with b<=e-1, i.e., e>=b+1.\n\n   And when e-b==0, we return 0 without storing in M.\n\n   So it is correct.\n\nGiven the above, we output for program1.py the string that includes the test case loop and the fixed TODO.\n\nBut note: the initial code has a line after the prefix sum:\n\n   def acc(i1, i2, j1, j2): ...\n\n   and then the DP.\n\n   This should be inside the loop.\n\n   But the initial code has it. We are not changing it.\n\nSo the final output for program1.py is the string:\n\n   \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\\n            S[i][j] = c\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j in range(n):\\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\\n            elif i > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\\n            elif j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\"\n\nBut this is only up to the prefix sum. The rest of the code is already provided and should be inside the loop.\n\nHowever, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and this is the block that is missing at the beginning.\n\nBut the initial code has the rest. So we only output this block.\n\nFor program2.py, there is no information. The problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but only program1.py is provided. So for program2.py, we output an empty string? or the problem might be that there is no program2.py, so we leave it empty.\n\nBut the example output format has both keys.\n\nWe output for program2.py an empty string.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n   {\"program1\": \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    S = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j, c in enumerate(map(int, input().strip().split())):\\n            S[i][j] = c\\n    for i in range(n):\\n        for j in range(n):\\n            if i > 0 and j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1] + S[i-1][j] - S[i-1][j-1]\\n            elif i > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i-1][j]\\n            elif j > 0:\\n                S[i][j] += S[i][j-1]\", \"program2\": \"\"}\n\nBut note: the initial code has a variable `c` in the inner loop that might conflict with the outer variable? In the function `acc`, there is no `c` defined, so it is safe.\n\nHowever, in the provided code, after the prefix sum, there is a function `acc` that uses a variable `c` (as `c_val` in our earlier version) but in the initial code it is:\n\n   def acc(i1, i2, j1, j2):\n        if i1 >= i2 or j1 >= j2:\n            return 0\n        a = S[i2-1][j2-1]\n        b = S[i2-1][j1-1] if j1 > 0 else 0\n        c = S[i1-1][j2-1] if i1 > 0 else 0   # here c is redefined\n        d = S[i1-1][j1-1] if i1 > 0 and j1 > 0 else 0\n        return a - b - c + d\n\nThis is the same as in the initial code.\n\nBut in the matrix reading loop, we use `c` as the variable. This is not a problem because it is in a different scope.\n\nSo the code should run.\n\nLet me hope.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the above json."
