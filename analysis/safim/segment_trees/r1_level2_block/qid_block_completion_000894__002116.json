The current code then, for each string s, for each position l (0 or 1), and for each letter m from 'a' to 'k' (97 to 108-1=107), it creates a string a by replacing the l-th character of s with chr(m).

Actually, we can write:\n   b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{j} [C(i+k-1, k) mod 2] * a_{j-k+1}   ??? Alternatively, we can look at the example: \n   a = [1,2,3] -> then the matrix is:\n\n   i\\j 0 1 2 3\n   0:  0 1 2 3\n   1:  0 1^0=1, 2^1=3, 3^3=0\n   2:  0 2^0=2, 3^2=1, 0^1=1\n   3:  0 3^0=3, 0^3=3, 1^3=2 But wait, the example in the note is:\n\n   b00=0, b01=1, b02=2, b03=3\n   b10=0, b11=1, b12=3, b13=0\n   b20=0, b21=2, b22=1, b23=3\n   b30=0, b31=3, b32=0, b33=1 And the last column (j=3) for rows 1,2,3: [b13, b23, b33] = [0,3,1]? But the example says [0,2,1]. Actually, the example says: \"The values of b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ... are [0,2,1]\". And n=3, so j=n=3. Then:\n   row1, col3: b13 = 0\n   row2, col3: b23 = 3? but the example says 2? Let me recalculate with the example:\n\n   a = [1,2,3] -> b0: [0,1,2,3] (for j=0,1,2,3) but note: the matrix is (n+1)x(n+1) = 4x4.\n\n   b00 = 0, b01 = a1=1, b02=a2=2, b03=a3=3.\n   b10 = 0, b11 = b10 XOR b01 = 0 XOR 1 = 1\n          b12 = b11 XOR b02 = 1 XOR 2 = 3\n          b13 = b12 XOR b03 = 3 XOR 3 = 0\n   b20 = 0, b21 = b20 XOR b11 = 0 XOR 1 = 1 -> but wait, the example says 2? \n\n Correction: the rule is: \n   b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j} So for b21: \n   b21 = b_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1? but the example says 2? Actually, the example matrix as given in the note:\n\n   $$\\bf{0}$$  $$\\bf{1}$$  $$\\bf{2}$$  $$\\bf{3}$$\n   $$\\bf{0}$$  1  3  0\n   $$\\bf{0}$$  1  2  2\n   $$\\bf{0}$$  1  3  1\n\n This is confusing. The note says:\n\n   If we let a = [1,2,3], then b will be:\n\n   b00=0, b01=1, b02=2, b03=3\n   b10=0, b11=1, b12=3, b13=0\n   b20=0, b21=2, b22=2, b23=2? -> but then it says [0,2,1] for the last column? Actually, the note says: \"The values of b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ... are [0,2,1]\". So for n=3, we have:\n   b_{1,3} = 0\n   b_{2,3} = 2\n   b_{3,3} = 1\n\n How is b_{2,3} computed?\n   b_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3} But we have: \n        b_{1,3} = 0 (from above)\n        b_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2}\n        b_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1\n        b_{1,2} = 3 (from above) so b_{2,2} = 1 XOR 3 = 2\n        then b_{2,3} = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n Similarly, b_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3}\n   b_{3,2} = b_{3,1} XOR b_{2,2}\n        b_{3,1} = b_{3,0} XOR b_{2,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1\n        b_{2,2}=2 -> so b_{3,2}=1 XOR 2 = 3\n        then b_{3,3}=3 XOR 2 = 1. So the example is consistent. How to reconstruct a from the last column (b_{1,n}, ..., b_{n,n})? We denote:\n   Let c_i = b_{i, n} for i=1,...,n.",

Let me reindex the a array: the first row is:\n            j=0: b00=0\n            j=1: b01 = a1\n            j=2: b02 = a2\n            j=3: b03 = a3\n\n        Then for b_{1,3}: We have: \n                b_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} = (b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2}) XOR a3\n                b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR a1 = a1\n                b_{1,2} = a1 XOR a2\n                then b_{1,3} = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3. So the formula for b_{i,j} is:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) ] * a_{j - k}   ??? But wait, the recurrence is:\n\n            b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n        This is the same as:\n\n            b_{i,j} = b_{i-1,j} XOR b_{i,j-1}\n\n        which is the same as the transformation for the Gray code? Actually, we can write:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{x=0}^{i-1} XOR_{y=0}^{j-1} a_{?} Alternatively, we can use generating functions. However, there is a known result: the element b_{i,j} is the XOR-sum of the elements a_{k} for which the path from (0,k) to (i,j) has an odd number of steps that move right? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k} [ C(i+j, i) mod 2 ] * a_{k}   ? But note: the recurrence is the same as the one for the combinatorial number system mod 2. After research, we know:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{j} [ C(i, j-k) mod 2 ] * a_{k+1}   ??? But in our example for b_{1,3} (i=1, j=3): \n            k from 0 to 3: \n                k=0: C(1,3) mod 2 = 0 -> skip\n                k=1: C(1,2) mod 2 = 0\n                k=2: C(1,1) mod 2 = 1 -> a_{2+1}=a3\n                k=3: C(1,0) mod 2 = 1 -> a_{3+1}=a4 -> out of range. This does not match. Another possibility: \n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k} [ C(i, k) mod 2 ] * a_{j - i + k + 1} This is getting messy. Alternatively, we can derive the relation for the last column:\n\n          Let F_i = b_{i,n} = c_i. We have:\n            b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j} Then for j=n, we have: F_i = b_{i,n} = b_{i,n-1} XOR b_{i-1,n} = b_{i,n-1} XOR F_{i-1}\n\n          Now, we can express b_{i,n-1} in terms of F for a smaller n? But note: we are not given the entire matrix. However, we can also write:\n\n            b_{i,n} = b_{i-1,n} XOR b_{i,n-1}\n            => F_i = F_{i-1} XOR b_{i,n-1} Then b_{i,n-1} = F_i XOR F_{i-1}\n\n          Now, we can express b_{i,n-1} in terms of F. Then we can express b_{i,n-2} similarly? But we wish to recover the first row.",

But note: the inversion formula is derived under the assumption that F_0 = d_0. So we must set F_0 = d_0. But d_0 is part of the solution. How to break the circle? We can set F_0 arbitrarily and then compute the d_i, but then we have:\n\n            d_0 = F_0   (by the inversion formula for i=0)\n\n        and then the equation for F_1:\n\n            F_1 (given) = d_0 XOR d_1 = F_0 XOR d_1  => d_1 = F_0 XOR F_1. and then the inversion formula for d_1 is: d_1 = F_0 XOR F_1, which matches. So the entire solution is determined by F_0. But we are free to choose any F_0? And then we get a solution. The problem says: output any. Therefore, we can set F_0 = 0, then:\n\n            d_0 = 0\n            d_1 = 0 XOR F_1 = F_1\n            d_2 = 0 XOR F_2 = F_2\n            d_3 = 0 XOR F_1 XOR F_2 XOR F_3\n\n        But wait, the example: n=3, given F_1=0, F_2=2, F_3=1.

But we defined: \n            d_i = a_{n-i} \n            so: \n                d0 = a3 = 0\n                d1 = a2 = 0\n                d2 = a1 = 2\n\n        Then a = [2,0,0].

In the example, a = [2,0,0] -> a1=2, a2=0, a3=0. Then a_{n} = a3=0, a_{n-1}=a2=0, so 0 XOR 0 =0, which matches F_1=0. But why did the matrix computation give 2? Let me build the matrix for a=[2,0,0]:\n\n          Row0: [0, 2, 0, 0]\n          Row1: \n             b10 = 0\n             b11 = b10 XOR b01 = 0 XOR 2 = 2\n             b12 = b11 XOR b02 = 2 XOR 0 = 2\n             b13 = b12 XOR b03 = 2 XOR 0 = 2   -> but we want 0. The formula for b_{1,3} is not a3 XOR a2, but rather a3 and a2 are not the only ones? Let me use the combinatorial formula for b_{1,3}:\n\n            b_{1,3} = XOR_{k: k submask of 1} a_{3-k} \n                     = a_{3} XOR a_{2} [k=0: a3, k=1: a2] \n                     = 0 XOR 0 = 0. So the matrix computation must be done with the combinatorial formula, not the recurrence? Why the recurrence gave 2? The recurrence: \n          b_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} = 2 XOR 0 = 2.

Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ some coefficient ] a_{ something } After some research, we know that this recurrence generates a Sierpinski triangle, and the element b_{i,j} is the XOR of a_{j} and the entire northeast diagonal above it?

But wait, in the example with a=[2,0,0] (which we got by setting c_0=0) for n=3, the last column should be:\n             c_1 = d_0 XOR d_1 = 0 XOR 0 =0\n             c_2 = d_0 XOR d_2 =0 XOR 2 =2\n             c_3 = d_0 XOR d_1 XOR d_2 XOR d_3 =0 XOR0 XOR2 XOR3=1\n\n          and we were given [0,2,1] -> matches. then a = [2,0,0] is a valid solution. So we output a = [2,0,0] for the example. Therefore, the plan is:\n\n          Let c = [0] + given last column   # c[0] = 0, c[1] = given[0], c[2]=given[1], ... c[n] = given[n-1]\n\n          Then for i in range(0, n):   # i from 0 to n-1, for d_i\n              d_i = XOR_{ for all j such that j is a submask of i and j in [0, i] } c_j\n\n          But note: i can be up to n-1, and n can be 500000.

One common algorithm for the submask convolution is to use: \n\n             for i in range(0, 19):\n                 for j in range(0, 1<<19):\n                     if j has the i-th bit:\n                         a[j] ^= a[j without the bit]\n\n          then after this, the array a becomes the transform where a[j] = XOR_{i subset j} original_a[i] \n\n          which is exactly what we want. Let me test on a small example: \n             size=4, a = [c0, c1, c2, c3]\n             after the transform, we want: \n                 d0 = c0\n                 d1 = c0 XOR c1\n                 d2 = c0 XOR c2\n                 d3 = c0 XOR c1 XOR c2 XOR c3\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n             for i in range(0,2):  # bits 0 and 1\n                 for j in range(0,4):\n                     if j has the bit i, then a[j] ^= a[j without the bit]\n\n          i=0 (bit0):\n             j=0: no -> skip\n             j=1: has bit0 -> a[1] ^= a[1-1]=a[0] -> a[1] = c1 ^ c0\n             j=2: no bit0 -> skip\n             j=3: has bit0 -> a[3] ^= a[2] -> a[3] = c3 ^ c2\n\n          i=1 (bit1=2):\n             j=0: no bit1 -> skip\n             j=1: no bit1 -> skip\n             j=2: has bit1 -> a[2] ^= a[0] -> a[2] = c2 ^ c0\n             j=3: has bit1 -> a[3] ^= a[1] -> a[3] = (c3^c2) ^ (c1^c0) = c0^c1^c2^c3\n\n          then a = [c0, c0^c1, c0^c2, c0^c1^c2^c3] -> which is exactly d.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n             for i in range(0, 19):\n                 bit = 1<<i\n                 for j in range(0, size):\n                     if j has the bit:\n                         a[j] ^= a[j - bit]   # or a[j ^ bit]\n\n          because j without the bit is j ^ bit. But note: j might have other bits, but we are only removing one bit. However, in the example, we did a[1] ^= a[0] (0 is 1 without bit0) and a[3] ^= a[2] (3 without bit0 is 2) in the first iteration. In the second iteration, for bit1=2, we did a[2] ^= a[0] (2 without bit1 is 0) and a[3] ^= a[1] (3 without bit1 is 1). This matches. Therefore, the TODO is: \n\n             a[j] ^= a[j ^ z]\n\n          But note: the array a might be of length n, and j^z might be out of bounds?",

Our transform is: \n             d_i = XOR_{j subset i} c_j\n\n          This is the forward zeta transform for the subset summation in GF(2). But note: the state of the art is to do it in O(n log n) by:\n\n            for j in range(0, 20):\n                for i in range(0, n+1):\n                    if i has the j-th bit:\n                        continue\n                    else:\n                        c_i | (1<<j) ^= c_i   ? Actually, the standard for the zeta transform (subset summation) is:\n\n            for j in range(0, 20):\n                for i in range(0, 1<<20):\n                    if i & (1<<j) == 0:\n                        c_i | (1<<j) += c_i   # for summation\n\n          but for XOR, it is the same as addition in GF(2)? However, we only need indices up to n (which is 500000), and 2^19=524288, so we can let size = 1<<19. But the problem: n up to 500000, and we are given an array of length n. We only need to compute for i in [0, n] (which is about 500001) and for j in 0..19, so total 20 * 500000 = 10^6, which is acceptable. Steps for the submask summation in GF(2) for the inverse transform ( which is the same as the forward transform in this case) is:\n\n            for j in range(0, 19):\n                for i in range(0, size):\n                    if i has the j-th bit: \n                        then skip? \n                    else:\n                        if i|(1<<j) < size, then c_{i|(1<<j)} ^= c_i\n\n          But wait, our transform is: \n             d_i = XOR_{j subset i} c_j\n\n          and we have c = [0, given[0], given[1], ..., given[n-1]] for indices 0..n.\n\n          then we can do:\n\n             size = 1<<19  # or 1<<20 to be safe, but n<=500000, so 1<<19 is enough (524288) d = [0] * size\n             # copy c into d for indices 0..n, and for indices >n, set to 0.\n             for i in range(0, n+1):\n                 d[i] = c[i]\n             for i in range(n+1, size):\n                 d[i] = 0\n\n             for j in range(0, 19):\n                 for i in range(0, size):\n                     if i & (1<<j) == 0:\n                         if i | (1<<j) < size:\n                             d[i|(1<<j)] ^= d[i]\n\n          then the array d is the desired d array for i in [0, size-1]. then we output the array a = [d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0] \n\n          Specifically, for i from 0 to n-1, we have:\n             a_i = d_{n-1-i}   ??? But wait, we defined:\n             d_i = a_{n-i}   -> a_{n-i} = d_i. then for i=0: a_n = d_0\n          for i=1: a_{n-1} = d_1\n          for i=2: a_{n-2} = d_2\n          ...\n          for i=n-1: a_1 = d_{n-1}\n\n          so the array a = [d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0]\n\n          which is the reverse of the array d from index 0 to n-1.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The current code initializes a dictionary `d1` for all two-letter strings from 'aa' to 'kk' (since 109 is the ASCII for 'm', but note: the problem says from 'a' to 'k', which is 97 to 107). However, the loops go from 97 to 108 (exclusive of 109) which is 97 to 108-1=107, so that's correct.\n\n The current code then, for each string s, for each position l (0 or 1), and for each letter m from 'a' to 'k' (97 to 108-1=107), it creates a string a by replacing the l-th character of s with chr(m). Then it checks if a is the same as s? Actually, if we replace the l-th character with m and it becomes s again, that means we are replacing with the same character. We don't want to count that because we are looking for pairs that differ in exactly one position. So we should skip when a==s.\n\n However, note that the problem says: count pairs (i, j) such that the two strings differ in exactly one position. The current approach is: for each string s, we consider all the strings that can be formed by changing one character (to any letter from 'a' to 'k') and then we add the count of such strings that we have seen so far (from the dictionary d1). But note: if we change one character and get a string that is the same as s (i.e., when we replace with the same letter), we skip. But also note: we are iterating over both positions and all 11 letters (from 'a' to 'k' inclusive: 11 letters). \n\n However, the current code has a comment `# TODO: Your code here` in the `if a==s` block. What should we do? We should skip counting this because we don't want to count the same string. Also, note that the dictionary d1 counts the frequency of each string. We are going to update the dictionary with the current string at the end.\n\n But observe: the current code does `ans1 += d1[a]` for every a we generate (even when a==s). That is wrong because we don't want to count the same string (which would be the current string) and also we don't want to count when the change doesn't actually change the string. So we should skip when a==s.\n\n Therefore, we should do: if a==s, then we skip adding? Actually, we should skip because we are looking for a string that is different in exactly one position. But note: the same string would be the same in both positions? Actually, if we change a character to the same letter, then we get the same string. So we don't want to count that.\n\n So we can do: if a != s, then we add d1[a]. But note: the current code does `ans1 += d1[a]` for every a. We can put an `else`? Alternatively, we can avoid generating the same string by not iterating over the same letter? But the loop goes from 97 to 108, which includes the current letter. So we must skip.\n\n Therefore, we can change the inner loop to:\n\n   for l in range(2):\n        for m in range(97,109):\n            a = list(s)\n            a[l] = chr(m)\n            a = ''.join(a)\n            if a == s:\n                continue   # skip the same string\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n However, note that the problem says: the total n over test cases is at most 10^5. But the inner loops are 2 * 11 = 22 per string, so total 22 * 10^5 = 2.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n But wait: the current code has the line `ans1 += d1[a]` without any condition. And then after the loops, it does `d1[s] += 1`. This is a common technique: we are counting the pairs (i, j) with i<j by processing j and counting how many i (with i<j) we have seen that are such that the current string s_j and the previous string s_i form a pair. However, note that we are generating all the strings that are one change away. But note: the pair (i, j) is counted when we are at j: we look at all the strings that are one change away from s_j and that we have seen so far (i.e., the i's that are less than j). \n\n However, there is a catch: the same pair might be generated in two different ways? Actually, no: because if two strings differ in exactly one position, then there is exactly one way to change one character of one string to get the other. So we are not overcounting.\n\n But note: what if we have two strings that are the same? Then when we process the second string, we will generate the first string by changing nothing? But we skip when a==s. Also, when we have two identical strings, they do not form a valid pair because they don't differ in exactly one position (they differ in zero). So we are safe.\n\n However, the current code does not have the skip. So we must add the skip.\n\n Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is to skip the current iteration when a==s. We can do that by replacing the TODO with a `continue` and then unindent the next line? Actually, the current code has:\n\n        if a == s:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n We want to skip the `ans1 += d1[a]` when a==s. So we can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But note: the current code has the `ans1 += d1[a]` at the same indentation as the inner loops. We can also do:\n\n        if a != s:\n            ans1 += d1[a]\n\n However, the problem says: output only the missing code. The missing code is only the part that replaces the TODO. We cannot change the structure arbitrarily.\n\n The TODO is in the block of `if a==s:`. We can put `continue` in the TODO block and leave the rest? But note: the next line `ans1 += d1[a]` is after the if block. So if we do `continue` in the if block, then when a==s, we skip the rest of the inner loop for this m? Actually, no: the `continue` would skip only the current iteration of the innermost loop (the m loop). So we can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue   # This will skip the next line for this a\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But wait: the code after the if block is `ans1 += d1[a]` and then we go to the next m. So we can simply put `continue` in the TODO.\n\n Alternatively, we can do nothing and then skip the addition? But the TODO is only one line. We can write:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue\n\n But note: the current code has the `ans1 += d1[a]` at the same level as the inner for loops? Actually, it is inside the loops for m and l, but outside the if. So we can do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n However, the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code is the content for the if block. We cannot remove the existing `ans1 += d1[a]` because we are only allowed to output the missing code.\n\n But note: the TODO is in the if block. We are allowed to write multiple lines? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the missing block. However, the output format is a string for the completion of the program. We must write exactly what goes in the TODO.\n\n Since the TODO is in the if block, we can write:\n\n            continue\n\n But then the next line (ans1 += ...) is still executed? We don't want that when a==s. So we must also remove the existing `ans1 += d1[a]`? But we are not allowed to change existing code? \n\n Let me reexamine the code:\n\n    for y in range(n):\n        s = input()\n        for l in range(2):\n            for m in range(97,109):\n                a = list(s)\n                a[l] = chr(m)\n                a = ''.join(a)\n                if a == s:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                ans1+=d1[a]\n        d1[s]+=1\n\n We see that the `ans1 += d1[a]` is executed for every a, even when a==s. That is wrong. So we must avoid that.\n\n How about we change the TODO to:\n\n            continue\n\n Then the code becomes:\n\n                if a == s:\n                    continue\n                ans1 += d1[a]\n\n This is valid. The `continue` will skip the rest of the current iteration of the inner loop (for this m) and so the `ans1 += d1[a]` is skipped.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is simply: `continue`\n\n But wait: what if we have two strings that are the same? Then when we process the second string, we will generate the first string by changing one character? Only if we change one character to the same as the first string? Actually, no: if we have two identical strings, say \"ab\", then when we process the second \"ab\", we will try to change the first character to 'a' (which gives \"ab\") and then skip. Then we change the first character to other letters and then the second character similarly. But we will not count the pair of two \"ab\" because they are not one change away? Actually, they are zero changes away. So we are safe.\n\n However, note: the problem says: the pair (i, j) must have i<j and the two strings must differ in exactly one position. So identical strings are not counted.\n\n Therefore, the fix is to add `continue` in the if block.\n\n Now for program2.py:\n\n The code we are given:\n\n    a=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n    for k in 0,1:\n        for i in range(19):\n            z=1<<i\n            for j in range(len(a)):\n                if j&z:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n    print(*reversed(a))\n\n The problem: we are given n and then n integers which are b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ..., b_{n,n}. We are to reconstruct the array a of length n (which is the first row of the matrix b, from index 1 to n) such that the last column of the matrix b (from row 1 to n) is the given array.\n\n How the matrix b is built?\n   b_{0,i} = a_i for i from 1 to n.\n   b_{i,0} = 0 for i from 0 to n.\n   b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j} for i,j>=1.\n\n We are given: the last column: b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ..., b_{n,n}.\n\n We note that the matrix b has a known structure. In fact, the element b_{i,j} can be expressed as the XOR of a certain set of a's. Specifically, the pattern is that of a grid with binomial coefficients mod 2? \n\n Actually, we can write:\n   b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{j} [C(i+k-1, k) mod 2] * a_{j-k+1}   ??? \n\n Alternatively, we can look at the example: \n   a = [1,2,3] -> then the matrix is:\n\n   i\\j 0 1 2 3\n   0:  0 1 2 3\n   1:  0 1^0=1, 2^1=3, 3^3=0\n   2:  0 2^0=2, 3^2=1, 0^1=1\n   3:  0 3^0=3, 0^3=3, 1^3=2\n\n But wait, the example in the note is:\n\n   b00=0, b01=1, b02=2, b03=3\n   b10=0, b11=1, b12=3, b13=0\n   b20=0, b21=2, b22=1, b23=3\n   b30=0, b31=3, b32=0, b33=1\n\n And the last column (j=3) for rows 1,2,3: [b13, b23, b33] = [0,3,1]? But the example says [0,2,1]. \n\n Actually, the example says: \"The values of b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ... are [0,2,1]\". And n=3, so j=n=3. Then:\n   row1, col3: b13 = 0\n   row2, col3: b23 = 3? but the example says 2? \n\n Let me recalculate with the example:\n\n   a = [1,2,3] -> b0: [0,1,2,3] (for j=0,1,2,3) but note: the matrix is (n+1)x(n+1) = 4x4.\n\n   b00 = 0, b01 = a1=1, b02=a2=2, b03=a3=3.\n   b10 = 0, b11 = b10 XOR b01 = 0 XOR 1 = 1\n          b12 = b11 XOR b02 = 1 XOR 2 = 3\n          b13 = b12 XOR b03 = 3 XOR 3 = 0\n   b20 = 0, b21 = b20 XOR b11 = 0 XOR 1 = 1 -> but wait, the example says 2? \n\n Correction: the rule is: \n   b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n So for b21: \n   b21 = b_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1? \n   but the example says 2? \n\n Actually, the example matrix as given in the note:\n\n   $$\\bf{0}$$  $$\\bf{1}$$  $$\\bf{2}$$  $$\\bf{3}$$\n   $$\\bf{0}$$  1  3  0\n   $$\\bf{0}$$  1  2  2\n   $$\\bf{0}$$  1  3  1\n\n This is confusing. The note says:\n\n   If we let a = [1,2,3], then b will be:\n\n   b00=0, b01=1, b02=2, b03=3\n   b10=0, b11=1, b12=3, b13=0\n   b20=0, b21=2, b22=2, b23=2? -> but then it says [0,2,1] for the last column? \n\n Actually, the note says: \"The values of b_{1,n}, b_{2,n}, ... are [0,2,1]\". So for n=3, we have:\n   b_{1,3} = 0\n   b_{2,3} = 2\n   b_{3,3} = 1\n\n How is b_{2,3} computed?\n   b_{2,3} = b_{2,2} XOR b_{1,3}\n   But we have: \n        b_{1,3} = 0 (from above)\n        b_{2,2} = b_{2,1} XOR b_{1,2}\n        b_{2,1} = b_{2,0} XOR b_{1,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1\n        b_{1,2} = 3 (from above)\n        so b_{2,2} = 1 XOR 3 = 2\n        then b_{2,3} = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n Similarly, b_{3,3} = b_{3,2} XOR b_{2,3}\n   b_{3,2} = b_{3,1} XOR b_{2,2}\n        b_{3,1} = b_{3,0} XOR b_{2,1} = 0 XOR 1 = 1\n        b_{2,2}=2 -> so b_{3,2}=1 XOR 2 = 3\n        then b_{3,3}=3 XOR 2 = 1.\n\n So the example is consistent.\n\n How to reconstruct a from the last column (b_{1,n}, ..., b_{n,n})?\n\n We denote:\n   Let c_i = b_{i, n} for i=1,...,n.\n\n We know the recurrence for the entire matrix. We wish to recover the first row: a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n\n There is a known property: the element b_{i,j} can be expressed as the XOR over a certain set of a's. Specifically, the set of a's that contribute to b_{i,j} are those a_k such that the binomial coefficient C(i+j, j-k) is odd? \n\n Actually, we can use the property of the grid with XOR: it is known that the transformation is linear and can be represented by a matrix over GF(2). Moreover, the transformation from the first row (a_1,...,a_n) to the last column (c_1,...,c_n) is linear.\n\n We can write:\n\n   c_i = b_{i, n} = ?\n\n   We can derive a recurrence for the last column. Note:\n\n      b_{i, n} = b_{i, n-1} XOR b_{i-1, n}\n\n   But we don't know b_{i, n-1} and we know b_{i-1, n} = c_{i-1} (if i>=2) and for i=1, b_{0,n}=a_n? Actually, no: the first row is a, so b_{0,j}=a_j. Therefore, b_{0,n}=a_n.\n\n   Then for i=1:\n        c_1 = b_{1, n} = b_{1, n-1} XOR b_{0, n} = b_{1, n-1} XOR a_n.\n\n   For i=2:\n        c_2 = b_{2, n} = b_{2, n-1} XOR b_{1, n} = b_{2, n-1} XOR c_1.\n\n   But we don't know the entire column n-1.\n\n Alternatively, we can express the entire matrix in terms of the first row. There is a known combinatorial structure: the element b_{i,j} is the XOR of the elements a_{j}, a_{j+1}, ... with coefficients given by the binomial coefficients mod 2 along a diagonal? \n\n Actually, we have:\n\n   b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) mod 2 ] * a_{j-k}   ??? \n\n But note: the recurrence is:\n\n   b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n   This is similar to the Sierpinski triangle, and the coefficients are the parity of the binomial coefficients.\n\n   Specifically, we have:\n\n      b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) mod 2 ] * a_{j-k}\n\n   However, note that the indices: j-k must be at least 1? and at most n? \n\n   But in our case, we are interested in j = n. Then:\n\n      c_i = b_{i,n} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i,k) mod 2 ] * a_{n-k}\n\n   But note: the binomial coefficient C(i,k) mod 2 is 1 if and only if the binary representation of k is a subset of that of i (i.e., k & i = k). Actually, by Lucas' theorem, C(i,k) mod 2 = 1 if and only if the binary representation of k is contained in that of i.\n\n   However, the set of k for which C(i,k) is odd is exactly the set of k such that k is a submask of i? Actually, no: it is the set of k such that the binary representation of k has a 1 only in positions where i has a 1. So k is a submask of i? Actually, k must be a submask of i? \n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n      c_i = XOR_{k: k is a submask of i} a_{n - k}\n\n   But note: the indices: we are indexing a_{n-k}. However, k can be at most i, and i goes from 1 to n. So n-k must be at least 1? We require n-k>=1 -> k<=n-1. But k is a submask of i and i<=n<=500000, so k<=i<=n. But if k>=n, then n-k<=0, and we don't have a_0. \n\n   Actually, the formula should be:\n\n      b_{i,j} = XOR_{k: k is a submask of i} a_{j - k}\n\n   But when j-k < 1, then we don't have that a? Actually, the recurrence only uses the a's from 1 to j. So for j=n, we have:\n\n      c_i = XOR_{k: k is a submask of i and k<=min(i, n-1)} a_{n - k}\n\n   However, note that the first row is a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The element a_{n-k} is defined only for n-k between 1 and n, i.e., k between 0 and n-1.\n\n   Therefore, we can write:\n\n      c_i = XOR_{k in the set S_i} a_{n - k},   where S_i = { k : k is a submask of i and k <= n-1 }\n\n   But note: k=0 is always a submask. Then a_{n-0}=a_n is included.\n\n   Now, we are given c_1, c_2, ..., c_n. We wish to recover a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.\n\n   We can write the system of equations:\n\n      c_1 = a_{n} XOR a_{n-1}   ? because for i=1: the submasks of 1 are {0,1}. So k=0 -> a_n, k=1 -> a_{n-1}. But note: k=1 is a submask? and 1<=n-1? if n>=2.\n\n      c_2 = a_{n} XOR a_{n-2}   ? because the submasks of 2 (binary 10) are {0, 2}. So k=0 -> a_n, k=2 -> a_{n-2}. But note: if n<3, then n-2<1 -> we skip? Actually, we require k<=n-1. So if n>=3, then k=2 is allowed.\n\n      c_3 = a_{n} XOR a_{n-1} XOR a_{n-2} XOR a_{n-3}? because the submasks of 3 (binary 11) are {0,1,2,3}. But wait: 3 is a submask? and we require k<=n-1. So if n>=4, then k=3 is allowed.\n\n   However, the example: n=3, then:\n        c_1 = a_3 XOR a_2   [because k=0: a_3, k=1: a_2 (since n-1=2) and k=1<=2? but note: k<=min(i, n-1)=min(1,2)=1 -> so k=0 and k=1]\n        c_2 = a_3 XOR a_1   [k=0: a_3, k=2: a_1 (since n-2=1) and k=2<=min(2,2)=2 -> allowed]\n        c_3 = a_3 XOR a_2 XOR a_1 XOR a_0? -> but a_0 is not defined.\n\n   Actually, for i=3: k must be a submask of 3 and k<=min(3, n-1)=min(3,2)=2. So k in {0,1,2}. Then:\n        c_3 = a_{3} XOR a_{2} XOR a_{1}\n\n   The example: \n        c_1 = 0, c_2 = 2, c_3 = 1.\n\n        a_3 = ? a_2 = ? a_1 = ?\n\n        Equation1: a3 XOR a2 = 0  -> a3 = a2.\n        Equation2: a3 XOR a1 = 2.\n        Equation3: a3 XOR a2 XOR a1 = 1 -> but since a3=a2, then a3 XOR a3 XOR a1 = a1 = 1.\n\n        Then from equation2: a3 XOR 1 = 2 -> a3 = 2 XOR 1 = 3.\n\n        So a = [a1, a2, a3] = [1, 3, 3]. \n\n        But the example had a=[1,2,3]. \n\n        However, the note says: \"If such an array does not exist, output -1\". But the example says the last column is [0,2,1] and we found a solution [1,3,3]. \n\n        But wait: the example also says: \"If there are multiple solutions, output any\". \n\n        However, the example in the note says: the array a=[1,2,3] produces the last column [0,2,1]. So we must check: \n          With a=[1,3,3]:\n            b00=0, b01=1, b02=3, b03=3.\n            b10=0, b11=0 XOR 1 = 1, b12=1 XOR 3 = 2, b13=2 XOR 3 = 1 -> but we want c1 = b13 = 1? but the given c1=0.\n\n        So what went wrong? \n\n        Actually, the formula: \n          c_i = XOR_{k: k is a submask of i and k<=n-1} a_{n-k}\n\n        But for i=1: \n          k=0: a_{3} = 3\n          k=1: a_{2} = 3\n          so c1 = 3 XOR 3 = 0 -> matches.\n\n        For i=2: \n          k=0: a3=3, k=2: a1=1 -> 3 XOR 1 = 2 -> matches.\n\n        For i=3: \n          k=0: a3=3, k=1: a2=3, k=2: a1=1 -> 3 XOR 3 XOR 1 = 1 -> matches.\n\n        So [1,3,3] is a valid solution. \n\n        The example solution [1,2,3] also works? \n          c1 = a3 XOR a2 = 3 XOR 2 = 1? but we want 0 -> no.\n\n        Actually, the example in the note says: the last column is [0,2,1]. \n          For a=[1,2,3]:\n            c1 = a3 XOR a2 = 3 XOR 2 = 1 -> not 0.\n\n        But wait, we recalculated the matrix for a=[1,2,3] and got:\n            b13=0, b23=2, b33=1 -> [0,2,1]. \n\n        How do we get c1 = b1,3 = 0? \n          According to the formula: \n            i=1: k in {0,1} and k<=min(1,2)=1 -> so k=0: a3=3, k=1: a2=2 -> 3 XOR 2 = 1, not 0.\n\n        This indicates the formula might be off by one in indexing.\n\n        Let me reindex the a array: the first row is:\n            j=0: b00=0\n            j=1: b01 = a1\n            j=2: b02 = a2\n            j=3: b03 = a3\n\n        Then for b_{1,3}: \n            We have: \n                b_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} = (b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2}) XOR a3\n                b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR a1 = a1\n                b_{1,2} = a1 XOR a2\n                then b_{1,3} = (a1 XOR a2) XOR a3.\n\n        So the formula for b_{i,j} is:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) ] * a_{j - k}   ??? \n\n        But wait, the recurrence is:\n\n            b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n        This is the same as:\n\n            b_{i,j} = b_{i-1,j} XOR b_{i,j-1}\n\n        which is the same as the transformation for the Gray code? \n\n        Actually, we can write:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{x=0}^{i-1} XOR_{y=0}^{j-1} a_{?} \n\n        Alternatively, we can use generating functions. \n\n        However, there is a known result: the element b_{i,j} is the XOR-sum of the elements a_{k} for which the path from (0,k) to (i,j) has an odd number of steps that move right? \n\n        Actually, we can use the following:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k} [ C(i+j, i) mod 2 ] * a_{k}   ? \n\n        But note: the recurrence is the same as the one for the combinatorial number system mod 2. \n\n        After research, we know:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{j} [ C(i, j-k) mod 2 ] * a_{k+1}   ??? \n\n        But in our example for b_{1,3} (i=1, j=3): \n            k from 0 to 3: \n                k=0: C(1,3) mod 2 = 0 -> skip\n                k=1: C(1,2) mod 2 = 0\n                k=2: C(1,1) mod 2 = 1 -> a_{2+1}=a3\n                k=3: C(1,0) mod 2 = 1 -> a_{3+1}=a4 -> out of range.\n\n        This does not match.\n\n        Another possibility: \n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k} [ C(i, k) mod 2 ] * a_{j - i + k + 1} \n\n        This is getting messy.\n\n        Alternatively, we can derive the relation for the last column:\n\n          Let F_i = b_{i,n} = c_i.\n\n          We have:\n            b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n          Then for j=n, we have:\n            F_i = b_{i,n} = b_{i,n-1} XOR b_{i-1,n} = b_{i,n-1} XOR F_{i-1}\n\n          Now, we can express b_{i,n-1} in terms of F for a smaller n? \n\n          But note: we are not given the entire matrix. \n\n        However, we can also write:\n\n            b_{i,n} = b_{i-1,n} XOR b_{i,n-1}\n            => F_i = F_{i-1} XOR b_{i,n-1}\n\n          Then b_{i,n-1} = F_i XOR F_{i-1}\n\n          Now, we can express b_{i,n-1} in terms of F. Then we can express b_{i,n-2} similarly? \n\n        But we wish to recover the first row. \n\n        There is a better way: we can express F_i in terms of the a's. \n\n        Consider the entire matrix as a linear transformation. The transformation from a to F is linear. We can write:\n\n            F = M * a\n\n        where M is an n x n matrix over GF(2). The element M_{i,j} = 1 if and only if the binomial coefficient C(i, n-j) is odd? \n\n        Actually, from the recurrence and the Sierpinski triangle, we know that the element b_{i,j} is the XOR-sum of a_{j} and then the entire triangle of binomial coefficients mod 2. \n\n        Specifically, we have:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) mod 2 ] * a_{j-k}\n\n        But note: j-k must be at least 0? and we defined a for indices 1..n. So if we let a_0 = 0, then we can write:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) mod 2 ] * a_{j-k}   for j>=i, and for j>n we don't care.\n\n        Then for j=n:\n\n            F_i = b_{i,n} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) mod 2 ] * a_{n-k}\n\n        And we define a_0 = 0, a_{-1}=0, etc. But for n-k<0, we skip? Actually, we can set a_{negative}=0.\n\n        So we have:\n\n            F_i = XOR_{k=0}^{min(i,n)} [ C(i,k) mod 2 ] * a_{n-k}\n\n        Now, we wish to recover a_1, a_2, ..., a_n from F_1, F_2, ..., F_n.\n\n        Note: the matrix of the system is lower triangular if we reverse the a array? \n\n        Let d_i = a_{n-i} for i=0,...,n-1. Then:\n\n            F_i = XOR_{k: k is a submask of i and k<=n-1} d_k   [because C(i,k) mod 2=1 if and only if k is a submask of i]\n\n        But note: k runs from 0 to i, and we require k<=n-1. Then:\n\n            F_i = XOR_{k in the set: k is a submask of i and k<=n-1} d_k.\n\n        This is the same as the fast Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform (subset convolution) for the XOR transform? Actually, it is the subset-sum transform (also known as the M\u00f6bius transform for the subset lattice).\n\n        And we know that we can recover d from F by the inverse transform. The inverse transform for the subset-sum (over the OR lattice) is the M\u00f6bius transform, but here the operation is over the AND lattice? \n\n        Actually, the relation is:\n\n            F_i = XOR_{j subset of i} d_j\n\n        This is the same as the zeta transform for the subset lattice. The inverse is the M\u00f6bius transform:\n\n            d_i = XOR_{j subset of i} mu(0,j) * F_j   ?\n\n        But in GF(2), the M\u00f6bius function for the subset lattice is: mu(j,i) = (-1)^{|i|-|j|} mod 2? That would be 1 if |i|-|j| is even, 0 if odd? But in GF(2), -1=1, so we have:\n\n            d_i = XOR_{j subset of i} F_j   ??? \n\n        Actually, no: the classical M\u00f6bius inversion for the subset poset (with the relation: F_i = sum_{j subset i} d_j) in GF(2) is:\n\n            d_i = XOR_{j subset i} F_j   if we are in GF(2) and the transform is additive? \n\n        But wait, in GF(2) the addition is XOR. The classical inversion for the subset sum in GF(2) is:\n\n            d_i = XOR_{j subset i} F_j   for the standard zeta transform? \n\n        However, we have:\n\n            F_i = XOR_{j subset i} d_j\n\n        Then by the principle of inclusion-exclusion in GF(2), we have:\n\n            d_i = XOR_{j subset i} F_j\n\n        Why? Consider:\n\n            d_0 = F_0\n            d_1 = F_1 XOR F_0\n            d_2 = F_2 XOR F_0\n            d_3 = F_3 XOR F_2 XOR F_1 XOR F_0\n\n        This is the same as the inverse of the OR transform. \n\n        But note: our F_i is defined for i from 1 to n, and we also have F_0? We don't have F_0. \n\n        How is F_0 defined? \n          b_{0,n} = a_n = d_0? \n          But we are given F_i for i>=1.\n\n        We can define F_0 = b_{0,n} = a_n = d_0.\n\n        But we are not given F_0. However, we are not required to output d_0? \n\n        Actually, we have:\n\n            d_0 = a_n\n            d_1 = a_{n-1}\n            d_2 = a_{n-2}\n            ...\n\n        And we wish to recover a_1,...,a_n, which are d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0.\n\n        But note: the array d has indices from 0 to n-1.\n\n        The given F_i for i=1..n corresponds to:\n\n            F_1 = d_0 XOR d_1   [because the submasks of 1: 0 and 1]\n            F_2 = d_0 XOR d_2\n            F_3 = d_0 XOR d_1 XOR d_2 XOR d_3\n\n        We also know that d_i = a_{n-i}. \n\n        How to recover d from F? \n\n          d_0 = F_0   (but we don't have F_0)\n\n        However, we are given F_1, F_2, ..., F_n. We are missing F_0.\n\n        But note: the formula for F_0: \n            F_0 = b_{0,n} = a_n = d_0.\n\n        So we have F_0 = d_0.\n\n        Then the system for i>=1:\n\n            F_i = XOR_{j subset i} d_j   = d_0 XOR (XOR_{j subset i, j>0} d_j)\n\n        And we wish to recover d_i for i>=0.\n\n        The inversion formula:\n\n            d_i = XOR_{j subset i} F_j\n\n        Why is that? \n\n          Let's check for i=0: d_0 = F_0.\n          For i=1: \n               d_1 = F_0 XOR F_1 \n                    = d_0 XOR (d_0 XOR d_1) = d_1.   -> works.\n\n          For i=2:\n               d_2 = F_0 XOR F_2 \n                    = d_0 XOR (d_0 XOR d_2) = d_2.\n\n          For i=3:\n               d_3 = F_0 XOR F_1 XOR F_2 XOR F_3 \n                    = d_0 \n                      XOR (d_0 XOR d_1) \n                      XOR (d_0 XOR d_2) \n                      XOR (d_0 XOR d_1 XOR d_2 XOR d_3)\n                    = (d0 XOR d0 XOR d0 XOR d0) XOR (d1 XOR d1) XOR (d2 XOR d2) XOR d3 \n                    = 0 XOR 0 XOR 0 XOR d3 = d3.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, we can recover d_i by:\n\n            d_i = XOR_{j: j is a subset of i} F_j   [for j from 0 to i, and we consider F_0, F_1, ...]\n\n        But we are given F_1, F_2, ..., F_n. We are missing F_0. \n\n        How to get F_0? \n            F_0 = b_{0,n} = a_n = d_0.\n\n        But we are trying to recover d_0. \n\n        We have a circular dependency. \n\n        However, note: the inversion formula for i=0: \n            d_0 = F_0.\n\n        And we don't have F_0 given. But we can treat F_0 as an unknown. \n\n        But observe: the inversion formula for d_0 is independent: d_0 = F_0.\n\n        And then for d_1, d_2, ... we use the inversion with F_0, F_1, ... \n\n        But we are not given F_0. \n\n        How can we find F_0? \n\n        We have the system:\n\n            d_0 = F_0\n            d_1 = F_0 XOR F_1\n            d_2 = F_0 XOR F_2\n            d_3 = F_0 XOR F_1 XOR F_2 XOR F_3\n            ...\n\n        And we wish to output a_1, a_2, ..., a_n = d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0.\n\n        But we have one degree of freedom: F_0 is not given. \n\n        However, note: the array a is not uniquely determined? The problem says: output any. \n\n        We can choose F_0 arbitrarily? \n\n        But we must satisfy the equations:\n\n            F_1 = d_0 XOR d_1 = F_0 XOR (F_0 XOR F_1) = F_1 -> always holds.\n\n            Similarly, all equations hold regardless of F_0? \n\n        Actually, the equations for F_i (for i>=1) are:\n\n            F_i = d_0 XOR (XOR_{j subset i, j>0} d_j)\n\n        and we have expressed d_j in terms of F_0 and the given F_i's. \n\n        But note: the inversion formula is derived under the assumption that F_0 = d_0. \n\n        So we must set F_0 = d_0. But d_0 is part of the solution. \n\n        How to break the circle? \n\n        We can set F_0 arbitrarily and then compute the d_i, but then we have:\n\n            d_0 = F_0   (by the inversion formula for i=0)\n\n        and then the equation for F_1:\n\n            F_1 (given) = d_0 XOR d_1 = F_0 XOR d_1  => d_1 = F_0 XOR F_1.\n\n        and then the inversion formula for d_1 is: d_1 = F_0 XOR F_1, which matches.\n\n        So the entire solution is determined by F_0. \n\n        But we are free to choose any F_0? \n\n        And then we get a solution. \n\n        The problem says: output any. \n\n        Therefore, we can set F_0 = 0, then:\n\n            d_0 = 0\n            d_1 = 0 XOR F_1 = F_1\n            d_2 = 0 XOR F_2 = F_2\n            d_3 = 0 XOR F_1 XOR F_2 XOR F_3\n\n        But wait, the example: n=3, given F_1=0, F_2=2, F_3=1.\n\n        If we set F_0=0, then:\n\n            d0 = 0\n            d1 = F_0 XOR F_1 = 0 XOR 0 = 0\n            d2 = F_0 XOR F_2 = 0 XOR 2 = 2\n            d3 = F_0 XOR F_1 XOR F_2 XOR F_3 = 0 XOR 0 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 3\n\n        Then a = [a1, a2, a3] = [d_{2}, d_{1}, d_{0}] = [d2, d1, d0] = [2,0,0]? \n\n        But we defined: \n            d_i = a_{n-i} \n            so: \n                d0 = a3 = 0\n                d1 = a2 = 0\n                d2 = a1 = 2\n\n        Then a = [2,0,0]. \n\n        Check: \n            b00=0, b01=2, b02=0, b03=0.\n            b10=0, b11=0 XOR 2 = 2, b12=2 XOR 0 = 2, b13=2 XOR 0 = 2 -> but we want F1 = b13 = 0 -> not 2.\n\n        So it does not work.\n\n        What went wrong? \n\n        The inversion formula is:\n\n            d_i = XOR_{j subset i} F_j\n\n        but we are missing F_0? Actually, we included F_0 (we set it to 0). \n\n        And the formula for F_1 should be:\n\n            F_1 = d_0 XOR d_1 = 0 XOR 0 = 0 -> matches the given F_1=0.\n            F_2 = d_0 XOR d_2 = 0 XOR 2 = 2 -> matches.\n            F_3 = d_0 XOR d_1 XOR d_2 XOR d_3 = 0 XOR 0 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 1 -> matches.\n\n        But then why is b13=2 and not 0? \n\n        Because the formula for b_{1,3} is:\n\n            b_{1,3} = d_0 XOR d_1 = 0 XOR 0 = 0.\n\n        How do we compute b_{1,3} from the matrix? \n            b00=0, b01=2, b02=0, b03=0.\n            b10=0, \n            b11 = b10 XOR b01 = 0 XOR 2 = 2\n            b12 = b11 XOR b02 = 2 XOR 0 = 2\n            b13 = b12 XOR b03 = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n        But the formula says b_{1,3} = d_0 XOR d_1 = 0. \n\n        This indicates that our definition of d_i might be off.\n\n        We defined:\n            d_i = a_{n-i}   -> so a = [d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0]\n\n        But in the formula for b_{i,j} we had:\n\n            b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i,k) mod 2 ] * a_{j-k}\n\n        For j=n, i=1:\n\n            b_{1,n} = a_{n} XOR a_{n-1} = d_0 XOR d_1.\n\n        In the example, a = [2,0,0] -> a1=2, a2=0, a3=0.\n        Then a_{n} = a3=0, a_{n-1}=a2=0, so 0 XOR 0 =0, which matches F_1=0.\n\n        But why did the matrix computation give 2? \n\n        Let me build the matrix for a=[2,0,0]:\n\n          Row0: [0, 2, 0, 0]\n          Row1: \n             b10 = 0\n             b11 = b10 XOR b01 = 0 XOR 2 = 2\n             b12 = b11 XOR b02 = 2 XOR 0 = 2\n             b13 = b12 XOR b03 = 2 XOR 0 = 2   -> but we want 0.\n\n        The formula for b_{1,3} is not a3 XOR a2, but rather a3 and a2 are not the only ones? \n\n        Let me use the combinatorial formula for b_{1,3}:\n\n            b_{1,3} = XOR_{k: k submask of 1} a_{3-k} \n                     = a_{3} XOR a_{2}   [k=0: a3, k=1: a2] \n                     = 0 XOR 0 = 0.\n\n        So the matrix computation must be done with the combinatorial formula, not the recurrence? \n\n        Why the recurrence gave 2? \n\n        The recurrence: \n          b_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n        But the combinatorial formula says 0. \n\n        This indicates the combinatorial formula might be for a different indexing. \n\n        Let me reindex the a array: \n          We have a1, a2, a3 at positions j=1,2,3.\n\n        In the matrix:\n          b_{0,1}=a1=2, b_{0,2}=a2=0, b_{0,3}=a3=0.\n\n        Then for b_{1,3} by recurrence:\n          b_{1,3} = b_{1,2} XOR b_{0,3} \n          b_{1,2} = b_{1,1} XOR b_{0,2} \n          b_{1,1} = b_{1,0} XOR b_{0,1} = 0 XOR 2 = 2.\n          then b_{1,2} = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n          then b_{1,3} = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n        But the combinatorial formula: \n          b_{1,3} = a_{3} XOR a_{2} = a3 XOR a2 = 0 XOR 0 = 0.\n\n        They are not the same. \n\n        What is the combinatorial formula for b_{i,j} in terms of a? \n\n        We can derive it:\n\n          b_{0,j} = a_j.\n          b_{1,j} = b_{1,j-1} XOR b_{0,j} \n                  = (b_{1,j-2} XOR b_{0,j-1}) XOR b_{0,j}\n                  = ... \n                  = b_{1,0} XOR [XOR_{k=1}^{j} b_{0,k}]\n                  = 0 XOR (a_1 XOR a_2 XOR ... XOR a_j)\n\n        So for j=3: b_{1,3} = a1 XOR a2 XOR a3 = 2 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n        This matches the recurrence. \n\n        Therefore, the combinatorial formula I recalled earlier is not for this recurrence. \n\n        We must derive the correct combinatorial formula. \n\n        The recurrence: \n          b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n        This is the same as:\n\n          b_{i,j} = b_{i-1,j} XOR b_{i,j-1}\n\n        This is the recurrence for the Gray code array, and it does not yield the binomial coefficients. \n\n        In fact, the array is the XOR of the a's in a rectangle? \n\n        We can use generating functions. Let:\n\n          G_i(x) = sum_{j} b_{i,j} x^j\n\n        Then the recurrence:\n\n          b_{i,j} = b_{i,j-1} XOR b_{i-1,j}\n\n        is not linear in the usual sense for generating functions over integers, but in GF(2) we might try.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use the following:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ some coefficient ] a_{ something }\n\n        After some research, we know that this recurrence generates a Sierpinski triangle, and the element b_{i,j} is the XOR of a_{j} and the entire northeast diagonal above it? \n\n        There is a known result: \n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) ] a_{j+k}   ? \n\n        Let me test for i=1, j=1:\n\n          b_{1,1} = XOR_{k=0}^{1} [ C(1,k) ] a_{1+k} = a1 XOR a2.\n\n          In our example: a1=2, a2=0 -> 2 XOR 0 = 2, which matches.\n\n        for i=1, j=2:\n\n          b_{1,2} = a2 XOR a3 = 0 XOR 0 =0 -> but we computed as 2 earlier? \n\n        in the example: b_{1,2} = 2.\n\n        Alternatively, maybe:\n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k=0}^{i} [ C(i, k) ] a_{j-k} \n\n        for i=1, j=1: a1 XOR a0. We don't have a0.\n\n        How about with a0=0:\n\n          b_{1,1} = a1 XOR a0 = 2 XOR 0 =2, matches.\n\n          b_{1,2} = a2 XOR a1 = 0 XOR 2 =2, matches.\n\n          b_{1,3} = a3 XOR a2 = 0 XOR 0 =0, matches.\n\n        for i=2, j=1: \n          b_{2,1} = XOR_{k=0}^{2} [ C(2,k) ] a_{1-k} \n                   = a1 (k=0) XOR [C(2,1) not in GF(2) as 2 mod 2=0] a0? and a_{-1} for k=2? \n\n        This is not defined.\n\n        Another possibility: \n\n          b_{i,j} = XOR_{k} [ C(i, k) mod 2 ] * a_{j-i+k+1} \n\n        for i=1, j=3: \n          = XOR_{k=0}^{1} [ C(1,k) mod 2 ] * a_{3-1+k+1} = a_{3} for k=0 and a_{4} for k=1 -> a3 and a4. \n\n        not matching.\n\n        Given the complexity, and the note that the orzlers can optimize to O(T^{5/9}), we must use a different approach.\n\n        The intended solution:\n\n          We are given: \n             c_i = b_{i,n} for i=1..n.\n\n          We wish to find a_1..a_n.\n\n          We note the recurrence:\n\n             b_{i,j} = b_{i-1,j} XOR b_{i,j-1}\n\n          then for the last column (j=n), we have:\n\n             c_i = b_{i,n} = b_{i-1,n} XOR b_{i,n-1} = c_{i-1} XOR b_{i,n-1}\n\n          so b_{i,n-1} = c_i XOR c_{i-1}\n\n          then for the next to last column (j=n-1), we have:\n\n             b_{i,n-1} = b_{i-1,n-1} XOR b_{i,n-2}\n\n          so b_{i,n-2} = b_{i,n-1} XOR b_{i-1,n-1} = (c_i XOR c_{i-1}) XOR (c_{i-1} XOR c_{i-2}) = c_i XOR c_{i-2}   [because c_{i-1} XOR c_{i-1}=0]\n\n          and so on.\n\n          In general, we can show by induction that:\n\n             b_{i,n-k} = XOR_{j=0}^{k} [ C(k, j) mod 2 ] * c_{i-j} \n\n          but only if i>=j.\n\n          then when k = n, we get to the first column (j=0), which is 0 for i>=0.\n\n          Specifically, when k = n, we have:\n\n             b_{i,0} = 0 = XOR_{j=0}^{n} [ C(n, j) mod 2 ] * c_{i-j} \n\n          for i>=n.\n\n          but we are not given c_i for i<1 or i>n.\n\n          For i < n, we can only go back to the first row. \n\n          Specifically, when we reach the first row (i=0), we have:\n\n             b_{0,j} = a_j.\n\n          and we can also use the recurrence to express a_j in terms of the c_i's.\n\n          In particular, we can show:\n\n             a_{n} = c_0   [ if we set c_0 = a_n? ] \n             a_{n-1} = c_1 XOR c_0\n             a_{n-2} = c_2 XOR c_0\n             a_{n-3} = c_3 XOR c_2 XOR c_1 XOR c_0\n\n          which is the same as the submask inversion we had earlier.\n\n        Therefore, despite the matrix recurrence not being the binomial coefficients, the relation between the last column and the first row is the same as the submask convolution.\n\n        So we can use the submask inversion. \n\n        Steps for program2.py:\n\n          Let c[1..n] = the given last column.\n          We will compute the array d of length n, where:\n             d_i = a_{n-i}   (so a = [d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0])\n\n          and we have:\n             c_i = XOR_{j: j submask of i} d_j   for i=1..n, and also for i=0 we have c_0 = d_0.\n\n          then the submask inversion is:\n\n             d_i = XOR_{j: j submask of i} c_j   for i=0..n-1.\n\n          but note: our c_i is given for i=1..n, and we need c_0.\n\n          We set c_0 = 0 (or any value) and then we will get a solution. \n\n          However, the example showed that with c_0=0, we got a solution that passed the submask condition, but when we built the matrix it did not match. \n\n          But wait, in the example with a=[2,0,0] (which we got by setting c_0=0) for n=3, the last column should be:\n             c_1 = d_0 XOR d_1 = 0 XOR 0 =0\n             c_2 = d_0 XOR d_2 =0 XOR 2 =2\n             c_3 = d_0 XOR d_1 XOR d_2 XOR d_3 =0 XOR0 XOR2 XOR3=1\n\n          and we were given [0,2,1] -> matches.\n\n          then a = [2,0,0] is a valid solution.\n\n          So we output a = [2,0,0] for the example.\n\n        Therefore, the plan is:\n\n          Let c = [0] + given last column   # c[0] = 0, c[1] = given[0], c[2]=given[1], ... c[n] = given[n-1]\n\n          Then for i in range(0, n):   # i from 0 to n-1, for d_i\n              d_i = XOR_{ for all j such that j is a submask of i and j in [0, i] } c_j\n\n          But note: i can be up to n-1, and n can be 500000. How to do this in O(n log n)? \n\n          We can use a fast Walsh\u2013Hadamard transform for subset convolution, but note: the submask convolution (zeta transform) and its inverse can be done in O(n log n) with a simple loop:\n\n            for i in range(0, n+1): \n                for j in range(0, n+1):\n                    if i is a submask of j, then ...\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            for bit in range(0, 20):   # because 2^20 > 500000\n                for i in range(0, n+1):\n                    if i has the bit-th bit:\n                        then c_i remains unchanged?\n          Actually, the standard method for the submask summation (zeta transform) is:\n\n            for i in range(0, size):\n                for j in range(0, n):\n                    if i & (1<<j):\n                        c_i ^= c_i without the j-th bit\n\n          but that is for the forward transform. \n\n          Our transform is: \n             d_i = XOR_{j subset i} c_j\n\n          This is the forward zeta transform for the subset summation in GF(2). \n\n          But note: the state of the art is to do it in O(n log n) by:\n\n            for j in range(0, 20):\n                for i in range(0, n+1):\n                    if i has the j-th bit:\n                        continue\n                    else:\n                        c_i | (1<<j) ^= c_i   ? \n\n          Actually, the standard for the zeta transform (subset summation) is:\n\n            for j in range(0, 20):\n                for i in range(0, 1<<20):\n                    if i & (1<<j) == 0:\n                        c_i | (1<<j) += c_i   # for summation\n\n          but for XOR, it is the same as addition in GF(2)? \n\n          However, we only need indices up to n (which is 500000), and 2^19=524288, so we can let size = 1<<19.\n\n          But the problem: n up to 500000, and we are given an array of length n. We only need to compute for i in [0, n] (which is about 500001) and for j in 0..19, so total 20 * 500000 = 10^6, which is acceptable.\n\n          Steps for the submask summation in GF(2) for the inverse transform ( which is the same as the forward transform in this case) is:\n\n            for j in range(0, 19):\n                for i in range(0, size):\n                    if i has the j-th bit: \n                        then skip? \n                    else:\n                        if i|(1<<j) < size, then c_{i|(1<<j)} ^= c_i\n\n          But wait, our transform is: \n             d_i = XOR_{j subset i} c_j\n\n          and we have c = [0, given[0], given[1], ..., given[n-1]] for indices 0..n.\n\n          then we can do:\n\n             size = 1<<19  # or 1<<20 to be safe, but n<=500000, so 1<<19 is enough (524288)\n             d = [0] * size\n             # copy c into d for indices 0..n, and for indices >n, set to 0.\n             for i in range(0, n+1):\n                 d[i] = c[i]\n             for i in range(n+1, size):\n                 d[i] = 0\n\n             for j in range(0, 19):\n                 for i in range(0, size):\n                     if i & (1<<j) == 0:\n                         if i | (1<<j) < size:\n                             d[i|(1<<j)] ^= d[i]\n\n          then the array d is the desired d array for i in [0, size-1].\n\n          then we output the array a = [d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0] \n\n          Specifically, for i from 0 to n-1, we have:\n             a_i = d_{n-1-i}   ??? \n\n          But wait, we defined:\n             d_i = a_{n-i}   -> a_{n-i} = d_i.\n\n          then for i=0: a_n = d_0\n          for i=1: a_{n-1} = d_1\n          for i=2: a_{n-2} = d_2\n          ...\n          for i=n-1: a_1 = d_{n-1}\n\n          so the array a = [d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0]\n\n          which is the reverse of the array d from index 0 to n-1.\n\n          But note: we have d_0, d_1, ..., d_{n-1}. \n\n          However, our d array from the convolution has indices from 0 to size-1, but we only need indices 0 to n-1.\n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n          n_val = int(input())\n          c_list = list of n_val integers (given)\n\n          c0 = 0\n          c = [0] + c_list   # c[0]=0, c[1]=c_list[0], ..., c[n_val]=c_list[n_val-1]\n\n          size = 1<<19\n          d = [0] * size\n          for i in range(0, n_val+1):\n              d[i] = c[i]\n          for i in range(n_val+1, size):\n              d[i] = 0\n\n          for j in range(0, 19):\n              for i in range(0, size):\n                  if i >> j & 1 == 0:   # if the j-th bit is not set\n                      if i | (1<<j) < size:\n                          d[i|(1<<j)] ^= d[i]\n\n          then a = [ d[n_val-1], d[n_val-2], ..., d[0] ]\n\n          print(*a)\n\n        But note: the current code in program2.py is:\n\n          a=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n          for k in 0,1:\n              for i in range(19):\n                  z=1<<i\n                  for j in range(len(a)):\n                      if j&z:\n                          # TODO: Your code here\n          print(*reversed(a))\n\n        This is already provided. \n\n        How does it work?\n\n          a is the given last column, but note: the first line is n, and the second line is the n integers.\n\n          The code: \n             [*open(0)] is a list of lines.\n             [1] is the second line -> the n integers.\n\n          So a = list of the last column, of length n.\n\n          Then it does two passes (k in 0,1) and for 19 bits, and for each j in range(len(a)).\n\n          The current a is the given last column, not the c array we prepared.\n\n          What is the TODO? \n\n          The if condition: if j has the bit z (which is 1<<i), then do something.\n\n          This is iterating over j from 0 to n-1.\n\n          This is similar to a bitwise loop. \n\n          We wish to compute: \n             d_i = XOR_{j subset i} c_j\n\n          with c0=0 and c_i for i>=1 = a_{i-1} (because our given array a is [c1, c2, ..., cn]).\n\n          So we have:\n             c0 = 0\n             c1 = a[0]\n             c2 = a[1]\n             ...\n             cn = a[n-1]\n\n          and we want to compute d_i for i in [0, n-1] (because the a we output is [d_{n-1}, d_{n-2}, ..., d_0] = [d for indices n-1, n-2, ..., 0])\n\n          The standard in-place forward subset XOR transform is:\n\n             for i in range(0, 19):\n                 for j in range(0, size):\n                     if j has the i-th bit, then skip.\n                     else:\n                         c[j | (1<<i)] ^= c[j]\n\n          and then the array c becomes the d array.\n\n          But note: the transform is exactly what we want: after the transform, the value at index i is the XOR of c_j for all j subset i.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n             size = n   # but we need to go up to the maximum index which is n, and n<=500000, so we need size>=n.\n             However, the indices in the given c are only from 0 to n.\n\n          The provided code uses the array `a` and does two passes (k in 0,1) and for 19 bits.\n\n          Why two passes? \n\n          Also, the loop is for j in range(len(a)): the array `a` has length n.\n\n          We are going to use the array `a` to represent the c array for indices 0..n? \n\n          But we have index 0 to n, and the array `a` has only n elements. \n\n          We need to represent c0, c1, c2, ..., cn. \n\n          So we should create an array of size (1<<19) and then copy, but the provided code does not do that.\n\n          Alternatively, we can use an array of length (1<<19) and then at the end output only the last n elements in reverse? \n\n          But the provided code outputs `print(*reversed(a))` and a is the array we are processing.\n\n          How can we do it within the given structure?\n\n          Let me read the provided code again:\n\n            a = [*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]   # this is the given last column, of length n.\n\n          then we do two passes (k in 0,1) over 19 bits.\n\n          and then we output reversed(a).\n\n          This suggests that after the loops, a will be the array d for indices 0..n-1, and then we output it in reverse.\n\n          How to do the subset transform in-place on the array `a` for indices 0..n-1? \n\n          We have to extend the array `a` to size (1<<19)? \n\n          But the problem: n up to 500000, and we are not allowed to create an array of size 1<<19 if we are in a tight memory, but 1<<19 is 524288, which is acceptable.\n\n          However, the provided code does not extend the array. \n\n          We can extend it:\n\n            size = 1<<19\n            a = a + [0]*(size - len(a))\n\n          but the provided code does not do that.\n\n          Alternatively, the provided code might be doing a different method.\n\n          There is a well-known in-place algorithm for the subset XOR transform that works in O(n log n) for an array of size n that is a power of two, but our n may not be.\n\n          However, the provided code iterates only for j in range(len(a)), so it only does the transform for indices in [0, len(a)-1].\n\n          The in-place forward subset XOR transform (zeta transform) is:\n\n            for i in range(0, 19):\n                for j in range(0, 1<<19):\n                    if j has the i-th bit, then skip\n                    else:\n                        a[j | (1<<i)] ^= a[j]\n\n          but this requires a to be of size 1<<19.\n\n          The given array a has only n elements. \n\n          Therefore, we must extend a to size 1<<19.\n\n          But the provided code does not do that. \n\n          Perhaps the intended solution is to do the transform only on the given array without extending, using a different method.\n\n          There is a method to compute d_i for i in [0, n-1] without using the full size array, by iterating only on the submasks of i that are within [0, n-1]. \n\n          But then the complexity is O(3^{number of bits}) per i, which is not acceptable.\n\n          Given the constraints (n up to 500000), we must use the O(n log n) method.\n\n          Therefore, we must extend the array.\n\n          But the provided code does not have the extension. \n\n          We are only to fill in the TODO. \n\n          The TODO is inside a loop over k in 0,1, then over i in 0..18, then over j in 0..len(a)-1.\n\n          What is the purpose of the two passes (k in 0,1)? \n\n          Also, the if condition: if j has the bit z, then ...\n\n          and then the TODO.\n\n          This might be doing the transform in a different order. \n\n          Note: the standard in-place subset XOR transform is:\n\n             for i in range(0, 19):\n                 for j in range(0, 1<<19):\n                     if j does not have the i-th bit:\n                         a[j | (1<<i)] ^= a[j]\n\n          and this is one pass. \n\n          Here there are two passes (k=0 and k=1) and 19 bits.\n\n          What could be the content of the TODO? \n\n          Perhaps it is: \n\n             a[j] ^= a[j ^ z]\n\n          or something similar.\n\n          In fact, the inverse transform of the subset XOR transform is the same as the forward transform. \n\n          But the problem: we are doing two identical passes? \n\n          Also, the condition is if j has the bit z, then we do something.\n\n          The standard for the forward transform is to iterate for each bit and for each j, and if j does not have the bit, then we update j|bit.\n\n          Here, the condition is if j has the bit, then we update something.\n\n          One common algorithm for the submask convolution is to use: \n\n             for i in range(0, 19):\n                 for j in range(0, 1<<19):\n                     if j has the i-th bit:\n                         a[j] ^= a[j without the bit]\n\n          then after this, the array a becomes the transform where a[j] = XOR_{i subset j} original_a[i] \n\n          which is exactly what we want.\n\n          Let me test on a small example: \n             size=4, a = [c0, c1, c2, c3]\n             after the transform, we want: \n                 d0 = c0\n                 d1 = c0 XOR c1\n                 d2 = c0 XOR c2\n                 d3 = c0 XOR c1 XOR c2 XOR c3\n\n          Algorithm:\n\n             for i in range(0,2):  # bits 0 and 1\n                 for j in range(0,4):\n                     if j has the bit i, then a[j] ^= a[j without the bit]\n\n          i=0 (bit0):\n             j=0: no -> skip\n             j=1: has bit0 -> a[1] ^= a[1-1]=a[0] -> a[1] = c1 ^ c0\n             j=2: no bit0 -> skip\n             j=3: has bit0 -> a[3] ^= a[2] -> a[3] = c3 ^ c2\n\n          i=1 (bit1=2):\n             j=0: no bit1 -> skip\n             j=1: no bit1 -> skip\n             j=2: has bit1 -> a[2] ^= a[0] -> a[2] = c2 ^ c0\n             j=3: has bit1 -> a[3] ^= a[1] -> a[3] = (c3^c2) ^ (c1^c0) = c0^c1^c2^c3\n\n          then a = [c0, c0^c1, c0^c2, c0^c1^c2^c3] -> which is exactly d.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n             for i in range(0, 19):\n                 bit = 1<<i\n                 for j in range(0, size):\n                     if j has the bit:\n                         a[j] ^= a[j - bit]   # or a[j ^ bit]\n\n          because j without the bit is j ^ bit.\n\n          But note: j might have other bits, but we are only removing one bit.\n\n          However, in the example, we did a[1] ^= a[0] (0 is 1 without bit0) and a[3] ^= a[2] (3 without bit0 is 2) in the first iteration.\n\n          In the second iteration, for bit1=2, we did a[2] ^= a[0] (2 without bit1 is 0) and a[3] ^= a[1] (3 without bit1 is 1).\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, the TODO is: \n\n             a[j] ^= a[j ^ z]\n\n          But note: the array a might be of length n, and j^z might be out of bounds? \n\n          We have ensured that the array a is of length at least j+1? \n\n          The array a is of length n, and j goes from 0 to n-1. But j^z might be greater than j or less, but it is certainly <= j | z, and since z is a bit, j^z is in [0, j|z]. \n\n          But if j|z >= n, then we will be accessing out of bounds.\n\n          Therefore, we must extend the array a to size (1<<19) initially.\n\n          The provided code does not do that. \n\n          We are only to fill in the TODO. \n\n          We can extend the array a before the loops? \n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code, and the missing code is only the TODO and possibly the extension if it is in the allowed region? \n\n          However, the TODO is only in the if block. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do the extension in the TODO by not doing anything if the index is out of bounds? \n\n          But the problem: the array a has length n, and we are iterating j in range(len(a)), so j is from 0 to n-1.\n\n          Then j^z might be up to (n-1) | z, which might be >= n, then a[j^z] is out of bounds.\n\n          Therefore, we must extend the array a to size (1<<19) at the beginning.\n\n          But the provided code does not have that. \n\n          Let me look at the provided code again: \n\n            a=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n\n          then the loops.\n\n          We can extend it in a separate line, but that is not in the TODO. \n\n          The problem: we are to output only the missing code, and the missing code might be the extension and the TODO. \n\n          But the output format is: \n            { \"program1\": \"...\", \"program2\": \"...\" }\n\n          and for program2, we are to output the completion for the TODO and possibly any additional missing code? \n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and we are to output the missing code.\n\n          The TODO is in the if block, but the extension is not in the TODO. \n\n          However, the provided code for program2.py is given as:\n\n            a=[*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n            for k in 0,1:\n                for i in range(19):\n                    z=1<<i\n                    for j in range(len(a)):\n                        if j&z:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n            print(*reversed(a))\n\n          We are allowed to add code before the TODO? \n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and we are to output the missing code. \n\n          We can output for program2: \n\n             \"a += [0]*(1<<19 - len(a))\\nfor k in 0,1:\\n    for i in range(19):\\n        z=1<<i\\n        for j in range(len(a)):\\n            if j&z:\\n                a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          but that would be the entire program almost.\n\n          Alternatively, note that the array a might be of length n, and we are iterating j in range(len(a)), and we extend a in the first iteration of the outer loop? \n\n          But the array a is not extended in the provided code.\n\n          Given the complexity, and that the intended solution might work without extension by only iterating on j for which j^ is in the range, we can do:\n\n             if (j^z) < len(a): \n                 a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n\n          otherwise, skip.\n\n          But is that correct? \n\n          In the algorithm, we only care about indices that are within the array. \n\n          However, if the array is not extended, then for j such that j>= (1<<19) we skip, but our n is only 500000, and 1<<19 is 524288, so we may need to extend to avoid missing indices.\n\n          But the array a has length n (<=500000), and we are only iterating j in [0, n-1]. For j in [0, n-1], j^z might be up to (1<<19) which is 524288, which is > n, so we will skip.\n\n          This will be incorrect.\n\n          Therefore, we must extend the array a to length 1<<19.\n\n          Since the problem allows us to output the missing code, and the missing code might be a block, we can do:\n\n             program2 = \"a += [0]*(1<<19 - len(a))\\n\"\n             then the rest of the code with the TODO filled.\n\n          But the TODO is only in the if block. \n\n          Alternatively, we can extend the array at the beginning, and then the TODO is simply: a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n\n          So for program2, the missing code is the extension and the TODO.\n\n          How about we do the extension in the TODO? \n\n          We cannot because the extension should be before the loops.\n\n          Given the instructions, I think we are allowed to add any missing code. \n\n          So for program2, we will output: \n\n             \"a += [0]*(1<<19 - len(a))\\nfor k in 0,1:\\n    for i in range(19):\\n        z=1<<i\\n        for j in range(len(a)):\\n            if j&z:\\n                a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          but wait, the code already has the for loops. We only need to add the extension and the TODO.\n\n          Specifically, we need to insert the extension before the loops.\n\n          and then in the TODO, we put: a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n\n          Therefore, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n             a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\n             for k in 0,1:\n                 for i in range(19):\n                     z=1<<i\n                     for j in range(len(a)):\n                         if j&z:\n                             a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n\n          but note: the code already has the for loops. We only need to add the extension and the one line in the TODO.\n\n          However, the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n          We are to output the missing code for program2 as a string.\n\n          The missing code is: \n             the extension line: \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\"\n             and in the TODO: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          But the extension is not in the TODO block. \n\n          We are to output exactly the code that is missing. \n\n          The given code has the for loops and the if, and we are to fill in the TODO inside the if.\n\n          The extension is not in the given code, so it is missing.\n\n          Therefore, we output for program2: \n\n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\\t\\t\\ta[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          but the newline and tabs might be platform-dependent.\n\n          Alternatively, we output the extension as a separate line before the loops, and then the TODO as \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\".\n\n          But the output should be a string that can be placed in the JSON.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify the format of the completion string, but it should be the exact code.\n\n          Let me write for program2: \n\n             missing_code = \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\"\n             and then in the TODO: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          But how to output both? \n\n          We can output: \n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\" \n             then the existing for loops are already in the given code, and then in the TODO: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          But the given code has the for loops. We are not to repeat them.\n\n          Therefore, for program2, the missing code consists of two parts: \n             Part1: before the loops: extend the array.\n             Part2: in the TODO: the XOR line.\n\n          But the output format is a string for the completion of program2.\n\n          We can output: \n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\nfor k in 0,1:\\n    for i in range(19):\\n        z=1<<i\\n        for j in range(len(a)):\\n            if j&z:\\n                a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          but that would be the entire code after the first line, and it would duplicate the given for loops.\n\n          Alternatively, we output only the extension and the TODO content, and assume that the for loops are already there.\n\n          The problem: the for loops are already in the given code. We only need to insert the extension before the loops and then in the TODO we put the XOR line.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2 is the extension line and the TODO content.\n\n          We can output: \n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\" \n             then the for loops are not to be output because they are given.\n\n          and then for the TODO, we output: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          But the output for program2 should be a string that represents the completion for the entire missing part.\n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we can output multiple lines.\n\n          Therefore, for program2, we output:\n\n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\\ta[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          but the TODO is in the inner loop.\n\n          Alternatively, we output two lines: one for the extension and one for the TODO, but the TODO is in the nested loops.\n\n          Given the complexity, and that the problem expects a string for program2, we output:\n\n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\"\n\n          for the extension, and then for the TODO in the if block, we output: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          but how to combine them? \n\n          We can output: \n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\"\n             then the for loops are given, and then in the TODO: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          So the string for program2 would be: \n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\" \n             and then later in the TODO: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          But the problem: the extension must be before the loops, and the TODO is inside the loops.\n\n          Therefore, we output two separate lines for the completion of program2? \n\n          The output format is a string. We can do:\n\n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\" \n             then during the TODO: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          as a string with a newline.\n\n          So: \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\na[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          But then when inserted, the second line would be inside the if block.\n\n          Specifically, the given code has:\n\n             for k in 0,1:\n                 for i in range(19):\n                     z=1<<i\n                     for j in range(len(a)):\n                         if j&z:\n                             # TODO\n\n          we will replace the TODO with the two-line string? \n\n          That would be:\n\n                             a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\n                             a[j] ^= a[j^z]\n\n          which is not what we want.\n\n          We want the extension before the outer for loop.\n\n          Therefore, we must output for program2 two parts: one for before the for loops and one for the TODO.\n\n          But the output format is a single string for program2.\n\n          We can output: \n             \"a += [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\"\n             then the for loops are already present, and then for the TODO we output: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          and hope that the first line is placed before the for loops.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify where the missing code is to be placed. \n\n          Given the instructions, I think we are to output the code that is missing, and it might be in two separate parts. \n\n          But the output format is a string. \n\n          Alternatively, we can output: \n             \"a = a + [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\"\n             and then in the TODO: \"a[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          and then when inserted, the first line will be at the beginning of the program, and the second line in the TODO.\n\n          But the given code has: \n             a = [*map(int,[*open(0)][1].split())]\n\n          then we want to extend a. \n\n          So we can do:\n\n             a = a + [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\n\n          after the first line.\n\n          Therefore, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n             program2 = \"a = a + [0]*((1<<19) - len(a))\\n\\ta[j] ^= a[j^z]\"\n\n          but the TODO is in the inner loop, and the first line should be after the assignment of a.\n\n          So in the given code, after the first line, we insert the extension, and then in the TODO we put the XOR line.\n\n          Therefore, the string for program2 is:"
