Operation2: swap index3 and index7: \n                    index3 (N) and index7 (B): \n                        1: B\n                        2: A\n                        3: B\n                        4: B -> no, index4 is B? \n                        5: A\n                        6: N\n                        7: N\n                        8: A\n                        9: N\n\n                    Then we have \"BAN\": B(1), A(2), N(6) -> still. We need a better idea. Insight: \n            We can break all the \"BAN\" by swapping the first d = ceil(n/2) 'A's with the last d 'N's? Specifically, for k from 0 to d-1:\n                swap the A in the (k+1)-th \"BAN\" (which is at position 3*k+2) with the N in the (n-k)-th \"BAN\" (which is at position 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k)). Example for n=3: d = ceil(3/2)=2.\n                k=0: swap the A in the first block (index2) with the N in the last block (index9) -> \n                    becomes: \n                        1: B\n                        2: N (from last block)\n                        3: N (from first block? but we swapped only index2 and index9) -> so index3 remains N?",

So we cannot get an N after the A. \n\n                    Therefore, no \"BAN\" subsequence. So the plan: \n                d = ceil(n/2) Then for k in range(d):\n                    swap the A in the k-th block (which is at position 3*k+2) with the N in the (n-k-1)-th block (which is at position 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k) - 3 + 3 = 3*(n-k)) But note: the positions are 1-indexed. The k-th block (0-indexed) has:\n                    B at 3*k+1\n                    A at 3*k+2\n                    N at 3*k+3\n\n                The (n-k-1)-th block (0-indexed) has:\n                    B at 3*(n-k-1)+1\n                    A at 3*(n-k-1)+2\n                    N at 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k) [because 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3n-3k-3+3 = 3n-3k = 3*(n-k)] So we swap positions (3*k+2) and (3*(n-k)). Example: \n                n=3, k=0: swap 3*0+2 = 2 and 3*(3-0) = 9 -> swap(2,9)\n                k=1: swap 3*1+2=5 and 3*(3-1)=6 -> swap(5,6)\n\n            But note: for k in [0, d-1] (d=2 for n=3). So the code for the TODO:\n\n                for _ in range(d):\n                    # We output the swap: \n                    print(f\"{3*i+2} {3*(n-i)}\")\n                    # But wait: we have variables i and j? \n                    # The code sets i=1, j=3*n. But we don't use j? Actually, the code sets i=1 and j=3*n. But we are not using them?",

So the swap for k=1: we swap the A in the second block (which is at 5) with the N in the second block (which is at 6). But note: the problem says: swap two distinct indices. This is valid. Therefore, the code for the TODO:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    # We are going to swap 3*k+2 and 3*(n-k)\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But note: the variable names: the code has a for loop that runs d times, and we have i and j defined as i=1, j=3*n. We are not using them? Why did the code set i=1 and j=3*n?",

But the last block for n=1 is the only block. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                For k in range(d):\n                    if n==1:\n                        # then we swap 1 and 2\n                    else:\n                        swap 3*k+2 and 3*(n-k) But the problem says: we want a general solution. Another idea: \n                We can swap the A in the k-th block with the N in the (n-k-1)-th block, but for the first block we can also consider swapping the B and the A? \n\n            But note: the minimum number of operations is d=ceil(n/2).

But the loop is written as: \n            for _ in range(d): So we are using the same variable _. Therefore, it's valid. But note: the variable _ is used in the for loop. We are using it in the print. So we are good. However, let me check the entire program2 for n=3:\n\n            d=math.ceil(3/2)=2\n            print(d)   # prints 2\n            i=1\n            j=3*n   # 9\n            for _ in range(d):\n                print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))   # for _=0: 2, 9; for _=1: 5, 6\n\n        Output:\n            2\n            2 9\n            5 6\n\n        Which is the required. Therefore, we are done. But note: the problem says: the total operations must be at most 10^5, and d=ceil(n/2) and n<=100, so d<=50, which is safe. So the answer is:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"} However, note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"",

So the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"break\"\n            program2: \"print(str(3*_+2) + ' ' + str(3*(n-_)))\"   ??? But the problem says: we can simply output: \n            print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n        Because the print function by default prints with a space. So we output: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))",

Suffix: \n        reversed array: [1,1]\n        idx0: s=1 -> in d? yes. Then r = 0+1 + d[1] = 1+1 = 2.\n        idx1: s=2 -> in d? no. Then r remains 2.\n    Output: 2 -> correct. Another sample: [1,2,1]\n        total = 4, x=2.\n        Prefix: \n            idx0: s=1 -> store d[1]=1. idx1: s=3 -> 3>2 -> break.

Output: 2. But the expected answer? Alice: [1] (weight=1), Bob: [1] (the last candy, weight=1) -> total candies=2. Also, we can have Alice take [1,2] (weight=3) and Bob take [2,1] (weight=3) -> but wait, the candy in the middle is taken by both? No, they cannot. Actually, if Alice takes [1,2] (candies 0 and 1) and Bob takes [2,1] (candies 1 and 2) -> they both take candy1? That's not allowed. How about Alice takes [1] (candy0) and Bob takes [1] (candy2) -> total=2. Or Alice takes [1,2] (candies0,1) and Bob takes [1] (candy2) -> then Alice=3, Bob=1 -> not equal. Or Alice takes [1] and Bob takes [2,1] -> Alice=1, Bob=3 -> not equal. So the answer is 2.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code so that it solves the candy problem.\n\nThe problem: \nThere are t test cases. For each test case, we are given n and a list of n integers (weights of candies).\nAlice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot skip candies. They want the total weight eaten by Alice to equal that eaten by Bob, and they want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nWe note that the total weight eaten by both must be at most half the total weight of all candies (because they are equal and non-overlapping). However, the problem is to maximize the total number of candies (so we are looking for the maximum k such that there exists a prefix of length i and a suffix of length j (with i+j = k) such that the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix, and we want the maximum k).\n\nThe provided code does:\n1. Reads t test cases.\n2. For each test case, reads n and the list a.\n3. Computes x = total sum of a divided by 2 (so the maximum possible common weight is x).\n4. Then it builds a dictionary d: \n   It iterates through the array, accumulating the prefix sum s. For each prefix sum, it maps s to the number of candies (index+1). However, note the condition: \n        if s > x: \n            break   # because we cannot have a prefix sum exceeding x (since then the suffix would have to match that, but the total would exceed the entire array? Actually, note: the prefix and suffix are disjoint, so the maximum common weight they can have is at most total/2. So if the prefix sum exceeds x, we break because we cannot form a matching suffix that also has the same sum without exceeding the total? Actually, we break because we don't need to consider prefixes that are already too big.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total of the entire array might be odd, so we are only concerned with matching sums that are at most total/2. However, the condition breaks when s > x, but note that x is total//2 (integer division). Since the weights are integers, the common sum must be an integer. So we break to avoid unnecessary computation.\n\nBut wait: what if the prefix sum is exactly x? Then we can have a matching suffix? However, note that the entire array might be partitioned such that the prefix and suffix meet in the middle? But the problem says they cannot overlap. So we are building a dictionary of prefix sums (and the number of candies) for all prefixes that do not exceed x.\n\nThen, the code does:\n   s = 0\n   r = 0\n   Then iterates the array from the right (suffix), and for each suffix sum s (which is the sum of the last idx+1 candies, but note we are going from right to left), it checks if s is in the dictionary d. If it is, then we have a candidate: the total candies eaten would be (d[s] from the prefix) + (idx+1 from the suffix). We take the maximum r.\n\nHowever, note: the prefix and suffix must be disjoint. The dictionary d was built for the entire prefix until the prefix sum exceeds x. But when we check a suffix sum s, we are effectively looking for a prefix that has the same sum. But note: the entire array is fixed. The prefix and suffix must not overlap. How do we ensure that? The dictionary d was built for the entire prefix from the left, and we are building the suffix from the right. The condition that the prefix and suffix do not overlap is naturally taken care of by the fact that we break the prefix when the sum exceeds x (which is half the total). However, what if the prefix and suffix meet in the middle? Then the indices would not overlap? Actually, we must ensure that the prefix and suffix do not cover the same candy. The problem says: if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. So the prefix and suffix must be disjoint.\n\nBut note: the way we are building the prefix and suffix: the prefix starts at the very left and goes to the right, the suffix starts at the very right and goes to the left. They are disjoint as long as the prefix part does not extend beyond the suffix part. However, in our candidate, we are adding the number of candies in the prefix and the suffix. This total might exceed n? But note: if they are disjoint, then the total candies eaten is the sum of the two. But we must ensure that the prefix and suffix do not overlap. How? The condition that the prefix sum and suffix sum are equal and the entire array is fixed: the prefix and suffix must be disjoint if the prefix ends before the suffix starts. However, in our method, we are not checking the indices. We are just adding the counts. This might lead to overlapping if the prefix and suffix together cover the entire array and then some? Actually, the problem does not require that the entire array is contiguous? But note: the candies are in a row. The prefix is from the left and the suffix from the right. They are disjoint if the last index of the prefix is strictly less than the first index of the suffix. \n\nBut in our candidate: \n   We have a prefix of length L (candies 0 to L-1) and a suffix of length R (candies n-R to n-1). They are disjoint if L <= n-R. But note: the problem does not require that the entire array is covered? They can leave some candies in the middle. So we must have L + R <= n? Actually, the condition is that the prefix and suffix do not share any candy. So the last index of the prefix must be < the first index of the suffix. That is: L-1 < n-R. So L <= n-R-1? Actually, the suffix starts at index n-R and goes to n-1. The prefix ends at L-1. We require L-1 < n-R, i.e., L+R <= n.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that we leave the middle candies? We can leave them. So we are allowed to have L+R <= n.\n\nHowever, in our candidate, we are not checking the indices. We are just adding the counts. How do we know that L+R <= n? \n\nActually, the condition that the prefix sum and suffix sum are equal and the entire array has total sum = T, then the common sum s must be at most T/2. And we break the prefix when the sum exceeds T/2. Similarly, the suffix we build until the sum exceeds T/2? But note: we are building the suffix only until we have a match? Actually, we are iterating the entire suffix? But we break when we have a match? No, we don't break. We just update r every time we see a match. But note: we are iterating the entire suffix? Actually, we are iterating from the last candy to the first. We start with s=0 and then add the next candy from the right. We check for each suffix. But we break when? We don't break. So we might get a candidate that has L+R > n? \n\nBut note: the condition that the prefix and suffix are disjoint is enforced by the fact that if the prefix and suffix overlap, then the same candy would be counted twice? However, we are building the prefix from the left and the suffix from the right. The dictionary d was built for the entire prefix until the prefix sum exceeds T/2. Then we build the suffix from the right until we have covered the entire array? But note: the condition that the prefix and suffix are disjoint is not explicitly checked. \n\nHowever, observe: if we have a prefix of L candies and a suffix of R candies, and if L+R > n, then they must overlap. Therefore, we must avoid such cases. But note: the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. So we must have L+R <= n. \n\nBut in our candidate, we are only considering prefix sums that are at most T/2 and suffix sums that are at most T/2? And the entire array has total T. So if we have a prefix of L and a suffix of R, then the sum of the prefix is s and the suffix is s, so the total eaten is 2*s. This must be <= T. And we break the prefix when s > T/2, so s<=T/2. Similarly, the suffix we build until we have s<=T/2? Actually, we don't break the suffix? But note: the suffix we are building from the right: we start at the last element and go to the first. We add until we have s > T/2? The code does not break the suffix. \n\nBut note: the problem says the total of the entire array is T. The suffix we are building: the first element we take is the last candy, then the last two, etc. The suffix sum can become large? However, if the suffix sum becomes greater than T/2, then we might get a match with a prefix that is also > T/2? But we broke the prefix at T/2. So we only consider suffix sums that are at most T/2? Actually, no: we break the prefix when the prefix sum exceeds T/2, but the suffix we are building without breaking. However, if the suffix sum becomes greater than T/2, then we are still checking the dictionary d which only has keys for prefix sums <= T/2. So if the suffix sum s is greater than T/2, then we won't find it in d? So we can break the suffix as well? Actually, we can break the suffix when the suffix sum exceeds T/2? Because then we cannot have a matching prefix (since the prefix sums we have are only up to T/2). \n\nBut note: the problem does not require that we break the suffix? The current code does not break. However, we can break the suffix as well to save time? But the constraints say the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so it's acceptable to iterate the entire suffix? But we can break when s > T//2? \n\nBut note: the problem says the total of the entire array is T. The suffix we are building: if we have taken R candies from the right, then the suffix sum is the sum of the last R candies. The prefix we have built for L from the left. The condition for disjointness: we require that the prefix and suffix do not overlap. But note: if we have a candidate with prefix L and suffix R, then we require L+R <= n. And the sum of the prefix and suffix is 2*s. This must be <= T. So s <= T/2. Therefore, we can break the suffix when s > T//2? \n\nBut note: what if the entire array is such that the suffix sum becomes T//2 exactly? Then we break? Actually, we should break after we have passed T//2? But we want to record the suffix sums that are exactly T//2? So we should break when s > T//2? \n\nHowever, the current code does not break the suffix. We can add that for efficiency? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are iterating each test case only once. But note: the worst-case for one test case is n=200000, and we are doing two passes (prefix and suffix). So it's O(n). But if we break the suffix when s > T//2, then we break early? \n\nBut the problem does not require that. However, the provided code does not have that break. \n\nBut look at the provided code: \n   s, r = 0, 0\n   for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: r = idx + 1 + d[s]\n\nWe are updating r every time we see a match. We are not breaking. \n\nBut note: we want the maximum total candies? However, if we have multiple matches, we take the one that maximizes the total candies? Actually, we are updating r to the latest match? But note: we are iterating from the last candy to the first. The suffix starts with the last candy (idx=0 in the reversed array, which corresponds to the last candy) and then adds the next to last, etc. So the suffix length is increasing. And we are updating r to the current suffix length plus the prefix length (d[s]) whenever we see a match. But note: we want the maximum total candies? So we should take the maximum r over all matches? But the code currently does: \n        if s in d: r = idx + 1 + d[s]\n\nThis sets r to the current candidate. But if we have a later (in the reversed iteration) match that has a larger total? Actually, the suffix length is increasing as we iterate. So the total candies (prefix length + suffix length) is increasing? Not necessarily: because the prefix length for a given sum s might be different? Actually, the dictionary d stores the earliest occurrence of the prefix sum? Or the last occurrence? \n\nLook at the prefix building:\n   for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n        s += i\n        if s > x: \n            break   # but note: we break, so we don't record the prefix for s that exceeds x? Actually, we break and then stop building the prefix.\n        d[s] = idx + 1   # this records the last prefix that has sum s? Actually, if we have the same prefix sum twice? But the prefix sums are strictly increasing? Because all weights are positive. So each prefix sum is unique? \n\nTherefore, for a given s, we have only one prefix length: the first time we achieve that sum? Actually, we are overwriting: if we get the same sum again? But we can't because the array has positive integers. So the prefix sums are strictly increasing. Therefore, for each s, we have one prefix length: the one when we first reached s? Actually, we are storing the last time we reached s? But we are traversing from left to right and the sums are increasing. So we store the smallest prefix length that achieves s? Actually, no: we store the prefix length (which is the index+1) for the current prefix. And we are updating d[s] for every prefix. But since the prefix sums are increasing, we will only set d[s] once? Actually, no: we might have the same s? But the weights are positive, so the prefix sums are distinct? \n\nWait: the weights are positive, so the prefix sums are strictly increasing. Therefore, each s is unique. So we store the prefix length for that s.\n\nNow, in the suffix: we start from the right and the suffix sums are also strictly increasing? So we will see each s at most once. And we update r to the current candidate: which is (suffix length) + (prefix length for the same s). \n\nBut note: we want the maximum total candies? So we should take the maximum candidate over all matches? The current code sets r to the last match? But the suffix is built from the last candy to the first. The suffix length is increasing: the first candy we take (the last candy) gives suffix length 1, then 2, etc. So the total candies (prefix length + suffix length) for a fixed s: the prefix length is fixed (because s is fixed) and the suffix length is increasing? Actually, no: for a fixed s, the prefix length is fixed (d[s] is fixed). But we are iterating the suffix and we might get the same s multiple times? But the suffix sums are strictly increasing? So we get each s at most once. \n\nTherefore, we are updating r to the candidate for the current s. But we want the maximum candidate? So we should do:\n        if s in d: \n            candidate = idx + 1 + d[s]\n            if candidate > r: r = candidate\n\nBut the current code just sets r to the candidate. And if we have multiple matches, the last one (with the largest suffix length) will be the one that sets r? But note: the suffix length is increasing as we iterate. So the last match we find (with the largest suffix length) will have the largest total? Not necessarily: because the prefix length for a larger suffix sum might be smaller? \n\nBut note: the prefix and suffix are independent. We are matching the same s. For a fixed s, the prefix length is fixed (d[s] is fixed). So the total candies for that s is fixed: d[s] + (the suffix length that gives s). But the suffix length that gives s is the number of candies from the right that sum to s. And that is fixed? Actually, we are iterating the suffix: we start from the last candy and add one by one. The suffix sum s is achieved at a specific suffix length. So for each s, we have one candidate: d[s] + (the suffix length that gives s). \n\nTherefore, we can update r to the maximum candidate over all s. But the current code does:\n        if s in d: r = idx + 1 + d[s]\n\nThis sets r to the candidate for the current s. But if we have multiple matches, we want the maximum candidate? However, the code does not compare with previous candidates. It just sets r to the last candidate we see. \n\nBut note: the suffix sums are increasing. The suffix length (which is idx+1) is increasing. And the prefix length d[s] is fixed for a given s. So the candidate for a given s is fixed. And we are iterating from the smallest suffix (one candy) to the entire array? But we break the suffix when s > x? Actually, we don't break. \n\nBut note: the candidate for a larger suffix length might be larger? But for a fixed s, the candidate is fixed. However, we might have two different s that both are in d? Then we want the candidate that maximizes the total candies. But the current code overwrites r to the last candidate. \n\nTherefore, we should change the code to:\n        if s in d: \n            candidate = idx + 1 + d[s]\n            if candidate > r:\n                r = candidate\n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do this.\n\nAlternatively, we can break the suffix when s > x? Because then we won't get any more matches? Since the prefix sums we have are only up to x. So we can break the suffix when s > x? \n\nBut note: the suffix might have a sum that is exactly x? Then we break after that? Actually, we can break after we have passed x? \n\nBut the problem does not require that. However, we can do:\n\n   s, r = 0, 0\n   for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s > x: \n            break\n        if s in d: \n            candidate = idx + 1 + d[s]\n            if candidate > r:\n                r = candidate\n\nBut note: the prefix dictionary d might have keys that are less than or equal to x. And the suffix we break when s > x. So we are safe.\n\nBut the original code did not break. However, the problem constraints say the total n over test cases is 200000, so even if we don't break, it's acceptable. But breaking early might be better.\n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000. So we can do without the break? But why not break? \n\nSo the missing part in program1.py is the break condition in the prefix building? Actually, the provided code has:\n\n        if s > x: \n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWhat should we put? The original code breaks? Actually, the problem says: we break the prefix building when the prefix sum exceeds x. So we break. \n\nBut the code already has:\n        if s > x: \n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe should break? \n\nSo we put:\n        if s > x: \n            break\n\nBut note: we are building the prefix. We break when the prefix sum becomes greater than x. Then we stop building the prefix dictionary.\n\nAlso, in the suffix part, we should break when s > x? But the suffix part does not have a break. However, the problem does not require that. But we can add it? But the problem says: output only the missing code. The missing code is only in the TODO part? \n\nLooking at the provided code for program1.py:\n\n    s, d = 0, {}\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n        s += i\n        if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n        d[s] = idx + 1\n\nWe are missing the code for the if block. We should break? \n\nBut note: what if the prefix sum becomes exactly x? Then we record it and then the next one might exceed? So we break when s > x? \n\nSo we do:\n        if s > x: \n            break\n\nBut then we do not record the prefix that is exactly x? Actually, we record the prefix at the current step (s) and then the next step we break? But if s becomes greater than x, we break without recording the next step? But we have already recorded the current s? Actually, the current s is the one that made s > x? But we are at the current step: we have added the current candy and now s is the new sum. We check if s > x -> then we break. But we have already stored d[s] for this s? But if s > x, we don't want to store it? Because we are only interested in prefix sums <= x? \n\nSo we should break before storing? Actually, the code does:\n\n        s += i\n        if s > x: \n            # TODO: Your code here\n        d[s] = idx + 1\n\nSo if s > x, we break and skip the storing? But then we break and do not store the current s? But we don't want to store s that is > x? \n\nBut note: we break and then we do not store the current s? Actually, the storing is after the if block. So if we break, we skip the storing. But we have already computed s and it is > x. We break and leave the loop. \n\nBut what if we break in the middle? Then we don't store the current s? That is correct because we don't want prefix sums that exceed x.\n\nBut what if the prefix sum becomes exactly x? Then we store it. Then the next candy we add: s becomes s + next_candy, which is > x? Then we break and stop. \n\nSo the code for the prefix part:\n\n    s, d = 0, {}\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n        s += i\n        if s > x: \n            break\n        d[s] = idx + 1\n\nBut note: what if the entire prefix is <= x? Then we don't break and we store all.\n\nNow, for the suffix part: we are not breaking? But we can break when s > x? However, the problem does not require that. But the provided code does not have a break in the suffix. And the TODO is only in the prefix part? \n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. So we only complete the prefix part? \n\nBut note: the suffix part might be incomplete? The problem says: the provided code for program1.py has a TODO in the prefix part. \n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is: \n        if s > x: \n            break\n\nBut wait: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". And the TODO is in the if block. So we write: \"break\"\n\nBut note: the code after the if block is d[s] = idx+1. We don't want to do that if s > x? So we break and skip the storing.\n\nNow, what about the suffix part? The current code for the suffix part does not break. But we can break when s > x? However, the problem does not require that. But the provided code does not have a TODO in the suffix part. So we leave it as is? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we only output the break for the prefix.\n\nBut wait: the suffix part might be improved? But the problem does not require that. And the provided code for the suffix part is:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: r = idx + 1 + d[s]\n    print(r)\n\nBut we want the maximum r? So we should update r to the maximum candidate? \n\nBut the current code sets r to the last candidate. We should set r to the maximum candidate? \n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are iterating the suffix from the last candy to the first. The suffix length is increasing. And the candidate for a fixed s is fixed. But we might have a candidate that appears early and then a candidate that appears later with a larger total? \n\nActually, the total candies for a candidate is (prefix length) + (suffix length). The suffix length is increasing as we iterate. But the prefix length for a given s is fixed. So if we have two different s1 and s2 that are both in d, and we see s1 first (with suffix length L1) and then s2 (with suffix length L2) and L2>L1, then the candidate for s2 is d[s2] + L2 and for s1 is d[s1] + L1. We don't know which is larger. \n\nTherefore, we should update r to the maximum candidate we see. \n\nBut the current code does not do that. It sets r to the last candidate. \n\nSo we should change the suffix part to:\n\n        if s in d: \n            candidate = idx + 1 + d[s]\n            if candidate > r:\n                r = candidate\n\nBut the problem says: the provided code is given and we are only to fill in the missing lines. The suffix part does not have a TODO? So we cannot change it? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". And the provided code has a TODO only in the prefix part. \n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we are only allowed to output the missing code for the TODO? \n\nBut then the program might not be correct? \n\nLet me test with the sample: \n    Test case: n=2, weights = [1,1]\n    Total sum = 2, x = 1.\n    Prefix: \n        idx0: s=1 -> store d[1]=1.\n        idx1: s=2 -> 2>1 -> break.\n    Suffix: \n        reversed array: [1,1]\n        idx0: s=1 -> in d? yes. Then r = 0+1 + d[1] = 1+1 = 2.\n        idx1: s=2 -> in d? no. Then r remains 2.\n    Output: 2 -> correct.\n\n    Another sample: [1,2,1]\n        total = 4, x=2.\n        Prefix: \n            idx0: s=1 -> store d[1]=1.\n            idx1: s=3 -> 3>2 -> break. (so we don't store s=3 and stop)\n        Suffix:\n            reversed: [1,2,1]\n            idx0: s=1 -> in d? yes -> candidate = 1 (suffix length) + d[1] (which is 1) = 2 -> r=2.\n            idx1: s=1+2=3 -> 3>2? we don't break? but we check: 3 in d? no -> skip.\n            idx2: s=3+1=4 -> 4>2 -> but we don't break? and 4 not in d -> skip.\n        Output: 2.\n\n        But the expected answer? \n            Alice: [1] (weight=1), Bob: [1] (the last candy, weight=1) -> total candies=2. \n            Also, we can have Alice take [1,2] (weight=3) and Bob take [2,1] (weight=3) -> but wait, the candy in the middle is taken by both? No, they cannot. \n            Actually, if Alice takes [1,2] (candies 0 and 1) and Bob takes [2,1] (candies 1 and 2) -> they both take candy1? That's not allowed.\n\n        How about Alice takes [1] (candy0) and Bob takes [1] (candy2) -> total=2.\n        Or Alice takes [1,2] (candies0,1) and Bob takes [1] (candy2) -> then Alice=3, Bob=1 -> not equal.\n        Or Alice takes [1] and Bob takes [2,1] -> Alice=1, Bob=3 -> not equal.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        But what if we try: \n            Alice: [1] (candy0) -> weight=1\n            Bob: [1] (candy2) -> weight=1 -> total=2.\n\n        Or: \n            Alice: [1,2] -> weight=3 -> too big? because then Bob would have to have weight 3? but the only candy left is the last one? weight=1 -> not enough.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        But what about: \n            Alice: [1] (candy0) -> weight=1\n            Bob: [1] (candy2) -> weight=1 -> total=2.\n\n        How about: \n            Alice: [1,2,1] -> but then Bob has nothing? and they are not equal.\n\n        So the answer is 2.\n\n        But the sample in the note: \n            \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2.\"\n\n        So our program outputs 2.\n\n        However, what if we have [1,3,1,1]?\n            total = 6, x=3.\n            Prefix:\n                idx0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                idx1: s=1+3=4 -> 4>3 -> break. (so we don't store s=4 and stop)\n            Suffix:\n                reversed: [1,1,3,1]\n                idx0: s=1 -> candidate: 1 (suffix length) + d[1] (1) = 2 -> r=2.\n                idx1: s=1+1=2 -> in d? no -> skip.\n                idx2: s=2+3=5 -> 5>3 -> but we don't break? and 5 not in d -> skip.\n                idx3: s=5+1=6 -> skip.\n            Output: 2.\n\n            But what if:\n                Alice: [1] (candy0) -> 1\n                Bob: [1] (candy3) -> 1 -> total=2.\n\n            Or:\n                Alice: [1,3] -> 4 -> too big? because then Bob would need 4? but the two rightmost are 1 and 1 -> only 2.\n\n            Or:\n                Alice: [1] (candy0) -> 1\n                Bob: [1,1] (candies 3 and 2) -> 2 -> not equal.\n\n            Or:\n                Alice: [1,3] -> 4 -> too big.\n\n            Or:\n                Alice: [1] (candy0) -> 1\n                Bob: [1] (candy3) -> 1 -> total=2.\n\n            But wait: \n                Alice: [1] (candy0) -> 1\n                Bob: [1] (candy2) -> 1 -> but candy2 is the third? then the suffix of length 2: [1,1] (candies 2 and 3) -> but we can take a suffix of length 1: the last candy (candy3) -> that's 1.\n\n            How about:\n                Alice: [1,3] -> 4 -> not allowed because then Bob would have to have 4? but the entire array is 1,3,1,1 -> Bob can only take the last two: 1+1=2 -> not 4.\n\n            How about:\n                Alice: [1] (candy0) -> 1\n                Bob: [1] (candy3) -> 1 -> total=2.\n\n            Or:\n                Alice: [1] (candy0) -> 1\n                Bob: [1] (candy2) -> 1 -> total=2? but then candy3 is left? but Bob can only take contiguous from the right? He must take the last candy? Actually, he can take any contiguous suffix? He can take the last candy, or the last two, etc. But he cannot skip candy3 to take candy2? Because the candies are contiguous. He must take from the right without skipping. So he can take [candy3] or [candy2, candy3] or [candy1, candy2, candy3] or [candy0, candy1, candy2, candy3]? But candy0 is already taken by Alice? So he cannot take candy0. So he can take [candy3] or [candy2, candy3] or [candy1, candy2, candy3]? But candy1 is the second candy? \n\n            But note: the problem says: Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row). So he must take a contiguous block at the right. So if he takes candy2 and candy3, that's contiguous. But then the candy1 (which is the second candy) is not taken by anyone? That's allowed.\n\n            So Bob can take [candy2, candy3] -> total weight=1+1=2. Then Alice has 1. Not equal.\n\n            How about Bob takes only candy2? But that's not contiguous from the right? The rightmost is candy3. So he must take candy3? Then if he wants to take candy2, he must also take candy3? \n\n            So the only possibilities for Bob: \n                [candy3] -> weight=1\n                [candy2, candy3] -> weight=2\n                [candy1, candy2, candy3] -> weight=3+1+1=5 -> too big? but then Alice has taken candy0, so Bob cannot take candy1? Actually, the problem says: if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it. So Bob cannot take candy0 and candy1? But candy0 is taken by Alice, so Bob cannot take candy0. But candy1 is available? Bob can take candy1, candy2, candy3? But then the total weight is 3+1+1=5. \n\n            Then we have Alice=1, Bob=5 -> not equal.\n\n            How about Alice takes nothing? Then Bob can take the entire array? But then Alice=0, Bob=6 -> not equal.\n\n            How about Alice takes [1,3] (candy0 and candy1) -> weight=4. Then Bob can take [candy3] (weight=1) -> not equal. Or Bob takes [candy2, candy3] (weight=2) -> not equal. Or Bob takes [candy1, candy2, candy3] -> but candy1 is already taken by Alice -> not allowed.\n\n            How about Alice takes [1] (candy0) and Bob takes [1] (candy3) -> total=2.\n\n            Or Alice takes [1] (candy0) and Bob takes [1,1] (candy2 and candy3) -> then Bob has 2, Alice has 1 -> not equal.\n\n            How about Alice takes [1,3] (candy0 and candy1) -> 4, and Bob takes nothing? -> not equal.\n\n            How about Alice takes nothing and Bob takes [1] (candy3) -> 0 and 1 -> not equal.\n\n            So the only possibility is 2.\n\n            Therefore, the program outputs 2.\n\n        But what if we have [1,2,3,3,2,1]? \n            total=12, x=6.\n            Prefix:\n                1: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                2: s=1+2=3 -> d[3]=2\n                3: s=3+3=6 -> d[6]=3 -> then next: 6+3=9>6 -> break.\n            Suffix:\n                reversed: [1,2,3,3,2,1]\n                s=1 -> candidate: 1 (suffix length) + d.get(1,0) -> if exists: 1+1=2 -> r=2.\n                s=1+2=3 -> candidate: 2 + d[3] (which is 2) = 4 -> r=4.\n                s=3+3=6 -> candidate: 3 + d[6] (which is 3) = 6 -> r=6.\n                then we break? because we don't have a break? but we continue: \n                s=6+3=9 -> skip (because 9>6) -> but we don't break? \n                then s=9+2=11 -> skip\n                then s=11+1=12 -> skip.\n            Output: 6.\n\n            Is 6 valid? \n                Alice: [1,2,3] -> weight=6\n                Bob: [1,2,3] (the last three: which are [3,2,1]? but wait: the last three: the last candy is 1, then 2, then 3? but the array is [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> the last three: [1,2,3]? but that's not contiguous? \n                Actually, the suffix: Bob must take contiguous from the right. The last three: the last candy is the 6th (1), the 5th (2), the 4th (3). So the suffix is [3,2,1]? which is the 4th,5th,6th? weight=3+2+1=6. \n                And the prefix: the first three: [1,2,3] -> weight=6.\n                And they are disjoint? The prefix is indices0,1,2 and the suffix is indices3,4,5 -> disjoint. \n                Total candies: 6.\n\n            So the answer is 6.\n\n        Therefore, the program is correct.\n\n        But note: in the suffix part, we break when s>6? Then we would break after the third suffix candy? So we would not see the candidate for s=6? \n\n        Actually, we break after we add the fourth candy? But we break when s>6. After the third candy, s=6 -> we don't break. Then we add the fourth candy (which is the third from the left? in the reversed array, the next candy is the 3rd from the right? which is the 3rd element in the original array? which is 3). Then s=6+3=9 -> then we break? \n\n        But we have already processed the candidate for s=6? \n\n        So we can break the suffix when s>6? \n\n        But the problem does not require that. However, we can do it for efficiency? \n\n        But the provided code does not have a TODO in the suffix part. So we don't change it.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: \n            break\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we output the break.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        So for program1, we output the string: \"break\"\n\n        But note: the code block is:\n\n            if s > x: \n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to put the break at the TODO. So the missing code is the line \"break\".\n\n        But what about indentation? The break should be indented? \n\n        We output the string: \"        break\" ? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output the line that is missing: \"break\", but we must consider the indentation level? \n\n        The TODO is inside the for loop and inside the if block. The current code has:\n\n            if s > x: \n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We should replace the TODO line with \"break\". But the TODO line is a comment. We remove the comment and put \"break\". \n\n        So the missing code for program1 is: \"break\"\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output a string. \n\n        However, the problem also says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So we output the exact line that should replace the TODO.\n\n        But the TODO is on a line by itself? We are replacing the entire line? \n\n        Actually, the TODO is in the middle of the code. The code is:\n\n            if s > x: \n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We want to replace the TODO line with \"break\", so the code becomes:\n\n            if s > x: \n                break\n\n        So the missing block for program1 is the string \"break\".\n\n        But note: the problem says \"blocks\", so if it were multiple lines, we would output multiple lines. Here, one line.\n\n        So for program1: \"break\"\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nDescription: \nWe are given t test cases. For each test case, an integer n. \nWe define s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. \nWe can swap any two distinct indices any number of times. \nWe want the string \"BAN\" to not appear as a subsequence. \nWe want the minimum number of operations and one such sequence.\n\nThe provided code:\n    if n==1:\n        print(\"1\")\n        print(\"1 2\")\n    elif n==2:\n        print(\"1\")\n        print(\"2 6\")\n    else:\n        d=math.ceil(n/2)\n        print(d)\n        i=1\n        j=3*n\n        for _ in range(d):\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to complete the TODO.\n\nThe sample: \n    n=1: we swap indices 1 and 2 -> \"ABN\" -> no \"BAN\" as subsequence? \n        How is \"BAN\" a subsequence? In \"ABN\": \n            B is at index2? then A is at index1 (which is before index2) -> then we cannot form \"BAN\" because we need B then A then N? \n        Actually, to form \"BAN\": \n            We need a 'B' then an 'A' then an 'N'. In \"ABN\": \n                We have A, then B, then N. \n                We cannot get B then A because the B is after the A. \n            So it's safe.\n\n    n=2: we swap indices 2 and 6. \n        s(2) = \"BANBAN\" -> indices: \n            1: 'B'\n            2: 'A'\n            3: 'N'\n            4: 'B'\n            5: 'A'\n            6: 'N'\n        Swap index2 and index6: \n            becomes: \n                index1: 'B'\n                index2: 'N' (from index6)\n                index3: 'N' -> wait, no: \n                Actually, we swap the character at index2 (which is 'A') and index6 (which is 'N'). \n                So: \n                    index1: 'B'\n                    index2: 'N'\n                    index3: 'N' -> no, index3 remains 'N'? \n                    index4: 'B'\n                    index5: 'A'\n                    index6: 'A'\n                So the string: \"B\" (1), \"N\" (2), \"N\" (3), \"B\" (4), \"A\" (5), \"A\" (6) -> \"BNNBAA\"\n\n        Now, check if \"BAN\" is a subsequence: \n            We need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N'. \n            We can take the first 'B' (index1), then the first 'A' after that? The next A is at index5. Then we need an 'N' after index5? The only N are at index2 and 3, which are before index5. So we cannot form \"BAN\". \n\n        So it works.\n\n    For n>=3: \n        The code sets d = ceil(n/2) and prints d. \n        Then sets i=1, j=3*n (which are the first and last indices? 1-indexed).\n        Then for _ in range(d): \n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n        What to do? \n\n        The problem says: we want the minimum number of operations. The sample for n=1:1, n=2:1, and for n=3: ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n        How to do it? \n\n        Idea: \n            We note that the string s(n) = \"BAN\" * n. \n            The problem is that we have many \"BAN\" as contiguous blocks. \n\n            We want to break every occurrence of \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n\n            But note: we don't have to break every occurrence? We just need to make sure that there is no subsequence \"BAN\". \n\n            How can we break it? \n                The subsequence \"BAN\" requires: \n                    a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N' in that order.\n\n            We can swap some letters to break the pattern.\n\n            Observation: \n                If we swap the 'A' in each \"BAN\" with the 'N' in some other \"BAN\", then we might break two at once? \n\n            Example for n=3: \n                Original: BANBANBAN\n\n                We can do:\n                    Operation1: swap the first 'A' (index2) with the last 'N' (index9) -> \n                        becomes: B N N B A B A A N? \n                        Let me do:\n                            Initially: \n                                1: B\n                                2: A\n                                3: N\n                                4: B\n                                5: A\n                                6: N\n                                7: B\n                                8: A\n                                9: N\n\n                            Swap index2 and index9: \n                                index2 becomes N (from index9)\n                                index9 becomes A (from index2)\n                                So:\n                                    1: B\n                                    2: N\n                                    3: N\n                                    4: B\n                                    5: A\n                                    6: N\n                                    7: B\n                                    8: A\n                                    9: A\n\n                        Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n                            We can take:\n                                first B (index1), then the first A after index1: at index5, then the first N after index5: at index3? -> but index3 is before index5? \n                            How about: \n                                first B (index1), then A at index5, then N at index6? -> that's \"B\" (1), \"A\" (5), \"N\" (6) -> \"BAN\" -> still present.\n\n                Operation2: swap the second 'A' (index5) with the last 'A' (index8) -> but that doesn't help? \n\n            Alternate idea: \n                We can swap the 'B' of the first block with the 'N' of the last block? \n                    Swap index1 and index9: \n                        index1: N (from index9)\n                        index9: B (from index1)\n                        String: \n                            1: N\n                            2: A\n                            3: N\n                            4: B\n                            5: A\n                            6: N\n                            7: B\n                            8: A\n                            9: B\n\n                        Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n                            We need a B, then an A, then an N. \n                            The B's are at indices4,7,9. \n                            For the B at index4: \n                                Then we need an A after index4: we have A at index2? -> but index2 is before index4 -> skip.

The second last block is the second block? because n-k-1 = 3-1-1=1 -> the second block? \n                    But we want the (n-k)-th block: k=1 -> n-k = 3-1=2 -> the second block? \n                    The N in the second block is at index6? \n                    Swap index5 and index6: \n                        becomes: \n                            index5: N (from index6)\n                            index6: A (from index5)\n                    Now the string:\n                        1: B\n                        2: N\n                        3: N\n                        4: B\n                        5: N\n                        6: A\n                        7: B\n                        8: A\n                        9: A\n\n                Now, check for \"BAN\": \n                    We need a B, then an A, then an N. \n                    The B's: at indices1,4,7.\n                    For B at index1: \n                        Then we need an A after index1: we have A at index6 and index8 and index9. \n                        For A at index6: then we need an N after index6: we have N at index2? -> no (before), index3? (before), index5? (before). Then no N after index6? \n                    For B at index4: \n                        Then an A after index4: at index6,8,9. \n                        For A at index6: then N after index6: none? \n                    For B at index7: \n                        Then an A at index8 or 9: then N after? none.\n\n                So it works.\n\n            Why does this work? \n                We are swapping the A in the first d blocks with the N in the last d blocks. \n                After swapping, the first d blocks have: \n                    block k: originally \"B A N\" becomes \"B N ?\" \n                    but note: we swapped the A in block k with the N in block (n-k-1). \n                    So the block k becomes: B at 3k+1, then we put the N from the last block at 3k+2, and then the third character? It remains the original N? But we didn't touch the third character of block k? \n                    Actually, we only swapped the A (at 3k+2) with the N at 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k)-3+3 = 3*(n-k). \n\n                And the last d blocks: \n                    block (n-k-1): originally \"B A N\" becomes: \n                        the N at 3*(n-k) is replaced by the A from block k. \n                        So we have: ... B (at 3*(n-k-1)+1) ... then the next character is the original A? but we swapped the A of block k with the N of block (n-k-1). So the block (n-k-1) becomes: \n                            B at 3*(n-k-1)+1, then the next character is the original N? but we swapped the A of block k with the N of block (n-k-1). So the A of block k is now at the position of the N of block (n-k-1). \n                            But the A of block k is an A. So the block (n-k-1) becomes: B, then (the original third character of block (n-k-1) is the N? but we swapped the N away and put an A? and then the last character? we swapped the N, so the last character of block (n-k-1) becomes the A from block k? \n                        Actually, the block (n-k-1) becomes: \n                            first: B (unchanged)\n                            second: the original N? no, the second character of block (n-k-1) is A. We did not swap that? we swapped the N (the third character) of block (n-k-1) with the A (the second character) of block k. \n                        So the block (n-k-1) becomes: \n                            B (at 3*(n-k-1)+1), \n                            A (at 3*(n-k-1)+2) remains? \n                            then the last character: becomes the A from block k? \n                        So it becomes \"B A A\"? \n\n                But note: we are swapping the A from the k-th block (which is at 3k+2) with the N from the (n-k-1)-th block (which is at 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k)).\n\n                Therefore, the k-th block: \n                    position 3k+1: B (unchanged)\n                    position 3k+2: becomes the N from the last block (which was at 3*(n-k))\n                    position 3k+3: remains the original N? but wait, the original k-th block: \n                        3k+1: B\n                        3k+2: A\n                        3k+3: N\n                    After swap: \n                        3k+1: B\n                        3k+2: N (from the last block's N)\n                        3k+3: N (unchanged? but we didn't swap this) -> so two N's? \n\n                And the (n-k-1)-th block: \n                    originally: \n                        3*(n-k-1)+1: B\n                        3*(n-k-1)+2: A\n                        3*(n-k-1)+3: N\n                    After swap: \n                        3*(n-k-1)+1: B\n                        3*(n-k-1)+2: A (unchanged) \n                        3*(n-k-1)+3: A (from the k-th block's A)\n\n                So the k-th block becomes \"B N N\", and the (n-k-1)-th block becomes \"B A A\".\n\n                Now, why does this break the subsequence \"BAN\"? \n                    Consider any potential subsequence: \n                        We need a B, then an A, then an N. \n                    The B's are still there. \n                    The A's: the A's that we moved: the A from the k-th block is now at the last part. \n                    The N's: the N from the last block is now at the k-th block.\n\n                    How can we form \"BAN\"? \n                        We need to pick a B, then an A that appears after that B, then an N that appears after that A.\n\n                    Note: the A's that we moved to the last part are now in the last d blocks. \n                    The N's that we moved to the front are in the first d blocks.\n\n                    If we pick a B from the first d blocks (say at block k, which is at 3k+1), then we need an A after that. \n                        The A's that are in the first d blocks: we moved the A's from the first d blocks to the last d blocks. So the first d blocks have no A? \n                        Actually, the first d blocks: \n                            The blocks that we modified: the first d blocks: we swapped their A with the last d blocks' N. \n                            So the first d blocks: \n                                Each block k (for k in [0, d-1]) has: \n                                    B at 3k+1, then N at 3k+2, then N at 3k+3.\n                            So no A in the first d blocks.\n\n                        The blocks from d to n-d-1? (if any) are unchanged? \n                            But note: d = ceil(n/2). \n                            For n even: d = n/2, so we swap the first n/2 A's with the last n/2 N's. \n                            Then the middle part? none.\n                            For n odd: d = (n+1)//2, then we swap the first (n+1)//2 A's with the last (n+1)//2 N's. \n                            Then the middle block? if n=3, d=2, then we swap the first 2 A's and the last 2 N's. The middle block (if any) is the block at index (d) = 2? but we swapped the A in the second block? so no A in the entire array? \n\n                    Actually, we moved all the A's to the last d blocks. \n\n                    Similarly, the last d blocks: \n                        We swapped the N's from the last d blocks to the first d blocks. \n                        So the last d blocks have no N? \n\n                    Therefore, the entire array: \n                        The first d blocks: have no A? \n                        The last d blocks: have no N? \n\n                    Now, to form \"BAN\": \n                        We need a B, then an A, then an N. \n                        The B can be anywhere. \n                        The A must be in the last d blocks (because that's the only place where A remains). \n                        The N must be in the first d blocks (because that's the only place where N remains? but wait: we swapped the N from the last d blocks to the first d blocks. The last d blocks have no N? \n\n                    But note: the last d blocks: \n                        We swapped the N from the last d blocks to the first d blocks. \n                        So the last d blocks have no N? \n                        And the first d blocks have no A? \n\n                    Now, the A is in the last d blocks, and the N is in the first d blocks? \n                    But the last d blocks are after the first d blocks? \n                    So if we pick a B in the first d blocks, then we need an A after that: but the A is in the last d blocks, which are after. Then we need an N after that A: but the N is only in the first d blocks, which are before the last d blocks? So we cannot get an N after the A. \n\n                    If we pick a B in the last d blocks: \n                        Then we need an A after that B: but the last d blocks have A? but then we need an N after that A: but the last d blocks have no N? and the only N are in the first d blocks, which are before the last d blocks? So we cannot get an N after the A. \n\n                    Therefore, no \"BAN\" subsequence.\n\n            So the plan: \n                d = ceil(n/2)\n                Then for k in range(d):\n                    swap the A in the k-th block (which is at position 3*k+2) with the N in the (n-k-1)-th block (which is at position 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k) - 3 + 3 = 3*(n-k))\n\n                But note: the positions are 1-indexed.\n\n                The k-th block (0-indexed) has:\n                    B at 3*k+1\n                    A at 3*k+2\n                    N at 3*k+3\n\n                The (n-k-1)-th block (0-indexed) has:\n                    B at 3*(n-k-1)+1\n                    A at 3*(n-k-1)+2\n                    N at 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k)  [because 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3n-3k-3+3 = 3n-3k = 3*(n-k)]\n\n                So we swap positions (3*k+2) and (3*(n-k)).\n\n            Example: \n                n=3, k=0: swap 3*0+2 = 2 and 3*(3-0) = 9 -> swap(2,9)\n                k=1: swap 3*1+2=5 and 3*(3-1)=6 -> swap(5,6)\n\n            But note: for k in [0, d-1] (d=2 for n=3).\n\n            So the code for the TODO:\n\n                for _ in range(d):\n                    # We output the swap: \n                    print(f\"{3*i+2} {3*(n-i)}\")\n                    # But wait: we have variables i and j? \n                    # The code sets i=1, j=3*n. But we don't use j? \n\n            Actually, the code sets i=1 and j=3*n. But we are not using them? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    # The k-th block: A at 3*k+2\n                    # The (n-k-1)-th block: N at 3*(n-k)   [because the block index: we are using 0-indexed k for the first block, and the block we take from the end is the (n-k-1)-th block? but we are using the last d blocks: the k-th from the end is the (n-k-1)-th block? \n\n            But note: the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    pos1 = 3*k + 2   # the A in the k-th block (0-indexed k)\n                    pos2 = 3*(n - k)   # the N in the (n-k)-th block? but note: the last block is the (n-1)-th block? \n                    # Actually, the last block: the first candy of the last block is at 3*(n-1)+1, then the A at 3*(n-1)+2, then the N at 3*(n-1)+3 = 3*n.\n                    # So the N in the last block is at 3*n.\n                    # The second last block: the N is at 3*(n-2)+3 = 3*n-6+3 = 3*n-3 = 3*(n-1).\n                    # So the N in the (n-k)-th block? we want the (n-k-1)-th block? \n                    # Actually, we want the (n-k-1)-th block: the last block is the (n-1)-th block, then the one before is (n-2)-th, ... \n                    # The N in the (n-k-1)-th block is at 3*(n-k-1)+3 = 3*(n-k).\n\n                So we swap 3*k+2 and 3*(n-k).\n\n            But note: k from 0 to d-1.\n\n            Example: \n                n=3, k=0: swap 2 and 3*(3-0)=9 -> swap(2,9)\n                k=1: swap 3*1+2=5 and 3*(3-1)=6 -> swap(5,6)\n\n            But wait: for k=1: 3*(n-k) = 3*(3-1)=6 -> that's the N in the (n-1-1)=1st block? (0-indexed block1) -> which is the second block? \n                The second block: \n                    starts at 3*1+1=4, then A at 5, then N at 6.\n                So we swap the A at 5 and the N at 6? -> that's within the same block? \n\n            But note: we are swapping the A in the first block (k=0) with the N in the last block (n-k-1 = 3-0-1=2 -> the last block? but the last block is block2? 0-indexed: block0, block1, block2). \n            Then the A in the second block (k=1) with the N in the second last block? which is block1? (n-k-1 = 3-1-1=1). \n\n            But the N in block1 is at 3*(1)+3 = 6? \n            And the A in block1 is at 5? \n            So we swap the A in block1 (which is at 5) with the N in block1 (which is at 6)? \n\n            That gives: \n                block0: B, then we swap the A at 2 with the N at 9 -> so block0 becomes: B, then (the N from block2) at 2, and then the original N at 3? \n                block1: we swap the A at 5 and the N at 6 -> so block1 becomes: B, then N (from block1's N) at 5, then A (from block1's A) at 6? \n                block2: we swap the N at 9 (which was originally in block2) with the A from block0? so block2: B at 7, A at 8 (unchanged), and then A (from block0) at 9? \n\n            So the string: \n                positions: \n                    1: B\n                    2: N (from block2)\n                    3: N (from block0, originally)\n                    4: B\n                    5: N (from block1's N)\n                    6: A (from block1's A)\n                    7: B\n                    8: A\n                    9: A (from block0's A)\n\n            Which is the same as before.\n\n            So the swap for k=1: we swap the A in the second block (which is at 5) with the N in the second block (which is at 6). \n\n            But note: the problem says: swap two distinct indices. This is valid.\n\n            Therefore, the code for the TODO:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    # We are going to swap 3*k+2 and 3*(n-k)\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But note: the variable names: the code has a for loop that runs d times, and we have i and j defined as i=1, j=3*n. We are not using them? \n\n            Why did the code set i=1 and j=3*n? \n\n            Actually, we don't need i and j? \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n            The TODO is in the for loop. \n\n            So the missing block for program2 is:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But wait: the code already has:\n\n                i=1\n                j=3*n\n                for _ in range(d):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We are not using i and j? \n\n            We can remove i and j? But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n            Alternatively, we can use i and j? \n\n            But note: the code sets i=1 and j=3*n. Then we do d times. \n\n            We can do:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    # We can use k to compute the indices.\n                    # But we are not using i and j? \n                    # We can do:\n                    #   a = 3*k+2\n                    #   b = 3*(n-k)\n                    #   print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\n            But the problem does not require that. \n\n            However, the provided code set i=1 and j=3*n. Why? \n\n            For n=1: \n                d=ceil(1/2)=1.\n                Then we would do: \n                    k=0: swap 3*0+2=2 and 3*(1-0)=3 -> but the sample for n=1 swapped 1 and 2? \n\n            Wait: the sample for n=1: \n                They swapped index1 and index2? \n                But our formula: \n                    k=0: swap 3*0+2=2 and 3*(1-0)=3 -> swap index2 and index3.\n\n            That gives: \n                Original: \n                    1: B\n                    2: A\n                    3: N\n                After swap: \n                    1: B\n                    2: N\n                    3: A -> \"BNA\"\n\n            But \"BNA\" has \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n                We can take B(1), then skip N(2), then A(3) -> but we need an N after the A? we don't have that. \n                How about: B(1), then A? we don't have an A after 1? we have A at 3, but then we need an N after 3? none. \n                But we can take: B(1), then A(3) -> then we don't have an N after? \n                So it's safe.\n\n            But the sample did swap(1,2): \n                becomes: \n                    1: A\n                    2: B\n                    3: N -> \"ABN\", which is safe.\n\n            Why are we getting a different swap? \n\n            The problem says: we can do any sequence. But we want the minimum number of operations. \n\n            For n=1: \n                Our method: 1 operation: swap(2,3) -> safe.\n                The sample: swap(1,2) -> safe.\n\n            Both are valid. \n\n            But the problem says: \"if there are multiple possible answers, output any\".\n\n            However, the sample output for n=1 is \"1 2\". \n\n            How can we match the sample? \n\n            We note: \n                For n=1: \n                    The sample: swap(1,2) -> which is the B and the A.\n\n            Our method: \n                We are swapping the A (at 2) and the N (at 3). \n\n            But we could also swap the B (at 1) and the A (at 2) -> that also breaks the subsequence.\n\n            How about we swap the B and the N? \n                swap(1,3): \n                    becomes: \n                        1: N\n                        2: A\n                        3: B -> \"NAB\" -> then we have no BAN? \n                But we can form: \n                    We need a B: at index3, then an A: at index2? but index2 is before index3 -> skip. Then no A after? \n                So safe.\n\n            So there are multiple possibilities.\n\n            But the problem says: for n=1, the sample output is \"1 2\". \n\n            And for n=2, the sample output is \"2 6\". \n\n            Our method for n=2: \n                d=ceil(2/2)=1.\n                k=0: swap 3*0+2=2 and 3*(2-0)=6 -> swap(2,6) -> which matches the sample.\n\n            So for n=1, we want to output \"1 2\", but our method outputs \"2 3\". \n\n            How can we adjust? \n\n            We note: \n                The sample for n=1: \n                    They swapped the B (at1) and the A (at2). \n\n            In our method, we are swapping the A (at2) and the N (at3). \n\n            But we could also swap the B (at1) and the A (at2). \n\n            How about we do: \n                For the first block (k=0): \n                    Instead of swapping the A and the last block's N, we swap the B and the last block's N? \n\n            But the last block for n=1 is the only block. \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                For k in range(d):\n                    if n==1:\n                        # then we swap 1 and 2\n                    else:\n                        swap 3*k+2 and 3*(n-k)\n\n            But the problem says: we want a general solution.\n\n            Another idea: \n                We can swap the A in the k-th block with the N in the (n-k-1)-th block, but for the first block we can also consider swapping the B and the A? \n\n            But note: the minimum number of operations is d=ceil(n/2). \n\n            We want a uniform method.\n\n            How about: \n                We swap the A in the k-th block with the N in the (n-k-1)-th block, but for the first block we swap the A and the N? \n                But for n=1: the k-th block (0) and the (n-k-1)-th block = (1-0-1)=0 -> same block? \n                Then we swap the A and the N in the same block: \n                    swap(2,3) -> which we did.\n\n            But the sample did swap(1,2). \n\n            The problem does not require a particular swap, so both are acceptable.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"if there are multiple possible answers, output any\".\n\n            But the sample outputs for n=1: \"1 2\", and for n=2: \"2 6\". \n\n            We must output the same for n=1? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n            And the provided code already handles n=1 and n=2:\n\n                if n==1:\n                    print(\"1\")\n                    print(\"1 2\")\n                elif n==2:\n                    print(\"1\")\n                    print(\"2 6\")\n\n            So for n>=3, we are in the else. \n\n            Therefore, for n>=3, we output:\n\n                d = ceil(n/2)\n                print(d)\n                for k in range(d):\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But note: the sample for n=3: \n                d=2\n                Then we output:\n                    2\n                    2 9\n                    5 6\n\n            But the sample in the problem for n=3? \n                The problem note does not give n=3, but we can check.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most 10^5 operations\".\n\n            And our method uses d = ceil(n/2) which for n<=100, d<=50, which is <=10^5.\n\n            Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But note: the code already set i=1 and j=3*n. We are not using them. We can remove them? But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n            We are to complete the for loop. \n\n            So the missing code for the for loop is:\n\n                print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But we need to generate k from 0 to d-1? \n\n            The for loop is:\n\n                for _ in range(d):\n\n            We are not using the loop variable. We can use a variable k? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                k = 0\n                for _ in range(d):\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n                    k += 1\n\n            Or we can do:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But the for loop is already written as:\n\n                for _ in range(d):\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                k = 0\n                for _ in range(d):\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n                    k += 1\n\n            Or we can avoid k and use the loop index? \n\n            Actually, we can use:\n\n                for idx in range(d):\n                    k = idx\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But we can also do:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    print(f\"{3*k+2} {3*(n-k)}\")\n\n            But the loop variable is _ , meaning we don't care. \n\n            We can do:\n\n                k = 0\n                for _ in range(d):\n                    a = 3*k+2\n                    b = 3*(n-k)\n                    print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n                    k += 1\n\n            But note: the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n            We can do:\n\n                for k in range(d):\n                    print(3*k+2, 3*(n-k))\n\n            But the problem says: output the two integers per line.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do without a new variable:\n\n                print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n            But wait: the loop variable _ is the index? \n\n            The for loop: \n                for _ in range(d): \n                    ...\n\n            Here, _ takes the values 0,1,...,d-1.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n            Example: \n                n=3, d=2: \n                    _=0: 3*0+2=2, 3*(3-0)=9 -> \"2 9\"\n                    _=1: 3*1+2=5, 3*(3-1)=6 -> \"5 6\"\n\n            This matches.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n\n                print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n            But note: the problem says: output the two integers per line. \n\n            How to print: \n                print(f\"{3*_+2} {3*(n-_)}\")\n\n            But the problem does not specify the format, as long as we output two integers per line.\n\n            We can do: \n                print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n            This will print with a space.\n\n            So the code becomes:\n\n                for _ in range(d):\n                    print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n            But note: the variable _ is the loop variable. \n\n            However, the problem says: the variable _ is used in the for loop. \n\n            So we output: \n                print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n            But wait: the variable n is the input n. \n\n            Therefore, for program2, the missing code is: \n                print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        The TODO is in the for loop. \n\n        So we output: \n            \"    print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        But the indentation: the for loop is already indented. The TODO is inside the for loop. \n\n        We output the line: \n            \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        But we must include the indentation? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        We output the string that would replace the TODO. \n\n        The TODO is at the same indentation level as the for loop body. \n\n        So we output: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        Therefore, for program2: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        However, let me test for n=3: \n            d=ceil(3/2)=2\n            Then we do:\n                for _ in [0,1]:\n                    print(3*_+2, 3*(3-_))\n\n            _=0: 3*0+2=2, 3*(3-0)=9 -> output \"2 9\"\n            _=1: 3*1+2=5, 3*(3-1)=6 -> output \"5 6\"\n\n        This matches.\n\n        But note: the problem says: the indices are 1-indexed.\n\n        And the positions: \n            For n=3: \n                The A in the first block (block0) is at position 2.\n                The N in the last block (block2) is at position 9? \n                The last block: \n                    block2: \n                        B: 3*2+1 = 7\n                        A: 8\n                        N: 9\n                So the N is at 9.\n\n            The A in the second block (block1) is at 3*1+2=5.\n            The N in the second last block (block1) is at 3*1+3=6.\n\n        So we swap (2,9) and (5,6).\n\n        This is what we want.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for program2 is: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output a string.\n\n        So the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"break\"\n            program2: \"print(str(3*_+2) + ' ' + str(3*(n-_)))\"   ??? \n\n        But the problem says: we can simply output: \n            print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n        Because the print function by default prints with a space.\n\n        So we output: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        However, to be safe, we output the exact code.\n\n        But note: the problem says: the output of the program must be the integers. \n\n        The expression 3*_+2 and 3*(n-_) are integers. \n\n        So we output: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        But wait: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" \n\n        We output the string: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        So we output the string for the missing block.\n\n        But note: the for loop body is one line? \n\n        So the missing code for program2 is: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\n        So we output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"}\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the program2 code is in a for loop that runs d times. We are using the loop variable _.\n\n        But the loop is written as: \n            for _ in range(d):\n\n        So we are using the same variable _.\n\n        Therefore, it's valid.\n\n        But note: the variable _ is used in the for loop. We are using it in the print.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        However, let me check the entire program2 for n=3:\n\n            d=math.ceil(3/2)=2\n            print(d)   # prints 2\n            i=1\n            j=3*n   # 9\n            for _ in range(d):\n                print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))   # for _=0: 2, 9; for _=1: 5, 6\n\n        Output:\n            2\n            2 9\n            5 6\n\n        Which is the required.\n\n        Therefore, we are done.\n\n        But note: the problem says: the total operations must be at most 10^5, and d=ceil(n/2) and n<=100, so d<=50, which is safe.\n\n        So the answer is:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"}\n\n        However, note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" \n\n        We output the string for the missing code.\n\n        But in program1, the missing code is one line: \"break\"\n\n        In program2, the missing code is one line: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        But note: the program2 code has:\n\n            for _ in range(d):\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO line with the print statement.\n\n        So we output the string for the print statement.\n\n        But the TODO line is a comment. We are replacing it with the print.\n\n        Therefore, the answer is as above.\n\n        However, to be safe, we output the exact string that would be inserted.\n\n        We do not include the indentation? The problem does not specify. But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        The block for the for loop body is one line: the print statement.\n\n        And the for loop is already indented. So the print statement should be at the same indentation level as the for loop.\n\n        But the problem does not require the indentation? \n\n        Since the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code\", and we are to output the code as a string, we output without extra indentation? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We output the line as it would appear in the code.\n\n        But the code for program2 is:\n\n            else:\n                d=math.ceil(n/2)\n                print(d)\n                i=1\n                j=3*n\n                for _ in range(d):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO line with:\n\n                    print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\n\n        So the missing code is: \"print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\", and it should be at the same indentation level as the for loop body.\n\n        But the problem does not specify how to represent the indentation. \n\n        Since the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the body of the for loop, we output the line without the leading indentation? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" \n\n        We assume that the system will insert the code at the TODO with the same indentation.\n\n        Therefore, we output the string without the leading spaces.\n\n        Alternatively, we output the string with the same indentation as the surrounding code? \n\n        The problem does not specify. \n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n        We output the line that is missing. \n\n        In the provided code, the TODO line is at the same indentation as the for loop body. \n\n        We output the same line but with the code. \n\n        But the problem does not require the exact whitespace? \n\n        However, to be safe, we output the line as it would appear: with the same indentation as the TODO line. \n\n        The TODO line is: \"        # TODO: Your code here\"\n\n        We replace that with: \"        print(3*_+2, 3*(n-_))\"\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the"
