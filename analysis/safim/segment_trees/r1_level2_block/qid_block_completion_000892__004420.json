Then for the entire string s = d+e:\n                if we have seen the entire string before? Then we subtract c[d+e]? and then we do c[d+e] += 2? Why 2? \n\n        Let me simulate with two identical strings \"ab\":\n\n            First string \"ab\":\n                a['a']: not present -> set a['a']=1\n                b['b']: not present -> set b['b']=1\n                c: \"ab\" not in c -> set c[\"ab\"]=0, then c[\"ab\"] becomes 0+2 = 2? Second string \"ab\":\n                a['a']: currently 1 -> ans += 1 -> now ans=1\n                b['b']: currently 1 -> ans += 1 -> now ans=2 Then \"ab\" is in c -> so we subtract c[\"ab\"] which is 2 -> ans=0 Then we set c[\"ab\"] = 2+2 = 4. Then we print 0? which is correct. Now with three identical \"ab\", \"ab\", \"ab\":\n\n            First: \n                a['a']=1, b['b']=1, c[\"ab\"]=2 (after adding 2) Second: \n                a['a']=1 -> ans +=1 -> ans=1\n                then a['a'] becomes 2\n                b['b']=1 -> ans +=1 -> ans=2\n                then b['b'] becomes 2\n                then subtract c[\"ab\"]=2 -> ans=0\n                then c[\"ab\"] becomes 2+2=4\n\n            Third:\n                a['a']=2 -> ans +=2 -> ans=2\n                then a['a'] becomes 3\n                b['b']=2 -> ans +=2 -> ans=4\n                then subtract c[\"ab\"]=4 -> ans=0\n                then c[\"ab\"] becomes 4+2=6 So we get 0? which is correct because we don't want identical pairs. Now with two different: \"ab\" and \"ac\": First: \n                a['a']=1, b['b']=1, c[\"ab\"]=2\n\n            Second: \n                a['a']=1 -> ans +=1 -> ans=1\n                then a['a'] becomes 2\n                b['c']: not present -> set to 1 -> so ans +=0 -> ans=1\n                then \"ac\" not in c -> set c[\"ac\"]=0, then add 2 -> becomes 2. So we output 1 -> correct. Now with \"ab\", \"ac\", \"ad\": First: \"ab\": a['a']=1, b['b']=1, c[\"ab\"]=2\n            Second: \"ac\": \n                a['a']=1 -> ans=1, then a['a']=2\n                b['c']=0 -> ans=1, then b['c']=1\n                c[\"ac\"] not present -> set to 0 then add 2 -> c[\"ac\"]=2\n            Third: \"ad\":\n                a['a']=2 -> ans +=2 -> ans=3\n                b['d']=0 -> ans=3\n                c[\"ad\"] not present -> set to 0 then add 2 -> c[\"ad\"]=2\n            Output 3 -> correct. Now with \"ab\", \"ac\", \"cb\":\n\n            First: \"ab\": a['a']=1, b['b']=1, c[\"ab\"]=2\n            Second: \"ac\": \n                a['a']=1 -> ans=1, a['a']=2\n                b['c']=0 -> ans=1, b['c']=1\n                c[\"ac\"]=0 -> then set to 2\n            Third: \"cb\":\n                a['c']: not present -> so we set a['c']=1 -> ans=1 (from a) -> then a['c'] becomes 1? but we are adding the current value? so we add 0? Actually: \n                    for the third string: d='c', e='b'\n                    a['c']: we haven't seen 'c' -> so we set a['c']=1? but the code: \n                        try: ans += a[d] -> but KeyError -> so we set a[d]=1 -> so we add 0? then b['b']: we have seen 'b' once -> so we add 1 -> ans becomes 2? Then we check c: \"cb\" not in c -> so we set c[\"cb\"]=0 then add 2 -> becomes 2. Output 2 -> correct. But wait: the code for the third string: \n            a['c']: we haven't seen, so we set a['c']=1 -> so we don't add anything? then b['b']: we have seen? yes, from the first string -> so we do: \n                try: ans += b['b'] -> which is 1 -> so ans becomes 1 (from the second string) + 1 (from b['b'] in the third) = 2. So the code is doing: For each string (d,e):\n                ans += (number of previous strings with first char d)   [which counts pairs that share the first char? but note: we are adding the count of previous ones and then adding one to the count? so it's the same as: for each previous string with first char d, we form a pair? \n                similarly for the second char. Then we subtract: if the entire string has been seen before? then we subtract the current value of c[d+e]? and then we add 2 to c[d+e]? Why subtract c[d+e]? and why add 2 to c[d+e]?",

Therefore, the new maximum frequency is min(n, 2*m) -> because we started with m and we added up to m? So we set m = min(n, 2*m) Therefore, the code for the while loop:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1   # clone operation\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move   # because the target array now has m+move? \n                    # but note: m is updated to the new maximum frequency? However, wait: \n                m += move -> then m becomes m + min(m, n-m) = min(2*m, n) So we can write:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move   # which is min(2*m, n)\n\n            Example: n=6, m=2:\n                Iteration1: \n                    r=0 -> then r=1, move=min(2,4)=2, r=3, m=4.\n                Iteration2:\n                    m=4 <6 -> \n                    r=3+1=4, move=min(4,2)=2, r=6, m=6 -> break. This matches. Example: n=4, m=3:\n                Iteration1:\n                    r=0 -> r=1, move=min(3,1)=1, r=2, m=4 -> break. Example: n=4, m=2: Iteration1:\n                    r=0 -> r=1, move=min(2,2)=2, r=3, m=4 -> break. Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n                r += 1\n                move = min(m, n - m)\n                r += move\n                m += move\n\n            But note: the variable m is updated.

So the number of iterations is O(log(n))? Since n<=10^5, the maximum iterations is about 17? So it's efficient. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n                r += 1\n                move = min(m, n - m)\n                r += move\n                m += move\n\n            But note: the code uses n and m? The code: \n                n = len(a)   # which is the length of the array? m = max frequency of the elements? And we are updating m. So we do:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move\n\n            This will break when m>=n. Therefore, we output:\n\n                program1: the missing line is \"b[e] = 1\"\n                program2: the missing block is:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move\n\n            But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and in the specified format.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: Count pairs (i, j) (i<j) of two-character strings such that they differ in exactly one position.\n The input: t test cases. For each, n and n strings of length 2 (from 'a' to 'k').\n\n Approach:\n We note that two strings s and t differ in exactly one position if:\n   (s[0] == t[0] and s[1] != t[1]) OR (s[0] != t[0] and s[1] == t[1])\n\n However, if we count:\n   - All pairs that have the same first character: then we can get pairs that have the same first character and different second character.\n   - Similarly, all pairs that have the same second character: then we can get pairs that have the same second character and different first character.\n\n But note: pairs that have both characters different are not counted, which is good. However, pairs that have both the same are counted twice? Actually, they are not because if both are same then they are not included in either of the above.\n\n However, there is a catch: the above two sets are disjoint? Actually, if two strings differ in exactly one position, then they must share one of the two characters. So the total pairs we want = (# pairs with same first char and different second) + (# pairs with same second char and different first).\n\n But note: the pair (s, t) is counted in the first if they share the first char and differ in the second, and in the second if they share the second char and differ in the first. However, a pair that differs in exactly one position cannot share both? Actually, if they share the first and the second, then they are the same string and we don't count. So the two sets are disjoint.\n\n However, the provided code in program1.py uses:\n   a: dictionary for the first character\n   b: dictionary for the second character\n   c: dictionary for the entire string\n\n The current code does:\n   For each string (d, e):\n      ans += a[d]   -> meaning we are adding the count of previous strings that had the same first character? But then we are going to count pairs that have the same first character? But note: we are adding the current count of a[d] and then increasing a[d]. This is counting the pairs that have the same first character? Actually, no: because if we have k strings with the same first character so far, then when we add a new one, we form k new pairs? But that would be pairs that have the same first character? However, we want pairs that have the same first character and different second? \n\n But the current code also does:\n      ans += b[e]   -> similarly for the second character.\n\n Then it subtracts: \n        if d+e not in c: \n            c[d+e] = 0\n        else:\n            ans -= c[d+e]   # but then sets c[d+e] += 2? Actually, it does c[d+e] += 2? That seems odd.\n\n Actually, let me think: the problem is that if we count by first character and by second character, we might count the same pair twice? Actually, no: because a pair that shares the first character and has different second does not share the second character? So they are disjoint? \n\n But wait: consider two strings: \"ab\" and \"ac\". \n   They share the first character 'a'. So when we process the second string \"ac\":\n        a['a'] is 1 (from the first string \"ab\") -> so we add 1 for the same first character.\n        Then we look at the second character: for \"ac\", we look at b['c'] -> initially 0? Then we add 0 for the second character.\n\n Then we subtract: for the string \"ac\", we check if \"ac\" is in c? Initially not, so we set c[\"ac\"]=0 and then we do c[\"ac\"] += 2? That doesn't make sense.\n\n Actually, the code subtracts: \n        if the entire string has been seen before? Then we subtract the current count of the entire string? \n\n Why? \n\n The issue: when we count by first character, we count pairs that have the same first character (regardless of the second). But if two strings are identical, then they share the same first character and same second character. However, we don't want to count pairs that are identical? Actually, the problem says \"differ in exactly one position\", so identical strings are not counted. But also, when we count by first character, we count every pair that has the same first character, including those that are identical? Similarly for the second.\n\n However, the problem does not require the pairs to be distinct in the other position? Actually, if two strings are identical, then they share both the first and the second. So they would be counted in both the first and the second? But wait: no, because when we count by first character, we count the pair (if they are identical) as having the same first character? But then we also count them by the second character? So we would count the same pair twice? \n\n Actually, no: because the pair (s, t) is only considered once? But note: the code processes each string one by one. When we process a string, we count the number of previous strings that have the same first character. For an identical string, the entire string is the same? So when we have two identical strings, say \"ab\" and then another \"ab\", then:\n   For the second \"ab\": \n        a['a'] is 1 -> so we add 1 (for the same first character: meaning we are pairing with the first \"ab\")\n        b['b'] is 1 -> so we add 1 (for the same second character: meaning we are pairing with the first \"ab\")\n        Then we subtract: because the entire string \"ab\" has been seen? We subtract the current count of the entire string? \n\n How many times have we seen the entire string? We have seen it once. So we subtract 1? Then we set c[\"ab\"] += 2? \n\n Actually, the code does:\n        if d+e not in c:\n            c[d+e] = 0\n        else:\n            ans -= c[d+e]   # but initially c[d+e] is 0? Then we set c[d+e] = 0 and then add 2? \n\n This seems confusing.\n\n Let me try to understand the intended logic:\n\n We are counting:\n   total = (# pairs with same first char) + (# pairs with same second char)\n\n But note: pairs that are identical are counted twice: once in the first (because they share the first char) and once in the second (because they share the second char). Also, pairs that share the first char and are not identical are only counted once? Similarly for the second.\n\n However, we want to count only pairs that differ in exactly one position. So we must subtract the pairs that are identical? But also, we must subtract the pairs that share the first char and are identical? Actually, we don't want to subtract the identical pairs from the same first char? \n\n Alternatively, we can use inclusion exclusion:\n\n   Let A = set of pairs that share the first character (and any second)\n   Let B = set of pairs that share the second character (and any first)\n\n   Then |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\n   But note: the pairs that are in A \u2229 B are the pairs that share both the first and the second character? That is, the identical pairs? \n\n   However, we want pairs that are in (A \u222a B) but not in (A \u2229 B)? Actually, no: we want pairs that are in A and not in B? and in B and not in A? \n\n   Actually, the pairs that are in A and not in B: same first, different second -> that's one type of pair we want.\n   The pairs that are in B and not in A: same second, different first -> that's the other type.\n\n   So total desired = |A| - |A\u2229B| + |B| - |A\u2229B| = |A| + |B| - 2|A\u2229B|\n\n   But note: |A\u2229B| is the set of pairs that are identical? Actually, no: if two strings are identical, then they share both. But also, if two strings share both, they are identical? So |A\u2229B| is the count of pairs of identical strings? \n\n   However, we are counting pairs that share the same entire string? \n\n   How do we count |A|? We can use: for each first character d, if there are k strings with first char d, then the number of pairs with same first char is C(k,2). Similarly for |B|: for each second char e, C(k,2). For |A\u2229B|: for each entire string s, if it appears k times, then the number of pairs of identical strings is C(k,2).\n\n   Therefore, the answer for a test case would be:\n        ans = (sum_{d} C(count_first[d],2)) + (sum_{e} C(count_second[e],2)) - 2 * (sum_{s} C(count_string[s],2))\n\n   But wait: why 2? Because in the inclusion-exclusion above we subtracted |A\u2229B| twice? Actually, we subtracted 2 * |A\u2229B|? \n\n   Alternatively, note that the identical pairs are counted in both A and B? So we have to subtract them twice? \n\n   However, let me test with two identical strings \"ab\" and \"ab\":\n        A: same first -> 1 pair\n        B: same second -> 1 pair\n        We want to count 0 for this pair? \n        So we subtract 2 * (1) -> then total = 1+1 - 2 = 0 -> correct.\n\n   Now test with two strings: \"ab\" and \"ac\":\n        A: same first -> 1 pair (because both have 'a')\n        B: same second? no -> 0\n        Identical? no -> 0\n        So total = 1 -> correct.\n\n   Now test with \"ab\", \"ac\", \"ad\":\n        A: for 'a': C(3,2)=3\n        B: for each second: 'b','c','d' -> each 1 -> 0\n        Identical: 0\n        So total = 3 -> correct? \n        Pairs: (ab,ac): differ in second -> 1\n               (ab,ad): 1\n               (ac,ad): 1 -> total 3.\n\n   Now test with \"ab\", \"ac\", \"cb\":\n        A: for 'a': 2 -> C(2,2)=1; for 'c':1 ->0 -> total A=1\n        B: for 'b': 2 -> C(2,2)=1; for 'c':1 ->0 -> total B=1\n        Identical: 0\n        Total = 1+1 = 2? \n        But the pairs: \n            (ab,ac): same first -> 1\n            (ab,cb): same second -> 1\n            (ac,cb): differ in both -> not counted -> so total 2 -> correct.\n\n   However, what about the formula: \n        ans = (sum_{d} C(count_first[d],2)) + (sum_{e} C(count_second[e],2)) - 2 * (sum_{s} C(count_string[s],2))\n\n   But wait: in the example above, we didn't subtract anything because there are no identical strings? \n\n   Now test with two identical and one more: \"ab\", \"ab\", \"ac\":\n        A: for 'a': 3 -> C(3,2)=3\n        B: for 'b': 2 -> C(2,2)=1; for 'c':1 ->0 -> total B=1\n        Identical: for \"ab\": C(2,2)=1 -> so we subtract 2*1 = 2\n        Total = 3+1-2 = 2.\n\n        The pairs that we want:\n            (ab,ac): same first -> 1\n            (ab,ac): same first -> 1   [but note: we have two ab's: so two pairs: (ab1,ac) and (ab2,ac)]\n            (ab1,ab2): we don't want because they are identical? -> so we have 2 pairs? \n            However, the identical pair (ab1,ab2) was counted in A (because same first) and in B (because same second) -> so we subtracted twice? and then we are left with 2? \n            But the two pairs (ab1,ac) and (ab2,ac) are both valid? -> so 2 is correct.\n\n   Therefore, the formula is:\n        ans = (sum_{d} C(count_first[d],2)) + (sum_{e} C(count_second[e],2)) - 2 * (sum_{s} C(count_string[s],2))\n\n   But note: the provided code does not precompute the entire counts and then do the combination? It does an online method.\n\n   How does the provided code work?\n\n        We have:\n            a: dictionary for the first character (counts so far)\n            b: dictionary for the second character (counts so far)\n            c: dictionary for the entire string? but note: the code does:\n                if d+e not in c:\n                    c[d+e] = 0\n                else:\n                    ans -= c[d+e]   # and then we do c[d+e] += 2? \n\n        Actually, the code does:\n            ans += a[d]   -> then a[d] is incremented by 1.\n            ans += b[e]   -> then b[e] is incremented by 1.\n\n            Then for the entire string s = d+e:\n                if we have seen the entire string before? Then we subtract c[d+e]? and then we do c[d+e] += 2? \n\n        Why 2? \n\n        Let me simulate with two identical strings \"ab\":\n\n            First string \"ab\":\n                a['a']: not present -> set a['a']=1\n                b['b']: not present -> set b['b']=1\n                c: \"ab\" not in c -> set c[\"ab\"]=0, then c[\"ab\"] becomes 0+2 = 2? \n\n            Second string \"ab\":\n                a['a']: currently 1 -> ans += 1 -> now ans=1\n                b['b']: currently 1 -> ans += 1 -> now ans=2\n                Then \"ab\" is in c -> so we subtract c[\"ab\"] which is 2 -> ans=0\n                Then we set c[\"ab\"] = 2+2 = 4.\n\n        Then we print 0? which is correct.\n\n        Now with three identical \"ab\", \"ab\", \"ab\":\n\n            First: \n                a['a']=1, b['b']=1, c[\"ab\"]=2 (after adding 2)\n\n            Second: \n                a['a']=1 -> ans +=1 -> ans=1\n                then a['a'] becomes 2\n                b['b']=1 -> ans +=1 -> ans=2\n                then b['b'] becomes 2\n                then subtract c[\"ab\"]=2 -> ans=0\n                then c[\"ab\"] becomes 2+2=4\n\n            Third:\n                a['a']=2 -> ans +=2 -> ans=2\n                then a['a'] becomes 3\n                b['b']=2 -> ans +=2 -> ans=4\n                then subtract c[\"ab\"]=4 -> ans=0\n                then c[\"ab\"] becomes 4+2=6\n\n            So we get 0? which is correct because we don't want identical pairs.\n\n        Now with two different: \"ab\" and \"ac\":\n\n            First: \n                a['a']=1, b['b']=1, c[\"ab\"]=2\n\n            Second: \n                a['a']=1 -> ans +=1 -> ans=1\n                then a['a'] becomes 2\n                b['c']: not present -> set to 1 -> so ans +=0 -> ans=1\n                then \"ac\" not in c -> set c[\"ac\"]=0, then add 2 -> becomes 2.\n\n            So we output 1 -> correct.\n\n        Now with \"ab\", \"ac\", \"ad\":\n\n            First: \"ab\": a['a']=1, b['b']=1, c[\"ab\"]=2\n            Second: \"ac\": \n                a['a']=1 -> ans=1, then a['a']=2\n                b['c']=0 -> ans=1, then b['c']=1\n                c[\"ac\"] not present -> set to 0 then add 2 -> c[\"ac\"]=2\n            Third: \"ad\":\n                a['a']=2 -> ans +=2 -> ans=3\n                b['d']=0 -> ans=3\n                c[\"ad\"] not present -> set to 0 then add 2 -> c[\"ad\"]=2\n            Output 3 -> correct.\n\n        Now with \"ab\", \"ac\", \"cb\":\n\n            First: \"ab\": a['a']=1, b['b']=1, c[\"ab\"]=2\n            Second: \"ac\": \n                a['a']=1 -> ans=1, a['a']=2\n                b['c']=0 -> ans=1, b['c']=1\n                c[\"ac\"]=0 -> then set to 2\n            Third: \"cb\":\n                a['c']: not present -> so we set a['c']=1 -> ans=1 (from a) -> then a['c'] becomes 1? but we are adding the current value? so we add 0? \n                Actually: \n                    for the third string: d='c', e='b'\n                    a['c']: we haven't seen 'c' -> so we set a['c']=1? but the code: \n                        try: ans += a[d] -> but KeyError -> so we set a[d]=1 -> so we add 0? \n                    then b['b']: we have seen 'b' once -> so we add 1 -> ans becomes 2? \n                Then we check c: \"cb\" not in c -> so we set c[\"cb\"]=0 then add 2 -> becomes 2.\n\n            Output 2 -> correct.\n\n        But wait: the code for the third string: \n            a['c']: we haven't seen, so we set a['c']=1 -> so we don't add anything? \n            then b['b']: we have seen? yes, from the first string -> so we do: \n                try: ans += b['b'] -> which is 1 -> so ans becomes 1 (from the second string) + 1 (from b['b'] in the third) = 2.\n\n        So the code is doing:\n            For each string (d,e):\n                ans += (number of previous strings with first char d)   [which counts pairs that share the first char? but note: we are adding the count of previous ones and then adding one to the count? so it's the same as: for each previous string with first char d, we form a pair? \n                similarly for the second char.\n\n                Then we subtract: if the entire string has been seen before? then we subtract the current value of c[d+e]? and then we add 2 to c[d+e]? \n\n        Why subtract c[d+e]? and why add 2 to c[d+e]? \n\n        Actually, the value in c is being used to track how many times we have subtracted for this entire string? \n\n        How? \n\n        Consider: when we see a string s for the first time, we set c[s]=0 and then we add 2 -> so c[s]=2.\n        When we see it the second time: we subtract 2 (the current value of c[s]) and then add 2 -> so c[s] becomes 4.\n        Then the third time: we subtract 4 and then add 2 -> becomes 6.\n\n        What is the effect? \n            For the first occurrence: no subtraction.\n            For the second: subtract 2 -> which is 2 * 1? \n            For the third: subtract 4 -> which is 2 * 2? \n\n        Actually, the subtraction for the k-th occurrence (k>=2) is 2*(k-1). \n\n        Why? \n\n        Note: the identical pairs: \n            When we have k occurrences of a string s, the number of identical pairs that we have overcounted is C(k,2) * 2? \n            But in our formula we subtract 2 * (number of identical pairs) = 2 * C(k,2) = k*(k-1).\n\n        How does the online method achieve that? \n\n            The total subtraction for a string s that appears k times is: \n                at the second occurrence: subtract 2\n                at the third: subtract 4\n                at the fourth: subtract 6\n                ... \n                at the k-th: subtract 2*(k-1)\n\n            Total subtraction = 2*(1+2+...+(k-1)) = 2 * ( (k-1)*k/2 ) = k*(k-1) -> which is 2 * C(k,2) -> exactly what we want.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        But note: the code for the second dictionary b: in the except block, we set b[e]=1? \n\n        The current code for the except block in b is:\n\n            except KeyError:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must set b[e] = 1? \n\n        However, the code for a: \n            try: \n                ans += a[d]\n                a[d] += 1\n            except KeyError:\n                a[d] = 1\n\n        Similarly for b: \n            try: \n                ans += b[e]\n                b[e] += 1\n            except KeyError:\n                # we should set b[e] = 1\n\n        So the missing line for program1.py is: \n            b[e] = 1\n\n        But wait: the code for the entire string part:\n\n            if d+e not in c:\n                c[d+e] = 0\n            else:\n                ans -= c[d+e]\n            c[d+e] += 2\n\n        This is already written.\n\n        Therefore, the missing part in program1.py is only the except block for b.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do this.\n\n        But note: the code for the entire string part: \n            if d+e not in c: \n                c[d+e] = 0\n            else:\n                ans -= c[d+e]\n            c[d+e] += 2\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        So for program1.py, the missing part is: in the except block for b, we set b[e] = 1.\n\n        But note: the code for a is already done.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is only the line: \"b[e] = 1\"\n\n        However, the code for the entire string part is already provided? \n\n        But wait: the code for the entire string part has a comment: \"TODO: Your code here\" in the except block for b? Actually, the TODO is only in the except block for b.\n\n        So we complete the except block for b.\n\n        So for program1.py: we only need to set b[e] = 1 in the except block.\n\n        But note: the code for the entire string part is already written? \n\n        However, the code for the entire string part is:\n\n            if d+e not in c:\n                c[d+e] = 0\n            else:\n                ans -= c[d+e]\n            c[d+e] += 2\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing line for program1.py is: \"b[e] = 1\"\n\n        But note: the code for the entire string part is written after the b part? and we are using the same variable 'ans'. \n\n        So we don't change that.\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n        Description: \n            We are given an array a of n integers. We can do two operations:\n                1. Clone any existing array (so we get one more copy of that array).\n                2. Swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\n            We want the minimal number of operations to obtain at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\n        Example: \n            [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> we can do:\n                Operation 1: clone -> now two copies: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n                Then we can swap: for example, swap the second element of the first array (which is 1) with the last element of the second array (which is 0) -> then we have [0,0,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,1]? \n                Then we clone the first array -> now three copies: [0,0,3,3,7,0], [0,0,3,3,7,0], [0,1,3,3,7,1]\n                Then we swap the 3 and 7 in the first two copies to zeros? \n                How? We can swap the 3 at index2 of the first array with the 0 at index0 of the second array? \n                But then the first array becomes [3,0,3,3,7,0] -> not good.\n\n            Actually, the example in the note does:\n                After cloning: two copies of [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n                Then swap: \n                    First array: swap element at index1 (which is 1) with element at index5 (which is 0) in the same array? -> [0,0,3,3,7,1] and [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> then they swap between arrays? \n\n            The note says: \n                After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array: \n                    [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] \n                How? \n                    They did: \n                        swap the element at index1 of the first array (which is 0) with the element at index0 of the second array (which is 0) -> that doesn't change? \n                    Actually, they swapped the 1 in the first array (at index1) with a 0 from the second array? \n\n            The key is: we can swap arbitrarily between any two arrays and any positions.\n\n        Insight:\n\n            We want to create a copy that has all elements equal to x (for some x). \n\n            How many x's do we need? We need n copies of x in one array.\n\n            How many x's are available in the entire system? Initially, we have one copy of the array. Then we can clone to get more arrays. But note: we can also swap elements arbitrarily.\n\n            The operations: \n                Operation 1 (clone): creates a new copy of an existing array. This operation does not change the multiset of elements in the entire system? \n                Operation 2 (swap): swaps two elements. This operation does not change the multiset of elements in the entire system? \n\n            Therefore, the entire multiset of elements is fixed. \n\n            So to form an array of n copies of x, we must have at least n copies of x in the entire multiset.\n\n            But note: we can have multiple arrays. The entire multiset is the union of all arrays? \n\n            Initially: one array of n elements. Then if we clone k times, we have k+1 arrays, each of n elements? So the total number of elements is (k+1)*n.\n\n            And we require that for the element x, the frequency of x in the entire multiset is at least n.\n\n            But note: we can also use other elements? Actually, we are going to concentrate n copies of x in one array. The rest of the arrays can have the remaining elements.\n\n            So the necessary condition: the frequency of x in the entire multiset must be at least n.\n\n            However, the entire multiset initially has the array a. Then when we clone, we are duplicating the entire array? So the frequency of x in the entire multiset becomes (k+1) * (original frequency of x in a).\n\n            Therefore, we require: (k+1) * (freq_x) >= n.\n\n            But note: we can choose k arbitrarily? However, we want to minimize the total operations.\n\n            The total operations = k (for the clones) + (number of swaps).\n\n            How many swaps? \n\n            We start with one array. Then we have k clones. So we have k+1 arrays.\n\n            We want to form one array that has n copies of x. \n\n            How do we do the swaps? \n\n            We can think: we are going to collect n copies of x in one array. \n\n            How many x's are already in that array? Initially, the array we choose to be the target might have some x's. Then we need to bring the rest from other arrays.\n\n            But note: we can swap arbitrarily. \n\n            The minimal number of swaps needed to form an array of n copies of x is: \n                We need to bring (n - (initial count of x in the target array)) x's from other arrays? \n\n            However, we can also swap non-x elements out of the target array and x's in? \n\n            Actually, the target array initially has, say, c0 copies of x. Then we need n - c0 more x's. \n\n            But note: we can also take x's from other arrays? \n\n            However, we can also use multiple arrays? \n\n            Actually, we can model: \n                We have k+1 arrays. We choose one as the target. \n                The target initially has c0 x's. \n                The other arrays have a total of ( (k+1)*freq_x - c0 ) x's? \n\n            We need to bring n - c0 x's into the target. \n\n            How? We can swap an element that is not x in the target with an x in another array. Each such swap brings one x into the target and removes one non-x.\n\n            But note: we can also swap within the target? but that doesn't help? \n\n            Also, we can swap between two non-target arrays? but that doesn't directly help? \n\n            Actually, we can do: \n                We can swap a non-x in the target with an x in a non-target. This is one swap and it increases the count of x in the target by one.\n\n            Therefore, the number of swaps required is (n - c0).\n\n            But wait: what if we don't have enough x's in the non-target arrays? \n\n            Actually, we have (k+1)*freq_x total x's. We require at least n. So we can choose x only if (k+1)*freq_x >= n.\n\n            Then the number of swaps is n - c0? \n\n            However, we can choose which array to make the target? and we can choose x arbitrarily? \n\n            Also, note: we can do the swaps in any order? \n\n            Therefore, for a fixed x and a fixed k (number of clones), we can choose the target array to be the one that has the maximum initial count of x? \n\n            Then the number of swaps would be: n - max_{arrays} (count of x in that array) \n\n            But note: initially we have one array. Then when we clone, we get identical arrays? \n\n            So initially, all arrays are the same? \n\n            Therefore, every array has the same count of x: namely, the frequency of x in the original array, which we denote by f.\n\n            Then the target array initially has f x's. We need n - f swaps to make it all x.\n\n            But note: we have k+1 arrays. The total x's is (k+1)*f. We require (k+1)*f >= n.\n\n            Then the total operations = k (for cloning) + (n - f) (for swaps).\n\n            However, we can choose k? and we can choose x? \n\n            We want to minimize the total operations = k + (n - f) over all x that satisfy (k+1)*f >= n, and k>=0.\n\n            Note: k must be at least ceil( (n - f) / f )? Actually, we require (k+1)*f >= n -> k >= ceil(n/f) - 1.\n\n            Then the minimal k is k0 = max(0, ceil(n/f) - 1). Then the total operations = k0 + (n - f).\n\n            But note: we can also choose x? So we minimize over x.\n\n            However, note: the entire multiset is fixed. The frequency f for x is the frequency in the original array.\n\n            Therefore, we do:\n\n                Let f = frequency of x in the original array.\n\n                Then we require k >= ceil(n/f) - 1 -> k_min = max(0, ceil(n/f) - 1)\n\n                Then total_ops(x) = k_min + (n - f)\n\n            Then we minimize total_ops(x) over all x that appear in the array? \n\n            But note: if an element x does not appear at all? then f=0 -> then we cannot use it? because we require (k+1)*0>=n -> which is impossible. So we only consider x with f>=1.\n\n            However, note: if f=0, then we skip.\n\n            But what if no element appears at least once? then we cannot form an array of all x? but the array has at least one element? so there is at least one element? \n\n            Actually, n>=1, so there is at least one element. But if we choose x that does not appear? then we cannot form it? so we skip.\n\n            Therefore, algorithm for a test case:\n\n                Count frequency of each element in the array.\n\n                Let m = max frequency? but note: we are going to consider every distinct element? \n\n                Actually, we want to minimize: \n                    total_ops(x) = max(0, ceil(n/f) - 1) + (n - f)\n\n                But note: we can write ceil(n/f) = (n + f - 1) // f   (if we use integer division)\n\n                Then k_min = max(0, (n+f-1)//f - 1)\n\n                Then total_ops(x) = max(0, (n+f-1)//f - 1) + (n - f)\n\n            However, we can also consider: we might not need to do swaps? if the array is already all x? then f=n, then k_min = max(0, ceil(n/n)-1)=ceil(1)-1=1-1=0, and swaps = n-n=0 -> total 0.\n\n            Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] for x=0: f=2, then k_min = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2, then total_ops=2 + (6-2)=6 -> but the example says 6 operations? \n\n            However, the example in the note did 6 operations? \n\n            But the example in the note: \n                Operation 1: clone -> 1 operation -> now two arrays.\n                Then they did swaps? the note says: \"After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array\" -> how many swaps? \n                    They ended up with one array having four zeros? so they moved two zeros from the second array to the first? and then they cloned again? and then swapped two more? \n                Actually, the note says:\n                    Step1: clone -> 1 op -> 2 arrays\n                    Then they swapped two elements? (they swapped two pairs? because they moved two zeros? but each swap moves one zero? so two swaps? then they cloned -> 1 op -> then swapped two more? -> total operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) + 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 6.\n\n            But our formula: \n                k_min = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1 = 2 -> then total_ops = 2 (clones) + (6-2)=4? -> 6? \n\n            Actually, wait: the formula: \n                total_ops = k_min + (n-f) = 2 + (6-2) = 6? \n\n            But note: the swaps: we said we need n-f = 4 swaps? but the formula says 2 (clones) + 4 (swaps) = 6.\n\n            However, the example did 6 operations: 2 clones and 4 swaps? \n\n            But the note says: minimal number of operations is 6? \n\n            Therefore, the formula for a fixed x: \n                k = ceil(n/f) - 1   (if ceil(n/f)-1>=0, which it is when f>=1 and n>=1) \n                total_ops = k + (n - f) = ceil(n/f) - 1 + n - f.\n\n            Then we minimize this over all distinct x.\n\n            But note: we can also consider: what if we do more clones? \n\n            The condition is (k+1)*f>=n. We take the minimal k that satisfies that? because we want to minimize the total operations (k + (n-f)). \n\n            Why minimal k? because k is the number of clones and we add k and then we add (n-f) swaps. \n\n            Example: \n                n=6, f=2: \n                    k_min = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2 -> total_ops=2+4=6.\n\n                What if we do k=3? \n                    Then total_ops=3+4=7 -> worse.\n\n            So we take k_min.\n\n            Therefore, for each distinct element x with frequency f, we compute:\n                k = max(0, (n + f - 1) // f - 1)   [because ceil(n/f) = (n+f-1)//f for integers]\n                total_ops = k + (n - f)\n\n            Then we take the minimum total_ops over all x.\n\n            But note: what if there are multiple x? we must consider every distinct element.\n\n            However, the problem: the array can have negative numbers? \n\n            But the frequency is just the count.\n\n            But note: the example: \n                First test case: all elements equal -> then for x = that element: f=n -> \n                    k_min = ceil(n/n)-1 = 1-1=0, total_ops=0 -> correct.\n\n            Second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> \n                We consider x=0: f=2 -> total_ops = (ceil(6/2)-1) + (6-2) = (3-1)+4=6.\n                x=1: f=1 -> total_ops = ceil(6/1)-1 + (6-1) = 6-1+5=10.\n                x=3: f=2 -> same as 0: 6.\n                x=7: f=1 -> 10.\n\n                So the minimum is 6.\n\n            But the example says the answer is 6.\n\n            However, the note also says: \n                Third test case: [1,2,1,1] -> \n                    The example input: \n                        t=1, n=4, array = [1,2,1,1]\n\n                    For x=1: f=3 -> \n                        k_min = ceil(4/3)-1 = ceil(1.33) = 2? -> 2-1=1, then total_ops=1 + (4-3)=2.\n                    For x=2: f=1 -> ceil(4/1)-1=4-1=3, then 3+ (4-1)=6.\n\n                    So the answer is 2.\n\n            But the sample input in the problem does not have a third test case? \n\n            However, the problem says: the input consists of multiple test cases.\n\n            Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n                We are given: \n                    t = number of test cases\n                    Then for each test case: \n                        n = int(input())\n                        a = list of n integers\n\n                We want to compute:\n                    ans = min{ for each distinct x in a: \n                                f = frequency of x\n                                k = max(0, (n + f - 1) // f - 1)\n                                total_ops = k + (n - f)\n                             }\n\n                But note: what if the array is empty? n>=1.\n\n            However, the provided code:\n\n                from collections import*\n                for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                    while m<n:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    print(r)\n\n            This code is incomplete.\n\n            The provided code does:\n                It reads the input: \n                    [*open(0)]: all lines\n                    [2::2]: starting from index2 (the first line after t, then skip one) and then every other line? \n                    Actually: \n                        index0: t\n                        index1: n for first test case\n                        index2: the array for first test case (as a string)\n                    Then for the next test case: \n                        index3: n\n                        index4: array\n\n                    So [2::2] gives the array lines for every test case? \n\n                Then: \n                    n = len(a:=a.split())   -> but note: the array line has n integers? so splitting gives a list of n strings? \n                    Then m = max frequency of these strings? \n                    Then r=0, and then a while loop: while m<n: ... \n\n                Then print r.\n\n            How does this relate to our solution?\n\n            Our solution: \n                We want to compute: \n                    ans = min_{x} [ max(0, ceil(n/f)-1) + (n-f) ]\n\n            But the provided code sets m = max frequency? and then if m==n, then we skip the while loop and output 0? which is correct.\n\n            But if m<n, then we enter the while loop? and we are supposed to compute the minimal operations? \n\n            How can we relate? \n\n            Note: the minimal operations we computed is for the best x. \n\n            But the provided code does not iterate over distinct elements? \n\n            Therefore, we must change the approach? \n\n            Alternatively, note: the minimal total_ops we computed is:\n\n                total_ops = min_{x} [ max(0, ceil(n/f)-1) + (n-f) ]\n\n            But the provided code sets m = max frequency? \n\n            Why max frequency? \n\n            Consider: if we choose x with the maximum frequency, then f is as large as possible. Then ceil(n/f) is as small as possible? and n-f is as small as possible? \n\n            Actually, the minimal total_ops might be achieved by the element with the maximum frequency? \n\n            Let me test: \n                Example: [1,2,1,1] -> \n                    f=3 (for 1) -> total_ops = ceil(4/3)-1 + (4-3) = 2-1+1 = 2.\n                    f=1 (for 2) -> total_ops = ceil(4/1)-1+3 = 4-1+3=6.\n\n                So the maximum frequency gives the minimum.\n\n            Why? \n                The term (n-f) is minimized when f is maximized.\n                The term ceil(n/f)-1 is also minimized when f is maximized? \n\n            Therefore, the minimal total_ops is achieved when f is the maximum frequency? \n\n            Proof: \n                Let f1 and f2 be frequencies with f1>=f2.\n                We want to show: \n                    ceil(n/f1)-1 + (n-f1) <= ceil(n/f2)-1 + (n-f2)\n\n                -> ceil(n/f1) - f1 <= ceil(n/f2) - f2.\n\n                But note: ceil(n/f) is decreasing in f? and f is increasing? \n\n                Actually, consider: \n                    Let g(f) = ceil(n/f) - f.\n\n                We want to show that if f1>=f2, then g(f1) <= g(f2)? \n\n                But note: \n                    ceil(n/f) is a step function: as f increases, ceil(n/f) decreases.\n\n                Example: n=4, \n                    f=1: ceil(4/1)=4 -> g(1)=4-1=3\n                    f=2: ceil(4/2)=2 -> g(2)=2-2=0\n                    f=3: ceil(4/3)= ceil(1.33)=2 -> g(3)=2-3=-1\n                    f=4: ceil(4/4)=1 -> g(4)=1-4=-3\n\n                So g(f) is decreasing in f? \n\n                Therefore, the minimal total_ops is achieved when f is maximum.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                Let m = max frequency.\n\n                Then k_min = max(0, ceil(n/m) - 1)\n                total_ops = k_min + (n - m)\n\n            Then output total_ops.\n\n            But note: the provided code sets r=0 and then does a while loop? \n\n            How can we compute without a loop? \n\n            The provided code:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            Then it prints r.\n\n            We note that the operations we do: \n                We start with one array. Then we clone (which increases the total arrays) and then we do swaps? \n\n            But the while loop condition: m < n -> meaning the maximum frequency is less than n.\n\n            How does the while loop work? \n\n            The note example: \n                [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 (for 0 and 3) -> n=6 -> m<6 -> enter the loop.\n\n            How many operations? 6.\n\n            But we cannot do a while loop that runs 6 times? because n can be 10^5.\n\n            We need to compute the answer without a loop? \n\n            Actually, the answer is: \n                r = (ceil(n/m) - 1) + (n - m)   [if m<n, then ceil(n/m)-1>=0]\n\n            But note: if m==n, we skip the loop and output 0.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                if m==n: \n                    r=0\n                else:\n                    k_min = (n + m - 1) // m - 1   # because ceil(n/m) = (n+m-1)//m\n                    r = k_min + (n - m)\n\n            But the code already sets r=0 and then does a while loop only when m<n? \n\n            How to break the while loop? \n\n            The provided code: \n                while m < n:\n                    # we need to update r and m? \n\n            But note: the process: \n                We are going to clone the array that has the most of the element we are concentrating? \n\n            Actually, the note does:\n\n                Operation 1: clone -> now two arrays. Then we swap to move some zeros? \n\n            But the frequency in the entire system of the element we are concentrating (say x) is now 2 * (original frequency) = 2*m? \n\n            Then we can form an array of all x if 2*m >= n? \n\n            Then the number of swaps needed is n - m (because we start with one array that has m x's, and we need n x's in that array, so we need to bring n-m x's from the other array? but the other array also has m x's? so we can take min(m, n-m) from the other array? but we need n-m? and we have m available? so if m>=n-m, then we can do n-m swaps? \n\n            But wait: we have two arrays. The target array has m x's. The other array has m x's. We can take up to m x's from the other array? but we only need n-m? and since m>=n-m? (because 2*m>=n) then we can do n-m swaps.\n\n            Then total operations = 1 (clone) + (n-m) (swaps) = 1 + n - m.\n\n            But what if 2*m < n? \n\n            Then we need to clone again? \n\n            After two clones: we have three arrays. The total x's is 3*m. We require 3*m>=n? \n\n            Then we choose one array as the target. It has m x's. We need n-m more. The other two arrays have 2*m x's. We can take min(2*m, n-m) from them? but we require n-m? and 3*m>=n -> so 2*m >= n-m? (because 3*m>=n -> 2*m>=n-m? because 3*m>=n -> 2*m>= (2/3)*n, and n-m>= (2/3)*n? not necessarily) \n\n            Actually, we can take x's from any array? so we can take from both? \n\n            The minimal number of swaps is n-m? because we need to bring n-m x's? and we have 2*m available? which is at least n-m? because 3*m>=n -> 2*m>=n-m? \n\n            Therefore, after k clones, we have k+1 arrays. The total x's is (k+1)*m. We require (k+1)*m>=n. Then the number of swaps is n-m? \n\n            Then total operations = k (clones) + (n-m) (swaps).\n\n            But wait: why is the number of swaps always n-m? \n\n            Actually, we start with one array that has m x's. Then we do k clones. Then we have k+1 arrays, each initially has m x's? \n\n            We choose one array as the target. It has m x's. We need to bring n-m x's from the other k arrays? \n\n            How many x's are available in the other k arrays? k*m. \n\n            We require k*m >= n-m? which is equivalent to (k+1)*m>=n? which is satisfied.\n\n            Therefore, we can always bring n-m x's? \n\n            Then the total operations = k + (n-m), where k is the minimal integer such that (k+1)*m>=n.\n\n            So k = ceil(n/m) - 1.\n\n            Therefore, the answer = ceil(n/m) - 1 + (n-m).\n\n            So we can break out of the loop immediately? \n\n            The provided code does:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    # we do one operation? \n\n            But we don't need a loop? we can compute directly.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                r = ( (n + m - 1) // m - 1 ) + (n - m)\n\n            But note: if m==n, we skip the loop -> r=0.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1   # but we cannot do just one? \n                    # we need to update m? \n\n            Alternatively, the note does:\n\n                Operation: clone -> then we can get more x's? \n\n            But the frequency m in the entire system increases? \n\n            Actually, the entire system's frequency of x is (k+1)*m? but we are not changing the original m? \n\n            The provided code uses m as the max frequency in the original array? \n\n            Therefore, we don't update m? \n\n            So we can break the loop in one step? \n\n            But the while loop condition is m<n? and we don't change m? so it would loop infinitely? \n\n            Therefore, we must not use a while loop? \n\n            The intended logic in the provided code might be different? \n\n            Alternatively, the provided code might be trying to simulate the process? \n\n            How? \n\n            The note: \n                We start with one array: m0 = m (the max frequency in the original array)\n                Then we do a clone: now we have two arrays. The total x's is 2*m0. \n                Then we can swap: we can increase the frequency in one array? \n\n            But note: the entire system's frequency is fixed? \n\n            How do we simulate? \n\n            Actually, we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. So we can concentrate the x's. \n\n            The key: after k clones, we have k+1 arrays. The entire system has (k+1)*m0 x's. \n\n            We want to form one array with n x's. \n\n            The maximum frequency we can achieve in one array is min(n, (k+1)*m0) because we cannot put more than the total available x's? \n\n            But we can put at most n in one array? \n\n            So we require (k+1)*m0 >= n.\n\n            Then the minimal k is ceil(n/m0)-1.\n\n            Then the total operations = k + (n - m0)   [because we need to bring n - m0 x's into the target array?]\n\n            But note: we are not limited by the target array? we can take from any array? \n\n            However, the target array initially has m0 x's. We need to bring n - m0 x's from the other arrays? and the other arrays have (k+1)*m0 - m0 = k*m0 x's? which is at least n - m0? because (k+1)*m0>=n -> k*m0>=n-m0? \n\n            So we can do n-m0 swaps.\n\n            Therefore, the answer is k + (n-m0) = ceil(n/m0)-1 + n - m0.\n\n            So we can compute without a loop.\n\n            Therefore, the provided code's while loop is not necessary? \n\n            But the problem says: the provided code has:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            And we must fill the TODO.\n\n            How can we break the loop? We want to compute the answer and break? \n\n            Alternatively, we can update r and m in a way that we simulate the entire process in one step? \n\n            But note: the entire process is: \n                We do k_min clones and then n-m0 swaps? \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                r = ( (n + m - 1) // m - 1 ) + (n - m)\n                break   # but we cannot break? we must update m to n? so that the condition fails? \n\n            Or we can set m = n? and then break? \n\n            But the while loop condition is m<n? so if we set m=n, then the loop will break.\n\n            So:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    # We compute the answer in one step and set m to n to break.\n                    r = ( (n + m - 1) // m - 1 ) + (n - m)\n                    m = n   # to break the loop\n\n            But what if we don't break? we do one iteration? \n\n            Alternatively, the problem might be intended to simulate step by step? \n\n            Step by step:\n\n                We start with one array: m0 = m (max frequency in the original array)\n                We do a clone: operation count r += 1 -> now we have two arrays. \n                Then we can swap: we can move one x from the second array to the first? so the first array now has m0+1 x's? \n                Then m becomes m0+1? \n\n                Then we check: if m0+1 < n, then we do another clone? \n\n                How many x's do we have in the entire system? 2*m0.\n\n                After moving one x to the first array, the first array has m0+1, the second array has m0-1.\n\n                Then the maximum frequency in any array is m0+1.\n\n                Then we set m = m0+1.\n\n                Then we do:\n\n                    r += 1   (for the clone) and then we can move more x's? \n\n                How many moves can we do? \n\n                Actually, we can do:\n\n                    Operation 1: clone the array that has the most x's? \n\n                But note: we can clone any array? \n\n                After the first clone and one swap: \n                    We have two arrays: [m0+1, ...] and [m0-1, ...]\n\n                Then we clone the first array? -> now we have three arrays: \n                    Array1: m0+1\n                    Array2: m0-1\n                    Array3: m0+1   (the clone of array1)\n\n                Then we can swap from array3 to array1? to get array1: m0+2? \n\n                But we can also swap from array2 to array1? \n\n                Actually, we can swap arbitrarily. \n\n                The entire system has 2*m0 x's. We want to get one array with n x's? \n\n                The maximum we can put in one array is min(n, 2*m0). \n\n                How many swaps are needed? \n\n                We start with the first array having m0. \n                We want to get it to min(n, 2*m0). \n\n                The number of swaps to bring k x's into the first array is k? \n\n                But we can do multiple clones and then swap? \n\n                Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    In the first step: \n                        Clone the array -> cost 1.\n                        Then we can move up to m0 (the entire x's in the clone) to the first array? but we don't need that many? we only need n - m0? \n\n                But we can only move min(m0, n-m0) in the first step? \n\n                Then the first array becomes m0 + min(m0, n-m0) = min(n, 2*m0)\n\n                Then the new maximum frequency in an array is min(n, 2*m0)\n\n                Then we set m = min(n, 2*m0)\n\n                Then the operations: \n                    r += 1   (for the clone) \n                    and we did min(m0, n-m0) swaps? so r += min(m0, n-m0) -> but wait, we did min(m0, n-m0) swaps? \n\n                Then we update m = min(n, 2*m0)\n\n                Then if m<n, we do another iteration.\n\n            How many iterations? \n\n                Initially: m0\n                Then m1 = min(n, 2*m0)\n                Then m2 = min(n, 2*m1) = min(n, 4*m0)\n                ...\n\n                This is exponential? so the number of iterations is O(log(n))? \n\n            Then the total operations = (number of clones) + (total swaps) \n\n                = (number of iterations) + (min(m0, n-m0) + min(m1, n-m1) + ... )\n\n            But note: the total swaps = n - m0? because we need to bring n-m0 x's? \n\n            Actually, the entire system has a fixed number of x's: m0 (initially) and then after clones, we have (number of clones+1)*m0? \n\n            And we are moving them arbitrarily? so the total swaps to concentrate n x's in one array is n - m0? \n\n            But the above step-by-step does not account for the entire n-m0? \n\n            Actually, in the first iteration: we moved min(m0, n-m0) x's? \n            Then the first array has m0 + min(m0, n-m0) = min(n, 2*m0) = m1.\n            Then we need to move n - m1 more? \n\n            Then in the next iteration: we move min(m1, n-m1) x's? \n\n            Then the total swaps = min(m0, n-m0) + min(m1, n-m1) + ... until we get to n.\n\n            And the total clones = number of iterations.\n\n            Therefore, the total operations = (number of iterations) + (min(m0, n-m0) + min(m1, n-m1) + ...)\n\n            But note: the entire system's total x's is (number of iterations+1)*m0? \n\n            And we require (number of iterations+1)*m0 >= n? \n\n            And the number of iterations is the minimal k such that (k+1)*m0>=n? \n\n            Then the total swaps = n - m0? \n\n            Why? because we are moving exactly n-m0 x's? \n\n            But in the step-by-step, we are moving min(m_i, n - current) at each step? \n\n            Actually, the total moves is the sum of the moves at each step, which is the total x's moved, which is n - m0? \n\n            So the total swaps = n - m0? \n\n            Then the total operations = (number of iterations) + (n - m0) = k_min + (n - m0)\n\n            And k_min = ceil(n/m0)-1.\n\n            Therefore, the step-by-step simulation gives the same answer.\n\n            But the step-by-step simulation in the while loop:\n\n                Let r = 0 (operations count)\n                Let current_max = m   (the initial max frequency)\n\n                while current_max < n:\n                    # We do a clone: that costs 1 operation -> r += 1\n                    # Then we can move up to current_max x's from the clone to the target? but we don't want to move more than needed? \n                    # We need to move at most n - current_max x's? and we can move at most current_max x's (because the clone has current_max x's) -> so we move move_count = min(current_max, n - current_max)\n                    # Then the target array becomes current_max + move_count = min(n, 2*current_max)\n                    # Then we set current_max = min(n, 2*current_max)\n                    # And we add the moves: r += move_count\n\n                Then print r.\n\n            Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2.\n\n                Iteration1:\n                    current_max=2<6 -> \n                        r += 1 (clone) -> r=1\n                    move_count = min(2, 6-2)=min(2,4)=2\n                    r += 2 -> r=3\n                    current_max = min(6, 2*2)=min(6,4)=4\n\n                Iteration2:\n                    current_max=4<6 -> \n                        r +=1 -> r=4\n                    move_count = min(4, 6-4)=2\n                    r +=2 -> r=6\n                    current_max = min(6, 8)=6 -> break.\n\n                Output 6 -> correct.\n\n            Example: [1,2,1,1] -> n=4, m=3.\n\n                Iteration1:\n                    current_max=3<4 -> \n                        r +=1 -> r=1\n                    move_count = min(3,4-3)=1\n                    r +=1 -> r=2\n                    current_max = min(4,6)=4 -> break.\n\n                Output 2 -> correct.\n\n            Example: [0,0,0,0] -> m=4, n=4 -> skip -> 0.\n\n            Example: [1,1,2,2] -> n=4, m=2.\n\n                Iteration1:\n                    r=1 (clone)\n                    move_count = min(2,4-2)=2\n                    r=1+2=3\n                    current_max = min(4,4)=4 -> break.\n\n                But what is the answer? \n                    We want to form an array of all 1's? \n                    Initially: [1,1,2,2] -> m=2 (for 1 and 2)\n                    After clone: two copies: [1,1,2,2] and [1,1,2,2]\n                    Then we swap: \n                         swap the 2 at index2 of the first array with the 1 at index0 of the second array -> [1,1,1,2] and [2,1,2,2] -> then we need one more swap? \n                    But we did one swap? \n\n                Actually, we moved two 1's? \n                    We can swap the two 2's in the first array with two 1's in the second array? \n                    Then the first array becomes [1,1,1,1] -> done.\n\n                So we did two swaps? and one clone -> total 3 operations.\n\n                The simulation: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n\n            Therefore, the while loop simulation is:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1   # for the clone\n                    move = min(m, n - m)   # we can move up to m x's from the clone to the target, but we only need n-m more? \n                    r += move\n                    m = m + move   # because the target array now has m + move? \n                    # But note: the entire system has (number of arrays) * (original m) = (k+1)*m0? \n                    # and we are moving move x's? so the target array becomes m+move, and the other arrays lose move x's? \n                    # but the maximum frequency in any array: the target array has m+move, and the other arrays have at least m - move? \n                    # but we are not tracking the entire distribution? \n\n                However, the problem: we are only interested in the maximum frequency in any array? \n\n                After the moves, the target array has m+move = min(n, 2*m) -> which is the new maximum? \n\n                Why? \n                    Because we moved up to m x's from one clone? but we might have more arrays? but we are free to swap arbitrarily? so we can always arrange that the target array gets as many as possible? \n\n                Therefore, the new maximum frequency is min(n, 2*m) -> because we started with m and we added up to m? \n\n                So we set m = min(n, 2*m)\n\n            Therefore, the code for the while loop:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1   # clone operation\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move   # because the target array now has m+move? \n                    # but note: m is updated to the new maximum frequency? \n\n            However, wait: \n                m += move -> then m becomes m + min(m, n-m) = min(2*m, n)\n\n            So we can write:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move   # which is min(2*m, n)\n\n            Example: n=6, m=2:\n                Iteration1: \n                    r=0 -> then r=1, move=min(2,4)=2, r=3, m=4.\n                Iteration2:\n                    m=4 <6 -> \n                    r=3+1=4, move=min(4,2)=2, r=6, m=6 -> break.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            Example: n=4, m=3:\n                Iteration1:\n                    r=0 -> r=1, move=min(3,1)=1, r=2, m=4 -> break.\n\n            Example: n=4, m=2:\n                Iteration1:\n                    r=0 -> r=1, move=min(2,2)=2, r=3, m=4 -> break.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code in program2.py is:\n\n                r += 1\n                move = min(m, n - m)\n                r += move\n                m += move\n\n            But note: the variable m is updated.\n\n            However, the condition is while m<n: so we break when m>=n.\n\n            Therefore, we put these three lines in the while loop.\n\n            But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5? \n\n            How many iterations? \n                m starts at m0 (the max frequency in the original array)\n                Then m becomes min(2*m0, n)\n                Then min(4*m0, n) ... \n\n                So the number of iterations is O(log(n))? \n\n            Since n<=10^5, the maximum iterations is about 17? \n\n            So it's efficient.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n                r += 1\n                move = min(m, n - m)\n                r += move\n                m += move\n\n            But note: the code uses n and m? \n\n            The code: \n                n = len(a)   # which is the length of the array? \n                m = max frequency of the elements? \n\n            And we are updating m.\n\n            So we do:\n\n                while m < n:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move\n\n            This will break when m>=n.\n\n            Therefore, we output:\n\n                program1: the missing line is \"b[e] = 1\"\n                program2: the missing block is:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move\n\n            But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and in the specified format.\n\n            Format: \n                {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n            For program1, the missing code is only one line? \n\n            For program2, the missing code is a block of 4 lines? \n\n            However, the TODO in program2 is inside the while loop? and we are to replace the TODO with the block? \n\n            But the TODO is only one line? we are replacing it with 4 lines? \n\n            So we write:\n\n                program1: \"b[e] = 1\"\n\n                program2: \n                    \"    r += 1\\n    move = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += move\\n    m += move\"\n\n            But note: the indentation? the while loop is already indented? \n\n            The current code for program2:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO with:\n\n                r += 1\n                move = min(m, n - m)\n                r += move\n                m += move\n\n            But we must indent each line by 4 more spaces? because the while loop body.\n\n            However, the existing code has:\n\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n            We need to put the block inside the while loop? \n\n            So the completed program2 would be:\n\n                from collections import*\n                for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                    while m<n:\n                        r += 1\n                        move = min(m, n - m)\n                        r += move\n                        m += move\n                    print(r)\n\n            Therefore, the missing block for program2 is the four lines (with proper indentation relative to the while loop). But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the JSON.\n\n            We output as a string with newlines.\n\n            But note: the TODO is at the end of the while loop line? so we need to break the line.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write:\n\n                program2: \"    r += 1\\n    move = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += move\\n    m += move\"\n\n            But the existing while loop line has a comment: \"# TODO: Your code here\", so we remove that and put the block.\n\n            How about:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move\n\n            But the existing code has the while loop on one line? \n\n            Actually, the code is:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            We can write:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move\n\n            So the missing block is the body of the while loop.\n\n            Therefore, we output:\n\n                program1: \"b[e] = 1\"\n                program2: \n                    \"r += 1\\n        move = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += move\\n        m += move\"\n\n            But the indentation: the while loop is already at the same level as the rest? \n\n            The existing code: \n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n            We want to replace the while loop with:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move\n\n            But note: the next line is \"print(r)\" which is not in the loop.\n\n            So we must break the while loop line and put the body.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2 is the body of the while loop (the four lines) with one level of indentation? \n\n            Since the while loop is in a block that is already indented (the for loop), we need to indent the body of the while loop by 8 spaces? but the problem does not specify the exact indentation? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and the missing code is the block that goes inside the while loop.\n\n            We can output:\n\n                \"    r += 1\\n    move = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += move\\n    m += move\"\n\n            But the existing while loop line has no indentation for the body? \n\n            Alternatively, we can output the code as:\n\n                \"\\n    r += 1\\n    move = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += move\\n    m += move\"\n\n            But the problem says: the TODO is in the while loop? so we replace the TODO with the block? \n\n            Actually, the TODO is at the end of the line. We can break the line and then put the block? \n\n            But the problem does not specify. Since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", we output the block as a string with newlines and the same indentation as the surrounding code? \n\n            The surrounding code: the while loop is at the same level as the for loop body? which is 4 spaces? then the body of the while loop should be 8 spaces? \n\n            However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation? \n\n            But the example code for program2: \n                for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                    print(r)\n\n            We want to replace the while loop line with:\n\n                    while m<n:\n                        r += 1\n                        move = min(m, n - m)\n                        r += move\n                        m += move\n\n            But the while loop line is already at 4 spaces? then the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n            Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n                \"    r += 1\\n    move = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += move\\n    m += move\"\n\n            But that would be:\n\n                    while m<n:\n                    r += 1\n                    ...\n\n            which is not indented? \n\n            Actually, we need to output:\n\n                \"\\n        r += 1\\n        move = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += move\\n        m += move\"\n\n            But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n            Alternatively, we can output the block without worrying about the exact indentation? but the problem says the code must run.\n\n            Since the existing code has the while loop on one line, we break it and then put the body with one more indentation level.\n\n            How about:\n\n                program2: \n                    \"\\n        r += 1\\n        move = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += move\\n        m += move\"\n\n            This adds a newline and then 8 spaces for each line? \n\n            But the existing while loop line: we have to remove the comment and break the line? \n\n            The problem does not specify the exact transformation? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and the missing code is the block that goes in the while loop.\n\n            We'll assume that the while loop line is replaced by:\n\n                while m<n:\n\n            and then the block is inserted at the next lines with one more indentation level.\n\n            But the problem says: the TODO is in the while loop? so we replace the TODO with the block? \n\n            Actually, the TODO is at the end of the line. We can simply put the block of code at the TODO position? but that would be:\n\n                while m<n: r += 1; ...   # which is not readable and might be one line? \n\n            But the problem does not specify. \n\n            Since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", we assume we can break the line.\n\n            Therefore, we output for program2 a string that is:\n\n                \"\\n        r += 1\\n        move = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += move\\n        m += move\"\n\n            This will be inserted after the while loop line? \n\n            Actually, the existing while loop line is:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            We remove the comment and then break the line and put the block? \n\n            But the problem does not say we can change the while loop line? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                while m<n: \n                    r += 1\n                    move = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += move\n                    m += move\n\n            So we break the while loop line and then put the block.\n\n            Therefore, the missing block for program2 is the four lines of code, each indented by 4 more spaces than the while loop? \n\n            Since the while loop is at 4 spaces, the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n            But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces? \n\n            However, the provided code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n            We'll output:\n\n                program2: \"    r += 1\\n    move = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += move\\n    m += move\"\n\n            But that is 4 spaces per line? and the while loop is at 4 spaces? so the body would be at 4+4=8? \n\n            Actually, the existing code:\n\n                for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                    while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                    print(r)\n\n            We want:\n\n                for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                    while m<n:\n                        r += 1\n                        move = min(m, n - m)\n                        r += move\n                        m += move\n                    print(r)\n\n            The while loop body is indented by 4 more spaces? so 8 in total? \n\n            But the code we output for the block: \n                \"    r += 1\\n    move = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += move\\n    m += move\"\n\n            This has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? but we need 8? \n\n            Alternatively, we can output 8 spaces per line? \n\n            But the problem does not specify. \n\n            Since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the body of the while loop, we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation as the surrounding block? \n\n            The surrounding block (the for loop body) is indented by 4 spaces. The while loop body should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n            Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n                \"        r += 1\\n        move = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += move\\n        m += move\"\n\n            This is 8 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n            But note: the while loop line itself is at 4 spaces? and we break it to a new line? \n\n            How do we break? \n\n            We replace the line:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            with:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    [the block]\n\n            So the block is at 8 spaces.\n\n            Therefore, we output:\n\n                program1: \"b[e] = 1\"\n                program2: \"        r += 1\\n        move = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += move\\n        m += move\"\n\n            But note: the program2 code has a trailing newline? \n\n            Alternatively, we can output without the last newline? \n\n            The problem does not specify.\n\n            We'll output as a string with the four lines.\n\n            Let me write the JSON:\n\n                {\n                    \"program1\": \"b[e] = 1\",\n                    \"program2\": \"        r += 1\\n        move = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += move\\n        m += move\"\n                }\n\n            But note: the program2 block: the last line does not have a trailing newline? \n\n            Actually, the string has four lines, each ending with a newline? \n\n            But we used \\n, so it's one string with newlines.\n\n            Alternatively, we can write without the last newline? but it doesn't matter because the next line is \"print(r)\" which is at the same level as the while loop? \n\n            We output as above.\n\n            However, the problem says: the total n over test cases for program2 is <=10^5? and the while loop runs in O(log(n))? so it's acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, we output the JSON.\n\n            But note: the program1 code: the except block for b is:\n\n                except KeyError:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO with \"b[e] = 1\"\n\n            So the completed program1 for that part:\n\n                try:\n                    ans += b[e]\n                    b[e] += 1\n                except KeyError:\n                    b[e] = 1\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            We are done."
