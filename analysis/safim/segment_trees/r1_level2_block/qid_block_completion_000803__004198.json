But wait, we didn't check for equality? Actually, we break because i==j. But we have an opportunity: Alice eats the first candy (1) and Bob eats the last two (1,1) -> that would be 1 and 2? Not equal. Or Alice eats the first two (1,2) and Bob eats the last one (1) -> 3 and 1 -> not equal. So the best is 2. But what if we have [1,1,2,1]?

But we have an equality at i=0,j=3 and then at i=1,j=2? Actually, we didn't check at i=1,j=2? Because after updating the sums we had lsum=2 and rsum=3 -> then we moved i to 2 and then the loop breaks. But we didn't check for equality at i=1,j=2? Actually, we did: after updating the sums, we are at the top of the loop and we check: lsum=2, rsum=3 -> then we move i to 2 and add arr[2]=2 -> then i=2 and j=2 -> break. But we never checked for equality at (i=1, j=2) because we updated the sums and then the condition lsum<rsum was true. So we moved i.\n\nBut note: we are always checking the current state. The state at (i=1, j=2) had lsum=2 and rsum=3 -> not equal. So we move the pointer with the smaller sum. So the algorithm is correct.

So the code for program1.py:\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n      best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j)) i += 1\n      j -= 1\n      if i < j:\n          lsum += arr[i]\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: what if we have an array [0,0,0]? Step1: i=0, j=2: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equality -> best= (0+1)+(3-2)=1+1=2 -> then update: i=1, j=1 -> then we break. Then we output 2. But what if we have [0,0,0,0]? \n  Step1: i=0, j=3: equality -> best= (1+1)=2 -> then update: i=1, j=2 -> then we update sums: lsum=0+0=0, rsum=0+0=0 -> then we have equality again -> best = max(2, (1+1)+(4-2)=2+2=4) -> then update: i=2, j=1 -> break. Output 4. So that's correct. But note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases <= 200000. So we are using two pointers and each test case runs in O(n). That's acceptable.",

The known solution for this problem (from CodeForces) is: \n      Let b = [0] * n\n      We want to make a to b.\n\n      We can use a difference array: \n          d0 = a0 - b0 = a0\n          d_i = (a_i - b_i) - (a_{i-1} - b_{i-1}) = a_i - a_{i-1}   for i>=1, because b_i and b_{i-1} are 0. But then the operations:\n\n          Operation1: on prefix ending at i: This operation would change: \n                  d0 = d0 - 1\n                  d_i = d_i + 1   (if i < n)\n          Operation2: on suffix starting at i:\n                  d_i = d_i - 1\n                  (and if we had a d_n, we would add 1, but we don't have d_n)\n          Operation3: \n                  d0 = d0 + 1\n                  (and if we had a d_n, we would subtract 1)\n\n      But without a d_n, we are not tracking the last element.",

The print statement: \n      print(tot - minv + abs(minv) + int(list[len(list)-1]))\n\n  Note: \n      tot - minv + abs(minv) = \n          if minv>=0: then abs(minv)=minv, so tot - minv + minv = tot. if minv<0: then abs(minv) = -minv, so tot - minv - minv = tot - 2*minv.

Another: \n          tot += diff * (val+2) \n          val0: 1*2=2, val1:3*3=9 -> 11, then 11+3=14. Note: the sample [2,2] has only one diff: diff0=0, so tot=0, then 0+2=2. How about: \n      if diff>=0:\n          tot += diff\n          minv = min(minv, int(list[val+1]))\n      then for [7,6,3]: \n          val0: diff=1 -> tot=1, minv=min(7,6)=6\n          val1: diff=3 -> tot=4, minv=min(6,3)=3\n      then print: tot - minv + abs(minv) + last = 4 - 3 + 3 + 3 = 7.\n\n  not 13. How about we do in the TODO:\n      if diff>=0:\n          tot += diff\n      and also do something else? Another idea: \n      if diff>=0:\n          tot += diff\n      else:\n          # for negative diff, we do nothing in the TODO? and then after the loop, we have minv = the first element, but we are not using it in the loop. For [7,6,3]: \n      tot=1+3=4. then print: 4 - 7 + 7 + 3 = 4+3=7. For [2,2]: \n      tot=0. then 0 - 2 + 2 + 2 = 2. For a test: [1,2,1] (n=3) \n      diff0 = 1-2 = -1 -> skip.\n      diff1 = 2-1 = 1 -> tot=1. minv=1. then print: 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 2. But what is the expected for [1,2,1]?",

      "answer": "To solve the given problems, we need to address two separate programming challenges. The first problem involves finding the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the total weight of candies eaten by Alice (from the left) equals that eaten by Bob (from the right). The second problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the moisture levels of all trees to zero using specific operations.\n\n### Approach for Program1: Candy Eating Problem\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Alice and Bob eat candies from the left and right ends, respectively. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten while ensuring the sum of weights eaten by Alice equals that eaten by Bob.\n2. **Intuition**: Use a two-pointer technique where one pointer starts at the beginning (left) and the other at the end (right). Move the pointers towards the center, maintaining the sum of weights from both ends. When the sums are equal, record the total candies eaten and continue moving the pointers to find a better solution.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Initialize two pointers, `i` (left) and `j` (right), and their respective sums, `lsum` and `rsum`.\n   - While `i` is less than `j`:\n     - If `lsum` is less than `rsum`, move the left pointer right and add the next candy's weight to `lsum`.\n     - If `rsum` is less than `lsum`, move the right pointer left and add the next candy's weight to `rsum`.\n     - If the sums are equal, update the maximum candies eaten, move both pointers towards the center, and update their sums if possible.\n4. **Complexity**: O(n) per test case, where n is the number of candies. The total complexity across all test cases is O(t * n), which is efficient given the constraints.\n\n### Approach for Program2: Tree Moisture Problem\n1. **Problem Analysis**:",
      "note": "the answer is incomplete"
    },
    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies eaten by Alice and Bob such that the total weight eaten by Alice (from the left) equals the total weight eaten by Bob (from the right). We cannot skip candies when eating from the left or right.\n\nThe provided code uses two pointers, one starting at the left (i) and one at the right (j). We have two sums: lsum (Alice's current sum) and rsum (Bob's current sum). We move the pointers until they meet.\n\nThe idea:\n- We start with lsum = arr[0] and rsum = arr[-1].\n- We then have a while loop (i < j). \n  - If lsum < rsum, we move the left pointer to the right and add the next candy to lsum.\n  - If rsum < lsum, we move the right pointer to the left and add the next candy to rsum.\n  - If they are equal, we have a candidate: the total candies eaten so far is (i+1) from the left and (n - j) from the right, so total = (i+1) + (n - j). We record this in best (if it's the maximum so far). Then we move both pointers: we move the left pointer to the right (adding the next candy) and the right pointer to the left (adding the next candy) to look for more possibilities.\n\nHowever, note that after finding an equality, we must continue to look for more because there might be a longer sequence? Actually, we can only have one contiguous block for Alice and one for Bob, and they don't overlap. But note: the problem says they want to maximize the total number of candies. So when we have an equality, we record the total candies and then we have to move one of the pointers to try to find another equality? Actually, we can move both because if we leave one pointer and move the other, we break the equality. But note: we are allowed to have multiple segments? No, they each eat one contiguous segment from their respective ends.\n\nBut note: the problem says Alice eats from the left in a row and Bob from the right in a row. And they cannot eat the same candy. So the segments are disjoint. The total candies eaten is the number of candies Alice ate plus the number Bob ate.\n\nThe provided code currently does:\n  else:\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe need to complete that part.\n\nWe should set best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j)) and then we move both pointers? Because we have used the current i and j. Then we move i to the right and j to the left, updating the sums.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because if we move both, we are effectively starting a new segment. However, we are allowed to have only one contiguous segment for Alice and one for Bob. So we are just trying to find a point where the left part and the right part have the same sum. We are allowed to have multiple such points? And we want the one that maximizes the total candies.\n\nSo in the else block, we do:\n  best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # because we have i+1 candies on the left (from index0 to i) and n - j candies on the right (from j to n-1)\n  Then we update: i += 1, and add arr[i] to lsum? But note: we are at a state where lsum == rsum. Then we move both to see if we can get another equality? Actually, we can also try to extend: we move the left pointer and then the right pointer? But note: we are not required to have contiguous segments that are adjacent? Actually, the segments are independent: Alice eats from the left until some point, Bob from the right until some point, and they must not overlap.\n\nBut the problem does not require that the entire set of candies is eaten. So we can have a gap in the middle.\n\nSo after we have an equality, we can try to extend: we move the left pointer one step to the right and then the right pointer one step to the left? Actually, we can do that in the next iteration. But note: we are in the else block. We can do:\n\n  best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n  i += 1\n  lsum += arr[i]   # but we must check that i < j? because we are in the loop condition i<j, and after i+=1, we might break the condition? Actually, we are going to break the loop if i becomes >= j.\n\nBut note: we are at a state where i and j are at least one apart? Because we are in the while loop with i<j. So after we do i+=1, we have i and j that might become i==j? Then we break. But we also have to update the right pointer? Actually, we are only updating the left. Then in the next iteration, we might have lsum > rsum? So we break the equality.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n  # Then we move one step from the left to try to find a longer sequence? \n  # But note: we cannot extend the same segment? Because we are going to add one more candy to the left and then we break the equality. So we have to move both? Actually, we can try to move both? \n\n  i += 1\n  j -= 1\n  if i < j:   # to avoid index out of bounds\n      lsum += arr[i]\n      rsum += arr[j]\n  else:\n      break\n\nBut wait: what if we have multiple equalities? For example, we might have:\n  [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1]\n  Initially: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality: total=2 (1 from left, 1 from right) -> then we move both: i=1, j=4 -> lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> equality: total=4 (2 from left, 2 from right) -> then move both: i=2, j=3 -> lsum=3+3=6, rsum=3+3=6 -> total=6 (3 from left, 3 from right) -> then i=2, j=3 -> then we do i+=1 -> i=3, j=2 -> break.\n\nBut note: when we move both, we are effectively starting a new state. We are not required to have the same segment? We are just looking for any two segments (one from left and one from right) that have the same sum and we want the maximum total candies.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n  i += 1\n  j -= 1\n  if i < j:\n      lsum += arr[i]\n      rsum += arr[j]\n  else:\n      break\n\nBut what if after moving both, we break the condition? Then we break. But note: we might have an equality again? So we should not break the loop? Actually, we break the loop only when i>=j. So we can simply do:\n\n  best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n  i += 1\n  j -= 1\n  if i < j:\n      lsum += arr[i]\n      rsum += arr[j]\n  else:\n      break\n\nBut what if we don't break? Then we continue the while loop. However, note that we are in the else block and then we update the sums and then the while loop condition holds? So we can just update and then the next iteration will check again.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the inner break and just update and then let the while loop run? But we must update the sums only if we are moving the pointers. However, we are moving the pointers and then updating the sums. But note: we are moving the pointers and then we are adding the new candy at the new pointer. This is correct.\n\nBut what if we don't have an else? We can do:\n\n  else:\n      best = (i+1) + (n - j)\n      i += 1\n      j -= 1\n      if i < j:\n          lsum += arr[i]\n          rsum += arr[j]\n      else:\n          break\n\nBut note: we must break if i>=j? Actually, the while loop condition is i<j, so after we do i+=1 and j-=1, if i becomes >= j, then the next iteration won't run. So we don't need the inner break? We can just update the sums only when i < j? Because if i==j, we break and if i>j, we break. But if i==j, we break and we don't update the sums? That's fine.\n\nBut what if we have an equality and then after moving both, i becomes j? Then we break and we don't update the sums? That's acceptable.\n\nHowever, note: we might have an equality at the last step? For example, if we have an array of even length and we are at the middle? Then we break.\n\nBut what if we have an array of odd length? Then we break when i and j cross.\n\nBut note: we are updating the sums only when i < j? So if we move and then i==j, we break without updating? That's acceptable because we cannot have two segments that don't overlap when i==j? Actually, the candy at i (which is j) would be in the middle and cannot be eaten by both.\n\nSo the plan for the else block is:\n\n  best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n  i += 1\n  j -= 1\n  if i < j:\n      lsum += arr[i]\n      rsum += arr[j]\n  # else: we break the loop? Actually, the while loop condition will break.\n\nBut note: we are in the while loop, so after updating, we will check the condition again. So we don't need to break explicitly. We can simply update the pointers and the sums and then the loop condition will handle it.\n\nBut what if i becomes j? Then we break. If i becomes greater than j? Then we break.\n\nBut what if we have an array of length 2? \n  Initially: i=0, j=1 -> lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[1]\n  If they are equal: then we set best = (0+1) + (2-1) = 1+1 = 2.\n  Then we do i+=1 -> i=1, j-=1 -> j=0 -> now i>j -> break.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut what if we have an array of length 3?\n  [1,2,1]\n  Initially: i=0, j=2 -> lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality -> best = (0+1)+(3-2)=1+1=2.\n  Then we update: i=1, j=1 -> then we break the loop? because i==j -> the while condition i<j fails.\n\nBut note: we cannot have the middle candy? Because if Alice eats the first and the second, then Bob cannot eat the second? So the middle candy is not eaten. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut what if we have [1,3,1]? \n  Initially: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality -> total=2.\n  Then we update: i=1, j=1 -> break. Then we output 2.\n\nBut what if we have [1,1,1]? \n  Initially: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality -> total=2.\n  Then we update: i=1, j=1 -> break. But note: we could also have Alice eating the first two and Bob eating the last two? That would be total=4? But wait, that would require Alice eating [1,1] and Bob eating [1,1]? But the middle candy is shared? That's not allowed. So we cannot.\n\nBut wait: the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot eat the same candy. So if Alice eats the first two, then Bob can only eat the last one? Because the middle candy is already eaten by Alice. So Bob would get 1, and Alice has 2 -> not equal. So the only possibility is Alice eats the first and Bob eats the last -> total=2.\n\nBut what if we have [1, 2, 2, 1]? \n  Step1: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality -> total=2 (from left:1, from right:1) -> then update: i=1, j=2 -> lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> equality -> total= (2 from left: [1,2] and 2 from right: [2,1]) -> total=4. Then update: i=2, j=1 -> break.\n\nSo we get best=4.\n\nBut note: the two segments: Alice eats [1,2] and Bob eats [2,1] -> but the second candy (index1) is 2 and the third candy (index2) is 2? Actually, the array is [1,2,2,1]. Alice eats the first two: [1,2] -> sum=3. Bob eats the last two: [2,1] -> sum=3. But note: the candy at index1 (the second) is eaten by Alice and the candy at index2 (the third) is eaten by Bob? They are distinct. So that's valid.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n  Initialize:\n      i = 0, j = n-1\n      lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n      best = 0\n\n  while i < j:\n      if lsum < rsum:\n          i += 1\n          lsum += arr[i]\n      elif rsum < lsum:\n          j -= 1\n          rsum += arr[j]\n      else:   # equal\n          best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n          i += 1\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j:   # we can update the sums for the next iteration\n              lsum += arr[i]\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          else:\n              break   # actually, we can break because the next iteration condition fails? But we break explicitly to avoid adding when i>=j? \n\n  But note: after the else block, we break out of the if-else but then the while condition is checked. So we don't need the break? We can do:\n\n      else:\n          best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n          i += 1\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j:\n              lsum += arr[i]\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          else:\n              # break the loop? Actually, we can just let the loop condition break? \n              # But if we update the sums and then i and j become such that i>=j, then the loop will break. \n              # However, if we don't update the sums, then we break the loop? But we don't need to do anything.\n\n  Actually, we can avoid the if-else in the else block and do:\n\n      else:\n          best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n          i += 1\n          j -= 1\n          if i < j:\n              lsum += arr[i]\n              rsum += arr[j]\n          # else: we break the loop? Actually, the while loop condition will break.\n\n  But what if i becomes j? Then we break. But if we don't update the sums, then the next iteration doesn't run? That's acceptable.\n\n  However, note: if we have an array of even length and we are at the last equality? Then after updating i and j, we have i>j? Then we break. But if we have an array of odd length, we break when i==j? Then we break.\n\n  But what if we have an equality and then after updating i and j, we have i==j? Then we break. But we might have a possibility that we can get another equality? Actually, no, because we have moved both pointers and now they are at the same candy? Then we break.\n\n  However, note: we are not updating the sums when i==j? So we break. That's acceptable.\n\n  But what if we have an equality and then after updating, we have i < j? Then we update the sums and continue.\n\n  So the code for the else block is:\n\n      best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n      i += 1\n      j -= 1\n      if i < j:\n          lsum += arr[i]\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\n  But note: what if we have an equality and then after updating the pointers, we have i==j? Then we break without updating the sums? That's acceptable.\n\n  However, what if we have an equality and then after updating, we have i<j? Then we update the sums and then the next iteration runs? That's what we want.\n\nBut wait: what if we have an array [1,1,1,1]? \n  Step1: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality -> best = (0+1)+(4-3)=1+1=2 -> then update: i=1, j=2 -> now i<j -> so we update: lsum = 1+arr[1]=1+1=2, rsum=1+arr[2]=1+1=2 -> then we enter the loop again: now i=1, j=2 -> lsum=2, rsum=2 -> equality -> best = max(2, (1+1)+(4-2)=2+2=4) -> best=4. Then update: i=2, j=1 -> break.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious: when we update the pointers and then update the sums, we are adding the candy at the new pointer. But we are not skipping any candy? Because we moved the pointer and then added the candy at the new pointer.\n\nHowever, what if we have an array [1,2,1,1]? \n  Step1: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality -> best=2 -> then update: i=1, j=2 -> then update sums: lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+1=2 -> then in the next iteration: lsum=3 > rsum=2 -> then we move j: j becomes 1 -> but now i=1, j=1 -> break. But wait, we didn't check for equality? Actually, we break because i==j. But we have an opportunity: Alice eats the first candy (1) and Bob eats the last two (1,1) -> that would be 1 and 2? Not equal. Or Alice eats the first two (1,2) and Bob eats the last one (1) -> 3 and 1 -> not equal. So the best is 2.\n\nBut what if we have [1,1,2,1]? \n  Step1: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equality -> best=2 -> then update: i=1, j=2 -> lsum=1+1=2, rsum=1+2=3 -> then we have lsum<rsum -> move i: i=2 -> lsum=2+2=4 -> now i=2, j=2 -> break. But we have an equality at i=0,j=3 and then at i=1,j=2? Actually, we didn't check at i=1,j=2? Because after updating the sums we had lsum=2 and rsum=3 -> then we moved i to 2 and then the loop breaks. But we didn't check for equality at i=1,j=2? Actually, we did: after updating the sums, we are at the top of the loop and we check: lsum=2, rsum=3 -> then we move i to 2 and add arr[2]=2 -> then i=2 and j=2 -> break. But we never checked for equality at (i=1, j=2) because we updated the sums and then the condition lsum<rsum was true. So we moved i.\n\nBut note: we are always checking the current state. The state at (i=1, j=2) had lsum=2 and rsum=3 -> not equal. So we move the pointer with the smaller sum.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nBut note: what if we have an array [1,2,3,4,5,6] and we never get an equality? Then best remains 0? But the problem says: they want to be fair. If they cannot, then they eat 0? The problem says: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" and if they cannot be fair, then 0? The note says: for the third test case, the answer is 0.\n\nSo we output best. But note: we initialize best=0, and if we never get an equality, we output 0.\n\nBut what if we have an array [0]? \n  Then n=1: \n      i=0, j=0 -> the while condition i<j fails -> so we break and output 0? \n  But note: they cannot eat the same total weight? Because if Alice eats the candy, then Bob has nothing? And if Bob eats the candy, then Alice has nothing? And if both try to eat, they cannot because they cannot eat the same candy. So 0.\n\nBut what if we have an array [0,0]? \n  Then: i=0, j=1: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equality -> best = (0+1)+(2-1)=1+1=2 -> then update: i=1, j=0 -> break. Then output 2.\n\nSo the code for program1.py:\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n      best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n      i += 1\n      j -= 1\n      if i < j:\n          lsum += arr[i]\n          rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: what if we have an array [0,0,0]? \n  Step1: i=0, j=2: lsum=0, rsum=0 -> equality -> best= (0+1)+(3-2)=1+1=2 -> then update: i=1, j=1 -> then we break. Then we output 2.\n\nBut what if we have [0,0,0,0]? \n  Step1: i=0, j=3: equality -> best= (1+1)=2 -> then update: i=1, j=2 -> then we update sums: lsum=0+0=0, rsum=0+0=0 -> then we have equality again -> best = max(2, (1+1)+(4-2)=2+2=4) -> then update: i=2, j=1 -> break. Output 4.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut note: the problem constraints: the total n over test cases <= 200000. So we are using two pointers and each test case runs in O(n). That's acceptable.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: We have an array a[0..n-1]. We can do three operations:\n  1. Choose a position i and decrease the moisture of trees 1 to i (prefix up to i) by 1.\n  2. Choose a position i and decrease the moisture of trees i to n (suffix from i) by 1.\n  3. Increase the moisture of all trees by 1.\n\nWe want the minimum number of operations to make all trees moisture 0.\n\nThe provided code:\n\n  for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n      tot = 0\n      list = line.split(' ')\n      list2 = [0] + list\n      minv = int(list[0])\n      for val in range(len(list)-1):\n          diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])\n          if (diff >= 0):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n      print(tot-minv+abs(minv)+int(list[len(list)-1]))\n\nThis code is confusing. Let me try to understand.\n\nWe are reading the input: \n  [*open(0)] reads all lines from stdin.\n  [2::2] takes every second line starting from index2 (so the first line of the test case is skipped, and then the second line of each test case is taken? Actually, the first two lines are: first line t, then for each test case: first line n, second line the array. So [2::2] would take the second line of the first test case, then the second line of the second test case, etc.\n\nBut note: the first line is t, then the first test case: first line n, second line the array. Then the second test case: first line n, second line the array. So the lines we are iterating over are the arrays (the second lines of each test case). And we skip the first two lines? Actually, [2::2] means starting at index2 (the third line) and then every two lines. But the input:\n\n  Line0: t\n  Line1: n1\n  Line2: array1\n  Line3: n2\n  Line4: array2\n\nSo [2::2] gives Line2, Line4, ... -> the arrays.\n\nThen for each array line:\n\n  tot = 0\n  list = line.split(' ')   # the array of strings of the numbers\n  list2 = [0] + list      # so list2[0]=0, list2[1]=first element, etc.\n  minv = int(list[0])     # the first element of the array\n\nThen we loop for val in range(len(list)-1): \n  That is, from 0 to len(list)-2.\n\n  Then: diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])\n\nWait, what is list2[val+1]? \n  list2[val+1] = the element at index val+1 in the original array? \n  But note: list2 has an extra 0 at the front. So:\n      list2[0] = 0\n      list2[1] = list[0] = a0\n      list2[2] = list[1] = a1\n      ...\n\n  Then: \n      diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])\n\n  But note: list[val+1] is the element at index val+1 in the original array? \n  Actually, list is the array of the current test case. So:\n\n      Let the array be a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}\n      list = [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}]\n      list2 = [0, a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}]\n\n  Then for val in range(len(list)-1): \n      val goes from 0 to n-2.\n\n      diff = list2[val+1] - list[val+1] \n          = (if val+1 is the index in list2) then:\n          when val=0: \n              list2[1] = a0, list[1] = a1 -> diff = a0 - a1\n          when val=1:\n              list2[2] = a1, list[2] = a2 -> diff = a1 - a2\n\n  So diff = a_{val} - a_{val+1}\n\nThen we have an if: if diff>=0, then we do something.\n\nBut what is the meaning of this diff? \n\nLooking at the provided print statement: \n  print(tot-minv+abs(minv)+int(list[len(list)-1]))\n\nThis is confusing. \n\nWe need to find the minimum number of operations.\n\nNote: the operations can be represented as:\n\n  Operation 1 (prefix decrement): can be represented as a vector of decrements: [1,1,...,1,0,0,...,0] (with the first i ones being 1)\n  Operation 2 (suffix decrement): [0,...,0,1,1,...,1] (from i to the end)\n  Operation 3 (global increment): [1,1,...,1] (everywhere)\n\nNote that operation 3 is the opposite of the others. We can think of the net effect as:\n\n  Let x_i be the number of times we apply the prefix operation ending at i (so we apply for positions 1..i). \n  Let y_i be the number of times we apply the suffix operation starting at i (so we apply for positions i..n).\n  Let z be the number of times we apply the global increment.\n\nThen the net effect on the j-th tree is:\n  a_j + z - (x_j + x_{j+1} + ... + x_n) - (y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_j) = 0\n\nBut note: the prefix operation at index i affects trees 1..i (if we index trees from 1 to n). But in our array, we index from 0 to n-1.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a different formulation.\n\nWe note that the problem is similar to \"Removing Cards\" or \"Drying Plates\" problems. \n\nWe can consider the following:\n\n  Let d_i be the net operations that affect the i-th tree. \n  The operations that affect the i-th tree are:\n      - Every global increment: +z (for all trees)\n      - Every prefix operation that covers i: we have to subtract the number of prefix operations that have index >= i. Let x_i be the number of prefix operations that end at i? Actually, if we do a prefix operation ending at j, then it affects trees 0 to j-1 (if we index from 0). But the problem says trees 1..i -> so if we index trees from 1 to n, then a prefix operation at i affects trees 1..i. In 0-indexed, it affects trees 0 to i-1? \n\nAlternatively, we can reframe:\n\n  We can define:\n      Let f(i) = number of prefix operations that end at i (so they cover [0, i-1] in 0-indexed? Actually, the problem says \"prefix of length i\" -> trees 1..i. So in 0-indexed, trees 0 to i-1.\n\n  Similarly, a suffix operation starting at i (0-indexed) would cover trees i to n-1.\n\n  And the global operation adds 1 to every tree.\n\n  Then the net for tree j (0-indexed) is:\n      a_j + z - (number of prefix operations that end at an index >= j+1) - (number of suffix operations that start at an index <= j) = 0\n\n  Let:\n      P_j = number of prefix operations that end at an index >= j+1 -> so they cover tree j? \n          Actually, a prefix operation ending at k covers trees 0 to k-1. So if k>=j+1, then j is in [0, k-1] -> so yes.\n      S_j = number of suffix operations that start at an index <= j -> a suffix operation starting at k covers trees k to n-1. So if k<=j, then j is in [k, n-1] -> so yes.\n\n  Then: a_j + z - P_j - S_j = 0  => P_j + S_j = a_j + z.\n\nBut note: we have one equation per tree and we are free to choose the entire set of operations (nonnegative integers for each prefix, suffix, and z). \n\nBut we want to minimize the total operations: total = (sum of all prefix operations) + (sum of all suffix operations) + z.\n\nThis seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a known solution for this problem. \n\nKnown solution for \"Minimum Operations to make the array zero\" (similar to CodeForces problems) is:\n\n  We note that we can represent the operations as:\n\n      Let x0 = z (the global increment, which is negative of the global decrement we are allowed? Actually, we are allowed to add, but we need to get to zero. So we can think of the net effect: we are allowed to subtract on prefixes, subtract on suffixes, and add globally. So we can also think of the net effect as:\n\n          a_i = (prefix operations that cover i) + (suffix operations that cover i) - z\n\n      But wait, we want a_i to become 0, so:\n\n          (prefix_i + suffix_i) - z = a_i   => prefix_i + suffix_i = a_i + z.\n\n  We want to minimize: (total prefix operations) + (total suffix operations) + z.\n\n  But note: the prefix operations are defined per ending index, and the suffix operations per starting index.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a greedy or difference array.\n\n  Insight: \n      Let d0 = a0, d1 = a1 - a0, d2 = a2 - a1, ... , d_{n-1} = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}, and d_n = -a_{n-1}.\n\n  Then the operations can be seen as:\n\n      Operation 1 (prefix ending at i): subtracts 1 from d0, and adds 1 to d_i (if we consider the difference array of the operations).\n      Operation 2 (suffix starting at i): adds 1 to d_i and subtracts 1 at d_n (or beyond) but we don't have beyond.\n      Operation 3 (global): adds 1 to d0 and subtracts 1 at d_n (or beyond) but we don't have beyond? Actually, global operation: it adds 1 to every element, so the differences: \n          d0 = (a0+1) -> becomes d0+1\n          d1 = (a1+1) - (a0+1) = d1\n          ... so the differences remain the same? \n\n  Actually, the global operation does not change the differences between consecutive elements? \n\n  But note: we are allowed to do global increments arbitrarily. So we can set z arbitrarily. \n\n  We can consider the following:\n\n      Let b_i = a_i + z. Then we require that b_i = prefix_i + suffix_i.\n\n      And the cost is: (sum of prefix operations) + (sum of suffix operations) + z.\n\n      How to express the prefix operations? \n          Let p_i = number of prefix operations ending at i (so covering trees 0 to i-1). Then the total prefix operations is sum_i p_i.\n          Similarly, let q_i = number of suffix operations starting at i (covering trees i to n-1). Then the total suffix operations is sum_i q_i.\n\n      Then for tree0: \n          b0 = p_0 + p_1 + ... + p_{n-1} + q_0   [because tree0 is covered by every prefix operation (since every prefix operation ends at some index>=0) and by the suffix operations that start at 0]\n\n      But wait, a prefix operation ending at i covers tree0 only if i>=0? Actually, tree0 is always covered by every prefix operation? \n\n      Alternatively, we can define:\n\n          Let P_i = p_0 + p_1 + ... + p_i   (then the number of prefix operations that cover tree j is P_{n-1} - P_{j}? Not exactly).\n\n  This is complex.\n\nKnown similar problem: CodeForces \"Three Operations\" (or similar). \n\nThere is a known solution for this problem: \n\n  Let d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i>=1, and d[0] = a[0].\n  Then the answer is max(a[0], a[n-1], max(|d[i]|))? \n\nBut the sample: \n  First test case: [2,2] -> \n      d0 = 2, d1 = 0 -> then answer = max(2,2,0)=2? \n      But the sample says: \"it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times\". So total operations=2. \n      How does that work? \n          We do two global increments: then the array becomes [4,4]. Then we need to subtract 4 from each? \n          But we can do: \n              Operation1: prefix ending at 2: subtract [1,1] -> [3,3]\n              Operation1: prefix ending at 2: subtract [1,1] -> [2,2]\n              Operation1: prefix ending at 2: subtract [1,1] -> [1,1]\n              Operation1: prefix ending at 2: subtract [1,1] -> [0,0] -> 4 operations? \n          But wait, we also have operation3: we did two global increments? That's 2 operations. Then we did 4 subtract operations? Total 6? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n      Operation3: twice -> [4,4]\n      Then we do operation1: prefix ending at 1: subtract [1,0] -> [3,4] -> not allowed? because we want to get to [0,0]. \n\n  Actually, the sample says: \"apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times\". But then we have [4,4]. How do we get to [0,0]? \n      We can do operation1 (prefix) twice on the entire array (prefix ending at 2) twice: then [4-2, 4-2] = [2,2] -> then we need to remove 2 more? \n      But we can do operation1 on prefix of length1: then [1,2] -> then operation2 on suffix of length1: then [1,1] -> then operation1 on entire: [0,0]. \n      That's 2 (global) + 2 (prefix entire) + 1 (prefix1) + 1 (suffix1) = 6.\n\n  But the sample says 2 operations? \n\n  Rethink: the operations are:\n      Operation3: increase all by 1 -> we did twice: then we have [4,4]. \n      But then we can also do negative operations? The problem says:\n          Operation1: decrease a prefix by 1.\n          Operation2: decrease a suffix by 1.\n          Operation3: increase all by 1.\n\n      We want to get to 0. \n      We can do: \n          Operation3: twice -> [4,4] (if we started at [2,2]).\n          Then we do operation1: on the entire array (prefix of length2) 4 times: then [0,0]. \n          Total operations: 2+4 = 6.\n\n      Or we can do without global increment: \n          Operation1 on prefix of length2: 2 times -> [0,0] -> 2 operations? \n          But then why would we use global increment? \n\n  The sample says: \"it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times\". That doesn't make sense because then the array becomes [4,4] and we are not at zero.\n\n  Actually, the sample input is: \n      \"2\n       2\n       2 2\"\n\n  And the output is 2.\n\n  How can we achieve it with 2 operations? \n      We can do two global increments? Then we have [4,4] -> not zero.\n      We can do two global decrements? But we only have global increment. \n\n  Rethink the operations: \n      Operation3: increase all by 1. \n      But we can also consider the possibility of negative counts? \n\n  Actually, we can also do negative operations? The problem doesn't say we can't. But the operations are defined as \"decrease\" and \"increase\", so we can only do nonnegative times.\n\n  How about: \n      We do operation3: -2 times? That would be a decrease by 2 globally. But we are only allowed to do nonnegative times.\n\n  So we must use only the operations in the positive direction.\n\n  Another possibility: \n      We can do operation1 on the entire array (prefix of length2) twice: then [0,0]. That's 2 operations.\n\n  So why did the sample say \"apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times\"? \n\n  Let me read the sample note: \"In the first test case it's enough to apply the operation of adding 1 to the whole array 2 times.\" -> but that would give [4,4] and not [0,0]. \n\n  There is a known solution for this problem: \n      The answer is: \n          ans = max( a[0], a[n-1], ceil( (total_positive_diff) / 2 ) ) \n      ? \n\n  After checking known problems: \n      This is exactly the same as CodeForces problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1661/problem/C\n      Or similar to \"Water the Trees\", but note the operations are different.\n\n  But wait, the problem in the note: \n      Second test case: [7, 6, 3] -> \n          The sample says: \n              apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3: \n                  [7-4, 6-4, 3-4] = [3,2,-1] -> not allowed? because we can't go negative? \n          But the sample says: get an array [6,0,3] -> wait, how?\n\n  Let me re-read: \n      \"apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3\"\n\n  How? \n      The array is [7,6,3]. \n      If we apply a prefix operation of length3 four times: \n          7 - 4 = 3, 6-4=2, 3-4=-1 -> not [6,0,3].\n\n  The sample says: \n      \"apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3\"\n\n  This doesn't add up.\n\n  Let me read the sample again: \n      \"In the second test case you can apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3\"\n\n  This is likely a typo. It should be: \n      We apply the operation of type1 (prefix) 4 times on prefix of length 3: \n          [7,6,3] -> [7-4, 6-4, 3-4] = [3,2,-1] -> not [6,0,3].\n\n  Alternatively, maybe they meant: \n      We apply the operation of type1 on prefix of length1: 6 times: \n          [7-6, 6, 3] = [1,6,3]\n      Then type2 on suffix of length1: 3 times: \n          [1,6,3-3] = [1,6,0] -> not [6,0,3].\n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  Another possibility: \n      The sample says: \n          \"apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3\"\n\n  How can we get 6? \n      We start with 7, and we decrease the prefix of length3 by 1 -> 6,5,2 -> then again: 5,4,1 -> then again: 4,3,0 -> then again: 3,2,-1 -> not 6.\n\n  I see the sample input is: \n      \"3\n       7 6 3\"\n\n  And the sample output is 13.\n\n  The known solution for this problem (from CodeForces) is: \n      Let b = [0] * n\n      We want to make a to b.\n\n      We can use a difference array: \n          d0 = a0 - b0 = a0\n          d_i = (a_i - b_i) - (a_{i-1} - b_{i-1}) = a_i - a_{i-1}   for i>=1, because b_i and b_{i-1} are 0.\n\n      But then the operations:\n\n          Operation1: on prefix ending at i: \n              This operation would change: \n                  d0 = d0 - 1\n                  d_i = d_i + 1   (if i < n)\n          Operation2: on suffix starting at i:\n                  d_i = d_i - 1\n                  (and if we had a d_n, we would add 1, but we don't have d_n)\n          Operation3: \n                  d0 = d0 + 1\n                  (and if we had a d_n, we would subtract 1)\n\n      But without a d_n, we are not tracking the last element. \n\n  Alternatively, we can consider the following known solution from a similar problem (CodeForces 1661C - Water the Trees):\n\n      In that problem, the operations are: \n          On even days: you can water one tree (add 1 to one tree)\n          On odd days: you can water two trees (add 1 to two trees)\n\n      But that is different.\n\n  After research, there is a known solution for the exact problem: \n      We can use a greedy pass. \n      Let's define:\n          Let x = [0] * (n+1)\n          x[0] = a[0]\n          for i in range(1, n):\n              x[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n          Then the answer is: \n              ans = 0\n              for i in range(1, n):\n                  if x[i] > 0:\n                      ans += x[i]\n                  else:\n                      ans -= x[i]   // because we add the absolute value\n\n              ans += max(0, a[0] - ans)   // ? \n\n      But this doesn't work for [7,6,3]: \n          x0 = 7\n          x1 = 6-7 = -1\n          x2 = 3-6 = -3\n          ans = 0 + abs(-1) + abs(-3) = 4, then ans += max(0, 7-4)=3 -> 7? but expected 13.\n\n  Another known solution: \n      We can do: \n          ans = 0\n          for i in range(n-1,0,-1):\n              ans += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])\n          ans += abs(a[0])\n\n      For [7,6,3]: \n          i=2: a[2]-a[1] = 3-6 = -3 -> abs=3\n          i=1: a[1]-a[0]=6-7=-1 -> abs=1\n          then ans = 3+1+abs(7)=3+1+7=11 -> not 13.\n\n  The sample says 13.\n\n  Insight from the sample: \n      They did 4 (prefix of length3) + 6 (prefix of length1) + 3 (suffix of length1) = 13.\n\n  How does that work on [7,6,3]? \n      Let p3 = 4 (prefix ending at index3, which covers indices0,1,2) -> subtract 4 from each of the three.\n      Then the array becomes [3,2,-1] -> but negative, so not allowed? \n\n  But the sample says they got [6,0,3] after the first step. \n\n  How can we get [6,0,3] from [7,6,3] by doing prefix operations? \n      If we do a prefix operation on length1: then we only subtract from the first element. \n      To get 6 from 7: we do 1 prefix operation on length1: then [6,6,3]\n      Then how to get [6,0,3]? \n          We would need to subtract 6 from the second element: but if we do a prefix operation on length2: then we subtract from the first and second. \n          If we do 6 times: [6-6, 6-6, 3] = [0,0,3] -> not [6,0,3].\n\n      Alternatively, if we do a suffix operation starting at index1 (the second tree) 6 times: \n          [7,6-6,3-6] = [7,0,-3] -> not [6,0,3].\n\n  This is very confusing.\n\n  Let me try to simulate the sample solution: \n      Step1: apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3: \n          This means we do 4 times: subtract 1 from the first, second, and third tree.\n          [7-4, 6-4, 3-4] = [3,2,-1] -> not [6,0,3].\n\n  The sample says: \"get an array 6, 0, 3\". \n\n  How about: \n      They applied the operation of type1 (prefix) on length3: 1 time -> [6,5,2]\n      then type1 on length3: 1 time -> [5,4,1]\n      then type1 on length3: 1 time -> [4,3,0]\n      then type1 on length3: 1 time -> [3,2,-1] \n      that's 4 times, and we have [3,2,-1] -> not [6,0,3].\n\n  I see the sample output is 13, and they break it as 4+6+3.\n\n  How about: \n      We do 4 times of type1 on the entire array (length3): \n          [7-4, 6-4, 3-4] = [3,2,-1] \n      Then they say: \n          \"apply the operation of decreasing 6 times on the prefix of length 1\"\n          -> [3-6, 2, -1] = [-3,2,-1]\n          \"and 3 times on the suffix of length 1\"\n          -> [-3,2-3, -1-3] = [-3,-1,-4]\n\n      That's not 0.\n\n  The sample says: \"In total, the number of actions will be 4 + 6 + 3 = 13\"\n\n  And then they say: \"It can be shown that it's impossible to perform less actions to get the required array, so the answer is 13.\"\n\n  So how do they get to 0? \n\n  Let me try a different approach: \n      We are allowed to do global increments. \n      Let z = the number of global increments. Then we need to remove a_i + z from each tree i.\n\n      We can do: \n          Let f(i) = a_i + z = the total removal needed at tree i.\n\n      The removal can be done by prefix and/or suffix operations.\n\n      For tree0: removal = f(0) = (prefix operations that cover tree0) = (p0 + p1 + ... + p_{n-1}) \n      For tree1: removal = f(1) = (prefix operations that cover tree0 and tree1) + (suffix operations that cover tree1) = (p0+...+p_{n-1}) + (q1+...+q_{n-1}) \n          wait, but tree1 is covered by every prefix operation (since they all cover tree0 and tree1) and by every suffix operation that start at index<=1.\n\n      This is complex.\n\n  Known solution from a known problem: \n      There is a problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1343/problem/D\n      But not exactly.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a solution from a known similar problem \"Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Zero\" by using a difference array and then the answer is the sum of the positive differences in the difference array of the target? \n\n  After reading a known solution for this exact problem (search for the problem in CodeForces: it is problem C in a contest? or problem B?) \n\n  Found: the problem is \"Leonard and the Forest\" or not.\n\n  There is a known solution: \n      tot = 0\n      a = [0] + a   # 1-indexed\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          tot += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])\n      print(tot - max(abs(a[1]-a[0]), abs(a[n]-a[n-1])) + ... ) \n\n  This is not matching.\n\n  Another known solution: \n      ans = 0\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          ans += max(0, a[i] - a[i+1])\n      ans += a[n-1]\n\n  For [2,2]: \n      i=0: max(0, 2-2)=0, then ans += a[1]=2 -> total=2. \n      For [7,6,3]: \n          i=0: max(0,7-6)=1\n          i=1: max(0,6-3)=3\n          then ans += a[2]=3 -> total=1+3+3=7 -> not 13.\n\n  The sample requires 13.\n\n  Let me try to do the operations for [7,6,3] manually to achieve 13? \n      The sample says: \n          Step1: 4 times type1 on prefix of length3: \n              [7,6,3] -> [7-4,6-4,3-4] = [3,2,-1] \n          Step2: 6 times type1 on prefix of length1: \n              [3-6,2,-1] = [-3,2,-1]\n          Step3: 3 times type2 on suffix of length1: \n              [-3,2-3,-1-3] = [-3,-1,-4]\n\n      That's not zero.\n\n  How about: \n      We want to achieve [0,0,0]. \n      We can do: \n          type3 (global increment) 4 times: then [7+4,6+4,3+4] = [11,10,7]\n          then type1 on prefix of length1: 11 times: [0,10,7]\n          then type1 on prefix of length2: 10 times: [0,0,7-10] = [0,0,-3] -> not zero.\n\n      type3 7 times: [14,13,10]\n          type1 on prefix of length1: 14 times: [0,13,10]\n          type1 on prefix of length2: 13 times: [0,0,10-13] = [0,0,-3] -> not zero.\n\n      type3 10 times: [17,16,13]\n          type1 on prefix of length1: 17 times: [0,16,13]\n          type1 on prefix of length2: 16 times: [0,0,13-16]=[0,0,-3] -> not zero.\n\n      type3 13 times: [20,19,16]\n          type1 on prefix of length1: 20 times: [0,19,16]\n          type1 on prefix of length2: 19 times: [0,0,16-19]=[0,0,-3] -> not zero.\n\n      This is not working.\n\n  How about using suffix operations as well: \n      type3: 0 times.\n      type1 on prefix of length3: 3 times: [4,3,0]\n      type1 on prefix of length2: 3 times: [4-3,3-3,0] = [1,0,0]\n      type1 on prefix of length1: 1 time: [0,0,0] -> total operations = 3+3+1 = 7.\n\n      But the sample says 13 is the minimum? \n\n  The sample says: \"It can be shown that it's impossible to perform less actions to get the required array, so the answer is 13.\"\n\n  So 7 is not achievable? \n\n  Let me check: \n      type1 on prefix of length3: 3 times: \n          [7-3,6-3,3-3] = [4,3,0]\n      type1 on prefix of length2: 3 times: \n          [4-3,3-3,0] = [1,0,0]\n      type1 on prefix of length1: 1 time: \n          [1-1,0,0] = [0,0,0]\n\n      So 3+3+1 = 7.\n\n  Why does the sample say 13? \n\n  I see the sample says: \n      \"In the second test case you can apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3\"\n\n  This suggests that the operations are not applied in the order I think. \n\n  The problem says: \n      Choose a position i and decrease the level of moisture of the trees 1..i by 1. \n      Choose a position i and decrease the level of moisture of the trees i..n by 1.\n      Increase the level of moisture of all trees by 1.\n\n  So the increase is separate. \n\n  Perhaps the sample solution for [7,6,3] is: \n      Step1: type1 on prefix of length3: 4 times -> [7-4,6-4,3-4] = [3,2,-1]\n      Step2: type1 on prefix of length1: 6 times -> [3-6,2,-1] = [-3,2,-1]\n      Step3: type2 on suffix of length1: 3 times -> [-3,2-3,-1-3] = [-3,-1,-4]\n      Then they do type3 (increase) 10 times: \n          [-3+10, -1+10, -4+10] = [7,9,6] -> not zero.\n\n  This is not working.\n\n  I see the sample output for the second test case is 13, and the sample input is \"3\\n7 6 3\", and the sample says the answer is 13.\n\n  There is a known solution in C++ for this problem (from a known contest):\n\n      #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n      using namespace std;\n      typedef long long ll;\n\n      int main() {\n          ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\n          cin.tie(0);\n\n          int t;\n          cin >> t;\n          while(t--) {\n              int n;\n              cin >> n;\n              vector<ll> a(n);\n              for (auto &x : a) cin >> x;\n              ll ans = 0;\n              for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) a[i] -= a[i-1];\n              for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) ans += abs(a[i]);\n              cout << ans + abs(a[0]) << '\\n';\n          }\n      }\n\n  But this gives for [7,6,3]: \n      a[1] = 6-7 = -1\n      a[2] = 3-6 = -3\n      then ans = abs(-1) + abs(-3) = 1+3 = 4, then + abs(7)=7 -> 11.\n\n  But expected 13.\n\n  Another known solution:\n\n      #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n      using namespace std;\n      typedef long long ll;\n\n      int main() {\n          int t;\n          cin >> t;\n          while (t--) {\n              int n;\n              cin >> n;\n              vector<ll> a(n);\n              for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                  cin >> a[i];\n              }\n              ll moves = 0;\n              ll current = a[0];\n              for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\n                  if (a[i] > current) {\n                      moves += a[i] - current;\n                      current = a[i];\n                  } else {\n                      moves += current - a[i];\n                  }\n              }\n              moves += abs(a[0]);\n              cout << moves << endl;\n          }\n      }\n\n  For [7,6,3]: \n      current = 7\n      i=1: a[1]=6<7 -> moves += 7-6=1, current=6\n      i=2: a[2]=3<6 -> moves += 6-3=3, then moves += abs(7)=7 -> total=1+3+7=11.\n\n  not 13.\n\n  I found the actual solution in a contest: \n      CodeFor problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/1698/problem/C\n\n      not matching.\n\n  After re-thinking: \n      We can consider the net effect of the operations on the difference array. \n      Let d_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i=1..n-1, and d0 = a0.\n      Operation1 (prefix ending at i): \n          This operation will: \n              decrease d0 by 1.\n              increase d_i by 1.\n      Operation2 (suffix starting at i):\n          increase d_{i} by 1.   # because it increases the difference between a_{i-1} and a_i? \n          Actually, if we do a suffix operation starting at i, it only affects from i onward, so it doesn change a_{i-1} and a_i: \n              a_{i-1} remains the same, a_i becomes a_i-1, so d_i = a_i - a_{i-1} becomes d_i - 1.\n          But wait, let's do an example: \n              [2,2]: \n                  d0 = 2, d1 = 0.\n              Do a suffix operation starting at index1 (0-indexed) -> then a0 remains 2, a1 becomes 1. \n                  then d0 = 2, d1 = 1-2 = -1.\n              So it changed d1 by -1.\n          Therefore, a suffix operation starting at i (0-indexed) will:\n              decrease d_i by 1.\n              and if there is a d_{i+1}?

\n\n  Given the complexity and the time, and that the problem is not trivial, and the provided code structure, I think the intended solution in the provided code is: \n      for val in range(len(list)-1):\n          diff = int(list2[val+1]) - int(list[val+1])   # a[val] - a[val+1]\n          if diff >= 0:\n              tot += diff\n          else:\n              # TODO: what to do for negative diff?\n              # and also update minv?\n\n      then the print: tot - minv + abs(minv) + int(list[-1])\n\n  For [7,6,3]: \n      diff0 = 1>=0 -> tot=1.\n      diff1 = 3>=0 -> tot=4.\n      then print: 4 - 7 + 7 + 3 = 7.\n\n  for [2,2]: 0+2=2.\n\n  for [1,2,1]: \n      diff0 = 1-2 = -1 <0 -> \n          what to do? \n      diff1 = 2-1=1>=0 -> tot=1.\n      then print: 1 - 1 + 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n  for [0,0,0]: \n      diff0=0, diff1=0 -> tot=0.\n      minv=0.\n      then print: 0 -0+0+0=0.\n\n  for [5]: \n      n=1, the loop doesn't run.\n      then print: 0 -5+5+5 = 5.\n\n  But for [5] how to achieve 0? \n      We can do: \n          type1 on prefix of length1: 5 times -> [0] -> 5 operations.\n      so 5 is correct.\n\n  for [7,6,3] we are getting 7, but expected 13.\n\n  unless the sample [7,6,3] is not the only sample.\n\n  The problem says: \n      \"In the second test case you can apply the operation of decreasing 4 times on the prefix of length 3 and get an array 6, 0, 3\"\n\n  This suggests that the array becomes [6,0,3] (which is not sorted) \n\n  How can that be? \n      If we do a prefix operation on length3: it should decrease the first, second, and third.\n      [7-4, 6-4, 3-4] = [3,2,-1] -> not [6,0,3].\n\n  unless the operation is defined differently. \n\n  The problem says: \n      \"Choose a position i and decrease the level of moisture of the trees 1, 2, ..., i by 1\"\n      \"Choose a position i and decrease the level of moisture of the trees i, i+1, ..., n by 1\"\n\n  So for a prefix operation on length3: it does decrease the first 3 trees.\n\n  for a suffix operation starting at index1 (0-indexed) would decrease the trees from index1 to the end, i.e., tree1 and tree2.\n\n  So to get [6,0,3] from [7,6,3]: \n      We want to decrease the first tree by 1 and the second tree by 6, and leave the third tree unchanged? \n      How: \n          type1 on prefix of length1: 1 time -> [6,6,3]\n          type2 on suffix of length2: 6 times -> [6,6-6,3-6] = [6,0,-3] -> not [6,0,3].\n\n      type3 (global increment) on the array: then [6,0,3] becomes [7,1,4] -> not helpful.\n\n  I think there is a mistake in the sample explanation. \n\n  Given the provided code structure and the samples [2,2] and [5] work, and [1,2,1] works, and [0,0,0] works, and the only sample that doesn't work is [7,6,3] which is not working with the sample explanation either, I think the intended solution for the TODO is simply:\n\n      if diff >= 0:\n          tot += diff\n\n  and then the print: tot - minv + abs(minv) + int(list[-1])\n\n  which for minv>=0 is: tot + int(list[-1])\n\n  and for [7,6,3]: minv=7>=0, so we do tot + 3, and tot=4, so 7.\n\n  but the sample says 13.\n\n  Unless the sample input for the second test case is not [7,6,3]? \n\n  The problem says: \n      \"The second line of each test case contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n\n      and the sample input: \n          \"3\n          7 6 3\"\n\n  So it is [7,6,3].\n\n  There is a possibility that the provided code in program2.py is not for this problem, but the problem statement says it is.\n\n  Given the time, and that the only TODO is in the if diff>=0 block, and the sample [2,2] works with TODO being empty ( because diff=0, so we do nothing and tot=0, then 0+2=2) and [5] works (0+5=5), and [1,2,1] works (0+1=1 for the second diff, then 1+1=2), and [0,0,0] works, we will output for the TODO in program2.py: \n\n      tot += diff\n\n  and hope that the intended solution is this.\n\n  For the sample [7,6,3]: \n      diff0 = 7-6=1 -> tot=1\n      diff1 = 6-3=3 -> tot=4\n      then output: 4 - 7 + 7 + 3 = 4+3 = 7.\n\n  and the problem sample says 13, so it is not.\n\n  How about: \n      if diff>=0:\n          tot += diff\n      else:\n          tot += -diff * something \n\n  but in the else, we are not entering.\n\n  Only the positive differences are added.\n\n  Another possibility: the TODO is: \n      if diff>=0:\n          tot += diff\n      minv = min(minv, int(list[val+1]))\n\n  then for [7,6,3]: \n      val0: diff=1 -> tot=1, minv=min(7,6)=6\n      val1: diff=3 -> tot=4, minv=min(6,3)=3\n      then print: 4 - 3 + 3 + 3 = 7.\n\n  still 7.\n\n  How about: \n      if diff>=0:\n          tot += diff\n      minv = min(minv, int(list2[val+1]))   # list2[val+1] is the current element at index val in the array?
