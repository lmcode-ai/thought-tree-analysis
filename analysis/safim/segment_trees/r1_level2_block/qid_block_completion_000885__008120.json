But then why in the provided code they do: \n                      if p: \n                         r += i - p\n                         p = 0\n                      else:\n                         p = i",

'c': 'cc' -> present -> count +=1 -> count=7.\n                    others: not present. then d['cd']=1. Total count=7. But expected is 5. Why?",

For each string s = [a, b]:\n   - It considers changing the first character to any other letter c (from 'a' to 'k') and checks if the string c + s[1] has been seen before. If so, it should add the count of such strings to the total.\n   - Similarly, it considers changing the second character to any other letter c and checks the string s[0] + c.\n\n However, note that the current code has a TODO in the first part (for the first character change). We need to complete that.\n\n Also note: the current code for the second part is already present: \n        if c != s[1]:\n            if d[s[0] + c] > 0:\n                count += d[s[0] + c]\n\n We need to do the same for the first part: \n        if c != s[0]:\n            if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n But wait: the current code does not have the line to add to count in the first part. We must add that.\n\n However, note that the problem says: the total n over test cases is at most 10^5, so we can do this.\n\n But there is a catch: the same string might be counted multiple times? Actually, we are iterating over each string and then over 10 other letters (since there are 11 letters, we skip one). This is acceptable.\n\n However, note that the current code does not have the addition for the first part. We must add:\n\n        if c != s[0]:\n            if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n So the missing line in the first TODO is: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n\n But note: the current code for the second part is already written. The first part is missing the addition.\n\n However, let me check the example: \n   First test case: n=6, strings: [\"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\", \"cd\"]\n   We expect 5 pairs.\n\n   How does the algorithm work?\n   We start with an empty dictionary.\n\n   For the first string \"ab\":\n      We look for strings that are like \"?b\" where ? is not 'a'. There are 10 possibilities. But none in the dictionary so far -> 0.\n      Then look for strings that are like \"a?\" where ? is not 'b'. Again 10 possibilities -> 0.\n      Then we add \"ab\": d[\"ab\"]=1.\n\n   For the second string \"cb\":\n      Look for \"?b\" (with ? != 'c'): we have \"ab\" (which is in the dictionary) -> count += d[\"ab\"] = 1.\n      Then look for \"c?\" (with ? != 'b'): we have none -> 0.\n      Then add \"cb\": now d[\"cb\"]=1.\n\n   For the third string \"db\":\n      Look for \"?b\" (with ? != 'd'): we have \"ab\" and \"cb\" -> count += d[\"ab\"] (which is 1) and d[\"cb\"] (which is 1) -> count becomes 1+1 = 2? \n        But note: the code does a loop over ak and for each c that is not the first char, it checks d[c+s[1]]. So for \"db\", we check for \"ab\", \"bb\", ... (but skip \"db\") and we find \"ab\" and \"cb\". So we add 1 (for \"ab\") and 1 (for \"cb\") -> total 2 added? \n        Actually, the code does:\n            for c in ak:\n                if c != s[0]:\n                    if d[c+s[1]]>0:\n                        count += d[c+s[1]]\n        So for \"db\", we add the counts of all strings that have the form [c, 'b'] with c not 'd'. That includes \"ab\" and \"cb\", so 1+1=2.\n\n      Then for the second part: for c in ak (if c != 'b'), we look for \"d?\" -> none? because we haven't added any \"d?\" except we are about to add \"db\". So 0.\n\n      Then we add \"db\": d[\"db\"]=1.\n\n      Now count is 1 (from the second string) + 2 (from the third) = 3.\n\n   For the fourth string \"aa\":\n      First part: look for \"?a\" (with ? != 'a') -> we have none? because so far we have \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\" -> no string ending with 'a'. So 0.\n      Second part: look for \"a?\" (with ? != 'a') -> we have \"ab\" -> count += d[\"ab\"] = 1 -> count becomes 4.\n      Then add \"aa\": d[\"aa\"]=1.\n\n   For the fifth string \"cc\":\n      First part: look for \"?c\" (with ? != 'c') -> we have none? because we have \"aa\", \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\" -> no string ending with 'c'. So 0.\n      Second part: look for \"c?\" (with ? != 'c') -> we have \"cb\" -> count += d[\"cb\"] = 1 -> count becomes 5.\n      Then add \"cc\": d[\"cc\"]=1.\n\n   For the sixth string \"cd\":\n      First part: look for \"?d\" (with ? != 'c') -> we have none? because we have no string ending with 'd'. So 0.\n      Second part: look for \"c?\" (with ? != 'd') -> we have \"cb\" and \"cc\" -> so we add d[\"cb\"] (1) and d[\"cc\"] (1) -> 2 -> count becomes 7.\n\n   But the expected answer is 5. So what went wrong?\n\n   The problem: we are counting pairs that differ in exactly one position. However, note that the pair (\"cb\", \"cd\") differs in the second position? -> that's one difference -> valid. Similarly, (\"db\", \"cd\")? -> they differ in both positions? -> not valid. \n\n   But wait: \n        \"cb\" and \"cd\": first char same 'c', second char 'b' vs 'd' -> one difference -> valid.\n        \"cc\" and \"cd\": same first char, second char 'c' vs 'd' -> one difference -> valid.\n\n   So we have two more pairs: (cb,cd) and (cc,cd). But the example says the answer is 5? \n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\n   So that's 5. But we also have:\n        (\"cb\", \"cd\") -> valid? \n        (\"cc\", \"cd\") -> valid?\n        and also (\"db\", \"cd\") -> two differences -> invalid.\n\n   Why are (\"cb\",\"cd\") and (\"cc\",\"cd\") not in the example? \n\n   Let me list the strings: \n        ab, cb, db, aa, cc, cd.\n\n   The pairs:\n        ab: \n            with cb: one difference (first char: a vs c) -> valid.\n            with db: one difference (first char: a vs d) -> valid.\n            with aa: one difference (second char: b vs a) -> valid.\n            with cc: two differences -> invalid.\n            with cd: two differences -> invalid.\n        cb:\n            with db: one difference (first char: c vs d) -> valid.\n            with aa: two differences -> invalid.\n            with cc: one difference (second char: b vs c) -> valid.\n            with cd: one difference (second char: b vs d) -> valid? -> but wait, the example says (\"cb\", \"cc\") is valid, so why not (\"cb\",\"cd\")? \n        db:\n            with aa: two differences -> invalid.\n            with cc: two differences -> invalid.\n            with cd: two differences -> invalid? (d vs c, b vs d -> two)\n        aa:\n            with cc: two differences -> invalid.\n            with cd: two differences -> invalid.\n        cc:\n            with cd: one difference (second char: c vs d) -> valid.\n\n   So we have:\n        ab: 3\n        cb: 3 (with ab, db, cc) -> but wait, the example says only (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\",\"cc\") -> that's 2 for cb? \n        Actually, the example lists 5 pairs: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\n        But we found:\n            ab: (ab,cb), (ab,db), (ab,aa) -> 3\n            cb: (cb,db), (cb,cc) -> 2\n            db: none\n            aa: none\n            cc: (cc,cd) -> 1\n            cd: none\n\n        That totals 6? \n\n   However, the example says 5. And the example does not include (cb,cd) and (cc,cd) because the example list only the first five? \n\n   But wait, the example says: \n        For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\n   So (cc,cd) is missing? \n\n   Let me check the example again: the strings are: \n        ab, cb, db, aa, cc, cd\n\n   The example does not list (cc,cd) because the example list might be incomplete? \n\n   But the example says the answer is 5. So why did we get 5 in the example? \n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        The first test case: 6 strings -> answer=5.\n\n   So our algorithm counted 7? \n\n   What's the issue? \n\n   The problem: we are counting pairs that are symmetric? But note that we are iterating and for each string we are adding the counts of the strings that we have seen so far. \n\n   However, the example we did step by step got 7? \n\n   Let me recount the step-by-step:\n\n        Start: count=0, d={}\n        \"ab\": \n            first part: for c in ak (c != 'a'): check d[c+'b'] -> nothing -> 0.\n            second part: for c in ak (c != 'b'): check d['a'+c] -> nothing -> 0.\n            then d['ab']=1 -> d = {'ab':1}\n\n        \"cb\":\n            first part: for c in ak (c != 'c'): check d[c+'b'] -> when c='a', we have d['ab']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=1.\n            second part: for c in ak (c != 'b'): check d['c'+c] -> nothing -> 0.\n            then d['cb']=1 -> d = {'ab':1, 'cb':1}\n\n        \"db\":\n            first part: for c in ak (c != 'd'): check d[c+'b'] -> \n                c='a': d['ab']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=2.\n                c='b': d['bb'] -> not present -> skip.\n                c='c': d['cb']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=3.\n                ... others are 0.\n            second part: for c in ak (c != 'b'): check d['d'+c] -> nothing -> 0.\n            then d['db']=1 -> d = {'ab':1, 'cb':1, 'db':1}\n\n        \"aa\":\n            first part: for c in ak (c != 'a'): check d[c+'a'] -> nothing -> 0.\n            second part: for c in ak (c != 'a'): check d['a'+c] -> \n                c='b': d['ab']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=4.\n                ... others: not present.\n            then d['aa']=1 -> d = {... , 'aa':1}\n\n        \"cc\":\n            first part: for c in ak (c != 'c'): check d[c+'c'] -> nothing -> 0.\n            second part: for c in ak (c != 'c'): check d['c'+c] -> \n                c='b': d['cb']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=5.\n                ... others: not present.\n            then d['cc']=1\n\n        \"cd\":\n            first part: for c in ak (c != 'c'): check d[c+'d'] -> nothing -> 0.\n            second part: for c in ak (c != 'd'): check d['c'+c] -> \n                c='a': d['ca'] -> not present.\n                c='b': d['cb']=1 -> count +=1 -> count=6.\n                c='c': skip? because c != 'd' -> but c='c' is allowed? but condition: c != s[1] -> s[1] is 'd', so c can be 'c'? no: condition is if c != s[1] -> so when c='c', we skip? \n                Actually, we skip c='c'. Then we have:\n                    c in ak without 'd': so we have 10 letters. We skip 'd'. But note: we also skip when c='d'? but condition is c != s[1] and s[1] is 'd'. So we skip only when c='d'. \n                So we check for c in ['a','b','c','e',...'k'] without 'd'. \n                We have:\n                    'a': 'ca' -> not present.\n                    'b': 'cb' -> present -> count +=1 -> count=6.\n                    'c': 'cc' -> present -> count +=1 -> count=7.\n                    others: not present.\n            then d['cd']=1.\n\n        Total count=7.\n\n   But expected is 5.\n\n   Why? \n\n   The problem: we are counting pairs that are not valid? \n\n   Let me list the pairs we counted:\n\n        \"cb\" and \"ab\": valid -> 1\n        \"db\" and \"ab\": valid -> 1\n        \"db\" and \"cb\": valid -> 1\n        \"aa\" and \"ab\": valid -> 1\n        \"cc\" and \"cb\": valid -> 1\n        \"cd\" and \"cb\": valid -> 1 (because first char same, second char: 'b' vs 'd' -> one difference)\n        \"cd\" and \"cc\": valid -> 1 (because first char same, second char: 'c' vs 'd' -> one difference)\n\n   That's 7.\n\n   But the example says only 5? \n\n   The example says: \n        (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\"), (\"cb\", \"cc\")\n\n   Why are (\"cd\", \"cb\") and (\"cd\", \"cc\") not in the example? \n\n   The example does not list any pair that includes \"cd\". \n\n   However, the example says: \n        Then follows 6 lines: \n            ab\n            cb\n            db\n            aa\n            cc\n            cd\n\n   So the pairs that include \"cd\" should be considered? \n\n   But the example says the answer is 5. \n\n   I see the issue: the example note says: \n        For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\n   So they list 5. \n\n   Why are we counting 7? \n\n   The problem: the example note might be incomplete? \n\n   But the problem statement says: \n        The first test case: 6 strings -> answer=5.\n\n   So our algorithm is overcounting? \n\n   Let me check the pairs that we counted:\n\n        (ab, cb): valid -> 1\n        (ab, db): valid -> 1\n        (ab, aa): valid -> 1\n        (cb, db): valid -> 1\n        (cb, cc): valid -> 1\n        (cb, cd): valid -> 1\n        (cc, cd): valid -> 1\n\n   That's 7.\n\n   But the example says 5. \n\n   I see: the example does not have (cb,cd) and (cc,cd) because the example note was written before the last string? \n\n   Actually, the example note says: \n        Then follows 6 lines: \n            ab\n            cb\n            db\n            aa\n            cc\n            cd\n\n   And then the pairs are listed as 5. \n\n   So the correct answer for the first test case is 5? \n\n   But wait, the example note says: \n        For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n            (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\n   This does not include (cb,cd) and (cc,cd). \n\n   Why? \n\n   Let me check the string \"cd\": \n        It is the last string. \n\n   The pairs that involve \"cd\" are:\n        (ab, cd): two differences -> invalid.\n        (cb, cd): one difference (second char: 'b' vs 'd') -> valid.\n        (db, cd): two differences -> invalid.\n        (aa, cd): two differences -> invalid.\n        (cc, cd): one difference (second char: 'c' vs 'd') -> valid.\n\n   So we have two more: (cb,cd) and (cc,cd). \n\n   That totals 5+2=7? \n\n   But the example says the answer is 5. \n\n   I see the problem: the example note says: \n        Then follows 6 lines: \n            ab\n            cb\n            db\n            aa\n            cc\n            cd\n\n   But the example note says: \n        For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n            ... and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\n   And then it says: \n        For the second test case ... \n        For the third test case ...\n\n   So the first test case has 5 pairs? \n\n   I must have miscounted the strings. \n\n   The example note says: \n        The first test case: \n            n=6\n            strings: ab, cb, db, aa, cc, cd\n\n        The pairs: \n            (ab, cb): one difference -> valid.\n            (ab, db): one difference -> valid.\n            (ab, aa): one difference -> valid.\n            (cb, db): one difference -> valid.\n            (cb, cc): one difference -> valid.\n\n        That's 5.\n\n        Why are (cb,cd) and (cc,cd) not included? \n\n        Because the example note says: \"the pairs that differ in exactly one position are\" and then lists 5. \n\n        But the problem says: the answer for the first test case is 5.\n\n        So our algorithm must output 5 for the first test case.\n\n        How can we fix the algorithm? \n\n        The issue: we are counting (cb,cd) and (cc,cd) as well? \n\n        Why? because when we process \"cd\", we look for strings that are:\n            [x, 'd'] with x != 'c' -> none? \n            and ['c', x] with x != 'd' -> we have \"cb\" and \"cc\". \n\n        So we add the counts of \"cb\" and \"cc\", which are 1 each -> 2.\n\n        But the example says that the pair (cb,cd) is valid? and (cc,cd) is valid? \n\n        Then why is the answer 5? \n\n        I see: the example note might be incomplete? \n\n        Actually, the problem statement says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\"\n\n        and then it says: \n            \"For the second test case ... \"\n\n        So the first test case has 5 pairs? \n\n        But then why do we have 7? \n\n        I think the example note is incomplete. The problem statement says: \n            \"the first test case ... the number of pairs ... is 5\"\n\n        But our algorithm counts 7? \n\n        Let me check the example test case with the sample answer 5: \n            Input: \n                1\n                6\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                cd\n\n            Expected output: 5.\n\n        So our algorithm must output 5, not 7.\n\n        What is the flaw in the algorithm? \n\n        The algorithm counts:\n            For each string s, it counts:\n                For each possible change in the first character (to c, which is not s[0]), it counts the number of strings of the form c+s[1] that have been seen so far.\n                For each possible change in the second character (to c, which is not s[1]), it counts the number of strings of the form s[0]+c that have been seen so far.\n\n        But note: the pair (s, t) is counted when we process the later string? \n\n        For example, the pair (ab, cb) is counted when we process \"cb\" (because then we see \"ab\" in the dictionary). \n\n        The pair (ab, aa) is counted when we process \"aa\" (because then we see \"ab\" in the dictionary for the second part: we look for \"a?\" and we see \"ab\").\n\n        The pair (cb, cd) is counted when we process \"cd\": we look for \"c?\" and we see \"cb\" and \"cc\". \n\n        But the problem: the pair (cb, cd) is indeed valid? \n\n        Why then the expected answer is 5? \n\n        I see: the problem statement says: \n            \"the first test case ... the number of pairs ... is 5\"\n\n        But the sample note lists 5 pairs and then we found two more? \n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        After re-examining the problem statement: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\\\"ab\\\", \\\"cb\\\"), (\\\"ab\\\", \\\"db\\\"), (\\\"ab\\\", \\\"aa\\\"), (\\\"cb\\\", \\\"db\\\") and (\\\"cb\\\", \\\"cc\\\").\"\n\n        So they list 5. \n\n        And the sample input has 6 strings: \n            ab, cb, db, aa, cc, cd\n\n        Therefore, the pair (cb,cd) and (cc,cd) should not be counted? \n\n        But they do differ in exactly one position? \n\n        Unless the problem has a constraint that I missed? \n\n        The problem says: \"differ in exactly one position\". \n\n        For (cb, cd): \n            first character: 'c' vs 'c' -> same.\n            second character: 'b' vs 'd' -> different.\n            -> one difference -> valid.\n\n        Similarly, (cc,cd): \n            first character: 'c' vs 'c' -> same.\n            second character: 'c' vs 'd' -> different.\n            -> one difference -> valid.\n\n        So they are valid.\n\n        Then the example note is incomplete? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"For the first test case ... the number of pairs ... is 5\"\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        I see the problem: the example note says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... and (\\\"cb\\\", \\\"cc\\\").\"\n\n        and then it says: \n            \"For the second test case ... \"\n\n        So it only lists 5 pairs for the first test case? \n\n        But the first test case has 6 strings and the total pairs should be 15? and we are counting only the ones that differ in exactly one position.\n\n        How many are there? \n            ab: \n                with cb: 1\n                with db: 1\n                with aa: 1\n                with cc: 0 (two differences)\n                with cd: 0 (two differences)\n            cb:\n                with db: 1\n                with aa: 0\n                with cc: 1\n                with cd: 1\n            db:\n                with aa: 0\n                with cc: 0\n                with cd: 0\n            aa:\n                with cc: 0\n                with cd: 0\n            cc:\n                with cd: 1\n\n        Total: 3 (from ab) + 3 (from cb) + 0 (db) + 0 (aa) + 1 (cc) = 7.\n\n        So the example note is incomplete: it missed (cb,cd) and (cc,cd). \n\n        But the problem statement says the answer for the first test case is 5? \n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        I see: the problem statement says: \n            \"the first test case ... the number of pairs ... is 5\"\n\n        and then in the note it lists 5 pairs, but it does not say \"only\", so maybe it is just an example? \n\n        However, the sample input and output must be consistent.\n\n        After checking the sample test case in the problem statement: \n            Input: \n                5\n                6\n                ab\n                cb\n                db\n                aa\n                cc\n                cd\n                2\n                aa\n                aa\n                6\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                aa\n                8\n                aa\n                ab\n                ac\n                ad\n                ba\n                ca\n                da\n                bb\n            ... and more.\n\n        The expected output for the first test case is 5? \n\n        But we calculated 7.\n\n        I see the issue: the problem statement says: \n            \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\"\n\n        But the sample input for the first test case has n=6, and then there are 4 more test cases? \n\n        The sample input has 5 test cases? \n\n        The first line is t=5.\n\n        Then the first test case: n=6, then 6 strings.\n\n        Then the second test case: n=2, then 2 strings: \"aa\", \"aa\".\n\n        Then the third: n=6, then 6 strings: all \"aa\".\n\n        Then the fourth: n=8, then 8 strings.\n\n        Then the fifth: ... \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... \"\n\n        and then it lists 5 pairs.\n\n        So the first test case output is 5.\n\n        How can that be? \n\n        I see: the sample input for the first test case might be different? \n\n        The problem statement says: \n            \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1\u2264t\u2264100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\"\n\n        Then the sample input: \n            5\n            6\n            ab\n            cb\n            db\n            aa\n            cc\n            cd\n            2\n            aa\n            aa\n            ... \n\n        But then the first test case has 6 strings: \n            ab, cb, db, aa, cc, cd\n\n        And the expected answer is 5.\n\n        But we counted 7 valid pairs.\n\n        This is a mystery.\n\n        After rechecking the valid pairs for the first test case:\n\n            ab: \n                with cb: one difference -> valid.\n                with db: one difference -> valid.\n                with aa: one difference -> valid.\n                with cc: two differences -> invalid.\n                with cd: two differences -> invalid.\n            cb:\n                with db: one difference -> valid.\n                with aa: two differences -> invalid.\n                with cc: one difference -> valid.\n                with cd: one difference -> valid.\n            db:\n                with aa: two differences -> invalid.\n                with cc: two differences -> invalid.\n                with cd: two differences -> invalid.\n            aa:\n                with cc: two differences -> invalid.\n                with cd: two differences -> invalid.\n            cc:\n                with cd: one difference -> valid.\n\n            So the valid pairs: \n                (ab, cb), (ab, db), (ab, aa), (cb, db), (cb, cc), (cb, cd), (cc, cd) -> 7.\n\n        But the problem says the answer is 5.\n\n        I see the problem: the example note says: \n            \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: (\\\"ab\\\", \\\"cb\\\"), (\\\"ab\\\", \\\"db\\\"), (\\\"ab\\\", \\\"aa\\\"), (\\\"cb\\\", \\\"db\\\") and (\\\"cb\\\", \\\"cc\\\").\"\n\n        This lists 5 pairs. It does not include (cb, cd) and (cc, cd). \n\n        Why? \n\n        Because the string \"cd\" is not present in the first test case? \n\n        But the input has 6 strings, and the sixth string is \"cd\".\n\n        Unless the example note is for a different first test case? \n\n        The problem statement says: \n            \"For the first test case\"\n\n        and then the input for the first test case is as given.\n\n        I see: the example note might be for the sample input that they provided in the note, which is different from the sample input in the test case? \n\n        Let me read the problem statement carefully: \n            \"The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1\u2264t\u2264100) \u2014 the number of test cases.

It is just an example to illustrate.\n\n        Therefore, the example test case in the note has input: \n            t=1\n            n=6\n            strings: ab, cb, db, aa, cc, cd\n\n        and the expected output is 5.\n\n        But we counted 7.\n\n        However, in the sample input of the problem (which has 5 test cases), the sixth test case (which is the sixth in the list) has strings: \n            ab, cb, db, aa, cc, ef   [note: ef, not cd]\n\n        and the answer is 5.\n\n        So if we change the last string from \"cd\" to \"ef\", then the valid pairs are only the ones that the example note lists: 5.\n\n        Therefore, the example note has a typo? it should be \"ef\", not \"cd\".\n\n        Or the example note is for a different test case.\n\n        Given the confusion, we trust the algorithm: \n            We count for each string s, the number of strings that have been seen that can form a pair with s by changing exactly one character.\n\n        This should be correct.\n\n        But why for the test case with strings: \n            ab, cb, db, aa, cc, ef\n\n        we get 5? \n\n        Let's simulate:\n\n            d = {}\n            \"ab\": \n                first part: for c in ak (c!='a'): check d[c+'b'] -> 0.\n                second part: for c in ak (c!='b'): check d['a'+c] -> 0.\n                d['ab']=1.\n\n            \"cb\":\n                first part: c in ak (c!='c'): check d[c+'b'] -> c='a': d['ab']=1 -> count=1.\n                second part: c in ak (c!='b'): check d['c'+c] -> 0.\n                d['cb']=1.\n\n            \"db\":\n                first part: c in ak (c!='d'): check d[c+'b'] -> c='a': d['ab']=1 -> count=2; c='c': d['cb']=1 -> count=3.\n                second part: 0.\n                d['db']=1.\n\n            \"aa\":\n                first part: c in ak (c!='a'): check d[c+'a'] -> 0.\n                second part: c in ak (c!='a'): check d['a'+c] -> c='b': d['ab']=1 -> count=4.\n                d['aa']=1.\n\n            \"cc\":\n                first part: c in ak (c!='c'): check d[c+'c'] -> 0.\n                second part: c in ak (c!='c'): check d['c'+c] -> c='b': d['cb']=1 -> count=5.\n                d['cc']=1.\n\n            \"ef\":\n                first part: c in ak (c!='e'): check d[c+'f'] -> 0.\n                second part: c in ak (c!='f'): check d['e'+c] -> 0.\n                d['ef']=1.\n\n            count=5.\n\n        So the algorithm works for the sample that has \"ef\", but if we have \"cd\", then we get 7.\n\n        Therefore, the TODO in program1.py is to add the line: \n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        in the first part.\n\n        And the example in the problem statement's note has a typo: the last string should be \"ef\", not \"cd\".\n\n        So we complete program1.py by adding that line.\n\n        The missing line in program1.py is: \n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        But note: the code already has the second part. We only need to complete the first part.\n\n        So for program1.py, the missing code is just one line: \n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        However, the TODO is inside a loop and an if condition. We must be careful.\n\n        The current code for the first part:\n\n            for c in ak:\n                if c != s[0]:\n                    if d[c + s[1]] > 0:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with: \n                        count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        But note: the condition `if d[c + s[1]] > 0` is redundant because if it is 0, then adding 0 does nothing. We can simply do:\n\n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        without the condition? \n\n        However, the condition is there, so we can keep it and then add.\n\n        Alternatively, we can remove the condition and always add, but the condition is there. We'll follow the existing style.\n\n        So the completion for program1.py is: \n            count += d[c + s[1]]\n\n        But note: the existing code for the second part does have the condition and then adds. So we do the same.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is the line: `count += d[c + s[1]]` in the first part.\n\n        Now, for program2.py:\n\n        The description: \n            Tokitsukaze has a binary string s of length n (even). We want to make it good by minimum operations.\n            Good: when we split into contiguous subsegments of constant bits, each subsegment has even length.\n\n        The code provided:\n\n            import re\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                i=p=r=0\n                for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n                    i+=1\n                    if len(t)&1:\n                        if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n                        else:# TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n        We are guaranteed that the total length of all strings over test cases is at most 200000.\n\n        The idea: \n            We split the string into contiguous segments of the same character.\n\n            For example, \"1110011000\" -> ['111', '00', '11', '000'].\n\n            We want each segment to have even length. \n\n            Operation: we can flip any bit.\n\n            We are to find the minimum number of flips.\n\n        How to solve?\n\n        Note: we can merge adjacent segments by flipping some bits. \n\n        Observation: \n          - A segment of even length is already good.\n          - A segment of odd length is bad.\n\n        We can only change one bit at a time. Changing a bit at the boundary between two segments can merge two segments? \n\n        But note: if we flip a bit in the middle of a segment, we break it into two segments.\n\n        However, the goal is to have every contiguous segment of constant bits to be of even length.\n\n        Alternate approach: \n          We note that the entire string has even length. We can consider the following:\n\n          Let the segments be: [s1, s2, s3, ...], with lengths L1, L2, L3, ... \n\n          We are allowed to flip any bit. Flipping a bit that is at the boundary of two segments (say between s_i and s_{i+1}) will merge them? \n          But if we flip a bit in the middle of a segment, we break it.\n\n        However, we are allowed to do any flips. We are not restricted to boundaries.\n\n        We want the minimum number of flips.\n\n        Insight: \n          We can consider the parity of the segments. \n\n          Note: if we have a segment of odd length, we can fix it by either:\n            - Extending it to the next segment by flipping one bit at the boundary? but then the next segment might become odd? \n\n          Alternatively, we can note that two consecutive segments of the same character can be merged, but they are separated by at least one bit of the other.\n\n        Another known solution for this problem (from known problems like this, e.g. Codeforces problems):\n\n          We can use dynamic programming or greedy.\n\n        However, note the constraints: total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n        Known solution for \"Tokitsukaze and Good 01-String (easy version)\":\n\n          We can consider that the final string must have runs of even lengths. Therefore, the entire string can be partitioned into blocks of 2. And in each block, the two characters must be the same.\n\n          But wait: is that true? \n\n          Example: \"110000\" -> \n              It is divided into \"11\" and \"0000\", which are even. \n              But if we have \"1100\", we can also have one segment \"1100\" if it is all the same? no, because it has two zeros. \n\n          Actually, the segmentation is by constant bits. So \"1100\" is two segments: \"11\" and \"00\".\n\n          So the condition is that every maximal run has even length.\n\n          How to fix a run of odd length? \n\n          We can break a run of length L (odd) into:\n              [even part] and [1] \n          but then the [1] is odd and not even. \n\n          Or we can break it into two runs: \n              [even part] and [1] and then the next run might be merged with the [1] if we flip the next run's first bit? \n\n          Alternatively, we can note that adjacent runs are of different characters. \n\n          We can consider the runs in pairs? \n\n          Let the runs be: [a1, b1, a2, b2, ...] where a1 is a run of 0's or 1's, then b1 is the opposite, then a2, then b2, etc.\n\n          But note: the runs alternate.\n\n          We can fix the runs by flipping some bits at the boundaries.\n\n          However, the known solution for the easy version: \n\n            We can change some bits to make the entire string grouped in blocks of two. And then we require that each block has two identical bits.\n\n            Why is that sufficient? \n              Because then the runs will be of even length (each run is composed of consecutive blocks of the same character).\n\n            But is it necessary? \n              Yes, because if we have a run of even length, we can split it into blocks of two.\n\n            Therefore, the problem reduces to: \n                We want to assign to each block of two (i.e., positions 0 and 1, 2 and 3, ...) the same bit.\n\n            And the cost is the number of positions we flip.\n\n            However, wait: \n                Example: \"110000\" -> \n                    Block0: \"11\" -> no change.\n                    Block1: \"00\" -> no change.\n                    Block2: \"00\" -> no change.\n                -> cost=0.\n\n                Example: \"1110011000\" (which is not good) -> \n                    We can break into blocks: \n                        [0:1] \"11\" -> good.\n                        [2:3] \"10\" -> not good. We can change to \"11\" (then the next block becomes \"00\", but then the run of 1's becomes 4, which is even) or to \"00\" (then the run of 1's becomes 2, and then we have a run of 0's of length 1? no, because then we break the next run) -> not so clear.\n\n            But note: if we force each block of two to be the same, then the entire string will be partitioned into runs that are multiples of 2. So it will be good.\n\n            And the minimum number of operations to make the string such that every two consecutive characters (at positions 2i and 2i+1) are the same is: \n                For each block i (from 0 to n/2-1), we consider the two characters at positions 2i and 2i+1.\n                We can make the block \"00\" or \"11\". \n                The cost for block i: \n                    if the block is \"00\", then cost=0 for \"00\", cost=2 for \"11\".\n                    if the block is \"01\", then cost=1 for either \"00\" or \"11\".\n                    if the block is \"11\", then cost=0 for \"11\", cost=2 for \"00\".\n\n            But wait, we have an additional constraint: adjacent blocks of the same character will be merged. However, the problem does not require that the entire string is partitioned in a particular way. It only requires that the runs are even. \n\n            And if we make every block of two the same, then the runs will be even. \n\n            However, is this the minimum? \n\n            Example: \"1100\" -> already good, cost=0.\n\n            Example: \"10\" (one block): \n                We can change to \"00\" (cost=1) or to \"11\" (cost=1). \n\n            But then the runs: \n                If we change to \"00\", then we have one run of \"00\" (length=2) -> good.\n                If we change to \"11\", then we have one run of \"11\" (length=2) -> good.\n\n            Example: \"111000\": \n                We break into blocks: \n                    block0: \"11\" -> good.\n                    block1: \"10\" -> we change to \"11\" (cost=1) -> then the string becomes \"1111 00\" -> but wait, the last block is \"00\", so we have two runs: \"1111\" and \"00\", both even -> good.\n                Alternatively, change block1 to \"00\" (cost=1) -> then the string becomes \"1100 00\" -> runs: \"11\", \"0000\" -> both even -> good.\n\n            But note: we could also do:\n                Change the third character to '0': then we have \"110000\", which is two runs: \"11\" and \"0000\" -> cost=1.\n\n            So the cost is 1.\n\n            How does the block method work? \n                We have two blocks: \n                    block0: \"11\" -> no cost.\n                    block1: \"10\" -> cost=1 (if we change to either \"11\" or \"00\").\n                total cost=1.\n\n            So it matches.\n\n            However, consider: \"1010\" (n=4) -> \n                We can change to:\n                    Option1: \"0000\": cost=2 (change positions 0 and 2) -> runs: \"0000\" (even) -> good.\n                    Option2: \"1100\": cost=2 -> runs: \"11\", \"00\" -> good.\n                    Option3: \"1110\": cost=2 -> runs: \"111\", \"0\" -> not good.\n                    Option4: \"1000\": cost=1 (change position2 to '0') -> runs: \"1\", \"000\" -> not good.\n\n                So minimum cost=2.\n\n            How does the block method work? \n                Block0: \"10\" -> cost=1 to make it \"00\" or \"11\".\n                Block1: \"10\" -> cost=1.\n                total cost=2.\n\n            So it matches.\n\n            But wait, is there a way to do it in 1 operation? \n                We try: \n                    Change position1 to '0': then we have \"1000\" -> runs: \"1\", \"000\" -> not good.\n                    Change position1 to '1': then we have \"1110\" -> runs: \"111\", \"0\" -> not good.\n                    Change position2 to '0': \"1000\" -> not good.\n                    Change position2 to '1': \"1011\" -> runs: \"1\", \"0\", \"11\" -> not good.\n                So no.\n\n            Therefore, the block method works.\n\n            But note: the problem does not require that we split the string into blocks of two. It might be that we can do better by not following the block partition? \n\n            However, the runs must be even, and the entire string has even length. It is known that the minimum cost is achieved by the block method.\n\n            Why? \n              Because any run must have even length, so it must be composed of an even number of characters. Therefore, the run boundaries must fall at even indices? \n\n            Actually, the run boundaries can be anywhere. But note: if we have a run of length L (even), then it covers L consecutive characters. The next run starts at an even index? \n\n            However, we can have: \n                \"00\" -> one run: covers indices0 and 1 -> then next run starts at index2 (even).\n\n            So the entire string is partitioned into blocks of two that are aligned to even indices.\n\n            Therefore, the block method is valid.\n\n            So the solution: \n                We split the string into blocks of two consecutive characters (non-overlapping, starting at even indices).\n\n                For each block, we decide to make it either \"00\" or \"11\". \n\n                However, there is a catch: adjacent blocks of the same digit will be merged. But that is okay because the run will be the sum of the lengths of consecutive same blocks, which is even (since each block is 2, and any number of consecutive blocks of the same digit will be 2*k, which is even).\n\n                Therefore, we only care about the cost per block.\n\n                But wait: what if we have two adjacent blocks that are both \"00\", then they will be merged. But that is allowed.\n\n                So the cost for a block is the number of changes needed to make it either \"00\" or \"11\". \n                    For a block \"00\": cost0=0, cost1=2 (if we want to make it \"11\")\n                    For a block \"01\": cost0=1 (if we make it \"00\"), cost1=1 (if we make it \"11\")\n                    For a block \"10\": similarly, cost0=1, cost1=1.\n                    For a block \"11\": cost0=2, cost1=0.\n\n                However, we have an additional freedom: we can choose for each block independently? \n\n                But note: if we choose for block i to be \"00\", and block i+1 to be \"00\", then they will be merged. But that doesn't cost extra. \n\n                Therefore, the cost for each block is independent.\n\n                But wait: is there any constraint between blocks? \n\n                The problem does not require that adjacent blocks are different. They can be the same.\n\n                So we can choose for each block independently the target (\"00\" or \"11\") to minimize the cost for that block.\n\n                Therefore, for block i, we choose the target that minimizes the cost for that block.\n\n                Then the total cost is the sum over blocks of min( cost0, cost1 ) for that block.\n\n                However, let me test with \"1010\" (n=4): \n                    Block0: \"10\": min(1,1)=1.\n                    Block1: \"10\": min(1,1)=1.\n                    Total cost=2.\n\n                Example \"111000\": \n                    Block0: \"11\" -> cost0=2, cost1=0 -> min=0.\n                    Block1: \"10\" -> min=1.\n                    Block2: \"00\" -> cost0=0, cost1=2 -> min=0.\n                    Total cost=1.\n\n                But wait, we have a known solution for \"111000\" in the problem note: \n                    One way: change s3, s6, s7 to '0' -> becomes \"1100000000\" -> cost=3? \n                    But they say there are ways to operate 3 times.\n\n                However, the problem note says: \n                    \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following: \n                     Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\", ... \n                     There are other ways to operate 3 times ... such as ...\"\n\n                But then it says: \n                    \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\n                And the first test case input: \n                    n=10, string: s = ? \n\n                The problem note does not specify the string for the first test case. \n\n                But the sample input in the problem statement for the first test case of the easy version: \n                    t=?\n                    first test case: n=10, string: \"1110011000\"\n\n                And the answer is 3.\n\n                How does our block method work for \"1110011000\" (n=10)?\n\n                We break into blocks of two:\n                    block0: \"11\" -> cost0=2, cost1=0 -> min=0.\n                    block1: \"10\" -> min=1.\n                    block2: \"01\" -> min=1.   [Note: the string is \"1110011000\", so the blocks are: \n                        0: s0s1 = \"11\"\n                        1: s2s3 = \"10\"\n                        2: s4s5 = \"01\"\n                        3: s6s7 = \"10\"\n                        4: s8s9 = \"00\"\n\n                    block3: \"10\" -> min=1.\n                    block4: \"00\" -> min=0.\n\n                Total cost = 0+1+1+1+0 = 3.\n\n                So it matches.\n\n                Therefore, the solution for program2.py is to split the string into blocks of two and for each block, add min(number of changes to make it \"00\", number of changes to make it \"11\").\n\n                But wait, the provided code in program2.py does not do that. \n\n                The provided code:\n\n                    import re\n                    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                        i=p=r=0\n                        for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n                            i+=1\n                            if len(t)&1:\n                                if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n                                else:# TODO: Your code here\n                        print(r)\n\n                This code splits the string into contiguous runs of 0's and 1's. \n\n                For each run t, it checks if the length is odd (if len(t)&1). \n                Then if p is not zero, it does: r += i - p; p=0.\n                Otherwise, if p is zero, then we do something (TODO).\n\n                What is p?

But then we can fix two adjacent odd runs with one operation? \n\n                  Actually, the solution in the provided code style is:\n\n                    We traverse the runs. \n                    We let p be the index of the last run that had odd length and that we haven't fixed yet.\n                    When we encounter an odd run, if p is 0 (meaning we don't have a pending odd run), then we set p to the current run index (i).\n                    If we encounter another odd run (and p is not 0), then we can fix both by flipping one bit between them? and then we add the difference in indices (i - p) and reset p to 0.\n\n                  Why the difference in indices? \n\n                  Example: \n                      runs: [run0 (odd), run1 (even), run2 (even), run3 (odd)] -> \n                          at run0: p=1 (if we index from 1) -> then at run3: we do r += 4-1 = 3, and then p=0.\n\n                  How does flipping one bit fix two odd runs? \n\n                  Note: flipping a bit at the boundary between two runs will merge them? but then the parity of the two runs might change.\n\n                  Actually, flipping a bit that is at the boundary between run i and run i+1 will:\n                      - It will merge run i and run i+1 into one run? \n                      - But then the parity of the new run is (len(run_i) + len(run_{i+1})) mod 2? \n                      However, we are flipping one bit: \n                         Suppose we have ... a (run_i of a's) then a b (run_{i+1} of b's). \n                         We flip the last a to b: then the run_i becomes even? (if it was odd, then odd-1 becomes even) and then the run_{i+1} becomes b's with an extra b at the front? \n                         But then the run_i (now even) and the next run becomes run_{i+1} with the first character now a? no, we flipped the last a to b, so the run_i becomes even (if we remove the last a) and then the run_{i+1} becomes: the first character is now a? no, it was b and we didn't change it. \n\n                  This is messy.\n\n                Alternatively, known solution from a known submission for the problem (easy version) in Codeforces:\n\n                  #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                  using namespace std;\n                  int main() {\n                    int t;\n                    cin >> t;\n                    while (t--) {\n                      int n;\n                      string s;\n                      cin >> n >> s;\n                      int ans = 0;\n                      for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {\n                        if (s[i] != s[i+1]) {\n                          ans++;\n                        }\n                      }\n                      cout << ans << '\\n';\n                    }\n                  }\n\n                But wait, this counts the number of blocks that are not constant. And then that is the cost? \n\n                How? \n                  For a block \"01\" or \"10\", we need one flip to make it constant. For \"00\" or \"11\", we need 0.\n\n                And then the total cost is the number of non-constant blocks.\n\n                But we saw that for \"1110011000\", the cost is 3, and there are 3 non-constant blocks: \n                    block1: \"10\" -> non-constant -> cost1=1.\n                    block2: \"01\" -> non-constant -> cost1=1.\n                    block3: \"10\" -> non-constant -> cost1=1.\n                total=3.\n\n                And for \"1010\": \n                    block0: \"10\" -> cost1=1.\n                    block1: \"10\" -> cost1=1.\n                    total=2.\n\n                So this matches.\n\n                Therefore, the easy version can be solved by simply counting the number of blocks of two that are not constant.\n\n                But then why does the provided code in program2.py use run splitting and then a loop over runs? \n\n                And the problem statement says: \n                    \"This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments.\"\n\n                So the easy version only asks for the minimum number of operations.\n\n                And the above solution (counting non-constant blocks) is for the easy version.\n\n                But the provided code in program2.py is:\n\n                    import re\n                    for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                        i=p=r=0\n                        for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n                            i+=1\n                            if len(t)&1:\n                                if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n                                else:# TODO: Your code here\n                        print(r)\n\n                This is for the hard version? \n\n                The problem says: the easy version.\n\n                And the sample input in the problem statement for the easy version has total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n                But the provided code is for the hard version? \n\n                The known solution for the hard version (which also asks for the minimum number of subsegments) is more complex.\n\n                Given the provided code structure, we must complete it as intended.\n\n                The intended solution in the provided code for the easy version might be the one that uses runs and fixes two odd runs with one operation? \n\n                How does that work? \n\n                Insight: \n                  In the final good string, every run has even length. \n                  Therefore, the number of runs with odd length must be zero.\n\n                How to fix an odd run? \n                  We can flip one bit at the boundary of two runs to merge two runs and change their parities.\n\n                  Specifically, if we have two consecutive runs of the same character? but they are separated by at least one character of the other.\n\n                  Actually, we can flip a bit at the boundary of two runs of different characters to merge them into one run? \n\n                  Example: \n                      ...0 1...  (the last bit of the first run is at the boundary with the next run)\n                  If we flip the last bit of the first run (from 0 to 1), then the first run loses one bit (so if it was odd, it becomes even) and the next run gains one bit (so if it was even, it becomes odd; if it was odd, it becomes even).\n\n                  But wait, we are flipping one bit: \n                      Suppose we have a run of 0's of length 3 (odd) and then a run of 1's of length 2 (even). \n                      We flip the last 0 to 1: \n                          Then the first run becomes length 2 (even) and the second run becomes: the first bit is now 0? no, we flipped the last 0 to 1, so the second run now starts with an extra 1? \n                      Actually, the first run becomes \"00\" and then we have a '1' that is now adjacent to the next run of 1's, so the second run becomes length 3 (odd).\n\n                  So we turned one odd run into an even run, but turned an even run into an odd run.\n\n                  Alternatively, if we have two consecutive odd runs (of different characters), we can flip one bit in the boundary to make both even? \n\n                  Example: \n                      run1: '000' (3 zeros) -> odd.\n                      run2: '111' (3 ones) -> odd.\n                      Flip the last bit of run1 (the last 0 to 1): \n                          run1 becomes '00' (even) and run2 becomes '1111' (even) -> because the flipped bit is now 1, so it merges with run2, making run2 = '1111' (which is 3+1=4, even).\n\n                  So one flip fixes two odd runs.\n\n                  Therefore, the minimum number of operations is at least (number of odd runs) / 2? \n\n                  But note: we might have an odd number of odd runs? \n\n                  However, the total length is even. The sum of the runs is even. The parity of the number of odd runs: \n                      The sum of the runs mod 2 is the sum of the parities of the runs mod 2. \n                      Since the total length is even, the sum of the runs is even -> the number of odd runs must be even.\n\n                  Therefore, we can pair them.\n\n                  And with one flip per pair, we can fix them.\n\n                  But wait: the above example used one flip to fix two odd runs.\n\n                  Therefore, the minimum number of operations is the number of odd runs / 2.\n\n                  However, consider: \n                      s = \"000\", which is one run of length 3 (odd). \n                      We need to fix it: \n                          We can flip one bit: \n                             If we flip the last bit to 1: then we get \"001\" -> two runs: \"00\" (even) and \"1\" (odd) -> not fixed.\n                          Flip the middle bit: \"010\" -> three runs: \"0\",\"1\",\"0\" -> all odd -> not fixed.\n                          Flip two bits: \n                             \"000\" -> if we flip the first and last: \"101\" -> runs: \"1\",\"0\",\"1\" -> all odd -> not fixed.\n                             \"000\" -> if we flip the first and second: \"110\" -> runs: \"11\",\"0\" -> even and odd -> not fixed.\n                             \"000\" -> if we flip the second and third: \"011\" -> runs: \"0\",\"11\" -> odd and even -> not fixed.\n\n                      We need to flip two bits: \n                         \"000\" -> if we flip the first to 1 and the last to 1: \"101\" -> not fixed.\n                         Or flip the first and the second to 1: \"110\" -> then we have two runs: \"11\" (even) and \"0\" (odd) -> not fixed.\n                         Or flip the first to 1 and the last to 1: \"101\" -> not fixed.\n\n                      Alternatively, we can flip one bit and create two runs: \n                         \"000\" -> flip the last to 1: \"001\" -> then we have two runs: \"00\" (even) and \"1\" (odd). \n                         Then we need to fix the \"1\" run: flip one bit in the next run? but there is no next run.\n\n                      So we might need to flip two bits in the same run? \n\n                  This indicates that the pairing must be done between consecutive runs.\n\n                  Therefore, the solution is: \n                      We must pair the odd runs. And the cost is the number of pairs, which is (number of odd runs) / 2.\n\n                  But wait, the sample \"000\" has one odd run -> then we would need 0.5 operations? -> not integer.\n\n                  So the number of odd runs is even.\n\n                  In the example \"000\", we are not done. We must have more context. The string has length 3, but the problem states that n is even. So this example is not valid.\n\n                  Therefore, we only consider even n.\n\n                  Example: \"0000\" -> even run, cost=0.\n                  Example: \"000\" is not allowed because n is even.\n\n                  Example: \"000111\" (n=6): \n                      runs: ['000','111'] -> both odd.\n                      We can flip the last bit of the first run: change the last '0' to '1'. \n                         Then the string becomes \"00111\" -> runs: \"00\", \"111\" -> then we have one even and one odd.\n                      But wait, we want to fix both. \n                      Alternatively, flip the boundary bit: the last '0' to '1': then the first run becomes \"00\" (even) and the second run becomes \"1111\" (even) -> cost=1.\n\n                  Therefore, cost=1 = (number of odd runs)/2 = 2/2=1.\n\n                  But then why in the provided code they do: \n                      if p: \n                         r += i - p\n                         p = 0\n                      else:\n                         p = i   [or something]\n\n                  and then the answer is r?\n\n                  What is 'r'? \n\n                  In the sample \"000111\", the runs are:\n                      run1: \"000\" -> odd -> p was 0, so we set p=1 (the index of this run).\n                      run2: \"111\" -> odd -> then we do: r += 2 - 1 = 1, and then p=0.\n\n                  So r=1.\n\n                  In the sample \"000111000\", n=9 -> not even, so skip.\n\n                  Example with three odd runs: not possible because the total number of odd runs must be even.\n\n                  Example with four odd runs: \n                      s = \"000111000111\" (n=12)\n                      runs: ['000','111','000','111'] -> four odd runs.\n                      We can pair the first and second with one flip: \n                         Flip the last '0' in the first run to '1': then we get \"00111 000 111\" -> \n                             runs: \"00\", \"1111\", \"000\", \"111\" -> \n                             now the second run is even, but the third and fourth are odd.\n                         Then we can pair the third and fourth: \n                             Flip the last '0' in the third run to '1': then we get \"00\", \"1111\", \"00111\" -> \n                                 runs: \"00\", \"1111\", \"00\", \"111\" -> \n                                 then we have: \n                                    \"00\", \"1111\" (even), \"00\", \"111\" -> \n                                 the last run is odd.\n                         Alternatively, we should pair consecutively: \n                             First, pair run1 and run2: cost1, then we have even runs in between? \n                             Then the next two: run3 and run4: cost1.\n\n                      Total cost=2.\n\n                  How does the provided code work? \n                      run1: \"000\" -> odd: p=1.\n                      run2: \"111\" -> odd: r += 2-1 = 1, p=0.\n                      run3: \"000\" -> odd: p=3.\n                      run4: \"111\" -> odd: r += 4-3 = 1, then r=2.\n\n                  So it works.\n\n                  But what if the odd runs are not adjacent? \n                      Example: \"000\", \"11\", \"000\", \"11\" -> \n                          runs: \n                              run1: \"000\" -> odd -> p=1.\n                              run2: \"11\" -> even -> skip.\n                              run3: \"000\" -> odd -> then we do: since p is not 0, we do r += 3-1 = 2, and then p=0.\n                              run4: \"11\" -> even -> skip.\n\n                  But is that the minimum? \n                      We have two odd runs: run1 and run3.\n                      We can fix them by flipping one bit in between? \n                         The string: \"000 11 000 11\"\n                         We want to fix run1 and run3. \n                         We can flip the last bit of run1 to '1': then we get \"0011 000 11\" -> \n                             runs: \"00\", \"11\", \"000\", \"11\" -> \n                             run1 becomes even, run3 is still odd.\n                         Then we flip the last bit of run3 to '1': then we get \"00\", \"11\", \"0011\" -> \n                             runs: \"00\", \"11\", \"00\", \"11\" -> all even. \n                         cost=2.\n\n                  And the provided code also gives 2.\n\n                  But note: the code does not use the distance between the runs in the string, but the difference in the run indices (i - p). \n\n                  Why is that the cost? \n\n                  In the example above, the cost is 2, and the difference in run indices is 3-1=2.\n\n                  But the actual number of flips is 2.\n\n                  How are they related? \n\n                  The variable 'i' is the index of the current run (starting at 1). \n                  The variable 'p' is the index of the previous pending odd run.\n\n                  The cost for pairing two odd runs is the difference in their indices? \n\n                  But the number of flips is 1 per pair, not the difference in indices.\n\n                  This is not matching.\n\n                  Let me read a known solution for the hard version (which also counts the minimum number of segments) in Codeforces for problem \"Tokitsukaze and Good 01-String (hard version)\":\n\n                    #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                    using namespace std;\n                    int main() {\n                      int t;\n                      cin >> t;\n                      while (t--) {\n                        int n;\n                        string s;\n                        cin >> n >> s;\n                        int ans = 0, cnt = 0;\n                        char last = ' ';\n                        vector<int> v;\n                        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {\n                          if (s[i] != s[i+1]) {\n                            ans++;\n                          } else {\n                            if (s[i] != last) {\n                              cnt++;\n                              last = s[i];\n                            }\n                          }\n                        }\n                        cout << ans << ' ' << max(1, cnt) << '\\n';\n                      }\n                    }\n\n                  But this is for the hard version.\n\n                Given the time, and since the problem says the easy version, and the provided code in program2.py has a TODO in the else branch, and the intended solution for the easy version might be to count the number of non-constant blocks, but the provided code structure is for the hard version, we must complete the provided code.\n\n                The provided code for program2.py is for the easy version? or hard? \n\n                The problem says: \"This is the easy version\", and the code is provided for program2.py.\n\n                And the sample input in the problem statement for program2.py has total n<=200000.\n\n                The provided code uses run-splitting and then processes runs.\n\n                The known solution for the easy version using runs is: \n                    The minimum number of operations is the number of odd runs divided by 2.\n\n                But wait, the sample \"1110011000\" has runs: \n                    ['111','00','11','000'] -> \n                    run0: '111' -> len=3 (odd)\n                    run1: '00' -> even\n                    run2: '11' -> even\n                    run3: '000' -> len=3 (odd)\n                    -> two odd runs -> cost=2/2=1? \n\n                But we know the answer is 3.\n\n                This indicates that the solution using runs might be different.\n\n                Let me try with the block method on \"1110011000\": \n                    We break into blocks: \n                         block0: \"11\" -> constant -> cost0.\n                         block1: \"10\" -> not constant -> cost1.\n                         block2: \"01\" -> not constant -> cost1.\n                         block3: \"10\" -> not constant -> cost1.\n                         block4: \"00\" -> constant -> cost0.\n                    total cost=3.\n\n                How to reconcile with the run method? \n\n                The run method: \n                    We have two odd runs. \n                    We can fix them by flipping one bit in between? \n                    But note: the two odd runs are not consecutive. There are even runs in between.\n\n                The provided code in the else branch: \n                    We are to set p to something.\n\n                In the sample \"1110011000\", the first run is odd: \n                    i=1, p=0 -> so we set p=1.\n                Then we see even runs: i=2 and i=3: skip.\n                Then the fourth run is odd: i=4, then we do: \n                    if p: then r += 4-1 = 3, and then p=0.\n\n                Then the answer is 3.\n\n                Why 3? \n\n                What does 3 represent? \n\n                It is the difference in the run indices: 4-1=3.\n\n                But the number of operations is 3? \n\n                How does that work? \n\n                Insight: \n                  We need to fix the two odd runs. We can do it by flipping one bit per run to make them even? \n                  But then we would need 2 operations (one for each run).\n\n                However, the provided code does not use that.\n\n                Alternatively, the intended meaning of 'r' is not the number of operations, but something else.\n\n                But the problem asks for the minimum number of operations.\n\n                In the sample, it outputs 3.\n\n                And the sample's minimum number of operations is 3.\n\n                How is the difference in run indices (3) the number of operations? \n\n                Let me see: \n                  In the sample, we have to fix the first run and the last run. \n                  We can fix the first run by flipping one bit? \n                  We can fix the last run by flipping one bit? \n                  But that would be 2 operations.\n\n                Why is the answer 3 in the problem note? \n\n                The problem note for program2.py says: \n                    \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following: \n                     Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0'\"\n\n                That is 3 operations.\n\n                And there is no way to do it in 2 operations? \n\n                Let me try: \n                    s = \"1110011000\"\n                    We want to make it good.\n\n                    Option: do 2 operations.\n                      We try to fix the two odd runs: \n                         The first run is \"111\": we can change the last bit to '0': then we get \"110\" for the first three, but then the string becomes \"1100011000\", which has runs: \n                             \"11\" (even), \"000\" (odd), \"11\" (even), \"000\" (odd) -> not fixed.\n                      We try to change the first run's first bit to '0': then we get \"0110011000\" -> runs: \"0\",\"11\",\"00\",\"11\",\"000\" -> not fixed.\n\n                    So indeed, the minimum is 3.\n\n                Therefore, the solution in the provided code is: \n                    We pair the odd runs in the order they appear. For the first odd run, we remember its index (p = i). \n                    When we find the next odd run at index i, we add (i - p) to the answer and reset p to 0.\n\n                Why is (i-p) the number of operations required to fix the pair? \n\n                It is not. \n\n                Then what is the meaning of (i-p)? \n\n                In the sample: \n                    first odd run at index1, next at index4: 4-1=3.\n\n                And the answer is 3.\n\n                In the sample with four consecutive odd runs: \n                    runs: [odd, even, even, odd] -> \n                         first odd: p=1.\n                         then even: skip.\n                         then even: skip.\n                         then odd: i=4, then r += 4-1 = 3.\n                    then we have two more odd runs: \n                         next odd: p=5 (if there is a fifth run that is odd) -> then next odd at i=6: r += 6-5=1.\n                    total r=3+1=4.\n\n                But the minimum operations might be 2.\n\n                This indicates that the provided code might be for the hard version? \n\n                The problem says: \"This is the easy version\", and the hard version asks for the minimum number of segments as well.\n\n                Given the complexity, and since the problem asks for the easy version, and the provided code structure is given, we must complete the TODO.\n\n                The TODO is in the else branch of:\n\n                    if len(t)&1:\n                        if p: \n                            r += i - p\n                            p = 0\n                        else:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                In the else branch, we set p to the current run index.\n\n                So the missing code is: \n                    p = i\n\n                Then the code will remember the index of the current odd run.\n\n                And then when we see the next odd run, we add the difference in indices.\n\n                But then the answer for the first test case is 3, which matches.\n\n                For the second test case: \n                    Input: \n                        2\n                        aa\n                        aa\n                    This is good initially, so answer=0.\n\n                    How does the code work? \n                        s = \"aa\" (or \"aa\\n\"?)\n                        re.findall('0+|1+', \"aa\") -> will it find anything? \n                        The string is \"aa\", which is not binary! \n\n                Wait, the problem says: the string is binary, consisting of '0' and '1'. \n\n                So the input string for program2.py is a binary string.\n\n                Therefore, the regular expression will split into runs of '0's and '1's.\n\n                For the test case: \n                    n=2, string=\"00\" (or \"11\", or \"01\", etc.)\n\n                Example: \"00\" -> \n                    runs: ['00'] -> even -> not odd, so the loop does nothing. \n                    then print(r)=0.\n\n                Example: \"01\" -> \n                    runs: ['0','1'] -> both length1 (odd) -> \n                       first run: i=1, if p: no, so else: p=1.\n                       second run: i=2, if p: yes, so r += 2-1 = 1, p=0.\n                    then print(r)=1.\n\n                But the minimum operations for \"01\" is 1 (change one bit to make it \"00\" or \"11\").\n\n                Example: \"000111\" (n=6) -> \n                    runs: ['000','111'] -> both odd.\n                    first run: p=1.\n                    second run: r += 2-1 = 1.\n                    then answer=1.\n\n                But the minimum operations for \"000111\" is 1.\n\n                Example: \"1110011000\" -> \n                    runs: ['111','00','11','000'] -> \n                         run0: '111' -> odd: p=1.\n                         run1: '00' -> even: skip.\n                         run2: '11' -> even: skip.\n                         run3: '000' -> odd: then r += 3-1 = 2? \n                    but the run indices: \n                         i for run0: 1\n                         i for run1: 2\n                         i for run2: 3\n                         i for run3: 4\n                    then r = 4-1 = 3.\n\n                And the answer is 3.\n\n                Therefore, the TODO is to set p to the current run index i.\n\n                So the missing code for program2.py is: \n                    p = i\n\n        Therefore, we complete:\n\n          program1.py: in the first TODO, add the line: `count += d[c + s[1]]`\n          program2.py: in the else branch, add the line: `p = i`\n\n        But note: in program1.py, the code already has the second part. We only added one line.\n\n        Now, we output in the required JSON format.\n\n        Example: \n          {\n            \"program1\": \"count += d[c + s[1]]\",\n            \"program2\": \"p = i\"\n          }\n\n        However, in program1.py, the line must be indented properly. But the problem says to output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n        We output the string exactly as it should appear in the missing part.\n\n        For program1.py, the missing part is the single line: \"count += d[c + s[1]]\"\n\n        For program2.py, the missing part is the single line: \"p = i\"\n\n        But note: in program2.py, the TODO is in the else branch, and there might be multiple statements? \n\n        The current code in the else branch is empty. We only need to set p=i.\n\n        So we output:\n\n          \"program1\": \"count += d[c + s[1]]\",\n          \"program2\": \"p = i\"\n\n        However, in program2.py, after setting p=i, we might need to do something else? \n\n        The code in the if branch does: \n            r += i - p\n            p = 0\n\n        In the else branch, we only set p=i.\n\n        That is the complete code.\n\n        Let me test program2.py with the provided examples in the problem note for program2.py:\n\n            Example 1: \n                Input: \n                    1\n                    10\n                    1110011000\n                Output: 3\n\n            Example 2,3,4: \n                Input: \n                    4\n                    2\n                    00\n                    4\n                    0000\n                    4\n                    0011\n                    6\n                    000111\n                Output: \n                    0\n                    0\n                    0\n                    1\n\n            How does our code work for the fourth test case: \n                n=6, s=\"000111\"\n                runs: ['000','111'] -> \n                    run0: i=1, len=3 (odd) -> else branch: p=1.\n                    run1: i=2, len=3 (odd) -> if p: then r += 2-1 = 1, p=0.\n                output: 1.\n\n            The problem note says: \n                \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\n            But the fourth test case is \"000111\", which is not good initially? \n                It has two runs: '000' (odd) and '111' (odd) -> not good.\n\n            The problem note says the fourth test case is good initially? \n\n            Let me read the problem note for program2.py:\n\n                \"In the first test case ... \n                 In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\n            The sample input has 4 test cases: \n                test1: n=10, s=\"1110011000\" -> not good.\n                test2: n=2, s=\"00\" -> good.\n                test3: n=4, s=\"0000\" -> good.\n                test4: n=4, s=\"0011\" -> good.\n\n            So the fourth test case is \"0011\", not \"000111\". \n\n            The example input we did for \"000111\" is not in the problem note.\n\n            Therefore, the provided examples in the problem note for program2.py are:\n\n                test1: 10, \"1110011000\" -> 3\n                test2: 2, \"00\" -> 0\n                test3: 4, \"0000\" -> 0\n                test4: 4, \"0011\" -> 0\n\n            How does our code work for test4: \"0011\"?\n                runs: ['00','11'] -> both even -> the loop does nothing -> output 0.\n\n            So it matches.\n\n        Therefore, we are confident.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n          {\n            \"program1\": \"count += d[c + s[1]]\", \n            \"program2\": \"p = i\"\n          }"
