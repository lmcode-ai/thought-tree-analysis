We start with:\n\n      tar = [0] * n   -> all zeros\n      aws = (n*(n+1))//2   -> base\n\n  Then we set each element to the initial value. But note: when we set the first element, the adjacent pairs are (0,0) -> then we set to a[0]. Then the adjacent pairs: \n      at index0: left boundary doesn't exist, right boundary: from 0 to 1? Actually, we can do:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function uses the current value at tar[i] and the neighbors. Initially, tar is zeros. When we set the first element (i=0) to a0, then:\n      left_edit: i=0 -> no left neighbor -> 0.\n      right_edit: if n>1, then we compare with tar[1] (which is 0). (x != tar[1]) -> (a0 ! = 0) -> true (since a0>=1) -> 1.\n          (tar[i] (which is 0) ! = tar[1] (0)) -> false -> 0. so right_edit = 1 - 0 = 1. Then we update: aws = base + 1 * (0+1) * (n-0-1) = base + 1 * 1 * (n-1) = base + (n-1). Then we set the next element (i=1) to a1:\n      left_edit: i=1 -> compare with i-1=0: \n          (a1 != a0) - (0 (the old value at index1) ! = a0) But note: the array at index0 is now a0 (from the first update) and at index1 is 0 (initially). (a1 != a0) -> we don't know, but initially the array was zeros, so the old value at index1 was 0, and the neighbor at index0 is a0 (which is not 0) -> so (0 != a0) is true -> 1. So left_edit = (a1 != a0) - 1.\n      right_edit: if n>2, then (a1 != tar[2]) - (0 != tar[2]) -> (a1 != 0) - (0 != 0) -> (true) - (false) = 1 - 0 = 1. This seems messy. Instead, we can avoid the initial zeros by initializing `tar` to the initial array and then computing the initial awesomeness by:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          if tar[i] ! = tar[i+1]:\n              aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1) But note: the update_awesomeness function is called with `tar` as the array, and we are going to update `tar` in the update function. So we must set `tar` to the initial array. Therefore, we can do:\n\n      tar = list(arr)   # instead of [0]*n\n\n  Then we compute the initial awesomeness:\n\n      aws = (n*(n+1))//2\n      for i in range(n-1): if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n              aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function uses the same formula for the adjacent pairs?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an initial array and m queries. After each query (which updates an element), we must output the sum of awesomeness values over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nThe awesomeness of a contiguous subarray is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,2,2] has awesomeness 2 (blocks [1] and [2,2]).\n\nThe initial code sets up:\n  n, m = ... \n  arr = ... (the initial array)\n  tar = [0] * n   # This seems suspicious because we are going to update the array? But note: in the update function we have \"arr[i] = x\", and the initial array is read into `arr`. However, in the update_awesomeness function, we are using `arr` (which is the initial array) and then updating it. But note: the for-loop after reading the array uses `arr` (the initial array) and then the update function uses `tar`? Actually, there is a bug: the update_awesomeness function is called with `tar` as the array, but the initial array is stored in `arr`. Also, the initial array is never copied to `tar`. \n\nLooking at the provided update_awesomeness function:\n\n  def update_awesomeness(arr, i, x, curr_aws):\n      left_edit = (x != arr[i - 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) if i != 0 else 0\n      right_edit = (x != arr[i + 1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i + 1]) if i != n - 1 else 0\n      arr[i] = x\n      return curr_aws + left_edit * i * (n - i) + right_edit * (i + 1) * (n - i - 1)\n\nThis function updates the array at index i to x and then updates the current awesomeness sum (curr_aws) by considering the change at the left boundary (with the element at i-1) and the right boundary (with the element at i+1).\n\nThe idea is that the awesomeness of a contiguous subarray [l, r] is 1 plus the number of indices j (from l to r-1) such that a[j] != a[j+1]. Therefore, the total sum over all subarrays is:\n\n  Total = (number of subarrays) + (number of adjacent pairs (i, i+1) that are different, counted over all subarrays that include the pair)\n\nBut note: the number of subarrays is n*(n+1)//2.\n\nAnd for an adjacent pair (i, i+1), the number of subarrays that include this pair is (i+1) * (n - i - 1) [because the subarray must start at any index from 0 to i and end at any index from i+1 to n-1]. However, note that the formula in the update function uses:\n\n  left_edit: for the pair (i-1, i) -> the number of subarrays that include this pair is i * (n - i) [because the pair (i-1, i) is at index i-1 and i. The starting index can be from 0 to i-1 and the ending index from i to n-1 -> so (i) * (n - i)].\n\nSimilarly, for the pair (i, i+1): the number of subarrays that include it is (i+1) * (n - i - 1).\n\nTherefore, the total awesomeness sum is:\n\n  base = n*(n+1)//2   [each subarray has at least 1 block]\n  plus for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different, we add the number of subarrays that include that pair (because each such difference adds 1 to the awesomeness of the subarray).\n\nSo initially, we can compute:\n\n  aws = n*(n+1)//2   [the base]\n\n  Then for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different, we add (i+1) * (n - i - 1) [because the pair is at index i and i+1, so the starting index can be from 0 to i (i+1 choices) and ending index from i+1 to n-1 (n-i-1 choices) -> but note: the formula in the update function for the right boundary uses (i+1) * (n-i-1) for the pair (i, i+1)].\n\nHowever, in the initial setup, we have:\n\n  for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n      # TODO: Your code here\n\nThis loop is iterating over the initial array. But note: we are going to update the array with queries. The initial array must be processed to set the initial awesomeness.\n\nBut the update_awesomeness function is designed for updating one element. We cannot use it for the initial array because we are starting from an empty array? Actually, we are starting from an array of zeros? (because tar = [0]*n). That doesn't match.\n\nWe must set the initial array in `tar` to the given array? And then compute the initial awesomeness.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the initial awesomeness by:\n\n  Start with base = n*(n+1)//2.\n\n  Then for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) in the array, if they are different, then add (i+1) * (n - i - 1) [but note: the index i in the array for the adjacent pair between index i and i+1 is at position i (0-indexed)].\n\nBut note: the update_awesomeness function is called with `tar` as the array. So we must initialize `tar` to the initial array.\n\nSo the missing part in program1.py:\n\n  We have:\n      n, m = ... \n      arr = ... (the initial array)\n      tar = [0] * n   -> we should set tar to the initial array? \n\n  Then we have:\n      aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2   [the base]\n\n  Then we need to account for the adjacent differences in the initial array.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          if tar[i] != tar[i+1]:\n              aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function uses the same formula: for a change at index i, it updates the left boundary (with i-1) and the right boundary (with i+1). However, in the initial array, we don't have any updates, so we can compute the initial awesomeness by iterating over adjacent pairs.\n\n  However, the for-loop in the code is:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  This loop is over the initial array. We are going to update `tar` to the initial array? And also update the awesomeness? \n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function is designed for updating one element. We are going to set the entire array. We can simulate setting each element? But the array is initially zeros? Then we set each element to the initial value? That would work.\n\n  However, the update_awesomeness function updates the current array and the current awesomeness. We start with:\n\n      tar = [0] * n   -> all zeros\n      aws = (n*(n+1))//2   -> base\n\n  Then we set each element to the initial value. But note: when we set the first element, the adjacent pairs are (0,0) -> then we set to a[0]. Then the adjacent pairs: \n      at index0: left boundary doesn't exist, right boundary: from 0 to 1? \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function uses the current value at tar[i] and the neighbors. Initially, tar is zeros. When we set the first element (i=0) to a0, then:\n      left_edit: i=0 -> no left neighbor -> 0.\n      right_edit: if n>1, then we compare with tar[1] (which is 0). \n          (x != tar[1]) -> (a0 != 0) -> true (since a0>=1) -> 1.\n          (tar[i] (which is 0) != tar[1] (0)) -> false -> 0.\n          so right_edit = 1 - 0 = 1.\n      Then we update: aws = base + 1 * (0+1) * (n-0-1) = base + 1 * 1 * (n-1) = base + (n-1).\n\n  Then we set the next element (i=1) to a1:\n      left_edit: i=1 -> compare with i-1=0: \n          (a1 != a0) - (0 (the old value at index1) != a0) \n          But note: the array at index0 is now a0 (from the first update) and at index1 is 0 (initially). \n          (a1 != a0) -> we don't know, but initially the array was zeros, so the old value at index1 was 0, and the neighbor at index0 is a0 (which is not 0) -> so (0 != a0) is true -> 1.\n          So left_edit = (a1 != a0) - 1.\n      right_edit: if n>2, then (a1 != tar[2]) - (0 != tar[2]) -> (a1 != 0) - (0 != 0) -> (true) - (false) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n  This seems messy. Instead, we can avoid the initial zeros by initializing `tar` to the initial array and then computing the initial awesomeness by:\n\n      base = n*(n+1)//2\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          if tar[i] != tar[i+1]:\n              aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function is called with `tar` as the array, and we are going to update `tar` in the update function. So we must set `tar` to the initial array.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      tar = list(arr)   # instead of [0]*n\n\n  Then we compute the initial awesomeness:\n\n      aws = (n*(n+1))//2\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n              aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function uses the same formula for the adjacent pairs? Actually, the formula in the update_awesomeness function for the left boundary uses i (the index) and multiplies by i * (n-i) for the left boundary (which is the pair (i-1, i)). However, in our initial computation we are using (i+1) * (n-i-1) for the pair (i, i+1). \n\n  Why the difference? \n\n  In the update_awesomeness function:\n\n      left_edit: for the pair (i-1, i) -> the number of subarrays that include this pair is i * (n-i) [because the starting index can be from 0 to i-1 (i choices) and the ending index from i to n-1 (n-i choices)].\n\n      right_edit: for the pair (i, i+1) -> (i+1) * (n-i-1) [starting index from 0 to i (i+1 choices) and ending index from i+1 to n-1 (n-i-1 choices)].\n\n  So for the initial array, we need to account for every adjacent pair (i, i+1) for i from 0 to n-2. For each such pair that is different, we add (i+1) * (n-i-1) [which is the same as the right_edit formula for the pair at index i and i+1, but note: the update_awesomeness function uses the same formula for the right_edit at index i (which affects the pair (i, i+1))].\n\n  However, wait: the update_awesomeness function for the left_edit at index i is for the pair (i-1, i) and uses i * (n-i). So if we have a difference at the pair (i, i+1) that is at index i and i+1, then we would account for that when we are at index i (as the right_edit) and also when we are at index i+1 (as the left_edit). \n\n  But in the initial computation, we are only accounting for the pair (i, i+1) once. And we are using the formula (i+1)*(n-i-1). So that matches the right_edit formula for the element at index i (if we were updating the element at index i, then the right_edit would be for the pair (i, i+1)). However, in the initial array we are not updating, so we can simply compute the total contribution of all adjacent pairs that are different by:\n\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n              aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function also accounts for the left_edit when updating an element. However, the initial array is fixed and we are not updating, so we don't have to break it down by which element caused the difference.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n      tar = arr[:]   # or list(arr) to make a copy\n      aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          if tar[i] != tar[i+1]:\n              aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  However, note: the update_awesomeness function uses the array that we pass to it. We are going to update `tar` in the update_awesomeness function. So we must set `tar` to the initial array.\n\n  But the code already has: \n      tar = [0] * n\n\n  We should change that to the initial array? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      # Instead of: tar = [0] * n\n      tar = arr[:]   # copy\n\n  Then we compute the initial awesomeness as above.\n\n  But note: the for-loop that follows:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  This loop is unnecessary? Because we have already set `tar` to the initial array and computed the initial awesomeness. Then we process the queries. However, the problem says that after each query we output the answer. The initial state (before any query) is the initial array. But the problem does not require to output the initial state? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"after each query\" print the answer. The first query is the first update. So we must output the initial state? \n\n  The problem input: \n      first line: n, m\n      second line: initial array\n      then m lines of queries.\n\n  The output: m lines, one after each query.\n\n  Therefore, we must output the initial state? No, only after each query. The initial state is not a query. So we don't output the initial state. We only output after each of the m queries.\n\n  However, the initial array is set and we have computed the initial awesomeness. Then we process the queries:\n\n      for line in INPUT[2:]:\n          i, x = ... \n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i-1, x, aws)\n          print(aws)\n\n  So the initial awesomeness is stored in `aws` and then we update for each query.\n\n  But the problem says: \"after each query\" meaning after updating the array, we output the answer.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n      # We set tar to the initial array and compute the initial awesomeness.\n      tar = arr[:]   # we change tar to be a copy of the initial array\n      aws = (n * (n + 1)) // 2\n      for i in range(n-1):\n          if tar[i] != tar[i+1]:\n              aws += (i+1) * (n - i - 1)\n\n  And then we skip the for-loop that iterates over the initial array? Because we don't need to update the initial array again? \n\n  But the code has:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can remove that loop? Or we can leave it as doing nothing? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  Actually, we can use that loop to initialize `tar` and the awesomeness? But the update_awesomeness function is designed for updating one element. We can simulate setting the entire array from zeros to the initial array? \n\n  However, the problem says: the initial array is given. We can do either:\n\n      Option 1: \n          tar = [0] * n   # as originally\n          aws = (n*(n+1))//2\n          for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n              aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n      This would set the array from zeros to the initial array by updating each element. This is O(n) and acceptable since n, m <= 10^5 and we have n updates initially and then m queries -> total n+m <= 200000.\n\n  Option 2: \n          tar = arr[:] \n          aws = (n*(n+1))//2\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n                  aws += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n  Both are acceptable. However, the update_awesomeness function is provided and we must use it? The problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only to fill the missing part.\n\n  The code already has:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  So we must fill that loop. We can do:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: initially, `tar` is [0]*n. We are updating each element to the initial value. This will correctly compute the initial awesomeness.\n\n  Why? Because initially, the array is all zeros. Then we set each element one by one. The update_awesomeness function will update the adjacent pairs. \n\n  However, the update_awesomeness function uses the current value at the index and the neighbors. When we set the first element, the neighbors are zeros. Then when we set the second, the neighbors are the first element (which is set) and the third (which is still zero). \n\n  This should work. And it matches the update_awesomeness function that we are going to use for the queries.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function updates the array `tar` at index i to x. So we are building the initial array.\n\n  However, the initial array is stored in `arr`, and we are updating `tar` (which started as zeros) to `arr`.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function uses the current value at the index to compute the change. Initially, the current value is 0. So when we set the element at index i to x, we are replacing 0 by x.\n\n  The update_awesomeness function:\n\n      left_edit = (x != arr[i-1]) - (arr[i] != arr[i-1]) ... \n\n  But note: the array passed is `tar`. In the first call, for i=0:\n      arr (which is tar) at index0 is 0. Then we set it to x = arr[0] (the initial value).\n      left_edit: i=0 -> no left neighbor -> 0.\n      right_edit: if n>1, then \n          (x != tar[1]) -> (arr[0] != 0) -> true (since arr[0]>=1) -> 1.\n          (arr[i] (which is 0) != tar[1] (which is 0)) -> false -> 0.\n          so right_edit = 1.\n\n      Then we update: aws = base (which is n*(n+1)//2) + 1 * (0+1) * (n-0-1) = base + (n-1).\n\n  Then for i=1:\n      left_edit: \n          (x (arr[1]) != tar[0]) -> (arr[1] != arr[0]) -> let that be d1 (1 if different, 0 if same)\n          (old value: tar[1] is 0) != tar[0] -> (0 != arr[0]) -> true -> 1.\n          so left_edit = d1 - 1.\n      right_edit: if n>2, then \n          (arr[1] != tar[2]) -> (arr[1] != 0) -> true -> 1.\n          (0 != tar[2]) -> (0 != 0) -> false -> 0.\n          so right_edit = 1.\n\n      Then update: aws = base + (n-1) + (d1-1)*1*(n-1) + 1*2*(n-2)\n\n  This is getting complicated. But note: the entire array is being built from zeros. The final awesomeness should be the same as if we computed it from the initial array.\n\n  However, the update_awesomeness function is designed for one update. When we update an element, we are changing one element. But here we are building the array from scratch. The initial state (all zeros) has awesomeness: \n      base = n*(n+1)//2, and then the adjacent pairs: all zeros -> so no additional contribution. \n      Then we update each element. \n\n  The problem: the initial array is given and we are to compute the initial awesomeness. We can do it by either method. But the method using the for-loop with update_awesomeness is provided and consistent.\n\n  Therefore, we fill the TODO in program1.py with:\n\n      aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the variable `aws` is initially set to (n*(n+1))//2. Then we update it for each element.\n\n  However, the update_awesomeness function returns the updated aws. So we must assign it.\n\n  So:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  This will set the initial array and compute the initial awesomeness.\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function updates the array `tar` at index i to x. So after the loop, `tar` becomes the initial array.\n\n  Then we process the queries.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the initial value of `aws` is set to (n*(n+1))//2. Then we update it for each element. This is the initial state.\n\n  We do not output the initial state. The first output is after the first query.\n\n  This matches the sample: \n      Input: \n          5 1\n          1 2 3 4 5\n          2 2\n      Then the first query: i=2, x=2 -> so update index1 (0-indexed) to 2.\n\n      The initial array is [1,2,3,4,5] -> then we update index1 (which is the second element) from 2 to 2? That doesn't change. But the sample says after the first query the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] and the answer is 29.\n\n      How do we get 29?\n\n      The initial array [1,2,3,4,5] has awesomeness sum = ?\n\n      We can compute: \n        base = 15\n        adjacent pairs:\n          (1,2): different -> add 1 * (5-1-1) = 1*3 = 3\n          (2,3): different -> add 2 * (5-2-1) = 2*2 = 4\n          (3,4): different -> add 3 * (5-3-1) = 3*1 = 3\n          (4,5): different -> add 4 * (5-4-1) = 4*0 = 0 -> total = 15+3+4+3 = 25.\n\n      Then the first query: update index1 (which is the element at index1, currently 2) to 2 -> no change? So why 29?\n\n      But the sample input says: \n          \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\"\n\n      So the initial array was [1,2,3,4,5] and the first query changes the third element (index2) from 3 to 2? \n\n      The input says: \n          \"5 1\"\n          \"1 2 3 4 5\"\n          \"2 2\"   -> meaning i=2 (the second element? or the third?) \n\n      The problem: \"each line contains two integers i and x (1<=i<=n)\". So i=2 means the second element? But the array is 1-indexed? \n\n      The update_awesomeness function uses index i-1. So in the query, we do i-1 -> so the second element (index1) is updated? \n\n      But the sample says: after the first query the array is [1,2,2,4,5]. So the third element (index2) was changed from 3 to 2? \n\n      Actually, the problem says: \"the i-th element\". So i=2 means the second element? But the sample output says the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] -> so the third element (which is at index2) is changed? \n\n      The sample input: \n          \"2 2\" -> so i=2 -> index1 (0-indexed) -> the second element. But the second element was 2 and we set it to 2 -> no change? \n\n      This is confusing.\n\n      Let me read the sample note: \n          \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\n      The initial array was [1,2,3,4,5]. The first query is \"2 2\" -> so if we update the second element (index1) from 2 to 2, then the array remains [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\n      But the note says the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] -> so the third element (index2) was updated from 3 to 2. \n\n      Therefore, the query \"2 2\" must be interpreted as updating the element at position 2 (which is the second element in 1-indexed? but that would be the second element) -> but the third element is at position 3? \n\n      The problem says: \"i-th element\". So the array has positions 1,2,3,4,5. The query \"2 2\" updates the element at position 2? Then the array becomes [1, 2->2, ...] -> but that doesn't change the second element. \n\n      Alternatively, the problem might have a typo? \n\n      Actually, the sample input in the note: \n          \"5 1\"\n          \"1 2 3 4 5\"\n          \"2 2\"\n\n      and then the array becomes [1,2,2,4,5] -> so the third element (which was 3) becomes 2. Therefore, the query \"2 2\" must be updating the element at position 3? \n\n      But the problem says: \"i\" (1<=i<=n). So the first element is i=1, the second i=2, the third i=3.\n\n      Therefore, the sample query should be \"3 2\", not \"2 2\". \n\n      However, the sample input says \"2 2\". \n\n      This is a known issue? \n\n      Looking at the sample output: \n          The answer is 29.\n\n      How do we get 29 for [1,2,2,4,5]?\n\n        base = 15\n        adjacent pairs:\n          (1,2): different -> 1 * (5-1-1)=3\n          (2,2): same -> 0\n          (2,4): different -> 3 * (5-3-1)=3*1=3\n          (4,5): different -> 4 * (5-4-1)=0 -> total = 15+3+3 = 21 -> not 29.\n\n      The sample breaks down the subarrays and counts the awesomeness for each:\n\n        [1;1]:1 -> 1\n        [1;2]:2 -> 2\n        [1;3]:2 -> 2\n        [1;4]:3 -> 3\n        [1;5]:4 -> 4\n        [2;2]:1 -> 1\n        [2;3]:1 -> 1\n        [2;4]:2 -> 2\n        [2;5]:3 -> 3\n        [3;3]:1 -> 1\n        [3;4]:2 -> 2\n        [3;5]:3 -> 3\n        [4;4]:1 -> 1\n        [4;5]:2 -> 2\n        [5;5]:1 -> 1\n\n        Sum = 1+2+2+3+4+1+1+2+3+1+2+3+1+2+1 = 29.\n\n      How is the awesomeness computed for [1,2,2,4,5]?\n\n        The formula: for a subarray, the awesomeness = 1 + (# of indices j in [l, r-1] such that a[j]!=a[j+1])\n\n        [1,2,2,4,5]: \n          [1;1]: 1 -> 1\n          [1;2]: [1,2] -> 1 (at index0: 1!=2) -> 1+1 = 2\n          [1;3]: [1,2,2] -> only at index0: 1!=2 -> 1+1=2\n          [1;4]: [1,2,2,4] -> at index0: 1!=2, index2: 2!=4 -> 1+2=3\n          [1;5]: [1,2,2,4,5] -> at index0: 1!=2, index2:2!=4, index3:4!=5 -> 1+3=4\n          [2;2]: 1\n          [2;3]: [2,2] -> no adjacent difference -> 1\n          [2;4]: [2,2,4] -> at index1:2!=4? -> 1+1=2\n          [2;5]: [2,2,4,5] -> at index1:2!=4, index3:4!=5 -> 1+2=3\n          [3;3]:1\n          [3;4]: [2,4] -> 1+1=2\n          [3;5]: [2,4,5] -> 1+2=3\n          [4;4]:1\n          [4;5]: [4,5] -> 1+1=2\n          [5;5]:1\n\n        Total = 29.\n\n      How to compute this with our formula?\n\n        Total = base (which is the number of subarrays) + for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) that is different, we add the number of subarrays that include that pair.\n\n        The adjacent pairs that are different in [1,2,2,4,5]:\n          index0: 1 and 2 -> different -> the number of subarrays that include this pair: \n                starting index: 0 to 0 (1 choice), ending index: 1 to 4 (4 choices) -> 1*4 = 4.\n          index1: 2 and 2 -> same -> 0.\n          index2: 2 and 4 -> different -> starting index: 0 to 2 (3 choices), ending index: 3 to 4 (2 choices) -> 3*2=6.\n          index3: 4 and 5 -> different -> starting index: 0 to 3 (4 choices), ending index: 4 to 4 (1 choice) -> 4*1=4.\n\n        Total = 15 (base) + 4 + 6 + 4 = 29.\n\n        So the formula for a pair at index i (0-indexed) is: (i+1) * (n-i-1) for the pair (i, i+1). \n          i=0: 1 * (5-1) = 1*4 = 4.\n          i=1: skip (same)\n          i=2: 3 * (5-3) = 3*2 = 6.\n          i=3: 4 * (5-4) = 4*1 = 4.\n\n        Therefore, the formula is: for a pair at index i (0-indexed) that is different, we add (i+1) * (n-i-1).\n\n        But note: the update_awesomeness function for the right_edit at index i (when updating the element at index i) uses (i+1) * (n-i-1) for the pair (i, i+1). And for the left_edit (the pair (i-1, i)) uses i * (n-i).\n\n        So the initial computation for the entire array should be:\n\n          aws = (n*(n+1))//2\n          for i in range(n-1):\n              if arr[i] != arr[i+1]:\n                  aws += (i+1) * (n-i-1)\n\n        Then for the initial array [1,2,3,4,5] we had:\n\n          base = 15\n          i=0: 1 and 2 -> different -> 1*4 = 4\n          i=1: 2 and 3 -> different -> 2*3 = 6\n          i=2: 3 and 4 -> different -> 3*2 = 6\n          i=3: 4 and 5 -> different -> 4*1 = 4\n          total = 15+4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n        Then the first query: update index2 (0-indexed index=2) from 3 to 2. \n\n        The update_awesomeness function:\n\n          We are updating index2 (i=2) from 3 to 2.\n\n          left_edit: \n             (new: 2 != arr[1] (which is 2)) -> false -> 0.\n             (old: 3 != arr[1] (2)) -> true -> 1.\n             so left_edit = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\n          right_edit:\n             (new: 2 != arr[3] (4)) -> true -> 1.\n             (old: 3 != arr[3] (4)) -> true -> 1.\n             so right_edit = 1-1 = 0.\n\n          Then the change: \n             left_edit * i * (n-i) = -1 * 2 * (5-2) = -1 * 2*3 = -6.\n             right_edit * (i+1) * (n-i-1) = 0.\n\n          So aws becomes 35 - 6 = 29.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the initial array [1,2,3,4,5] has awesomeness 35, and after updating index2 to 2, it becomes 29.\n\n        So the sample input query is \"3 2\" (because index2 is the third element) -> so the input should be \"3 2\", not \"2 2\". \n\n        But the problem says: \"each line contains two integers i and x (1<=i<=n)\". So the first element is i=1, the second i=2, the third i=3.\n\n        Therefore, the sample input is \"3 2\", meaning update the third element (index2) to 2.\n\n        However, the problem statement says: \"the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\" and the input is \"2 2\". \n\n        This is a discrepancy. But the problem says the input is \"2 2\", so we must use that. \n\n        But note: the update_awesomeness function uses index i-1. So if the input is \"2 2\", then we update index1 (the second element). \n\n        Then the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5] -> update index1 (which is 2) to 2 -> no change. Then the awesomeness remains 35. \n\n        But the sample output is 29.\n\n        Therefore, the sample input must be \"3 2\", not \"2 2\". \n\n        Since the problem statement says \"2 2\", it might be a typo. We'll assume the problem meant to update the third element. \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". We are not to change the update_awesomeness function. \n\n        So we proceed.\n\n  Conclusion for program1.py: \n      We use the for-loop to initialize the array from zeros to the initial array by calling update_awesomeness for each element.\n\n      The missing code is:\n\n          for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n              aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the update_awesomeness function updates the array `tar` and the awesomeness. We start with `tar` as [0]*n and `aws` as (n*(n+1))//2.\n\n  This will build the initial array and compute the initial awesomeness.\n\n  Then we process the queries.\n\n  Now, for program2.py:\n\n  We are to compute, for each vertex i (from 1 to n) in a tree of n (odd) vertices, the number of trees (with the given property: a tree in which for each vertex i from 2 to n, it is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index) such that vertex i is the centroid.\n\n  The trees are rooted at 1? Actually, the condition: for each i from 2 to n, adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index -> this is a tree and it is rooted at 1. The tree is built by attaching each vertex i (from 2 to n) to one vertex j with j<i. This is a recursive tree (like a labeled tree with root 1 and then each node has an arbitrary number of children). The total number of such trees is (n-1)!? \n\n  Actually, the number of such trees: \n      vertex 1: root.\n      vertex 2: must attach to 1 -> 1 way.\n      vertex 3: can attach to 1 or 2 -> 2 ways.\n      vertex 4: can attach to 1,2, or 3 -> 3 ways.\n      ... so total = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (n-1) = (n-1)!.\n\n  Now, a vertex is a centroid if when removed, every connected component has size <= (n-1)/2.\n\n  We are to compute for each vertex i, the number of trees (among the (n-1)! trees) for which i is the centroid.\n\n  The provided code:\n\n      MOD = 998244353\n\n      ... factorial and inverse factorial precomputation ...\n\n      n = int(input())\n\n      out = [0] * n\n\n      for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n          base = fact[n - 1]\n          frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n          out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n      rem = 0\n      for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n          oldrem = rem\n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n          out[i] -= oldrem\n          rem %= MOD\n          out[i] %= MOD\n\n      print(' '.join(map(str,out)))\n\n  We are missing the function `inv(x)`.\n\n  We need a modular inverse. Since MOD is prime, we can use Fermat's little theorem: \n\n      inv(x) = pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n  But note: the function `inv` is called with an argument that might be 0? We must avoid that.\n\n  However, the factorials are computed for numbers up to MAX-1 (which is 10**6-1) and then we compute the inverse factorial. The function `inv` is called in the precomputation for the factorial array. Specifically:\n\n      invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1])\n\n  So we need to compute the inverse of fact[MAX-1] modulo MOD.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      def inv(x):\n          return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n  But note: the problem says the answer can be huge, modulo 998244353.\n\n  However, the function `pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)` is efficient.\n\n  But note: the function `inv` is called only for the factorial at MAX-1? Actually, the precomputation of `invfact` uses:\n\n      invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1])\n      then for i from MAX-2 down to 0: \n          invfact[i] = modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1])\n\n  So we only need one call to `inv` for the last factorial.\n\n  Alternatively, we could compute the entire invfact array with a loop from the end using the recurrence: \n      invfact[i] = invfact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD   -> but that is not the recurrence. \n\n  Actually, the recurrence is:\n\n      fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i\n      so invfact[i] = 1/(i!) mod MOD.\n\n      Then: \n          invfact[i] = invfact[i+1] * (i+1)   -> because (i+1)! = (i+1) * i! -> so 1/(i!) = (i+1) * 1/( (i+1)! )\n\n      So: invfact[i] = (i+1) * invfact[i+1] mod MOD.\n\n  But the code does:\n\n      invfact[MAX-1] = inv(fact[MAX-1])\n      for i in range(MAX-2, -1, -1):\n          invfact[i] = modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1])\n\n  This matches: invfact[i] = (i+1) * invfact[i+1] mod MOD.\n\n  Therefore, the function `inv` is only called once for the last factorial. We can implement it with pow.\n\n  So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      def inv(x):\n          return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n  But note: what if x is 0? But the factorial at MAX-1 is not zero. And MOD is prime.\n\n  Therefore, we write:\n\n      def inv(x):\n          return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n  We are to output the missing code for both programs in a JSON format.\n\n  Summary:\n\n  For program1.py: the missing code is a block that initializes the array and the awesomeness by updating each element from the initial array. We use the provided update_awesomeness function.\n\n      \"program1\": \"for i, x in enumerate(arr):\\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\"\n\n  For program2.py: the missing code is the function `inv`.\n\n      \"program2\": \"def inv(x):\\n    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\n  But note: the JSON format requires escaping newlines? Actually, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We output the string exactly as the code.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\n  We must output the code as a string that can be inserted into the program.\n\n  For program1.py, the existing code has:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with two lines: \n\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  But note: the indentation. The existing code has 4 spaces per indent. We must match.\n\n  So the string for program1 is:\n\n      \"for i, x in enumerate(arr):\\n        aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\"\n\n  But wait, the existing for-loop is already written. We are only to fill the body. So the missing block is the body of the loop. However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the body of the loop.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output the entire for-loop? But the for-loop is already there. We only need the body.\n\n  The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We output the body.\n\n  But the body is one line? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So for program1, the missing code is the body of the for-loop.\n\n  But the existing code has:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO line with:\n\n          aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\n\n  So the missing code for program1 is:\n\n      \"aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\"\n\n  But note: the indentation. We must have 8 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the for-loop body is indented by 4 more. The existing line is a comment that is indented by 8 spaces. We replace that with the same indentation.\n\n  However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation. But the existing code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program1 is one line: \n\n      \"    aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\"\n\n  But wait, the existing code has:\n\n      for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The body is currently a comment. We replace the comment with the code. The comment is at one level of indentation (4 spaces). So we write:\n\n      \"    aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\"\n\n  But note: the original code has 4 spaces for the first indent. So the body should be 8 spaces? Actually, the for-loop is at 4 spaces, and the body is 8 spaces. The existing comment is at 8 spaces.\n\n  Alternatively, we can output the entire for-loop? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and the for-loop is already present.\n\n  We decide to output only the body.\n\n  For program2, the missing code is the body of the function `inv`. The existing code:\n\n      def inv(x):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n          return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\n\n  So the missing code for program2 is:\n\n      \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n\n  But note: the function might be called with x=0? But the factorials are nonzero. However, to be safe, we should avoid x=0. But the problem says n>=3 and we are computing factorials for numbers up to 10**6, which is less than MOD (998244353). So the factorials are nonzero mod MOD.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"    aws = update_awesomeness(tar, i, x, aws)\",\n        \"program2\": \"    return pow(x, MOD-2, MOD)\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". For program1, the missing code is the body of the for-loop (one line). For program2, the missing code is the body of the function (one line).\n\n  However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We output the exact string that replaces the TODO.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n  We output the JSON.\n\n  Important: the JSON string must be valid. We must escape any double quotes, but we don't have any. And the newlines: we are using \\n in the string? For program1, we are only outputting one line. For program2, one line.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer."
