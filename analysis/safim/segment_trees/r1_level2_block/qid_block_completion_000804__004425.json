How many doublings? \n                  Let c = number of doublings. Then m0 * (2^c) >= n -> so c = ceil(log2(n/m0)) Then total = (n-m0) + c.\n\n                But note: \n                  Example: n=6, m0=2 -> \n                    c: \n                      step0: 2<6 -> double: 4, ans=4+1=5 -> then 4<6 -> double: 8, ans=5+1=6 -> c=2. total= (6-2)+2 = 6. But the formula ceil(n/m0)-1: \n                  ceil(6/2)-1 = ceil(3)-1 = 3-1=2 -> then total = (6-2)+2=6. Another: n=3, m0=1 -> \n                  ceil(3/1)-1 = 3-1=2 -> total= (3-1)+2=4. The doubling: \n                    ans=3-1=2\n                    while: 1<3 -> double:2, ans=3 -> then 2<3 -> double:4, ans=4 -> so 4.\n\n                But note: the formula ceil(n/m0)-1 is 2, and then total= (3-1)+2=4. However, is there a direct relation: \n                  ceil(n/m0) - 1 = the minimal c such that (c+1)*m0>=n. But the doubling method: \n                  We double m0 until m0>=n. The number of doublings is the minimal c such that m0 * (2^c) >= n.\n\n                And note: \n                  (2^c) * m0 >= n   -> then c >= log2(n/m0) -> so c = ceil(log2(n/m0)) And we have: \n                  ceil(n/m0) <= 2^c? Not necessarily. Example: n=5, m0=2 -> \n                  ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3 -> then clones=3-1=2, total= (5-2)+2=5. Doubling: \n                    ans=3\n                    step1: m0=4 -> ans=4 -> then 4<5? -> step2: m0=8 -> ans=5 -> so 5.\n\n                But note: the minimal c for the reservoir method: We require (c+1)*m0>=n -> (c+1)*2>=5 -> c+1>=3 -> c>=2 -> so 2 clones. And the doubling method: \n                  We double until m0>=n: \n                    start: 2 -> then double to 4 (c=1) -> 4<5 -> double to 8 (c=2) -> then 8>=5 -> so 2 doublings. So both give 2 clones. But the total operations: \n                  Reservoir: 2 clones + 3 swaps = 5.\n                  Doubling: 3 (initial swaps) + 2 (clones) = 5. Therefore, the known solution in the code is:\n\n                  ans = n - m   # the number of swaps we must do\n                  while m < n:\n                      m *= 2\n                      ans += 1\n\n                This matches. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          m *= 2\n          ans += 1\n\n        But note: we must update m and then the condition is checked. The while loop condition is m<n, so we break when m>=n.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code for the candy eating problem. The provided code uses two pointers (l and h) and two sums (a and b). The idea is to have Alice eating from the left and Bob from the right, and we are trying to balance the total weights they have eaten. When the weights are equal, we record the total number of candies eaten (which is l + (n-1 - h) because l is the next candy for Alice and h is the next candy for Bob, but note that the candies from 0 to l-1 have been eaten by Alice and from h+1 to n-1 by Bob).\n\nThe provided code has a while loop that runs while l<=h. Inside, if a (Alice's sum) is greater than b (Bob's sum), then we add the candy at h to Bob and move h left. Otherwise, we are to do something. The TODO is in the else block.\n\nWe note that when a<=b, we should add a candy to Alice (from the left). Also, we check if a becomes equal to b, then we update the answer (ans) to the total candies eaten so far (l + (n-1 - h)).\n\nHowever, note that the current code does not update the left pointer in the else block. We must complete the else block to add the current left candy to Alice and move the left pointer.\n\nAlso, note that the condition for updating the answer is inside the loop and after we have adjusted the sums. But we must update the answer only when a==b.\n\nBut there is a catch: the current code does not have an update for the left pointer in the else block. So we must add that.\n\nLet me complete the else block:\n    else:\n        a = a + l1[l]\n        l = l + 1\n\nBut note: the condition for updating the answer is after the if-else. So after we update either a or b, we check if a==b and then set ans = l + (n-1 - h). However, note that the problem asks for the maximum total candies. We are updating ans every time a==b, and the last time they are equal might not be the maximum? Actually, we are traversing the array and we want the maximum total candies. But note that the two pointers are moving and we are updating ans whenever we get an equality. Since we are moving from the ends inward, the total candies eaten (l + (n-1-h)) is increasing? Actually, no: as we move, l increases and h decreases, so the total candies (l + (n-1-h)) is increasing? Actually, the total candies eaten is l (from the left) and (n-1 - h) from the right. When we add a candy to the left, l increases by one and the total becomes (l) + (n-1-h). Similarly, when we add to the right, h decreases by one and the total becomes l + (n-1 - (h-1))? Actually, when we add to the right, we do h = h-1, so the number of candies Bob has eaten is (n-1 - h) because the next available candy for Bob is at h (which hasn't been eaten). So the total eaten is l (from the left) and (n-1 - h) from the right? Actually, the candies eaten by Alice are from index 0 to l-1 (so l candies) and by Bob from index h+1 to n-1 (so n-1 - h candies). Therefore, the total is l + (n-1 - h). But note: when we update, we first add the candy and then move the pointer. So when we add a candy to Alice at index l, then we do l = l+1. Then the total becomes l (because now l is the next, so we have eaten l candies) and Bob has eaten n-1 - h candies. Similarly for Bob.\n\nBut note: the condition a==b might occur multiple times and we want the maximum total candies. However, the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". So we should take the maximum over all equalities. The current code sets ans to the current total whenever a==b. But if we get a later equality with more candies, we update. However, the way the pointers move, the total candies (l + (n-1-h)) is not monotonic? Actually, as we move the pointers, l increases and h decreases, so the total candies (l + (n-1-h)) is increasing? Let me see: initially, l=0, h=n-1, total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 0. Then we add one candy: either l becomes 1 and then total = 1 + (n-1 - (n-1)) = 1, or h becomes n-2 and then total = 0 + (n-1 - (n-2)) = 1. Then next step: if we add two more, total becomes 2, then 3, etc. So the total is increasing. But note: when we have a==b, we record the total. However, we might have a situation where we have an equality at total=2 and then later at total=4, so we want the maximum. But the code updates ans every time we have an equality. So the last equality might not be the maximum? Actually, the total is increasing: because we are always adding one candy per iteration (either left or right). So the total candies eaten (l + (n-1-h)) is increasing by one each time. Therefore, the last time we have an equality will be the maximum total. But note: we might have multiple equalities and we want the maximum total. However, because the total is increasing, the last equality we encounter will have the highest total. So we can update ans every time we have an equality and then at the end, we print ans. But what if we never have an equality? Then ans remains 0? That matches the third test case.\n\nBut wait: the fourth test case: \nInput: [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10]\nThe note says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (total 30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (total 30). So total candies eaten is 3+4=7. How does the algorithm work?\nWe start: l=0, h=8, a=0, b=0 -> else: add l1[0]=7 -> a=7, l=1 -> then a!=b -> then if a(7)>b(0): no, so else: add l1[1]=3 -> a=10, l=2 -> then a(10)>b(0): so add b: b=10 (from h=8: l1[8]=10), h=7 -> now a=10, b=10 -> set ans = l (which is 2) + (n-1 - h) = 2 + (8-7) = 2+1=3? That's not 7.\n\nSo we see that the algorithm as described does not work for the fourth test case. Therefore, we must reconsider.\n\nActually, the problem is that the algorithm is greedy: it always adds to the smaller side. But note: the problem allows Alice to eat any contiguous segment from the left (but not necessarily adjacent in the eating order? Actually, the problem says: Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (in a row). Similarly for Bob. And they cannot overlap.\n\nThe intended solution is to use two pointers. We start with Alice taking nothing and Bob taking nothing. Then we can have:\n- If the current sum of Alice is less than Bob, then we add one more from the left to Alice.\n- If the current sum of Alice is greater than Bob, then we add one more from the right to Bob.\n- If they are equal, we record the total candies (l + (n-1-h)) and then we add one more from the left? But note: we want to maximize the total. However, we can also try to continue.\n\nBut the above greedy does not necessarily get the maximum because we might have multiple segments that are equal. The problem is that we are not allowed to skip candies: they must eat contiguous segments from the ends. So the only possibility is that Alice eats a prefix and Bob eats a suffix, and the two segments do not overlap.\n\nThe known solution for this problem is to use two pointers and a greedy approach:\n\n  l = 0\n  r = n-1\n  sum1 = 0\n  sum2 = 0\n  ans = 0\n  while l <= r:\n      if sum1 <= sum2:\n          sum1 += arr[l]\n          l += 1\n      else:\n          sum2 += arr[r]\n          r -= 1\n      if sum1 == sum2:\n          ans = l + (n-1 - r)   # because Alice has eaten [0, l-1] (l candies) and Bob has eaten [r+1, n-1] (n-1 - r candies)\n\n  print(ans)\n\nBut note: the above greedy does not necessarily maximize the total? Actually, we are traversing the entire array and we record every time the sums are equal. And because we are moving the pointers until they meet, we will record every equality. And since the total candies (l + (n-1 - r)) is increasing as we move the pointers (because we add one candy per step), the last equality we get would be the one with the maximum total? But wait: when we have an equality, we record the current total. Then we continue. And we might get a larger total later? Actually, the total candies is increasing: we start with 0 and then we add one candy per step until we have l>r. So the total candies eaten is increasing. Therefore, the last equality we get would have the maximum total.\n\nBut let's test with the fourth test case: \nn=9, arr = [7, 3, 20, 5, 15, 1, 11, 8, 10]\n\nWe want to achieve 7 candies: Alice: [7,3,20] (index0,1,2) -> 30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] (index8,7,6,5) -> 30.\n\nIn the algorithm:\n\nl=0, r=8, sum1=0, sum2=0 -> sum1<=sum2 -> add arr[0]=7 -> sum1=7, l=1 -> not equal.\nl=1, r=8: sum1=7, sum2=0 -> sum1>sum2 -> add arr[8]=10 to sum2 -> sum2=10, r=7 -> not equal.\nl=1, r=7: sum1=7, sum2=10 -> sum1<=sum2 -> add arr[1]=3 -> sum1=10, l=2 -> now equal: ans = l + (n-1 - r) = 2 + (8-1 - 7) = 2 + (0) = 2? (because r is now 7, so n-1=8, then 8-7=1 -> but wait: the candies Bob has eaten are from index 8 (only one candy). So total = 2 (Alice: two candies) + 1 (Bob: one candy) = 3? But we want 7.\n\nSo the above greedy does not work for the fourth test case.\n\nWe must note: the problem does not require that they eat in alternation. They can eat arbitrarily: Alice eats a contiguous segment from the left, Bob from the right. But the key is that they cannot eat the same candy. The known solution for this problem is:\n\n  t = int(input().strip())\n  for _ in range(t):\n      n = int(input().strip())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      left = 0\n      right = n-1\n      sum_left = 0\n      sum_right = 0\n      total = 0\n      count_left = 0\n      count_right = 0\n      ans = 0\n      while left <= right:\n          if sum_left < sum_right:\n              sum_left += arr[left]\n              left += 1\n              count_left += 1\n          else:\n              sum_right += arr[right]\n              right -= 1\n              count_right += 1\n          if sum_left == sum_right:\n              ans = count_left + count_right\n      print(ans)\n\nBut wait, let me test with the fourth test case:\n\narr = [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10]\n\nInitialize: left=0, right=8, sum_left=0, sum_right=0, count_left=0, count_right=0, ans=0.\n\nStep1: sum_left==sum_right -> else (since we go to else when not less? Actually, if equal we go to else). So we add arr[8]=10 to sum_right, right=7, count_right=1 -> now (0,10) -> not equal.\nStep2: sum_left=0 < 10 -> add arr[0]=7 -> left=1, count_left=1 -> (7,10) -> not equal.\nStep3: 7<10 -> add arr[1]=3 -> left=2, count_left=2 -> (10,10) -> equal: ans=2+1=3.\nStep4: then we continue? because left=2<=right=7 -> now 10==10 -> we go to else: add arr[7]=8 -> sum_right=18, right=6, count_right=2 -> (10,18) -> not equal.\nStep5: 10<18 -> add arr[2]=20 -> left=3, count_left=3 -> (30,18) -> not equal.\nStep6: 30>18 -> add arr[6]=11 -> sum_right=29, right=5, count_right=3 -> (30,29) -> not equal.\nStep7: 30>29 -> add arr[5]=1 -> sum_right=30, right=4, count_right=4 -> (30,30) -> equal: ans=3+4=7.\n\nThen we break when left>right? Now left=3, right=4 -> still left<=right -> then we continue: \nStep8: 30==30 -> else: add arr[4]=15 to sum_right? -> then sum_right=45, right=3, count_right=5 -> then left=3, right=3 -> then we check: 30<45 -> add arr[3]=5 -> left=4, count_left=4 -> (35,45) -> then left=4, right=3 -> break.\n\nSo we get ans=7 at step7. So it works.\n\nBut note: the above algorithm updates the counts separately. However, the provided code in program1.py does not have separate counts for left and right. It uses l and h and then the total is l + (n-1 - h). But wait: in the provided code, the total when a==b is set to l + (n-1 - h). But note: the candies that have been eaten by Alice are from 0 to l-1 (so l candies) and by Bob from h+1 to n-1 (so n-1 - h candies). However, in the above known solution, we are counting the candies as we add. The known solution uses count_left and count_right and then sets ans = count_left+count_right.\n\nBut in the provided code, we have:\n  a: for Alice (the left sum)\n  b: for Bob (the right sum)\n  l: the next available index for Alice (so the candies eaten by Alice are from 0 to l-1 -> count = l)\n  h: the next available index for Bob (so the candies eaten by Bob are from h+1 to n-1 -> count = n-1 - h)\n\nTherefore, the total candies eaten is l + (n-1 - h).\n\nBut in the known solution, we break the array at two pointers that move independently. The known solution does not use the formula with n-1-h. Instead, it maintains count_left and count_right. However, we can adapt the provided code to use the same idea as the known solution.\n\nBut note: the provided code already has:\n  while(l<=h):\n      if(a>b):\n          b = b + l1[h]\n          h = h-1\n      else:\n          # TODO: we need to add to a from the left\n\n      if(a==b):\n          ans = l + (n-1 - h)\n\nBut the known solution does not break after an equality, it continues. And we update ans every time we have an equality. Since the total candies (l + (n-1-h)) is increasing (because we are moving the pointers inward one step per iteration), the last equality we get will be the maximum.\n\nSo we can complete the else block as:\n      else:\n          a = a + l1[l]\n          l = l+1\n\nBut then we must also consider the case when a==b? Actually, the condition is checked after updating.\n\nBut let me test the provided code with the fourth test case:\n\nn=9, l1 = [7,3,20,5,15,1,11,8,10]\n\nInitialize: l=0, h=8, a=0, b=0, ans=0.\n\nIteration1: a<=b -> else: a = 0+7=7, l=1 -> then check: a(7) != b(0) -> no update.\nIteration2: a(7)>b(0) -> then b=0+10=10, h=7 -> then check: 7!=10 -> no.\nIteration3: a(7)<=b(10) -> else: a=7+3=10, l=2 -> then check: a(10)==b(10) -> ans = l (2) + (n-1 - h) = 2 + (8-1 - 7) = 2 + (0) = 2? -> but we want 7.\n\nSo we see that we get 2 at this point. Then we continue:\n\nIteration4: l=2, h=7 -> a(10)<=b(10) -> else: a=10+20=30, l=3 -> then a(30) != b(10) -> no.\nIteration5: a(30)>b(10) -> then b=10+8=18, h=6 -> no.\nIteration6: a(30)>b(18) -> then b=18+11=29, h=5 -> no.\nIteration7: a(30)>b(29) -> then b=29+1=30, h=4 -> then a(30)==b(30) -> ans = l(3) + (n-1 - h) = 3 + (8-1-4)=3+3=6? -> but we want 7.\n\nSo we get 6, not 7.\n\nWhat's the issue? The known solution had 7 because it counted 3 for Alice and 4 for Bob. In our code, at the last equality:\n  Alice has eaten l=3 candies (indices0,1,2) -> 3 candies.\n  Bob has eaten from h=4 to the end? Actually, Bob has eaten the candies from index h+1 to n-1, which are indices 5,6,7,8? But wait: we have h=4, so Bob has eaten from index 5 to 8? That's 4 candies. So total = 3+4=7.\n\nBut in the code: \n  ans = l + (n-1 - h) \n  l=3, n-1=8, h=4 -> 8-4 = 4 -> 3+4=7.\n\nBut in iteration7, after updating Bob: h becomes 4 (from 5) and then we set ans=3+ (8-4)=7.\n\nBut in the code above, after iteration7 we set h=4? Then we check a==b: 30==30 -> set ans=7.\n\nBut in the code we have:\n\n  while(l<=h):\n      if(a>b):\n          b = b + l1[h]\n          h = h-1\n      else:\n          a = a + l1[l]\n          l = l+1\n      if(a==b):\n          ans = l + (n-1 - h)\n\nSo in iteration7: \n  We start with l=3, h=5, a=30, b=29 -> then we do the if: a(30)>b(29) -> so we do b=29+1=30, and then h=5-1=4.\n  Then we check: a==b -> 30==30 -> set ans = l (which is 3) + (n-1 - h) = 3 + (8-4)=7.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut why did I get 6 in my previous calculation? Because I thought l was 3 and h was 4, but note: after we update h to 4, we then check. So the state is: l=3, h=4 -> then the total is 3 (from Alice: indices0,1,2) and Bob: from index5 to 8? But wait: Bob has eaten the candies at indices 5,6,7,8? But we have updated h to 4, meaning the next available candy for Bob is at index4 (which hasn't been eaten). So Bob has eaten the candies from index5 to 8 (because we started at index8 and then 7,6,5, and then we just ate index5? Actually, we added the candy at index5 (which is the candy with weight 1) and then set h=4. So Bob has eaten indices 5,6,7,8 -> 4 candies. And Alice has eaten indices0,1,2 -> 3 candies. Total 7.\n\nTherefore, the code for program1.py should be:\n\n  else:\n      a = a + l1[l]\n      l = l+1\n\nBut note: the condition in the if is \"if(a>b)\" and the else is for when a<=b. This matches the known solution (which uses if sum_left<sum_right then add left, else add right). But note: when a==b, we go to the else and add to the left. That is acceptable because we can add to either side.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is two lines: \n      a = a + l1[l]\n      l = l+1\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so the while loop runs at most n per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: minimal operations to get a copy of the array with all elements equal.\n\nWe are allowed to:\n  - Clone an array (any existing one) -> one operation.\n  - Swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions -> one operation.\n\nWe start with one copy.\n\nWe need to find the minimal operations to get one copy that has all elements equal.\n\nNote: we can do multiple swaps and multiple clones.\n\nThe known solution: \n  If the array is already all equal, then 0 operations.\n  Otherwise, we can think: \n      We need to have one copy that has all elements equal. We can use the following strategy:\n        - We can use swaps to gather all occurrences of a particular element in one array. \n        - How many operations? \n\n  Insight: \n      Let the frequency of the most frequent element be m. Then we have n-m elements that are not that element.\n      We can do:\n        Operation 1: clone the array. Now we have two copies.\n        Then we can swap one occurrence of the frequent element from the clone to the original to replace a non-frequent element? \n        But note: we can swap arbitrarily.\n\n      Actually, we can do:\n        Step1: clone the array. Now we have two copies: A and B.\n        Step2: swap an element in A that we want to keep (say the frequent element) with an element in B that we want to remove (a non-frequent element). Then in A, we have one more frequent element, and in B we have one less.\n\n      But note: we are allowed to swap any two elements from any two arrays at any positions.\n\n      We want to have one array that is all x (the frequent element). We can use the other arrays as temporary storage.\n\n      How many operations? \n        Each swap operation can fix one element: \n          For example, if we have an array A that we want to turn into all x, then for each position that is not x, we can swap it with an x from another array. But we need to have an x available in another array.\n\n      However, we can also create more clones to have more x's available.\n\n      The known solution from the note: \n          In the second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 (for 0 and 3). Actually, the most frequent element is 3? But wait: \n              0:2, 1:1, 3:2, 7:1 -> m=2.\n\n          The example used 6 operations. How?\n\n          Step1: clone -> 1 operation, now two copies: A=[0,1,3,3,7,0], B=[0,1,3,3,7,0]\n          Step2: swap the element at position1 in A (which is 1) with the element at position0 in B (which is 0) -> then A becomes [0,0,3,3,7,0], B becomes [1,1,3,3,7,0] -> 1 swap\n          Step3: swap the element at position2 in A (which is 3) with the element at position5 in B (which is 0) -> then A becomes [0,0,0,3,7,0], B becomes [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> 2 swaps\n          Step4: clone A -> 1 operation, now three copies: A, B, C (which is [0,0,0,3,7,0])\n          Step5: swap the element at position3 in A (which is 3) with the element at position3 in C (which is 3) -> but that doesn't help? \n          Actually, the example did:\n            [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n            Then swap: in the first two copies: swap the 3 and 7 in the first two copies with zeros from the same copies? \n            Specifically: \n              Swap the 3 at position3 in the first copy with a 0 at position0 in the second copy? \n            Then first copy: [0,0,0,0,7,0] -> but we want all zeros? \n            Then swap the 7 at position4 in the first copy with a 0 at position1 in the second copy? \n            Then first copy: [0,0,0,0,0,0] -> done.\n\n          So two more swaps: total swaps=4, and clones=2, total operations=2+4=6.\n\n      How to generalize?\n\n      We note that we can use the following strategy:\n        Let m = max frequency of any element.\n        We want to have one array that is all x (the element with frequency m). \n        We start with one array. We can create clones and then swap non-x elements in the target array with x's from other arrays.\n\n        How many non-x's are in the target array? n - m.\n\n        But to fix one non-x, we need to swap it with an x from another array. However, we must have an x available in another array. But note: the other array might also have non-x's that we don't want to lose? \n\n        Actually, we can use the following greedy:\n          Step1: Clone the array until we have enough x's to cover the non-x's in the target? \n\n        How many x's do we have in total? Initially, we have m x's. Each clone operation gives us an additional array with m x's? But we can use the x's in the clones to swap into the target.\n\n        We need to fix k = n - m non-x's in the target.\n\n        How many x's are available in the other arrays? Initially, we have one array. Then we clone: \n          After 1 clone: we have 2 arrays -> total x's: 2*m.\n          After 2 clones: 3 arrays -> total x's: 3*m.\n\n        But note: we are going to use the x's from the clones to swap into the target. However, we cannot use an x from a clone more than once? Because when we swap, we remove that x from the clone and put a non-x in the clone. Then that clone loses one x.\n\n        Actually, we need to have at least k x's available in the other arrays to swap into the target. But the total x's in the entire system is m * (number of arrays). However, the target array already has m x's. The rest of the arrays have (number_of_arrays - 1) * m x's? But we need to have at least k x's in the non-target arrays? \n\n        Condition: (number_of_arrays - 1) * m >= k   [because we are going to take k x's from the non-target arrays]\n\n        But note: we can also swap non-x's from the non-target arrays? Actually, we don't care about the non-target arrays. We only care that we have k x's to put into the target. The non-target arrays can be in any state.\n\n        Therefore, the minimal number of clones (let c) must satisfy: c * m >= k   (because we have c clones, each with m x's, and we can take up to c*m x's from them). But note: we start with one array, so the total arrays is c+1. The non-target arrays are c arrays. So we require: c * m >= k.\n\n        Then the total operations: \n          Clone operations: c\n          Swap operations: k (because we need to fix k non-x's in the target: each swap fixes one non-x by bringing an x from a clone)\n\n          Total = c + k.\n\n        We want to minimize c + k, with c being the smallest integer such that c * m >= k.\n\n        So c = ceil(k / m) = ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(n/m - 1).\n\n        Then total operations = ceil((n-m)/m) + (n-m)\n\n        But note: we might not need to do all the swaps? Actually, we do one swap per non-x.\n\n        However, let me test with the example: \n          n=6, m=2, k=4.\n          c = ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2.\n          total operations = 2 + 4 = 6 -> matches.\n\n        Another example: the first test case: already all equal -> k=0, then c=ceil(0)=0, operations=0.\n\n        Third test case: the note says the third test case: [1,2,3] -> m=1, k=2. \n          c = ceil(2/1)=2, operations=2+2=4.\n\n        But is that minimal? \n          We want to get one array of [1,1,1] (if we choose 1) or [2,2,2] or [3,3,3]. \n          How?\n          Step1: clone -> now two arrays: A=[1,2,3], B=[1,2,3]\n          Step2: swap A[1] (2) with B[0] (1) -> A=[1,1,3], B=[2,2,3] -> 2 operations.\n          Step3: clone A -> now three arrays: A=[1,1,3], B=[2,2,3], C=[1,1,3] -> 3 operations.\n          Step4: swap A[2] (3) with C[0] (1) -> A=[1,1,1], ... -> 4 operations.\n\n          So 4 operations.\n\n        But wait: can we do it in 3? \n          Step1: clone -> 1 op -> two arrays.\n          Step2: swap A[0] and B[0] -> then A=[1,2,3] becomes [1,2,3]? same? \n          Actually, we can swap between the two arrays: \n            Swap A[0] and B[1]: \n              A: [2,2,3] -> not all equal.\n            Swap A[0] and B[2]: \n              A: [3,2,3] -> then we can swap A[1] and B[0] (which is now 1) -> A: [3,1,3] -> not equal.\n\n          It seems 4 is minimal.\n\n        However, the known solution in the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n          from collections import Counter\n          for li in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n              n=len(li:=li.split());\n              m = max(Counter(li).values())\n              ans =n-m\n              while(m<n):\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              print(ans)\n\n        And the note says: \n          while(m<n):\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n        How does the known solution work? \n\n        We see that initially, ans = n-m (which is k). Then we have a while loop: while m<n: ... \n\n        What is the known solution? \n          We can simulate the process:\n\n            We start with one array. We have k = n-m non-target elements to fix. \n            We can use clones to get more copies of the target element. \n\n            The process:\n              Step1: clone the array (which has m target elements) -> now we have two arrays, each with m target elements. \n                      Then we can swap one non-target element in the first array with a target element in the second array. \n                      Then the first array now has m+1 target elements? (because we replaced one non-target with a target) -> so m increases by one in the first array? \n                      But note: we are only concerned with the target array (the first one). \n\n            Actually, after one clone and one swap, we fix one non-target element. Then m becomes m+1 in the target array? \n\n            But note: the entire system: we have two arrays. The target array now has m+1 target elements. The other array has m-1 target elements (because we took one out) and one non-target element that we swapped in.\n\n            Then we can do again: \n              If we haven't fixed all, we can clone again? \n\n            However, we can also use the same clone again? Because the clone now has m-1 target elements. But we might not want to use it again if m-1 is too low.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              Let k = n - m (the number of non-target in the target array).\n              We are going to fix one non-target per available target element. But we start with m target elements in the target array and m target elements in the first clone. \n\n              How many swaps can we do? We can do up to m swaps from the first clone? But then the clone becomes depleted.\n\n              Then we need to clone again to get more target elements.\n\n            The known solution in code:\n\n              ans = n - m   # we start by setting ans to k, the number of non-targets\n              while m < n:\n                  m *= 2\n                  ans += 1\n\n            But wait: what does that do?\n\n            Example: n=6, m=2 (max frequency)\n              ans = 6-2 = 4.\n              while m(2)<6: \n                  m *= 2 -> m=4, ans=4+1=5\n                  then m=4<6 -> m=8, ans=5+1=6 -> break.\n\n            Then print(6) -> matches.\n\n            How about n=3, m=1 (for [1,2,3]):\n              ans = 3-1=2.\n              while m(1)<3: \n                  m=2, ans=3 -> then m(2)<3 -> m=4, ans=4 -> break.\n              Then print(4) -> matches.\n\n            How does it work?\n              The idea: \n                We start with the target array having m target elements. We need to fix k = n-m non-targets.\n                We can do:\n                  Operation1: clone -> now we have two arrays. The total available target elements is 2*m (because each array has m). But note: we can use the clone to fix up to m non-targets? \n                  Why? Because we can swap one non-target in the target array with one target element in the clone. Then we fix one non-target. But we can do this for up to m swaps (because the clone has m target elements). \n\n                So after one clone operation, we can fix up to m non-targets. Then the number of non-targets remaining is k - m. But note: we have already done one clone and m swaps? Actually, the clone operation is one op, and then we do one swap per fix. So we have done 1 + m operations? \n\n                But wait: the above while loop does: \n                  ans = k (which is the initial swaps we might have to do) and then we add 1 for each time we double m? \n\n                Actually, the process:\n\n                  Step0: We have one array. We have m target elements and k non-targets. We need to fix k non-targets. \n                  Step1: Clone -> cost 1. Now we have two arrays. The total available target elements is 2*m. But note: we can use the clone to fix min(m, k) non-targets? \n                  Then after min(m, k) swaps, we fix min(m,k) non-targets. Then the remaining non-targets is k - min(m,k) = max(0, k-m). \n\n                  But then we can use the fixed array? Actually, the target array now has m + min(m,k) target elements? \n\n                  However, the known solution does not update k? Instead, it doubles m and adds one operation (the clone) and then continues? \n\n                The insight: \n                  Each time we clone, we double the available target elements (because we have two arrays, each with the current m, so total 2*m). But note: we are not actually doubling the m in the target array? \n\n                Actually, after we clone and then swap, the target array gains one target element per swap. So after one clone and m swaps, the target array becomes all target? if k<=m? \n\n                But if k>m, then we fix m non-targets and then we have k-m non-targets left. Then we do:\n                  Step2: clone again -> now we have three arrays? But note: we can use the two clones (the first clone is now partially depleted: it has m - (number of swaps we did) target elements? Actually, we did m swaps from the first clone, so it has 0 target elements? Then we cannot use it. \n\n                Alternatively, we can use the second clone from the target array? \n\n                Actually, the known solution does not track the state per array. It uses the fact that after a clone, the available target elements in the system (across all arrays) doubles. Then we can use that to fix non-targets. \n\n                The minimal operations: \n                  We start with m0 = m (the frequency of the most common element).\n                  We need to cover k0 = n - m.\n\n                  Operation:\n                    We can do a clone (cost 1) and then we have 2*m0 target elements available. Then we can fix up to 2*m0 - m0 = m0 non-targets? (because the target array already had m0, and we are going to use the clone's m0 to fix m0 non-targets). \n\n                  Then after one clone and m0 swaps, we have fixed m0 non-targets. Then the remaining non-targets is k0 - m0.\n\n                  But note: the target array now has m0 + m0 = 2*m0 target elements? \n\n                  Then we can do again: \n                    Clone again (cost 1) -> then we have 2*(2*m0) = 4*m0 target elements available? \n                    Then we can fix up to 2*m0 non-targets? \n\n                  Actually, the available target elements in the system becomes 2 * (current m in the target array). But the current m in the target array is now 2*m0. Then we can fix up to 2*m0 non-targets? \n\n                  But the remaining non-targets is k0 - m0. So we fix min(2*m0, k0-m0).\n\n                  Then the total operations: \n                    clone operations: 2\n                    swap operations: m0 + min(2*m0, k0-m0)\n\n                  But the known solution does: \n                    ans = k0   (which is the total swaps we will do) \n                    and then we add one operation for each clone we do, which is the number of times we double m until m>=n.\n\n                  Specifically: \n                    while m < n:\n                        m *= 2\n                        ans += 1\n\n                  This is equivalent to: \n                    We are going to do a clone operation for each doubling until the available m (which becomes the total available target elements in the system) is at least n. Then we can fix all non-targets. \n\n                  Why? \n                    The doubling of m represents the total available target elements? But note: after one clone, the total available target elements becomes 2*m (because we have two arrays). Then we can fix up to m non-targets? But the known solution does not subtract from k? \n\n                  Actually, the known solution does not simulate the swaps per se. It uses the idea that we need to have enough target elements to cover the non-targets. The minimal number of clones is the minimal number of doublings so that m (the total available target elements) becomes at least n. Then the total operations is the initial swaps (which is n-m0, but note we are going to fix all n-m0 non-targets) plus the number of clones (which is the number of doublings).\n\n                  Why is that? \n                    Because each clone operation allows us to use the existing target elements in the entire system to cover the non-targets. But we don't need to account for the swaps individually because we are going to do one swap per non-target. And the initial ans is set to n-m (the number of swaps). Then each clone operation is an additional operation.\n\n                  However, the condition: we need to have enough target elements to cover the non-targets. The total target elements we have (across all arrays) must be at least the number of non-targets? Actually, no: we are going to fix one non-target by swapping with a target element. So we need at least (n-m) target elements in the non-target arrays? \n\n                  But note: the entire system starts with m0 target elements. After one clone, we have two arrays -> total target elements is 2*m0. Then we can fix up to 2*m0 - m0 = m0 non-targets? (because the target array must have n target elements eventually, so we need to put m0 more target elements into it, and we can take up to m0 from the other arrays). \n\n                  Then after one clone, we can fix m0 non-targets. Then we need to fix the remaining (n-m0) - m0 = n-2*m0 non-targets. \n\n                  Then we do another clone: now we have three arrays? Actually, we clone again: now we have three arrays. The total target elements is 3*m0? But wait, the first clone might have been depleted? \n\n                The known solution (doubling) is actually a greedy that uses the entire system of arrays as a reservoir of target elements. The reservoir starts at m0. Each clone operation doubles the reservoir (because we clone the entire array, so we get an additional m0 target elements? but note: we are allowed to clone any array, and we can choose to clone an array that has not been depleted). \n\n                Therefore, after c clones, we have (c+1) arrays, and the total target elements is (c+1)*m0. We need to have at least n target elements in the entire system? But we don't: we only need to have at least n-m0 (the non-targets) target elements available in the non-target arrays? \n\n                Actually, the target array must end up with n target elements. The entire system must have at least n target elements? But we start with m0 and then we create clones that also have m0. So the total is (c+1)*m0. We require (c+1)*m0 >= n? \n\n                Then the minimal c such that (c+1)*m0 >= n? \n                  c+1 >= ceil(n/m0)\n                  c >= ceil(n/m0) - 1.\n\n                Then the total operations: \n                  swaps: n - m0   (because we need to swap every non-target in the target array)\n                  clones: ceil(n/m0) - 1.\n\n                Then total = (n-m0) + (ceil(n/m0)-1)\n\n                But the known solution in the code:\n\n                  ans = n - m0\n                  while m0 < n:\n                      m0 *= 2\n                      ans += 1\n\n                This is equivalent to: \n                  We are doubling m0 until it becomes >= n. The number of doublings is the number of clones? \n\n                How many doublings? \n                  Let c = number of doublings. Then m0 * (2^c) >= n -> so c = ceil(log2(n/m0))\n\n                Then total = (n-m0) + c.\n\n                But note: \n                  Example: n=6, m0=2 -> \n                    c: \n                      step0: 2<6 -> double: 4, ans=4+1=5 -> then 4<6 -> double: 8, ans=5+1=6 -> c=2.\n                    total= (6-2)+2 = 6.\n\n                But the formula ceil(n/m0)-1: \n                  ceil(6/2)-1 = ceil(3)-1 = 3-1=2 -> then total = (6-2)+2=6.\n\n                Another: n=3, m0=1 -> \n                  ceil(3/1)-1 = 3-1=2 -> total= (3-1)+2=4.\n                  The doubling: \n                    ans=3-1=2\n                    while: 1<3 -> double:2, ans=3 -> then 2<3 -> double:4, ans=4 -> so 4.\n\n                But note: the formula ceil(n/m0)-1 is 2, and then total= (3-1)+2=4.\n\n                However, is there a direct relation: \n                  ceil(n/m0) - 1 = the minimal c such that (c+1)*m0>=n.\n\n                But the doubling method: \n                  We double m0 until m0>=n. The number of doublings is the minimal c such that m0 * (2^c) >= n.\n\n                And note: \n                  (2^c) * m0 >= n   -> then c >= log2(n/m0) -> so c = ceil(log2(n/m0))\n\n                And we have: \n                  ceil(n/m0) <= 2^c? Not necessarily.\n\n                Example: n=5, m0=2 -> \n                  ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3 -> then clones=3-1=2, total= (5-2)+2=5.\n                  Doubling: \n                    ans=3\n                    step1: m0=4 -> ans=4 -> then 4<5? -> step2: m0=8 -> ans=5 -> so 5.\n\n                But note: the minimal c for the reservoir method: \n                  We require (c+1)*m0>=n -> (c+1)*2>=5 -> c+1>=3 -> c>=2 -> so 2 clones.\n\n                And the doubling method: \n                  We double until m0>=n: \n                    start: 2 -> then double to 4 (c=1) -> 4<5 -> double to 8 (c=2) -> then 8>=5 -> so 2 doublings.\n\n                So both give 2 clones.\n\n                But the total operations: \n                  Reservoir: 2 clones + 3 swaps = 5.\n                  Doubling: 3 (initial swaps) + 2 (clones) = 5.\n\n                Therefore, the known solution in the code is:\n\n                  ans = n - m   # the number of swaps we must do\n                  while m < n:\n                      m *= 2\n                      ans += 1\n\n                This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n          m *= 2\n          ans += 1\n\n        But note: we must update m and then the condition is checked. The while loop condition is m<n, so we break when m>=n.\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the doubling might overshoot, but that is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is two lines:\n\n          m *= 2\n          ans += 1\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <=10^5, and the doubling will run at most O(log(n)) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nSummary:\n\n  For program1.py: \n      else:\n          a = a + l1[l]\n          l = l+1\n\n  For program2.py:\n      while(m<n):\n          m *= 2\n          ans += 1\n\nBut note: the code for program2.py already has the while loop condition, so we just put the two lines inside.\n\nHowever, the problem says: Output only the missing code in the specified format.\n\nWe output a JSON string: \n  {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\nBut note: the missing code in program1.py is two lines of code. We must write them exactly as they would appear.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is in the else block. We write:\n\n      a = a + l1[l]\n      l = l+1\n\nBut note: the indentation. The existing code has 4-space indentation.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing code is two lines:\n\n      m *= 2\n      ans += 1\n\nBut note: the while loop is already there, so we just put the two lines inside.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". So for program1.py, we output the two lines that go in the else block. For program2.py, we output the two lines that go in the while block.\n\nBut note: the TODO in program1.py is in the else block, and the TODO in program2.py is in the while block.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  For program1: \"        a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l+1\"\n  For program2: \"        m *= 2\\n        ans += 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in program1.py has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" in the else block. We replace that with the two lines. So we output the two lines at the same indentation level.\n\nIn program1.py, the else block currently has:\n\n        else:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO line with two lines of code, each indented by 8 spaces (relative to the while loop which is at 4). So we write each line with 8 spaces.\n\nBut the problem does not require the entire block, just the missing lines. So we output:\n\n  program1: \"a = a + l1[l]\\n    l = l+1\"\n\nWait, but the existing else block has the else: and then the comment. We are only replacing the comment. The two lines should be at the same indentation level as the code in the if block (which is 8 spaces). \n\nLooking at the if block in program1.py:\n\n        if(a>b):\n            b=b+l1[h]\n            h=h-1\n\nSo the two lines in the if block are indented by 8 spaces. Similarly, the two lines in the else block should be indented by 8 spaces.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program1: \"a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l+1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code uses l1 (with digit 1) and l (letter l). We must be cautious.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the while loop is:\n\n    while(m<n):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the TODO with two lines, each indented by 8 spaces. The existing code in the while loop is not shown, but we assume 4-space indentation for the while and then 8 for the body.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n  program2: \"m *= 2\\n        ans += 1\"\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output a JSON string:\n\n  {\"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l+1\", \"program2\": \"m *= 2\\n        ans += 1\"}\n\nBut wait: in program1.py, the variable is l1 (which is the list). We have l1[l]. And we use l (the pointer) to index.\n\nIn program2.py, we have m and ans.\n\nThis matches.\n\nLet me write the JSON string.\n\nNote: the JSON string must have double quotes. And we must escape any double quotes inside. But we don't have any.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\n  \"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l+1\",\n  \"program2\": \"m *= 2\\n        ans += 1\"\n}\n\nBut the problem says: Output only the missing code ... in the specified format.\n\nSo we output that as a string without the indentation? Actually, we output the JSON object as a string.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Return json with the following structure\", so we output a string that is a JSON object.\n\nTherefore, we write:\n\n{\"program1\": \"a = a + l1[l]\\n        l = l+1\", \"program2\": \"m *= 2\\n        ans += 1\"}\n\nBut note: the newlines in the string must be represented as \\n.\n\nThis is acceptable."
