Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" checks that i is not empty. So we can write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          However, the problem: what if the segment has both R and B? Then we skip. But note: the segment might be \"RBRB\" -> that's okay? because it has both R and B.\n\n          Example: \n            s = \"RBRB\" -> split by W: one segment \"RBRB\", which has both R and B -> okay.\n\n          Example: \n            s = \"RR\" -> segment \"RR\": \n                'R' in \"RR\" -> True, 'B' in \"RR\" -> False -> so condition: not (True and False) = not (False) = True -> then we set b=1. Example:\n            s = \"BB\" -> similarly. Example:\n            s = \"R\" -> segment \"R\": \n                not (True and False) = True -> set b=1. Example:\n            s = \"B\" -> similarly. Example:\n            s = \"RB\" -> segment \"RB\": \n                'R' in \"RB\" -> True, 'B' in \"RB\" -> True -> condition: not (True) = False -> skip. So it works. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the for loop is written without a body?",

The body of the if is two statements: \n            b = 1\n            break\n\n        So they should be at the same level. We write:\n\n            \"    if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        This is 4 spaces for the if (relative to the for) and 8 spaces for the body of the if. But the for loop is at 4 spaces (from the outer block), so the if is at 8, and the body at 12. However, the problem says the total n<=10^5, and the sum of n<=10^5, so the efficiency is O(n) per test case. We'll output the json.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about simulating falling stones in a grid. The grid has stones '*', obstacles 'o', and empty cells '.'.\n The stones fall down until they hit the floor, an obstacle, or another stone that has already stopped.\n\n The provided code for program1.py does the following:\n   - Reads the number of test cases.\n   - For each test case, reads n and m, then n lines of the grid.\n   - It initializes an array `r` of length m (columns) to count the number of stones per column that have been encountered so far (and then reset when an obstacle is found?).\n   - It then processes each row from top to bottom (since we are reading the grid from top to bottom).\n        For each row, it reads a list of characters for that row.\n        For each cell in the row:\n            If the cell is a stone '*', then it increments the count for that column in `r` and sets the current cell to '.' (because we are going to let the stone fall and then place it later).\n            If the cell is an obstacle 'o', then we have to do something with the stones we have collected in that column so far? The provided code has a while loop for `r[kk]` but it is inside the `elif` and also the loop condition is `while r[kk]` and then there is a TODO.\n\n However, note that the provided code structure is:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\n            a = list(input())\n            for kk in range(m):\n                if a[kk] == \"*\":\n                    r[kk] += 1\n                    a[kk] = \".\"\n                elif a[kk] == \"o\":\n                    while r[kk]:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n        Then after processing all rows, it does:\n            for jj in range(m):\n                while r[jj]:\n                    mat[n - r[jj]][jj] = \"*\"\n                    r[jj] -= 1\n\n But the problem is that the stones above an obstacle should be placed just above the obstacle? Actually, the stones fall until they hit an obstacle. So when we encounter an obstacle, we should place all the stones that we have collected so far in that column from the bottom up starting just above the obstacle.\n\n However, note that the grid is processed from top to bottom. So when we are at a row that has an obstacle, we have collected some stones in `r[kk]` for that column. These stones should be placed from the current row - 1 upwards? But wait, we haven't processed the entire column yet.\n\n Actually, the provided approach is:\n   - We are going to remove all stones and remember the count per column until we hit an obstacle. Then when we hit an obstacle, we reset the count by placing the stones we have so far above the obstacle? But note that after the obstacle, we might have more stones that fall and then stop at the obstacle? However, the stones above the obstacle are stopped by the obstacle, and then we can continue counting stones below the obstacle? But the grid is processed from top to bottom.\n\n Let me reexamine the problem: the stones fall down. So if we have a column, we want to have at the bottom: either the floor or an obstacle, and then above that we have stones that have fallen and then stopped. The stones that are above an obstacle will fall until they hit the obstacle. But if there are multiple obstacles, then we have segments.\n\n The provided code after the inner loop then goes on to place the remaining stones (that never hit an obstacle) at the bottom of the grid? But what if there was an obstacle in the middle? Then the stones above the obstacle are placed above the obstacle and the stones below the obstacle are placed at the bottom? That doesn't seem right.\n\n Actually, the provided code has a flaw: it doesn't reset the count for a column when it hits an obstacle? It only does a while loop for the current obstacle. But note that after the obstacle, we might have more stones that we need to collect? And then at the end, we place the remaining stones at the bottom.\n\n How about this: when we encounter an obstacle, we should place the stones that we have collected so far in that column from the obstacle row - 1 upwards (so the stones stack above the obstacle). Then we reset the count for that column? But note that after the obstacle, we can have more stones? So we should not reset the entire count? Actually, we should place the stones that are above the obstacle and then continue counting for the part below the obstacle? But the code is processing from top to bottom. So when we are at a row that has an obstacle, we have collected stones that are above this obstacle. We then place these stones from the current row - 1 going upwards (so the stone that is closest to the obstacle is at row current-1, then current-2, etc.). Then we set the count for that column to 0? But then we might have stones below the obstacle? How do we account for them?\n\n Alternatively, we can break the column into segments: from the top until the first obstacle, then from the obstacle to the next obstacle, etc. But the provided code does not store the obstacles per column? It is processing row by row.\n\n The provided code after the inner loop (the for kk loop) appends the row to `mat`. Then after processing all rows, it places the remaining stones (that never hit an obstacle) at the bottom of the grid. But what about the stones that hit an obstacle? They are placed during the processing of the row with the obstacle.\n\n So the TODO in the elif block should be: placing the stones that we have collected so far in that column above the obstacle. Specifically, we have `r[kk]` stones to place. We want to place them in the rows immediately above the current obstacle row, starting from the row just above the obstacle and going upwards. But note: we are in the middle of building the matrix. The matrix `mat` is being built row by row. We have not built the rows below the current row? So we cannot modify the rows above because they are already in `mat`? Actually, we are building the current row and then appending it. The rows above are already in `mat`.\n\n How is the matrix stored? We are building `mat` by appending each row (which we have processed by removing stones and obstacles) as we go from top to bottom. So when we are at row jj (which is the current row we are reading), we have `mat` containing rows 0 to jj-1. The current row we are processing is `a`.\n\n The problem: we want to place the stones that we have collected so far in column kk (which are `r[kk]` stones) above the current obstacle? But the obstacle is in the current row. So we want to put the stones in the rows from (jj-1) down to (jj - r[kk])? But note: the stones should be placed in the empty cells we have set to '.' and we have to update the matrix rows that are already in `mat`.\n\n However, we have already processed the rows above. We set the stones to '.' and counted them. Now we want to put them back above the obstacle? But we cannot change the rows that are already in `mat`? The provided code later does a loop for each column to place the remaining stones at the bottom. So why not do the same for the obstacle? We can note the position of the obstacle and then after processing the entire grid, we go back and adjust? But the provided code does not do that.\n\n Alternatively, we can store the obstacles and then after processing the entire grid, we know the positions of obstacles and then we can simulate per column? But the provided code is trying to do it on the fly.\n\n Another idea: when we encounter an obstacle, we place the stones that we have collected so far in that column in the rows above the obstacle, but we have to update the rows that are already in `mat`. How? We can go back and modify the rows in `mat`? But we are in the middle of building.\n\n The provided code after the inner loop (for kk) appends the current row `a` to `mat`. Then after processing all rows, it places the remaining stones (that never hit an obstacle) at the bottom. So for the stones that are stopped by an obstacle, we must place them in the already appended rows? That is, we have to modify `mat` for the rows above the current row.\n\n How about: when we encounter an obstacle at (jj, kk), we have `r[kk]` stones that have been collected for that column. We want to place these stones in the same column kk in the rows from jj-1 down to jj - r[kk]. But note: the rows from 0 to jj-1 are already in `mat`. So we can modify `mat` for row indices from jj - r[kk] to jj-1? But wait, we have to be careful: we cannot place a stone in a row that is above the previous obstacle? Actually, the stones fall until they hit the obstacle, so they should be stacked just above the obstacle. So we place the stones in the `r[kk]` consecutive cells above the obstacle.\n\n However, note that in the same column there might have been an obstacle above? But we are processing from top to bottom, so we have already processed the rows above. The stones we have collected in `r[kk]` are the stones that are above the current obstacle and below any previous obstacle? Actually, the previous obstacles in the same column would have been encountered earlier and we would have already placed the stones above them? So the stones we have in `r[kk]` are the stones that are between the last obstacle (or the top) and the current obstacle.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   for pos in range(jj-1, jj-1 - r[kk], -1):\n        mat[pos][kk] = '*'\n\n But wait, we have to set the stones in the matrix rows that are already built. However, note that we are currently building row jj and we have not appended it yet. The rows in `mat` are from index 0 to jj-1. So we can set the stones in the rows from jj-1 down to jj - r[kk] in column kk.\n\n But note: we have to set exactly `r[kk]` stones. So we set the stones in the `r[kk]` rows immediately above the current row (which is the obstacle row). Then we reset `r[kk]` to 0? Because we have placed these stones? But what if there are stones below the obstacle? We then continue processing the rows below? And we will count the stones below the obstacle and then at the end place them at the bottom? But the stones below the obstacle are not counted until we process the rows below? And we have set `r[kk]` to 0, so we start counting again for the part below the obstacle.\n\n So the code for the obstacle would be:\n\n   while r[kk]:\n        # We are going to place the stones in the rows above the obstacle, starting from the row just above (jj-1) and going up.\n        # But note: we have to do it one stone at a time? Actually, we can do it in one go, but the while loop condition is on r[kk] and we are going to decrement it until it becomes 0.\n\n        # Actually, the while loop runs for each stone? But that would be inefficient? However, m and n are at most 50, and the stones per column at most 50, so it's acceptable.\n\n        # We want to place the topmost stone? Actually, we want to stack from the bottom up? The stones fall, so the first stone we encountered (which is the topmost) should be at the bottom of the stack? But note: we are processing from top to bottom. The stones we encountered first are the ones that are higher. When they fall, they will be at the bottom of the stack above the obstacle? Actually, no: the stones fall and the one that was higher will fall and then be stopped by the obstacle? But then the next stone that falls will land on top of it? So the stones should be placed in the order: the first stone we encountered (the topmost) will be at the bottom of the stack, and the last stone we encountered (the one just above the obstacle) will be at the top of the stack? But that is the natural order.\n\n        However, we have to place the stones in the matrix. We have the matrix rows 0 to jj-1. We want to place the stones in column kk in the rows starting from jj-1 (the row immediately above the obstacle) and going upwards? But we have `r[kk]` stones. We want to place the first stone at jj-1, the next at jj-2, ... until we have placed all.\n\n        But note: we cannot place a stone in a row that is above the previous obstacle? Actually, we have already processed the column above and we know that there are no obstacles in between? Because we are processing the column from top to bottom and we reset the count when we hit an obstacle? So the segment above the current obstacle is free.\n\n        How about: we set the stone at row `jj - r[kk]` to row `jj-1`? Actually, we have `r[kk]` stones to place in the rows from `jj - r[kk]` to `jj-1`? But note: we have to place them in consecutive cells from the obstacle upwards. So the row jj-1 is the first above the obstacle, then jj-2, etc.\n\n        However, we are in a while loop that runs `r[kk]` times. We can do:\n\n            mat[jj - r[kk]][kk] = '*'   # This would be the topmost stone? But we want the bottom stone to be at jj-1.\n\n        Actually, we want the stones to be placed from the bottom (jj-1) going up to jj - r[kk]. So:\n\n            row_index = jj - r[kk]   # This would be the top of the stack? Then we set that to stone and then decrement r[kk] by 1.\n\n        But note: we are in a while loop that runs for each stone. So we can do:\n\n            mat[jj - r[kk]][kk] = '*'   # place the top stone? But then the next stone will be placed at jj - (r[kk]-1) which is one row below? That would be the natural order: the first stone we placed (the one we encountered first) is at the top? But we want the first stone we encountered to be at the bottom? \n\n        Alternatively, we can think: we have collected `r[kk]` stones. We want to place them in the rows from jj-1 down to jj - r[kk]. So the stone that was first encountered (the topmost) should be placed at jj - r[kk]? and the last encountered (the one just above the obstacle) at jj-1? But that would be the natural falling: the topmost stone falls the farthest? Actually, no: when the stones fall, the topmost stone will fall and then be stopped by the obstacle? Then the next stone above it will fall and land on top of the first stone? So the topmost stone (which we encountered first) ends up at the bottom? Then the next stone we encountered (which was below the first) ends up on top? \n\n        But wait: we are processing the grid from top to bottom. The first stone we meet is at a higher row (smaller index) and then we meet stones at lower rows (larger index). So the stone at row 0 is the topmost, then row 1, etc. When they fall, they all fall until they hit the obstacle. The stone at row 0 will fall the farthest and end up at the bottom of the stack (at row jj-1). The stone at row 1 will fall and land on top of the stone from row0? Actually, no: the stone at row0 falls and then the stone at row1 falls and then lands on top of the stone from row0? So the stone from row0 ends up at jj-1 and the stone from row1 ends up at jj-2? \n\n        But note: the falling happens simultaneously? The problem says \"all stones fall down\", meaning they all fall at the same time? But the simulation is done by gravity: they fall until they hit something. So the stones that are above will fall and then be stopped by the stones below? Actually, the problem says: \"until they meet the floor, an obstacle, or other stone which is already immovable\". So the stones that are lower (with a larger row index) will fall first? Actually, no: gravity acts on all at the same time. But the typical way to simulate is from the bottom up? Or from top to bottom? \n\n        However, the problem does not specify the order. The key is: the stones fall until they can't fall any further. The final configuration is independent of the order of falling? \n\n        The intended solution: we can process each column independently. We can collect the stones and then when we hit an obstacle, we put the stones we have collected so far above the obstacle (starting from the obstacle and going upwards) and then reset the count. Then for the bottom of the grid (if there is no obstacle) we put the stones at the bottom.\n\n        So the algorithm per column:\n\n          count = 0\n          for each row from top to bottom:\n             if cell is '*': \n                 count++ and set the cell to '.' (because we remove the stone to place later)\n             if cell is 'o':\n                 then we place the `count` stones in the `count` cells above this obstacle (from the current row-1 going upwards for `count` cells) and then set count=0.\n          after processing the column, if count>0, then place the remaining stones at the bottom (from the last row upwards for `count` cells).\n\n        But note: we are processing row by row and we have to update the matrix for the rows above? How? We can store the matrix as we build? And when we hit an obstacle, we update the rows that are already in the matrix? \n\n        The provided code has the matrix `mat` which is built row by row. The rows above are stored in `mat`. So when we are at row jj (0-indexed) and we hit an obstacle, we want to set the stones in the same column kk for the rows from jj-1 down to jj - count (if we have count stones) to '*'. But note: we have to update the rows that are already in `mat`. \n\n        So we can do:\n\n            # We are at row jj, and we have an obstacle at (jj, kk). We have collected `r[kk]` stones so far.\n            # We want to set the stones in the rows: jj-1, jj-2, ... jj - r[kk] (if we have r[kk] stones) in column kk to '*'.\n            # But note: the row jj-1 is the last row we appended? Actually, the rows in `mat` are from index 0 to jj-1. So we can do:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n\n            Then set r[kk] = 0.\n\n        However, what if we have more stones than the available rows above? That is, if r[kk] > jj? Then jj - i would be negative? But note: the grid has jj rows above (from 0 to jj-1). So we require that we have at most jj stones above? But the problem says the grid has n rows and we are at row jj (0-indexed, so jj from 0 to n-1). The stones we have collected are from row0 to row jj-1? So we have jj rows above? and we have r[kk] stones, which must be <= jj? Actually, it is because we collected the stones from the rows above.\n\n        But note: we have set the stones to '.' and then we are going to set them to '*' again? That is acceptable.\n\n        However, the provided code does not reset the count to 0? We are in a while loop that runs until r[kk] becomes 0? Actually, the while loop condition is `while r[kk]` and then we do something. We must break out of the loop? Actually, we can set the stones and then set r[kk] to 0 and break? But the while loop condition is on r[kk] and we are going to set it to 0, so we break. But the while loop is inside the for kk loop and the for jj loop. We can do:\n\n            # Instead of a while loop, we can do a for loop? But the code has a while loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            # We break the while loop by using a for loop and then setting r[kk] to 0? But the while loop condition is on r[kk]. We can do:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0   # reset the count for the stones above the obstacle\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is `while r[kk]` and we are going to do this block only once? Because after we set r[kk] to 0, the while condition becomes false. However, the while loop is inside the for kk loop and the for jj loop. We are at a fixed kk and jj. So we can do:\n\n            # Actually, we don't need a while loop? We can just do:\n\n            if a[kk]=='o':\n                # Place the stones we have collected so far in column kk above the obstacle.\n                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                r[kk] = 0   # reset the count for the next segment (below the obstacle)\n\n        But the code has a while loop. We can replace the while loop with this for loop and then setting to 0? But note: the while loop condition is `while r[kk]` and we are going to run it until r[kk] becomes 0. We can break by setting r[kk]=0 and then break? Actually, we can just do the for loop and then set r[kk]=0 and then break the while loop? But the while loop will run only once? Because we set r[kk] to 0. So we can do:\n\n            elif a[kk]==\"o\":\n                # Place the stones above the obstacle\n                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                r[kk] = 0\n\n        But note: the while loop is written as `while r[kk]:` and then we have a block. We can do the above and then break the while loop? Actually, we don't need to break because we set r[kk] to 0 and then the while condition becomes false. So the while loop will run only once.\n\n        However, the while loop is inside the for kk loop and we are at a specific kk. We are processing the current row jj and the current column kk. We have an obstacle at (jj, kk). We want to place the stones that we have collected so far in column kk above the obstacle. Then we reset the count for that column to 0 so that we can start counting the stones below the obstacle.\n\n        But note: what if there are multiple obstacles in the same column? Then when we hit the next obstacle, we will do the same: place the stones we have collected since the last obstacle above the current obstacle.\n\n        So the code for the obstacle becomes:\n\n            elif a[kk]==\"o\":\n                # Place the stones above the obstacle\n                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                r[kk] = 0\n\n        However, note: the while loop condition is `while r[kk]` and we are going to run the body once (if r[kk]>0) and then set r[kk] to 0. But the while loop condition is checked again? Then it becomes 0 and we break. So we can do:\n\n            elif a[kk]==\"o\":\n                # Instead of a while loop, we can do:\n                if r[kk] > 0:\n                    for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                        mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                    r[kk] = 0\n\n        But the code has a while loop. We can leave the while loop and then break by setting r[kk] to 0? Actually, the while loop is written and we must fill the body. We can do:\n\n            while r[kk]:\n                # We are going to place one stone? But we are placing all at once? \n                # Alternatively, we can do one stone per iteration? But that would be inefficient and we know we want to place all.\n\n            How about:\n\n                # We break the while loop by doing all at once and then setting r[kk] to 0? But the while loop condition is on r[kk]. We can do:\n\n                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                r[kk] = 0   # this will break the while loop\n\n        But note: the while loop condition is `while r[kk]` and we are going to run the body only once? Because we set r[kk] to 0. So it's acceptable.\n\n        However, what if we don't have any stones? Then we skip the while loop. So that's fine.\n\n        But note: the while loop is inside the for kk loop and the for jj loop. We are at a fixed kk and jj. So we can do:\n\n            elif a[kk]==\"o\":\n                # We are going to place all the stones we have collected so far in column kk above the obstacle.\n                # We have r[kk] stones. We place them in the rows from jj-1 down to jj - r[kk].\n                # Actually, we can do:\n                #   for i in range(r[kk]):\n                #       mat[jj - 1 - i][kk] = '*'\n                #   r[kk] = 0\n                # But note: we are using the row indices: jj-1, jj-2, ... jj - r[kk] (which is jj-1 - (r[kk]-1) = jj - r[kk]?).\n\n                # Alternatively, we can do:\n                #   for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                #       mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n\n                # But note: the row jj-i must be in the range [0, jj-1]. Since we have collected r[kk] stones from the rows above, and we are at row jj, then jj - r[kk] >= 0? It should be, because we have at most jj stones (from row0 to row jj-1).\n\n                # So we do:\n                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                r[kk] = 0\n\n        However, note: the while loop condition is `while r[kk]` and we are setting r[kk] to 0. So the while loop will run only once.\n\n        But what if we have a very large r[kk]? The for loop will run r[kk] times, which is at most 50, so it's acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py in the TODO is:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        However, note: the while loop condition is `while r[kk]` and we are going to set r[kk] to 0. But we are in a while loop that runs as long as r[kk] is not zero. We break by setting to zero. But we must break the while loop? Actually, the while loop will run one iteration and then break because r[kk] becomes 0.\n\n        But what if we have multiple obstacles in the same column? We are processing row by row. When we hit the first obstacle, we place the stones above it and reset the count. Then when we hit the next obstacle in the same column (below the first), we will have collected stones between the two obstacles? And then we place them above the second obstacle? That is correct.\n\n        However, note: the stones that are between two obstacles: we remove them (set to '.') and count in r[kk]. Then when we hit the next obstacle, we place them above that obstacle? Yes.\n\n        But note: the stones that are below the last obstacle? They are collected in r[kk] and then at the end of the test case, we place them at the bottom? Yes, because after processing all rows, we have:\n\n            for jj in range(m):\n                while r[jj]:\n                    mat[n - r[jj]][jj] = \"*\"\n                    r[jj] -= 1\n\n        This places the stones that never hit an obstacle (or are below the last obstacle) at the bottom of the grid.\n\n        So the complete code for program1.py is:\n\n            for ii in range(int(input())):\n                n,m = map(int, input().split())\n                mat=[]\n                r=[0]*m\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    a=list(input())\n                    for kk in range(m):\n                        if a[kk]==\"*\":\n                            r[kk]+=1\n                            a[kk]=\".\"\n                        elif a[kk]==\"o\":\n                            while r[kk]:\n                                # We fill here\n                                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                                r[kk] = 0\n                                # But note: we break the while loop because we set r[kk] to 0, so we break the while loop after one iteration.\n                    mat.append(a)\n                for jj in range(m):\n                    while r[jj]:\n                        mat[n - r[jj]][jj] = \"*\"\n                        r[jj] -= 1\n                for jj in range(n):\n                    print(\"\".join(mat[jj]))\n\n        However, note: the while loop runs as long as r[kk] is not zero. We set r[kk] to zero and then break? But the while loop condition is at the top. So we run the body once and then break.\n\n        But what if we have an obstacle and r[kk] is zero? Then we skip the while loop. So that's correct.\n\n        But note: the for loop for i in range(1, r[kk]+1) will not run if r[kk] is 0? So we can avoid the if condition.\n\n        However, the while loop condition already checks that r[kk] is not zero. So we are safe.\n\n        But wait: what if we have multiple obstacles in the same column? We are processing row by row. When we hit the first obstacle, we set r[kk] to 0. Then when we hit the next obstacle in the same column (in a later row), we have collected stones in r[kk] for the segment between the two obstacles? Then we place them above the second obstacle? Yes.\n\n        However, note: the stones that are above the first obstacle are placed above the first obstacle. The stones that are between the first and second obstacle are placed above the second obstacle? That is correct.\n\n        But note: the stones that are above the first obstacle are placed in the rows above the first obstacle? And the stones between the two obstacles are placed above the second obstacle? That is, the stones that are above the first obstacle are not moved again? Correct.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        But note: the while loop runs only once? Because we set r[kk] to 0. So we can also break? But it's not necessary because the condition will be false next time.\n\n        However, the while loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration. So we break naturally.\n\n        But note: the while loop is inside the for kk loop and the for jj loop. We are at a fixed kk and jj. So we do the above and then break the while loop.\n\n        But what if we have an obstacle and r[kk] is very large? The for loop runs r[kk] times, which is acceptable.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        However, note: the while loop condition is `while r[kk]` and we are setting r[kk] to 0. But we are in the body of the while loop. The next iteration of the while loop would check the condition and break. But we break immediately because we set to 0? Actually, the while loop runs the entire body and then checks the condition again. So we do the entire body (the for loop and the assignment) and then the condition becomes false and we break.\n\n        So it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: the while loop body must be indented. The current code has:\n\n            while r[kk]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must fill the TODO with:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        However, note: the for loop and the assignment must be at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\n        But the problem says: Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        We are to output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py in a json.\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n        The problem: stamping problem. We have a row of n white cells. We can stamp any two adjacent cells with either BR or RB. The stamp must fit entirely. We can stamp multiple times and the same cell can be stamped multiple times. The stamping operation: each stamping recolors both cells (so if a cell is stamped multiple times, its color changes multiple times). We are given a target string s (of length n) with characters 'W', 'R', 'B'. We have to determine if it is possible to achieve.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        The print statement: \n            If b is 0, then we print 'YNEOS'[0::2] -> 'YES'\n            If b is 1, then we print 'YNEOS'[1::2] -> 'NO'\n\n        So we set b=1 if we find an impossible segment.\n\n        The idea: we split the string by 'W'. Why? Because white cells are not colored? Actually, white cells are the initial state. And note: if we never stamp a cell, it remains white. Also, if we stamp a cell an even number of times, the net effect might be white? But note: the stamping always sets the cell to either R or B. How can we get white? Only by never stamping? \n\n        Therefore, in the final picture, a white cell must never have been stamped. And adjacent cells that are stamped must form contiguous segments? But note: the stamp is of size 2, so we can have overlapping stamps.\n\n        Insight: the problem is solved by splitting the string into segments separated by white. Then we check each segment independently. Why? Because the stamping operations are independent in segments separated by white (since the white cell is never stamped, so the stamps cannot cross the white).\n\n        For a segment (a contiguous substring without 'W'), we want to know if it can be formed by the stamping operations.\n\n        Conditions for a segment:\n\n          - The segment must be non-empty? Actually, if the segment is empty (i.e., between two consecutive W's and no characters) then we skip.\n\n          - The length of the segment must be at least 1? But note: the stamp is of size 2. So we cannot stamp a single cell. Therefore, a segment of length 1 is impossible? \n\n          - Also, note: the entire segment must be stamped? But we can use the stamp multiple times and overlapping. \n\n        How to check a segment?\n\n          We note that the stamping operation is linear? Actually, we can think in terms of parity. Assign 0 to B and 1 to R? Then each stamping operation adds a vector of (0,1) or (1,0) to two adjacent cells? But note: the stamp can be BR (which we can denote as (0,1)) or RB (1,0). But the same stamp can be applied multiple times and the operations are additive modulo 2? \n\n          However, note: the initial state is all white, which we can denote as 0. Then each stamp on positions i and i+1 adds:\n\n              either: (1,0) to (i, i+1)  [if we use RB]\n              or: (0,1) to (i, i+1) [if we use BR]\n\n          But we can use both types arbitrarily. So the entire coloring is a linear combination of these vectors.\n\n          Conditions:\n\n            The entire segment must have an even number of stamps? Actually, no: we are working modulo 2? \n\n          Alternatively, we can note:\n\n            The parity of the number of stamps covering a cell: \n                Let x_i be the number of times the stamp starting at i (covering i and i+1) is used as RB? \n                Let y_i be the number of times the stamp starting at i is used as BR? \n\n            Then the color at position i:\n\n                If we denote R as 1 and B as 0, then:\n\n                color_i = (x_{i-1} + y_{i-1}) [if we consider the stamp ending at i]? \n\n            Actually, the stamps that cover position i are the stamps starting at i-1 and i.\n\n            Specifically:\n\n                For position i:\n                  It is covered by:\n                    - the stamp starting at i-1 (if any) which covers (i-1, i): if that stamp is RB, then it adds 1 to i? if BR, then it adds 0 to i? \n                    - the stamp starting at i (if any) which covers (i, i+1): if that stamp is RB, then it adds 1 to i? if BR, then it adds 0 to i?\n\n            But wait: the stamp RB: the first cell becomes R (1) and the second becomes B (0). So for the stamp at [i, i+1] as RB: \n                position i: 1\n                position i+1: 0\n\n            Similarly, BR: \n                position i: 0\n                position i+1: 1\n\n            So the value at position i is the sum (mod2) of:\n                the number of stamps that start at i-1 and are of type RB? \n                plus the number of stamps that start at i and are of type BR? \n\n            Actually, no: the stamp starting at i-1 (if it is RB) sets position i to 0? Wait, no: the stamp starting at i-1 covers (i-1, i). If it is RB, then position i becomes B (0). If it is BR, then position i becomes R (1). \n\n            Similarly, the stamp starting at i covers (i, i+1). If it is RB, then position i becomes R (1). If it is BR, then position i becomes B (0).\n\n            So the value at position i is:\n\n                = (if the stamp at i-1 is BR? then 1, else 0) \n                  + (if the stamp at i is RB? then 1, else 0)   [mod2]\n\n            But note: we can use the same stamp multiple times? Then the value is the parity of the sum.\n\n            So we have:\n\n                color_i = a_{i-1} + b_i   (mod2)\n\n            where a_{i-1} is 1 if the stamp at i-1 is BR (and 0 if RB) and b_i is 1 if the stamp at i is RB (and 0 if BR)? \n\n            Actually, we can define:\n\n                Let x_i be the number of times (mod2) we use the stamp starting at i as RB.\n                Let y_i be the number of times (mod2) we use the stamp starting at i as BR.\n\n            Then the color at i:\n\n                = (y_{i-1} + x_i) mod 2\n\n            And we have the constraint that for the entire segment [l, r] (with length L = r-l+1), we have:\n\n                For i from l to r: \n                    color_i = (y_{i-1} + x_i) mod 2\n\n            And for positions outside the segment, we don't care? But note: the stamps that cover the segment: \n                The stamps that start at l-1? but l-1 is outside the segment? Actually, the segment is contiguous and we are only concerned with the segment. The stamps that affect the segment are those that start at positions from l-1 to r-1? But the stamp starting at l-1 covers (l-1, l) and the stamp starting at r covers (r, r+1) which is outside. So the stamps that start at l-1 and r are not entirely in the segment? But the problem says the stamp must fit completely. So we can only use stamps that are entirely within the segment? Actually, no: the stamp must cover two adjacent cells that are in the segment? But the segment is contiguous and we are only allowed to stamp within the segment? \n\n            Actually, the stamp must be applied to two adjacent cells that are both in the segment? So the stamps we use must start at positions from l to r-1 (if the segment is from l to r).\n\n            Therefore, the stamps that affect the segment are only those starting at l to r-1.\n\n            Then the color at the leftmost cell (l) is:\n\n                color_l = (y_{l-1} + x_l) mod 2\n\n            But y_{l-1} is a stamp starting at l-1? which is outside the segment? So we cannot use that stamp? Therefore, we set y_{l-1}=0. Similarly, the color at the rightmost cell (r) is:\n\n                color_r = (y_{r-1} + x_r) mod 2\n\n            But note: there is no stamp starting at r? because the segment ends at r, so the stamps start at l to r-1. So x_r is not defined? Actually, we only have stamps from l to r-1. So:\n\n                color_l = x_l mod 2   (because y_{l-1} is forced to 0, and we don't have a stamp starting at l-1 because it would cover l-1 and l, and l-1 is outside the segment? so we cannot use it? and we set y_{l-1}=0)\n\n                color_r = y_{r-1} mod 2   (because the next stamp would be at r, but we don't have one, so x_r=0)\n\n            For an interior cell i (l < i < r):\n\n                color_i = (y_{i-1} + x_i) mod 2\n\n            Now, we have a system of equations. The variables are x_l, y_l, x_{l+1}, y_{l+1}, ... x_{r-1}, y_{r-1}. But note: at each stamp position i, we have two choices? But we are working mod2: we can use the stamp at i as RB (x_i=1) or as BR (y_i=1) or both? Actually, we can use the stamp multiple times, but mod2 we only care about parity. So we can have x_i and y_i as booleans? But note: we cannot use both at the same time? Actually, we can: using both would be equivalent to using neither? because (RB then BR) on the same two cells: \n                first RB: (R, B) then BR: (B, R) -> overall (B, R) which is not the same as the initial (W,W). \n\n            Alternatively, we can note that at each stamp position i, we have one free variable: the net effect is either:\n\n                We can use the stamp an odd number of times as RB (then x_i=1) and y_i=0, \n                or as BR (then y_i=1 and x_i=0),\n                or both (then x_i=1 and y_i=1) -> which is equivalent to (1,1) mod2.\n\n            But note: the stamp cannot be used in both orientations arbitrarily? Actually, we can use it multiple times in any orientation. The net effect mod2 is additive.\n\n            However, the problem: we have two types of operations at position i: \n                Type1: add (1,0) to (i, i+1)  [RB]\n                Type2: add (0,1) to (i, i+1)  [BR]\n\n            So the total effect at i: \n                = (number of type1 stamps at i-1) + (number of type2 stamps at i)   mod2? \n\n            But we have two variables per stamp? Actually, we can combine: at stamp i, we let z_i = (number of type1 stamps at i) mod2, and w_i = (number of type2 stamps at i) mod2. Then the effect at cell i:\n\n                = w_{i-1} + z_i   mod2\n\n            And we have the constraint that at each stamp i, we can have any combination of z_i and w_i? \n\n            Now, we have:\n\n                color_l = z_l   (because w_{l-1}=0, since there is no stamp at l-1) \n                color_{l+1} = w_l + z_{l+1}\n                ...\n                color_r = w_{r-1}\n\n            We have L = r-l+1 equations and 2*(L-1) variables? (stamps from l to r-1: L-1 stamps, each with two variables). So the system is underdetermined? \n\n            But note: we are not required to solve the system, only to know if there exists an assignment.\n\n            Conditions:\n\n                The sum of the entire segment mod2? \n\n            Alternatively, we can note:\n\n                The entire segment must have an even number of R? \n\n            But consider: \n                The effect at each cell is the sum of two adjacent stamps (one from the left and one from the right). Then the sum over the entire segment of the colors mod2:\n\n                  = color_l + color_{l+1} + ... + color_r mod2\n                  = [z_l] + [w_l + z_{l+1}] + [w_{l+1} + z_{l+2}] + ... + [w_{r-1}] \n                  = z_l + (w_l + z_{l+1}) + (w_{l+1} + z_{l+2}) + ... + w_{r-1}\n                  = z_l + (w_l + z_{l+1} + w_{l+1} + ... + w_{r-2} + z_{r-1}) + w_{r-1}\n                  = z_l + w_{r-1} + (w_l + z_{l+1}) + (w_{l+1} + z_{l+2}) + ... \n\n            But note: the stamps from l to r-1: each stamp i has two variables: z_i and w_i. In the sum, each z_i appears once (at cell i) and each w_i appears once (at cell i+1). So the entire sum is:\n\n                  = z_l + w_{r-1} + (w_l + z_{l+1} + w_{l+1} + z_{l+2} + ... + w_{r-2} + z_{r-1}) \n                  = (z_l + w_l) + (z_{l+1} + w_{l+1}) + ... + (z_{r-1} + w_{r-1})   mod2\n\n            But note: each stamp i can be represented by a pair (z_i, w_i). The sum of the segment is the sum of (z_i + w_i) for i from l to r-1.\n\n            And we can choose z_i and w_i arbitrarily? Then the sum of the segment mod2 can be any value? \n\n            However, we have constraints on the individual colors.\n\n        Another approach: known solution\n\n          After reading known solutions for similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem C), the solution is:\n\n            - Split the string by 'W'\n            - For each segment (contiguous non-white part), check:\n                * If the segment length is 1: then impossible.\n                * Else, check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. Why?\n                      Because if the entire segment is one color, say all 'R', then how can we achieve it?\n                      Consider: \n                          We start with WW...W (all white).\n                          We need to make RR...R.\n\n                      How? \n                          We can use the stamp on the first two: as RB -> RBW...W \n                          Then we need to fix the second cell: we can stamp the second and third: as BR -> R BR on (2,3): then we have R (from first stamp) and then the second stamp: \n                              first cell: R (unchanged) \n                              second cell: originally B (from first stamp) then we stamp with BR: so the second cell becomes B? then we stamp with BR: the second cell becomes B XOR 1? Actually, no: the stamping sets the two cells. \n\n                      Alternatively, we can note: \n                          The first stamp: (1,2) as RB: gives R at 1 and B at 2.\n                          Then we stamp (1,2) again as BR: gives B at 1 and R at 2 -> then we have B and R? \n                          Then we stamp (1,2) again as RB: gives R at 1 and B at 2.\n\n                      We cannot get two R's? \n\n                      Actually, to get two R's: \n                          We stamp (1,2) as RB: R at 1, B at 2.\n                          Then stamp (2,3) as BR: then at 2: we have B then becomes R? and at 3: becomes B? -> then we have R, R, B.\n\n                      Then we can stamp (3,4) as BR to get R at 3? but then we have R, R, R, B? \n\n                      How to get two consecutive R's? \n                          We can do:\n                              Start: WWW\n                              Stamp (1,2) as RB: RBW\n                              Stamp (2,3) as BR: R (at1), then at2: we stamp with BR: so the second cell becomes R? and the third becomes B? -> RRB\n                              Then we have two R's at the beginning.\n\n                      But then we have a B at the end. How to change the last B to R? \n                          We stamp (2,3) again as RB: then at2: R becomes B? and at3: B becomes R? -> then we have R, B, R.\n\n                      We cannot get RRR? \n\n                      Actually, we can do:\n                          WWW -> (1,2) as RB: RBW -> (2,3) as BR: R (from1), then (2,3): BR -> so second becomes R and third becomes B? -> RRB? \n                          Then (2,3) as RB: second becomes B and third becomes R -> RBR.\n\n                      It seems we cannot get three R's.\n\n          Known solution: \n            We can only form a segment if the segment has at least one R and at least one B? \n\n          Why? \n            Because the stamp always stamps one R and one B. So the entire segment must have at least one R and one B? \n\n          But consider: \n            We can stamp multiple times. The net effect on a cell: \n                The parity of the number of times it is covered by a stamp that sets it to R (and similarly for B) matters.\n\n          However, note: \n            The entire segment must have an even number of stamps? Not necessarily.\n\n          Insight: \n            The operations are reversible? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) C is:\n\n            def solve():\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                for part in s.split('W'):\n                    if part == '': continue\n                    if 'R' not in part or 'B' not in part:\n                        print(\"NO\")\n                        return\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n          But note: the problem says the entire picture must be made. And we split by W. And then each segment must contain both R and B.\n\n          Why? \n            If a segment has only R's, then we cannot form it because we cannot have a segment of length 1? and also because the stamp always produces one R and one B. So if we have a segment of length>=2 and only R's, then we must have an even number of R's? But even then, we cannot avoid having a B? \n\n          Example: \n            Segment \"RR\": \n                We can do: \n                  Start: WW -> stamp (0,1) as RB: gives RB -> but we have one R and one B? \n                  Then we can stamp again as BR: then we get BR? -> then we have B and R? \n                  Then we can stamp again as RB: then we get RB? \n                We never get two R's.\n\n          Therefore, the condition is: \n            - The segment must be non-empty and must contain at least one R and at least one B.\n\n          But note: what if the segment is of length 1? Then we cannot form it? So we must check:\n\n            if the segment is non-empty and (it does not contain both R and B) then it's impossible.\n\n          However, a segment of length 1 is automatically impossible? because we cannot stamp a single cell? and also it cannot contain both R and B? \n\n          So the condition: \n            For each non-empty segment (after splitting by 'W'):\n                if the segment has only one color (either all 'R' or all 'B'), then it's impossible.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            for each segment in s.split('W'):\n                if segment != '':\n                    if 'R' not in segment or 'B' not in segment:\n                        b = 1   # mark as impossible\n                        break\n\n          But note: the provided code has:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # s is a string from the input, and we do s[:-1] to remove the newline? \n                # then we do something\n\n          And then we set b=0 initially. If we find an impossible segment, we set b=1.\n\n          However, the for loop iterates over the segments. We can break early? \n\n          The code:\n\n            b = 0\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i != '' and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break   # but note: we are in a for loop, we can break\n\n          But the problem: the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can do this.\n\n          However, note: the split might produce empty strings. We skip the empty strings.\n\n          But what if the entire string is white? Then we have no segment? Then we don't set b=1, so we output YES.\n\n          Example: n=1, s=\"W\" -> possible? because we don't stamp at all.\n\n          So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i != '' and ( 'R' not in i or 'B' not in i ):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          But note: the condition: \n                if the segment is non-empty and (it does not contain at least one R OR it does not contain at least one B) -> then impossible.\n\n          This is equivalent to: if the segment is non-empty and (it is not the case that it contains both R and B).\n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition \"if i\" checks that i is not empty.\n\n          So we can write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n          However, the problem: what if the segment has both R and B? Then we skip.\n\n          But note: the segment might be \"RBRB\" -> that's okay? because it has both R and B.\n\n          Example: \n            s = \"RBRB\" -> split by W: one segment \"RBRB\", which has both R and B -> okay.\n\n          Example: \n            s = \"RR\" -> segment \"RR\": \n                'R' in \"RR\" -> True, 'B' in \"RR\" -> False -> so condition: not (True and False) = not (False) = True -> then we set b=1.\n\n          Example:\n            s = \"BB\" -> similarly.\n\n          Example:\n            s = \"R\" -> segment \"R\": \n                not (True and False) = True -> set b=1.\n\n          Example:\n            s = \"B\" -> similarly.\n\n          Example:\n            s = \"RB\" -> segment \"RB\": \n                'R' in \"RB\" -> True, 'B' in \"RB\" -> True -> condition: not (True) = False -> skip.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the for loop is written without a body? We have to complete the for loop.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must write the body. The body should be:\n\n            if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        However, note: the for loop must be indented. The current code has:\n\n            b=0\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n            print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        We must fill the TODO with the body of the for loop.\n\n        But the TODO is at the end of the for loop line? Actually, the for loop line is incomplete. We can write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the original code has a comment at the end of the for loop line. We can remove the comment? Or we can write the body.\n\n        Since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", we can write the entire for loop body.\n\n        However, the problem says: Output only the missing code.\n\n        We are to output the missing code for program1 and program2 in a json.\n\n        Summary:\n\n          program1: \n            \"program1\": \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\n            r[kk] = 0\"\n\n          But note: the while loop body must be exactly that? And the indentation? We are replacing the TODO with 3 lines.\n\n          However, the while loop body is currently:\n\n                while r[kk]:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with:\n\n                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                r[kk] = 0\n\n          But note: the for loop and the assignment must be indented one level more than the while.\n\n          We write it as a string with newlines.\n\n          program2:\n\n            \"program2\": \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n                b = 1\\n                break\"\n\n          But note: the for loop in program2 is already written, we are only filling the body.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to output the missing block for program1 and the missing block for program2.\n\n        We output as a json string.\n\n        Example output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\n            r[kk] = 0\",\n                \"program2\": \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n                b = 1\\n                break\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2 code: the for loop body must be exactly that? And the indentation level? The original code has 4 spaces per level? We use 4 or 8? \n\n        We can use 4 spaces for each indent level. The for loop body should be indented one level (4 spaces) and the if body should be indented two levels (8 spaces).\n\n        However, the provided code in program2 has:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        We are replacing the for loop body. The for loop body should be:\n\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the for loop line ends with a colon? Then the body must be indented.\n\n        We write the body as:\n\n            if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        And we use 4 spaces for the first indent and 8 for the inner.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but it must be valid Python.\n\n        We'll use 4 spaces per indent.\n\n        Actually, the original program2 code uses 4 spaces? We see:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                b=0\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n                print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n        The for loop body is missing. We are to write the body with 4 spaces of indent.\n\n        So:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But note: the condition can be written as:\n\n            if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if i and ('R' not in i or 'B' not in i):\n\n        But the two are equivalent by De Morgan.\n\n        We choose the first.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n        mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\n    r[kk] = 0\",\n                \"program2\": \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program1 code: the while loop body is already indented? The while loop is inside the for kk loop and the for jj loop. The while loop body should be indented one more level. We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        How many spaces? The original code uses 4 spaces per indent. The while loop is already at 8 spaces (if the for loops are 4 and 8). Then the for loop should be at 12 spaces? and the assignment at 8? \n\n        But the problem does not require the exact number of spaces, as long as it is consistent. We can use 4 spaces per indent.\n\n        We write:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        with the for loop indented 4 more spaces than the while, and the body of the for loop indented 4 more spaces. But the assignment after the for loop should be at the same level as the for loop.\n\n        Alternatively, we can write without specifying the exact spaces? But the problem says to output the missing code.\n\n        We'll use 4 spaces for each indent level.\n\n        For program1, the while loop body is:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        We write it as a string with newlines and spaces.\n\n        Similarly for program2.\n\n        However, note: the program1 code has:\n\n            while r[kk]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        We write the for loop and the assignment. The for loop body is one line.\n\n        We output:\n\n            \"program1\": \"    for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n        mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\n    r[kk] = 0\"\n\n        But wait: the while loop body is already indented by one level. We are adding an extra level for the for loop? \n\n        Actually, the while loop body should be:\n\n            [indentation level 1] for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n            [indentation level 2]     mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            [indentation level 1] r[kk] = 0\n\n        But the original while loop body is at the same indentation as the for loop we are writing? \n\n        We can write without the initial 4 spaces? because the while loop body is already at the correct indentation.\n\n        How about we write:\n\n            \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\nr[kk] = 0\"\n\n        But then the for loop body must be indented relative to the for loop.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            \"program1\": \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\nr[kk] = 0\"\n\n        But note: the while loop body is one level in. The for loop and the assignment should be at the same level? \n\n        Actually, the while loop body is a block. The for loop is a block. We write:\n\n            while r[kk]:\n                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                r[kk] = 0\n\n        So the for loop is at the same level as the assignment? Actually, the for loop is a compound statement: the for loop header and the body. The body of the for loop is indented one more.\n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n        mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\n    r[kk] = 0\"\n\n        But wait: the original while loop body is indented by 4 spaces. Then the for loop should be indented 4 more? That would be 8? and the for loop body 12? and the assignment 8? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            \"program1\": \"    for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n        mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\n    r[kk] = 0\"\n\n        But that adds 4 spaces at the beginning? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do without the initial 4 spaces? because the while loop body is already at 4 spaces. Then the for loop should be at 4 spaces? and the for loop body at 8? and the assignment at 4? \n\n        We write:\n\n            for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n            r[kk] = 0\n\n        as the body of the while loop.\n\n        So the string for program1 is:\n\n            \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\nr[kk] = 0\"\n\n        But that is not indented? \n\n        We must use the same indentation as the surrounding code. The surrounding code uses 4 spaces per indent.\n\n        The while loop body is at 4 spaces. The for loop should be at 4 spaces (same as the while body) and the for loop body at 8 spaces. The assignment after the for loop at 4 spaces.\n\n        Therefore:\n\n            Line1: 4 spaces + \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\"\n            Line2: 8 spaces + \"mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\"\n            Line3: 4 spaces + \"r[kk] = 0\"\n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n        mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\n    r[kk] = 0\"\n\n        Explanation:\n            The first line: no extra spaces? but it will be placed at the current indentation level (4 spaces). Then we write the for loop: \n                \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\" -> at 4 spaces.\n            Then the body of the for loop: we want 8 spaces -> we output 4 more spaces? so we write 4 spaces in the string? but the surrounding already has 4, so we add 4 more -> total 8? \n                So we write: \"    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\" -> 4 spaces at the beginning of the string.\n            Then the next line: we want to be at 4 spaces -> so we write: \"r[kk] = 0\" without spaces? but then it will be at 4 spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write without the spaces and let the existing indentation handle it? \n\n        But the problem: the while loop body is already at 4 spaces. We are writing three lines:\n\n            Line1: \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\" -> this will be at 4 spaces (because the while body is 4 spaces)\n            Line2: \"    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\" -> this will be at 4+4=8 spaces\n            Line3: \"r[kk] = 0\" -> at 4 spaces\n\n        So we write:\n\n            \"program1\": \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\nr[kk] = 0\"\n\n        This will be:\n\n            while r[kk]:\n                for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\n                    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\n                r[kk] = 0\n\n        The for loop body is indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\n        Similarly, for program2:\n\n            We write the body of the for loop:\n\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n            The for loop is at 4 spaces. The if should be at 4+4=8 spaces? and the break at 12? \n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n        Then it will be:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But the break is at the same level as the if body? \n\n        Actually, the break is in the if body. So it should be indented one more.\n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        Then:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        But the break is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n        Then:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        That is not valid.\n\n        So we must indent the body of the if.\n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        This will be:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        With 8 spaces for the if body.\n\n        But the for loop is at 4 spaces, the if at 8, and the if body at 12? \n\n        We can do:\n\n            \"program2\": \"    if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        Then the if will be at 4+4=8 spaces, and the if body at 8+4=12? \n\n        But the problem: the for loop body is one statement: the if statement. We can write:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        So the if is at 4 spaces? Actually, the for loop body should be indented. The for loop is at 4 spaces, then the body should be 8 spaces? \n\n        We write the body as:\n\n            if ...:\n                b = 1\n                break\n\n        So the if is at 8 spaces? and the break at 12? \n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"    if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        This means:\n\n            Line1: 4 spaces (from the for) + 4 spaces (from the string) = 8 spaces: \"    if ...\"\n            Line2: 4+8 = 12 spaces: \"        b=1\"\n            Line3: 12 spaces: \"        break\"\n\n        But the break is at 12 spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write without the initial 4 spaces? \n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n    b = 1\\n    break\"\n\n        Then:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n            if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n            b = 1\n            break\n\n        That is not indented.\n\n        Therefore, we must include the indentation.\n\n        The correct way: the for loop body should be indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop. So we write the body as:\n\n            if ...:   # at 4 spaces relative to the for -> so 4+4=8? \n            then the body of the if: 4 more -> 12.\n\n        But the provided code in the problem does not specify the current indentation of the for loop body? \n\n        We assume that the for loop is at the current indentation level, and we are to write the body at one more level.\n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"    if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        This will be:\n\n            for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n        How? \n            The for loop line ends with a colon, so the next line must be indented. The existing code has:\n\n                for i in s[:-1].split('W'):# TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO with:\n\n                if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\n                    b = 1\n                    break\n\n            But we must indent the entire block.\n\n        Since the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", we output the block as it would appear in the program, indented by 4 spaces relative to the for loop.\n\n        Therefore, we output for program2:\n\n            \"    if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        But note: the break is at the same level as the assignment? \n\n        We write the break at the same level as the assignment? \n\n        The body of the if is two statements: \n            b = 1\n            break\n\n        So they should be at the same level.\n\n        We write:\n\n            \"    if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n\n        This is 4 spaces for the if (relative to the for) and 8 spaces for the body of the if.\n\n        But the for loop is at 4 spaces (from the outer block), so the if is at 8, and the body at 12.\n\n        However, the problem says the total n<=10^5, and the sum of n<=10^5, so the efficiency is O(n) per test case.\n\n        We'll output the json.\n\n        Final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"for i in range(1, r[kk]+1):\\n    mat[jj - i][kk] = '*'\\nr[kk] = 0\",\n                \"program2\": \"    if i and not ('R' in i and 'B' in i):\\n        b = 1\\n        break\"\n            }\n\n        But wait, for program1: the for loop body is one line, and we want to set the matrix at the correct row. We use jj - i: note that i goes from 1 to r[kk] (inclusive). So the rows we set are jj-1, jj-2, ... jj - r[kk]. \n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Let me test with a small grid for program1:\n\n            n=2, m=1, grid:\n                row0: '*' \n                row1: 'o'\n\n            We read row0: \n                a = ['*'] -> for kk=0: it's a stone -> r[0] becomes 1, and a[0] becomes '.' -> then we append a = ['.'] to mat.\n\n            Then we read row1:\n                a = ['o'] -> for kk=0: it's an obstacle -> then we enter the while r[0] (which is 1)\n                then we do: for i in range(1,2): \n                    i=1: mat[1-1][0] = mat[0][0] = '*' -> so the first row becomes '*'.\n                then set r[0]=0.\n\n            Then after processing, we output:\n                mat[0] = '*' -> becomes \"*\"\n                mat[1] = 'o' -> becomes \"o\"\n\n            So the grid:\n                *\n                o\n\n            Which is correct: the stone falls and hits the obstacle, so it stays at the top.\n\n        Another test: \n            n=2, m=1, grid:\n                row0: 'o'\n                row1: '*'\n\n            We read row0: \n                a = ['o'] -> for kk=0: obstacle -> then we do the while: r[0] is 0 -> skip.\n                append ['o'] to mat.\n            Then read row1:\n                a = ['*'] -> then r[0] becomes 1, and a[0] becomes '.' -> append ['.'] to mat.\n            Then after the inner loops, we do:\n                for jj in range(m):  # jj=0\n                    while r[0] (which is 1):\n                        mat[2-1][0] = mat[1][0] = '*' -> so the last row becomes '*'.\n                        r[0] becomes 0.\n\n            Then output:\n                row0: 'o'\n                row1: '*'\n\n            Correct.\n\n        For program2: \n            Test: n=2, s=\"RW\" -> split by W: ['R'] -> then we check: i='R' -> if 'R' and not (True and False) -> not (False) -> True -> set b=1 -> output \"NO\", which is correct because a segment of length1 is impossible.\n\n        Therefore, we output the json."
