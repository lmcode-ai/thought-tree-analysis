And then a_3 = R_3 - L_3 = R_3 - R_2. We see a pattern: \n  a_0 = R_0\n  a_1 = R_1 - R_0\n  a_2 = R_2 - R_1\n  a_3 = R_3 - R_2\n  ...\n  a_{n-1} = R_{n-1} - R_{n-2} but wait, at the last node: \n        a_{n-1} = R_{n-1} - L_{n-1} = 0 - L_{n-1} = -L_{n-1}   (since R_{n-1}=0)\n        and from the pattern: a_{n-1} = 0 - R_{n-2}   -> so L_{n-1} = R_{n-2} But also from the conservation at node n-1: \n        Entries: R_{n-2} (from node n-2) \n        Leaves: L_{n-1} (to node n-2) And we end at 0? so we must leave node n-1? unless we end at n-1? but we end at 0. So we must leave. Therefore, the equation is:\n            R_{n-2} = L_{n-1}   -> which matches. Therefore, we have:\n  a_0 = R_0\n  a_1 = R_1 - R_0\n  a_2 = R_2 - R_1\n  ...\n  a_{n-1} = - R_{n-2}   (because R_{n-1}=0, so a_{n-1} = -L_{n-1} = -R_{n-2})\n\nBut note: we can express R_0, R_1, ... R_{n-2} in terms of the a_i:\n\n  R_0 = a_0\n  R_1 = a_0 + a_1\n  R_2 = a_0 + a_1 + a_2\n  ... R_i = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_i   for i from 0 to n-2. And then for the last element:\n  a_{n-1} = - R_{n-2} = - (a_0+a_1+...+a_{n-2}) But wait, that would imply that the entire prefix sum for the last element must be the negative of the last element? Actually, we have:\n  a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{n-1} = 0? Because: \n      R_0 = a_0\n      R_1 = a_0+a_1\n      ...\n      R_{n-2} = a_0+...+a_{n-2}\n      and then a_{n-1} = - (a_0+...+a_{n-2}) so the total sum = (a_0+...+a_{n-2}) + a_{n-1} = (a_0+...+a_{n-2}) - (a_0+...+a_{n-2}) = 0. But note: we also have the condition that the walk must be nonnegative?",

R_0 = 1.\n        L_1 = 1 (from the last left move from1 to0). R_1 = 1 (the right move from1 to2). L_2 = 1 (the left move from2 to1). Then for node1: \n            Entries: R_0 (from0) =1, and also from2: L_2=1 -> total entries=2.\n            Leaves: R_1=1 (to2) and L_1=1 (to0) -> total leaves=2.\n        -> holds. So the conditions are indeed the two. But note: what if the array has only one element? n=1: array a0. Conditions:\n            Condition1: total sum = a0 =0.\n            Condition2: there is no prefix for n-2 = -1? so we only require condition1. How to achieve a0=0? We start at0 and do nothing -> valid. If a0!=0, then condition1 fails -> \"No\". What if n=2?\n        Conditions:\n            Condition1: a0+a1=0. Condition2: prefix0 = a0>=0. Then a1 = -a0. Example: a0=1, a1=-1 -> valid. Therefore, the code for program1.py should be:\n\n      for _ in [0]*int(input()):\n          input()\n          n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n          s = 0\n          valid = 1\n          for i in range(len(n)):\n              s += n[i]\n              if s < 0:   # condition2 fails\n                  valid = 0\n          if s != 0:       # condition1 fails\n              valid = 0\n\n          # But note: condition2 only requires nonnegative for indices 0 to len(n)-2?",

The problem: for n=2, the condition2 only requires the prefix0 (which is a0) to be nonnegative. So we should break the loop early? We can do:\n\n          s = 0\n          valid = 1\n          for i in range(len(n)-1):   # only up to the second last element\n              s += n[i]\n              if s < 0:\n                  valid = 0\n                  break\n          s += n[-1]   # now s is the total\n          if s != 0:\n              valid = 0\n\n          But note: if we break early, we haven't computed the total.

But the condition2 requires that the prefix sums from0 to n-2 are nonnegative, but it doesn't forbid positive. However, the example [0,1,-1] is not valid, and in the code: \n        s=0 -> f=1. s=0+1=1 -> then we have f=1 and s>0 -> so m=1 and break -> \"No\", which is correct. But what about [1,-1,0]? s=1 -> f=0. s=1-1=0 -> f=1. s=0+0=0 -> then no m.\n        -> (m or not f) = (0 or 0) ->0 -> \"Yes\"\n\n  [1,-1,0] is valid? total sum=0. prefix0=1>=0.\n        prefix1=0>=0.\n        -> valid. How to do it? Start at0. Right: a0=1 -> index1. Left: a1=-1 -> index0. [a0=1, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then we are at0. Then we do nothing? -> then a2=0 -> matches. But the array is [1,-1,0] -> matches. Therefore, the code might be:\n\n      for i in n:\n          s+=i\n          if s<0: \n              m=1\n              break\n          if s==0:\n              f=1\n          if f and s>0:\n              m=1\n              break\n\n  But what about [0,0,1,-1]? \n        s=0 -> f=1. s=0+0=0 -> f remains 1.\n        s=0+1=1 -> then f is 1 and s>0 -> m=1 -> break -> \"No\". But [0,0,1,-1] should be invalid? Condition: a0=0, then we have a1=0, a2=1, a3=-1. We never leave0? then a1, a2, a3 should be0 -> not matching. If we leave0, then a0 becomes at least 1, but we need a0=0 -> impossible. So it is invalid. But what about [0,0,0,0]? \n        s=0 -> f=1. s=0 -> f=1. s=0 -> f=1. s=0 -> f=1. then no m -> (m or not f)= (0 or 0) ->0 -> \"Yes\" And [0,0,0,1]? \n        s=0 -> f=1. s=0 -> f=1. s=0 -> f=1. s=1 -> then f=1 and s>0 -> m=1 -> \"No\"\n\n  [0,0,0,1] has total sum=1 -> invalid. Therefore, the code provided (with the TODO filled as setting m=1 and break on s<0) and the existing if's might be checking:\n\n      - If at any point the prefix sum becomes negative -> invalid (m=1).\n      - If after having seen a zero prefix we see a positive prefix -> invalid (m=1).\n      - At the end, if we never saw a zero prefix (f==0) -> invalid.

And from node1: we have L_2 = R_1 -> and then a1 = R_1 - L_1 = R_1 - R_0. So we have:\n        a0 = R_0. a1 = R_1 - R_0. a2 = - R_1. Then the total sum: a0+a1+a2 = R_0 + (R_1-R_0) + (-R_1) = 0 -> holds. Now, we can solve:\n        R_0 = a0. R_1 = a0 + a1. [from a1 = R_1 - a0 -> R_1 = a0+a1]\n        a2 = - (a0+a1). But also, we require nonnegativity: R_0 = a0 >=0. R_1 = a0+a1 >=0. And the last element: a2 = - (a0+a1) must match. For [1,0,-1]: \n        a0=1>=0 -> ok.\n        a0+a1=1+0=1>=0 -> ok.\n        a2 should be -1, which equals - (a0+a1) = -1 -> matches. But then why did the conservation at node1 fail earlier? We had: R_0 = 1, L_1 = R_0 = 1. R_1 = a0+a1 = 1. L_2 = R_1 = 1. Then the equation for node1: R_0 + L_2 = 1+1 = 2, and R_1+L_1=1+1=2 -> holds. So it should be possible. How to do it? Start at 0. Right: a0=1, then at 1. [state: a0=1, a1=0, a2=0] Right: a1=1, then at 2. [a0=1, a1=1, a2=0] -> but we need a1=0. Then left: a2=-1, then at 1. [a0=1, a1=1, a2=-1] -> not matching.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are processing multiple test cases. For each test case, we have an array `n` of integers.\nWe are using variables:\n  s: a running total (prefix sum) of the array elements.\n  f: a flag that becomes 1 once we have encountered a point where the prefix sum becomes 0 (after having been non-zero?).\n  m: a flag that becomes 1 if after having set f=1 (i.e., after a zero prefix) we get a positive prefix sum.\n\nThe current code has a TODO at the line: if s<0: \n\nWe note the problem description: We start at the first element (all zeros) and we can do two operations. The operations change the current element and move the pointer. The key constraint is that at the end the pointer must be at the first element.\n\nWe can think of the operations as:\n  Operation 1: (if not last) current element +=1, then move right.\n  Operation 2: (if not first) current element -=1, then move left.\n\nWe are to determine if we can get the array `a` and end at the first element.\n\nInsight:\nLet the array be a[0], a[1], ... a[n-1]. Consider the operations:\n\nWe can model the entire process as a sequence of moves. Note that every time we move right we add 1 to the current element, and every time we move left we subtract 1. However, note that the operations are constrained by the position.\n\nWe can think of the net effect on the array. The operations form a sequence of steps. The pointer starts at index0 and must end at index0.\n\nLet x_i be the number of times we move from i to i+1 (right move) and y_i be the number of times we move from i to i-1 (left move). Note that for the first element we cannot have a left move (so y0=0) and for the last element we cannot have a right move (so x_{n-1}=0).\n\nThe net effect at index i:\n  For i=0: \n      We start at 0. We do x0 right moves (each adds 1) and then we also have y1 left moves that come from index1 to index0 (each subtracts 1 at index1 and then we are at index0, but note that when we leave index0 we add 1 and then when we come back we subtract 1 from index1 and then add 1 at index0? Actually, let's break down:\n\nActually, each time we leave an index we change it and then move. So:\n\nAt index0:\n  We start at 0. Then we do:\n    Right moves: each time we add 1 and leave -> so we do x0 right moves: total added = x0.\n    Left moves: we can only come to index0 from index1. Each time we come from index1, we have just subtracted 1 at index1 and then we are at index0. But note that when we are at index1 and move left, we subtract 1 at index1 and then move to index0. This does not directly change index0. However, when we leave index0 again (if we do) we will add 1 again? \n\nAlternatively, we can model the net effect:\n\nThe value at index i is:\n  a[i] = (number of times we entered i from the left) - (number of times we left i to the right) \n        + (number of times we entered i from the right) - (number of times we left i to the left)\n\nBut note: \n  When we move right from i to i+1: we add 1 to a[i] and then move.\n  When we move left from i to i-1: we subtract 1 from a[i] and then move.\n\nAlso, the number of times we enter i from the left is the same as the number of times we leave i-1 to the right (call that x_{i-1}), and the number of times we enter i from the right is the same as the number of times we leave i+1 to the left (call that y_{i+1}).\n\nBut note the moves:\n\nAt index0:\n  Entries: \n      Start at index0: that counts as an entry? Actually, we start at index0 and then we do moves.\n  We leave index0 to the right: x0 times -> each time we add 1 and leave.\n  We enter index0 from the right: y1 times (from index1) -> each time we subtract 1 at index1 and then move to index0, but note that when we enter index0 we don't change it? Actually, the operation that moves from index1 to index0: we are at index1, we subtract 1 from index1 and then move to index0. So that operation does not change index0.\n\nTherefore, the value at index0 is only changed by the right moves: we add 1 each time we leave to the right. But note that we also have to account for the fact that we might come back? Actually, when we come back from index1 to index0, we don't change index0. Then when we leave again we add 1 again? So the net at index0 is the number of times we left index0 to the right (which is x0) minus the number of times we came back from index1 to index0? But wait, when we come back we don't change index0. So the value at index0 is just x0.\n\nSimilarly, at index1:\n  We enter from index0: x0 times -> each time we leave index0 we add 1 at index0 and then move to index1. Then at index1, we can leave to the right (x1 times) which adds 1 at index1 and then moves, or leave to the left (y1 times) which subtracts 1 at index1 and moves back to index0.\n  So the value at index1 is: x0 (from the entries: because each time we come from the left we don't change index1 at the moment of entry) but then we subtract for the left moves and add for the right moves? Actually, no: the operations that occur at index1 are:\n      When we are at index1 and we move right: we add 1 and then move -> so that adds 1 to index1 and then leaves.\n      When we are at index1 and we move left: we subtract 1 and then move -> so that subtracts 1 from index1 and then leaves.\n\n  But note: we also have the initial entry? Actually, the value at index1 is the net effect of the operations that started at index1: \n      We have x0 times we entered from the left (without changing index1 at the moment of entry) and then we did some operations at index1: \n          We did x1 right moves (each adds 1) and y1 left moves (each subtracts 1).\n  So a[1] = x0 + x1 - y1.\n\nBut wait, what about the times we come back? Actually, we might come back from index2 to index1? Then we would have an entry from the right? \n\nLet me define:\n  Let R_i = number of times we move from i to i+1 (right moves at i)\n  Let L_i = number of times we move from i to i-1 (left moves at i)\n\nThen the value at index i is:\n  a[i] = R_i - L_i   ...? \n\nBut note: \n  When we are at i and we move right: we do a[i] += 1 and then move to i+1.\n  When we are at i and we move left: we do a[i] -= 1 and then move to i-1.\n\nSo the net change at i is the number of right moves from i minus the number of left moves from i.\n\nHowever, we must also account for the fact that we start at index0? Actually, the starting state is all zeros. So the entire array is built by these operations.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n  a[0] = R_0 - L_0\n  But note: we cannot move left from index0, so L_0 = 0. Thus a[0] = R_0.\n\nFor i>=1, we have the constraint that the number of times we enter i must equal the number of times we leave i (except for the start and end). However, we start at index0 and end at index0.\n\nThe number of times we enter index0: we start there and then we also come from index1? Actually, we start at index0 and then we leave. Then we come back from index1? The net: \n  The number of times we leave index0: R_0\n  The number of times we enter index0 from the right: L_1 (because from index1 we move left to index0) \n  But we start at index0, so the first time we are at index0 we don't count as an entry? \n\nActually, the entire path must be a walk that starts at 0 and ends at 0. So the net moves: \n  The walk: \n      Start at 0 -> then we do a sequence of moves and end at 0.\n\nThe conservation at each node i (for i from 1 to n-2) is: \n  (number of times we enter i) = (number of times we leave i)\n\nBut how do we enter i? \n  From the left: that is from i-1 by a right move -> that is R_{i-1}\n  From the right: that is from i+1 by a left move -> that is L_{i+1}\n\nHow do we leave i?\n  Right moves: R_i\n  Left moves: L_i\n\nSo: R_{i-1} + L_{i+1} = R_i + L_i.\n\nBut note: we have defined a[i] = R_i - L_i.\n\nWe also have the constraint that we cannot leave the boundaries: \n  L_0 = 0, and R_{n-1}=0.\n\nMoreover, the entire walk must be such that the pointer never goes negative? Actually, the problem does not explicitly say we cannot go beyond the array? But the operations are only defined when the pointer is not at the last element (for right) and not at the first (for left). So we never leave the array [0, n-1].\n\nNow, let's try to express the entire walk:\n\nWe start at 0. We do R_0 right moves (so we go to 1, R_0 times). Then at node1, we have:\n  a[1] = R_1 - L_1.\n\nBut also, the number of times we enter node1 is R_0 (from the left) and L_2 (from the right). And the number of times we leave node1 is R_1 + L_1. So:\n  R_0 + L_2 = R_1 + L_1.\n\nSimilarly, for node0: \n  We start at 0 -> that counts as one entry? Then we leave R_0 times and we enter L_1 times (from node1). And we end at 0? So the net: \n      In the beginning we are at 0 -> count as one entry? \n      Then we leave: R_0 times -> then we come back: L_1 times -> and then we leave again? \n  Actually, the conservation at node0: \n      Entries: 1 (start) + L_1 (from node1)\n      Leaves: R_0 (to node1) \n      And we end at 0? So the last time we are at 0 we don't leave? \n\nAlternatively, we can think of the entire walk as a sequence of events. The net effect at node0 is:\n  We start at 0: that doesn't change the value? Then we do R_0 right moves: each adds 1 at node0 and then leaves. Then we come back L_1 times: each time we come back we don't change node0? Then we leave again? \n\nBut note: the value at node0 is built only by the operations that occur at node0: which are the right moves (each adds 1) and the left moves? But we cannot do left moves at node0. So the value at node0 is R_0.\n\nSimilarly, the value at node i is R_i - L_i.\n\nNow, the entire walk must end at 0. The last step must be a left move from node1 to node0? So the last step is a left move from node1 to node0. That means that the last operation at node1 is a left move (so we subtract 1 at node1 and then move to node0). \n\nBut note: we end at node0. So the entire walk must have the property that the net moves: \n  The total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves? \n\nActually, the entire walk: \n  Start at 0, then we do a sequence of moves and end at 0. So the net displacement is 0. Therefore, the total right moves must equal the total left moves.\n\nBut note: the moves are constrained to the array. We cannot go beyond the boundaries. So the walk is confined to [0, n-1].\n\nNow, we can write:\n  a[0] = R_0 - L_0 = R_0   (since L_0=0)\n  a[1] = R_1 - L_1\n  a[2] = R_2 - L_2\n  ...\n  a[n-1] = R_{n-1} - L_{n-1} = - L_{n-1}   (since R_{n-1}=0)\n\nAnd the conservation equations for nodes 1 to n-2:\n  For i=1: R_0 + L_2 = R_1 + L_1   -> R_0 + L_2 = R_1 + L_1\n  For i=2: R_1 + L_3 = R_2 + L_2\n  ...\n\nAnd for the last node (n-1): \n  We have: \n      Entries: from n-2 (right moves) -> R_{n-2}\n      Leaves: only left moves? -> L_{n-1} (and we cannot do right moves at n-1)\n      So: R_{n-2} = L_{n-1}   [because we start at n-1 only by entry and then we leave L_{n-1} times? and we end at n-1? but we must end at 0, so we leave n-1 by left moves?]\n\nBut note: we end at 0, so we must leave n-1? Actually, we might not even go to n-1? \n\nAlternatively, we can use the net moves:\n\nWe have the entire walk: \n  The net displacement: \n      (R_0 - L_1) + (R_1 - L_2) + ... + (R_{n-1} - L_n) ... but wait, we don't have L_n.\n\nActually, we can express the position as:\n  position = (number of right moves) - (number of left moves) = 0 at the end.\n\nBut note: we are confined to [0, n-1]. The total right moves must equal the total left moves.\n\nBut we have a system of equations. How can we solve?\n\nWe can express L_i in terms of R_i and a_i: \n  Since a_i = R_i - L_i, then L_i = R_i - a_i.\n\nNow, let's write the conservation at node1:\n  R_0 + L_2 = R_1 + L_1\n  => R_0 + (R_2 - a_2) = R_1 + (R_1 - a_1)   [because L_1 = R_1 - a_1, and L_2 = R_2 - a_2]\n  => R_0 + R_2 - a_2 = 2*R_1 - a_1\n\nBut we don't know R_i. \n\nAlternatively, we can try to express everything in terms of R_0 and the a_i.\n\nWe know:\n  a_0 = R_0.\n\nAt node0: \n  Entries: 1 (start) + L_1\n  Leaves: R_0\n  And we end at 0? So the last time we are at 0 we don't leave? Actually, we end at 0 so we don't leave again. But the start is an entry? \n\nWe can model the entire walk as:\n  The number of times we are at node0: \n      We start at 0 -> count 1\n      Then every time we come from node1 we add 1 (and then we leave again? but we end at 0 so the last time we don't leave).\n\n  The net: \n      The number of times we leave 0 is R_0, and the number of times we enter 0 (after the start) is L_1. \n      So the total times we are at 0 is 1 + L_1, and we leave R_0 times. But we end at 0, so the last time we don't leave. Therefore:\n          1 + L_1 = R_0 + 1   [because we leave R_0 times and we have 1 (start) plus L_1 entries, and then we end at 0 so we have one more stay?] \n      Actually, the equation for node0 is:\n          (1 + L_1) = R_0 + (if we end at 0 then we have one extra stay that doesn't leave? but we started and then left R_0 times and then came back L_1 times and then we end? so the total stays at 0 is 1 (start) + L_1 (returns) and we leave R_0 times (each time we leave we are not at 0) and then at the end we are at 0. So the last stay is not followed by a leave. Therefore, the number of leaves is R_0, and the number of stays is 1+L_1, and the number of stays equals the number of leaves plus 1 (for the final stay). \n      => 1 + L_1 = R_0 + 1   -> L_1 = R_0.\n\nBut from a_0 = R_0, and from a_1 = R_1 - L_1, we have:\n  a_1 = R_1 - R_0.\n\nSimilarly, for node1:\n  Entries: from node0: R_0, and from node2: L_2.\n  Leaves: R_1 (to node2) and L_1 (to node0) = R_0 (since L_1 = R_0).\n  And we end at 0? so we don't necessarily end at node1. The conservation for node1 (if we are not at the end) is: \n        R_0 + L_2 = R_1 + R_0   -> L_2 = R_1.\n\nBut also, a_2 = R_2 - L_2 = R_2 - R_1.\n\nSimilarly, for node2: \n  Entries: R_1 (from node1) and L_3 (from node3)\n  Leaves: R_2 (to node3) and L_2 (to node1) = R_1 (from above)\n  So: R_1 + L_3 = R_2 + R_1  -> L_3 = R_2.\n\nAnd then a_3 = R_3 - L_3 = R_3 - R_2.\n\nWe see a pattern: \n  a_0 = R_0\n  a_1 = R_1 - R_0\n  a_2 = R_2 - R_1\n  a_3 = R_3 - R_2\n  ...\n  a_{n-1} = R_{n-1} - R_{n-2}   but wait, at the last node: \n        a_{n-1} = R_{n-1} - L_{n-1} = 0 - L_{n-1} = -L_{n-1}   (since R_{n-1}=0)\n        and from the pattern: a_{n-1} = 0 - R_{n-2}   -> so L_{n-1} = R_{n-2}\n\nBut also from the conservation at node n-1: \n        Entries: R_{n-2} (from node n-2) \n        Leaves: L_{n-1} (to node n-2) \n        And we end at 0? so we must leave node n-1? unless we end at n-1? but we end at 0. So we must leave. Therefore, the equation is:\n            R_{n-2} = L_{n-1}   -> which matches.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n  a_0 = R_0\n  a_1 = R_1 - R_0\n  a_2 = R_2 - R_1\n  ...\n  a_{n-1} = - R_{n-2}   (because R_{n-1}=0, so a_{n-1} = -L_{n-1} = -R_{n-2})\n\nBut note: we can express R_0, R_1, ... R_{n-2} in terms of the a_i:\n\n  R_0 = a_0\n  R_1 = a_0 + a_1\n  R_2 = a_0 + a_1 + a_2\n  ...\n  R_i = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_i   for i from 0 to n-2.\n\nAnd then for the last element:\n  a_{n-1} = - R_{n-2} = - (a_0+a_1+...+a_{n-2})\n\nBut wait, that would imply that the entire prefix sum for the last element must be the negative of the last element? \n\nActually, we have:\n  a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_{n-1} = 0? \n  Because: \n      R_0 = a_0\n      R_1 = a_0+a_1\n      ...\n      R_{n-2} = a_0+...+a_{n-2}\n      and then a_{n-1} = - (a_0+...+a_{n-2}) \n      so the total sum = (a_0+...+a_{n-2}) + a_{n-1} = (a_0+...+a_{n-2}) - (a_0+...+a_{n-2}) = 0.\n\nBut note: we also have the condition that the walk must be nonnegative? Actually, the pointer never leaves the array, but we must also ensure that we never have a negative number of moves? \n\nMoreover, we must ensure that the R_i are nonnegative? Because the number of moves cannot be negative. \n\nBut note: R_i = prefix sum up to i (for i from 0 to n-2) must be nonnegative? \n\nActually, the problem states that we start at 0 and we can only move right if we are not at the last, and left if we are not at the first. But the walk must be such that we never leave the array. However, we have an additional constraint: the prefix sums must be nonnegative? \n\nWait, consider the condition for the walk: we start at 0 and we are only allowed to move right if we are not at the last? and left if we are not at the first. But the walk must end at 0. \n\nWe have deduced two necessary conditions:\n  1. The total sum of the array must be 0.\n  2. The prefix sums (for i from 0 to n-2) must be nonnegative? \n\nBut note: the last element is fixed by the condition: a_{n-1} = - (prefix sum up to n-2). So condition 1 is automatically satisfied if condition 2 holds? Not exactly: condition 1 is the total sum=0.\n\nBut let me check with the example:\n\nExample 1: [0,0,0,0] -> \n  Condition 1: total sum=0 -> holds.\n  Prefix sums: \n      index0: 0 -> nonnegative.\n      index1: 0 -> nonnegative.\n      index2: 0 -> nonnegative.\n  Then a3 = - (prefix up to index2) = 0 -> matches.\n\nExample 2: [2, -1, -1, 0] (from the note) -> \n  Total sum: 2-1-1+0=0 -> holds.\n  Prefix0: 2 -> nonnegative.\n  Prefix1: 2-1=1 -> nonnegative.\n  Prefix2: 2-1-1=0 -> nonnegative.\n  Then a3 should be - (prefix2) = 0 -> matches.\n\nBut note: the example in the note: \n  The array is [2, -1, -1, 0] -> and the note says it is possible.\n\nHowever, the problem also states that the pointer must end at the first element. In our derivation we assumed that the walk ends at 0. \n\nBut wait: we have the condition that the last step must be a left move from node1 to node0? So the last step is from node1 to node0. Therefore, the last element we are at is node0. \n\nBut what about the entire walk? We have the condition that the prefix sums must be nonnegative? \n\nActually, we must also consider that the walk must not go beyond the array. But we are confined to [0, n-1]. However, the condition we have on the prefix sums (nonnegative) might not be sufficient? \n\nConsider: \n  We have the prefix sums: \n      p0 = a0\n      p1 = a0+a1\n      p2 = a0+a1+a2\n      ...\n      p_{n-1}=0.\n\nBut note: the number of times we are at a node i is not directly the prefix sum? \n\nActually, the condition we have is that the R_i (which are the prefix sums for i from 0 to n-2) must be nonnegative? Because R_i is the number of right moves from i, which must be nonnegative.\n\nSo we require:\n  p_i >= 0 for all i from 0 to n-2.\n\nBut what about the last element? We don't have R_{n-1} (it's 0) and we don't use the prefix sum for the last element? \n\nHowever, note that the prefix sum for the last element is p_{n-1}=0 (by condition 1). \n\nBut what if the prefix sum becomes negative at some point? \n\nExample: \n  n=3, a = [1, -2, 1]\n  Total sum = 0 -> condition 1 holds.\n  Prefix0: 1 (>=0) -> ok.\n  Prefix1: 1-2 = -1 -> negative -> not allowed.\n\nWhy is this not allowed? \n  We start at 0: \n      We do a right move: a0 becomes 1, then we are at index1.\n      Now we want to do two left moves? But we are at index1: we can do a left move: subtract 1 at index1 and move to index0 -> then a1 becomes -1 (but we need -2). Then we are at index0. Then we do a right move again: a0 becomes 2, then at index1 we do a left move: subtract 1 at index1 -> then a1 becomes -2, and we move to index0. Then we are at index0 and we need to end at index0. But then we have a0=2, a1=-2, a2=0 -> but we need a2=1. \n\nAlternatively, we can try to do a right move from index1 to index2? But we have a1=-1 (after the first left move) and then we do a right move: a1 becomes 0 and then we move to index2. Then we do a left move: a2 becomes -1 and then we move to index1. Then we do a left move: a1 becomes -1-1=-2 and then we move to index0. Then we are at index0. Then we have a0=1, a1=-2, a2=-1 -> not matching.\n\nSo it fails.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are:\n  1. The total sum of the array must be 0.\n  2. The prefix sums (from index0 to index_{n-2}) must be nonnegative.\n\nBut note: what about the entire prefix including the last? We know the last prefix is 0 (by condition 1) and we don't require the prefix at the last element to be nonnegative? Actually, the last element is not used in the prefix for the moves? \n\nHowever, we must also note that the walk must be such that we never leave the array? But we are confined to [0, n-1] by the operations. The condition that the prefix sums are nonnegative (for indices 0 to n-2) and the total sum 0 is sufficient? \n\nBut consider: \n  n=2, a = [0,0]\n  Conditions: \n      total sum=0 -> holds.\n      prefix0: 0 -> nonnegative -> so it should be \"Yes\".\n\nHow do we do it? \n  We start at index0. We don't do any move? Then we are done? But we are at index0 and the array is [0,0] -> valid.\n\nAnother: n=2, a=[1,-1]\n  total sum=0 -> holds.\n  prefix0: 1 -> nonnegative -> valid.\n\nBut how? \n  Start at index0: \n      Do a right move: a0 becomes 1, then we are at index1.\n      Then we do a left move: a1 becomes -1, then we move to index0 -> done.\n\nAnother: n=2, a=[2,-2] -> \n  prefix0: 2 -> nonnegative -> valid.\n\nBut: \n  Start at 0: \n      Right: a0=1, then at index1 -> then left: a1=-1, then at index0 -> then right: a0=2, then at index1 -> then left: a1=-2, then at index0 -> done.\n\nBut what about n=3, a=[1,0,-1]?\n  total sum=0 -> holds.\n  prefix0: 1 -> nonnegative.\n  prefix1: 1+0=1 -> nonnegative.\n  Then condition holds -> valid.\n\nHow?\n  Start at 0: \n      Right: a0=1 -> index1.\n      Right: a1=1 -> index2.  [But we need a1=0? so we cannot do that?]\n\nAlternatively:\n  Start at 0: \n      Right: a0=1 -> index1.\n      Left: a1=-1 -> index0.  [Now a1=-1, but we need 0?]\n\nWait, we can do:\n  Start at 0: \n      Right: a0=1 -> index1.  [a0=1, a1=0, a2=0] -> but we are at index1.\n      Then we want to go to index2? \n          Right: a1=1 -> index2.  [a0=1, a1=1, a2=0] -> then we are at index2.\n      Then we do a left move: a2=-1 -> index1.  [a0=1, a1=1, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\nAlternatively, after the first right to index1, we do:\n      Then we do a right move to index2: a1 becomes 1 -> then we are at index2.\n      Then we do a left move: a2 becomes -1 -> then we are at index1. [a0=1, a1=1, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\nBut note: we can do multiple passes.\n\n  Start at 0: \n      Right: a0=1 -> index1.\n      Left: a1=-1 -> index0.  [a0=1, a1=-1, a2=0] -> not matching.\n\n  Then from index0: \n      Right: a0=2 -> index1. \n      Then right: a1=0 -> index2.  [a0=2, a1=0, a2=0] -> then we are at index2.\n      Then left: a2=-1 -> index1.  [a0=2, a1=0, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\nWe need a1=0 and a2=-1? \n\n  Start at 0: \n      Right: a0=1 -> index1.\n      Then we do nothing at index1? we have to move. \n      Then we do a right: a1=1 -> index2.\n      Then we do a left: a2=-1 -> index1. [a0=1, a1=1, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\n  Start at 0: \n      Right: a0=1 -> index1.\n      Then left: a1=-1 -> index0. [a0=1, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then we are at index0.\n      Then right: a0=2 -> index1. \n      Then left: a1=-2 -> index0. [a0=2, a1=-2, a2=0] -> not matching.\n\nIt seems we cannot get [1,0,-1]. \n\nBut wait, the condition: \n  prefix0: 1 -> nonnegative.\n  prefix1: 1+0=1 -> nonnegative.\n  total sum=0.\n\nBut why is it not possible? \n\nThe issue: we have the condition that the last element must be the negative of the prefix sum at n-2? \n  For n=3: \n      a2 = - (prefix1) = - (a0+a1) = - (1+0) = -1 -> matches.\n\nBut the problem is that we cannot achieve the array because the moves at index1 must be such that:\n  a1 = R_1 - L_1 = (a0+a1) - (R_0) ??? \n\nWait, we have:\n  R_0 = a0 = 1.\n  Then a1 = R_1 - L_1, and we also have L_1 = R_0 = 1 (from the equation L_1 = R_0) -> so a1 = R_1 - 1.\n  We need a1=0 -> so R_1=1.\n\nBut then the prefix1 = a0+a1 = 1+0=1, which equals R_1? \n\nBut then how do we get a2? \n  a2 = - R_1 = -1.\n\nBut the moves: \n  We start at 0: \n      R_0=1: so we do one right move: a0 becomes 1, then we are at index1.\n  Then at index1: \n        R_1=1: so we do one right move: a1 becomes 1 (because we add 1) and then move to index2. \n        But we need a1=0? \n\nWe see: we have to do a left move at index1? But we have L_1=1. So we must do one left move at index1. \n\nBut we can do:\n  Start at 0: \n      Right: a0=1 -> index1.  [R_0 done]\n  Then at index1: \n        We do a left move: a1 = a1 - 1 = -1 -> then we move to index0. [This uses L_1=1?] \n        But then we are at index0. Then we do a right move: a0=2 -> index1. [This is an extra R_0? but we only have R_0=1?]\n\nWe see: we have done two right moves from index0? but R_0=1. \n\nSo the issue: we cannot do more than R_0 right moves from index0. \n\nTherefore, the condition we derived is necessary, but we must also have that the moves are consistent? \n\nActually, the derivation assumed the existence of nonnegative integers R_i and L_i satisfying the equations. But we have expressed R_i as the prefix sum up to i? \n\nBut note: R_i = prefix_i? and we require R_i to be nonnegative? \n\nBut in the example [1,0,-1]: \n  R_0 = a0 = 1 -> nonnegative.\n  R_1 = a0+a1 = 1 -> nonnegative.\n\nBut then we have:\n  a1 = R_1 - L_1 -> 0 = 1 - L_1 -> L_1=1.\n\nThen at index1: we have to do one left move. But we also have to do R_1=1 right move? \n\nThe total moves at index1: \n  We enter index1: from index0: R_0=1 time.\n  Then we do: \n        one right move (R_1=1) and one left move (L_1=1) -> total moves at index1: 2 moves? \n  But we only entered once? \n\nThe conservation: \n  Entries: R_0 = 1.\n  Leaves: R_1 + L_1 = 1+1=2 -> 1=2? -> contradiction.\n\nTherefore, we must have the conservation equation: \n  R_0 = R_1 + L_1   [because at index1: entries = R_0, leaves = R_1+L_1] -> 1 = 1+1 -> 1=2 -> false.\n\nSo the condition we missed: \n  For each index i (from 0 to n-1) we have the equation from the walk? \n\nBut we already derived: \n  For i=0: L_1 = R_0 -> 1 = 1 -> holds.\n  For i=1: R_0 = R_1 + L_1 -> 1 = 1 + 1 -> fails.\n\nTherefore, the condition is not only the prefix sums nonnegative and total sum 0, but also the intermediate steps must satisfy the conservation equations? \n\nBut we have expressed the conservation equations and then we got the relations for the a_i? \n\nActually, we have the relations:\n  a0 = R_0\n  a1 = R_1 - L_1 = R_1 - R_0   [because L_1=R_0]\n  => R_1 = a1 + R_0 = a1 + a0.\n\nSimilarly, for i=1: the conservation equation: \n  R_0 = R_1 + L_1 -> R_0 = R_1 + R_0   [because L_1=R_0] -> then 0 = R_1 -> so R_1=0.\n\nBut then a1 = 0 - a0 = -a0.\n\nSo unless a1 = -a0, it fails.\n\nBut that is not the case in [1,0,-1]: a0=1, a1=0 -> then we require R_1=0, but then a1 = 0 - 1 = -1, which is not 0.\n\nTherefore, the conditions we have are:\n  1. The total sum must be 0.\n  2. The prefix sums (for i from 0 to n-2) must be nonnegative? \n  3. And also, the conservation equations must hold? \n\nBut we have already used the conservation equations to derive the relations for the a_i. \n\nSo the necessary and sufficient conditions are:\n  Condition A: The total sum of the array is 0.\n  Condition B: The prefix sums p_i = a0+a1+...+a_i for i in [0, n-2] are >=0.\n  Condition C: The last element a_{n-1} = - (p_{n-2})? -> but condition A implies that p_{n-1}=0, and p_{n-1}=p_{n-2}+a_{n-1}=0 -> a_{n-1} = -p_{n-2}. So condition A and condition B together imply condition C.\n\nBut then why did [1,0,-1] fail? \n  Condition A: 1+0-1=0 -> holds.\n  Condition B: \n        p0 = 1 >=0 -> holds.\n        p1 = 1+0=1 >=0 -> holds.\n  Condition C: a2 = -1, and -p1 = -1 -> holds.\n\nBut the conservation equation at index1 failed.\n\nWhat did we miss? \n\nWe also have the condition that the number of moves at each node must be nonnegative? \n  We have R_0 = 1, R_1 = a0+a1 = 1, and L_1 = R_0 = 1 -> nonnegative.\n\nBut the conservation equation at index1: \n  Entries: R_0 = 1.\n  Leaves: R_1 + L_1 = 1+1=2 -> 1=2 -> fails.\n\nSo we must also have the condition that the prefix sums are not only nonnegative but also the derived moves are consistent with the flow? \n\nSpecifically, the equation for node1: \n  R_0 = R_1 + L_1   -> but we have L_1 = R_0 (from node0) and R_1 = p1 = a0+a1 -> so:\n        R_0 = (a0+a1) + R_0   -> 0 = a0+a1.\n\nTherefore, we require a0+a1=0? \n\nBut that is not true in [1,0,-1] (a0+a1=1).\n\nSo what went wrong in the derivation for node0? \n  We had: \n      At node0: \n          We start at 0 -> count 1.\n          Then we have L_1 times we come back from node1 -> so total stays at 0: 1+L_1.\n          We leave R_0 times.\n          And we end at 0 -> so the last stay doesn't leave. Therefore: \n              1 + L_1 = R_0 + 1   -> L_1 = R_0.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  At node1: \n          Entries: from node0: R_0.\n          Leaves: to node0: L_1, and to node2: R_1.\n          So: R_0 = L_1 + R_1.\n\n  But we have L_1 = R_0, so:\n        R_0 = R_0 + R_1   -> R_1=0.\n\n  Therefore, we require R_1=0, i.e., a0+a1=0.\n\n  Similarly, for node2: \n        Entries: from node1: R_1.\n        Leaves: to node1: L_2, and to node3: R_2 (but node3 doesn't exist in n=3) -> so only leaves to node1: L_2.\n        So: R_1 = L_2.\n        But also a2 = R_2 - L_2 = 0 - L_2 = -L_2 = -R_1 = 0? \n        But we need a2=-1 -> fails.\n\n  Alternatively, for the last node (index2 in a 3-element array), we have:\n        a2 = - L_2, and L_2 = R_1 (from the equation for node1: R_1 = L_2) -> so a2 = -R_1 = - (a0+a1) = -1 -> so we require a0+a1=1.\n\n  But from node1: we require a0+a1=0.\n\n  Contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the conditions are more complex. \n\nLet me reexamine the entire derivation with the correct boundaries:\n\n  For node0: \n        a0 = R_0 - L_0 = R_0   (since L_0=0).\n        Conservation: \n            Entries: 1 (start) + L_1.\n            Leaves: R_0.\n            End at 0: so the last stay is at 0 -> therefore: 1 + L_1 = R_0 + 1   -> L_1 = R_0.\n\n  For node1 (if n>2): \n        a1 = R_1 - L_1.\n        Conservation: \n            Entries: R_0 (from node0) + L_2 (from node2).\n            Leaves: R_1 (to node2) + L_1 (to node0).\n            -> R_0 + L_2 = R_1 + L_1.\n        But L_1 = R_0, so: R_0 + L_2 = R_1 + R_0  -> L_2 = R_1.\n\n  For node2 (which is the last node if n=3): \n        a2 = R_2 - L_2.\n        But we cannot move right from node2 (since it's the last), so R_2=0.\n        -> a2 = - L_2.\n        Conservation at node2: \n            Entries: R_1 (from node1).\n            Leaves: L_2 (to node1) [and we cannot move right].\n            -> R_1 = L_2.\n        So: a2 = - R_1.\n\n  Now, from node1: L_2 = R_1 -> which matches node2.\n\n  And from node1: we have L_2 = R_1 -> and then a1 = R_1 - L_1 = R_1 - R_0.\n\n  So we have:\n        a0 = R_0.\n        a1 = R_1 - R_0.\n        a2 = - R_1.\n\n  Then the total sum: a0+a1+a2 = R_0 + (R_1-R_0) + (-R_1) = 0 -> holds.\n\n  Now, we can solve:\n        R_0 = a0.\n        R_1 = a0 + a1.   [from a1 = R_1 - a0 -> R_1 = a0+a1]\n        a2 = - (a0+a1).\n\n  But also, we require nonnegativity: \n        R_0 = a0 >=0.\n        R_1 = a0+a1 >=0.\n\n  And the last element: a2 = - (a0+a1) must match.\n\n  For [1,0,-1]: \n        a0=1>=0 -> ok.\n        a0+a1=1+0=1>=0 -> ok.\n        a2 should be -1, which equals - (a0+a1) = -1 -> matches.\n\n  But then why did the conservation at node1 fail earlier? \n        We had: R_0 = 1, L_1 = R_0 = 1.\n        R_1 = a0+a1 = 1.\n        L_2 = R_1 = 1.\n        Then the equation for node1: R_0 + L_2 = 1+1 = 2, and R_1+L_1=1+1=2 -> holds.\n\n  So it should be possible.\n\n  How to do it?\n        Start at 0.\n        Right: a0=1, then at 1.  [state: a0=1, a1=0, a2=0]\n        Right: a1=1, then at 2.  [a0=1, a1=1, a2=0] -> but we need a1=0.\n        Then left: a2=-1, then at 1.  [a0=1, a1=1, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\n  Alternatively:\n        Start at 0.\n        Right: a0=1, then at 1.\n        Left: a1=-1, then at 0.  [a0=1, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then we are at 0.\n        Then right: a0=2, then at 1.  [a0=2, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then we do a right: a1=0, then at 2. [a0=2, a1=0, a2=0] -> then left: a2=-1, then at 1. [a0=2, a1=0, a2=-1] -> then left: a1=-1, then at0. [a0=2, a1=-1, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\n  We need to do exactly:\n        R_0=1, R_1=1, L_1=1, L_2=1.\n\n  The sequence of moves:\n        R_0: one right from0->1: a0=1.\n        Then at1: we can do either right or left.\n        We need to do R_1=1 and L_1=1 at node1.\n\n        So: \n            Start at0.\n            Right to1: a0=1, at1.\n            Then left to0: a1=-1, at0.  [This used L_1=1]\n            Then we are at0. We have used R_0=1 and L_1=1. We still need to do R_1=1? \n            But R_1 is a right move from1. We are at0, so we cannot do a right move from1.\n\n        Alternatively, at1 after the first right:\n            Do a right to2: a1=1, at2.  [This is R_1=1]\n            Then left to1: a2=-1, at1.  [This is L_2=1]\n            Then left to0: a1=0, at0.  [This is L_1=1] \n            Then we have: a0=1, a1=0, a2=-1 -> matches.\n\n        Steps:\n            Start: [0,0,0] at0.\n            Right: a0=1, then at1 -> [1,0,0] at1.\n            Right: a1=1, then at2 -> [1,1,0] at2.\n            Left: a2=-1, then at1 -> [1,1,-1] at1.\n            Left: a1=0, then at0 -> [1,0,-1] at0.\n\n        But we ended at0? and the array is [1,0,-1] -> matches.\n\n  So it is possible.\n\n  Therefore, the conditions are:\n        Condition1: The total sum is 0.\n        Condition2: The prefix sums (for i=0 to i=n-2) are nonnegative.\n\n  And that is sufficient.\n\n  Why did the conservation equation for node1 hold in this case?\n        R_0 = 1.\n        L_1 = 1 (from the last left move from1 to0).\n        R_1 = 1 (the right move from1 to2).\n        L_2 = 1 (the left move from2 to1).\n        Then for node1: \n            Entries: R_0 (from0) =1, and also from2: L_2=1 -> total entries=2.\n            Leaves: R_1=1 (to2) and L_1=1 (to0) -> total leaves=2.\n        -> holds.\n\n  So the conditions are indeed the two.\n\n  But note: what if the array has only one element? \n        n=1: array a0.\n        Conditions:\n            Condition1: total sum = a0 =0.\n            Condition2: there is no prefix for n-2 = -1? so we only require condition1.\n        How to achieve a0=0? \n            We start at0 and do nothing -> valid.\n\n        If a0!=0, then condition1 fails -> \"No\".\n\n  What if n=2?\n        Conditions:\n            Condition1: a0+a1=0.\n            Condition2: prefix0 = a0>=0.\n        Then a1 = -a0.\n\n        Example: a0=1, a1=-1 -> valid.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1.py should be:\n\n      for _ in [0]*int(input()):\n          input()\n          n = list(map(int,input().split()))\n          s = 0\n          valid = 1\n          for i in range(len(n)):\n              s += n[i]\n              if s < 0:   # condition2 fails\n                  valid = 0\n          if s != 0:       # condition1 fails\n              valid = 0\n\n          # But note: condition2 only requires nonnegative for indices 0 to len(n)-2? \n          #   In the loop, we are checking for every prefix, including the last.\n          #   The last prefix is the total sum, which must be 0. But we are checking s<0 for every prefix, including the last? \n          #   However, if the total sum is 0, then the last prefix is 0 -> nonnegative, so it's okay.\n          #   But we don't require the last prefix to be positive? we only require nonnegative, and 0 is nonnegative.\n          #   However, the condition2 only applies to the first n-1 elements? \n\n          But wait: in the condition2, we only require the prefix sums for i in [0, n-2] to be nonnegative. \n          The last element is not required to have a nonnegative prefix sum? but the total sum is 0, so the last prefix sum (which is the total) is 0, which is nonnegative. \n          However, the condition2 does not require the last prefix sum to be nonnegative? it only requires up to n-2.\n\n          Example: n=2, a=[0,0]:\n              prefix0: a0=0 -> nonnegative -> valid.\n              prefix1: a0+a1=0 -> nonnegative, but we only require up to index0? \n\n          The problem: for n=2, the condition2 only requires the prefix0 (which is a0) to be nonnegative.\n\n          So we should break the loop early? \n\n          We can do:\n\n          s = 0\n          valid = 1\n          for i in range(len(n)-1):   # only up to the second last element\n              s += n[i]\n              if s < 0:\n                  valid = 0\n                  break\n          s += n[-1]   # now s is the total\n          if s != 0:\n              valid = 0\n\n          But note: if we break early, we haven't computed the total. We can do:\n\n          total = sum(n)\n          if total != 0:\n              valid = 0\n\n          But the problem says the array can be up to 200,000 and the total n over test cases is 200,000, so we can do:\n\n          s = 0\n          nonneg_ok = True\n          for i in range(len(n)-1):\n              s += n[i]\n              if s < 0:\n                  nonneg_ok = False\n          if s + n[-1] != 0 or not nonneg_ok:\n              print(\"No\")\n          else:\n              print(\"Yes\")\n\n  However, the original code provided has:\n\n      s,f,m = 0,0,0\n      for i in n:\n          s+=i\n          if s<0: # TODO: Your code here\n          if s==0:f=1\n          if f and s>0:m=1;break\n      print(\"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2])\n\n  We need to fit into this structure.\n\n  The original code uses:\n      f: becomes 1 if at some point the prefix sum becomes 0.\n      m: becomes 1 if after f became 1 (i.e., after a zero) we get a positive prefix.\n\n  And then it prints \"YNEOS\"[(m or not f)::2] -> \n      If m is 1 or f is 0, then (m or not f) is True -> 1, then \"YNEOS\"[1::2] -> starting at index1, step2: 'N','O' -> \"NO\"\n      Otherwise, \"YNEOS\"[0::2] -> 'Y','E','S' -> \"YES\"\n\n  But note: the original code does not match our conditions.\n\n  Let's analyze the provided code with an example:\n\n      Example [0,0,0,0]:\n          s:0 -> then f=1 (because s==0) -> then we continue.\n          then s remains 0, so no m set.\n          at the end: m=0, f=1 -> (m or not f) = (0 or 0) =0 -> then \"YNEOS\"[0::2] = \"YES\"\n\n      Example [2,-1,-1,0]:\n          s=2 -> then s>0 and f is 0 -> skip.\n          s=2-1=1 -> then s>0 and f is 0 -> skip.\n          s=1-1=0 -> then f=1.\n          s=0+0=0 -> then no m.\n          -> \"YES\"\n\n      Example [1,0,-1] (n=3):\n          s=1 -> f=0, m=0.\n          s=1+0=1 -> then f=0, m=0.\n          s=1-1=0 -> then f=1.\n          -> then (m or not f) = (0 or 0) -> 0 -> \"YES\"\n\n      But what about [1, -2, 1] (which we know is invalid because prefix1=-1<0):\n          s=1 -> then f=0, m=0.\n          s=1-2=-1 -> then we hit the TODO.\n\n  The TODO is at \"if s<0: ...\"\n\n  We need to do something when s<0? \n\n  The original code then sets m=1 and breaks? \n\n  But in the example [1,-2,1]: \n        at the second element: s=-1<0 -> then we break and set m=1? \n        then f is still 0 -> (m or not f) = (1 or 1) = 1 -> \"NO\"\n\n  But what about [0, -1, 1]? \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0-1=-1 -> then we hit s<0 -> then we break and set m=1? \n        then (m or not f) = (1 or 0) = 1 -> \"NO\"\n\n  But is [0,-1,1] valid?\n        total sum=0.\n        prefix0=0 (nonnegative) -> valid for index0.\n        prefix1=0-1=-1 (at index1, which is the second last? for n=3, we require up to index1 (which is the second last) to be nonnegative? -> fails.\n\n  So it should be \"NO\".\n\n  Therefore, the TODO might be: if s<0: then set m=1 and break.\n\n  But also, we have to check the total sum is 0? \n\n  The code currently does not check the total sum? \n\n  The variable f is set to 1 if at any point the prefix sum becomes 0. And at the end, if f is 0 (meaning we never had a prefix sum 0) then we output \"No\". \n\n  Why is that? \n\n  Consider: the total sum must be 0. And if we never have a prefix sum 0 during the entire array, then the total sum might not be 0? \n\n  Example: [1,0,0] -> \n        s=1 -> f=0.\n        s=1+0=1 -> f=0.\n        s=1+0=1 -> f=0.\n        then at the end: f=0 -> (m or not f) = (0 or 1) = 1 -> \"NO\"\n\n  But [1,0,0] has total sum=1, not 0 -> invalid.\n\n  However, what if the array is [0,0,0]? we have f=1 at the first element.\n\n  What if the array is [0,1,-1]? \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0+1=1 -> then we have f=1 and s>0 -> then m=1 and break.\n        -> \"NO\"\n\n  But [0,1,-1] is valid? \n        total sum=0.\n        prefix0=0 -> nonnegative.\n        prefix1=0+1=1 -> nonnegative.\n        -> valid.\n\n  How to do it?\n        Start at0.\n        Right: a0=1 -> index1.  [a0=1, a1=0, a2=0] -> but we have a0=0? \n        We start at0: \n            We do nothing at0? then we are at0. \n            Then we do a right: a0=1 -> index1. [a0=1, a1=0, a2=0] -> then we do a right: a1=1 -> index2. [a0=1, a1=1, a2=0] -> then we do a left: a2=-1 -> index1. [a0=1, a1=1, a2=-1] -> then we do a left: a1=0 -> index0. [a0=1, a1=0, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\n        Alternatively, after the first right to1: \n            Then left: a1=-1 -> index0. [a0=1, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then we are at0.\n            Then right: a0=2 -> index1. [a0=2, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then right: a1=0 -> index2. [a0=2, a1=0, a2=0] -> then left: a2=-1 -> index1. [a0=2, a1=0, a2=-1] -> then left: a1=-1 -> index0. [a0=2, a1=-1, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\n        It seems difficult.\n\n  Let me try with the conditions:\n        a0=0, a1=1, a2=-1.\n        prefix0=0>=0 -> ok.\n        prefix1=0+1=1>=0 -> ok.\n        total sum=0 -> ok.\n\n  How to achieve:\n        Start at0.\n        We are at0. We do a right: a0=1 -> index1.  [a0=1, a1=0, a2=0] -> but we need a0=0.\n\n        We cannot do a right move at0 without changing a0.\n\n        We must do a left move at0? -> not allowed.\n\n        So we do nothing? then a0=0, and we are at0.\n        Then we do a right: a0=1 -> index1.  [a0=1, a1=0, a2=0] -> then we do a left: a1=-1 -> index0. [a0=1, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then we are at0.\n        Then we do a right: a0=2 -> index1. [a0=2, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then we do a right: a1=0 -> index2. [a0=2, a1=0, a2=0] -> then we do a left: a2=-1 -> index1. [a0=2, a1=0, a2=-1] -> then we do a left: a1=-1 -> index0. [a0=2, a1=-1, a2=-1] -> not matching.\n\n  It seems impossible.\n\n  Why? \n        a0 = R_0 = 0.\n        a1 = R_1 - R_0 = R_1 - 0 = R_1 = 1.\n        a2 = - R_1 = -1.\n\n        Then the moves:\n            R_0=0: so we never move right from0 -> so we never leave0? \n            But then how do we get to index1 to do R_1=1? \n\n  Therefore, we must have at least one right move from0 to get to1. \n\n  This indicates a0 must be at least 1 if we ever go to index1.\n\n  So the condition is not only nonnegative prefix sums and total sum 0, but also the first element must be nonnegative and if we have any non-zero move beyond the first element then a0 must be at least 1.\n\n  But wait, in [0,0,0] we have a0=0 and we never leave0? -> valid.\n\n  In [0,1,-1] we need to leave0 to get to1, so we must do a right move from0, which would make a0=1, but we need a0=0.\n\n  Therefore, [0,1,-1] is impossible.\n\n  So the conditions are:\n        Condition1: total sum=0.\n        Condition2: the prefix sums for i=0 to i=n-2 are nonnegative.\n        Condition3: the first element a0 must be >= the number of times we leave0? \n\n  But note: the number of times we leave0 is R_0 = a0.\n\n  In [0,1,-1]: a0=0, so R_0=0 -> we never leave0. Then the entire array must be built without ever leaving0? -> then the array must be [0,0,...,0] and we never move.\n\n  So if a0=0 and there is any non-zero in the array beyond the first element, it is impossible.\n\n  How to incorporate this? \n\n  We see that if the first element is 0, then we cannot leave0. Therefore, the entire array must be zeros.\n\n  In the prefix sum: \n        If a0=0, then the next element a1 must be 0? because we never leave0 so we never change a1.\n\n  Similarly, the whole array must be zero.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n        if a0 < 0: then invalid (because prefix0 = a0<0) -> we already check in the loop.\n\n        if a0==0, then we should not have any non-zero in the array? because we never leave0.\n\n  But note: we might leave0 and come back? \n        But to leave0, we must do a right move, which sets a0=1, but we need a0=0 -> impossible.\n\n  Therefore, if a0==0, then the entire array must be zeros.\n\n  In the prefix sum: \n        We require the prefix sums to be nonnegative, and the total sum=0.\n        If a0=0, then the next prefix1 = a0+a1 = a1, which must be>=0, and then a2 = - (a0+a1) = -a1, and so on.\n\n        But also, we never leave0, so the only way is if the entire array is zero.\n\n  Therefore, in the code, after the loop, we also need to check that if we ever had a positive prefix sum (which would indicate we left0) then a0 must be positive? \n\n  Alternatively, we can note that the first element a0 must be >=0 (by the first prefix) and if a0>0 then we can leave0, but if a0==0 then we cannot leave0, so the rest must be0.\n\n  In the provided code structure:\n\n      s,f,m = 0,0,0\n      for i in n:\n          s+=i\n          if s<0: \n              m=1   # or break immediately? \n              break\n          if s==0:\n              f=1   # we have seen a zero prefix\n          if f and s>0:   # after seeing a zero, we see a positive -> this is not allowed? \n              m=1\n              break\n\n      Then at the end, if m is set or if f is not set (meaning we never saw a zero prefix) then \"No\", else \"Yes\".\n\n  But why after seeing a zero prefix we cannot have a positive? \n\n  Consider: the total sum must be0. If we see a zero prefix at some point, then later the prefix sum becomes positive, then later it must come back to0. But the condition2 requires that the prefix sums from0 to n-2 are nonnegative, but it doesn't forbid positive. \n\n  However, the example [0,1,-1] is not valid, and in the code: \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0+1=1 -> then we have f=1 and s>0 -> so m=1 and break -> \"No\", which is correct.\n\n  But what about [1,-1,0]? \n        s=1 -> f=0.\n        s=1-1=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0+0=0 -> then no m.\n        -> (m or not f) = (0 or 0) ->0 -> \"Yes\"\n\n  [1,-1,0] is valid? \n        total sum=0.\n        prefix0=1>=0.\n        prefix1=0>=0.\n        -> valid.\n\n  How to do it?\n        Start at0.\n        Right: a0=1 -> index1.\n        Left: a1=-1 -> index0.  [a0=1, a1=-1, a2=0] -> then we are at0.\n        Then we do nothing? -> then a2=0 -> matches.\n\n  But the array is [1,-1,0] -> matches.\n\n  Therefore, the code might be:\n\n      for i in n:\n          s+=i\n          if s<0: \n              m=1\n              break\n          if s==0:\n              f=1\n          if f and s>0:\n              m=1\n              break\n\n  But what about [0,0,1,-1]? \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0+0=0 -> f remains 1.\n        s=0+1=1 -> then f is 1 and s>0 -> m=1 -> break -> \"No\".\n\n  But [0,0,1,-1] should be invalid? \n        Condition: a0=0, then we have a1=0, a2=1, a3=-1.\n        We never leave0? then a1, a2, a3 should be0 -> not matching.\n\n        If we leave0, then a0 becomes at least 1, but we need a0=0 -> impossible.\n\n  So it is invalid.\n\n  But what about [0,0,0,0]? \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        then no m -> (m or not f)= (0 or 0) ->0 -> \"Yes\"\n\n  And [0,0,0,1]? \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=1 -> then f=1 and s>0 -> m=1 -> \"No\"\n\n  [0,0,0,1] has total sum=1 -> invalid.\n\n  Therefore, the code provided (with the TODO filled as setting m=1 and break on s<0) and the existing if's might be checking:\n\n      - If at any point the prefix sum becomes negative -> invalid (m=1).\n      - If after having seen a zero prefix we see a positive prefix -> invalid (m=1).\n      - At the end, if we never saw a zero prefix (f==0) -> invalid.\n\n  Why is the last condition (f==0) invalid? \n        Because the total sum must be0, so the last prefix sum (the total) is0. But if we never saw a zero prefix during the loop, then the only chance is that the total sum is0 but we never had a zero in between? \n\n        Example: [2,-2] -> \n            s=2 -> f=0.\n            s=0 -> then we set f=1.\n            then we break out of the loop? \n            -> then (m or not f) = (0 or 0) ->0 -> \"Yes\"\n\n        But [2,-2] is valid.\n\n        In [2,-2]: we do see a zero at the end, but not in between.\n\n        The condition in the code: f is set to1 at the last step.\n\n        But what about [2,-1]? \n            s=2 -> f=0.\n            s=1 -> f=0.\n            then at the end: f=0 -> (0 or 1) ->1 -> \"No\", and total sum=1 -> invalid.\n\n        What about [1,1,-2]? \n            s=1 -> f=0.\n            s=2 -> f=0.\n            s=0 -> f=1.\n            -> then (0 or 0) ->0 -> \"Yes\"\n\n        But [1,1,-2]: \n            total sum=0.\n            prefix0=1>=0.\n            prefix1=2>=0.\n            -> valid.\n\n        However, in the code, after seeing the zero at the end, we don't set m because we don't see a positive after a zero? \n\n        But the condition in the code: \"if f and s>0\" -> at the last step, s=0, so not triggered.\n\n        But what if we have [1,1,-2,1]? \n            s=1 -> f=0.\n            s=2 -> f=0.\n            s=0 -> f=1.\n            s=1 -> then f=1 and s>0 -> m=1 -> break -> \"No\"\n\n        [1,1,-2,1]: total sum=1 -> invalid.\n\n  Therefore, the code provided in the TODO might be simply:\n\n        if s<0:\n            m=1\n            break\n\n  And the rest is as is.\n\n  But note: the condition \"if f and s>0\" catches a positive after a zero. Why is that bad? \n\n  Consider the walk: we are at the first element at the end. The entire walk must end at0. But if we have a zero prefix at some point, and then later a positive, then we will have to come back to0. However, the condition2 only requires nonnegative prefix sums up to the second last element. The last element can be anything as long as the total is0? \n\n  But the last element is included in the total. \n\n  However, the condition \"after seeing a zero, we see a positive\" is not necessarily a failure? \n\n  Example: [0,1,-1,0] -> \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=1 -> then we have f=1 and s>0 -> m=1 -> break -> \"No\"\n\n  But [0,1,-1,0] should be invalid because a0=0 and then we have a1=1 which requires leaving0, which would set a0=1, contradiction.\n\n  Example: [1,0,0,-1] -> \n        s=1 -> f=0.\n        s=1+0=1 -> f=0.\n        s=1+0=1 -> f=0.\n        s=1-1=0 -> f=1.\n        -> valid.\n\n  In this example, we never have a positive after a zero? because when we are at the last element, we go from1 to0.\n\n  But what about during the walk? \n        The prefix sums: \n            p0=1\n            p1=1\n            p2=1\n            p3=0\n        We never have a zero before the last? so f is set only at the last.\n\n  Therefore, the condition \"if f and s>0\" is only triggered if after a zero we get a positive in a later prefix (before the last).\n\n  Example: [0,1,0,-1] -> \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=1 -> then f=1 and s>0 -> m=1 -> break -> \"No\"\n\n  [0,1,0,-1]: \n        a0=0 -> then we cannot leave0, so the entire array must be0 -> not valid.\n\n  Therefore, the code might be correct.\n\n  But let me test with the valid example [0,0,0,0]: \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1 (remains 1).\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        no m -> then (m or not f) = (0 or 0) ->0 -> \"Yes\"\n\n  [1,-1,0,0]: \n        s=1 -> f=0.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        -> \"Yes\"\n\n  [0,0,0,0,1]: \n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=0 -> f=1.\n        s=1 -> then f=1 and s>0 -> m=1 -> break -> \"No\"\n\n  [0,0,0,0,1] has total sum=1 -> invalid.\n\n  [0,0,0,0,0]: valid.\n\n  Therefore, the TODO in program1.py is:\n\n        if s<0:\n            m=1\n            break\n\n  But note: the variable 'm' is set to1 and then we break.\n\n  However, the code already has:\n\n        if s<0: # TODO: Your code here\n        if s==0:f=1\n        if f and s>0:m=1;break\n\n  We need to fill the TODO.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        if s<0: \n            m=1 \n            break\n\n  But then the next two if's would be skipped for this iteration? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        if s<0:\n            m=1\n            break\n\n  and leave the rest.\n\n  But note: if s<0, we break immediately.\n\n  This matches.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        m=1\n        break\n\n  But note: the code already has the next two if's. We only need to fill the TODO block.\n\n  So:\n\n        if s<0:\n            m=1\n            break\n\n  But the TODO is only the block under if s<0.\n\n  So we write:\n\n        m = 1\n        break\n\n  However, the variables are already initialized: m=0.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  Now, for program2.py:\n\n  The problem: stamping. Given a string s of 'W', 'R', 'B', determine if it's possible to obtain by stamping.\n\n  The stamp: covers two adjacent cells, and colors them either BR or RB. The stamp can be applied multiple times to the same cell.\n\n  Insight: \n      We can split the string by 'W' because 'W' represents a white cell, which means no stamp has covered it. Therefore, the segments between W's must be made of only 'R' and 'B' and must be independently stampable.\n\n  For a segment (a contiguous substring of 'R' and 'B'):\n\n      - If the segment has odd length, then it's impossible? because each stamp covers two cells.\n\n      - But note: we can stamp multiple times on the same cell. \n\n  However, note the entire segment must be covered by stamps. And the stamp covers two adjacent cells.\n\n  Therefore, the segment must have even length? \n\n  But consider a segment of length 1: \n        \"R\" or \"B\" -> cannot be covered by a stamp (because the stamp covers two cells) -> impossible.\n\n  So a segment of length 1: invalid.\n\n  What about length2: \n        \"RR\": can we make it? \n            We can use the stamp in two ways:\n                BR: not matching.\n                RB: not matching.\n            But we can stamp multiple times? \n            Example: \n                Start: WW -> then we stamp: say RB -> then we have 'R' and 'B'. \n                But we need \"RR\". \n                How about stamping twice on the same pair? \n                    First: RB -> becomes 'R','B'\n                    Then stamp again: if we use BR on the same pair: then 'B' becomes stamped to 'B'? no, the stamping operation recolors both cells. \n                    The stamping operation: \n                         It sets the two cells to either (B,R) or (R,B). \n                    So if we stamp the same pair twice: \n                         First: RB -> then we have R and B.\n                         Then stamp with RB again: then it becomes R and B again? \n                         Or with BR: then it becomes B and R.\n\n                We cannot get \"RR\".\n\n        How to get \"RR\"? \n            We might use overlapping stamps? \n            Example: \n                Cells: 1,2,3 -> we want to make \"RR?\" but we need two R's. \n                We can stamp on (1,2) with RB: then cell1='R', cell2='B'. \n                Then stamp on (2,3) with BR: then cell2 becomes 'R' (because it was 'B' and then we apply BR: the stamp sets the first cell to B and the second to R? but then cell2 is set to R) and cell3='R'. \n                Then we have cell1='R', cell2='R', cell3='R'. -> not two R's.\n\n            Alternatively, we can stamp (1,2) with RB: then (1,2) = 'R','B'. \n            Then stamp (1,2) with BR: then (1,2) becomes 'B','R'. \n            Then we don't have two R's.\n\n        Therefore, it seems impossible to get \"RR\".\n\n        Similarly, \"BB\" is impossible.\n\n        What about \"RB\" or \"BR\"? -> we can do one stamp.\n\n        What about \"RBRB\": \n            We can do:\n                Stamp (1,2) as RB: -> 'R','B'\n                Stamp (3,4) as RB: -> 'R','B' -> then we have \"RBRB\" -> wait, we have 'R','B' for (1,2) and then 'R','B' for (3,4) -> \"RB\" for the first two and \"RB\" for the last two -> \"RBRB\", which is not \"RBRB\" as a contiguous? it is.\n\n        But the example in the problem: \n            \"WRRBW\" -> not possible? \n            The segments: between W's: \"RRB\" -> length=3 -> odd -> invalid.\n\n        The provided examples in the note:\n            Fifth test case: \"BRB\" -> n=3, but the example says: \n                \"WWW\" -> \"WBR\" (stamping the last two) -> then \"BRB\" by stamping the first two? \n                Step1: stamp on (2,3) with RB: -> becomes WW RB -> positions2='R', position3='B'. -> \"WWRB\" -> but the example says \"W RB W\" -> then they stamp the last two of \"WWW\" to get \"W\" and then \"RB\" on the last two -> \"WWRB\" (but the example says \"W RB\" meaning the last two become RB and then the string is of length3: \"W\", \"R\", \"B\" -> \"WRB\").\n                Then they stamp the first two: which are 'W' and 'R'. But the stamp must cover two adjacent cells and must be completely on the cells. And the example says: \n                    \"WWW\" -> step1: stamp on the last two: then we have \"W\", then the last two become \"RB\" -> so the string is \"W\", \"R\", \"B\" -> \"WRB\".\n                Then step2: stamp on the first two: which are 'W' and 'R'. How do you stamp 'W' and 'R'? \n                    The stamp sets them to either BR or RB. \n                    If we use BR: then the first becomes 'B', the second becomes 'R' -> then the string becomes \"B\", \"R\", \"B\" -> \"BRB\".\n\n            So \"BRB\" is possible.\n\n        How is \"BRB\" possible with our segmentation? \n            We split by 'W'? but there is no 'W' in \"BRB\". So the entire string is one segment: \"BRB\", length=3 -> odd -> we would think it's invalid.\n\n        Therefore, we cannot split by 'W' and then require even length? \n\n  New insight: \n      The stamping is similar to a domino. We can do:\n\n          Let d[i] be the color of cell i.\n\n          We can consider the operations as flips? \n\n      Note: \n          The stamp has two types: BR and RB.\n\n          If we look at the pattern: \n              In a stamping, the two cells must be different: one 'B' and one 'R'.\n\n          Therefore, it is impossible to have two adjacent cells with the same color? \n\n      But wait: we can stamp multiple times. \n\n          Example: two stamps on the same pair: \n              First: RB -> then we have R and B.\n              Second: BR -> then we have B and R.\n\n          So the two cells swap but remain different.\n\n          Or: \n              First: RB -> R,B\n              Second: RB again -> R,B (because it sets them to R and B) -> so they remain R and B.\n\n          Therefore, the two cells will always be different after one stamp, and then if we stamp again, they become different again.\n\n          So after any number of stamps, the two cells under a stamp are always different.\n\n      But what if we stamp overlapping? \n          Three cells: i, i+1, i+2.\n          Stamp (i,i+1) with RB: then (R,B) at (i,i+1).\n          Stamp (i+1,i+2) with BR: then at i+1: it was B, then we stamp with BR: the stamp sets the first cell of the pair (which is i+1) to B? and the second to R? -> then i+1 becomes B (but it was B, so unchanged?) and i+2 becomes R.\n\n          But the stamping operation sets both cells to the chosen pattern. \n          So after stamping (i+1,i+2) with BR: \n                cell i+1 becomes 'B' (from the stamp) and cell i+2 becomes 'R'.\n\n          So the entire: \n                cell i: 'R'\n                cell i+1: 'B' (from the first stamp) and then we set it to 'B' again -> 'B'\n                cell i+2: 'R'\n\n          So we have \"R\", \"B\", \"R\" -> which is alternating.\n\n      Therefore, the entire segment must be alternating? \n\n      But note: we can do any number of stamps. \n\n      In fact, the final picture must be such that in any contiguous segment of non-white cells, the length must be at least 1 and the colors must alternate? \n\n      However, consider a segment of length1: \n          We cannot stamp it -> so if there is a segment of length1, it must be already stamped? but the only way is if it was never stamped? but then it would be white. \n\n      Therefore, segments of length1 are impossible.\n\n      For a segment of length>=2: \n          It must be alternating? \n\n      But what about a segment \"BB\": \n          It has two adjacent 'B's -> not alternating -> impossible.\n\n      \"BRR\": \n          positions: \n              0: 'B'\n              1: 'R'\n              2: 'R' -> adjacent at index1 and index2: 'R' and 'R' -> not alternating.\n\n      \"BRB\": \n          'B','R','B' -> alternating.\n\n      So the conditions for a segment:\n          - Length must not be 1.\n          - The colors must alternate (so no two adjacent are the same).\n\n      But note: the entire segment must be alternating, but it can start with either 'B' or 'R'.\n\n      Therefore, the plan for program2.py:\n\n          Split the string by 'W' into segments.\n          For each segment:\n              If the segment is empty, skip.\n              If the segment has length 1 -> invalid.\n              Check if the segment is alternating: \n                  For i in range(len(segment)-1):\n                      if segment[i] == segment[i+1]: then invalid.\n\n          If any segment is invalid, then overall invalid.\n\n      Example from the problem:\n          \"BRB\" -> segment is \"BRB\": \n                'B' and 'R' -> different.\n                'R' and 'B' -> different.\n                -> valid.\n\n          \"WRRBW\": \n              Split: \n                  first: \"\" (before first W) -> skip.\n                  then \"RRB\" (between first and second W) -> \n                      length=3 -> not 1 -> then check alternating: \n                         index0 and1: 'R' and 'R' -> same -> invalid.\n\n          So \"WRRBW\" -> invalid.\n\n      But the problem says: \n          The first test case is explained in the statement -> which is \"BRB\" something, but the example given in the note is \"BRB\" and it is valid.\n\n      The provided code:\n\n          for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n              b=0\n              for i in s[:-1].split('W'):   # s is the string of the test case (including newline, so we do s[:-1] to remove the newline) and then split by 'W'\n                  # TODO: Your code here\n              print('YNEOS'[b::2])\n\n          We need to set b=1 if we find an invalid segment.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              for i in s[:-1].split('W'):\n                  if i == '': \n                      continue\n                  if len(i)==1:\n                      b=1\n                  else:\n                      for j in range(len(i)-1):\n                          if i[j]==i[j+1]:\n                              b=1\n                              break   # break the inner loop, but we can break and then mark and break the outer?
