So we cannot use positive x when prev is negative. Therefore, for prev<=0, we must use negative x. Then the minimal |x| is the smallest integer k such that k > (-prev)/a[j]. That is k = floor((-prev)/a[j]) + 1. But note: we can also use x = - (floor((-prev)/a[j]) + 1). Example: a[j]=2, prev=-3 -> then k_min = floor(3/2)+1 = 1+1 = 2 -> moves=2. But is there a positive x that works? No, because if we set x=1: 2 (which is not < -3). So for prev<=0, the minimal moves is k_min = ceil( (-prev) / a[j] )? (-prev)/a[j] = 3/2 = 1.5 -> ceil(1.5)=2.\n\n        So: \n            if prev > 0: \n                x = 0   -> moves=0, and value=0 (which is < prev) -> then we set the value to 0.\n            else: \n                k = ceil( (-prev) / a[j] ) \n                then x = -k, moves = k.\n\n        But wait: what if we set x = -k, then the value is -k * a[j] = - (ceil( (-prev)/a[j] )) * a[j]. We require: -k * a[j] < prev   => - (ceil( (-prev)/a[j] )) * a[j] < prev   => ceil( (-prev)/a[j] ) * a[j] > -prev   -> which is true by the definition of ceil? Actually: ceil(q) is the smallest integer >= q. Then ceil(q) * a[j] >= q * a[j] = (-prev) -> so ceil(q)*a[j] >= -prev -> then -ceil(q)*a[j] <= prev? But we want < prev? Example: prev=-3, a[j]=2 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> then value = -4, which is less than -3? -> yes. But note: we want the minimal k such that -k * a[j] < prev. -k * a[j] < prev   => k * a[j] > -prev   => k > (-prev)/a[j].",

Yes: because for any real number r, ceil(r) = floor(r)+1 if r is not integer, and ceil(r)=r if integer. And floor(r)+1 is the smallest integer greater than r.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if prev > 0:\n                x = 0   -> moves=0, and then the value set is 0.\n            else:\n                k = ceil( (-prev) / a[j] )   # but note: (-prev) is positive, so we can write: k = ceil( ( -prev ) / a[j] )\n                then x = -k, moves = k.\n\n        However, note: what if we can set a positive x that is negative? No, because we just saw that for prev<=0, positive x doesn't work. But wait: what if we set a positive x that is very large? Then we get a large positive value, which is not less than a negative prev? So the above holds. But note: the code in the right part uses:\n\n    x = ceil( (prev+1) / a[k] )\n\nfor the right part.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given a code snippet that processes multiple test cases. The goal is to find the roundest price (with the most trailing zeros) of the form n * k (with 1<=k<=m) and if there are multiple, choose the maximum such price. If we cannot get more trailing zeros, output n*m.\n\nThe current code factors n into 2^a * 5^b * c. Then it tries to balance the exponents of 2 and 5 by multiplying by 5 (if a>b) or by 2 (if b>a) as long as the factor (t) multiplied by 5 or 2 doesn't exceed m. Then it multiplies by 10 as long as possible (without exceeding m) to add more zeros.\n\nThe missing part is in the case when b>a: we need to multiply by 2 until we balance the exponents (or until we can't because 2*t would exceed m). So we should write:\n\n    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nAfter that, we then multiply by 10 (which is 2*5) as long as 10*t <= m.\n\nBut note: the above while loops only balance the exponents. Then we add as many 10s as possible.\n\nHowever, note that the problem says: if there are several variants with the same number of trailing zeros, we choose the maximum new price. The current code does: \n    output.append(n * (m - (m % t)))\n\nThis is because we are trying to use the largest multiple of t that is at most n*m (which is n * (floor(m/t)*t) = n * (m - (m % t))). But note: if m is a multiple of t, then we use m. Otherwise, we use the largest multiple of t that is <= m.\n\nBut what if we can get the same number of zeros with a larger k? Actually, the factor t we built is the base factor that we must have. Then we can multiply by any integer up to floor(m/t). So the maximum k we can use that is a multiple of t is floor(m/t)*t. Then the price is n * (floor(m/t)*t). This is the maximum price that has at least the same number of zeros as the base factor t.\n\nHowever, note that the base factor t already gives a number with min(a,b) zeros (after balancing) and then we multiplied by 10^something. So the total trailing zeros is the exponent of 10 we added plus the balanced part.\n\nBut the problem says: we want the roundest (max trailing zeros) and if multiple then the maximum price.\n\nThe current approach is:\n1. Factor n: n = 2^a * 5^b * c (with c coprime to 2 and 5).\n2. Balance the exponents: if a>b, we multiply by 5 until a==b or we can't (because 5*t>m). Similarly, if b>a, we multiply by 2 until balanced or can't.\n3. Then multiply by 10 as long as we can (without exceeding m) to add more zeros.\n\nBut note: after step 2, we have a factor t that makes n*t have min(a,b) + (the zeros we added in balancing) zeros? Actually, no: the balancing step adds 5's (if a>b) to make the exponent of 5 equal to a (so then the trailing zeros become a). Similarly, if b>a, we add 2's to make the exponent of 2 equal to b, so then the trailing zeros become b. Then step 3 adds 10's which are 2*5, so each 10 adds one more zero.\n\nBut note: after step 2, we have a factor t that when multiplied by n, the trailing zeros are min(a,b) plus the zeros we added? Actually, after balancing, the exponents of 2 and 5 become equal? Let me see:\n\nCase 1: a > b. Then we add (a-b) fives? Actually, we add as many as we can without exceeding m. So we might not add all. Similarly for the other case.\n\nBut the code does:\n\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1   # now we are increasing the exponent of 5, so we are getting closer to a\n\n    Similarly, for b>a, we do:\n\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nSo after this, the exponents are as balanced as we can get without exceeding m. Then we add as many 10s as possible (which is 2*5) without exceeding m.\n\nBut note: the trailing zeros in n*t (after the balancing) is min(a, b) (which is now the balanced value we reached). Then each 10 we multiply by adds one more zero.\n\nSo the total trailing zeros is: (min(a, b) after balancing) + (the number of 10s we multiplied).\n\nBut note: when we multiply by 10, we are adding one 2 and one 5, so the exponents of 2 and 5 both increase by the same amount. Therefore, the trailing zeros is the total exponent of 2 (which equals the exponent of 5) in the factor t multiplied by n.\n\nHowever, the problem says: if we cannot get a rounder price (meaning more trailing zeros) than the original, then we output n*m.\n\nBut note: the original n has min(a0, b0) trailing zeros (where a0 and b0 are the original exponents). After our process, we have at least min(a0, b0) and possibly more. However, if we cannot add any 5 or 2 or 10, then t remains 1, and we output n * (m - m%1) = n * m. So that matches.\n\nBut what if we can add some 5s but not enough to balance? Then we have more zeros? Actually, we have increased the exponent of 5 (if a0>b0) so the trailing zeros become min(a0, b0 + added) = b0 + added, which is more than the original min(a0, b0). So that's good.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nBut note: the code already has the condition and the loop, we just need to fill the body.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are given an array a of n positive integers. We start with b as zeros. In one move, we can choose an index i and either add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i. We want the minimum number of moves to make b strictly increasing.\n\nThe current code sets up an array a and then iterates for i in range(len(a)). For each i, it initializes an array t (which doesn't seem to be used in the provided snippet) and a variable temp (which counts the moves). Then it does two while loops: one going left from i-1 down to 0, and one going right from i+1 to the end.\n\nThe idea: we are going to fix an index i and assume that we do not change b_i (so b_i remains 0). Then we adjust the left part and the right part.\n\nBut note: the example: \n    Example 1: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> we can do: \n        b1 = -1 (by subtracting 1: one move)\n        b2 remains 0? but then we have -1, 0 -> then we need to adjust the right? \n        Actually, the example says: subtract a1 from b1, and then add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5. So b2 remains 0? \n        Then the array becomes: [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5] -> which is increasing.\n\nBut note: the example does not say anything about b2. The problem allows us to do moves arbitrarily. The example says 4 moves: one for b1 and three for b3, b4, b5.\n\nIn the code, for a fixed i, we are leaving b_i as 0. Then we process the left part: from i-1 down to 0, and the right part: from i+1 to the end.\n\nFor the right part, the code does:\n\n    k = i+1\n    prev = 0   # because the last value we set is at i: 0, so the next value (at k) must be at least 1 (so strictly greater than 0)\n    while k < len(a):\n        x = ceil((prev+1) / a[k])\n        temp += x\n        prev = a[k] * x\n        k += 1\n\nWhat is this doing? \nWe require: b[k] > prev (the previous element). We are going to set b[k] to either ...? Actually, we can do multiple moves: we can add a[k] multiple times or subtract. But note: we can do both? However, we want the minimum moves. The moves for index k: we can set b[k] to any multiple of a[k] (positive or negative). \n\nWe want b[k] > prev. The minimal absolute value we can set b[k] to that is >= prev+1? Actually, we want the smallest nonnegative number of moves? \n\nBut note: we can set b[k] to any multiple. The minimal number of moves to set b[k] to a value that is at least prev+1 is: we need to find the smallest integer x (in absolute value) such that |x| * a[k] >= prev+1? Actually, we can set b[k] to a positive multiple or negative? But we want the minimum moves. \n\nThe moves for index k: if we set b[k] to x * a[k] (where x is an integer, positive or negative) then the number of moves is |x|. We want to minimize |x| such that x * a[k] > prev.\n\nBut note: we can also set to a negative value? However, if we set to a negative value, then we have to set the next indices to even more negative? But then the left part (which we are processing from i to the left) might be negative too. However, the problem does not restrict the sign.\n\nBut the example: we set b1 to -1 (which is -1 * a0: a0=1, so one move: subtract). Then b2 remains 0? Then we set b3 to 3 (which is 1 * a2: a2=3, so one move: add). Similarly for b4 and b5.\n\nBut the code for the right part: \n    x = ceil((prev+1) / a[k])\n    temp += x\n    prev = a[k] * x\n\nWhy ceil? \nWe require: a[k] * x > prev. The smallest positive x that satisfies: a[k] * x >= prev+1. So x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k]). Then we set the value to a[k]*x. Then the next element must be at least a[k]*x + 1.\n\nBut what if we use a negative x? Then we get a negative value. But then the next element would have to be even more negative? However, we are going from left to right and we want increasing. So if we set a negative value, then the next element must be at least that negative value + 1. But we can also set the next element to a negative value that is greater? \n\nBut note: the minimal moves might be achieved by using negative values? However, the problem does not specify that we must use positive moves. But observe: if we set an element to a negative value, then the moves for that element is |x| (if we set it to x * a[k], then |x| moves). \n\nBut the minimal |x| such that x * a[k] > prev: \n    If we use positive x: then x_min = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])\n    If we use negative x: then we set to a negative value. But then we require: negative_value > prev. If prev is positive, then we cannot set a negative value that is greater than a positive. If prev is negative, then we can set x to be a negative integer such that x * a[k] > prev. The smallest |x| (i.e., the largest negative) would be when x is negative and as close to 0 as possible. But note: the condition is x * a[k] > prev. Since a[k] is positive, if we set x to be negative, then x * a[k] is negative. So if prev is negative, then we can set x to be the smallest integer (closest to zero) such that x * a[k] > prev. That would be: x = floor(prev/a[k]) + 1? But note: we are going negative: actually, we can write:\n\n    We require: x * a[k] > prev  => x > prev / a[k]\n\nThe smallest integer x (which could be negative) that is greater than prev/a[k] is: ceil(prev/a[k] + 1e-9)? Actually, the smallest integer greater than a real number r is floor(r)+1? But if r is negative, then floor(r) is the next lower integer.\n\nAlternatively, we can use: \n    x = floor(prev/a[k]) + 1\n\nBut note: if prev is negative, then floor(prev/a[k]) is the next lower integer. Then x = floor(prev/a[k])+1 is the smallest integer greater than prev/a[k]. \n\nBut if we use negative x, then the number of moves is |x| = -x (since x is negative). \n\nHowever, the problem: we are processing from left to right and we want to minimize the total moves. The code currently only considers positive x. Why?\n\nBecause the example: the right part is processed from left to right (starting at i and going right). We set the element at i to 0. Then the next element must be at least 1. Then we set it to the smallest multiple of a[k] that is at least 1. That is positive. Then the next must be at least that positive value + 1, so again positive. So the entire right part will be positive.\n\nSimilarly, for the left part: we process from i-1 down to 0. We require that the element at j must be less than the element at j+1 (which we have set). So we start from i (which is 0) and go left. The element at i-1 must be less than 0. Then the element at i-2 must be less than the element at i-1 (which is negative). So we set them to negative multiples.\n\nThe code for the left part is missing. We have:\n\n    j = i-1\n    prev = 0   # because the element at i is 0, so the element at j (which is to the left) must be less than 0.\n    while j>=0:\n        # TODO\n\nWe need to set the element at j to a multiple of a[j] (by subtracting or adding) such that it is less than prev (which initially is 0). Then the next element to the left must be less than that.\n\nHow to compute the minimal moves for the left? \nWe require: b[j] < prev (the element to the right). We can set b[j] to x * a[j] (with x an integer) such that x * a[j] < prev. The minimal |x| (number of moves) is the minimal absolute value of x satisfying the condition.\n\nWe can use negative x: then we get negative values. The condition: x * a[j] < prev. Since a[j] is positive, if we set x to be negative, then x * a[j] is negative. If prev is positive, then any negative x would work. But we want the minimal |x|? The minimal |x| is 1: set x=-1 -> then b[j] = -a[j]. But is that the minimal? \n\nBut note: we want the minimal moves (which is |x|) and we also want to set the value as close to prev as possible (from below) to make the next constraints easier? Actually, we want the value to be as large as possible (but still less than prev) to minimize the constraints on the next left element. \n\nSo we want the largest multiple of a[j] that is less than prev. How to compute x? \n\nWe require: x * a[j] < prev  => x < prev / a[j]. \n\nThe largest integer x satisfying x < prev/a[j] is floor((prev-1)/a[j])? \n\nBut note: if we set x = floor((prev-1)/a[j]), then x * a[j] <= prev-1 < prev. \n\nBut we can also set x to be negative? However, if we set x to be negative, then we get a negative value. But if prev is positive, then we can set x to be the largest integer less than prev/a[j]. Since prev/a[j] is positive, the largest integer less than that is floor(prev/a[j]) - 1? Actually, no: the integers less than r are ... , floor(r)-1, floor(r) is the greatest integer <= r. But we require strictly less than prev. So we want the greatest integer strictly less than prev. \n\nActually, the largest multiple of a[j] that is strictly less than prev is: \n    Let x = floor((prev-1)/a[j])   -> then the value is x * a[j]. \n\nBut then the number of moves is |x|. However, if x is negative, then |x| = -x. But we want the minimal moves? \n\nBut note: we have two choices: we can set the value to a positive multiple? But if we set to a positive multiple, then we require a positive multiple that is less than prev. But if prev is 0, then we cannot set a positive multiple (because positive multiples are >= a[j] which is positive, so not less than 0). So we must set to a negative multiple.\n\nSo the minimal moves: we want the minimal |x| such that x * a[j] < prev. \n\nBut note: we can also set to a positive multiple that is less than prev? Only if there exists a positive multiple less than prev. But the positive multiples are a[j], 2*a[j], ... and they are all >= a[j]. So if prev <= a[j], then there is no positive multiple less than prev. Then we must use negative.\n\nSo the minimal |x|: \n    We are looking for the integer x such that x * a[j] < prev and |x| is minimized.\n\nBut note: the minimal |x| might be achieved by a negative x? \n\nAlternatively, we can set x to be the floor of (prev-1)/a[j]. Then the value is x * a[j]. Then the moves is |x|. \n\nBut is that minimal? \n\nExample: \n    a[j] = 2, prev = 3.\n    We require x*2 < 3 -> x < 1.5.\n    The integers: x=1 -> 2 (which is not <3? actually 2<3 -> yes) -> then we can set x=1: then value=2, which is less than 3. The moves is 1.\n    But also x=0: 0<3 -> moves 0? But then we don't do any move? That is allowed? \n\nBut note: the initial b[j] is 0. If we do 0 moves, then b[j] remains 0. And 0 < 3 -> satisfies. So that is better.\n\nSo we can set x=0? Then the value is 0, which is less than 3. \n\nBut what if prev=0? Then we require b[j] < 0. Then we cannot set x=0 (because 0 is not <0). Then we must set x=-1: then value=-2, which is less than 0. Moves=1.\n\nSo the minimal x is the largest integer x such that x * a[j] < prev? Actually, we want the minimal |x|. \n\nWe can consider two cases:\n    Case 1: if we can set x=0: then 0<prev -> if prev>0, then x=0 is valid and moves=0.\n    Case 2: if prev<=0, then we cannot set x=0? Actually, if prev is negative, then we require b[j] < prev (a negative number). Then we must set x to be at most floor(prev/a[j])? \n\nBut note: we are processing from right to left. The value at the right is prev. We set the current to x * a[j]. We want x * a[j] < prev.\n\nWe can solve for x: \n    x < prev / a[j]\n\nThe minimal |x|: \n    We can try x0 = floor( (prev-1) / a[j] )   -> then the value is x0 * a[j] and moves |x0|. \n    But is that minimal? \n\nAlternatively, we can consider the two integers around prev/a[j]: \n    Let r = prev / a[j]. \n    We want x < r. \n    The candidate integers: floor(r) and floor(r)-1, ... but we want the one with minimal |x| and satisfying x < r.\n\nBut note: if r is positive, then x=0 is a candidate if 0 < r? Actually, if r>0, then 0 < r -> so x=0 is valid and |x|=0 is minimal.\n\nSo the algorithm for the left part:\n\n    We require: b[j] < prev. \n    We can set b[j] to x * a[j] for any integer x (positive, negative, or zero). \n    We want the minimal |x| such that x * a[j] < prev.\n\n    How to compute x?\n        If we can set x=0 and 0 < prev, then x=0 is best (0 moves).\n        Otherwise, we need to set x to a nonzero value.\n\n    But note: if prev is positive, then x=0 is valid and minimal. \n    If prev is negative, then we require x * a[j] < prev (which is negative). Then we set x to be the smallest integer (in absolute value) that is less than r = prev/a[j]. Since prev and a[j] are positive, r is negative. Then the integers greater than r (and less than 0) are the negative integers that are greater than r. The one with smallest absolute value is the one closest to 0? \n\n    Actually, the minimal |x| such that x * a[j] < prev (with prev negative) is: \n        We require x < r (where r = prev/a[j] is negative). \n        The integers x that are less than r: they are ... , floor(r)-1, floor(r). But we want the one with minimal |x|. The one with minimal |x| would be the one closest to 0? But if we go too close to 0, we might not be less than r. \n\n    Example: a[j]=2, prev=-3 -> r = -3/2 = -1.5. \n        We require x < -1.5. \n        The integers: ... -3, -2, -1. The integers less than -1.5 are -2, -3, ... \n        The one with minimal |x| is -2: |x|=2. \n        But note: we can also set x=-1: then value=-2, which is not less than -3? -> no, because -2 is greater than -3. So we must set x=-2: value=-4, which is less than -3. \n\n    So we need the largest integer that is less than r? That is floor(r) - 1? Actually, the largest integer less than r is floor(r) - 1? No: the integers less than r are all integers <= floor(r). But note: r=-1.5, floor(r)=-2, then integers less than r are integers <= -2. The largest is -2? But -2 is less than -1.5? Actually, -2 < -1.5 -> yes. Then we set x=-2: moves=2.\n\n    How to compute: \n        x = floor(r)   -> but note: r = prev/a[j]. Then x = floor(prev/a[j]) is the largest integer <= r. But we require strictly less than r? Then we must take x = floor( (prev-1) / a[j] )? \n\n    Actually, we can use: \n        x = floor( (prev-1) / a[j] )\n\n    Why? \n        We require: x * a[j] < prev   <=> x < prev/a[j]. \n        The largest integer x satisfying that is floor( (prev-1)/a[j] ). \n\n    But then the moves is |x|. \n\n    However, note: if we set x = floor((prev-1)/a[j]), then the value is x * a[j] and it is the largest multiple of a[j] that is less than prev. \n\n    But is that the minimal moves? \n\n    Consider: we want the minimal |x|. The value x = floor((prev-1)/a[j]) might be negative and have a large absolute value? But note: we are not given a choice: we must set the value to be less than prev. The minimal moves is |x| for that x? \n\n    However, note: we might have two representations: \n        We can set the value to x * a[j] for any x that satisfies the condition. We want the x that minimizes |x|. \n\n    How to compute the minimal |x|? \n        We are looking for an integer x such that x * a[j] < prev, and |x| is minimized.\n\n        The minimal |x| is either:\n            candidate1: x0 = floor( (prev-1) / a[j] )   -> moves1 = |x0|\n            candidate2: ??? \n\n        Actually, note: the set of x satisfying the condition is unbounded below. But the minimal |x| must be one of the integers near 0. \n\n        We can consider:\n            If we can use x=0: then if 0 < prev, we use 0 (moves=0). \n            Else (prev<=0), then we cannot use 0. Then we consider negative x. \n\n            The negative x: we require x * a[j] < prev. \n            The minimal |x| is the smallest positive integer k such that (-k) * a[j] < prev? \n                => -k * a[j] < prev   => k * a[j] > -prev   => k > (-prev)/a[j] \n            So k_min = floor((-prev)/a[j]) + 1? Then x = -k_min, and moves = k_min.\n\n        But note: we can also use positive x? \n            For positive x: we require x * a[j] < prev. \n            If prev is positive, then we can use x=0 (as above). \n            If prev is negative, then positive x would give positive values, which are not less than a negative prev? Actually, positive values are greater than negative numbers. So we cannot use positive x when prev is negative.\n\n        Therefore, for prev<=0, we must use negative x. Then the minimal |x| is the smallest integer k such that k > (-prev)/a[j]. That is k = floor((-prev)/a[j]) + 1. \n\n        But note: we can also use x = - (floor((-prev)/a[j]) + 1). \n\n        Example: a[j]=2, prev=-3 -> then k_min = floor(3/2)+1 = 1+1 = 2 -> moves=2.\n\n        But is there a positive x that works? No, because if we set x=1: 2 (which is not < -3). \n\n        So for prev<=0, the minimal moves is k_min = ceil( (-prev) / a[j] )? \n            (-prev)/a[j] = 3/2 = 1.5 -> ceil(1.5)=2.\n\n        So: \n            if prev > 0: \n                x = 0   -> moves=0, and value=0 (which is < prev) -> then we set the value to 0.\n            else: \n                k = ceil( (-prev) / a[j] ) \n                then x = -k, moves = k.\n\n        But wait: what if we set x = -k, then the value is -k * a[j] = - (ceil( (-prev)/a[j] )) * a[j]. \n        We require: -k * a[j] < prev   => - (ceil( (-prev)/a[j] )) * a[j] < prev   => ceil( (-prev)/a[j] ) * a[j] > -prev   -> which is true by the definition of ceil? \n\n        Actually: ceil(q) is the smallest integer >= q. Then ceil(q) * a[j] >= q * a[j] = (-prev) -> so ceil(q)*a[j] >= -prev -> then -ceil(q)*a[j] <= prev? But we want < prev? \n\n        Example: prev=-3, a[j]=2 -> ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2 -> then value = -4, which is less than -3? -> yes. \n\n        But note: we want the minimal k such that -k * a[j] < prev. \n            -k * a[j] < prev   => k * a[j] > -prev   => k > (-prev)/a[j]. \n        The minimal integer k satisfying that is floor((-prev)/a[j]) + 1. And that is the same as ceil( (-prev)/a[j] )? \n\n        Yes: because for any real number r, ceil(r) = floor(r)+1 if r is not integer, and ceil(r)=r if integer. And floor(r)+1 is the smallest integer greater than r.\n\n        Therefore, we can write:\n\n            if prev > 0:\n                x = 0   -> moves=0, and then the value set is 0.\n            else:\n                k = ceil( (-prev) / a[j] )   # but note: (-prev) is positive, so we can write: k = ceil( ( -prev ) / a[j] )\n                then x = -k, moves = k.\n\n        However, note: what if we can set a positive x that is negative? No, because we just saw that for prev<=0, positive x doesn't work. \n\n        But wait: what if we set a positive x that is very large? Then we get a large positive value, which is not less than a negative prev? \n\n        So the above holds.\n\nBut note: the code in the right part uses:\n\n    x = ceil( (prev+1) / a[k] )\n\nfor the right part. Why? \n    For the right part: we require the value to be at least prev+1. \n    Then the minimal positive x such that x * a[k] >= prev+1 is ceil( (prev+1)/a[k] ).\n\nBut for the left part, we have a different condition: we require the value to be less than prev. \n\nSo for the left part, we can do:\n\n    if prev > 0:\n        # we can set the current to 0 (if we do nothing) and that is less than prev -> moves=0.\n        x_val = 0\n        moves_here = 0\n        # then the value for the next (to the left) must be less than 0? \n        # so we set prev for the next to the left to be 0? \n        # Actually, we set the current element to 0. Then the next element to the left must be less than 0.\n    else:\n        # prev <= 0\n        # we require the current element to be less than prev (which is <=0). \n        # We set the current element to -k * a[j] for k = ceil( (-prev)/a[j] )\n        moves_here = ceil( (-prev) / a[j] )\n        x_val = - moves_here * a[j]   # but note: we don't need the value, we need the moves and the new value for the next constraint.\n\n    Then we update: \n        temp += moves_here\n        # and then the new value for the next (to the left) is x_val? \n        prev = x_val   # because when we move to the next left element, we require that element to be less than x_val.\n\nBut note: the example in the problem: \n    Example 1: n=5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]. The solution: fix i=1 (0-indexed) so that b[1]=0? Then the left element: j=0: a[0]=1, prev=0 (from the element at index1). \n        Since prev=0, we are in the else branch: \n            moves_here = ceil( (0) / 1 ) = ceil(0)=0? -> then we set x_val=0. \n        But then the element at index0 is 0, which is not less than the element at index1 (0)? -> not strictly increasing.\n\n    So we must set the element at index0 to be less than 0. Therefore, we cannot set it to 0. \n\n    Correction: the condition for the left part: we require b[j] < b[j+1]. In this case, the element at j=0 must be less than the element at j+1=1 (which is 0). So we require a value <0. \n\n    Therefore, we must use the else branch: \n        moves_here = ceil( (0) / 1 ) -> but wait: (-prev) = 0? Then ceil(0)=0 -> then we set k=0? Then x_val=0. That is not <0.\n\n    So we must adjust: the condition for the left part: we require the current element to be less than the next element (which is prev). But if we set the current element to 0, then we have 0<0? -> false. \n\n    Therefore, we must set the current element to a value strictly less than prev. \n\n    How to fix? \n        In the left part, we require: b[j] < prev. \n        We cannot set to 0 if prev=0? Then we must set to a negative value. \n\n        So the if condition: if prev>0, then we can set to 0 (which is < prev) -> that works. \n        But if prev<=0, then we set to -k * a[j] for k = ceil( ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] )? \n\n        Why? \n            We require: -k * a[j] < prev. \n            => k * a[j] > -prev   (if we multiply by -1, reverse inequality)\n\n            But note: if prev=0, then we require k * a[j] > 0 -> k>=1. Then k=1. Then the value is -a[j]. \n\n        So for prev=0: \n            k = ceil( (0+1)/a[j] ) = ceil(1/a[j]). Since a[j]>=1, 1/a[j]<=1, so ceil(1/a[j]) = 1. \n\n        Then the value is -a[j] (which is <0). \n\n        Then the moves for that element is 1.\n\n        Then the next element to the left must be less than -a[j]. \n\n        So the algorithm for the left part:\n\n            j = i-1\n            prev = 0   # the element at i is 0\n            while j>=0:\n                if prev > 0:\n                    # we can set the current to 0 with 0 moves? \n                    # but wait: if we set to 0, then 0 < prev (which is positive) -> valid. \n                    # However, note: we are going to set the next element to the left to be less than 0? \n                    # But we don't care about the next until we get there. \n                    moves_here = 0\n                    current_val = 0\n                else:\n                    # prev <= 0\n                    # we require current_val < prev. \n                    # We set current_val = -k * a[j] for k = ceil( ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] )\n                    # Why +1? Because we require: -k * a[j] < prev   => k * a[j] > -prev   -> but note: if we set k0 = ceil( (-prev) / a[j] ), then k0 * a[j] >= -prev, so -k0 * a[j] <= prev? \n                    #   and we want strictly less than prev? \n                    # Actually, we require: k * a[j] > -prev   -> so k0 = ceil( (-prev)/a[j] ) might be exactly the value that gives k0 * a[j] = -prev? Then we need k0+1? \n                    # But note: if (-prev) is divisible by a[j], then ceil( (-prev)/a[j] ) = (-prev)/a[j]. Then k0 * a[j] = -prev -> then -k0 * a[j] = prev -> which is not less than prev. \n                    # Therefore, we must have k0 * a[j] > -prev. \n                    # So we set k = ceil( ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] )? \n                    #   Then k * a[j] >= -prev+1 > -prev -> so -k * a[j] < prev? \n                    #   Actually: k * a[j] >= -prev+1  => -k * a[j] <= prev-1 < prev -> so it is strictly less.\n\n                    k = ceil( ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] )\n                    moves_here = k\n                    current_val = -k * a[j]\n\n                temp += moves_here\n                # set the new prev for the next (to the left) to current_val\n                prev = current_val\n                j -= 1\n\n        But note: the right part uses ceil((prev+1)/a[k]) for the next value. Similarly, for the left part we use ceil( ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] )? \n\n        Example: prev=0, a[j]=1 -> k = ceil( (0+1)/1 ) = ceil(1)=1 -> moves=1, value=-1 -> which is <0 -> good.\n\n        Example: prev=0, a[j]=2 -> k = ceil(1/2)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> moves=1, value=-2.\n\n        Example: prev=-3, a[j]=2 -> k = ceil( (3+1)/2 ) = ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2 -> moves=2, value=-4 -> which is less than -3 -> good.\n\n        But what if we have prev=-4, a[j]=2? \n            k = ceil( (4+1)/2 ) = ceil(5/2)=ceil(2.5)=3 -> moves=3, value=-6 -> which is less than -4 -> good.\n\n        However, is there a way with fewer moves? \n            We require: value < -4. \n            We can set x=-2: then value=-4 -> not less than -4 -> invalid.\n            x=-3: value=-6 -> valid -> moves=3. \n            But can we set x=-1? -> value=-2 -> which is greater than -4 -> invalid.\n            So minimal moves is 3.\n\n        But wait: we can also set to positive? \n            For the left part, if we set to positive, then we get a positive value. But we require the value to be less than -4? -> no positive value is less than -4. \n\n        So the above holds.\n\n        However, note: the condition for the left part: we require the value to be strictly less than prev. The formula we used: k = ceil( ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] ) ensures that the value is at most prev-1? \n\n        Actually: \n            k = ceil( ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] ) \n            => k >= ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] \n            => k * a[j] >= -prev + 1 \n            => -k * a[j] <= prev - 1 \n            => -k * a[j] < prev   (since prev-1 < prev)\n\n        So it is strictly less.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the left part:\n\n            j = i-1\n            prev = 0\n            while j>=0:\n                if prev > 0:\n                    # We can set the current to 0? \n                    # But note: if we set to 0, then 0 < prev -> valid. \n                    moves_here = 0\n                    current_val = 0\n                else:\n                    # We require the current value to be < prev (which is <=0)\n                    # We set k = ceil( ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j] )\n                    k_val = ( -prev + 1 ) / a[j]\n                    # But note: if k_val is an integer, ceil(k_val)=k_val, else ceil to next integer.\n                    # We can use math.ceil, but note: we are in a loop and we have to do integer arithmetic? \n                    # We can use: \n                    #   k = ( -prev + 1 + a[j] - 1 ) // a[j]   ? \n                    # But note: we have to use real division and then ceil? \n                    # Since the numbers can be large, we can do integer ceil?

Then:\n                We leave b[1]=0.\n                Process left: j=0: a[0]=1, prev=0 -> else branch: k = (0)//1 + 1 = 0+1=1 -> moves_here=1, current_val=-1.\n                Then set prev=-1.\n                Then process right: j=2,3,4: \n                    k=2: a[2]=3, prev=0 (from the element at i=1) -> but wait, the right part starts at i+1=2. \n                    The code for the right part: \n                        k=2: x = ceil( (0+1)/3 ) = ceil(1/3)=1 -> moves=1, then set prev=3*1=3.\n                    Then k=3: a[3]=4, x=ceil( (3+1)/4 )=ceil(4/4)=1 -> moves=1, prev=4.\n                    Then k=4: a[4]=5, x=ceil( (4+1)/5 )=ceil(5/5)=1 -> moves=1, prev=5.\n                Total moves = 1 (left) + 1+1+1 (right) = 4 -> which matches.\n\n            Example: i=0: \n                Then we leave b[0]=0.\n                Left: j=-1: none.\n                Right: j=1,2,3,4: \n                    j=1: a[1]=2, prev=0 -> x=ceil( (0+1)/2 )=ceil(0.5)=1 -> moves=1, prev=2.\n                    j=2: a[2]=3, x=ceil( (2+1)/3 )=ceil(1)=1 -> moves=1, prev=3.\n                    j=3: 1, prev=4? -> ceil( (3+1)/4 )=1 -> moves=1, prev=4.\n                    j=4: ceil( (4+1)/5 )=1 -> moves=1.\n                Total moves=4.\n\n            Then we take the minimum over i: both give 4.\n\n        But what about i=2? \n            b[2]=0.\n            Left: j=1,0: \n                j=1: a[1]=2, prev=0 -> else: k = (0)//2+1 = 0+1=1 -> moves=1, value=-2 -> set prev=-2.\n                j=0: a[0]=1, prev=-2 -> else: k = (2)//1+1 = 2+1=3 -> moves=3, value=-3.\n            Right: j=3,4: \n                j=3: a[3]=4, prev=0 -> x=ceil(1/4)=1 -> moves=1, prev=4.\n                j=4: ceil( (4+1)/5 )=1 -> moves=1.\n            Total moves=1+3+1+1=6.\n\n        So the minimum is 4.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            from math import ceil\n            n=int(input())\n            a=list(map(int,input().split()))\n            ans=float(\"inf\")\n            for i in range(len(a)):\n                t=[0]*n   # this array t is not used? we can remove it? but the problem says we start with b_i=0, but we are not storing the entire b, we are just counting moves.\n                temp=0\n                j=i-1\n                prev =0   # because we are leaving b[i] as 0, so the value at i is 0.\n                while j>=0:\n                    if prev > 0:\n                        moves_here = 0\n                        current_val = 0\n                    else:\n                        # Note: (-prev) is nonnegative because prev<=0.\n                        k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\n                        moves_here = k\n                        current_val = -k * a[j]\n                    temp += moves_here\n                    prev = current_val\n                    j -= 1\n\n                k=i+1\n                prev=0   # reset to the value at i (which is 0) for the right part\n                while k<len(a):\n                    # We require the value at k to be at least prev+1.\n                    x = ceil((prev+1)/a[k])\n                    temp += x\n                    prev = a[k] * x   # the value we set at k\n                    k += 1\n                ans=min(ans,temp)\n            print(int(ans))\n\n        But note: the last line in the given code has a typo: \n            ans=min(ans,temp)   -> but the given code has: ans=min(ans,temp)   (without a closing parenthesis) and then print(int(ans)) -> but the given code has: \n                ans=min(ans,temp)   -> actually, the given code has: \n                    ans=min(ans,tempprint(int(ans))   -> that is not valid.\n\n        Actually, the given code ends with:\n            ans=min(ans,temp)\n            print(int(ans))\n\n        But the provided code in the problem has:\n            ans=min(ans,tempprint(int(ans))   -> that is a typo? \n\n        The problem says: \n            ans=min(ans,temp)\n        print(int(ans))\n\n        But the provided code has:\n            ans=min(ans,tempprint(int(ans))\n\n        We must fix that: \n            The last two lines in the for loop should be:\n                ans=min(ans,temp)\n            and then after the for loop: \n                print(int(ans))\n\n        But the provided code has: \n            ans=min(ans,tempprint(int(ans))\n\n        We should change that to:\n            ans = min(ans, temp)\n\n        and then after the for loop: \n            print(int(ans))\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". But the missing code is only the TODO part? \n\n        But the TODO part is only the left while loop? \n\n        But note: the provided code has a typo in the last line of the for loop: \n            ans=min(ans,tempprint(int(ans))\n\n        We are not allowed to change that? \n\n        The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n        But the TODO is only in the left while loop. The rest is given. \n\n        However, the provided code has an error. We must fix the last line? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n        We are only to output the missing code? \n\n        But the missing code is the TODO block. \n\n        However, the TODO block is in the left while loop. \n\n        Therefore, we output only the code for the left while loop? \n\n        But the problem says: the output format is json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\", each containing the completion string.\n\n        For program2.py, the completion string is the code for the TODO block? \n\n        But the TODO block is the entire while loop? \n\n        The given code for program2.py has:\n\n            j=i-1\n            prev =0\n            while j>=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we must fill the entire while loop body? \n\n        Therefore, we write:\n\n            if prev > 0:\n                moves_here = 0\n                current_val = 0\n            else:\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\n                moves_here = k\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\n            temp += moves_here\n            prev = current_val\n            j -= 1\n\n        But note: the last line (j-=1) is already in the provided code? \n\n        Actually, the provided code has:\n\n            while j>=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        and then after the while loop, it has:\n\n            k=i+1\n            ...\n\n        So we must write the body of the while loop. \n\n        But the body must include the update of j? \n\n        The provided code does not have j-=1 in the TODO. \n\n        Actually, the provided code has:\n\n            while j>=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            k=i+1\n\n        So we must include j-=1 in the body? \n\n        Therefore, the code for the while loop body is:\n\n            if prev > 0:\n                moves_here = 0\n                current_val = 0\n            else:\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\n                moves_here = k\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\n            temp += moves_here\n            prev = current_val\n            j -= 1\n\n        But note: the variable names: we use 'k' in the left part, but the right part also uses k. But they are in different scopes (the left part is in the while loop for j, and the right part starts after). \n\n        However, the right part uses k as an index. But we are using k as a temporary variable. That is safe.\n\n        But note: the right part initializes k = i+1. We are not changing that k? \n\n        Actually, the left part is in a different block. \n\n        Therefore, we write the above.\n\n        However, note: the left part uses the variable 'k'. The right part uses k as a loop variable. But the left part is inside the for loop for i and the while loop for j. The right part then reuses k. That is safe.\n\n        So the completion for program2.py is the above block.\n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". And the missing code is the block for the TODO.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"program1\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"            if prev > 0:\\n                moves_here = 0\\n                current_val = 0\\n            else:\\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\\n                moves_here = k\\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\\n            temp += moves_here\\n            prev = current_val\\n            j -= 1\"\n\n        However, for program1.py, the missing code is only two lines? \n\n        The given code for program1.py has:\n\n            elif b > a:\n                while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So we write:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\n        But note: the variable a in the context is the exponent of 2. \n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"program1\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\",\n            \"program2\": \"            if prev > 0:\\n                moves_here = 0\\n                current_val = 0\\n            else:\\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\\n                moves_here = k\\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\\n            temp += moves_here\\n            prev = current_val\\n            j -= 1\"\n\n        But note: the program2.py code must be indented properly. The while loop body is at the same level as the comment TODO. The provided code has 8 spaces for the while loop body? \n\n        Actually, the provided code for program2.py has:\n\n            j=i-1\n            prev =0\n            while j>=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So the TODO is at the same indentation level as the while loop. We will output the code with 12 spaces of indentation? \n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact indentation level. However, the code we output must be inserted exactly at the TODO.\n\n        We output the code as a string. We must use the same indentation level as the surrounding code. \n\n        The surrounding code in the while loop body should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the provided code for program2.py has:\n\n            for i in range(len(a)):\n                t=[0]*n\n                temp=0\n                j=i-1\n                prev =0\n                while j>=0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So the while loop body is indented by 8 spaces. Then the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n        We output the code for the body with 12 spaces of indentation? \n\n        But the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n        We output the string exactly as it would appear in the program. \n\n        Therefore, for program2.py, we output:\n\n            if prev > 0:\n                moves_here = 0\n                current_val = 0\n            else:\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\n                moves_here = k\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\n            temp += moves_here\n            prev = current_val\n            j -= 1\n\n        with each line indented by 12 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not require the exact number of spaces, but the code must run. \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the code with the same indentation as the TODO. Since the TODO is at 8 spaces? Actually, the TODO is a comment at the same level as the while loop body. \n\n        We'll output the code with 8 spaces of indentation? \n\n        Actually, the while loop body must be indented by 4 more than the while. \n\n        The while is at 8 spaces, so the body should be at 12. \n\n        But the problem does not specify. We'll output the code as a string that is exactly the block to replace the TODO.\n\n        We'll use 4 spaces per level. \n\n        The structure:\n\n            for i in ...:   -> 4 spaces\n                ...          -> 8 spaces\n                while j>=0:  -> 8 spaces\n                    [our code] -> 12 spaces\n\n        Therefore, we output the code for program2.py with 12 spaces of indentation for each line. \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that goes in the TODO block, which is the body of the while loop.\n\n        We write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"            if prev > 0:\\n                moves_here = 0\\n                current_val = 0\\n            else:\\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\\n                moves_here = k\\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\\n            temp += moves_here\\n            prev = current_val\\n            j -= 1\"\n\n        This has 12 spaces at the beginning of each logical line? \n\n        Actually, the first line of the block should be at the same indentation as the TODO. The TODO is at 8 spaces? \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            while j>=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So the TODO is at 8+4=12 spaces? \n\n        Then our code should be at 12 spaces. \n\n        But the first line of our block is an if statement: we write \"if prev > 0:\" at 12 spaces. \n\n        Then the inner block: 12+4=16 spaces. \n\n        We output:\n\n            Line1: 12 spaces + \"if prev > 0:\"\n            Line2: 16 spaces + \"moves_here = 0\"\n            Line3: 16 spaces + \"current_val = 0\"\n            Line4: 12 spaces + \"else:\"\n            Line5: 16 spaces + \"k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\"\n            Line6: 16 spaces + \"moves_here = k\"\n            Line7: 16 spaces + \"current_val = -k * a[j]\"\n            Line8: 12 spaces + \"temp += moves_here\"\n            Line9: 12 spaces + \"prev = current_val\"\n            Line10: 12 spaces + \"j -= 1\"\n\n        We can represent that as:\n\n            \"            if prev > 0:\\n                moves_here = 0\\n                current_val = 0\\n            else:\\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\\n                moves_here = k\\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\\n            temp += moves_here\\n            prev = current_val\\n            j -= 1\"\n\n        This uses 12 spaces at the beginning of the if, else, and the non-block lines, and 16 for the inner blocks.\n\n        Similarly, for program1.py, the missing code is two lines at the same indentation as the while loop body. The while loop body is at 8 spaces? \n\n        The provided code:\n\n            elif b > a:\n                while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        So the TODO is at 12 spaces? \n\n        We output:\n\n            \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\n        This has 8 spaces per line? \n\n        Actually, the while loop body should be indented by 4 more than the while. The while is at 8+4=12? \n\n        We write:\n\n            Line1: 12 spaces + \"t *= 2\"\n            Line2: 12 spaces + \"a += 1\"\n\n        So the string: \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\" has 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, 8 spaces is two levels (each level 4). \n\n        But the while is at 12 spaces? \n\n        The structure:\n\n            for ...:   -> 4\n                ...    -> 8\n                if ...: -> 8\n                elif ...: ->8\n                    while ...:  -> 12\n                        [body]  -> 16\n\n        But the provided code has:\n\n            elif b > a:\n                while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n\n        The while is at 12 spaces? Then the body should be at 16. \n\n        But the TODO is at 16? \n\n        Therefore, we should output:\n\n            \"    t *= 2\\n    a += 1\"\n\n        with 4 spaces per level? \n\n        Actually, the provided code for program1.py uses 4 spaces per level. \n\n        The while loop is at 12 spaces (because it is inside the for, the if/elif). \n\n        The body of the while should be at 16 spaces. \n\n        So we write:\n\n            \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\n        because 16 spaces is 4*4=16, which is represented as 8 characters? Actually, 16 spaces is 16 characters. \n\n        But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. We'll use 4 spaces per indent. \n\n        The current code for program1.py has:\n\n            for n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n                # ... comments\n                if a > b:\n                    while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                        t *= 5\n                        b += 1\n                elif b > a:\n                    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                        # TODO\n\n        The body of the first while is two lines: \n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\n        at 16 spaces (relative to the for loop at 4). \n\n        So we do the same for the second while: two lines at 16 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\n        meaning 8 spaces per line? \n\n        Actually, 8 spaces is 8 characters. But we need 16? \n\n        How many spaces are used in the provided program1.py? \n\n        The provided program1.py has:\n\n            for n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n                a = b = 0\n                c = n\n                while c % 2 == 0:\n                    a += 1\n                    c //= 2\n                while c % 5 == 0:\n                    b += 1\n                    c //= 5\n                t = 1\n                if a > b:\n                    while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                        t *= 5\n                        b += 1\n                elif b > a:\n                    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                        # TODO\n\n        The while loops in the factorization are at 8 spaces (one indent) and the body at 12. \n\n        Then the if block: \n            if a>b: \n                while ...:   -> this while is at 8 (if) + 4 = 12 spaces? \n                and the body of the while at 16.\n\n        So the first while body: \n            t *= 5   -> 16 spaces\n            b += 1   -> 16 spaces\n\n        Similarly, the second while body should be 16 spaces.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\n        with 8 spaces per line? But 8*2=16? \n\n        Actually, the string \"        \" is 8 spaces. But we need 16? \n\n        We must output 16 spaces? \n\n        But the problem does not specify. We'll output 8 spaces per indent level, and the body is two levels in: \n\n            for -> 4\n            if -> 8\n            while -> 12\n            body -> 16\n\n        So we output 16 spaces per line? \n\n        We can write:\n\n            \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\n        But that is 16 spaces. \n\n        How many spaces are in the provided example in the first while body? \n            \"                        t *= 5\\n                        b += 1\"\n\n        Actually, the provided code in the problem has:\n\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\n        But that is not 16 spaces. \n\n        The problem's provided code for program1.py is given as:\n\n            from sys import stdin, stderr\n\n            data = [int(x) for x in stdin.read().split()[1:]]\n\n            ns, ms = data[::2], data[1::2]\n\n            output = []\n            for n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n                # n = 2 ** a * 5 ** b * c\n                a = b = 0\n                c = n\n                while c % 2 == 0:\n                    a += 1\n                    c //= 2\n                while c % 5 == 0:\n                    b += 1\n                    c //= 5\n                t = 1  # our result should be a multiple of t\n                if a > b:\n                    while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                        t *= 5\n                        b += 1\n                elif b > a:\n                    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                while 10 * t <= m:\n                    t *= 10\n                #print(n, m, t, file=stderr)\n                output.append(n * (m - (m % t)))\n\n            print('\\n'.join(str(x) for x in output))\n\n        The first while body has:\n\n            \"                        t *= 5\\n                        b += 1\"\n\n        But that is 24 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the for loop is at 4 spaces, the if is at 8, the while is at 12, and the body at 16? \n\n        But the body is written with 20 spaces? \n\n        This is confusing. \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and the provided code in the problem has the first while body at 20 spaces, we output:\n\n            \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\n        meaning 16 spaces? \n\n        But the provided first while body has 20 spaces. \n\n        Let me count:\n\n            The for loop: \n                for n, m in zip(ns, ms):\n            then the code inside: \n                a = b = 0   -> 4 spaces\n                ... \n                if a > b:   -> 4 spaces? \n                    while ...:   -> 8 spaces? \n                        t *= 5   -> 12 spaces? \n\n        But the problem's provided code has:\n\n                if a > b:\n                    while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                        t *= 5\n                        b += 1\n\n        The body is indented by 4 more than the while -> 8+4=12? \n\n        But the problem's code in the message is given with spaces: \n\n            We see:\n\n                if a > b:\n                    while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                        t *= 5\n                        b += 1\n\n        This is 4 spaces for the if, 8 for the while, 12 for the body. \n\n        Therefore, we output for the TODO block in program1.py:\n\n            \"    t *= 2\\n    a += 1\"\n\n        with 4 spaces per level? \n\n        But that would be 4 spaces for the body? \n\n        We need 12 spaces? \n\n        We can output:\n\n            \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\n        meaning 8 spaces per line? \n\n        But 8 is not 12. \n\n        Alternatively, we output exactly as the first while body: \n\n            \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\n        because the first while body is given as:\n\n            \"        t *= 5\\n        b += 1\"\n\n        in the problem's code? \n\n        But the problem's code is given as:\n\n            if a > b:\n                while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                    t *= 5\n                    b += 1\n\n        which is 4,8,12? \n\n        But in the string, we don't see the spaces. \n\n        We'll assume the code uses 4 spaces per indent. \n\n        The structure:\n\n            for -> 4\n            if -> 8\n            while -> 12\n            body -> 16\n\n        So we output 16 spaces? \n\n        But the body of the first while is two lines of 16 spaces. \n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"                t *= 2\\n                a += 1\"\n\n        which is 16 spaces per line. \n\n        But that is 16 characters. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is the body of the while loop. \n\n        We'll do that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can count the spaces in the provided code for the first while body. \n\n        The provided code has:\n\n            while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n                t *= 5\n                b += 1\n\n        This is 8 spaces for the while and 12 for the body? \n\n        But in the string representation, we output the code as it would appear. \n\n        Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we output with the same indentation as the first while body. \n\n        The first while body is:\n\n            \"    t *= 5\\n    b += 1\"\n\n        if the indent is 4 spaces per level. \n\n        But the while is at 8 spaces (two indents) and the body at 12 (three indents). \n\n        So we output for the body:\n\n            \"    t *= 2\\n    a += 1\"\n\n        with 4 spaces per indent, meaning 12 spaces total? \n\n        But the string \"    \" is 4 spaces. \n\n        We need 12 spaces -> three tabs of 4 spaces: \"            \" (12 spaces). \n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n\n        This is 12 spaces at the beginning of each line. \n\n        But the first while body is also 12 spaces. \n\n        So for program1.py, we output:\n\n            \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n\n        and for program2.py, we output:\n\n            \"            if prev > 0:\\n                moves_here = 0\\n                current_val = 0\\n            else:\\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\\n                moves_here = k\\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\\n            temp += moves_here\\n            prev = current_val\\n            j -= 1\"\n\n        This has 12 spaces at the beginning of each line for program2.py, and the inner blocks are at 12+4=16 spaces.\n\n        But wait, the first line of the else block in program2.py is at 12 spaces? \n\n        We have:\n\n            else:\n                k = ...\n\n        The else: is at 12 spaces, and the inner block is at 16.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\", \n                \"program2\": \"            if prev > 0:\\n                moves_here = 0\\n                current_val = 0\\n            else:\\n                k = (-prev) // a[j] + 1\\n                moves_here = k\\n                current_val = -k * a[j]\\n            temp += moves_here\\n            prev = current_val\\n            j -= 1\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2.py code has a line \"j -= 1\" at the end. This is critical to advance the loop.\n\n        We output this."
