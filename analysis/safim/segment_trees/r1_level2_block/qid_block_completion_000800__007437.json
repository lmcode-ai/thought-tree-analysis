Then we check s1==s2 (which is true at start) -> we record. Then we check s1<s2? false. Then s2<s1? false. Then we go to the next iteration: same state -> infinite loop.",

Because: \n                comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1])? \n\n            Let me check: \n                comb(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)

So comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1]) So the code is: d = 0\n                x = 0\n                for z in a:   # a = [a0, a1, ... an]\n                    if z>0:\n                        d = (d + comb(z+x, x+1)) % mod\n                    x += 1\n\n            This is exactly the known solution that we thought earlier: \n                sum_{i} comb(a_i+i, i+1)\n\n            And for [2,1]: \n                i=0: comb(2+0,0+1)=comb(2,1)=2.\n                i=1: comb(1+1,1+1)=comb(2,2)=1.\n                total=3.

But 9**6 is 531441, and the constraints: a_i up to 200000, and n up to 200000, and we have z+x: x is the index in the array a, so x goes from 0 to n (<=200000), and z = a_x, which is up to 200000. So z+x <= 400000. But 9**6 = 531441 > 400000, so it's enough. The combinatorial term: comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] * inv(f[x+1]) * inv(f[z-1]) mod m.\n\n        But wait: the denominator is f[x+1] * f[z-1]? \n            comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] * inv(f[x+1]) * inv(f[z-1])?

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two players, Alice and Bob, eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight each has eaten to be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code snippet for program1.py has a while loop and some conditions. We are to complete the missing part.\n\n Approach for program1.py:\n We are going to use two pointers (left for Alice, right for Bob) and two sums (s1 for Alice, s2 for Bob).\n The idea is:\n   We traverse from both ends. We start with s1 = 0, s2 = 0, and pointers at the beginning (p1=0) and end (p2=n-1).\n   We have a list l2 (which is initially empty) to store the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) whenever s1 == s2.\n\n   The loop condition: while p1 <= p2 (the provided condition is \"p1-1<=p2\", but note that we are incrementing p1 and decrementing p2, so we should use p1<=p2).\n\n   However, the provided condition is: \"while (p1-1<=p2):\" which might be a typo. We should change it to \"while p1 <= p2\" to avoid index errors.\n\n   Steps:\n     - If s1 == s2, then we record the current total candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) in l2. Then we try to add more candies? But note: we can only add from one side at a time? Actually, we have two conditions below that add from left or right. However, if both are equal, we can choose to add from either side? But note: we want to maximize the total, so we should try to continue.\n\n     However, the problem: if we are at equality, we can record the count. But then we must break the tie by adding one candy from one side? The problem is that if we don't move, we get stuck. So we can move the left pointer (or right) to see if we can get another equality later.\n\n     The provided code does:\n        if s1 == s2: \n            # we need to record the current total? and then we do what?\n        if s1 < s2: ... # then add from left\n        if s2 < s1: ... # then add from right\n\n     But note: after the first condition, we might have two conditions that are true? Actually, if we record and then we do nothing? Then we might get stuck. So we should only do one action per iteration.\n\n     Actually, the code has two separate ifs. So if s1==s2, then we record, and then we also check if s1 < s2? But if they are equal, then s1 < s2 is false. Similarly, s2 < s1 is false. So we would break the loop? Because we don't move the pointers? That would cause an infinite loop.\n\n     Therefore, we must move a pointer when we have equality? But note: we can also move one pointer arbitrarily? However, the problem is that we want to maximize the total. We can try to move the left pointer to see if we can get a larger total? But we must be cautious.\n\n     Actually, the standard solution for this problem is:\n\n        ans = 0\n        s1 = 0\n        s2 = 0\n        i = 0\n        j = n-1\n        while i <= j:\n            if s1 == s2:\n                ans = i + (n-1 - j)   # because Alice has eaten [0, i-1] and Bob has eaten [j+1, n-1]\n            if s1 <= s2:\n                s1 += w[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                s2 += w[j]\n                j -= 1\n\n        # Also, if we break because of i>j, we might have an equality at the end? So we check again?\n        # But note: we record every time we have equality. Then we take the maximum? Actually, we are storing in l2? Then we output the last element? But the problem: we want the maximum total candies.\n\n     However, the provided code uses a list l2 and then prints l2[-1]. But note: we are iterating and we might have multiple equalities. We want the last one? Actually, the last one might not be the maximum? But note: as we move the pointers, the total candies eaten (p1 + (n-1-p2)) is increasing? Actually, p1 is increasing and p2 is decreasing, so the total is increasing? But wait: when we record, we have a total. Then we move one pointer and the total increases by one? But then we might break the equality? Then we get a new total when we get equality again? And that total is larger? Actually, the total candies when we record is the current count: Alice has eaten p1 candies (from index0 to p1-1) and Bob has eaten (n-1 - p2) candies (from p2+1 to n-1). So the total is p1 + (n-1-p2). This total is non-decreasing? Actually, each time we add one candy (either from left or right) and then we record when we get equality. The total number of candies eaten at the time of equality is increasing? Actually, we are moving the pointers and the total is increasing by one each time we move? But we don't record every step, only when equal. However, the total candies at the time of equality is the sum of the two counts. And we are moving the pointers one step at a time (so the total candies increases by one each time we move a pointer). But we record only when the sums are equal.\n\n     However, the problem: we want the maximum total. So we should record the maximum total we see when we have equality? But note: the total candies at the time of equality is increasing? Actually, no: because we might have to move both pointers without having an equality? But the total candies is increasing. However, we are storing every time we have equality. Then we take the last one? But the last one might not be the maximum? Actually, the total candies at the time of equality is increasing because we are only adding candies. So the last time we have an equality is the maximum? But consider: we start with 0,0 -> total=0. Then we add one from left: total=1. Then we add one from right: total=2. Then we have an equality? Then we record 2. Then we add one from left: total=3. Then we add one from right: total=4 -> and we have equality again? Then we record 4. So the last one is 4, which is the maximum.\n\n     However, what if we have an equality at 2, then we add from left and then the sums become unequal and then we never get an equality again? Then the last recorded is 2. But we want 2? Because we don't get a higher one.\n\n     Therefore, we can record every time we have an equality and then take the maximum? But the problem says: we are storing in l2 and then printing l2[-1]. But note: the last recorded might not be the maximum? Actually, the total candies at the time of equality is increasing? Because we are only adding candies? The total candies eaten is p1 + (n-1-p2). And p1 is increasing and p2 is decreasing, so the total is increasing. Therefore, the last time we have an equality is the maximum total.\n\n     But wait: what if we have an equality at total T, then we add one from left (so total becomes T+1) and then we add one from right (so total becomes T+2) and then we have an equality again? Then the last one is T+2, which is greater than T. So the last one is the maximum.\n\n     However, what if we have an equality at T, then we add from left and then we have to add many from right to get an equality? Then the total becomes T+1+ (some moves on the right) and then we get an equality at total T+1+k? That total is greater than T? Yes.\n\n     Therefore, we can just record the last equality? Actually, we want the maximum total, and the total is increasing. So the last equality we get is the maximum.\n\n     But note: the loop condition: we break when p1>p2? Actually, the condition is while p1<=p2. So we break when p1>p2. Then the last equality we recorded is the maximum.\n\n     However, the provided code does not record the last equality if we break without having an equality at the last step? For example, we might break when p1>p2 and the last equality was at an earlier step. But we have recorded that in l2. Then we output l2[-1]. But what if there is no equality at all? Then l2 is empty? Then we get an error.\n\n     The problem says: if they cannot eat the same non-zero weight, then output 0. But note: we start with s1=0 and s2=0, which is an equality. Then we record total=0. But the problem says: they must eat at least one candy? Actually, the note: \"For the first test case, ... the answer is 2\". And the third test case: \"there is no way ... so the answer is 0\". So we must output 0 if the only equality is at 0? But note: they haven't eaten any candy? The problem says: they eat candies. So we are not allowed to have 0? Actually, the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\", and 0 is acceptable if no non-zero exists? But note: the problem says \"non-zero\" in the note. So we must not count the 0.\n\n     How to handle? We can record the total candies when s1==s2 and s1>0? But note: we start at 0,0 which is 0. Then we move. We can skip the 0? But what if we never get a positive equality? Then we output 0? Actually, the problem says: print the maximum number of candies. If we never have a positive equality, then we output 0.\n\n     However, the provided code does not have that. We can do: when we record, we record the total only if s1>0? But note: we might have an equality at 0 and then later at a positive, and then we record the positive. Then we output the last one. But if the last one is 0? Then we output 0? But that 0 corresponds to no candies eaten. The problem says: they want to be fair and eat the same total weight. They can choose to eat 0 candies? But the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\". So 0 is the minimum? We want maximum. So we want the maximum total candies for which they are equal. If we have an equality at 0 (0 candies) and then at 2 (2 candies) and then at 4 (4 candies), then the maximum is 4.\n\n     But note: the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\". So we want the maximum total candies for which the two sums are equal. And we are storing the total candies at the time of equality. Then we output the last one? But the last one is the maximum? Because the total is increasing? Yes.\n\n     However, what if we have an equality at 4, then we add one from left and then one from right and then we have an equality at 6? Then we record 6. So the last one is 6.\n\n     But what if we break the loop without having an equality at the end? Then the last recorded is the maximum? Yes.\n\n     However, the problem: we might have an equality at a total T, then we add from left and then we add from right until we break without having an equality? Then the last recorded is T? But we want T? Because we didn't get a higher one.\n\n     Therefore, we can do:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            # record the current total: p1 + (n-1-p2)\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n\n        Then we move: if s1<=s2, we add from left? But note: the condition in the provided code is:\n\n            if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n            if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        But if s1==s2, then both conditions are false. Then we break the loop? Because we don't move? Then we break? But we are in the while loop and we don't move, so we break? Actually, we break the loop? Then we output the last recorded.\n\n        But that is not correct: because we are stuck. We have an equality and then we don't move? Then we break? But we can move one pointer arbitrarily? Actually, we must move to try to get more candies? But if we move, we break the equality? Then we might get a higher equality later? So we should move one pointer? \n\n        How do we break the tie? We can move the left pointer? Because the problem does not specify. The standard solution is to move the left pointer when s1<=s2 (which includes equality) and move the right when s1>s2? \n\n        Actually, the standard solution for \"Two Sum\" style is:\n\n            while (i <= j):\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    ans = i + (n-1 - j)\n                if s1 <= s2:\n                    s1 += arr[i]\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    s2 += arr[j]\n                    j -= 1\n\n        And then after the loop, if we break and the last state was an equality? Actually, we don't check after the loop. But note: we record every time we have an equality during the loop.\n\n        However, the provided code has two separate ifs. So if we have an equality, we record, and then we check: if s1 < s2 -> false, if s2 < s1 -> false. Then we break? Because we don't move? Then we break the loop? That is a problem.\n\n        Therefore, we must change the condition to an if-else? So that we always move at least one pointer per iteration.\n\n        Proposed fix:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                # Then we break the tie by moving the left? But we can also move the right? \n                # Actually, we can move the left because we are going to use the condition: if s1<=s2 then move left? But we have to do one move per iteration.\n\n            Then we do:\n\n                if s1 <= s2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    s2 += l[p2]\n                    p2 -= 1\n\n        But note: the condition above: if s1==s2, then we record and then we do the move: we move the left because s1<=s2 is true? Then we break the equality? Then we continue.\n\n        This is the standard solution.\n\n        However, the provided code has two separate ifs. We must change that to if-elif? Or we can restructure.\n\n        But the problem says: we cannot change the provided code arbitrarily? We are only to fill in the missing part? The missing part is only the block under \"if s1 == s2:\". And the rest is provided.\n\n        But the provided code has:\n\n            if s1 == s2: \n                # TODO: Your code here\n            if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n            if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n        This will cause an infinite loop when s1==s2 because no move is done? Then we break the loop condition? Actually, the loop condition is \"while (p1-1<=p2)\". Initially, p1=0, so p1-1 = -1, and p2>=0, so condition holds. Then we check s1==s2 (which is true at start) -> we record. Then we check s1<s2? false. Then s2<s1? false. Then we go to the next iteration: same state -> infinite loop.\n\n        Therefore, we must change the provided code? But the problem says: we are to complete the missing lines. We are allowed to change only the missing part? But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can also fix the provided code if it's broken? But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: in the if s1==s2 block, we force a move? But then we have to break the condition? \n\n        However, note the condition: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\". We are only to output the missing code for program1 and program2.\n\n        But the provided code for program1 has a while loop and two ifs. We are to complete the block under \"if s1 == s2:\". We cannot change the rest? \n\n        How about: in the block for s1==s2, we record the current total and then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? Then we set s1 and p1? But then the following two ifs might also run? \n\n        Example:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(...)\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            if s1 < s2: ... # now we have increased s1, so if s1 becomes greater than s2? then we skip this.\n            if s2 < s1: ... # then we run this? and we add from the right? \n\n        That would be two moves in one iteration? That is not intended.\n\n        Alternatively, we can change the condition to if-elif? But we are not allowed to change the existing code? \n\n        Another idea: we can break the tie by moving one pointer and then skip the next two ifs? But we cannot break out of the ifs? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                # We break the tie by moving the left pointer? But we must ensure we move at least one pointer to avoid infinite loop.\n                # How about we move the left pointer? Then we break the equality? Then we break out of the if and then the next two ifs will not run? \n                # But if we move the left pointer, then we set s1 and p1, and then we break the equality. Then the next two ifs: \n                #   if s1 < s2: ... -> now s1 is increased? but we don't know if it is less than s2? \n                #   if s2 < s1: ... -> we don't know.\n\n                # But we must avoid the next two ifs? because we already moved? \n\n                # We can set a flag? But we are not allowed to change the rest? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                # We break the tie by moving the left pointer? Then we set s1 and p1, and then we break the equality. \n                # But then the next two ifs might run? and we might move again? \n\n                # Example: \n                #   Initially: s1 = s2 = 0, p1=0, p2=n-1.\n                #   We record 0 (if we record at 0) -> but we don't want 0? \n                #   Then we do: s1 += l[0] -> becomes w0, p1=1.\n                #   Then we check: if s1 < s2? -> w0 < 0? false.\n                #   Then if s2 < s1? -> 0 < w0 -> true? then we do s2 += l[n-1] and p2 becomes n-2.\n                #   Then we have done two moves? \n\n                # That is not intended: we only want to do one move per iteration.\n\n        Therefore, we must change the structure? But we are not allowed to change the provided code? \n\n        Alternatively, we can note that the condition \"while (p1-1<=p2)\" is odd. Why p1-1? It might be a typo. The intended condition is \"while p1 <= p2\". \n\n        But the problem says: we are to complete the missing code. We cannot change the condition? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we cannot change the condition? \n\n        How about we do: in the s1==s2 block, we record and then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? and then we break the iteration? by using a continue? But then the next two ifs are skipped? \n\n        But the problem: we are in a while loop. We want to continue the loop? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                # We break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n                continue   # skip the next two ifs\n\n        Then the next two ifs are skipped? \n\n        But what if we move the left pointer and then we break the loop condition? Then we break the loop? \n\n        However, the next two ifs are skipped? Then we go to the next iteration? \n\n        But what if we moved the left pointer and now p1>p2? Then the next iteration we break? \n\n        This seems acceptable.\n\n        But note: we might have moved the left pointer and then the next iteration we check the condition? \n\n        However, the problem: we are only allowed to do one move per iteration? \n\n        This solution: we do one move (left) and then skip the rest of the iteration? Then we go to the next iteration? \n\n        But what if we have an equality and we move the left, and then in the next iteration we have s1>s2? Then we move the right? \n\n        That is acceptable.\n\n        But what if we have an equality and we move the left, and then we break the loop? Then we have recorded the last equality? \n\n        However, we might have an equality at the next iteration? \n\n        But note: we are moving the left pointer, so we break the equality? Then we need to rebalance? \n\n        This is the same as the standard solution: we break the tie by moving the left? \n\n        But the standard solution moves the left when s1<=s2 (which includes equality) and then moves the right when s1>s2. \n\n        Our solution: when we have an equality, we move the left and then skip the rest? Then in the next iteration, we might have s1>s2? Then we move the right? \n\n        But the next iteration: we are at state: s1 = w0, s2=0, p1=1, p2=n-1. Then we check: s1==s2? false. Then we check s1 < s2? false. Then we check s2 < s1? true -> then we move the right: s2 += l[n-1], p2 = n-2.\n\n        Then we have done two moves? But we are in two iterations? \n\n        Actually, we did one move in the first iteration (left) and then in the next iteration we did one move (right). That is two moves in two iterations? That is acceptable.\n\n        But the problem: we are only allowed to do one move per iteration? \n\n        So we are doing one move per iteration? \n\n        Therefore, we can do:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n                continue\n\n        But note: what if p1 is already at the end? Then we cannot move the left? We must check p1<=p2? Actually, the condition of the while loop is p1-1<=p2. Initially, p1=0, so p1-1=-1, which is <= p2 (which is at least 0). Then we enter. Then we do p1+=1 -> becomes 1. Then we continue. Then next iteration: we check p1-1<=p2? 0<=p2? true. Then we do the same? \n\n        But what if p1 becomes greater than p2? Then we break the loop? \n\n        However, we are adding l[p1] when p1 might be out of bounds? \n\n        We must check: after we do p1+=1, we break the loop condition? The condition is at the beginning of the while loop. So we do:\n\n            while (p1-1<=p2):\n                ... \n\n        After we do p1+=1, then at the next iteration: we check (p1-1)<=p2? \n\n        Example: n=1: \n            Initially: p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: 0-1 = -1 <=0 -> true.\n            Then s1==s2 (0==0) -> we append: 0 + (n-1-0) = 0+0=0? \n            Then we do: s1 += l[0] -> s1 = w0, p1=1.\n            Then we continue -> next iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n            Then s1 = w0, s2=0 -> not equal.\n            Then if s1 < s2? false.\n            Then if s2 < s1? true -> then we do: s2 += l[0] -> s2 = w0, p2 = -1.\n            Then we break the loop? \n\n        Then we output l2[-1] = 0? But the answer should be 0? because we cannot have both eating one candy? because if Alice eats the candy, then Bob has nothing to eat? and they must be fair? \n\n        But the problem: the first test case: \n            Input: \n                5\n                1 2 1 2 1\n            Output: 2\n\n        How about we try with [1]? \n            t=1, n=1, w=[1]\n            We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> record: total = 0 (p1=0, p2=0: total=0+ (1-1-0)=0) -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we break the inner and then next iteration: condition: p1-1=0<=p2=-1? false -> break.\n            Then we output l2[-1]=0.\n\n        But the expected answer for [1] is 0? because they cannot both eat the same positive weight? \n\n        So that is correct.\n\n        However, the note: the first test case: \n            Input: \n                t=1, n=2, w = [1,1]\n            How does our code run?\n                p1=0, p2=1 -> condition: 0-1=-1<=1 -> true.\n                s1=0, s2=0 -> record: total = 0 + (2-1-1)=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> continue (skip the rest).\n                Next iteration: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 1-1=0<=1 -> true.\n                s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal.\n                Then check: s1>s2 -> so we do: s2 += l[1] -> s2=1, p2=0.\n                Then next iteration: p1=1, p2=0 -> condition: 1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n                Now s1=1, s2=1 -> equal: record: total = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+ (1) = 2.\n                Then we move left: but p1=1 -> we try to take l[1]? but p1 is 1, which is the next index? but the array has index0 and 1. Then we do: s1 += l[1] -> s1=1+1=2, p1=2 -> then continue.\n                Then next iteration: p1=2, p2=0 -> condition: 2-1=1<=0 -> false -> break.\n                Then we output l2[-1] = 2.\n\n        That matches.\n\n        But what if we have [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\n        We want the maximum total candies such that the sums are equal.\n\n        Possibilities: \n          Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1,2,3,4] -> 10, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1] -> 1, Bob: [4,5] -> 9 -> not equal.\n          Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [3,4,5] -> 12 -> not equal.\n          ... \n          Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [3] -> 3 -> total=2+1=3? \n          But wait: the candies are [1,2,3,4,5]. Alice eats from left: [1,2] -> two candies. Bob eats from right: [5,4,3]? but he must eat from the right without skipping? so he can only eat contiguous from the right? He eats the last one, then the last two, then the last three? \n\n          Actually, Bob eats a contiguous segment from the right? So he can only eat the last k candies? \n\n          So the only possibility: \n            Alice: [1,2] -> 3, Bob: [3] -> 3? But Bob eats from the right: the rightmost candy is 5, then 4, then 3? so he must eat 5,4,3? that is 12? \n\n          How can Bob eat only the candy 3? He cannot skip 5 and 4? \n\n          Therefore, the only possibility is that Bob eats a contiguous segment from the right? So the candies Bob eats must be the last k candies? \n\n          Then the only possibility for [1,2,3,4,5] is: \n            Alice: [1] (1), Bob: [5] (5) -> not equal.\n            Alice: [1,2] (3), Bob: [4,5] (9) -> not equal.\n            Alice: [1,2,3] (6), Bob: [3,4,5] (12) -> not equal? but wait, Bob cannot eat the candy 3 because it is in the middle? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: Bob eats from the right. He can eat any number of candies from the right, but he cannot skip. So he must eat the last candy, then the last two, etc. But note: if Alice has eaten the first two, then the remaining candies are [3,4,5]. Bob can only eat from the right of the entire row? So he must start from the last candy? Then he can only eat [5], [4,5], [3,4,5]? \n\n          Therefore, the candy 3 is not available for Bob? because it is not at the rightmost of the entire row? \n\n          But wait: the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". So he must eat a contiguous segment from the right end? \n\n          Then the only possibility for Bob is to eat the last k candies? \n\n          Therefore, the solution: \n            We have two pointers: \n                Alice: takes [0, i-1] (i candies)\n                Bob: takes [j, n-1] (n-j candies)\n\n            And we require that the sum of [0, i-1] equals the sum of [j, n-1] and we want to maximize i + (n-j).\n\n          We can use two pointers: \n            i=0, j=n -> initially, Alice has 0, Bob has 0 -> total=0.\n            Then we can move i to the right (increase Alice) or move j to the left (increase Bob) until we meet? \n\n          But note: the candies are fixed. We can simulate:\n\n            s1 = 0, s2 = 0\n            i=0, j=n-1? but Bob starts from the last candy? \n\n          Actually, we can set:\n            i=0, j=n-1\n            s1 = 0, s2 = 0\n            Then we can do:\n                while i <= j:\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        ans = i + (n-1 - j)   # because Bob has eaten from j to n-1 -> count = n-1 - j + 1? but we are storing the total candies = i (from Alice) + (n-1 - j) (from Bob) -> but that is not the count? \n\n          Actually, the count for Alice: i (because she ate indices 0 to i-1 -> i candies)\n          The count for Bob: (n-1 - j + 1) = n - j? because he ate j to n-1 -> (n-1 - j + 1) = n-j.\n\n          So total = i + (n-j) = i + n - j.\n\n          But in the code: we have p1 and p2. \n            Alice: has eaten from index0 to p1-1 -> count = p1.\n            Bob: has eaten from p2+1 to n-1 -> count = n-1 - p2.\n\n          So total = p1 + (n-1 - p2) = p1 + n - 1 - p2.\n\n          But note: the total candies is p1 + (n-1-p2) = (p1 + n - p2 - 1). \n\n          However, the standard solution: \n            ans = 0\n            i=0, j=n-1\n            s1=0, s2=0\n            while i<=j:\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    ans = i + (n-1 - j)   # but wait, this is not the total candies? \n                    # Actually, the total candies is: i (from Alice) and (n-1 - j + 1) from Bob? \n                    # But note: the Bob part: he has eaten from j+1 to n-1? no, we haven't started Bob? \n\n          Actually, in the standard solution, we are moving the pointers and we haven't added the current candy? \n\n          How we simulate:\n\n            We start: \n                s1=0, s2=0, i=0, j=n-1 -> we have not taken any candy.\n\n            Then we do:\n                if s1<=s2: \n                    s1 += w[i]; i+=1   -> now Alice has taken the first candy? so she has taken [0] -> count=1.\n                else: \n                    s2 += w[j]; j-=1   -> Bob has taken the last candy? count=1.\n\n            Then when we have an equality, we record: \n                total candies = (i) [because Alice has taken i candies: indices0 to i-1] \n                and Bob has taken (n-1 - j) candies? because Bob has taken from j+1 to n-1 -> count = (n-1 - (j+1) + 1) = n-1-j? \n\n            So total = i + (n-1 - j).\n\n          Therefore, the code is:\n\n            l2 = []\n            p1, p2 = 0, n-1\n            s1, s2 = 0, 0\n            while p1-1 <= p2:   # This condition: p1-1<=p2 -> meaning p1<=p2+1? \n                if s1 == s2:\n                    # record the total: p1 + (n-1-p2)\n                    l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                    # Then we break the tie by moving the left pointer? \n                    if p1 <= p2:   # we must check that we can move the left?\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        # if we cannot move the left, then we break? \n                        break\n                    continue\n                if s1 < s2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                if s2 < s1:\n                    s2 += l[p2]\n                    p2 -= 1\n\n          But note: the condition at the top: while p1-1<=p2 -> meaning we can have p1-1<=p2 even if p1>p2? Actually, p1-1<=p2 is equivalent to p1<=p2+1. So if p1=p2+2, then we break.\n\n          However, we are moving p1 and p2: \n            Initially: p1=0, p2=n-1 -> condition: 0-1<=n-1 -> true.\n            Then we do the moves until we break.\n\n          But what if we have an equality and then we move the left pointer and then p1 becomes p2+1? Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1 = p2 -> true. Then we check s1==s2? not necessarily. Then we do the next ifs? \n\n          But note: after we move the left pointer in the equality block, we do a continue, so we skip the next two ifs? \n\n          Then next iteration: we check the condition: p1-1<=p2? -> p1-1 = p2? true. Then we check s1==s2? if not, then we do the next ifs? \n\n          But what if we moved the left pointer and now p1 = p2+1? Then we break the condition? \n\n          Actually, the condition: p1-1<=p2 -> p1-1 = (p2+1)-1 = p2 -> true. So we enter.\n\n          Then we do: if s1==s2? -> we record? and then we try to move the left? but p1<=p2? -> p1=p2+1, which is not <= p2? so we break? then we break the block? then we break the iteration? \n\n          Then we output the last recorded.\n\n          But what if we have an equality at the state: p1=p2+1? That is not possible? because we have moved p1 to p2+1, meaning we have taken p1 candies from the left and p2 is the last candy Bob has not taken? Bob has taken from p2+1 to n-1? but p2+1 = p1? so Bob has taken nothing? \n\n          Actually, Bob has taken from p2+1 to n-1? but p2+1 = p1, and p1 is beyond the current Bob pointer? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n        Alternatively, we can change the condition to the standard: while p1<=p2? \n\n        But the problem says: we are to complete the missing code? and we cannot change the provided code? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are allowed to fill in the missing block? and we are allowed to change the condition if it is part of the missing block? But the condition is not in the missing block? \n\n        We are only to output the missing code for the block under \"if s1==s2:\". \n\n        Therefore, we do:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                # We break the tie by moving the left pointer? But we must ensure we don't move if we are at the end?\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    # if we cannot move, then we break the loop? but we are in the while condition? \n                    # Actually, if we cannot move, then we break the inner and then the condition will break next time?\n                    # But we must avoid infinite loop? \n                    # We break the loop? by setting p1 to a value that breaks the condition? \n                    # Or we break the loop? \n                    # But the problem: we are to do one move? \n                    # Actually, we cannot move? then we break the tie? but we have to break the loop? \n                    # How about we break the loop by setting p1 to p2+2? \n                    # But we are not allowed to change the condition arbitrarily? \n                    # Instead, we break the loop by breaking out of the while? \n                    # But we are in the if block? \n                    # We can break? \n                    break\n                continue\n\n        But note: if we break, then we break the if block and then the while loop? \n\n        However, we are in the while loop. We break the if block and then we break the while loop? \n\n        Actually, we break only the if block? and then we break the while loop? no, we break only the if block? \n\n        The break will break the while loop? \n\n        But we are in the if block? \n\n        So:\n\n            if s1 == s2:\n                ... \n                if ...:\n                    ...\n                else:\n                    break   # this breaks the while loop?\n                continue   # if we didn't break, we continue to next iteration.\n\n        But if we break, we break the while loop? \n\n        Then we output l2[-1]? \n\n        But what if we break in the else? then we break the while loop? then we don't do the next two ifs? \n\n        That is acceptable.\n\n        But what if we break in the else? then we break the while loop? and we output the last recorded? \n\n        However, we broke in the else: meaning we had an equality and we couldn't move the left pointer? then we break? \n\n        Then we output the last recorded? which is the current one? \n\n        But we already recorded the current one? \n\n        So that is fine.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the block:\n\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n            continue\n\n        But note: what if we have an equality and we move the left pointer, and then we continue? Then we skip the next two ifs? \n\n        This matches the requirement.\n\n        However, what if we have an equality and we move the left pointer, and then the next iteration we have p1>p2? Then the condition p1-1<=p2? \n            p1 = p2+1 -> p1-1 = p2 -> true? so we enter.\n            Then we check s1==s2? -> we don't know? \n            Then we do the next two ifs? \n\n        But we don't want to record again? \n\n        Actually, we only record when we have an equality? \n\n        But if we moved the left pointer and then we break the equality? then we don't record? \n\n        Then we do the next two ifs? \n\n        That is acceptable.\n\n        But what if we have an equality at the next state? \n\n        Example: [1,1,1] \n            Initially: p1=0, p2=2 -> condition: -1<=2 -> true.\n            s1=0, s2=0 -> record: total=0+ (3-1-2)=0 -> then we move left: s1=1, p1=1 -> continue.\n            Next iteration: p1=1, p2=2 -> condition: 0<=2 -> true.\n            s1=1, s2=0 -> not equal -> then we check: s1>s2 -> so we move the right? \n                s2 += l[2] = 1, p2=1.\n            Next iteration: p1=1, p2=1 -> condition: 0<=1 -> true.\n            s1=1, s2=1 -> record: total=1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2.\n            Then we move left: s1 += l[1] = 1+1=2, p1=2 -> continue.\n            Next iteration: p1=2, p2=1 -> condition: 2-1=1<=1 -> true.\n            s1=2, s2=1 -> not equal -> then we check: s1>s2 -> move right? but p2=1, we move to p2=0? \n                s2 += l[1]? but wait, p2 is 1, then we do l[1]? but we already moved the right pointer to 1? and then we move to 0? \n                But note: the array is [1,1,1]. \n                Bob has eaten the last candy? then we moved to p2=1, meaning Bob has eaten the candy at index2? and now we are going to eat the candy at index1? but that is not contiguous from the right? \n\n          Actually, the Bob pointer: we start at the last candy (index2). Then we moved to index1? meaning Bob has eaten the candy at index2? and now we are going to eat the candy at index1? but that is contiguous? because the candies are in a row? Bob eats from the right without skipping? so he must eat the last candy first, then the next to last? \n\n          So the code is correct.\n\n          Then we do: \n            s2 += l[1]? -> but p2 is 1, so we take l[1]? which is the second candy? \n            Then s2 becomes 1+1=2, p2=0.\n          Then next iteration: p1=2, p2=0 -> condition: 2-1=1<=0 -> false? so we break.\n\n          Then we output l2[-1]=2.\n\n          The expected answer: \n            Alice: [1] (1), Bob: [1] (the last candy) -> total=2? \n            But wait, Bob ate the last candy? which is the third candy? and Alice ate the first candy? then they both have 1? total=2.\n\n          But note: we recorded 2 at the state: p1=1, p2=1 -> meaning Alice has eaten the first candy (index0) and Bob has eaten the last candy (index2)? then total=2? \n\n          But wait: the total candies eaten: Alice: [0] -> one candy, Bob: [2] -> one candy, total=2? \n\n          How did we get 2? \n            total = p1 + (n-1-p2) = 1 + (3-1-1) = 1+1=2.\n\n          So it's correct.\n\n        Therefore, we complete program1.py as:\n\n            if s1 == s2: \n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n                continue\n\n        But note: the problem says: the total of n over test cases is <=200000, so we are safe.\n\n        However, what if we break in the else? then we break the while loop? and we don't do the rest? \n\n        But the next test cases? we are in a for loop for test cases? \n\n        The provided code: \n            for _ in range(I()[0]):\n                n=I()[0]\n                l=I()\n                l2=[]\n                s1,s2=0,0\n                p1,p2=0,n-1\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    ... \n\n        So if we break, we break the while loop and then we output l2[-1] for this test case.\n\n        But if we break, we break the while loop and then we go to the print statement.\n\n        So it's safe.\n\n        But what if l2 is empty? then we get an error? \n\n        We start with s1=0, s2=0 -> we record 0. So l2 is not empty? \n\n        But what if we break in the first iteration? then we have l2=[0]? \n\n        Then we output 0? \n\n        But the problem: we want to output 0 if there is no positive equality? \n\n        However, we recorded 0? and then we output 0? \n\n        But the problem: they haven't eaten any candy? \n\n        The problem says: \"the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\" -> 0 is acceptable? \n\n        But the note: the first test case: output 2, the third test case: output 0.\n\n        So we output 0 for the third test case? \n\n        Therefore, we output l2[-1] which is the last recorded equality? which is the maximum total? \n\n        But note: we recorded 0 at the beginning? and then we moved? and then we might record a positive? and then we output the last one? \n\n        So if we have an equality at 0 and then at 2, we output 2? \n\n        But what if we have an equality at 0 and then no more? then we output 0? \n\n        That is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break\n            continue\n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop is (p1-1<=p2). We are using p1<=p2 to check if we can move the left? \n\n        But p1<=p2 is the condition that we have at least one candy to take from the left? \n\n        However, we are in the state: p1 and p2 are the next available? \n\n        But note: we are at the state: we have recorded the current state (p1, p2). Then we move the left pointer: we take the candy at p1? and then p1 becomes p1+1. \n\n        But what if p1==p2? then we take the last candy? then p1 becomes p1+1, and then p1>p2? \n\n        That is acceptable.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            if s1 == s2: \n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n                continue\n\n        Now for program2.py.\n\n        We are given:\n\n            n,x,d,m,f=int(input()),0,0,10**9+7,[1]\n            for i in range(1,9**6):# TODO: Your code here\n            for z in map(int,input().split()):d+=f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],-1,m)*(z>0);x+=1\n            print(d%m)\n\n        We note: 9**6 = 531441, which is about 500000. \n\n        The problem: \n            We have a non-increasing sequence a0, a1, ... an, and then a_i=0 for i>n.\n            The grid: cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x, black otherwise.\n            We start with a doll at (0,0). Operation: remove a doll at (x,y) and place a doll at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y).\n            Goal: all white cells have 0 dolls.\n\n            We are to compute the minimum number of operations modulo 10^9+7.\n\n        The example: \n            Input: n=1, and a0, a1: [2,1] (non-increasing: 2>=1>=0...)\n            Output: 5.\n\n        The provided code:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            x, d = 0, 0\n            m = 10**9+7\n            f = [1]   # f is a list that we are going to extend? \n\n            for i in range(1, 9**6):   # we are going to build factorials? \n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            Then we read the next line: a0, a1, ... an\n            for z in map(int, input().split()):\n                d += f[z+x] * pow( f[x+1] * f[z-1], -1, m) * (z>0)\n                x += 1\n\n            Then print(d%m)\n\n        The expression: \n            d += f[z+x] * pow( f[x+1] * f[z-1], -1, m) * (z>0)\n\n        This looks like a combination: \n            C(n, k) = f[n] / (f[k] * f[n-k])\n\n        Here: \n            term = f[z+x] / ( f[x+1] * f[z-1] )   if z>0, else 0.\n\n        But note: \n            f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1]) = ?\n\n        We can write: \n            = [ (z+x)! ] / [ (x+1)! * (z-1)! ]\n\n        But note: we have to do modular arithmetic.\n\n        The problem: what is the combinatorial meaning? \n\n        After reading the problem and the example, we know that the answer is the sum over i of (a_i choose something)? \n\n        Known solution for the problem: \n            The answer is: \n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(n+1):\n                    if a_i > 0:\n                        ans = (ans + comb(i+a_i, i+1)) % mod\n\n            But wait, the example: n=1, a0=2, a1=1.\n                i=0: comb(0+2, 0+1) = comb(2,1)=2.\n                i=1: comb(1+1, 1+1)=comb(2,2)=1.\n                total=3? but expected 5.\n\n        Alternatively, known solution from known problems: \n            This problem is similar to \"Jina of the Jungle\" from a contest.\n\n            The known solution: \n                dp[0] = 1\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i-1] * 2 - comb(i-1 + a_i, i))   # but modulo?\n\n            Actually, the known solution from a Codeforces contest: \n                #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                using namespace std;\n                typedef long long ll;\n                const int N = 2000000, mod = 1000000007;\n                int n, a[200200];\n                ll f[2002000], inv[2002000];\n                ll C(int n, int k) {\n                    if (k<0 || k>n) return 0;\n                    return f[n] * inv[k] % mod * inv[n-k] % mod;\n                }\n                int main() {\n                    f[0] = 1;\n                    for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) f[i] = f[i-1]*i%mod;\n                    inv[N] = pow(f[N], mod-2, mod);   // but in C++ we do with Fermat\n                    for (int i=N; i>=1; i--) inv[i-1] = inv[i] * i % mod;\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n                    for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n                    ll ans = 0;\n                    for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n                        if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                        ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n                    }\n                    printf(\"%lld\\n\", ans);\n                }\n\n            This gives: \n                for i=0: C(0+2, 1) = C(2,1)=2.\n                for i=1: C(1+1,2)=C(2,2)=1.\n                total=3? but expected 5.\n\n        Alternatively, the known solution for the problem \"Jina doesn't cheat\" (from a contest) is:\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n            const int mod = 1e9+7;\n            const int maxn = 2e6+10;\n            int fac[maxn], invfac[maxn], a[maxn];\n            int n;\n            int C(int n, int m) {\n                if (n < m || m < 0) return 0;\n                return 1LL * fac[n] * invfac[m] % mod * invfac[n-m] % mod;\n            }\n            int main() {\n                fac[0] = 1;\n                for (int i = 1; i < maxn; i++) fac[i] = 1LL * fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n                invfac[maxn-1] = pow(fac[maxn-1], mod-2, mod);\n                for (int i = maxn-2; i >= 0; i--) invfac[i] = 1LL * invfac[i+1] * (i+1) % mod;\n                scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n                for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n                int ans = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n                    if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                    ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n                }\n                printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n            }\n\n        But this also gives 3 for [2,1]? \n\n        However, the example says 5 operations.\n\n        After rethinking: \n            The problem: we start with one doll at (0,0).

So the total number of dolls after k operations is 1 + k (because we remove one and add two -> net +1). \n\n            We want all white cells to have 0 dolls. \n\n            The white cells: \n                (0,0): white? because y=0 < a0=2 -> white.\n                (0,1): white? 1<2 -> white.\n                (0,2): black? \n                (1,0): white? 0<a1=1 -> white.\n                (1,1): black.\n\n            We require that after the operations, the white cells have 0 dolls. \n\n            How many dolls are there? 1+k. \n\n            But we can move the dolls? \n\n            The known solution: \n                The answer is: \n                    sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i+i, i+1)\n\n            But for [2,1]: \n                i=0: C(2+0,1)=C(2,1)=2.\n                i=1: C(1+1,2)=C(2,2)=1.\n                total=3.\n\n            Why is the example 5? \n\n        Rethink the example: \n            Initially: (0,0): 1 doll.\n\n            Operation 1: remove (0,0) -> place (0,1) and (1,0). State: (0,1):1, (1,0):1.\n\n            Operation 2: remove (0,1) -> place (0,2) and (1,1). State: (1,0):1, (0,2):1, (1,1):1. \n                But (0,2) is black? we don't care. (1,1) is black? we don't care. But (1,0) is white? and it has 1 doll -> not 0.\n\n            Operation 3: remove (1,0) -> place (1,1) and (2,0). State: (0,2):1, (1,1):2, (2,0):1.\n\n            Operation 4: remove (1,1) -> place (1,2) and (2,1). State: (0,2):1, (1,1):1, (2,0):1, (1,2):1, (2,1):1.\n\n            Operation 5: remove (1,1) -> place (1,2) and (2,1). State: (0,2):1, (1,1):0, (2,0):1, (1,2):2, (2,1):2.\n\n            Now check white cells:\n                (0,0):0 -> good.\n                (0,1):0 -> good.\n                (1,0):0 -> good? but we have (2,0):1 -> but (2,0): is it white? \n                    a_2 = 0 (since n=1, so for i>1, a_i=0) -> so (2,0): y=0 < a_2? a_2=0 -> 0<0 is false -> black. \n                (0,2): black? -> 2<2 false -> black.\n                (1,1): black? -> 1<1 false -> black.\n                (1,2): black? -> 2<1 false -> black.\n                (2,0): black? -> 0<0 false -> black.\n                (2,1): black.\n\n            So all white cells are 0.\n\n            Therefore, 5 operations.\n\n        How to get 5? \n\n        Known solution from known contest: \n            The answer is: \n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(0, n+1):\n                    if a[i] > 0:\n                        ans = (ans + comb(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n            But that gives 3.\n\n        Another known solution: \n            We consider the contribution of each cell? \n\n            The generating function: \n                The number of ways to have a doll at (x,y) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (x,y) in the operation tree? \n\n            The number of operations to remove a doll from (x,y) is the number of times we have to operate on the doll that is moved to (x,y)? \n\n            Actually, the minimum number of operations is the sum over all white cells of the number of dolls that ever appear on that cell? \n\n            But the problem: we want the minimum number of operations to achieve the goal: all white cells have 0 dolls. \n\n            The known solution from the editorial: \n                The answer is: \n                    sum_{i=0}^{infinity} [ number of white cells in row i that are not in the shadow of the next row? ]\n\n            But we have a known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round #699 (Div. 1), problem B): \n                #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                using namespace std;\n                const int mod = 1e9+7;\n                const int maxn = 2e6+10;\n                int fac[maxn], invfac[maxn], a[maxn];\n                int n;\n                int C(int n, int m) {\n                    if (n < m || m < 0) return 0;\n                    return 1LL * fac[n] * invfac[m] % mod * invfac[n-m] % mod;\n                }\n                int main() {\n                    fac[0] = 1;\n                    for (int i = 1; i < maxn; i++) fac[i] = 1LL * fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n                    invfac[maxn-1] = pow(fac[maxn-1], mod-2, mod);\n                    for (int i = maxn-2; i >= 0; i--) invfac[i] = 1LL * invfac[i+1] * (i+1) % mod;\n                    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n                    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) scanf(\"%d\", &a[i]);\n                    int ans = 0;\n                    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n                        if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                        ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n                    }\n                    printf(\"%d\\n\", ans);\n                }\n\n            This gives 3 for [2,1]? \n\n        But the example in the editorial of that problem might be different.\n\n        After checking: the problem \"Jina and the Dolls\" might be: \n            The answer is: \n                ans = 0\n                for i in range(n+1):\n                    if a[i] == 0: \n                        break\n                    ans = (ans + comb(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod\n\n            However, the sample [2,1] gives 3, but expected 5.\n\n        What is the relation between 3 and 5? \n\n        Note: 5 = 2 + 3? \n\n        Or: 5 = comb(2,1) + comb(3,2) = 2 + 3 = 5? \n\n        How to get comb(3,2)? \n\n        If we do for i=0: comb(0+2, 0+1)=comb(2,1)=2.\n        for i=1: comb(1+1, 1+1)=comb(2,2)=1 -> total=3.\n\n        Alternatively, if we do for i=0: comb(0+2, 0+1)=2.\n        for i=1: comb(1+1, 1+1)=1.\n        for i=0: also comb(0+2,0+2)=comb(2,2)=1?

\n\n        After reading the editorial of the contest: \n            The answer is: \n                sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i-1+i, i+1)   ? \n\n            For i=0: a0=2 -> comb(2-1+0,0+1)=comb(1,1)=1.\n            For i=1: a1=1 -> comb(1-1+1,1+1)=comb(1,2)=0.\n            total=1.\n\n        Or: \n            sum_{i=0}^{n} C(a_i+i, i)   ?

\n\n        Known solution from a different approach: \n            Let dp[i][j] = number of dolls in cell (i,j) that we cannot avoid? \n            We start: dp[0][0]=1.\n            Then the operation: \n                To remove a doll at (i,j), we must have done an operation on it, and then it becomes two dolls: (i,j+1) and (i+1,j).\n                So: \n                    dp[i][j+1] += dp[i][j]\n                    dp[i+1][j] += dp[i][j]\n\n            But we want to remove all dolls from white cells. \n\n            The number of operations is the sum over all white cells of the number of times we have to remove a doll from that cell? \n\n            But note: we start with one doll at (0,0) and then we remove it, then we remove the next ones, etc.\n\n            The total operations is the sum over all white cells of the number of dolls that ever appear on that cell? \n\n            And the number of dolls that appear on (i,j) is exactly the number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j) in the grid with moves: only down and right? but wait, the moves are: \n                When you remove a doll at (x,y), you create a doll at (x,y+1) and (x+1,y). \n                This is like a reverse of the path? \n\n            Actually, the number of ways to have a doll at (i,j) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j) in a grid with only right and down? but not exactly: \n                The doll at (0,0) is given.\n                To get to (0,1): we must have an operation at (0,0) -> one path.\n                To get to (1,0): we must have an operation at (0,0) -> one path.\n                To get to (0,2): we must have an operation at (0,0) and then at (0,1) -> one path: (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2) and also (0,0)->(1,0) and then ... no, not that.\n\n            Actually, the doll at (0,1) can only come from (0,0) -> then to (0,1) by an operation at (0,0) that creates (0,1) and (1,0). \n            Then to get to (0,2), we must have an operation at (0,1) -> which creates (0,2) and (1,1).\n\n            So the number of dolls that appear at (i,j) is the number of paths from (0,0) to (i,j) in the grid with moves: \n                from (x,y) you can go to (x,y+1) and (x+1,y) only if you have been removed? \n\n            But the process: we can do operations in any order? \n\n            However, the doll at (i,j) is created if and only if there is a path from (0,0) to (i,j) using the moves: \n                (x,y) -> (x,y+1) and (x+1,y)\n\n            And the number of such paths is C(i+j, i) or C(i+j, j)? \n\n            Then the total number of dolls that ever appear on a white cell is the sum over all white cells (i,j) of C(i+j, i).\n\n            Then the total operations is the total number of removals? and we remove one doll per operation. And the total number of dolls created is 1 + (number of operations). \n            But also, the total number of dolls that ever appear is the sum over all cells of the number of times a doll is at that cell? \n\n            And we remove each doll exactly once? \n\n            Therefore, the total number of operations is (total number of dolls that ever appear) - 1? \n                because we start with one doll and then each operation removes one and creates two, so net increase by one. \n                Let T = total number of dolls that ever appear.\n                Then: T = 1 + (number of operations)   [because we start with 1 and then each operation adds one net]\n\n            But we want the number of operations = T - 1.\n\n            And T = sum_{(i,j) is white} C(i+j, i)\n\n            For the example [2,1] (n=1, a0=2, a1=1): \n                White cells: \n                    (0,0): C(0+0,0)=1\n                    (0,1): C(0+1,0)=1\n                    (1,0): C(1+0,0)=1\n                    (1,1): not white.\n                    (0,2): not white.\n                    (1,1): not white.\n                    (2,0): not white.\n                T = 1+1+1 = 3.\n                operations = 3-1 = 2? -> not 5.\n\n            But wait, the doll at (0,0) is removed and then creates (0,1) and (1,0). Then the doll at (0,1) is removed and creates (0,2) and (1,1). Then the doll at (1,0) is removed and creates (1,1) and (2,0). Then we have dolls at (0,2), (1,1) [two], (2,0). Then we remove one of the (1,1) -> creates (1,2) and (2,1). Then we remove the other (1,1) -> creates (1,2) and (2,1) again. Then we have dolls at (0,2), (1,2) [two], (2,0), (2,1) [two]. \n\n            The white cells are only (0,0), (0,1), (1,0). But we also had a doll at (0,0) initially, then we removed it. Then we had a doll at (0,1) and (1,0) -> which are white. Then we removed them. Then we had to remove the (1,0) doll? but we already removed it? \n\n            Actually, the doll at (1,0) is created at the first operation, and then we remove it at the third operation? \n\n            So the white cell (1,0) has been visited twice? \n                - once when we created it (from (0,0)) -> then we leave it there until we remove it.\n                - but while it is there, it is counted as one doll.\n\n            The number of times a white cell has a doll is the number of time intervals during which the doll is present? \n\n            But the process: we remove a doll and then immediately replace it with two. So the doll at (0,0) is there only at the beginning. Then after the first operation, it is gone. Then the dolls at (0,1) and (1,0) are there from the first operation until we remove them.\n\n            So the total number of dolls that ever appear on white cells is: \n                (0,0): present at time0 -> count=1.\n                (0,1): present from time1 to time2 -> count=1 (but it is one doll that is there for one full operation cycle? but we remove it at time2, so it is there for one operation step? \n                (1,0): present from time1 to time3 -> count=1.\n\n            But then T=3, and operations=2? \n\n            However, we did 5 operations.\n\n        Alternatively, the number of times a white cell is used as a removal is the number of times we remove a doll from that cell? \n\n            (0,0): removed at time1.\n            (0,1): removed at time2.\n            (1,0): removed at time3.\n            (1,1): removed at time4 and time5.\n\n            But (1,1) is black? \n\n            So only white cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) -> 3 removals? \n\n            But we did 5 operations.\n\n        Insight from the known solution: \n            The provided code in the problem: \n                for z in map(int,input().split()):d+=f[z+x]*pow(f[x+1]*f[z-1],-1,m)*(z>0);x+=1\n\n            This is: \n                d += comb(z+x, x+1)   if z>0, else 0.\n\n            Because: \n                comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1])? \n\n            Let me check: \n                comb(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n                Here: \n                    n = z+x, k = x+1 -> then n-k = z+x - (x+1) = z-1.\n                So comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] / (f[x+1] * f[z-1])\n\n            So the code is: \n                d = 0\n                x = 0\n                for z in a:   # a = [a0, a1, ... an]\n                    if z>0:\n                        d = (d + comb(z+x, x+1)) % mod\n                    x += 1\n\n            This is exactly the known solution that we thought earlier: \n                sum_{i} comb(a_i+i, i+1)\n\n            And for [2,1]: \n                i=0: comb(2+0,0+1)=comb(2,1)=2.\n                i=1: comb(1+1,1+1)=comb(2,2)=1.\n                total=3.\n\n            But expected 5.\n\n        However, the example in the problem statement: \n            Input: \n                n=1\n                a0=2, a1=1\n\n            Output: 5.\n\n        And the provided code in the problem outputs d%m, which is 3.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code in the problem is not complete? \n\n        But the problem says: \"complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\"\n\n        And the provided code has a for loop that builds an array f of factorials? \n\n        The for loop: \n            for i in range(1,9**6): \n                # TODO\n\n        We are to complete the TODO.\n\n        What is f? \n            f = [1] initially.\n            Then we are to extend f to 9**6 (531441) elements? \n\n        But 9**6 is 531441, and the constraints: a_i up to 200000, and n up to 200000, and we have z+x: \n            x is the index in the array a, so x goes from 0 to n (<=200000), and z = a_x, which is up to 200000.\n            So z+x <= 400000.\n\n        But 9**6 = 531441 > 400000, so it's enough.\n\n        The combinatorial term: comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] * inv(f[x+1]) * inv(f[z-1]) mod m.\n\n        But wait: the denominator is f[x+1] * f[z-1]? \n            comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] * inv(f[x+1]) * inv(f[z-1])? \n            But note: the denominator should be f[x+1] * f[z+x - (x+1)] = f[x+1] * f[z-1] -> yes.\n\n        So the combinatorial formula is correct.\n\n        Then why is the answer 3 for the example? \n\n        The only possibility: the known solution is not comb(n, k) but something else.\n\n        After checking a known AC code for the problem (from a contest), we find:\n\n            #include <iostream>\n            using namespace std;\n            const int N = 2000000, mod = 1000000007;\n            int n, a[200200];\n            long long f[2002000], inv[2002000];\n            long long C(int n, int k) {\n                if (k<0 || k>n) return 0;\n                return f[n] * inv[k] % mod * inv[n-k] % mod;\n            }\n            int main() {\n                f[0] = 1;\n                for (int i=1; i<=N; i++) f[i] = f[i-1]*i%mod;\n                inv[N] = 1;\n                for (int i=N; i>=1; i--) inv[i-1] = inv[i] * i % mod;\n                // then compute the modular inverse of f[0..N]? \n                // actually, we have computed the factorial and then the inv for factorial by: \n                //   inv[i] = (f[i])^{-1} mod mod? \n                // But the above computes inv[0] = 0? \n\n                // A better way: \n                //   invf[N] = pow(f[N], mod-2, mod)\n                //   then invf[i] = invf[i+1] * (i+1) % mod   [this is not right]\n\n                // Actually, the standard is:\n                //   invf[i] = 1 / f[i] mod mod.\n\n                // But the provided code in the problem does: \n                //   d += f[z+x] * pow( f[x+1] * f[z-1], -1, m)   for the combinatorial.\n\n                // In the C++ code above, they use: \n                //   C(n, k) = f[n] * invf[k] * invf[n-k] % mod.\n\n                // But our term: comb(z+x, x+1) = f[z+x] * invf[x+1] * invf[z-1] % mod.\n\n                // And in the C++ code, they do:\n                //   for (int i=0; i<=n; i++) {\n                //        if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                //        ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n                //   }\n\n                // So it's the same.\n\n        Therefore, the provided code in the problem is the known solution, but it gives 3 for [2,1] and the example says 5.\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        Rethink the problem: \n            The problem: \n                \"What's the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal? Print the answer modulo 10^9+7.\"\n\n            The known solution: \n                ans = sum_{i} C(i+a_i, i+1)\n\n            gives 3 for [2,1], but the example says 5.\n\n        After re-examining the example: \n            We did 5 operations. \n\n        How is the answer 5 in the known solution? \n\n        I find a known AC code for the problem \"B. Jina and the Dolls\" from a contest (Codeforces Round #699 (Div. 1)): \n            // \n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            #define int long long\n            using namespace std;\n            const int maxn = 1e6 + 5, mod = 1e9+7;\n            int n, a[maxn], fac[maxn], ifac[maxn];\n            int C(int n, int k) {\n                if (k > n) return 0;\n                return fac[n] * ifac[k] % mod * ifac[n-k] % mod;\n            }\n            signed main() {\n                fac[0] = 1;\n                for (int i = 1; i < maxn; i++) fac[i] = fac[i-1] * i % mod;\n                ifac[maxn-1] = pow(fac[maxn-1], mod-2, mod);\n                for (int i = maxn-2; i >= 0; i--) ifac[i] = ifac[i+1] * (i+1) % mod;\n                cin >> n;\n                for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) cin >> a[i];\n                int ans = 0;\n                for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {\n                    if (a[i] == 0) break;\n                    ans = (ans + C(i+a[i], i+1)) % mod;\n                }\n                cout << ans << endl;\n            }\n\n        This outputs 3 for [2,1].\n\n        But the contest problem might be different. \n\n        After reading the contest problem: \n            \"Jina is a little doll. ... \n             The grid is defined by a non-increasing sequence a0, a1, ... \n             cell (x,y) is white if y < a_x, else black.\n             Initially, one doll at (0,0). \n             Operation: choose a doll at (x,y) and replace it with two dolls, one at (x,y+1) and one at (x+1,y). \n             Goal: no doll is on a white cell.\n\n             What is the minimum number of operations needed? \n             Print the answer modulo 10^9+7.\"\n\n        And the sample: \n            Input: \n                1\n                2 1\n            Output: \n                5\n\n        Therefore, the known solution is not 3.\n\n        Alternative solution: \n            The minimum number of operations is the sum_{i>=0} ( number of white cells in row i that are not below a white cell in the next row? ) \n\n        Or: \n            We can use a different recurrence: \n                Let dp[i][j] = the number of operations that have to be done in the cell (i,j) (white cell) to remove the doll from this cell.\n                Then: \n                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i][j+1] + dp[i+1][j]   ? \n                But we want to remove the doll from (i,j) and then the two new dolls must be removed.\n\n            Then the number of operations for (i,j) is 1 (for the removal) plus the operations for the two new dolls.\n\n            But the new dolls are at (i,j+1) and (i+1,j). \n\n            However, (i,j+1) might be black? then we don't need to remove it? \n\n            So: \n                if (i,j+1) is white, then we have to remove it, else not.\n                if (i+1,j) is white, then we have to remove it, else not.\n\n            Therefore: \n                dp[i][j] = 1 + (if (i,j+1) is white then dp[i][j+1] else 0) + (if (i+1,j) is white then dp[i+1][j] else 0)\n\n            Then the answer is dp[0][0].\n\n            For the example: \n                (0,0): \n                    (0,1) is white -> need to compute dp[0][1]\n                    (1,0) is white -> need to compute dp[1][0]\n                dp[0][0] = 1 + dp[0][1] + dp[1][0]\n\n                (0,1): \n                    (0,2) is black -> 0\n                    (1,1) is black -> 0\n                    dp[0][1] = 1\n                (1,0): \n                    (1,1) is black -> 0\n                    (2,0) is black -> 0\n                    dp[1][0] = 1\n                Then dp[0][0] = 1+1+1 = 3.\n\n            But expected 5.\n\n        Or: \n            The recurrence might be: \n                dp[i][j] = 1 + ( if (i,j+1) is white then dp[i][j+1] else 0 ) + ( if (i+1,j) is white then dp[i+1][j] else 0 )\n            and then the answer is dp[0][0] - 1? because the initial doll is given, and we remove it? \n\n            But 3-1=2.\n\n        Or: \n            The recurrence might be: \n                dp[i][j] = ( if (i,j+1) is white then dp[i][j+1] else 0 ) + ( if (i+1,j) is white then dp[i+1][j] else 0 ) \n                and then we add 1 for the removal? \n\n            Then dp[i][j] = (number of operations stemming from (i,j+1) and (i+1,j)) \n            and then the total operations for (i,j) is 1 + dp[i][j] \n\n            So: \n                dp[i][j] = 1 + ( if (i,j+1) is white then (1 + dp[i][j+1] + dp[i+1][j+1]? ) wait, no.\n\n            Let me define dp[i][j] = the number of operations that are done on the doll that is at (i,j) (including the removal of (i,j) and the operations that are caused by the two new dolls).\n\n            Then: \n                When we remove (i,j), we do 1 operation, and then we have to do the operations for the two new dolls: \n                    if (i,j+1) is white, then we will have to do operations for the doll at (i,j+1) (which will be dp[i][j+1] operations)\n                    else, the doll at (i,j+1) is on a black cell, and we don't care? but the goal is only to remove from white cells, so we can leave it? \n                However, the problem: the goal is that all white cells have 0 dolls. The black cells can have any number. \n\n            Therefore, if (i,j+1) is black, we don't need to remove the doll from (i,j+1). Similarly for (i+1,j).\n\n            Then: \n                dp[i][j] = 1 + ( if (i,j+1) is white then dp[i][j+1] else 0 ) + ( if (i+1, j) is white then dp[i+1][j] else 0 )\n\n            For the example:\n                (0,0): white -> dp[0][0] = 1 + dp[0][1] + dp[1][0]\n                (0,1): white -> dp[0]["
