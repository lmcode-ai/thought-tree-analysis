However, the known solution for this problem (from known contests) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split())) L = 0\n                R = n-1\n                cnt = 0\n                sum1 = 0\n                sum2 = 0\n                while L <= R:\n                    if sum1 < sum2:\n                        sum1 += a[L]\n                        L += 1\n                    else:\n                        sum2 += a[R]\n                        R -= 1\n                    if sum1 == sum2:\n                        cnt = L + (n - R - 1)\n                print(cnt)\n\n        Let me test with [1,1] (n=2):\n            L=0, R=1\n            sum1=0, sum2=0 -> sum1<sum2 is false, so we go to else: sum2 += a[1]=1, R=0. Then we check: sum1 (0) == sum2 (1) -> false. Then L<=R: 0<=0 -> true. Then sum1<sum2: 0<1 -> true: sum1 += a[0]=1, L=1. Then check: 1==1 -> true, then cnt = 1 + (2-0-1) = 1+1=2. Then break? L=1, R=0 -> L<=R false. Output 2 -> correct. But what if [1,2,3,1,1,1,1,1]? Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                left = 0\n                right = n-1\n                ans = 0\n                sum1 = 0\n                sum2 = 0\n                while left <= right:\n                    if sum1 <= sum2:\n                        sum1 += a[left]\n                        left += 1\n                    else:\n                        sum2 += a[right]\n                        right -= 1 if sum1 == sum2:\n                        ans = left + (n - right - 1)\n                print(ans)\n\n        Let me test with [1,2,1] (n=3):\n            left=0, right=2, sum1=0, sum2=0 -> sum1<=sum2 -> true: sum1=1, left=1. then check: 1==0 -> false. then left<=right: 1<=2 -> true. sum1<=sum2: 1<=0 -> false -> so sum2 += a[2]=1, right=1. then check: 1==1 -> true: ans = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2. then left<=right: 1<=1 -> true. sum1<=sum2: 1<=1 -> true: sum1 += a[1]=2 -> sum1=3, left=2. then check: 3==1 -> false. then break. output 2. But what if [1,1,1]? \n            n=3\n            left=0, right=2: \n                sum1<=sum2 (0<=0) -> true: sum1=1, left=1. check: 1==0 -> false. left<=right: 1<=2 -> true. sum1<=sum2: 1<=0 -> false: so sum2=1, right=1. check: 1==1 -> true: ans = 1 + (3-1-1)=1+1=2. then left<=right: 1<=1 -> true. sum1<=sum2: 1<=1 -> true: sum1=1+1=2, left=2. check: 2==1 -> false.\n                break. output 2. But the optimal for [1,1,1]: \n            Alice takes [0] (1), Bob takes [2] (1) -> total 2 candies. What if we try to take more? Alice takes [0,1] (2), Bob takes [2] (1) -> not equal. Alice takes [0] (1), Bob takes [1,2] (2) -> not equal. So 2 is the maximum. Another test: [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> \n            We want: Alice takes [1,2] (1+2=3), Bob takes [3,2,1] (3+2+1=6) -> not equal. Alice takes [1,2,3] (6), Bob takes [1] (1) -> not equal. Alice takes [1,2] (3), Bob takes [1] (1) -> not equal. Alice takes [1] (1), Bob takes [1] (1) -> total 2 candies. But wait: \n                Alice takes [1,2] (3), Bob takes [6] (1) -> not equal. Alice takes [1] (1), Bob takes [6] (1) -> total 2. However, there is a better one: \n                Alice takes [1,2,3] (1+2+3=6), Bob takes [6,5,4] (1+2+3=6) -> total 6 candies. So the answer should be 6. Let's run the algorithm:\n\n                a = [1,2,3,3,2,1], n=6. left=0, right=5, sum1=0, sum2=0.\n                sum1<=sum2 -> true: sum1=1, left=1. check: 1==0 -> false. left<=right: true. sum1<=sum2: 1<=0 -> false: sum2=1, right=4. check: 1==1 -> true: ans = 1 + (6-4-1)=1+1=2. then: left=1, right=4.\n                sum1<=sum2: 1<=1 -> true: sum1=1+2=3, left=2. check: 3==1 -> false. left<=right: true. sum1<=sum2: 3<=1 -> false: sum2=1+2=3, right=3.\n                check: 3==3 -> true: ans = 2 + (6-3-1)=2+2=4. then: left=2, right=3.\n                sum1<=sum2: 3<=3 -> true: sum1=3+3=6, left=3. check: 6==3 -> false. left<=right: 3<=3 -> true. sum1<=sum2: 6<=3 -> false: sum2=3+3=6, right=2. check: 6==6 -> true: ans = 3 + (6-2-1)=3+3=6. then break because left>right? 3>2 -> break. output 6.

But we can write it as:\n\n            e += 1\n            lowest += lst[e] But the provided code does:\n\n            lowest += lst[e+1]   # when e is the current, then we add the next one at e+1, then set e to e+1. So it is the same. But in the branch for highest<lowest, we are doing:\n\n            r -= 1\n            highest += lst[r] This is the same as:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]   # when r is the current, then we add the next right candy at r-1, then set r to r-1. But note: the provided code in the first branch uses `lst[e+1]` and then updates e to e+1. In the branch for highest<lowest, we should do:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1 But that is the same as:\n\n            r -= 1\n            highest += lst[r] So we can do either.",

But what if there is only one candy? m=1: \n                e=0, r=0 -> while e<r and h+g<=m: e<r -> 0<0 -> false -> skip the loop. then print index=0. Correct. What if m=2: [1,1]\n            e=0, r=1: 0<1 -> true, and h+g=1+1=2<=2 -> true. then: lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal: \n                current_total = (0+1)+(2-1)=1+1=2 -> index=2.\n                then extend Alice: e+1=1, which is not < r (which is 1) -> 1<1 false -> break. output 2.\n\n        Correct. Therefore, we complete program1.py as:\n\n            Change the while loop condition to: `while e < r and h+g <= m`\n            and the missing branch:\n\n                elif highest<lowest:\n                    if r-1 > e: r -= 1\n                        highest += lst[r]\n                        h += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop: `h+g<=m` might be redundant?",

So for 1400: \n                        we have b[1]=1400, then the next is 1600. \n                        bisect_right(1400) returns 2. then division = 5-2=3 -> correct. rating=1599: \n                    bisect_right(1599) -> between 1400 and 1600 -> returns 2? division=5-2=3 -> correct. rating=1600: \n                    bisect_right(1600) -> returns 3? because 1600 is at index2, and we insert after -> index3. division=5-3=2 -> correct. rating=1899: \n                    returns 3? -> division=2 -> correct. rating=1900: \n                    returns 4? -> division=5-4=1 -> correct. rating=5000: \n                    returns 4? -> division=1. rating=-5000: \n                    bisect_right(-5000) -> in the list, -5001 is at index0, then -5000 would be inserted at index1? so returns 1 -> division=4. Therefore, we can do:\n\n                for i in range(int(input())):\n                    rating = int(input().strip()) pos = bisect.bisect_right(b, rating)\n                    div = 5 - pos   # because we have 4 divisions, and the boundaries are at indices 1,2,3 in the list b (which has 4 elements: indices0,1,2,3)\n\n            But note: the list b has 4 elements: [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900] -> so the possible values for pos: 0,1,2,3,4. And we want:\n                pos=0 -> rating < -5001? -> but the rating is at least -5000, so this won't happen? Actually, the rating is from -5000 to 5000, and the smallest in b is -5001, so the smallest rating (-5000) is greater than -5001 -> so bisect_right(-5000) returns 1. So we are safe. Alternatively, we can do without bisect:\n\n            if rating >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\") elif rating >= 1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\") elif rating >= 1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\") But the problem says to complete the given code, which uses bisect. So we do:\n\n            from bisect import bisect_right as br   # or we can use bisect, but the function is called bisect.bisect_right\n\n            Actually, we have: \n                import bisect   -> but we did `from bisect import bisect` -> that imports the function `bisect` which is bisect_right?",

    },
    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to complete the code that solves the candy eating problem for Alice and Bob.\n\nThe problem:\n- There are n candies in a row, with weights w1, w2, ..., wn.\n- Alice eats from the left (a contiguous segment from the left) and Bob from the right (a contiguous segment from the right).\n- They cannot eat the same candy.\n- They want the total weight eaten by Alice to equal that eaten by Bob, and they want to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nApproach:\nWe can use two pointers (left and right) and two prefix sums (one from the left and one from the right).\nBut note: the total n over test cases is <= 200,000, so we can do a two-pointer method.\n\nIdea:\n- Let left pointer i start at 0 (0-indexed) and right pointer j start at n-1.\n- Let sumA = 0 (Alice's current sum) and sumB = 0 (Bob's current sum).\n- We want to consider when the two sums are equal. When they are, we record the total candies eaten (i + (n - j - 1))? Actually, note: \n  Alice has eaten [0, i-1] (i candies) and Bob has eaten [j+1, n-1] (n - j - 1 candies). So total = i + (n - j - 1).\n- But note: we can also move the pointers conditionally.\n\nHowever, the provided code in program1.py has a while loop condition: `while h+g <= m` (where m is n, the total candies). \nBut note: h and g are initialized to 1. Also, we have:\n  e (which is the left index, starting at 0) and r (which is the right index, starting at m-1).\n  lowest = lst[0] (the current sum for Alice) and highest = lst[m-1] (the current sum for Bob).\n\nThe provided code does:\n  if lowest < highest: \n        lowest += lst[e+1]   -> then e increases by 1 and g (which is the count of candies eaten by Alice? or total?) increases by 1.\n  else if highest < lowest: \n        ... (missing)\n  else (equal): \n        then we update the index (which is the total candies eaten so far: e+1 (from left) and (m - r) from right? Actually, note: \n        e is the current left index (0-indexed) meaning that Alice has eaten from 0 to e (so e+1 candies). \n        Bob has eaten from r to m-1 (so m - r candies). So total = (e+1) + (m - r). But note: in the equal case, we then do:\n            lowest += lst[e+1]   -> then e increases by 1, and g increases by 1? and then set index = e + (m - r)   [but note: e is now e+1, and r hasn't changed?]\n\nBut wait, the condition in the while loop: `h+g <= m`? What are h and g? They are initialized to 1. \nActually, it seems:\n  g: might be the count of candies eaten by Alice? because when we add from left, we do g += 1. Similarly, when we add from right, we should do h += 1? \nBut in the provided code, in the first branch (lowest < highest) we do g += 1, and in the else if (which is missing) we should do something for Bob.\n\nBut note: the condition `h+g <= m` is the total candies eaten? Actually, h and g are initialized to 1 and then increased. \nBut initially, we have one candy from the left and one from the right? So total candies eaten so far is h+g? \n\nHowever, the problem: we start with:\n  Alice has taken the first candy: lst[0] -> so e=0, and Bob has taken the last candy: lst[m-1] -> so r = m-1.\n\nSo initially, we have two candies. Then the condition: while h+g <= m -> meaning while the total candies eaten (h+g) is <= n.\n\nBut note: we cannot eat more than n candies.\n\nNow, the missing part is the branch for `highest < lowest`. In that case, we should add a candy from the right (Bob's side) to try to increase Bob's sum.\n\nSo in the branch `highest < lowest`:\n    we should do:\n        highest += lst[r-1]   # because we are moving the right pointer to the left\n        r -= 1\n        h += 1   # because we are adding one candy for Bob? But note: the variable h is used in the condition. Initially h=1 (for Bob's first candy) and g=1 (for Alice's first candy). So when we add a candy for Bob, we increase h.\n\nBut note: the condition in the while loop: `h+g <= m` -> we are counting the total candies.\n\nAlso, in the equal branch, we do:\n    lowest += lst[e+1]   -> then e becomes e+1 (so we are taking the next left candy for Alice)\n    e += 1\n    g += 1\n    and then we set index = e + (m - r)   -> but note: e is the index we just updated (so e is the next index). \n        Actually, after adding, e is the last index that Alice has eaten (so the number of candies Alice has eaten is e+1? but wait: we started at e=0 meaning 1 candy, then we did e+=1 so now e=1 -> meaning two candies?).\n\nBut let me reindex:\n\nInitially:\n    e = 0 -> Alice has eaten [0] -> 1 candy.\n    r = m-1 -> Bob has eaten [m-1] -> 1 candy.\n\nThen in the equal branch:\n    we do: \n        lowest += lst[e+1]   -> so we take the candy at index 1 (the next one)\n        e becomes 1 (so now Alice has eaten [0,1] -> 2 candies)\n        g += 1 -> now g=2 (so Alice has 2 candies? but note: g started at 1 and now 2, which matches)\n    then we set index = e + (m - r) -> e=1, r is still m-1 -> so m - r = 1 -> total 2? but wait, we have 2 (Alice) + 1 (Bob) = 3? \n\nActually, the total candies eaten is (e+1) for Alice and (m - r) for Bob? \n    Because Alice: indices [0, e] -> that's e+1 candies.\n    Bob: indices [r, m-1] -> that's m - r candies.\n\nSo total = (e+1) + (m - r).\n\nBut in the code, we set index = e + (m - r). That would be (1) + (1) = 2? but we have 2 (Alice) and 1 (Bob) -> total 3? \n\nWait, let me check: \n    e = 1 -> so Alice has eaten 2 candies? (because from 0 to 1 inclusive -> 2 candies) -> so we should use (e+1) for Alice? \n    But in the code we are using e as the last index she ate? Then the count is e+1? \n\nBut in the variable index, we are setting: index = e + (m - r). \n    e is the index (0-indexed) of the last candy Alice ate? Then the count is e+1? \n    But we are not adding 1. \n\nActually, in the initial state:\n    e=0 -> Alice has 1 candy -> but e=0 -> so if we do e+1 we get 1.\n    r = m-1 -> Bob has 1 candy -> m - r = 1? because m - (m-1) = 1.\n\nSo total = (e+1) + (m - r) = 1+1 = 2.\n\nBut in the code, we set index = e + (m - r) -> 0 + (m - (m-1)) = 0+1 = 1? which is not 2.\n\nSo there is a discrepancy.\n\nAlternatively, we can think of:\n    Alice has eaten from index 0 to e (inclusive) -> that's (e - 0 + 1) = e+1.\n    Bob has eaten from index r to m-1 (inclusive) -> that's (m-1 - r + 1) = m - r.\n\nSo total = (e+1) + (m - r).\n\nBut in the code, we are storing in `index` the value `e + (m - r)`. That would be (e+1) + (m - r) - 1? because we are missing the +1 for Alice? \n\nWait, no: \n    e is the current index (0-indexed) that Alice has last taken. So the count is e+1? \n    But we are adding e (which is the index) and (m - r) (which is the count for Bob). \n\nSo we are missing the +1 for Alice? \n\nBut note: initially, e=0, so we have 0 + (m - (m-1)) = 0+1 = 1, but we have two candies? \n\nActually, the total candies eaten is (number of Alice's candies) + (number of Bob's candies) = (e+1) + (m - r). \n\nSo we should set index = (e+1) + (m - r). \n\nBut in the code, we set index = e + (m - r). \n\nSo we are off by one for Alice? \n\nAlternatively, we can change the meaning: \n    Let Alice have eaten up to index e (exclusive of the current e?) -> but the code starts with e=0 and that candy is already taken.\n\nI think the issue is that the variable `e` is the next available index for Alice? Actually, no: \n    Initially, we set e=0 and we have taken the candy at e=0. \n    Then when we add, we do: \n        e += 1 -> then we take the candy at e (which is the next one). \n\nBut then the count of Alice's candies is e+1? because we started at 0 and then we did e=1 -> that's two candies? \n\nBut in the initial state, we have e=0 -> that's one candy. Then when we do e+=1, we get e=1 -> that's two candies? \n\nSo the count for Alice is e+1? \n\nBut in the expression: `index = e + (m - r)`, we are using e (which is 1) and (m - r) (which is 1) -> 2. But we have 2 (Alice) and 1 (Bob) -> total 3? \n\nWait, no: \n    Initially: \n        Alice: [0] -> 1 candy -> e=0.\n        Bob: [m-1] -> 1 candy -> r = m-1 -> so m - r = 1.\n        total = 1+1 = 2.\n\n    Then in the equal branch, we do:\n        lowest += lst[e+1]   -> so we take the candy at index 1? \n        then e becomes 1 -> so now Alice has [0,1] -> 2 candies.\n        then we set index = 1 (e) + (m - r) -> which is 1 + 1 = 2? but the total candies now is 2 (Alice) + 1 (Bob) = 3? \n\nBut wait, we haven't updated Bob? \n\nActually, in the equal branch, we only add one candy for Alice. Then we set index = 1 + (m - r) = 1+1=2? but that total (2) is the total candies? \n\nBut we have 2 (from Alice) and 1 (from Bob) -> 3 candies. \n\nSo the expression `index = e + (m - r)` is not the total candies? \n\nAlternatively, note: \n    The total candies eaten = (number of Alice's candies) + (number of Bob's candies) = (e+1) + (m - r). \n    But we are setting index = e + (m - r). \n\nSo we are missing 1 for Alice? \n\nBut in the initial state, we have e=0, so (e+1)=1, and (m - r)=1 -> total=2. \n    But the code sets index = 0 + 1 = 1? \n\nSo that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, we can interpret the variables:\n    e: the next available index for Alice? Actually, the code starts with e=0 and we have already taken the candy at e=0. \n    Then when we do: \n        e += 1 -> then we take the candy at e (which is the next one). \n\nBut then the count of Alice's candies is e? because we started at 0 and then we have taken up to e (which is now 1) -> that's 2 candies? \n\nBut wait: \n    e=0: we have taken one candy (index0). \n    Then we do e=1: we take the candy at index1 -> that's the second candy. \n    So the count is e? no, it's e+1? \n\nI think the problem is that the variable `index` is being set to a value that is not the total candies. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"print the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\".\n\nIn the example: \n    n=2, candies [1,1]: \n        Initially: \n            Alice: 1 (at index0) -> e=0\n            Bob: 1 (at index1) -> r=1\n            Then we enter the while loop: h+g = 1+1 = 2 <= 2 -> true.\n            Then we check: lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal.\n            Then we do: \n                lowest += lst[1] -> becomes 2? \n                e becomes 1 -> so Alice has [0,1] -> two candies? \n                g becomes 2.\n                Then we set index = 1 (e) + (2 - 1) = 1+1 = 2.\n            Then we break? because h+g = 2+1 = 3? -> no, we have h=1 and g=2 -> h+g=3, which is >2 -> we break the loop.\n\n        Then we print index=2.\n\n        But wait, we have eaten 2 candies by Alice and 1 by Bob? that's 3? but we only have 2 candies. \n\nThis is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, we must note: when we add a candy in the equal branch, we are breaking the condition? because we are taking a candy that might be the same as Bob's? \n\nActually, the candies are distinct in the sense of positions. But note: we cannot take the same candy. \n\nIn the example of two candies: \n    We start with Alice at 0 and Bob at 1 -> that's two candies and they are distinct. \n    Then we try to add the next candy for Alice: but there is no next candy? because e+1 would be 1, which is the same as Bob's candy? \n\nBut wait, the array index: \n    We have lst = [1,1] of length 2. \n    Initially, e=0, r=1. \n    Then in the equal branch, we try to do: \n        lowest += lst[e+1] -> e+1 = 1 -> which is the candy at index1. \n        But Bob is already at index1? \n\nSo we are taking the same candy? \n\nThat is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, we must ensure that we do not cross the pointers: we should break when e >= r? \n\nBut the condition in the while loop: `h+g <= m` -> but that doesn't check for overlap.\n\nWe should break when e >= r? \n\nActually, we have to make sure that the candies Alice eats and Bob eats are disjoint. \n\nSo we should have e < r. \n\nTherefore, in the while loop condition, we should also have e < r-1? because when we add a candy from the left, we do e+1, so we require e+1 < r? Similarly, when we add from the right, we require e < r-1.\n\nSo the condition in the while loop should be: `e < r-1 and h+g <= m`? \n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the condition to `e < r` and then inside, when we add, we require that we don't cross.\n\nBut note: the provided code does not have that. \n\nAlternatively, we can note that the total candies eaten so far is h+g, and we cannot exceed n, and also we must have at least one candy in between? \n\nBut the problem does not specify that we must leave candies in the middle? \n\nActually, the problem says: Alice eats from the left (contiguous) and Bob from the right (contiguous). They can stop anywhere. \n\nBut they cannot eat the same candy. So the two segments must be disjoint.\n\nTherefore, we must have e < r.\n\nSo we should change the while loop condition to: `while e < r and h+g <= m`? \n\nBut note: initially, e=0 and r=m-1 -> so e < r if m>=2. \n\nBut what if m==1? then e=0 and r=0 -> e==r -> we skip the loop. Then we print index? but index was not set. \n\nWe must initialize index=0. Then if we never have an equal, we output 0? but note: if we have one candy, we cannot have both Alice and Bob (because they would have to share the same candy) -> so 0.\n\nBut what if we have two candies: [1,1]? \n    We enter the loop: e=0, r=1 -> e<r -> true.\n    Then we check: lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal.\n    Then we do: \n        lowest += lst[1] -> becomes 2? \n        e becomes 1 -> now e=1, r=1 -> then we break the loop? \n        Then we set index = 1 (e) + (m - r) = 1 + (2-1)=1+1=2.\n\n    Then we output 2? but that's correct: they eat two candies? \n\nBut wait, after we add the candy at index1 to Alice, then Alice has eaten [0,1] -> both candies? and Bob has eaten [1] -> but that candy is already taken by Alice? \n\nSo we have a conflict.\n\nTherefore, we must not let the pointers cross. We should only add a candy from the left if there is a candy available (i.e., e+1 < r) and similarly for the right.\n\nSo we should adjust the condition: \n    In the branch for `lowest < highest`: we can only add from the left if e+1 < r? \n    Similarly for the other branches.\n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are guaranteed that the sum of n is <=200000, so we can do:\n\n    while e < r:\n        if ... and we break when we cannot move without overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the condition in the while loop to `e < r` and then inside, we break when we try to move and e+1==r? \n\nBut the provided code uses `h+g<=m` and we are increasing h or g by one each time. Since h and g start at 1, and we are increasing one of them each time, the total steps is at most m. \n\nBut we must avoid taking the same candy.\n\nSo in the branch for `lowest < highest`:\n    we do: \n        if e+1 < r: \n            e += 1\n            lowest += lst[e]   # note: we are currently at e, and we are going to take the next one? \n            g += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\nBut wait, the current state: \n    We have Alice's current sum = lowest, which includes up to the current e (which is the last taken index). \n    We want to add the next left candy: which is at index e+1? \n\nBut in the code, we are doing: \n        lowest += lst[e+1]\n        e += 1\n\nSo we are taking the candy at index e+1 and then setting e to e+1. \n\nBut if we do that, then we are taking the candy at index e+1, and then e becomes e+1. \n\nBut then we must check that e+1 (the next one) is less than r? \n\nActually, we are at e, and we want to take the next one: index e+1. We require that e+1 <= r? but note Bob has taken r, so we can take up to r-1? \n\nBut we must not take the same candy as Bob. So we require that the new e+1 is strictly less than r? \n\nBut after we take, e becomes e+1, and then we have the next available for Alice is e+1, which must be < r? \n\nBut in the condition, we are in the while loop with e < r. Then if we are going to take e+1, we require that e+1 < r? \n\nSo we can do:\n\n    if lowest < highest:\n        if e+1 < r: \n            e += 1\n            lowest += lst[e]\n            g += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\nSimilarly for the other branch.\n\nBut the provided code does not have that condition. \n\nAlternatively, we can break the loop when we cannot move? \n\nBut note: the condition `h+g<=m` is already ensuring we don't exceed the total candies? \n\nBut that doesn't prevent overlapping? \n\nWe must change the condition to also check that we have room to move? \n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do:\n\n    while e < r and h+g <= m:   # but note: h and g are the counts? and we are going to add one more, so we require h+g+1<=m? \n\nActually, we are going to add one more candy in the next step. So we require that the total after adding is <= m? \n\nBut the condition is `while h+g <= m` -> that means we have room for at least one more candy? \n\nBut we also require that we have at least one candy to take without overlapping. \n\nSo we can do:\n\n    while h+g <= m and e < r-1:   # because if we are going to take from left, we require e+1 < r -> so e < r-1. Similarly for the right, we require r-1 > e -> so r-1>=e+1? \n\nBut note: we might have one branch that can move even if the other cannot? \n\nAlternatively, we can break inside the branches.\n\nBut the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do:\n\n    while e < r and h+g <= m:\n        if lowest < highest:\n            if e+1 < r:   # we can take one more from left without overlapping?\n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]   # note: the current e is the new candy\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        elif highest < lowest:\n            if r-1 > e:   # we can take one more from right without overlapping?\n                r -= 1\n                highest += lst[r]\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        else:   # equal\n            # We record the current total: (e+1) + (m - r) -> but note: we haven't taken the next candy yet? \n            # Actually, we are going to take one more from the left? \n            # But we must check that we can take one more from the left without overlapping?\n            if e+1 < r: \n                e += 1\n                lowest += lst[e]\n                g += 1\n                # Now we record the total candies: (e+1) + (m - r) \n                index = (e+1) + (m - r)   # because Alice has e+1 candies, Bob has m - r candies.\n            else:\n                break\n\nBut wait, in the equal branch, we record only when we add for Alice? what if we add for Bob? \n\nActually, when they are equal, we have an option to add to either? but the problem says we want to maximize the total candies. \n\nBut note: if we add to Alice, then the sums become unequal (unless the next candy is 0? but weights are positive). \n\nBut we record the state at the moment we have an equal and then we try to extend? \n\nThe idea in the provided code is: when we have an equal, we record the current total (which is the total candies eaten so far) and then we try to extend by one more candy for Alice? and then record again? \n\nBut that doesn't make sense because after extending, the sums are no longer equal. \n\nActually, the provided code in the equal branch does:\n    lowest += lst[e+1]\n    e += 1\n    g += 1\n    index = e + (m - r)\n\nBut that sets index to the total candies eaten after this extension? but now the sums are not equal? \n\nThat seems incorrect.\n\nI think the correct approach is:\n\n    We want to record the total candies whenever the two sums are equal.\n\n    So in the equal branch, we should record the current total: \n        current_total = (e+1) + (m - r)   # because Alice has eaten [0, e] -> e+1 candies, Bob has eaten [r, m-1] -> m - r candies.\n        Then we try to extend by one candy from the left (if possible) to see if we can get more? \n\n    But note: if we extend, the sums become unequal, so we break the equality.\n\n    However, the problem is asking for the maximum total candies with the same total weight.\n\n    We can try to extend both? but that would break the equality.\n\n    Alternatively, we can break the symmetry: we can extend one side and then try to rebalance? \n\n    But the known solution for this problem is:\n\n        Use two pointers: \n            i = 0, j = n-1\n            sumA = 0, sumB = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while i <= j:\n                if sumA < sumB:\n                    sumA += w[i]\n                    i += 1\n                elif sumB < sumA:\n                    sumB += w[j]\n                    j -= 1\n                else:\n                    ans = i + (n-1-j)   # because Alice has taken [0, i-1] (i candies), Bob has taken [j+1, n-1] (n-1-j candies)\n                    # Then we can extend by one from the left? \n                    sumA += w[i]\n                    i += 1\n            # Also, if we break because i>j, then we might have an equal at the last recorded ans.\n\n        But note: we might have an equal in the middle and then extend and then get another equal? \n\n        Actually, we should record every time we have an equal.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            i = 0, j = n-1\n            sumA = 0, sumB = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while i <= j:\n                if sumA <= sumB:\n                    sumA += w[i]\n                    i += 1\n                else:\n                    sumB += w[j]\n                    j -= 1\n                if sumA == sumB:\n                    ans = i + (n-1-j)   # because Alice: [0, i-1] -> i candies, Bob: [j+1, n-1] -> n-1-j candies.\n\n        Then output ans.\n\n        But note: we are always moving until i<=j, and we update ans whenever we have an equal.\n\n        However, we might have multiple equals and we want the maximum total candies.\n\n        This will work because we are updating ans every time we have an equal, and the last equal might not be the maximum? \n\n        But we are moving the pointers: when we have an equal, we record the current total, and then we continue. \n\n        Example: [1,2,1]\n            Initially: sumA=0, sumB=0 -> then we do sumA<=sumB -> sumA=1, i=1.\n            Then: sumA=1, sumB=0 -> we do sumB<sumA -> sumB=1, j=1 -> then we have i=1, j=1 -> but we haven't checked the middle candy? \n            Then we check: sumA==sumB? -> 1==1 -> true, so ans = 1 (i) + (3-1-1) = 1+1=2.\n            Then we break? because i<=j -> i=1, j=1 -> we do one more iteration? \n                Now we do: sumA<=sumB? 1<=1 -> true, so we add w[1]=2 -> sumA=3, i=2.\n                Then we check: 3==1? no.\n                Then we break because i>j.\n\n            So we output 2.\n\n        But what if we have [1,2,3,1,1,1,1,1]? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            i = -1, j = n\n            sumA = 0, sumB = 0\n            ans = 0\n            while i < j:\n                if sumA <= sumB:\n                    i += 1\n                    if i < j:   # to avoid taking the same candy\n                        sumA += w[i]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                else:\n                    j -= 1\n                    if i < j:\n                        sumB += w[j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                if sumA == sumB:\n                    ans = i+1 + (n - j)   # Alice: [0,i] -> i+1, Bob: [j, n-1] -> n-j\n\n            print(ans)\n\n        But note: the condition i<j and then we move i or j and then check if i<j again.\n\n        However, the known solution for this problem (from known contests) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                L = 0\n                R = n-1\n                cnt = 0\n                sum1 = 0\n                sum2 = 0\n                while L <= R:\n                    if sum1 < sum2:\n                        sum1 += a[L]\n                        L += 1\n                    else:\n                        sum2 += a[R]\n                        R -= 1\n                    if sum1 == sum2:\n                        cnt = L + (n - R - 1)\n                print(cnt)\n\n        Let me test with [1,1] (n=2):\n            L=0, R=1\n            sum1=0, sum2=0 -> sum1<sum2 is false, so we go to else: sum2 += a[1]=1, R=0.\n            Then we check: sum1 (0) == sum2 (1) -> false.\n            Then L<=R: 0<=0 -> true.\n            Then sum1<sum2: 0<1 -> true: sum1 += a[0]=1, L=1.\n            Then check: 1==1 -> true, then cnt = 1 + (2-0-1) = 1+1=2.\n            Then break?

We use left and right pointers and update until left<=right.\n\n        However, the provided code uses:\n            h: count for Bob? \n            g: count for Alice? \n            and the condition h+g<=m.\n\n        We can try to adapt the known solution to the provided structure.\n\n        But the provided structure has a while loop that runs as long as the total candies eaten (h+g) is <= m.\n\n        And it has three branches.\n\n        We are missing the branch for `highest<lowest` (which is the same as `sum2<sum1` in the known solution).\n\n        In that branch, we should do for Bob what we do for Alice in the first branch.\n\n        Specifically:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]   # but note: Bob is eating from the right, so we move r to the left and take the candy at r-1.\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n        But then we must check that we are not overlapping? \n\n        However, the condition `h+g<=m` ensures we don't exceed the total, but not overlapping. \n\n        Also, we must ensure that r-1 is not less than e? \n\n        But the while loop condition does not prevent that. \n\n        We should change the condition to `while e < r and h+g <= m`? \n\n        But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do that.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break inside the branches if we cannot move.\n\n        But the known solution breaks when the pointers cross.\n\n        So let's change the while loop condition to: `while e < r and h+g <= m`\n\n        Then in the branch for `highest<lowest`:\n\n            if r-1 > e:   # meaning there is at least one candy between e and r that we can take for Bob\n                highest += lst[r-1]\n                r -= 1\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        Similarly, in the branch for `lowest<highest`:\n\n            if e+1 < r: \n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n            else:\n                break\n\n        And in the equal branch:\n\n            if e+1 < r: \n                lowest += lst[e+1]\n                e += 1\n                g += 1\n                # and then record: index = (e+1) + (m - r)   # because Alice has e+1 candies (from 0 to e) and Bob has m - r candies (from r to m-1)\n                index = (e+1) + (m - r)\n            else:\n                break\n\n        But note: in the known solution, we record every time we have an equal. In the provided code, we only record in the equal branch. \n\n        However, we might have an equal and then extend and then have another equal? \n\n        But in the provided code, we only record the last time we had an equal? \n\n        We should record the maximum index over all equal states.\n\n        So we should do: \n            in the equal branch, we record index = (e+1) + (m - r) and then we also try to extend? \n\n        But the known solution records every time we have an equal.\n\n        We can change: \n            in the equal branch, we record the current total (without the extension we are about to do) and then extend? \n\n        But the provided code extends in the equal branch and then records? \n\n        That is: \n            We are in an equal state. Then we extend Alice by one candy (so we break the equality) and then we record the total candies eaten (which includes the new candy for Alice) but the sums are not equal anymore? \n\n        This doesn't make sense.\n\n        Alternatively, we should record the current total candies when we have an equal BEFORE extending.\n\n        But the provided code does not have a variable to record the maximum. It only sets `index` and then prints it.\n\n        We can do: \n            in the equal branch, we record: \n                current_total = (e+1) + (m - r)   # this is the current total candies eaten (without the next candy we are about to take)\n                and then we set index = max(index, current_total)   # but we want the maximum over the entire run.\n\n            then we extend by one candy for Alice (if possible) to continue the process.\n\n        But note: after extending, the sums are not equal, but we might get an equal again later.\n\n        So we should do:\n\n            elif highest == lowest:\n                # record the current total\n                current_total = (e+1) + (m - r)\n                if current_total > index:\n                    index = current_total\n\n                # then we extend by one from the left if possible, to continue the process\n                if e+1 < r:\n                    e += 1\n                    lowest += lst[e]   # note: we are at e, so we take lst[e] (which is the next left candy)\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But why extend only Alice? why not extend either? \n\n        The known solution extends the one with the smaller sum, or if equal then we extend the left? \n\n        But in the known solution, we extend the left if sumA<=sumB, which includes equal. \n\n        So in the equal state, we extend the left. \n\n        Therefore, we can do the same.\n\n        But note: the known solution might extend and then get another equal later.\n\n        So we can change the code to:\n\n            while e < r and h+g <= m:\n                if lowest < highest:\n                    if e+1 < r:\n                        e += 1\n                        lowest += lst[e]\n                        g += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                elif highest < lowest:\n                    if r-1 > e:\n                        r -= 1\n                        highest += lst[r]\n                        h += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                else:   # equal\n                    # record the current total\n                    current_total = (e+1) + (m - r)\n                    if current_total > index:\n                        index = current_total\n                    # then extend from the left (as in the known solution)\n                    if e+1 < r:\n                        e += 1\n                        lowest += lst[e]\n                        g += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n        But what if after extending the left, we then get an opportunity to extend the right and then get another equal? \n\n        The known solution does not distinguish: it just does if sumA<=sumB then extend left, else extend right.\n\n        And it updates the answer every time there is an equal.\n\n        In our code, we only record in the equal branch. \n\n        But we might have an equal that is not followed by an extension in the equal branch? \n\n        For example, we might have an equal and then in the next iteration we might have an equal again? \n\n        But note: after extending in the equal branch, we break the equal. Then in the next iteration, we are in a non-equal state. \n\n        However, the known solution might have an equal and then extend and then have another equal later. \n\n        But our code will not record the next equal unless we go into the else branch again.\n\n        And we will, if the sums become equal again.\n\n        So we are okay.\n\n        But note: we must record every time we have an equal, not only when we are in the else branch.\n\n        But in our code, we only check in the else branch. \n\n        What if we have an equal that is not detected in the else branch? \n\n        For example, we might have an equal after doing the highest<lowest branch? \n\n        In the known solution, we check after every move if sumA==sumB.\n\n        In our code, we only check in the else branch. \n\n        But our code has three branches: \n            if lowest < highest: ... \n            elif highest < lowest: ... \n            else: ... (which is equal)\n\n        So we do check every time we enter the loop.\n\n        But note: we might have an equal that is not at the beginning of the loop? \n\n        Actually, at the beginning of the loop, we check the current state.\n\n        And we update the state in the branches.\n\n        So we are covering.\n\n        However, there is a catch: when we extend in the equal branch, we then have lowest > highest? (if the new candy is positive) and then in the next iteration we go to the highest<lowest branch? \n\n        But then if we then make them equal again, we will record in the else branch.\n\n        So it should be okay.\n\n        Let me test with [1,2,3,3,2,1] using our code:\n\n            m=6, lst=[1,2,3,3,2,1]\n            e=0, r=5, lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal.\n                current_total = (0+1)+(6-5)=1+1=2 -> index=2.\n                then we extend: e becomes 1, lowest=1+2=3, g=2.\n            next: e=1, r=5 -> 3 and 1 -> so highest<lowest? -> 1<3 -> true.\n                then we extend Bob: r becomes 4, highest=1+2=3, h=2.\n            then: e=1, r=4 -> 3 and 3 -> equal.\n                current_total = (1+1)+(6-4)=2+2=4 -> index=4.\n                then extend Alice: e=2, lowest=3+3=6, g=3.\n            then: e=2, r=4 -> 6 and 3 -> so highest<lowest: true.\n                extend Bob: r=3, highest=3+3=6, h=3.\n            then: e=2, r=3 -> 6 and 6 -> equal.\n                current_total = (2+1)+(6-3)=3+3=6 -> index=6.\n                then extend Alice: e=3 -> but e+1=3, and r=3 -> e+1<r? 3<3 -> false -> break.\n            output 6.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But note: in the first equal branch, we recorded 2, then 4, then 6. We take the last one? \n\n        But we are updating index to the last equal we see? \n\n        And we want the maximum total candies, and 6 is the maximum.\n\n        However, we are not comparing and taking the maximum? we are setting index=6 and then output 6.\n\n        But what if we have two equals and the first one is larger? \n\n        Example: [1,1,0,0,1,1] \n            We want: \n                Alice: [0,1] (1+1=2), Bob: [4,5] (1+1=2) -> total 4 candies.\n                But also: \n                    Alice: [0,1,2,3] (1+1+0+0=2), Bob: [2,3,4,5] (0+0+1+1=2) -> total 8? but we only have 6 candies.\n\n            Actually, the candies are: \n                index0:1, index1:1, index2:0, index3:0, index4:1, index5:1.\n\n            How can we get 8? we only have 6.\n\n            But note: the two segments must be disjoint. So Alice and Bob cannot both take index2 and 3.\n\n            So the maximum is 4.\n\n            Let me run the code:\n\n                e=0, r=5: \n                    lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal: current_total = (0+1)+(6-5)=1+1=2 -> index=2.\n                    then extend Alice: e=1, lowest=1+1=2, g=2.\n                then: e=1, r=5: 2 and 1 -> so Alice>Bob -> extend Bob: r=4, highest=1+1=2, h=2.\n                then: e=1, r=4: 2 and 2 -> equal: current_total = (1+1)+(6-4)=2+2=4 -> index=4.\n                    then extend Alice: e=2, lowest=2+0=2, g=3.\n                then: e=2, r=4: 2 and 2 -> equal: current_total = (2+1)+(6-4)=3+2=5 -> index=5? \n                    but wait: Alice has eaten [0,1,2] -> 3 candies, Bob has eaten [4,5] -> 2 candies? total 5? \n                    and the sums: Alice=1+1+0=2, Bob=1+1=2 -> so it is valid.\n                then extend Alice: e=3, lowest=2+0=2, g=4.\n                then: e=3, r=4: 2 and 2 -> equal: current_total = (3+1)+(6-4)=4+2=6 -> index=6.\n                    then extend Alice: e=4 -> but e+1=4, r=4 -> 4<4 is false -> break.\n                output 6.\n\n            But wait, we have 6 candies? \n                Alice: [0,1,2,3] -> 1+1+0+0=2\n                Bob: [4,5] -> 1+1=2\n                total 6 candies.\n\n            And that is valid.\n\n            So the answer is 6.\n\n            But the problem: \n                Alice must eat from the left (contiguous) and Bob from the right (contiguous). \n                Alice: [0,1,2,3] is contiguous from the left? \n                Bob: [4,5] is contiguous from the right? \n                and they are disjoint.\n\n            So 6 is valid.\n\n            But note: the entire array is eaten? and the sums are equal.\n\n            So 6 is the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, the code works.\n\n        But note: we are not taking the maximum over the recorded indices, we are only setting index to the last recorded equal. \n\n        However, in the example above, we set index=2, then 4, then 5, then 6. So we output 6.\n\n        But what if we have an equal that is not the last one and is larger? \n\n        Example: [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2] \n            We want: \n                Alice: [0] (2), Bob: [5] (2) -> total 2.\n                Alice: [0,1,2] (2+1+1=4), Bob: [3,4,5] (1+1+2=4) -> total 6.\n\n            So the maximum is 6.\n\n            Run:\n\n                e=0, r=5: 2 and 2 -> equal: record (0+1)+(6-5)=1+1=2 -> index=2.\n                then extend Alice: e=1, lowest=2+1=3.\n                then: 3>2 -> extend Bob: r=4, highest=2+1=3.\n                then: 3==3 -> record: (1+1)+(6-4)=2+2=4 -> index=4.\n                then extend Alice: e=2, lowest=3+1=4.\n                then: 4>3 -> extend Bob: r=3, highest=3+1=4.\n                then: 4==4 -> record: (2+1)+(6-3)=3+3=6 -> index=6.\n                then extend Alice: e=3 -> but e+1=3, r=3 -> break.\n\n            output 6.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But note: we are not comparing with the previous maximum, we are overwriting. \n\n        However, the last equal is the largest because we are extending. \n\n        But what if we have:\n\n            [1,0,0,0,0,1]\n\n            We can have:\n                Alice: [0] (1), Bob: [5] (1) -> total 2.\n                Alice: [0,1,2,3,4] (1+0+0+0+0=1), Bob: [1,2,3,4,5] (0+0+0+0+1=1) -> total 6.\n\n            So the last one is 6.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply do:\n\n            in the equal branch: \n                index = (e+1) + (m - r)   # we record the current total for this equal state\n                then we extend Alice.\n\n        But note: we are not storing the maximum, we are storing the last recorded. \n\n        However, the last recorded is the one with the most candies because we are extending.\n\n        But consider:\n\n            [1,1,0,1,1]\n\n            n=5.\n\n            e=0, r=4: 1 and 1 -> record: (0+1)+(5-4)=1+1=2 -> then extend Alice: e=1, lowest=1+1=2.\n            then: 2>1 -> extend Bob: r=3, highest=1+1=2.\n            then: 2==2 -> record: (1+1)+(5-3)=2+2=4 -> then extend Alice: e=2, lowest=2+0=2.\n            then: 2==2 -> record: (2+1)+(5-3)=3+2=5 -> then extend Alice: e=3 -> but e+1=3, r=3 -> 3<3 false -> break.\n\n            output 5.\n\n            But wait: \n                Alice: [0,1,2] -> 1+1+0=2\n                Bob: [3,4] -> 1+1=2\n                total 5 candies? \n                Alice: 3 candies, Bob: 2 candies -> total 5.\n\n            But we can also do:\n                Alice: [0,1,2,3] -> 1+1+0+1=3\n                Bob: [4] -> 1 -> not equal.\n\n                Alice: [0] -> 1, Bob: [4] -> 1 -> 2 candies.\n\n                Alice: [0,1] -> 2, Bob: [3,4] -> 2 -> 4 candies.\n\n            So 5 is not valid? because when we extended to e=2, we had:\n                Alice: [0,1,2] -> 1+1+0=2\n                Bob: [3,4] -> 1+1=2 -> valid, total 5? \n                But wait, Bob's segment: from the right, contiguous: [3,4] is contiguous from the right? \n                And Alice: [0,1,2] is contiguous from the left.\n\n                And they are disjoint? \n                    Alice: indices 0,1,2\n                    Bob: indices 3,4 -> disjoint.\n\n                So 5 candies: 3+2=5.\n\n            But the total candies is 5, which is the entire array? \n                However, the array has 5 candies. \n\n            But note: the problem says: they eat in total. And they are disjoint. \n\n            So 5 is valid.\n\n            But wait, the sums: Alice=2, Bob=2 -> equal.\n\n            So 5 is valid and the maximum.\n\n        Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n        However, note: in the example above, we recorded 2, then 4, then 5. We output 5.\n\n        But what if we have an equal state that is not the last and is larger than the last? \n\n        Example: [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3] \n            We can have:\n                Alice: [0] (3), Bob: [5] (3) -> total 2.\n                Alice: [0,1,2] (3+1+1=5), Bob: [3,4,5] (1+1+3=5) -> total 6.\n\n            So the maximum is 6.\n\n            Run:\n\n                e=0, r=5: 3 and 3 -> record 2, then extend Alice: e=1, lowest=4.\n                then: 4>3 -> extend Bob: r=4, highest=3+1=4.\n                then: 4==4 -> record: (1+1)+(6-4)=2+2=4 -> then extend Alice: e=2, lowest=4+1=5.\n                then: 5>4 -> extend Bob: r=3, highest=4+1=5.\n                then: 5==5 -> record: (2+1)+(6-3)=3+3=6 -> then extend Alice: e=3 -> but e+1=3, r=3 -> break.\n\n            output 6.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n            [1,2,1,2] \n            n=4.\n\n            e=0, r=3: 1 and 2 -> lowest<highest: extend Alice: e=1, lowest=1+2=3.\n            then: 3>2 -> extend Bob: r=2, highest=2+1=3.\n            then: 3==3 -> record: (1+1)+(4-2)=2+2=4 -> then extend Alice: e=2 -> but e+1=2, r=2 -> break.\n\n            output 4.\n\n            But the entire array is eaten? \n                Alice: [0,1] -> 1+2=3\n                Bob: [2,3] -> 1+2=3\n                total 4.\n\n            Valid.\n\n        Therefore, we will complete the missing branch as:\n\n            elif highest<lowest:\n                if r-1 > e:   # meaning there is at least one candy between e and r for Bob\n                    r -= 1\n                    highest += lst[r]   # because we are moving r to the left, so we take the candy at the new r (which is the next from the right)\n                    h += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        And we change the while loop condition to: `while e < r and h+g <= m`\n\n        But note: the condition `h+g<=m` is redundant? because we are not eating more than m candies? \n        But we are counting the candies: h is Bob's count, g is Alice's count, and we are adding one at a time. \n        And we break when h+g would exceed m? \n\n        But we also break when e>=r, which means we have no more candies to take. \n\n        So we can remove `h+g<=m`? \n\n        However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can use either.\n\n        But to be safe, we can keep both.\n\n        However, the condition `e < r` is necessary to avoid overlapping.\n\n        Now, what about initialization of `index`? \n            We set index=0 at the beginning. \n            If we never have an equal, we output 0.\n\n        But what if we have an equal at the beginning? we set index=2 (for example) and then we extend and then we break and output 2? \n\n        But what if we have an equal later that is 0? we don't want to output 0 if we had a non-zero before.\n\n        But we are overwriting index. \n\n        We want the maximum total candies during any equal state.\n\n        So we should do: \n            index = max(index, current_total)\n\n        But in the provided code, we are not doing that. We are setting index = current_total in the equal branch.\n\n        But note: we are extending and then we might get a larger total later.\n\n        And we are overwriting index with the latest total.\n\n        But the latest total is the largest because we are adding candies.\n\n        However, consider:\n\n            [1, 3, 1, 3] \n            n=4.\n\n            e=0, r=3: 1 and 3 -> extend Alice: e=1, lowest=1+3=4.\n            then: 4>3 -> extend Bob: r=2, highest=3+1=4.\n            then: 4==4 -> record: (1+1)+(4-2)=2+2=4 -> index=4.\n            then extend Alice: e=2 -> but e+1=2, r=2 -> break.\n\n            output 4.\n\n            But what if we had stopped earlier? \n                At the first state: 1 and 3 -> not equal, then we extended and got 4 and 4 -> 4 candies.\n\n            But what if we had an alternative: \n                Alice: [0] (1), Bob: [3] (3) -> not equal -> skip.\n                Alice: [0,1] (4), Bob: [2,3] (4) -> 4 candies.\n\n            So 4 is the maximum.\n\n        But consider:\n\n            [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] \n            We might have an equal at some point? \n                Alice: [1] (1), Bob: [10] (10) -> not equal.\n                ... \n                unlikely.\n\n            So we output 0.\n\n        But what if we have:\n\n            [1, 2, 3, 6] \n            Alice: [1,2] (1+2=3), Bob: [3] (3) -> total 3 candies.\n\n            How does the code run?\n                e=0, r=3: 1 and 6 -> 1<6: extend Alice: e=1, lowest=1+2=3.\n                then: 3<6: extend Alice: e=2, lowest=3+3=6.\n                then: 6==6: record: (2+1)+(4-3)=3+1=4 -> then extend Alice: e=3 -> but e+1=3, r=3 -> break.\n                output 4.\n\n            But wait: \n                Alice: [0,1,2] -> 1+2+3=6\n                Bob: [3] -> 6\n                total 4 candies.\n\n            Valid.\n\n        Therefore, we complete the code as:\n\n            We change the while loop condition to: `while e < r and h+g <= m`\n            and in the missing branch:\n\n            elif highest<lowest:\n                if r-1 > e:\n                    r -= 1\n                    highest += lst[r]\n                    h += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But note: in the first branch, we do:\n            if lowest < highest:\n                if e+1 < r:\n                    e += 1\n                    lowest += lst[e]   # because we are at e, and we move e to e+1 and take that candy.\n                    g += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        However, the provided code in the first branch does:\n\n            lowest += lst[e+1]\n            e += 1\n            g += 1\n\n        This is equivalent to:\n\n            e += 1\n            lowest += lst[e]   # because before the update, e is the old index, and we are taking lst[e+1] which is the new e.\n\n        But we can write it as:\n\n            e += 1\n            lowest += lst[e]\n\n        But the provided code does:\n\n            lowest += lst[e+1]   # when e is the current, then we add the next one at e+1, then set e to e+1.\n\n        So it is the same.\n\n        But in the branch for highest<lowest, we are doing:\n\n            r -= 1\n            highest += lst[r]\n\n        This is the same as:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]   # when r is the current, then we add the next right candy at r-1, then set r to r-1.\n\n        But note: the provided code in the first branch uses `lst[e+1]` and then updates e to e+1.\n\n        In the branch for highest<lowest, we should do:\n\n            highest += lst[r-1]\n            r -= 1\n            h += 1\n\n        But that is the same as:\n\n            r -= 1\n            highest += lst[r]\n\n        So we can do either.\n\n        We'll do the latter for clarity.\n\n        Now, what about the initial state? \n            We set:\n                e=0, r=m-1\n                lowest = lst[0]\n                highest = lst[m-1]\n\n            Then we enter the loop.\n\n        But note: if the first candy and the last candy are equal, we record index = (0+1)+(m - (m-1)) = 1+1=2.\n\n        And then we extend Alice.\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        But what if there is only one candy? \n            m=1: \n                e=0, r=0 -> while e<r and h+g<=m: \n                    e<r -> 0<0 -> false -> skip the loop.\n                then print index=0.\n\n            Correct.\n\n        What if m=2: [1,1]\n            e=0, r=1: 0<1 -> true, and h+g=1+1=2<=2 -> true.\n            then: lowest=1, highest=1 -> equal: \n                current_total = (0+1)+(2-1)=1+1=2 -> index=2.\n                then extend Alice: e+1=1, which is not < r (which is 1) -> 1<1 false -> break.\n            output 2.\n\n        Correct.\n\n        Therefore, we complete program1.py as:\n\n            Change the while loop condition to: `while e < r and h+g <= m`\n            and the missing branch:\n\n                elif highest<lowest:\n                    if r-1 > e:\n                        r -= 1\n                        highest += lst[r]\n                        h += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n        But note: the condition in the while loop: `h+g<=m` might be redundant? because we are also checking e<r, and we are only moving one candy at a time. \n        But to be safe, we leave it.\n\n        However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: the condition `r-1 > e` is equivalent to `r-1 >= e+1`? \n            We require that after we do r-=1, we have r>e? \n            Actually, we require that the new r is at least e+1? \n            But we are only moving one step, so we require that the current r is at least e+2? \n\n        Specifically, we are going to set r_new = r-1, and we require that r_new > e -> so r-1 > e.\n\n        Similarly, in the left branch: we require e+1 < r -> so e+1 <= r-1 -> which is the same as e < r-1.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            in the left branch: if e < r-1: \n            in the right branch: if r-1 > e:   -> same as e < r-1.\n\n        So we can write:\n\n            if e < r-1: \n                ... for both branches.\n\n        But for clarity, we leave as is.\n\n        Now, for program2.py:\n\n        We are to complete:\n\n            from bisect import bisect\n            b = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n            for i in range(int(input())): # TODO: Your code here\n\n        The problem: \n            Given a rating, output the division.\n\n            Division 1: rating >= 1900\n            Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n            Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n            Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\n        We have a list b = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n\n        We can use bisect to find the division.\n\n        Note: \n            If rating is in [1400, 1599] -> division 3.\n            The list b defines boundaries: \n                division 4: rating < 1400 -> so in the interval [-5001, 1400) -> but note: the lower bound is -5001, and then 1400 is the start of division 3.\n\n            We can do:\n\n                idx = bisect.bisect_right(b, rating)   # or bisect_left?\n\n            We want:\n\n                rating < 1400 -> division 4 -> which is the first interval: index0 to index1? \n\n            Actually, we can define:\n\n                divisions = [4, 3, 2, 1]\n\n                The boundaries: \n                    division 4: rating < 1400 -> so if rating < 1400, then division 4.\n                    division 3: 1400 <= rating < 1600\n                    division 2: 1600 <= rating < 1900\n                    division 1: rating >= 1900\n\n            We have b = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n\n            We can use:\n\n                pos = bisect.bisect_left(b, rating)\n\n            But note: \n                if rating = 1399 -> then bisect_left(b, 1399) returns the index of the first element >=1399 -> which is 1 (1400) -> but we want division 4.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                pos = bisect.bisect_right(b, rating)   # returns the insertion position to keep order.\n\n            For rating=1399: \n                b = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n                1399: would be inserted at index1? because 1399 is between -5001 and 1400? \n                so bisect_right returns 1? \n\n            Then we can set: division = 4 - (pos-1) ? \n\n            But we have 4 divisions.\n\n            Alternatively, we can note:\n\n                division = 4 - (pos - 1) = 5-pos? \n\n            Let me test:\n\n                rating=1399 -> pos=1 -> division = 5-1=4 -> correct.\n                rating=1400 -> bisect_right(b,1400): \n                    b[1]=1400, so 1400 is inserted at index2? because bisect_right returns the insertion position after the last 1400? \n                    But the list is sorted, and bisect_right returns the insertion position to the right of the last 1400? \n                    Actually, for bisect_right, it returns the insertion position to maintain sorted order, such that the new value would be after any existing entries of rating.\n\n                    So for 1400: \n                        we have b[1]=1400, then the next is 1600. \n                        bisect_right(1400) returns 2.\n\n                    then division = 5-2=3 -> correct.\n\n                rating=1599: \n                    bisect_right(1599) -> between 1400 and 1600 -> returns 2? \n                    division=5-2=3 -> correct.\n\n                rating=1600: \n                    bisect_right(1600) -> returns 3? because 1600 is at index2, and we insert after -> index3.\n                    division=5-3=2 -> correct.\n\n                rating=1899: \n                    returns 3? -> division=2 -> correct.\n\n                rating=1900: \n                    returns 4? -> division=5-4=1 -> correct.\n\n                rating=5000: \n                    returns 4? -> division=1.\n\n                rating=-5000: \n                    bisect_right(-5000) -> in the list, -5001 is at index0, then -5000 would be inserted at index1? \n                    so returns 1 -> division=4.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                for i in range(int(input())):\n                    rating = int(input().strip())\n                    pos = bisect.bisect_right(b, rating)\n                    div = 5 - pos   # because we have 4 divisions, and the boundaries are at indices 1,2,3 in the list b (which has 4 elements: indices0,1,2,3)\n\n            But note: the list b has 4 elements: [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900] -> so the possible values for pos: 0,1,2,3,4.\n\n            And we want:\n                pos=0 -> rating < -5001? -> but the rating is at least -5000, so this won't happen? \n                Actually, the rating is from -5000 to 5000, and the smallest in b is -5001, so the smallest rating (-5000) is greater than -5001 -> so bisect_right(-5000) returns 1.\n\n            So we are safe.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do without bisect:\n\n            if rating >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif rating >= 1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif rating >= 1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\")\n\n        But the problem says to complete the given code, which uses bisect.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            from bisect import bisect_right as br   # or we can use bisect, but the function is called bisect.bisect_right\n\n            Actually, we have: \n                import bisect   -> but we did `from bisect import bisect` -> that imports the function `bisect` which is bisect_right? \n\n            The module bisect has:\n                bisect.bisect_left and bisect.bisect_right (and bisect.bisect is an alias for bisect_right).\n\n            We did: `from bisect import bisect` -> so we have a function `bisect` that is the same as `bisect_right`.\n\n            So we can do:\n\n                for i in range(int(input())):\n                    rating = int(input().strip())\n                    pos = bisect(b, rating)   # same as bisect_right\n                    print(\"Division\", 5-pos)\n\n        But note: the problem output: \"Division X\" with X an integer.\n\n        Example: \n            rating = 2300 -> pos = bisect_right(b,2300) -> 4 -> 5-4=1 -> \"Division 1\"\n\n        So we complete program2.py as:\n\n            for i in range(int(input())):\n                rating = int(input().strip())\n                pos = bisect(b, rating)\n                print(\"Division\", 5-pos)\n\n        But wait: the problem output must be exactly as: \"Division X\", so we can do:\n\n            print(\"Division \" + str(5-pos))\n\n        or \n\n            print(f\"Division {5-pos}\")\n\n        But the problem says: output the division in the format \"Division X\".\n\n        However, the example: \n            Input: 7\n                    -789\n                    1299\n                    1300\n                    1399\n                    1400\n                    1679\n                    2300\n\n            Output: \n                Division 4\n                Division 4\n                Division 4\n                Division 4\n                Division 3\n                Division 2\n                Division 1\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            print(\"Division\", 5-pos)   -> this will print: Division 4, etc.\n\n        But note: the output has a space between \"Division\" and the number.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            print(\"Division \" + str(5-pos))\n\n        But the first version: print(\"Division\", 5-pos) will also print with a space.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            for i in range(int(input())):\n                rating = int(input())\n                pos = bisect(b, rating)\n                print(\"Division\", 5-pos)\n\n        But note: the problem says the first line of input is t, then t lines of ratings.\n\n        We are reading t = int(input()), then for each test case, we read an integer.\n\n        So the code is:\n\n            from bisect import bisect\n            b = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for i in range(t):\n                rating = int(input().strip())\n                pos = bisect(b, rating)\n                print(\"Division\", 5-pos)\n\n        But the provided code starts:\n\n            for i in range(int(input())):   # so we are reading the integer and then iterating.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            from bisect import bisect\n            b = [-5001, 1400, 1600, 1900]\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                rating = int(input())\n                pos = bisect(b, rating)\n                print(\"Division\", 5-pos)\n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the input has one integer per test case.\n\n        So we output:\n\n            program1: \n                We change the while condition and add the missing branch.\n\n            program2:\n                We complete the for loop.\n\n        Now, we output in the JSON format:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"completion for program1\",\n                \"program2\": \"completion for program2\"\n            }\n\n        We must output only the missing code? \n\n        But for program1, we are changing the while condition and adding a block.\n\n        The provided program1 code:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            for i in range(n):\n                h = 1\n                g = 1\n                counter = 0\n                m = int(input())\n                lst = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                index =0\n                e= 0\n                r =m-1\n                highest = lst[m-1]\n                lowest = lst[0]\n                while h+g <= m:\n                    if lowest<highest:\n                        lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                        e+=1\n                        g +=1\n                    elif highest<lowest:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    elif highest == lowest:\n                        lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                        e+=1\n                        g+=1\n                        index = e + (m - r)\n                print(index)\n\n        We change the while condition to: `while e < r and h+g <= m`\n\n        And we complete the missing branch with:\n\n            elif highest<lowest:\n                if r-1 > e:\n                    r -= 1\n                    highest += lst[r]\n                    h += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n        But note: the code in the equal branch: \n            we are setting `index = e + (m - r)` -> but we want to record the maximum, and we are not comparing. \n\n        However, as argued, the last equal state has the most candies. \n\n        But to be safe and match the known solution, we should record every time we have an equal and take the maximum. \n\n        But the problem says: output only the missing code. \n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        We are also changing the while condition. \n\n        But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and we are changing one line and adding one block.\n\n        We can output the entire while loop? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT the entire program\".\n\n        Alternatively, we can output:\n\n            For program1: \n                We change the while loop condition and add the missing branch.\n\n            Specifically, we output:\n\n                while e < r and h+g <= m:\n                    if lowest<highest:\n                        if e+1 < r:\n                            lowest+=lst[e+1]\n                            e+=1\n                            g +=1\n                        else:\n                            break\n                    elif highest<lowest:\n                        if r-1 > e:\n                            r -= 1\n                            highest += lst[r]\n                            h += 1\n                        else:\n                            break\n                    elif highest == lowest:\n                        # We record the current total: (e+1)+(m-r)\n                        current_total = (e+1) + (m - r)\n                        if current_total > index:\n                            index = current_total\n                        if e+1 < r:\n                            lowest += lst[e+1]\n                            e += 1\n                            g += 1\n                        else:\n                            break\n\n            But wait, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we only output the parts that are missing?

We are replacing it.\n\n        We'll output for program1 the entire while loop block as a string.\n\n        Specifically:\n\n            while e < r and h+g <= m:\n                if lowest < highest:\n                    if e"
