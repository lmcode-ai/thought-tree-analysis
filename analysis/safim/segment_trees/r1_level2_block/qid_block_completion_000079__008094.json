But the example says: no operation is required -> so the original string is good? However, the original string \"000011\" is split into: \"0000\" and \"11\", which are two segments of even length -> so it is good. How many operations? 0. But our algorithm: we have a solution with 0 operations? yes: we assign:\n                block0: color0 -> cost0=0 -> \"00\" -> good. block1: color0 -> cost0=0 -> \"00\" -> good. block2: color1 -> cost1=0 -> \"11\" -> good. Then the total cost is 0, and the segments: \n                block0=0, block1=0 -> same, so no break? then block2=1 -> break at block1 and block2? So the entire string: \n                    block0 and block1: same color (0) -> merged? so one segment for the first four zeros? then block2: one segment for the last two ones?

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given multiple test cases. The total length of all strings is <= 200000.\n The problem: We have a binary string of even length. We want to make it \"good\", meaning that when we split it into contiguous segments of identical characters (minimal splitting), every segment has even length.\n\n Observation:\n In a good string, note that the entire string must be split into segments of even length. This implies that the entire string must have the same character in positions of the same parity? Not exactly.\n\n However, note the following:\n - The minimal splitting: we break at every change. Then we require each segment to have even length.\n\n But note: we can change some bits arbitrarily. We are to minimize the number of operations and then among those solutions, minimize the number of subsegments.\n\n Alternate approach from known solutions to similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #789 (Div. 2) Problem B2) or known techniques:\n\n Insight:\n Since the entire string must be partitioned into contiguous segments of even length, we can think of the string as being partitioned into blocks of two (adjacent) characters. Each block of two must be either \"00\" or \"11\" for the segment to be even? Not exactly: because a segment might be longer than 2. However, if we have a segment of length k (which must be even), then it will cover k/2 consecutive two-character blocks.\n\n But note: the problem does not require that the entire string is one segment. It can be multiple segments, each of even length.\n\n How do we count operations?\n Consider: if we have a block of two adjacent characters (say at positions 2i and 2i+1) that are different, then we must change at least one of them to make the two the same? Why? Because if we leave them different, then we break the segment at the middle? Actually, if we have two adjacent characters that are different, then the minimal segmentation will break at that point. However, we require that each segment has even length. So if we have a segment that ends at an odd index (0-indexed) and the next segment starts at the next even index? Actually, the segmentation is done by consecutive same characters. \n\n However, note: the problem allows us to change characters arbitrarily. We are allowed to change any character to 0 or 1.\n\n Alternate known solution for the same problem (from known contests):\n\n We note that the entire string must be partitioned into segments of even length. Therefore, we can break the string into blocks of two. But note: a segment might cover several consecutive two-character blocks that are the same.\n\n How about we consider the two-character blocks? For each block i (from 0 to n/2 - 1), we have a pair (s[2i], s[2i+1]).\n\n In a good string, we require that within a segment, all the two-character blocks must be the same? Actually, no: a segment of even length might be 4, then it covers two consecutive two-character blocks. But if the two two-character blocks are the same, then we can merge them? Actually, if we have two consecutive two-character blocks that are both \"00\", then we can merge them into one segment of length 4. But if we have \"00\" then \"11\", then we break.\n\n Therefore, the entire string is partitioned by the two-character blocks that are the same? Actually, the segmentation is determined by the boundaries between two consecutive two-character blocks that are different? But note: we can change the characters arbitrarily.\n\n How to minimize operations?\n We can change any character arbitrarily. Therefore, for each two-character block, we can choose to make it either \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", or \"11\". However, note that if we make it \"01\" or \"10\", then we break the segment? Actually, if we have a two-character block that is not uniform, then we break the segment? Not exactly: because the segmentation is done by consecutive same characters. But if we have a two-character block that is \"01\", then we have two segments: [0] and [1] in that block? That would be two segments of length 1, which is odd -> not allowed.\n\n Therefore, we must have each two-character block as either \"00\" or \"11\". Why?\n Because if we have a two-character block that is not uniform, then we get two segments of length 1 (which are odd) and that is not allowed. So we must fix every two-character block to be uniform.\n\n However, wait: what if we have a segment that spans multiple two-character blocks? Then the entire segment must be of the same character. For example, if we have two consecutive two-character blocks: \"00\" and \"00\", then we can merge them. But if we have \"00\" and \"11\", then we break.\n\n Therefore, the problem reduces to:\n 1. For each two-character block, we must change at most two characters to make it uniform. The minimal operations for a block is 0 if it is already \"00\" or \"11\", and 1 if it is \"01\" or \"10\".\n\n 2. Then, we have a new string of two-character blocks, each block is either \"00\" or \"11\". Now we want to minimize the number of segments. The segments are broken when two adjacent blocks are different. So the number of segments is 1 plus the number of adjacent block pairs that are different.\n\n But note: we are allowed to choose the value for each two-character block arbitrarily? Actually, we have two choices for each block: we can make it \"00\" or \"11\". However, we might have already fixed some characters? Actually, we can choose arbitrarily as long as we fix the block to be uniform. But note: we are also allowed to change the characters arbitrarily, so we can choose to make the block either \"00\" or \"11\" with the minimal cost.\n\n However, the minimal cost for a block is:\n   if the block is \"00\": we can leave it as \"00\" (cost 0) or change it to \"11\" (cost 2? but we can do it with 2 operations, but we can also do it with 1 operation? Actually, we can change one character to make it \"01\" or \"10\", but that is not uniform. We must make it uniform. So to change \"00\" to \"11\", we can change both? but that is 2 operations. Alternatively, we can change one character to make it \"01\" or \"10\", but that is not uniform. So we must change both? Actually, no: we can change one character to make it \"01\", but then we have to fix that in the next step? \n\n Actually, the problem does not require that we fix the block independently. We are allowed to change any character arbitrarily. However, for a given block, we can fix it to uniform in min( number of changes to make it \"00\", number of changes to make it \"11\"). \n\n But note: to make a block uniform, we can do:\n   if the block is \"00\": \n        to \"00\": 0 changes; to \"11\": 2 changes.\n   if the block is \"01\":\n        to \"00\": change the second character: 1 change; to \"11\": change the first character: 1 change.\n   similarly for \"10\": 1 change to make either \"00\" or \"11\".\n\n Therefore, for each block i, we have:\n   cost0[i] = 0 if the block is \"00\", 2 if the block is \"11\", and 1 if the block is mixed? Actually, no:\n        if we want to make the block \"00\": \n            cost00 = (0 if first is '0' else 1) + (0 if second is '0' else 1)\n        similarly, cost11 = (0 if first is '1' else 1) + (0 if second is '1' else 1)\n\n But note: we are free to choose either \"00\" or \"11\". So the minimal cost for the block is min(cost00, cost11). However, we also have to consider that we are going to assign a value (0 or 1) to the entire block, and then the next block we can choose independently? But the number of segments depends on the consecutive choices.\n\n Therefore, we have two independent decisions: \n   - We must assign a color (0 or 1) to each two-character block (meaning we make the block \"00\" or \"11\") with a cost that depends on the original block.\n   - Then the entire sequence of blocks becomes a sequence of colors (0 for \"00\", 1 for \"11\"). The number of segments is the number of contiguous groups of the same color. That is 1 (for the first block) plus the number of indices i (from 0 to k-2) such that block i != block i+1.\n\n We want to minimize the total cost (which is the sum of the minimal cost for each block? but note: we are allowed to choose the color arbitrarily, so we can choose the color that minimizes the cost for the block, but then we also care about the adjacent blocks for the segment count) and then we also want to minimize the number of segments.\n\n However, note: the problem asks for two things:\n   - The minimum number of operations (which is the total cost) to make the string good.\n   - Among all solutions with that minimum total cost, the minimum number of segments.\n\n How to do that?\n\n We can use dynamic programming for the entire sequence of blocks? But note: the total length of the string over test cases is 200000, but the number of blocks is n/2, so total blocks over test cases is <= 100000. However, the problem states that the total n over test cases is <= 200000, so total blocks is <= 100000.\n\n But note: we have two choices per block. We can do:\n\n   Let dp[i][0] = (min_total_cost, min_segments) for the first i blocks, if the i-th block is assigned color 0.\n   Similarly, dp[i][1] = (min_total_cost, min_segments) for the first i blocks, if the i-th block is assigned color 1.\n\n However, the state is the color of the last block. The transitions:\n\n   dp[0][0] = (cost0[0], 1)\n   dp[0][1] = (cost1[0], 1)\n\n   For i>=1:\n        dp[i][0] = \n            Option1: from dp[i-1][0] -> then if we choose 0 again, the segment count doesn't increase? \n                total_cost = dp[i-1][0][0] + cost0[i]\n                segments = dp[i-1][0][1]   (because same color, so no new segment)\n            Option2: from dp[i-1][1] -> then we choose 0, so we break the segment -> \n                total_cost = dp[i-1][1][0] + cost0[i]\n                segments = dp[i-1][1][1] + 1\n\n        Then we take the min by total_cost, and if total_cost is the same, then min by segments.\n\n        Similarly for dp[i][1].\n\n But note: we are to minimize the number of segments only among the solutions with minimal total cost? Actually, the problem says: \"the minimum number of subsegments that s can be divided into among all solutions with the minimum number of operations\".\n\n Therefore, we must first minimize the total cost, and then minimize the number of segments.\n\n However, we can do:\n\n   We design the state: \n        dp[i][c] = (total_cost, segments) for the first i blocks ending with color c.\n\n   Then we update:\n\n        dp[i][0] = min( \n            (dp[i-1][0][0] + cost0[i], dp[i-1][0][1]),   # same color as previous\n            (dp[i-1][1][0] + cost0[i], dp[i-1][1][1] + 1)\n        ) \n\n   But how to compare? We first compare by total_cost, then by segments.\n\n   Similarly for color 1.\n\n   We can represent the state as a tuple (total_cost, segments) and then take the min: first key total_cost, second key segments.\n\n   However, note: we have two options for each state. We want the minimal total_cost, and then the minimal segments for that total_cost.\n\n   Actually, we can do:\n\n        candidate0 = []\n        candidate0.append( (dp0_prev0[0] + cost0[i], dp0_prev0[1]) )   # same color\n        candidate0.append( (dp0_prev1[0] + cost0[i], dp0_prev1[1] + 1) )\n\n        Then we choose the candidate0 with the smallest total_cost, and if two have the same total_cost, then the smallest segments.\n\n        Similarly for color 1.\n\n But note: the state for the previous block: we have two states: (cost0, seg0) for color0 and (cost1, seg1) for color1.\n\n However, the problem: the total cost for the entire string is the sum of the costs for each block? Yes.\n\n But note: the cost for a block i if we assign color 0 is cost0[i] = (1 if the first char is not '0') + (1 if the second char is not '0')\n          similarly, cost1[i] = (1 if the first char is not '1') + (1 if the second char is not '1')\n\n However, we are allowed to change independently. So we can precompute for each block i:\n\n   block = s[2*i:2*i+2]\n   cost0_i = (1 if block[0]!='0') + (1 if block[1]!='0')\n   cost1_i = (1 if block[0]!='1') + (1 if block[1]!='1')\n\n But note: the problem says the string is given as a binary string.\n\n However, the constraints: total n <= 200000, so we can do this.\n\n But note: the problem has multiple test cases, and the total n is 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case? Actually, the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do O(n) per test case? Actually, the total n is 200000, so we can do one pass per test case.\n\n However, the problem says: the first line is t (number of test cases), then for each test case: n and a string of length n. And the total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n Therefore, we can do:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        s = input().strip()\n\n        blocks = n // 2\n        # Precompute cost0 and cost1 for each block\n        cost0 = []\n        cost1 = []\n        for i in range(blocks):\n            a = s[2*i]\n            b = s[2*i+1]\n            c0 = (0 if a=='0' else 1) + (0 if b=='0' else 1)\n            c1 = (0 if a=='1' else 1) + (0 if b=='1' else 1)\n            cost0.append(c0)\n            cost1.append(c1)\n\n        # Now we do DP for the blocks\n        # dp0: state for current block being 0: (total_cost, segments)\n        # dp1: state for current block being 1: (total_cost, segments)\n        # Initialize for the first block (i=0)\n        dp0 = (cost0[0], 1)   # using color0 for the first block: cost = cost0[0], and we have 1 segment.\n        dp1 = (cost1[0], 1)\n\n        for i in range(1, blocks):\n            # For color0 at block i:\n            #   Option1: previous block is 0 -> then we don't break the segment\n            option00 = (dp0[0] + cost0[i], dp0[1])\n            #   Option2: previous block is 1 -> then we break the segment (so segments = dp1[1] + 1)\n            option10 = (dp1[0] + cost0[i], dp1[1] + 1)\n\n            # We want the minimal total_cost, and then minimal segments\n            # Compare option00 and option10: first by total_cost, then by segments.\n            if option00[0] < option10[0]:\n                new0 = option00\n            elif option00[0] > option10[0]:\n                new0 = option10\n            else:\n                # same cost, then take the one with smaller segments\n                new0 = (option00[0], min(option00[1], option10[1]))\n\n            # Similarly for color1 at block i:\n            option01 = (dp0[0] + cost1[i], dp0[1] + 1)\n            option11 = (dp1[0] + cost1[i], dp1[1])\n\n            if option01[0] < option11[0]:\n                new1 = option01\n            elif option01[0] > option11[0]:\n                new1 = option11\n            else:\n                new1 = (option01[0], min(option01[1], option11[1]))\n\n            dp0, dp1 = new0, new1\n\n        # Now, we have two states for the entire sequence: dp0 and dp1.\n        # We choose the one with minimal total_cost, and then minimal segments.\n        if dp0[0] < dp1[0]:\n            total_ops = dp0[0]\n            min_segments = dp0[1]\n        elif dp0[0] > dp1[0]:\n            total_ops = dp1[0]\n            min_segments = dp1[1]\n        else:\n            total_ops = dp0[0]\n            min_segments = min(dp0[1], dp1[1])\n\n        print(total_ops, min_segments)\n\n However, note: the example test case: \n        \"11000000\" -> n=8, blocks: \n          block0: \"11\" -> cost0: (1 if '1'!='0'? 1) + (1 if '1'!='0'? 1) = 2; cost1: 0+0=0.\n          block1: \"00\" -> cost0:0, cost1:2\n          block2: \"00\" -> cost0:0, cost1:2\n          block3: \"00\" -> cost0:0, cost1:2\n\n        Then we do:\n          i=0: dp0 = (2,1), dp1=(0,1)\n          i=1: \n             for color0: \n                 option00: (2+0, 1) = (2,1); option10: (0+0, 1+1) = (0,2) -> new0 = (0,2) because 0<2? \n                 but wait: we compare by cost: 2 vs 0 -> 0 is smaller -> new0 = (0,2)\n             for color1:\n                 option01: (2+2, 1+1) = (4,2); option11: (0+2, 1) = (2,1) -> new1 = (2,1) because 2<4.\n\n          Then i=2: \n             for color0: \n                 from dp0: (0,2) -> (0+0, 2) = (0,2); from dp1: (2+0, 1+1)= (2,2) -> new0 = (0,2)\n             for color1:\n                 from dp0: (0+2, 2+1)= (2,3); from dp1: (2+2, 1) = (4,1) -> new1 = (2,3) [because 2<4] but wait: we have two options: (2,3) and (4,1) -> we take (2,3) because 2<4? \n                 Actually, we take the minimal cost: 2 is minimal -> so new1 = (2,3)\n\n          Then i=3:\n             for color0: \n                 from dp0: (0+0, 2) = (0,2); from dp1: (2+0, 3+1)= (2,4) -> new0 = (0,2)\n             for color1:\n                 from dp0: (0+2, 2+1)= (2,3); from dp1: (2+2, 3)= (4,3) -> new1 = (2,3)\n\n          Then we choose min: dp0=(0,2) and dp1=(2,3) -> total_ops=0, min_segments=2? \n\n        But the example says: the answer for the first test case is 3 operations and 2 segments? \n\n        However, wait: the example input: \n            \"1 2 2 4 5\" -> that was the first example? Actually, the first test case in the problem note is:\n\n            Input: \n                4\n                6\n                110000\n                6\n                100100\n                6\n                101010\n                6\n                000011\n\n            But the example note says: \n                In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following: \n                Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\", ... the number of operations is 3.\n\n            So the first test case in the note is for n=10? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            The first contains a single positive integer t (1<=t<=10000). Then for each test case: \n                n (even, 2<=n<=200000) and a string of length n.\n\n        And the example note: \n            \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\" -> that was for program1, not for program2.\n\n        The example for program2: \n            \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following: \n                Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0', after that s becomes \"1100000000\", ... the number of operations is 3.\"\n\n            The original string? It must be of length 10? \n\n        The input for the first test case in the example of program2 is: \n            n=10, and the string? The example says: \n                Change s3, s6, s7 -> so the original string must have been something else.\n\n        Actually, the example input for the first test case is not provided in the problem statement for program2? \n\n        But the problem statement says: \n            \"In the first test case, one of the ways to make s good is the following: ...\"\n\n        And then: \n            \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\"\n\n        So the first test case must be the one that requires 3 operations.\n\n        How does our algorithm handle a string of length 10? \n          blocks: 5 blocks.\n\n        Example: original string? The example says: after changing s3, s6, s7 to '0', we get \"1100000000\". \n          So the original string must have been: \n            s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7, s8, s9, s10 -> becomes 1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\n          They changed s3, s6, s7 -> so the original s3 was not '0', s6 was not '0', s7 was not '0'. \n\n          Let me assume the original string was: \n            s1='1', s2='1', s3='1', s4='?', s5='?', s6='1', s7='1', s8='?', s9='?', s10='?' \n          But they changed s3, s6, s7 to '0'. So the original s3 was not '0' (so '1'), s6 was not '0' (so '1'), s7 was not '0' (so '1').\n\n          And they left s4, s5, s8, s9, s10? They became 0. So maybe the original had some ones? \n\n          Actually, the example says: \"1100000000\", so the original string must have been: \n            \"11?1?11???\" -> and we change the 3rd, 6th, 7th to 0 and leave the rest? But then we get 11?0?00??? -> not 1100000000.\n\n          Alternatively, the example says: \n            \"Change s3, s6 and s7 to '0'\", and the result is \"1100000000\". \n\n          So the original string: \n            s1='1', s2='1', s3 (changed to 0) -> originally not 0, so 1? \n            s4: becomes 0 -> so originally might be 0? then we don't need to change? \n            s5: becomes 0 -> originally might be 1? then we change? but we didn't change s5? \n\n          Actually, the example says they changed only s3, s6, s7. So the rest must be already 0? \n\n          So the original string: \n            s1='1', s2='1', s3='1' (changed to 0), s4='0', s5='0', s6='1' (changed to 0), s7='1' (changed to 0), s8='0', s9='0', s10='0'\n\n          So the original string: \"1110011000\"\n\n          Then the example says: \"1100000000\" -> which is 1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\n          Now, let's compute the cost for each block for the original string \"1110011000\" (n=10, 5 blocks):\n\n          block0: \"11\" -> cost0: 1->'1'!='0'? 1, then 1->'1'!='0'? 1 -> cost0=2; cost1=0.\n          block1: \"10\" -> cost0: (1->'1'!='0'? 1) + (0->'0'=='0'? 0) = 1; cost1: (1->'1'=='1'?0) + (0->'0'!='1'?1) = 1.\n          block2: \"01\" -> cost0: (0->0?0) + (1->1? not 0 -> 1) = 1; cost1: (0->0? not 1 -> 1) + (1->1?0) = 1.\n          block3: \"10\" -> same as block1: 1\n          block4: \"00\" -> cost0:0, cost1:2.\n\n          Now, we run the DP:\n\n          i=0: \n             dp0 = (2,1), dp1=(0,1)\n\n          i=1 (block1: cost0=1, cost1=1):\n             for color0: \n                 from dp0: (2+1, 1) = (3,1); from dp1: (0+1, 1+1) = (1,2) -> min: 1<3 -> new0 = (1,2)\n             for color1:\n                 from dp0: (2+1, 1+1)= (3,2); from dp1: (0+1, 1) = (1,1) -> new1 = (1,1)\n\n          i=2 (block2: cost0=1, cost1=1):\n             for color0:\n                 from dp0: (1+1, 2) = (2,2); from dp1: (1+1, 1+1)= (2,2) -> so new0 = (2,2) [because same cost, then min segments? but both are 2] -> (2,2)\n             for color1:\n                 from dp0: (1+1, 2+1)= (2,3); from dp1: (1+1, 1) = (2,1) -> new1 = (2,1) [because same cost, then min segments=1]\n\n          i=3 (block3: cost0=1, cost1=1):\n             for color0:\n                 from dp0: (2+1, 2) = (3,2); from dp1: (2+1, 1+1)= (3,2) -> new0 = (3,2)\n             for color1:\n                 from dp0: (2+1, 2+1)= (3,3); from dp1: (2+1, 1) = (3,1) -> new1 = (3,1)\n\n          i=4 (block4: cost0=0, cost1=2):\n             for color0:\n                 from dp0: (3+0, 2) = (3,2); from dp1: (3+0, 1+1)= (3,2) -> new0 = (3,2) [because same cost, then min segments? both 2 -> (3,2)]\n             for color1:\n                 from dp0: (3+2, 2+1)= (5,3); from dp1: (3+2, 1) = (5,1) -> new1 = (5,1)\n\n          Then we choose min total_ops: min(3,5)=3, and then min_segments: for total_ops=3 we have two states: (3,2) and (3,2) for color0? Actually, we have only color0: (3,2). So we output 3 and 2.\n\n          This matches the example: 3 operations and 2 segments.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm is:\n\n          t = int(input().strip())\n          for each test case:\n              n = int(input().strip())\n              s = input().strip()\n              blocks = n // 2\n              # Precompute cost0 and cost1 for each block i: \n              cost0 = []\n              cost1 = []\n              for i in range(blocks):\n                  a = s[2*i]\n                  b = s[2*i+1]\n                  c0 = (1 if a != '0' else 0) + (1 if b != '0' else 0)\n                  c1 = (1 if a != '1' else 0) + (1 if b != '1' else 0)\n                  cost0.append(c0)\n                  cost1.append(c1)\n\n              # If there are no blocks?

and then segments=2? \n            But the example says: no operation is required -> so the original string is good? \n\n            However, the original string \"000011\" is split into: \"0000\" and \"11\", which are two segments of even length -> so it is good. \n            How many operations? 0.\n\n            But our algorithm: we have a solution with 0 operations? yes: we assign:\n                block0: color0 -> cost0=0 -> \"00\" -> good.\n                block1: color0 -> cost0=0 -> \"00\" -> good.\n                block2: color1 -> cost1=0 -> \"11\" -> good.\n\n            Then the total cost is 0, and the segments: \n                block0=0, block1=0 -> same, so no break? then block2=1 -> break at block1 and block2? \n                So the entire string: \n                    block0 and block1: same color (0) -> merged? so one segment for the first four zeros? then block2: one segment for the last two ones? \n                So total segments = 2.\n\n            Therefore, we output: 0 2.\n\n            But the example says: \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially, so no operation is required.\" -> but it doesn't specify the number of segments? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"print the minimum number of operations and the minimum number of subsegments among all solutions with the minimum number of operations\".\n\n            For the string \"000011\", we can also assign:\n                block0: color0 -> cost0=0\n                block1: color0 -> cost0=0\n                block2: color0 -> cost0=2 -> then we have one segment? but then the entire string is one segment? \n                    But the entire string: \"000011\" -> if we assign block2 as \"00\", then we get \"000000\", which is one segment? \n                    But wait: we cannot change the string arbitrarily? we are forced to assign the block to a uniform block? \n                    But if we assign block2 to \"00\", then the entire string becomes \"000000\", which is one segment? \n                    However, the cost for block2 to be 0 is 2 (because we change both '1' to '0').\n\n            But we have a solution with 0 operations that gives 2 segments. And we have a solution with 2 operations that gives 1 segment. \n            However, the problem: we are to minimize the number of operations first. So 0 operations is better than 2. Therefore, we only consider the solutions with 0 operations. And among those, the minimal number of segments is 2? \n\n            But wait: is there a solution with 0 operations and 1 segment? \n                The original string: \"000011\" -> if we do not change any character, then the minimal segmentation is: \n                    [0,0,0,0] and [1,1] -> two segments. \n                We cannot merge the two segments because the last two are ones and the first four are zeros.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal number of segments for 0 operations is 2.\n\n            So we output \"0 2\", which is correct.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py is as above.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 200000, so the total blocks is 100000, and we do a loop over blocks, which is acceptable.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total blocks is 100000, and we have t test cases, but the total n is 200000, so the total blocks is 100000. Therefore, we can do a loop over 100000 blocks in total.\n\n        Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n          Example 1: \"1110011000\" -> we got 3,2 -> correct.\n\n          Example 2: \"000011\" -> 0,2 -> correct.\n\n          Example 3: the problem says the second, third, fourth test cases are good initially.\n\n          Example: \"110000\" (from the input example) -> \n            blocks: \n                block0: \"11\" -> cost0=2, cost1=0\n                block1: \"00\" -> cost0=0, cost1=2\n                block2: \"00\" -> cost0=0, cost1=2\n\n            Then:\n                i0: dp0=(2,1), dp1=(0,1)\n                i1: \n                    color0: (2+0,1) = (2,1); (0+0,1+1)= (0,2) -> new0=(0,2)\n                    color1: (2+2,1+1)= (4,2); (0+2,1)= (2,1) -> new1=(2,1)\n                i2:\n                    color0: (0+0,2)= (0,2); (2+0,1+1)= (2,2) -> new0=(0,2)\n                    color1: (0+2,2+1)= (2,3); (2+2,1)= (4,1) -> new1=(2,3)\n\n                Then we choose: dp0=(0,2) and dp1=(2,3) -> output 0,2.\n\n            But the example says: \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially\" -> so we output 0 operations? and the minimal segments? \n            The string \"110000\" is good? \n                Segmentation: \"11\" and \"0000\" -> two segments, both even -> good. \n            So we output 0 operations and 2 segments? \n\n            However, the example input had 6: \n                6\n                110000\n                6\n                100100\n                6\n                101010\n                6\n                000011\n\n            We did \"110000\" -> 0,2.\n\n            Now \"100100\": \n                blocks: \n                  block0: \"10\" -> cost0= (1 if '1'!='0'?1) + (0->'0'?0) = 1; cost1= (1->'1'?0) + (0->'0'!='1'?1) = 1.\n                  block1: \"01\" -> cost0= (0->0?0) + (1->1?

\n\n            This is a discrepancy.\n\n            However, the problem statement says: \n                \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially\"\n\n            So we must assume that the example input for the second, third, and fourth test cases are good.\n\n            Therefore, the example input must be:\n\n                4\n                10\n                1110011000\n                6\n                110000\n                6\n                111111\n                6\n                000011\n\n            Then the third test case: \"111111\" -> \n                Segmentation: [111111] -> one segment of length 6 -> even -> good.\n\n            But the example input in the problem says: \n                6\n                110000\n                6\n                100100\n                6\n                101010\n                6\n                000011\n\n            So I think the problem intended to say: the fourth test case is good? but the second and third are not? \n\n            But the problem says: \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially\".\n\n            This is confusing.\n\n            However, the problem statement for the input says: \n                \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1<=a_i<=10^9)\" -> that was for program1.\n\n            For program2, the input is: \n                The first contains a single positive integer t (1<=t<=10000). Then for each test case: \n                    n (even) and a string of length n.\n\n            And the example input: \n                4\n                6\n                110000\n                6\n                100100\n                6\n                101010\n                6\n                000011\n\n            And the problem says: \n                \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially\"\n\n            But \"100100\" and \"101010\" are not good.\n\n            Therefore, I suspect there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n            But note: the problem says: \"the second, third and fourth test cases\" meaning the test cases after the first one? \n\n            How about we run our algorithm on \"100100\" and \"101010\" to see if they are good? \n\n            For \"100100\": \n                We computed: 2 operations and 1 segment? \n                But the problem says: we are to output the minimum number of operations and then the minimum number of segments among the solutions with minimal operations.\n\n            How about we check: \n                \"100100\" -> we can change it to a good string with 0 operations? -> no, because it is not good initially.\n\n            Our algorithm: \n                We computed 2 operations and 1 segment.\n\n            How to achieve 1 segment? \n                We can change the entire string to all zeros? \n                    Then we have \"000000\", which is one segment -> cost: \n                        block0: \"10\" -> change to \"00\": cost1 (if we choose color0: cost0=1) -> but we have two blocks: \n                        block0: change to \"00\": cost0=1 (change the first char to '0')\n                        block1: \"01\" -> change to \"00\": cost0=1 (change the second char to '0')\n                        block2: \"00\" -> cost0=0\n                        total cost=2, and the entire string becomes \"000000\" -> one segment.\n\n            How about 2 operations and 2 segments? \n                We can change: \n                    block0: change to \"11\": cost1=1 (change the second char to '1') -> becomes \"11\"\n                    block1: change to \"11\": cost1= (0->1:1) + (1->1:0) = 1 -> becomes \"11\"\n                    block2: leave as \"00\": cost0=0 -> then the string becomes \"111100\", which is two segments: \"1111\" and \"00\" -> segments=2.\n\n            But the problem: we want the minimum number of segments among the solutions with minimal operations (which is 2). \n                We have two solutions: one with 1 segment and one with 2 segments? \n                So the minimal segments is 1.\n\n            Therefore, we output 2 1.\n\n            Similarly, for \"101010\": \n                blocks: \n                  block0: \"10\" -> cost0=1, cost1=1\n                  block1: \"10\" -> cost0=1, cost1=1\n                  block2: \"10\" -> cost0=1, cost1=1\n\n                Then:\n                  i0: dp0=(1,1), dp1=(1,1)\n                  i1: \n                      color0: (1+1,1)= (2,1); (1+1,1+1)= (2,2) -> new0=(2,1)\n                      color1: (1+1,1+1)= (2,2); (1+1,1)= (2,1) -> new1=(2,1)\n                  i2:\n                      color0: (2+1,1)= (3,1); (2+1,1+1)= (3,2) -> new0=(3,1)\n                      color1: (2+1,1+1)= (3,2); (2+1,1)= (3,1) -> new1=(3,1)\n\n                Then we choose: min cost=3, and then min segments=1.\n\n                How to achieve: change the entire string to \"000000\": \n                    block0: \"10\"->\"00\": cost0=1\n                    block1: \"10\"->\"00\": cost0=1\n                    block2: \"10\"->\"00\": cost0=1 -> total cost=3, and one segment.\n\n            Therefore, the output for the four test cases:\n\n                10: 1110011000 -> 3 2\n                6: 110000 -> 0 2\n                6: 100100 -> 2 1\n                6: 101010 -> 3 1\n                6: 000011 -> 0 2\n\n            But the problem says the second, third, and fourth test cases are good? meaning the second test case (which is the first one after the 10-length) is \"110000\" (good), the third is \"100100\" (not good) -> so the problem statement might have a typo.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"the second, third and fourth test cases\" meaning the test cases with index 1,2,3 (0-indexed) in the input? \n\n            The input: \n                test case0: n=10 -> not good\n                test case1: n=6, s=\"110000\" -> good\n                test case2: n=6, s=\"100100\" -> not good\n                test case3: n=6, s=\"000011\" -> good\n\n            So only two of the last three are good? \n\n            But the problem says \"the second, third and fourth\" are good? \n\n            This is a discrepancy.\n\n            However, the problem note says: \n                \"In the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially\"\n\n            So we must assume that the example input for the second, third, and fourth test cases are good. \n\n            Therefore, the example input must be:\n\n                4\n                10\n                1110011000\n                6\n                110000\n                6\n                000000\n                6\n                000011\n\n            Then the third test case: \"000000\" -> \n                blocks: \n                  block0: \"00\" -> cost0=0, cost1=2\n                  block1: \"00\" -> cost0=0, cost1=2\n                  block2: \"00\" -> cost0=0, cost1=2\n\n                Then we can assign all blocks to color0: \n                    dp0: \n                      i0: (0,1)\n                      i1: (0,1) [from same color]\n                      i2: (0,1)\n                So output: 0,1.\n\n            Then the output for the four test cases:\n\n                3 2\n                0 2\n                0 1\n                0 2\n\n            This matches the problem statement: the second, third, and fourth are good (0 operations) and the minimal segments for the third is 1.\n\n            But the problem example input was: \n                6\n                110000\n                6\n                100100\n                6\n                101010\n                6\n                000011\n\n            So I think the problem intended to have the example input as above, but the problem statement for the note was for a different set.\n\n            Since the problem says: \"the second, third and fourth test cases, s is good initially\", we assume that in the provided example input, the second, third, and fourth test cases are good.\n\n            But our algorithm must work for any input.\n\n            Therefore, we write the code as described.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we must be efficient.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total blocks is 100000, and we do a DP for each test case that runs in O(blocks). Since the total blocks is 100000, the entire algorithm runs in O(100000) which is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n          inp = [*open(0)]\n          t = int(inp[0])\n          index = 1\n          out_lines = []\n          for _ in range(t):\n              n = int(inp[index]); index += 1\n              s = inp[index].strip(); index += 1\n              blocks = n // 2\n              # If n==0, skip? but n>=2\n              cost0 = []\n              cost1 = []\n              # Precompute for each block\n              for i in range(blocks):\n                  a = s[2*i]\n                  b = s[2*i+1]\n                  c0 = (1 if a != '0' else 0) + (1 if b != '0' else 0)\n                  c1 = (1 if a != '1' else 0) + (1 if b != '1' else 0)\n                  cost0.append(c0)\n                  cost1.append(c1)\n\n              if blocks == 0:\n                  # then the string is empty -> 0 operations, 0 segments? but n>=2, so skip?\n                  out_lines.append(\"0 0\")\n                  continue\n\n              # Initialize DP for the first block\n              dp0 = (cost0[0], 1)   # (total_cost, segments)\n              dp1 = (cost1[0], 1)\n\n              # If there is only one block, then we skip the loop\n              for i in range(1, blocks):\n                  # For color0 at block i:\n                  op00 = (dp0[0] + cost0[i], dp0[1])   # same color as previous 0\n                  op10 = (dp1[0] + cost0[i], dp1[1] + 1) # different from previous 1\n\n                  # For color1 at block i:\n                  op01 = (dp0[0] + cost1[i], dp0[1] + 1)\n                  op11 = (dp1[0] + cost1[i], dp1[1])\n\n                  # Choose for color0: min by total_cost, then by segments\n                  if op00[0] < op10[0]:\n                      new0 = op00\n                  elif op00[0] > op10[0]:\n                      new0 = op10\n                  else:\n                      new0 = (op00[0], min(op00[1], op10[1]))\n\n                  if op01[0] < op11[0]:\n                      new1 = op01\n                  elif op01[0] > op11[0]:\n                      new1 = op11\n                  else:\n                      new1 = (op01[0], min(op01[1], op11[1]))\n\n                  dp0, dp1 = new0, new1\n\n              # After processing all blocks\n              if dp0[0] < dp1[0]:\n                  total_ops = dp0[0]\n                  min_seg = dp0[1]\n              elif dp0[0] > dp1[0]:\n                  total_ops = dp1[0]\n                  min_seg = dp1[1]\n              else:\n                  total_ops = dp0[0]\n                  min_seg = min(dp0[1], dp1[1])\n\n              out_lines.append(f\"{total_ops} {min_seg}\")\n\n          # Output each result on a new line\n          print(\"\\n\".join(out_lines))\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but the input might be large, so we use sys.stdin? But the code provided uses open(0). \n\n        But the provided code for program2.py starts with:\n\n          inp = [*open(0)]\n\n        So we can use that.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the provided code for program2.py has:\n\n          for s in inp[2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            res = 0\n            mseg = 1\n            prebit = None\n            for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                    res += 1\n                else:\n                    if prebit is None:\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            print(res, mseg)\n\n        This is a completely different approach! \n\n        Therefore, we must complete the provided code.\n\n        How does the provided code work?\n\n          It iterates over the test cases: \n            for s in inp[2::2]: \n                # This takes every other line starting from index2? \n                # The input: \n                #   first line: t\n                #   then for each test case: \n                #       line1: n\n                #       line2: s\n                #   so the strings s are at indices: 2, 4, 6, ... -> so [2::2] is correct.\n\n          Then for each string s (which is the binary string of length n), it does:\n\n            res = 0   # which seems to count the operations?\n            mseg = 1  # which seems to be the minimal segments? \n            prebit = None\n\n            for i in range(len(s)//2):   # i from 0 to (n//2)-1, for each block\n                if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                    res += 1\n                else:\n                    if prebit is None:\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n                    else:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n            Then print(res, mseg)\n\n        How to interpret?\n\n          The condition: if the two characters in the block are different, then we must change one of them? so we count one operation? \n\n          But note: we can change one character to make the block uniform? and the cost for a mixed block is 1? \n\n          Then, if the block is uniform, then we don't need to change? so no operation.\n\n          Then, what about the segments? \n\n          The variable mseg is initialized to 1, and prebit is set to the bit of the first uniform block? \n\n          Then, for the next uniform block, we compare with prebit? \n\n          If the current uniform block has the same bit as prebit, then we don't break the segment? so we don't increase mseg? \n          If it is different, then we break the segment? so we increase mseg and update prebit.\n\n          But note: what if we have a mixed block? we change it to either 0 or 1 arbitrarily? and we want to minimize the number of segments? \n\n          However, the provided code does not account for the choice in mixed blocks? \n\n          How does the provided code handle mixed blocks? \n            It adds 1 to res, but does not update prebit? \n\n          Then, after a mixed block, the next uniform block will set prebit? \n\n          But what if we have consecutive mixed blocks? \n\n          Actually, the provided code does not update prebit for mixed blocks. \n\n          How to minimize the segments? \n\n          We have freedom: for a mixed block, we can choose to make it either \"00\" or \"11\". \n\n          Therefore, we want to choose the color for each mixed block to minimize the number of segments? \n\n          The provided code does not do that: it only sets prebit for uniform blocks.\n\n          Therefore, we must extend the provided code to account for the choice in mixed blocks? \n\n          However, the provided code has a TODO only in the else part (for uniform blocks). \n\n          How about we do:\n\n            We traverse the blocks. We know that for a uniform block, we have no choice: we must leave it as is? \n            For a mixed block, we have a choice: we can make it 0 or 1 with one operation.\n\n          Then, the minimal number of operations is fixed: for each mixed block, we need one operation. \n\n          But the minimal number of segments? \n\n          We can use a greedy: \n            We want to assign a color to each mixed block so that we minimize the breaks.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let the entire sequence of blocks (each block is either uniform or mixed). \n            For uniform blocks, we know the color. \n            For mixed blocks, we can choose the color arbitrarily.\n\n          Then the number of segments is 1 plus the number of adjacent blocks that have different colors.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            We traverse the blocks and whenever we have a uniform block, we know the color. \n            For mixed blocks, we can choose the color to match the previous block if possible? \n\n          But note: the previous block might be mixed and we haven't chosen? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We let the state be the last color (if known) and then for mixed blocks we choose the color to match the last color to avoid a break.\n\n          However, the provided code does:\n\n            res = 0\n            mseg = 1\n            prebit = None   # the last color of a uniform block? \n\n          But what if the first block is mixed? then we set prebit? no, because the first block is mixed -> we do the if branch (s[2*i]!=s[2*i+1]) -> we add 1 to res, and then we don't set prebit.\n\n          Then the next block: \n            if it is uniform: then we set prebit to that uniform bit? \n            if it is mixed: then we do nothing? \n\n          How to account for the segments? \n\n          We note that the minimal number of segments is the number of contiguous segments of the same color. \n\n          We can do:\n\n            We know that uniform blocks are fixed. For mixed blocks, we can choose the color arbitrarily. \n\n            Therefore, we can merge consecutive mixed blocks arbitrarily? \n\n          Actually, we can break the segments only at boundaries between two blocks that are different. \n\n          How about we do:\n\n            We traverse the blocks and whenever we have a uniform block, we know the color. \n            We also note that a segment of consecutive mixed blocks can be assigned the same color arbitrarily? \n\n          We can use:\n\n            Let the entire sequence be divided into segments of consecutive non-mixed blocks? \n\n          Actually, we can use a state machine:\n\n            We don't care about the exact color of a mixed block? we care about the breaks.\n\n          However, note: the minimal number of segments is 1 (if we can assign all blocks the same color) but we are constrained by the uniform blocks.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            We start with the first block that is uniform: that sets the color. Then, until we meet the next uniform block, we have a run of mixed blocks. We can assign the entire run of mixed blocks to the same color as the previous uniform block? then we avoid breaks. \n\n          But what if the next uniform block has a different color? then we break at the last mixed block? \n\n          Actually, we can assign the last mixed block to the next uniform block's color? \n\n          How about we do:\n\n            We break the entire array into segments separated by uniform blocks. \n\n          Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            We let the entire sequence be a sequence of blocks that are either fixed (uniform) or free (mixed). \n\n            The minimal number of segments is the number of segments of consecutive blocks that are forced to be the same? \n\n          Actually, we can use a greedy that minimizes the breaks:\n\n            We start with no segment. \n            We set the current color to undefined.\n\n            For each block:\n                if the block is uniform: \n                    if current color is undefined: \n                        set current color to the uniform block's color, and we have one segment.\n                    else:\n                        if the uniform block's color is the same as current color, then we don't break.\n                        else, we break: segments++ and update current color to the new uniform block's color.\n\n                if the block is mixed:\n                    we can choose the color arbitrarily. \n                    if current color is undefined: \n                        we can choose either color and set current color to that? but we don't break? \n                    else:\n                        we choose the current color to avoid a break? so we don't break.\n\n            However, what if we have a run of mixed blocks and then a uniform block? \n                Example: \n                    block0: mixed -> we choose color0 -> current color=0\n                    block1: mixed -> we choose color0 -> no break\n                    block2: uniform and color1 -> break: segments++ and current color becomes 1.\n\n            But what if we choose block0 as 0, block1 as 1? then we break at block0 and block1? and then at block1 and block2? \n\n            We want to minimize the segments, so we should avoid breaks in the mixed blocks? \n\n            Therefore, we can assign the entire run of mixed blocks to the same color? and that color can be chosen arbitrarily? \n\n            However, we have two ends: the previous uniform block (if any) and the next uniform block (if any). \n\n            We can assign the entire run to the color of the previous uniform block? then we avoid a break at the beginning of the run. \n            But if the next uniform block is different, then we break at the end of the run? \n\n            Alternatively, we can assign the entire run to the next uniform block? then we avoid a break at the end, but break at the beginning if the previous uniform block is different.\n\n            Or we can assign the entire run to a color that matches both? if the previous and next uniform block are the same, then we can match both? \n\n            But if they are different, then we must break somewhere in the run? \n\n            Actually, we can break the run into two segments: one for the previous uniform block and then a break and then the next uniform block? \n\n            However, we are free to assign each mixed block independently? \n\n            We want to minimize the number of breaks? \n\n            The minimal breaks in a run of mixed blocks between two uniform blocks of different colors is 1? \n\n            Example: \n                uniform0 (color0) -> mixed1 -> mixed2 -> uniform3 (color1)\n                We can assign:\n                    mixed1: color0 -> then break between mixed1 and mixed2? \n                    mixed2: color1 -> then we have breaks: \n                         uniform0 to mixed1: no break? \n                         mixed1 to mixed2: break (because 0 and 1)\n                         mixed2 to uniform3: no break? \n                    total breaks: 1.\n\n                Or we can assign:\n                    mixed1: color1 -> then break between uniform0 and mixed1, and then no break between mixed1 and mixed2? and then no break between mixed2 and uniform3? \n                    total breaks: 1.\n\n            So the minimal breaks in the run is 1.\n\n            But what if the run is long? \n                We can assign the first part to color0 and then at some point switch to color1? then we have one break in the run.\n\n            The minimal breaks is 1, regardless of the length of the run.\n\n            What if the run is at the beginning? \n                Example: \n                    mixed0, mixed1, uniform2 (color0)\n                    We can assign mixed0 and mixed1 to color0 -> then no break at the end? and no break at the beginning? -> segments: 1.\n\n            What if the run is at the end?\n                mixed0, mixed1 at the end, and the previous uniform block is color0.\n                We can assign the entire run to color0 -> no break.\n\n            What if the run is between two uniform blocks of the same color?\n                Then we can assign the entire run to that color -> no break.\n\n            What if the run is between two uniform blocks of different colors?\n                Then we must have one break in the run.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal number of breaks for a run of mixed blocks is:\n                if the run is at the beginning or at the end: 0 breaks? \n                if the run is in the middle: \n                    if the two surrounding uniform blocks are the same: 0 breaks\n                    if different: 1 break\n\n            But note: the entire sequence might be mixed? then we can assign one color to the entire sequence -> segments=1.\n\n            How to count the segments? \n                The minimal segments = 1 + (number of breaks)\n\n            How to count breaks? \n                We break the sequence into segments of non-mixed and mixed? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Let the entire sequence be traversed. We only care about the uniform blocks and the runs of mixed blocks.\n\n                The minimal segments = \n                    (number of segments of consecutive uniform blocks that are separated by mixed blocks? but not exactly)\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                We start with the first block: \n                    if it is mixed, then we don't know the color? but we will assign arbitrarily, so we don't count a segment yet? \n\n                Instead, we can do:\n\n                  segments = 0\n                  current_color = None   # the current color of the last block (if we have assigned one)\n                  last_uniform = None    # the last uniform block's color that we encountered? \n\n                But the provided code uses:\n\n                  res = 0   # operations: one for each mixed block.\n                  mseg = 1  # segments: we start with 1 segment.\n\n                  prebit = None   # the last uniform block's color? \n\n                Then for each block i:\n                  if the block is mixed: \n                      res += 1\n                      # we don't update prebit? \n                  else:\n                      if prebit is None:\n                          prebit = s[2*i]   # because the block is uniform, so both are the same -> we take the first char\n                          # and we don't increase mseg? because we are starting a segment.\n                      else:\n                          if s[2*i] == prebit:\n                              # same as the last uniform block, so we don't break\n                              # do nothing to mseg\n                              pass\n                          else:\n                              # different, so we break\n                              mseg += 1\n                          prebit = s[2*i]   # update the last uniform block's color\n\n                But this does not account for mixed blocks in between? \n\n                Example: \n                  block0: uniform '0' -> prebit='0', mseg=1\n                  block1: mixed -> res=1, prebit remains '0'\n                  block2: uniform '0' -> then we compare: s[2*2] is '0', same as prebit -> mseg remains 1, then update prebit='0'\n                  block3: uniform '1' -> different, so mseg becomes 2, prebit='1'\n\n                This counts the segments: 1.\n\n                But what if the mixed block is assigned to '1'? \n                  Then the sequence: \n                      block0: '0' -> segment1: [0]\n                      block1: we assign to '1' -> then we break: segment2: [1] (but the block is two characters? so segment2: [1,1]? \n                      block2: '0' -> break: segment3: [0,0]\n                      block3: '1' -> break: segment4: [1,1]\n\n                So total segments=4.\n\n                But we can assign block1 to '0'? then:\n                  block0: '0' -> segment1: [0,0] (if block0 is two zeros) and block1: '0' -> then we merge? \n                  then the entire first three blocks: \n                      block0: [0,0], block1: [0,0] (assigned), block2: [0,0] -> so one segment? \n                  then block3: [1,1] -> segment2.\n\n                So segments=2.\n\n                The above code would output mseg=1 for the uniform blocks? but it doesn't account for the mixed block breaking the segment? \n\n            Therefore, the provided code is incomplete.\n\n            How to fix the TODO part? \n\n            We must account for the mixed blocks. \n\n            Insight from known solutions: \n                We know the minimal operations is the number of mixed blocks.\n\n                For the segments: \n                    We can note that the minimal number of segments is the number of contiguous segments of uniform blocks that are separated by mixed blocks? but then we can merge arbitrarily.\n\n                Actually, we can use the following known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces Round #789 (Div. 2) Problem B2):\n\n                    t = int(input().strip())\n                    for _ in range(t):\n                        n = int(input().strip())\n                        s = input().strip()\n                        cnt = 0\n                        segs = 1\n                        last = s[0]\n                        for i in range(1, n):\n                            if s[i] == s[i-1]:\n                                cnt += 1\n                            else:\n                                segs = 1\n                        # This is not the same.\n\n                Another known solution:\n\n                    t = int(input())\n                    for _ in range(t):\n                        n = int(input())\n                        s = input()\n                        ans1 = 0\n                        ans2 = 0\n                        i = 0\n                        while i < n:\n                            j = i\n                            while j < n and s[j] == s[i]:\n                                j += 1\n                            ans1 = max(ans1, j-i)\n                            i = j\n                        # This is for a different problem.\n\n                After checking known submissions for the problem \"Tokitsukaze and Good 01-String (hard version)\", we see:\n\n                  #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n                  using namespace std;\n\n                  int main() {\n                    int t;\n                    cin >> t;\n                    while (t--) {\n                      int n;\n                      string s;\n                      cin >> n >> s;\n                      int cnt = 0;\n                      vector<int> seg;\n                      char lst = '2';\n                      for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {\n                        if (s[i] != s[i + 1]) {\n                          cnt++;\n                        } else {\n                          if (s[i] != lst) {\n                            seg.push_back(s[i]);\n                            lst = s[i];\n                          }\n                        }\n                      }\n                      if (seg.empty()) {\n                        cout << cnt << \" \" << 1 << endl;\n                      } else {\n                        cout << cnt << \" \" << seg.size() << endl;\n                      }\n                    }\n                  }\n\n                This solution: \n                  cnt: counts the number of mixed blocks.\n                  seg: a vector that records the uniform blocks, but only when it changes? \n                  Specifically, for a uniform block, if it is the first uniform block, we add it. \n                  Then, for the next uniform block, we only add if it is different from the last added uniform block.\n\n                  Then the number of segments is the size of seg? \n\n                Example: \"110000\"\n                  blocks: \n                    block0: \"11\" -> uniform, s[0]=='1', lst='2' (initial) -> add '1', lst='1'\n                    block1: \"00\" -> uniform, s[2]=='0' (which is the first char of the block) -> '0' != '1' -> add '0', lst='0'\n                    block2: \"00\" -> uniform, s[4]=='0' -> '0'==lst -> skip.\n                  seg = ['1','0'] -> size=2.\n\n                Then output: cnt=0, seg.size()=2 -> \"0 2\"\n\n                Example: \"1110011000\" (the first example) -> \n                  block0: \"11\" -> uniform, add '1', lst='1'\n                  block1: \"10\" -> mixed, cnt=1, skip.\n                  block2: \"01\" -> mixed, cnt=2, skip.\n                  block3: \"10\" -> mixed, cnt=3, skip.\n                  block4: \"00\" -> uniform, s[8]=='0' -> '0' != '1' -> add '0', lst='0'\n                  seg = ['1','0'] -> size=2.\n                  output: 3 2 -> matches.\n\n                Example: \"000000\" -> \n                  block0: \"00\" -> add '0', lst='0'\n                  block1: \"00\" -> skip (because '0'==lst)\n                  block2: \"00\" -> skip.\n                  seg = ['0'] -> size=1.\n                  output: 0 1.\n\n                Example: \"100100\" -> \n                  block0: \"10\" -> mixed, cnt=1.\n                  block1: \"01\" -> mixed, cnt=2.\n                  block2: \"00\" -> uniform, add '0', lst='0'\n                  seg = ['0'] -> size=1.\n                  output: 2 1.\n\n                Example: \"101010\" -> \n                  block0: \"10\" -> mixed, cnt=1.\n                  block1: \"10\" -> mixed, cnt=2.\n                  block2: \"10\" -> mixed, cnt=3.\n                  seg is empty -> then output: 3 and then if empty we output 1? \n                  In the code: if (seg.empty()) then output \"cnt 1\"\n\n                So output: 3 1.\n\n                This matches our DP solution.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO part in the provided code is to maintain a list (or simply a counter) of the distinct consecutive uniform blocks.\n\n            Specifically, in the else branch (which is for uniform blocks), we do:\n\n              if prebit is None:\n                  prebit = s[2*i]   # the bit of this uniform block\n                  mseg = 1           # but wait, the provided code already has mseg=1 initially.\n              else:\n                  if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                      mseg += 1\n                      prebit = s[2*i]\n\n            But wait, the provided code has mseg=1 initially. \n\n            However, the above does not work for the example \"000000\": \n                block0: uniform, prebit=None -> set prebit='0', and we leave mseg=1.\n                block1: uniform, s[2]='0' -> same as prebit, so do nothing.\n                block2: uniform, same -> do nothing.\n                then mseg=1 -> correct.\n\n            Example \"110000\": \n                block0: uniform, prebit=None -> set prebit='1', mseg=1.\n                block1: uniform, '0' != '1' -> mseg=2, prebit='0'\n                block2: uniform, '0'==prebit -> do nothing.\n                mseg=2 -> correct.\n\n            But what if we have mixed blocks in between? \n                The provided code does not update prebit for mixed blocks. \n                Example: \"1110011000\": \n                    block0: uniform, prebit='1', mseg=1.\n                    block1: mixed -> res becomes 1, prebit remains '1'\n                    block2: mixed -> res becomes 2, prebit remains '1'\n                    block3: mixed -> res becomes 3, prebit remains '1'\n                    block4: uniform: '0' != '1' -> mseg becomes 2, prebit='0'\n                output: 3 2 -> correct.\n\n            But what if we have a uniform block then mixed then uniform with the same color? \n                Example: \"11\", \"10\", \"11\": \n                    block0: uniform, prebit='1', mseg=1.\n                    block1: mixed, res=1, prebit='1'\n                    block2: uniform, '1'==prebit -> do nothing, prebit remains '1'\n                output: 1 1.\n\n            But the minimal segments: \n                We can assign the mixed block to '1', then the entire string is ones -> one segment.\n                So 1 segment is correct.\n\n            What if the two uniform blocks are separated by mixed and are different? \n                Example: \"11\", \"10\", \"00\":\n                    block0: uniform, prebit='1', mseg=1.\n                    block1: mixed, res=1, prebit='1'\n                    block2: uniform, '0' != '1' -> mseg=2, prebit='0'\n                output: 1 2.\n\n            But the minimal segments: \n                We have the first uniform block '11', then we assign the mixed block to either '1' or '0'. \n                If we assign to '1', then we have: \n                    block0: '11', block1: '11', block2: '00' -> segments: [1111] and [00] -> 2 segments.\n                If we assign to '0', then we have:\n                    block0: '11', block1: '00', block2: '00' -> segments: [11] and [0000] -> 2 segments.\n                So minimal segments is 2.\n\n            Therefore, the provided code with the TODO filled as:\n\n                else:\n                    if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                        mseg += 1\n                        prebit = s[2*i]\n                    # else: do nothing\n\n            works.\n\n            But note: what if we have a uniform block then mixed then uniform with the same color, but the mixed block is not changed to that color? \n                The minimal segments might be 1? \n                But we are allowed to choose the mixed block arbitrarily, so we choose to match the surrounding uniform blocks? \n\n            Therefore, the number of segments is increased only when we see a uniform block that is different from the last uniform block.\n\n            And the last uniform block is updated only when we see a uniform block.\n\n            This matches the known solution.\n\n            However, what if the first block is mixed? \n                Example: \"10\", \"00\", \"00\"\n                Then:\n                  block0: mixed -> res=1, prebit=None, mseg=1 (remains 1)\n                  block1: uniform: prebit is None -> set prebit='0', and then mseg=1 (but the provided code has mseg=1 initially, and then in the else branch for the first uniform block, we set prebit and do not change mseg).\n                  block2: uniform: '0'==prebit -> do nothing.\n                output: 1 1.\n\n            How many segments? \n                We can assign block0 to '0', then the entire string is zeros -> one segment.\n\n            What if the first block is mixed and then a uniform block of '1'? \n                block0: mixed, res=1, prebit=None\n                block1: uniform, set prebit='1', mseg=1.\n                output: 1 1.\n\n            But what if we have only mixed blocks? \n                Example: \"10\", \"01\", \"10\" (n=6)\n                Then:\n                  block0: mixed, res=1, prebit=None, mseg=1.\n                  block1: mixed, res=2, prebit=None.\n                  block2: mixed, res=3, prebit=None.\n                then we output: 3 1.\n\n            How many segments? \n                We can assign all to '0' -> one segment.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n              for s in inp[2::2]:\n                  s = s.strip()\n                  res = 0\n                  mseg = 1\n                  prebit = None\n                  for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                      if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                          res += 1\n                      else:\n                          if prebit is None:\n                              prebit = s[2*i]\n                          else:\n                              if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                                  mseg += 1\n                                  prebit = s[2*i]\n                  # But what if there is no uniform block? then prebit remains None, and mseg=1 -> that's correct.\n                  print(res, mseg)\n\n            However, the known solution outputs 1 for the number of segments if there is no uniform block? \n                In the known solution: if the vector seg is empty, then output 1.\n\n            In our code, if there is no uniform block, then we never set prebit, and we never enter the else branch, so mseg remains 1.\n\n            Therefore, it is correct.\n\n        But wait: the known solution does not have mseg=1 initially? \n            In the known solution, they do:\n                if (seg.empty()) \n                    cout << cnt << \" \" << 1 << endl;\n                else\n                    cout << cnt << \" \" << seg.size() << endl;\n\n            In our code, if there is at least one uniform block, then we set prebit and then count the changes in uniform blocks (which is the size of seg in the known solution). \n\n            How do they relate? \n                In the known solution, they only push a uniform block if it is the first or if it is different from the last pushed uniform block.\n\n            In our code, we do:\n                first uniform block: set prebit and do not increase mseg (because we start at mseg=1, which accounts for the first segment).\n                then for the next uniform block: if different, then mseg++ and update prebit.\n\n            Therefore, mseg is exactly the size of the vector 'seg' in the known solution.\n\n            Example: \"110000\": \n                known: seg = ['1','0'] -> size=2.\n                our: mseg=2.\n\n            Example: \"000000\": \n                known: seg = ['0'] -> size=1.\n                our: mseg=1.\n\n            Example: \"1110011000\": \n                known: seg = ['1','0'] -> size=2.\n                our: mseg=2.\n\n            Example: \"100100\": \n                known: seg = ['0'] -> size=1.\n                our: mseg=1.\n\n            Example: \"101010\": \n                known: seg is empty -> then they output 1.\n                our: mseg=1.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n              for s in inp[2::2]:\n                  s = s.strip()\n                  res = 0\n                  mseg = 1\n                  prebit = None\n                  for i in range(len(s) // 2):\n                      if s[2*i] != s[2*i+1]:\n                          res += 1\n                      else:\n                          if prebit is None:\n                              prebit = s[2*i]\n                          else:\n                              if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                                  mseg += 1\n                                  prebit = s[2*i]\n                  print(res, mseg)\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, and this loop is O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so it is acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            if prebit is None:\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n            else:\n                if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                    mseg += 1\n                    prebit = s[2*i]\n\n        However, the provided code already has:\n\n            if prebit is None:\n                prebit = s[2*i]\n\n        So the TODO is only the else part.\n\n        We write:\n\n            else:\n                if s[2*i] != prebit:\n                    mseg += 1\n                    prebit = s[2*i]\n\n        But note: we must update prebit to the current block's bit even if we don't increase mseg? \n            In the else branch, if the current block's bit is the same as prebit, we do nothing? and we don't update prebit? \n            But then if the next uniform block is different, we would compare with the old prebit? \n\n            Example: \n                block0: uniform '0' -> prebit='0'\n                block1: uniform '0' -> then we do nothing? prebit remains '0'\n                block2: uniform '1' -> then we compare: '1' != '0' -> mseg++ and set"
