For example, if we try i=4: then prefix4=30+a, and we look for suffix j such that suffix[j]=30+a. The suffix array for the entire array (n=7? or n=8?): If n=7: then the array is [7,3,20, a, 10,8,1]? but then the last four: [a,10,8,1] -> which is a+19. We set a+19=30+a -> 19=30 -> impossible. Actually, the example says Bob ate [10,8,11,1] -> so the array must have 11? So the array: [7,3,20, a, 10,8,11,1] -> n=8. Then suffix4 = 10+8+11+1 = 30 -> so we have candidate 3+4=7. Now, can we get 8? We need i+j=8. Then we require i from 0 to 8, j=8-i. \n        Condition: prefix[i] = suffix[8-i] and i<=8-(8-i)=i -> always true? But note: the entire array sum = prefix[8] = 7+3+20+a+10+8+11+1 = 60+a. And we require prefix[i] = suffix[8-i] = total_sum - prefix[8-i]? Actually, note: suffix[j] = the sum of the last j candies. But also, the entire array sum = prefix[8] = 60+a. And note: the sum of the last j candies = total_sum - prefix[8-j]? But wait: the prefix[8-j] is the sum of the first 8-j candies. Then the last j candies = total_sum - prefix[8-j]. So we require: prefix[i] = total_sum - prefix[8-j] = total_sum - prefix[8 - (8-i)] = total_sum - prefix[i]? So 2 * prefix[i] = total_sum. Therefore, we require that the total_sum is even and prefix[i] = total_sum/2. In this case: total_sum = 60+a, and we require 2 * prefix[i] = 60+a. But we also require j=8-i, so i+j=8. So we are looking for an index i such that prefix[i] = total_sum/2. For i=3: prefix[3]=30 -> then 30 = (60+a)/2 -> 60 = 60+a -> a=0? but weights are at least 1. For i=4: prefix[4]=30+a -> then 30+a = (60+a)/2 -> 60+2a = 60+a -> a=0 -> not possible. So no candidate for 8. Therefore, the maximum is 7.

But why three arguments? One possibility: modmul(x, y, c) = (x * y + c) % MOD. But then in the first use: modmul(i, fact[i-1]) -> we don't pass c, so c=0. So it would be (i * fact[i-1]) % MOD. In the second use: modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1]) -> ( (i+1) * invfact[i+1] ) % MOD. In comb: it does modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y])) -> which is fact[x] * (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] % MOD) % MOD. So it seems we need:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But wait, the comb function already does two modmul: so it is doing nested modmul. That is safe.",

We see: in the backward loop, i goes from n-1 down to 0.\n\n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i)) When i=0, we call invs(0) -> which does fact[0-1] = fact[-1] -> which is the last element of fact?

But when i=0, invs(0) = modmul(fact[0-1], invfact[0]) -> 0-1 = -1 -> fact[-1] is the last element of the fact array, which is fact[MAX-1]. And invfact[0] is defined. But mathematically, what is invs(i) for i>=1? \n      invs(i) = fact[i-1] * invfact[i] = ( (i-1)! ) * ( 1 / i! ) = 1/i. But for i=0, we are doing fact[-1] which is not defined in mathematics.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given the number of test cases t, and then t test cases. For each test case, we are given n and a list of n integers (the weights of the candies).\n\nThe problem: \nAlice eats from the left (a contiguous segment from the left), Bob from the right (a contiguous segment from the right). They cannot overlap. They want the total weight eaten by Alice to equal that eaten by Bob, and we wish to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nWe note:\n- The candies are fixed in order. Alice takes a prefix (possibly empty) and Bob takes a suffix (possibly empty). The two segments must not overlap (so the prefix and suffix are disjoint).\n\nWe can think of two pointers:\n  Let i be the number of candies Alice has taken (from the left) and j the number of candies Bob has taken (from the right). Initially, i=0 and j=0.\n\nWe wish to maximize (i+j) such that the sum of the first i candies equals the sum of the last j candies.\n\nWe can do:\n  Let left_sum = 0, right_sum = 0.\n  We start with i=0, j=0: then we can try to extend.\n\nBut note: we cannot skip candies. So we have two independent pointers? However, note that the entire set of candies is fixed. We can use two pointers:\n\n  We start with i=0 and j=0 (so no candies taken). Then we can try to increase the left part until the left_sum is at least the right_sum? But we want equality.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n  We let i from 0 to n, and for each i, we compute the prefix sum for the first i candies. Then we try to find the largest j (from 0 to n-i) such that the suffix sum of the last j candies equals the prefix sum. But note: the suffix must not overlap with the prefix. So we require i+j <= n.\n\nBut note: the total n can be up to 200,000 per test case, but the sum of n over test cases is <= 200,000. So we can do:\n\n  Precompute prefix sums: P[i] = w0 + w1 + ... + w_{i-1}\n  Precompute suffix sums: S[j] = w_{n-j} + ... + w_{n-1}\n\nBut then for a fixed i (from 0 to n), we want to know if there exists j (from 0 to n-i) such that P[i] = S[j]. And we want the maximum i+j for which this holds.\n\nBut note: we can also consider that the entire set of candies is fixed and we are taking a prefix and a suffix that do not overlap. So we can use a dictionary to record the suffix sums and then traverse the prefix.\n\nHowever, note: the suffix sum array S is for the entire suffix? Actually, we can precompute the suffix sums for the entire array, but we must note that the suffix of j candies is the last j candies.\n\nBut note: the condition is that the prefix and suffix do not overlap. So the prefix ends at index i-1 and the suffix starts at index n-j. We require i <= n-j, i.e., i+j <= n.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Precompute:\n    prefix[0] = 0\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\n\n    suffix[0] = 0\n    for j in range(1, n+1):\n        suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + w[n-j]\n\n  But note: the suffix array: suffix[j] = sum of the last j candies.\n\n  Then we want for each i from 0 to n (prefix of i candies) and then j from 0 to n-i (suffix of j candies) such that prefix[i] == suffix[j]. We want to maximize i+j.\n\n  However, we cannot iterate over i and j for each test case because n can be 200,000 and the total n over test cases is 200,000, but note that the total n over test cases is bounded by 200,000. However, if we do a double loop, worst-case O(n^2) per test case, and the total n is 200,000, but the worst-case test case could be one test case with n=200,000 -> then O(n^2) is 40e9 which is too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient method.\n\nWe can use a dictionary to store the suffix sums and the maximum j for which that suffix sum occurs? But note: for a fixed suffix sum, we want the maximum j such that suffix[j] = x? Actually, we don't need the maximum j, we need the j that when combined with i (with i+j<=n) gives the maximum i+j. But note: for a fixed prefix sum x at i, we look for the same x in the suffix. And we want the maximum j such that suffix[j] = x and j <= n-i.\n\nBut note: we can precompute for the entire suffix array: for each sum x, we can record the maximum j for which suffix[j] = x? However, note that the suffix sums are increasing? Actually, because weights are positive, the suffix sums are strictly increasing? So for each x, there is at most one j? But wait: what if the same sum appears at different j? Since the weights are positive, the suffix sums are strictly increasing: j1 < j2 implies suffix[j1] < suffix[j2]. So each x appears at most once? \n\nBut wait: what if we have zeros? The weights are at least 1. So the sums are strictly increasing. Therefore, for each x, there is at most one j such that suffix[j] = x.\n\nSo we can precompute a dictionary: suffix_dict = { suffix[j] : j } for j in range(0, n+1). But note: if the same x appears twice? It shouldn't because the sums are increasing. So we can do:\n\n  suffix_dict = {}\n  for j in range(0, n+1):\n      s = suffix[j]\n      # we want the largest j for a given s? but j is increasing and s is increasing, so the first time we see s we record j? Actually, we want the j for which s is achieved. But note: we are iterating j from 0 to n, so if we see the same s again, it would be a larger j? But because the weights are positive, s is increasing. So each s is unique.\n\nBut wait: what if the same s appears twice? It cannot because the weights are at least 1. So we can do:\n\n  suffix_dict = { suffix[j] : j for j in range(0, n+1) }\n\nThen for each i in range(0, n+1):\n   if prefix[i] in suffix_dict:\n        j = suffix_dict[prefix[i]]\n        if i + j <= n:   # but note: we are taking i from the left and j from the right, and we require that the prefix and suffix do not overlap. Since we are taking the entire suffix of j, the last j candies, and the prefix of i, the first i candies, then we require that the prefix does not include any of the last j candies -> so i <= n - j. But note: the total candies is n, so the prefix of i and suffix of j must not overlap -> i <= n - j. This condition is equivalent to i+j<=n.\n\n        Then candidate = i+j.\n\nBut note: we are iterating i from 0 to n, and we want the maximum candidate.\n\nHowever, note: we are iterating i from 0 to n, and for each i we get a candidate. Then we take the maximum candidate.\n\nBut note: the same prefix sum might appear at multiple i? But the prefix sums are increasing (weights positive) so each prefix sum is unique. So we can do:\n\n  best = 0\n  for i in range(0, n+1):\n      s = prefix[i]\n      if s in suffix_dict:\n          j = suffix_dict[s]\n          if i + j <= n:\n              best = max(best, i+j)\n\n  Then output best.\n\nBut wait: what if the entire array is taken? Then i+j = n, and we have to check that the prefix of i and suffix of j do not overlap. Actually, if we take the entire array, then the prefix of n and suffix of 0? But note: suffix of 0 is 0. Then we require prefix[n] = suffix[0] = 0? But prefix[n] is the total sum, which is not zero. So that won't happen. Alternatively, we can have i and j such that i+j = n: then the prefix and suffix are disjoint only if the entire array is taken? Actually, if we take the first i and the last j, and i+j = n, then the entire array is taken. But then the condition is that the prefix sum of i equals the suffix sum of j. But note: the entire array sum is prefix[n] = suffix[n]. And if we take the entire array, then we have two sets: the prefix i and the suffix j, but they overlap? Actually, the suffix j is the last j, and the prefix i is the first i. If i+j = n, then the suffix j starts at index n-j = i. So the prefix ends at index i-1 and the suffix starts at index i. So they are adjacent. They don't overlap. So it's allowed.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\". So they cannot eat the same candy. Therefore, we require that the prefix and suffix are disjoint. And i+j<=n is the condition.\n\nHowever, note: what if we have a candy that is not eaten? That's allowed. The problem does not require that they eat all candies.\n\nBut the above algorithm: we are iterating i from 0 to n, and for each i we check if the prefix sum at i is in the suffix_dict. Then we get j = suffix_dict[prefix[i]], and then if i+j<=n, we update the candidate.\n\nBut note: the suffix_dict is built for the entire array. However, we must note that the suffix j is the last j candies. But when we take a prefix of i and a suffix of j, we require that the prefix does not include any of the last j candies. The condition i+j<=n ensures that.\n\nBut what if the same sum appears in the prefix at i and in the suffix at j, but the j we get from the dictionary is the one that we recorded? Since the suffix sums are increasing, we record the j for which the suffix sum is s. But note: we want the j to be as large as possible? Actually, for a fixed s, there is only one j. So we are good.\n\nHowever, note: the suffix_dict we built uses the entire array. But when we take a prefix of i, we are effectively removing the first i candies? Then the suffix of j is taken from the entire array? Actually, no: the suffix of j is the last j candies of the entire array. So the suffix sum for j is fixed and independent of the prefix. Therefore, we can precompute the suffix array for the entire array.\n\nBut note: the condition i+j<=n is necessary to avoid overlap.\n\nHowever, there is a catch: what if the same sum appears at a smaller j? But because the suffix sums are increasing, the j we get is the unique j for that sum.\n\nBut wait: what if the same sum appears at two different j? It cannot because the suffix sums are strictly increasing (weights are positive). So we are safe.\n\nBut note: what if the prefix sum is very large? Then it might not appear in the suffix. Then we skip.\n\nBut note: the total sum of the entire array is prefix[n] = suffix[n]. So if we take i=0, then prefix[0]=0, and we look for suffix[j]=0 -> j=0, then candidate=0. Similarly, if we take j=0, then we get candidate i=0. So we start at 0.\n\nBut the problem: the example: \n  Example 1: n=3, weights = [1,2,1] -> answer=2.\n      prefix: [0,1,3,4]\n      suffix: [0,1,3,4]\n      We look for:\n        i=0: s=0 -> j=0 -> candidate=0\n        i=1: s=1 -> j=1 -> candidate=1+1=2 -> valid (1<=3? 1+1=2<=3 -> valid) -> best=2.\n        i=2: s=3 -> j=2 -> candidate=2+2=4 -> but 4>3 -> invalid.\n        i=3: s=4 -> j=3 -> candidate=6 -> invalid.\n      So best=2 -> output 2.\n\n  Example 2: n=5, weights = [1,2,1,2,1] -> answer=6? But the example says for n=5 (the fourth test case) the answer is 7? Actually, the example says: \n      \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30. So the answer is 7.\"\n\n  But wait, the example 2 in the problem says: \n      \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n  So the example 2: n=3, weights = [3,2,1,1,2,3] ??? Actually, the example 2 says: \"the second test case\" -> n=3? But the example says: \"the first test case\" n=3? and the second test case: n=5? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \n      \"For the first test case\" -> n=3? and the second test case: n=5? \n\n  But the example 2: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n  So the weights: \n      Let the candies be [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] -> but they say Alice eats the first three: so a1+a2+a3=7, and Bob eats the last three: a3+a4+a5=7? But then the candy a3 is eaten by both? That is not allowed.\n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right\" meaning the last j candies without skipping. So Bob eats the last three: then the candies are a3, a4, a5? But then Alice eats the first three: a1, a2, a3 -> so a3 is eaten by both? \n\n  Correction: the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So they cannot both eat the same candy. Therefore, the two segments must be disjoint.\n\n  How can Alice eat the first three and Bob eat the last three? Then the entire array is 5 candies? Then the first three and the last three would require 6 candies? That's impossible.\n\n  Actually, the example says: \"all the candies have been eaten\" -> so n=6? \n\n  The example says: \"the second test case\" -> the first line of the test case contains n=5? Then the next line has 5 integers? But the example says: \"the answer is 6\". \n\n  Let me re-read: \n      \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\n  So total candies eaten: 6. Therefore, n must be 6? \n\n  But the input specification: the first line of the test case is n, and then a list of n integers.\n\n  The example says: \"the second test case\" -> n=6? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"For the fourth test case\" -> n=5? and the answer is 7? \n\n  So let me clarify the examples:\n\n  Example 1: n=3, weights = [1,2,1] -> answer=2.\n\n  Example 2: n=6, weights = [2,1,4,2,4,1]? \n      Alice: first three: 2+1+4=7\n      Bob: last three: 4+2+1=7? But wait, the last three: [4,2,1] -> 7? \n      And they are disjoint? The first three: indices0,1,2; the last three: indices3,4,5 -> disjoint. So total 6 candies.\n\n  Example 3: n=3, weights = [1,2,3] -> no non-zero partition? So answer=0.\n\n  Example 4: n=5, weights = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]? -> wait, n=5? but 8 numbers? \n\n  Actually, the example says: \n      \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n  So the array must be: [7,3,20, ... , 10,8,11,1]? and the total n=7? \n\n  But the example says: \"the answer is 7\" -> meaning 7 candies? Then n=7? \n\n  The input: the first line of the test case is n=7? \n\n  So the array: [7,3,20, x, y, 10,8,11,1]? but that would be 9? \n\n  Actually, the example says: \n      Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n      Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30\n\n  And the total candies eaten: 3+4=7. So the entire array has at least 7 candies. And the middle part (if any) is not eaten.\n\n  Therefore, the array: [7,3,20, ... , 10,8,11,1] and the ... part is not eaten. The array has 7 candies? Then the array: [7,3,20, a, 10,8,11,1] -> 8? \n\n  Actually, the example says: \"the fourth test case\" -> n=7? \n\n  But the problem says: \"the first line of each test case contains an integer n (1<=n<=200000)\".\n\n  So we don't know the exact array for the fourth test case, but we know the answer is 7.\n\n  How do we compute for the fourth test case?\n\n  We are going to do:\n\n      prefix: \n        p0=0\n        p1=7\n        p2=7+3=10\n        p3=7+3+20=30\n        p4=30+a\n        p5=30+a+10\n        p6=30+a+10+8=48+a\n        p7=48+a+11=59+a\n        p8=59+a+1=60+a   (if n=8)\n\n      But the example says: Alice ate [7,3,20] -> so prefix3=30, and Bob ate [10,8,11,1] -> which is the last 4, so suffix4 = 10+8+11+1=30.\n\n      Then we have i=3, j=4 -> candidate=7. And we require i+j<=n -> 7<=n. So n>=7. \n\n      How do we know that 7 is the maximum? We have to check if there is a larger candidate.\n\n      For example, if we try i=4: then prefix4=30+a, and we look for suffix j such that suffix[j]=30+a. The suffix array for the entire array (n=7? or n=8?):\n\n        If n=7: then the array is [7,3,20, a, 10,8,1]? but then the last four: [a,10,8,1] -> which is a+19. We set a+19=30+a -> 19=30 -> impossible.\n\n      Actually, the example says Bob ate [10,8,11,1] -> so the array must have 11? So the array: [7,3,20, a, 10,8,11,1] -> n=8.\n\n      Then suffix4 = 10+8+11+1 = 30 -> so we have candidate 3+4=7.\n\n      Now, can we get 8? \n        We need i+j=8. Then we require i from 0 to 8, j=8-i. \n        Condition: prefix[i] = suffix[8-i] and i<=8-(8-i)=i -> always true? \n        But note: the entire array sum = prefix[8] = 7+3+20+a+10+8+11+1 = 60+a.\n        And we require prefix[i] = suffix[8-i] = total_sum - prefix[8-i]? \n        Actually, note: suffix[j] = the sum of the last j candies. \n        But also, the entire array sum = prefix[8] = 60+a.\n        And note: the sum of the last j candies = total_sum - prefix[8-j]? \n        But wait: the prefix[8-j] is the sum of the first 8-j candies. Then the last j candies = total_sum - prefix[8-j]. \n\n        So we require: prefix[i] = total_sum - prefix[8-j] = total_sum - prefix[8 - (8-i)] = total_sum - prefix[i]? \n        So 2 * prefix[i] = total_sum.\n\n        Therefore, we require that the total_sum is even and prefix[i] = total_sum/2.\n\n        In this case: total_sum = 60+a, and we require 2 * prefix[i] = 60+a.\n\n        But we also require j=8-i, so i+j=8.\n\n        So we are looking for an index i such that prefix[i] = total_sum/2.\n\n        For i=3: prefix[3]=30 -> then 30 = (60+a)/2 -> 60 = 60+a -> a=0? but weights are at least 1.\n\n        For i=4: prefix[4]=30+a -> then 30+a = (60+a)/2 -> 60+2a = 60+a -> a=0 -> not possible.\n\n        So no candidate for 8.\n\n      Therefore, the maximum is 7.\n\n  So the algorithm:\n\n      For each test case:\n        n = int(input())\n        w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        # Precompute prefix sums: prefix[0]=0, prefix[i] for i in range(1, n+1)\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\n\n        # Precompute suffix sums: suffix[0]=0, suffix[j] for j in range(1, n+1): suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + w[n-j]\n        suffix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + w[n-j]\n\n        # Build a dictionary for suffix: for j in range(0, n+1): suffix_dict[suffix[j]] = j   (since each suffix[j] is unique, we can do this)\n\n        suffix_dict = {}\n        for j in range(0, n+1):\n            s_val = suffix[j]\n            # Since j increases and s_val increases, we can just assign. But note: we want the j for which suffix[j] = s_val. And because uniqueness, we can assign without worrying about duplicates.\n            suffix_dict[s_val] = j\n\n        best = 0\n        # Iterate i from 0 to n:\n        for i in range(0, n+1):\n            s_val = prefix[i]\n            if s_val in suffix_dict:\n                j = suffix_dict[s_val]\n                if i + j <= n:\n                    # Then candidate = i+j\n                    if i+j > best:\n                        best = i+j\n\n        print(best)\n\n  But note: the condition i+j<=n is necessary.\n\n  However, what if the same s_val appears in the prefix at multiple i? It shouldn't because the prefix is increasing. Similarly for suffix.\n\n  But what if the same s_val appears in the prefix at a smaller i and then a larger i? Then the larger i would give a larger candidate? But note: if we have two i1 and i2 (i1 < i2) with the same prefix sum, then we would use the larger i2? But the candidate is i+j. However, the j we get from the dictionary is fixed for that s_val. So we want the largest i for which the condition holds? But note: we are iterating i from 0 to n, and we update best whenever we get a candidate. So if we have two i's with the same prefix sum, the one that comes later will have a larger i and hence a larger candidate? But wait: the j is fixed for the sum. So candidate = i+j. So if i is larger, candidate is larger. But we must check that i+j<=n: if the same j is used, then the candidate for the larger i is larger. However, note: if we use the same j, then for the larger i, we have i+j might exceed n? \n\n  Example: \n      n=3, weights = [1,0,1] -> but weights are at least 1? So zeros are not allowed. So we are safe.\n\n  Therefore, we can do the above.\n\n  But note: the problem says the weights are at least 1. So the prefix and suffix sums are strictly increasing. So each sum is unique.\n\n  However, the total n over test cases is at most 200,000. So we can do one pass per test case. But note: the problem says the sum of n over test cases is <= 200,000. So we can do:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          ... the above ...\n\n  But note: the worst-case n per test case can be 200,000, and the total n over test cases is 200,000, so there is only one test case? \n\n  Actually, the input specification: \"It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c510^5\". So the total n (the sum of the n for each test case) is <= 200,000. Therefore, the number of test cases t can be up to 10,000, but the n per test case might be small.\n\n  However, the worst-case t is 10,000, but the total n is 200,000, so the average n is 20. So we can do the above.\n\n  But note: building the suffix array: we do two loops of length n per test case. The total n over test cases is 200,000, so the total time is O(200,000) which is acceptable.\n\n  Let me test with the examples:\n\n      Example 1: n=3, w=[1,2,1]\n        prefix = [0,1,3,4]\n        suffix = [0,1,3,4]   # because w[2]=1, w[1]=2, w[0]=1 -> suffix[1]=1, suffix[2]=1+2=3, suffix[3]=1+2+1=4.\n        suffix_dict = {0:0, 1:1, 3:2, 4:3}\n        i=0: s_val=0 -> j=0 -> candidate=0 -> best=0.\n        i=1: s_val=1 -> j=1 -> candidate=2 -> best=2.\n        i=2: s_val=3 -> j=2 -> candidate=4 -> but 4>3 -> skip.\n        i=3: skip because 3+3=6>3 -> skip.\n        output 2.\n\n      Example 2: n=3, w=[1,2,3] -> \n        prefix = [0,1,3,6]\n        suffix = [0,3,5,6]   # because w[2]=3, w[1]=2, w[0]=1 -> suffix[1]=3, suffix[2]=3+2=5, suffix[3]=6.\n        suffix_dict = {0:0, 3:1, 5:2, 6:3}\n        i=0: candidate=0\n        i=1: s_val=1 -> not in suffix_dict -> skip.\n        i=2: s_val=3 -> j=1 -> candidate=2+1=3? but 2+1=3<=3 -> candidate=3 -> best=3? \n            But the example says answer=0? \n\n        Why? The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n        But note: we are counting the total number of candies eaten. We have candidate=3: meaning Alice ate the first 2 candies (1 and 2) -> total=3, and Bob ate the last 1 candy (3) -> total=3. But wait, the candy in the middle? The problem says: they eat the same total weight. But the candy in the middle (the third candy? actually the second candy is the last one of the prefix? and the last candy is the third?).\n\n        Actually, the array: [1,2,3]. \n          Alice: first two: [1,2] -> sum=3.\n          Bob: last one: [3] -> sum=3.\n          And they are disjoint? The first two: indices0,1; the last one: index2 -> disjoint. So total candies eaten=3.\n\n        But the example says the answer is 0? \n\n        Let me check the example: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n        But we have a non-zero weight? \n\n        The problem says: \"they want to be fair\" -> same total weight. And we found a way: 3=3.\n\n        Why does the example say 0? \n\n        Reread: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n        But note: the example says: \"the answer is 0\". \n\n        However, our candidate is 3. \n\n        What is the problem? \n\n        The problem says: \"the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\". \n\n        We found 3. \n\n        But the example says 0? \n\n        I see: the example says: \"For the third test case\" -> the weights are [1,2,3]? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\". \n\n        But wait: the example 1: [1,2,1] -> answer=2.\n        example 2: [3,2,1,1,2,3]? -> n=6 -> answer=6? \n        example 3: [1,2,3] -> answer=0? \n\n        Why is [1,2,3] giving 0? \n\n        The problem says: \"they want to be fair\" -> same total weight. We found 3=3. \n\n        But note: the problem also says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> so she must take a contiguous prefix? But she took the first two: that's contiguous. Bob took the last one: contiguous suffix. \n\n        Why is the answer 0? \n\n        I see: the note says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\". \n\n        But 3 is non-zero. \n\n        The problem says: \"they want to be fair\" -> same total weight. \n\n        The example says: \"the answer is 0\". \n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        Let me check the sample test cases from the problem statement:\n\n          Test case 1: n=3, [1,2,1] -> output 2.\n          Test case 2: n=5? -> output 6? \n          Test case 3: output 0? \n          Test case 4: output 7.\n\n        But the problem says: \n          \"For the first test case\" -> 2\n          \"For the second test case\" -> 6\n          \"For the third test case\" -> 0\n          \"For the fourth test case\" -> 7\n\n        And the third test case: \n          Input: \n            t=4\n            test case 1: n=3, [1,2,1]\n            test case 2: n=6, [2,1,4,2,4,1] -> 6\n            test case 3: n=3, [1,2,3] -> 0\n            test case 4: n=7, ... -> 7\n\n        Why is test case 3: [1,2,3] -> 0? \n\n        I see: the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" -> same total weight. But note: the condition for being a centroid is not here. This is a different problem? \n\n        Actually, the problem we are solving is: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\".\n\n        And we found 3 for [1,2,3]. \n\n        But the example says 0.\n\n        After reading the problem again: \n          \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n        The key: \"non-zero weight\". But they are eating non-zero weight: 3 and 3. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might mean that they must eat at least one candy? But 3 is non-zero.\n\n        Another possibility: the problem says \"they want to be fair\" meaning that the total weight must be the same, but also the entire set of candies they eat must be disjoint and contiguous from the two ends? \n\n        But note: the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> so contiguous prefix. Bob: contiguous suffix. \n\n        And we have disjointness by i+j<=n.\n\n        Why then is [1,2,3] giving 0? \n\n        I see: the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ...\". \n\n        But we found a way: Alice takes [1,2] and Bob takes [3]. \n\n        However, note: the problem says: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\". \n\n        Bob eats the last candy: that's contiguous. \n\n        But wait: the problem says \"from the right\", meaning the last j candies without skipping. So [3] is the last candy -> contiguous.\n\n        So why 0? \n\n        I suspect the problem intended that the entire set of candies they eat must be contiguous? But that is not stated. \n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have a constraint that the two segments must not leave a gap? But the problem does not say that.\n\n        After reading the problem statement again: \n          \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n        And then: \"Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\"\n\n        So they can leave candies in the middle. \n\n        Therefore, [1,2,3] should be 3.\n\n        But the example says 0.\n\n        I see: the problem says: \"For the third test case\" -> the input might be different? \n\n        The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n        So the input for the third test case might be [1,2,1]? but that was test case 1.\n\n        Or [1,1,1]? \n\n        Let me try [1,1,1]:\n          prefix: [0,1,2,3]\n          suffix: [0,1,2,3]\n          candidate: \n            i=0:0\n            i=1: j=1 -> candidate=2 -> valid (1+1<=3) -> best=2.\n            i=2: j=2 -> candidate=4 -> invalid.\n          so output 2.\n\n        Or [2,2,2]: same.\n\n        What if [1,3,1]? \n          prefix: [0,1,4,5]\n          suffix: [0,1,4,5]\n          candidate: \n            i=1: j=1 -> candidate=2 -> valid.\n            i=2: j=2 -> candidate=4 -> invalid.\n          output 2.\n\n        What if [1,2,4]? \n          prefix: [0,1,3,7]\n          suffix: [0,4,6,7]\n          candidate:\n            i=0:0\n            i=1:1 -> not in suffix_dict? suffix_dict: {0:0,4:1,6:2,7:3} -> 1 not present -> skip.\n            i=2:3 -> not present -> skip.\n            i=3:7 -> j=3 -> 3+3=6>3 -> skip.\n          candidate=0.\n\n        So the third test case might be [1,2,4]? \n\n        The problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ...\" -> so output 0.\n\n        Therefore, the example test cases:\n\n          Test case 1: n=3, [1,2,1] -> output 2.\n          Test case 2: n=6, [2,1,4,2,4,1] -> output 6.\n          Test case 3: n=3, [1,2,4] -> output 0.\n          Test case 4: n=7, ... -> output 7.\n\n        But the problem says the fourth test case: \n          Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30, total 7 candies.\n\n        So the array: [7,3,20, ... , 10,8,11,1] and the ... part is not eaten. The array must have at least 7 candies. The array: [7,3,20, x, 10,8,11,1] -> 8 candies? Then the ... part is one candy (x) that is not eaten.\n\n        How do we get 7? \n          prefix: \n            p0=0\n            p1=7\n            p2=10\n            p3=30\n            p4=30+x\n            p5=30+x+10=40+x\n            p6=40+x+8=48+x\n            p7=48+x+11=59+x\n            p8=59+x+1=60+x\n\n          suffix:\n            s0=0\n            s1=1\n            s2=1+11=12\n            s3=12+8=20\n            s4=20+10=30\n            s5=30+x\n            s6=30+x+20=50+x\n            s7=50+x+3=53+x\n            s8=53+x+7=60+x\n\n          We look for prefix[i] = suffix[j] and i+j<=8.\n\n          We see:\n            prefix[3]=30, suffix[4]=30 -> candidate=3+4=7 -> valid (3+4=7<=8) -> best=7.\n\n          Also, we see:\n            prefix[5]=40+x, suffix[5]=30+x -> not equal.\n            prefix[4]=30+x, suffix[5]=30+x -> candidate=4+5=9 -> invalid.\n\n          So the best is 7.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm should work.\n\n  But note: the example test case 2: n=6, [2,1,4,2,4,1] -> \n        prefix: [0,2,3,7,9,13,14]\n        suffix: [0,1,5,7,11,12,14]   # because the array: [2,1,4,2,4,1] -> reversed: [1,4,2,4,1,2]? \n          Actually, we build suffix by taking the last j candies: \n            j=1: last1 = [1] -> 1\n            j=2: last2 = [4,1] -> 5\n            j=3: last3 = [2,4,1] -> 7\n            j=4: last4 = [4,2,4,1] -> 11\n            j=5: last5 = [1,4,2,4,1] -> 12\n            j=6: 14\n\n        Now, we look for:\n          i=0: j=0 -> candidate=0.\n          i=1: prefix[1]=2 -> not in suffix_dict? \n          i=2: prefix[2]=3 -> not in suffix_dict?\n          i=3: prefix[3]=7 -> in suffix_dict: j=3 -> candidate=3+3=6 -> valid (3+3=6<=6) -> best=6.\n          i=4: prefix[4]=9 -> not in suffix_dict.\n          i=5: prefix[5]=13 -> not in suffix_dict.\n          i=6: skip because 6+j>=6 -> j=0 -> candidate=6 -> but 6<=6 -> but 6<6? no, 6<=6 -> but then candidate=6, which is not bigger than 6.\n\n        So output 6.\n\n  Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <=200000, so we can do:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          # Precompute prefix and suffix\n          prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\n\n          suffix = [0]*(n+1)\n          for j in range(1, n+1):\n              # suffix[j] = w[n-1] + w[n-2] + ... + w[n-j]\n              suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + w[n-j]\n\n          # Build dictionary for suffix: mapping from the sum to j (the number of candies in the suffix)\n          suffix_dict = {}\n          for j in range(0, n+1):\n              s_val = suffix[j]\n              # Since the suffix sums are strictly increasing, we can simply assign. But note: we want the j for which we have that sum. And we are iterating j from 0 to n, so if the same sum appears again (which it won't) we would overwrite. But we know it's increasing so unique.\n              suffix_dict[s_val] = j\n\n          best = 0\n          for i in range(0, n+1):\n              s_val = prefix[i]\n              if s_val in suffix_dict:\n                  j = suffix_dict[s_val]\n                  if i + j <= n:\n                      if i+j > best:\n                          best = i+j\n\n          print(best)\n\n  But note: what if the same sum appears in the suffix at a j that is less than the one we recorded? But we are iterating j from 0 to n, and we record the last j we see? But the suffix sums are increasing, so the same sum won't appear twice. And we are building the dictionary by iterating j from 0 to n, so the last j we assign for a given sum is the largest j? But we want the j for which the suffix sum is s_val. And because the suffix sums are increasing, the j we get is the unique j for that sum.\n\n  However, note: we are iterating j from 0 to n, so the last assignment for a given s_val would be the largest j? But the suffix sums are increasing, so the same s_val does not appear. So we are safe.\n\n  But wait: what if the same s_val appears twice? It cannot because the weights are positive. So we are safe.\n\n  However, note: the suffix array is built for the entire array. But when we consider a prefix of i, we are not removing any candies? The suffix j is the last j candies of the entire array. The condition i+j<=n ensures that the prefix and suffix do not overlap.\n\n  Therefore, the code is as above.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are doing O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so total operations O(200000) which is acceptable.\n\n  Let me run the provided examples:\n\n      Example 1: n=3, w=[1,2,1] -> best=2 -> output 2.\n      Example 2: n=6, w=[2,1,4,2,4,1] -> best=6 -> output 6.\n      Example 3: n=3, w=[1,2,4] -> best=0 -> output 0.\n      Example 4: n=8, w=[7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1] -> \n          We want to see if we get 7.\n          prefix: \n            p0=0\n            p1=7\n            p2=10\n            p3=30\n            p4=35\n            p5=45\n            p6=53\n            p7=64\n            p8=65\n          suffix: \n            j=0:0\n            j=1:1\n            j=2:1+11=12\n            j=3:12+8=20\n            j=4:20+10=30\n            j=5:30+5=35\n            j=6:35+20=55\n            j=7:55+3=58\n            j=8:58+7=65\n\n          Then:\n            i=0: j=0 -> candidate=0.\n            i=1: 7 -> not in suffix_dict? \n            i=2: 10 -> not in suffix_dict?\n            i=3: 30 -> in suffix_dict: j=4 -> candidate=3+4=7 -> best=7.\n            i=4: 35 -> in suffix_dict: j=5 -> candidate=4+5=9 -> invalid (9>8? no, 9>8 -> 9<=8? false) -> skip.\n            ... \n          So best=7.\n\n  Therefore, we output 7.\n\n  But note: the example says the fourth test case has n=7? But we used n=8. The example says: \"the fourth test case\" -> the input n=7? \n\n  Actually, the example says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". \n\n  So the array: [7,3,20, ... , 10,8,11,1] -> the ... part is one candy? Then n=7? \n\n  But then the array has 7 candies: [7,3,20, x, 10,8,11]? but then Bob eats [10,8,11,1] -> but 1 is not in the array? \n\n  Actually, the array must be: [7,3,20, x, 10,8,11,1] -> 8 candies. \n\n  The problem says: \"the first line of each test case contains an integer n\", so the fourth test case: n=8.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\n\n          suffix = [0]*(n+1)\n          for j in range(1, n+1):\n              suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + w[n-j]\n\n          # Build dictionary for suffix: mapping from sum to j (the number of candies in the suffix)\n          d = {}\n          for j in range(0, n+1):\n              s_val = suffix[j]\n              d[s_val] = j   # we can overwrite because same sum won't appear, and we want the j for the sum.\n\n          best = 0\n          for i in range(0, n+1):\n              s_val = prefix[i]\n              if s_val in d:\n                  j = d[s_val]\n                  if i + j <= n:\n                      if i+j > best:\n                          best = i+j\n\n          print(best)\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are doing O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n  However, note: the worst-case memory: we are storing two arrays of length n+1 and a dictionary of size n+1. The total n over test cases is 200000, so the total memory is about 3*(n+1) per test case? But the total n is the sum of the n for each test case. However, we are iterating over test cases, and the total n is 200000, so the total memory is about 3 * (n1+n2+...+nt) <= 3*200000 = 600000, which is acceptable.\n\n  But note: the problem says the maximum n per test case can be 200000, but the total n over test cases is 200000, so there is only one test case? \n\n  Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\u22c510^5\", so we can do:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      cases = []\n      total_n = 0\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          total_n += n\n          w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          cases.append((n, w))\n\n      # But the constraint says total_n<=200000, so we can process each test case.\n\n  But we don't need to store all test cases: we can process one by one.\n\n  So:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          # ... the above ...\n\n  We'll run the code for the examples.\n\n  But note: the example test case 2: n=6, w=[2,1,4,2,4,1] -> we get 6.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"For the second test case\" -> the answer is 6.\n\n  But the example says: \"the answer is 6\" -> so we output 6.\n\n  Therefore, we output the code as above.\n\n  But note: the problem says the weights are at least 1, so we don't have to worry about zeros.\n\n  Let me run the example test case 3: n=3, w=[1,2,4] -> \n        prefix: [0,1,3,7]\n        suffix: [0,4,6,7]   # because w = [1,2,4] -> reversed: [4,2,1] -> suffix[1]=4, suffix[2]=4+2=6, suffix[3]=7.\n        dictionary: {0:0, 4:1, 6:2, 7:3}\n        i=0: candidate=0\n        i=1: 1 not in dict -> skip.\n        i=2: 3 not in dict -> skip.\n        i=3: 7 in dict -> j=3 -> candidate=3+3=6 -> but 6>3 -> skip.\n        best=0.\n\n  So output 0.\n\n  It matches.\n\n  Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but the worst-case n per test case is 200000, and we are building arrays of size n+1 and a dictionary of size n+1. The memory for one test case is about 3*(n+1) integers. For n=200000, that is 600004 integers, which is about 2.4 MB (if integer is 4 bytes) -> acceptable.\n\n  We are ready.\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=200000. Then we do two loops of 200000 each, and building a dictionary of 200001 entries. The time complexity is O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\n  Let me test with a worst-case: n=200000, all ones.\n\n      Then the prefix: [0,1,2,...,200000]\n      The suffix: [0,1,2,...,200000]\n\n      Then we build a dictionary: keys from 0 to 200000, each mapped to j (which is the same as the key).\n\n      Then we iterate i from 0 to 200000: \n          for each i, we check if i is in the dictionary -> yes, then j = i, and we check i+j<=200000 -> i+i<=200000 -> i<=100000.\n\n          So for i from 0 to 100000, candidate = 2*i -> the maximum candidate is 200000 (when i=100000) -> but 100000+100000=200000<=200000 -> valid.\n\n          Then we output 200000.\n\n      But is that the maximum? \n          Alice eats the first 100000 ones -> sum=100000.\n          Bob eats the last 100000 ones -> sum=100000.\n          And they are disjoint? The first 100000 and the last 100000: \n            The entire array has 200000 candies. The first 100000: indices0..99999, the last 100000: indices100000..199999 -> disjoint.\n\n      So the answer is 200000.\n\n  Therefore, the code is:\n\n      t = int(input().strip())\n      for _ in range(t):\n          n = int(input().strip())\n          w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\n          \n          suffix = [0] * (n+1)\n          for j in range(1, n+1):\n              suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + w[n-j]\n          \n          d = {}\n          for j in range(0, n+1):\n              d[suffix[j]] = j\n          \n          best = 0\n          for i in range(0, n+1):\n              s_val = prefix[i]\n              if s_val in d:\n                  j = d[s_val]\n                  if i + j <= n:\n                      if i+j > best:\n                          best = i+j\n          print(best)\n\n  But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe.\n\n  However, note: the worst-case for the dictionary: we are storing 200001 keys. The dictionary operations are O(1) on average. So the entire test case runs in O(n).\n\n  We output the code.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" for program1.py. However, the problem has two programs: program1.py and program2.py. We are only given program1.py? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n  And then: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n  And the output format: json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n  But we are only given one code snippet: for program1.py? \n\n  The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program1.py, and then we see the code for program1.py? \n\n  But then there is a second code snippet for program2.py? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"Code:\" and then the code for program1.py? \n\n  But then the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but we are only shown program1.py? \n\n  And then the problem says: \"Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\n  So we must complete both program1.py and program2.py? \n\n  But the problem only provided one description? \n\n  Actually, the problem has two parts:\n\n      Part 1: program1.py - which is the candy eating problem we just solved.\n\n      Part 2: program2.py - which is a different problem? \n\n  But the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n  So program1.py outputs something that is piped to program2.py.\n\n  And the overall output should be the answer for the candy problem? \n\n  But the problem says: for program1.py, we are to solve the candy problem. And then program2.py is given? \n\n  Looking at the provided code for program1.py: \n\n      It is not the candy problem! \n\n  The provided code for program1.py is:\n\n      MOD = 998244353\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      def inv(x):\n          return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n      MAX = 10 ** 6\n\n      fact = [1]\n      for i in range(1, MAX):\n          fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n      invfact = [1] * (MAX)\n      invfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\n      for i in range(MAX - 2, -1, -1):\n          invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\n      def comb(x, y):\n          return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n          \n      def invcomb(x, y):\n          return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]))\n\n      n = int(input())\n\n      out = [0] * n\n\n      for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n          base = fact[n - 1]\n          frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n          out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n      rem = 0   \n      for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n          oldrem = rem\n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n          out[i] -= oldrem\n          rem %= MOD\n          out[i] %= MOD\n          \n      print(' '.join(map(str,out)))\n\n  This is a completely different problem! \n\n  The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and then the description of the candy problem. But the code provided is for a combinatorial problem.\n\n  This is confusing.\n\n  I see: the problem has two programs. We are to complete both. The first program (program1.py) is the candy problem, and the second program (program2.py) is the combinatorial problem? \n\n  But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", and then it shows the code for program1.py? \n\n  Actually, the problem says: \"program1.py\" and then the description of the candy problem, and then \"program2.py\" and then the description of the centroid problem? \n\n  But the problem only provided one description? \n\n  Rereading: \n\n      \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n      Then: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n      Then: \"Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\n      Then: \"# program1.py\" and then a description of the candy problem and then code for program1.py that is incomplete.\n\n      Then: \"# program2.py\" and then a description of the centroid problem and then code for program2.py that is incomplete.\n\n  So there are two problems:\n\n      program1.py: the candy eating problem (which we just solved).\n      program2.py: the centroid counting problem.\n\n  And we must complete both.\n\n  The command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n  So program1.py outputs something (presumably the answers for the candy problem) and program2.py reads that output and does something? \n\n  But the centroid problem has its own input: an integer n. \n\n  How do they connect? \n\n  The problem does not say. \n\n  But note: the centroid problem's input is: \"The first line contains an odd integer n\". \n\n  And program1.py outputs the answers for the candy problem for several test cases. \n\n  How can we pipe the output of program1.py to program2.py? \n\n  The centroid problem expects an integer n. \n\n  This is confusing.\n\n  I think there might be a mistake in the problem statement. \n\n  Alternatively, the two programs are independent. The command \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" means that the output of program1.py is fed as input to program2.py. But the centroid problem in program2.py expects an integer n. \n\n  But the output of program1.py is: for each test case, a single integer (the maximum number of candies) on separate lines? \n\n  The candy problem: \n      Input: t test cases.\n      Output: for each test case, a single integer.\n\n  So if t=1, then program1.py outputs one integer. \n\n  Then program2.py reads one integer n. \n\n  But the centroid problem in program2.py expects an odd integer n. \n\n  So if the output of program1.py is a single integer, and that integer is odd, then it could be the n for program2.py.\n\n  But the problem says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n  What does \"runs correctly\" mean? \n\n  The centroid problem outputs: \"Print n integers in a single line\"\n\n  And the overall output should be the answer for the centroid problem? \n\n  But the problem does not specify what the overall goal is.\n\n  Alternatively, the two programs are part of a pipeline that solves a larger problem? \n\n  Given the ambiguity, I think we are to complete each program independently as described.\n\n  For program1.py, we complete the candy problem as described.\n\n  For program2.py, we complete the centroid problem as described.\n\n  And then the pipeline might be for a specific input that is not provided? \n\n  But the problem says: \"runs correctly\", so we assume that the output of program1.py is the input for program2.py.\n\n  How can that be? \n\n  The centroid problem expects an integer n (the number of vertices). \n\n  The candy problem outputs, for t test cases, t integers. \n\n  If t=1 and the test case has an answer that is an odd integer, then that integer becomes the n for program2.py.\n\n  But the centroid problem then expects one line with n integers.\n\n  Then the overall output would be that line.\n\n  But the problem does not specify what the overall output should be.\n\n  Given the complexity, I think we are to complete each program independently according to their own specifications.\n\n  We already completed program1.py for the candy problem.\n\n  Now, for program2.py: the centroid problem.\n\n  The problem: \n      There are n vertices (n is odd). The tree is built with the condition: for each i from 2 to n, the i-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index. This means the tree is a \"recursive tree\": it is built by attaching each new vertex to one of the earlier vertices. In fact, it is a labeled tree but with the given attachment rule.\n\n      We are to count, for each vertex i (from 1 to n), the number of trees (among all possible trees satisfying the condition) for which vertex i is the centroid. Output the answers modulo 998244353.\n\n      A vertex is a centroid if when removed, every remaining connected component has size at most (n-1)/2.\n\n  This is a non-trivial combinatorial problem.\n\n  The provided code for program2.py is:\n\n      MOD = 998244353\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n      def inv(x):\n          return pow(x, MOD - 2, MOD)\n\n      MAX = 10 ** 6\n\n      fact = [1]\n      for i in range(1, MAX):\n          fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n      invfact = [1] * (MAX)\n      invfact[MAX - 1] = inv(fact[MAX - 1])\n      for i in range(MAX - 2, -1, -1):\n          invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\n      def comb(x, y):\n          return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n          \n      def invcomb(x, y):\n          return modmul(invfact[x], modmul(fact[y], fact[x - y]))\n\n      n = int(input())\n\n      out = [0] * n\n\n      for i in range((n + 1) // 2):\n          base = fact[n - 1]\n          frac = modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n - 1, i))\n          out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n      rem = 0   \n      for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n          oldrem = rem\n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n          out[i] -= oldrem\n          rem %= MOD\n          out[i] %= MOD\n          \n      print(' '.join(map(str,out)))\n\n  We are to complete the missing parts.\n\n  The missing parts are:\n\n      In program1.py: we are to complete the candy problem. We have provided the code above.\n\n      In program2.py: we are to complete the centroid problem. The code is provided but has a TODO for modmul.\n\n  But wait, the provided code for program2.py has a function `invs` that is not defined? \n\n  The code has:\n\n      def invs(x):\n          return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\n  But in the provided code, `invs` is not defined. However, in the provided code snippet, there is:\n\n      def invs(x):\n          return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\n  But then in the loop:\n\n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\n  So we have to define `invs`? \n\n  But the provided code already defines it:\n\n      def invs(x):\n          return modmul(fact[x - 1], invfact[x])\n\n  However, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we might have to complete the modmul function and also check if there are other missing parts.\n\n  The centroid problem is complex. But the provided code has a specific structure.\n\n  We see:\n\n      It precomputes factorials and inverse factorials up to MAX=10**6.\n\n      Then it reads n.\n\n      Then it initializes an array `out` of length n.\n\n      Then it iterates i from 0 to (n+1)//2 - 1:\n\n          base = fact[n-1]\n          frac = modmul( comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i) )\n          out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n      Then it does a backward pass with a variable `rem`.\n\n  What is `comb` and `invcomb`?\n\n      comb(x,y) = C(x,y) = fact[x] * invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] mod MOD.\n\n      invcomb(x,y) = invfact[x] * fact[y] * fact[x-y] mod MOD.\n\n  Note: invcomb(x,y) = 1 / comb(x,y) mod MOD.\n\n  Then in the loop:\n\n      frac = C(n//2, i) / C(n-1, i)   [because modmul(comb(n//2, i), invcomb(n-1, i)) = C(n//2, i) * (1 / C(n-1, i))]\n\n      out[i] = fact[n-1] * (C(n//2, i) / C(n-1, i)) \n\n  Then there is a backward pass that does:\n\n      rem = 0\n      for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n          oldrem = rem\n          rem += out[i] * invs(i)   [but note: invs(i) = fact[i-1] * invfact[i] = 1/i! * (i-1)! = 1/i]\n          out[i] -= oldrem\n\n  This part is not clear.\n\n  Given the complexity of the centroid problem, and since the problem asks for the missing code (not the entire program), we must complete the missing parts.\n\n  The only TODO in program2.py is the function `modmul`:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  But what does modmul do? The name suggests modular multiplication. However, it has three arguments: x, y, and c (with a default of 0).\n\n  It is used in:\n\n      fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n      invfact[i] = modmul(i + 1, invfact[i+1])\n\n      comb: modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x - y]))\n\n      invcomb: similarly.\n\n      out[i] = modmul(base, frac)\n\n      rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\n  So it must do multiplication modulo MOD.\n\n  But why three arguments? \n\n  One possibility: modmul(x, y, c) = (x * y + c) % MOD.\n\n  But then in the first use: modmul(i, fact[i-1]) -> we don't pass c, so c=0. So it would be (i * fact[i-1]) % MOD.\n\n  In the second use: modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1]) -> ( (i+1) * invfact[i+1] ) % MOD.\n\n  In comb: it does modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y])) -> which is fact[x] * (invfact[y] * invfact[x-y] % MOD) % MOD.\n\n  So it seems we need:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But wait, the comb function already does two modmul: so it is doing nested modmul. That is safe.\n\n  However, the default for c is 0, so when not provided, it's just (x*y) % MOD.\n\n  But in the backward pass: \n\n      rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\n  This is: rem = (rem + (out[i] * invs(i)) % MOD) % MOD.\n\n  But the function modmul is called with two arguments: out[i] and invs(i), so c=0.\n\n  Therefore, we can define:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But note: the multiplication might be of large integers, and MOD is 998244353. We can do:\n\n      return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  However, to avoid overflow in intermediate multiplication? In Python, integers are big, but we want the result modulo MOD.\n\n  We can do:\n\n      return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  This is safe in Python because the modulo operation will handle large numbers, but we can also do:\n\n      return ( (x * y) % MOD + c) % MOD\n\n  But the problem says the numbers can be large, but the multiplications are within the range of Python integers? The maximum x and y can be up to 10^6! which is about 10^(6*6) = 10^6, which is a number with about 500000 digits? That is too big.\n\n  We must do the modulo at each multiplication.\n\n  Therefore, we should do:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          # We assume x, y, c are integers, and we want (x*y + c) % MOD\n          return ( (x % MOD) * (y % MOD) + c ) % MOD\n\n  But the parameters x and y might already be reduced modulo MOD? In the factorial array, we store factorials mod MOD. So we can do:\n\n      return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  This is safe in C++ but in Python the multiplication might be of two numbers up to MOD-1, so about 1e9, and (1e9 * 1e9) = 1e18, which is within Python's integer range (which is arbitrary precision, but modulo 998244353, and 1e18 mod 998244353 is safe).\n\n  But to be safe and efficient, we can do:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  However, the problem might have large numbers in the factorial array? The factorial array is computed for MAX=10**6, and 10**6! is astronomically large, but we are storing it modulo MOD. So in the fact array, we have numbers in the range [0, MOD-1]. Similarly for invfact.\n\n  Therefore, the multiplication of two such numbers is at most (MOD-1)*(MOD-1) < 1e18, which is within Python's integer range, and then we do % MOD.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  But wait, the function is sometimes called with three arguments? In the backward pass, we only use two. In the comb function, we use two. But in the factorial loop, we use two.\n\n  There is one use that might use three? The function signature has c=0, so we can call with two or three.\n\n  In the provided code, there is no call with three arguments. So we can ignore c? \n\n  But the function is defined with c. And in the backward pass, we do:\n\n      rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\n  which is two arguments.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c=0):\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  This will work for two or three arguments.\n\n  But note: in the factorial loop:\n\n      fact.append(modmul(i, fact[i-1]))\n\n  This is two arguments: i and fact[i-1]. Then it returns (i * fact[i-1]) % MOD.\n\n  In the invfact loop:\n\n      invfact[i] = modmul(i+1, invfact[i+1])\n\n  This is ( (i+1) * invfact[i+1] ) % MOD.\n\n  In comb: \n      return modmul(fact[x], modmul(invfact[y], invfact[x-y]))\n\n  Here, the inner modmul has two arguments: invfact[y] and invfact[x-y]. Then the outer has fact[x] and the result of the inner.\n\n  So it's two levels.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the body of modmul.\n\n  But wait, the provided code for program2.py also has a function `invs` that is defined, but then in the loop it uses `invs(i)`. However, when i=0, then invs(0) would be: fact[-1] -> which is out of bounds.\n\n  We see: in the backward loop, i goes from n-1 down to 0.\n\n          rem += modmul(out[i], invs(i))\n\n  When i=0, we call invs(0) -> which does fact[0-1] = fact[-1] -> which is the last element of fact? But our fact array has indices from 0 to MAX-1.\n\n  And MAX = 10**6, and n (the input) can be up to 200000? But in the backward loop, i goes from n-1 to 0, and n<=200000, so i>=0.\n\n  But when i=0, invs(0) = modmul(fact[0-1], invfact[0]) -> 0-1 = -1 -> fact[-1] is the last element of the fact array, which is fact[MAX-1]. And invfact[0] is defined.\n\n  But mathematically, what is invs(i) for i>=1? \n      invs(i) = fact[i-1] * invfact[i] = ( (i-1)! ) * ( 1 / i! ) = 1/i.\n\n  But for i=0, we are doing fact[-1] which is not defined in mathematics.\n\n  We must be careful. The loop in the centroid problem: the backward loop goes for i in range(n-1, -1, -1). And i can be 0.\n\n  What should invs(0) be? \n\n  In the formula: \n      out[i] = ... for i in [0, (n+1)//2 - 1] -> which is i in [0, floor((n-1)/2)].\n\n  Then in the backward loop, we are adjusting out[i] by subtracting an accumulated remainder.\n\n  But when i=0, we are using invs(0) which is not defined.\n\n  This suggests that the provided code might be incomplete or has an off-by-one.\n\n  However, the problem says: the vertex i from 1 to n. The array `out` is of length n, indexed 0 to n-1, where out[i] corresponds to vertex i+1.\n\n  In the first loop, i goes from 0 to (n+1)//2 - 1. For a vertex i+1, if i+1 > (n+1)//2, then we don't set out[i] in the first loop? \n\n  But the first loop only goes up to (n+1)//2 - 1, which is about n//2.\n\n  Then the backward loop goes from n-1 down to 0.\n\n  The use of invs(i) in the backward loop: i is the index in the array, which is from 0 to n-1.\n\n  But invs(i) is defined as fact[i-1] * invfact[i]. This is only valid for i>=1.\n\n  So when i=0, we have a problem.\n\n  How to handle i=0? \n\n  We might need to avoid i=0 in the backward loop? \n\n  But the loop goes down to 0.\n\n  Alternatively, the formula for the centroid problem might not use i=0. \n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem only asks for the missing code, and the only TODO is the modmul function, we complete that.\n\n  For program1.py, we have the entire code to write.\n\n  For program2.py, we only need to complete the modmul function.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    w = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\\n    suffix = [0] * (n+1)\\n    for j in range(1, n+1):\\n        suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + w[n-j]\\n    d = {}\\n    for j in range(0, n+1):\\n        s_val = suffix[j]\\n        d[s_val] = j\\n    best = 0\\n    for i in range(0, n+1):\\n        s_val = prefix[i]\\n        if s_val in d:\\n            j = d[s_val]\\n            if i + j <= n:\\n                if i+j > best:\\n                    best = i+j\\n    print(best)\",\n        \"program2\": \"return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n      }\n\n  But wait, the program1.py code we provided is for the candy problem, and it is complete.\n\n  For program2.py, we only need to complete the modmul function. The missing part is the body of modmul.\n\n  However, the problem might have other missing parts in program2.py? The provided code for program2.py has a function `invs` that might be used with i=0, which would cause an index out of bounds. But that is not our TODO.\n\n  We only complete the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, for program2.py, we only output the string for the body of modmul.\n\n  But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". In program2.py, the only missing block is the body of modmul.\n\n  So we write for program2.py: \"return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\n  But note: the function is defined with three parameters. We use c.\n\n  Alternatively, we can write:\n\n      return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  This is a single line.\n\n  But the problem might expect the entire function? \n\n  The TODO is inside the function. We only need to replace the TODO with the return statement.\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program2.py is the string: \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\n  But to be safe, we output the exact line that is missing.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and for program2.py, the missing code is the body of the function.\n\n  We output the body.\n\n  But the body is one line.\n\n  Therefore, the json:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    w = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    prefix = [0] * (n+1)\\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\\n    suffix = [0] * (n+1)\\n    for j in range(1, n+1):\\n        suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + w[n-j]\\n    d = {}\\n    for j in range(0, n+1):\\n        s_val = suffix[j]\\n        d[s_val] = j\\n    best = 0\\n    for i in range(0, n+1):\\n        s_val = prefix[i]\\n        if s_val in d:\\n            j = d[s_val]\\n            if i + j <= n:\\n                if i+j > best:\\n                    best = i+j\\n    print(best)\",\n        \"program2\": \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n      }\n\n  But the indentation: in the provided program2.py, the function modmul is indented. We should return the body with the same indentation.\n\n  The TODO is at an indentation level of 4 spaces. We return a line with 4 more spaces? \n\n  The provided code:\n\n      def modmul(x, y, c = 0):\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO line with:\n\n          return (x * y + c) % MOD\n\n  So the completion string is: \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\n  But note: the line might be exactly as above.\n\n  Alternatively, to be safe, we output the exact code that would replace the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: the entire code for the candy problem (as a string with newlines as \\n)\n      program2: \"    return (x * y + c) % MOD\"\n\n  But wait, the program1.py we are given in the problem is the combinatorial code? \n\n  This is very confusing.\n\n  Let me recap the problem statement:\n\n      You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\n\n      Then it says: \n        \"# program1.py\"\n        Description: the candy problem.\n        Then code for program1.py that is for the centroid problem? \n\n      Then it says:\n        \"# program2.py\"\n        Description: the centroid problem.\n        Then code for program2.py that is for the centroid problem? \n\n  This seems swapped.\n\n  Actually, the problem says:\n\n      \"# program1.py\"\n      Description: the candy problem.\n      Then code that starts with: \n          MOD = 998244353\n          ... which is for the centroid problem.\n\n      \"# program2.py\"\n      Description: the centroid problem.\n      Then code that is the same as above? \n\n  This is not making sense.\n\n  I think there is a mix-up in the problem statement.\n\n  But the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program1.py, and the description is the candy problem.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, we should write the candy problem code.\n\n  For program2.py, we should write the centroid problem code, but only the missing part (the body of modmul).\n\n  So we do as above.\n\n  However, the provided code for program1.py (under the header \"# program1.py\") is the centroid problem code. This is likely a mistake. We are to replace it with the candy problem code.\n\n  Therefore, the completion for program1.py is the entire candy problem code.\n\n  And for program2.py, we only complete the modmul function.\n\n  We output the json.\n\n  Note: the candy problem code we provided does not have any function definitions, so it is a simple script.\n\n  But the centroid problem code in program2.py has many functions and arrays. We only complete the modmul function.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer."
