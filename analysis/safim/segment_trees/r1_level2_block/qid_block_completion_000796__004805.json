    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\n The provided code uses a deque and a while loop that pops from the right when a>=b, and we need to complete the else part (when a < b).\n\n However, note that the provided code has a flaw: it always pops from the right when a>=b, and we need to pop from the left when a < b? But the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right.\n\n Actually, the code is structured such that:\n   - We have a deque `l` representing the candies (left to right).\n   - We have two variables `a` (for Alice) and `b` (for Bob) initially 0.\n   - We have `cur` to count the total number of candies eaten so far, and `ans` to record the maximum total candies when a==b.\n\n The current code does:\n   if a>=b:\n        b += l.pop()   -> Bob eats from the right\n   else:\n        ... TODO ...\n\n But note: when a < b, we should let Alice eat from the left? Because Alice is the one who eats from the left and Bob from the right.\n\n However, the initial code does not have a variable for the left side? Actually, the variable `a` is for Alice and `b` for Bob.\n\n So in the else part, we should take from the left. Since the deque `l` is from left to right, we can use `l.popleft()`.\n\n Also note: the condition `if a==b` then we update `ans = cur` (the current total candies eaten). But note that we are updating `ans` every time we have equality? However, we want the maximum total candies? But note that we are traversing until the deque is empty. And we update `ans` whenever we have equality. However, it is possible that we have multiple equalities? And we want the last one? But note: the problem asks for the maximum total candies.\n\n However, the example: \n   For the fourth test case: weights [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] \n   Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, Bob: [10,8,11,1] -> 30 -> total candies = 7.\n\n But note: the example says the answer is 7.\n\n How does the algorithm work?\n   We start with a deque: [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]\n   Initially: a=0, b=0 -> a>=b? (0>=0 -> true) -> then Bob eats from the right: b=1, cur=1 -> then a=0, b=1 -> now a<b -> else: we should let Alice eat from the left.\n\n   So in the else part, we do: a += l.popleft()\n\n   Then we continue until we have a==b and update ans.\n\n However, note: the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. And we are removing from the deque.\n\n But the problem: what if we have a situation where we have multiple possibilities? The algorithm is greedy: we always add to the smaller side.\n\n Why greedy? Because we want to balance the two sides as we go. And we are counting the total candies. We update the answer whenever we have a balance.\n\n However, note: the example test case 4: \n   We want to achieve 30 on both sides. How does the greedy work?\n\n   Steps:\n     a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> Bob eats 1: b=1, cur=1 -> then a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> Alice eats 7: a=7, cur=2 -> then a=7, b=1 -> a>=b -> Bob eats 11: b=12, cur=3 -> then a=7, b=12 -> a<b -> Alice eats 3: a=10, cur=4 -> then a=10, b=12 -> a<b -> Alice eats 20: a=30, cur=5 -> then a=30, b=12 -> a>=b -> Bob eats 8: b=20, cur=6 -> then a=30, b=20 -> a>=b -> Bob eats 10: b=30, cur=7 -> now a==b -> update ans=7.\n\n   Then we have two candies left: [5] -> but we continue? \n        Then a=30, b=30 -> a>=b -> Bob eats 5: b=35, cur=8 -> then a=30, b=35 -> a<b -> but the deque is empty? Actually, we break when the deque is empty.\n\n   So we break and print ans=7.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But what about the second test case: [2,1,4,2,4,1] -> n=6, and the answer is 6.\n\n   Steps for [2,1,4,2,4,1]:\n     a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> Bob eats 1: b=1, cur=1 -> a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> Alice eats 2: a=2, cur=2 -> a=2, b=1 -> a>=b -> Bob eats 4: b=5, cur=3 -> a=2, b=5 -> a<b -> Alice eats 1: a=3, cur=4 -> a=3, b=5 -> a<b -> Alice eats 4: a=7, cur=5 -> a=7, b=5 -> a>=b -> Bob eats 2: b=7, cur=6 -> a==b -> update ans=6.\n\n   Then we have no more candies -> print 6.\n\n   So the algorithm is: \n        while l is not empty:\n            cur += 1   (because we are going to eat one candy)\n            if a >= b:\n                pop from the right and add to b\n            else:\n                pop from the left and add to a\n            if a == b:\n                ans = cur   (because we want the last time they were equal? but note: we want the maximum total candies, and we are going to continue until the deque is empty. However, we update ans every time we have equality. So the last equality might not be the maximum? Actually, we are counting the total candies eaten so far. And we want the maximum total. So we update whenever we have equality and then continue? Because we might have a larger total later? But note: we are removing candies and the totals are increasing. However, once we have passed the middle, we might break the balance and then never get it again? But the example test case 4: we got 7 at the end. And the example test case 2: we got 6 at the end.\n\n   However, consider: [1,2,3,3,2,1] \n        We want to get 6? \n        Steps:\n          a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> Bob:1 -> b=1, cur=1 -> a=0, b=1 -> a<b -> Alice:1 -> a=1, cur=2 -> a==b -> ans=2.\n          Then: a=1, b=1 -> a>=b -> Bob:2 -> b=3, cur=3 -> a=1, b=3 -> a<b -> Alice:2 -> a=3, cur=4 -> a==b -> ans=4.\n          Then: a=3, b=3 -> a>=b -> Bob:3 -> b=6, cur=5 -> a=3, b=6 -> a<b -> Alice:3 -> a=6, cur=6 -> a==b -> ans=6.\n\n        So we update ans to 6 at the end.\n\n   Therefore, we update every time we have equality and the last update (if any) will be the maximum total? Actually, the total candies eaten is increasing. So the last time we have equality is the maximum total? Because we are going to eat until the deque is empty. And we update `ans` to the current total whenever we have equality. So at the end, we print `ans` which is the last time we had equality? But what if we never have equality? Then `ans` remains 0? That matches the third test case.\n\n   However, what if we have a test case where we have an equality at the beginning and then never again? Then we would have the first equality as the answer? But note: we are updating `ans` to the current total, and then we continue. And we might get a larger total later? So we are not breaking the loop. We are just updating. So we are capturing the last and largest total? Actually, the total number of candies eaten is increasing, and we are updating `ans` to the current total whenever we have equality. So the last time we have equality is the maximum total.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program1.py is:\n\n        else:\n            a += l.popleft()\n\n   But note: we must be cautious because the deque might be empty after popping? Actually, the while condition checks that the deque is not empty. But we are popping one element per iteration. And we break when the deque becomes empty.\n\n   However, what if we try to pop from an empty deque? The while condition prevents that.\n\n   So the missing code for program1.py is: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\n   But wait: the problem says the total sum of n over test cases is <= 200000, so we are safe.\n\nFor program2.py:\n The problem is about checking if a string is perfectly balanced: meaning for every substring t and every two characters u, v in the entire string, the absolute difference between the frequency of u and v in t is at most 1.\n\n However, note the note: the example \"aba\" and \"abc\" are balanced, but \"abb\" is not.\n\n The provided code:\n\n        for _ in range(int(input())):\n            n = input()   # actually, n is the string? The problem says: each test case is a string.\n            s = len(set(n))   # s is the number of distinct characters in the string.\n\n            for i in range(len(n) - s):\n                if n[i] != n[i+s]:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n What is the idea? \n\n The note: the total length of all strings over test cases is <= 200000.\n\n The example: \n   \"aba\": distinct count = 2 -> s=2.\n   Then we loop for i in range(len(n)-2): \n        i=0: n[0]='a', n[0+2]=n[2]='a' -> they are equal -> then we do nothing? and then the else clause of the for loop? Actually, the for loop has an else that runs if we didn't break. But we didn't break because we didn't have a break.\n\n   However, the code as written: \n        for i in ...:\n            if condition: \n                # TODO\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   This else is attached to the for loop: it runs if the loop completes normally (without break).\n\n   But what if we have a condition that breaks? \n\n   The problem: we are to print \"YES\" only if the string is perfectly balanced, else \"NO\".\n\n   The example \"abb\": distinct count=2 -> s=2.\n        n = \"abb\", len(n)=3 -> range(3-2)=range(1) -> i=0: \n            n[0]='a', n[0+2]=n[2]='b' -> they are not equal -> then we must do something? \n\n   The note says: for the substring \"bb\", the condition fails. So we should output \"NO\".\n\n   Therefore, in the TODO part, we probably break and then print \"NO\". But how?\n\n   The code structure:\n\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n            if n[i] != n[i+s]:\n                # TODO: we need to break and print \"NO\" for this test case?\n                # But we cannot break and then have the else of the for loop? We want to break and then skip the else.\n\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   Actually, the else of the for loop runs only if we did not break. So if we break, we skip the else.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n            if n[i] != n[i+s]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n   But wait: what about the example \"abc\": distinct count=3 -> s=3.\n        len(n)=3 -> range(3-3)=range(0) -> no iteration -> then we print \"YES\".\n\n   Example \"aba\": distinct count=2 -> s=2 -> range(1): i=0 -> n[0]=='a', n[2]=='a' -> equal -> no break -> then print \"YES\".\n\n   Example \"abb\": distinct count=2 -> s=2 -> range(1): i=0 -> n[0]=='a', n[2]=='b' -> not equal -> print \"NO\" and break.\n\n   But what about a longer string? \n\n   Consider \"aabc\": distinct count=3 -> s=3 -> range(4-3)=range(1): i=0 -> n[0]=='a', n[3]=='c' -> not equal -> print \"NO\".\n\n   But is \"aabc\" perfectly balanced? \n        The distinct characters: 'a','b','c'. \n        Consider the substring \"aa\": \n            frequency: a:2, b:0, c:0 -> the difference between a and b is 2 -> which is more than 1 -> so it should be \"NO\".\n\n   How about \"abacaba\": distinct count=3 -> s=3 -> we check for i in range(7-3)=range(4):\n        i0: n[0]=='a', n[3]=='c' -> not equal -> \"NO\". \n        But is \"abacaba\" perfectly balanced? \n            Actually, the problem says: for every substring and every two characters. \n            Consider the substring \"aa\" (if it appears) -> then we have two a's and 0 for the others -> the difference between a and b is 2 -> not balanced.\n\n   Therefore, the condition: the string must not have any two same characters that are more than s apart? Actually, the condition we are checking is: for every i from 0 to len(n)-s-1, we require n[i] == n[i+s]. \n\n   Why? \n\n   The idea: \n        In a perfectly balanced string, the only allowed substrings that can have a frequency imbalance are those that are very short? But note the condition must hold for every substring.\n\n        Actually, the known solution for this problem is: \n            Let d = number of distinct characters.\n            Then the string must be of the form: \n                [pattern] where the pattern is the first d characters, and then the entire string is periodic with period d? meaning s[i] = s[i mod d]?\n\n        Why? \n            Consider: if we have a substring of length d+1, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least one character appears twice? But that alone is not enough.\n\n        Actually, the known solution for \"Perfectly Balanced\" (from Codeforces problems) is to check that the string is periodic with period equal to the distinct count? and the distinct characters must be consecutive in the alphabet? But note the examples: \"abc\" is periodic with period 3? and \"aba\" is periodic? \n\n        However, \"aba\": \n            distinct count=2 -> period 2: \n                index0: 'a' -> index0 mod2=0 -> pattern[0]='a'\n                index1: 'b' -> pattern[1]='b'\n                index2: 'a' -> 2 mod2=0 -> pattern[0]='a' -> matches.\n\n        So the condition: for every index i, we require s[i] == s[i mod d]? \n\n        But note: the pattern is the first d characters. Then we require that for every i, s[i] = s[i % d]? \n\n        How do we check? \n            We can check for i in the entire string: \n                for i in range(len(n)):\n                    if n[i] != n[i % d]: then not balanced.\n\n        However, the provided code only checks for i in the range [0, len(n)-d) and compares n[i] with n[i+d]? \n\n        Why compare n[i] and n[i+d]? \n            If the string is periodic with period d, then we have:\n                n[i] = n[i+d] = n[i+2d] = ...\n\n        So the condition: for every i from 0 to len(n)-d-1, we require n[i] == n[i+d]. \n\n        But note: if we have a string of length 5 and d=2: \n            indices: 0,1,2,3,4.\n            We check:\n                i=0: n[0] vs n[2] -> must be equal.\n                i=1: n[1] vs n[3] -> must be equal.\n                i=2: n[2] vs n[4] -> must be equal? but note: n[2] was already set to n[0] and n[4] should equal n[0]? \n            Actually, if we have:\n                n[0]=a, n[1]=b, n[2]=a, n[3]=b, n[4]=a -> then it is periodic? \n                But the distinct set is {'a','b'} -> d=2.\n                Check: \n                    i=0: a==a -> ok.\n                    i=1: b==b -> ok.\n                    i=2: a==a -> ok? but our loop only goes to i in range(5-2)=range(3) -> i=0,1,2 -> so we check i=2: n[2]==a, n[4]==a -> ok.\n\n        So the condition: for every i from 0 to len(n)-d-1, we require n[i] == n[i+d]. \n\n        But note: the example \"aabc\": d=3 -> we check i=0: n[0]=='a', n[3]=='c' -> not equal -> we break and print \"NO\". \n\n        And \"aabc\" is not balanced -> correct.\n\n        However, what about a string that is periodic? \n            Example: \"abcabc\" -> d=3 -> \n                i=0: 'a' vs 'a' (n[3]) -> ok.\n                i=1: 'b' vs 'b' -> ok.\n                i=2: 'c' vs 'c' -> ok.\n                i=3: not checked? because range(6-3)=range(3) -> i=0,1,2.\n\n            Then we print \"YES\".\n\n        But is \"abcabc\" perfectly balanced? \n            Consider the substring \"abca\": \n                frequency: a:2, b:1, c:1 -> \n                difference between a and b: 1 -> ok.\n                difference between a and c: 1 -> ok.\n                difference between b and c: 0 -> ok.\n            How about \"a\" -> only one character: the differences are 0? \n            How about \"aa\" in \"abcabc\"? \n                There is no contiguous substring \"aa\" in \"abcabc\". \n            But note: the substring \"a\" at index0 and the substring \"a\" at index3 are not contiguous? \n            Actually, the substring must be contiguous. \n\n            The substring \"a\" at index0 and index3 are separate. \n\n            How about the substring \"abca\": as above, it's balanced.\n\n        So it seems the condition is sufficient? \n\n        Why is that? \n            The known solution for this problem (from Codeforces) is: \n                if the string has distinct characters d, then the string must be periodic with period d? \n\n            And then we check the periodicity by comparing n[i] and n[i+d] for every i in the valid range.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n            if n[i] != n[i+s]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n\n        And then we have the else clause for the for loop that prints \"YES\".\n\n   But note: what if the distinct count is 1? \n        Then s=1 -> we check for i in range(len(n)-1): \n            We require n[i] == n[i+1] for every i? \n            So the string must be constant? \n\n        Example: \"aaa\" -> \n            distinct count=1 -> s=1 -> \n            for i in range(2): \n                i0: n[0]=='a', n[1]=='a' -> ok.\n                i1: n[1]=='a', n[2]=='a' -> ok.\n            then print \"YES\".\n\n        But is \"aaa\" perfectly balanced? \n            For any substring: \n                The frequency of 'a' is the length of the substring, and for any other character? There are no other characters. \n            But note: the condition is for every triplet (t, u, v) such that u and v are characters present in s. \n            The only character present is 'a'. So we don't consider other characters? \n            Actually, the condition: the difference between the frequencies of u and v in t is not more than 1. \n            But if we take u='a' and v='a', then the difference is 0 -> always <=1. \n            And there are no other pairs. \n\n            So it is balanced.\n\n        However, what about a string with distinct count 1 that is not constant? \n            Actually, if distinct count is 1, then the string must be constant? \n\n        So the condition holds.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n\n   But note: we must break to avoid the else clause of the for loop.\n\n   However, what if we have multiple breaks? We break at the first mismatch.\n\n   So the code for program2.py becomes:\n\n        for _ in range(int(input())):\n            n = input()\n            s = len(set(n))\n            for i in range(len(n) - s):\n                if n[i] != n[i+s]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n   But note: the problem says the total length of strings over test cases is <= 200000. \n        The loop runs at most (len(n)-s) for each test case. And the sum of len(n) is <=200000, so the total iterations is <=200000? \n\n        However, note: the inner loop for one test case: the number of iterations is len(n)-s. And the sum of len(n) over test cases is <=200000, so the total iterations over all test cases is <=200000? \n\n        But note: the distinct count s can be different for each string. The worst-case distinct count is 26 (since lowercase letters). Then the inner loop for one string of length L: we do L-26 iterations. And the total L over test cases is <=200000, so the total iterations is <=200000? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000. So the total length of all strings is <=200000. Therefore, the total iterations (over all test cases) of the inner loop is the sum_{each string} (|s_i| - distinct_i) <= sum_{each string} |s_i| <= 200000.\n\n   So it is efficient.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is: \n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n\n   But note: the code already has the condition and the for loop. We just need to fill the TODO.\n\n   However, the TODO is only the two lines: \n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n\n   But we must be careful: the code is:\n\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n            if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We need to write two lines? But we can write:\n\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n            if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n\n   But the TODO is at the same indentation as the if condition? \n\n   So we write:\n\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n            if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n\n   However, note: the else clause of the for loop is already there.\n\n   So the entire program2.py is:\n\n        for _ in range(int(input())):\n            n = input()\n            s = len(set(n))\n            for i in range(len(n)-s):\n                if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    break\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n   But wait: what if the distinct count is 0? That is, the string is empty? \n        The problem says: |s|>=1.\n\n   So we are safe.\n\n   However, one more example: \n        s = \"a\" -> distinct count=1 -> range(1-1)=range(0) -> no iteration -> then print \"YES\". \n        s = \"ab\" -> distinct count=2 -> range(2-2)=range(0) -> no iteration -> then print \"YES\". \n        But is \"ab\" balanced? \n            substring \"a\": a:1, b:0 -> difference 1 -> ok.\n            substring \"b\": a:0, b:1 -> ok.\n            substring \"ab\": a:1, b:1 -> ok.\n        So it is balanced.\n\n   Therefore, the solution for program2.py is correct.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is the line: \"a += l.popleft()\"\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is two lines: \n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n\nBut note: the TODO in program2.py is at the end of the if condition. We are replacing the TODO with two lines. We must write the two lines with proper indentation? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing block is only the one line (with the same indentation as the comment). The comment is at the same level as the if block.\n\nSimilarly, for program2.py, the missing block is two lines (with the same indentation as the if condition).\n\nBut note: the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with two lines? Actually, we are replacing the entire body of the if statement? \n\nBut the TODO is a comment at the end of the if condition. We can write:\n\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nBut the existing code already has the condition. We are only replacing the TODO with the two lines? \n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines that go inside the if block.\n\nSo for program2.py, the missing code is the two lines: \n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n\nBut we must note the indentation: the next line after the if condition should be indented.\n\nTherefore, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n    \"program2\": \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                break\"\n}\n\nBut note: the existing code in program2.py has a comment at the end of the if condition. We are replacing that entire line? Actually, the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are replacing the TODO line with two lines. But the condition is already there. We are only adding the body of the if.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire if block? But the problem says \"missing lines\", meaning the lines that are missing in the body.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nSo we output:\n\n    program1: the string \"a += l.popleft()\"\n    program2: the string \"print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n                break\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with two lines? Actually, we are replacing the entire line? But the condition is already there. We are only adding the body.\n\nSo we write the two lines that are the body of the if.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" \n\nTherefore, for program2.py, we output the two lines that are the body of the if statement.\n\nBut the existing condition is already there. So we only output the two lines that are missing in the body.\n\nSo the answer for program2.py is:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n\nBut we must preserve the indentation? The problem does not specify the exact indentation level, but we know the if condition is at a certain indentation. The body should be one level deeper.\n\nIn the provided code, the if condition is at an indentation of 8 spaces (inside the for loop which is inside the test case loop). But we don't know the exact indentation? \n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the code that would be inserted.\n\nBut note: the existing code in program2.py has the if condition and then a comment. We are replacing the comment with two lines that are the body. The body should be indented one level more than the if.\n\nIn the provided code, the if condition is at the same level as the for loop? Actually, the for loop is:\n\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n            if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the if is indented one level more than the for. The body of the if should be indented one more level.\n\nSo we output:\n\n        [indentation]print(\"NO\")\n        [indentation]break\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\nIn the provided code for program2.py, the for loop is indented 4 spaces (from the test case loop). The if condition is indented 8 spaces (4 more). Then the body should be 12 spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the missing code so that when inserted, the program runs.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the two lines without specifying the exact indentation? But we must match the existing indentation.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\", meaning the exact lines that are missing, including the correct indentation.\n\nHowever, the problem does not specify the indentation style. But the existing code uses spaces.\n\nWe can assume 4 spaces per level. \n\nIn program2.py, the for loop is:\n\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n\nThis is indented 4 spaces from the test case loop. Then the if condition is indented 4 more (so 8). Then the body should be 12.\n\nSo we write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"    print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n    break\"\n\nBut wait, that would be 4 spaces? But we need 12? \n\nAlternatively, we can count the existing indentation of the if condition? The if condition is already at 8 spaces. The body should be 12. So we add 4 more spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\nTherefore:\n\n        line1: 12 spaces + 'print(\"NO\")'\n        line2: 12 spaces + 'break'\n\nBut the problem says: we are to output the missing code. We are not to output the entire program.\n\nSo we output:\n\n        \"    print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n    break\"\n\nBut that would be 4 spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we can output without worrying about the exact indentation? But the problem says the code must run.\n\nWe know that the existing code has:\n\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n            if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nBut the if condition is already at 8 spaces. The body should be 12. So we write:\n\n        \"        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        break\"\n\nBut note: the entire program2.py has:\n\n    for _ in range(int(input())):\n        n=input()\n        s=len(set(n))\n        for i in range(len(n)-s):\n            if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n        else:print(\"YES\")\n\nWe are replacing the line:\n\n            if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nwith:\n\n            if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                break\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" \n\nSo we are only filling the body of the if? Then we output:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n        break\n\nwith the correct indentation: 4 more spaces than the if condition? \n\nBut the if condition is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for loop). The body should be 12. \n\nSo we output:\n\n        \"        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        break\"\n\nBut wait, the existing if condition line is 8 spaces and then the condition. We are replacing that entire line? Or we are adding two lines after the condition? \n\nActually, the existing line has the condition and then a comment. We want to break that line and then add two lines? \n\nBut the problem says: the TODO is at the end of the if condition. We are to fill the block.\n\nWe can do:\n\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nBut the existing condition is already written. We are only adding the body.\n\nTherefore, the missing part is the two lines of the body. \n\nSo we output the two lines with the correct indentation: 12 spaces each? \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, to be safe, we output the two lines with 8 more spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we can output the two lines without any extra indentation? But that would be wrong.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\nWe are to output the two lines that are the body of the if, and they must be indented one level more than the if condition.\n\nIn the provided code, the if condition is at 8 spaces. So the body should be 12. \n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. However, the example code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo we output:\n\n        \"        print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n        break\"\n\nBut that is 8 spaces? We need 12? \n\nWait: the entire program2.py as provided:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n=input()\n    s=len(set(n))\n    for i in range(len(n)-s):\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n    else:print(\"YES\")\n\nThe for loop is at 4 spaces (one level). The if condition is at 8 spaces (two levels). The body of the if should be at 12 spaces (three levels). \n\nSo we output:\n\n        \"            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n            break\"\n\nBut that is 12 spaces? \n\nAlternatively, we can count the existing indentation: the if condition is at 8 spaces. We want the body to be 12. So we add 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nBut note: the existing line with the if condition is:\n\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:# TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing that line with:\n\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" \n\nSo we are replacing the entire if condition line? Then we would output:\n\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nBut that is three lines? And the problem says the TODO is at the end of the if condition. \n\nAlternatively, we are only to output the two lines that are the body? \n\nI think the problem intends that we only output the body of the if, because the condition is already there. \n\nTherefore, we output the two lines:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n\nwith 12 spaces? \n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, to be safe, we output the two lines with the same indentation as the body of the for loop? \n\nBut the for loop body is the if condition, which is at 8 spaces. The body of the if should be 12.\n\nSo we write:\n\n        \"program2\": \"            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n            break\"\n\nBut note: the total length of the string might be long, but we are only outputting two lines.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without the exact spaces? But the problem requires that the code runs.\n\nWe'll assume 4 spaces per level. The for loop is level 1: 4 spaces. The if is level 2: 8 spaces. The body of the if is level 3: 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the final answer:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"a += l.popleft()\",\n    \"program2\": \"            print(\\\"NO\\\")\\n            break\"\n}\n\nBut wait: in program2.py, the else clause is at the same level as the for loop? \n\n        for i in ...:\n            ...\n        else: \n            print(\"YES\")\n\nThe else is at the same level as the for (4 spaces). \n\nIf we break inside the for loop, we skip the else.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nLet me write the entire program2.py after filling:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n=input()\n    s=len(set(n))\n    for i in range(len(n)-s):\n        if n[i]!=n[i+s]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            break\n    else:print(\"YES\")\n\nThis is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for program1.py:\n\nfrom collections import deque\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    l = deque(map(int, input().split()))\n    a, b = 0, 0\n    ans = 0\n    cur = 0\n    while l:\n        cur+=1\n        if a>=b:\n            b += l.pop()\n        else:\n            a += l.popleft()\n        if a==b:\n            ans = cur\n    print(ans)\n\nThis is correct.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as specified."
