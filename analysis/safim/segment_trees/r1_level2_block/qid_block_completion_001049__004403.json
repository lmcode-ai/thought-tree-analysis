    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are solving the problem of partitioning an array to maximize the sum of values of subarrays. The value of a subarray is (length) if the sum is positive, 0 if zero, and -(length) if negative.\n\nThe approach in the provided code uses dynamic programming and two Fenwick trees (or segment trees) to efficiently compute the maximum dp[i] for positions with a certain prefix sum ordering.\n\nThe code already sets up:\n- Reading input with multiple test cases.\n- Precomputing prefix sums.\n- Sorting the prefix sums for coordinate compression (using two orders: one for positive and one for negative? Actually, two arrays: `spos` and `sneg` for two different orders).\n\nWe see that:\n- `spos` is sorted by (pref[i], -i) -> so that for the same prefix, the larger index comes first? Actually, we are using the negative index to break ties? But note: when we assign `ordpos[-spos[i][-1]] = i`, we are using the negative of the index? Actually, the second element in the tuple for `spos` is `-i` (so that when we sort, for the same prefix, the larger index has a more negative second element, so it comes earlier?).\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 500000, so we can use Fenwick trees.\n\nThe dp recurrence is:\n  dp[i] = max( \n        i + max_{j: j < i and pref[j] < pref[i]} { dp[j] - j },\n        max_{j: j < i and pref[j] > pref[i]} { dp[j] + j } - i,\n        (if there exists j with pref[j] = pref[i] then we can take dp[j] because the segment from j+1 to i has sum 0 -> then the value of that segment is 0, so we can do dp[i] = dp[j] + 0? But note the recurrence: the segment from j+1 to i has sum 0, so we can have the same dp value? Actually, the code does: `dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)`)\n\nBut note the recurrence in the code:\n\n  dp[i] = max( i + pfen.max(ordpos[i]), nfen.max(n+1-ordneg[i]) - i, dmx.get(pref[i], -INF) )\n\nAnd then we update:\n  pfen.modify(ordpos[i], dp[i]-i)\n  nfen.modify(n+1-ordneg[i], dp[i]+i)\n  and update dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i],-INF), dp[i])\n\nHowever, the code has a TODO: after updating the Fenwick trees, we must update the dictionary `dmx` for the current prefix.\n\nSo the missing line in the loop for program1.py is:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut note: the problem says that the entire array must be partitioned. We are computing dp[i] for the prefix ending at i (which corresponds to the entire array up to i). We are interested in dp[n].\n\nSo the missing line in program1.py is:\n\n    if pref[i] in dmx:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx[pref[i]], dp[i])\n    else:\n        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut we can write it more concisely as:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut note: the code already has a line above that uses `dmx.get(pref[i], -INF)`. So we can update with:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = max(dmx.get(pref[i], -INF), dp[i])\n\nBut wait, the code already has:\n\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we are only updating if dp[i] is greater? Then we can simply do:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: it is possible that we have multiple j with the same prefix and we want the maximum dp[j] for that prefix. The condition checks if dp[i] is greater than the current value. So we update the dictionary to the new maximum.\n\nSo the missing line in the TODO is:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the condition is only true when dp[i] is greater, so we set it to dp[i]. However, it is possible that we have multiple indices with the same prefix and we want the maximum. The condition ensures we update only when we have a new maximum.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\nBut note: the condition is written as:\n\n    if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n\nSo we update the dictionary only when we have a new maximum for that prefix.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are solving a tree infection problem. The problem is about infecting a tree in minimal seconds. The operations per second:\n  - Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child is infected, we can infect at most one additional child (if there are multiple, we choose one).\n  - Injection: we can choose any healthy vertex and infect it.\n\nWe are given the parent of each vertex from 2 to n.\n\nThe provided code does:\n  - Count the frequency of each parent (the root is 1, and the input gives p2, p3, ... pn, the parent of vertex i (for i from 2 to n)).\n  - Then, we note that the root is initially not infected? Actually, we start with all healthy. Then we must infect the root by injection? But note: the root has no parent, so spreading from above doesn't apply? However, the root can be infected by injection.\n\nThe approach in the code:\n  - We create a dictionary `things` that counts the number of children for each parent? Actually, the root (0 is not a vertex) so the code uses:\n        things = {0: const}   # what is const? 1<<18, which is 262144, a big number?\n        Then for each parent in the input, we increment the count for that parent.\n\n  - Then we push the counts (as negative for a max-heap) into a heap `laze`.\n\n  - Then we simulate the process by seconds.\n\nThe simulation:\n\n  time = 0\n  while heap not empty:\n      f = -laze[0]   (so f is the current count, which is positive)\n\n      If f <= time: then we pop and continue? Why? Because if the count is less than or equal to the current time, then we don't need to do anything? Actually, we are simulating the infection process.\n\n  The code then has three cases:\n\n      Case 1: if f <= time: pop and continue.\n\n      Case 2: if f >= const: \n          Then we do: f -= const; f += time + 1; then pop.\n          Then if f > time, push -f back.\n\n      Case 3: else (meaning f < const and f>time? because we skipped the first condition) then we do:\n          f -= 1\n          pop\n          if f > time: push -f back.\n\n      Then time += 1.\n\nWhat does const represent? It seems to be a marker. Notice that initially, we set the root (represented by 0) to have `const` (which is 1<<18). Then for each parent, we set the count to `const` initially? Actually, the code:\n\n        if arr[x] in things:\n            things[arr[x]] += 1\n        else:\n            things[arr[x]] = const\n\nBut wait, the root (vertex 1) is not in the input? The input gives the parent of vertices 2 to n. So the root (1) will appear as a parent? How many times? We don't know. But note: the root is not given as a parent in the input? Actually, the root is vertex 1, and the input gives p2, p3, ... pn. The parent of vertex 2 is p2, which might be 1. So we will see 1 in the input.\n\nBut the code initializes `things` with {0: const}. Why 0? Then we process the input: for each parent in the input, we either initialize to const or add 1. This doesn't seem right.\n\nActually, the problem says: the root is vertex 1. The input does not include the root's parent. So we should count the root as having no parent. But the code uses:\n\n        things = {0: const}\n\nand then for each parent in the input (which are the parents of vertices 2..n) we do:\n\n        if parent in things: then things[parent] += 1\n        else: things[parent] = const\n\nBut note: the root (vertex 1) might appear as a parent? Yes. But the root is not represented by 0? The root is 1. So we have:\n\n        things[0] = const   # what is this for?\n\n        Then for each parent p_i (which are integers from 1 to n) we update.\n\nThis seems odd. Also, the condition `if arr[x] in things` will be true for the root (if we see 1) only if we have set things[1]? But we haven't. So we set things[1] = const. Then if we see 1 again, we add 1.\n\nBut note: the root (vertex 1) has no parent, so we don't have an entry for the root in the input as a child? But we are counting the frequency of each parent. The root (1) will appear as the parent of some children. So the count for 1 is the number of children of 1.\n\nBut why 0? The code uses 0 to represent the root? Actually, the root is vertex 1, but the code uses 0 to represent the root? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be counting the root (vertex 1) as having an extra \"parent\" 0? Then the root is represented by 0? But the input does not have 0.\n\nI think the intended meaning is:\n\n  We are going to count the frequency of each node as a parent. The root (vertex 1) has no parent, so we consider it as having a parent 0? Then:\n\n      things[0] = 1   (because the root has one node: itself?) but wait, the root is the only node that has no parent. However, the root is included in the tree? The problem says: the tree has n vertices.\n\nBut note: the input has n-1 integers. The root is vertex 1, and then we have n-1 edges.\n\nThe code does:\n\n      things = {0: const}\n\n      Then for each parent in the list of n-1 integers, we do:\n\n          if parent in things: then things[parent] += 1\n          else: things[parent] = const\n\nThis means:\n\n      The root (vertex 1) is not included in the input? Then we are counting the children of each node. The root (1) will appear in the input as a parent? Yes, if it has children.\n\n      But we also have an entry for 0? Why?\n\nActually, the code then pushes the counts. The root (0) has count = const, and then each parent that appears k times (meaning k children) will have count = const (if it's the first time) or const + (k-1) if it appears multiple times? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be using 0 to represent the root? And then the root is considered to have an initial count of const? Then the other nodes: if they are a parent, then they get const (if first time) and then we add 1 for each additional child? But that would be const + (number of children - 1) for the root? and for a node that is a parent and has k children, we set it to const + (k-1) if it already exists? Actually, the first time we see a parent, we set it to const, then every next time we add 1. So the count for a node that is the parent of k children is: const + (k-1). Why?\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the sample: \n  First test case: n=5, parents = [1,1,2,2] -> meaning:\n        vertex2: parent=1\n        vertex3: parent=1\n        vertex4: parent=2\n        vertex5: parent=2\n\n  Then the counts for parents:\n        parent 1: appears twice -> so things[1] = const + 1? (because first time: set to const, then second time: +=1 -> const+1)\n        parent 2: appears twice -> const+1\n        and we have things[0] = const.\n\n  Then we push: \n        - (const) for 0\n        - (const+1) for 1\n        - (const+1) for 2\n\n  Then we simulate.\n\nBut note: the root (vertex1) is represented by 0? Then the children of the root are represented by 1? Actually, the root (vertex1) is represented by 1? Then why do we have an entry for 0?\n\nI think the code is flawed. The intended solution for the tree infection problem is known:\n\n  We note that initially we must infect the root by injection at time 0? Then the infection spreads.\n\n  Alternatively, we can model:\n\n      Let deg[i] be the number of children of node i. Then the root has deg[1] = (number of children of 1). We also note that we can inject at any time.\n\n  Known solution:\n\n      We can use a greedy strategy:\n\n        Let f(v) be the time when node v becomes infected.\n\n        The root: we can inject at time 0, so f(1)=0? But then we can also spread? Actually, the problem says: at each second, first spreading then injection.\n\n        Alternatively, we can think:\n\n          We start at time 0. At time 0, we can inject one node (say the root) so the root becomes infected at time 0? Then at time 1, we can spread from the root to one child? and then we can inject another node? \n\n        Actually, the minimal time is computed by:\n\n          Let deg[i] be the number of children of i. Then for each node, we can sort the infection times of its children? and then the infection of the children can be scheduled.\n\n        However, note the problem: we can choose which child to spread to at each second.\n\n        Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #782 (Div. 2) problem D) is:\n\n          We start by noting that we must inject the root at time 0? Then the root is infected at time 0.\n\n          Then for each node, we can consider the time when it gets infected.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let a = [0]  # the root is infected at time 0.\n            For each node, we can compute the time when it gets infected by spreading: it must be after all the siblings that were infected earlier? \n\n          Actually, we can use a BFS? \n\n        But note the constraints: the sum of n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n        The known solution:\n\n          Step 1: Count the number of children for each node (including the root). The root has children (the nodes that have parent 1). Then we form an array `cnt` for the number of children for each node.\n\n          Step 2: We create an array `a` for the delays. Initially, we set the root's time to 0. Then for each node, we can consider: when a node gets infected, it can start spreading to its children. But note: we can also inject other nodes arbitrarily.\n\n          Actually, we can use a greedy algorithm:\n\n            We start by having the root infected at time 0.\n\n            Then, we have a list of nodes that are infected and can spread. The spreading operation: for each node that is infected and has at least one uninfected child, we can spread to one child per second. But note: we can also inject at the same second.\n\n          However, the problem allows:\n\n            Each second:\n              Spreading: for each vertex v that has at least one child infected (so at least one child was infected in a previous second) and has at least one uninfected child, we can choose one uninfected child to infect by spreading.\n              Then, we can inject one arbitrary healthy node.\n\n          So the infection of a node can be by spreading or by injection.\n\n          We want to minimize the time.\n\n          Known solution (from known problems like \"Tree Infection\"):\n\n            We can do:\n\n              Let f(v) be the time when node v becomes infected.\n\n              For the root: we inject at time 0 -> f(1)=0.\n\n              Then, for each node u (non-root), we can either inject it or spread it from its parent.\n\n              But note: we can only spread from the parent if the parent is infected and we choose to spread to u.\n\n          However, the problem does not require that we spread from the parent. We can also inject any node arbitrarily.\n\n          The known solution:\n\n            Step 1: Count the children counts for each node. Let deg[i] = number of children of i.\n\n            Step 2: We note that for a node with k children, we can spread to at most one child per second after the node is infected. But we can also inject some children to speed up.\n\n            Actually, we can model:\n\n              For a node v, let t0 be the time when v is infected.\n\n              Then, we have k children. We can inject some of the children at arbitrary times, and then the spreading will take care of the rest. But note: we can only spread one child per second from v.\n\n              How to minimize the time for the entire subtree?\n\n              We can inject one child at time t0+1, then at time t0+2 we can spread to one child (so two children by time t0+2), then at time t0+3 we can spread to another (if we inject one more at time t0+2, then we have two injections and one spread?).\n\n            Actually, we can schedule the infections of the children arbitrarily by injection and spreading. The constraint: at each second, we can only inject one node (globally) and from each infected node that has at least one child infected, we can spread to one additional child.\n\n            This is complex.\n\n          Alternate known solution (from a known code for the same problem):\n\n            We do:\n\n              Let deg[1]++   # for the root? because we count the root as having one more? Actually, the root is infected at time 0, so we can consider that the root was \"injected\" at time 0, and then we have deg[1] children to infect.\n\n              Then, we create an array `a` of the deg[i] for each node i that has at least one child? (so deg[i] > 0). Then we sort this array in descending order.\n\n              Then we do a binary search on the total time T.\n\n              Or we can simulate:\n\n                  Let time = 0.\n                  We have a multiset of the number of uninfected children per node? Initially, for each node i, we have deg[i] uninfected children.\n\n                  Then, at time t:\n\n                      We can inject one node (so we reduce one uninfected child from some node? but note: injecting a child of node i doesn't reduce the uninfected children of node i? Actually, if we inject a child of node i, then that child becomes infected, and then node i can start spreading to its other children? So we reduce the count for node i by one? But also, we have a new infected node (the child) that might have its own children? \n\n                  This is complex.\n\n          Another known solution (from a known submission for the same problem):\n\n            We do:\n\n              cnt = [0]*(n+1)\n              for i in range(2, n+1):\n                  cnt[parent[i]] += 1\n\n              # Then, we consider the root: we must inject the root at time 0? Then the root is infected at time 0.\n\n              # For each node, we have a list of the times when its children become infected? \n\n              # Instead, we can use a greedy:\n\n                  Let events = []   # we will count the time when a node runs out of spreading ability.\n\n                  We start by having the root: it has cnt[1] children. How do we schedule the infection of the children of the root?\n\n                  We can inject some of the children and then use spreading for the rest.\n\n                  For a node with k children, we can inject one child at time 1, then at time 2 we can spread to one child (so we have two children infected by time 2), then at time 3 we can spread to another (if we haven't injected again) or inject again at time 2 to get two children by time 2? \n\n                  Actually, we can model the infection of the children of a node as:\n\n                      We have k children. We can inject at most some of them at arbitrary times. Let x be the number of injections we use for the children of this node. Then the remaining k - x children will be infected by spreading. The spreading can only happen one per second, but note: the spreading from this node can only start after the node is infected and after we have at least one child infected (by injection) so that we can spread.\n\n                  The time for the last child to be infected is: max( injection_time_i, time_when_spreading_catches_up )\n\n                  How to minimize the maximum time for the children of this node?\n\n                  We can use a greedy: we sort the injection times (which we can choose arbitrarily) and then the spreading will fill the gaps.\n\n                  But note: we have a global injection per second.\n\n          Actually, the intended solution is to use a greedy on the entire tree:\n\n            Step 1: Count the children for each node: deg[i] for i in 1..n.\n\n            Step 2: We create an array `arr` of deg[i] for all i that has deg[i] > 0. Then we sort `arr` in descending order.\n\n            Step 3: We also note that we can inject the root at time 0.\n\n            Then, we consider: we have a number of nodes that have children. For each such node, we need to schedule the infection of its children.\n\n            We can think: the infection process for the children of a node i starts at time t0 (when node i is infected) and then we have deg[i] children to infect. We can inject some of them and then spread the rest. The spreading can do one per second. The injections can be done at any second after t0.\n\n            The minimal time to infect all children of node i is: t0 + 1 + (deg[i] - 1)   if we do one injection and then spread the rest? But wait, we can do multiple injections. The optimal is to inject as many as possible at the earliest seconds.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n              Let x = number of seconds after t0 that we use to inject children of node i. Then the spreading will cover the remaining deg[i] - x children, but note: the spreading can only start after the first injection (which is at t0+1) and then we can spread one per second. So the last child is infected at: t0 + 1 + (deg[i] - x) + (x - 1) ??? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a greedy scheduling:\n\n              We have a timeline. At time t0+1, we can inject one child. Then at time t0+2, we can inject another and also spread one from the first child? But note: the spreading from node i requires that at least one child is infected. So at time t0+1, we inject one child -> then at time t0+2, we can spread to one child (so we have two children) and also inject another child (if we want) -> then at time t0+3, we can spread to two children (one from the first child and one from the second child? but no, the spreading is per node: from node i, we can spread at most one per second) -> so only one spread from node i per second.\n\n            Therefore, the process for the children of node i:\n\n              At time t0+1: inject one -> count=1\n              At time t0+2: inject one and spread one -> count=3? \n                  Actually, the spreading operation happens for each node that has at least one child infected. So at time t0+1, node i has one child infected -> so at time t0+2, we can spread one more from node i. And then we also inject one (which could be anywhere, not necessarily in this node) -> but we are focusing on node i.\n\n            However, the injections are global. We can choose which node to inject. So we might not inject two in the same node.\n\n            Therefore, we need a global simulation.\n\n          Known solution from a known code (from a similar problem):\n\n            We maintain a heap (priority queue) of the number of uninfected children per node, but also tracking the time when the node was infected? \n\n          The provided code in program2.py does:\n\n            things = {0: const}\n            for each parent in the input: \n                if parent in things: things[parent] += 1\n                else: things[parent] = const\n\n            Then, we push the values (as negative) into a max-heap (min-heap for negatives).\n\n            Then, we simulate by seconds. The variable `time` starts at 0.\n\n            In the while loop:\n\n                f = -heap[0]\n\n                if f <= time: \n                    pop and continue   # meaning this node has no more uninfected children? or the remaining uninfected children can be handled within the current time? \n\n                else if f >= const:\n                    then we do: f = f - const + time + 1\n                    pop the heap\n                    if f > time: push -f\n\n                else:\n                    f = f - 1\n                    pop\n                    if f > time: push -f\n\n                time += 1\n\n          What does this do?\n\n          The value `const` is used to mark whether a node has been processed or not? \n\n          Let me try with a small example: n=2, tree: [1] (so vertex2 has parent1)\n\n          Then: \n            things = {0: const}   # const = 1<<18\n            then for parent=1: \n                if 1 in things? no -> things[1] = const.\n\n            Then we push: \n                -const (for 0) and -const (for 1)\n\n          Then we start:\n\n            time=0:\n                f = const (from the heap top) -> which is 262144, which is >= const -> so we do:\n                    f = const - const + 0+1 = 1\n                    then pop the heap, then if 1>0 -> push -1.\n\n                Then the heap has: -const (for 0) and -1.\n\n                time becomes 1.\n\n            time=1:\n                f = min(-const, -1) -> the smallest is -const? but we have a min-heap for negatives, so the top is -const? \n                Actually, we use heapq which is a min-heap. We push negative values, so the smallest negative is the largest absolute value.\n\n                So the top is -1? because -1 > -const? -> no, -1 is greater than -const (since const is large positive). So the heap top is -const? \n\n                But we have two values: [-const, -1]. The heap will have the smallest at the top: -const is smaller than -1? yes. So we take -const -> f = const.\n\n                Then f>=const -> true: \n                    f = const - const + 1+1 = 2\n                    pop, then push -2 (because 2>1).\n\n                Then time becomes 2.\n\n            time=2:\n                top is -1? and -2? -> the smallest is -2? so f=2.\n                then 2<=2? -> no, then if 2>=const? no -> so we go to else: \n                    f = 2-1 = 1\n                    pop, then if 1>2? false -> so we don't push.\n\n                Then time becomes 3.\n\n            Then we check the heap: we have -1? \n                time=3: top=-1 -> f=1, which is <=3 -> pop and continue.\n\n            Then heap becomes empty, so we break and output time=3.\n\n          But the expected answer for n=2 is 1? \n\n          How should it work:\n\n            At time 0: inject the root (vertex1) -> infected.\n            At time 1: we can spread from the root to vertex2? and also we can inject one more? but we don't need to inject because we can spread to vertex2. Then the tree is infected at time 1.\n\n          So why did the simulation give 3?\n\n          Alternatively, the known answer for the first sample in the note: n=5, parents=[1,1,2,2] -> answer=2 seconds? \n\n          The note says: \n            The image depicts the tree from the first test case during each second.\n\n          But the sample output for the first test case is 2? \n\n          However, the sample input says:\n\n            Input: \n                2\n                5\n                1 1 2 2\n                2\n                1\n\n            Output:\n                2\n                1\n\n          So for n=5, answer=2; for n=2, answer=1.\n\n          The simulation for n=2 in the provided code gives 3, which is not 1.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code in program2.py is flawed.\n\n          But wait, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases doesn't exceed 200000. The sample has two test cases: n=5 and n=2, total n=7.\n\n          The provided code does:\n\n            things = {0: const}\n            for x in range(len(arr)):   # arr has n-1 elements\n                if arr[x] in things:\n                    things[arr[x]] += 1\n                else:\n                    things[arr[x]] = const\n\n          For n=2: \n              arr = [1] (one element)\n              then things[1] = const.\n\n          Then we push: \n              -const (for key0) and -const (for key1) -> two elements.\n\n          Then the simulation runs for 3 seconds.\n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          What if we do not include the root (0) in the initial `things`? \n\n          Let me try without the root (0):\n\n            things = {}\n            for parent in [1]: \n                if 1 in things? no -> things[1] = const.\n\n            Then we push: -const (for 1)\n\n            Then simulation:\n\n                time=0:\n                    f = const -> >=const -> then f = const - const + 0+1 = 1, then push -1.\n                    time=1.\n\n                time=1:\n                    f = 1 (from the heap) -> then else branch: f=1-1=0, then 0>1? false -> time becomes 2.\n\n            Then heap is empty -> output 2.\n\n          Still not 1.\n\n          What if we do not use const? \n\n          Known solution from a known code for \"Tree Infection\" (Codeforces Round #781):\n\n            #include <bits/stdc++.h>\n            using namespace std;\n\n            void solve() {\n                int n;\n                cin >> n;\n                vector<int> parent(n+1, 0), cnt(n+1, 0);\n                for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {\n                    cin >> parent[i];\n                    cnt[parent[i]]++;\n                }\n\n                vector<int> a;\n                for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                    if (cnt[i] > 0) {\n                        a.push_back(cnt[i]);\n                    }\n                }\n                a.push_back(1);   // for the root? because the root is initially infected? \n                sort(a.rbegin(), a.rend());\n\n                int t = 0;\n                priority_queue<int> q;\n                for (int i=0; i<a.size(); i++) {\n                    if (a[i] + i > t) {\n                        t = a[i] + i;\n                    }\n                }\n                for (int i=0; i<a.size(); i++) {\n                    if (a[i] + i > t) {\n                        // not needed because we set t to the max\n                    }\n                    q.push(a[i] + i);\n                }\n\n                int ans = t;\n                while (true) {\n                    int u = q.top(); q.pop();\n                    if (u <= t) {\n                        break;\n                    }\n                    t++;\n                    q.push(u-1);\n                }\n                cout << t << endl;\n            }\n\n            int main() {\n                int t;\n                cin >> t;\n                while (t--) solve();\n            }\n\n          Explanation:\n\n            We form an array `a` of the children counts for every node that has at least one child, and then we add 1 for the root (because the root is initially not infected? but we inject it at time0, so we count it as one node that we must account for?).\n\n            Then, we set t = max_{i} (a[i] + i)   // because we can inject the first a.size() nodes in the first a.size() seconds? \n\n            Then, we push a[i]+i into a max-heap.\n\n            Then, we simulate by increasing t until the maximum value in the heap is <= t.\n\n            In each second, we take the largest element in the heap (which is the most urgent: the node that will take the longest) and we reduce it by 1 (because we can spread one child in that node in this second) and then we increase t by 1.\n\n            We break when the largest is <= t.\n\n          For n=2:\n\n            a = [1] (from the root) and then we add 1 for the root? -> then a = [1, 1]? \n            But note: the root has one child? no, the root has one child (vertex2). But the root itself is infected at time0, so we have to account for the root? \n\n            The known code does: \n                a.push_back(1);   // for the root? \n            But why? \n\n            Actually, the root is infected at time0, but it has children that need to be infected. The known solution does:\n\n                We consider the root as a node that has one \"slot\" for infection? \n\n            Alternatively, we can think: the array `a` should include the root as a node that has one child (itself? no) -> the known solution might be different.\n\n          Let me read the known problem: \n            \"Tree Infection\" (Codeforces Round #781, problem D): \n\n              Input: a tree with n nodes, vertex1 is the root.\n\n              Initially, all nodes are uninfected. Each second:\n\n                  Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can choose one uninfected child of v to infect.\n\n                  Injection: you can choose any uninfected vertex to infect.\n\n              We want the minimal seconds to infect the entire tree.\n\n          Known solution steps:\n\n            Step 1: Count the number of children for each node: deg[i] for i in 1..n.\n\n            Step 2: Let f = frequency array of deg[i] for i in 1..n (only for deg[i]>0). Then we also need to account for the root? \n\n            Step 3: We note that we must inject every node that has at least one child? because spreading requires at least one child to be infected. But we can also inject the root.\n\n            Actually, we must inject at least one node in each connected component? but the tree is connected.\n\n            The known solution in C++ does:\n\n                vector<int> a;\n                for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n                    if (cnt[i]) a.push_back(cnt[i]);\n                }\n                a.push_back(1);   // This is for the root? or for the initial injection of the root?\n\n            Why push 1? \n\n            Explanation from known editorial:\n\n              We must inject the root. Then, for a node with k children, we can inject one child and then spread the rest. The time for a node i is: (time_injected) + (number of children - 1)   for the spreading? \n\n            But note: the spreading can only happen after the node is infected and after at least one child is infected.\n\n            The known solution does:\n\n                t0 = 0   // the time for the root injection\n                Then for a node i with k children, we inject one child at time t1, then the spreading will take k-1 seconds after that? so the last child is infected at time t1 + k - 1.\n\n            But we can inject multiple children at different times.\n\n            The array `a` is the list of the number of children for each node that has children. Then we add 1 for the root? \n\n            Then we set t = max_i (a[i] + i)   // i is the index in the sorted array (descending). \n\n            Why? \n\n            We sort `a` in descending order. Then we inject the nodes in increasing order of time? \n\n            For the node with the largest number of children, we inject one child at time 0? but we have to inject the root at time0.\n\n            Actually, we inject the root at time0. Then at time1, we can inject one child of the root? \n\n            The known solution might be:\n\n              We have to inject one node in each group (each node that has children) and also the root. The number of groups is len(a) (which is the number of nodes that have children) and then we add the root as an extra group? \n\n            The known solution in C++ for the sample n=2:\n\n                n=2: \n                  parent = [1]   (for vertex2)\n                  cnt[1] = 1, then a = [1] (from the for loop) and then we push_back(1) -> a = [1,1]\n                  sort in descending: [1,1]\n                  t = 0\n                  for i in range(0,2): \n                      a[0]+0 = 1+0 = 1 -> t = max(t,1) -> t=1\n                      a[1]+1 = 1+1 = 2 -> t = max(t,2) -> t=2\n\n                  Then we push into the heap: \n                      q.push(1+0)=1, q.push(1+1)=2.\n\n                  Then we start with t=2.\n                  while the top of the heap (2) > t (2) -> false, so we break and output t=2.\n\n            But the expected answer is 1.\n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          Another known solution from a known AC code for the same problem (from a different contestant):\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                p = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))\n                deg = [0] * (n+1)\n                for i in range(2, n+1):\n                    deg[p[i]] += 1\n\n                # Count the number of nodes that have at least one child: these are the ones that need to be considered for spreading.\n                # Also, we must have the root.\n                deg[0] = 1   # the root is at index0? or we are using 1-indexed for deg? \n                # deg[0] is not used.\n\n                # We are interested in the counts for i in range(1, n+1) that have deg[i]>0.\n                # But also, the root (index1) has deg[1] (which is the number of children) and we also need to account for the root itself.\n\n                # Create a list of the deg[i] for i in range(1, n+1) if deg[i]>0, and then add the root's own infection? \n                # Actually, we create:\n                arr = sorted([deg[i] for i in range(1, n+1) if deg[i] > 0], reverse=True)\n                # Then we want to include the root as well? \n                arr.insert(0, 1)   # at the beginning, add 1 for the root.\n\n                # Now, we have arr = [1, ...] and then the children counts.\n\n                # Then we do a binary search on the time T.\n\n                # Or we simulate:\n\n                # We know that at time0, we inject the root.\n\n                # Then, for each node with children, we can inject one child at any time, and then the spreading will cover the rest.\n\n                # The constraint: the total time must be at least (1 + (arr[i] - 1)) for each node i? but we can pipeline.\n\n                # Instead, we do:\n\n                #   Let T be the current time.

So we cannot spread at time0.\n\n                #       At time1:\n                #           Injection: we inject one child of the root.\n                #       Then at the spreading phase of time1: \n                #           The root has one child infected, so we can spread to one more child of the root.\n\n                #   So for the root with two children, we would inject one child at time1, and then spread to the other at time1 (in the same second) -> no, the spreading phase happens after the injection phase in the same second? \n\n                #   The problem says: \n                #       Each second: \n                #           Spreading: for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected, you can spread to at most one other child.\n                #           Then, injection: you can choose any healthy vertex to infect.\n\n                #   So at time0:\n                #       Injection: inject the root.\n                #       Then spreading: the root has no child infected (because we haven't injected any child) -> so no spreading.\n                #   At time1:\n                #       Injection: inject one child of the root.\n                #       Then spreading: the root has one child infected, so we can spread to one more child of the root.\n                #       -> then we have two children of the root infected at time1.\n\n                #   So the root with two children: the two children are infected at time1.\n\n                #   Therefore, for the root, we do not need to inject two children; we inject one and then spread one.\n\n                #   So for a node with k children, we only need to inject one child (at some time) and then the remaining k-1 can be spread over k-1 seconds.\n\n                #   Therefore, the last child of a node i will be infected at time: (time_injection) + (k-1)\n\n                #   and we require that this is <= T.\n\n                #   Also, we have to account for the time when the node i itself is infected. But note: to spread from node i, node i must be infected. When is node i infected? \n\n                #   If node i is not the root, then it is a child of some node. So its infection time is determined by its parent.\n\n                #   Therefore, the constraint for node i is: \n                #         time_injection_child >= infection_time_of_node_i + 1   (because we can only inject after the node is infected)\n                #         and then the last child is infected at time_injection_child + (k-1) <= T.\n\n                #   But we can choose the injection times arbitrarily as long as they are distinct and in [0, T] (except the root at time0).\n\n                #   This is complex.\n\n          Given the complexity, and that the provided code in program2.py is not working for n=2, and the known solution from Codeforces Round #781 is also not matching, I will output the missing code for program1.py and for program2.py based on the TODO in the provided code.\n\n          For program1.py, the missing line is:\n\n              dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          For program2.py, the TODO is in the else branch:\n\n              if f > time:\n                  heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          But the code already does that in the else branch? \n\n          The else branch currently is:\n\n                else:\n                    f -= 1\n                    heappop(laze)\n                    if f > time:\n                        heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          And the TODO is right after the else branch, so it is inside the else branch.\n\n          But the code already has the if statement and the push. So the TODO is not missing? \n\n          Let me look at the code for program2.py:\n\n            else:\n                f -= 1\n                heappop(laze)\n\n                if f > time:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the TODO is to push -f into the heap? \n\n          So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          But note: the code already has an if condition: only push if f>time.\n\n          So the missing line is: \n\n                heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          However, the code after the TODO might be:\n\n                if f > time:\n                    heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          But the TODO is inside the if-block? \n\n          Actually, the TODO is at the place of the push.\n\n          So for program2.py, the missing code is: \n\n                heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          But wait, the code already has the if condition, so we only push if f>time.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is that one line.\n\n          Summary:\n\n            program1.py: missing line: dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n            program2.py: missing line: heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          However, we must output in JSON format.\n\n          Example:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n              \"program2\": \"heappush(laze, -f)\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the code might have indentation. In program1.py, the TODO is in an if-block:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the missing line should be indented. But the problem says: output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n          We output the line of code that should be placed at the TODO.\n\n          Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is inside the else branch and inside the if-block:\n\n                else:\n                    f = f - 1\n                    heappop(laze)\n                    if f > time:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          So the missing code for program2.py is one line: heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          But note: the code in program2.py uses `f` (which is an integer) and we push the negative.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n              \"program2\": \"    heappush(laze, -f)\"\n            }\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly\", and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n          And the missing code might be exactly the line without extra spaces? But the context requires indentation.\n\n          Since the TODO in program1.py is inside an if-block and already has 8 spaces of indentation (because the for loop is 4 spaces, then the if is 8 spaces), we output:\n\n              \"program1\": \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          But the existing code in program1.py has:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with:\n\n                dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          and the indentation level is 8 spaces.\n\n          Similarly, in program2.py, the TODO is inside an if-block inside an else branch, which is inside a while loop. The existing code has:\n\n                else:\n                    f -= 1\n                    heappop(laze)\n                    if f > time:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The if-block is at 12 spaces (while: 4, else: 8, if: 12). So we output:\n\n                \"program2\": \"        heappush(laze, -f)\"\n\n          But the problem does not specify the indentation level. However, to match the surrounding, we output the same indentation as the surrounding.\n\n          Alternatively, we output the exact line that would be placed, including the indentation.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that goes in place of the TODO.\n\n          For program1.py, the missing code is one line: \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n          For program2.py, the missing code is one line: \"heappush(laze, -f)\"\n\n          But without indentation, it might not work.\n\n          Since the problem does not specify, and to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program, with the same indentation as the TODO line.\n\n          How many spaces? \n\n          In program1.py, the TODO is at the same indentation as the previous line: \n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The TODO line is indented by 4 more spaces than the for loop. The for loop is at 4 spaces, so the TODO is at 8 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we output for program1.py: \"    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n\n          In program2.py, the TODO is at:\n\n                if f > time:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          This is inside the else branch, which is at 8 spaces (because the while is 4, else is 8), and the if is 12 spaces. But the TODO is at 12 spaces.\n\n          However, the code in the provided program2.py has:\n\n            else:\n                f -= 1\n                heappop(laze)\n\n                if f > time:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The line \"if f > time\" is at 8 spaces? or 12? \n\n          The provided code in the problem statement for program2.py uses spaces? and the else branch is at 4 spaces? \n\n          Let me count:\n\n            for T in range(t):\n                n = ...   [4 spaces]\n                arr = ... [4 spaces]\n                things = ... [4 spaces]\n                for x in ...: [4 spaces]\n                laze = [] [4 spaces]\n                for x in things: [4 spaces]\n                    heappush(laze, -things[x]) [8 spaces]\n                time = 0 [4 spaces]\n                while ...: [4 spaces]\n                    f = ... [8 spaces]\n                    if ...: [8 spaces]\n                        ... [12 spaces]\n                    elif ...: [8 spaces]\n                        ... [12 spaces]\n                    else: [8 spaces]\n                        f -= 1 [12 spaces]\n                        heappop(laze) [12 spaces]\n                        if ...: [12 spaces]\n                            # TODO [16 spaces]\n\n          So the TODO is at 16 spaces? \n\n          But the code in the problem statement for program2.py is:\n\n            else:\n                f -= 1\n                heappop(laze)\n\n                if f > time:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The indentation might be 4, 8, 12, 16 for nested blocks.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify. We will assume the existing indentation level.\n\n          Since the line above the TODO is at the same level: \"if f > time:\" and the TODO is at the same level, we output for program2.py: \n\n                \"    heappush(laze, -f)\"   -> but how many spaces? \n\n          To be safe, we output the code as it would be in the program, which is at the same indentation as the TODO.\n\n          But the TODO is at the same indentation as the \"if f > time\", which is 12 spaces? or 8? \n\n          In the provided code for program2.py, the else branch is at 8 spaces (relative to the while) and the if inside the else is at 12 spaces.\n\n          So the missing code should be at 16 spaces? \n\n          But the code in the problem statement for program2.py might use 4 spaces per indent.\n\n          Therefore:\n\n            while: 4\n            else: 8\n            f -= 1: 8? or 12? \n\n          The code:\n\n            else:\n                f -= 1\n                heappop(laze)\n                if f > time:\n                    # TODO\n\n          The else: -> 4 (while) + 4 = 8\n          then the body of else: 12\n          then the if: 12 (inside the else) and the body of if: 16.\n\n          So the TODO is at 16 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n                \"        heappush(laze, -f)\"   (8 spaces? but 16 spaces is 4*4=16, which is 4 indents -> 16 spaces)\n\n          But the problem does not require the exact spaces, but the code as it would be inserted.\n\n          Alternatively, we output without extra spaces and hope that the existing indentation is correct.\n\n          Given the complexity, and that the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", I will output the code without extra indentation and hope that the existing indentation is maintained.\n\n          But the safest is to output with the same indentation as the surrounding.\n\n          How about we count the spaces in the provided code for the TODO line? \n\n          In program1.py, the TODO is at:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The second line has 8 spaces (if the if is at 4 and the body is 8).\n\n          In program2.py, the TODO is at:\n\n                if f > time:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          This is inside an else branch that is at 8 spaces (relative to the while) and then the if is at 12 spaces, and the TODO is at 16 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, for program1.py: 8 spaces -> two tabs or 8 spaces. We output 8 spaces? \n\n          But the problem does not specify tabs or spaces. We will use spaces.\n\n          We output:\n\n            program1: \"        dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"   (8 spaces at the beginning)\n\n            program2: \"                heappush(laze, -f)\"   (16 spaces at the beginning)\n\n          However, this might be overkill.\n\n          Alternatively, we output without any extra spaces and let the existing indentation handle it.\n\n          But the TODO is already at the correct indentation level. When we replace the TODO comment with the code, the indentation is already there.\n\n          Therefore, we only need to output the code without leading spaces.\n\n          I will output without leading spaces.\n\n          Final answer:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\",\n              \"program2\": \"heappush(laze, -f)\"\n            }\n\n          But then the program1.py would become:\n\n                if dp[i] > dmx.get(pref[i], -INF):\n                    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          which is 8 spaces for the if and 8 spaces for the body.\n\n          And program2.py would become:\n\n                else:\n                    f -= 1\n                    heappop(laze)\n                    if f > time:\n                        heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          which is 8 spaces for the else, 12 spaces for the body of else, and 16 spaces for the body of the if.\n\n          But the existing code in program2.py has:\n\n                else:\n                    f -= 1\n                    heappop(laze)\n                    if f > time:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n          When we replace the TODO, we get:\n\n                else:\n                    f -= 1\n                    heappop(laze)\n                    if f > time:\n                        heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          Therefore, we output the code without any extra leading spaces.\n\n          However, in program1.py, the line after the if might be:\n\n                    dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\n\n          and that is at the same indentation as the TODO comment.\n\n          So we output:\n\n            \"program1\": \"dmx[pref[i]] = dp[i]\"\n            \"program2\": \"heappush(laze, -f)\"\n\n          But note: in program2.py, the code after the TODO might be:\n\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          and we replace that with:\n\n                    heappush(laze, -f)\n\n          So the indentation is already there.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is as above."
