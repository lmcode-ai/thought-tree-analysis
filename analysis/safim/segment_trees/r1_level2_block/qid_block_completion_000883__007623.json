    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is to count the number of pairs (i, j) (i < j) of two-letter strings (from 'a' to 'k') that differ in exactly one position.\n\nThe current code sets up a 2D array `data` of size 11x11 (since there are 11 letters from 'a' to 'k') to count the frequency of each string.\n\nThe current code then has two nested loops for j and k (which represent the first and second character indices) and then an inner loop for l. The current code has two conditions:\n\n1. If j != l: then there is a TODO.\n2. If k != l: then it adds data[j][k] * data[j][l] to the answer.\n\nBut note: the condition `if k != l` is inside the loop for l and the condition `if j != l` is also inside the same loop. However, the current code structure is:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nThis is incorrect because the TODO is only for the case when the first character differs (and the second is the same) and the second condition is for when the first character is the same and the second differs? But note: the condition `if k != l` is adding pairs that have the same first character (j) and different second character (k and l). However, the TODO is for the case when the first character differs (j != l) and the second character is the same? Actually, the variable l in the inner loop is being used for two different purposes: in the first condition it's compared to j (which is the first character index) and in the second condition it's compared to k (the second character index). This is confusing.\n\nActually, the intended approach is:\n\nWe have two ways to have exactly one difference:\n1. The first character is different and the second is the same.\n2. The first character is the same and the second is different.\n\nBut note: the current code for the second case is already implemented: \n    if k != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nThis is for a fixed j (so same first character) and then for two different second characters (k and l). However, this counts every pair of strings in the same row j (same first character) that have different second characters. But note: this counts each pair twice? Because for two distinct second characters k and l, we are adding data[j][k] * data[j][l] and then when l and k are swapped we will add again? Actually, the inner loop for l runs from 0 to 10. So for a fixed j and k, we are adding for every l != k: data[j][k] * data[j][l]. This means that for a fixed j, and for two distinct second characters k and l, the pair (k, l) is counted twice: once when k is fixed and l is the other, and once when l is fixed and k is the other? Actually, no: because k and l are symmetric? But note: the inner loop runs l from 0 to 10 for every k. So for a fixed j, the total for the second case would be:\n\n    for k: for l != k: data[j][k] * data[j][l] \n    = for k: data[j][k] * (total in row j excluding data[j][k])\n\nBut note: this counts each unordered pair (k, l) twice: once as (k, l) and once as (l, k). However, the problem requires unordered pairs (i, j) with i<j. So if we do this, we are counting each pair twice. Therefore, the current code at the end does `print(answer//2)`. So that is okay.\n\nBut what about the first case? We need to count the pairs that have the same second character and different first character. The TODO is for that.\n\nSo for the first case: we fix the second character (k) and then for two different first characters (j and l) we want to add data[j][k] * data[l][k]. However, note the current loops: j is the first character, k is the second character, and then l is running from 0 to 10. But in the condition `if j != l`, we are comparing the first character index j with l? But l is intended to be another first character? Actually, we are missing a loop? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\nFor the first case (same second character, different first character) we can do:\n\n    for k in range(11):   # for each second character\n        for j in range(11):\n            for l in range(j+1, 11):   # to avoid double counting? \n                ... \n\nBut the current structure is:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # then we are considering two different first characters j and l, and the same second character k?\n                    # so we want to add data[j][k] * data[l][k] for the same k?\n\nBut note: in the inner loop, k is fixed? Actually, no: k is the second character and we are iterating over k. So for a fixed k (second character) and fixed j (first character) and then l runs over first characters. So we can do:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut then we are counting each pair (j, l) for the same k? And then we are doing for every k? And then we are also doing the same for the second case? \n\nBut note: the second case is already implemented as:\n\n    if k != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nSo the entire loop becomes:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut then we are counting:\n\n- For the first case: for each second character k, and for each pair of distinct first characters (j, l), we add the product of the counts. This counts each unordered pair (j, l) twice? Because for a fixed k, when j and l are distinct, we run over l from 0 to 10: so for (j, l) and (l, j) we add twice? Actually, no: because j and l are symmetric? We are iterating j and l independently. For a fixed k, and two distinct first characters j and l, we will add:\n\n    when j = j0 and l = l0: data[j0][k] * data[l0][k]\n    when j = l0 and l = j0: data[l0][k] * data[j0][k]   [same as above]\n\nSo we are adding twice for the same unordered pair (j0, l0). Therefore, at the end we do `answer//2` and that will take care of both cases.\n\nBut note: the second case is also being counted twice? Because in the second case, for a fixed j (first character) and two distinct second characters k and l, we are adding:\n\n    when k = k0 and l = l1: data[j][k0] * data[j][l1]\n    when k = l1 and l = k0: data[j][l1] * data[j][k0]   [same as above]\n\nSo both cases are being counted twice. Therefore, the total answer is the sum of both cases (each case counted twice) and then we divide by 2 at the end.\n\nSo the TODO should be:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the inner loop runs for every j, k, l. The total complexity is 11*11*11 = 1331, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the existing code already has:\n\n    if k != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nSo we just need to fill the TODO.\n\nHowever, the existing code has two separate if conditions. We can write:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 10^5, and we are doing 1331 per test case, which is acceptable because 1331 * (number of test cases) <= 1331 * 100 = 133100, which is acceptable.\n\nSo for program1.py, the missing code is the line: `answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]` inside the condition `if j != l`.\n\nBut wait: the current code has the two conditions as separate. The TODO is only for the first condition. The second condition is already written. So we just need to replace the TODO with that line.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are to determine if a six-digit ticket is lucky (first three digits sum equals last three digits sum). The input is the number of test cases t, and then t lines of six-digit strings.\n\nThe code reads the input, skips the first line (which is t) and then processes the rest. The function `main` is supposed to return a list of answers (each answer is either \"YES\" or \"NO\").\n\nSo for each string `i` (which is a six-digit string), we can split the string into two halves: the first three and the last three. Then we compute the sum of the first three and the sum of the last three. If they are equal, then we append \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nBut note: the input is read as:\n\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\\n')[1:]\n\nSo `s` is a list of the test cases (each is a string of six digits).\n\nThen we iterate over each test case string `i`.\n\nWe can do:\n\n    first_three = i[:3]\n    last_three = i[3:]\n\nThen compute the sum of the digits in `first_three` and `last_three`.\n\nBut note: each character is a digit, so we can convert each character to an integer.\n\nExample:\n\n    s1 = sum(int(x) for x in first_three)\n    s2 = sum(int(x) for x in last_three)\n\nThen if s1 == s2, then append \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nSo the code for the TODO in program2.py is:\n\n    first_three = i[:3]\n    last_three = i[3:]\n    s1 = sum(int(x) for x in first_three)\n    s2 = sum(int(x) for x in last_three)\n    if s1 == s2:\n        r.append(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says we can output in any case, but the example outputs are in uppercase. So \"YES\" and \"NO\" are acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    if sum(map(int, i[:3])) == sum(map(int, i[3:])):\n        r.append(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        r.append(\"NO\")\n\nSo we'll write that.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n    first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\n    second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\n    if first_sum == second_sum:\n        r.append(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the problem says the ticket is a string of six digits. We can also do:\n\n    if sum(int(x) for x in i[:3]) == sum(int(x) for x in i[3:6]):\n\nBut since the string is exactly six digits, we can use slicing: [0:3] and [3:6] or simply [3:].\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py, the missing code is the line: `answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]` (with proper indentation). But note: the existing code has the condition `if j != l` and then a TODO. We are replacing the TODO with that line.\n\nFor program2.py, the missing code is the block that processes one test case string `i` and appends to `r`.\n\nBut note: the TODO in program2.py is at the line:\n\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are to replace the TODO with the code that processes `i` and appends the result to `r`.\n\nSo the code for program2.py is:\n\n    first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\n    second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\n    if first_sum == second_sum:\n        r.append(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut we can write it in a more compact way, but for clarity we'll write the above.\n\nAlternatively, we can write:\n\n    r.append(\"YES\" if sum(int(d) for d in i[:3]) == sum(int(d) for d in i[3:]) else \"NO\")\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. And we are to output the exact code that goes in the TODO.\n\nNow, we output the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\\n            r.append(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        else:\\n            r.append(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the indentation in program2.py: the for loop is at the same level as the previous lines. The TODO is inside the for loop. We must indent the code appropriately. The existing code has:\n\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the code we put must be indented by 8 spaces (relative to the function main) but in the TODO we are replacing the comment. Actually, the current indentation level is 4 for the function and then 8 for the loop. So we write the block with 8 spaces of indentation? But the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the code that replaces the TODO, which is the block of code that should be at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the block without the initial 8 spaces? But the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the code that would be placed at the TODO, and it must be properly indented relative to the loop.\n\nBut note: the existing code has:\n\n    r = []\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut the first line of the block must be at the same indentation as the comment. So we write it with 8 spaces? Actually, the problem does not require the entire program, so we output the code that would be inserted without the initial 8 spaces? Because the TODO is already at the 8-space indentation. But to be safe, we output the code as it would appear in the program at that indentation level.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact lines that are missing, and they will be inserted at the TODO.\n\nSo for program2.py, we output:\n\n        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the variable `r` is the list we are building.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it in one line? But the problem does not require that.\n\nNow, we must format the JSON. We need to escape the newlines and quotes.\n\nBut the problem says: output the JSON with the structure: \n{\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nWe'll use double quotes for the JSON keys and values. And for the string values, we must escape the newlines and the inner double quotes.\n\nFor program1: the string is a single line: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nFor program2: the string is multiple lines. We can represent it as:\n\n        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\\n            r.append(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        else:\\n            r.append(\\\"NO\\\")\n\nBut note: the indentation in the program: each line of the block is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the function). So we have:\n\nLine 1: 8 spaces + the code for the first line\nLine 2: 8 spaces + the code for the second line\netc.\n\nBut the TODO is at 8 spaces. So we write the block with each line starting with 8 spaces? Actually, no: because the existing code already has the for loop at 8 spaces. The TODO is at 8 spaces. We are replacing the TODO with a block that is at 8 spaces for each line? But the first line of the block must be at 8 spaces, and the next lines (like the if and else) must be at 8 and 12? Actually, the code we write is:\n\n        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nThis is 8 spaces for the first two lines, and then 12 spaces for the append? Actually, the if and else are at 8, and the append is at 12. But the existing code uses 4-space indentation? We'll assume the existing code uses 4-space indentation per level.\n\nSo the function main is indented by 0, then the body of main is 4, then the for loop is 8, and the block inside the for loop is 12? Actually, the existing code:\n\ndef main():\n    s = ...   # 4 spaces\n    r = []    # 4 spaces\n    for i in s:   # 4 spaces? Actually, no: the for loop is at 4 spaces? \n\nWait, the existing code:\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\\n')[1:]\n    r = []\n    for i in s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n    return r\n\nSo the for loop is at 4 spaces? Then the body of the for loop (the TODO) is at 8 spaces. So the code we write must be at 8 spaces for the first level and 12 for the inner blocks.\n\nBut the code we wrote:\n\n        first_sum = ...   # 8 spaces\n        second_sum = ...  # 8 spaces\n        if ...:           # 8 spaces\n            r.append(...) # 12 spaces\n        else:             # 8 spaces\n            r.append(...) # 12 spaces\n\nSo we write:\n\n        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the existing code has the for loop and then the TODO at 8 spaces. We are replacing the TODO with the above block. So we output the above block without the initial 8 spaces? Actually, no: the TODO is at 8 spaces, and we are replacing the comment with the above block. The entire block must be at 8 and 12 as above.\n\nBut when we output the string for program2, we must include the newlines and the exact indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the code without the extra indentation? But the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the code that would be written at the TODO, which is the block of code that is at the same level as the TODO.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\n            r.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            r.append(\"NO\")\n\nBut note: the first line of the block is at 8 spaces (relative to the function) and the if and else are at 8, and the append is at 12. This is acceptable.\n\nNow, we format the JSON.\n\nWe must escape the double quotes and the backslashes? Actually, the only special characters are the double quotes in the strings and the newlines.\n\nFor program1: the string is: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nFor program2: the string is: \n        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\\n            r.append(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        else:\\n            r.append(\\\"NO\\\")\n\nBut note: the program2 string has double quotes. We must escape them as \\\".\n\nSo the program2 string becomes:\n\n\"        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\\n            r.append(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        else:\\n            r.append(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n\nNow, the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\\n            r.append(\\\"YES\\\")\\n        else:\\n            r.append(\\\"NO\\\")\"\n}\n\nBut note: the problem says the output must be exactly the missing code. We are not including the existing code.\n\nLet me write the entire program1.py after completion:\n\nfor i in range(int(input())):\r\n    data = [[0 for l in range(11)] for k in range(11)]\r\n\r\n    for j in range(int(input())):\r\n        first, second = input()\r\n        data[ord(first)-ord('a')][ord(second)-ord('a')] += 1\r\n\r\n    answer = 0\r\n    for j in range(11):\r\n        for k in range(11):\r\n            for l in range(11):\r\n                if j != l:\r\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\r\n                if k != l:\r\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\r\n\r\n    print(answer//2)\n\nAnd program2.py:\n\nimport sys\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip().split('\\n')[1:]\r\n    r = []\r\n    for i in s:\r\n        first_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[:3])\r\n        second_sum = sum(int(d) for d in i[3:])\r\n        if first_sum == second_sum:\r\n            r.append(\"YES\")\r\n        else:\r\n            r.append(\"NO\")\r\n    return r\r\nprint(*main(), sep='\\n')\r\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases in program1 is at most 10^5, and we are doing 11*11*11 per test case, which is 1331 per test case, and the number of test cases t is at most 100, so total operations 1331 * 100 = 133100, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, we output the JSON as described."
