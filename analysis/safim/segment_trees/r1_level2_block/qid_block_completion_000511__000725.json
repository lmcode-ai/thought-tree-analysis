With the current prefix array (without a leading 0), we can do:\n\n          if x-y-1 < 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n      But note: if x-y-1 is negative, we subtract nothing? Actually, we can do:\n\n          total_free = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\n      But we cannot use an if in a print?

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given n and q, then a list of n prices. We sort the prices in descending order and then compute the prefix sums so that prices[i] becomes the sum of the first i+1 highest prices (if we consider 0-indexed). However, note that the problem requires the maximum total value of items received for free.\n\nThe promotion: if a customer purchases at least x items, then the y cheapest of them are free. The customer can choose which items to buy. Therefore, to maximize the free value, the customer would want to have the y cheapest items in the purchase to be as expensive as possible. But note: the free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. So the strategy is to choose x items such that the y cheapest among them are as expensive as possible.\n\nHow? We can think: we want to have at least y items that are expensive, but note that the free items are the cheapest y in the purchase. So we can set the purchase to include the top (x - y) items and then the next y items? Actually, we cannot include an item twice. The idea is to take a contiguous segment of the sorted array? But note: we sorted in descending order.\n\nAfter sorting in descending order: [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}], where a0 is the highest.\n\nIf we choose the first x items (the x most expensive), then the y cheapest in that set would be the last y of these x, i.e., the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array? Actually, in descending order, the cheapest in the set of the first x would be the last ones. So the free items would be the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1)? But note: in descending order, the set of the first x items is [a0, a1, ..., a_{x-1}]. The cheapest in this set is a_{x-1} and the next cheapest is a_{x-2}, etc. So the y cheapest would be the last y in this segment: from index (x-y) to (x-1)? Actually, no: in descending order, the last y are the smallest. So the free items are the y smallest in the chosen set, which are the last y of the chosen set: indices from (x-y) to (x-1) in the array? But note: the array is 0-indexed.\n\nBut wait: if we take the first x items (0-indexed: indices 0 to x-1), then the y smallest in this set are the items at indices (x-y) to (x-1)? Actually, no: the entire set is sorted descending, so the last y items in the set (from index x-y to x-1) are the smallest. Therefore, the sum of the free items would be the sum of the segment [x-y, x-1] in the sorted array? But note: we have the prefix sum array, but we computed the prefix sum in the descending order.\n\nWe have built a prefix sum array for the descending sorted array. However, note that the prefix sum array we built is cumulative from the largest. Specifically:\n  prices[0] = p0 (largest)\n  prices[1] = p0 + p1\n  ...\n  prices[i] = p0 + p1 + ... + p_i\n\nBut we need the sum of the free items, which are the y items from index (x-y) to (x-1). How can we compute that?\n\nWe can precompute a prefix sum array for the descending sorted array? Actually, we already have one. Then the sum of the free items would be:\n  total = (prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1])   if x-y-1 >=0, else prefix[x-1] (if x-y==0 then we take from 0 to x-1? Actually, if x-y==0 then y=x, so we take the entire set? But note: if x-y==0, then we are taking the entire set of x items? Actually, no: the free items are the y cheapest, which are the last y in the set. If y=x, then we take the entire set.\n\nBut note: our prefix array is cumulative from the start. So the sum of the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) is:\n  prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1]   if x-y-1 >=0, but if x-y==0 then we want the entire prefix from 0 to x-1? Actually, if x-y==0, then we are taking the segment from 0 to x-1? That doesn't seem right.\n\nWait: we have the array sorted in descending order: [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}]. The set of the first x items: [a0, a1, ..., a_{x-1}]. The y smallest in this set are the last y: a_{x-y}, a_{x-y+1}, ..., a_{x-1}. The sum of these is:\n  S = a_{x-y} + a_{x-y+1} + ... + a_{x-1}\n\nWe can express this as:\n  S = (prefix[x-1] - prefix[x-y-1])   if x-y-1 >=0, but if x-y==0 then we are taking from index0 to x-1? Actually, if x-y==0, then we are taking the entire set from 0 to x-1? But note: our prefix array is defined as:\n      prefix[0] = a0\n      prefix[1] = a0+a1\n      ...\n      prefix[i] = a0+...+a_i\n\nSo the sum from index i to j (inclusive) is prefix[j] - prefix[i-1] for i>=1. For i=0, it's prefix[j].\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n  if x-y-1 >= 0:\n      free_sum = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n  else:\n      free_sum = prices[x-1]   # because then we are taking from 0 to x-1? But wait: if x-y==0, then y=x, so we are taking the entire set of x items? Then the free items are the entire set? Then the sum is prices[x-1] (which is the prefix sum for the first x items).\n\nBut note: if x-y==0, then we are taking the segment from index (x-y)=x to x-1? That doesn't make sense. Actually, we have an off-by-one.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute a prefix sum array that includes 0 at the beginning? Actually, we can do:\n\n  Let prefix[0] = 0\n  Then for i from 1 to n: prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n\nBut in the current code, we have:\n\n  prices.sort(reverse=True)\n  for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n      prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\nSo our prices[0] is the first element, prices[1] is the first two, etc.\n\nTo get the sum from index i to j (0-indexed) in the original array (which is the sorted descending array), we can do:\n\n  If we want the segment from L to R (inclusive), then:\n      if L==0: sum = prices[R]\n      else: sum = prices[R] - prices[L-1]\n\nBut note: the segment we want is from (x-y) to (x-1). The indices are from (x-y) to (x-1). So:\n\n  L = x-y, R = x-1.\n\nThen:\n  if (x-y) == 0:\n      free_sum = prices[x-1]\n  else:\n      free_sum = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\nBut wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? Actually, we have the condition y<=x, so x-y>=0. Then x-y-1 can be negative? Only if x-y==0, then x-y-1 = -1. So we must avoid that.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\n  if x-y-1 < 0:\n      free_sum = prices[x-1]\n  else:\n      free_sum = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\nBut note: our array 'prices' is 0-indexed and we have computed the prefix for indices 0 to n-1.\n\nHowever, what if x is 0? But x>=y>=1, so x>=1.\n\nBut note: the constraints: n, q up to 200000. We have built the prefix array for the entire array. Then for each query (x, y), we want to compute the free_sum as above.\n\nBut wait: is that the maximum? Why? Because we are taking the top x items? Then the y smallest in that set are the last y of the top x. And that is the maximum we can get? Why?\n\nExplanation: To maximize the free value, we want the y free items to be as expensive as possible. The customer can choose any set of at least x items. However, if we choose a set that includes some cheap items, then the free items (the cheapest y) would be even cheaper. Therefore, the best is to choose the set of the x most expensive items. Then the free items are the y smallest in that set, which are the last y of the top x. And that is the maximum possible.\n\nTherefore, the plan for program1.py:\n\n  Read n, q.\n  Read the list of prices.\n  Sort the prices in descending order.\n  Build a prefix sum array: \n      prices[0] remains the first element.\n      prices[1] = prices[0] + prices[1] (the original element at index1, which is the second largest) ... but note: we are overwriting the array.\n\n  Then for each query (x, y):\n      We want the sum of the segment from (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array (0-indexed).\n\n      We can do:\n          if x-y-1 < 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]   # because we are taking the first x items: from 0 to x-1, and the free part is the entire set? Actually, no: the free part is the last y of the set, which in this case (if y=x) is the entire set. And the entire set's sum is prices[x-1] (since we have the prefix at index x-1).\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n  But note: our prefix array is for the entire array? And we are only building for the first n elements. We must be cautious: if x-1 is beyond the array? But x<=n, so it's safe.\n\n  However, what if x-y-1 is negative? We can write:\n\n      total_free = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >=0 else 0)\n\n  But wait: if x-y-1 is negative, then we subtract 0? Then total_free = prices[x-1]. That matches.\n\n  Alternatively, we can precompute a prefix array that has a 0 at the beginning? Actually, we can do:\n\n      prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n      sorted_prices = sorted(prices, reverse=True)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + sorted_prices[i-1]\n\n      Then for a query (x,y):\n          We want the segment from (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array? Actually, the indices in the sorted array for the segment are from (x-y) to (x-1) (0-indexed). Then the sum is:\n              prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]   ??? \n\n      Let me check: \n          prefix[x] = sum of sorted_prices[0] to sorted_prices[x-1] (because prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements).\n          prefix[x-y] = sum of sorted_prices[0] to sorted_prices[x-y-1].\n\n          Then the segment from (x-y) to (x-1) is from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array? That is the same as the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) (0-indexed). The number of elements is y.\n\n          Then the sum = prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]   because:\n              prefix[x] = (0 to x-1)\n              prefix[x-y] = (0 to x-y-1)\n              subtract: we get (x-y to x-1)\n\n      So that is simpler.\n\n  Therefore, we can change the code to:\n\n      n, q = map(int, input().split())\n      arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n      arr.sort(reverse=True)\n      prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n      for i in range(1, n+1):\n          prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n\n      Then for each query (x, y):\n          # We are going to take the top x items? Then the free items are the last y of these x, which are the y smallest in the set. They are the segment from (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array? Actually, in the sorted array (descending) the top x are the first x. The last y of the top x are the last y in the set of x, which are the smallest in the set. And they are the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array? But note: the entire array is sorted descending. The set of the top x is the first x elements. The smallest in that set is the last element of that set, which is at index x-1. The next smallest is at index x-2, etc. So the y smallest are the last y, which are the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1)? Actually, no: the entire set of x is indices 0 to x-1. The smallest in the set is at index x-1, the next at x-2, ... and the y-th smallest from the bottom is at index x-y. So the segment is from index (x-y) to (x-1). But note: in the prefix array we built, we have the entire array. The sum of the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) is:\n\n          free_sum = prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]   # because prefix[x] is the sum of the first x elements (indices0 to x-1), and prefix[x-y] is the sum of the first (x-y) elements (indices0 to x-y-1). Then subtracting, we get the segment from x-y to x-1? Actually, the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) is the (x-y+1)-th to the x-th element? But our prefix array is 0-indexed and the element at index i in the sorted array is stored as arr[i]. The prefix array is:\n\n            prefix[0] = 0\n            prefix[1] = arr[0]\n            prefix[2] = arr[0]+arr[1]\n            ...\n            prefix[i] = arr[0]+...+arr[i-1]\n\n          Then the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array is the same as the segment from the (x-y)-th element to the (x-1)-th element? How many elements? y elements.\n\n          The sum = prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]   because:\n            prefix[x] = arr[0] + ... + arr[x-1]\n            prefix[x-y] = arr[0] + ... + arr[x-y-1]\n            subtract: we get arr[x-y] + ... + arr[x-1]\n\n          Exactly the segment we want.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      for each query:\n          x, y = map(int, input().split())\n          result = prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]\n          print(result)\n\n  But note: the problem says \"For each query, print a single integer\". However, we are writing to stdout and then piping to program2.py? Actually, the problem says \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly. But program2.py is a separate program? Actually, the problem has two independent programs. We are to complete both.\n\n  However, the problem says: Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n  But note: the two programs are independent. The first program (program1.py) reads the input and outputs the answers for the queries. The second program (program2.py) reads from stdin and outputs the division for each test case.\n\n  The pipe \"program1.py | program2.py\" means that the output of program1.py becomes the input of program2.py. But that does not make sense for the problem? Because the two programs solve different problems.\n\n  Let me read the problem again: it says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and then the output format is a json with two keys: \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n  And the example: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n  But wait: the two programs are independent and are not meant to be piped? Actually, the problem says that we must output the missing code for both programs so that when we run the pipe, it runs correctly. However, the two programs have different inputs and outputs? \n\n  Actually, the problem has two separate programs. The pipe might be a mistake? Or perhaps the problem is that program1.py outputs integers (one per line) for the queries, and then program2.py expects input in the format of the division problem? But the division problem expects t test cases and then t integers. The output of program1.py is q integers (one per line). Then if we pipe, program2.py would read the output of program1.py as its input? That would be:\n\n      The first integer from program1.py would be the t for program2.py? Then the next t integers would be the ratings? But the problem says the input for program2.py is: first line t, then t lines each with one integer.\n\n  How can we run both? Actually, the problem says \"runs correctly\", meaning that the entire command should run without error and produce the correct output for both? But the pipe only connects the stdout of program1 to the stdin of program2. So the input for program2 would be the output of program1. But the two programs are independent? They have their own input from stdin? \n\n  This is confusing. Let me look at the problem statement again: it says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and then \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n  But note: the two programs are independent. The pipe is connecting the output of program1 to the input of program2. So the input for program2 is the output of program1. Therefore, the output of program1 must be the input that program2 expects.\n\n  What input does program2 expect? \n      The first line is t (the number of test cases), then t lines each with one integer (the rating).\n\n  What output does program1 produce? \n      It should produce q integers, one per line (for each query).\n\n  Therefore, if we set the output of program1 to be:\n      first line: the integer t (which would be the number of test cases for program2)\n      then t lines: each line an integer (the rating)\n\n  But wait: the problem says that program1 is solving the store problem and program2 is solving the division problem. They are independent. How can the output of the store problem be the input of the division problem? \n\n  This seems to be a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps the problem is that we are to run both programs independently? But the pipe is there.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might mean that we run program1.py and then pipe its output to program2.py, and then the entire system should run? But the two problems are unrelated.\n\n  After re\u2010reading the problem: the two programs are provided as separate code snippets. The problem says to complete the missing lines in each. And then the command \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" should run correctly. \n\n  However, the input for program1 is:\n      n, q\n      list of n prices\n      q lines of (x, y)\n\n  The input for program2 is:\n      t\n      t lines of ratings\n\n  The output of program1 is q integers (one per line). Then if we pipe that to program2, then program2 would read the first integer as t, and then the next q integers as the ratings? But q might be different from t? And the ratings are in the range [-5000,5000] but the free sums are positive and can be large (up to 200000*10^6?).\n\n  This does not make sense.\n\n  But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\" and the output format is a json with the completions for program1 and program2.\n\n  I think the pipe is a red herring? Or perhaps the problem is that we are to run the two programs independently? The problem says \"runs correctly\" meaning that each program by itself is correct? But the pipe is specified.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might be that the output of program1 is the input for program2? Then we must design program1 to output the input that program2 expects? But that would be:\n\n      program1 must output: \n          first line: t (the number of test cases for program2)\n          then t lines: each line an integer (the rating)\n\n      and program2 must read that and output the division for each.\n\n  But the problem says that program1 is to solve the store problem. How can we change the store problem to output the input for the division problem? That doesn't make sense.\n\n  After re\u2010examining the problem: the two programs are independent. The pipe is a mistake? Or perhaps the problem intended to run the two programs independently? But the command is with a pipe.\n\n  I think there might be a misunderstanding. The problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\" meaning that when we run program1.py, it produces output that is then fed to program2.py, and the entire chain produces the correct output for the division problem? But then what about the store problem? It must be that the store problem is not used? \n\n  Alternatively, the problem might be that we are to run the division problem (program2) on the output of the store problem (program1) as a test? But that doesn't make sense.\n\n  I see the note: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and the output format is json with two keys.\n\n  Therefore, I will complete each program independently as per their own problem.\n\n  For program1.py: we do as above with the prefix array of length n+1.\n\n  For program2.py: we read t test cases, and for each rating, we output the division.\n\n  Then the pipe \"program1.py | program2.py\" might not be meaningful, but the problem says to output the missing code for both so that the pipe runs correctly. However, if we complete both programs correctly, then when run independently they are correct. The pipe might be a mistake? Or perhaps the problem intended to run the two programs independently? But the pipe is written.\n\n  Alternatively, the problem might mean that we run program1.py and then program2.py separately, and the pipe is a typo? \n\n  Given the confusion, I will complete each program as per their own problem.\n\n  For program1.py:\n\n      We'll do:\n          n, q = map(int, input().split())\n          arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          arr.sort(reverse=True)\n          prefix = [0] * (n+1)\n          for i in range(1, n+1):\n              prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n\n          for _ in range(q):\n              data = input().split()\n              if not data: \n                  continue\n              x = int(data[0])\n              y = int(data[1])\n              # We want the sum of the segment from (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array? \n              # But note: the prefix array we built: prefix[i] = sum of the first i elements (which are the top i in descending order).\n              # The free items are the last y of the top x, which are the segment from index (x-y) to (x-1) in the sorted array? \n              # Actually, the segment we want is the y items starting from the (x-y)th largest? \n              # How to get the sum? \n              #   total = prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]\n              result = prefix[x] - prefix[x-y]\n              print(result)\n\n  But note: the constraints: x and y can be up to 200000, and n up to 200000, so x<=n, and x-y>=0. So this is safe.\n\n  However, the current code in program1.py has:\n\n      n, q = [int(x) for x in input().split()]\n      prices = [int(price) for price in input().split(\" \")]\n      prices.sort(reverse=True)\n      for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n          prices[i] += prices[i-1]\n\n      while q:\n          # ... and then we are to fill in.\n\n  We cannot change the existing code arbitrarily? We are to fill in the missing lines.\n\n  The existing code builds a prefix array in-place in the 'prices' array. But it does not have a 0 at the beginning. And the length of prices is n. Then:\n\n      prices[0] = first element (largest)\n      prices[1] = largest + second largest\n      ...\n      prices[n-1] = total sum.\n\n  Then for a query (x,y):\n\n      We want the sum of the segment from (x-y) to (x-1). \n\n      With the current prefix array (without a leading 0), we can do:\n\n          if x-y-1 < 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n      But note: if x-y-1 is negative, we subtract nothing? Actually, we can do:\n\n          total_free = prices[x-1] - (prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1>=0 else 0)\n\n      But we cannot use an if in a print? We can do:\n\n          if x-y == 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n\n      However, what if x-y-1 is negative? Then we get an index error? Because x-y-1 is negative, so we cannot index.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      base = 0\n      if x-y-1 >= 0:\n          base = prices[x-y-1]\n      total_free = prices[x-1] - base\n\n  But note: the problem says the array is 0-indexed and we have n elements. x-y-1 might be negative? Then we use 0.\n\n  So we can write:\n\n      base = prices[x-y-1] if x-y-1 >= 0 else 0\n      total_free = prices[x-1] - base\n\n  But wait: what if x-y-1 is negative? Then we are subtracting 0, so total_free = prices[x-1]. That is correct when y=x? Because then we are taking the entire set of x items? Then the free items are the entire set? So the sum is the entire set? And that is prices[x-1] (the prefix sum for the first x items).\n\n  However, what if x-y-1 is negative? That happens when x-y-1 < 0, i.e., x-y < 1 -> y>=x? But we know y<=x, so the only possibility is y=x. Then we do total_free = prices[x-1] (which is the sum of the first x items). That is correct.\n\n  But note: what if x=1, y=1? Then x-y-1 = -1, so we use base=0, then total_free = prices[0] - 0 = prices[0] = the first element. Correct: we take one item and the free item is that one item.\n\n  Therefore, we can write in the while loop:\n\n      while q:\n          # Read the next query\n          data = input().split()\n          x = int(data[0])\n          y = int(data[1])\n          # If x-y-1 is negative, then we use 0 for the base, else use prices[x-y-1]\n          if x - y - 1 < 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n          print(total_free)\n          q -= 1\n\n  But note: the while loop condition is 'while q:'. We must decrement q.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n      for _ in range(q):\n          ... \n\n  But the existing code uses while q.\n\n  So we fill:\n\n      while q:\n          data = input().split()\n          x = int(data[0])\n          y = int(data[1])\n          # Calculate the free sum\n          if x - y - 1 >= 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]\n          print(total_free)\n          q -= 1\n\n  However, what if x is greater than the current length of prices? But note: x<=n, and we have n items. The array prices has n elements, indexed 0 to n-1. So if x = n, then we use prices[n-1]. But if x-y-1 might be n-y-1? And if n-y-1 is in the range [0, n-1]? Then it's safe.\n\n  But note: we built the prefix array for the entire array? Yes, we did for i in range(1, n): so the last element is the total sum.\n\n  However, what if n=1? Then the for loop does nothing? Then prices[0] is the only element. Then for a query (1,1): we do x=1, y=1 -> x-y-1 = -1 -> then we use total_free = prices[0] = the only element. Correct.\n\n  But if n=1, and we have a query (1,1), then we output prices[0]. Correct.\n\n  But what if we have a query with x=2? But x<=n, and n=1, so x cannot be 2. So safe.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the while loop is:\n\n      # Inside the while q: loop\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      # But note: the existing code uses split(\" \") and then converts? But the problem says the input has two integers per line.\n\n      However, the existing code in the while loop is not provided. We are to fill the TODO.\n\n      The TODO is in the while loop. We can write:\n\n          x, y = [int(a) for a in input().split()]\n          # Then compute the free sum as above.\n\n      But the problem says: Output only the missing code. So we must output the code that goes in the TODO.\n\n      The existing code has:\n\n          while q:\n              # 5 5 3 2 1\n              # 5 10 13 15 16\n              # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We replace the TODO with:\n\n          x, y = map(int, input().split())\n          if x - y - 1 < 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n          print(total_free)\n          q -= 1\n\n      But note: we must decrement q? The while loop condition is while q, so we must decrement q. Alternatively, we can use a for loop? But the existing code uses while q.\n\n      We can do:\n\n          x, y = map(int, input().split())\n          # Calculate the free sum\n          if x - y - 1 >= 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]\n          print(total_free)\n          q -= 1\n\n  However, the problem says the array is sorted in reverse (descending) and we built the prefix array in that order.\n\n  But note: the example in the note:\n\n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\"\n\n      How does that match?\n\n      Input: \n          n=5, q=3\n          prices = [5,5,3,2,1] -> sorted descending: [5,5,3,2,1]\n          Then build prefix: \n              index0: 5\n              index1: 5+5=10\n              index2: 10+3=13\n              index3: 13+2=15\n              index4: 15+1=16\n\n          Query: x=3, y=2 -> then we want the free sum = 8.\n\n          How do we compute?\n            x=3, y=2 -> x-y-1 = 0 -> so we do prices[2] (which is 13) - prices[0] (which is 5) = 8. Correct.\n\n          Query: x=2, y=1 -> then x-y-1 = 0? -> 2-1-1=0 -> so we do prices[1] (10) - prices[0] (5) = 5. Correct.\n\n          Query: x=5, y=3 -> then x-y-1 = 5-3-1=1 -> so we do prices[4] (16) - prices[1] (10) = 6. Correct.\n\n      So it matches.\n\n  Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      if x - y - 1 >= 0:\n          total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n      else:\n          total_free = prices[x-1]\n      print(total_free)\n      q -= 1\n\n  But note: we must decrement q? The while loop condition is while q, so we must decrement q to avoid an infinite loop.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use:\n\n      for i in range(q):\n          ... \n\n  But the existing code uses while q. So we must decrement.\n\n  Now for program2.py:\n\n  The code:\n\n      for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  This reads all lines from stdin and then takes from index1 to the end (skipping the first line). Then for each line (which is a string in n) we need to convert to integer and then determine the division.\n\n  The problem: \n      Division 1: rating >= 1900\n      Division 2: 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n      Division 3: 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n      Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\n  We can do:\n\n      rating = int(n.strip())\n      if rating >= 1900:\n          print(\"Division 1\")\n      elif rating >= 1600:   # and rating <= 1899, but since we check in order, it's between 1600 and 1899\n          print(\"Division 2\")\n      elif rating >= 1400:   # then between 1400 and 1599\n          print(\"Division 3\")\n      else:\n          print(\"Division 4\")\n\n  But note: the conditions are non-overlapping.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n      rating = int(n.strip())\n      if rating >= 1900:\n          print(\"Division 1\")\n      elif rating >= 1600:\n          print(\"Division 2\")\n      elif rating >= 1400:\n          print(\"Division 3\")\n      else:\n          print(\"Division 4\")\n\n  However, the problem says: the input rating can be from -5000 to 5000. The conditions cover all integers.\n\n  But note: the example: \n      -789 -> Division 4\n      1299 -> Division 4\n      1300 -> Division 4? Actually, 1300 is <=1399 -> Division 4.\n      1399 -> Division 4\n      1400 -> Division 3\n      1679 -> Division 2\n      2300 -> Division 1\n\n  So the code above matches.\n\n  Therefore, the json:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"x, y = map(int, input().split())\\nif x - y - 1 >= 0:\\n    total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\\nelse:\\n    total_free = prices[x-1]\\nprint(total_free)\\nq -= 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"rating = int(n.strip())\\nif rating >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program1 code must be indented properly? The existing while loop is:\n\n      while q:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with the block of code. So we must have the code indented.\n\n  However, the problem says: Output only the missing code. So we output the code that goes in the TODO, which is a block of code.\n\n  We write the code for program1 as a string that includes the necessary lines, with newlines and indentation.\n\n  Similarly for program2.\n\n  But note: the program2 code is a single line? Actually, the for loop is:\n\n      for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n          # TODO\n\n  We are to put the code in the loop.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n      program1: \n          x, y = map(int, input().split())\n          if x - y - 1 >= 0:\n              total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n          else:\n              total_free = prices[x-1]\n          print(total_free)\n          q -= 1\n\n      program2:\n          rating = int(n.strip())\n          if rating >= 1900:\n              print(\"Division 1\")\n          elif rating >= 1600:\n              print(\"Division 2\")\n          elif rating >= 1400:\n              print(\"Division 3\")\n          else:\n              print(\"Division 4\")\n\n  We output as a json string.\n\n  However, note: the program1 code must be exactly the lines that go in the while loop? And we must decrement q? The problem says the existing code has a while q: loop. So we must decrement q to avoid an infinite loop.\n\n  Alternatively, we could use a for loop? But the existing code uses while q. So we do q-=1.\n\n  But the problem says: the existing code has:\n\n      while q:\n\n  and then the TODO. So we must write the body of the loop.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program1 is:\n\n      x, y = map(int, input().split())\n      if x - y - 1 >= 0:\n          total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\n      else:\n          total_free = prices[x-1]\n      print(total_free)\n      q -= 1\n\n  But note: the example input has multiple queries, and we are reading one query per iteration.\n\n  We write the code as a string with newlines and proper indentation.\n\n  Similarly, for program2, the code is:\n\n      rating = int(n.strip())\n      if rating >= 1900:\n          print(\"Division 1\")\n      elif rating >= 1600:\n          print(\"Division 2\")\n      elif rating >= 1400:\n          print(\"Division 3\")\n      else:\n          print(\"Division 4\")\n\n  We output the json.\n\n  Important: we must escape the quotes? The problem says: output the missing code, not as markdown. And the output format is json. So we must format the string as a json object.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"x, y = map(int, input().split())\\nif x - y - 1 >= 0:\\n    total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\\nelse:\\n    total_free = prices[x-1]\\nprint(total_free)\\nq -= 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"rating = int(n.strip())\\nif rating >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program2 string has double quotes inside. We must escape them.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the print? But the problem says the output should be \"Division X\", so we use double quotes in the string.\n\n  We escape the double quotes in the json string.\n\n  Actually, we can use:\n\n      \"program2\": \"rating = int(n.strip())\\nif rating >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\n...\"\n\n  But the problem does not specify the exact format of the string, but we must output valid json.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use triple quotes? But the problem says output the missing code.\n\n  I think we should use the escaped double quotes.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"x, y = map(int, input().split())\\nif x - y - 1 >= 0:\\n    total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\\nelse:\\n    total_free = prices[x-1]\\nprint(total_free)\\nq -= 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"rating = int(n.strip())\\nif rating >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n      }\n\n  But wait: in program1, we are using the variable 'prices' which is defined outside. And we are using q and decrementing it. That is acceptable.\n\n  However, note: the program1 code has a comment at the beginning of the while loop:\n\n      # 5 5 3 2 1\n      # 5 10 13 15 16\n\n  We are not removing that? The problem says we are to fill in the TODO. We leave the comments and just replace the TODO with our code.\n\n  Therefore, the above.\n\n  Let me write the json string with proper escaping.\n\n  We can write:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"x, y = map(int, input().split())\\nif x - y - 1 >= 0:\\n    total_free = prices[x-1] - prices[x-y-1]\\nelse:\\n    total_free = prices[x-1]\\nprint(total_free)\\nq -= 1\",\n        \"program2\": \"rating = int(n.strip())\\nif rating >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif rating >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the program2 code uses the variable 'n' which is the loop variable. That is correct.\n\n  We output this json.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and we are outputting a json with two strings.\n\n  This matches the output format.\n\n  Therefore, we output the json."
