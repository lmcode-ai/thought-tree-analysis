And since i+j<=n, then i+j < n+1 is true. So condition is automatically satisfied if we only consider pairs with i+j<=n. However, when we store the left prefix, we stored for i from 1 to n. Then when we traverse the right, we start from j=0 to j=n-1. But note: if we take j from the right, we cannot take j=n because then we are taking the entire array? But then the left segment would have to be 0? Actually, we stored the left prefix for i=0? We didn't store 0? We should store the left prefix for i=0: left_sum=0 at i=0 (meaning no candy taken from the left). Similarly, we can have j=0 (no candy from the right).

If Bob takes two: [1,3]? But the candies are contiguous from the right? So Bob must take the last two: [3,1] -> sum=4. So the only match is 1 and 1 -> total=2. But what if we have two matches? Example: \n                w = [1,1,1,1] \n                total_sum=4, x=2. Left prefix: i0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                    i1: s=2 -> d[2]=2 -> then break? because 2<=2, so we store and then next: s=3>2 -> break. Then d = {1:1, 2:2} Right: \n                    reversed: [1,1,1,1]\n                    j0: s=1 -> in d: r = 0+1 + d[1] = 1+1 = 2.\n                    j1: s=2 -> in d: r = 1+1 + d[2] = 2+2 = 4 -> then we update r=4. j2: s=3 -> not in d? and then j3: s=4 -> not in d. Then output 4. But is 4 valid? Alice takes [1,1] (left two) -> sum=2, Bob takes [1,1] (right two) -> sum=2 -> valid. And total candies=4. So the code updates r to the last match, which in this case is the best. But note: the matches we get in the right loop: the j increases, so the total candies i+j = d[s] + (j+1) is increasing?",

Then output 6. But is 6 valid? The match for s=5: \n                    Left: d[5]=3 -> so Alice takes [1,3,1] -> sum=5. Right: j=2 (meaning two candies from the right? but note: j in the loop is the index, so we have taken j+1=3 candies? Actually, we have j=2 (index in the reversed array) meaning we have taken 3 candies? Actually, the reversed array: \n                        index0: 3 -> one candy\n                        index1: 3+1 -> two candies\n                        index2: 3+1+1 -> three candies -> but that's the last three: [3,1,1]? But the array: [1,3,1,1,1,1,3] -> the last three: [1,1,3] -> sum=5? Actually, the right segment: the last three: the last candy is 3, then the one before is 1, then the one before is 1? -> [1,1,3] -> sum=5. Then total candies: 3 (left) + 3 (right) = 6. And they are disjoint? Left: indices 0,1,2 -> [1,3,1] Right: indices 4,5,6? -> but the array has indices 0..6. The right segment: from the right: \n                            candy at index6: 3\n                            candy at index5: 1\n                            candy at index4: 1\n                        So the left segment ends at index2 and the right segment starts at index4 -> disjoint. So valid. But what if we have a match at j=1 (s=4) and then at j=2 (s=5)? The total for j=1: 2+2=4, for j=2: 3+3=6 -> so we update to 6. So the code updates r to the last match, which is the one with the largest j? But note: the j in the loop is increasing, and the total i+j = d[s] + (j+1) is not necessarily increasing? Because d[s] might be smaller for a larger j? \n\n          Example: \n            w = [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]   # n=6, total=9, x=4 Left prefix:\n                s0=2 -> d[2]=1\n                s1=3 -> d[3]=2\n                s2=4 -> d[4]=3 -> then break? because next: 4+1=5>4 -> break. d = {2:1, 3:2, 4:3} Right:\n                reversed: [3,1,1,1,1,2]\n                j0: s=3 -> in d? d[3]=2 -> r = 0+1 + 2 = 3.\n                j1: s=3+1=4 -> in d: r = 1+1 + d[4] = 2+3 = 5 -> update to 5.\n                j2: s=4 +1=5 -> not in d.\n                ... Then output 5. But is there a match with 5? Left: d[4]=3 -> [2,1,1] -> sum=4. Right: j1: two candies: [3,1] -> sum=4? Total candies: 3+2=5. But what about the first match: \n                Left: d[3]=2 -> [2,1] -> sum=3. Right: j0: one candy: [3] -> sum=3 -> total=3. Then we update to 5. So the code updates to the last match?

Or Alice: [1,100] -> sum=101, Bob: [1,100]? but Bob can only take from the right: the last two: [1,1] -> sum=2 -> not equal. Or Alice: [1] and Bob: [1,1] -> sum=1 vs 2 -> not equal.

Then total candies: 3+4=7. But the entire array is 7, so they are disjoint? Left: indices0,1,2 -> [1,1,2] -> ends at index2. Right: indices3,4,5,6 -> starts at index3 -> disjoint. So valid.

So we break after storing the first two. But note: we break in the iteration when s becomes >x. So we break after adding the third candy.

But what if we break early, we might miss a prefix sum that is <=x? Example: \n            w = [3, 1, 1]   # total=5, x=2 -> but wait, total=5, x=5//2=2 -> integer division: 2. i0: s=3 -> 3>2 -> break. Then we don't store any prefix sum?

Alice: nothing, Bob: [2] -> 0 vs 2 -> not equal. Alice: [2], Bob: nothing -> 2 vs 0 -> not equal. So no solution? then output 0.

So if we break, we break out of the loop and skip the store. So that's correct. Now, for program2.py:\n\n          The problem: \n            Given n, find four positive integers a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d). The provided code:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                ans = []\n                if n == 5:\n                    ans = [1, 2, 1, 1]\n                elif n % 4 == 0:\n                    ans = [n // 4] * 4 elif n % 2 == 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                else:\n                    a, c, d = 2, 2, 1\n                    b = n - a - c - d\n                    ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          We need to complete the TODO for even n that is not divisible by 4. The examples:\n\n            n=7: \n                provided: [2,2,2,1] -> 2+2+2+1=7, and gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> valid. n=8: \n                divisible by 4: [2,2,2,2] -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> valid.\n\n            n=9: \n                else: [2, 4, 2, 1] -> 2+4+2+ 1=9, gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> valid. n=10: \n                else: [2, 6, 1, 1] -> 2+6+1+1=10, gcd(2,6)=2, lcm(1,1)=1 -> not equal. But the example says: \n            \"In the fifth test case gcd(3,5)=lcm(1,1)=1, 3+5+1+1=10\"\n\n          So the provided else branch does not work for n=10. The code has a special case for n=5: [1,2,1,1] -> 1+2+1+1=5, gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> valid. For the even n that is not divisible by 4: that is n % 2==0 and n % 4 ! =0 -> so n mod 4 = 2. Examples: n=6,10,14,... The example for n=10: the answer is [3,5,1,1] -> 3+5+1+1=10, gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1. How to generalize? We note that we want gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). Let k = gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d). We can try to set k=1. Then we require:\n            gcd(a,b)=1 and lcm(c,d)=1. lcm(c,d)=1 implies that c=1 and d=1. Then we have a+b+1+1 = n -> a+b = n-2. And we require gcd(a,b)=1.",

Actually, the condition: \n            if n==5: ...\n            elif n%4==0: ...\n            elif n%2==0: ... # even but not divisible by 4\n            else: ...           # odd\n\n          The example for n=5: [1,2,1,1] -> 1+2+1+1=5, gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1. For n=7: the example uses [2,2,2,1] -> but 7 is odd? Then it would go to the else branch? The else branch for n=7: \n            a=2, c=2, d=1 -> then b=7-2-2-1=2 -> [2,2,2,1] -> which is the example. For n=9: [2,4,2,1] -> as above. For n=11: \n            a=2, c=2, d=1 -> b=11-2-2-1=6 -> [2,6,2,1] -> \n            gcd(2,6)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> valid. But what if we have n=3? but n>=4. However, what if n=1? not possible. But the problem says n>=4. But what if n=10? The code for n=10: even and not divisible by 4 -> so we are in the TODO branch.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends and we want the maximum total number of candies eaten such that the total weight eaten by both is equal.\n\n Approach for program1.py:\n We are guaranteed that the total sum of n over test cases is <= 200,000, so we can do O(n) per test case.\n\n The idea is to use two pointers or prefix sums. However, note the note: \n   \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2.\"\n\n We are to compute the maximum total number of candies (i.e., the count) such that the sum of the left segment (Alice) equals the sum of the right segment (Bob).\n\n Steps:\n   We can precompute the prefix sums from the left and the prefix sums from the right.\n   But note: the problem says that Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot skip.\n\n   We are going to try to find pairs (i, j) such that:\n        i is the number of candies from the left (so indices 0 to i-1) and j is the number of candies from the right (so indices n-j to n-1) and i+j <= n (and the segments do not overlap).\n\n   We require that the sum of the left segment (w0 + w1 + ... + w_{i-1}) equals the sum of the right segment (w_{n-j} + ... + w_{n-1}).\n\n   And we want to maximize the total candies eaten: i+j.\n\n   However, note the constraint: the total n over test cases is <= 200,000, but the individual n can be up to 200,000 and t up to 10,000. But the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000\", so we can iterate per test case appropriately.\n\n   We can do:\n        Let left_sum[0] = 0, then for i in range(1, n+1): left_sum[i] = left_sum[i-1] + a[i-1]\n        Similarly, right_sum[0] = 0, then for j in range(1, n+1): right_sum[j] = right_sum[j-1] + a[n-j]\n\n   Then we want to find i and j (with i>=0, j>=0, i+j<=n) such that left_sum[i] = right_sum[j] and then maximize i+j.\n\n   But note: we cannot have overlapping, so we require i <= n - j (so the segments don't meet). Actually, the condition is i <= n - j, meaning the left segment and the right segment are disjoint.\n\n   However, iterating i and j would be O(n^2) which is too slow (n up to 200,000).\n\n   Alternate approach: \n        We can use a dictionary to record the prefix sums from the left and then traverse the right prefix sums and check if that sum exists in the left. But note: we require that the left segment and the right segment do not overlap. So when we are at a left segment of length i and a right segment of length j, we require i+j <= n and the left segment is [0, i-1] and the right segment is [n-j, n-1]. The condition for non-overlap is i <= n - j, which is equivalent to i+j <= n.\n\n   Actually, the condition is automatically satisfied if we take the left prefix and the right prefix because the left prefix is from the start and the right prefix is from the end, and as long as the left index i-1 is strictly less than n-j, then they don't overlap. But note: the entire array might be covered? Actually, the problem says they can't eat the same candy. So we require that the left segment and the right segment are disjoint.\n\n   We can do:\n        Let d be a dictionary that maps a prefix sum (from the left) to the maximum index (i.e., the number of candies) for which we have that sum. But note: we want the maximum number of candies? Actually, we want the maximum i for a given sum? But then when we traverse the right, we want to know for a given right sum s, if we have seen that s from the left, then the total candies would be i + j (where j is the number of candies from the right). And we want to maximize i+j over all such pairs.\n\n   However, note: we can break early? Also, we don't need to record every prefix? But note the constraint: the total n is 200,000, so we can do one pass from the left and one from the right.\n\n   Steps for one test case:\n        n = ... and list w of n integers.\n        Let left_sum = 0\n        Let d = {}   # mapping: prefix_sum -> the number of candies (i) that gives that prefix (we want the first time we get that sum? Actually, we want the maximum i? But note: if we have the same sum appearing again, we don't need to update because we want the maximum i? Actually, we want the maximum i for a given sum? But note: if we have the same sum, we want the largest i? Actually, no: we want the largest i? But when we combine with the right, we are going to add j. Actually, we want to maximize i+j. So if we have the same sum, we want the largest i? Because then when we have a right segment of j, we get i+j. So we can record the first time we get a sum? Actually, we want the maximum i for a given sum? But note: if we get the same sum again at a larger i, then we can update because a larger i is better.\n\n        However, note: the prefix sums are increasing? Yes, because weights are positive. So the prefix sums are strictly increasing? Actually, weights are positive, so the prefix sums are strictly increasing. Therefore, each prefix sum appears only once. So we can just record the prefix sum and the index (which is the count i) at which we get that sum.\n\n        But note: we are going to traverse the right and we want to check if the current right sum is in the left dictionary. And then update the answer.\n\n        However, we must ensure that the segments do not overlap: i <= n - j. Since we are traversing the left and then the right, we can break when i > n - j? Actually, we can do:\n\n        We traverse the left until we have covered at most the first n/2? Actually, we can break when the left prefix sum exceeds half of the total? Because if the left prefix sum is already more than half, then we cannot have a matching right segment? But note: the total sum might be odd, and also the segments might not cover the entire array. Actually, we don't know the total? But note: the condition for non-overlap: when we are taking j from the right, the left segment must not extend beyond the right segment. So we require that the left segment ends before the right segment starts: i <= n - j.\n\n        How to enforce? We can do:\n\n          Let total = sum(w)   # but note: we don't need the total necessarily.\n\n          We traverse the left until we have i from 0 to n, and similarly the right from 0 to n. But we cannot have i and j such that i+j>n.\n\n        Alternate: we can break the left prefix when the current left index i is such that i >= n - j_min? Actually, we don't know j.\n\n        Instead, we can do:\n\n          We'll compute the left prefix sums and store in a dictionary the sum and the index (i). Then we traverse the right from 0 to n, and for each j (number of candies from the right) we compute the current right sum. Then we check if that sum is in the dictionary. But we must also check that the left segment for that sum (which we stored as i) satisfies i <= n - j. Then we update the answer: ans = max(ans, i+j).\n\n        However, the total n is 200,000 and we are doing a loop for j from 0 to n, and each dictionary lookup is O(1). So total O(n) per test case. But note: the total n over test cases is 200,000, so we can do O(n) per test case? Actually, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000\", so we can do one pass per test case.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the sum of n over all test cases\" meaning the total number of candies in all test cases is <= 200,000. So we can do:\n\n          for each test case:\n            n = ... (the number of candies in this test case)\n            w = list of n integers\n\n            total = sum(w)   # we might not need it, but for breaking condition? Actually, we can break the right when the right sum becomes too large? \n\n            We can break the right when the right sum exceeds the maximum left sum we have? But note: we stored all left prefix sums. We can break the right when the current right sum becomes greater than the maximum left prefix we have? But the maximum left prefix we have is the entire left array? Actually, we stored all left prefix sums from 0 to the entire array. But we don't want to go beyond the non-overlap condition.\n\n        Actually, we can break the right when the current right sum is already greater than the total/2? But note: the left prefix sums are increasing and the right prefix sums are increasing. So we can break when the right sum becomes greater than the maximum left prefix that we have? But we don't know the maximum left prefix? We can break when the right sum becomes greater than the total of the left array? Actually, we can break when the right sum becomes greater than the total of the entire array? That doesn't help.\n\n        Alternatively, we can break the right when the number of candies from the right is such that n - j <= i_min? Actually, we don't know.\n\n        Since the total n per test case can be up to 200,000 and the total over test cases is 200,000, we can do a loop for j from 0 to n, but note: the worst-case n per test case might be 200,000 and the total n over test cases is 200,000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=200,000. Then we do two loops (one for left and one for right) which is O(n). So acceptable.\n\n        Steps for one test case:\n\n          left_sum = 0\n          d = {}   # mapping: left_sum -> i (the number of candies from the left that gives that sum)\n          for i in range(0, n):   # i: from 0 to n-1, then we have taken i+1 candies? Actually, we start with 0 candies: left_sum=0 at i=0 (meaning 0 candies). Then we add w0, then we have 1 candy, etc.\n            left_sum += w[i]\n            d[left_sum] = i+1   # because we have taken i+1 candies\n\n          But note: we must not consider the entire array? Actually, we can only take up to the point that leaves room for the right. However, we are storing all left prefix sums. Then we traverse the right:\n\n          right_sum = 0\n          ans = 0\n          for j in range(0, n):   # j: from 0 to n-1, meaning we take j+1 candies from the right\n            # we are going to take the j-th candy from the right: index = n-1-j\n            right_sum += w[n-1-j]\n\n            # Check if this right_sum is in d and also that the left segment (which has length = d[right_sum]) and the right segment (which has length = j+1) do not overlap: d[right_sum] <= n - (j+1)  [because the left segment ends at index d[right_sum]-1, and the right segment starts at n - (j+1) (if we take j+1 from the right, then the first candy of the right segment is at index n - (j+1) and the last at n-1). We require that the left segment ends at index d[right_sum]-1 < n - (j+1). Actually, we require that the left segment does not include any candy that the right segment includes. So the left segment must end at an index < n - j - 1? Actually, the left segment ends at i-1 (if we have i candies) and the right segment starts at n - j. We require i-1 < n - j, i.e., i+j < n. But note: the problem does not require that they leave some candies? Actually, they can leave some in the middle. The condition is that the candies they eat are disjoint. So we require that the left segment and the right segment do not share any candy. The left segment is [0, i-1] and the right segment is [n-j, n-1]. They are disjoint if i-1 < n-j. So we require i <= n - j - 1? Actually, i-1 < n-j  => i+j < n+1. But we are storing i as the count (so the last index of the left segment is i-1). So condition: i + j <= n? Actually, if i+j == n, then the left segment ends at i-1 and the right segment starts at n - j = n - (n-i) = i. So they are adjacent? Then they are disjoint. So condition is i+j <= n? Actually, the condition is that the left segment and the right segment do not share any candy. The left segment has indices [0, i-1] and the right segment has indices [n-j, n-1]. They are disjoint if i-1 < n-j. This is equivalent to i+j < n+1, which is always true if i and j are at least 1? Actually, if i+j <= n, then the segments are disjoint? \n\n          Example: n=4, i=2, j=2: then left segment: [0,1] and right segment: [2,3] -> disjoint. So condition: i+j <= n.\n\n          But note: in the dictionary we stored the left prefix for i (which is the count) and we are adding j (the count from the right). So we require that the total count i+j <= n? Actually, yes. But note: the entire array has n candies. So if we take i from the left and j from the right, we are taking i+j candies, and we require that i+j <= n. And the condition for non-overlap is automatically satisfied if i+j <= n? Actually, the left segment ends at i-1 and the right segment starts at n-j. We require i-1 < n-j, which is equivalent to i+j < n+1, which is always true if i and j are integers? Actually, i+j <= n implies i-1 < n-j? \n            i-1 < n-j  => i+j < n+1. And since i+j<=n, then i+j < n+1 is true. So condition is automatically satisfied if we only consider pairs with i+j<=n.\n\n          However, when we store the left prefix, we stored for i from 1 to n. Then when we traverse the right, we start from j=0 to j=n-1. But note: if we take j from the right, we cannot take j=n because then we are taking the entire array? But then the left segment would have to be 0? Actually, we stored the left prefix for i=0? We didn't store 0? \n\n          We should store the left prefix for i=0: left_sum=0 at i=0 (meaning no candy taken from the left). Similarly, we can have j=0 (no candy from the right). Then if we have left_sum=0 and right_sum=0, then we get 0+0=0, which is not useful. But we can store d[0]=0.\n\n          So we do:\n            d = {0:0}   # at the beginning, 0 candies from the left gives 0.\n            left_sum = 0\n            for i in range(0, n):\n                left_sum += w[i]\n                d[left_sum] = i+1   # because we have taken i+1 candies\n\n          Then for the right:\n            right_sum = 0\n            ans = 0\n            # we start with j=0: no candy from the right -> right_sum=0 -> then we check d: d[0]=0 -> then total candies = 0+0=0 -> but that's not useful, but it's acceptable.\n\n            for j in range(0, n):\n                right_sum += w[n-1-j]\n                if right_sum in d:\n                    i_count = d[right_sum]\n                    if i_count + (j+1) <= n:   # because we are taking j+1 candies from the right\n                        # update the answer: we want the maximum total candies\n                        if i_count + (j+1) > ans:\n                            ans = i_count + j+1\n\n            Then print(ans)\n\n          But note: we are iterating j from 0 to n-1, so j+1 from the right. And we break condition? Actually, we don't break, we just check all.\n\n          However, we can break early? Since the right_sum is increasing, and the left_sum is increasing, once the right_sum becomes greater than the maximum left_sum we have, we can break? But the maximum left_sum is the entire left array? Actually, we stored all left prefix sums. So if the current right_sum is already greater than the maximum left_sum, then we can break? But note: the maximum left_sum is the entire array? Actually, we stored the entire left array? But we stored the entire left array? Then the maximum left_sum is the total of the entire array? Then if the right_sum becomes greater than the total, we break? But the total of the entire array is fixed. Actually, the right_sum is the sum of the last j+1 candies, and the entire array has a total T. So if the right_sum becomes greater than T, that's impossible? Actually, the weights are positive, so the right_sum is increasing. But note: the entire array has total T, so the right_sum cannot exceed T. So we don't break on that.\n\n          However, we can break when j+1 > n - i_min? Actually, we don't know.\n\n          Alternatively, we can note that the condition i_count + (j+1) <= n must hold. But we are storing i_count for a given left_sum. And we are iterating j from 0 to n-1. The condition i_count + (j+1) <= n is equivalent to i_count <= n - (j+1). So for a fixed j, we require that the stored i_count for the current right_sum is at most n - j - 1. But we stored the entire dictionary. We are checking for existence. We cannot avoid that.\n\n          But note: we can break when j+1 is already so large that even the smallest i_count (which is 0) would make 0 + (j+1) <= n, which is always true? Actually, j+1 <= n. So we don't break.\n\n          However, we can break when the current right_sum is already greater than the maximum left_sum we have? Because then we won't find a match. Since the left_sum are stored and the right_sum is increasing, we can break when right_sum > max_key? \n\n          Let max_left = max(d.keys())   # but this is O(n) and we are in a loop, so total O(n^2). We don't want that.\n\n          Alternatively, we can precompute max_left = left_sum (which is the entire array) and then break when right_sum > max_left? That would be safe.\n\n          So:\n\n            max_left = left_sum   # because after the loop, left_sum is the entire left array\n            right_sum = 0\n            ans = 0\n            for j in range(0, n):\n                if right_sum > max_left:\n                    break\n                right_sum += w[n-1-j]\n                if right_sum in d:\n                    i_count = d[right_sum]\n                    if i_count + (j+1) <= n:\n                        if i_count + j+1 > ans:\n                            ans = i_count + j+1\n\n          But note: we break when right_sum > max_left, but what if we have a match at a right_sum that is less than or equal to max_left? Then we don't break. So this is safe.\n\n          However, what if the right_sum becomes greater than max_left? Then we break because we won't find a match (since the left_sum we stored are all <= max_left).\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so worst-case one test case with n=200,000, and we do two loops (each O(n)) so total O(2*n) which is acceptable.\n\n        However, the provided code in the problem has a different approach:\n\n          We see in the provided code:\n\n            x = sum(a) // 2\n            s, d = 0, {}\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n                d[s] = idx + 1\n\n          Then:\n\n            s, r = 0, 0\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n                s += i\n                if s in d: r = idx + 1 + d[s]\n\n          And then print(r)\n\n        How does this work?\n\n          They set x = total_sum//2. Why? Because the sum that Alice and Bob each get must be at most total_sum//2? Actually, they are going to have the same sum, so the total sum they both get is 2*s, which must be <= total_sum. So s <= total_sum//2.\n\n          Then in the left loop, they break when s > x? But note: if s becomes greater than total_sum//2, then we cannot have a matching right segment that equals s? Because the right segment would have to be s, and then the total would be 2*s > total_sum, which is impossible. So we break early? \n\n          But note: what if the entire array is taken? Then we break at the first candy? Actually, no: we break when the current prefix becomes > total_sum//2. But the entire array is taken: then the left prefix becomes total_sum, which is > total_sum//2 (unless total_sum==0, but weights are positive). So we break at the first candy? Actually, we break when the prefix becomes > total_sum//2. \n\n          However, we might have a prefix that is exactly total_sum//2? Then we don't break. So we store that.\n\n          Then they traverse the right and for each suffix sum s, if s is in the dictionary (which only contains left prefix sums that are <= total_sum//2), then we update r = idx+1 + d[s]. And they take the last such update? But note: we want the maximum total candies. And the dictionary d stores the left prefix sum and the number of candies (the index). But when we traverse the right, we are going from the last candy backwards. And we update r to the current one? But note: we are traversing the entire right? And we update r to the last one that matches? But we want the maximum total candies. However, if we have two matches, which one gives the maximum? The one with the largest i+j? \n\n          Actually, the left prefix sums are stored for the entire left (until we break). And the right suffix sums are increasing. So the first time we get a match in the right (which is the smallest j) might not be the best? Actually, we are traversing the right from the last candy backwards (so the first j in the loop is 1 candy, then 2, ...). And we update r to the current one. But we want the maximum i+j. So we should take the maximum over the matches.\n\n          However, the code does:\n\n            r = idx+1 + d[s]\n\n          and then at the end prints r. But note: we are updating r every time we see a match. So the last match we see (which is the largest j) might not be the best? Actually, j is increasing as we go? \n\n          How are we traversing the right? \n\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):   # so the first element in the reversed array is the last candy, then the second last, etc.\n\n            s += i   # so s is the suffix sum starting from the last candy and moving left.\n\n            Then we check if s is in d. \n\n          But note: the left prefix sums we stored are only for sums <= total_sum//2. And the right suffix sums we are computing: when we start, we have the last candy, then last two, etc. The suffix sums are increasing. \n\n          Now, if we have a match at a small j (meaning a small number of candies from the right) and then a match at a larger j, then the total candies (i+j) for the larger j might be larger? Because j is larger? But note: the left segment for the same sum s? Actually, the same s? Then the left segment must be the same? But the dictionary d maps a sum to the number of candies. And we stored the last occurrence? Actually, we stored the last index (the largest i) for that sum? But the prefix sums are increasing, so each sum appears only once. So for a given s, we have a fixed i. Then the total candies is i + j. And j is the number of candies from the right that gives the same sum s. \n\n          But note: as j increases (meaning we take more candies from the right), the sum s increases. So if we have two different matches, they are for different s. \n\n          Actually, the code updates r to the last match? But we want the maximum i+j. So we should take the maximum over the matches.\n\n          The current code does:\n\n            if s in d: r = idx+1 + d[s]\n\n          So the last match (the one with the largest j) might have a larger j, but the i might be smaller? Actually, no: the same s? But the same s: then the left segment for that s is fixed (because we stored the last occurrence? Actually, we stored the first time we get that s? No: we stored the last time? Actually, we do:\n\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: \n                    # break? The code has a TODO here. \n                d[s] = idx+1\n\n          We break when s > x? Then we stop. And we store the last s that is <=x. And for a given s, we store the last index we got that s? Actually, we store the index when we first get that s? Because the prefix sums are increasing, we get each s only once. So we store the index at which we get that s. And that index is the smallest i that gives that s? Actually, it's the only i. \n\n          Then when we traverse the right, we get a suffix sum s. Then we check if that s is in the dictionary. Then we set r = (idx+1) + d[s]. But note: we are updating r every time we see a match. And we traverse the right from the last candy to the first. So the first match we see (the smallest j) will have the smallest j? Actually, the first element in the reversed array is the last candy: so j=1. Then j=2, etc. So we are going from j=1 to j=n. And we update r to the last match we see? But we want the maximum i+j. So we should take the maximum over the matches.\n\n          The current code only stores the last match. So if we have multiple matches, we only remember the last one. That might not be the maximum? \n\n          Example: \n            n=4, w = [1,2,3,1]\n            total_sum = 7, x=3\n            Left prefix: \n                i=0: s=1 -> store d[1]=1\n                i=1: s=1+2=3 -> store d[3]=2\n                i=2: s=6 -> break because 6>3? \n            Then d = {1:1, 3:2}\n            Then traverse the right:\n                reversed array: [1,3,2,1]\n                j=0: s=1 -> check: 1 in d -> then r = 0+1 + d[1] = 1+1 = 2.\n                j=1: s=1+3=4 -> not in d.\n                j=2: s=4+2=6 -> break? because 6>3? but we don't break in the right loop? Actually, the code doesn't break in the right loop. But 6 is not in d? \n                j=3: s=6+1=7 -> not in d.\n\n            Then we output r=2.\n\n            But what is the answer? \n                We can have: \n                  Alice takes [1,2] -> sum=3, Bob takes [1] (from the right) -> sum=1 -> not equal.\n                  Alice takes [1] -> sum=1, Bob takes [1] -> sum=1 -> total candies=2 -> that's the match we found.\n                  But also: Alice takes [1,2] -> sum=3, Bob takes [3,1] -> but wait, Bob takes from the right: the last two: [1,3]? Actually, the last two are [3,1]? But the array is [1,2,3,1]. Bob takes the last two: [3,1] -> sum=4 -> not equal.\n                  Or Bob takes the last one: [1] -> sum=1 -> not 3.\n                  Or Bob takes the last two: [1,3] -> but the last two in the array are [3,1]? Actually, the array is [1,2,3,1]. The right segment: if Bob takes one: [1] (last candy). If Bob takes two: [1,3]? But the candies are contiguous from the right? So Bob must take the last two: [3,1] -> sum=4.\n\n            So the only match is 1 and 1 -> total=2.\n\n          But what if we have two matches? \n            Example: \n                w = [1,1,1,1] \n                total_sum=4, x=2.\n                Left prefix: \n                    i0: s=1 -> d[1]=1\n                    i1: s=2 -> d[2]=2 -> then break? because 2<=2, so we store and then next: s=3>2 -> break.\n                Then d = {1:1, 2:2}\n                Right: \n                    reversed: [1,1,1,1]\n                    j0: s=1 -> in d: r = 0+1 + d[1] = 1+1 = 2.\n                    j1: s=2 -> in d: r = 1+1 + d[2] = 2+2 = 4 -> then we update r=4.\n                    j2: s=3 -> not in d? and then j3: s=4 -> not in d.\n                Then output 4.\n\n            But is 4 valid? \n                Alice takes [1,1] (left two) -> sum=2, Bob takes [1,1] (right two) -> sum=2 -> valid. And total candies=4.\n\n          So the code updates r to the last match, which in this case is the best. But note: the matches we get in the right loop: the j increases, so the total candies i+j = d[s] + (j+1) is increasing? Not necessarily: because for a fixed s, the left segment is fixed (d[s] is fixed) and j increases? But the same s? Actually, the same s? But the s in the right loop is the suffix sum. And we are matching with the same s in the left. But as j increases, the suffix sum s increases. So we are matching different s. \n\n          Actually, the matches are for the same s. But note: the left prefix s and the right suffix s must be the same. And the left prefix s we stored are for the entire left until we break. And the right suffix s we are computing. \n\n          The total candies for a match is i+j = d[s] + (j+1). And we update r to the last match we see? But we want the maximum i+j. So we should take the maximum over the matches. The current code only remembers the last match. But the last match might not be the one with the maximum i+j? \n\n          Example: \n            w = [1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]   # n=7, total=11, x=5\n            We want to see if we can get a match with a larger total.\n\n            Left prefix: \n                s0=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s1=1+3=4 -> d[4]=2\n                s2=5 -> d[5]=3 -> then next: 5+1=6>5 -> break.\n\n            Then d = {1:1, 4:2, 5:3}\n\n            Right: \n                reversed: [3,1,1,1,1,3,1]\n                j0: s=3 -> not in d -> r unchanged (r=0)\n                j1: s=3+1=4 -> in d: r = 1+1 + d[4] = 2+2 = 4 -> update r=4.\n                j2: s=4+1=5 -> in d: r = 2+1 + d[5] = 3+3 = 6 -> update r=6.\n                j3: s=5+1=6 -> not in d? \n                ... until the end.\n\n            Then output 6.\n\n            But is 6 valid? \n                The match for s=5: \n                    Left: d[5]=3 -> so Alice takes [1,3,1] -> sum=5.\n                    Right: j=2 (meaning two candies from the right? but note: j in the loop is the index, so we have taken j+1=3 candies? Actually, we have j=2 (index in the reversed array) meaning we have taken 3 candies? Actually, the reversed array: \n                        index0: 3 -> one candy\n                        index1: 3+1 -> two candies\n                        index2: 3+1+1 -> three candies -> but that's the last three: [3,1,1]? \n                    But the array: [1,3,1,1,1,1,3] -> the last three: [1,1,3] -> sum=5? \n                    Actually, the right segment: the last three: the last candy is 3, then the one before is 1, then the one before is 1? -> [1,1,3] -> sum=5. \n                    Then total candies: 3 (left) + 3 (right) = 6. And they are disjoint? \n                        Left: indices 0,1,2 -> [1,3,1]\n                        Right: indices 4,5,6? -> but the array has indices 0..6. The right segment: from the right: \n                            candy at index6: 3\n                            candy at index5: 1\n                            candy at index4: 1\n                        So the left segment ends at index2 and the right segment starts at index4 -> disjoint. \n                    So valid.\n\n            But what if we have a match at j=1 (s=4) and then at j=2 (s=5)? The total for j=1: 2+2=4, for j=2: 3+3=6 -> so we update to 6. \n\n          So the code updates r to the last match, which is the one with the largest j? But note: the j in the loop is increasing, and the total i+j = d[s] + (j+1) is not necessarily increasing? Because d[s] might be smaller for a larger j? \n\n          Example: \n            w = [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]   # n=6, total=9, x=4\n            Left prefix:\n                s0=2 -> d[2]=1\n                s1=3 -> d[3]=2\n                s2=4 -> d[4]=3 -> then break? because next: 4+1=5>4 -> break.\n            d = {2:1, 3:2, 4:3}\n            Right:\n                reversed: [3,1,1,1,1,2]\n                j0: s=3 -> in d? d[3]=2 -> r = 0+1 + 2 = 3.\n                j1: s=3+1=4 -> in d: r = 1+1 + d[4] = 2+3 = 5 -> update to 5.\n                j2: s=4+1=5 -> not in d.\n                ... \n            Then output 5.\n\n            But is there a match with 5? \n                Left: d[4]=3 -> [2,1,1] -> sum=4.\n                Right: j1: two candies: [3,1] -> sum=4? \n                Total candies: 3+2=5.\n\n            But what about the first match: \n                Left: d[3]=2 -> [2,1] -> sum=3.\n                Right: j0: one candy: [3] -> sum=3 -> total=3. \n            Then we update to 5.\n\n          So the code updates to the last match? But we want the maximum total candies. And 5>3, so we want 5. \n\n          However, what if we have a match that is not the last one that is larger? \n\n          Example: \n            w = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]   # n=7, total=8, x=4.\n            Left prefix:\n                s0=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s1=2 -> d[2]=2\n                s2=4 -> d[4]=3 -> break.\n            Then d = {1:1, 2:2, 4:3}\n            Right:\n                reversed: [1,1,1,1,2,1,1] -> actually, the array is [1,1,2,1,1,1,1] -> reversed: [1,1,1,1,2,1,1] -> \n                j0: s=1 -> in d: r = 1 (from left) + 1 (from right) = 2 -> r=2.\n                j1: s=1+1=2 -> in d: r = 2 (from left) + 2 (from right) = 4 -> update to 4.\n                j2: s=2+1=3 -> not in d.\n                j3: s=3+1=4 -> in d: r = 3 (from left) + 4 (from right? j3: we have taken 4 candies? j=3 -> j+1=4) -> 3+4=7? \n                    But wait: the left segment: d[4]=3 -> [1,1,2] -> sum=4.\n                    The right segment: the last 4: [1,1,1,1] -> sum=4? \n                    But the array: [1,1,2,1,1,1,1] -> the last 4: indices 3,4,5,6: [1,1,1,1] -> sum=4.\n                    Then total candies: 3+4=7. \n                    But the entire array is 7, so they are disjoint? \n                        Left: indices0,1,2 -> [1,1,2] -> ends at index2.\n                        Right: indices3,4,5,6 -> starts at index3 -> disjoint.\n                    So valid.\n\n            Then we update to 7.\n\n          So the code updates to the last match, which is the one with the largest j? and that gives the largest total? \n\n          Why? Because as j increases, the total i+j = d[s] + (j+1) is increasing? Not necessarily: d[s] might be decreasing? But note: the same s? Actually, the same s? But the s in the right loop is increasing. And the left prefix sums we stored are increasing. So for a larger j, we get a larger s. And the d[s] for a larger s might be larger? \n\n          However, in the example above: \n            s=1 -> d[s]=1 -> total=1+1=2.\n            s=2 -> d[s]=2 -> total=2+2=4.\n            s=4 -> d[s]=3 -> total=3+4=7.\n\n          So the total is increasing? \n\n          Actually, the total = d[s] + (j+1). And j+1 is the number of candies from the right. And s is the suffix sum. And the suffix sum is increasing with j. And the left prefix sum for the same s is fixed. But note: the same s? We are matching the same s. But the j for a given s is fixed? Actually, for a given s, we have one j? \n\n          But note: the suffix sum s is computed for the last j+1 candies. And we are iterating j from 0 to n-1. So for each j, we get a suffix sum s_j. Then we check if s_j is in the dictionary. Then we compute the total = d[s_j] + (j+1). \n\n          And we update r to the last match? Actually, we update r to the current match. So we are storing the last match we see? But we want the maximum total. So we should do:\n\n            r = max(r, d[s] + j+1)\n\n          But the current code does:\n\n            if s in d: r = idx+1 + d[s]\n\n          So we are updating r to the current one. Then the last match (the one with the largest j) might not be the one with the largest total? \n\n          Example: \n            w = [1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1]   # n=7, total=9, x=4 -> but wait, total=9, so x=4? Actually, x = total//2 = 4 (integer division). \n            Left prefix:\n                s0=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s1=2 -> d[2]=2\n                s2=3 -> d[3]=3 -> then next: 3+3=6>4 -> break.\n            d = {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}\n            Right:\n                reversed: [1,1,1,3,1,1,1] -> \n                j0: s=1 -> in d: total = 1+1 = 2 -> r=2.\n                j1: s=1+1=2 -> in d: total = 2+2=4 -> r=4.\n                j2: s=2+1=3 -> in d: total = 3+3=6 -> r=6.\n                j3: s=3+3=6 -> not in d? \n                ... \n            Then output 6.\n\n            But what if we have a match at j0: total=2, j1: total=4, j2: total=6 -> the last match is 6, which is the maximum.\n\n          Now, what if we have:\n            w = [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]   # n=7, total=9, x=4.\n            Left prefix:\n                s0=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s1=1+2=3 -> d[3]=2\n                s2=3+1=4 -> d[4]=3 -> break.\n            d = {1:1, 3:2, 4:3}\n            Right:\n                reversed: [2,1,1,1,1,2,1] -> \n                j0: s=2 -> not in d.\n                j1: s=2+1=3 -> in d: total = 2 (from left) + 2 (from right) = 4 -> r=4.\n                j2: s=3+1=4 -> in d: total = 3 (from left) + 3 (from right) = 6 -> r=6.\n                j3: s=4+1=5 -> not in d.\n                j4: s=5+1=6 -> not in d.\n                j5: s=6+2=8 -> not in d.\n                j6: s=8+1=9 -> not in d.\n\n            Then output 6.\n\n          But what if we have a match at j1: total=4 and j2: total=6 -> we update to 6.\n\n          However, what if we have a match at a larger j that gives a smaller total? \n            Example: \n                w = [3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]   # n=7, total=11, x=5.\n            Left prefix:\n                s0=3 -> d[3]=1\n                s1=4 -> d[4]=2\n                s2=5 -> d[5]=3 -> break.\n            d = {3:1,4:2,5:3}\n            Right:\n                reversed: [3,1,1,1,1,1,3] -> \n                j0: s=3 -> in d: total = 1+1=2 -> r=2.\n                j1: s=3+1=4 -> in d: total = 2+2=4 -> r=4.\n                j2: s=4+1=5 -> in d: total = 3+3=6 -> r=6.\n                j3: s=5+1=6 -> not in d.\n                j4: s=6+1=7 -> not in d.\n                j5: s=7+1=8 -> not in d.\n                j6: s=8+3=11 -> not in d.\n\n            Then output 6.\n\n          But what if we have a match at j0: total=2, j1: total=4, j2: total=6 -> we update to 6.\n\n          However, what if we have a match at j0: total=2, then j1: total=4, then j2: total=6, then j3: ... but then we break? \n\n          But note: the total candies for the match at j0 is 2, j1 is 4, j2 is 6. The maximum is 6.\n\n          So the code updates r to the last match, which is the one with the largest j? and that gives the largest total? \n\n          Why? Because the total = d[s] + (j+1). And as j increases, (j+1) increases. And d[s] for a given s is fixed. But s is increasing. And d[s] for a larger s might be larger? \n\n          Actually, the left prefix sums are increasing: so a larger s corresponds to a larger d[s] (because we break when s>total_sum//2, and the prefix sums are increasing). Similarly, the suffix sums are increasing. \n\n          But note: the total = d[s] + (j+1). And j+1 is the number of candies from the right. And for a given s, d[s] is fixed. But as j increases, we are matching a larger s. And the d[s] for a larger s is at least as large as for a smaller s? Because the prefix sums are increasing. \n\n          However, consider: \n            s1 < s2, then d[s1] < d[s2]? Yes, because the prefix sums are increasing. \n            And j1 for s1: the number of candies for the right to get s1 is j1+1, and for s2 is j2+1, and since s2>s1, j2+1 > j1+1? Not necessarily: because the weights are positive, so to get a larger sum we need more candies? Not necessarily: we might have a large weight at the end. \n\n          Example: \n            w = [1, 1, 1, 100, 1]   # n=5, total=104, x=52.\n            Left prefix:\n                s0=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s1=2 -> d[2]=2\n                s2=3 -> d[3]=3 -> then next: 3+100=103>52 -> break.\n            d = {1:1,2:2,3:3}\n            Right:\n                reversed: [1,100,1,1,1] -> \n                j0: s=1 -> in d: total=1+1=2.\n                j1: s=1+100=101 -> not in d.\n                j2: s=101+1=102 -> not in d.\n                j3: s=102+1=103 -> not in d.\n                j4: s=103+1=104 -> not in d.\n\n            Then output 2.\n\n          But what if we have:\n            w = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1]   # n=5, total=104, x=52.\n            Left prefix:\n                s0=1 -> d[1]=1\n                s1=101 -> break? because 101>52 -> so we break. Then d = {1:1}\n            Right:\n                reversed: [1,1,1,100,1] -> \n                j0: s=1 -> in d: total=1+1=2.\n                j1: s=1+1=2 -> not in d? because we broke early and didn't store 2? \n                j2: s=2+1=3 -> not in d.\n                j3: s=3+100=103 -> not in d.\n                j4: s=103+1=104 -> not in d.\n\n            Then output 2.\n\n          But is there a better solution? \n            Alice: [1] -> sum=1, Bob: [1] (last candy) -> sum=1 -> total=2.\n            Or Alice: [1,100] -> sum=101, Bob: [1,100]? but Bob can only take from the right: the last two: [1,1] -> sum=2 -> not equal.\n            Or Alice: [1] and Bob: [1,1] -> sum=1 vs 2 -> not equal.\n\n          So 2 is the best.\n\n          Therefore, the provided code is almost correct. But the TODO part: \n\n            if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n\n          What should we do? We break out of the loop? Because we don't want to store any left prefix sum that is greater than x (which is total_sum//2). \n\n          So we do:\n\n            if s > x:\n                break\n\n          But note: what if s==x? Then we store and then next will be >x? So we break after storing the last one? \n\n          Actually, we break after we exceed x. So we break after the first s that is >x.\n\n          But what if we have s==x? Then we store and then we break in the next iteration? \n\n          Example: \n            w = [1,1,1,1] -> total=4, x=2.\n            i0: s=1 -> store d[1]=1 -> then s<=2 -> no break.\n            i1: s=2 -> store d[2]=2 -> then next: i2: s=3 -> break.\n\n          So we break after storing the first two.\n\n          But note: we break in the iteration when s becomes >x. So we break after adding the third candy. \n\n          So the code:\n\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: \n                    break\n                d[s] = idx+1\n\n          Then we break out of the loop. \n\n          But what if we break early, we might miss a prefix sum that is <=x? \n\n          Example: \n            w = [3, 1, 1]   # total=5, x=2 -> but wait, total=5, x=5//2=2 -> integer division: 2.\n            i0: s=3 -> 3>2 -> break. Then we don't store any prefix sum? \n            Then d only has the initial 0? But we didn't store 0? \n\n          Actually, we started with an empty dictionary? And we break at the first candy. Then d is empty. \n\n          But we did store the initial 0? The provided code does not show that. \n\n          The provided code:\n\n            s, d = 0, {}\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: \n                    # break?\n                d[s] = idx+1\n\n          We must initialize d with {0:0}? \n\n          Why? Consider: \n            Bob takes the entire array: then Alice takes 0. Then we need d[0]=0.\n\n          But in the problem, they must eat at least one candy? The problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" -> any number, including 0? But the problem says \"positive\" in the note? Actually, the note: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" -> they eat at least one.\n\n          But the problem says: \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" -> so they can eat 0? but that's not maximum.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"print a single integer\" and the example answers are 2, 6, 0, 7.\n\n          In the third test case: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0.\"\n\n          So they require non-zero weight? \n\n          Therefore, we don't need the 0. \n\n          But in the example: \n            w = [3,1,1] -> total=5, x=2.\n            We break at the first candy: s=3>2 -> break. Then d is empty. \n            Then we traverse the right: \n                j0: s=1 -> not in d -> r=0.\n                j1: s=1+1=2 -> in d? d is empty -> no.\n                j2: s=2+3=5 -> not in d.\n            Then output 0.\n\n          Which is correct.\n\n          But what if we have a solution that uses 0? \n            The problem says: non-zero weight. So we don't consider 0.\n\n          However, note: the problem says \"non-zero\", so we require that the sum is non-zero. But the dictionary d does not contain 0? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"they want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" and the total weight must be non-zero? \n\n          The note: \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight\"\n\n          So we are only interested in non-zero sums.\n\n          Therefore, we don't need to store 0.\n\n          But what if the entire array is taken? Then the left segment is the entire array? But then the right segment is empty? and the sum of the right segment is 0. But we require non-zero? \n\n          Actually, the entire array: Alice takes the entire array, Bob takes nothing -> then the sums are total and 0 -> not equal (unless total=0, which is not possible). \n\n          So we don't consider 0.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program1.py:\n\n            We break when s > x.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, so we break early and the loop might be short.\n\n          However, the provided code does not initialize d with 0. So we are good.\n\n          But wait: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200,000, but we break when s > x, which might be early. \n\n          Now, the TODO in program1.py is:\n\n            if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We should break.\n\n          So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            break\n\n          But note: the code after the if statement: d[s] = idx+1. We don't want to store s if s>x? \n\n          Actually, we break after storing? \n\n          The current code:\n\n            s += i\n            if s > x: \n                # TODO\n            d[s] = idx+1\n\n          If we break, then we skip the store? \n\n          But we don't want to store s if s>x? \n\n          Actually, we break and then we don't store that s? \n\n          But we don't want to store any s that is >x. \n\n          So we should break and then skip the store? \n\n          How? \n\n            s += i\n            if s > x: \n                break\n            d[s] = idx+1\n\n          So we break and then we don't store that s.\n\n          But what if we break at the first candy? Then we don't store that candy. \n\n          Example: w = [3,1,1] -> we break at the first candy (s=3>2) and we break, so we don't store d[3]=1. Then d remains as the initial d (which is empty). \n\n          That is correct.\n\n          But what if we have a prefix that is exactly x? Then we store it and then next we break? \n\n          Example: w = [2,3] -> total=5, x=2.\n            i0: s=2 -> not >2 -> store d[2]=1.\n            i1: s=2+3=5>2 -> break -> then we don't store 5.\n\n          Then d = {2:1}. Then the right: \n            reversed: [3,2]\n            j0: s=3 -> not in d.\n            j1: s=3+2=5 -> not in d? because we didn't store 5? \n          Then output 0.\n\n          But is there a solution? \n            Alice: [2] -> sum=2, Bob: [3] -> sum=3 -> not equal.\n            Alice: [2,3] -> sum=5, Bob: nothing -> 5 vs 0 -> not equal.\n            Alice: nothing, Bob: [3,2] -> 0 vs 5 -> not equal.\n            Alice: nothing, Bob: [2] -> 0 vs 2 -> not equal.\n            Alice: [2], Bob: nothing -> 2 vs 0 -> not equal.\n          So no solution? then output 0.\n\n          But the problem says: \"For the third test case, there is no way ... so the answer is 0\".\n\n          So it's correct.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            break\n\n          But note: the code already has:\n\n            if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with: break\n\n          However, the provided code for program1.py has:\n\n            x = sum(a) // 2\n            s, d = 0, {}\n            for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n                s += i\n                if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n                d[s] = idx + 1\n\n          We change to:\n\n            if s > x: \n                break\n\n          But note: we must break and then skip the store? The store is after the if block. So if we break, we break out of the loop and skip the store. \n\n          So that's correct.\n\n          Now, for program2.py:\n\n          The problem: \n            Given n, find four positive integers a,b,c,d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d).\n\n          The provided code:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                ans = []\n                if n == 5:\n                    ans = [1, 2, 1, 1]\n                elif n % 4 == 0:\n                    ans = [n // 4] * 4\n                elif n % 2 == 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                else:\n                    a, c, d = 2, 2, 1\n                    b = n - a - c - d\n                    ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          We need to complete the TODO for even n that is not divisible by 4.\n\n          The examples:\n\n            n=7: \n                provided: [2,2,2,1] -> 2+2+2+1=7, and gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> valid.\n\n            n=8: \n                divisible by 4: [2,2,2,2] -> gcd(2,2)=2, lcm(2,2)=2 -> valid.\n\n            n=9: \n                else: [2, 4, 2, 1] -> 2+4+2+1=9, gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> valid.\n\n            n=10: \n                else: [2, 6, 1, 1] -> 2+6+1+1=10, gcd(2,6)=2, lcm(1,1)=1 -> not equal.\n\n          But the example says: \n            \"In the fifth test case gcd(3,5)=lcm(1,1)=1, 3+5+1+1=10\"\n\n          So the provided else branch does not work for n=10.\n\n          The code has a special case for n=5: [1,2,1,1] -> 1+2+1+1=5, gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> valid.\n\n          For the even n that is not divisible by 4: that is n % 2==0 and n % 4 !=0 -> so n mod 4 = 2.\n\n          Examples: n=6,10,14,...\n\n          The example for n=10: the answer is [3,5,1,1] -> 3+5+1+1=10, gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n          How to generalize?\n\n          We note that we want gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,d). Let k = gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d).\n\n          We can try to set k=1. Then we require:\n            gcd(a,b)=1 and lcm(c,d)=1.\n\n          lcm(c,d)=1 implies that c=1 and d=1.\n\n          Then we have a+b+1+1 = n -> a+b = n-2.\n\n          And we require gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n          We can choose a and b as consecutive integers? or any two numbers that are coprime and sum to n-2.\n\n          But note: a and b must be positive integers.\n\n          For n=10: a+b=8. We can choose a=3, b=5 -> gcd(3,5)=1.\n\n          For n=6: a+b=4. We can choose a=1, b=3 -> gcd(1,3)=1. Then [1,3,1,1] -> 1+3+1+1=6.\n\n          But is that valid? \n            gcd(1,3)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> valid.\n\n          For n=14: a+b=12. We can choose a=5, b=7 -> gcd(5,7)=1. Then [5,7,1,1] -> 5+7+1+1=14.\n\n          But what if n=4? \n            The input n>=4, and n=4 is divisible by 4 -> handled by the first branch: [1,1,1,1].\n\n          What if n=2? but n>=4.\n\n          So for the branch n % 2==0 and n % 4 !=0 (so n>=6 and n mod 4=2), we can do:\n\n            c=1, d=1\n            Then a+b = n-2.\n            We need to choose a and b such that gcd(a,b)=1.\n\n            We can choose a = (n-2)//2 - 1, b = (n-2)//2 + 1? But note: (n-2) is even? because n is even -> n-2 is even. Then we can choose two consecutive odd numbers? \n\n            But we need gcd(a,b)=1. Consecutive integers are coprime.\n\n            However, (n-2) might be even, so we can split it into two consecutive integers? \n\n            Example: n=6: n-2=4 -> consecutive integers: 1 and 3 -> works.\n            n=10: 8 -> consecutive integers: 3 and 5 -> works.\n            n=14: 12 -> consecutive integers: 5 and 7 -> works.\n\n            But consecutive integers: \n                a = (n-2-1)//2, b = (n-2+1)//2? \n                Actually, we want two numbers that sum to n-2 and are consecutive? \n\n            We can set: \n                a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n                b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n\n            But for n=6: (n-2)=4 -> a=4//2-1=1, b=4//2+1=3 -> works.\n\n            But what if (n-2)//2 is not an integer? But n-2 is even, so (n-2)//2 is an integer.\n\n            However, we must ensure that a and b are positive. \n                a = (n-2)//2 - 1 >= 1? \n                (n-2)//2 - 1 >= 1  => (n-2)//2 >= 2 => n-2>=4 => n>=6 -> which is true because n>=6.\n\n            But for n=6: (6-2)//2 = 2 -> a=1, b=3 -> positive.\n\n            For n=10: (10-2)//2=4 -> a=3, b=5.\n\n            But note: consecutive integers: they are coprime.\n\n          However, what if we have n=6: we get [1,3,1,1] -> but the example for n=7: [2,2,2,1] -> which is different.\n\n          But the problem says: \"If there are several possible answers you can output any of them.\"\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n            b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n            c = 1\n            d = 1\n\n          But what if (n-2)//2 - 1 is 0? Then a=0 -> but we need positive integers. \n\n          For n=6: (6-2)//2-1 = 1 -> positive.\n\n          The smallest n in this branch is 6: then a=1.\n\n          But what if n=4? not in this branch.\n\n          However, what if n=2? not possible.\n\n          But note: n>=4, and this branch is for even n that is not divisible by 4 -> so n>=6.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n            a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n            b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n            c = 1\n            d = 1\n\n          But wait: what if (n-2)//2 - 1 is 0? \n            (n-2)//2 - 1 = 0  => (n-2)//2 = 1 => n-2=2 => n=4 -> but n=4 is divisible by 4, so not in this branch.\n\n          So it's safe.\n\n          However, the example for n=10: [3,5,1,1] -> which is what we have.\n\n          But the provided example for n=9: \n            else: [2,4,2,1] -> 2+4+2+1=9, gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> valid.\n\n          The branch for n=9: odd -> so it goes to the else branch.\n\n          The else branch: \n            a, c, d = 2, 2, 1\n            b = n - a - c - d = 9-2-2-1=4 -> [2,4,2,1]\n\n          How to generalize for odd n? \n\n          The else branch is for odd n? Actually, the condition: \n            if n==5: ...\n            elif n%4==0: ...\n            elif n%2==0: ...   # even but not divisible by 4\n            else: ...           # odd\n\n          The example for n=5: [1,2,1,1] -> 1+2+1+1=5, gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1.\n\n          For n=7: the example uses [2,2,2,1] -> but 7 is odd? Then it would go to the else branch? \n\n          The else branch for n=7: \n            a=2, c=2, d=1 -> then b=7-2-2-1=2 -> [2,2,2,1] -> which is the example.\n\n          For n=9: [2,4,2,1] -> as above.\n\n          For n=11: \n            a=2, c=2, d=1 -> b=11-2-2-1=6 -> [2,6,2,1] -> \n            gcd(2,6)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> valid.\n\n          But what if we have n=3? but n>=4.\n\n          However, what if n=1? not possible.\n\n          But the problem says n>=4.\n\n          But what if n=10? \n            The code for n=10: even and not divisible by 4 -> so we are in the TODO branch.\n\n          We have to complete the TODO branch.\n\n          So the missing code for program2.py in the branch \"elif n % 2 == 0:\" is:\n\n            a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n            b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n            c = 1\n            d = 1\n            ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          But note: we must ensure that a and b are positive. We argued they are at least 1.\n\n          However, let's test n=6: \n            a = (6-2)//2 - 1 = 4//2-1 = 2-1 = 1\n            b = (6-2)//2+1 = 2+1=3\n            c=1, d=1 -> [1,3,1,1] -> 1+3+1+1=6 -> valid.\n\n          But the example for n=7: not in this branch.\n\n          But what if we have n=10: \n            a = (10-2)//2-1 = 8//2-1=4-1=3\n            b = 4+1=5\n            c=1, d=1 -> [3,5,1,1] -> valid.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n            b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n            c = 1\n            d = 1\n            ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          But note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and we have a= (n-2)//2-1, which for n>=6 is at least 1.\n\n          However, we can write it as:\n\n            half = (n-2) // 2\n            a = half - 1\n            b = half + 1\n            ans = [a, b, 1, 1]\n\n          But the code: we set ans = [a, b, c, d] -> we have c=1, d=1.\n\n          Now, we output the missing code as a JSON:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\nb = (n-2)//2 + 1\\nc = 1\\nd = 1\\nans = [a, b, c, d]\"}\n\n          But note: the program2.py code has:\n\n            elif n % 2 == 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with:\n\n            a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n            b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n            c = 1\n            d = 1\n            ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          However, we can write it in one line? But the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n          But the TODO is a block. We output the block.\n\n          But note: the program2.py code has:\n\n            elif n % 2 == 0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with the four lines.\n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly. Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\"\n\n          So we output the string for the block.\n\n          However, the program1.py has a single line: break.\n\n          But the program1.py code has:\n\n            if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the TODO with: break\n\n          But note: the TODO is in a comment? We remove the TODO and put break.\n\n          Actually, the line is:\n\n            if s > x: # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We want to replace the entire line? Or just the comment? \n\n          The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          For program1.py, the missing part is the body of the if statement. So we output \"break\".\n\n          For program2.py, the missing part is the block for the elif branch.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"    a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\n    b = (n-2)//2 + 1\\n    c = 1\\n    d = 1\\n    ans = [a, b, c, d]\"}\n\n          But note: the indentation: the elif branch is indented. The block should be indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n          The existing code in the elif branch has a comment that is indented by 4 spaces. We replace that comment with the block, which is indented by 4 spaces (each line of the block should be indented by 4 spaces). But the code we are inserting is already indented? \n\n          Actually, the program2.py code:\n\n                elif n % 2 == 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the comment with:\n\n                    a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n                    b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n                    c = 1\n                    d = 1\n                    ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          But in the string we output, we represent the block as a string with newlines and the same level of indentation.\n\n          However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we must match the surrounding.\n\n          Since the existing code uses 4-space indentation, we output each line of the block with 4 extra spaces? \n\n          Actually, the line after the elif is already indented by 4 spaces. Then the block we insert should be at the same level. \n\n          But the existing code has:\n\n                elif n % 2 == 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We replace the comment with:\n\n                    a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n                    b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n                    c = 1\n                    d = 1\n                    ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          So the block has 8 spaces at the beginning? Actually, the entire block is indented by 4 more spaces relative to the 'elif' line.\n\n          How we represent in the string? \n\n          We can write:\n\n            \"program2\": \"    a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\n    b = (n-2)//2 + 1\\n    c = 1\\n    d = 1\\n    ans = [a, b, c, d]\"\n\n          This has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n          But the existing code in the elif branch is at 4 spaces of indentation (relative to the for loop). Then the block should be at 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the for loop is indented by 4, then the if/elif are indented by 8, then the block inside the elif should be 12? \n\n          But the existing code in the if n==5: branch is:\n\n                ans = [1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n          which is at 8 spaces? Actually, the entire block of the for loop is indented by 4, then the if/elif are at 8, and the block inside the if/elif is at 12? \n\n          But the example:\n\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                ans = []\n                if n == 5:\n                    ans = [1, 2, 1, 1]   # this line is indented by 8? \n\n          Actually, the code we are given for program2.py:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input())\n                ans = []\n                if n == 5:\n                    ans = [1, 2, 1, 1]\n                elif n % 4 == 0:\n                    ans = [n // 4] * 4\n                elif n % 2 == 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                else:\n                    a, c, d = 2, 2, 1\n                    b = n - a - c - d\n                    ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          The block for the if n==5 is at 4 more spaces than the if statement? \n\n          Actually, the if statement is at 8 spaces (relative to the for loop at 4). Then the block inside the if is at 12? \n\n          But the code uses 4-space indentation? \n\n          We can assume the existing code uses 4-space indentation.\n\n          Then:\n\n            for _ in range(t):   # 0\n                n = int(input())   # 4\n                ans = []   # 4\n                if n == 5:   # 4\n                    ans = [1, 2, 1, 1]   # 8\n                elif n % 4 == 0:   # 4\n                    ans = [n // 4] * 4   # 8\n                elif n % 2 == 0:   # 4\n                    # TODO: Your code here   # 8\n                else:   # 4\n                    a, c, d = 2, 2, 1   # 8\n                    b = n - a - c - d   # 8\n                    ans = [a, b, c, d]   # 8\n\n          So the block we insert should be at 8 spaces? \n\n          But the TODO comment is at 8 spaces. So we output the block with 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the block we insert should be at the same level as the other assignments.\n\n          So we output:\n\n            \"    a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\n    b = (n-2)//2 + 1\\n    c = 1\\n    d = 1\\n    ans = [a, b, c, d]\"\n\n          This has 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? But we are in a block that is already at 4 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the entire block for the elif branch is at 8 spaces. So we output each line with 4 spaces? \n\n          But the existing code in the if n==5 branch has 4 spaces? Actually, it has 8? \n\n          How many spaces? The line \"ans = [1,2,1,1]\" is indented by 4 more spaces than the \"if n==5\" line? \n\n          In the string, we represent the block as:\n\n            \"    a = ...\"\n\n          which is 4 spaces. Then when inserted in the elif branch, which is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for), the total will be 8+4=12? \n\n          But we want 8? \n\n          Actually, the existing code in the if branch is:\n\n                if n == 5:\n                    ans = [1, 2, 1, 1]\n\n          The \"ans = ...\" is at 8 spaces (relative to the outer for). \n\n          We want the block for the elif branch to be at 8 spaces? \n\n          But the TODO comment is at 8 spaces. \n\n          Therefore, the block we insert should be at 8 spaces. \n\n          But the string we output for the block: if we output \"a = ...\" without any extra spaces, then it will be at 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the existing code:\n\n                elif n % 2 == 0:\n                    a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n\n          The \"a = ...\" is at the same level as the \"ans = ...\" in the if branch.\n\n          How? The elif is at 4 spaces (relative to the for) and then the block is at 8 spaces.\n\n          So we output the block without any extra indentation? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\"\n\n          The missing code for the elif branch is the block of code that replaces the TODO. We output the block as:\n\n            \"a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\nb = (n-2)//2 + 1\\nc = 1\\nd = 1\\nans = [a, b, c, d]\"\n\n          But then when we insert, we must insert at the same indentation level as the TODO comment.\n\n          The TODO comment is at 8 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the code we are given has:\n\n                elif n % 2 == 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          The \"# TODO\" is at 8 spaces. We replace it with:\n\n                    a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n                    b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n                    c = 1\n                    d = 1\n                    ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          But that would be 12 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the \"# TODO\" is at 8 spaces. We want the new code to be at 8 spaces. So we output the code without any extra spaces? \n\n          But the code we output is a string. We must represent the code exactly as it should appear.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            \"a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\nb = (n-2)//2 + 1\\nc = 1\\nd = 1\\nans = [a, b, c, d]\"\n\n          But then when we insert, we insert at the same level as the TODO comment? \n\n          The TODO comment is at 8 spaces. We remove the TODO comment and put the code at 8 spaces.\n\n          So the string we output should not have any extra spaces at the beginning of the lines? \n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the exact code.\n\n          But the code for the block is:\n\n            a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n            b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n            c = 1\n            d = 1\n            ans = [a, b, c, d]\n\n          And each line is at 8 spaces? \n\n          How do we represent that? We output the lines without any extra leading spaces? \n\n          But the entire block is at 8 spaces. So we output:\n\n            \"a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\nb = (n-2)//2 + 1\\nc = 1\\nd = 1\\nans = [a, b, c, d]\"\n\n          But then when we insert, we insert at the current indentation level (which is 8 spaces). \n\n          However, the code we are given has the TODO comment at 8 spaces. We replace that one line with the 5 lines, each at 8 spaces.\n\n          So we output the string without any extra leading spaces.\n\n          Similarly, for program1.py, the missing code is the body of the if statement: we output \"break\", which is one line.\n\n          Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\nb = (n-2)//2 + 1\\nc = 1\\nd = 1\\nans = [a, b, c, d]\"}\n\n          But wait: the program2.py code has the line:\n\n                elif n % 2 == 0:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are replacing the TODO line with 5 lines. So we output 5 lines.\n\n          However, we can write the program2 block in a more compact way? \n\n          We can do:\n\n            a = (n-2)//2 - 1\n            b = (n-2)//2 + 1\n            ans = [a, b, 1, 1]\n\n          But the code uses the variable 'ans'. And the existing code sets ans = [a, b, c, d]? \n\n          Actually, we can do:\n\n            ans = [(n-2)//2 - 1, (n-2)//2 + 1, 1, 1]\n\n          But that is one line. \n\n          But the problem does not require compactness.\n\n          We'll output the 5 lines as above.\n\n          But note: the variable names: we use a, b, c, d. \n\n          The existing code in the else branch uses a, b, c, d. \n\n          So we are consistent.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"break\", \"program2\": \"a = (n-2)//2 - 1\\nb = (n-2)//2 + 1\\nc = 1\\nd = 1\\nans = [a, b, c, d]\"}"
