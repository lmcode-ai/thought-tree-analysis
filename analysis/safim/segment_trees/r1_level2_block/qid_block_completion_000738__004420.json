Therefore, we can reuse the variable m:\n\n              while m < n:\n                  # We are going to do one stage: \n                  #   operation: clone -> r += 1\n                  r += 1\n                  #   then we can swap up to min(m, n-m) from the donor to the target.\n                  s = min(m, n - m)\n                  r += s\n                  m += s   # update m to the new count in the target Why is this valid? After the first stage, the target has m1 = m0 + s0, where s0 = min(m0, n-m0). Then in the next stage, the donor is a clone of the target, which has m1, so we can take up to m1, but we only need n-m1. And we do:\n\n              s1 = min(m1, n-m1) This is exactly what we want. Test with n=6, m0=2:\n\n              Iteration1: \n                  r=0 -> r=1 (clone)\n                  s0 = min(2,4)=2 -> r=3\n                  m = 2+2=4\n              Iteration2: \n                  condition: 4<6 -> true. r=3+1=4 (clone)\n                  s1 = min(4,2)=2 -> r=6\n                  m=4+2=6\n              Iteration3: \n                  condition: 6<6 -> false, break. So it works. Another test: n=5, m0=1:\n\n              Iteration1: \n                  r=0+1=1, s0=min(1,4)=1, r=2, m=1+1=2. Iteration2:\n                  r=2+1=3, s1=min(2,3)=2, r=5, m=2+2=4. Iteration3:\n                  r=5+1=6, s2=min(4,1)=1, r=7, m=4+1=5. Iteration4: condition 5<5 -> false. Output 7. Therefore, the code for the while loop in program2.py is:\n\n              r = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  r += 1   # for the clone\n                  s = min(m, n - m)\n                  r += s\n                  m += s\n\n          But note: the variable 's' is not defined in the provided code. We can use any variable. We can do in one line? We can do:\n\n              r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n              m += min(m, n-m) But then we compute min(m, n-m) twice. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              s = min(m, n-m)\n              r += 1 + s\n              m += s\n\n          But we are allowed to write multiple lines. So the TODO is:\n\n              s = min(m, n - m)\n              r += 1 + s\n              m += s But wait, the condition is while m<n, and we are updating m.",

But the problem says we are only to complete the TODO inside the while loop. This is a problem. Alternatively, we can break out of the loop when cur>=n?

So the code inside the while loop:\n\n              if cur >= n:\n                  break\n\n              else:\n                  # do one stage But then we might do an extra iteration.

Then if after the stage, cur becomes>=n, we break. Then next iteration, the condition is still m<n, but if m is still less than n, we enter again, but then break immediately. So it will work.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe code is almost complete. We are missing the code for the condition where the rating is between 1600 and 1899 (Division 2) and also note that the condition for Division 1 is already in the else block.\n\nThe current code for program1.py is:\n\nx=int(input(\"\"))\nfor i in range (x):\n    c=int(input(\"\"))\n    if c<=1399:\n        print(\" Division 4\")\n    elif 1400<=c<=1599:\n        print(\" Division 3\")\n    elif 1600<=c<=1899:\n       # TODO: Your code here \n    else :\n       print(\" Division 1\")\n\nWe just need to fill the missing line for Division 2. It should be:\n    print(\" Division 2\")\n\nBut note: the current print statements have a space at the beginning. We should be consistent. However, the problem says to output in the format \"Division X\", without any extra spaces? But the existing prints have a space. Actually, looking at the example outputs in the note, they don't have a space at the beginning. But the existing code does. Let me check the note: \nFor example, the note says: \n  For test cases 1-4: ... division 4.\n  Output: \"Division 4\"\n\nBut the code currently prints \" Division 4\" (with a space). This might be a mistake. However, the problem says: \"output a single line containing the correct division in the format 'Division X'\".\n\nSo we should remove the space? But the existing code has it. We have two options: either change the existing prints to remove the space or be consistent. Since the problem says the format, and the example outputs in the note don't have the space, we should actually fix the existing prints? But note: the problem says to output only the missing code. And the instructions say: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\".\n\nHowever, the problem also says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\". So we are only to complete the missing part. But the existing code has a space. We have two choices:\n\n1. We output the missing line with the same style (with a space) to be consistent: \n   print(\" Division 2\")\n\n2. We note that the problem requires the format without the space, so we should fix the entire program? But we are only allowed to output the missing part.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"Output only the missing code\". So we are to complete the missing part without changing the existing code? Then we must output the same style.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we must output only the line for the missing condition. And we must be consistent with the existing prints. Since the existing prints have a space, we do the same.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo? The note says the output should be without space. But the existing code has space. This might cause a presentation error. However, the problem says: \"Output Specification: For each test case, output a single line containing the correct division in the format 'Division X'\".\n\nSo the format is without the space. Therefore, the existing code is incorrect. But we are not allowed to change the existing code? We are only to complete the missing part.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are allowed to fix the entire block? Actually, the TODO is only in one line. However, the existing code for the other conditions is already written. We are not supposed to change them? \n\nBut the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". So we must make sure the entire program is correct. However, the instructions also say: \"Output only the missing code\".\n\nSo we have a dilemma. But note the example: the note shows outputs without space. Therefore, the intended output is without the space. The existing code has a space. This is a mistake. We are allowed to fix the entire program? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We are only to fill the missing part.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the missing line without the space? But then the program would be inconsistent. The judge might accept it? Or we can fix the existing prints? But we are not allowed to output the entire program.\n\nI think the problem expects the missing line to be without the space? But the existing code has space. This is a problem.\n\nBut wait, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we are to output the missing line for the condition 1600<=c<=1899. We cannot change the other lines. Therefore, we must output:\n\n    print(\" Division 2\")\n\nBut note: the example outputs in the note are without the space. However, the problem says the format is \"Division X\", so the space is incorrect. But we are not allowed to change the existing prints.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended the space? The example outputs in the note are without the space, but the code provided has space. This is confusing.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Output Specification\" and the example outputs in the note are without space. So the code as provided (with space) is incorrect. However, we are only to complete the missing part. The entire program might be rejected because of the space? But that's not our fault? We are only to complete the missing part.\n\nSo I will output the missing line with the space to be consistent with the existing code.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a typo in the existing code? And we are allowed to fix the entire program? But the instructions say \"missing lines or blocks\". We are only to fill the TODO.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing line is:\n    print(\" Division 2\")\n\nBut wait, the condition for Division 1 is in the else block. The else block covers ratings >=1900 and also ratings that are below 1600? Actually, no: the conditions are:\n\n- if c<=1399: Division 4\n- elif 1400<=c<=1599: Division 3\n- elif 1600<=c<=1899: Division 2\n- else: Division 1\n\nThis is correct because the else will be for c>=1900.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nThe code provided:\n\nfrom collections import*\nfor a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n print(r)\n\nWe are to complete the while loop.\n\nThe problem: We are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we have an array of n integers. We can do two operations:\n1. Clone an existing array (so we get one more copy).\n2. Swap two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\nWe want the minimal number of operations to have at least one copy where all elements are equal.\n\nNote: Initially, there is one copy.\n\nObservations:\n\nWe can do a sequence of operations. The key is that we can swap arbitrarily. We can collect multiple copies of the same element in one array by swapping.\n\nHow?\n\nLet the target value be x. We want to have an array of all x. We can get x from anywhere in any copy. We can also create multiple copies of the array and then swap elements to concentrate the x's.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to swap from any two copies. So we can use multiple copies to gather the same element.\n\nWhat is the minimal number of operations?\n\nWe note:\n\n- If the array already has all elements equal (m==n), then we need 0 operations.\n\nOtherwise:\n\nWe can think:\n\nOperation 1: clone the array. Now we have two copies.\n\nThen we can swap two elements between the two copies. For example, we can swap an occurrence of x from the second copy to the first copy, and in return swap an element that is not x from the first copy to the second copy. This way, we can increase the count of x in the first copy.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to do multiple swaps arbitrarily. However, each clone operation and each swap operation counts.\n\nThe problem is asking for the minimal number of operations.\n\nInsight:\n\nWe can use the following strategy:\n\n1. Let m be the maximum frequency of any element in the array. We want to get an array with n copies of that element.\n\n2. We start with one array. We can clone the array to get more copies. Then we can swap to bring the same element (say the one with frequency m) into one array.\n\nHow many operations?\n\nNote: We can do:\n\n- Operation 0: we have one array.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Step 1: Clone the array -> now we have two arrays (operation count=1).\n  Then we can swap two elements: for example, we can swap an element that we want (say x) from the second array to the first array, and swap an element that we don't want from the first array to the second array. This increases the count of x in the first array by 1.\n\nBut note: we can do multiple swaps in one operation? The problem says: \"Swap two elements from any two copies (maybe in the same copy) on any positions.\" -> each swap is one operation.\n\nSo to get one more x in the first array, we need one swap operation.\n\nBut we can also clone again? Then we have three arrays, and we can swap from the third array to the first array.\n\nHowever, we can also swap from the same array? But if we swap within the same array, we don't change the counts. So we need to swap between different arrays.\n\nSo the process:\n\n- We start with one array (A0). We want to have an array with all x.\n\nWe can:\n\n  Operation 1: clone -> now we have two arrays (A0 and A1). Operation count=1.\n  Operation 2: swap an x from A1 to A0, and a non-x from A0 to A1 -> now A0 has one more x. Operation count=2.\n\nBut note: we can do multiple swaps? Actually, we can do one swap per operation. Each swap exchanges two elements (from two arrays, or same array). But to transfer an x from A1 to A0, we need to swap an element in A0 with an element in A1. So one swap operation.\n\nNow, after one clone and one swap, we have increased the count of x in A0 by 1.\n\nBut wait: initially, A0 had m0 = m (the max frequency). Then we do:\n\n  After the swap: A0 has m0+1 x's? Actually, we took one x from A1 and put it in A0, and we took one non-x from A0 and put it in A1. So A0 now has m0+1 x's.\n\nBut A1 now has: the same total of x's? Actually, we removed one x from A1 and added one non-x. So the frequency of x in A1 decreases.\n\nBut we don't care about A1. We only care about having one array (A0) with all x's.\n\nSo we need to get A0 to have n x's. Initially, it has m. We need n - m more x's.\n\nHow do we get each additional x? \n\nWe can do:\n\n  For each additional x we need (n - m times):\n      - We can clone the current set of arrays? But note: we can use the same clone for multiple swaps? Actually, we can use one clone to provide one x. Then we need to get the next x from somewhere else.\n\nBut we can also clone again? Then we have more arrays to take x's from.\n\nBut note: we can use one clone to provide multiple x's? Actually, no: because after we take one x from a clone, that clone no longer has that x. But we can take multiple x's from the same clone if it has multiple? \n\nHowever, the clone is a copy of the original array? But wait: we are swapping and changing the arrays. So after we swap, the arrays are modified.\n\nBut the problem: we start with one array. Then we clone, so we have two identical arrays. Then we swap between the two: we can take one x from the second array and put it in the first, and put a non-x from the first to the second. Then the second array now has one less x. So we cannot take another x from the second array? Only if it had at least two x's.\n\nSo the number of x's we can take from a clone is the number of x's in that clone. But initially, the clone has m x's. However, after we take one, it becomes m-1. Then we can take another? But then we need to do another swap.\n\nBut we can also create multiple clones? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  Operation 1: clone -> now two arrays. Operation count=1.\n  Then we can do up to m swaps from the second array to the first? But wait, we don't need to take only one x from the second array? We can take as many as we want? But each swap gives one x and we can do multiple swaps on the same clone.\n\nBut note: after we take k x's from the second array, the second array will have m-k x's. And the first array will have m+k x's. But we need to get the first array to n x's, so k = n - m.\n\nBut we can only take as many as the second array has? So k cannot exceed m? But what if n - m > m? Then we cannot get all from one clone.\n\nSo we need to create more clones.\n\nTherefore, the process:\n\n  We start with one array (A0) that has m x's. We need n - m more.\n\n  We can create a clone (A1) -> operation count=1. Then we can take min(m, n-m) x's from A1? But wait, we can take at most m from A1? Actually, we can take at most the number of x's in A1, which is m. But we need n-m. So we take k1 = min(m, n-m) from A1. Each taking requires one swap operation. So we use k1 swaps.\n\n  Then the total operations so far: 1 (clone) + k1 (swaps) = 1 + k1.\n\n  Now, if we still need more? Then we create another clone (A2) -> operation count=1 (so total clones now 2, and operations 1+k1+1). Then we take from A2: we can take min(m, remaining) because A2 is a clone of the original? But wait: when we clone, do we clone the original or the current state?\n\n  The problem says: \"Choose any array and clone it\". So we can clone the original? But the original might have been modified? Actually, we have multiple arrays. We can choose to clone the original array? But the original array is the one we started with? Or we can clone any existing array.\n\n  However, note: we are allowed to clone any array at any time. But if we clone the original array (which we haven't touched), then it has m x's. But if we clone A0 after we have modified it? Then it has more than m x's? But we don't want that because we want to take x's from the clone.\n\n  Actually, we want to clone an array that has as many x's as possible? But the original array (if we have preserved one) has m. Alternatively, we can always clone the original array? But we might have modified the original array? \n\n  Actually, we have two arrays: A0 and A1. We modified both by swapping. So if we want to get a fresh copy, we should have preserved one? \n\n  But note: we can choose to clone the original array at any time? Actually, the original array is the one we started with. But we have already swapped in A0 and A1. So we don't have the original anymore? \n\n  Alternatively, we can preserve the original by not modifying it? We can do:\n\n      Operation 0: we have A0 (the original).\n      Operation 1: clone A0 -> we have A0 and A1 (both original).\n      Then we swap between A0 and A1: we take one x from A1 and put it in A0, and put a non-x from A0 to A1. Now A0 has m+1 x's, and A1 has m-1 x's.\n      Then we can clone A0? But A0 is modified. Or we can clone A1? But A1 has m-1 x's. Or we can clone the original? But we don't have the original anymore.\n\n  So we must preserve one copy of the original? How? We can clone the original and then never swap from that preserved copy? Then we can use that preserved copy to make more clones.\n\n  Therefore, we can do:\n\n      Operation 1: clone the original -> we have two: A0 (original) and A1 (original). We leave A0 untouched? and use A1 to provide x's? But then we swap from A1 to the target array? But we haven't started building the target array.\n\n  Actually, we can designate one array as the target (say T). Initially, T is the original array. Then we use other clones to provide x's to T.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      Let T = the initial array. We want to make T all x's.\n\n      We need n - m more x's for T.\n\n      We can create a clone (A1) from T (which is the original) -> operation count=1. Then we can swap one x from A1 to T, and one non-x from T to A1. This gives T one more x. Then A1 has m-1 x's.\n\n      Then we can create another clone (A2) from the original? But we don't have the original anymore? Because T is modified and A1 is modified.\n\n      Alternatively, we can preserve the original by not using it for swapping? We can use the original to make clones? Then we can make multiple clones from the original, each having m x's.\n\n      So:\n\n          Operation 1: clone the original -> we have two arrays: T (the original) and A1 (a clone, which we will use to provide x's). But we don't want to modify T? Actually, we are going to modify T to become the target. So we don't need to preserve T? We can use the original T as the target and then we don't have the original anymore? \n\n      But then how do we get more clones? We can clone T? But T is being modified. Or we can clone A1? But A1 is the same as the original? But after we swap, A1 is modified.\n\n      Therefore, we must make all clones from the original before we do any swapping? \n\n      So:\n\n          Step 0: We have T0 (the original).\n          Step 1: Clone T0 -> we have T0 and T1. Operation count=1.\n          Step 2: We swap between T0 and T1: we take an x from T1 and put it in T0, and a non-x from T0 to T1. Now T0 has m+1 x's, and T1 has m-1 x's. Operation count=2.\n\n          Now, if we need more x's, we can clone T0? But T0 is modified. Or we can clone T1? But T1 has m-1 x's. Or we can clone the original? We don't have the original anymore.\n\n      Alternatively, we can preserve the original by:\n\n          Step 0: We have the original, call it O.\n          Step 1: Clone O -> we have O and T. We leave O untouched. We use T as the target? Then we can use O to make more clones.\n\n          Then:\n\n              Operation 1: clone O -> we have O and T (both original). Operation count=1.\n              Operation 2: swap: take an x from O and put it in T, and a non-x from T to O. Now T has m+1 x's, and O has m-1 x's? But wait, we swapped an x from O and a non-x from T. Then O loses one x and gains one non-x, so O has m-1 x's. T gains one x and loses one non-x, so T has m+1 x's.\n\n          Then we can clone O again? But O now has m-1 x's. Then we can take at most m-1 x's from the next clone? \n\n          Operation 3: clone O (which now has m-1 x's) -> we have O (with m-1), T (with m+1), and a new clone (with m-1). Operation count=2 (clones: two clones so far) and 1 swap -> total operations=3.\n\n          Then Operation 4: swap: take an x from the new clone to T, and a non-x from T to the new clone. Then T becomes m+2, and the new clone becomes m-2.\n\n          We can continue.\n\n      How many operations? \n\n          We need to get T to n x's: we need n - m x's.\n\n          We get each x from a clone. But each clone (except the first one) is made from the original? But we modified the original? Actually, we are cloning from O, which is being modified? \n\n      Alternatively, we can make a new clone from the original O? But we have modified O? So we cannot get a fresh clone with m x's.\n\n      Therefore, we must not modify O. How?\n\n          Operation 1: clone O -> we have O and T. We leave O untouched. We use T as the target? Then we need to get x's from somewhere to put into T. But we cannot take from O? Because we don't want to modify O. Then we can only take from clones that we make from O? \n\n          Then:\n\n              Operation 1: clone O -> we have O and T (both original). Operation count=1.\n              Then we cannot swap from O to T without modifying O? \n\n          But we can: we can swap between T and a clone that we make from O? \n\n          Operation 2: clone O -> we have O, T, and A1 (a fresh clone). Operation count=2.\n              Now we swap: take an x from A1 and put it in T, and a non-x from T to A1. Then T becomes m+1, and A1 becomes m-1. Operation count=3.\n\n          Then Operation 3: clone O again -> we have O, T, A1, A2 (fresh clone with m). Operation count=3 (clones: 3 clones? but we started with one and then did two clones? total arrays: 1+2=3? Actually, we started with one, then clone1: two, then clone2: three. Then we swap from A2 to T: Operation count=4.\n\n          So for each additional x, we do: one clone and one swap -> 2 operations per x.\n\n          Total operations for k x's: 2*k.\n\n          But we started with one clone operation to get T? Actually, we did:\n\n              Operation1: clone O -> we have two arrays: O and T. (We don't use T as the target? Actually, we do. But we haven't started collecting x's? We have T as the target and it has m x's. Then we need k = n-m x's.\n\n              Then for each of the k x's, we do:\n                  clone O (to get a fresh array) -> 1 operation\n                  swap (to take one x from the fresh array to T) -> 1 operation\n\n              Total operations = 1 (initial clone) + 2*k.\n\n          But wait: the initial clone (operation1) was to get T? But we already have T? Actually, we started with one array (O). Then we cloned to get T. Then we did k times: clone O and swap.\n\n          So total operations = 1 + 2*(n-m)\n\n          But is that minimal?\n\n          Alternatively, we can use one clone to provide multiple x's? \n\n          For example, we make one clone (A1) from O. Then we can take multiple x's from A1? But A1 has m x's. So we can take up to m x's from A1. Each taking requires one swap. So we can take min(m, n-m) x's from A1 with min(m, n-m) swaps.\n\n          Then if we still need more, we make another clone (A2) from O (which is untouched) and take min(m, remaining) from A2, and so on.\n\n          So the number of operations:\n\n              Let k = n - m (the number of x's we need).\n\n              We will use ceil(k / m) clones? \n\n              For each clone, we do:\n                  one clone operation\n                  and then we do up to m swaps (but we only do as many as needed until k is met).\n\n              Actually, for the first clone: we do 1 clone and then s1 swaps, where s1 = min(m, k). Then k becomes k - s1.\n              For the next clone: 1 clone and s2 = min(m, k) swaps, and so on.\n\n              Total operations = (number of clones) + (total swaps) = ceil(k/m) + k   [because total swaps is k]\n\n          But note: we also have the initial clone to get T? \n\n          Actually, we started with one array (O). Then we did:\n\n              Operation1: clone O to get T. (1 operation) -> now we have O and T.\n\n          Then we need to get k = n-m x's for T.\n\n          Then we do:\n\n              We make a clone from O (call it A1) -> operation count=1 (total=2)\n              Then we take s1 = min(m, k) x's from A1 to T -> s1 swaps (total=2+s1)\n\n              Then if k1 = k - s1 > 0, we make another clone from O (A2) -> operation count=1 (total=3+s1)\n              Then take s2 = min(m, k1) from A2 -> s2 swaps (total=3+s1+s2)\n\n          And so on.\n\n          Total operations = 1 (for creating T) + (number of clones for the donors) + (k swaps)\n          = 1 + ceil(k/m) + k\n\n          But note: the initial clone for T is necessary? Actually, we started with O. We can use O as the donor? Then we don't need to create T? We can use O as the target? \n\n          But we want to preserve O to make more clones? So we cannot use O as the target? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use O as the target? Then we don't need the initial clone? \n\n          Then:\n\n              We start with O (the target). We need to get k = n-m x's.\n\n              We make a clone (A1) from O -> operation count=1.\n              Then we take min(m, k) x's from A1 to O -> min(m,k) swaps. Operation count=1+min(m,k).\n\n              Then if we need more, we make another clone (A2) -> operation count=1+min(m,k)+1, then take min(m, remaining) from A2 -> and so on.\n\n          Total operations = ceil(k/m) [for the clones] + k [for the swaps]\n\n          But note: we don't have an initial clone for the target? We are using the original as the target. So we don't need the initial clone for T.\n\n          Therefore, the minimal operations = ceil((n-m)/m) + (n-m)   [if we use the original as the target]\n\n          But wait: we can also use the original as a donor? Actually, we can. But if we use the original as the target, then we are going to modify it. Then we cannot use it to make more clones? \n\n          So we must not use the original as the target? We must preserve the original to make clones? \n\n          Then we must create a target array by cloning the original. Then we have:\n\n              Operation1: clone O -> we have O and T. (1 operation)\n\n              Then we use O to make donor clones. For each donor clone, we do one clone operation and then we take up to m x's from that donor.\n\n              Total operations = 1 (for T) + ceil((n-m)/m) (for donor clones) + (n-m) (for swaps)\n\n          But note: we can also use the donor clones to make more donor clones? But that would be inefficient because they have less x's. So we always clone from O (which has m x's).\n\n          Therefore, the total operations = 1 + ceil((n-m)/m) + (n-m)\n\n          However, we can write ceil((n-m)/m) as (n-m + m - 1) // m? Actually, ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b.\n\n          So: ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m + m - 1) // m = (n-1) // m.\n\n          Therefore, total operations = 1 + (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n          But wait: let me test with the example.\n\n          Example 2: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, and the most frequent element? 0 appears twice -> m=2.\n\n          Then k = n-m = 4.\n\n          Then total operations = 1 + ceil(4/2) + 4 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.\n\n          But the note says the answer is 6.\n\n          Why 6? The note says:\n\n              Operation1: create a copy -> 1 operation (now two copies)\n              Then they did swaps? They say: \"After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array\" -> they did swaps? How many swaps? They moved two zeros? Actually, they moved two zeros: from the second array to the first? But they say: \"Now let's create a copy of the first array\" -> that's operation 2? Then they swapped again? \n\n          Actually, the note says:\n\n              Step1: create a copy -> operation1: now two arrays.\n              Then they swapped to get the first array to have three zeros? Actually, initially the first array had two zeros. Then they swapped two zeros from the second array to the first? That would require two swaps? Then the first array has four zeros? But then they created a copy of the first array (operation2: clone) -> now three arrays. Then they swapped two more times? \n\n          They did:\n\n              Operation1: clone -> 1\n              Then two swaps? -> 2 operations (total=3) to get the first array to have 4 zeros? (because they started with two, then got two more from the second array) -> but then the first array has 4 zeros? and the second array has 0 zeros? \n\n              Then they cloned the first array -> operation4: now four arrays? \n              Then they swapped two elements: they swapped two non-zeros from the first array (which is the one with 4 zeros) with zeros from the second array? But the second array only has zeros? \n\n          Actually, the note says:\n\n              After the first clone: two arrays: [0,1,3,3,7,0] and [0,1,3,3,7,0]\n              Then they swapped: \n                  [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> so they moved two zeros to the first array? and moved the ones and the three from the first array to the second? \n\n              Then they cloned the first array: operation3? -> now three arrays: [0,0,0,3,7,0], [0,0,0,3,7,0], [1,1,3,3,7,3]\n              Then they swapped: in the first two arrays: \n                  [0,0,0,0,0,0] and [3,7,0,3,7,0] -> they swapped the 3 and 7 from the first array with two zeros from the second array? \n\n          How many operations? \n\n              clone1: 1\n              swap1: 1 (to move one zero? but they moved two zeros? so two swaps? -> 2 operations for swaps? then total=3)\n              clone2: 1 (total=4)\n              swap2: 1 (but they did two swaps? so two more? total=6)\n\n          So 6 operations.\n\n          How does our formula work? \n\n          We have n=6, m=2.\n\n          We did:\n\n              Operation1: clone to get T -> 1\n              Then we need 4 more zeros for T.\n\n              We make a donor clone: operation2 -> 2\n              Then we take min(2,4)=2 zeros from the donor -> 2 swaps (operations 3 and 4) -> total=4, and we have T with 4 zeros, and the donor with 0 zeros? (because we took two zeros and put two non-zeros in return).\n\n              Then we need 2 more zeros.\n\n              We make another donor clone: operation5 -> 5\n              Then we take min(2,2)=2 zeros from the new donor -> 2 swaps (operations 6 and 7) -> total=7.\n\n          But the example did it in 6.\n\n          What's the difference? \n\n          In the example, after the first clone (operation1) they had two arrays. Then they used the second array as a donor to provide two zeros (with two swaps) -> operations 2 and 3 (for the two swaps). Then they cloned the first array (which now has 4 zeros) -> operation4. Then they swapped two non-zeros from the first array (which is the one with 4 zeros) with zeros from the second array? But wait, the second array was already used? \n\n          Actually, after the two swaps, the second array became [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> it has no zeros. Then they cloned the first array (which has 4 zeros) to get a third array. Then they swapped two non-zeros (3 and 7) from the first array with two zeros from the third array? \n\n          How did they do that? \n\n          They did:\n\n              Operation4: clone the first array (which has [0,0,0,3,7,0]) -> so the third array is [0,0,0,3,7,0].\n              Then they swapped the 3 and 7 in the first array with two zeros in the third array? \n\n          But note: the first array is the one they are building. They want to remove the non-zeros. So they swapped the 3 and 7 from the first array with two zeros from the third array. Then the first array becomes [0,0,0,0,0,0] and the third array becomes [0,0,3,3,7,0] (or [0,0,3,3,7,0] becomes [3,7,3,3,7,0]?).\n\n          Actually, they said: \n              [0,0,0,0,0,0] (first array) \n              [3,7,0,3,7,0] (second array) -> but wait, the second array was [1,1,3,3,7,3]? \n\n          This is confusing.\n\n          Alternative insight from known solutions:\n\n          There is a known solution for this problem (Codeforces Round 687 (Div. 2) problem B). The minimal operations is:\n\n              if m == n: 0\n              else:\n                  ans = 0\n                  cur = m\n                  while cur < n:\n                      ans += 1   # for the clone\n                      # then we can swap up to cur (which is the current number of x's we have in the target) \n                      # to get more x's: we can add up to cur x's in one operation (by swapping with a clone)\n                      cur += cur   # because we can use the target itself to make a clone? then swap to double the x's?\n                      ans += 1   # for the swaps? but wait, we did one clone and then we did cur swaps? \n\n          Actually, known solution:\n\n              t = int(input().strip())\n              for _ in range(t):\n                  n = int(input().strip())\n                  a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                  m = max(Counter(a).values())\n                  ans = 0\n                  while m < n:\n                      ans += 1  # this is for the clone operation: we create one clone\n                      # Then we can swap: we can use the clone to provide at most m new x's? \n                      # But then the target becomes m (original) + m (from the clone) = 2*m?\n                      # But we can also use the target to make a new clone? \n                      # Actually, after we have a target with m, we create a clone of the target (which has m x's) -> operation1.\n                      # Then we swap: we can take up to m x's from the clone to the target? But the target already has m x's, and we want to add more? \n                      # But the clone has m x's. We can take all m x's from the clone to the target? Then the target becomes 2*m x's? \n                      # But we need to do m swaps? \n                      # So total operations for this step: 1 (clone) + m (swaps) = m+1 operations.\n                      # Then we set m = 2*m.\n\n                  print(ans)\n\n          But wait, the doubling might not be minimal? \n\n          Let me test with n=6, m=2:\n\n              Step1: m=2 < 6 -> ans=0 initially.\n                  We do: \n                      ans += 1 -> ans=1\n                      Then we can add m=2 x's -> then the target becomes 2+2=4.\n                      Then we set m = 4? \n                  Step2: m=4 < 6 -> \n                      ans += 1 -> ans=2\n                      Then we can add m=4 x's? -> then the target becomes 4+4=8? which is >=6 -> then we break.\n                  Then we output 2.\n\n          But 2 operations? That is not 6.\n\n          Alternatively, the known solution might be:\n\n              while m < n:\n                  ans += 1   # for the clone\n                  # Then we can do swaps: we can swap to add up to m x's, but we don't need to add all m? we only need n-m.\n                  # But the known solution might be doubling the m? \n\n          This doesn't match.\n\n          Another known solution from the internet for \"Codeforces 687B\":\n\n              for _ in range(int(input())):\n                  n = int(input())\n                  a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                  c = Counter(a)\n                  m = c.most_common(1)[0][1]\n                  ans = 0\n                  while m < n:\n                      ans += 1  # clone\n                      # Then we can swap to double the number of the frequent element in the target?\n                      # But how?\n                      # Actually, after we clone, we can swap to get up to 2*m in the target?\n                      # But that would require m swaps? \n                      # So we do:\n                      ans += m   # for the swaps\n                      m *= 2\n\n                  # But then we subtract the extra swaps? because we might not need to swap all m if we only need n-m?\n                  # But the while loop condition is m < n, and we are doubling until m>=n.\n\n                  print(ans)\n\n          Test with n=6, m=2:\n\n              Step1: m=2<6 -> \n                  ans = 0 -> then ans becomes 1 (clone) and then we add m=2 (swaps) -> ans=3, then m=4.\n              Step2: m=4<6 ->\n                  ans=3+1+4 = 8, then m=8.\n\n              Then print(8) -> not 6.\n\n          This is not matching.\n\n          Let me read the note: they did 6 operations.\n\n          How can we achieve 6?\n\n          We have n=6, m=2.\n\n          We need 4 more zeros.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              Operation1: clone -> now two arrays: A0 and A1.\n              Operation2: swap between A0 and A1: move a zero from A1 to A0 -> A0 has 3 zeros, A1 has 1 zero.\n              Operation3: swap between A0 and A1: move a zero from A1 to A0 -> A0 has 4 zeros, A1 has 0 zeros.\n\n              Now we have A0 with 4 zeros. We then:\n\n              Operation4: clone A0 -> now we have A0, A1, and A2 (which is a copy of A0: 4 zeros).\n              Operation5: swap between A0 and A2: move a zero from A2 to A0 -> A0 has 5 zeros, A2 has 3 zeros.\n              Operation6: swap between A0 and A2: move a zero from A2 to A0 -> A0 has 6 zeros, A2 has 2 zeros.\n\n          This is 6 operations.\n\n          But wait, after operation4, A2 has 4 zeros. Then we do two swaps: we move two zeros from A2 to A0. So A0 becomes 4+2=6, and A2 becomes 4-2=2.\n\n          How many operations: 1 (clone1) + 2 (swaps1) + 1 (clone2) + 2 (swaps2) = 6.\n\n          So the pattern: \n\n              We need k = n-m = 4.\n              We can do it in two stages:\n\n                  Stage1: use a donor array (A1) to give 2 zeros (because the donor had 2 initially) -> cost: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n                  Stage2: use a donor array (A2) that has 4 zeros? but wait, after stage1, we have A0 with 4 zeros. Then we can use a clone of A0 as a donor, which has 4 zeros. Then we take 2 zeros from it -> cost: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3.\n\n                  Total = 6.\n\n          How to generalize?\n\n          We can use the target array itself to make a donor in the next stage? \n\n          In stage1: \n              donor has m0 = m = 2.\n              we can take up to 2 from it.\n          In stage2:\n              we make a donor from the target (which now has m0+2=4) -> so the donor has 4.\n              we take 2 from it.\n\n          So the number of operations for stage i: 1 (clone) + s_i (swaps), where s_i is the number taken in stage i, and the donor in stage i has d_i = (previous target's count) and s_i = min(d_i, remaining).\n\n          But the first donor is made from the original, so d_1 = m.\n          The second donor is made from the target after stage1, so d_2 = m + s1 = 2+2=4.\n          then s2 = min(4, 2)=2.\n\n          Total operations = 1+2 + 1+2 = 6.\n\n          How to compute the total? \n\n          We can simulate:\n\n              Let current = m   (current count in the target)\n              Let remaining = n - m\n              Let total_ops = 0\n\n              while remaining > 0:\n                  # create a clone from the current target? But wait, the first donor should be from the original? \n                  # But we are not preserving the original? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              total_ops = 0\n              current = m\n              remaining = n - m\n\n              # We have the target array with count = m.\n              # We can use the original to make the first donor? but we don't have the original anymore? \n\n          We must preserve the original? \n\n          But in the example, they used the original to make the first donor, and then used the target to make the second donor.\n\n          How to start:\n\n              We have the original array O.\n              We create a target array T by cloning O? -> op1: total_ops=1, and T has count = m.\n              Then we use O to make a donor D1? -> op2: total_ops=2.\n              Then we take s1 = min(m, remaining) from D1 to T -> op2+s1: total_ops=2+s1.\n              Then T becomes m+s1.\n              Then remaining = remaining - s1.\n\n              Then we use T to make a donor D2? -> op: total_ops=2+s1+1.\n              Then take s2 = min(m+s1, remaining) from D2 to T -> total_ops=2+s1+1+s2.\n              Then T becomes m+s1+s2.\n              Then remaining = remaining - s2.\n\n              Then we use T to make a donor D3? -> op: total_ops=2+s1+1+s2+1.\n              Then take s3 = min(m+s1+s2, remaining) from D3 to T -> total_ops=2+s1+1+s2+1+s3.\n\n          This is: 2 + (s1+s2+s3) + (number of clones after the first two) \n\n          But note: the first clone for T is counted, and then for each donor we do one clone and then s_i swaps.\n\n          Total operations = 1 (for T) + (number of donors) [each donor costs 1 clone] + (total swaps = n-m)\n\n          = 1 + (number of donors) + (n-m)\n\n          And the number of donors is the number of stages, which is the number of times we make a donor until we have enough.\n\n          How many stages? \n\n              In stage1: we take s1 = min(m, n-m)\n              In stage2: we take s2 = min(m+s1, n-m-s1)\n              In stage3: we take s3 = min(m+s1+s2, n-m-s1-s2)\n\n          But note: after stage1, the target has m+s1, so the next donor will have m+s1 (because we clone the target).\n\n          And we take min( (m+s1), remaining ).\n\n          This might not be optimal in terms of minimizing the number of stages.\n\n          Alternatively, we can always take as much as we can from a donor: \n\n              stage1: take s1 = min(m, n-m)\n              stage2: take s2 = min(m+s1, n-m-s1)  -> but m+s1 >= m, so we can take more.\n\n          Example: n=6, m=2: \n              stage1: s1 = min(2,4)=2, then T=4, remaining=2.\n              stage2: s2 = min(4,2)=2.\n\n          stages=2.\n\n          Total operations = 1 (for T) + 2 (number of donors) + 4 (swaps) = 1+2+4 = 7.\n\n          But the example did it in 6.\n\n          Why? because in the example, they did not create the first donor from the original? \n\n          In the example, they used the original to make the first donor, and then after stage1, the original is modified? \n\n          Actually, in the example, after stage1, the first array (target) has 4 zeros, and the second array (donor) has 0 zeros. Then they used the first array (target) to make a donor for stage2.\n\n          So the donors are not made from the original, but from the current target.\n\n          Therefore, we don't need to preserve the original. We can use the target to make the next donor.\n\n          Then the process:\n\n              We start with one array (O).\n              We designate it as the target?

We can:\n\n              Operation1: clone the array -> now two arrays: A0 and A1.\n              We designate A0 as the target, and A1 as the donor.\n\n          Then the process is the same as the subsequent stages: \n              In stage1: \n                  r += 1 (for the clone) \n                  then we do s1 = min(m, n-m) swaps: r += s1\n                  then current = m + s1\n              In stage2: \n                  if current < n, then we clone the target (A0) to get A2 (which has current) -> r+=1\n                  then s2 = min(current, n - current) swaps: r+=s2\n                  then current = current + s2\n\n          So the while loop can be:\n\n              r = 0\n              current = m   # the current count in the target\n              remaining = n - m   # but we haven't done anything, so the target has m.\n\n              while current < n:\n                  # We need to do a stage\n                  r += 1   # for the clone to create a donor\n                  # How many swaps? we can take up to current (if we are using a donor that is a clone of the current target) but wait, in the first stage, the donor is a clone of the original, which has m, not current.\n\n          But in the first stage, after the first clone, the donor has m, not current. \n\n          However, after the first stage, the target has current1 = m + min(m, n-m), and the donor has m - min(m, n-m) (if we took from the donor).\n\n          For the next stage, if we clone the target, the new donor will have current1.\n\n          So the number of x's we can take from a donor in stage i is:\n              stage0: donor has m (because we cloned the original)\n              stage1: donor has current0 = m\n              stage2: donor has current1 = m + s1\n              stage3: donor has current2 = current1 + s2\n\n          But in the while loop, we don't know the stage.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              current = m\n              r = 0\n              while current < n:\n                  # In the first iteration, we are in stage0: we need to create a donor from the original? \n                  # But we don't have the original preserved? \n\n          Alternatively, we can always use the current target to make the next donor. But for the first donor, we haven't created the target array? \n\n          We can start by designating the initial array as the target. Then we do:\n\n              while current < n:\n                  # create a donor by cloning the target -> r += 1\n                  # then we can take up to current (because the donor has 'current' x's) from the donor to the target? \n                  # but we only need n - current.\n                  s = min(current, n - current)\n                  r += s   # for the swaps\n                  current += s\n\n          Test with n=6, m=2:\n\n              Iteration1: current=2<6 -> \n                  r=0+1=1 (clone)\n                  s = min(2,4)=2 -> r=1+2=3\n                  current=2+2=4\n              Iteration2: current=4<6 ->\n                  r=3+1=4 (clone)\n                  s = min(4,2)=2 -> r=4+2=6\n                  current=4+2=6 -> break.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          But wait, in the first stage, the donor is a clone of the target (which has 2), so it has 2. Then we take 2 from the donor to the target: then the target becomes 4, and the donor becomes 0.\n\n          In the second stage, we clone the target (which has 4) to get a new donor with 4. Then we take 2 from it to the target: target becomes 6, donor becomes 2.\n\n          Total operations: 1 (first clone) + 2 (swaps1) + 1 (second clone) + 2 (swaps2) = 6.\n\n          But what about the original array? \n\n          We started with one array (the original). We designated it as the target. Then we:\n\n              Operation1: clone the target -> now two arrays: target and donor1 (with 2).\n              Operation2,3: swap two x's from donor1 to target -> target becomes 4, donor1 becomes 0.\n              Operation4: clone the target -> now three arrays: target, donor1, donor2 (with 4).\n              Operation5,6: swap two x's from donor2 to target -> target becomes 6, donor2 becomes 2.\n\n          This is valid.\n\n          But what if the initial array doesn't have the target element in sufficient quantity in the donor? \n\n          In this method, the donor is always a clone of the target, which has the same count as the target at the time of cloning.\n\n          And we are taking up to that count.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the while loop in program2.py:\n\n              while m < n:\n                  # We are going to do one stage: \n                  #   clone the current target: one operation.\n                  #   then we can swap up to m (but wait, m is the initial frequency, not the current count in the target) -> no, we need the current count.\n\n          But in the provided code, we have a variable 'm' which is the initial frequency, and we are not allowed to change it? \n\n          We have to use a different variable. \n\n          The provided code has:\n\n              n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\n          Then the while loop: while m<n: ...\n\n          We can introduce a new variable, say 'cur', and set it to m.\n\n          But the TODO is only inside the while loop. We are not allowed to change other parts? \n\n          We can do inside the while loop:\n\n              # We need to know the current count in the target. We can use a new variable, but we are not allowed to change the structure? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the variable 'r' for something else? \n\n          Let me see: the provided code sets r=0.\n\n          We can do:\n\n              cur = m   # current count in the target\n              r = 0\n              while cur < n:\n                  # but the condition is while m<n, which is always true if m<n initially, but we want to break when cur>=n.\n\n          But we cannot change the condition.\n\n          Given the constraints, the while loop condition is fixed: while m<n. \n\n          So if m>=n, we break. But inside the loop, we are increasing cur until it becomes>=n, but the condition is on m. \n\n          This will loop infinitely if m<n.\n\n          Therefore, we must change the condition to use cur. But the problem says we are only to complete the TODO inside the while loop.\n\n          This is a problem.\n\n          Alternatively, we can break out of the loop when cur>=n? \n\n          But the condition is while m<n, which is fixed. We can break inside the loop when cur>=n.\n\n          So the code inside the while loop:\n\n              if cur >= n:\n                  break\n\n              else:\n                  # do one stage\n\n          But then we might do an extra iteration.\n\n          How about:\n\n              while m < n:\n                  if cur >= n:\n                      break\n                  # do one stage\n\n          But initially, cur = m, and the condition is m<n, so we enter. Then if after the stage, cur becomes>=n, we break.\n\n          Then next iteration, the condition is still m<n, but if m is still less than n, we enter again, but then break immediately.\n\n          So it will work.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the while loop in program2.py:\n\n              from collections import defaultdict   # but they use from collections import *\n\n              # We are given: \n              #   for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n              #       n = len(a.split())\n              #       m = max(Counter(a).values())\n              #       r = 0\n              #       while m < n:\n              #           ... TODO ...\n\n              # We will do:\n\n              cur = m   # current count in the target\n              r = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  if cur >= n:\n                      break\n                  # One stage: \n                  #   operation1: clone the target -> r += 1\n                  r += 1\n                  #   then we can swap up to min(cur, n - cur) from the new donor to the target.\n                  s = min(cur, n - cur)\n                  r += s\n                  cur += s\n\n          But wait, we are not updating anything that the while loop condition uses. The condition is on m and n, which are fixed. So after we break, we break out.\n\n          However, we must do the while loop until the target has n. But the condition is while m<n, which is always true. So we will rely on the break.\n\n          Test with n=6, m=2:\n\n              Initially: cur=2, r=0.\n              Iteration1: \n                  since m=2<6, enter.\n                  cur=2 <6 -> no break.\n                  r = 0+1 = 1\n                  s = min(2, 6-2)=2\n                  r = 1+2=3\n                  cur=2+2=4\n              Iteration2:\n                  m=2<6 -> enter.\n                  cur=4<6 -> no break.\n                  r=3+1=4\n                  s = min(4,6-4)=2\n                  r=4+2=6\n                  cur=4+2=6\n              Iteration3:\n                  m=2<6 -> enter.\n                  but then if cur=6>=6 -> break.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          But note: we are not allowed to change the provided code outside the TODO? \n\n          The TODO is only inside the while loop. We are allowed to add code inside the while loop.\n\n          However, the provided code before the while loop is:\n\n              n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n\n          We need to introduce a new variable 'cur'. We can do that inside the while loop? But we need to initialize it before the while loop.\n\n          We are not allowed to change outside the TODO? \n\n          The TODO is only inside the while loop. We are not allowed to change the existing lines.\n\n          Therefore, we must find a way without 'cur'. \n\n          Notice that the value of 'cur' in stage i is: \n              cur0 = m\n              cur1 = m + min(m, n-m)\n              cur2 = m + min(m, n-m) + min(m+min(m,n-m), n - (m+min(m,n-m)))\n\n          But we can compute the next 'cur' from the previous 'cur'. \n\n          However, we are in a loop. We can use r to infer the current state? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the variable 'r' for something else? \n\n          But we need to return r as the total operations.\n\n          We can use another variable. But we are not allowed to change outside the TODO.\n\n          How about we use a list? but that is overkill.\n\n          Given the constraints, we can do:\n\n              We know that the process will not have more than about O(log(n)) stages, because cur at least doubles in each stage (if we take all from the donor, then next cur = 2 * cur). \n\n          But we are not allowed to change the provided structure.\n\n          Alternatively, we can notice that the total number of operations is independent of the path: it is the same as the binary representation? \n\n          But the known formula: \n              total_ops = 0\n              cur = m\n              while cur < n:\n                  total_ops += 1  # for the clone\n                  take = min(cur, n - cur)\n                  total_ops += take\n                  cur += take\n\n          And we need to do this in the provided structure.\n\n          Since we cannot change the condition, we can break when cur>=n.\n\n          But we need to initialize cur = m, and we are not allowed to change the existing lines.\n\n          We can do inside the while loop:\n\n              if 'cur' is not defined, initialize it to m.\n\n          But that would be:\n\n              while m<n:\n                  if 'cur' not in locals(): \n                      cur = m\n                  if cur >= n:\n                      break\n                  r += 1\n                  s = min(cur, n-cur)\n                  r += s\n                  cur += s\n\n          But this is not efficient and not allowed? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use the variable 'm' for something else? \n\n          But after the while loop, we print r. We don't need m anymore.\n\n          However, the condition is while m<n, and m is the initial frequency. We are not changing m.\n\n          We can reassign m to be the current count? \n\n          But then the condition in the next iteration would be while m<n, but m is changing.\n\n          And we want to break when m>=n.\n\n          So:\n\n              while m < n:\n                  # In the first iteration, m is the initial frequency.\n                  # We want to do:\n                  #   create a donor: r += 1\n                  #   s = min(m, n-m)\n                  #   r += s\n                  #   then m = m + s   # update m to the new count in the target\n\n                  # But then the next iteration: m is the new count.\n\n              This is exactly the same as using 'cur' but we reuse m.\n\n          And the condition: while m < n: will break when m>=n.\n\n          But note: in the first stage, we use the initial m to compute s = min(m, n-m). Then we update m to m+s.\n\n          In the next stage, we use the updated m to compute s = min(m, n-m) (but note: n-m is now n - (m+s) = n - m - s).\n\n          This is the same as the 'cur' approach.\n\n          Therefore, we can reuse the variable m:\n\n              while m < n:\n                  # We are going to do one stage: \n                  #   operation: clone -> r += 1\n                  r += 1\n                  #   then we can swap up to min(m, n-m) from the donor to the target.\n                  s = min(m, n - m)\n                  r += s\n                  m += s   # update m to the new count in the target\n\n          Why is this valid?\n\n          After the first stage, the target has m1 = m0 + s0, where s0 = min(m0, n-m0).\n          Then in the next stage, the donor is a clone of the target, which has m1, so we can take up to m1, but we only need n-m1.\n\n          And we do:\n\n              s1 = min(m1, n-m1)\n\n          This is exactly what we want.\n\n          Test with n=6, m0=2:\n\n              Iteration1: \n                  r=0 -> r=1 (clone)\n                  s0 = min(2,4)=2 -> r=3\n                  m = 2+2=4\n              Iteration2: \n                  condition: 4<6 -> true.\n                  r=3+1=4 (clone)\n                  s1 = min(4,2)=2 -> r=6\n                  m=4+2=6\n              Iteration3: \n                  condition: 6<6 -> false, break.\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Another test: n=5, m0=1:\n\n              Iteration1: \n                  r=0+1=1, s0=min(1,4)=1, r=2, m=1+1=2.\n              Iteration2:\n                  r=2+1=3, s1=min(2,3)=2, r=5, m=2+2=4.\n              Iteration3:\n                  r=5+1=6, s2=min(4,1)=1, r=7, m=4+1=5.\n              Iteration4: condition 5<5 -> false.\n\n          Output 7.\n\n          Therefore, the code for the while loop in program2.py is:\n\n              r = 0\n              while m < n:\n                  r += 1   # for the clone\n                  s = min(m, n - m)\n                  r += s\n                  m += s\n\n          But note: the variable 's' is not defined in the provided code. We can use any variable.\n\n          We can do in one line? \n\n          We can do:\n\n              r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n              m += min(m, n-m)\n\n          But then we compute min(m, n-m) twice.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              s = min(m, n-m)\n              r += 1 + s\n              m += s\n\n          But we are allowed to write multiple lines.\n\n          So the TODO is:\n\n              s = min(m, n - m)\n              r += 1 + s\n              m += s\n\n          But wait, the condition is while m<n, and we are updating m. The condition will be checked in the next iteration.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n              s = min(m, n - m)\n              r += 1 + s\n              m += s\n\n          But note: the problem says the minimal number of operations. This matches the examples.\n\n          Let me test with the example in the note: \n              Example1: all equal -> m=n, so the while loop is skipped -> r=0.\n              Example2: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6, m=2 -> we did 6 operations.\n\n          So we are good.\n\n          However, note: the input says the array elements can be negative and large, but the min and update are safe.\n\n          Therefore, the answer for program2.py is:\n\n              s = min(m, n - m)\n              r += 1 + s\n              m += s\n\n          But note: the problem says the sum of n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the while loop will run at most O(log(n)) per test case, which is acceptable.\n\n          Now, we output the missing code for program1.py and program2.py in the required JSON format.\n\n          For program1.py: the missing line is:\n              print(\" Division 2\")\n\n          But note: the existing prints have a space: \" Division 4\", so we do the same.\n\n          However, the problem says the format is \"Division X\", so the space is a mistake. But we are only to complete the missing part.\n\n          We'll output: \n              \"program1\": \"    print(\\\" Division 2\\\")\",   (with the same indentation)\n\n          But the TODO is in a line with 4 spaces indentation? \n\n          The provided line: \n                  elif 1600<=c<=1899:\n                     # TODO: Your code here \n\n          We should output the code with the same indentation. The existing prints are indented by 4 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the existing prints are:\n\n                  if c<=1399:\n                      print(\" Division 4\")\n                  elif 1400<=c<=1599:\n                      print(\" Division 3\")\n                  elif 1600<=c<=1899:\n                     # TODO: Your code here \n                  else :\n                     print(\" Division 1\")\n\n          The if, elif, else are at the same indentation (one level in from the for loop). The prints are indented one more level (probably 4 spaces).\n\n          The TODO line has 3 spaces? It has 4 spaces? \n\n          We'll output: \n              \"    print(\\\" Division 2\\\")\"\n\n          But the existing prints have 4 spaces at the beginning of the line? \n\n          Actually, the existing prints have 4 spaces: \n                  if ...:\n                      print(...)   # 8 spaces? \n\n          The structure:\n\n              for i in range (x):\n                  c = ... \n                  if ...:\n                      print(...)   # 8 spaces: 4 for the for block, 4 for the if block.\n\n          The elif is at the same level as if, so 4 spaces for the for block, then 4 for the if/elif.\n\n          Then the print should be 8 spaces? \n\n          But the TODO is in a line that has 7 spaces? \n\n          We'll output 8 spaces? \n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. The missing code is the print statement for the elif branch.\n\n          We can output:\n\n              \"    print(\\\" Division 2\\\")\"\n\n          with 4 spaces at the beginning? \n\n          But in the context, the line should be indented by 4 more spaces from the elif, so 8 spaces in total.\n\n          However, the existing prints in the if and elif branches are written with 8 spaces? \n\n          In the provided code:\n\n                  if c<=1399:\n                      print(\" Division 4\")   # this line has 8 spaces: 4 for the for, 4 for the if.\n\n          So we should output 8 spaces? \n\n          But the TODO is in a line that has 7 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the provided code for program1.py is:\n\nx=int(input(\"\"))\nfor i in range (x):\n    c=int(input(\"\"))\n    if c<=1399:\n        print(\" Division 4\")\n    elif 1400<=c<=1599:\n        print(\" Division 3\")\n    elif 1600<=c<=1899:\n       # TODO: Your code here \n    else :\n       print(\" Division 1\")\n\n          The if, elif, else are indented by 4 spaces (one level). The prints are indented by 8 spaces (two levels). The TODO line has 7 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the line with the TODO has 7 spaces: 4 for the for, 3 for the elif? \n\n          But it is written as:\n\n    elif 1600<=c<=1899:\n       # TODO: Your code here \n\n          The 'elif' is at 4 spaces, and the comment is at 7 spaces (3 more). \n\n          The next line in the else is:\n\n       print(\" Division 1\")\n\n          which is at 7 spaces.\n\n          So we should output a line with 7 spaces and then the print.\n\n          But the existing prints in the if and elif branches are at 8 spaces? \n\n          They are:\n\n        print(\" Division 4\")   # 8 spaces: 4 (for) + 4 (if) -> but wait, the if is at 4, and the print is at 8.\n\n          The elif branch:\n\n        print(\" Division 3\")   # 8 spaces.\n\n          The else branch:\n\n       print(\" Division 1\")   # 7 spaces? \n\n          This is inconsistent.\n\n          Looking at the else branch: it is written as:\n\n    else :\n       print(\" Division 1\")\n\n          The else is at 4 spaces, and the print is at 7 spaces.\n\n          So the if and elif branches have 8 spaces for the print, and the else has 7.\n\n          This might be a formatting issue. We should be consistent with the else branch? \n\n          But the problem says to output the missing code for the elif branch.\n\n          The elif branch currently has:\n\n    elif 1600<=c<=1899:\n       # TODO: Your code here \n\n          So the next line should be at the same indentation as the else branch's print: 7 spaces.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n              \"       print(\\\" Division 2\\\")\"\n\n          with 7 spaces.\n\n          But the if and elif branches have 8 spaces. Why the difference? \n\n          It might be a typo in the provided code. But we must match the else branch.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output 8 spaces to match the if and elif branches? \n\n          But the else branch is at 7. \n\n          Given the provided structure, we'll output 7 spaces for the elif branch's print.\n\n          So:\n\n              program1: \"       print(\\\" Division 2\\\")\"\n\n          And program2: the missing code for the while loop is:\n\n              s = min(m, n - m)\n              r += 1 + s\n              m += s\n\n          But note: the while loop body might be multiple lines. We are to output the block.\n\n          The provided while loop in program2.py is:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We are to replace the TODO with the code.\n\n          We can write:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    s = min(m, n - m)\n                    r += 1 + s\n                    m += s\n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code. And the TODO is at the same line as the while.\n\n          We can output:\n\n              \"    s = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += 1 + s\\n    m += s\"\n\n          But the existing code has no indentation inside the while? \n\n          The provided code: \n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          This is one line. We are to complete the block.\n\n          We should output the block with the proper indentation.\n\n          The next line after the while is \"print(r)\", which is not in the while. So the while body must be indented.\n\n          We'll output three lines, each indented by 4 spaces.\n\n          But the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces? \n\n          The code:\n\n              for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n          The for loop body has three lines: \n                n=len(...); ... \n                while ...: ...\n                print(r)\n\n          The while loop is one of the lines in the for body. The while loop body is missing.\n\n          We are to complete the while loop body. We should output:\n\n              while m<n:\n                  [our code]\n\n          But the provided code has the while in one line. We can break it:\n\n              while m < n:\n                  s = min(m, n - m)\n                  r += 1 + s\n                  m += s\n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code, not the entire while loop.\n\n          We are to output the body of the while loop.\n\n          So we output:\n\n              \"    s = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += 1 + s\\n    m += s\"\n\n          with 4 spaces for each line of the body.\n\n          But the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces? The for loop body has:\n\n                n= ...   # this line has 4 spaces\n                while ...:   # this line has 4 spaces\n                print(r)   # this line has 4 spaces\n\n          The while loop body should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n          But the provided code does not have the body. We are to add the body.\n\n          We'll output three lines, each starting with 8 spaces? \n\n          Alternatively, we can output:\n\n              \"\\n        s = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + s\\n        m += s\"\n\n          But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n          Since the TODO is in the same line as the while, we can output the block as:\n\n              the body of the while loop.\n\n          So the missing block is:\n\n                  s = min(m, n - m)\n                  r += 1 + s\n                  m += s\n\n          with 8 spaces for each line? \n\n          But the for loop body is indented by 4 spaces, so the while loop body should be 8 spaces.\n\n          However, the provided code uses 4 spaces for the for body. The while is in the for body, so the while body should be 8 spaces.\n\n          But the next line after the while is \"print(r)\" which is at 4 spaces, so it is not in the while.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n              program2: \"        s = min(m, n - m)\\n        r += 1 + s\\n        m += s\"\n\n          But note: the while condition is in the same line. We are only to output the body.\n\n          Alternatively, we can output:\n\n              program2: \"    s = min(m, n - m)\\n    r += 1 + s\\n    m += s\"\n\n          with 4 spaces per line? \n\n          But the for body is already at 4 spaces, so the while body should be 8.\n\n          Let me count the spaces in the provided code:\n\n              for a in ...:\n                n=...   # this line has two spaces? or four? \n\n          The provided code:\n\n              for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n=len(a:=a.split());m=max(Counter(a).values());r=0\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n                print(r)\n\n          The for body lines are indented by 4 spaces? \n\n          Actually, the first line of the for body: \"n=len(...)\" has 4 spaces at the beginning? \n\n          In the problem, it is written with 4 spaces? \n\n          We'll assume 4 spaces for the for body, and then 8 spaces for the while body.\n\n          But the while condition is written in the same line as the while, and it is at 4 spaces. The body should be at 8.\n\n          Therefore, the missing block for program2 is three lines, each starting with 8 spaces.\n\n          However, to be"
