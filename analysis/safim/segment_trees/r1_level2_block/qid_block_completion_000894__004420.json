We can do:\n\n                r += 1\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n            Alternatively, we can do without a temporary variable? r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n                m += min(m, n-m) But we are updating m. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                r += 1\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += t\n                m += t\n\n            Or in a compact form:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n                m += min(m, n-m)\n\n            But note: we need to update m?",

Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"continue\"\n            program2: two lines: \n                \"    r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\"\n                \"    m += min(m, n - m)\"\n\n            But note: the TODO block in program1 is one line: \"continue\", and in program2 is two lines. We output in JSON:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"continue\",\n                \"program2\": \"    r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\\n    m += min(m, n - m)\"\n            }\n\n            But note: the program2 code must be indented?

So we output the three lines? But note: the TODO block is one block? We can write multiple lines. Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n            But wait: what if we do:\n\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + min(m, n - m)   # but then the min(m, n-m) is after updating m? and we use the updated m? that would be different. We must do:\n\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + t\n                m += t\n\n            Or:\n\n                r += 1\n                r += min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m) But that computes min(m, n-m) twice.

But k is the smallest integer such that f(x)*(k+1) > = n.\n\n          So for a fixed x, we have:\n                k_min = ceil(n / f(x)) - 1   [because k+1 >= ceil(n/f(x))]\n\n          Then total operations = (ceil(n/f(x)) - 1) + (n - f(x)) But wait: is that correct? Let's test with the example. Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6. Let x=0. f(0)=2. k_min = ceil(6/2) - 1 = ceil(3) - 1 = 3-1 = 2.\n                total operations = 2 + (6-2) = 2+4 = 6. -> matches. Another example: if the array is already all x, then f(x)=n. Then k_min = ceil(n/n)-1 = 1-1=0. Then operations=0. -> correct. But what if we choose a different x? For example, in [0,1,3,3,7,0], if we choose x=3? f(3)=2. Then: k_min = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2, operations=2+(6-2)=6. But what if we choose x=1? f(1)=1. Then:\n                k_min = ceil(6/1)-1 = 6-1=5, operations=5+(6-1)=10. So we want the minimal operations over all x that appears in the array. Therefore, the algorithm: For a test case:\n                n = ... a = list of n integers. Let freq = frequency of each distinct number. Then, for each distinct number x that appears, let f = freq[x]. We require k_min = ceil(n / f) - 1, and then total_ops = k_min + (n - f) Then we take the minimum total_ops over all x.\n\n          But note: we must have at least one copy? and we start with one copy.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\n The problem: Count pairs of 2-letter strings (from 'a' to 'k') that differ in exactly one position.\n The current code:\n   t = int(input())\n   for x in range(t):\n       n = int(input())\n       d1 = {}\n       for i in range(97,109):   # 97 to 108 (which is 'a' to 'l'? but note: 109 is exclusive, so 97 to 108 -> 12 letters: 'a' to 'l'? but the problem says 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters: 'a' to 'k' is 97 to 107)\n       Actually, the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k', which is 11 letters. But the range(97,109) goes from 97 to 108 (inclusive) which is 12 letters. This is a mistake.\n\n However, note the problem: the strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So we should only consider 11 letters? But the initialization is for all pairs from 'a' to 'l'? That would be too many.\n\n But note: the input only contains letters from 'a' to 'k'. So we can fix the initialization to only 11 letters? Actually, the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k', so we can change the loops to 97 to 108? But 108 is 'l', which is beyond 'k'. So we should use 97 to 108? Actually, the problem says up to 'k', which is 107.\n\n Correction: 'a' is 97, 'k' is 107. So we should use range(97, 108) for 97 to 107? But note: range(97,108) is 97 to 107 inclusive -> 11 letters.\n\n However, the current code uses 97 to 109 (exclusive of 109) so 97 to 108 -> 12 letters. This is incorrect.\n\n But wait, the problem says: the strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So we should only consider 11 letters. However, the dictionary d1 is being initialized for all pairs of two letters from 97 to 108? That would include 'l'. But the input will never have 'l'. So it's safe? But then when we generate neighbors by changing one character to any letter from 97 to 108 (which is 12 letters) we are including letters beyond 'k'. That might be a problem because the input doesn't have them? Actually, the dictionary d1 is counting the frequency of the strings that we have. We are only going to update d1 for the strings that we actually see? But note: we are initializing all pairs from 97 to 108. Then we are going to update d1[s] for the input s. But if the input s is not in the initialized keys? Then we would get a KeyError.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a defaultdict(int) to avoid initializing all. But the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can use a dictionary without initializing all 11*11=121 keys? Actually, the current initialization is 12*12=144 keys. But the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters) so 121 keys. We can change the loops to 97 to 108? Actually, we should change to 97 to 108? But 108 is 'l'. We want 97 to 107.\n\n However, the problem says the input strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So we can change the loops to:\n   for i in range(97, 108):   # 97 to 107 (inclusive) -> 11 letters: 'a' to 'k'\n\n But note: the current code uses 109 as the end, which is 108. So we can change 109 to 108? Actually, the inner loop is the same.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid initializing the dictionary for all possible strings and use a defaultdict. But the current code initializes for all. Since 121 is small, it's acceptable.\n\n However, the current code has a bug: the inner loops for generating neighbors are from 97 to 109 (which is 97 to 108) -> 12 letters. We should change that to 97 to 108? Actually, we should change both loops to 97 to 108? But note: the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k', so we should only consider letters in that range. So we change both loops to 97 to 108? Actually, 108 is exclusive? So 97 to 108 (exclusive) is 97 to 107 -> 11 letters.\n\n Therefore, we should change the initialization loops to:\n   for i in range(97, 108):   # 97 to 107 (inclusive) -> 11 letters? Actually, no: range(97,108) is 97 to 107 inclusive? Actually, in Python, range(a, b) is from a to b-1. So range(97,108) is 97 to 107 -> 11 letters.\n\n But the current code uses 109 for the inner loop? We should change both to 108? Actually, the initialization loops and the neighbor generation loops should be the same.\n\n However, the current code for neighbor generation is:\n   for l in range(2):\n        for m in range(97,109):   # this is 97 to 108 (exclusive) -> 12 letters: 'a' to 'l'\n\n We should change the inner loop to 97 to 108? Actually, we want 97 to 107? So we change 109 to 108? Then it becomes 97 to 107 (inclusive) -> 11 letters.\n\n So we change both the initialization and the neighbor generation to use 108 as the end (so that we have 11 letters).\n\n But note: the problem says the input strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So we are safe.\n\n Now, the main logic:\n\n We are iterating for each string s. For each string s, we consider two positions (l=0 and l=1). For each position, we try to change that character to every letter from 'a' to 'k' (97 to 107). We form a new string a. Then we check: if a is the same as s? Then we skip? Because we are looking for pairs that differ in exactly one position. But note: if we change the first character to the same character, then a==s. We don't want to count that. So we should skip when a==s.\n\n The current code has:\n   if a == s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n And then after that, we do: ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But note: we are going to count the same string? Actually, we are trying to count pairs (i, j) with j < current index? Actually, the dictionary d1 is being built as we go. We are processing the strings one by one. For the current string s, we look at all the strings we have seen so far (because we update d1 after processing the current string). So for each neighbor a (which is a string that differs in exactly one position from s), we add the count of how many times we have seen that neighbor so far.\n\n However, when we generate a neighbor by changing one character, we might generate the same string s? Then we skip? Actually, we should skip when a==s. But note: if we change the first character to the same character, then a==s. Similarly for the second character. So we should skip that.\n\n Therefore, in the TODO part, we should skip the rest of the inner loop for this m? We can use 'continue' to skip the current m.\n\n But note: the code currently does:\n   if a == s:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n   ans1 += d1[a]\n\n We want to skip adding d1[a] when a==s? Because we don't want to count the same string? Actually, we don't want to count the same string because we are looking for pairs that differ in exactly one position. So when a==s, we should skip the addition.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid generating the same string by skipping the current m that equals the original character? But note: we are iterating m from 97 to 108 (which we are going to change to 97 to 107). So we can check: if chr(m) == s[l]? Then skip. But the current code generates a and then checks if a==s. That is equivalent to checking if the entire string is the same? Actually, we are changing one character. So if we change the first character to the same as the original, then the entire string becomes s. Similarly for the second.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   if a == s:\n        continue   # skip this m\n\n But note: the code has the addition after the if block. So we can do:\n\n   if a == s:\n        continue   # skip the addition for this a\n\n However, the current code has the addition outside the if block. So we can change the code to:\n\n   if a != s:\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But the TODO is inside the if a==s block. Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   if a == s:\n        pass   # do nothing, then skip the addition? But the addition is after.\n   else:\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But the TODO is only for the if block. We can replace the TODO with a 'continue' that breaks out of the inner for-loop for this m? Actually, we are in the inner loop for m. We want to skip the current m and move to the next. But note: we are in the inner loop for m and the next step is to add d1[a]. So we can do:\n\n   if a == s:\n        continue   # skip the current m, so we don't do the addition\n\n But then we skip the addition? That's what we want.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   if a != s:\n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n But the TODO is inside the if a==s block. So we can write:\n\n   if a == s:\n        continue\n   ans1 += d1[a]\n\n However, the current code has the addition after the if block and without an else. So we can simply put a 'continue' in the if block to skip the addition.\n\n Therefore, we can write in the TODO block: \n        continue\n\n But note: the continue will skip the rest of the current iteration of the inner loop (for m) and move to the next m. So the addition for this a (which is s) is skipped.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid generating the same string by not iterating m over the current character? But that would require an extra condition. The current method is acceptable.\n\n However, there is another issue: we are counting the same pair multiple times? Actually, no. For a pair (s, t) that differs in exactly one position, say at the first character. Then when we process s, we will generate t by changing the first character of s to the first character of t. Then we add the frequency of t (which at that time is the count of t we have seen so far). Then when we process t, we will generate s by changing the first character of t to the first character of s? But note: we are processing the strings in order. When we process s, t might not have been seen? Then we don't count the pair (s,t) at that time? Actually, we are iterating in the order of the input. We update d1 after processing the current string. So when we process a string, we look at the frequency of the neighbor strings that have been processed before.\n\n Therefore, each pair (i, j) with i<j is counted exactly once: when we process the j-th string, we look at the frequency of the neighbor strings that have been seen (which includes the i-th string if it is a neighbor). Then we add the frequency (which is the count of the neighbor strings that have been seen so far). Then we update the dictionary for the current string.\n\n So the logic is correct.\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5. The inner loops: for each string, we do 2 * 11 = 22 iterations. So total operations 10^5 * 22 = 2.2e6, which is acceptable.\n\n Therefore, for program1.py, we change the initialization loops to use 108 (so that we have 11 letters) and in the TODO we put 'continue' to skip the same string.\n\n However, the current initialization loops are:\n   for i in range(97,109):   # 109 -> 108? Actually, we want 97 to 107 -> range(97,108)\n   for j in range(97,109):   # same\n\n We change both to 108? Actually, we change the end from 109 to 108? So:\n\n   for i in range(97,108):\n        for j in range(97,108):\n            d1[chr(i)+chr(j)] = 0\n\n But note: the problem says the input strings are from 'a' to 'k', so we are initializing 11*11=121 keys.\n\n And in the neighbor generation:\n   for l in range(2):\n        for m in range(97,108):   # change 109 to 108\n\n Then in the TODO block, we put 'continue'\n\n But wait, the current code has the inner loop for m from 97 to 109. We change that to 97 to 108.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid initializing the dictionary for all possible strings and use a defaultdict. But the problem says the total n over test cases is 10^5, and we are only going to see at most 10^5 distinct strings? Actually, the strings are 2 letters from 11 letters, so at most 121 distinct strings. So initializing 121 keys is acceptable.\n\n However, the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the test cases are independent. The dictionary d1 is created for each test case. The first test case might have n1, the second n2, etc. But the initialization of the dictionary is 121 keys per test case. Since t<=100, total keys initialized is 100*121 = 12100, which is acceptable.\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the number of test cases t can be up to 100. So 100*121 = 12100 is acceptable.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a defaultdict to avoid initializing all keys. But the current code is already written with a dictionary and initializing all. We can change to defaultdict? But the problem says we must fill in the missing code. The missing code is only the TODO block? Actually, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The TODO block is in the inner loop.\n\n But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". The TODO block is the only missing part? Actually, the initialization loops are already written and we are allowed to change them? The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\". But the instructions say: \"Output only the missing code\". And the missing code is indicated by TODO.\n\n However, the initialization loops are incorrect because they use 109 (which gives 12 letters) and we need 11. But the problem says the input only has 11 letters. So we must fix the initialization? But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The TODO block is the only one we are supposed to output? But the problem also says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n Alternatively, the problem might have intended that we use a different approach? But the current approach is:\n\n   We are going to count, for each string s, the number of strings that we have already seen that are at Hamming distance 1 from s.\n\n   We generate all possible strings that are at Hamming distance 1 from s (by changing one character to any letter in the allowed set). Then we add the frequency of that string from the dictionary (which counts the strings we have seen so far). Then we update the dictionary for s.\n\n   This approach is correct.\n\n   The bug is that the initialization and the neighbor generation use 12 letters (from 'a' to 'l') but the input only has 'a' to 'k'. So we must change the loops to 11 letters.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The TODO block is the only missing part? Then we cannot change the loops? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". The initialization loops are already written? We are not allowed to change them? But without changing the loops, the program will fail for keys that are not in the dictionary? Actually, the dictionary is initialized for 12*12=144 keys. The input strings are only 11 letters, so the keys that we see are in the 11*11=121 subset. But when we generate neighbors, we generate strings that might have a letter 'l'? Then we try to access d1[a] for a string that has 'l'. But the dictionary was initialized for 12*12=144 keys? Actually, the initialization loops are:\n\n        for i in range(97,109):   # 97 to 108 -> 12 letters: 'a' to 'l'\n        for j in range(97,109):\n            d1[chr(i)+chr(j)] = 0\n\n   So the keys for strings with 'l' are present (initialized to 0). So we won't get a KeyError. But we are generating neighbors that are not in the allowed set? The problem says the input strings are from 'a' to 'k', so the neighbor with a letter 'l' is not going to appear in the input? But we are generating it. However, the dictionary has that key (with value 0) so it's safe.\n\n   But then we are counting pairs that have a letter 'l'? But the input doesn't have any string with 'l'. So the frequency of any string containing 'l' is 0. So when we do ans1 += d1[a] for a string a that has a letter 'l', we add 0. So it's harmless.\n\n   Therefore, we don't need to change the loops? We can leave the loops as 12 letters? Then the program will work? \n\n   However, the problem says the strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So generating a string with 'l' is not going to match any input string? So the frequency will be 0. So it's safe.\n\n   But the problem says: the strings are from 'a' to 'k'. So we are generating 2 * 12 = 24 neighbors per string? But 12 letters? Actually, 2 positions * 12 letters = 24, but we subtract the two cases where we change to the same letter (so 2 neighbors that are the same as the original). Then we skip those two? Then we have 22 neighbors? But the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters) so we should generate 2 * 11 = 22 neighbors? But we are generating 2 * 12 = 24? Then we skip the two that are the same? Then we have 22? Actually, no: for each position, we generate 12 neighbors? Then we skip one per position (the one that is the same) so we have 11 per position? Then 22 per string? But wait: the current code for the inner loop for m is from 97 to 109 (exclusive) -> 12 values. Then we skip one per position? So we skip 2? Then we have 24 - 2 = 22? That matches the 11*2=22.\n\n   Therefore, the program is correct even with 12 letters? Because the extra letter 'l' will never appear in the input, so the frequency of any neighbor that has 'l' is 0. So we can leave the loops as 12 letters.\n\n   Then the only missing part is the TODO block: we need to skip the addition when a==s.\n\n   So we put: continue\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: continue\n\n   But note: the code after the TODO is: \n        ans1 += d1[a]\n\n   We want to skip that when a==s. So we do:\n\n        if a == s:\n            continue   # skip the current m, so we don't do the addition\n\n   But the TODO block is only one line? Actually, we can write:\n\n        continue\n\n   However, the TODO block is inside the if a==s: block. So we can write:\n\n        continue\n\n   This will break out of the inner for-loop for the current m? Actually, no: the continue applies to the innermost loop, which is the for m loop. So we skip the current m and move to the next.\n\n   That is what we want.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is: continue\n\n But note: the problem says the answer may be large and we must use 64-bit integers. The variable ans1 is being added with integers. In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so we don't need to change the type.\n\n For program2.py:\n\n Description: \n   We are given an array a of n integers. We start with one copy. We can do:\n      Operation 1: clone any existing array.\n      Operation 2: swap any two elements from any two copies (or same copy) at any positions.\n\n   We want the minimal number of operations to obtain a copy where all elements are equal.\n\n   The example: \n        In the first test case: [1,1,1] -> already all equal -> 0 operations.\n        In the second test case: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the example used 6 operations.\n\n   How to solve?\n\n   Observation:\n        We can do a sequence of clones and swaps. We are allowed to swap arbitrarily between copies. We can think: we want to gather k copies of a particular value x in one array. How many operations?\n\n        Note: we start with one copy. Each clone operation adds one copy. Then we can swap arbitrarily. The goal is to have one copy (one array) that is all x.\n\n        How many swaps? Actually, we can use the following:\n\n        Let f(x) be the frequency of x in the original array. We can use multiple copies of the array to gather more copies of x. But note: we can only swap elements between copies.\n\n        We can do:\n\n          Operation 1: clone the array k times. Then we have k+1 copies.\n\n          Then we can swap elements arbitrarily. We want to form one array that has n copies of x. We need n copies of x. The total number of x in all copies is f(x) * (k+1). We require that f(x)*(k+1) >= n.\n\n          How many swaps? Actually, we don't count swaps individually? The problem counts both clone and swap operations. The example: 6 operations: \n                clone (1 op) -> then swap (they did 4 swaps? and then clone again? and then two swaps? total 1 (clone) + 4 (swaps) + 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 8? but the example says 6 operations.\n\n          Actually, the example says:\n                Step 1: create a copy -> 1 op -> now two copies.\n                Then they did swaps: they swapped two zeros from the second copy to the first copy? Actually, the example says: \n                    After that we can swap elements in a way so all zeroes are in one array: \n                    [0,0,0,3,7,0] and [1,1,3,3,7,3] -> they swapped two zeros? How many swaps? one swap moves two zeros? Actually, one swap moves two elements: we swap a zero from the second array with a non-zero in the first array. To move two zeros, we need two swaps? Then they did two swaps? Then total operations: 1 (clone) + 2 (swaps) = 3? Then they cloned the first array: 1 op -> then swapped two more zeros? two swaps? total 1+2+1+2=6.\n\n          So the operations: \n                Operation 1: clone -> 1\n                Operation 2,3: two swaps -> 2\n                Operation 4: clone -> 1\n                Operation 5,6: two swaps -> 2\n\n          Total 6.\n\n        How to compute the minimal operations?\n\n        We note that we start with one copy. We can do k clone operations, so we have k+1 copies. Then we can swap arbitrarily. The key is: we can take elements from any copy to form one copy that is all x.\n\n        The total number of x available is f(x)*(k+1). We need at least n of them. So we require f(x)*(k+1) >= n.\n\n        Then, how many swaps? Actually, we don't need to move the x's that are already in the target copy? We only need to move the non-x elements out and bring x's in? But note: we can swap arbitrarily. The minimal number of swaps to fix one element? Actually, we can think: the target copy initially has some x's and some non-x's. We want to replace the non-x's with x's. The number of non-x's in the target copy is n - (number of x's in the target copy). But we can choose which copy to use as the target? and we can also choose which x's to use? \n\n        Actually, we can choose any copy to become the all-x copy. We are going to gather n x's in that copy. How many x's are already in that copy? We don't know. But we can choose the initial copy that has the most x's? Actually, we can choose any copy to be the target. The best is to choose the copy that initially has the most x's? But note: all copies are identical initially. So we can choose any.\n\n        Actually, the copies are identical at the beginning. But after swaps, they become different. However, we can plan arbitrarily.\n\n        Alternate approach:\n\n          We note that we can form an all-x copy if and only if the total number of x's in all copies is at least n. Since we have k+1 copies, the total number of x's is f(x)*(k+1). So we require f(x)*(k+1) >= n.\n\n          Then, how many swaps? Actually, we need to move the x's from the other copies to the target copy. But also, we need to move the non-x's out of the target copy. However, we can swap a non-x in the target copy with an x in another copy. Each such swap fixes one element: it brings one x into the target copy and removes one non-x. \n\n          How many such swaps do we need? The target copy initially has, say, c x's. Then we need n - c x's to be brought in. And we need to remove n - c non-x's. But each swap does both: we swap a non-x from the target with an x from another copy. So we need exactly n - c swaps.\n\n          But note: we can choose the target copy arbitrarily? Actually, we can choose the copy that initially has the most x's to be the target? But initially, all copies are identical. So every copy has f(x) x's? Actually, no: we start with one copy. Then we clone, so we have two identical copies. Then we swap, so they become different. But initially, when we choose the target, we can choose the one that we are going to fix. We are free to choose any. The best is to leave the other copies to hold the non-x elements.\n\n          Therefore, the target copy initially has f(x) x's. Then we need to bring n - f(x) x's from the other copies. And we need to remove n - f(x) non-x's from the target copy. Each swap (between the target copy and another copy) can fix one element. So we need n - f(x) swaps.\n\n          But wait: we have k+1 copies. The target copy is one of them. The other k copies have a total of f(x)*k x's. We need to take n - f(x) x's from them. We require that f(x)*(k+1) >= n, so f(x)*k >= n - f(x). So we have enough.\n\n          Therefore, the total operations: \n                k (clone operations) + (n - f(x)) (swap operations)\n\n          Then we want to minimize the total operations: k + (n - f(x)).\n\n          But k is the smallest integer such that f(x)*(k+1) >= n.\n\n          So for a fixed x, we have:\n                k_min = ceil(n / f(x)) - 1   [because k+1 >= ceil(n/f(x))]\n\n          Then total operations = (ceil(n/f(x)) - 1) + (n - f(x))\n\n          But wait: is that correct? Let's test with the example.\n\n          Example: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> n=6. Let x=0. f(0)=2.\n                k_min = ceil(6/2) - 1 = ceil(3) - 1 = 3-1 = 2.\n                total operations = 2 + (6-2) = 2+4 = 6. -> matches.\n\n          Another example: if the array is already all x, then f(x)=n. Then k_min = ceil(n/n)-1 = 1-1=0. Then operations=0. -> correct.\n\n          But what if we choose a different x? For example, in [0,1,3,3,7,0], if we choose x=3? f(3)=2. Then:\n                k_min = ceil(6/2)-1 = 3-1=2, operations=2+(6-2)=6.\n\n          But what if we choose x=1? f(1)=1. Then:\n                k_min = ceil(6/1)-1 = 6-1=5, operations=5+(6-1)=10.\n\n          So we want the minimal operations over all x that appears in the array.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            For a test case:\n                n = ... \n                a = list of n integers.\n\n                Let freq = frequency of each distinct number.\n\n                Then, for each distinct number x that appears, let f = freq[x].\n                We require k_min = ceil(n / f) - 1, and then total_ops = k_min + (n - f)\n\n                Then we take the minimum total_ops over all x.\n\n          But note: we must have at least one copy? and we start with one copy. The condition f(x)*(k+1) >= n must hold. Our k_min is the minimal k such that f*(k+1) >= n.\n\n          How to compute ceil(n/f)? We can do: \n                k_min = (n + f - 1) // f - 1   ? But note: k_min = ceil(n/f) - 1.\n\n          Alternatively: \n                if n % f == 0:\n                    k_min = n//f - 1\n                else:\n                    k_min = n//f   # because ceil(n/f) = n//f + 1? no: ceil(n/f) = (n+f-1)//f\n\n          Actually: ceil(n/f) = (n+f-1) // f   (for positive integers)\n\n          Then k_min = (n+f-1)//f - 1.\n\n          Then total_ops = (n+f-1)//f - 1 + (n - f)\n\n          We can simplify? \n                = (n+f-1)//f + n - f - 1\n\n          But we don't need to simplify.\n\n          However, note: what if f > n? That cannot happen because f is the frequency in the array of n elements.\n\n          But what if f==0? Then we skip.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py:\n\n            from collections import Counter\n            for a in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                n = ...   # already given: n=len(a.split())? but note: the next line: a = a.split() -> then n = len(a) -> that is the number of elements? but the array has n integers. So that is correct.\n\n            But the current code:\n\n                from collections import*\n                for a in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                    n=len(a:=a.split());   # here a becomes the list of strings of the integers? and n is the length? correct.\n                    m=max(Counter(a).values());   # m is the maximum frequency of any element? but we are going to iterate over all distinct elements? but the problem says we can choose any x. The minimal operations might come from the element with the maximum frequency? \n\n            Actually, note: the total_ops = (n+f-1)//f - 1 + (n - f) = (n+f-1)//f + n - f - 1.\n\n            We want to minimize this over f (for each distinct element, f is the frequency). \n\n            How does it behave? \n                As f increases, the term (n+f-1)//f decreases, and the term (n-f) also decreases? \n\n            Actually, we should try to maximize f? because the larger f is, the smaller the total_ops.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal total_ops is achieved when f is the maximum frequency? \n\n            Why? Let f1 and f2 with f1>f2.\n\n            total_ops(f1) = (n+f1-1)//f1 + n - f1 - 1\n            total_ops(f2) = (n+f2-1)//f2 + n - f2 - 1\n\n            Since f1>f2, then (n+f1-1)//f1 <= (n+f2-1)//f2? because ceil(n/f) is decreasing as f increases. And n-f1-1 < n-f2-1? So both terms are smaller for f1.\n\n            Therefore, we only need to consider the element with the maximum frequency? \n\n            Then the current code: \n                m = max(Counter(a).values())\n                r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            Then we print r.\n\n            How to compute the total_ops for the element with frequency m?\n\n                total_ops = (n + m - 1) // m - 1 + (n - m)\n\n            But note: the example: n=6, m=2 -> \n                (6+2-1)//2 = (7//2)=3 -> then 3-1=2, then 2+(6-2)=6.\n\n            How to simulate the operations? The current code uses a while loop and increments r? \n\n            The problem: we are to output the minimal number of operations.\n\n            The current code:\n\n                r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    ...   # we do something and update r and m?\n\n            But we don't need to simulate? We have a formula.\n\n            Alternatively, we can think greedily:\n\n                We start with one copy. We have m (the max frequency) in the array. We need to get n copies of the element in one array.\n\n                Step 1: we can clone the array -> then we have two copies. Then we can swap: we can take one element from the second copy to the first? But we can only swap. To get one more element in the first copy, we need to swap an element that is not the desired element from the first copy with the desired element from the second copy. This takes one swap. But we can do multiple swaps? \n\n                Actually, after one clone, we have two copies. Then we can do up to m swaps? because the second copy has m copies of the element? But we can only take min(m, n-m) from the second copy? \n\n                Then we update: the first copy now has m + min(m, n-m) = min(2*m, n) of the element? \n\n                Then we do another clone? Then we have three copies. Then we can take min(m, n - min(2*m, n)) from the third copy? \n\n                This is complicated.\n\n            But we have a formula: total_ops = (n+m-1)//m - 1 + (n - m)\n\n            However, note: the formula uses the element with frequency m. And we are not iterating over other elements? because we know that the element with the maximum frequency gives the minimal operations.\n\n            Therefore, we can compute:\n\n                k_min = (n+m-1)//m - 1\n                total_ops = k_min + (n - m)\n\n            But note: the current code has a while loop. How can we break the while loop? Actually, we don't need a while loop? We can compute r directly.\n\n            The current code:\n\n                r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    ...   # we are going to do operations until we have one copy with all equal.\n\n            How to update? \n\n            The example in the note: \n                Initially: m=2, n=6 -> we enter the loop.\n\n            How many operations? We know the answer is 6. How to simulate?\n\n            We can simulate the process:\n\n                We have one copy: [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> m=2 (max frequency of 0 or 3 is 2). We need to get one copy with 6 zeros.\n\n                Operation 1: clone -> now two copies. r=1. Then we can swap: we can swap two non-zeros in the first copy with two zeros in the second copy. Then the first copy becomes [0,0,3,3,7,0] -> now it has 3 zeros? Actually, we can swap two zeros from the second copy to the first copy? But the first copy already has two zeros. We can swap two non-zeros (the 1 and the 7) with two zeros from the second copy? Then the first copy becomes [0,0,3,3,0,0] -> 4 zeros. Then we can do another clone? Then we have three copies. Then we can swap two more zeros from the third copy to the first copy? Then the first copy becomes 6 zeros.\n\n                How many operations? \n                    clone: 1 op -> then two swaps: 2 ops -> then clone: 1 op -> then two swaps: 2 ops -> total 6.\n\n                How to simulate in the loop?\n\n                Alternatively, we can use the known formula and break out? But the problem says we must fill the TODO block.\n\n            The intended solution in the note: \n\n                We note that after k clone operations, we have k+1 copies. Then we can get up to m*(k+1) copies of the element. We need at least n. Then the number of swaps is the number of non-element in the target copy? which is n - m (if we choose the copy that originally had the most) but wait: after k clones, we have k+1 copies. The target copy initially has m, and we can bring from the other k copies: we can bring min(m*k, n-m) from the other copies? \n\n                Actually, we can bring at most m*k from the other copies? because each of the k copies has m. Then the total we can have in the target copy is m + min(m*k, n-m). We require m + min(m*k, n-m) >= n.\n\n                Then we want the minimal k such that m + m*k >= n   -> then k >= ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(n/m - 1) = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n\n                Then k_min = ceil((n-m)/m)   if n-m>0? but if n==m, then k_min=0.\n\n                Then total_ops = k_min (clone operations) + (n - m) (swaps)   -> but wait, we don't need to do n-m swaps? because we can get up to m*k_min from the other copies? but we only need n-m? and we can get that in one swap per element? so we need n-m swaps.\n\n                Then total_ops = ceil((n-m)/m) + (n-m)   [if n>m, else 0]\n\n                But ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil((n/m) - 1) = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n\n                Actually: ceil((n-m)/m) = ceil(n/m - 1) = ceil(n/m) - 1? \n\n                Example: n=6, m=2 -> ceil((6-2)/2)=ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2. Then total_ops=2+4=6.\n\n                But also: ceil(6/2)=3, then ceil(6/2)-1=2 -> same.\n\n                Therefore, we can write: \n                    k_min = ceil((n-m)/m)   [if n>m] \n                    total_ops = k_min + (n-m)\n\n                But note: if n==m, then we don't need any operation -> 0.\n\n            How to compute ceil((n-m)/m)? \n                = (n-m + m - 1) // m   = (n-1) // m   ? \n\n                But: ceil(a) = (a + denominator - 1) // denominator? for positive a? \n                Here a = (n-m)/m, denominator = 1? Actually, we are in integers? \n\n                We can do: \n                    k_min = (n-m-1)//m + 1   if (n-m) % m != 0 then ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m-1)//m + 1, but if (n-m)%m==0 then ceil((n-m)/m) = (n-m)//m.\n\n                Alternatively: \n                    k_min = (n-m + m-1) // m   = (n-1) // m   -> but let's test: n=6, m=2: (6-1)//2 = 5//2 = 2 -> correct.\n\n                Then total_ops = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n            Therefore, we can set:\n\n                r = (n-1)//m + (n-m)\n\n            But wait: if n==m, then (n-1)//m = (m-1)//m = 0 (if m>1) or (0)//1=0? and (n-m)=0, so r=0. Correct.\n\n            Then we break the while loop? Actually, we don't need the while loop? We can set r and break? But the while loop condition is while m<n. So we enter only when m<n. Then we set r = (n-1)//m + (n-m) and then break? But the while loop is designed to run until m>=n? \n\n            Alternatively, we can simulate the process in the while loop? \n\n            The note in the example: \n                \"It can be proven that no fewer operations are enough.\"\n\n            How about we do:\n\n                r = 0\n                current_m = m\n                while current_m < n:\n                    # We do one clone: then we have one more copy. Then we can swap: we can take min(current_m, n - current_m) from the new copy? \n                    # But note: we can also use previously cloned copies? Actually, we are building the copies one by one.\n\n                    # After a clone, we have one more copy. Then we can swap up to current_m times (because the new copy has current_m of the element) to the target copy? But we can only take min(current_m, n - current_m) from the new copy? \n\n                    # Then we update the target copy: current_m = current_m + min(current_m, n - current_m)\n\n                    # And we count: 1 (for clone) + min(current_m, n - current_m) (for swaps) -> then add to r.\n\n                    # But note: we are updating current_m? and then we break when current_m>=n.\n\n                    # Example: n=6, m=2.\n                    #   Step1: clone -> r += 1, then we can swap min(2, 6-2)=min(2,4)=2 -> then current_m becomes 2+2=4, and r becomes 1+2=3.\n                    #   Then we do another clone: r += 1 -> 4, then swap min(4, 6-4)=min(4,2)=2 -> current_m becomes 4+2=6, r becomes 4+2=6. -> then break.\n\n                    # This matches.\n\n                    # How about n=3, m=1: \n                    #   Step1: clone -> r=1, swap min(1,3-1)=min(1,2)=1 -> current_m=1+1=2, r=1+1=2.\n                    #   Step2: clone -> r=3, swap min(2,3-2)=min(2,1)=1 -> current_m=2+1=3, r=3+1=4.\n\n                    # But what is the minimal operations? \n                    #   We start with [a,b,c] (all distinct). \n                    #   Operation1: clone -> two copies: [a,b,c] and [a,b,c]\n                    #   Operation2: swap a from the second copy with b in the first copy: first copy becomes [a,a,c], second becomes [b,b,c] -> then we need to fix the first copy: we need two more a's? \n                    #   Operation3: clone the first copy? -> third copy: [a,a,c]\n                    #   Operation4: swap a from the third copy with c in the first copy: first copy becomes [a,a,a] -> done. -> 4 operations.\n\n                    # But our formula: \n                    #   total_ops = (n-1)//m + (n-m) = (3-1)//1 + (3-1) = 2 + 2 = 4. -> matches.\n\n                    # Therefore, we can simulate:\n\n                    #   Let current = m\n                    #   while current < n:\n                    #       r += 1   # for the clone\n                    #       # How many swaps? we can take at most current (from the new clone) and we need n - current, so we take t = min(current, n - current)\n                    #       r += t\n                    #       current += t\n\n                    # Then break when current>=n.\n\n            Therefore, in the TODO block, we can do:\n\n                t = min(m, n - m)   # but note: we are updating m? Actually, the variable m is the current frequency in the target copy? But the current code uses m for the maximum frequency initially. We are going to update m? \n\n            The current code:\n\n                r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We can update m? \n\n            But note: the variable m is defined as the initial maximum frequency. We cannot change it? \n\n            Actually, the current code:\n\n                m = max(Counter(a).values())\n\n            Then we set r=0 and then the while loop. We need to update a variable that represents the current number of the desired element in the target copy. Let's call it cur. But the problem says we must use minimal code. We can reassign m? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a temporary variable? But the problem says we must fill the TODO block. We can do:\n\n                # We are going to use m to represent the current count? \n\n            But the initial m is the maximum frequency. Then we update:\n\n                r = 0\n                cur = m\n                while cur < n:\n                    # do one clone: r += 1\n                    # then we can swap: we can take up to cur from the new clone? so we take t = min(cur, n - cur)\n                    r += 1   # for the clone\n                    t = min(cur, n - cur)\n                    r += t\n                    cur += t\n\n            Then we break when cur>=n.\n\n            But the current code does not have a variable cur. We can reassign m? \n\n            Since we are in the loop for a test case, we can do:\n\n                m0 = m   # the initial max frequency\n                cur = m0\n                r = 0\n                while cur < n:\n                    r += 1\n                    t = min(cur, n - cur)\n                    r += t\n                    cur += t\n\n            But the problem says: minimal code. And we are only allowed to fill the TODO block? The TODO block is inside the while loop. We cannot change the code outside the TODO block? \n\n            The current code:\n\n                r=0\n                while m<n:\n                    ...   # TODO\n\n            We cannot change the condition? We cannot introduce new variables? \n\n            Alternatively, we can update m? because after we break the loop, we don't need the initial m anymore. So we can do:\n\n                # In the TODO block, we do:\n                #   We do one clone: so we add 1 to r.\n                #   Then we can swap: we can take min(m, n-m) from the new clone? \n                #   Then we update: m = m + min(m, n-m)\n                #   And we add min(m, n-m) to r? but note: we are updating m for the next iteration.\n\n                r += 1   # for the clone\n                t = min(m, n - m)   # the number of swaps we do in this step\n                r += t\n                m += t   # now the target copy has m + t\n\n            Then the while condition: while m<n: will break when m>=n.\n\n            Example: n=6, m=2 initially.\n                Iteration1:\n                    r=0 -> then we enter the loop.\n                    r += 1 -> r=1\n                    t = min(2,4)=2\n                    r += 2 -> r=3\n                    m = 2+2=4\n                Then check: 4<6 -> true, so next iteration:\n                    r += 1 -> r=4\n                    t = min(4,2)=2\n                    r += 2 -> r=6\n                    m = 4+2=6 -> break.\n\n            This matches.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO block for program2.py is:\n\n                r += 1\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += t\n                m += t\n\n            But note: the variable t is not defined? We can do:\n\n                r += 1\n                swaps = min(m, n - m)\n                r += swaps\n                m += swaps\n\n            Alternatively, we can do without a temporary variable? \n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n                m += min(m, n-m)\n\n            But we are updating m.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                r += 1\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += t\n                m += t\n\n            Or in a compact form:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n                m += min(m, n-m)\n\n            But note: we need to update m? and we do the same min(m, n-m) twice? We can compute it once and store? But the problem does not require efficiency? The while loop runs at most O(log n) iterations? because m doubles each time? \n\n            Actually, m starts at m0 (the max frequency) and then becomes m0 + min(m0, n-m0) = min(2*m0, n). Then next: min(2*m0, n) + min(min(2*m0, n), n - min(2*m0, n)) = min(2*m0, n) + min(2*m0, n, n-2*m0) ... but actually, if m0>=n/2, then we break in one step? \n\n            But worst-case: m0=1, then we do: \n                step1: m becomes 1+min(1, n-1)=1+1=2\n                step2: m becomes 2+min(2, n-2)=min(4, n)   [if n>2]\n                step3: m becomes 4+min(4, n-4)=min(8, n)\n                ... until m>=n.\n\n            The number of steps is O(log n). So it's acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, we can write:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n                m += min(m, n-m)\n\n            But note: we are updating m and then the while condition will check the updated m.\n\n            So the code for program2.py in the TODO block is:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n            However, we compute min(m, n-m) twice. We can store it in a variable? But the problem does not require. We can do:\n\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + t\n                m += t\n\n            This is more efficient? But the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, and the while loop runs O(log n) per test case, so it's acceptable.\n\n            But the problem says: the total n over test cases <= 10^5. The worst-case for one test case: n=10^5, m0=1, then the while loop runs about 17 iterations (because 2^17 > 10^5). And the total n over test cases is 10^5, but the total number of test cases t is the first integer. The constraint: t up to 10000, but the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5. So the number of test cases is at most 10^5? but the first line says t (number of test cases) and the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5. So the maximum number of test cases is 10^5? but t<=10000. And the sum of n<=10^5. So the worst-case total number of iterations in the while loops over all test cases is 10^5 * 17? which is 1.7e6, acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                t_val = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + t_val\n                m += t_val\n\n            But the problem says: minimal code. We can do without a temporary variable? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n-m)\n                m += min(m, n-m)\n\n            But we compute min(m, n-m) twice. It's acceptable.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". So we output the three lines? \n\n            But note: the TODO block is one block? We can write multiple lines.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n            But wait: what if we do:\n\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + min(m, n - m)   # but then the min(m, n-m) is after updating m? and we use the updated m? that would be different.\n\n            We must do:\n\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + t\n                m += t\n\n            Or:\n\n                r += 1\n                r += min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n            But that computes min(m, n-m) twice. We can do:\n\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + t\n                m += t\n\n            This is safe.\n\n            We choose the safe version: use a temporary variable to avoid computing twice.\n\n            But the problem does not require efficiency? and the min is O(1). So we can do without. But to be safe, we do:\n\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + t\n                m += t\n\n            However, the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n            We output the three lines for the TODO block.\n\n            But note: the while loop condition is while m<n. We are updating m inside the loop. Then the next iteration will use the updated m.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                t = min(m, n - m)\n                r += 1 + t\n                m += t\n\n            But the variable t is not defined? We can use any variable? But the code does not have t defined. We can use a new variable? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do without a temporary variable? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                r = r + 1 + min(m, n - m)\n                m = m + min(m, n - m)\n\n            But that computes min(m, n-m) twice. It's acceptable.\n\n            We choose the two-line version without temporary variable? \n\n            But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 10^5, and the while loop runs O(log n) per test case, so the total min operations is O(10^5 * log(10^5))? which is about 10^5 * 17 = 1.7e6, acceptable.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n            This is two lines.\n\n            But note: the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". We can output two lines.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n            However, we must be cautious: the expression min(m, n-m) is computed twice. What if the first min(m, n-m) is t1 and the second is t2? But between the two lines, m is not updated? So they are the same.\n\n            So it's safe.\n\n            Therefore, the answer for program2.py is:\n\n                r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\n                m += min(m, n - m)\n\n            But note: the problem says the array a is given as a string? and we did:\n\n                n = len(a:=a.split())\n\n            Then m = max(Counter(a).values())\n\n            This m is the maximum frequency of the string representation? But the array elements are integers, but we read as string? \n\n            Example: the array [0,1,3,3,7,0] -> the strings: ['0','1','3','3','7','0'] -> then m = frequency of '3'? which is 2? correct.\n\n            So it's okay.\n\n            Therefore, the final answer:\n\n            program1: \"continue\"\n            program2: two lines: \n                \"    r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\"\n                \"    m += min(m, n - m)\"\n\n            But note: the TODO block in program1 is one line: \"continue\", and in program2 is two lines.\n\n            We output in JSON:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"continue\",\n                \"program2\": \"    r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\\n    m += min(m, n - m)\"\n            }\n\n            But note: the program2 code must be indented? The while loop body. We output the two lines with the same indentation as the TODO block? The TODO block is at the same level as the while. So we output 4 spaces for each line? But the problem does not specify the indentation. However, the existing code in program2 has:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            So the TODO is at the same line. We are replacing the TODO with two lines. We must indent the two lines.\n\n            Alternatively, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We output the two lines with the same indentation as the while loop body.\n\n            Since the while loop body is not indented in the given code? Actually, the given code:\n\n                while m<n:# TODO: Your code here\n\n            Then we need to write the body of the while loop. We can write:\n\n                while m<n:\n                    r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\n                    m += min(m, n - m)\n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We output the two lines, and we must indent them? \n\n            In the JSON string, we represent the two lines with a newline and the same indentation? \n\n            But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces? \n\n            We output:\n\n                \"program2\": \"    r += 1 + min(m, n - m)\\n    m += min(m, n - m)\"\n\n            This uses 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a tab? But the problem uses spaces.\n\n            We use 4 spaces.\n\n            Therefore, the final answer.\n\n            But wait: what if the while loop runs more than one iteration? The condition is while m<n. We update m to m + min(m, n-m). Then we check again. The condition is at the beginning of the loop. So it will run until m>=n.\n\n            This matches the simulation.\n\n            So we are done."
