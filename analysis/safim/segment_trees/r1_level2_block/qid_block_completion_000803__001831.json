For n>=2, we output the swaps as above. However, we can do the same method for n=1? We can do:\n\n                from sys import stdin\n                t = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                for i in range(t):\n                    n = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                    m = (n+1)//2\n                    print(m)\n                    for i3 in range(m):\n                        idx1 = 3*i3 + 1\n                        idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                        print(f\"{idx1 +1} {idx2+1}\") Then for n=1: \n                m = (1+1)//2 = 1\n                then i3=0: \n                    idx1 = 1, idx2=2 -> output 2 and 3. The problem accepts any? But the problem example for n=1 in the note did 1 and 2? The problem says: output any. However, the problem example in the provided code for n=1 is 1 and 2? We can change the method for n=1 to output 1 and 2? How? We can do:\n\n                for i3 in range(m):\n                    if n==1:\n                        # then we output 1 and 2\n                        print(\"1 2\")\n                    else: idx1 = 3*i3 + 1\n                        idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                        print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\") But then for n=1, we do one operation: and we output \"1 2\". But note: the indices: \n                For n=1: \n                    The string is \"BAN\" (3 characters). Swapping index0 and index1: \n                        index0: 'B' -> becomes 'A'\n                        index1: 'A' -> becomes 'B'\n                    Then we get \"ABN\", which is acceptable. So we can do:\n\n                from sys import stdin\n                t = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                for i in range(t):\n                    n = int(stdin.readline().strip()) m = (n+1)//2\n                    print(m)\n                    for i3 in range(m):\n                        if n == 1:\n                            print(\"1 2\")\n                        else:\n                            idx1 = 3*i3 + 1\n                            idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                            print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            But note: for n=1, we are in the loop for i3 in range(1): so we do one iteration, and then we output \"1 2\".

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the total weight eaten by Alice (from the left) equals the total weight eaten by Bob (from the right). We are to output that total number of candies (which is the count, not the weight) for each test case.\n\nThe provided code in program1.py sets up two pointers (i at the left, j at the right) and two sums (lsum and rsum). It then moves the pointers until they meet. The idea is to try to balance the two sums. When the sums are equal, we have a candidate for the total candies eaten (which is i+1 from the left and n-j from the right, so total (i+1) + (n-j)). We then update the best candidate and move both pointers to continue.\n\nHowever, the provided code has a TODO in the else branch (when lsum == rsum). We need to complete that part and also ensure we break appropriately.\n\nWe note that the problem asks for the maximum total number of candies. So when we have an equal sum, we record the total candies (i+1 + n-j) and then we must move at least one pointer to continue searching (because there might be a longer sequence with a larger total count? Actually, note: we are moving from the outside in, and we want to maximize the total count. However, if we have an equal sum, we can record that and then try to move both pointers to see if we can get another equal sum with more candies? But note: we are moving from the outside in, so the total candies we have at the moment is (i+1) + (n-j). If we move both pointers, we are going to add one more candy on the left and one more on the right, but then the sums will change. We cannot assume that we can get a longer sequence because the total candies we are going to get in the next step would be (i+2) + (n-j-1) = (i+1) + (n-j) + 1? Actually, no: because we are moving both, we are adding one candy on the left and removing one from the right? Actually, we are moving the left pointer to the right (so adding the next candy to the left sum) and the right pointer to the left (so adding the next candy to the right sum). But note: the current state is at indices i and j. Then we do:\n  i moves to i+1: then we add arr[i+1] to lsum.\n  j moves to j-1: then we add arr[j-1] to rsum.\n\nBut wait, the current state has lsum and rsum equal. Then we move both and update. However, the problem is that we are trying to maximize the total count. The current state is a candidate. Then we can continue to see if we can get a larger total? But note: the total candies we have so far is (i+1) from the left and (n-j) from the right. If we move both pointers, we are going to cover one more candy on the left and one more on the right, so the total becomes (i+2) + (n-j-1) = (i+1) + (n-j) + 1? Actually, no: because we are moving the left pointer to the next (so we are going to have i+1 candies on the left) and the right pointer to the next (so we are going to have n - (j-1) = n - j + 1 candies on the right). But note: the candies in the middle (from i+1 to j-1) are not eaten. So the total candies eaten becomes (i+1) + (n - j + 1) = (i+1 + n - j) + 1. So we are increasing by one.\n\nBut we must note: we are going to add the next candy on the left and the next candy on the right. However, we don't know if the sums will become equal again. So we should record the current candidate and then move both pointers to try to get a longer sequence.\n\nSo in the else branch:\n  best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))   # because we have i+1 candies on the left and n-j candies on the right\n  Then we move both pointers: i += 1 and j -= 1, and update the sums? But note: we must update the sums by adding the new candy at i+1 and j-1? However, we are going to break the condition? Actually, the code then continues the while loop.\n\nBut what if we move both pointers and then one of them goes beyond the other? We have to be cautious.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  best = max(best, (i+1) + (n - j))\n  Then we do:\n      i += 1\n      lsum += arr[i]   # but note: we are at index i, then we move to i+1 and add arr[i+1]? But we are at index i currently, so the next is i+1.\n      j -= 1\n      rsum += arr[j]   # similarly, we are at j, then we move to j-1 and add arr[j-1]? But note: the current j is already included. We are going to move j to j-1 and then add the candy at j-1? Actually, we are going to add the candy at the new j (which is j-1). But note: we are going to add the same candy that we are about to step on? Actually, we are going to move the pointer and then add the value at the new pointer.\n\nBut wait: the current state has lsum and rsum including the candies at i and j. Then we move i to i+1 and j to j-1, and then we add the new candy at i (which is the next one) and the new candy at j (which is the next one from the right). However, we must note that the while condition is i < j. So we are safe as long as i+1 and j-1 are within bounds? But when we do i+1, we might get i==j? Then we break.\n\nBut also, what if after moving, i becomes j? Then we break and we don't process. But we have already updated the candidate.\n\nHowever, there is a problem: if we update the sums by adding the new candies, then we break the invariant? Actually, we are starting from the current state (with lsum and rsum equal) and then we add one more on the left and one more on the right. Then we continue the while loop which will adjust until the sums become equal again? But note: we are not guaranteed that we can get a longer sequence. We are just continuing the search.\n\nBut the problem: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we must do it in O(n) per test case? Actually, the note says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can do a two-pointer in O(n) per test case? Actually, the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so we can do a while loop that runs at most n steps per test case? But note: the while loop runs until i < j, and each step we move at least one pointer, so total steps per test case is O(n). And the total n over test cases is 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\nBut note: the provided code does not update the sums when we are in the else branch? We have to update the sums? Actually, the code in the else branch only does the TODO. We must update the sums and the pointers.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  best = (i+1) + (n - j)   # and then update best = max(best, ...) but we are going to record the maximum total candies? Actually, we are traversing from the outside in, and the total candies we get when we have an equal sum is (i+1 + n - j). And as we move in, the total candies we can get might be less? Actually, we are starting from the outside and moving in, so the total candies we get when we have an equal sum is decreasing? But note: we are adding more candies? Actually, we start with:\n      i=0, j=n-1: lsum = arr[0], rsum = arr[n-1]\n      Then we move until we get an equal sum. Then we record the total candies (which is 1+1=2). Then we move both pointers: i becomes 1, j becomes n-2. Then we add arr[1] to lsum and arr[n-2] to rsum. Then we continue. Then if we get an equal sum again, the total candies would be (2) [from left: indices0,1] and (2) [from right: indices n-1, n-2] so total 4. So we are increasing the total candies? Actually, no: because we are moving the pointers inward, we are including more candies? But note: we started with 2 candies (one from each side) and then we are going to have 2 from the left and 2 from the right? That's 4. So we are increasing.\n\nBut wait: the problem is that we are not necessarily getting an increasing total? We are just traversing. However, we want the maximum total candies. So we should update best whenever we get an equal sum.\n\nSo the plan for the else branch:\n    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)   # because we have i+1 from the left and n-j from the right\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    # But we must update the sums? But note: we are going to break the condition? Actually, we are going to add the next candy on the left and the next candy on the right? But wait: we are moving the pointers and then we are going to add the new candies? However, the next iteration will check the condition. But we must update the sums only if we are not going out of bounds? Actually, we break the while loop when i>=j, so we should update the sums only if i < j? But we are about to continue the loop? Actually, we can update the sums only if i and j are still in bounds? But note: we are moving i to i+1 and j to j-1. Then we must check if i < j? Actually, the while condition will check at the next iteration. But we must update the sums only if we are still in bounds? Actually, we can update the sums and then the while condition will break if i>=j.\n\nBut what if we move i and j such that i becomes j? Then we break and we don't do anything. But if we move and i becomes less than j, then we add the new candy at i to lsum and the new candy at j to rsum? But note: we haven't added them yet. So we must do:\n\n    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:   # we can add the next candies? But note: we are going to continue the loop and the next iteration will check the condition. However, we haven't updated the sums for the new i and j? So we must update the sums? But the current lsum and rsum are for the old i and j. Now we have moved, so we need to add the new candies? Actually, no: because we are going to do the next iteration and we haven't included the new candies. So we must update the sums.\n\nBut wait: the current lsum is the sum from index0 to index i (the old i). Now we move i to i+1, so we need to add arr[i] (the new i) to lsum? Actually, the old i was the current left pointer. We then move to i+1, so we are going to include the candy at i+1? But we haven't included it yet. So we do:\n\n    lsum += arr[i]   # but wait, we have already moved i to i+1? Then we are at the new i? So we do:\n\n    i += 1\n    lsum += arr[i]   # but what if i is now beyond the array? We have the condition i<j, so we are safe? Actually, we have i < j at the moment we update? But we did i+=1, so if i was j-1, then i becomes j, and then we break the while loop? So we don't update the sums? Actually, we break the while loop after the else branch? So we don't update the sums? Then we break.\n\nBut we must update the sums only if we are going to continue? Actually, we can do:\n\n    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut what if i==j? Then we break and we don't update the sums? That's fine.\n\nBut what if we break the condition? Then we break the loop? Actually, the while condition is at the top: while i < j. So after we update i and j, if i>=j, we break.\n\nAlternatively, we can update the sums without the if? But if i==j, then we don't have a j to update? Actually, we do j-=1, so j becomes j-1. Then we can update rsum only if j>=0? But we have the condition that i and j are within [0, n-1]. Actually, we are moving i from 0 to n-1 and j from n-1 to 0. So we can update the sums only if i < n and j>=0? But we have i<j at the beginning of the loop? Actually, we are updating i and j and then we break the loop if i>=j. So we don't need to update the sums if i>=j? Because we break.\n\nBut note: we are going to break the loop after the else branch? Actually, the else branch is inside the while loop. After we update i and j, we break the loop? No, we just finish the current iteration and then the while condition is checked again. So we can update the sums only if we are going to continue? Actually, we don't need to update the sums? Because the next iteration will not run if i>=j. But if i<j, then we must update the sums? Actually, no: because the next iteration will start and then we will check the condition. But the condition is lsum vs rsum. And we haven't updated the sums for the new i and j? So we must update the sums.\n\nSo we do:\n\n    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut what if we break the condition? Then we break the loop? Actually, the while condition is checked at the beginning of the next iteration. So if i>=j, we break. So we don't need to update the sums? Because we break. But if we break, we don't need the sums? So we can do:\n\n    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: what if we are at the last step? For example, n=3: [1,2,1]. \n  Initially: i=0, j=2 -> lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0+1 + 3-2 = 1+1=2.\n  Then we update: i=1, j=1 -> then we break the while loop? Because i==j? Then we don't update the sums? That's correct.\n\nBut what if we have n=4: [1,2,2,1]. \n  Step1: i=0, j=3: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 1+ (4-3) = 1+1=2? Actually, 1 (from left) and 1 (from right) -> total 2.\n  Then we update: i=1, j=2 -> then we update lsum += arr[1] -> 1+2=3, rsum += arr[2] -> 1+2=3 -> then we enter the while loop again? Then we have lsum==rsum again -> then we update best = max(2, 2+ (4-2))? \n      Now: left: we have eaten indices0,1 -> 2 candies; right: we have eaten indices3,2 -> 2 candies? But note: the right part: we started from the right, so we ate index3 first, then index2? So total from right: 2 candies. Then total candies = 2+2=4.\n      Then we update: i=2, j=1 -> then i>j -> break.\n\nSo we get best=4.\n\nBut wait: the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. They cannot eat the same candy. So in [1,2,2,1]: \n  Alice eats [1,2] -> total 3, Bob eats [2,1] -> total 3? But note: the second candy from the right is the one at index2? But the array is [1,2,2,1]. So Bob eats the last two: [1,2] (from the right: first the last candy (index3:1) then the next (index2:2))? So Bob's total is 1+2=3. And Alice's total is 1+2=3. And they have eaten 4 candies.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nBut what if we don't update the sums? Then in the next iteration, we would have lsum=1 and rsum=1, and then we would do the same? But we have moved the pointers? So we must update the sums.\n\nSo the code for the else branch:\n\n    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: what if we have an equal sum and then we move the pointers and then we break? Then we don't update the sums? That's okay because we break.\n\nBut what if we have an equal sum and then we move the pointers and then we are still in the loop? Then we update the sums? Then we continue.\n\nBut note: what if we have an equal sum and then we move the pointers and then we are still in the loop, but then we don't have an if condition to update the sums? Then the next iteration will use the old lsum and rsum? That would be wrong. So we must update the sums.\n\nBut wait: the provided code does not update the sums in the other branches? Actually, the other branches update the sums when they move the pointer? \n\nIn the if branch (lsum < rsum):\n    i += 1\n    lsum += arr[i]\n\nIn the elif branch (rsum < lsum):\n    j -= 1\n    rsum += arr[j]\n\nSo we are updating the sums when we move a pointer. Similarly, in the else branch we must update the sums for the new pointers? But note: in the else branch we are moving both pointers. So we must update both sums? But we are moving both pointers? So we do:\n\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut what if i==j? Then we break? Then we don't update? That's okay.\n\nBut note: what if we move the pointers and then i==j? Then we break? Then we don't update the sums? Then we are done.\n\nBut what if we move the pointers and then i<j? Then we update the sums? Then we continue.\n\nBut note: we are updating the sums for the new positions? Yes.\n\nHowever, there is a problem: when we update the sums, we are adding the candy at the new i and the new j? But we have already moved the pointers? So the new i is the next candy on the left, and the new j is the next candy on the right? Yes.\n\nBut what if we have an array of size 2: [1,1]. \n  Initially: i=0, j=1 -> lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 0+1 + 2-1 = 1+1=2.\n  Then we update: i=1, j=0 -> then i>j -> break. So we output 2.\n\nBut what if we have [1,1,1]? \n  i=0, j=2: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best = 1 (left) + 1 (right) = 2.\n  Then update: i=1, j=1 -> break. Then we output 2.\n\nBut the answer for [1,1,1] should be 2? Because we can have Alice take the first two? Then Bob takes the last one? But then the weights: Alice: 1+1=2, Bob:1 -> not equal. Or Alice takes the first one and Bob takes the last two? Then Alice:1, Bob:1+1=2 -> not equal. Or Alice takes the first one and Bob takes the last one? Then 1==1 -> total 2. So 2 is correct.\n\nBut note: we can also have Alice take the first one and Bob take the last two? That would be 1 and 2? Not equal. So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nBut note: we must initialize best to 0? Because if there is no equal sum, then we output 0? For example, [1,2,3,4]? Then we might not get an equal sum? Then we output 0.\n\nBut the problem says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" and we are to output the maximum total candies. If they cannot, then 0.\n\nSo the code for the else branch is:\n\n    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: what if we have an equal sum and then we update the pointers and then we break? Then we don't update the sums? That's okay.\n\nBut what if we have an equal sum and then we update the pointers and then we are still in the loop? Then we update the sums? Then we continue.\n\nBut note: we might get an equal sum again? Then we update best again? And that candidate might be larger? For example, [1,2,3,3,2,1]: \n  Step1: i=0, j=5: lsum=1, rsum=1 -> equal -> best=1+1=2 -> then update: i=1, j=4 -> then update lsum=1+2=3, rsum=1+2=3 -> then we get equal again -> best = max(2, 2+ (6-4)) = max(2, 2+2)=4? Actually, 2 from the left (indices0,1) and 2 from the right (indices5,4) -> total 4. Then update: i=2, j=3 -> then update lsum=3+3=6, rsum=3+3=6 -> then we get equal again -> best = max(4, 3+ (6-3)) = max(4, 3+3)=6. Then update: i=3, j=2 -> break. So we get 6.\n\nBut the array is symmetric? So they can eat all? But note: the entire array? Then Alice eats [1,2,3] and Bob eats [3,2,1]? Then both have 6? And total candies 6. So 6 is correct.\n\nSo the code for the else branch is as above.\n\nBut note: what if we have an equal sum and then we update the pointers and then we get an equal sum again? Then we update best again? That's correct.\n\nBut what if we have an equal sum and then we update the pointers and then we get lsum < rsum? Then we move the left pointer? Then we continue.\n\nSo we complete the TODO in program1.py as:\n\n    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n    i += 1\n    j -= 1\n    if i < j:\n        lsum += arr[i]\n        rsum += arr[j]\n\nBut note: we must be cautious: the array indexing. We are using i and j as the current pointers. When we update, we do i+=1 and j-=1, then we check if i<j, then we add arr[i] and arr[j]. But note: the new i is the next index to the right, and the new j is the next index to the left.\n\nBut what if we have an array of size 1? Then the while loop condition i<j fails? So we don't enter? Then best remains 0? That's correct: because we cannot have both Alice and Bob eat the same total weight? Because if Alice eats the only candy, then Bob has nothing? And vice versa? So they cannot both have the same positive weight? So 0.\n\nBut the problem says: they eat in a row from the left and right. They can choose to eat zero? But the problem says: Alice can eat any number from the left (including zero? but note: the problem says \"any number\", but then they must be fair: same total weight. If both eat zero, then they eat zero candies. But the problem asks for the maximum total candies? So if they eat zero, that's 0 candies. But we are looking for the maximum. So 0 is acceptable if no positive solution.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\". So if they can eat zero, that's always possible? But we are looking for the maximum. So if we can get a positive number, we take that. Otherwise 0.\n\nBut the problem does not require both to eat at least one? Actually, the problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" (including zero) and similarly Bob. But if both eat zero, then they eat zero candies. But the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" and they are. But we are to maximize the total candies. So if we can get 2, that's better than 0.\n\nSo the code for program1.py:\n\nWe add the above block in the else branch.\n\nBut note: we must initialize best to 0. The provided code does that.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are given multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given an integer n. We form a string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times. We want to perform the minimum number of swaps (each swap swaps two characters) so that the string does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\nWe are to output the minimum number of operations m, and then m lines of two indices (1-indexed) for the swaps.\n\nThe provided code for n==1: \n    print(1)\n    print(1, 2)\n\nFor n>=2: \n    print(n//2 + n%2)   # which is the ceiling of n/2? For n=2: 2//2+0=1, but ceiling of 2/2 is 1. For n=3: 3//2+1=1+1=2.\n\nThen it initializes: b = list('ban'*n)   # note: the problem uses \"BAN\", but the code uses lowercase? But the problem says: the string is \"BAN\" repeated. So we should use uppercase? But the example: for n=1: \"BAN\", then swapping indices 1 and 2 (which are the 'B' and 'A') to get \"ABN\". But the code uses 'ban'? That would be lowercase? Then the problem says: we are swapping indices? The problem uses 1-indexed.\n\nBut the problem says: the string is \"BAN\", so we should use uppercase. The example in the problem: s(1)=\"BAN\", s(3)=\"BANBANBAN\". So we should use uppercase.\n\nBut the code uses: b = list('ban'*n) -> that would be ['b','a','n','b','a','n',...]. We need to use uppercase? Actually, the problem does not care about the case? But the problem says: the string is \"BAN\". So we should use uppercase.\n\nBut the example output: for n=1: we output (1,2). If we have the list as ['B','A','N'], then swapping index0 and index1 (0-indexed) would be swapping the first and second characters. Then we get \"ABN\". But the problem expects 1-indexed indices. So we output 1 and 2.\n\nSo we should use: b = list('BAN'*n)\n\nBut the provided code uses 'ban'? That might be a typo? But the problem says the string is \"BAN\". So we change to 'BAN'? Actually, the problem does not require the output to be in any particular case? But the swapping indices are independent of the case. However, the subsequence \"BAN\" must not appear. If we have \"ban\", then the subsequence \"BAN\" (with uppercase) is not present? But the problem says: the string is \"BAN\", so we are to use uppercase. And the subsequence is \"BAN\" (uppercase). So we must use uppercase.\n\nSo we change: b = list('BAN'*n)\n\nNow, the TODO: for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):   # which is the number of operations (ceiling of n/2)\n    for i2 in range(n*3):   # this inner loop is inefficient? Because n<=100, so 3n=300, and the outer loop is at most 50, so total 50*300=15000, which is acceptable? But we are going to break after we find one? Actually, the inner loop is searching for an 'a'? But we are going to do something? The comment says: if b[i2]=='a': then we do something.\n\nWhat is the intended solution?\n\nThe problem says: we want to remove all occurrences of \"BAN\" as a subsequence. How can we do that?\n\nNote: the string is \"BAN\" repeated n times. The subsequence \"BAN\" can be formed by taking the first 'B', then an 'A' that comes after the 'B', and then an 'N' that comes after the 'A'. \n\nOne idea: break the pattern by swapping the 'A's with the 'N's at the end? \n\nThe example: n=2: \"BANBAN\". The solution: swap the second character (which is the first 'A') with the last character (which is the last 'N')? Then we get \"BNNBAA\". \n\nHow to generalize?\n\nWe note that we can break each \"BAN\" by swapping the 'A' in the i-th \"BAN\" with the 'N' in the (n-i+1)-th \"BAN\"? \n\nSpecifically, for the first block, we swap the 'A' (which is at position 1 in 0-indexed: index1) with the last 'N' (which is at position 3n-1). Then for the second block, we swap the next 'A' (which is at position 4) with the next to last 'N' (which is at position 3n-4)? \n\nBut note: the structure of the string: \n  Block0: indices [0,1,2]: 'B','A','N'\n  Block1: indices [3,4,5]: 'B','A','N'\n  ...\n  Block i: indices [3*i, 3*i+1, 3*i+2]\n\nWe want to break the subsequence that uses the 'B' in block i and the 'A' in block i and the 'N' in block j? But if we break the connection between the 'A' and the 'N'? Specifically, if we move the 'A' to a position after the 'N'? Then we break the subsequence for that block? But note: we might form a new subsequence? \n\nAlternatively, we can swap the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block? Then the 'A' moves to the end and the 'N' moves to the middle? Then the 'B' in the i-th block might form a subsequence with an 'A' in a later block? \n\nBut note: the problem only requires that \"BAN\" is not a subsequence. \n\nThe known solution: \n  We can do ceil(n/2) swaps.\n  For i from 0 to ceil(n/2)-1:\n      swap the 'A' in the i-th block (which is at index 3*i+1) with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block (which is at index 3*(n-1-i)+2).\n\nExample: n=1: \n   i=0: swap the 'A' at index 1 (0-indexed) with the 'N' at index 3*(1-1-0)+2 = 3*0+2 = 2? So swap index1 and index2? Then we get \"BNA\"? But the problem example swapped index1 and index2? Actually, the problem example swapped index1 and index2 (1-indexed) which are the same as 0-indexed indices0 and1? Wait, no: 1-indexed index1 is the first character? Actually, the problem says: swap indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed) for n=1. That would be the second character (index1) and the third character (index2) in 0-indexed? But wait: the string \"BAN\" has:\n   index0: 'B'\n   index1: 'A'\n   index2: 'N'\n  So swapping index1 and index2 (1-indexed) is swapping the second and third? Then we get \"BNA\". But the problem example says: \"ABN\" -> that would be swapping the first and second? \n\nBut the problem example: \n  \"In the first testcase, s(1) = \"BAN\", we can swap s(1)_1 and s(1)_2, converting s(1) to \"ABN\"\"\n\nSo they swapped the first and second characters (1-indexed indices 1 and 2). \n\nSo for n=1, we swap the first character (index0) and the second character (index1). \n\nBut the known solution I described above for n=1 would swap the 'A' (at index1) and the 'N' (at index2). That gives \"BNA\", which also does not contain \"BAN\" as a subsequence? But the problem example did a different swap. \n\nSo there are multiple solutions.\n\nBut the problem says: output any.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  For i in range(ceil(n/2)):\n      swap the 'A' in the i-th block (which is at 3*i+1) with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block (which is at 3*(n-1-i)+2).\n\nBut for n=1: \n   i=0: swap index1 (0-indexed) and index 3*(1-1-0)+2 = 3*0+2 = 2 -> swap index1 and index2 -> then we get \"BNA\". \n   Then we output: \n        m = ceil(1/2)=1\n        then the swap: indices 1+1 and 2+1? (because the problem expects 1-indexed) -> 2 and 3.\n\nBut the problem example did 1 and 2. \n\nBut the problem says: if there are multiple, output any. So we can output 2 and 3.\n\nBut the problem example for n=2: \n   They swapped the second character (which is the first 'A') with the last character (which is the last 'N')? \n   In our method: \n        i=0: swap the 'A' in block0 (index1) with the 'N' in block1 (which is the last block: n-1-0=1 -> index = 3*1+2 = 5) -> so swap index1 and index5 -> then the string becomes:\n            Original: ['B','A','N','B','A','N']\n            After swap: \n                index1: originally 'A' becomes 'N'\n                index5: originally 'N' becomes 'A'\n            So we get: \"B\" then at index1: 'N', then at index2: 'N'? Wait, no: \n                index0: 'B'\n                index1: now the character that was at index5: 'N'\n                index2: 'N' (unchanged) -> but wait, we swapped index1 and index5: \n                    So index1 becomes 'N' (from the last block) and index5 becomes 'A' (from the first block).\n                Then the string: \n                    index0: 'B'\n                    index1: 'N'\n                    index2: 'N'   -> so the first block becomes \"BNN\"\n                    index3: 'B'\n                    index4: 'A'\n                    index5: 'A'   -> the second block becomes \"BAA\"\n            So the string is \"BNNBAA\". \n\n   The problem example says: \"BNNBAA\", which is the same.\n\n   Then we output: \n        m = ceil(2/2)=1\n        then the swap: indices 1+1=2 and 5+1=6? But the problem expects 1-indexed: so we output 2 and 6? \n\n   But the problem example output: \"2 6\" (for the swap)? \n\n   Actually, the problem example says: \"swap s(2)_2 and s(2)_6\", so 2 and 6.\n\n   So we output: for the first operation: 2 and 6.\n\n   For n=3: \n        m = ceil(3/2)=2\n        Operation1: i=0: swap the 'A' in block0 (index1) with the 'N' in block2 (index = 3*2+2 = 8) -> swap index1 and index8.\n        Operation2: i=1: swap the 'A' in block1 (index = 3*1+1 = 4) with the 'N' in block1? because n-1-1 = 3-1-1=1 -> so the block1's 'N' is at index 3*1+2=5? -> swap index4 and index5.\n\n        Then we output:\n            Operation1: 2 and 9 (because 1-indexed: 1+1=2, 8+1=9)\n            Operation2: 5 and 6 (because 4+1=5, 5+1=6)\n\n        Then the string becomes:\n            Initially: \"BANBANBAN\"\n            After op1: swap index1 and index8:\n                index1: originally 'A' becomes the character at index8: which is the last 'N'? \n                index8: originally the last 'N' becomes 'A'\n                So: \n                    block0: index0='B', index1='N' (from the last block), index2='N' -> but wait, we swapped index1 and index8, so:\n                    index0: 'B'\n                    index1: 'N' (from the last block: which was the last character)\n                    index2: 'N' (unchanged) -> but that's the first block: \"BNN\"\n                    block1: index3='B', index4='A', index5='N' -> unchanged? \n                    block2: index6='B', index7='A', index8='A' (because we put the 'A' from the first block at the end) -> so \"BAA\"\n                So the string: \"BNN\" + \"BAN\" + \"BAA\" -> \"BNNBANBAA\"\n\n            Then op2: swap index4 and index5 (0-indexed) in the current string? \n                The current string: \n                    index0: 'B'\n                    index1: 'N'\n                    index2: 'N'\n                    index3: 'B'\n                    index4: 'A' -> becomes the character at index5: which is 'N'\n                    index5: 'N' -> becomes 'A'\n                    index6: 'B'\n                    index7: 'A'\n                    index8: 'A'\n                So after swap: \n                    index4: 'N'\n                    index5: 'A'\n                Then the string: \"BNN\" + \"BNA\" + \"BAA\" -> \"BNNBNABAA\"\n\n        Now, check if \"BAN\" is a subsequence? \n          We can try to pick:\n            'B': we can take index0 -> then we need an 'A' after index0: we have index5 (which is 'A')? Then we need an 'N' after index5: we have index8? but that's 'A'. There is no 'N' after index5? The only 'N's are at index1,2,4? and index4 is at position4 which is before index5? So we cannot form \"BAN\" starting with index0? \n          What about the next 'B'? index3: then we need an 'A' after index3: we have index5 (which is 'A')? Then we need an 'N' after index5: none? \n          Then the next 'B'? index6: then we need an 'A' after index6: we have index7? then we need an 'N' after index7: none? \n          So no \"BAN\".\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, the plan: \n          For each test case:\n            n = given\n            m = (n+1)//2   # which is the same as n//2 + n%2\n            Then for i in range(m):\n                index1 = 3*i + 1   # 0-indexed index of the 'A' in the i-th block\n                index2 = 3*(n-1-i) + 2   # 0-indexed index of the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block\n                Then output the swap: (index1+1, index2+1)   # converting to 1-indexed\n\n        But note: for n=1: \n            i=0: \n                index1 = 3*0+1 = 1\n                index2 = 3*(1-1-0)+2 = 3*0+2 = 2\n                then output (2,3) -> which is 1-indexed indices 2 and 3? But the problem example did 1 and 2? \n\n        However, the problem says: if there are multiple, output any. So we can output (2,3) for n=1.\n\n        But the problem example for n=1: \n            Input: 1 -> output: 1, then 1 2.\n\n        Why the difference? Because the problem example swapped the first and second? \n\n        We can also do: \n            For n=1, we can swap the first and second? \n\n        How to generalize? \n\n        Actually, we can swap the 'B' with the 'A' in the same block? Then we break the first block? \n\n        But note: if we swap the 'B' and the 'A' in the first block: \n            Original: \"BAN\" -> swap index0 and index1: \"ABN\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n            How? \n                We have \"ABN\": \n                    We cannot form \"BAN\": because we would need a 'B' that comes before an 'A'? But the first character is 'A', then the second is 'B'. So we can take the 'B' at index1 and then the 'N' at index2? Then we have \"BN\", but we don't have an 'A' between the 'B' and the 'N'? So we cannot form \"BAN\".\n\n        So we can also swap the 'B' and the 'A' in the i-th block? \n\n        But then we break the i-th block? \n\n        However, the problem asks for the minimum number of operations. The minimum is ceil(n/2). \n\n        We can do: \n            For i in range(0, ceil(n/2)):\n                swap the 'B' in the i-th block (at 3*i) with the 'A' in the (n-1-i)-th block? \n\n        But that might not break the entire pattern? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            For i in range(0, ceil(n/2)):\n                swap the 'A' in the i-th block (at 3*i+1) with the 'B' in the (n-1-i)-th block? \n\n        But the problem example for n=1: \n            swap the 'A' in block0 (index1) with the 'B' in block0? but wait, for n=1, the (n-1-i) block is block0? so swap index1 and index0? -> then we get \"ABN\", which matches the example.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            For i in range(0, m):\n                index1 = 3*i+1   # the 'A' in the i-th block\n                index2 = 3*(n-1-i)   # the 'B' in the (n-1-i)-th block? \n                Then output (index1+1, index2+1)\n\n        For n=1: \n            i=0: index1=1, index2=3*(0)=0 -> swap index1 and index0 -> then we output (1+1, 0+1) = (2,1) -> but the problem expects 1 and 2? which is the same.\n\n        For n=2: \n            m=1\n            i=0: \n                index1 = 3*0+1 = 1\n                index2 = 3*(2-1-0) = 3*1 = 3\n            swap index1 and index3 -> then the string:\n                Original: \"BANBAN\"\n                Swap index1 and index3: \n                    index1: originally 'A' becomes the 'B' from the second block? \n                    index3: originally 'B' becomes 'A'\n                Then we get: \n                    index0: 'B'\n                    index1: 'B' (from the second block)\n                    index2: 'N'\n                    index3: 'A'\n                    index4: 'A'\n                    index5: 'N'\n                So \"B B N A A N\" -> \"BBN AAN\"\n\n                Now, check for \"BAN\": \n                    We can take the first 'B' (index0), then the first 'A' after that? which is at index3? then the first 'N' after that? index5? -> \"BAN\". So we failed.\n\n        So that doesn't work.\n\n        Alternatively, swap the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block? We did that above and it worked for n=2.\n\n        For n=1: we swapped the 'A' and the 'N'? Then we got \"BNA\", which is acceptable.\n\n        So we stick to swapping the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the TODO:\n\n            We are in the loop for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                We are iterating for i2 in range(n*3): \n                    if b[i2]=='a':   # but note: we changed to 'BAN', so we should check for 'A'? \n                Actually, the code uses: if b[i2]=='a': but we changed the string to 'BAN'*n -> so we have uppercase? Then we should check for 'A'? \n\n            But the code uses: if b[i2]=='a' -> that will never be true? Because we have uppercase.\n\n            So we change: if b[i2]=='A':\n\n            Then what? We are going to do the swap? But we are in an inner loop that runs for each character? We only want to do one swap per outer loop iteration? \n\n            Actually, the inner loop is unnecessary? Because we know exactly which indices to swap: for the current i3 (which is the operation index, from 0 to m-1), we want to swap the 'A' in the i3-th block and the 'N' in the (n-1-i3)-th block.\n\n            So we can break out of the inner loop after we do the swap? But the inner loop is over the entire string? We don't need to search? We can compute the indices.\n\n            So we can remove the inner loop? \n\n            Instead, we do:\n\n                i = i3   # the current operation index\n                index1 = 3*i + 1   # the 'A' in the i-th block (0-indexed)\n                index2 = 3*(n-1-i) + 2   # the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block (0-indexed)\n\n                Then we output: (index1+1, index2+1)   # 1-indexed\n\n                And if we are actually swapping in the list? The problem does not require us to simulate? It only requires the list of swaps? \n\n            But the problem says: \"output m lines. The k-th of these lines should contain two integers i_k, j_k\"\n\n            So we don't need to simulate the swaps? We only output the indices.\n\n            Therefore, we can remove the inner loop and the condition? \n\n            So we change the code:\n\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    # We know the indices to swap: \n                    idx1 = 3*i3 + 1\n                    idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                    print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            But note: the problem says: the string is 1-indexed.\n\n            Example: n=1: \n                i3=0: \n                    idx1 = 3*0+1 = 1\n                    idx2 = 3*(1-1-0)+2 = 3*0+2 = 2\n                    then output: 2 and 3.\n\n            Example: n=2: \n                i3=0:\n                    idx1 = 3*0+1 = 1\n                    idx2 = 3*(2-1-0)+2 = 3*1+2 = 5\n                    then output: 2 and 6.\n\n            Example: n=3: \n                i3=0: \n                    idx1 = 1\n                    idx2 = 3*(3-1-0)+2 = 3*2+2 = 8 -> output 2 and 9\n                i3=1:\n                    idx1 = 3*1+1 = 4\n                    idx2 = 3*(3-1-1)+2 = 3*1+2 = 5 -> output 5 and 6\n\n            This matches.\n\n            But note: the problem says: the total operations must be at most 10^5? And n<=100, and we do at most 50 operations per test case? So it's acceptable.\n\n            However, the provided code has an inner loop. We are going to remove it? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Complete the code\". We can change the code? \n\n            The provided code:\n\n                else:\n                    print(n//2+n%2)\n                    for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                        for i2 in range(n*3):\n                            if b[i2]=='a':   # we change to 'A'\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We can change the inner part? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                else:\n                    print(n//2+n%2)\n                    for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                        idx1 = 3*i3 + 1\n                        idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                        print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            But note: the variable i3 is the same as the outer loop variable? But the outer loop is for i in range(t): and then we have for i3 in ...? That's okay.\n\n            However, the problem says: the total operations must be at most 10^5? And we are doing only ceil(n/2) per test case, and the total t<=100, and n<=100, so the total operations is at most 100 * 50 = 5000, which is <=100000.\n\n            So we do that.\n\n            But note: the code for n==1 is already handled? The provided code has:\n\n                if n==1:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(1,2)\n\n            But our method for n=1 outputs 2 and 3? \n\n            We can change the n==1 case to use the same method? \n\n            Actually, we can remove the if n==1 and use the same method for all n? \n\n            For n=1: \n                m = (1+1)//2 = 1\n                then we output: \n                    idx1 = 3*0+1 = 1 -> 1-indexed: 2\n                    idx2 = 3*(1-1-0)+2 = 2 -> 1-indexed: 3\n                so we output 2 and 3.\n\n            But the problem example for n=1 outputs 1 and 2? \n\n            However, the problem says: if there are multiple, output any. So we can output 2 and 3.\n\n            But the problem example in the note: \"In the first testcase, ... we can swap s(1)_1 and s(1)_2\" -> that's 1 and 2. \n\n            The problem does not require the minimal operations to be unique? So we can output any.\n\n            However, the problem example for n=1 in the provided code outputs 1 and 2? \n\n            We can change the n==1 case to use the same method? Or we can leave it? \n\n            But note: the problem says: \"It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most 10^5 operations under the constraints of the problem.\" and we are doing the minimal number of operations (ceil(n/2))? \n\n            For n=1: ceil(1/2)=1, so we output one operation. \n\n            We can do:\n\n                if n==1:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(1, 2)   # as in the example\n\n            But then for n>=2, we do the other method? \n\n            But we can do the same method for n=1? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                We don't need the if n==1? We can use the same formula for n=1? \n\n            However, the problem example expects 1 and 2 for n=1? \n\n            But the problem says: output any. So we can output 1 and 2? \n\n            How? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                For the swap, we can swap the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'B' in the same block? \n\n            But we already tried that for n=2 and it didn't work? \n\n            Actually, for n=1: \n                We can swap the 'B' and the 'A'? \n                Then we use: \n                    idx1 = 3*i+1   # the 'A' -> index1\n                    idx2 = 3*i      # the 'B' in the same block? \n\n            Then for n=1: \n                i3=0: \n                    idx1 = 1\n                    idx2 = 0\n                then output 1 and 2? \n\n            How to generalize? \n\n            We want to break each block? But then for n=2: \n                Operation1: swap the 'A' in block0 with the 'B' in block0: \n                    \"BANBAN\" -> swap index0 and index1: \"ABNBAN\"\n                Then we still have \"BAN\" in the second block? \n                Then we need to break the second block? \n                Operation2: swap the 'A' in block1 with the 'B' in block1: \n                    swap index3 and index4: \"ABN\" (first block) and then \"ABN\" becomes \"BAN\" -> wait, swapping the 'B' and 'A' in the second block: \n                        originally \"BAN\" at the second block: swap index3 and index4: \n                            index3: 'B' becomes 'A'\n                            index4: 'A' becomes 'B'\n                        so we get \"ABN\" -> \"ABN\" becomes \"ABN\" (because the second block becomes \"ABN\" -> wait: \n                            originally: index3='B', index4='A', index5='N'\n                            after swap: index3='A', index4='B', index5='N' -> \"ABN\" becomes \"ABN\" -> but that's not \"BAN\"?\n                        Actually, the second block becomes \"ABN\", which is \"A\", \"B\", \"N\" -> so we cannot form \"BAN\" from the second block? \n                Then the entire string: \"ABN\" + \"ABN\" = \"ABNABN\". \n                Now, can we form \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n                    We can take: \n                        the first 'B': at index1? \n                        then an 'A' after that: at index3? \n                        then an 'N' after that: at index5? \n                    So we have \"BAN\": the 'B' at index1, the 'A' at index3, the 'N' at index5? \n\n                So we failed.\n\n            Therefore, we stick to swapping the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block.\n\n            And for n=1, we output 2 and 3? \n\n            But the problem example for n=1 in the note did 1 and 2? \n\n            The problem says: output any. \n\n            However, the problem example output for n=1 is 1 and 2? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                For the swap, we can swap the 'B' in the i-th block with the 'A' in the same block? That breaks the block? \n\n                Then for n=1: \n                    swap index0 and index1: then we get \"ABN\", which is acceptable.\n\n                For n=2: \n                    Operation1: swap the 'B' and 'A' in block0: \n                        \"BANBAN\" -> \"ABNBAN\"\n                    Operation2: swap the 'B' and 'A' in block1: \n                        \"ABN\" (first block) and then swap the second block: \"BAN\" becomes \"ABN\" -> so \"ABNABN\"\n                    Then we can form \"BAN\": \n                        Take the 'B' at index1 (in the first block: originally the 'A' at index0 becomes 'A', the 'B' at index1 becomes the first character? Actually, after the first swap: \n                            index0: originally 'B' becomes 'A'\n                            index1: originally 'A' becomes 'B'\n                            then the rest: \"NBAN\"\n                        So the string: \"ABNBAN\" -> \n                            We can take: \n                                the 'B' at index1, \n                                then the 'A' at index3 (in the second block: the first character of the second block was originally 'B', now we haven't swapped the second block yet? \n                        Actually, we haven't done the second swap? \n                    After the second swap: \n                        The second block: \n                            index3: originally 'B' becomes 'A'\n                            index4: originally 'A' becomes 'B'\n                        So the string: \"ABN\" (first block) and \"ABN\" (second block) -> \"ABNABN\"\n                    Then we can form \"BAN\": \n                        Take the 'B' at index1, then the 'A' at index3, then the 'N' at index5? -> \"BAN\"\n\n                So that doesn't work.\n\n            Therefore, we stick to the first method: swapping the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block.\n\n            And we change the n==1 case to use the same method? \n\n            We can remove the if n==1 and use the same for all? \n\n            So:\n\n                if n==1:\n                    # We change: do the same as for others?\n                    print(1)\n                    # Instead of printing 1,2, we do:\n                    idx1 = 3*0+1\n                    idx2 = 3*(1-1-0)+2\n                    print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            But that outputs 2 and 3.\n\n            Or we can do:\n\n                We remove the if n==1 and do the same for all n? \n\n            The provided code has:\n\n                if n==1:\n                    print(1)\n                    print(1,2)\n                else:\n                    print(n//2+n%2)\n                    for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                        for i2 in range(n*3):\n                            if b[i2]=='a':\n                                # TODO\n\n            We change the else part to:\n\n                else:\n                    m = n//2 + n%2\n                    print(m)\n                    for i in range(m):\n                        idx1 = 3*i + 1\n                        idx2 = 3*(n-1-i) + 2\n                        print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            And we remove the inner loop? \n\n            But note: the variable i3 is the same as i? \n\n            And we remove the condition on 'a'? \n\n            So the code becomes:\n\n                from sys import stdin\n                t = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                for i in range(t):\n                    n = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                    # We don't need to form the list?

For n=1, ceil(1/2)=1. So we output one operation: \"1 2\".\n\n            This matches the example.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do without the condition in the loop? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                for i3 in range(m):\n                    if n==1:\n                        # then we are forced to output 1 and 2? \n                        print(\"1 2\")\n                    else:\n                        # compute as above\n\n            But note: for n=1, the computation would give 2 and 3? But we want 1 and 2? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                for i3 in range(m):\n                    if n==1:\n                        print(\"1 2\")\n                    else:\n                        idx1 = 3*i3 + 1\n                        idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                        print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            But then for n=1, we output \"1 2\", and for n>=2, we output the computed indices.\n\n            This is acceptable.\n\n            But note: the problem says: the total operations must be at most 10^5? And we are doing one operation for n=1? \n\n            So we complete program2.py as:\n\n                from sys import stdin\n                t = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                for i in range(t):\n                    n = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                    m = (n+1)//2   # ceil(n/2)\n                    print(m)\n                    for i3 in range(m):\n                        if n == 1:\n                            print(\"1 2\")\n                        else:\n                            idx1 = 3*i3 + 1\n                            idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                            print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            But note: the problem says: the string is 1-indexed. For n=1, we output 1 and 2: which are the first and second characters.\n\n            For n>=2, we output the computed indices.\n\n            However, we can also do a unified method: \n\n                We can swap the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'B' in the i-th block for the first ceil(n/2) blocks? \n\n                But we saw that for n=2 it didn't work? \n\n            Alternatively, we can swap the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block for all n? But for n=1, that gives 2 and 3? \n\n            But the problem accepts any. \n\n            Since the problem example for n=1 in the note did 1 and 2, and the provided code for n=1 did 1 and 2, we do the condition for n=1.\n\n            So we output the above.\n\n            But note: the problem says: the total number of test cases t<=100, and n<=100, so we can do the condition.\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program1.py and program2.py:\n\n            For program1.py: \n                We add in the else branch:\n\n                    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n                    i += 1\n                    j -= 1\n                    if i < j:\n                        lsum += arr[i]\n                        rsum += arr[j]\n\n            For program2.py: \n                We change the else branch to:\n\n                    else:\n                        m = (n+1)//2\n                        print(m)\n                        for i3 in range(m):\n                            if n == 1:\n                                print(\"1 2\")\n                            else:\n                                idx1 = 3*i3 + 1\n                                idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                                print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            But note: the program2.py code we are to complete is only the TODO part? \n\n            The TODO part is inside:\n\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    for i2 in range(n*3):\n                        if b[i2]=='a':   # we change to 'A'? \n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We are to complete the TODO? \n\n            But we are changing the entire structure? \n\n            The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\", and we are allowed to change the code? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n            How to output only the missing code? \n\n            We are to output a JSON: \n                {\"program1\": \"completion\", \"program2\": \"completion\"}\n\n            For program1.py, the missing code is the block for the else branch? \n\n            For program2.py, the missing code is the block for the TODO? \n\n            But in program2.py, we are going to replace the inner loop and the condition? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                For program2.py, we replace the TODO part with:\n\n                    break   # to break the inner loop? But we don't need the inner loop.\n\n                But that won't work.\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                We remove the inner loop and do the computation? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning we are to output the code that goes in the TODO? \n\n            The TODO is inside the inner loop? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                if b[i2]=='A':   # we change to uppercase\n                    # Then we know that this is the i3-th 'A'? \n                    # But how do we know which block? \n                    # Actually, the first 'A' is at index1, the next at index4, then index7, etc.\n\n                    # We can compute the block index: i2 // 3? \n                    block_index = i2 // 3\n                    # But we are iterating i3 from 0 to m-1, and we want to swap the i3-th block's 'A'? \n                    # But the inner loop is iterating over the entire string? \n\n                    # We want to swap the 'A' at i2 with the 'N' in the (n-1-i3)-th block? \n                    # But note: we are in the outer loop for i3, so we are on the i3-th operation? \n\n                    # Then the index for the 'N' in the (n-1-i3)-th block is: 3*(n-1-i3)+2.\n\n                    idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                    # Then we output the swap: \n                    print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                    # And we break the inner loop? because we only do one swap per operation.\n                    break\n\n            But note: the inner loop starts from 0, so it will find the first 'A'? But the first 'A' is in block0, then the next in block1, etc. \n\n            For the i3-th operation, we want to swap the 'A' in the i3-th block? \n\n            But the inner loop starts at 0, so it will find the first 'A'? That is the block0? Then for i3=0, we swap block0's 'A'? for i3=1, we swap block1's 'A'? \n\n            But what if we have already swapped an 'A'? Then the list b has been modified? \n\n            However, the problem does not require us to simulate the swaps? We only output the swap indices? \n\n            And the problem says: we can output any sequence of swaps that achieves the goal? \n\n            But the provided code does not simulate the swaps? It only outputs the indices? \n\n            So we don't care about the current state of the list? \n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    for i2 in range(n*3):\n                        if b[i2]=='A':   # we change to uppercase\n                            # We want the i3-th 'A'? Actually, the i3-th block's 'A' is at index = 3*i3+1? \n                            # But we are scanning from the beginning? So the first 'A' we find is the first block's 'A'? \n                            # But if we have swapped it, then it might not be 'A' anymore? \n\n            However, we are not simulating the swap, so the list b is unchanged? \n\n            So we can simply compute the index of the 'A' in the i3-th block: it is 3*i3+1? \n\n            But then why scan? \n\n            We can break out of the inner loop immediately by using the known index? \n\n            So we can do:\n\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    # We know the index of the 'A' in the i3-th block: \n                    idx1 = 3*i3+1\n                    # But we are in a loop that scans i2? We can break the inner loop by:\n                    #   i2 = idx1   (but we are iterating, so we can break when we find it? \n                    # But we can break immediately? \n\n                So:\n\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    # We break out of the inner loop immediately by:\n                    idx1 = 3*i3+1\n                    # But we are in the inner loop? We can break the inner loop without iterating? \n\n            Alternatively, we can break after the first 'A'? But that might not be the i3-th block? \n\n            Actually, the first 'A' is in the first block? Then the next 'A' is in the second block? \n\n            But if we swap the first block's 'A' with the last block's 'N', then in the next operation, the first block's 'A' is gone? and the next 'A' is the second block's? \n\n            But we are not simulating, so the list b is unchanged? \n\n            Therefore, we can simply output the swap for the i3-th block's 'A'? \n\n            So we do:\n\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    idx1 = 3*i3+1\n                    idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                    print(f\"{idx1+1} {idx2+1}\")\n\n            And then break out of the inner loop? But we are in the inner loop? \n\n            We can break out of the inner loop immediately? \n\n            But the inner loop is:\n\n                for i2 in range(n*3):\n                    if b[i2]=='A':   # we change to 'A'\n                        # then we do the swap for the known indices? \n                        # but we know the indices: \n                        #   idx1 = 3*i3+1   -> but we are at i2, and we are at the first 'A'? \n                        #   but we want the i3-th block's 'A'? \n\n            How to get the i3-th block's 'A'? \n\n            We can break the inner loop after we output the swap for the i3-th block's 'A'? \n\n            But the inner loop will find the first 'A'? which is the first block's? \n\n            For i3=0, we want the first block's 'A'. \n            For i3=1, we want the second block's 'A'. \n\n            But after the first swap, the first block's 'A' is gone? But we are not simulating, so in the next operation, the inner loop will start from 0 and find the next 'A'? which is the second block's? \n\n            But the second block's 'A' is at index 4? \n\n            However, after the first swap, the first block's 'A' is swapped with the last block's 'N', so the first block's 'A' is now at the last block's 'N' position? and the last block's 'N' is now at the first block's 'A' position? \n\n            Then in the next operation, when we scan from the beginning, we will find at index1: what? It's the 'N' from the last block? so not 'A'. Then we will find the next 'A'? which is at index4? \n\n            So it will work.\n\n            Therefore, we can do:\n\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    found = False\n                    for i2 in range(n*3):\n                        if b[i2]=='A':   # we changed to uppercase\n                            # This is an 'A'. We want to swap it with the 'N' in the (n-1-i3)-th block.\n                            idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                            print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                            # And then we swap in the list b? \n                            # The problem does not require simulation? But the next operation might see the updated list? \n                            # The problem says: we are to output the swaps, and the swaps are applied in order? \n                            # But the problem does not require us to output the final string? \n                            # However, the next operation's inner loop will scan the updated list? \n                            # So we should simulate the swap in the list b? \n                            b[i2], b[idx2] = b[idx2], b[i2]\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                    if not found:\n                        # but there should be one? \n                        pass\n\n            But note: the problem says: the total number of 'A's is n? and we are doing ceil(n/2) swaps? and we are swapping each 'A' we find with a distinct 'N'? \n\n            And the 'N' we are swapping with is in the (n-1-i3)-th block? \n\n            And we are only doing ceil(n/2) swaps? \n\n            So we break after the first 'A' we find? \n\n            But after we swap, that 'A' is moved to the position of the 'N' in the (n-1-i3)-th block, and that 'N' is moved to the current position? \n\n            Then in the next operation, we will find the next 'A'? \n\n            This should work.\n\n            But we must change the list to uppercase? \n\n            The code has: b = list('ban'*n) -> we change to 'BAN'? \n\n            So we do:\n\n                b = list('BAN'*n)\n\n            Then in the TODO:\n\n                if b[i2]=='A':\n                    idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                    print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                    # swap in the list b for the next operation to see the updated string?\n                    b[i2], b[idx2] = b[idx2], b[i2]\n                    break\n\n            And we remove the condition for n==1? \n\n            But for n=1: \n                b = list('BAN')\n                i3=0: \n                    inner loop: i2=0: b[0]=='B' -> skip\n                    i2=1: b[1]=='A' -> then we do:\n                        idx2 = 3*(1-1-0)+2 = 2\n                        print: 2 and 3? \n                    then swap: b[1] and b[2]: \n                        b becomes: ['B', 'N', 'A'] -> \"BNA\"\n                Then we break.\n\n            But the problem example for n=1 did 1 and 2? \n\n            However, the problem accepts any. \n\n            But the problem example in the note did 1 and 2, and the provided code for n=1 did 1 and 2? \n\n            We can force n=1 to do 1 and 2? \n\n            We can do:\n\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    if n==1:\n                        # specifically for n=1, we output 1 and 2\n                        print(\"1 2\")\n                        # and swap in the list?\n                        b[0], b[1] = b[1], b[0]   # swap index0 and index1\n                        # then break the inner loop? \n                        break   # break the inner loop? but we are in the inner loop? \n                        # but we break the inner loop, then we go to the next operation? \n                    else:\n                        for i2 in range(n*3):\n                            if b[i2]=='A':\n                                idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                                print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                                b[i2], b[idx2] = b[idx2], b[i2]\n                                break\n\n            But the break in the if n==1 breaks the inner loop? But we are in the inner loop? \n\n            We are not in the inner loop for the n==1 case? \n\n            The structure:\n\n                for i3 in ...:\n                    if n==1:\n                        print(\"1 2\")\n                        b[0], b[1] = b[1], b[0]\n                        # then we break out of the inner loop? but we haven't entered the inner loop? \n                        # and we want to break out of the inner loop? Actually, we are not in the inner loop? \n                        # then we break out of nothing? \n                    else:\n                        for i2 in ...:   # this is the inner loop\n\n            So for n==1, we do the if branch, and then we break out of the if branch? Then we are done for this operation? \n\n            But then we go to the next operation? There is only one operation.\n\n            So it's okay.\n\n            But note: the list b is updated for n=1? \n\n            This is for the next operation? But there is only one operation.\n\n            So we do:\n\n                from sys import stdin\n                t = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                for i in range(t):\n                    n = int(stdin.readline().strip())\n                    b = list('BAN'*n)   # change to uppercase\n                    if n==1:\n                        print(1)\n                        print(1, 2)\n                    else:\n                        print(n//2+n%2)\n                        for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                            if n == 1:\n                                # This is not needed because we are in the else branch? \n                                # But n is fixed in the test case, so we are in the else branch only for n>=2.\n                                pass\n                            else:\n                                if n == 1: \n                                    # won't happen\n                                    pass\n                                else:\n                                    # In the TODO part: \n                                    #   for i2 in range(n*3):\n                                    #       if b[i2]=='A':\n                                    #           ... break\n                                    # We change the TODO to:\n\n            But the TODO is inside the else branch and inside the for i3 and inside the for i2 and inside the if b[i2]=='a' (which we change to 'A')? \n\n            We are to output only the missing code for the TODO? \n\n            The TODO is: \n\n                if b[i2]=='a':   -> we change to 'A'\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO with:\n\n                if n == 1:\n                    # But we are in the else branch for n>=2, so n!=1 here? \n                    # So we don't need this.\n                    pass\n                else:\n                    idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                    print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                    b[i2], b[idx2] = b[idx2], b[i2]\n                    break\n\n            But wait, for n>=2, we are in the else branch of the test case, and then in the for i3, and then in the for i2, and then in the if b[i2]=='A'. \n\n            And then we do the above.\n\n            But what about n==1? We already handled it in the if n==1 at the top.\n\n            So for the TODO, we can do:\n\n                # We are in the else branch (n>=2) and in the inner loop and we found an 'A'\n                idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3)+2\n                print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                b[i2], b[idx2] = b[idx2], b[i2]\n                break\n\n            And we change the condition to 'A'.\n\n            But note: the list b is defined as 'ban' in lowercase? We changed to 'BAN' (uppercase) at the beginning.\n\n            So the condition: if b[i2]=='A':\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py in the TODO is:\n\n                if b[i2] == 'A':   # note: we changed to uppercase\n                    idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                    print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                    b[i2], b[idx2] = b[idx2], b[i2]\n                    break\n\n            But wait, the code already has the for i2 loop? And we are inside the if b[i2]=='a'? We change that to 'A'? \n\n            The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the code that goes in the TODO? \n\n            And we change the 'a' to 'A'? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program\", so we only output the code for the TODO block.\n\n            However, the condition is part of the provided code? \n\n            We are to complete the TODO, which is inside the if condition? \n\n            So the missing code for program2.py is the block that goes after the if condition? \n\n            Therefore, we output for program2.py:\n\n                idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                b[i2], b[idx2] = b[idx2], b[i2]\n                break\n\n            And we note that we must change the condition from 'a' to 'A'? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we only output the block for the TODO, not the condition.\n\n            However, the condition is already there? \n\n            So we only output the block.\n\n            But the condition is written as: if b[i2]=='a': \n            We must change it to 'A'? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Complete the code\", so we are allowed to change the condition? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we only output the block that is missing.\n\n            We'll assume that the condition is changed to 'A' by the user? \n\n            Or we output the condition as part of the completion? \n\n            The problem says: the TODO is at the line with the comment. \n\n            We output only the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n            So for program2.py, the missing code is the block that does the swap and break.\n\n            Therefore, we output:\n\n                for program1.py: \n                    best = max(best, i+1 + n - j)\n                    i += 1\n                    j -= 1\n                    if i < j:\n                        lsum += arr[i]\n                        rsum += arr[j]\n\n                for program2.py:\n                    idx2 = 3*(n-1-i3) + 2\n                    print(f\"{i2+1} {idx2+1}\")\n                    b[i2], b[idx2] = b[idx2], b[i2]\n                    break\n\n            But note: in program2.py, the TODO is inside the if condition, so we only need to output the block.\n\n            However, the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", so we output the block.\n\n            But the block for program2.py has three lines.\n\n            We output them as a string? \n\n            We format it as a string that can be placed in the TODO.\n\n            But the problem says: output in JSON.\n\n"
