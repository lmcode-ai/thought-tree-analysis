But note: the while loop condition is \"while pos <= len_input - 1\", and after reading n test cases, if there is extra data, we break anyway? But the problem says the input is exactly the test cases. So we don't expect extra data. But to be safe, we break after reading the test cases. Therefore, the code for program2.py TODO is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr) break But what if n is 0? Then the for loop runs 0 times and then we break. That is acceptable. However, the problem says t>=1, so n>=1. But to be generic, we break after the for loop. Therefore, the final answer. Let's write the JSON. For program1.py: the missing line is \"        ans += i*(n-i)\" (with 8 spaces of indentation). For program2.py: the missing block is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)",

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to address two separate programming challenges. The first involves efficiently calculating the sum of awesomeness values for all subsegments of an array after each update query. The second involves determining if we can transform an array such that all elements except the first are zero using specific operations.\n\n### Approach for Program1\n1. **Initial Setup**: The initial sum of awesomeness values is computed as the total number of subarrays (since each subarray of length 1 has an awesomeness of 1). This is given by \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n2. **Adjacent Pairs Contribution**: For each adjacent pair in the array, if the elements are different, they contribute an additional \\( i \\times (n - i) \\) to the total sum, where \\( i \\) is the starting index of the pair. This accounts for all subarrays that include this pair.\n3. **Handling Queries**: For each query that updates an element at index \\( i \\):\n   - **Left Adjacent Pair (if \\( i > 0 \\))**: Adjust the total sum by removing the old contribution (if the old value was different from the left neighbor) and adding the new contribution (if the new value is different from the left neighbor).\n   - **Right Adjacent Pair (if \\( i < n-1 \\))**: Similarly, adjust the total sum by removing the old contribution (if the old value was different from the right neighbor) and adding the new contribution (if the new value is different from the right neighbor).\n4. **Output**: After processing each query, the updated total sum is stored and printed.\n\n### Approach for Program2\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first integer is the number of test cases \\( t \\). Each test case starts with an integer \\( n \\) (the array length), followed by \\( n \\) integers.\n2. **Checking Feasibility**: For each test case, check if all elements in the array (from the second element onwards) are divisible by the first element. If they are, it is possible to perform operations to reduce all subsequent elements to zero; otherwise, it is not.\n3. **Output Result**: For each test case, output \"YES\" if all elements (from the second onwards) are divisible by the first element, otherwise output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code for Program1\nThe missing line in `program1.py` is:\n```python\n        ans += i*(n-i)\n```\n\n### Solution Code for Program2\nThe missing block in `program2.py` is:\n```python\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n        break\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program1**: The solution efficiently maintains the total awesomeness sum by dynamically adjusting contributions from adjacent pairs during each update. The key insight is that each adjacent pair's contribution depends on whether the elements differ and their positions.\n- **Program2**: The solution checks divisibility of all array elements by the first element. If divisible, operations can reduce subsequent elements to zero by repeatedly subtracting the first element (or multiples thereof). The loop processes each test case by reading the array and checking the divisibility condition.\n\nThese approaches ensure optimal performance and correctness for the given problem constraints.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given an initial array and then m queries. After each query (which updates an element), we must output the total sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subarrays.\n\nThe awesomeness of a contiguous subarray is the number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers. For example, [1,2,2] has awesomeness 2.\n\nThe initial code already sets up:\n  n, m = ... and the array li.\n  It initializes `ans` to n*(n+1)//2. This is the total number of contiguous subarrays? But note: the awesomeness of a subarray of length 1 is always 1, so if we had no adjacent changes, the total awesomeness would be the number of subarrays? Actually, no: the awesomeness of a subarray [l, r] is 1 plus the number of indices i (from l to r-1) such that a[i] != a[i+1]. \n\nBut note: the problem states that the total answer is the sum of g(l, r) for all 1<=l<=r<=n.\n\nWe can think: \n  The base value is that every subarray has at least 1 block. So we start with T = (n*(n+1))//2.\n\nThen, for each adjacent pair (i, i+1) (0-indexed at positions i and i+1), if they are different, then every subarray that includes both i and i+1 will have an extra block. How many subarrays include both i and i+1? \n  The left index can be from 0 to i (i+1 choices) and the right index must be from i+1 to n-1 (n-i-1 choices). So the total is (i+1) * (n-i-1). But note: the initial code does:\n\n  for i in range(1, n):\n      if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n          ans += i*(n-i)\n\nWait, note: the adjacent pair (i-1, i) is considered at index i (0-indexed). The number of subarrays that include both i-1 and i is: \n  left index from 0 to i-1 (i choices) and right index from i to n-1 (n-i choices). So that's i*(n-i).\n\nSo the initial code does:\n  ans = base (which is the total number of subarrays) = n*(n+1)//2.\n  Then for each adjacent pair (i-1, i) (for i from 1 to n-1, 0-indexed), if they are different, we add i*(n-i).\n\nBut note: the base value is the total number of subarrays? Actually, if the entire array is constant, then the awesomeness of every subarray is 1, so total = n*(n+1)//2. Then when we have adjacent differences, each adjacent difference at (i-1, i) adds an extra block for every subarray that spans from a left index <= i-1 to a right index >= i. And that is exactly i*(n-i) (because left index can be 0..i-1 -> i choices, and right index can be i..n-1 -> n-i choices).\n\nSo the initial setup is correct.\n\nThen for each query (update at index i to value x):\n  We are updating a[i] to x. This update might break the adjacent pairs (i-1, i) and (i, i+1). Also, the old value might have been contributing to these adjacent pairs. So we:\n\n  1. For the left adjacent pair (i-1, i): \n        If i>0 (so that there is a left neighbor):\n          - If the old value at i was different from the old value at i-1, then we had added i*(n-i) (because the adjacent pair is at positions i-1 and i, so the index of the pair is i, and the count is i*(n-i) [because left indices: 0..i-1 -> i choices, right indices: i..n-1 -> n-i choices]). So we subtract that if they were different.\n          - Then we check the new value: if the new value x is different from the old value at i-1 (which is still in the array at i-1), then we add i*(n-i). Otherwise, we don't.\n\n  2. For the right adjacent pair (i, i+1):\n        If i+1 < n (so that there is a right neighbor):\n          - If the old value at i was different from the old value at i+1, then we had added (i+1)*(n-i-1) [because the adjacent pair is at positions i and i+1, so the index of the pair is i+1? Actually, the adjacent pair (i, i+1) is at index i (for the left element) and i+1 (for the right). The number of subarrays that include both i and i+1: left index from 0 to i (i+1 choices) and right index from i+1 to n-1 (n-i-1 choices). So (i+1)*(n-i-1).] So we subtract that if they were different.\n          - Then we check the new value: if the new value x is different from the old value at i+1, then we add (i+1)*(n-i-1). Otherwise, we don't.\n\nBut note: the initial code does:\n\n  if i>0:\n      if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n          ans -= i*(n-i)\n      if x!=li[i-1]:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n\n  if i+1<n:\n      if li[i]!=li[i+1]:\n          ans -= (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n      if x!=li[i+1]:\n          ans += (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\nHowever, in the \"if i>0\" block, after subtracting the old contribution (if any) we then check the new value. But note: the array has not been updated yet. We update li[i] = x after these adjustments.\n\nSo the code for the left adjacent pair (i-1, i) should be:\n\n  if i>0:\n      if li[i] != li[i-1]:   # old values: if they were different, we remove the contribution\n          ans -= i*(n-i)\n      if x != li[i-1]:       # new value: if it is different from the left neighbor, then we add the contribution\n          ans += i*(n-i)\n\nSimilarly, for the right adjacent pair (i, i+1):\n\n  if i+1 < n:\n      if li[i] != li[i+1]:\n          ans -= (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n      if x != li[i+1]:\n          ans += (i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\nBut the initial code in the right adjacent part already has:\n\n      if li[i]!=li[i+1]:\n          ans-=(i+1)*(n-i-1)\n      if x!=li[i+1]:\n          ans+=(i+1)*(n-i-1)\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nHowever, the left adjacent part has a TODO. We need to add the contribution if the new value is different from the left neighbor.\n\nSo the missing line in the left adjacent part is:\n\n      if x != li[i-1]:\n          ans += i*(n-i)\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because the array has not been updated. The current value at index i is still the old value. We are about to update it to x.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is just that one line.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nWe are given multiple test cases. The problem: \n  We can do operations: choose an index i (from 2 to n, 1-indexed) and set a[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]. We can do any number of operations. We want to know if we can make a[2..n] all zeros.\n\nObservations:\n  Note that the operation only changes a[i] (for i>=2) by subtracting a[i-1]. We can do this repeatedly. However, note that we can also change a[i] multiple times. But note: the operations are only allowed on indices from 2 to n.\n\n  Let's denote the array as [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}] (0-indexed). We want to make a1, a2, ... a_{n-1} all 0.\n\n  Consider the last element: a_{n-1}. We can subtract a_{n-2} from it as many times as we want. So we can set a_{n-1} to any nonnegative number that is congruent to a_{n-1} mod a_{n-2}? But note: we can only subtract, so we can only reduce it. However, we can also change a_{n-2} by operations on a_{n-2} (if n>=3) by subtracting a_{n-3} from it. So the problem becomes complex.\n\n  Alternate approach: we can work backwards. Notice that the operations are linear. In fact, we can represent the entire process as a linear combination. However, note the constraints: n<=100, but a_i up to 10^9.\n\n  Insight: \n    We note that the operation is reversible? Actually, we are allowed to do any number of operations. We can model the problem as: we want to know if we can express the entire array in terms of a0 and then set the rest to zero.\n\n  However, note: we cannot change a0. So the entire process must use a0 to cancel out the other terms.\n\n  Let's try small cases:\n\n  n=2: [a0, a1]\n    Operation: set a1 = a1 - k * a0? Actually, we can subtract a0 from a1 any number of times. So we can set a1 to a1 mod a0? But note: we can only subtract, so we can only get nonnegative values? The problem does not say the numbers must remain positive, but the input are positive and the operation subtracts a positive number. However, the problem does not restrict the numbers to remain positive. So we can get negative? But the problem says \"change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}\" and the a_{i-1} is the current value. \n\n  Actually, the operations are sequential and the values change. We can do:\n\n    Operation 1: set a1 = a1 - a0.\n    Then we have [a0, a1 - a0].\n    Then we can do: set a1 = (a1 - a0) - a0 = a1 - 2*a0, and so on.\n\n  So we can set a1 to a1 - k * a0 for any positive integer k. We want a1 - k * a0 = 0. This is possible if and only if a1 is divisible by a0? But note: we can also change a0? No, we cannot change a0 because the operation requires index i>=2 (so the first element is never changed). Therefore, for n=2: we require a1 mod a0 == 0? However, note: we can also do more than one subtraction at a time? Actually, we can do k subtractions until a1 becomes negative? But we want exactly zero. So we require that a1 is divisible by a0? \n\n  But consider: if a1 = 3 and a0=2, then we can do:\n      Operation1: [2, 3] -> [2, 1] (because 3-2=1)\n      Operation2: we cannot do on index2 because we only have two elements? Then we can do index2? Actually, we have two elements: indices 1 and 2? But the array is [2,1]. Now we can do index2? But the array has only two elements: index1 is the first and index2 is the second? The problem says: choose an index i (2<=i<=n). For n=2, i=2 is allowed. Then we set a[2] (which is the second element) to a[2] - a[1] = 1 - 2 = -1. Then we have [2, -1]. Then we can do again: set a[2] = -1 - 2 = -3, and so on. We never get zero.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n      Operation1: [2,3] -> [2,1] (i=2: 3-2=1)\n      Then we can do i=2 again: [2,1] -> [2, -1] -> [2, -3] ... never zero.\n\n  So for n=2: we require that a1 is divisible by a0? But note: we can also do operations in a different order? Actually, we only have one operation: on index2. So we can only subtract a0 from a1 repeatedly. Therefore, we can get zero only if a1 is divisible by a0? \n\n  However, consider: if a0=2, a1=2: then we subtract once: [2,0] -> done.\n\n  But what if a0=2, a1=4: then we subtract twice: [2,4] -> [2,2] -> [2,0]? Actually, after the first subtraction: [2,2] (4-2=2). Then we can subtract again: [2,0]. So we can do it.\n\n  However, what if a0=3, a1=5? \n      Step1: [3,5] -> [3,2] (5-3=2)\n      Step2: [3,2] -> [3, -1] (2-3=-1) -> then we can never get to zero because we are going negative and then we subtract 3 again.\n\n  But note: we can also do more than one operation on the same index? However, the problem does not restrict the order. But we cannot change the first element. So the key is: we can only subtract multiples of a0 from a1? But we are allowed to do arbitrarily many operations. However, if we do k operations, then a1 becomes a1 - k * a0. We want that for some nonnegative integer k, a1 - k * a0 = 0. But note: we can also do operations that interleave with changes to other indices? In n=2, there is no other index. So we require a1 mod a0 == 0? Actually, no: because we can also do k such that a1 - k * a0 = 0 -> k = a1 / a0. But if a1 is not divisible by a0, then we cannot get zero.\n\n  However, wait: what if we do k = floor(a1/a0) and then we get a1 mod a0? Then we have a positive remainder. Then we subtract again and get negative. So we cannot get zero.\n\n  Therefore, for n=2: we require a1 % a0 == 0.\n\n  Now consider n=3: [a0, a1, a2]\n\n  We can do operations on index2 and index3.\n\n  We want to set a1 and a2 to zero.\n\n  How about we set a2 to zero first? \n      We can subtract a1 from a2 multiple times? But note: we can also change a1 by subtracting a0 from it. So the operations are interdependent.\n\n  Alternate approach: we can use the Euclidean algorithm? \n\n  We note that the operations we are allowed are similar to the Euclidean algorithm for GCD. In fact, we can think of the entire process as: we are allowed to subtract any multiple of a0 from a1, and then any multiple of the new a1 from a2? But note: we can do operations in any order and multiple times.\n\n  However, we require that at the end, a1 and a2 are zero. And we cannot change a0.\n\n  So the condition must be that a0 must divide a1, and then a0 must also divide a2? \n\n  But consider the example: [1,2,3] -> which is the second example. The example says it is possible.\n\n  Steps for [1,2,3]:\n      Operation1: i=3: set a2 = 3 - 2 = 1 -> [1,2,1]\n      Operation2: i=2: set a1 = 2 - 1 = 1 -> [1,1,1]\n      Operation3: i=3: set a2 = 1 - 1 = 0 -> [1,1,0]\n      Operation4: i=2: set a1 = 1 - 1 = 0 -> [1,0,0]\n\n  So we did it. But note: 1 divides 2 and 3? Actually, 1 divides everything.\n\n  How about [2,3,4]? \n      We want to set a1 and a2 to zero.\n\n      Step1: we can work on a2: \n          Operation1: a2 = 4 - 3 = 1 -> [2,3,1]\n      Step2: now we can work on a1: \n          Operation2: a1 = 3 - 2 = 1 -> [2,1,1]\n      Step3: then a2: a2 = 1 - 1 = 0 -> [2,1,0]\n      Step4: then a1: a1 = 1 - 2 = -1 -> [2,-1,0] -> then we cannot fix a1.\n\n      Alternatively, after [2,3,1]:\n          Instead of step2, we do on a2: a2 = 1 - 3 = -2 -> [2,3,-2] -> then we can do a1: 3 - 2 = 1 -> [2,1,-2] -> then a2: -2 - 1 = -3 -> ... not working.\n\n      How about a different order? \n          Start: [2,3,4]\n          Operation1: i=2: a1 = 3-2=1 -> [2,1,4]\n          Operation2: i=3: a2 = 4-1=3 -> [2,1,3]\n          Operation3: i=3: a2 = 3-1=2 -> [2,1,2]\n          Operation4: i=3: a2 = 2-1=1 -> [2,1,1]\n          Operation5: i=3: a2 = 1-1=0 -> [2,1,0]\n          Operation6: i=2: a1 = 1-2 = -1 -> [2,-1,0] -> stuck.\n\n      So it seems [2,3,4] is not possible.\n\n  What is the condition?\n\n  Insight: \n    We note that the operations are linear and reversible? Actually, we can model the entire process as a sequence of linear combinations. \n\n    We start with the vector (a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}).\n\n    Operation on index i (0-indexed index i, which is the (i+1)-th element) sets a_i = a_i - a_{i-1}. This is equivalent to adding a multiple of the (i-1)-th basis vector to the i-th? \n\n    However, we are allowed to do any number of operations. So we can represent the final state as:\n\n        a0 remains unchanged.\n        a1 becomes a1 - k1 * a0, for some integer k1? \n        a2 becomes a2 - k2 * a1 - k3 * a0? \n\n    Actually, the operations are not independent. \n\n    We can use the following: \n        We can only change an element by subtracting the element immediately to the left. Therefore, the entire process is equivalent to: we can replace the array with a new array where:\n\n          b0 = a0\n          b1 = a1 - k0 * a0   for some nonnegative integer k0? (but note: we can do arbitrarily many, so k0 can be any nonnegative integer? but we can also do negative? no, because we can only subtract. However, we can do operations that make an element negative and then use that negative value to subtract? \n\n        But note: the operations are sequential and the value of a_{i-1} might change. \n\n    Alternate approach: we can simulate backwards? \n\n    We want to end with [a0, 0, 0, ..., 0]. How did we get the last state? \n\n    The last operation must have been on the last element: we set the last element to 0 by subtracting the previous element (which must have been 0 at that time) from it? But then the previous element must have been 0 at that time. \n\n    Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming? \n\n    However, note the constraints: n<=100, but the numbers are up to 10^9. We cannot iterate over the numbers.\n\n  Another insight: \n    We note that the operations are reversible in the following sense: \n        We start from the desired state: [a0, 0, 0, ..., 0] and we can reverse the operations: \n          Operation in reverse: we can add the left neighbor to the current element arbitrarily many times.\n\n        So the problem becomes: starting from [a0, 0, 0, ..., 0], can we reach the initial array by only adding the left neighbor to the current element arbitrarily many times? \n\n        Reverse operations: \n          We are allowed to do: choose an index i (from 2 to n) and set a_i = a_i + a_{i-1} (because we reverse the subtraction). And we can do this any number of times, and in any order.\n\n        But note: we can also change a_{i-1} arbitrarily? Actually, we can do operations in any order. \n\n        We can use BFS? But the numbers can be huge.\n\n  However, note: we are only asked for possibility. And the reverse operations are nonnegative and increasing. \n\n  We can use a greedy reverse: \n        We start from the given array and try to reduce it to an array with zeros from right to left? \n\n        Actually, we can do:\n\n          We know that the last element (a_{n-1}) in the final state is 0. How was it produced? The last operation that affected it must have been an operation on index n-1 (0-indexed) that set it to 0. Before that operation, the value at n-1 was the value of the element at n-2 (which at that time was some value, say x) and then we set it to x - x = 0? Actually, no: we set it to the current value at n-1 (which we call y) minus the current value at n-2 (which we call x) to get 0. So we must have y = x.\n\n        But note: there might have been operations on n-1 multiple times. So in reverse, we can set the last element to any value that is at least the value of the previous element? \n\n        Actually, in reverse: we can set the last element to any value that is the current value (which is 0) plus a multiple of the previous element. But we can do multiple operations: so we can set the last element to k * a_{n-2} (for any positive integer k) plus 0? \n\n        However, that is not the case: the reverse operation is: \n            a_{n-1} becomes a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}   (and we can do this multiple times: so we can add any multiple of a_{n-2} to a_{n-1}).\n\n        Therefore, to reverse the last step, we can subtract a multiple of a_{n-2} from a_{n-1} until it becomes nonnegative and less than a_{n-2}. But we don't know the exact multiple. However, we can use the Euclidean algorithm style: we can set the last element to the remainder when divided by a_{n-2}? \n\n        But note: we are going backwards. We want to reduce the array to [a0,0,...,0]. \n\n        We can do:\n\n          Step n-1: we look at the last element: if it is greater than or equal to the previous element, we can subtract the previous element from it as many times as possible? But we are going backwards: we are allowed to add arbitrarily, so we can only simulate the reverse by subtracting? \n\n        Actually, we can simulate from the last element backwards:\n\n          We start from the given array. We want to make the array [a0,0,...,0]. We can reverse the operations from the last element to the first.\n\n          Algorithm for one test case:\n\n            Let b = array of length n (the current state we are trying to reduce)\n            We start from the last element and go backwards to the second element (index 1 to n-1, 0-indexed).\n\n            For i from n-1 down to 1:\n                We want to reduce b[i] to zero by subtracting multiples of b[i-1]. But note: we can also change b[i-1] by operations on index i-1? However, we are processing backwards and we haven't processed i-1 yet. \n\n            Actually, we cannot change b[i-1] arbitrarily because we are going backwards. The reverse operation for an element i is: we can subtract multiples of b[i-1] from b[i] until it becomes zero? But then we require that b[i] is divisible by b[i-1]? \n\n            However, consider: we can also have operations on index i that occur after operations on index i-1? \n\n          Alternate known solution: \n            We can use a greedy from right to left: \n                We start from the last element and set it to the remainder when divided by the previous element? But note: we are allowed to do any number of operations, so we can set the last element to the remainder. Then we move to the previous element? \n\n          But note: the example [1,2,3] becomes [1,1,0] then [1,0,0] then [1,0,0]? \n\n          How about we do:\n\n            We process from right to left. For i from n-1 down to 1:\n                if b[i] < b[i-1]: then we cannot subtract? But we can also change b[i-1]? \n\n          Actually, we can change b[i-1] by operations on index i-1 (which subtracts b[i-2]), but we haven't processed i-1 yet. \n\n        Known solution from known problems: \n            This problem is similar to \"Array Reduction\" problems. There is a known solution: \n                The answer is \"YES\" if and only if the GCD of the entire array is the first element, and the first element divides every element.\n\n          But the example [1,2,3]: \n              gcd(1,2,3)=1, and the first element is 1, and 1 divides every element -> YES.\n\n          Example [5,10]: \n              gcd(5,10)=5, and the first element is 5, and 5 divides 10 -> YES.\n\n          Example [2,3,4]:\n              gcd(2,3,4)=1, but the first element is 2, and 2 does not divide 3? -> NO.\n\n          But wait: the example [1,2,3] works because 1 divides 2 and 3. [5,10] works because 5 divides 10. [2,3,4]: 2 does not divide 3 -> NO.\n\n          How about [3, 6, 9]? \n              gcd=3, first element=3, and 3 divides 6 and 9 -> YES.\n\n          How about [3, 5]? \n              3 does not divide 5 -> NO.\n\n          How about [3, 3, 3]? \n              YES.\n\n          How about [3, 0]? \n              But the input says positive integers. So we don't have zeros.\n\n          How about [4, 6]? \n              We can do: \n                  [4,6] -> [4,2] (6-4=2) -> [4,2] -> then we can do [4,2] -> [4, -2] -> ... but we can also do: \n                  [4,6] -> [4,6-4=2] -> then we can do [4,2] -> then we can do [4,2-4=-2] -> ... \n              But we want 0. We cannot get 0 from [4,6]? \n\n          However, 4 does not divide 6? So condition: for each i from 1 to n-1, we require that the first element divides the i-th element? \n\n          But note: in the example [1,2,3]: \n              We have 1 divides 2 -> yes, and 1 divides 3 -> yes.\n\n          However, what about [1, 3, 2]? \n              Step1: set a2 = 2 - 3 = -1 -> then we have [1,3,-1] -> then we can set a1 = 3 - 1 = 2 -> [1,2,-1] -> then set a2 = -1 - 2 = -3 -> ... \n              But wait, the known condition: 1 divides 3 -> yes, 1 divides 2 -> yes. So it should be YES.\n\n          How to do [1,3,2]? \n              We can do:\n                  Operation1: on index2: a1 = 3 - 1 = 2 -> [1,2,2]\n                  Operation2: on index3: a2 = 2 - 2 = 0 -> [1,2,0]\n                  Operation3: on index2: a1 = 2 - 1 = 1 -> [1,1,0]\n                  Operation4: on index2: a1 = 1 - 1 = 0 -> [1,0,0]\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, the condition: \n              We require that the first element a0 must divide every element in the array.\n\n          But wait: what about [2, 3, 5]? \n              Condition: 2 divides 3? -> no -> NO. \n              How would we do it? \n                  [2,3,5] \n                  Operation1: on index3: a2 = 5 - 3 = 2 -> [2,3,2]\n                  Operation2: on index2: a1 = 3 - 2 = 1 -> [2,1,2]\n                  Operation3: on index3: a2 = 2 - 1 = 1 -> [2,1,1]\n                  Operation4: on index3: a2 = 1 - 1 = 0 -> [2,1,0]\n                  Operation5: on index2: a1 = 1 - 2 = -1 -> [2,-1,0] -> stuck.\n\n          So it fails.\n\n          However, what if we do:\n                  [2,3,5] \n                  Operation1: on index2: a1 = 3-2=1 -> [2,1,5]\n                  Operation2: on index3: a2 = 5-1=4 -> [2,1,4]\n                  Operation3: on index3: a2 = 4-1=3 -> [2,1,3]\n                  Operation4: on index3: a2 = 3-1=2 -> [2,1,2]\n                  Operation5: on index3: a2 = 2-1=1 -> [2,1,1]\n                  Operation6: on index3: a2 = 1-1=0 -> [2,1,0]\n                  Operation7: on index2: a1 = 1-2 = -1 -> stuck.\n\n          So it fails.\n\n          Therefore, the condition: the first element must divide every element.\n\n          But note: what about the example [3, 6, 2]? \n              Condition: 3 divides 6 -> yes, 3 divides 2 -> no -> NO.\n\n          How would we do [3,6,2]? \n              Operation1: on index3: a2 = 2 - 6 = -4 -> [3,6,-4] -> then we can do index2: a1 = 6 - 3 = 3 -> [3,3,-4] -> then index3: a2 = -4 - 3 = -7 -> ... \n              Or after [3,6,-4]: then index3: a2 = -4 - 6 = -10 -> ... \n              Or after [3,6,2]: \n                 Operation1: on index2: a1 = 6-3=3 -> [3,3,2]\n                 Operation2: on index3: a2 = 2-3 = -1 -> [3,3,-1] -> then we can do index3: a2 = -1-3=-4 -> ... \n              So it fails.\n\n          Therefore, the condition: for every element a_i, we require that a_i is divisible by a0.\n\n          But wait: what about the intermediate values? For example, in [1,2,3]: we had to change a1 to 1 (by subtracting 1 from 2) and then a2 to 0 (by subtracting 1 from 1). But note: the intermediate values (like 1) are also divisible by a0=1.\n\n          However, what if we have [2,3,1]? \n              Condition: 3 is not divisible by 2 -> fails. \n              But let's try: \n                  Operation1: on index3: a2 = 1-3 = -2 -> [2,3,-2] -> then we can do index2: a1 = 3-2=1 -> [2,1,-2] -> then index3: a2 = -2-1=-3 -> ... \n              Or: \n                  Operation1: on index2: a1=3-2=1 -> [2,1,1] \n                  Operation2: on index3: a2=1-1=0 -> [2,1,0]\n                  Operation3: on index2: a1=1-2=-1 -> [2,-1,0] -> stuck.\n\n          So it fails.\n\n          However, note: the element 1 in the array is divisible by 2? -> no. But we generated 1 as an intermediate value. The condition must hold for the entire process? \n\n          But the problem: we are allowed to do any number of operations. The condition we found (that a0 divides every element in the initial array) is necessary? \n\n          Is it sufficient? \n\n          Consider: we have an array [a0, a1, a2, ..., a_{n-1}] and a0 divides every a_i.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            We want to set the last element to zero. We can subtract the previous element (which we will set to zero later) as many times as needed? But note: we can set the last element to zero by subtracting the previous element exactly (a_{n-1} / a0) times? But the previous element might not be a0.\n\n          However, we can first set the previous element to a0? \n\n          Actually, we can set every element to a0? \n\n          How? \n            For the first element: we cannot change it -> it remains a0.\n            For the second element: we can subtract a0 as many times as needed: we set a1 = a1 mod a0? But we want to set it to a0? \n\n          Alternatively, we can set the entire array to [a0, a0, a0, ..., a0] and then set the last element to zero by subtracting a0, then the next to last by subtracting a0, etc.\n\n          Steps for [a0, a1, a2] (with a0 dividing a1 and a2):\n\n            Step1: set a1 to a1 - k1 * a0 until we get a0? Actually, we can set a1 to a0? \n                We can do: \n                  a1 = a1 - k1 * a0, and we want a1 - k1 * a0 = a0 -> then k1 = (a1 - a0) / a0, which is an integer because a0 divides a1. \n                So we set a1 = a0.\n\n            Step2: set a2 = a2 - k2 * a1 = a2 - k2 * a0. We want to set a2 to a0? Then k2 = (a2 - a0) / a0, which is an integer. Then we set a2 = a0.\n\n            Step3: set a2 = a0 - a0 = 0 (by one subtraction) -> [a0, a0, 0]\n            Step4: set a1 = a0 - a0 = 0 -> [a0,0,0]\n\n          Therefore, the condition is sufficient.\n\n          But note: what if we have [2,4,6]? \n              Step1: set a1 = 4 - 2 = 2 (so k1= (4-2)/2 = 1) -> [2,2,6]\n              Step2: set a2 = 6 - 2 = 4 -> [2,2,4]\n                     then set a2 = 4 - 2 = 2 -> [2,2,2] \n                     then set a2 = 2-2=0 -> [2,2,0]\n              Step3: set a1 = 2-2=0 -> [2,0,0]\n\n          So it works.\n\n          However, what if we have [2, 2, 2]? \n              We can set a2 to 0: subtract a1 (which is 2) -> [2,2,0]\n              Then set a1 to 0: subtract a0 (which is 2) -> [2,0,0]\n\n          Therefore, the solution: \n            For each test case:\n                Read n.\n                Read the array a of n integers.\n                Check: \n                  For every element in a (from index0 to index n-1), if a0 divides that element? \n                But note: the first element is a0, and a0 divides a0.\n\n          However, what if a0 is zero? But the input says positive integers (>=1). So we don't have to worry.\n\n          But wait: what if we have [1, 1000000000, 1000000000]? \n              Condition: 1 divides everything -> YES.\n\n          Therefore, the function diff_ops(arr) in the given code:\n\n            def diff_ops(arr):\n                result = True\n                for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                    result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n                return result\n\n          However, note: what if arr[0] is 1? Then every number mod 1 is 0 -> works.\n\n          But what if the array is [2, 3]? \n              3 % 2 = 1 != 0 -> returns False -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n          But what if the array is [2, 4, 5]? \n              4 % 2 = 0 -> True, but 5 % 2 = 1 -> False -> \"NO\", correct.\n\n          However, what if the array is [2, 0]? \n              But the input says positive integers, so we don't have zero.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"The second line contains n integers a1,a2,\u2026,an (1\u2264ai\u226410^9).\"\n\n          Therefore, the function is correct.\n\n          Now, the main part: reading the test cases.\n\n          The input format:\n            The first integer is t (number of test cases).\n            Then for each test case:\n                first integer: n\n                next n integers: the array.\n\n          The given code:\n\n            input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n            len_input = len(input_arr)\n            n = input_arr[0]   # actually, this n is the number of test cases? But the variable name is n, but then we have test cases. \n\n          Actually, the first integer is t (the number of test cases). Then we have t test cases.\n\n          The code currently sets:\n            n = input_arr[0]   # which is t\n\n          Then we have:\n\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to read t test cases.\n\n          For each test case:\n            we read an integer n (the length of the array) at input_arr[pos], then the next n integers.\n\n          So:\n\n            for i in range(n):   # here n is the number of test cases (which we called t)\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n          But note: the variable n is set to the number of test cases. We should not use n for the array length in the loop. Let's rename:\n\n            t = input_arr[0]\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            for i in range(t):\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_i]\n                pos += n_i\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n          However, the code already has:\n\n            n = input_arr[0]   # which is the number of test cases\n\n          We can do:\n\n            t = n   # but then we lose the original n? \n\n          Alternatively, we can change the variable name for the number of test cases.\n\n          But the code already reads the first integer as n (which is the number of test cases). Then we can do:\n\n            t = n\n            test_cases = []\n            index = 1\n            for i in range(t):\n                n_val = input_arr[index]; index += 1\n                arr = input_arr[index:index+n_val]\n                index += n_val\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n          Then we pass each test case to diff_ops.\n\n          However, note: the function diff_ops(arr) expects the array. \n\n          But what if the array has a zero? The problem says positive integers, so we don't have to worry.\n\n          But note: what if the first element is not the smallest? For example, [4, 2]? \n              Condition: 2 % 4 != 0 -> returns False -> \"NO\", which is correct? \n\n          However, in [4,2]: \n              We can do: \n                  Operation: set a1 = 2 - 4 = -2 -> then we have [4,-2] -> then we can set a1 = -2 - 4 = -6 -> ... we never get zero.\n\n          So the condition is correct.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            t = n   # because the first integer we read is the number of test cases, and we stored it in n\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            for i in range(t):\n                n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n                pos += n_val\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n          But note: the variable n was set to the first integer (which is the number of test cases). Then we use a loop for t (which is n) test cases.\n\n          However, the code already has:\n\n            n = input_arr[0]   # which is the number of test cases\n\n          Then we do:\n\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            for i in range(n):   # n is the number of test cases\n                size = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+size]\n                pos += size\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n          This is the code for the TODO.\n\n  Therefore, we have:\n\n    For program1.py: the missing line is: \"ans += i*(n-i)\" (but note: the code already has that line in the initial setup, and we are only missing the addition in the update for the left adjacent pair). Specifically, in the block for i>0, after subtracting the old contribution (if the old values were different) we then check the new value: if x != li[i-1] then we add i*(n-i).\n\n    So the missing line for program1.py is: \"ans += i*(n-i)\"\n\n    But note: the code already has that line in the initial setup? Actually, in the update part, we are missing the addition for the left adjacent pair when the new value is different from the left neighbor.\n\n    The code for program1.py update for left adjacent pair:\n\n        if i>0:\n            if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n                ans -= i*(n-i)\n            if x != li[i-1]:\n                ans += i*(n-i)   # this is the missing line\n\n    For program2.py: the missing code is:\n\n        for i in range(n):   # n here is the number of test cases\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  However, note: the variable 'pos' is defined and we are using a while loop. The given code has:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n\n    But we know the exact number of test cases: n (which is the first integer). So we can use a for loop.\n\n  But the problem says: the input consists of multiple test cases. The first integer is t (which we read as n). Then we have t test cases.\n\n  So we change the while loop to a for loop? Or we can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # read the next integer as the size\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But the given code has a while loop condition. We can break when we have read all test cases.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But note: the variable 'n' is the first integer (number of test cases). And we are reading exactly n test cases.\n\n  However, the variable 'n' in the outer scope is the number of test cases. We are using it to loop.\n\n  But the code already has:\n\n        n = input_arr[0]   # the first integer\n\n  So we are good.\n\n  But note: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases, and then we use n_val for the size of the current array.\n\n  Now, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\n  Example:\n\n      {\"program1\": \"ans += i*(n-i)\", \"program2\": \"for i in range(n):\\n        n_val = input_arr[pos]\\n        pos += 1\\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\\n        pos += n_val\\n        test_cases.append(arr)\"}\n\n  However, the problem says: Output only the missing code, NOT as markdown code. And the JSON structure.\n\n  But note: the missing code in program1.py is only one line? Actually, the TODO is only one line. But the code block for program1.py has:\n\n        if i>0:\n            if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n                ans -= i*(n-i)\n            if x!=li[i-1]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are to replace the TODO with one line: \"ans += i*(n-i)\".\n\n  For program2.py, we are replacing the while loop with a for loop? Actually, the while loop is given and we are to replace the TODO. The TODO is inside the while loop? The given code:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the entire TODO block? Actually, we are to write the code that reads the test cases. We can write:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But note: the while loop condition is \"while pos <= len_input - 1\", but we know the exact number of test cases. So we break after reading n test cases. We can break the while loop by using a for loop? Or we can break after the for loop? \n\n  Actually, we can simply do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  and then break out of the while loop? But the while loop condition is still there. We can break after the for loop? \n\n  Alternatively, we can change the while loop to a for loop. Since we know we have exactly n test cases, we can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  and then break? But the while loop condition might be true if there are more numbers? But the problem says the input consists of exactly the test cases. So we don't need the while loop. We can remove the while loop and put the for loop.\n\n  Therefore, we can replace the entire while loop with:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But note: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases (the first integer). And we are reading n test cases.\n\n  However, the code already read the first integer as 'n'. Then we have the rest of the integers in input_arr.\n\n  So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But note: the variable 'pos' is initialized to 1 (because the first integer is at index0, and we read that as n). Then the next integer is at index1.\n\n  This is correct.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases. We are using it to loop.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"ans += i*(n-i)\",\n        \"program2\": \"for i in range(n):\\n    n_val = input_arr[pos]\\n    pos += 1\\n    arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\\n    pos += n_val\\n    test_cases.append(arr)\"\n      }\n\n  But the problem says: Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. So we must represent the code as a string. And we must use the exact code.\n\n  However, the program2.py code has indentation. We must use the same indentation as the surrounding code? The surrounding code in the while loop is at the same indentation level? Actually, the TODO is inside the while loop. We are replacing the while loop and the TODO with a for loop? \n\n  Actually, the given code has:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the entire while loop (including the condition and the TODO) with the for loop? \n\n  But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the TODO. We can write:\n\n        # TODO: Your code here   -> we replace this with the for loop, but we must keep the same indentation.\n\n  The while loop is at the same level as the rest. We can break the while loop and put the for loop? \n\n  Actually, we can do:\n\n        # Instead of the while loop, we do:\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But note: the while loop condition is still there. We are replacing the entire while loop? The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill the TODO block. The TODO is inside the while loop. We can write:\n\n        n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n        arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n        pos += n_val\n        test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  and then the while loop will run for the next test case? But we have n test cases. We cannot use a while loop because we know the number of test cases.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]; pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  and then break out of the while loop? But the while loop condition might be true if there are more numbers? The problem says the input is exactly the test cases. So after reading n test cases, we break. We can break after the for loop? \n\n  Actually, we can break the while loop by using:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            ... \n        break\n\n  But that would be:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            for i in range(n):\n                ...\n            break\n\n  But that is inefficient and n is the number of test cases, which we already read.\n\n  The best is to remove the while loop and use the for loop. But the problem says: \"Complete the code\" and the TODO is inside the while loop. We can simply do:\n\n        # We know there are n test cases, so we do:\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  and then the while loop condition will be checked and if we read exactly the input, then pos will be at len_input, so the while loop will break.\n\n  But note: we are reading n test cases, and the total input length is 1 (for n) + n (for the test cases: each test case has 1 for the size and then size numbers) = 1 + n + (sum of sizes) = total integers.\n\n  The while loop condition is: while pos <= len_input-1. After reading the n test cases, if we read exactly the input, then pos will be len_input, so the condition fails.\n\n  But what if we don't break? The for loop runs n times and then the while loop condition is checked again. Then if there is more data, it would run again? But we don't want that.\n\n  Therefore, we break after the for loop? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        # Read the test cases\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n        # Then break the while loop? \n        # But the while loop condition will break naturally if we read all.\n\n  However, if we read all, then pos == len_input, and the while condition fails.\n\n  But what if n is 0? Then we skip the for loop and then the while loop condition: if pos<=len_input-1, then we do nothing? But n=0, then we break.\n\n  Actually, the problem says t>=1, so n>=1.\n\n  So we can do the for loop and then the while loop will break.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program2.py TODO is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But note: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases (the first integer). And we are using it to loop.\n\n  However, the variable 'n' is the same as the outer n? Yes.\n\n  But the code already has:\n\n        n = input_arr[0]   # the first integer is the number of test cases\n\n  So we are good.\n\n  But note: the variable 'n' is the number of test cases, and we are about to use it in a for loop. We must not change it.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer.\n\n  However, note: the program2.py code after the TODO has:\n\n        for case in test_cases:\n            print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n\n  So we are building test_cases.\n\n  We output the JSON.\n\n  Important: the code for program1.py is one line: \"ans += i*(n-i)\".\n\n  But note: the code in program1.py has:\n\n        if i>0:\n            if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n                ans -= i*(n-i)\n            if x!=li[i-1]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with: \"ans += i*(n-i)\".\n\n  But the code must be exactly that line.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"        ans += i*(n-i)\",\n        \"program2\": \"        for i in range(n):\\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\\n            pos += 1\\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\\n            pos += n_val\\n            test_cases.append(arr)\"\n      }\n\n  We include the indentation? The TODO in program1.py is at the same indentation level as the previous if. So we need to indent the line by 8 spaces? Actually, the code has:\n\n        if i>0:\n            if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n                ans -= i*(n-i)\n            if x!=li[i-1]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO line with \"ans += i*(n-i)\" at the same indentation level as the inner ifs (so 8 spaces from the outer if, but 4 more? Actually, the inner ifs are indented by 4 relative to the outer if). \n\n  The outer if: if i>0: -> then the inner blocks are indented by 4. Then the line we add should be indented by 8? \n\n  But the existing code in the same block has:\n\n            if li[i]!=li[i-1]:\n                ans -= i*(n-i)   # this line is indented by 8\n\n  So the line we add should be at 8 spaces.\n\n  Similarly, in program2.py, the while loop is at the same level as the rest. The for loop we are adding should be at the same indentation level as the while loop? Actually, the while loop is:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We are replacing the TODO with the for loop. The for loop should be at the same indentation level as the while loop body? So 4 spaces? \n\n  But the code has:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We replace the TODO with:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                n_val = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n                pos += n_val\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But note: the for loop is inside the while loop. We want to run the for loop once and then break? But the while loop condition will break naturally. However, we are reading all test cases in one go. Then the while loop condition will be false after the for loop.\n\n  But what if the input has more than the required integers? Then the while loop would run again? But we break by reading exactly n test cases. Then the for loop runs n times and then the while loop condition is checked: if there are more integers, then we would run the for loop again? \n\n  We must break after reading n test cases. Therefore, we should break the while loop after the for loop? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        # Read the test cases without the while loop.\n\n  Since we know the number of test cases, we can do:\n\n        test_cases = []\n        index = 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            size = input_arr[index]; index += 1\n            arr = input_arr[index:index+size]\n            index += size\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  and then remove the while loop.\n\n  But the problem says: the TODO is inside the while loop. We are allowed to change the while loop? \n\n  The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We can replace the entire while loop with the for loop? \n\n  We decide to replace the while loop with:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  and then we remove the while condition? \n\n  But the code has:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n  We can replace that entire block (the while loop and the TODO) with the for loop above? \n\n  That would be:\n\n        # Instead of the while loop, we put:\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  But note: the variable 'pos' is already defined. And we are using the same variable.\n\n  This is safe.\n\n  Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is the entire for loop block, and we remove the while loop.\n\n  But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill in the TODO. We can write:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n\n  and then we break out of the while loop? \n\n  Actually, we are replacing the while loop and the TODO with the for loop. \n\n  But the problem says: \"Complete the code\". We are allowed to change the structure? \n\n  Given the constraints, we do:\n\n        # Remove the while loop and put the for loop.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the code that goes in the TODO block? \n\n  But the TODO block is inside the while loop. We can output the for loop and then break? \n\n  Alternatively, we can break the while loop after the for loop? \n\n  We decide to do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n        # Then we break the while loop by making sure we don't run again? \n        # We can break by setting pos to a large value? \n        # Or we can break with a break statement.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n        break\n\n  This will break the while loop.\n\n  But note: the while loop condition is \"while pos <= len_input - 1\", and after reading n test cases, if there is extra data, we break anyway? But the problem says the input is exactly the test cases. So we don't expect extra data.\n\n  But to be safe, we break after reading the test cases.\n\n  Therefore, the code for program2.py TODO is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n        break\n\n  But what if n is 0? Then the for loop runs 0 times and then we break. That is acceptable.\n\n  However, the problem says t>=1, so n>=1.\n\n  But to be generic, we break after the for loop.\n\n  Therefore, the final answer.\n\n  Let's write the JSON.\n\n  For program1.py: the missing line is \"        ans += i*(n-i)\" (with 8 spaces of indentation).\n\n  For program2.py: the missing block is:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n        break\n\n  with the same indentation as the while loop body? The while loop body is indented by 4. So the for loop should be indented by 4, and the break by 4.\n\n  But the for loop body should be indented by 8.\n\n  Example:\n\n        while pos <= len_input - 1:\n            for i in range(n):\n                n_val = input_arr[pos]\n                pos += 1\n                arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n                pos += n_val\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n            break\n\n  But this will break after the first iteration of the while loop. And we only have one test case set? But n is the total number of test cases. We read all test cases in one go.\n\n  This is acceptable.\n\n  Therefore, the JSON:\n\n      {\n        \"program1\": \"        ans += i*(n-i)\",\n        \"program2\": \"        for i in range(n):\\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\\n            pos += 1\\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\\n            pos += n_val\\n            test_cases.append(arr)\\n        break\"\n      }\n\n  But note: the break is at the same level as the for loop (4 spaces). And the for loop body is 8 spaces.\n\n  However, the existing code in program2.py has 4-space indentation. We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            n_val = input_arr[pos]\n            pos += 1\n            arr = input_arr[pos:pos+n_val]\n            pos += n_val\n            test_cases.append(arr)\n        break\n\n  and this is at the same indentation level as the TODO (which is 4 spaces).\n\n  This should be fine.\n\n  Let's output the JSON."
