So indeed, we have the base of 1 for each subsegment, and then for each adjacent pair that is different and that is included in the subsegment, we add 1. Therefore, the total = total_segments + (sum_{i=0}^{N-2} ( (i+1)*(N-1-i) * I{a[i]!=a[i+1]} )) But note: the adjacent pair (i, i+1) might be in the same row or across rows? In the linear array, if we store the matrix in row-major order (first row then second row), then the adjacent pair between the last element of the first row and the first element of the second row is at index (n-1, n) -> and they are not adjacent in the matrix, but in the linear array they are adjacent.",

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the sum of awesomeness values for all contiguous subsegments of an array after each update query. The awesomeness of a subsegment is defined as the minimum number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers into which the subsegment can be split. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing an array of integers and handling multiple queries where each query updates an element of the array. After each update, we need to compute the sum of awesomeness values for all possible contiguous subsegments of the array. The key insight is recognizing that the awesomeness of a subsegment can be derived from the number of adjacent differing elements within it.\n2. **Intuition**: The sum of awesomeness for all subsegments can be broken down into two parts:\n   - The total number of subsegments, which is \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n   - The sum over all adjacent pairs of elements where if the elements differ, they contribute to the awesomeness of subsegments that include them. Specifically, each adjacent pair at position \\( i \\) (0-indexed) contributes \\( (i+1) \\times (n-1-i) \\) to the total sum if the elements differ.\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Initial Setup**: Precompute the contribution of each adjacent pair in the initial array.\n   - **Query Processing**: For each query, update the array and adjust the total awesomeness by considering the changes in the contributions of the adjacent pairs affected by the update. Specifically, updating an element at position \\( pos \\) affects the pairs \\( (pos-1, pos) \\) and \\( (pos, pos+1) \\).\n4. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Precomputation**: \\( O(n) \\) time to compute initial weights and differences.\n   - **Query Processing**: Each query is processed in \\( O(1) \\) time since only a constant number of adjacent pairs are checked per update.\n   - **Overall Complexity**: \\( O(n + m) \\), which is efficient for the constraints \\( 1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5 \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n{\n  \"program1\": \"n, m = map(int, input().split())\\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n\\nif n == 1:\\n    weight = []\\n    total_awesome = 1\\nelse:\\n    weight = [0] * (n-1)\\n    for i in range(n-1):\\n        weight[i] = (i+1) * (n-1-i)\\n    total_segments = n * (n + 1) // 2\\n    diff = []\\n    for i in range(n-1):\\n        if a[i] != a[i+1]:\\n            diff.append(1)\\n        else:\\n            diff.append(0)\\n    total_awesome = total_segments + sum(weight[i] * diff[i] for i in range(n-1))\\n\\nout_lines = []\\nfor _ in range(m):\\n    data = input().split()\\n    i = int(data[0])\\n    x = int(data[1])\\n    pos = i - 1\\n    \\n    if a[pos] == x:\\n        out_lines.append(str(total_awesome))\\n        continue\\n        \\n    if pos - 1 >= 0:\\n        idx = pos - 1\\n        old_diff = 1 if a[pos-1] != a[pos] else 0\\n        new_diff = 1 if a[pos-1] != x else 0\\n        total_awesome += weight[idx] * (new_diff - old_diff)\\n        \\n    if pos + 1 < n:\\n        idx = pos\\n        old_diff = 1 if a[pos] != a[pos+1] else 0\\n        new_diff = 1 if x != a[pos+1] else 0\\n        total_awesome += weight[idx] * (new_diff - old_diff)\\n        \\n    a[pos] = x\\n    out_lines.append(str(total_awesome))\\n    \\nprint(\\\"\\\\n\\\".join(out_lines))\",\n  \"program2\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Setup**: The code reads the array size \\( n \\) and the number of queries \\( m \\). It then reads the initial array \\( a \\).\n2. **Precomputation**: \n   - For \\( n = 1 \\), the total awesomeness is trivially 1 (only one subsegment).\n   - For \\( n > 1 \\), it computes weights for each adjacent pair, where the weight for pair \\( i \\) is \\( (i+1) \\times (n-1-i) \\). The initial differences between adjacent elements are stored, and the total awesomeness is initialized as the sum of the number of subsegments plus the weighted sum of differences.\n3. **Query Processing**: For each query:\n   - If the new value is the same as the current value, the total awesomeness remains unchanged.\n   - Otherwise, it updates the contributions of the adjacent pairs affected by the change (positions \\( pos-1 \\) and \\( pos \\), and \\( pos \\) and \\( pos+1 \\)).\n   - The array is updated, and the new total awesomeness is stored.\n4. **Output**: After processing all queries, the results are printed line by line.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles each query in constant time by leveraging precomputed values and updating only the necessary components of the total awesomeness. The solution is optimal for large input sizes.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are going to solve the problem by tracking the difference in the prefix sums of the two rows for the current arrangement and the desired arrangement.\n The idea is to note that the entire transformation is possible only if the total number of 1s in the current arrangement equals that in the desired arrangement (for both rows? actually, we have two rows and we are swapping within the matrix).\n\n However, note that the problem has two rows. We can consider the entire matrix. But note: the operations are swaps between neighboring cells. Therefore, the total number of 1s in the entire matrix remains constant. Similarly, the total number of 1s in the first row and the second row individually might change? Actually, swapping two adjacent cells (which might be in the same row or in the same column but adjacent row) can change the row counts.\n\n Actually, let's think: \n - If we swap two cells in the same row: then the row counts remain the same for both rows? Actually, no: if we swap two cells in the same row, then the row counts for that row remain the same (because we are swapping within the row) and the other row is untouched. \n - If we swap two cells in adjacent rows (same column? but note: neighboring cells can be vertically adjacent: (1,j) and (2,j)): then we are swapping between the two rows. So the count of the first row and the second row will change: one increases by 1 and the other decreases by 1.\n\n Therefore, the total number of 1s in the entire matrix is invariant. Also, the total number of 1s in the first row of the current arrangement must equal that of the desired arrangement modulo 2? Actually, no: because we can change the row counts by an arbitrary amount? But note: each vertical swap changes the row counts by 1 (one row loses one, the other gains one). Therefore, the difference (current_row1 - desired_row1) must be zero? Actually, we have two rows: the entire matrix total is fixed. So if we let:\n   total_current = (sum of row1_current) + (sum of row2_current)\n   total_desired = (sum of row1_desired) + (sum of row2_desired)\n Then total_current must equal total_desired.\n\n Also, note that the difference (row1_current - row1_desired) must be equal to -(row2_current - row2_desired). So if we let d = (row1_current - row1_desired), then row2_current - row2_desired = -d. Therefore, if d is not zero, we must adjust by swapping vertically? But note: we are allowed to do any sequence of adjacent swaps. However, the problem does not require preserving the row counts? Actually, the desired arrangement has fixed row counts.\n\n Therefore, we must have:\n   total_current = total_desired   (for the entire matrix)\n\n But note: the problem says \"print -1 if it's not possible\". So we must check that the total number of ones in the entire current matrix equals that in the entire desired matrix.\n\n However, the above condition is necessary but is it sufficient? \n\n But note: the problem has two rows and n columns. We can also consider the parity? Actually, the problem does not have a parity constraint. \n\n However, the sample: \n   Input: \n        5 5\n        1 2 3 4 5   -> but wait, the numbers are 1,2,3,4,5? Actually, the array elements are either 0 or 1. So the sample input is:\n\n        \"5 5\n         1 2 3 4 5\" -> this is not possible because the numbers are not 0/1? \n\n Let me check the sample: \n        \"5 5\n        1 2 3 4 5\" -> but the problem says \"each line contains n integers, every one of which is either 0 or 1\". \n\n Actually, the sample input provided in the note is:\n\n        \"5 5\n        1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n but then the next line is the second row? and then the queries? \n\n However, the note says: \n        \"After the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\"\n\n So the initial array is [1,2,3,4,5] for the first row? and the second row? \n\n The input format: \n        first line: n, m\n        second line: first row of current arrangement\n        third line: second row of current arrangement\n        then m lines of queries.\n\n But the sample input:\n\n        5 5\n        1 2 3 4 5\n        ... \n\n This is confusing because the numbers are not 0/1. \n\n Actually, the problem says: \"every element of which is either 0 or 1\". So the sample input must be 0/1. \n\n But the note example: \n        \"5 5\n        1 2 3 4 5\" \n\n This is a mistake? \n\n Looking at the sample input in the code:\n\n        \"\"\"inp_start\n        5 5\n        1 2 3 4 5\n        3 2\n        4 2\n        3 1\n        2 1\n        2 2\n        inp_end\"\"\"\n\n And the current arrangement is two rows? Actually, the input has two rows? \n\n The code reads:\n\n        n, m = ... \n        then next two lines for the current arrangement: \n          a = list of n integers for the first row\n          b = list of n integers for the second row\n\n        then the desired arrangement? \n\n But wait, the problem says: \n        \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n But the input has m queries. \n\n Actually, the input:\n\n        first line: n, m\n        second line: first row of the current arrangement\n        third line: second row of the current arrangement\n        then m lines: each has i and x, meaning update the i-th element of the array a (which array? the entire matrix? note: the matrix has two rows and n columns) \n\n But the problem says: \n        \"the i-th element of the array a\" -> note the array a is the entire matrix? \n\n Actually, the problem states: \n        \"You are given an array a of length n\" -> but then the input has two rows? \n\n This is confusing.\n\n Let me read the problem again: \n        \"The puzzle can be represented as a matrix with 2 rows and n columns\"\n\n And then: \n        \"the current arrangement on the puzzle. Each line contains n integers\"\n\n So the array a is the entire matrix? But the problem says \"array a of length n\", which is not matching.\n\n Actually, the problem says: \n        \"the array a\" and then \"the i-th element of the array a\" -> but the matrix has two rows. \n\n How is the array a stored? \n\n The input: \n        first row: a1, a2, ..., an\n        second row: an+1, an+2, ...? \n\n But the problem says: \n        \"the i-th element of the array a\" -> so the entire matrix is stored as a linear array? \n\n However, the problem also says: \n        \"b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ... , a_r]\" for a subsegment? \n\n But note: the subsegment is contiguous in the linear array? But the matrix has two rows. How are the elements arranged? \n\n The problem does not specify the linearization. \n\n But the example: \n        current arrangement: \n            first row: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n            second row: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\n\n        then the first query: \"3 2\" -> update the 3rd element of the array a to 2.\n\n        So the array a is the entire matrix stored row by row? \n\n        That is: \n            a[0] = first row, first column\n            a[1] = first row, second column\n            ...\n            a[n-1] = first row, last column\n            a[n] = second row, first column\n            ... \n            a[2*n-1] = second row, last column\n\n        But the problem says: \"the i-th element\" (with i from 1 to n) -> so if the array a has length n, then that doesn't match.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have two separate arrays? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"the array a\" and then the input has two rows? \n\n        And the update: \"the i-th element of the array a\" -> meaning the element at position i in the linear array? \n\n        But the example: \n            initial: \n                first row: [1,2,3,4,5]\n                second row: [?,?,?,?,?] -> but the input only provided one line for the current arrangement? \n\n        The sample input: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n        and then the next line? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers ... the array a\"\n            then \"the next two lines\" -> no, the problem says: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\" -> but the input has m queries.\n\n        Actually, the problem input specification: \n            \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries.\"\n\n        So the input: \n            n, m\n            first row of current arrangement (n integers)\n            second row of current arrangement (n integers)\n            then m lines: each with i and x.\n\n        And the desired arrangement is not given as a whole? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        Let me read again: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        But then the queries? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"There are m queries of two integers i, x. A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\"\n\n        And then: \n            \"After each query print the answer\"\n\n        So the desired arrangement is not given at the beginning? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        This is confusing.\n\n        Looking at the sample input: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             6 7 8 9 10   -> this would be the second row of current arrangement?\n             then 5 lines of queries.\n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"The last two lines\" meaning the last two lines of the entire input? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The second line contains ... the array a\" -> but then the next line is the second row? \n\n        And then the queries. \n\n        And the desired arrangement? \n\n        The problem does not give the desired arrangement as a whole. Instead, the desired arrangement is built by applying the queries? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"Alice came up with her own arrangement\" -> meaning the desired arrangement is fixed? \n\n        And then we are updating the current arrangement to the desired arrangement by the queries? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"after each query\" meaning we update the current arrangement and then we want the answer for the current arrangement (which is supposed to become the desired arrangement?).\n\n        But the problem does not say that the desired arrangement is fixed. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        So the input: \n            first line: n, m\n            next two lines: current arrangement (two rows)\n            next two lines: desired arrangement (two rows) \n            then m queries? \n\n        But the sample input has 5 queries and the first two lines after n, m are the current arrangement? \n\n        And then the next two lines are the desired arrangement? \n\n        But the sample input: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             6 7 8 9 10   -> this is the second row of current arrangement?\n             then the next two lines: \n                3 2\n                4 2\n                ... \n\n        That would be 5 lines of queries.\n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        So the desired arrangement is given in the input? \n\n        How many lines? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The last two lines\" -> meaning two lines.\n\n        So the input: \n            n, m\n            current row1\n            current row2\n            desired row1\n            desired row2\n            then m queries? \n\n        But then the queries would be after the desired arrangement? \n\n        And the problem says: \n            \"In the next m lines you are given the descriptions of queries.\"\n\n        So the input: \n            n, m\n            current row1 (n integers)\n            current row2 (n integers)\n            desired row1 (n integers)\n            desired row2 (n integers)\n            then m lines: each with i and x.\n\n        But the sample input has 5 5 and then 5 lines of numbers: \n            line1: 1 2 3 4 5\n            line2: 6 7 8 9 10? -> but the sample input in the code is:\n\n            \"\"\"5 5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            3 2\n            4 2\n            3 1\n            2 1\n            2 2\"\"\"\n\n        This does not have 7 lines.\n\n        Actually, the sample input in the code has:\n            first line: \"5 5\"\n            second line: \"1 2 3 4 5\"   -> current row1?\n            then the next line: \"3 2\" -> that is the first query?

\n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\"\n            \"The third line contains n integers ...\" for the second row of the current arrangement?\n            Then: \"In the next m lines ...\"\n\n        And the desired arrangement is not given? \n\n        But then how do we know the desired arrangement? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"Alice came up with her own arrangement\" -> but then we are updating the current arrangement to become the desired arrangement by a sequence of updates? \n\n        And after each update we want the answer for the current arrangement? \n\n        But the problem does not say that the updates are intended to transform the current arrangement to the desired arrangement. \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \n            \"A query i, x means that from now on the i-th element of the array a is equal to x.\"\n\n        And then we are to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments of the entire array a (which is the entire matrix stored as a linear array?

-> but n is the number of columns, so the array a has 2*n elements? \n\n        The input: \n            first line: n, m -> n is the number of columns, so the array a has 2*n elements.\n\n        Then the next two lines: \n            first row: n integers -> these are a[0] to a[n-1]\n            second row: n integers -> these are a[n] to a[2*n-1]\n\n        Then the queries: \n            each query: i, x -> meaning update the element at position i (1-indexed) to x.\n\n        But note: if i is from 1 to n, then we are updating the first row? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"the i-th element of the array a\", and the array a has 2*n elements. So i should be from 1 to 2*n? \n\n        The input specification: \"1<=i<=n\" -> but n is the number of columns, so i is from 1 to n? \n\n        This is inconsistent.\n\n        The problem says: \n            \"the array a\" of length n? -> but then the matrix has 2 rows and n columns, so the array a should be of length 2*n? \n\n        Or is the array a only the first row? \n\n        The example: \n            \"after the first query a is equal to [1,2,2,4,5]\" -> this is 5 elements, but n=5, so the array a is only the first row? \n\n        But then what is the second row? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"the array a\" and then the input has two rows? \n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        Let me look at the sample input in the note: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n            then the next line is the second row? but the note says: \n                \"after the first query a is [1,2,2,4,5]\" -> so the array a is the first row? \n\n            and the second row is not updated? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"the array a\" and then the input has two rows? \n\n        The problem states: \n            \"The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an\" -> so the array a is the first row? \n            \"The third line contains n integers\" for the second row? \n\n        And the update: \"the i-th element of the array a\" -> meaning the first row? \n\n        But then the entire matrix is composed of the array a (first row) and the array b (second row)? \n\n        And the contiguous subsegment [l, r] would be: \n            if l and r are in [1, n] then it's a contiguous segment in the first row? \n            but the problem says: \n                \"b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\" -> so it's only the first row? \n\n        But the matrix has two rows. \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"the puzzle is a matrix with 2 rows and n columns\"\n\n        and then: \n            \"the array a\" -> which is the first row? \n\n        and then the second row is given separately? \n\n        And the update: \"the i-th element of the array a\" -> only updates the first row.\n\n        But then the second row is never updated? \n\n        And the desired arrangement is not given? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        So the input: \n            n, m\n            current first row (array a)\n            current second row (array b)\n            desired first row\n            desired second row\n            then m queries? \n\n        But the sample input has only 5 5 and then 5 lines: \n            line1: 1 2 3 4 5\n            line2: 3 2   -> this is the first query? \n\n        So it does not have the desired arrangement.\n\n        I think the problem has a mistake in the description. \n\n        After reading the problem again: \n            \"The last two lines\" might be intended to be the desired arrangement, but the sample input does not provide them.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might be: \n            We start with an initial arrangement (two rows) and then we are going to do m updates. After each update, we want to compute the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments of the entire matrix? \n\n        But the entire matrix has two rows. How do we form contiguous subsegments? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\" -> this suggests that the array a is linear. \n\n        How is the matrix linearized? \n\n        The problem does not specify. \n\n        But the example: \n            [1;1] -> [1] (from the first row, first column)\n            [1;2] -> [1,2] (first row, first two columns)\n            [1;3] -> [1,2,2] -> wait, how do we get three elements? \n\n        The matrix has two rows and n columns. The linear array a might be: \n            row-major: first row then second row? \n\n        Then the array a has 2*n elements: \n            indices 0 to n-1: first row\n            indices n to 2*n-1: second row\n\n        Then a contiguous subsegment [l, r] (with 1<=l<=r<=2*n) would be a contiguous segment in this linear array.\n\n        But the example: \n            [1;1] -> a0\n            [1;2] -> a0, a1\n            [1;3] -> a0, a1, a2 -> which are the first three elements of the first row? \n\n        But the matrix only has n columns, so the first row has n elements. \n\n        Then [1; n+1] would be the entire first row and the first element of the second row.\n\n        The awesomeness of a contiguous segment in this linear array is the minimum number of blocks of consecutive identical numbers.\n\n        But note: the segment might wrap from the end of the first row to the beginning of the second row? \n\n        For example, if we take [n; n+1]: \n            a_{n-1} (last of first row) and a_n (first of second row) -> these are two consecutive elements in the linear array, but they are not adjacent in the matrix? \n\n        In the matrix, the cell (1, n) and (2,1) are not adjacent (unless n=1). \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"neighboring cells\" for swapping: |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|=1.\n\n        But for the contiguous segment in the linear array, the awesomeness is defined by consecutive identical numbers. The linear array does not care about the matrix structure? \n\n        However, the swapping operations are defined on the matrix. \n\n        The problem: \n            We start with a matrix (2 rows, n columns) and we can swap neighboring cells (adjacent in the matrix). \n            We are allowed to do swaps arbitrarily. \n            We want to transform the matrix into the desired arrangement? \n\n        But the problem does not say that. It says: \n            \"Alice doesn't like the way in which the cells are currently arranged, so she came up with her own arrangement\"\n\n        And then: \n            \"help her find the minimal possible number of operations in which she can get the desired arrangement\"\n\n        But then the input has queries that update the current arrangement? \n\n        And after each update, we are to print the minimal number of operations to get the desired arrangement? \n\n        But the desired arrangement is not given? \n\n        Or is the desired arrangement fixed and we are to simulate the updates and after each update compute the minimal number of operations to achieve the desired arrangement from the current arrangement? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"after each query print the minimal possible number of steps, otherwise print -1\"\n\n        But then we would need to know the desired arrangement. \n\n        The input specification: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        So the input has: \n            n, m\n            current_row1\n            current_row2\n            desired_row1\n            desired_row2\n            then m queries (which update the current arrangement)\n\n        And after each query (which updates the current arrangement), we want the minimal number of swaps to transform the current arrangement (which is updated) into the desired arrangement.\n\n        But then the answer after each query is the minimal number of swaps to go from the current state (after the update) to the desired state.\n\n        However, the sample input in the code does not have the desired arrangement. \n\n        The sample input: \n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\n             3 2\n             4 2\n             3 1\n             2 1\n             2 2\"\n\n        This has only 6 lines, but we expect 2 lines for the desired arrangement and then 5 queries -> total 2 (n,m) + 2 (current) + 2 (desired) + 5 = 11 lines? \n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        I think the sample input in the code is only the current arrangement for the first row? and the second row is missing? \n\n        And the desired arrangement is not given? \n\n        And the queries update the current arrangement? \n\n        And then we are to compute, after each update, the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments of the entire matrix? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"print the minimal possible number of steps\" to achieve the desired arrangement, but the desired arrangement is not given.\n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        Let me read the problem statement again: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement in the same format.\"\n\n        So the input has two more lines for the desired arrangement.\n\n        Therefore, the sample input should be:\n\n            n, m\n            current_row1\n            current_row2\n            desired_row1\n            desired_row2\n            then m queries.\n\n        But the sample input in the code has:\n\n            \"\"\"5 5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            3 2\n            4 2\n            3 1\n            2 1\n            2 2\"\"\"\n\n        This is 6 lines. \n\n        How can we have desired arrangement in two lines? \n\n        It must be that the sample input is:\n\n            n=5, m=5\n            current_row1 = [1,2,3,4,5]\n            current_row2 = [6,7,8,9,10]   -> but this is not provided.\n\n        And desired_row1 and desired_row2 are also not provided.\n\n        This is a mystery.\n\n        After re\u2010examining the sample input in the note: \n            \"After the first query a is equal to [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]\"\n\n        and the answer is 29.\n\n        And the initial current arrangement is: \n            first row: [1,2,3,4,5]\n            second row: ? \n\n        The first query: \"3 2\" -> update the 3rd element of the array a to 2.\n\n        If the array a is the first row, then after the first query: \n            first row becomes [1,2,2,4,5] -> matches.\n\n        Then what is the second row? It is not updated and not given in the input? \n\n        And the desired arrangement is not mentioned.\n\n        And the answer after the first query is 29.\n\n        Therefore, the problem might be: \n            We have an array a (which is the first row) and an array b (the second row) -> but the problem only updates the array a.\n\n        And the contiguous subsegments are taken from the entire matrix? \n\n        How? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"b = [a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]\" -> only the array a? \n\n        But then the second row is not used? \n\n        This is not matching the example: \n            In the example, they split [1,2,2,4,5] into blocks, but also they have a second row? \n\n        The example also lists subsegments that include the second row? \n\n        For example: \n            [2;2] (which is the second element of the first row) -> [2]\n            [2;3] -> [2,2] (first row, second and third)\n            [2;4] -> [2,2] (first row) and [4] (first row) -> but wait, the example says: \n                [2;4]: [2,2] and [4] -> but then what about the second row? \n\n        The example also has:\n            [4;5]: [4] and [5] -> first row, fourth and fifth.\n\n        And [5;5]: [5] -> first row, fifth.\n\n        But then what about the second row? \n\n        The example also has:\n            [1;5] -> [1], [2,2], [4], [5] -> 4 blocks.\n\n        But the second row is not mentioned.\n\n        This suggests that the contiguous subsegments are only on the first row? \n\n        But the problem says the matrix has two rows.\n\n        And the example in the note also lists subsegments that include the second row? \n\n        Let me check: \n            [2;5]: [2,2] (first row, second and third) and then [4] (first row, fourth) and [5] (first row, fifth) -> but then what about the second row? \n\n        The example also has: \n            [2;5] in the first row: [2,2,4,5] -> split into [2,2], [4], [5] -> 3 blocks.\n\n        But the example also has: \n            [3;5]: [2] (first row, third), [4] (first row, fourth), [5] (first row, fifth) -> 3 blocks.\n\n        And [4;5]: [4,5] -> 2 blocks.\n\n        And [5;5]: 1 block.\n\n        But then the second row is not used? \n\n        The example also has: \n            [1;1]: [1] -> first row, first element.\n\n        So it seems the contiguous subsegments are only on the first row.\n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"the array a\" of length n (the first row) and then the second row is given? \n\n        And the update: \"the i-th element of the array a\" -> only the first row.\n\n        Then what is the second row used for? \n\n        The problem says the matrix has two rows, but then the contiguous subsegments are only on the first row? \n\n        This is not consistent.\n\n        Alternatively, the contiguous subsegment [l, r] might be in the linear array that is the first row concatenated with the second row? \n\n        But then the example: \n            [1;1]: a0 = 1\n            [1;2]: a0=1, a1=2\n            [1;3]: a0=1, a1=2, a2=3 -> but after the first query, the first row becomes [1,2,2,4,5], so the second row is unchanged? \n\n        What is the second row initially? \n\n        The sample input does not provide it.\n\n        Given the complexity and the time, and since the problem is from a contest, I recall that there is a known solution for a similar problem: \n            We are to compute the sum of (number of contiguous segments) over all contiguous subsegments of an array, and support updates.\n\n        And the awesomeness of an array b of length L is: 1 + (number of i from 1 to L-1 such that b[i] != b[i-1])\n\n        Therefore, the awesomeness for a contiguous subsegment [l, r] is: 1 + (# of indices j from l+1 to r such that a[j] != a[j-1])\n\n        Then the sum over all contiguous subsegments is: \n            = (number of subsegments) + (for each adjacent pair (i-1, i), the number of subsegments that include this pair and for which a[i] != a[i-1])\n\n        Let:\n            total_segments = n*(n+1)//2   for a single array of length n? \n            but our array has length N = 2*n? \n\n        Actually, the contiguous subsegments are taken from the entire linear array of length N=2*n.\n\n        So total_segments = N*(N+1)//2.\n\n        And for an adjacent pair (i, i+1) (0-indexed), the number of subsegments that include this adjacent pair is: \n            left_bound can be from 0 to i, and right_bound can be from i+1 to N-1, so (i+1) * (N-1-i)\n\n        But only if a[i] != a[i+1], then this adjacent pair contributes 1 to the awesomeness of the subsegment.\n\n        Therefore, the total awesomeness sum = total_segments + (sum over i from 0 to N-2 of ( (i+1)*(N-1-i) * I{a[i]!=a[i+1]} ))\n\n        However, note: the awesomeness for a subsegment [l, r] is 1 + (# of indices j in [l+1, r] with a[j]!=a[j-1]).\n        So indeed, we have the base of 1 for each subsegment, and then for each adjacent pair that is different and that is included in the subsegment, we add 1.\n\n        Therefore, the total = total_segments + (sum_{i=0}^{N-2} ( (i+1)*(N-1-i) * I{a[i]!=a[i+1]} ))\n\n        But note: the adjacent pair (i, i+1) might be in the same row or across rows? \n\n        In the linear array, if we store the matrix in row-major order (first row then second row), then the adjacent pair between the last element of the first row and the first element of the second row is at index (n-1, n) -> and they are not adjacent in the matrix, but in the linear array they are adjacent.\n\n        However, the awesomeness is defined on the contiguous subsegment of the linear array, so it doesn't care about the matrix structure.\n\n        Therefore, we can use the above formula.\n\n        But then the problem has updates: update one element at position i (1-indexed) in the array a (which is the linear array of length 2*n).\n\n        When we update a[i-1] (0-indexed), it can affect at most three adjacent pairs: \n            (i-2, i-1), (i-1, i), (i, i+1)   [if they exist]\n\n        So we can maintain:\n            total = total_segments (which is fixed) + (a dynamic sum over adjacent pairs)\n\n        Let N = 2*n.\n        total_segments = N*(N+1)//2.\n\n        Let diff[i] = 1 if a[i] != a[i+1] else 0, for i in [0, N-2].\n\n        Then the dynamic part = sum_{i=0}^{N-2} ( (i+1)*(N-1-i) * diff[i] )\n\n        Initially, we can compute this.\n\n        For each query: \n            pos = i-1 (0-indexed position in the linear array)\n            update a[pos] = x.\n\n            Then we update the adjacent pairs: \n                if pos-1 >= 0: the pair (pos-1, pos) might change.\n                if pos+1 < N: the pair (pos, pos+1) might change.\n                if we are at the boundary between the two rows? -> but the linear array is contiguous.\n\n            However, note: if pos is in the first row, then the next element is in the first row (if not last of the row) or the first of the second row (if last of the first row). Similarly for the second row.\n\n            But the formula for the adjacent pair does not care about the row boundary.\n\n            Steps for update:\n                Let old_value = a[pos]\n                Set a[pos] = x.\n\n                For each adjacent pair that involves pos (which are (pos-1, pos) and (pos, pos+1)):\n                    For each of these pairs, we will:\n                        1. If the pair index is j (for the pair (j, j+1)), then subtract (j+1)*(N-1-j) * (old_diff for that pair) from the dynamic sum.\n                        2. Update the diff for that pair: \n                              new_diff = 1 if a[j] != a[j+1] else 0\n                        3. Add (j+1)*(N-1-j) * new_diff.\n\n                Then the total awesomeness = total_segments + dynamic_sum.\n\n            And we output this total.\n\n        But wait, the problem says: \n            \"print the minimal possible number of steps\" to achieve the desired arrangement? \n\n        But in this interpretation, we are not given the desired arrangement. We are only given the current arrangement and we are updating it, and after each update we are computing the sum of awesomeness over all contiguous subsegments of the current arrangement.\n\n        And the sample: \n            after the first query: \n                n=5, so N=10.\n                total_segments = 10*11//2 = 55.\n\n                But the sample answer is 29.\n\n        55 is already bigger than 29.\n\n        So this is not matching.\n\n        Therefore, the contiguous subsegments are not taken on the entire linear array of length 2*n, but only on the first row? \n\n        Then N = n (the length of the first row).\n\n        Then total_segments = n*(n+1)//2 = 15 for n=5.\n\n        And then we add the dynamic part for the first row.\n\n        In the first row after the first query: [1,2,2,4,5]\n\n        Adjacent pairs in the first row:\n            index0: 1 and 2 -> diff[0]=1 -> contribution: 1 * (5-1-0) = 1*4 = 4? \n            index1: 2 and 2 -> diff[1]=0\n            index2: 2 and 4 -> diff[2]=1 -> 3 * (5-1-2)=3*2=6\n            index3: 4 and 5 -> diff[3]=1 -> 4 * (5-1-3)=4*1=4\n\n        total = 15 + (4+6+4) = 29.\n\n        This matches.\n\n        Therefore, the problem is only about the first row? \n\n        But then what is the second row for? \n\n        The problem says the matrix has two rows, but the contiguous subsegments are only on the first row? \n\n        And the update: \"the i-th element of the array a\" -> the array a is the first row.\n\n        And the second row is given in the input but never used? \n\n        And the desired arrangement is not used? \n\n        But the problem says: \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        However, the sample input in the code does not have the second row and the desired arrangement. \n\n        Given the sample input in the code has only one row and then the queries, and the sample output for the first query is 29, it must be that the problem only considers the first row.\n\n        But the problem title: \"Monoblock\" and the matrix with two rows -> why two rows then? \n\n        And the example in the note also lists subsegments that include the second row? \n\n        Let me check the example in the note: \n            \" [1; 1]: [1] -> 1 block\n              [1; 2]: [1] + [2] -> 2 blocks\n              [1; 3]: [1] + [2,2] -> 2 blocks\n              [1; 4]: [1] + [2,2] + [4] -> 3 blocks\n              [1; 5]: [1] + [2,2] + [4] + [5] -> 4 blocks\n              [2; 2]: [2] -> 1 block\n              [2; 3]: [2,2] -> 1 block\n              [2; 4]: [2,2] + [4] -> 2 blocks\n              [2; 5]: [2,2] + [4] + [5] -> 3 blocks\n              [3; 3]: [2] -> 1 block\n              [3; 4]: [2] + [4] -> 2 blocks\n              [3; 5]: [2] + [4] + [5] -> 3 blocks\n              [4; 4]: [4] -> 1 block\n              [4; 5]: [4] + [5] -> 2 blocks\n              [5; 5]: [5] -> 1 block\"\n\n        This is for a array of length 5: [1,2,2,4,5] -> only one row.\n\n        So the second row is not used.\n\n        Therefore, the problem has a mistake in the description: the matrix has only one row? \n\n        But the problem says: \"matrix with 2 rows and n columns\", and then the input has two rows.\n\n        And the sample input in the code has only one row.\n\n        This is very confusing.\n\n        Given the time, and the sample input and output, I will assume that the contiguous subsegments are taken only on the first row, and the second row is not used.\n\n        Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            # The next line is the second row, but we don't use it? \n            # But the input has it, so we must read it.\n            b = list(map(int, input().split()))   # but then we ignore it.\n\n            # Then there are the desired arrangement? \n            # The problem says: \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n            # But then there are m queries.\n\n            # So we read:\n            desired_row1 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            desired_row2 = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # But then the queries: \n            queries = []\n            for i in range(m):\n                queries.append(list(map(int, input().split())))\n\n            # However, the sample input in the code does not have these two lines for desired arrangement.\n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        Alternatively, the desired arrangement might be given in the input, but the sample input in the code is incomplete.\n\n        Given the problem statement in the code: \n            \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\"\n\n            and then the sample input:\n\n            \"\"\"5 5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            3 2\n            4 2\n            3 1\n            2 1\n            2 2\"\"\"\n\n        This has only one row provided.\n\n        Therefore, I think the intended solution is to ignore the second row and the desired arrangement, and the contiguous subsegments are on the first row.\n\n        And the update: only the first row is updated.\n\n        So we will:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            # The next line is the second row, but the sample input doesn't have it? \n            # In the sample input, after the first line \"5 5\", the next line is \"1 2 3 4 5\", and then the next line is \"3 2\" (the first query).\n\n            # Therefore, there is no second row in the input? \n\n            # But the problem says: \n            #   \"The second line contains n integers ... the array a\"\n            #   \"The third line contains n integers\" for the second row.\n\n            # So we must read the second row.\n\n            # How to reconcile with the sample input? \n\n            # The sample input has only one row and then the queries.\n\n            # This is a contradiction.\n\n        Given the sample input in the code has only one row and then the queries, and the desired arrangement is not given, and the problem says the last two lines are the desired arrangement, I think there is a mistake in the problem statement.\n\n        But the code in the problem statement has:\n\n            n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            # then the next line is the second row? \n            # but then the desired arrangement? \n\n        Since the sample input does not provide them, and the problem in the note only uses one row, I will assume that the array a is only one row of length n.\n\n        Therefore, we do not read the second row.\n\n        Steps:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Precompute the total_segments = n*(n+1)//2\n            # Precompute the dynamic sum for adjacent pairs: for i in range(n-1):\n            #   weight[i] = (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n            #   diff[i] = 1 if a[i] != a[i+1] else 0\n            #   total_awesome = total_segments + sum( weight[i] * diff[i] for i in range(n-1) )\n\n            # For each query (i, x):\n            #   pos = i-1 (0-indexed)\n            #   We are going to update a[pos] = x.\n            #   This may affect the adjacent pairs: \n            #       if pos-1 >=0: the pair (pos-1, pos)\n            #       if pos+1 < n: the pair (pos, pos+1)\n            #   For each of these pairs, we do:\n            #       old_diff = 1 if the two elements were different before the update, else 0.\n            #       new_diff = 1 if after update the two elements are different, else 0.\n            #       total_awesome = total_awesome - weight[index] * old_diff + weight[index] * new_diff\n            #   Then output total_awesome.\n\n            # But note: the pair (pos-1, pos) is at index = pos-1 in the diff array.\n            #   the pair (pos, pos+1) is at index = pos in the diff array.\n\n        However, the sample input has:\n\n            initial a = [1,2,3,4,5]\n            total_segments = 15.\n\n            adjacent pairs:\n                i=0: 1,2 -> diff=1 -> weight[0] = 1 * (5-1-0) = 4 -> contribution 4.\n                i=1: 2,3 -> diff=1 -> weight[1] = 2 * (5-1-1)=2*3=6 -> 6.\n                i=2: 3,4 -> diff=1 -> weight[2]=3*(5-1-2)=3*2=6 -> 6.\n                i=3: 4,5 -> diff=1 -> weight[3]=4*(5-1-3)=4*1=4 -> 4.\n            total_awesome = 15 + (4+6+6+4) = 15+20 = 35.\n\n            But after the first query: update a[2] (0-indexed index 2) to 2 -> a = [1,2,2,4,5]\n\n            Recompute:\n                pairs:\n                  0: 1,2 -> 1 -> 4\n                  1: 2,2 -> 0 -> 0\n                  2: 2,4 -> 1 -> 6\n                  3: 4,5 -> 1 -> 4\n                total = 15 + (4+0+6+4) = 15+14=29. -> matches.\n\n            So the first query output is 29.\n\n        Therefore, we will do:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Precompute weight array for i in range(n-1): weight[i] = (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n            weight = [0] * (n-1)\n            for i in range(n-1):\n                weight[i] = (i+1) * (n-1-i)\n\n            # Precompute initial diff array and total_awesome\n            total_segments = n*(n+1)//2\n            diff = [0] *

total_segments + sum( weight[i] * diff[i] for i in range(n-1) )\n\n            # Alternatively, we can maintain total_awesome and update it per query.\n\n            # We'll create an array a of size

the same as the old value, then skip? \n                if a[pos] == x:\n                    # then no change, but we still need to output the current total_awesome.\n                    print(total_awesome)\n                    continue\n\n                # Otherwise, update a[pos] = x.\n                # Check the left neighbor: at index pos-1\n                if pos-1 >= 0:\n                    # the pair (pos-1, pos) is at index = pos-1 in the diff array.\n                    old_val_left = a[pos-1]\n                    old_val_here = a[pos]\n                    # Before

total_awesome: subtract weight[pos-1] * old_diff_left, then add weight[pos-1] * new_diff_left.\n                    total_awesome = total_awesome - weight[pos-1]*old_diff_left + weight[pos-1]*new_diff_left\n\n                # Check the right neighbor: at index pos+1\n                if pos+1 < n:\n                    old_val_here = a[pos]\n                    old_val_right =

total_awesome - weight[pos]*old_diff_right + weight[pos]*new_diff_right\n\n                # Update a[pos] to x.\n                a[pos] = x\n\n                print(total_awesome)\n\n        But note: the sample input has 5 queries, and the first query outputs 29.\n\n        However, the problem says: \n            \"print -1 if it's not possible\"\n\n        When is it not possible? \n\n        In this interpretation, we are not transforming to a desired arrangement, so it's always possible to have the current arrangement? \n\n        But the problem might have intended the desired arrangement, and we are to compute the minimal number of swaps to achieve the desired arrangement from the current arrangement.\n\n        However, the sample output is 29, which is the sum of awesomeness for the current arrangement, not the number of swaps.\n\n        The problem says: \n            \"find the minimal possible number of operations in which she can get the desired arrangement\"\n\n        But then the output for the first query is 29, which is not a number of swaps.\n\n        This is a contradiction.\n\n        Given the sample output in the note is 29, and the sample input in the code, I think the problem has a mistake in the English description.\n\n        The problem likely meant: \n            \"after each query, print the sum of awesomeness values among all subsegments of array a\"\n\n        as in the output specification.\n\n        Therefore, we output the sum of awesomeness for the current arrangement after the update.\n\n        And we never need to output -1.\n\n        But the problem says: \"print -1 if it's not possible\", so when is it not possible? \n\n        In this interpretation, it's always possible to have the current arrangement (because we are setting it by the query), so we never output -1.\n\n        Therefore, we can assume it's always possible.\n\n        However, the sample input in the problem statement has a second example: \n            \"In the second example no matter what swaps you do, you won't get the desired arrangement, so the answer is -1.\"\n\n        This suggests that the problem is about transforming the current arrangement to the desired arrangement by swaps, and then the answer for a query is the minimal number of swaps to achieve the desired arrangement from the current arrangement (after the update).\n\n        But then the output for the first example would be the number of swaps (5), not 29.\n\n        This is not matching.\n\n        Given the complexity and the sample input/output in the code, I will output the code that computes the sum of awesomeness for the current arrangement (which is a row of length n) after each update.\n\n        And if the problem intended something else, then this might fail.\n\n        But the sample input in the code has:\n\n            \"5 5\n             1 2 3 4 5\"\n\n            queries: \n                3 2 -> output 29\n                4 2 -> output 2? \n                3 1 -> output ... \n                ...\n\n        We can compute:\n\n            After first query: a = [1,2,2,4,5] -> 29.\n\n            Second query: update a[3] (0-indexed index 3) to 2 -> a = [1,2,2,2,5]\n\n            Pairs:\n               0: 1,2 -> 1 -> 4\n               1: 2,2 -> 0 -> 0\n               2: 2,2 -> 0 -> 0\n               3: 2,5 -> 1 -> 4\n            total = 15 + 4+0+0+4 = 23.\n\n            So output 23.\n\n            Third query: update a[2] (0-indexed index 2) to 1 -> a = [1,2,1,2,5]\n\n            Pairs:\n               0: 1,2 -> 1 -> 4\n               1: 2,1 -> 1 -> 6\n               2: 1,2 -> 1 -> 6\n               3: 2,5 -> 1 -> 4\n            total = 15 + 4+6+6+4 = 35.\n\n            Fourth query: update a[1] (0-indexed index 1) to 1 -> a = [1,1,1,2,5]\n\n            Pairs:\n               0: 1,1 -> 0 -> 0\n               1: 1,1 -> 0 -> 0\n               2: 1,2 -> 1 -> 6\n               3: 2,5 -> 1 -> 4\n            total = 15+0+0+6+4 = 25.\n\n            Fifth query: update a[1] (0-indexed index 1) to 2 -> a = [1,2,1,2,5] -> same as after third query, 35.\n\n            So the outputs: \n                29\n                23\n                35\n                25\n                35\n\n        But the sample input in the code does not provide the desired outputs.\n\n        However, the problem in the note only provided the first query output.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem says the matrix has two rows, but we are only using one row.\n\n        Given the above, I will write the code for one row.\n\n        However, the problem might have intended the entire matrix (two rows) linearized, and then the awesomeness is defined on contiguous subsegments of the linear array.\n\n        But then the sample output for the first query would be 35 (as computed above for the initial state) and after the first query 29 for the first row alone doesn't make sense.\n\n        Alternatively, the awesomeness for the entire matrix (linearized) for the initial state [1,2,3,4,5] for the first row and say the second row is [6,7,8,9,10] (which is not given) -> then the linear array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] -> every adjacent pair is different -> \n            total_segments = 55.\n            dynamic_sum = for i from 0 to 8: weight[i] =

 i6: 7*3=21\n                i7: 8*2=16\n                i8: 9*1=9\n            total = 55 + (9+16+21+24+25+24+21+16+9) = 55 + 165 = 220.\n\n        After the first query: update the third element (0-indexed index 2) to 2 -> \n            linear array: [1,2,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n            changes in pairs:\n                index1: (1,2) -> (2,2): from 1 to 0 -> subtract weight[1]=16, then add 0 -> so 220 - 16 = 204.\n                index2: (2,3) becomes (2,4): from 1 to 1 -> no change? \n                But wait, the element at index2 changed from 3 to 2, so:\n                  pair (index1: a[1] and a[2]): from (2,3) to (2,2) -> from 1 to 0 -> we already did.\n                  pair (index2: a[2] and a[3]): from (3,4) to (2,4) -> from 1 to 1 -> no change.\n            So total = 204.\n\n        But 204 is not 29.\n\n        Therefore, the one-row interpretation is the one that matches the sample.\n\n        Conclusion: \n          We ignore the second row and the desired arrangement. \n          We only use the first row.\n\n        But then why does the input have a second row? \n\n        The problem says: \n            \"The second line contains n integers ... the array a\"\n            \"The third line contains n integers\" for the second row.\n\n        So we must read it, but then ignore it.\n\n        And then the desired arrangement: two lines? \n            \"The last two lines describe Alice's desired arrangement\"\n\n        But the sample input does not have them.\n\n        Given the sample input in the code has only one row and then the queries, we will:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            # read the second row and ignore it\n            b = input()   # we read and ignore\n\n            # then there are m queries.\n\n        But the problem says the last two lines are the desired arrangement, and then the queries.\n\n        This is not in the sample input.\n\n        Therefore, I think the problem statement has a mistake.\n\n        Since the sample input in the code has only one row and then the queries, and the desired arrangement is not used, and the second row is not used, we will assume:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            # and then there are m lines of queries.\n\n        And we hope that the actual test data follows the sample input format.\n\n        If the actual test data has the second row and the desired arrangement, then we will read them as well.\n\n        But the problem says the input has m queries, and the sample input has m lines after the first row.\n\n        Given the constraints, we will assume the input has only one row and then m queries.\n\n        Code for program1.py:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Precompute weight array for adjacent pairs: for i in

 total_awesome += weight[i] * diff[i]\n\n            # We'll store the current array a\n            # For each query:\n            out_lines = []\n            for _ in range(m):\n                data

However, the problem says: \"print -1 if it's not possible\", but we never print -1.\n\n        Given the sample input in the note has a second example that outputs -1, we must consider when to output -1.\n\n        But in our interpretation, it's always possible to have the current arrangement (because we are setting it by the query), so we never output -1.\n\n        Therefore, if the intended problem is about the sum of awesomeness for the current arrangement, then we are done.\n\n        If the intended problem is about the minimal number of swaps to achieve the desired arrangement, then we have to do something else.\n\n        Given the sample output for the first example is 29 (which is the sum of awesomeness) and not the number of swaps, and the problem output specification says to output the answer to each query on a new line, and the sample output is 29, we output the sum of awesomeness.\n\n        For the second example that outputs -1, we never encounter it in this interpretation.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code as above.\n\n        But note: the problem has two programs: program1.py and program2.py.\n\n        The user request: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        And then we are to output the missing code for both.\n\n        But the provided code for program1.py is:\n\n            n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # and then the sample input\n\n        So we are to complete program1.py.\n\n        And program2.py is not provided.\n\n        The user says: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n        This suggests that program1.py outputs something that is piped to program2.py.\n\n        But in our solution, program1.py outputs the answers for the queries.\n\n        What is program2.py for? \n\n        The user does not provide program2.py.\n\n        Given the complexity, I will assume that we are only to complete program1.py and program2.py is not needed, or is provided.\n\n        But the output format is a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n        Therefore, we will output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"the code for program1.py\",\n                \"program2\": \"the code for program2.py\"\n            }\n\n        But we are not given program2.py.\n\n        The user says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        So both might have missing parts.\n\n        However, the user only provided program1.py in the example.\n\n        For program2.py, we have no information.\n\n        Therefore, I will only complete program1.py and leave program2.py as an empty string.\n\n        But the sample input in the code for program1.py has:\n\n            \"\"\"inp_start\n            5 5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            3 2\n            4 2\n            3 1\n            2 1\n            2 2\n            inp_end\"\"\"\n\n        This is the input for program1.py.\n\n        And program1.py should output:\n\n            29\n            23\n            35\n            25\n            35\n\n        Then program2.py would take this output and do something? \n\n        The user says: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\n\n        What is the desired output of the entire pipeline? \n\n        The problem says: \"print the answer to each query on a new line\", so program1.py already does that.\n\n        Why pipe to program2.py? \n\n        Perhaps program2.py is a checker or something.\n\n        Given the lack of information, I will assume that program2.py is not modified and is provided, so we don't need to change it.\n\n        Therefore, we only output the completion for program1.py.\n\n        But the user says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the provided program1.py has:\n\n            n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        and then the sample input.\n\n        So the missing code is from after reading 'a' to the end.\n\n        We'll output the completion for program1.py as a string.\n\n        And for program2.py, since we are not given any code, we output an empty string.\n\n        However, the user might expect program2.py to be completed as well.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" and then the description, and then the code for program1.py.\n\n        And then it says: \"Code:\" and then the code for program1.py.\n\n        So we only have program1.py to complete.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"the completed code for program1.py (from the provided code to the end)\",\n                \"program2\": \"\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the provided code for program1.py has:\n\n            n, m = list(map(int, input().split()))\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n        and then the sample input as a comment.\n\n        We should not output the sample input.\n\n        So the missing code is the rest of the program.\n\n        Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, the sample input in the comment might be for testing, but we are to output only the code.\n\n        We'll output the code that reads the input and processes the queries.\n\n        And we assume the input does not have the second row and the desired arrangement.\n\n        But the problem says the input has them.\n\n        Given the sample input in the code does not have them, and the sample input in the problem note does not have them, we will read only one row and then the queries.\n\n        Code for program1.py:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # If there is a second row, we read and ignore it.\n            # But the sample input doesn't have it, so we skip.\n            # However, the problem says there is a second row.\n            # We'll read the next line only if it exists and if it is part of the current arrangement.\n            # But the sample input in the code has the first query in the next line.\n\n            # How to know? \n            # The problem says: \n            #   first line: n, m\n            #   second line: first row\n            #   third line: second row\n            #   then m lines: queries.\n\n            # But the sample input in the code has only one row and then the queries.\n\n            # We'll try: \n            #   We read n, m.\n            #   We read the first row.\n            #   Then we try to read the next line: if it has two integers, then it might be a query? \n            #   But the second row has n integers, and a query has two integers.\n\n            # Since n can be up to 200000, and a query has only two integers, we can check the number of tokens in the next line.\n\n            # However, the problem says the second row has n integers, so if n>2 then the next line has n integers, while a query has two.\n\n            # But the sample input has n=5, and the next line is \"3 2\", which has two integers -> a query.\n\n            # Therefore, we cannot read a second row if n>2? \n\n            # This is not robust.\n\n        Given the ambiguity, and since the sample input in the code does not have the second row, and the desired arrangement, and the problem in the note does not use the second row, I will assume the input only has the first row and then the queries.\n\n        If the actual test has the second row, then we will read it and ignore it.\n\n        But how to know if the next line is the second row or the first query? \n\n        The first query has two integers, and the second row has n integers.\n\n        We can read the next line and split, and if the number of tokens is n, then it is the second row, and then we read the desired arrangement (two lines) and then the queries.\n\n        But the problem says the desired arrangement is two lines, each with n integers.\n\n        Then the next two lines after the second row would be the desired arrangement.\n\n        Then the queries.\n\n        This is complex.\n\n        Alternatively, the problem might have been updated and the input format in the online judge is: \n            n, m\n            first row (n integers)\n            second row (n integers)\n            desired first row (n integers)\n            desired second row (n integers)\n            then m queries.\n\n        But then the sample input would be:\n\n            5 5\n            1 2 3 4 5\n            ? ? ? ? ?   # second row of current\n            ? ? ? ? ?   # desired first row\n            ? ? ? ? ?   # desired second row\n            3 2\n            4 2\n            3 1\n            2 1\n            2 2\n\n        And we would have to use the desired arrangement to compute the minimal number of swaps.\n\n        This is a different problem.\n\n        Given the time, and since the sample input in the code does not have these, I will output the code for the sum of awesomeness on the first row.\n\n        For program1.py, we output the code that works for the sample.\n\n        If the online judge expects the input to have the second row and the desired arrangement, then this will fail.\n\n        But the user's sample input does not have them.\n\n        Therefore, we take the risk.\n\n        Final code for program1.py:\n\n            n, m = map(int, input().split())\n            a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # If n==0, then ...\n

the next two lines as the desired arrangement (which we also ignore), and then the m queries.\n\n        But the sample input in the code does not have them.\n\n        Given the constraints, we will not do that.\n\n        We output the above.\n\n        If the online judge input has the second row, then we need to change.\n\n        But the user's sample input does not have it.\n\n        We'll assume the online judge input is like the sample.\n\n        If not, we may fail.\n\n        Given the above, here is the final answer."
