Therefore, for program2, we output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nas two lines. So the string is: \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases for program1 is at most 10^5, and the triple loop is 11*11*11 per test case, which is acceptable. So the final answer:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n} But wait, the program1 part: the existing line in the second condition is: \"                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\". How many spaces? 20? But if we assume 4 per level:\n\n    for j in range(11):   # 0\n        for k in range(11):   # 4\n            for l in range(11):   # 8\n                if j != l:   # 12\n                    ...   # 16\n                if k != l:   # 12\n                    answer += ...   # 16 So the body of the if conditions should be 16 spaces. Therefore, for program1, we output: \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\" (which is 4 spaces) is not enough. We need 16 spaces? Actually, the problem's code for the second condition is: \"                    answer += ...\", which is 20 spaces? That doesn't match.",

So total for 'b' = 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6. For other second letters: 0. Total = 2 (from 'a') + 2 (from 'c') + 6 (from 'b') = 10. Then we divide by 2: 5. So it works. Example for program2: Example: n=6, m=11 -> output 60. Factor n=6: 2^1 * 5^0 * 3.\n    a=1, b=0, c=3. Since a>0 and b=0, we are in a>b. Then we do: while a> b and 5*t<=m: t=1 -> 5<=11 -> t=5, b=1. Then while 10*t<=m: 50<=11? no. So t=5. Then k = m - (m%t) = 11 - (11%5)=11-1=10. Then new price = 6*10 = 60. Correct. Example: n=5, m=43 -> output 200. Factor n=5: 2^0 * 5^1 * 1.\n    a=0, b=1 -> b>a.\n    Then we do: while b>a and 2*t<=m: t=1 -> 2<=43 -> t=2, a=1. Then we have a==b, so then we do: while 10*t<=m: 20<=43 -> t=20; then 10*20=200<=43? no, so t=20. Then k = 43 - (43%20) = 43 - 3 = 40. Then new price = 5*40=200. Correct. Example: n=13, m=5 -> output 65. Factor 13: a=0, b=0. Then we skip the if and elif. Then while 10*t<=m: 10<=5? no. So t=1. Then k = 5 - (5%1)=5-0=5. Then new price = 13*5=65. Correct. Example: n=100, m=10 -> output 1000. Factor 100: 2^2 * 5^2 -> a=2, b=2. Then we skip the if and elif. Then while 10*t<=m: t=1 -> 10<=10 -> t=10; then 10*10=100<=10? no -> so t=10. Then k = 10 - (10%10)=10-0=10. Then new price = 100*10=1000. But the problem says: \"the roundest possible new price\" and 1000 has 3 zeros, which is more than 100 (which has 2). And it is within m=10. However, the maximum multiple of 10 that is <=10 is 10. So k=10 -> 1000. But note: the problem says: \"Output the roundest possible new price of the good.",

So we output two lines, each with the same indentation as the body in the first case. But the first case has:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1 So we output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1 But the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the two lines with the same indentation as the existing body in the first case. Therefore, we output:\n\n    \"program2\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in the first case uses 8 spaces? Actually, the problem's code for the first case is:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nSo the body is indented by 4 more spaces than the while condition?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are counting pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position.\nThe current code uses a 2D array `data` of size 11x11 (since letters from 'a' to 'k' are 11 letters) to count the frequency of each string.\n\nThe current code then does:\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nBut note: the current code in the `if k != l` part is adding pairs that have the same first letter and different second letters? Actually, that part is inside the inner loops and runs for every j, k, l. However, the TODO part is missing.\n\nWe note that a pair (s1, s2) can differ in exactly one position in two ways:\n  1. The first character is the same and the second character differs.\n  2. The second character is the same and the first character differs.\n\nThe current code after the TODO has:\n    if k != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nThis is counting pairs that have the same first letter (j) and different second letters (k and l). But note: this counts every pair twice? Because for two distinct second letters k and l, we count the pair (k, l) and then later when l and k are swapped we count (l, k) again? Actually, the inner loop runs l from 0 to 10 for every fixed j and k. So for a fixed j, and two distinct second letters k and l, we will add data[j][k]*data[j][l] for the pair (k, l) and then when k becomes l and l becomes k, we will add again? Actually, no: for a fixed j, and for a fixed k, we run l from 0 to 10. When l != k, we add data[j][k]*data[j][l]. Then for the same j and l (with l now being the same as the previous k) and k being the same as the previous l, we will add again? So we are double counting.\n\nBut note: the problem requires pairs (i, j) with i<j. The above counts every unordered pair twice? Actually, the pair (string1, string2) is counted once when k is the second of string1 and l is the second of string2, and then again when k is the second of string2 and l is the second of string1? Actually, no: because the inner loop for a fixed j (first letter) and for a fixed k (second letter) and then l (another second letter) we are adding for every l != k: data[j][k] * data[j][l]. This counts every pair of two different second letters in the same first letter group. However, note that for two distinct second letters k and l, the pair (k, l) is counted once for k and then for l? Actually, no: for a fixed j, and for a fixed k, we add for every l != k: data[j][k] * data[j][l]. Then when we come to l (with the same j) and then k, we will again add data[j][l] * data[j][k]? So we are counting each unordered pair twice.\n\nSimilarly, the TODO part is for the case when the first letter differs and the second letter is the same. We should do:\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the current code has the inner loops over j, k, l. So for a fixed k (second letter) and for j and l (first letters) that are different, we add data[j][k] * data[l][k]. This counts pairs that have the same second letter and different first letters. And again, we are double counting: for two distinct first letters j and l, we add for j and then for l? Actually, for a fixed k, and for j and then for l, we run l from 0 to 10. When j is fixed and l runs, we add for every l != j: data[j][k] * data[l][k]. Then when we come to l (as the outer j) and then j (as the inner l) we add again? So again double counting.\n\nTherefore, the entire answer is double the actual number of pairs? Then the code at the end does `print(answer//2)`. So that takes care of the double counting.\n\nBut wait: the current code has two separate additions: one for the same first letter (with different second) and one for the same second letter (with different first). However, the TODO part is missing. We must complete the TODO part.\n\nSo the TODO part should be for the case: same second letter, different first letter. We have the same second letter k, and then two different first letters j and l. So we should add: data[j][k] * data[l][k] for every l != j? But note: the inner loops are j, k, l. For a fixed j and k, we are iterating l from 0 to 10. We want to add for every l (first letter) that is not j? So:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the variable l in the inner loop is the same as the one we are using for the first letter? Actually, the loops are:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n\nSo j and l are both indices for the first letter? Actually, no: the data is indexed by [first][second]. So j is the first letter index, k is the second letter index. Then in the inner loop, l is being used for two different purposes? In the TODO part we are using l as a first letter index? But then we have:\n\n    if j != l:\n        ...   # here we are comparing j and l, which are both first letter indices? \n\nBut then we have:\n\n    if k != l:\n        ...   # here we are comparing k (second letter) and l (which is an index from 0 to 10, but intended for what?)\n\nWait, the problem: the inner loop variable l is being used in two different conditions. This is confusing.\n\nActually, the intended logic is:\n\nWe have two cases:\nCase 1: The two strings have the same first letter (so same j) but different second letters (k and l). We count that in the second condition: if k != l, then we add data[j][k] * data[j][l]. But note: the inner loop runs l from 0 to 10 for the second letter? Actually, no: the inner loop variable l is the same for both conditions. That is the issue.\n\nThe current code uses the same inner loop variable l for both the first condition (which is for the same second letter and different first) and the second condition (same first letter and different second). But the second condition uses l as a second letter index? And the first condition uses l as a first letter index? That is inconsistent.\n\nWe must restructure? Actually, the problem says the total n over test cases is at most 10^5, but the triple nested loop is 11*11*11 = 1331 per test case, which is acceptable because the total test cases t is at most 100, but the sum of n is at most 10^5, but the number of test cases t is at most 100. However, 100 * 1331 = 133100, which is acceptable.\n\nBut the variable l is being used for two different meanings in the same inner loop. That is the problem.\n\nWe need to change the variable names? Actually, the TODO part is for the same second letter and different first. So we should use:\n\n    for first1 in range(11):\n        for second in range(11):\n            for first2 in range(11):\n                if first1 != first2:\n                    answer += data[first1][second] * data[first2][second]\n\nBut the current code uses j for the first letter and k for the second. Then the inner loop variable l is being used for both the first letter in the first condition and the second letter in the second condition? That is not right.\n\nLooking at the current code:\n\n    for j in range(11):   # j: first letter index\n        for k in range(11):   # k: second letter index\n            for l in range(11):   # l: what? \n                if j != l:\n                    # Here we want to consider two strings: one with first letter j and second letter k, and another with first letter l and second letter k? \n                    # So we add: data[j][k] * data[l][k]   [for the same second letter k and different first letters j and l]\n                if k != l:\n                    # Here we want to consider two strings: same first letter j, but different second letters: k and l.\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nSo the TODO part should be:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the inner loop variable l is being used as a first letter index in the first condition and as a second letter index in the second condition? That is inconsistent.\n\nActually, the variable l in the inner loop is an integer from 0 to 10. We are using it for two different purposes. That is the bug.\n\nWe must separate the two conditions: we cannot use the same inner loop variable for both.\n\nAlternatively, we can restructure the loops? But the problem says we can only fill in the missing lines.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the two conditions are independent and we can do:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            # For the same first letter j: we want to count pairs of second letters (k and l) with k != l.\n            # We can do: for l in range(11) for the second letter.\n            # But the current inner loop is over l from 0 to 10, and then we check if k != l (meaning second letter l) and then add data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n            # Similarly, for the same second letter k: we want to count pairs of first letters (j and l) with j != l.\n            # We can do: for l in range(11) for the first letter? But the inner loop variable l is already used.\n\nSo the problem is that the inner loop variable l is being used for two different meanings. We must change the variable for one of them? But we are only allowed to fill in the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                # Condition 1: same first letter j, different second letters: k and l (where l is a second letter index)\n                # Condition 2: same second letter k, different first letters: j and l (where l is a first letter index)\n\nBut that is not possible because l cannot be both at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the current structure is flawed.\n\nWe must change the approach? But note: the problem says we can only fill in the missing lines. We cannot change the entire structure.\n\nLooking at the current code, the TODO part is inside the triple loop and the condition `if j != l` and then there is an `if k != l` that is already written. The problem is that the inner loop variable `l` is being used for two different purposes. How can we fix?\n\nActually, the intended meaning of the inner loop variable `l` in the second condition (the one that is already written) is as a second letter index? Because we are comparing `k` and `l` (which are both in the range of second letters). And in the first condition, we are comparing `j` and `l` (which are both in the range of first letters). So the variable `l` is being used as a first letter index in the first condition and as a second letter index in the second condition? That is not valid.\n\nWe need two separate inner loops? But we are only allowed to fill in the TODO.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the two conditions are independent and we can break the inner loop into two separate triple loops? But the problem says we can only fill in the TODO.\n\nBut wait: the problem says \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". The TODO is only one line? Actually, the TODO is a block that we must fill in. The existing code has:\n\n    if j != l:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\n    if k != l:\n        answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nWe are allowed to write multiple lines? We can write:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the variable `l` in the first condition is intended to be a first letter index? And in the second condition, the variable `l` is intended to be a second letter index? But the same variable `l` is used for both. That is the issue.\n\nHowever, the problem says the letters are from 'a' to 'k' (11 letters) so the indices are from 0 to 10. The variable `l` runs from 0 to 10. In the first condition, we are using `l` as a first letter index, and in the second condition we are using `l` as a second letter index. That is acceptable? Actually, no: because the meaning of the index in the array `data` is [first][second]. So in the first condition, we are accessing `data[l][k]` which would be the count for the string with first letter index `l` and second letter index `k`. That is correct for the first condition (same second letter, different first). In the second condition, we are accessing `data[j][l]` which is the count for the string with first letter index `j` and second letter index `l`. That is correct for the second condition (same first letter, different second).\n\nBut the problem is: the inner loop variable `l` is being used for two different purposes in the same iteration? That is, for a fixed j, k, and l, we are doing:\n\n    if j != l:   # here l is a first letter index? \n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]   # so we are counting pairs: (j,k) and (l,k) for the same second letter k and different first letters j and l.\n\n    if k != l:   # here l is a second letter index?\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]   # so we are counting pairs: (j,k) and (j,l) for the same first letter j and different second letters k and l.\n\nBut note: the variable `l` in the two conditions has the same numeric value, but we are interpreting it differently. This is incorrect because we are mixing the two meanings in the same iteration.\n\nFor example, when l=0, we are using it as a first letter index in the first condition and as a second letter index in the second condition. This is not what we want.\n\nWe want to iterate over all possible first letter indices for the first condition and over all possible second letter indices for the second condition. But the same inner loop variable `l` cannot serve both purposes.\n\nTherefore, the current structure is incorrect.\n\nWe must restructure the loops? But we are only allowed to fill in the TODO. We cannot change the existing loops.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the two conditions are independent and we can do:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            # For the same first letter j: we want to count pairs of second letters (k and l) for l in range(11) and l != k.\n            # We can do: \n            #   for l in range(11):\n            #       if k != l:\n            #           answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n            # But that is already done.\n\n            # For the same second letter k: we want to count pairs of first letters (j and l) for l in range(11) and l != j.\n            # We can do:\n            #   for l in range(11):\n            #       if j != l:\n            #           answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut the problem is that the existing code already has the inner loop and the two conditions. And the TODO is only the first condition.\n\nSo we can write in the TODO part:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut then the inner loop runs l from 0 to 10, and for each l we do:\n\n    if j != l:   # l is the first letter index? -> then we add pairs for the same second letter k and different first letters j and l.\n    if k != l:   # l is the second letter index? -> then we add pairs for the same first letter j and different second letters k and l.\n\nBut the same l is used for both. This is not correct.\n\nHowever, note that the two conditions are mutually exclusive in interpretation? Actually, no: the value of l is the same in both conditions.\n\nBut we can argue: the two conditions are independent and we are using the same l for two different purposes. The array `data` is 11x11, so we are not going out of bounds. And the two conditions are:\n\n    Condition1: j != l   (here l is a first letter index for the other string)\n    Condition2: k != l   (here l is a second letter index for the other string)\n\nBut the same l is used for both. This is not logically correct.\n\nFor example, consider j=0, k=0, and l=1:\n    Condition1: j != l -> 0 != 1 -> true: so we add data[0][0] * data[1][0]   [which is the count for (0,0) and (1,0): same second letter 0, different first letters 0 and 1 -> correct]\n    Condition2: k != l -> 0 != 1 -> true: so we add data[0][0] * data[0][1]   [which is the count for (0,0) and (0,1): same first letter 0, different second letters 0 and 1 -> correct]\n\nBut then consider j=0, k=0, and l=0:\n    Condition1: j != l -> 0 != 0 -> false -> skip.\n    Condition2: k != l -> 0 != 0 -> false -> skip.\n\nNow consider j=0, k=1, and l=0:\n    Condition1: j != l -> 0 != 0 -> false -> skip.\n    Condition2: k != l -> 1 != 0 -> true: add data[0][1] * data[0][0] -> which is the same as data[0][0]*data[0][1] -> correct.\n\nBut now consider j=0, k=0, and l=2:\n    Condition1: 0 != 2 -> true: add data[0][0] * data[2][0]   -> correct for same second letter 0, different first letters 0 and 2.\n    Condition2: 0 != 2 -> true: add data[0][0] * data[0][2]   -> correct for same first letter 0, different second letters 0 and 2.\n\nSo it seems to be counting both conditions correctly? But note: the inner loop variable l is running from 0 to 10, and for each l we are doing two independent things: one for the first condition (using l as a first letter index) and one for the second condition (using l as a second letter index). And the array indices are correct.\n\nTherefore, we can fill the TODO part with:\n\n    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the condition `if j != l` is already there, so we only add when j != l.\n\nSo the entire block becomes:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n    if k != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\nAnd then we divide by 2 at the end? Why divide by 2? Because each pair is counted twice? Actually, no: in the first condition, we are counting each pair (i, j) once? Let me see:\n\nConsider two strings: \n   string1: (a, b) -> indices (a_index, b_index)\n   string2: (c, d) -> indices (c_index, d_index)\n\nWe want to count only when they differ in exactly one position.\n\nCase 1: same first letter, different second: a_index = c_index = j, and b_index != d_index. Then the pair will be counted in the second condition: \n   when j = a_index, k = b_index, and l = d_index (with k != l) -> then we add 1 for the pair (string1, string2) and also when k = d_index and l = b_index? But note: the inner loop for l runs for every fixed j and k. So for the same j, and for k = b_index, we run l and when l = d_index (and k != l) we add data[j][b_index] * data[j][d_index]. Then for the same j and k = d_index, and l = b_index (and k != l) we add data[j][d_index] * data[j][b_index]. So we are adding twice for the same unordered pair? \n\nSimilarly, for the first condition: same second letter, different first. The pair ( (a,b) and (c,b) ) will be counted when j = a, k = b, l = c (if a != c) and then again when j = c, k = b, l = a? So again twice.\n\nTherefore, the entire answer is double the actual count. Hence, we do `print(answer//2)`.\n\nSo the TODO part is:\n\n    if j != l:\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the existing code already has the second condition. So we just need to add the first condition.\n\nTherefore, for program1.py, the missing code in the TODO block is:\n\n    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nBut note: the condition `if j != l` is already there, so we only add when j != l.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nWe are given a test case: n and m. We are to find an integer k in [1, m] such that n*k has the maximum number of trailing zeros. If there are multiple, choose the maximum n*k. If we cannot get more trailing zeros than 0, then output n*m.\n\nThe current code factors n as: n = 2^a * 5^b * c, where c is coprime with 10.\n\nThen it sets t=1.\n\nThen it does:\n\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nThen:\n\n    while 10 * t <= m:\n        t *= 10\n\n    output.append(n * (m - (m % t)))\n\nThe idea is to balance the exponents of 2 and 5 to get as many 10 factors as possible. Then we can multiply by 10 as long as we don't exceed m.\n\nIn the case a > b: we can multiply by 5 to convert one 5 into a 10? Actually, we are increasing the exponent of 5 to match the exponent of 2? Because we have more 2s, so we need more 5s to form 10s. We multiply t by 5 as long as we don't exceed m and until the exponents are balanced.\n\nSimilarly, in the case b > a: we need to multiply by 2 to balance the 5s. So the TODO part should be:\n\n    t *= 2\n    a += 1\n\nBut note: the condition is `while b > a and 2 * t <= m` and we are inside the `elif b > a` block.\n\nSo:\n\n    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nBut note: we are increasing a by one each time, so we are reducing the imbalance.\n\nAfter balancing, we then multiply by 10 as long as we can (without exceeding m). Then we set the multiplier to the maximum multiple of t that is <= m? Actually, the code does: `n * (m - (m % t))` which is the largest multiple of t that is <= m.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to multiply by any integer k in [1, m]. The value t is the current factor we have built. Then we want to use the largest multiple of t that is <= m? But note: we might have built t as a factor that we must include, and then we can multiply by any integer up to m/t? Actually, the multiplier we use is k = (m - (m % t))? That is the largest multiple of t that is <= m.\n\nBut is that the maximum possible? For example, if we have t=10, and m=15, then k=10 -> n*10. But we could also use k=20? But k must be <= m, so 20>15 -> not allowed. So k=10 is the maximum multiple of 10 <=15.\n\nBut note: we are building t as the base factor that we must use? Actually, the idea is:\n\n   We want to maximize the trailing zeros. We first balance the 2s and 5s (so that we have min(a,b) as large as possible) and then we multiply by 10 as long as we can (which is 10, 100, ...). Then we take the largest multiple of t (which is the factor we built) that is <= m.\n\nBut note: the balancing step: we are only allowed to multiply by 2 or 5? Actually, we are building t as a product of 2s and 5s (and then 10s). Then we multiply n by t? But note: we are allowed to multiply by any integer k. However, the trailing zeros come from factors of 10. So we can break k into two parts: one part that provides the factors of 2 and 5 to balance n, and then the rest can be used to add more 10s (i.e., factors of 10). But note: we can also include other factors? However, including other factors does not add trailing zeros. So we want k to be of the form: (2^x * 5^y * 10^z) and then we can also multiply by a number that doesn't add zeros? But the problem says we want the maximum number of trailing zeros and then the maximum total value.\n\nThe current approach:\n\n   Step 1: Factor n to get a (exponent of 2) and b (exponent of 5) and c (the rest).\n   Step 2: Let t = 1.\n   Step 3: If a > b, then we multiply t by 5 until either a==b or we cannot multiply by 5 without exceeding m.\n   Step 4: If b > a, then we multiply t by 2 until either a==b or we cannot multiply by 2 without exceeding m.\n   Step 5: Then we multiply t by 10 as long as 10*t <= m.\n   Step 6: Then we set k = the largest multiple of t that is <= m, i.e., k = m - (m % t)   [if t>0, and if t==0? but t starts at 1].\n\nBut note: after step 5, t might be 1? Then k = m - (m%1) = m. Then we output n*m. That matches the requirement: if we cannot get a more rounded price, output n*m.\n\nBut what if we can get some trailing zeros? Then t will be greater than 1.\n\nThe TODO part is in the case b>a: we need to multiply t by 2 and increase a by 1 until we balance or exceed m.\n\nSo the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nBut note: the while loop condition is `while b > a and 2 * t <= m:`. So we are checking that we can multiply by 2 without exceeding m? Actually, we check 2*t <= m? Then we do t *= 2 and then a += 1.\n\nSo the code for the TODO part in program2.py is:\n\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nBut note: we must be careful with the indentation. The existing code has:\n\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo we need to write two lines? Actually, we can write:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut the problem says: output only the missing code. So we output the two lines with the same indentation.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\nand for program2.py is:\n\n        t *= 2\n        a += 1\n\nBut note: the output format is JSON with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". And the value for each is a string of the code.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\nSo we output:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 part is one line? And the program2 part is two lines? We must represent the two lines for program2 as a single string with a newline.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are outputting a JSON string.\n\nWe must escape the newline? Actually, in JSON, we can use \\n.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the two lines as a single string with a newline character.\n\nBut the example output format is: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\nSo for program1, the completion is the string: \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nFor program2, the completion is the string: \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in program2 has the while loop condition and then the TODO. We are replacing the TODO with two lines. So the two lines must be at the same indentation level as the while loop body.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 code has 4 spaces at the beginning? Because it is inside the triple loop and the if condition. The existing code has:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with: \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\". The existing code has 8 spaces for the inner loop and then 12 for the if condition? Actually, the code is:\n\n    for j in range(11):\n        for k in range(11):\n            for l in range(11):\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nSo the TODO is at an indentation level of 16 (or 4 per level: 4*4=16). The line we are adding should be at the same level. The existing line in the second condition is: \"                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\". So we should have the same indentation for the first condition.\n\nTherefore, the missing line for program1 should be indented by 16 spaces? But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level. The triple loop is 3 levels (12 spaces) and then the if condition adds one more (16). Then the TODO is at 16 spaces. Then the next condition is at 12 spaces? Actually, the second condition is at the same level as the first condition? So:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    ...   # 16 spaces\n                if k != l:\n                    ...   # 16 spaces\n\nBut the existing code for the second condition is written as: \"                    answer += ...\", which is 20 spaces? Actually, the code as given in the problem for the second condition is:\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nThat is: the line \"answer += ...\" is indented by 20 spaces? (because the if condition is 16 and then the body is 20). But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". We are to output the code that replaces the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the body of the if condition? So we should output the line with the same indentation as the existing line in the second condition? But the problem does not show the exact indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the code with the same relative indentation. The existing code for the second condition has 4 more spaces than the if condition. So for the first condition, we should also have 4 more spaces.\n\nBut the problem says: the code is given as:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nSo the TODO is at the same level as the comment. We are to replace the TODO comment with code that is at the same indentation level as the existing answer line in the second condition? That is, 4 more spaces than the if condition.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n    \"program1\": \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nBut note: the existing line in the second condition is: \"                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\". How many spaces? The problem does not specify. But we are only required to output the code that goes in the TODO block. The TODO block is at the same level as the second condition's body. So we output the same string as the second condition's body but with a different expression.\n\nAlternatively, we can output without worrying about the exact number of spaces? The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the expression: \"answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\" and it should be at the same indentation as the existing line in the second condition. But the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. So we output the expression with the same relative indentation as the existing line? Actually, the problem does not require the exact number of spaces? The program will run correctly as long as the indentation is consistent.\n\nBut to be safe, we output the same as the existing line in the second condition? The existing line in the second condition is: \"                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\". But we don't know the exact string. However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the code that replaces the TODO.\n\nWe can assume that the indentation is 4 spaces per level. The triple loop is 3 levels: 12 spaces. Then the for loop body (the two if conditions) are at 12 spaces. Then the body of the if conditions are at 16 spaces.\n\nSo the missing line should be at 16 spaces? But the problem shows the existing line in the second condition as: \"                    answer += ...\", which is 20 spaces? Actually, the problem's code is:\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nThat is: the if condition is at 12 spaces? and the body is at 16 spaces? Then the existing line is 16 spaces. So we output the same for the first condition.\n\nTherefore, we output the string: \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the existing code has:\n\n    while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n        # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the TODO with two lines, each indented by 8 spaces (if the while loop body is 8 spaces). But the problem shows the while loop condition at 4 spaces and the body at 8? Actually, the code is:\n\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the while loop body in the first case is indented by 12 spaces? (because the if is 4, the while is 8, and the body is 12). But the problem does not specify. However, we are to output the code that goes in the TODO. The TODO is at the same level as the body of the while loop in the first case? So we output two lines, each with the same indentation as the body in the first case.\n\nBut the first case has:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nSo we output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut the problem says: output the missing code. So we output the two lines with the same indentation as the existing body in the first case.\n\nTherefore, we output:\n\n    \"program2\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the existing code in the first case uses 8 spaces? Actually, the problem's code for the first case is:\n\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nSo the body is indented by 4 more spaces than the while condition? The while condition is at 8 spaces (because it is inside the if block which is 4 spaces). Then the body is 12 spaces? But the problem does not show the exact spaces. We assume 4 spaces per level.\n\nSo the if block is 4, the while is 8, and the body is 12. So we output the two lines for program2 with 12 spaces? But the problem says: output only the missing code. We output the two lines without the leading spaces? Or with the minimal necessary? Actually, we output the code as it would appear in the program.\n\nBut the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the example code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\nTherefore, for program2, the two lines should be indented by 12 spaces? But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and we are to output the code that replaces the TODO.\n\nWe output the two lines with the same indentation as the body of the while loop in the first case. Since the first case has:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nWe output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nBut note: the problem says the code is:\n\n    if a > b:\n        while a > b and 5 * t <= m:\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n    elif b > a:\n        while b > a and 2 * t <= m:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\nSo the body of the while loop in the first case is two lines: \"            t *= 5\" and \"            b += 1\". How many spaces? 12? Actually, the problem does not specify. But we can count: the if block is 4, the while is 8, and the body is 12. So we output the two lines with 12 spaces? But the problem says: output the missing code. We are to output the two lines that replace the TODO, and they should be at the same indentation as the body of the while loop.\n\nTherefore, we output the string: \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\" if the body is 8 spaces? But wait, the problem's code for the first case is:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nThat is 12 spaces? Then we output:\n\n    \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the problem says: the code is given as above. In the given code, the body of the while loop in the first case is two lines: each starting with 12 spaces? Actually, the problem does not show the exact spaces. We must rely on the relative indentation.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the code without the leading spaces? But that would break the indentation.\n\nWe must assume the standard: 4 spaces per level. The structure:\n\nfor ...:   # level 0\n    if ...:   # level 1 (4 spaces)\n        while ...:   # level 2 (8 spaces)\n            ...   # level 3 (12 spaces)\n\nSo the body of the while loop should be 12 spaces.\n\nTherefore, for program2, we output:\n\n            t *= 2\n            a += 1\n\nas two lines. So the string is: \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases for program1 is at most 10^5, and the triple loop is 11*11*11 per test case, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the final answer:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"            t *= 2\\n            a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut wait, the program1 part: the existing line in the second condition is: \"                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\". How many spaces? 20? But if we assume 4 per level:\n\n    for j in range(11):   # 0\n        for k in range(11):   # 4\n            for l in range(11):   # 8\n                if j != l:   # 12\n                    ...   # 16\n                if k != l:   # 12\n                    answer += ...   # 16\n\nSo the body of the if conditions should be 16 spaces. Therefore, for program1, we output: \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\" (which is 4 spaces) is not enough. We need 16 spaces? Actually, the problem's code for the second condition is: \"                    answer += ...\", which is 20 spaces? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, we can output the code without specifying the exact number of spaces? But the problem requires the code to run correctly.\n\nWe must output the code with the same indentation as the existing body in the second condition. The second condition's body is: \"                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\". How many spaces? Count: the line in the problem is:\n\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nThat is 20 spaces? Then we output 20 spaces for the first condition's body.\n\nBut the problem does not specify. However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". The missing code is the expression and it should be at the same level as the existing line. So we output the same 20 spaces.\n\nBut we don't know the exact number. The problem's example code is given as:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\nThe second condition's body is indented by 20 spaces? Or is it 4 spaces relative to the if condition? We can assume that the if condition is at 12 spaces and the body at 16, but the problem shows the body of the second condition as having more spaces? This is ambiguous.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, we output the code with the minimal necessary indentation: one level more than the if condition. In Python, that is typically 4 spaces. So for program1, we output:\n\n    \"program1\": \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\nFor program2, we output:\n\n    \"program2\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n\nThis is 4 spaces for program1 (relative to the if condition) and 4 spaces for program2 (relative to the while condition).\n\nThis should be consistent with the existing code.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n    \"program2\": \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\"\n}\n\nBut note: in program2, the existing body in the first case is written as:\n\n            t *= 5\n            b += 1\n\nwhich is 8 spaces? (relative to the while condition: 4 spaces for the while and then 4 for the body). So we output for program2: two lines of 8 spaces each? But the string would be \"        t *= 2\\n        a += 1\" (8 spaces per line).\n\nSo we use that.\n\nLet me double-check with the provided examples.\n\nExample for program1: \n    t=1, n=5, and the strings: [\"ab\", \"cb\", \"cc\", \"aa\", \"db\"]\n    We expect 5 pairs.\n\n    We build data:\n        'a': [ 'b':1, 'a':1 ]\n        'c': [ 'b':1, 'c':1 ]\n        'd': [ 'b':1 ]\n\n    Then we run the triple loop.\n\n    We will count:\n        For same first letter:\n            group 'a': pairs: (ab, aa) -> 1*1 = 1\n            group 'c': pairs: (cb, cc) -> 1*1 = 1\n            group 'd': none.\n        For same second letter:\n            second letter 'b': pairs: (ab, cb), (ab, db), (cb, db) -> 3 pairs? \n            second letter 'a': none.\n            second letter 'c': none.\n            second letter 'd': none.\n\n        Total pairs = 1+1+3 = 5.\n\n    But how does the code count?\n        For same first letter: \n            For first letter 'a' (j=0): \n                k='b' (index=1): for l in second letters: \n                    when l='a' (index=0): k!=l -> add data[0][1]*data[0][0] = 1*1 = 1.\n                k='a' (index=0): for l in second letters: \n                    when l='b' (index=1): add data[0][0]*data[0][1] = 1*1 = 1.\n                So total for 'a' = 2.\n            Similarly for 'c': 2.\n            For 'd': 0.\n        For same second letter:\n            For second letter 'b' (k=1):\n                j='a' (0): for l in first letters: \n                    when l='c' (2): j!=l -> add data[0][1]*data[2][1] = 1*1 = 1.\n                    when l='d' (3): add data[0][1]*data[3][1] = 1*1 = 1.\n                j='c' (2): for l in first letters:\n                    when l='a' (0): add data[2][1]*data[0][1] = 1*1 = 1.\n                    when l='d' (3): add data[2][1]*data[3][1] = 1*1 = 1.\n                j='d' (3): for l in first letters:\n                    when l='a' (0): add data[3][1]*data[0][1] = 1*1 = 1.\n                    when l='c' (2): add data[3][1]*data[2][1] = 1*1 = 1.\n                So total for 'b' = 1+1+1+1+1+1 = 6.\n            For other second letters: 0.\n        Total = 2 (from 'a') + 2 (from 'c') + 6 (from 'b') = 10.\n        Then we divide by 2: 5.\n\n    So it works.\n\nExample for program2: \n    Example: n=6, m=11 -> output 60.\n    Factor n=6: 2^1 * 5^0 * 3.\n    a=1, b=0, c=3.\n    Since a>0 and b=0, we are in a>b.\n    Then we do: while a> b and 5*t<=m: t=1 -> 5<=11 -> t=5, b=1.\n    Then while 10*t<=m: 50<=11? no. So t=5.\n    Then k = m - (m%t) = 11 - (11%5)=11-1=10.\n    Then new price = 6*10 = 60. Correct.\n\n    Example: n=5, m=43 -> output 200.\n    Factor n=5: 2^0 * 5^1 * 1.\n    a=0, b=1 -> b>a.\n    Then we do: while b>a and 2*t<=m: t=1 -> 2<=43 -> t=2, a=1.\n    Then we have a==b, so then we do: while 10*t<=m: 20<=43 -> t=20; then 10*20=200<=43? no, so t=20.\n    Then k = 43 - (43%20) = 43 - 3 = 40.\n    Then new price = 5*40=200. Correct.\n\n    Example: n=13, m=5 -> output 65.\n    Factor 13: a=0, b=0.\n    Then we skip the if and elif.\n    Then while 10*t<=m: 10<=5? no. So t=1.\n    Then k = 5 - (5%1)=5-0=5.\n    Then new price = 13*5=65. Correct.\n\n    Example: n=100, m=10 -> output 1000.\n    Factor 100: 2^2 * 5^2 -> a=2, b=2.\n    Then we skip the if and elif.\n    Then while 10*t<=m: t=1 -> 10<=10 -> t=10; then 10*10=100<=10? no -> so t=10.\n    Then k = 10 - (10%10)=10-0=10.\n    Then new price = 100*10=1000.\n\n    But the problem says: \"the roundest possible new price\" and 1000 has 3 zeros, which is more than 100 (which has 2). And it is within m=10.\n\n    However, the maximum multiple of 10 that is <=10 is 10. So k=10 -> 1000.\n\n    But note: the problem says: \"Output the roundest possible new price of the good. That is, the one that has the maximum number of zeros at the end.\" and then \"If there are several possible variants, output the one in which the new price is maximal.\".\n\n    So 1000 is the best.\n\n    But what if we do k=1? then 100 -> 2 zeros. k=10 -> 1000 -> 3 zeros. So 1000 is better.\n\n    Therefore, the code is correct.\n\nSo we output the JSON as described."
