I see: the sample input might be:\n\n            4 3\n            1 2 3\n            3 4 2\n            1 3 3   # additional condition\n\n        Then for the array [0,3,0,2]:\n            a1|a3 = 0|0 = 0, but we need 3 -> fails. So then the array [0,3,0,2] is invalid. Therefore, the sample input in the problem is likely:\n\n            4 3\n            1 2 3\n            3 4 2\n            1 3 3\n\n        Then the base array:\n            base[1] = 3 & 3 = 3\n            base[2] = 3\n            base[3] = 2 & 3 = 2\n            base[4] = 2\n\n        adj[1] = [2,3]\n        adj[2] = [1]\n        adj[3] = [4,1]\n        adj[4] = [3]\n\n        Process i=1:\n            t = base[1] = 3\n            for j in [2,3]: \n                base[2]=3, base[3]=2 -> t = 3 & 3 & 2 = 2\n            a[1] = 3 XOR 2 = 1. i=2:\n            t = base[2]=3\n            for j in [1]: base[1] is now 1 -> t = 3 & 1 = 1\n            a[2] = 3 XOR 1 = 2.\n\n        i=3:\n            t = base[3]=2\n            for j in [4,1]: base[4]=2, base[1]=1 -> t = 2 & 2 & 1 = 0\n            a[3] = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n        i=4:\n            t = base[4]=2\n            for j in [3]: base[3]=2 -> t = 2 & 2 = 2\n            a[4] = 2 XOR 2 = 0. Then we have [1,2,2,0]. Check:\n            a1|a2 = 1|2 = 3 -> ok.\n            a3|a4 = 2|0 = 2 -> ok.\n            a1|a3 = 1|2 = 3 -> ok. But the lexicographically smallest array in the list is [0,3,2,2]? [0,3,2,2]: \n                a1|a2 = 0|3=3 -> ok.\n                a3|a4 = 2|2=2 -> ok.\n                a1|a3 = 0|2=2, but we need 3 -> fails. So [0,3,2,2] is not valid for the condition a1|a3=3. The valid arrays for the input with three conditions must satisfy a1|a3=3. [0,3,2,2]: a1|a3=0|2=2 -> not 3.",

Since x0 is a subset of x1, we have x0 | a[j] = x1. This can be satisfied by setting a[j] = x1 without the bits in x0? But note: base[j] = the AND of all conditions involving j. In particular, for the condition (i,j,x1), base[j] = x1. Then we process j: \n            t = base[j] = x1\n            for neighbors: i is a neighbor -> val[i] = x0 (already set) -> t = x1 & x0 = x0 (because x0 is a subset of x1)\n            then a[j] = x1 ^ x0 = the bits in x1 that are not in x0.

So there is no solution? but the problem guarantees at least one solution. Therefore, the input must be consistent: if there is a self-loop (i,i,x), then for any other condition (i,j,y), we must have that x is a subset of y? because a_i = x, then a_i | a_j = x | a_j = y, so x must be a subset of y. In this example, x=3 (binary 11) and y=1 (binary 01) -> 3 is not a subset of 1. So there is no solution. But the problem guarantees at least one array.",

We break on self-loop and set t=0, but then we only process the self-loop and skip others? However, the self-loop forces a[i] = base[i] (which is the AND of the self-loop x and other conditions). But if the self-loop condition is (i,i,x0) and then we have (i,j,x1), then base[i] = x0 & x1. And the self-loop condition requires a[i] = x0, so we must have x0 = base[i] = x0 & x1 -> which means x0 is a subset of x1. So in the example, base[i] = 3 & 1 = 1, but the self-loop requires a[i]=3, which is not 1. -> contradiction.",

We output the string exactly. Let me write:\n\n            program1: \n                \"t = 0\\n                break\"\n\n            But the original code has 8 spaces for the indentation of the if body? The current code at the TODO is:\n\n                if b == a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO line with:\n\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n\n            The indentation level: the if is inside a for-loop that is indented by 4, and the if is indented by 8, and the body of the if should be indented by 12. But the provided code in program1 has:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    t &= val[b] So the if body is currently a comment. We replace the comment with:\n\n                t = 0\n                break\n\n            and then we remove the next line (t &= val[b]) for the self-loop? \n\n            But note: we cannot remove the next line for non-self-loop. We restructure the code to:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        t = 0\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        t &= val[b] But the original code does not have an else. We can do without else by:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        t = 0\n                        break\n                    t &= val[b] This is valid. So the missing code for program1 is two lines: \"t = 0\"\n                \"break\"\n\n            But we must write them as two lines with the same indentation as the comment.",

The problem says: \n                The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=100) \u2014 the number of test cases. So we read t test cases. Therefore, it is correct. We output the JSON.",

We can do:\n\n                    a2 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting a1 multiple times -> so a2 must be a multiple of a1? Then after a2 becomes 0, then a3 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting a2 (which is 0) or a1? but we can also change a3 before a2? But note: we can do operations in any order. Example: [3, 3, 6] We can do:\n                    Operation on a3: subtract a2 (which is 3) -> [3,3,3]\n                    Then operation on a3: subtract a2 (which is 3) -> [3,3,0]\n                    Then operation on a2: subtract a1 (which is 3) ->",

We missed the last test case? Correction: The condition is: while pos <= len_input-1. When pos=8, then we break because 8>7 (since len_input-1 = 7). But we have read the last test case and set pos=8, which is beyond the last index (which is 7). How many integers? \n                indices: 0: t=2\n                        1: n1=2\n                        2: a1\n                        3: a2\n                        4: n2=3\n                        5: b1\n                        6: b2\n                        7: b3\n\n            We read the first test case: \n                n_i = input_arr[1] = 2 -> then we take [2:4] -> indices 2 and 3 -> then pos becomes 1+1+2 = 4. Then we are at index4, which is within [0..7] (since 4<=7) -> so we do the next.\n                n_i = input_arr[4] = 3 -> then we take [5:8] -> indices 5,6,7 -> then pos = 4+1+3 = 8. Then 8>7 -> break. So we read both test cases. Therefore, the code is: while pos <= len_input-1:\n                    n_i = input_arr[pos]\n                    arr = input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+n_i]\n                    test_cases.append(arr)\n                    pos = pos + 1 + n_i\n\n        But note: the array slicing in Python: \n            arr = input_arr[pos+1: pos+1+n_i]   -> this gives n_i elements: from index pos+1 to pos+n_i (exclusive of pos+1+n_i) This is correct.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the lexicographically smallest array a of length n that satisfies q conditions of the form: a_i | a_j = x.\n\nThe approach in the provided code is:\n1. We initialize an array `val` of length n+1 (1-indexed) with -1 (which we treat as having all bits set, but we'll adjust later).\n2. We also create an adjacency list `adj` to record the connections between indices.\n\nFor each condition (i, j, x):\n   - We update val[i] = val[i] & x, and similarly for val[j]. This is because the condition a_i | a_j = x implies that both a_i and a_j must have only the bits that are in x. So we are effectively taking the intersection of the current possible bits for a_i with x (and same for a_j). Initially, if val[i] is -1 (which is 0b111...111 in two's complement, but we are using nonnegative numbers) we can set it to x. However, note that -1 in the context of bitwise operations with nonnegative numbers: we are using integers that are nonnegative and less than 2^30. So we can use -1 as a starting value meaning \"all ones\", but then we do `val[i] &= x` which sets it to x for the first condition.\n\nBut note: the condition a_i | a_j = x does not force a_i to have all the bits of x. It only forces that the bits that are not in x cannot appear. So the initial step of doing `val[i] &= x` is correct to restrict the bits.\n\nHowever, the provided code then does:\n   for a in range(1, n+1):\n        if val[a] == -1:   # meaning no condition constrains this element? then set to 0.\n            val[a] = 0\n            continue\n        t = val[a]\n        for b in adj[a]:\n            if b == a:   # self-loop? but note: condition (i,i,x) would be a_i | a_i = x -> a_i = x. So we must handle that.\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            t &= val[b]\n        val[a] ^= t\n\nThe idea for the second part is to set each element to the smallest possible value. We start by noting that if an element has no condition (val[a] remains -1) then we set it to 0.\n\nOtherwise, we set:\n   t = val[a]   (which is the bitmask of all bits that are allowed for a[a] by all conditions that involve a[a] as one of the two indices)\n\nThen we look at all neighbors (adjacent indices that appear in a condition with a). For each neighbor b, we consider val[b]. The condition a_i | a_j = x must hold. We have already forced that a_i is a subset of x and a_j is a subset of x. Now, for the lexicographically smallest, we want to set a_i to as small as possible.\n\nThe trick: for a fixed bit, if the bit is set in x for the condition (i,j,x), then at least one of a_i or a_j must have that bit. But if we can avoid setting a bit in a_i (to keep it small) by relying on a_j having that bit, then we do so. However, if a_j does not have that bit (because we are going to set a_j to a small value too) then we must set the bit in a_i.\n\nThe algorithm in the code does:\n   t = val[a]   (which is the OR of all the conditions that a is involved in? Actually, no: we did an AND over the conditions. So val[a] is the set of bits that are allowed in a[a] and that must appear in every condition that a[a] is in? Actually, note: if we have two conditions: one with x1 and one with x2, then we did:\n        val[a] = (initially -1) then val[a] = (-1) & x1 & x2 ... = x1 & x2 ... \n   So val[a] is the set of bits that are allowed in every condition that a[a] is in.\n\nThen, for each neighbor b, we do t &= val[b]. Then we set val[a] = val[a] XOR t.\n\nWhat does that do?\n   Let me denote:\n        Let A = val[a] (the set of bits that are allowed in a[a] in every condition)\n        Then we compute t = A & (val[b1] & val[b2] & ...)   [for all neighbors b]\n\n   Then we set a[a] = A XOR t.\n\nBut note: the condition for an edge (a, b) is that a[a] | a[b] = x. We know that a[a] must be a subset of A and a[b] a subset of val[b]. The condition requires that the bits in x must be covered by a[a] or a[b]. The bits that are in t (which is the intersection of A and the val[b] for all neighbors) are bits that are allowed in a[a] and also allowed in every neighbor. \n\nThe idea is: if a bit is in t, then we can avoid setting it in a[a] because we can rely on the neighbor having it? But note: the neighbor might not set it? So we must set it in a[a] only if the neighbor does not have it? But we are setting the array in a fixed order.\n\nActually, the algorithm is known from known solutions for this problem. The common solution is:\n\n   Let ans[1..n] = 0.\n   For each bit from 0 to 29:\n        Let must[1..n] be an array of booleans, initially true meaning that for each index we must set the bit? But then we look at the conditions: for a condition (i, j, x): \n            if the bit is set in x, then at least one of i or j must have the bit.\n            But if the bit is not set in x, then neither i nor j has the bit.\n\n   However, we are going for lexicographically smallest. So we try to avoid setting a bit in an element if possible.\n\n   The provided code uses a different method:\n\n        We precompute for each index i, a mask `base[i]` which is the bitwise AND of all x for which i appears in a condition (with any other j). This is what `val[i]` is.\n\n        Then, for each index i, we set:\n            a[i] = base[i]   (but then we subtract the bits that are forced to be set by the neighbors)\n\n        Actually, the step: \n            t = base[i]\n            for each neighbor j (including self? note the condition if b==a: we have a self-loop? but note: condition (i,i,x) would force a_i = x, so we must set base[i] to x and then we have a self-loop. How do we handle self-loop? \n\n        The condition (i,i,x) forces a_i = x. So if we have a condition (i,i,x), then base[i] becomes x (because we did base[i] &= x, and then we do the same for the next condition). Then when we process i, we have a self-loop: we see neighbor i. Then we do:\n\n            if b == a:   # meaning we have a self-loop? then we must set t = base[i] (but then we do t &= base[i] again? that doesn't change) and then we do base[i] XOR t -> 0? \n\n        That doesn't seem right.\n\n        Actually, the known solution from a similar problem (Lexicographically Smallest Array After q OR Constraints) is:\n\n            Let a[i] = 0 for all i.\n            Let must[i] = the OR of all x for which i appears? Actually, no.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let a[i] = the bitwise AND of all x that appear in conditions (i, j) for any j? That is what we have in base[i] (val[i]).\n\n            Then, for each condition (i, j, x): we know that a[i] must have at least the bits that are in x and not in a[j]. But we are building the array.\n\n        The provided code does:\n\n            t = base[i]\n            for each neighbor j (including i? if there is a self-loop) we do t &= base[j]   [if j==i, then base[j] is base[i], so t becomes base[i] again?]\n\n            Then we set a[i] = base[i] XOR t   -> which is 0? \n\n        That cannot be.\n\n        Let me check a known solution from a similar problem (Codeforces): \n\n        Solution for \"D. Lexicographically Minimal String by OR Constraints\" (if that's the problem) is:\n\n            We maintain an array res of n zeros.\n            We also maintain an array base of size n, where base[i] is the bitwise AND of all x for edges incident to i.\n\n            Then for each index i, we set:\n                res[i] = base[i]\n                for each neighbor j: \n                    res[i] |= (base[i] & ~base[j])\n\n            But wait, that doesn't look like the code.\n\n        Alternatively, the known solution (from a known problem) is:\n\n            for i in range(n):\n                a[i] = base[i]\n                for j in adj[i]:\n                    a[i] &= base[j]   # ??? \n\n            Then that doesn't match.\n\n        Actually, the provided code does:\n\n            t = base[i]\n            for j in adj[i]:\n                if j == i:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                t &= base[j]\n            base[i] = base[i] ^ t   # then we set base[i] to that and output base[1..n]?\n\n        What does that do?\n\n        Example: condition (1,2,3): \n            base[1] = 3, base[2] = 3.\n            Then for i=1: \n                t = 3\n                for j in adj[1] (which is [2]): \n                    t = 3 & base[2] = 3 & 3 = 3.\n                then base[1] = 3 ^ 3 = 0.\n            Similarly, base[2] becomes 0.\n\n        Then we have a[1]=0, a[2]=0. Then 0|0=0, but we need 3 -> fails.\n\n        So that is not correct.\n\n        After rethinking: \n\n        The condition: a_i | a_j = x.\n\n        We have base[i] = (initial -1) then base[i] = base[i] & x for every condition that involves i. So base[i] is the set of bits that must be present in a_i? Actually, no: it's the set of bits that are allowed. But note: a_i must be a subset of base[i]. \n\n        The condition requires that the union of a_i and a_j is x. So the bits that are in x must be in at least one of a_i or a_j, and the bits not in x must be absent in both.\n\n        How to assign the bits to minimize a_i? We want to avoid setting a bit in a_i if we can set it in a_j. But we are building the entire array. We can do:\n\n            We consider each bit independently? But the problem is up to 200000 conditions and 100000 elements.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Let a[i] = 0 for all i.\n            For each condition (i, j, x): \n                We know that the bits that are in x must be set in at least one of a[i] or a[j]. But we want to set as few bits as possible in a[i] to keep it small.\n\n            We can set a[i] to be the bits that are in base[i] but not in base[j]? But note: base[j] is the set of bits that are allowed in a[j]. However, we are going to set a[j] similarly? \n\n        The known solution (from a known problem) is:\n\n            Let a[i] = base[i]   (the AND of all x for edges incident to i)\n\n            Then, for each condition (i, j, x): \n                if (a[i] | a[j]) != x:\n                    then we set a[i] = a[i] | (x & ~a[j])\n\n            But that might require multiple passes? and we want lexicographically smallest.\n\n        Another known solution (from a known problem) is:\n\n            We can do:\n\n                a = [0] * (n+1)\n                base = [ (1<<31) - 1 ] * (n+1)   # all ones\n                for each condition (i, j, x):\n                    base[i] &= x\n                    base[j] &= x\n\n                for i from 1 to n:\n                    for j in adj[i]:\n                        # condition: a[i] | a[j] must be at least base[i] and base[j]? \n                        # Actually, the condition is the OR must be x. But note: we have multiple conditions? \n                        # We can set: \n                        a[i] |= (base[i] & ~base[j])\n\n                But then we have to worry about self-loops? \n\n        However, the provided code does:\n\n            for a in range(1, n+1):\n                if val[a] == -1: \n                    val[a] = 0\n                    continue\n                t = val[a]\n                for b in adj[a]:\n                    if b == a:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    t &= val[b]\n                val[a] ^= t\n\n        How to fix? \n\n        After reading known solutions for the problem \"D. Lexicographically Minimal String by OR Constraints\" (if that's the problem), one solution is:\n\n            ans = [0] * (n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                if ans[i] != base[i]:   # but base[i] is the AND of all x for edges incident to i, and we start with 0.\n                    ans[i] = base[i]\n                    for j in adj[i]:\n                        ans[j] |= base[i] & ~base[j]   # but that is not the same.\n\n        Actually, I recall a solution that does:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                for j in adj[i]:\n                    # if there is an edge (i, j, x), then we require that the OR of a[i] and a[j] is x.\n                    # we have base[i] = the AND of all x for edges incident to i, and similarly base[j].\n                    # then we set a[i] = base[i] \n                    # but then we must set the bits that are in base[i] and not in base[j] to a[i]? \n                    # Actually, we set a[i] to base[i] without the bits that are forced to be set by the neighbors? \n\n        The provided code does:\n\n            t = base[i]\n            for each neighbor j: \n                t &= base[j]   # so t is the intersection of base[i] and all base[j] for neighbors j.\n\n            then a[i] = base[i] - t?   (because base[i] XOR t) -> that sets the bits that are in base[i] but not in t.\n\n        Why? \n\n        Explanation: \n            The bits that are in the intersection (t) are bits that are allowed in a[i] and also allowed in every neighbor j. \n            We can avoid setting these bits in a[i] because we can set them in one of the neighbors? But note: the condition requires that for each edge (i,j,x) the bit must be set in at least one of a[i] or a[j]. \n            However, if a bit is in t, then it is allowed in every neighbor. But we are building the array and we want lexicographical order. We want to set a[i] as small as possible. So we avoid setting the bit in a[i] if we can set it in a neighbor. But note: the neighbor might be set later? and we are processing in order from 1 to n? \n\n        However, the lexicographical order is defined by the array a[1], a[2], ... a[n]. We want the first element to be as small as possible. Then the second, etc.\n\n        The algorithm does:\n\n            For index i, we look at all neighbors. The bits that are common to base[i] and every base[j] (for j in adj[i]) are bits that we can potentially avoid setting in a[i] (because we can set them in a neighbor). But note: if we avoid setting a bit in a[i], then we must set it in every neighbor j? But that is not necessary: only one neighbor j for each edge (i,j) must have the bit. However, if we avoid setting the bit in a[i], then for an edge (i,j), the bit must be set in a[j]. But if j is processed after i, then we can set it in j. But if j is processed before i, then we have already set a[j] and if the bit was not set in a[j] then we are forced to set it in a[i]. \n\n        How to resolve? \n\n        The known solution (from a known problem) that uses the provided method is:\n\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                if val[i] == -1:\n                    val[i] = 0\n                else:\n                    t = val[i]\n                    for j in adj[i]:\n                        if i == j:\n                            # self-loop: condition (i,i,x) -> then we must set a[i] = x, so we cannot remove any bit? \n                            # then we set t = 0? because we must set all bits of base[i]? \n                            # but note: if we have a self-loop, then the condition is a_i | a_i = x -> a_i = x. So we must set a_i = base[i] (which is x). Then we don't want to remove any bit? \n                            # so we set t = 0? because then val[i] ^= 0 -> remains base[i].\n                        else:\n                            t &= val[j]   # but note: if j has been processed, then val[j] is the value we set for j? but we are processing in order from 1 to n. \n                    val[i] ^= t\n\n        Why would this work?\n\n        Consider: \n            We want to avoid setting a bit in a[i] if we can set it in a neighbor. But if a neighbor j has already been processed, then we know a[j]. However, the condition for edge (i,j) is that a[i] | a[j] = x. \n            The bits that are in t (the intersection of base[i] and the base[j] for all neighbors j) are bits that are allowed in a[i] and also allowed in every neighbor j. \n\n            But note: for a neighbor j that has been processed, we have already set a[j] = base[j] with some bits removed (by the same process). So the actual a[j] might not have the bit? \n\n        However, the algorithm does not use the actual a[j] but base[j] (which is the AND of all x for edges incident to j). \n\n        This seems to be a flaw.\n\n        But note: the base[j] is the set of bits that are allowed in a[j]. The actual a[j] is base[j] with some bits removed (by the same XOR t step). However, the condition for edge (i,j) must be satisfied: a[i] | a[j] must be x. \n\n        How can we be sure? \n\n        Let me test with the sample: \n            n=4, q=2: \n                condition1: (1,2,3) -> x=3 (binary 11)\n                condition2: (1,3,1) -> x=1 (binary 01)\n\n            Then:\n                base[1] = 3 & 1 = 1.\n                base[2] = 3.\n                base[3] = 1.\n\n            adj[1] = [2,3]\n            adj[2] = [1]\n            adj[3] = [1]\n\n            Process i=1:\n                t = base[1] = 1.\n                for j in [2,3]:\n                    t &= base[j] -> 1 & 3 & 1 = 1.\n                then a[1] = 1 XOR 1 = 0.\n\n            Then i=2:\n                t = base[2] = 3.\n                for j in [1] (which has been set to 0? but we use base[j]? base[1] is still 1? but note: we updated val[1] to 0, but in the base array we stored the AND of the conditions? and we did not change base? \n\n            Actually, the code uses the same array `val` for both the base and then the answer. After we set val[1]=0, then when processing i=2, we look at base[j] for j=1: but base[j] is now 0? because we set val[1]=0? \n\n            This is a problem: we are overwriting the base array.\n\n        How the code is structured:\n\n            We read and store the base in `val` (as the AND of the conditions) and then we update `val` to be the answer.\n\n            Then when processing i=2, we do:\n                t = val[2]   # which is 3\n                for j in adj[2]: which is [1] -> then we look at val[1] which is now 0 (because we set it to 0 in the processing of i=1) -> then t = 3 & 0 = 0.\n                then val[2] = 3 XOR 0 = 3.\n\n            Then i=3:\n                t = val[3] = 1\n                for j in adj[3]: [1] -> val[1]=0 -> t = 1 & 0 = 0\n                then val[3] = 1 XOR 0 = 1.\n\n            Then we have a[1]=0, a[2]=3, a[3]=1.\n\n            Check condition1: a[1]|a[2] = 0|3 = 3 -> ok.\n            condition2: a[1]|a[3] = 0|1 = 1 -> ok.\n\n            But is this lexicographically smallest? \n                The sample says: the lexicographically smallest is [0,3,2,2] for the first sample? but we have n=3? \n\n            Actually, the sample in the note is for n=4? \n\n            The sample note says: \n                [0,3,2,2], [2,1,0,0], ... \n\n            Our example is different.\n\n        Now, let's try the sample from the note: \n            The sample input: \n                4 2\n                1 2 3\n                3 4 2\n\n            The note says the lexicographically smallest is [0,3,2,2].\n\n            How does our algorithm do?\n\n            base[1] = 3\n            base[2] = 3\n            base[3] = 2\n            base[4] = 2\n\n            adj[1] = [2]\n            adj[2] = [1]\n            adj[3] = [4]\n            adj[4] = [3]\n\n            Process i=1:\n                t = base[1] = 3\n                for j in [2]: t = 3 & base[2] = 3 & 3 = 3\n                then a[1] = 3 XOR 3 = 0.\n\n            i=2:\n                t = base[2] = 3\n                for j in [1]: base[1] is now 0 -> t = 3 & 0 = 0\n                a[2] = 3 XOR 0 = 3.\n\n            i=3:\n                t = base[3] = 2\n                for j in [4]: t = 2 & base[4] = 2 & 2 = 2\n                a[3] = 2 XOR 2 = 0 -> but expected 2? \n\n            Then i=4:\n                t = base[4] = 2\n                for j in [3]: base[3] is now 0 -> t = 2 & 0 = 0\n                a[4] = 2.\n\n            Then we get [0,3,0,2] -> but condition: \n                condition1: 0|3 = 3 -> ok.\n                condition2: 0|2 = 2 -> ok.\n\n            But the lexicographically smallest array in the note is [0,3,2,2]. Our array [0,3,0,2] is lexicographically smaller than [0,3,2,2]? \n                Compare: \n                    index1: 0 vs 0 -> same.\n                    index2: 3 vs 3 -> same.\n                    index3: 0 vs 2 -> 0<2 -> so [0,3,0,2] is lexicographically smaller.\n\n            But the note says the lexicographically smallest is [0,3,2,2]. Why?\n\n            The note says: \"these are all the arrays satisfying the statements\" and lists 9 arrays. [0,3,0,2] is not in the list? \n\n            Why? \n\n            Condition: \n                (1,2,3): a1|a2=3 -> 0|3=3 -> ok.\n                (3,4,2): a3|a4=2 -> 0|2=2 -> ok.\n\n            So [0,3,0,2] is valid. And it is lexicographically smaller than [0,3,2,2]. \n\n            But the problem says: \"Find the lexicographically smallest array a that satisfies all the statements.\"\n\n            So why does the note say the lexicographically smallest is [0,3,2,2]? \n\n            Let me check the sample: \n                The sample input: \n                    4 2\n                    1 2 3\n                    3 4 2\n\n                The note says: \n                    [0, 3, 2, 2], \n                    [2, 1, 0, 0], \n                    [2, 1, 0, 2], \n                    [2, 1, 2, 0], \n                    [2, 1, 2, 2], \n                    [2, 3, 0, 0], \n                    [2, 3, 0, 2], \n                    [2, 3, 2, 0], \n                    [2, 3, 2, 2]\n\n                Why is [0,3,0,2] not in the list? \n\n            I see: the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that all q statements hold for at least one array.\" and the note says \"In the first sample\", so the sample input is:\n\n                \"The first sample\" in the problem statement: \n                    Input: \n                        4 2\n                        1 2 3\n                        3 4 2\n\n                But the note lists 9 arrays.

[0,3,0,2] is not in the list. \n\n            Why? \n\n            The sample input might be different? \n\n            The problem says: \"In the first sample\", and then the input is: \n                4 2\n                1 2 3\n                3 4 2\n\n            But the list of arrays in the note includes arrays that have a1=2, not 0. \n\n            And the array [0,3,0,2] has a1=0, which is not in the list? \n\n            This is a mystery.\n\n        After re\u2010reading the problem statement: \n            \"The Narrator has an integer array a of length n, but he will only tell you the size n and q statements, each of them being three integers i, j, x, which means that a_i | a_j = x\"\n\n            There is no constraint that i != j. \n\n            But in the sample input: \n                4 2\n                1 2 3\n                3 4 2\n\n            So i and j can be the same? not in this sample.\n\n        However, the sample output in the problem is \"0 3 2 2\", not \"0 3 0 2\". \n\n        Why would \"0 3 0 2\" not be valid? \n\n        Let me check the condition for index 3: \n            The conditions only involve (3,4) -> a3|a4=2.\n\n            But there is no condition that forces a3 to be nonzero? \n\n        It is valid.\n\n        I see the issue: the problem says \"the lexicographically smallest array\", and [0,3,0,2] is lexicographically smaller than [0,3,2,2]. \n\n        Therefore, the sample output should be \"0 3 0 2\". \n\n        But the known accepted solution for the problem (if it's from a contest) might output \"0 3 2 2\". \n\n        This suggests that the provided algorithm might not be correct.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"It is guaranteed that all q statements hold for at least one array.\" and the sample input has at least two valid arrays.\n\n        How to achieve lexicographically smallest? \n\n        We want to set a[1] as small as possible, then a[2], etc.\n\n        The algorithm we are using sets a[1] to 0 in the sample, which is the smallest possible. Then a[2] to 3, which is forced because 0|3=3. Then a[3]: we want to set it as small as possible. The condition is a3|a4=2. We can set a3=0 and a4=2, which is valid. \n\n        So the array [0,3,0,2] is produced.\n\n        But the sample expected output in the problem is \"0 3 2 2\". \n\n        This indicates that the problem might have additional constraints? or the sample input is different? \n\n        Let me read the sample in the problem statement: \n            \"In the first sample, these are all the arrays satisfying the statements: \n                [0, 3, 2, 2], ... \"\n\n        So the problem's first sample has 9 valid arrays, and [0,3,0,2] is not among them. \n\n        Why? \n\n        I see: the sample input might be:\n\n            4 3\n            1 2 3\n            3 4 2\n            1 3 3   # additional condition\n\n        Then for the array [0,3,0,2]:\n            a1|a3 = 0|0 = 0, but we need 3 -> fails.\n\n        So then the array [0,3,0,2] is invalid.\n\n        Therefore, the sample input in the problem is likely:\n\n            4 3\n            1 2 3\n            3 4 2\n            1 3 3\n\n        Then the base array:\n            base[1] = 3 & 3 = 3\n            base[2] = 3\n            base[3] = 2 & 3 = 2\n            base[4] = 2\n\n        adj[1] = [2,3]\n        adj[2] = [1]\n        adj[3] = [4,1]\n        adj[4] = [3]\n\n        Process i=1:\n            t = base[1] = 3\n            for j in [2,3]: \n                base[2]=3, base[3]=2 -> t = 3 & 3 & 2 = 2\n            a[1] = 3 XOR 2 = 1.\n\n        i=2:\n            t = base[2]=3\n            for j in [1]: base[1] is now 1 -> t = 3 & 1 = 1\n            a[2] = 3 XOR 1 = 2.\n\n        i=3:\n            t = base[3]=2\n            for j in [4,1]: base[4]=2, base[1]=1 -> t = 2 & 2 & 1 = 0\n            a[3] = 2 XOR 0 = 2.\n\n        i=4:\n            t = base[4]=2\n            for j in [3]: base[3]=2 -> t = 2 & 2 = 2\n            a[4] = 2 XOR 2 = 0.\n\n        Then we have [1,2,2,0]. \n        Check:\n            a1|a2 = 1|2 = 3 -> ok.\n            a3|a4 = 2|0 = 2 -> ok.\n            a1|a3 = 1|2 = 3 -> ok.\n\n        But the lexicographically smallest array in the list is [0,3,2,2]? \n            [0,3,2,2]: \n                a1|a2 = 0|3=3 -> ok.\n                a3|a4 = 2|2=2 -> ok.\n                a1|a3 = 0|2=2, but we need 3 -> fails.\n\n        So [0,3,2,2] is not valid for the condition a1|a3=3.\n\n        The valid arrays for the input with three conditions must satisfy a1|a3=3. \n        [0,3,2,2]: a1|a3=0|2=2 -> not 3.\n\n        The sample list of arrays in the problem might be for the input with two conditions, not three.\n\n        Given the confusion, we trust the algorithm that is provided and the sample input of 4 2.\n\n        But the problem says: \"In the first sample\", and then lists 9 arrays. The sample input is not provided in the note.\n\n        The problem's input specification says: \n            first line: n and q.\n\n        So the first sample has n=4 and q=2.\n\n        Then the array [0,3,0,2] is valid and lexicographically smallest.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm we have for program1.py is:\n\n            for a in range(1, n+1):\n                if val[a] == -1:\n                    val[a] = 0\n                    continue\n                t = val[a]\n                for b in adj[a]:\n                    if b == a:\n                        # self-loop: condition (a,a,x) -> then we must set a[a] = x, so we cannot remove any bit.\n                        # How do we handle? We want to set t to 0 so that val[a] ^= t leaves val[a] unchanged? \n                        # But note: if there is a self-loop, then val[a] is x (because we did val[a] &= x for the self-loop, and then any other condition? but if there is a self-loop (a,a,x), then we did:\n                        #   val[a] = (initial -1) & x = x.\n                        #   and then we also added a to adj[a] (so we have a self-loop in the list).\n                        # Then in the loop, we do:\n                        #   t = x\n                        #   for b in adj[a]: including a -> then we do t &= val[a] (which is x) -> so t remains x.\n                        #   then val[a] = x ^ x = 0 -> which is not x.\n\n                        # This is not what we want.\n\n                        # For a self-loop, we must set a[a] = x. So we should not remove any bit.\n\n                        # Therefore, in the self-loop case, we should break out? or skip? or set t=0?\n\n                        # We can set t = 0 for the self-loop case? then val[a] = x ^ 0 = x.\n\n                        # So we do: \n                        #   if b == a:\n                        #       t = 0\n                        #       break   # because we don't need to consider others? but note: there might be multiple self-loops? and also other edges.\n\n                        # However, if there is a self-loop, then the condition forces a[a] = x. So we must set it to x. We can do:\n\n                        #   t = 0   # and then break out of the neighbor loop? because we don't want to remove any bit.\n\n                        # But what if there are other conditions? \n                        #   Example: (a,a,x1) and (a,b,x2). \n                        #   Then base[a] = x1 & x2.\n                        #   We want to set a[a] = base[a]? but the self-loop forces a[a] must be x1. So we must have base[a] = x1, meaning x1 must be a subset of x2? \n                        #   But the input is guaranteed to have at least one solution. \n\n                        #   However, if we have (a,a,x1) and (a,b,x2) and x1 is not a subset of x2, then there is no solution? but the problem guarantees at least one array.\n\n                        # So we can break and set t=0.\n\n                    else:\n                        t &= val[b]   # note: val[b] might have been updated if b was processed before? but we are using the current val[b] which might be the base or might be the updated value.\n\n                val[a] ^= t\n\n        But note: we are using the current val[b] which might be the base value (if b hasn't been processed) or the updated value (if b has been processed). \n\n        In the sample with two conditions (4 2) and no self-loop, we got [0,3,0,2] which is valid.\n\n        However, in the sample with a self-loop: \n            n=1, q=1: (1,1,5)  -> then base[1]=5.\n            adj[1] = [1]\n            Process i=1:\n                if val[1]!=-1 -> then t = 5.\n                then we see b=1: self-loop -> we set t=0 and break.\n                then val[1] = 5 ^ 0 = 5.\n\n            This is correct.\n\n        But what if we have a self-loop and another edge? \n            n=2, q=2: \n                (1,1,3)   # then base[1] = 3\n                (1,2,1)   # then base[1] = 3 & 1 = 1, base[2]=1.\n            adj[1] = [1,2]\n            adj[2] = [1]\n\n            Process i=1:\n                t = 1\n                first neighbor: 1 -> self-loop: set t=0 and break the loop? \n                then val[1] = 1 ^ 0 = 1.\n\n            Then i=2:\n                t = 1\n                neighbor: 1 -> val[1]=1 -> t = 1 & 1 = 1.\n                val[2] = 1 ^ 1 = 0.\n\n            Then we have a[1]=1, a[2]=0.\n            Check: \n                condition1: a1|a1 = 1|1=1, but we need 3 -> fails.\n\n        Why? \n            The self-loop (1,1,3) forces a1=3, but then the condition (1,2,1) would be 3|0=3, not 1.\n\n        So there is no solution? but the problem guarantees at least one solution.\n\n        Therefore, the input must be consistent: if there is a self-loop (i,i,x), then for any other condition (i,j,y), we must have that x is a subset of y? because a_i = x, then a_i | a_j = x | a_j = y, so x must be a subset of y.\n\n        In this example, x=3 (binary 11) and y=1 (binary 01) -> 3 is not a subset of 1. So there is no solution.\n\n        But the problem guarantees at least one array. Therefore, we assume the input is consistent.\n\n        How to handle multiple neighbors including self-loop? We break on self-loop and set t=0, but then we only process the self-loop and skip others? \n\n        However, the self-loop forces a[i] = base[i] (which is the AND of the self-loop x and other conditions). But if the self-loop condition is (i,i,x0) and then we have (i,j,x1), then base[i] = x0 & x1. And the self-loop condition requires a[i] = x0, so we must have x0 = base[i] = x0 & x1 -> which means x0 is a subset of x1. \n\n        So in the example, base[i] = 3 & 1 = 1, but the self-loop requires a[i]=3, which is not 1. -> contradiction.\n\n        Therefore, the input will be such that if there is a self-loop (i,i,x0), then for every other condition (i,j,x1), we have x0 is a subset of x1. Then base[i] = x0.\n\n        Then in the algorithm, when we see a self-loop, we set t=0 and break, so a[i] = base[i] = x0.\n\n        Then for the condition (i,j,x1): a[i] | a[j] = x0 | a[j] = x1. Since x0 is a subset of x1, we have x0 | a[j] = x1. This can be satisfied by setting a[j] = x1 without the bits in x0? \n\n        But note: base[j] = the AND of all conditions involving j. In particular, for the condition (i,j,x1), base[j] = x1. Then we process j: \n            t = base[j] = x1\n            for neighbors: i is a neighbor -> val[i] = x0 (already set) -> t = x1 & x0 = x0 (because x0 is a subset of x1)\n            then a[j] = x1 ^ x0 = the bits in x1 that are not in x0.\n\n        Then check: a[i] | a[j] = x0 | (x1 without x0) = x0 | (x1\\x0) = x1.\n\n        So it works.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing part for the self-loop is:\n\n            if b == a:\n                t = 0\n                break   # because we break out of the for-loop for neighbors? but note: we are in a for-loop over adj[a]. We can break to skip the rest.\n\n        But note: there might be multiple self-loops? but one is enough to force a[a] = base[a]. And if there are multiple self-loops, then base[a] is the AND of all the x in the self-loops and other conditions, but the self-loops force a[a] to be the AND of the self-loop x's? and then the other conditions must be supersets.\n\n        So we break out of the neighbor loop as soon as we see a self-loop? \n\n        However, what if the self-loop is not the first neighbor? \n\n        Example: \n            adj[a] = [b, a, c]\n\n        We want to break as soon as we see a self-loop.\n\n        So we do:\n\n            for b in adj[a]:\n                if b == a:\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n                else:\n                    t &= val[b]\n\n        But note: the current code does not have an else. We can do:\n\n            for b in adj[a]:\n                if b == a:\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n                t &= val[b]\n\n        However, if we break, then we skip the rest. If we don't break, we do t &= val[b].\n\n        But what if we see a self-loop and then break, but there are other neighbors? \n            We set t=0 and break. Then val[a] = base[a] ^ 0 = base[a]. \n            This is what we want: we cannot remove any bit.\n\n        And if there is no self-loop, we do the full loop.\n\n        But note: the self-loop might appear anywhere in the list. We want to break immediately we see one.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for the self-loop is:\n\n            if b == a:\n                t = 0\n                break\n\n        But note: the current code has:\n\n            for b in adj[a]: \n                if b == a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                t &= val[b]\n\n        We need to replace the TODO with:\n\n            t = 0\n            break\n\n        However, we cannot do an unconditional break? because the code after the if is t &= val[b]. We want to skip that for the self-loop and break out.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            if b == a:\n                t = 0\n                break   # this breaks the for loop\n\n        But then after the break, we do not process the rest of the neighbors.\n\n        This is acceptable because the self-loop forces us to not remove any bit.\n\n        But what if there is a self-loop and then other neighbors? We break and set t=0, then val[a] = base[a] ^ 0 = base[a]. \n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code for the self-loop is:\n\n            if b == a:\n                t = 0\n                break\n\n        But note: the current code has the line \"t &= val[b]\" after the if. We only want to do that for non-self neighbors. So we can structure:\n\n            for b in adj[a]:\n                if b == a:\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n                else:\n                    t &= val[b]\n\n        However, the original code does not have an else. We can do:\n\n            for b in adj[a]:\n                if b == a:\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n                t &= val[b]\n\n        This is valid: if we hit a self-loop, we set t=0 and break. Otherwise, we do t &= val[b].\n\n        But note: if we break, then the value of t becomes 0. Then we do val[a] = base[a] ^ 0 = base[a].\n\n        If we don't break, then we do the full loop and then val[a] = base[a] ^ t.\n\n        So we replace the TODO with:\n\n            t = 0\n            break\n\n        But note: the variable `t` might have been already set to base[a] and then we did some & operations for some neighbors before the self-loop? \n\n        Example: \n            adj[a] = [b, a, c]   # and we are processing in this order.\n            We start with t = base[a].\n            Then we do b: t = base[a] & val[b]\n            Then we see a: we set t=0 and break.\n\n        Then we set val[a] = base[a] ^ 0 = base[a].\n\n        This is what we want: the self-loop forces us to not remove any bit, so we ignore the previous & operations.\n\n        Therefore, we can simply break and set t=0.\n\n        But note: we set t=0 and then break. We do not use the previous value of t.\n\n        So the code for the self-loop is:\n\n            if b == a:\n                t = 0\n                break\n\n        We put this inside the for-loop.\n\n        Now, for program2.py:\n\n        We are given multiple test cases. The input format:\n\n            t (number of test cases)\n            for each test case:\n                n\n                list of n integers\n\n        The code:\n\n            input_arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n            len_input = len(input_arr)\n            n = input_arr[0]   # actually, this is t, the number of test cases\n            test_cases = []\n            pos = 1\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            for case in test_cases:\n                print(\"YES\" if diff_ops(case) else \"NO\")\n\n        The function diff_ops is defined as:\n\n            def diff_ops(arr):\n                result = True\n                for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                    result = result and arr[i] % arr[0] == 0\n                return result\n\n        This function checks that for every element from index1 to the end, the element is divisible by the first element.\n\n        But is that sufficient?\n\n        The problem: \n            We are allowed to choose an index i (2<=i<=n) and change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1} (any number of times). \n            We want to make a_i=0 for all i from 2 to n.\n\n        How does the function relate? \n\n        Note: the operations only allow subtracting a_{i-1} from a_i. \n\n        We can only change a_i (for i>=2) by subtracting multiples of a_{i-1}? \n\n        But note: we can do operations in any order and any number of times. \n\n        Example: \n            [5,10] -> \n                operation1: i=2: [5,5]  (10-5)\n                operation2: i=2: [5,0]  (5-5)\n\n            So we did two subtractions of a1 from a2.\n\n            In effect, we did a2 = a2 - 2 * a1.\n\n            So we require that a2 is divisible by a1? \n\n        But what about more elements?\n\n            [1,2,3] -> \n                We can do:\n                    operation1: i=3: [1,2,1]  (3-2)\n                    operation2: i=2: [1,1,1]  (2-1)\n                    operation3: i=3: [1,1,0]  (1-1)\n                    operation4: i=2: [1,0,0]  (1-1)\n\n            How does the function work for [1,2,3]? \n                It would check: \n                    arr[1] % arr[0] = 2 % 1 = 0 -> true.\n                    arr[2] % arr[0] = 3 % 1 = 0 -> true.\n                So it returns YES.\n\n            But what if we have [2,2,3]? \n                The function: \n                    2 % 2 = 0 -> true.\n                    3 % 2 = 1 -> not 0 -> false -> NO.\n\n            But is [2,2,3] solvable? \n                We can do:\n                    operation on i=3: [2,2,1]  (3-2)\n                    then i=3: [2,2, -1] -> negative? but the problem says: \"change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}\" and the array elements are positive integers? \n                The input says: \"The second line contains n integers a1,a2,\u2026,an (1\u2264ai\u226410^9).\" and the operation: we subtract and might get non-positive? \n\n                The problem does not restrict to positive after operations. \n\n                But the sample operations: [5,10] becomes [5,5] then [5,0] -> 0 is allowed.\n\n                However, the problem says: \"change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}\" and then we use the new value for the next operations.\n\n                For [2,2,3]:\n                    We can do:\n                        i=2: [2, 0, 3]  (2-2=0)\n                        then i=3: [2,0,3] -> we can subtract a2 (which is 0) from a3: 3-0=3 -> no change? \n                    Then we cannot make a3=0.\n\n                Alternatively:\n                    i=3: [2,2,1] (3-2)\n                    then i=2: [2, 2-2=0, 1] -> [2,0,1]\n                    then i=3: [2,0,1-0=1] -> [2,0,1] -> stuck.\n\n                So it is not solvable.\n\n            Therefore, the function diff_ops checks: \n                for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n                    if arr[i] % arr[0] != 0:\n                        return False\n                return True\n\n            But is that sufficient? \n\n            Consider: \n                [3, 6, 2] \n                The function: \n                    6 % 3 = 0 -> true.\n                    2 % 3 = 2 -> false -> NO.\n\n            But is it solvable? \n                We want to make a2=0 and a3=0.\n\n                We can do:\n                    First, we can only change a2 and a3 (and then later also a3 again, and a2 again, etc.)\n\n                We can try to make a3=0 first? \n                    We can subtract a2 from a3: but a2 is 6, and 2-6 is negative? \n                Alternatively, we can change a2 first? \n                    Operation on a2: [3, 3, 2] (6-3)\n                    Then a2=3.\n                    Then we can do a3: [3,3,2-3 = -1] -> not zero and we cannot make it zero by subtracting a2 (which is 3) from -1? \n\n                Or: \n                    [3,6,2] \n                    Operation on a3: [3,6,2-6 = -4] -> then we have [3,6,-4] -> then we can do a2: [3, 6-3=3, -4] -> [3,3,-4]\n                    Then a3: [3,3, -4-3 = -7] -> not zero.\n\n                So it is not solvable.\n\n            But consider: \n                [3, 3, 3]\n                The function: \n                    3 % 3 = 0, 3 % 3 = 0 -> YES.\n\n            How to solve [3,3,3]? \n                Operation on a2: [3,0,3] \n                Then operation on a3: [3,0,3-0=3] -> no change? \n                Then we are stuck.\n\n            Alternatively:\n                Operation on a3: [3,3,0] (3-3=0)\n                Then operation on a2: [3,3-3=0,0] -> done.\n\n            So it is solvable.\n\n            But the function returns YES for [3,3,3] -> which is correct.\n\n            However, the function also returns YES for [3,3,6]? \n                3%3=0, 6%3=0 -> YES.\n\n            How to solve [3,3,6]? \n                We can do:\n                    a3: [3,3,3] (6-3) \n                    then a3: [3,3,0] (3-3)\n                    then a2: [3,0,0] \n                -> YES.\n\n            But the function only checks divisibility by the first element. \n\n            Why is that sufficient? \n\n            Insight: \n                We can only subtract multiples of a_{i-1} from a_i. \n                But note: we can change a_{i-1} by operations on index i-1? \n\n            However, the problem allows us to change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1} any number of times. This is equivalent to: \n                a_i can be replaced by a_i mod a_{i-1}? but not exactly: because we can do operations in any order and we can change a_{i-1} first.\n\n            Actually, the known solution for the problem is:\n\n                We can make the entire array (from index2 to n) zeros if and only if for every i (from 2 to n), a_i is divisible by the greatest common divisor of the entire prefix up to i-1? \n\n            But note: we can do operations in any order and any number of times. \n\n            Known solution from a contest (Round #713 (Div. 3), Problem D): \n                We can do operations arbitrarily and in any order. The necessary and sufficient condition is that the entire array after the first element must be divisible by the gcd of the absolute differences of the first element and the other elements? \n\n            Actually, the known solution is:\n\n                Let g = a[0]\n                for i in range(1, n):\n                    g = gcd(g, a[i])\n                Then we can make the array zeros if the gcd divides the last element? \n\n            But the sample [1,2,3] works and gcd(1,2,3)=1, and 1 divides everything.\n\n            However, the function we have only checks divisibility by a[0]. \n\n            Why is that sufficient? \n\n            After reading the known solution for the problem \"D. Corrupted Array\" (but the name might be different) in Round #713, the solution is:\n\n                We can simulate backwards? \n\n            Alternatively, known solution for the problem \"D. ...\" is:\n\n                We can only change a_i to a_i - a_{i-1}. We want to make a_i=0 for i>=2.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                    a2 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting a1 multiple times -> so a2 must be a multiple of a1? \n                    Then after a2 becomes 0, then a3 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting a2 (which is 0) or a1? but we can also change a3 before a2? \n\n            But note: we can do operations in any order. \n\n            Example: \n                [3, 3, 6] \n                We can do:\n                    Operation on a3: subtract a2 (which is 3) -> [3,3,3]\n                    Then operation on a3: subtract a2 (which is 3) -> [3,3,0]\n                    Then operation on a2: subtract a1 (which is 3) -> [3,0,0]\n\n            But what if we have [3, 6, 2]? \n                We cannot make a2=0 first because if we subtract a1 from a2: \n                    [3, 3, 2] \n                Then we can try to make a3=0: subtract a2 (which is 3) from a3: 2-3 = -1 -> then we have [3,3,-1] \n                Then we can make a2=0: subtract a1 from a2: 3-3=0 -> [3,0,-1]\n                Then we cannot make a3=0: subtract a2 (0) from a3: -1-0 = -1.\n\n            Alternatively, we might try to do a3 first: \n                [3,6,2-6 = -4] -> [3,6,-4]\n                Then a2: [3, 6-3=3, -4] -> [3,3,-4]\n                Then a3: [3,3,-4-3 = -7] -> not zero.\n\n            So it is not solvable.\n\n            The function we have: \n                [3,6,2]: \n                    a1=3, then a2=6 -> 6%3==0 -> true.\n                    a3=2 -> 2%3 !=0 -> false -> NO.\n\n            So it matches.\n\n            But consider: \n                [2,4,7]\n                The function: \n                    4%2=0 -> true.\n                    7%2=1 -> false -> NO.\n\n            Is it solvable? \n                We can do:\n                    Operation on a2: [2,2,7] \n                    Operation on a3: [2,2,5]  (7-2)\n                    Operation on a3: [2,2,3]  (5-2)\n                    Operation on a3: [2,2,1]  (3-2)\n                    Operation on a2: [2,0,1]  (2-2)\n                    Then we are stuck: we cannot make a3=0 by subtracting a2 (0) from 1 -> 1-0=1.\n\n                Alternatively, after [2,2,7]:\n                    Operation on a2: [2,0,7] \n                    Then a3: [2,0,7] -> we can only subtract a2 (0) -> remains 7.\n\n                So not solvable.\n\n            Now consider: \n                [2,4,6] \n                The function: \n                    4%2=0, 6%2=0 -> YES.\n\n            How to solve? \n                We can do:\n                    a2: [2,2,6] \n                    a2: [2,0,6] \n                    a3: [2,0,6] -> cannot change a3 by subtracting a2 (0) -> stuck.\n\n                But wait, we can do:\n                    a3: [2,4,2]  (6-4)\n                    a2: [2,2,2]  (4-2)\n                    a3: [2,2,0]  (2-2)\n                    a2: [2,0,0] \n\n                So it is solvable.\n\n            The function returns YES, which is correct.\n\n            Why is divisibility by the first element sufficient? \n\n            Explanation: \n                We can only subtract multiples of the first element from the other elements? \n\n                But note: we can change the other elements arbitrarily and in any order. However, the first element a1 never changes.\n\n                For an element at position i (i>=2), we can only subtract multiples of a1? \n\n                Not exactly: we might subtract a2 which is not a multiple of a1? \n\n            However, note that a2 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting a1 (because we cannot change a1). So a2 must be a multiple of a1. \n                Then after a2 becomes 0, then a3 must be reduced to 0 by subtracting a1 (because a2 is 0 and we cannot use it to subtract) or by subtracting a1 before a2 becomes 0? \n\n            But we can also subtract a2 (which is not zero) from a3. However, a2 itself is a multiple of a1. So any subtraction of a2 is equivalent to subtracting a multiple of a1. \n\n            Therefore, the entire array from a2 to an must be composed of multiples of a1. \n\n            Why? \n                Let d = a1. \n                We can only change an element by subtracting an element that is a multiple of d (because a1 is d and never changes, and a2 must become a multiple of d, and then a3 can be changed by subtracting multiples of d, and so on). \n\n            Therefore, the condition is: for every i from 1 to n-1 (if we consider 0-indexed: a0 is fixed, and a1, a2, ... a_{n-1} must be multiples of a0).\n\n            But wait: in the example [2,4,6] we have a0=2, a1=4 (which is divisible by 2), a2=6 (divisible by 2). \n\n            And [3,3,6] has a0=3, a1=3, a2=6 -> multiples.\n\n            And [3,6,2] fails because 2 is not divisible by 3.\n\n            Therefore, the function diff_ops is correct.\n\n            But note: the function uses the first element of the array (arr[0]) and checks that every element from index1 to the end is divisible by arr[0]. \n\n            However, what if the first element is not the one that remains? \n\n            The first element never changes. The operations only change a_i for i>=2.\n\n            So the condition is: for i in range(1, len(arr)): arr[i] % arr[0] == 0.\n\n            Therefore, the function is correct.\n\n            Now, we need to read the test cases.\n\n            The input: \n                first integer: t (number of test cases)\n\n                Then for each test case:\n                    first integer: n\n                    then n integers: a1, a2, ..., an\n\n            The current code:\n\n                input_arr = list of all integers from stdin.\n\n                n = input_arr[0]   # but this is t, the number of test cases.\n\n                Then we set:\n                    test_cases = []\n                    pos = 1\n                    while pos <= len_input-1:\n                        # we need to read the next test case: \n                        n_i = input_arr[pos]   # the n for this test case\n                        then the next n_i integers: input_arr[pos+1: pos+1+n_i]\n\n                        then we move pos to pos+1+n_i\n\n            So the TODO in program2.py is:\n\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]   # the length of the array for this test case\n                arr = input_arr[pos+1: pos+1+n_i]\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n                pos = pos + 1 + n_i\n\n            But note: we have a while loop: while pos <= len_input-1.\n\n            Since we have t test cases, and the total number of integers is 1 (for t) + for each test case: 1 (for n_i) + n_i (for the array) = 1 + sum_{test cases} (1 + n_i)\n\n            The while condition: we start at pos=1, and we read until we run out of integers.\n\n            But we know there are t test cases, so we could also do a for loop for t times. However, the problem says the input consists of multiple test cases, and the first integer is t.\n\n            The current code uses a while loop that goes until the end of the input array. This is safe.\n\n            Therefore, for program2.py, the missing code is:\n\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]\n                arr = input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+n_i]\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n                pos = pos + 1 + n_i\n\n        However, note: the variable `n` in the code is set to input_arr[0] (which is t). Then we are using a while loop that runs until we have consumed all the input. This is acceptable.\n\n        But what if the input has extra integers? The problem says the input format, so we assume it is exact.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            while pos <= len_input-1:\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]\n                arr = input_arr[pos+1: pos+1+n_i]\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n                pos = pos + 1 + n_i\n\n        This will read until we run out of input.\n\n        But note: the total number of integers should be 1 + sum_{i=1}^{t} (1 + n_i) = 1 + t + (sum of n_i)\n\n        And we have len_input = 1 + t + (sum of n_i)\n\n        So the while loop will run exactly t times? \n\n        Actually, no: we are not counting the test cases, we are traversing the list. It will run until we have read all integers.\n\n        But the condition is: while pos <= len_input-1.\n\n        Example: \n            t = 2\n            test1: n1=2, then array of 2 integers: [a1, a2]\n            test2: n2=3, then array of 3 integers: [b1, b2, b3]\n\n            Then input_arr = [2, 2, a1, a2, 3, b1, b2, b3]\n\n            len_input = 8\n            pos starts at 1.\n                n_i = input_arr[1] = 2\n                arr = input_arr[2:4] = [a1, a2]\n                test_cases.append([a1,a2])\n                pos = 1+1+2 = 4\n            then next: \n                n_i = input_arr[4] = 3\n                arr = input_arr[5:8] = [b1,b2,b3]\n                test_cases.append([b1,b2,b3])\n                pos = 4+1+3 = 8\n            then 8 <= 8-1? -> 8<=7 -> false -> break.\n\n            We missed the last test case? \n\n        Correction: \n            The condition is: while pos <= len_input-1.\n\n            When pos=8, then we break because 8>7 (since len_input-1 = 7).\n\n            But we have read the last test case and set pos=8, which is beyond the last index (which is 7). \n\n            How many integers? \n                indices: 0: t=2\n                        1: n1=2\n                        2: a1\n                        3: a2\n                        4: n2=3\n                        5: b1\n                        6: b2\n                        7: b3\n\n            We read the first test case: \n                n_i = input_arr[1] = 2 -> then we take [2:4] -> indices 2 and 3 -> then pos becomes 1+1+2 = 4.\n            Then we are at index4, which is within [0..7] (since 4<=7) -> so we do the next.\n                n_i = input_arr[4] = 3 -> then we take [5:8] -> indices 5,6,7 -> then pos = 4+1+3 = 8.\n            Then 8>7 -> break.\n\n            So we read both test cases.\n\n            Therefore, the code is:\n\n                while pos <= len_input-1:\n                    n_i = input_arr[pos]\n                    arr = input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+n_i]\n                    test_cases.append(arr)\n                    pos = pos + 1 + n_i\n\n        But note: the array slicing in Python: \n            arr = input_arr[pos+1: pos+1+n_i]   -> this gives n_i elements: from index pos+1 to pos+n_i (exclusive of pos+1+n_i)\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output:\n\n            program1: the missing code for the self-loop: \n                if b == a:\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n\n            program2: the missing code for reading the test cases:\n\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]\n                arr = input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+n_i]\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n                pos = pos + 1 + n_i\n\n        But note: the program2 code has:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with the above three lines.\n\n        However, we must be careful: the variable `n` in the program2 code is set to input_arr[0] (which is t). We are not using `n` in the while loop. \n\n        This is acceptable.\n\n        Now, we output in the required JSON format.\n\n        Example:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"if b == a:\\n    t = 0\\n    break\",\n                \"program2\": \"n_i = input_arr[pos]\\narr = input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+n_i]\\ntest_cases.append(arr)\\npos = pos + 1 + n_i\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program1 code is in the context of a for-loop. We are replacing the TODO with the above code.\n\n        We output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n        We must be cautious: the program1 code has an indentation level. The TODO is inside:\n\n            for b in adj[a]: \n                if b == a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n                t &= val[b]\n\n        We replace the TODO with:\n\n            t = 0\n            break\n\n        But note: the next line \"t &= val[b]\" should be skipped if we break. So we break out of the loop and skip the rest.\n\n        However, the current code has the line \"t &= val[b]\" for every neighbor. We want to avoid that for the self-loop and also break the loop.\n\n        Therefore, we replace the entire block from the if to the end of the if's body with:\n\n            t = 0\n            break\n\n        and remove the \"t &= val[b]\" for the self-loop? \n\n        But the code is:\n\n            for b in adj[a]: \n                if b == a:\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n                t &= val[b]\n\n        This is the intended code.\n\n        So we output the two lines: \"t = 0\" and \"break\" for program1.\n\n        For program2, we output the three lines.\n\n        However, the program2 code has:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We replace the TODO with the three lines.\n\n        We output the code as a string in JSON.\n\n        We must escape newlines? The problem says: Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\n\n        We output the string exactly.\n\n        Let me write:\n\n            program1: \n                \"t = 0\\n                break\"\n\n            But the original code has 8 spaces for the indentation of the if body? \n\n            The current code at the TODO is:\n\n                if b == a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO line with:\n\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n\n            The indentation level: the if is inside a for-loop that is indented by 4, and the if is indented by 8, and the body of the if should be indented by 12.\n\n            But the provided code in program1 has:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    t &= val[b]\n\n            So the if body is currently a comment. We replace the comment with:\n\n                t = 0\n                break\n\n            and then we remove the next line (t &= val[b]) for the self-loop? \n\n            But note: we cannot remove the next line for non-self-loop. \n\n            We restructure the code to:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        t = 0\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        t &= val[b]\n\n            But the original code does not have an else. We can do without else by:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        t = 0\n                        break\n                    t &= val[b]\n\n            This is valid.\n\n            So the missing code for program1 is two lines: \n                \"t = 0\"\n                \"break\"\n\n            But we must write them as two lines with the same indentation as the comment.\n\n            The comment is at the same indentation as the body of the if. So we write:\n\n                t = 0\n                break\n\n            with the same indentation (one level more than the if).\n\n            In the provided code, the if is indented by 8 spaces (relative to the for loop which is 4 spaces). So the body should be 12 spaces.\n\n            But the problem does not specify the exact indentation. However, the existing code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n            We'll assume:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        t = 0\n                        break\n                    t &= val[b]\n\n            So the two lines are indented by 12 spaces? \n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and \"NOT as markdown code\". \n\n            We output the two lines as:\n\n                \"        t = 0\\n        break\"\n\n            But wait, the existing code has:\n\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            and that line is already indented. We replace that line with two lines that are at the same indentation level.\n\n            Since the existing code in the problem for program1 has:\n\n                if b == a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the comment with:\n\n                t = 0\n                break\n\n            and we keep the same indentation.\n\n            How many spaces? The original code uses 4 spaces per level.\n\n            The for-loop: \n                for b in adj[a]:   -> 4 spaces\n                if b == a:          -> 8 spaces\n                the comment:        -> 12 spaces\n\n            So we output:\n\n                \"        t = 0\\n        break\"\n\n            But note: the next line (t &= val[b]) is at 8 spaces. We want to skip that for the self-loop by breaking.\n\n            Alternatively, we can output:\n\n                \"t = 0\\nbreak\"\n\n            and let the existing indentation remain.\n\n            But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that replaces the TODO.\n\n            The TODO is at 12 spaces. We output two lines at 12 spaces.\n\n            Therefore, we write:\n\n                program1: \"        t = 0\\n        break\"\n\n            However, the problem does not specify the exact number of spaces. But the provided code in the problem has 4-space indentation.\n\n            We'll use 8 spaces (relative to the for loop) for the body of the if? \n\n            Actually, the code in the problem is:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    t &= val[b]\n\n            The if and the for are at 4 and 8 spaces. The comment is at 12 spaces.\n\n            We replace the comment with two lines at 12 spaces.\n\n            So:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        t = 0\n                        break\n                    t &= val[b]\n\n            Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n                \"        t = 0\\n        break\"\n\n            But note: the break is a statement at the same level as t=0.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output without specifying the exact spaces? The problem says \"so that ... runs correctly\". \n\n        We'll output the two lines with the same indentation as the comment had. Since the comment is at the same level, we use the same.\n\n        But the problem does not give the exact string of the comment. We assume 8 spaces from the left margin of the for loop? \n\n        Actually, the provided code in the problem for program1 has:\n\n                for b in adj[a]: \n                    if b == a:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    t &= val[b]\n\n            The if is indented by 4 spaces (relative to the for) and the comment by 8 spaces (relative to the if) -> total 8 spaces? \n\n            Let me count:\n\n                for a in range(1, n+1):   -> 0 spaces\n                    ... (4 spaces for the body of the for)\n\n                The body of the for has:\n\n                    if ...:   -> 4 spaces\n                    else: ... -> 4 spaces\n\n                Then the for b in adj[a]: -> 4 spaces\n                then if b==a: -> 8 spaces\n                then the comment: -> 12 spaces\n                then t &= ... -> 8 spaces\n\n            So the comment is at 12 spaces.\n\n            We output two lines at 12 spaces.\n\n            We can write: 12 spaces for each line.\n\n            But to be safe, we output the code as:\n\n                \"t = 0\\nbreak\"\n\n            and hope that the indentation is taken from the context? \n\n            However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that replaces the TODO.\n\n            The TODO is one line. We replace it with two lines. The two lines should be at the same indentation level as the TODO.\n\n            We output:\n\n                program1: \"t = 0\\nbreak\"\n\n            and the existing 8 (or 12) spaces in the program will be applied? \n\n            But the program is given as:\n\n                if b == a:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the line with:\n\n                    t = 0\n                    break\n\n            So the two lines are at the same indentation as the comment.\n\n            Therefore, we output the two lines without extra indentation? \n\n            Actually, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"only the missing code\".\n\n            We output:\n\n                for program1: two lines: \"t = 0\" and \"break\", separated by a newline.\n\n            But we must put them as a string with newline.\n\n        We decide:\n\n            program1: \"t = 0\\nbreak\"\n\n            program2: \"n_i = input_arr[pos]\\narr = input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+n_i]\\ntest_cases.append(arr)\\npos = pos + 1 + n_i\"\n\n        But note: the program2 code has:\n\n            while pos <= len_input - 1:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO with the four lines? \n\n            Actually, the three lines of code and then the update of pos.\n\n            We output four lines? \n\n            The code for program2 is:\n\n                n_i = input_arr[pos]\n                arr = input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+n_i]\n                test_cases.append(arr)\n                pos = pos + 1 + n_i\n\n            So we output these four lines as a string with newlines.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output these four lines.\n\n        We output in JSON.\n\n        Example:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"t = 0\\nbreak\",\n                \"program2\": \"n_i = input_arr[pos]\\narr = input_arr[pos+1:pos+1+n_i]\\ntest_cases.append(arr)\\npos = pos + 1 + n_i\"\n            }\n\n        But note: the program2 code has a while loop. We are replacing the TODO with these four lines.\n\n        This should be correct.\n\n        Let me test program2 with the sample input:\n\n            Input: \n                2\n                2\n                5 10\n                3\n                1 2 3\n\n            Then input_arr = [2, 2, 5, 10, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\n            Then:\n                t = 2\n                test_cases = []\n                pos = 1\n                First iteration:\n                    n_i = input_arr[1] = 2\n                    arr = input_arr[2:4] = [5,10]\n                    test_cases = [[5,10]]\n                    pos = 1+1+2 = 4\n                Second iteration:\n                    n_i = input_arr[4] = 3\n                    arr = input_arr[5:8] = [1,2,3]\n                    test_cases = [[5,10], [1,2,3]]\n                    pos = 4+1+3 = 8 -> then break.\n\n            Then we call for each test case:\n                diff_ops([5,10]) -> \n                    i=1: 10 % 5 == 0 -> True -> returns True -> print \"YES\"\n                diff_ops([1,2,3]) -> \n                    i=1: 2%1==0 -> True\n                    i=2: 3%1==0 -> True -> returns True -> print \"YES\"\n\n            But the sample input also has a third test case in the note? \n\n            The problem says: \n                The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=100) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\n            So we read t test cases.\n\n            Therefore, it is correct.\n\n        We output the JSON.\n\n        Note: the program1 code: we are replacing the TODO with two lines. The existing code after the if is:\n\n                t &= val[b]\n\n            We want to avoid that for the self-loop by breaking. So the two lines we output are exactly:\n\n                t = 0\n                break\n\n            and they are placed at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\n        We assume the existing code has the proper indentation.\n\n        Therefore, the final answer."
