But our plan: \n              We want to swap the first block's 'a' (which is at index1 -> 1-indexed 2) with the last block's 'n' (which is at index2 -> 1-indexed 3). So we output: 2 and 3.

We are completing the TODO. We can do:\n\n            if n == 1:\n                # then we want to swap index0 and index1\n                j = 0   # 0-indexed index0\n            else:\n                j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n\n          But the problem says: the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2), and for n=1, ceil(1/2)=1. And we are doing one swap. But the provided code does not have an if inside for n>=2? The code structure:\n\n            if n==1:\n                print(1)\n                print(1, 2)\n            else:\n                ... our code ... So for n=1, we don't enter the else part. Therefore, for n>=2, we do the swap with j = 3*n-3*i3-1. And for n=1, we do the swap (1,2) in the if block. So we don't need to change. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n          But note: the variable `i3` is the outer loop variable. And we are in the else block (n>=2). This should work. Let me test with n=2:\n              i3=0:\n                  inner loop: \n                      i2=0: 'b' -> skip\n                      i2=1: 'a' -> found.\n                  j = 3*2 - 3*0 - 1 = 6-0-1=5. print(1+1, 5+1) -> \"2 6\"\n                  swap: b[1] and b[5]: \n                      b becomes: \n                         index0: 'b'\n                         index1: 'n' (from the last block's 'n')\n                         index2: 'n' (the first block's 'n'? but wait, initially: \n                             index0: 'b', index1: 'a', index2: 'n', index3: 'b', index4: 'a', index5: 'n'\n                         after swap: \n                             index1: 'n' (from index5) and index5: 'a' (from index1)\n                         so: ['b','n','n','b','a','a'] -> \"bnnbaa\", which is the example. So it matches. Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n          But note: the problem says the indices are 1-indexed, and we are printing i2+1 and j+1.

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to find the maximum total number of candies Alice and Bob can eat such that the total weight eaten by Alice (from the left) equals the total weight eaten by Bob (from the right) and they don't overlap.\n\nApproach for program1.py:\nWe note that the total candies eaten is the sum of the number of candies Alice eats and the number Bob eats. We want to maximize the count (not the weight) but under the condition that the total weights are equal.\n\nWe can use two pointers:\n- Let `left_sum` be the cumulative sum from the left (Alice) and `right_sum` from the right (Bob).\n- We can precompute a dictionary (or set) for the cumulative sums from the left and their corresponding index (the number of candies eaten by Alice).\n- Then traverse from the right, accumulating the sum, and for each cumulative sum from the right, check if that sum exists in the left dictionary. If it does, then we can have a candidate total candies = (left_index + 1) + (right_index + 1) [but note: the right_index is from the end, so we have to convert to index from the start? Actually, we are traversing from the right so we can count the number of candies from the right as (index+1) in the reverse array, which corresponds to the last (index+1) candies].\n\nHowever, note the condition: they cannot eat the same candy. So the two sets of candies must be disjoint.\n\nIn the provided code snippet for program1.py:\n- We have a loop that breaks when the cumulative sum from the left exceeds half of the total (x = total//2). But note: the total of the entire array is `total = sum(a)`, and we are only storing left sums that are <= total//2? Actually, the condition is that we break when s > x (which is total//2). But note: the problem does not require that the entire array is eaten? And the condition is that the two sums must be equal, but they don't have to cover the entire array.\n\nBut the provided code does:\n  d = {}\n  s = 0\n  for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n      s += i\n      if s > x: break\n      d[s] = idx+1   # storing the number of candies (which is index+1) for the cumulative sum s.\n\nThen we do:\n  s = 0\n  r = 0\n  for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n      s += i\n      if s in d: \n          # then we have a candidate: total candies = d[s] (from left) + (idx+1) (from right)\n          # and we want the maximum total candies over such s.\n\nSo we can do:\n      if s in d:\n          # But note: the left part and the right part must not overlap.\n          # The left part covers indices [0, d[s]-1] and the right part covers [n-1-idx, n-1]. \n          # We must have d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, we need to check that the two segments do not overlap.\n\n          # The left part ends at index d[s]-1, and the right part starts at n-1-idx. \n          # We require that d[s]-1 < n-1-idx  => d[s] + (idx+1) < n+1? Actually, the condition is that the left part does not include any candy that the right part includes.\n\n          # But note: the entire array is from 0 to n-1. The left part is [0, d[s]-1] and the right part is [n-1-idx, n-1]. \n          # The condition for non-overlap: d[s]-1 < n-1-idx  => d[s] + idx+1 < n+1? Actually, the next candy after the left part is at d[s] (0-indexed) and the first candy of the right part is at n-1-idx. We require d[s] <= n-1-idx? \n          # Actually, the condition is: the left part must end before the right part starts: d[s] (the count) is the number of candies from the left, so the last left candy is at index d[s]-1. The right part has idx+1 candies, so the first candy of the right part is at index n-1-idx. We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx, i.e., d[s] + idx+1 <= n? Actually, the total number of candies eaten is d[s] + (idx+1) and we require that this is at most n? But note: the entire array has n candies. However, the condition for non-overlap is that the left segment and the right segment do not share any candy. The left segment ends at d[s]-1 and the right segment starts at n-1-idx. We require d[s]-1 < n-1-idx, which is equivalent to d[s] + idx+1 <= n? Actually, d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Because the left part has d[s] candies and the right part has idx+1 candies, and if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then they don't overlap? Not exactly: consider if the left part ends at index 2 (so d[s]=3) and the right part starts at index 3, then we have non-overlap. But if the left part ends at 2 and the right part starts at 2, then the candy at index 2 is included in both? Actually, the right part is taken from the right: the last candy is at n-1, then the next is n-2, etc. So the right part of k candies is the last k candies: indices [n-k, n-1]. In our reverse iteration, when we have added idx+1 candies (from the right), then k = idx+1, so the right part starts at n - (idx+1). \n\n          Therefore, the condition for non-overlap is: the left part ends at index d[s]-1 must be < the start of the right part which is n - (idx+1). \n          => d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1) \n          => d[s] + (idx+1) < n+1? Actually, d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Because if d[s] + (idx+1) == n, then the left part ends at d[s]-1 and the right part starts at n - (idx+1) = d[s] (if d[s] + (idx+1) = n). Then the left part ends at d[s]-1 and the right part starts at d[s], so they are adjacent and non-overlapping.\n\n          Therefore, we require that the total candies eaten d[s] + (idx+1) must be <= n.\n\n          But note: the problem does not require that they eat the entire array? They can leave some in the middle. So we can only count when the two segments are disjoint.\n\n          However, the condition we have in the dictionary d[s] is for the left part that does not exceed half the total. But note: the right part might exceed half? Actually, we break the left part when s>total//2, but the right part we are adding without that break? \n\n          But note: the condition in the problem is that the two sums must be equal. And the entire array might be partitioned such that the left part and the right part together do not necessarily cover the entire array.\n\n          However, the condition for non-overlap is inherent: we are taking from the left and from the right, and we must not take the same candy. So the two segments must be disjoint.\n\n          Therefore, we must have: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\n          But note: the left part has d[s] candies and the right part has idx+1 candies, and they are disjoint only if the left part does not extend into the right part. The condition is: the last index of the left part (d[s]-1) must be less than the first index of the right part (n - (idx+1)). \n\n          So: d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1)  => d[s] + idx+1 < n+1 -> d[s] + idx+1 <= n.\n\n          Therefore, we can update r = max(r, d[s] + idx+1) only when d[s] + idx+1 <= n.\n\nHowever, note: the problem says that the total weight must be equal. We are storing the left cumulative sums and then checking the right cumulative sums. But note: the same sum s might appear multiple times? The code stores the last occurrence? Actually, we store the first occurrence? Because we break when s>total//2 and we traverse from left, so we store the earliest index for a given sum? But note: we want the maximum total candies? So we want as many candies as possible? Actually, for a fixed sum s, we want the left part to be as long as possible? But we stored the first time we achieved s? Actually, we stored the cumulative sum at the first time we achieved s? But we are traversing from left, so the first time we achieve s is the smallest index (i.e., the fewest candies). We want the maximum total candies, so we want the left part to be as long as possible? Actually, no: we want the left part to be as long as possible for a fixed s? But note: we are storing the index (which is the count) for the cumulative sum s. And we are storing the first time we get s? Actually, we are storing the last time we get s? Because we break when s>total//2, and we store every s until then. But we are storing the last index for that s? Actually, we are storing the index for the current cumulative sum. And we traverse from left to right, so the last stored s is the one with the largest index? Actually, we store every s we meet until we break. And for a given s, we store the last index (the one with the most candies) that gives that sum? Actually, we store the index for the cumulative sum s, and if the same s appears again we overwrite? But the cumulative sum is increasing? So each s appears only once? \n\nActually, the cumulative sum is strictly increasing because all weights are positive. So each s is unique.\n\nTherefore, we can do:\n\n  if s in d:\n      if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n          r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary to avoid overlap? Actually, we must also check that the two segments do not overlap. The condition we derived: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n? Actually, that condition is equivalent to non-overlap? \n\nExample: n=3, d[s]=2 (so left part: indices 0 and 1), and idx+1=1 (so right part: index 2). Then d[s]+(idx+1)=3<=3 -> non-overlap? \nBut what if d[s]=2 and idx+1=2? Then the left part is [0,1] and the right part is [1,2]? Then they overlap at index1? \n\nWait: the right part is taken from the right. The right part of 2 candies: the last two candies: indices 1 and 2 (if n=3). Then the left part ends at index1 and the right part starts at index1 -> overlap.\n\nSo the condition is: the left part must end at an index that is strictly less than the start of the right part.\n\nThe left part: indices [0, d[s]-1] (so last index is d[s]-1).\nThe right part: indices [n - (idx+1), n-1] (so the first index of the right part is n - (idx+1)).\n\nWe require: d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1) \n=> d[s] + (idx+1) < n+1 \n=> d[s] + (idx+1) <= n   (since integers) -> but note: if d[s] + (idx+1) = n, then d[s]-1 = n - (idx+1) - 1? Let me check: \nd[s] + (idx+1) = n  => d[s]-1 = n - (idx+1) - 1 = (n - idx - 1) - 1 = n - idx - 2? \nBut we require: d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1) \n=> n - (idx+1) - 1 < n - (idx+1) -> which is true? Actually, no: we have d[s]-1 = n - (idx+1) - 1? \nBut from d[s] + (idx+1)=n, we have d[s] = n - (idx+1). Then d[s]-1 = n - (idx+1) - 1, and the start of the right part is n - (idx+1). \nSo the left part ends at n - (idx+1) - 1 and the right part starts at n - (idx+1). They are adjacent -> non-overlapping.\n\nTherefore, the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is sufficient for non-overlap? Actually, no: because if d[s] + (idx+1) = n, then the left part ends at d[s]-1 = n - (idx+1) - 1, and the right part starts at n - (idx+1). So they are adjacent and non-overlapping. \n\nBut what if d[s] + (idx+1) > n? Then the two segments would overlap? \n\nTherefore, we must require d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\nBut note: the entire array has n candies. So the maximum total candies they can eat is at most n. And if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n, then we are safe.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n  if s in d:\n      if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n          r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: we are iterating from the right, and we break the left part at total//2? But the right part might exceed total//2? Actually, we don't break the right part. However, if the right cumulative sum s becomes greater than the total//2, then we might not have a corresponding left sum? But we stored left sums only up to total//2. So if the right cumulative sum is greater than total//2, then we won't find it in the dictionary? So that's okay.\n\nBut what if the entire array is partitioned? Then the left part and the right part together cover the entire array? Then the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n becomes d[s] + (idx+1) = n? \n\nBut note: the problem does not require that they eat the entire array. They can leave some in the middle.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n  if s in d:\n      if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n          r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the variable `idx` in the reverse loop: the first element in the reverse array is the last element of the original array. So when we have done `for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1])`, then the first element is at index0 of the reversed array, which is the last element of the original array. The number of candies from the right is idx+1.\n\nHowever, we must note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is always true? Because the entire array has n candies. But we are taking the left part and the right part, and they are disjoint. The maximum total candies they can eat is at most n. So if we have a candidate with d[s] + (idx+1) > n, that candidate is invalid. But note: we break the left part at total//2, and the right part might be large? However, the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is necessary to avoid overlap.\n\nBut note: the left part has d[s] candies and the right part has idx+1 candies, and the entire array has n candies. The condition for non-overlap is that the two segments do not share any candy. The left segment is the first d[s] candies, and the right segment is the last (idx+1) candies. They do not overlap if and only if the left segment ends before the right segment starts, i.e., d[s] <= n - (idx+1). \n\nBut note: d[s] + (idx+1) <= n is equivalent to d[s] <= n - (idx+1). So we can use that.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: we are iterating from the right, and we are adding the candies one by one. The variable `s` is the cumulative sum from the right. We break the left part at total//2, but the right part might go beyond? However, if the right cumulative sum becomes greater than the total//2, then we might not have a corresponding left sum? But we stored left sums only up to total//2. So if the right cumulative sum is greater than total//2, then we skip.\n\nBut note: the condition that the two sums are equal and non-overlapping. The maximum total candies we can get is the maximum over all such pairs.\n\nHowever, what if there is no solution? Then r remains 0? The problem says: they can choose to eat 0 candies? But the problem says: \"the same total weight\", and 0 is the same. But the problem says \"maximum number of candies\", and 0 is the minimum. But note: the problem says \"What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\" and if they cannot eat any without violating the condition, then 0 is acceptable? But the problem states: \"Of course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\" and they want to be fair. So 0 is always a solution? But the problem says \"maximum\", so we are to maximize the total candies.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"print a single integer\", and the example: for the first test case the answer is 2.\n\nTherefore, we are to output the maximum total candies.\n\nBut note: the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe with two pointers.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: we must break the right loop if s becomes greater than the total//2? Actually, we don't have to, because we stored only left sums up to total//2, so if s becomes greater than total//2, then we won't find it in d? So we can skip.\n\nBut the problem does not require that. We can let the right part go until the entire array is covered? But note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n must hold, and the right part cumulative sum s might become very large? But we break the left part at total//2, so we only have left sums up to total//2. Therefore, if the right cumulative sum exceeds total//2, then we won't find it in d? So we can skip.\n\nTherefore, we don't need to break the right part.\n\nBut note: the total cumulative sum from the right might be large? But the condition is that the two sums must be equal. So if the right cumulative sum is greater than total//2, then we cannot have a left cumulative sum equal to it? Because the left cumulative sum we stored are at most total//2. So we can break the right part when s > total//2? But the problem does not require that, and the total//2 is fixed. However, the total of the entire array is fixed. But note: the entire array might be partitioned: the left part and the right part together might not cover the entire array, so the total of the entire array is not necessarily the sum of the left and the right? Actually, the left part and the right part are disjoint, so the sum of the entire array is at least the sum of the left and the right? Actually, the entire array has the middle part that is not eaten. So the total of the entire array is fixed, say T. Then the condition is that the left sum = right sum = S, and we require 2*S <= T? So S is at most T//2. Therefore, if the right cumulative sum exceeds T//2, we can break? But note: we are traversing from the right, and we are adding the candies one by one. The cumulative sum from the right is increasing? Actually, we are traversing from the right, so we start at the last element and add the next one to the left? So the cumulative sum is increasing? Actually, we are starting from the last element and moving left, so the cumulative sum is increasing? \n\nBut the array is given from left to right. When we reverse, we are going from the last element to the first. So the cumulative sum from the right is the sum of the last (idx+1) elements. And as we add more (from the right moving left), the cumulative sum increases. Therefore, once we exceed T//2, we can break? Because the next ones will be even larger? And we won't find a left sum that equals the current right sum? Because the left sums we stored are at most T//2. So we can break the right loop when s > T//2? \n\nBut note: the entire array sum T is fixed. We computed x = T//2 at the beginning? Actually, we did:\n\n  x = sum(a) // 2\n\nBut note: we stored left sums that are <= x (and we break when s> x). Then for the right part, we can break when s > x? \n\nBut note: the condition for the right part: we are storing the cumulative sum from the right. We break the left part when the cumulative sum exceeds x. Similarly, we can break the right part when the cumulative sum exceeds x? Because if s (from the right) becomes greater than x, then we won't find it in the dictionary d (which only has sums <= x). And since the cumulative sum from the right is increasing, we can break.\n\nTherefore, we can add:\n\n  if s > x: \n      break   # in the right loop?\n\nBut note: the problem says the total of n over test cases is 200000, so even if we don't break, it's O(n) per test case? But the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe. However, we can break to save time.\n\nBut the provided code does not have that break. We are allowed to complete the missing part only. So we are to complete the if block.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: we must consider that the same s might appear multiple times? But we stored the left cumulative sum only once? Actually, the cumulative sum from the left is strictly increasing, so each s is unique. Similarly, the cumulative sum from the right is strictly increasing? So we are safe.\n\nBut note: the dictionary d stores the left cumulative sum and the number of candies (the index+1) for that sum. And we are traversing the right from the last candy to the first. We update r whenever we find a common sum and the segments are non-overlapping.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n    if s in d:\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the variable `r` is initialized to 0. If we don't find any, then r remains 0, which is acceptable (meaning they eat 0 candies).\n\nBut the problem says: \"the maximum number of candies\", so 0 is the minimum? But the problem does not say they must eat at least one? They can choose to eat none.\n\nSo we are done for program1.py.\n\nFor program2.py:\n\nWe are to find the minimum number of operations to make the string \"BAN\" not appear as a subsequence in the string s(n) = \"BAN\" repeated n times.\n\nWe note that the string s(n) has length 3n.\n\nThe problem says: we can swap any two distinct indices any number of times. We want the minimum number of operations.\n\nObservation:\nIn the string \"BAN\" repeated n times, the subsequence \"BAN\" appears in each block: the first block \"BAN\", the second block \"BAN\", etc. How to break the subsequence?\n\nWe note that a subsequence \"BAN\" must have a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N'. We can break it by making sure that for some occurrence of 'B', the next 'A' is not followed by an 'N'? Or we can break the order.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to swap arbitrarily. We want the minimum number of swaps.\n\nFrom the examples:\nn=1: \"BAN\" -> swap index1 and index2 (0-indexed: indices 0 and 1? but the problem uses 1-indexed) to get \"ABN\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence. So m=1.\n\nn=2: \"BANBAN\" -> swap the second character (index1 in 0-indexed) and the last character (index5) to get \"BNNBAA\". How does this break? \n  The subsequence: \n      We can try: \n          B at index0, then A at index5? but then we need an N after index5? there is none. \n          B at index0, then A at index3? then we need an N after index3: we have index4 is 'A', index5 is 'A' -> no N. \n          B at index0, then A at index4? then no N after.\n          B at index3: then A at index4? then no N after.\n          B at index3: then A at index5? then no N after.\n          So no \"BAN\".\n\nWhat is the pattern?\n\nWe can think: \n  In the original string, the positions of the letters are:\n      B: at indices 0, 3, 6, ... (i.e., 3k)\n      A: at indices 1, 4, 7, ... (i.e., 3k+1)\n      N: at indices 2, 5, 8, ... (i.e., 3k+2)\n\nTo form \"BAN\", we take a B at 3k, then an A at 3k+1, then an N at 3k+2. So each block is independent? \n\nBut note: we can also form \"BAN\" by taking a B from one block, an A from a later block, and an N from an even later block? \n  For example, in \"BANBAN\": \n      B at index0, A at index4, N at index5? -> that would be \"B\" at0, \"A\" at4, \"N\" at5 -> that is \"BAN\". \n      But wait: the A at index4 is the second character of the second block? and the N at index5 is the third character of the second block? so that is the second block? \n      Actually, the subsequence \"BAN\" can be formed by taking the first block's B and the second block's A and N? \n\nBut note: the condition for subsequence: we can delete arbitrary characters. So we can take the B from the first block, then skip the A and N of the first block, then take the A and N of the second block? That forms \"BAN\". \n\nTherefore, we must break every possible triple (B, A, N) that appears in increasing order? \n\nHow to break? We can swap some letters so that for every B that appears, there is no A after it that has an N after it? \n\nBut note: we are allowed to do multiple operations. We want the minimum.\n\nThe problem says: It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most 10^5 operations.\n\nWe note that the problem constraints: t<=100, n<=100, so we can do O(n) operations per test case.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations? \n\nIdea: \n  We note that the entire string has n B's, n A's, and n N's. \n  We want to break every occurrence of the pattern B then A then N.\n\n  One idea: swap the A's and the N's? Then we get \"BNN...BAA...\"? But then we might form \"BAN\" by taking a B from the beginning and an A from the end? \n\n  Alternatively, we can swap the B's and the N's? Then we get \"NAB\" for each block? Then the entire string becomes \"NABNAB...\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n      Why? Because to form \"BAN\", we need a B that comes after an N? But then we have an N at the beginning? Then we need a B that comes after that N? Then we have a B at index1? Then we need an A after that B? Then we have an A at index2? Then we need an N after that A? Then we have the next block: N at index3, then A at index4, then B at index5? So we can form: \n          N (index0) -> skip, then B (index1), then A (index2), then N (index3) -> that forms \"BAN\": B at1, A at2, N at3? \n      So that doesn't work.\n\n  Another idea: swap the B's and the A's? Then we get \"ABN\" for each block? Then the entire string is \"ABNABN\". \n      Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n          We can take the B at index1 (from the first block) and then the A at index0? -> but we need the A to come after the B? no, we cannot because the A is at0 and the B is at1. \n          Then we take the B at index1, then the A at index3 (from the second block) and then the N at index4? -> that forms \"B\" at1, \"A\" at3, \"N\" at4 -> \"BAN\". \n\n  So that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: \n  We can break the pattern by ensuring that for every B, we break the chain to the next A and then to the next N. \n\n  Note: the problem says that the answer for n=1 is 1, for n=2 is 1, for n=3? \n\n  The sample: \n      n=1: 1 operation.\n      n=2: 1 operation.\n\n  How about n=3? \n      The problem says: we can do it in ceil(n/2) operations? \n\n  In the provided code for n>=2: \n        print(n//2 + n%2)   # which is ceil(n/2)\n\n  And the example: \n      n=2: ceil(2/2)=1 -> matches.\n      n=3: ceil(3/2)=2.\n\n  How to do it? \n\n  The provided code for n>=2:\n        b = list('ban'*n)   # note: the problem uses \"BAN\", but the code uses lowercase? but the problem says the string is \"BAN\", so we should use uppercase? \n        Actually, the problem says: s(1)=\"BAN\", but the code uses 'ban'? \n\n  But the problem does not care about case? Actually, the problem says the string is \"BAN\", so we should use uppercase? \n\n  However, the problem says: the string \"BAN\" must not appear as a subsequence. The letters are case sensitive? The problem uses uppercase. But the code uses lowercase? \n\n  But the problem says: the string is \"BAN\" repeated. So we should use uppercase. \n\n  However, the sample: \n        n=1: swap indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed) -> which in 0-indexed: swap index0 and index1? \n        Original: ['B','A','N'] -> swap index0 and index1: ['A','B','N'] -> \"ABN\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence.\n\n  But the code uses 'ban'? Then the swap: \n        b = list('ban') -> ['b','a','n']\n        swap indices 1 and 2? but the problem says swap indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed) -> 0-indexed: swap index0 and index1? \n        Then we get ['a','b','n'] -> \"abn\", which does not have \"ban\" as a subsequence? \n\n  But the problem uses 1-indexed indices. \n\n  The code then for n>=2: \n        print(n//2 + n%2)   # which is the minimum number of operations.\n\n        Then it loops for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n            for i2 in range(n*3):\n                if b[i2]=='a':   # looking for an 'a'\n\n  What is the plan? \n\n  The idea from known solutions: \n      We can swap the first occurrence of 'A' (or 'a') in the string with the last occurrence of 'N' (or 'n')? \n\n      For n=2: \n          string: \"banban\" -> list: ['b','a','n','b','a','n']\n          We want to do one swap: \n              The first 'a' is at index1, the last 'n' is at index5? \n              Swap index1 and index5: \n                  becomes: ['b','n','n','b','a','a'] -> \"bnnbaa\", which is the example.\n\n      For n=3: \n          We do two swaps:\n            First swap: swap the first 'a' (index1) with the last 'n' (index8) -> \n                becomes: ['b','n','n','b','a','n','b','a','a']   (wait, let me do: \n                    original: [0:'b',1:'a',2:'n',3:'b',4:'a',5:'n',6:'b',7:'a',8:'n']\n                    swap index1 and index8: \n                        index1 becomes 'n', index8 becomes 'a'\n                        -> ['b','n','n','b','a','n','b','a','a']\n            Now, is there a subsequence \"ban\"? \n                We can try: \n                    take the first 'b' (index0), then the first 'a' after index0: at index4, then the first 'n' after index4: at index5 -> \"ban\" -> still present.\n\n          So we need a second swap: \n              Now we swap the next 'a'? which is at index4? with the next last 'n'? but the last 'n' now is at index5? \n              But note: we want to break the pattern? \n\n          Alternatively, we can swap the next 'a' (which is at index4) with the last available 'n' that is not swapped? but the last 'n' now is at index5? \n          Swap index4 and index5: \n              becomes: ['b','n','n','b','n','a','b','a','a'] \n          Now, check: \n              We have: \n                  B: indices0,3,6\n                  A: indices5,7,8\n                  N: indices1,2,4\n          Can we form \"BAN\"? \n              We need a B, then an A, then an N? \n              But note: after a B, we need an A that comes after the B and then an N that comes after the A? \n              But in the new string: \n                  For the B at0: \n                      A after0: at5,7,8 -> then we need an N after that A? but after index5, the only letters are 'a','b','a','a'? no N? \n                  For the B at3: \n                      A after3: at5,7,8 -> then after5: no N? \n                  For the B at6: \n                      A after6: at7,8 -> then after7: no N? \n          So it works.\n\n      Therefore, the plan: \n          We do ceil(n/2) swaps. \n          In the i-th swap (0-indexed), we swap the (i*3+1)-th character (which is the 'a' in the (i+1)-th block) with the (3*n - 1 - 3*i)-th character? \n          For the first swap (i=0): \n              the first 'a' is at index = 1 (0-indexed) -> which is 1.\n              the last 'n' is at index = 3*n-1 - 0? but 3*n-1 is the last index? \n              Actually, the last block's 'n' is at index = 3*n-1? \n              Then the next last block's 'n' is at 3*n-4? \n\n          Actually, the blocks: \n              Block0: indices [0,1,2]\n              Block1: [3,4,5]\n              Block2: [6,7,8]   (for n=3)\n\n          We want to swap:\n              Block0's 'a' (index1) with the last block's 'n' (index8) -> that's the first swap.\n              Block1's 'a' (index4) with the second last block's 'n'? which is block1's own 'n'? but that is at index5? but we want to avoid swapping within the same block? \n          Alternatively, we can swap the first block's 'a' with the last block's 'n', then the second block's 'a' with the second last block's 'n'? \n\n          For the second swap: \n              the second block's 'a' is at index4, and the second last block (which is block1) has a 'n' at index5? but that is the same block? \n          Actually, we want to swap with the last block that hasn't been swapped? \n\n          How about: \n              We swap the i-th block's 'a' (which is at index = 3*i+1) with the (n-1-i)-th block's 'n' (which is at index = 3*(n-1-i)+2 = 3*n - 3*i - 1).\n\n          For i=0: swap index1 with index 3*n-1.\n          For i=1: swap index4 with index 3*n-4? \n          For n=3: \n              i=0: swap index1 and index8 -> done.\n              i=1: swap index4 and index 3*3-4 = 5 -> swap index4 and index5.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, the plan: \n              For i in range(ceil(n/2)):\n                  swap the character at position (3*i+1) with the character at position (3*n - 3*i - 1)\n\n          Why ceil(n/2)? \n              Because we are swapping the first ceil(n/2) blocks' 'a' with the last ceil(n/2) blocks' 'n'. \n\n          How many swaps? ceil(n/2).\n\n          And we output: \n              m = ceil(n/2) = n//2 + n%2\n              Then for each i in range(ceil(n/2)):\n                  print(3*i+2, 3*n - 3*i)   # because the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\n          But note: \n              The positions: \n                  The i-th block's 'a' is at 0-indexed index = 3*i+1 -> 1-indexed: 3*i+2.\n                  The (n-1-i)-th block's 'n' is at 0-indexed index = 3*(n-1-i)+2 = 3*n - 3*i - 1 -> 1-indexed: 3*n - 3*i.\n\n          Example: n=1: \n              i=0: \n                  left index: 3*0+1 -> 0-indexed index1 -> 1-indexed: 2? \n                  right index: 3*1 - 3*0 - 1 = 2 -> 0-indexed index2 -> 1-indexed: 3.\n              But the example swap: \"swap indices 1 and 2\" (1-indexed). \n\n          Why the discrepancy? \n\n          Actually, the example: \n              The string \"BAN\": \n                  index0: 'B' -> 1-indexed: 1\n                  index1: 'A' -> 1-indexed: 2\n                  index2: 'N' -> 1-indexed: 3\n\n          The example swaps index1 and index2 (1-indexed) -> which are the 'A' and the 'N'? \n          But our plan: \n              We want to swap the first block's 'a' (which is at index1 -> 1-indexed 2) with the last block's 'n' (which is at index2 -> 1-indexed 3). \n          So we output: 2 and 3.\n\n          But the example output: \"1 2\" -> that swaps the first and the second? \n\n          Why? \n\n          Actually, the known solution for n=1: \n              We swap the first 'a' (which is at index1) with the last 'n' (which is at index2). \n          But the example output says: \"1 2\" (1-indexed) -> which would be index0 and index1? \n\n          This is a confusion.\n\n          Let me read the note: \n              \"In the first testcase, s(1) = \"BAN\", we can swap s(1)_1 and s(1)_2, converting s(1) to \"ABN\"\"\n\n          So they swapped the first character (index0) and the second character (index1). \n\n          Why would that break \"BAN\"? \n              Original: \"BAN\" -> swap index0 and index1: becomes \"ABN\". \n              Now, is \"BAN\" a subsequence? \n                  We need a 'B' -> we have a 'B' at index1? then an 'A'? but the next after index1 is index2: 'N'. Then we need an 'N'? we have the 'N' at index2? -> that would be \"B\" at1 and \"N\" at2 -> but we skipped the 'A'? \n              Actually, to form \"BAN\", we need a 'B', then an 'A', then an 'N'. \n              In \"ABN\": \n                  We can take the 'B' at index1 and then the 'N' at index2? but that gives \"BN\", not \"BAN\" because we skipped the 'A' at index0? \n                  But we can take the 'A' at index0, then the 'B' at index1, then the 'N' at index2? -> \"ABN\" -> which is not \"BAN\". \n              So \"BAN\" is not a subsequence.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"BAN\" must not appear as a subsequence. \n\n          However, our plan was to swap the 'A' and the 'N'? but the example swaps the 'B' and the 'A'. \n\n          Why does the known solution for n=2: \n              They swapped the second character (index1) and the last character (index5) -> which is the 'A' in the first block and the 'N' in the last block? \n\n          So there are two different strategies? \n\n          But note: the problem says \"any such sequence\", so we can output any.\n\n          However, the problem says: the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2). \n\n          How can we achieve with ceil(n/2) operations? \n\n          We can do:\n              For i in range(ceil(n/2)):\n                  swap the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block.\n\n          But for n=1: \n              swap the 'A' in block0 with the 'N' in block0? -> that would be swapping index1 and index2 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed: 2 and 3.\n\n          But the example did 1 and 2 (1-indexed). \n\n          However, the problem says: we can do any swap. \n\n          But note: the problem says: \"What's the smallest number of operations\", and we are doing ceil(n/2) which is 1 for n=1, and that matches.\n\n          So we can output either? \n\n          But the problem says: \"If there are multiple possible answers, output any.\"\n\n          Therefore, we can output the swaps as:\n              For i in range(ceil(n/2)):\n                  left_index = 3*i+1   (0-indexed index of the 'a' in the i-th block)\n                  right_index = 3*(n-1-i)+2   (0-indexed index of the 'n' in the (n-1-i)-th block)\n\n          Then output: \n              print(f\"{left_index+1} {right_index+1}\")\n\n          For n=1: \n              i=0: left_index = 1, right_index = 3*(0)+2 = 2? -> 0-indexed: 1 and 2 -> 1-indexed: 2 and 3.\n\n          But the example output for n=1 is \"1 2\". \n\n          Why is that? \n\n          The known solution in the problem: \n              n=1: swap indices 1 and 2 (1-indexed) -> which is 0-indexed indices0 and1.\n\n          How did they come up with that? \n\n          Actually, we can swap any two distinct indices. We don't have to swap an 'A' and an 'N'. \n\n          We can swap the 'B' and the 'A' in the first block: \n              swap index0 and index1: \n                  becomes \"ABN\", which breaks the subsequence.\n\n          Why is that valid? \n              Because the subsequence \"BAN\" requires a 'B' that comes before an 'A' that comes before an 'N'. \n              In \"ABN\": \n                  The only 'B' is at index1. The 'A' is at index0, which is before the 'B'. So we cannot form \"BAN\" because we cannot have an 'A' after the 'B'? \n                  Actually, we can skip the 'A' at0 and take the 'B' at1 and then the 'N' at2? -> that forms \"BN\", not \"BAN\". \n                  Or we can take the 'A' at0, then skip the 'B' at1 and take the 'N' at2? -> \"AN\". \n                  Or we can take the 'A' at0, then the 'B' at1, then the 'N' at2? -> \"ABN\", which is not \"BAN\". \n\n          So it breaks.\n\n          Therefore, we have two possibilities? \n\n          But note: the problem does not require a particular swap, so we can do any swap that breaks the pattern.\n\n          However, the known solution for n=2: \n              They swapped the second character (index1) and the last character (index5) -> which is the 'A' in the first block and the 'N' in the last block.\n\n          How about we do for every block i in [0, ceil(n/2)-1]:\n              swap the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'B' in the (n-1-i)-th block? \n          For n=1: \n              swap the 'A' in block0 with the 'B' in block0? -> swap index1 and index0 -> which is the same as the example.\n\n          Then for n=2: \n              swap the 'A' in block0 (index1) with the 'B' in block1 (index3) -> \n                  original: ['B','A','N','B','A','N'] -> \n                  swap index1 and index3: \n                      becomes: ['B','B','N','A','A','N'] -> \"BBN AAN\" -> \n                  Now, can we form \"BAN\"? \n                      We can take the first 'B' (index0), then the first 'A' after index0: at index3, then the first 'N' after index3: at index5 -> \"B\" at0, \"A\" at3, \"N\" at5 -> \"BAN\". \n\n          So that doesn't work.\n\n          Alternatively, swap the 'A' in the i-th block with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block? \n          For n=2: \n              swap index1 (block0's 'A') with index5 (block1's 'N') -> \n                  becomes: ['B','N','N','B','A','A'] -> \"BNNBAA\", which works.\n\n          And for n=1: \n              swap index1 (block0's 'A') with index2 (block0's 'N') -> \n                  becomes: ['B','N','A'] -> \"BNA\", which does not have \"BAN\" as a subsequence? \n                  Because to form \"BAN\", we need an 'A' after the 'B' and then an 'N' after the 'A'. Here, after the 'B' we have an 'N' then an 'A'. So we cannot get an 'A' after the 'B' and then an 'N' after that 'A'? \n                  Actually, we can take the 'B' at0, then skip the 'N' at1, then take the 'A' at2? -> then we need an 'N' after the 'A'? but there is none. \n                  Or take the 'B' at0 and the 'N' at1 -> \"BN\", not \"BAN\". \n                  So it works.\n\n          Therefore, we choose: \n              For i in range(ceil(n/2)):\n                  swap the 'A' in the i-th block (0-indexed index = 3*i+1) with the 'N' in the (n-1-i)-th block (0-indexed index = 3*(n-1-i)+2).\n\n          Then output: \n              left_index = 3*i+1, right_index = 3*(n-1-i)+2\n              In 1-indexed: left_index+1 and right_index+1.\n\n          For n=1: \n              i=0: \n                  left_index = 1 -> 1-indexed: 2\n                  right_index = 3*(0)+2 = 2 -> 1-indexed: 3\n              Output: \"2 3\"\n\n          But the example output for n=1 is \"1 2\". \n\n          However, the problem says: \"If there are multiple possible answers, output any.\"\n\n          But the problem example for n=1: \n              \"1\n               1 2\"\n\n          Why did they output 1 and 2? \n\n          We can also swap the 'B' and the 'A' in the first block: \n              left_index = 0, right_index = 1 -> 1-indexed: 1 and 2.\n\n          How can we generalize? \n\n          We note: we can break a block by swapping the 'B' and the 'A' in that block? \n          But then for multiple blocks, we break the first ceil(n/2) blocks by swapping the 'B' and the 'A'? \n\n          For n=2: \n              swap block0: swap index0 and index1 -> \n                  becomes: \"ABN\" for the first block and \"BAN\" for the second block -> \n                  Now, the entire string: \"ABNBAN\"\n                  Can we form \"BAN\"? \n                      We can take the 'B' at index2 (in the second block) and then the 'A' at index3 and the 'N' at index4? -> \"BAN\" from the second block? \n                  So we break the first block but the second block is still there.\n\n          Then we need to break the second block? \n              swap the second block: swap index3 and index4? \n                  becomes: \"ABN\" and then \"ABN\" -> \"ABNABN\", which we saw earlier: \n                      We can form \"BAN\": take the 'B' at index1 (from the first block) and then the 'A' at index3 (from the second block) and then the 'N' at index4? -> \"BAN\": \n                          B at1? but the first block: after swapping, the first block is \"ABN\": \n                              index0: 'A'\n                              index1: 'B'\n                              index2: 'N'\n                          So the 'B' at index1, then the 'A' at index3? -> but the 'A' at index3 is after the 'B' at index1? then the 'N' at index4? -> that forms \"BAN\".\n\n          So that doesn't work.\n\n          Therefore, the safest is to swap the 'A' and the 'N' as described.\n\n          But the problem example for n=1 used a swap of the first two? \n\n          How can we incorporate both? \n\n          Actually, we can break a block by either:\n            Option1: swap the 'A' and the 'N' in the block -> then the block becomes \"BNA\", which breaks the pattern? \n            Option2: swap the 'B' and the 'A' in the block -> then the block becomes \"ABN\", which breaks the pattern.\n\n          But note: we are allowed to swap any two indices. \n\n          However, we want to minimize the total number of swaps? and we are doing ceil(n/2) swaps.\n\n          And we are swapping between different blocks? \n\n          But the known solution for n=2: \n              They swapped the 'A' in the first block with the 'N' in the last block.\n\n          Why not swap the 'A' in the first block with the 'A' in the last block? that wouldn't break the last block? \n\n          The key is to break the possibility of forming \"BAN\" across blocks.\n\n          After analysis, the known solution in many contests is to swap the first ceil(n/2) blocks' 'A' with the last ceil(n/2) blocks' 'N'. \n\n          Therefore, we'll do:\n\n            m = (n+1)//2   # which is ceil(n/2)\n            print(m)\n            for i in range(m):\n                # the i-th block: the 'a' is at index = 3*i+1 (0-indexed)\n                # the block we are swapping with: the (n-1-i)-th block: the 'n' is at index = 3*(n-1-i)+2 = 3*n - 3*i - 1 (0-indexed)\n                print(3*i+2, 3*n - 3*i)   # 1-indexed: 3*i+1+1 = 3*i+2, and 3*n-3*i-1+1 = 3*n-3*i\n\n          Example n=1: \n              m=1\n              print(3*0+2, 3*1 - 3*0) -> 2, 3 -> \"2 3\"\n\n          Example n=2: \n              m=1\n              print(3*0+2, 3*2 - 3*0) -> 2, 6 -> \"2 6\"\n\n          But the example for n=2: \n              They swapped the second character (index1) and the last character (index5) -> 1-indexed: 2 and 6? \n              But the last character in n=2 is at index5 -> 1-indexed 6? yes.\n\n          However, the example output for n=2 in the problem is: \n              \"1\n               2 6\"\n\n          So we output \"2 6\", which matches.\n\n          But the example for n=1: \n              Our output: \"2 3\", but the example output is \"1 2\". \n\n          However, the problem says: \"If there are multiple possible answers, output any.\"\n\n          Therefore, we can output \"2 3\" for n=1.\n\n          But the problem example input n=1: \n              Input: 1\n              Output: \n                  1\n                  1 2\n\n          Why is that acceptable? \n\n          We can do either. \n\n          However, the provided code for n>=2: \n              It has: \n                  for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                      for i2 in range(n*3):\n                          if b[i2]=='a':\n\n          What is the purpose of the inner loop? \n\n          It seems to be looking for an 'a'? \n\n          We can do without the inner loop? \n\n          But the problem says: output any sequence of swaps of minimum length.\n\n          We know the exact indices: \n              We want to swap the 'a' at 3*i3+1 with the 'n' at 3*n-3*i3-1.\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            if n==1:\n                print(1)\n                print(1, 2)   # 1-indexed: swap index0 and index1 -> 1 and 2\n            else:\n                m = (n+1)//2\n                print(m)\n                for i in range(m):\n                    # We are going to swap the 'a' at 3*i+1 and the 'n' at 3*n-3*i-1\n                    # But note: the array b is in lowercase? \n                    # We don't actually need to simulate the swap? we just output the indices.\n                    # 1-indexed: \n                    left = 3*i+2   # because 0-indexed index 3*i+1 -> 1-indexed: 3*i+2\n                    right = 3*n - 3*i   # because 0-indexed index 3*n-3*i-1 -> 1-indexed: 3*n-3*i\n                    print(left, right)\n\n          But wait: for n=1, we did a different swap: we swapped the 'B' and the 'A'. \n\n          How about we do for n>=1: \n              m = (n+1)//2\n              print(m)\n              for i in range(m):\n                  if n==1:\n                      # then we do a special swap: swap index0 and index1 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed 1 and 2\n                      print(1, 2)\n                  else:\n                      print(3*i+2, 3*n-3*i)\n\n          But the problem says n>=1, and the constraints n>=1.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do the same swap for n=1: \n              swap the 'a' at index1 (0-indexed) and the 'n' at index2 (0-indexed) -> 1-indexed 2 and 3.\n\n          But the example output for n=1 is 1 and 2.\n\n          Since the problem accepts any, we can do:\n\n            We'll do for all n: \n                for i in range((n+1)//2):\n                    print(3*i+2, 3*n - 3*i)\n\n          But note: for n=1: \n                i=0: 3*0+2 = 2, 3*1 - 3*0 = 3 -> \"2 3\"\n\n          However, the provided code for n>=2 has an inner loop that looks for an 'a'. \n\n          How to complete the provided code? \n\n          The provided code for n>=2:\n\n                z = n*3-1\n                print(n//2+n%2)\n                for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                    for i2 in range(n*3):\n                        if b[i2]=='a':\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n          What is the plan? \n\n          It seems to be looking for the next 'a'? \n\n          We can break after finding the first 'a'? \n\n          But note: we want to swap the first 'a' we find? but then we do multiple swaps? \n\n          Actually, we are doing ceil(n/2) swaps. In the i3-th swap, we want to swap the i3-th 'a' (which is at 3*i3+1) with the (n-1-i3)-th 'n' (which is at 3*n-3*i3-1).\n\n          But the inner loop for i2 in range(3*n) is inefficient? \n\n          We can do without the inner loop? \n\n          But the problem says n<=100, so 3*n is 300, and we do ceil(n/2) which is at most 50, so total 50*300 = 15000, which is acceptable.\n\n          How to complete? \n\n          We want to find the i3-th 'a'? \n\n          Actually, the first 'a' we find might be the one we want? \n\n          But note: we are going to swap, so the array changes. \n\n          The provided code does not simulate the swap? \n\n          The problem does not require to output the final string, only the swap operations.\n\n          But the code has: \n              b = list('ban'*n)   # but then we are going to output the swaps? \n\n          However, we are not required to simulate the swaps? we only output the swap indices.\n\n          Therefore, we can ignore the array b and just output the indices we know.\n\n          But the code has an inner loop that is looking for an 'a'. \n\n          We can break out after the first 'a'? \n\n          But we want the i3-th 'a'? \n\n          How about: \n              We know the index of the i3-th 'a' is 3*i3+1? \n\n          So we can do:\n\n              # Instead of the inner loop, we can directly compute the index for the 'a' we want: \n              left_index = 3*i3+1\n              # Then we want to swap it with the 'n' at 3*n-3*i3-1.\n\n          But the code has an inner loop. We can break out of the inner loop immediately? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n              for i2 in range(n*3):\n                  if b[i2]=='a' and i2 == 3*i3+1:   # we want the i3-th 'a'\n                      # then we break and use this index?\n                      # but we also need to find the 'n'? \n\n          But the problem does not require to simulate, so we can output the swap:\n\n              print(left_index+1, 3*n-3*i3)   # 1-indexed: left_index+1 and (3*n-3*i3-1)+1 = 3*n-3*i3\n\n          And then we break the inner loop? \n\n          But the inner loop is for i2 in range(3*n): we break after the first 'a'? \n\n          Actually, we want the specific 'a'. \n\n          We can break the inner loop after we find the first 'a' that we haven't swapped? \n\n          But the array b is initially 'ban'*n, and we haven't swapped yet? \n\n          So the i3-th 'a' is at 3*i3+1.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n              # In the inner loop, we are going to break after the first 'a' we find? \n              # But we want the one at 3*i3+1.\n\n          However, the inner loop starts at i2=0. The first 'a' is at index1. Then the next at index4, then index7, etc.\n\n          So for i3=0: we want the first 'a' -> at index1 -> we break and then output the swap.\n\n          For i3=1: we want the next 'a' at index4? but after the first swap, the array might change? \n\n          But note: we are not required to simulate the swaps? we only output the swap indices.\n\n          Therefore, we can ignore the current state of the array? \n\n          But the code has an array b that we are going to update? \n\n          The problem does not require to update the array? we only output the swaps.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"output one such shortest sequence of operations\", so we only output the indices.\n\n          Therefore, we can do:\n\n              for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                  # We know the two indices: \n                  left_index = 3*i3+1\n                  right_index = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n                  # Then we output the 1-indexed indices: \n                  print(left_index+1, right_index+1)\n\n          But the code has an inner loop that we must break? \n\n          We can break out of the inner loop immediately? \n\n          How about:\n\n              for i2 in range(n*3):\n                  if b[i2]=='a':\n                      # We know we want to swap this 'a' (which is at i2) with the last 'n' that we haven't swapped? \n                      # But we know the index of the 'n' we want: 3*n-3*i3-1.\n                      # So we output: i2+1 and (3*n-3*i3-1+1) = 3*n-3*i3\n                      print(i2+1, 3*n-3*i3)\n                      # Then we break the inner loop? \n                      break\n\n          But is i2 always 3*i3+1? initially yes, but after swaps, the array changes? \n\n          However, we are not required to simulate the swaps? we only output the swap indices.\n\n          But the problem says: we are to output the swaps in the order they are done. And the next swap might depend on the current state? \n\n          But the known solution: we swap the i3-th 'a' (which was originally at 3*i3+1) with the (n-1-i3)-th 'n' (which was originally at 3*n-3*i3-1). \n\n          Therefore, we can output the original indices.\n\n          However, after a swap, the array changes. The next 'a' might move? \n\n          But we are doing the swaps in order from the front and the back. \n\n          For i3=0: we swap the 'a' at index1 with the 'n' at index (3*n-1). \n          For i3=1: we want to swap the next 'a' which is at index4? but if n>=3, then the swap of index1 and index (3*n-1) might move the 'a' at index4? \n\n          Actually, if we swap index1 and index (3*n-1), then the 'a' at index1 moves to index (3*n-1). The 'a' at index4 remains at index4? \n\n          So for i3=1: we want the 'a' that is now at index4? \n\n          But the inner loop is scanning from i2=0 to 3*n-1. It will find the next 'a' at index4? \n\n          So we can do:\n\n              for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                  # We are going to find the next 'a' that we haven't swapped? \n                  # But we know that the next 'a' we want is at the original position 3*i3+1? \n                  # However, after swaps, it might have moved? \n\n          How to track? \n\n          Alternatively, we can simulate the swaps on the array? \n\n          But the problem does not require the final string, but we are outputting the swap indices. \n\n          However, the problem says: \"output one such shortest sequence of operations\", and we know the exact swaps: \n              swap1: (3*0+1, 3*n-1)\n              swap2: (3*1+1, 3*n-4)   [if n>=3, then 3*n-4 = 3*n-3*1-1]\n\n          But after the first swap, the 'a' that was at 3*1+1 might have been swapped? \n\n          Let me do n=3:\n              Initially: \n                  indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n                  letters: b a n b a n b a n\n\n              Swap1: swap index1 and index8: \n                  becomes: b n n b a n b a a   [index1 becomes 'n', index8 becomes 'a']\n              Now, we want to swap the next 'a': which is at the original position 4? \n                  But now at index4 we have 'a'. \n              Swap2: swap index4 and index5? -> no, we want to swap with the next 'n' from the end? \n                  The next 'n' we want is at index = 3*3-3*1-1 = 9-3-1=5? \n                  So swap index4 and index5: \n                      becomes: b n n b n a b a a\n\n          So the 'a' at index4 is still there? \n\n          But what if we do n=4:\n              Swap1: swap index1 and index11: \n                  index1 becomes 'n', index11 becomes 'a'\n              Swap2: swap index4 and index8: \n                  index4 becomes 'n', index8 becomes 'a'\n\n          Then the array: \n              index0: 'b'\n              index1: 'n'\n              index2: 'n'\n              index3: 'b'\n              index4: 'n'\n              index5: 'n'\n              index6: 'b'\n              index7: 'a'\n              index8: 'a'   (from the swap: the 'n' at index8 swapped with the 'a' at index4? but wait, the 'a' at index4 was moved to index8? \n              Actually, we swap index4 and index8: \n                  originally after swap1: \n                      index4: 'a' (from the first block of the remaining? but initially the second block's 'a' was at index4) -> after swap1, it is still at index4? \n                  swap index4 and index8: \n                      index4 becomes the letter that was at index8: which was 'n' (from the last block originally, then moved? no, originally the last block's 'n' was at index11, and we swapped it to index1? so index8 is still the third block's 'n'? \n                  But after swap1: \n                      index8: originally the third block's 'n'? \n                  So after swap2: \n                      index4 becomes 'n' (from the third block) and index8 becomes 'a' (from the second block).\n\n          Then the array: \n              indices: \n                  0: 'b'\n                  1: 'n' (from the last block)\n                  2: 'n' (first block's 'n')\n                  3: 'b'\n                  4: 'n' (third block's 'n')\n                  5: 'n' (second block's 'n')\n                  6: 'b'\n                  7: 'a' (third block's 'a')\n                  8: 'a' (second block's 'a')\n                  9: 'b'\n                  10: 'a' (from the last block's 'a'? originally at index10? but we swapped index11 (which is the last index) with index1, so index10 is still 'a'? \n                  11: 'a' (originally the last block's 'n'? but swapped to index1, then we didn't touch) -> no, we swapped index1 and index11: so index11 became the first block's 'a'. \n                  But then we swapped index4 and index8: so index11 is still the first block's 'a'? \n\n          This is messy.\n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem says we can output any sequence of swaps of minimum length, we can output the swaps based on the original positions.\n\n          That is, we output:\n\n            for i in range(ceil(n/2)):\n                print(f\"{3*i+2} {3*n-3*i}\")\n\n          And then we break the inner loop immediately? \n\n          But the inner loop is there. We can break after the first 'a' we find? \n\n          How about we do:\n\n            for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n                found = False\n                for i2 in range(n*3):\n                    if b[i2]=='a':\n                        # We want to swap this 'a' with the 'n' at position = 3*n-3*i3-1\n                        j = 3*n-3*i3-1\n                        # But we also need to check that j is within the array? \n                        # Output the swap: 1-indexed indices: i2+1 and j+1\n                        print(i2+1, j+1)\n                        # Then we simulate the swap in the array b? because the next inner loop might need the updated array?\n                        # But the problem does not require simulation, but the next 'a' might be moved if we don't update?\n                        # Let's update the array for the purpose of the inner loop?\n                        b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                if not found:\n                    # but there should be one\n                    pass\n\n          This way, we update the array so that the next time we scan for an 'a', we get the next one that hasn't been moved.\n\n          But will this find the next 'a' in the original order? \n\n          Example n=3:\n            Initially: b = ['b','a','n','b','a','n','b','a','n']\n            i3=0:\n                i2=0: 'b' -> skip\n                i2=1: 'a' -> found. Then we swap index1 and index8 (0-indexed indices: j=8)\n                After swap: \n                    b[1] = 'n', b[8] = 'a'\n                    b = ['b','n','n','b','a','n','b','a','a']\n                break inner loop.\n            i3=1:\n                i2=0: 'b' -> skip\n                i2=1: 'n' -> skip\n                i2=2: 'n' -> skip\n                i2=3: 'b' -> skip\n                i2=4: 'a' -> found. Then we swap index4 and index5 (0-indexed: j = 3*3-3*1-1 = 5)\n                After swap: \n                    b[4] = 'n', b[5] = 'a'\n                    b = ['b','n','n','b','n','a','b','a','a']\n                break inner loop.\n\n          This matches.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            for i2 in range(n*3):\n                if b[i2]=='a':\n                    j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n                    print(i2+1, j+1)\n                    b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n                    break\n\n          But note: the variable `i3` is the current swap index.\n\n          However, the outer loop variable is `i3` (from the for loop: for i3 in range(n//2+n%2)).\n\n          So we can use `i3` to compute j.\n\n          But note: the variable `i3` is the same as the outer loop variable.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n            j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n          But note: the problem uses 1-indexed indices.\n\n          However, we are printing i2+1 and j+1.\n\n          This should work.\n\n          But what if there is no 'a'? then the inner loop will not break? \n\n          But initially, there are n 'a's. And we are doing ceil(n/2) swaps, and we are swapping an 'a' with an 'n'. The 'a' we swap might be moved, but we break after the first 'a' we find. And we update the array. \n\n          And we are only doing ceil(n/2) swaps, which is <= n, so we have enough 'a's? \n\n          But note: we are swapping an 'a' with an 'n'. The 'a' is then moved to the position of the 'n'. And we break the inner loop. Then in the next swap, we scan from the beginning and find the next 'a'. \n\n          Since we are doing ceil(n/2) swaps, and we have n 'a's, we will find ceil(n/2) 'a's? \n\n          But after swapping, the 'a' becomes an 'n'? no, we swap an 'a' with an 'n', so the 'a' moves to the position of the 'n', and the 'n' moves to the position of the 'a'. \n\n          So the total number of 'a's remains n. \n\n          And we are only doing ceil(n/2) swaps, so we only move ceil(n/2) 'a's. \n\n          Therefore, we will always find an 'a' in the inner loop.\n\n          So the code is safe.\n\n          But note: the variable `i3` might be shadowed? \n\n          The outer loop: \n              for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n\n          And the inner loop: \n              for i2 in range(n*3):\n\n          There is no conflict.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n          But note: the problem says the string is \"BAN\", but the code uses 'ban' (lowercase). \n\n          That is consistent.\n\n          And the swap: we are swapping the 'a' we found with the 'n' at the computed position.\n\n          This matches the plan.\n\n          However, for n=1: \n              The outer loop: i3 in range(1) -> one iteration.\n              The inner loop: \n                  i2=0: b[0]=='b' -> skip\n                  i2=1: b[1]=='a' -> found.\n                  j = 3*1 - 3*0 - 1 = 2\n                  print(1+1, 2+1) -> \"2 3\"\n                  then swap b[1] and b[2]: \n                      becomes: b[0]='b', b[1]='n', b[2]='a' -> \"bna\"\n\n          But the example output for n=1 is \"1 2\". \n\n          However, the problem accepts any. \n\n          But the problem example input n=1: \n              They output: \n                  1\n                  1 2\n\n          Why is that? \n\n          They did a different swap: swap index0 and index1 (0-indexed) -> which is 1-indexed 1 and 2.\n\n          How can we output that? \n\n          We can adjust the computation of j? \n\n          But the plan was to swap with the 'n'. \n\n          Alternatively, we can do for the first swap in the first block: swap the 'b' and the 'a'. \n\n          How to incorporate? \n\n          We can change the swap for the first block differently? \n\n          But the problem says any sequence. \n\n          However, the provided code has an inner loop that looks for an 'a'. \n\n          For n=1, the first 'a' is at index1. We can choose to swap it with index0? \n\n          But then j would be 0? \n\n          How do we know to swap with index0? \n\n          We want to break the block. We can swap the 'a' with any character that is not an 'a'? \n\n          But the problem does not specify. \n\n          Given the complexity, and since the problem accepts any, we can output the swap as we did.\n\n          But the known solution in the problem example for n=1 is \"1 2\", which is 0-indexed indices0 and1.\n\n          How can we output that with our inner loop? \n\n          In the inner loop for n=1:\n              We find the 'a' at index1. \n              We want to swap it with index0? \n\n          But how do we choose index0? \n\n          We can swap it with the first 'b' we find? \n\n          But the problem does not require a particular swap. \n\n          However, the provided code for program2.py has a fixed structure. \n\n          We are completing the TODO. \n\n          We can do:\n\n            if n == 1:\n                # then we want to swap index0 and index1\n                j = 0   # 0-indexed index0\n            else:\n                j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n\n          But the problem says: the minimum number of operations is ceil(n/2), and for n=1, ceil(1/2)=1.\n\n          And we are doing one swap.\n\n          But the provided code does not have an if inside for n>=2? \n\n          The code structure:\n\n            if n==1:\n                print(1)\n                print(1, 2)\n            else:\n                ... our code ...\n\n          So for n=1, we don't enter the else part.\n\n          Therefore, for n>=2, we do the swap with j = 3*n-3*i3-1.\n\n          And for n=1, we do the swap (1,2) in the if block.\n\n          So we don't need to change.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n          But note: the variable `i3` is the outer loop variable.\n\n          And we are in the else block (n>=2).\n\n          This should work.\n\n          Let me test with n=2:\n              i3=0:\n                  inner loop: \n                      i2=0: 'b' -> skip\n                      i2=1: 'a' -> found.\n                  j = 3*2 - 3*0 - 1 = 6-0-1=5.\n                  print(1+1, 5+1) -> \"2 6\"\n                  swap: b[1] and b[5]: \n                      b becomes: \n                         index0: 'b'\n                         index1: 'n' (from the last block's 'n')\n                         index2: 'n' (the first block's 'n'? but wait, initially: \n                             index0: 'b', index1: 'a', index2: 'n', index3: 'b', index4: 'a', index5: 'n'\n                         after swap: \n                             index1: 'n' (from index5) and index5: 'a' (from index1)\n                         so: ['b','n','n','b','a','a'] -> \"bnnbaa\", which is the example.\n\n          So it matches.\n\n          Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n            break\n\n          But note: the problem says the indices are 1-indexed, and we are printing i2+1 and j+1.\n\n          This is correct.\n\n          However, the variable `i3` is the outer loop variable. We are in the else block (n>=2).\n\n          And we break the inner loop after the first 'a' we find.\n\n          This is acceptable.\n\nSummary:\n\n  For program1.py: \n      We complete the if block:\n\n          if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n              r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n  For program2.py:\n      We complete the TODO block:\n\n          j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\n          print(i2+1, j+1)\n          b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\n          break\n\n  But note: the variable names in program2.py: \n        The outer loop variable is `i3` (in the for loop: for i3 in range(n//2+n%2))\n        The inner loop variable is `i2`\n\n  We assume that.\n\n  Now, output in the required JSON format.\n\n  Example: \n      {\"program1\": \"if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\", \"program2\": \"j = 3*n - 3*i3 - 1\\n            print(i2+1, j+1)\\n            b[i2], b[j] = b[j], b[i2]\\n            break\"}\n\n  But note: the program2.py code is in the else block for n>=2, and we are only to output the missing code.\n\n  The missing code for program1.py is the body of the if block.\n\n  The missing code for program2.py is the body of the if block (if b[i2]=='a') in the inner loop.\n\n  We output the code as a string.\n\n  However, the program2.py code has indentation: \n        for i3 in range(n//2+n%2):\n            for i2 in range(n*3):\n                if b[i2]=='a':\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n  The TODO part is indented by 4 more spaces? \n\n  We output the code with the same indentation? \n\n  The current indentation level is 12 spaces? (from the outer loops) \n\n  But the problem says: output only the missing code.\n\n  We output the code that should replace the TODO.\n\n  The TODO is at an indentation level of 16? \n\n  But we output the code as a string, and we include the newlines and the same indentation? \n\n  However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n  We output the code that would be placed in the TODO, with the same indentation.\n\n  For program1.py: the missing code is at the same indentation as the TODO (which is the if block).\n\n  For program2.py: the missing code is at the same indentation as the TODO (which is inside the if).\n\n  Therefore, we output:\n\n      program1: \n          \"if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n        r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\"\n\n      But wait, the existing code has:\n\n          if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are replacing the entire if block? \n\n      Actually, the TODO is at the comment. We are to replace the comment with the code.\n\n      The current if block:\n\n          if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We want to replace it with:\n\n          if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n              r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n      But note: the existing code has the condition \"if s in d\", and we are adding an extra condition.\n\n      However, the code we are to complete is the entire block? \n\n      The problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\"\n\n      We are to complete the block under the if.\n\n      But the current if is already written. We are to add the body.\n\n      Actually, the code has:\n\n          if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We are to replace the TODO with the body.\n\n      How about:\n\n          if s in d: \n              if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                  r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n      But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing.\n\n      The missing code is the body of the if s in d.\n\n      So we output:\n\n          if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n              r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n      But note: the existing code has the condition and the comment. We are to replace the comment.\n\n      Alternatively, we can output:\n\n          if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n: r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n      But the problem says \"blocks\", so we can output multiple lines.\n\n      However, the existing code has the if condition and then a comment. We are to put the code after the condition.\n\n      The intended code for the if block is:\n\n          if s in d and d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n              r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n      But we cannot change the condition? \n\n      The problem says: we are to complete the code. \n\n      We can do:\n\n          We replace the entire if statement? \n\n      But the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\", and the TODO is at the comment.\n\n      Given the ambiguity, and since the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", we output the code that goes in the block.\n\n      But the existing if condition is already there. We only need to add the body.\n\n      Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n          if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n              r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n      But note: the variable `r` is defined.\n\n      However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", so we output the two lines.\n\n      But the existing code has:\n\n          if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\n      We replace the TODO with:\n\n          if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n              r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n      But that would be:\n\n          if s in d: \n              if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                  r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\n      This is acceptable.\n\n"
