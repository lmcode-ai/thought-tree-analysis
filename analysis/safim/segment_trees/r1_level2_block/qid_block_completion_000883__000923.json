But note: each pair (x,y) where x has second char j and y has second char k is counted once? However, if we do:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    if j != k:\n                        case1 += data[i][j] * data[i][k]\n\n        Then for a fixed i, we are counting for every unordered pair (j,k) with j != k: the product. But note: the pair (j,k) and (k,j) are the same set of pairs?",

What does that count? For a fixed j (which we can think as the first char) and then for k and l (which are second chars) and k != l, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l] for every k and l distinct. Then we do for every j.\n\n            This is exactly case1: same first char, different second char. But we are missing case2: same second char, different first char. And note: the TODO is inside the inner loop and we have an if condition for j != l? The code has:\n\n                for j in range(11):\n                    for k in range(11):\n                        for l in range(11):\n                            if j != l:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n\n                            if k != l:\n                                answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n            This is inefficient: 11*11*11 = 1331, which is acceptable. But the TODO: we are to add something for the case j != l? And then we also add for k != l? How about we do:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    # This is for case2?",

But note: the existing line is already there. So the missing code for program1.py is only the line:\n\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n                inside the if j != l. However, the code has:\n\n                    if j != l:\n                        # TODO:",

The if j != l: is at 4*4=16 spaces? Then the TODO comment is at 16+4=20? Then the code we add should be at 20 spaces? But the next line (if k != l) is at 16 spaces? Actually, the code is:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n        The if j != l: and the if k != l: are at the same indentation level (the body of the innermost for loop). So the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n        with the same indentation as the comment (which is one more level than the if). How many spaces?",

Alternatively, we can write without counting spaces: \n\n            We are in the innermost loop: \n                for l in range(11):\n                    if j != l: [we are here] So we write: \n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n        with one level of indentation (4 spaces) inside the if. But the existing code below is at the same level as the if, so we must not break the structure. Therefore, for program1, the missing line is:\n\n            \"        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        with 8 spaces? Actually, the code we are given in program1.py has:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n        The TODO is at the same level as the two if's. The TODO comment is at the same level as the next line (the if k != l). We are to replace the TODO comment with:\n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n        at the same indentation level as the comment. How many spaces?",

But the problem doesn't specify. We'll use the above. However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and our solution for program2 is O(n) per test case, and the total n is the total length of the strings, which is <= 10^5, so it's acceptable. And for program1, the triple loop is 11^3 per test case, and t<=100, so 100*1331 = 133100, which is acceptable.",

However, if we stamp the first two: \n             first and second: we set to (say) RB -> then we have R (first) and B (second) and W (third). Then we stamp the second and third: The second is currently B, and we stamp with (say) BR: then the second becomes B (if we use BR: the first of the stamp is B and the second is R) -> then the second becomes B? and the third becomes R? -> then we have R, B, R -> not RWB. Or if we stamp the second and third with RB: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B -> then we have R, R, B -> not RWB. So it is impossible? -> \"NO\", which matches.

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be constructed using a stamp that colors two adjacent cells either as \"RB\" or \"BR\" in each operation. The solution involves checking specific conditions on segments of the string separated by white cells ('W').\n\n### Approach for Program2\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The stamp operation always affects two adjacent cells, coloring one red ('R') and the other blue ('B'). A white cell ('W') indicates that the cell was never stamped. The key insight is that any contiguous segment of non-white cells must meet two conditions:\n   - The segment length must be at least 2 (since a single cell cannot be stamped alone).\n   - The segment must contain at least one 'R' and one 'B' (since the stamp always produces one of each color in each operation).\n\n2. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - **Segmentation**: Split the input string into segments separated by 'W' characters.\n   - **Validation**: For each segment:\n     - Skip empty segments (resulting from consecutive 'W' characters).\n     - If a segment has only one character, it's invalid.\n     - If a segment lacks either 'R' or 'B', it's invalid.\n   - **Output**: For each test case, output \"YES\" if all segments are valid; otherwise, output \"NO\".\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**: \n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) per test case, where n is the string length. The operations (splitting the string and checking each segment) are linear in the size of the input.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing segments, but the total input size across test cases is bounded by 10^5, making it efficient.\n\n### Solution Code for Program2\n```python\n    s = s.strip()\n    segs = s.split('W')\n    valid = True\n    for seg in segs:\n        if not seg:\n            continue\n        if len(seg) == 1:\n            valid = False\n            break\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n            valid = False\n            break\n    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Approach for Program1\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to count pairs of strings (each of length 2) that differ in exactly one position. The solution involves efficient counting using a frequency matrix to avoid O(n^2) comparisons.\n2. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Frequency Matrix**: Use an 11x11 matrix (since letters range from 'a' to 'k') to count occurrences of each string.\n   - **Pair Counting**: For each string (i, j), count pairs:\n     - **Same First Character, Different Second Character**: For each first character, sum products of counts for different second characters.\n     - **Same Second Character, Different First Character**: For each second character, sum products of counts for different first characters.\n   - **Result Calculation**: The total pairs are the sum of both counts, divided by 2 (since each pair is counted twice in the nested loops).\n\n3. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(t * 11^3) where t is the number of test cases. The triple nested loop over 11 elements (letters 'a' to 'k') is efficient given t \u2264 100.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the fixed-size frequency matrix.\n\n### Solution Code for Program1\n```python\n                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program2**: The solution processes each test case by splitting the string into segments separated by 'W'. Each segment is checked to ensure it has at least two characters and contains both 'R' and 'B'. If any segment fails these checks, the answer is \"NO\"; otherwise, it's \"YES\".\n- **Program1**: The solution uses a frequency matrix to count string occurrences. For each possible string (i, j), it counts valid pairs by considering strings sharing the same first character but different second characters, and vice versa. The total is adjusted by dividing by 2 to account for double-counted pairs. This approach efficiently computes the result without explicit O(n^2) comparisons.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are guaranteed that the total length of all strings is <= 10^5.\n The idea:\n We note that the stamp always changes two adjacent cells: one to R and one to B (in either order: RB or BR).\n Also, note that a cell can be stamped multiple times. However, observe:\n   - A white cell must never be stamped? Actually, no: we start with white and we can only change a white cell by stamping it.\n   - But note: the stamp always stamps two adjacent cells. So if we have a white cell, it must be covered by a stamp that also covers an adjacent cell.\n\n Important observations:\n 1. The stamp operation is reversible? Actually, we are building the picture from white. But note that we can overstamp.\n\n However, note the constraints on the final picture:\n\n We can think of the following:\n   - The entire string must be partitioned into segments of non-white cells? But note: white cells are only allowed if they were never stamped? Actually, if a cell is white, it means it was never stamped? But wait: what if we stamp a white cell and then stamp it again? However, note that the stamp always sets a cell to either R or B. So if we see a white cell in the final picture, that cell was never stamped.\n\n Therefore, we can break the string by white cells. Why?\n   - Because the stamp is only applied to two adjacent cells at a time, and the operations on non-adjacent segments are independent.\n\n Steps:\n   - Split the string by 'W' (white cells). Then each contiguous segment of non-white cells must be independently checkable.\n\n Conditions for a contiguous segment (without any white) to be formable:\n   - The segment must have at least two characters? Actually, no: but note that we cannot stamp a single cell. So if we have a segment of length 1, then we cannot form it (because the stamp always covers two adjacent cells). Therefore, any segment of length 1 is invalid.\n\n   - What about longer segments?\n     We note that the stamp can be applied arbitrarily many times. However, the operations are reversible? Actually, we can model the process as starting from white and then applying a series of operations. But note: we can also use the idea of invariants.\n\n Alternate Insight (known from similar problems):\n   - In the final picture, for any contiguous non-white segment, we must have:\n        * It is impossible to have a segment of length 1 (because we cannot create a single non-white cell without also coloring its neighbor? Actually, if we stamp a white cell and then stamp it again, we can change it, but note: the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So if we have a segment of length 1, then we must have had a stamp that covered that cell and one adjacent which is white? But then the adjacent white would have been turned to a color? So we cannot have a segment of length 1?).\n\n   - Actually, the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem F) is:\n        * Split the string by 'W'\n        * For each segment (which is a contiguous string of non-white characters, i.e., only 'R' and 'B'):\n            - If the segment has length 1, then it's impossible -> return \"NO\".\n            - Also, we must have that the segment is not \"monochromatic\" in the sense that it must have at least one red and one blue? Actually, no: consider \"RR\" -> how to form \"RR\"? \n                How to form \"RR\": \n                  Start: WW -> stamp the two: either RB or BR? \n                  We cannot get RR by one stamp. But we can do:\n                    Step1: stamp the two: becomes RB (if we use RB) or BR (if we use BR). \n                  Then if we stamp again the same two, we can flip: \n                    If we have RB and we stamp again with BR: then R becomes B and B becomes R -> becomes BR? \n                  Actually, we can do:\n                    Step1: WW -> RB (using RB stamp)\n                    Step2: Now we have RB. Then if we stamp again with RB: \n                         The first cell: R -> if we stamp with RB: the first cell would become R again? Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we stamp the same two again with the same orientation, we set them to RB again. But if we use the opposite orientation? \n                    Step2: stamp the same two with BR: then the first cell becomes B and the second becomes R -> BR becomes BR? (no, becomes BR? Actually, the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we use BR, then the first cell becomes B and the second becomes R. So from RB, if we stamp with BR, we get BR? That doesn't change? \n\n                  Alternatively, we can use the stamp on overlapping positions. \n                  Example for three cells: \n                    We want: RRR. \n                    Start: WWW\n                    Step1: stamp the last two: WW -> W then the last two become RB (so WRB)\n                    Step2: stamp the first two: the first two are W and R. We can use the stamp: if we use BR on the first two: then the first becomes B and the second becomes R -> BR then B? -> BRB? \n                    Then step3: stamp the first two again? \n\n                  Actually, known solution: \n                    We note that the entire segment must have at least one R and at least one B? \n                  Why? \n                    Because the stamp always places one R and one B. And when we stamp over a segment, the entire segment must have an even number of R's? \n\n                  Actually, known invariant: \n                    Consider the positions in the segment. Let the positions be 0-indexed. \n                    We can assign a sign to each position: \n                      For a stamp that covers positions i and i+1, we can think of it as:\n                         If we use the stamp as RB: then at position i we add +1 (for R) and at i+1 we add -1 (for B) [or vice versa?] \n                    But note: we can also use BR: then at i we have -1 and at i+1 we have +1.\n\n                  Actually, we can model the entire segment as having a balance. However, note that we can stamp arbitrarily many times. \n\n                  Known solution from similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div.4) F) is to check:\n                    - The segment must not be of length 1.\n                    - The segment must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n                  Why? \n                    Because if the entire segment is all R's, then we cannot form it. Similarly, all B's. \n                  Example: \n                    \"RR\": \n                      How to form? \n                         Start: WW -> we stamp: we can get RB or BR. \n                         Then if we stamp again, we can flip the two: \n                            If we have RB and we stamp with BR: we get BR? \n                         But we want RR. \n                         Alternatively, we can stamp the same two again with the same orientation: \n                            If we have RB and we stamp again with RB: then we set the two to RB again -> still RB. \n                         How about overlapping? \n                            For three cells: \n                              We want RR? \n                              Actually, we can form \"RR\" in a segment of length 2? \n                              Let me try: \n                                Start: WW\n                                Step1: stamp the two: RB (for example)\n                                Step2: Now we want to change the second cell to R? But we can only stamp two adjacent. So we stamp the same two again but with BR: \n                                    Then we get BR? \n                                Then we have BR, which is not RR.\n\n                  Actually, known solution: \n                    We can form a segment if and only if the segment has at least two characters and it is not all the same color.\n\n                  But wait: the sample test case 5: \"BRB\" -> is formed. \n                    How about \"RRR\": \n                      We can do: \n                         Start: WWW\n                         Step1: stamp the last two: WW -> W then RB -> so we have W, R, B -> positions: [W, R, B] -> but we want RRR.\n                         Step2: stamp the first two: we can use BR: then the first two become BR -> so we have B, R, B -> not RRR.\n                         Step3: stamp the first two again: use RB -> then the first two become RB -> R, B, B -> then stamp the last two: use BR -> becomes R, B, R -> not RRR.\n\n                  Actually, known solution from Codeforces: \n                    We break the string by 'W'. For each segment:\n                      if the segment is empty: skip.\n                      else if the segment has length 1: then impossible -> return \"NO\" for the entire test case.\n                      else: check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'. If not (i.e., if the entire segment is all 'R' or all 'B'), then it's impossible.\n\n                  Then if all segments are valid, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\n                  Let's validate with the sample test cases:\n\n                  Test case 1: \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\" -> but note: the input is the final picture. The first test case in the example is: \n                    n=5, s = [\"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\"]? Actually, the example input is not provided as a single string? \n\n                  Actually, the input for the first test case is: \n                    n=5, and then 5 strings? But the problem says: the second line of each test case is a string s? \n\n                  Correction: the problem says: \n                    \"The second line of each test case contains a string s \u2014 the picture you need to make.\"\n\n                  So each test case is a string of length n? \n\n                  Example: \n                    The first test case: \n                      n=5, and the string is \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\" -> wait, that's 6? \n\n                  Actually, the example in the note: \n                    The first test case: the picture is \"BRB\" (for n=3) and then the next one is \"BRB\" again? \n\n                  The note says:\n                    Example: \"B R B B W\" -> that's a string of 5 characters: \"BRBBW\"\n\n                  So the input for a test case is a string of length n, with characters in {'W','R','B'}.\n\n                  The examples in the note:\n\n                  Example 1: \"BRBBW\" -> we break by 'W': we get two segments: \"BRBB\" and then after the W there's nothing? Actually, the string is \"BRBBW\", so the segments are: \n                    Segment1: \"BRBB\" -> length 4 -> valid? \n                    But note: the example says the answer is 5 pairs? Actually, that example was for the first problem? \n\n                  This problem is: given the entire picture (a string of length n) and we have to decide if it is possible to form.\n\n                  The note provides examples for the current problem:\n\n                  Second test case: \"aa\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\" -> but again, the input is a string? \n\n                  Actually, the note says: \n                    \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                  The second test case: the input string is \"aa\" (n=1) -> then we break: segment is \"aa\" -> length 1 -> invalid -> output \"NO\". \n\n                  Third test case: n=2, string \"WB\" -> break by 'W': we get two segments: \"\" (before W) and \"B\" (after W). The segment \"B\" has length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  Fourth test case: n=2, string \"W\" -> then we break: two segments: both empty -> valid? but note: the entire string is \"W\", so we break and get one segment? Actually, splitting \"W\" by 'W' gives ['', ''] -> two empty segments -> skip -> valid? \n                  However, the note says the fourth test case is impossible. \n\n                  Actually, the note says: \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                  But the fourth test case: the entire string is \"W\", meaning no stamp was applied? That is valid? \n                  However, the note says the fourth test case is impossible? \n\n                  Let me read the note again: \n                    \"For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... \" -> that note is for the first problem? \n\n                  Actually, the problem statement has two problems? \n\n                  This problem (program2.py) is: \n                    \"Given a final picture, is it possible to make it using the stamp zero or more times?\"\n\n                  The note says: \n                    \"For the first test case ... (explained in the statement). \n                    For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                  So the second test case: n=1? -> then the string is of length 1. Then we break: we get a segment of length 1? -> invalid -> \"NO\". \n                  Third test case: n=2, string \"WB\": \n                    segments: [ '', 'B'] -> the segment 'B' has length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n                  Fourth test case: n=2, string \"BW\": \n                    segments: ['B', ''] -> the segment 'B' has length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  But what about n=1: \n                    The input: \n                      t=?\n                      then n=1, and a string of length 1: say \"R\" -> then we break: we get one segment: \"R\" -> length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  However, the note says the fourth test case is also \"NO\", but what is the fourth test case? \n                  The note says: \n                    \"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: ... \" \n                    and then sixth and seventh.\n\n                  The seventh test case: \"RRR\" -> n=3, string \"RRR\". \n                    Break by 'W': we get one segment \"RRR\". \n                    This segment has length 3 (>=2) but is monochromatic (all R). \n                    So we output \"NO\"? \n\n                  But the note says: \n                    \"For the seventh test case, you don't need to use the stamp at all.\" -> meaning the entire picture is white? \n\n                  Actually, the seventh test case: the note says \"don't need to use the stamp at all\", so the picture is all white? \n                  Then the string is \"WWW\" (for n=3). \n                    Break by 'W': we get ['','','',''] -> all empty -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n                  However, the example fifth test case: \"BRB\" -> n=3, string \"BRB\". \n                    Break: no white -> one segment \"BRB\". \n                    Length 3 -> valid? \n                    And it has both 'B' and 'R'? -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n                  Sixth test case: \"RBB\" -> n=3, string \"RBB\". \n                    Break: one segment \"RBB\". \n                    It has both 'R' and 'B' -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n                  But wait: the note says the fifth and sixth are possible.\n\n                  However, what about the seventh? The note says we don't need to use the stamp -> so the picture is all white? \n                  Then we break and get empty segments -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n                  But then what about the example \"RRR\"? \n                  The note does not mention \"RRR\", but the problem says: \n                    \"For the third test case, the are no pairs satisfying the conditions.\" -> that was for the first problem.\n\n                  So for the current problem, we have:\n\n                  Test case: \"RRR\" -> n=3, string \"RRR\". \n                    We break: one segment \"RRR\". \n                    Conditions: \n                      length>=2 -> yes (3>=2)\n                      but it does not have both R and B? It has only R -> so invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  Now, what about \"RR\" (n=2, string \"RR\")? \n                    Segment \"RR\": \n                      length=2 -> valid? \n                      but it has only R -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  How about \"RB\" (n=2, string \"RB\")? \n                    Segment \"RB\": \n                      has both R and B -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n                  How about \"R\" (n=1, string \"R\")? \n                    Segment \"R\": length=1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  How about \"RW\" (n=2, string \"RW\")? \n                    Break: ['R', ''] -> the segment 'R' has length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  How about \"WW\" (n=2, string \"WW\")? \n                    Break: ['','',''] -> all empty -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n                  How about \"W\" (n=1, string \"W\")? \n                    Break: ['',''] -> two empty segments -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n                  But the note says the fourth test case is \"NO\", and the fourth test case is one of the ones that is impossible because of a single cell? \n\n                  The note says: \n                    \"For the second, third, and fourth test cases, it is not possible to stamp a single cell, so the answer is \"NO\".\"\n\n                  So the second test case: n=1, string \"R\" -> \"NO\" (as above).\n                  Third test case: n=2, string \"WB\" -> \"NO\" (as above: because we have a segment of length 1: the 'B' after the W).\n                  Fourth test case: n=2, string \"BW\" -> \"NO\" (similarly: segment of length 1: the 'B' at the beginning).\n\n                  But what about n=2, string \"WW\"? -> \"YES\", which is valid.\n\n                  Therefore, the algorithm for one test case:\n\n                    n = int(input().strip())\n                    s = input().strip()\n\n                    # Split the string by 'W' -> we get a list of segments (each segment is a string of non-white characters)\n                    segments = s.split('W')\n\n                    valid = True\n                    for seg in segments:\n                        if seg == \"\":\n                            continue\n                        n_seg = len(seg)\n                        # If the segment has length 1, then invalid.\n                        if n_seg == 1:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n\n                        # Check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'\n                        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n\n                    print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n                  However, note: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and the split and the checks (using 'in') for each segment: the total length of all segments is <= total n, so it's O(n).\n\n                  But note: the 'in' operation for a segment: worst-case the segment might be long, but the total length of all segments over test cases is <= 10^5, so it's acceptable.\n\n                  However, we can do without the 'in' by just traversing the segment once? But we are already breaking by segments, and the total length is bounded.\n\n                  But note: we are breaking the entire string (which is of length n) and the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do:\n\n                  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    for seg in segments:\n                        if seg == \"\":\n                            continue\n                        if len(seg) == 1:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        # Check if the segment is entirely one color?\n                        # We can do: \n                        all_r = True\n                        all_b = True\n                        for char in seg:\n                            if char == 'R':\n                                all_b = False\n                            elif char == 'B':\n                                all_r = False\n                        if all_r or all_b:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n\n                  But the 'in' is simpler and the total length is bounded.\n\n                  However, the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we can do:\n\n                  Let me test with the provided examples:\n\n                  Example 1: \"BRBBW\" -> segments: ['BRBB', ''] -> \n                    segment 'BRBB': has both R and B -> valid.\n\n                  Example 2: n=1, \"R\" -> segment ['R'] -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  Example 3: n=2, \"WB\" -> segments: ['', 'B'] -> segment 'B' has length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  Example 4: n=2, \"BW\" -> segments: ['B',''] -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  Example 5: n=3, \"BRB\" -> segment ['BRB'] -> has both -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n                  Example 6: n=3, \"RBB\" -> segment ['RBB'] -> has both -> \"YES\".\n\n                  Example 7: n=3, \"WWW\" -> segments: ['','','',''] -> all skipped -> \"YES\".\n\n                  Example 8: n=3, \"RRR\" -> segment ['RRR'] -> no 'B' -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n                  Example 9: n=0? -> not possible because n>=1.\n\n                  But note: what about an empty segment? We skip.\n\n                  However, what if the string is empty? n=0? The problem says n>=1.\n\n                  Therefore, we write:\n\n                    t = int(input().strip())\n                    for _ in range(t):\n                        n = int(input().strip())\n                        s = input().strip()\n                        segments = s.split('W')\n                        valid = True\n                        for seg in segments:\n                            if seg == \"\":\n                                continue\n                            if len(seg) == 1:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n\n                        print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n                  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n                  But wait: the note says the fifth test case: \n                    \"For the fifth test case, you can use the stamp as follows: WWW -> W RB -> BR RB\" -> that is, the string \"BRB\" -> which we have as \"YES\".\n\n                  And the sixth: \"RBB\" -> \"YES\".\n\n                  And the seventh: \"WWW\" -> \"YES\".\n\n                  And the fourth test case: the note says it's impossible -> we have to output \"NO\", and we do for the cases of length 1.\n\n                  But what about a segment that is longer but monochromatic? We output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n                  However, note: what if we have a segment that is \"RBRB\" (alternating)? That should be valid? \n                    It has both R and B -> valid.\n\n                  How about \"RRB\": \n                    It has both -> valid.\n\n                  How about \"RRRRB\": \n                    It has both -> valid.\n\n                  How about \"R\": invalid.\n\n                  How about \"RR\": invalid? \n                    But note: we cannot form \"RR\" as argued? -> so we output \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n                  Therefore, we write the code accordingly.\n\n                  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and we are splitting and then iterating over segments, which is linear.\n\n                  But note: the split operation: the entire string is of length n, and we are doing for each test case. The total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the total length of all strings is <= 10^5.\n\n                  So we can do:\n\n                    t = int(input().strip())\n                    for _ in range(t):\n                        n = int(input().strip())\n                        s = input().strip()\n                        # We'll split the string by 'W'\n                        segs = s.split('W')\n                        flag = True\n                        for seg in segs:\n                            if len(seg) == 0:\n                                continue\n                            if len(seg) == 1:\n                                flag = False\n                                break\n                            # Check if the segment has at least one R and at least one B\n                            has_r = False\n                            has_b = False\n                            for c in seg:\n                                if c == 'R':\n                                    has_r = True\n                                elif c == 'B':\n                                    has_b = True\n                            if not (has_r and has_b):\n                                flag = False\n                                break\n\n                        print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\n                  However, we can optimize the check by using set? \n                    if set(seg) == {'R'} or set(seg) == {'B'}: \n                  But note: worst-case the segment might be long, and building a set is O(n). But the total length is bounded.\n\n                  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                    if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n\n                  This is O(n) per segment, but the total length of all segments is the total length of the string without the W's, which is <= total n (<=10^5) over test cases.\n\n                  So we can do:\n\n                    for seg in segs:\n                        if seg == \"\":\n                            continue\n                        if len(seg)==1:\n                            flag = False\n                            break\n                        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                            flag = False\n                            break\n\n                  This is acceptable.\n\n                  But note: what if the segment is \"RRB\", then 'R' in seg -> True, 'B' in seg -> True -> valid.\n\n                  So we write the code accordingly.\n\n                  However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n                  Let me run the provided examples in the note:\n\n                  Example 1: The first test case in the note for the current problem? \n                    The note says: \n                      \"For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: ... \" -> that was for the first problem.\n\n                  For the current problem, the note provides:\n\n                    Test case 1: not described? \n                    Test case 2: n=1 -> \"R\" -> \"NO\"\n                    Test case 3: n=2, \"WB\" -> \"NO\"\n                    Test case 4: n=2, \"BW\" -> \"NO\"\n                    Test case 5: n=3, \"BRB\" -> \"YES\"\n                    Test case 6: n=3, \"RBB\" -> \"YES\"\n                    Test case 7: n=3, \"WWW\" -> \"YES\"\n\n                  We match.\n\n                  But wait: the note says the fourth test case is the fourth test case? and we have three test cases that are \"NO\" (test cases 2,3,4) and then three \"YES\" (5,6,7).\n\n                  Therefore, we output:\n\n                    t = int(input().strip())\n                    for _ in range(t):\n                        n = int(input().strip())\n                        s = input().strip()\n                        segs = s.split('W')\n                        valid = True\n                        for seg in segs:\n                            if len(seg) == 0:\n                                continue\n                            if len(seg) == 1:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n                            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                                valid = False\n                                break\n\n                        print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, but the input says the sum of n over test cases <= 10^5.\n\n But note: the variable t (number of test cases) can be up to 10000, but the sum of n is <= 10^5, so the maximum n in one test case might be 10^5, but the total length of all strings is 10^5.\n\n So we are safe.\n\n But note: the input has t test cases, and for each test case we read n and then a string of length n. The total length of these strings is <= 10^5.\n\n Therefore, we can write the code as above.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\", so we are safe.\n\n But note: the example input:\n\n   t = 3\n   n1 = 1, s1 = \"R\"\n   n2 = 2, s2 = \"WB\"\n   n3 = 3, s3 = \"BRB\"\n\n   total n = 1+2+3 = 6 <= 10^5.\n\n So we write:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        s = input().strip()\n        # Split the string by 'W'\n        segs = s.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for seg in segs:\n            if seg == \"\": \n                continue\n            if len(seg) == 1:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            # Check for presence of both 'R' and 'B'\n            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                valid = False\n                break\n\n        print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n However, note: what if we have multiple segments? We break at the first invalid segment? Yes.\n\n But what if the first segment is valid and the second is invalid? Then we break and output \"NO\". Correct.\n\n But what if we have a long list of segments? We break early when we find an invalid one.\n\n This is efficient.\n\n But note: the total length of all segments is the total length of the string without the W's? Actually, the split operation returns the segments without the W's, and the total length of the segments is the total number of non-W characters. And the total n (which is the length of the string) is the total non-W plus the number of W's. So the total length of the segments is <= total n.\n\n Therefore, the inner loop runs in total O(total n) over test cases.\n\n We are good.\n\n Let me test with the example: \n   s = \"RW\" -> segs = ['R', ''] -> then we see 'R' (length=1) -> invalid -> break -> \"NO\".\n\n   s = \"WR\" -> segs = ['','R'] -> then we see '' (skip) then 'R' (length=1) -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n   s = \"WWR\" -> segs = ['','','R'] -> then we see '' (skip) then '' (skip) then 'R' (length=1) -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n   s = \"RRW\" -> segs = ['RR',''] -> then we check 'RR': \n        len=2 -> ok, but then check: 'R' in 'RR' -> True, but 'B' not in 'RR' -> True? \n        condition: if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg -> \n          'R' is in seg -> True, so the condition becomes: if True or ... -> actually, the condition is: \n          if ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg): \n          -> 'R' is in seg -> so 'R' not in seg is False, but 'B' not in seg is True -> so condition is True -> invalid.\n\n        So we output \"NO\" for \"RRW\", which is correct because the segment \"RR\" is all R.\n\n   s = \"RBR\" -> segs = ['RBR'] -> \n        len=3 -> ok.\n        'R' in 'RBR' -> True, 'B' in 'RBR' -> True -> condition: if (False or False) -> False -> valid remains True.\n\n   Then we output \"YES\".\n\n   s = \"R\" -> segs = ['R'] -> invalid.\n\n   s = \"W\" -> segs = ['',''] -> skip both -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n   s = \"WW\" -> segs = ['','',''] -> skip -> \"YES\".\n\n   s = \"B\" -> invalid.\n\n   s = \"RB\" -> segs = ['RB'] -> \n        len=2 -> ok.\n        'R' in 'RB' -> True, 'B' in 'RB' -> True -> condition: False -> valid remains True -> \"YES\".\n\n   s = \"BR\" -> same as above -> \"YES\".\n\n   s = \"BB\" -> condition: 'R' not in 'BB' -> True -> condition becomes True -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n   s = \"RR\" -> same -> \"NO\".\n\n   s = \"RWB\" -> segs = ['R','B'] -> \n        first segment 'R': length=1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n   s = \"RBW\" -> segs = ['RB',''] -> valid? \n        'RB': has both -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n   s = \"WBR\" -> segs = ['','BR'] -> \n        segment 'BR': has both -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n   s = \"WRB\" -> segs = ['','','RB']? \n        Actually: \n          s = \"WRB\": \n            split at the first 'W': we get ['', 'RB'] -> then we skip the first, then the second: \n                seg='RB': len=2 -> ok, and has both -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n   But wait: the string \"WRB\" has a W at the beginning, then RB. \n        How to form? \n          Start: WWW (if n=3) -> \n          Step1: stamp the last two: WW -> W then RB -> so we have W, R, B -> which is \"WRB\". \n          So it is possible -> \"YES\".\n\n   However, our code: \n        segs = s.split('W') -> for \"WRB\": \n            We get: ['', 'RB'] -> \n            segment '' -> skip.\n            segment 'RB': len=2 -> ok, and has both -> valid -> \"YES\".\n\n   But what about \"WBR\": \n        s = \"WBR\" -> split: ['','BR'] -> same -> \"YES\".\n\n   But what about \"RWB\": \n        s = \"RWB\" -> split: ['R','B'] -> \n            segment 'R': length=1 -> invalid -> \"NO\".\n\n   How to form \"RWB\"? \n        We have three cells: \n          Start: WWW\n          We want: R at first, then W, then B.\n          How to get the first cell to R without affecting the second? \n          We can stamp the first two: \n             becomes RB then W -> RBW -> but we want RWB.\n          Then stamp the last two: \n             RBW -> stamp the last two: the second becomes R and the third becomes B? \n             But then we have R (first), then the second becomes R? -> R R B? -> \"RRB\", not \"RWB\".\n\n          Alternatively: \n             Stamp the last two first: \n                 WWW -> WW then stamp the last two: becomes WRB? \n                 But the stamp covers two adjacent: so the second and third: \n                    If we use RB: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B? -> then we have W, R, B -> \"WRB\", not \"RWB\".\n\n          How to get the first cell to R and the third to B without affecting the middle? \n          We cannot: because the stamp always covers two adjacent. So the middle cell must be stamped at least once? \n          But we want it to be white? \n          However, if we stamp the first two: \n             first and second: we set to (say) RB -> then we have R (first) and B (second) and W (third). \n          Then we stamp the second and third: \n             The second is currently B, and we stamp with (say) BR: then the second becomes B (if we use BR: the first of the stamp is B and the second is R) -> then the second becomes B? and the third becomes R? -> then we have R, B, R -> not RWB.\n\n          Or if we stamp the second and third with RB: then the second becomes R and the third becomes B -> then we have R, R, B -> not RWB.\n\n          So it is impossible? -> \"NO\", which matches.\n\n   Therefore, the code is:\n\n        t = int(input().strip())\n        for _ in range(t):\n            n = int(input().strip())\n            s = input().strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg == \"\":\n                    continue\n                if len(seg) == 1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n However, note: the condition \"if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg\" is equivalent to: \n        if not ( 'R' in seg and 'B' in seg ) \n   which is: if the segment does not have both R and B.\n\n   So we break the segment if it is missing one of the colors.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But note: what if the segment is \"RBRB\" (which has both) -> valid.\n\n   Therefore, we output the code as above.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" and the format is a json with keys \"program1\" and \"program2\". \n\n   But note: the problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n   And the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n   This is reading from stdin: \n        [*open(0)] reads all lines.\n        [2::2] means: start from index 2 (the third line, 0-indexed) and then every two lines.\n\n   How does the input look?\n        The first line: t\n        Then for each test case:\n            first line: n\n            second line: the string s\n\n        So the lines are:\n          line0: t\n          line1: n0\n          line2: s0\n          line3: n1\n          line4: s1\n          ...\n\n        Therefore, [2::2] gives: s0, s1, ... (all the strings, skipping the n's)\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            # s is the string for the test case, but note: it includes the newline? \n            s = s.strip()\n            # then do the same as above for one test case.\n\n        But note: we have to output the answer for each test case.\n\n   However, the provided code for program2.py is:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n   So we must complete the code from there.\n\n   We are going to:\n\n        t = ... but we don't have t explicitly? But we don't need t because we are iterating over the strings.\n\n        We can do:\n\n            answers = []\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                # Now, we have the string for the test case.

But we are skipping the n's by taking [2::2]. \n\n   But what if the string has a newline? We do s.strip() to remove the newline.\n\n   But note: the input might have multiple test cases, and we are reading all at once.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n        t = int(lines[0])\n        index = 1\n        results = []\n        for i in range(t):\n            n = int(lines[index]); index += 1\n            s = lines[index]; index += 1\n            # then process s\n\n   But the provided code uses: for s in [*open(0)][2::2] -> which gives every even-indexed line starting at index2 (which are the strings).\n\n   So we don't have the n of the test case? But we don't need n? because we can get the length from the string? \n\n   However, note: the string might have trailing spaces? The problem says: the string s of length n. And we read with strip? \n\n   But if we do s.strip(), then we remove the newline and any trailing spaces. But the problem says the string only contains 'W','R','B'. \n\n   And the input does not have spaces? \n\n   So we can do:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            n = len(s)   # but note: the problem says the string has length n, so we can use this.\n\n   However, the condition: the total n over test cases is the sum of the lengths of the strings? \n\n   But the problem says: the sum of n (the n from the test case, which is the length of the string) over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg == \"\":\n                    continue\n                if len(seg) == 1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n   But note: we are printing for each test case in the loop.\n\n   However, the provided code is:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n   So we complete the code from there.\n\n   But note: what if the input has an odd number of lines? The problem says: the first line is t, then for each test case: two lines (n and the string). So the total lines = 1 + 2*t.\n\n   And [2::2] will take t lines: the 2nd, 4th, ... up to the last line.\n\n   Therefore, we write:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if not seg:   # same as seg==\"\"\n                    continue\n                if len(seg) == 1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n   However, note: the break in the inner loop breaks only the inner loop? Then we print for that test case and move to the next.\n\n   But what if we break the inner loop and then we set valid to False, then we print \"NO\", and then for the next test case we start with valid=True? \n\n   Actually, the variable `valid` is set for each test case. But note: we are in the same for-loop for the test cases. We must reset `valid` for each test case.\n\n   So we should set `valid = True` at the beginning of each test case.\n\n   Therefore:\n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if not seg:\n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n   This is the complete code for program2.py.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the provided code already has:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n   So we are to complete the rest.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   And the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n   But note: we are only given program2.py? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n   But in the first part, we were given program1.py? \n\n   However, the user only provided program2.py? \n\n   Looking back: the problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", but in the description we have:\n\n        # program1.py\n        ... (the code for the first problem)\n\n        # program2.py\n        ... (the code for the second problem)\n\n   But the first problem (program1.py) was already solved? \n\n   Actually, the problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program1.py and then for program2.py.\n\n   But we are only asked for program2.py? \n\n   However, the output format requires both.\n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\" for both.\n\n   But in the first problem (program1.py) we have:\n\n        for i in range(int(input())):\n            data = [[0 for l in range(11)] for k in range(11)]\n\n            for j in range(int(input())):\n                first, second = input()\n                data[ord(first)-ord('a')][ord(second)-ord('a')] += 1\n\n            answer = 0\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n            print(answer//2)\n\n   We must complete the TODO.\n\n   How to solve the first problem?\n\n   Problem1: \n        Given n strings, each of length 2, consisting of lowercase Latin alphabet letters from 'a' to 'k'. \n        Count the number of pairs (i,j) with i<j such that the two strings differ in exactly one position.\n\n   Example: \n        The first test case: \n            n=5, strings: \"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\" -> wait, that's 6? \n\n        Actually, the note says: \n            For the first test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                (\"ab\", \"cb\"), (\"ab\", \"db\"), (\"ab\", \"aa\"), (\"cb\", \"db\") and (\"cb\", \"cc\").\n\n        So 5 pairs.\n\n   How to compute?\n\n        We have two positions: first character and second character.\n\n        Two strings (a1, a2) and (b1, b2) differ in exactly one position if:\n            (a1==b1 and a2 != b2) OR (a1 != b1 and a2==b2)\n\n        We cannot iterate over all pairs (n up to 10^5, so n^2 is 10^10 -> too slow).\n\n        We need to count by grouping.\n\n        The code provided:\n\n            data = 11x11 matrix (for letters 'a' to 'k' -> 11 letters) \n            data[i][j] = count of the string that has first char = chr(ord('a')+i) and second char = chr(ord('a')+j)\n\n        Then we want to count:\n\n            For two strings to differ in exactly one position:\n\n            Case 1: same first char, different second char.\n                For a fixed first char i, and two different second chars j and k (j != k), the number of pairs of strings with first char i and second char j and first char i and second char k is: \n                    data[i][j] * data[i][k]\n\n                Then we sum over all i, and all j != k.\n\n            Case 2: same second char, different first char.\n                For a fixed second char j, and two different first chars i and k (i != k), the number of pairs of strings with first char i and second char j and first char k and second char j is:\n                    data[i][j] * data[k][j]\n\n                Then we sum over all j, and all i != k.\n\n        Then total = (sum for case1) + (sum for case2)\n\n        But note: the pairs are unordered and we count each pair once? \n\n        However, in the above, for case1: for a fixed i, and for j and k (j<k) we would count data[i][j]*data[i][k] for the pair (j,k) and then also for (k,j) is not needed because we are iterating j and k independently? \n\n        Actually, we are iterating j and k over all 11, and when j != k, we count data[i][j]*data[i][k] for the pair of a string with second char j and a string with second char k. But note: each pair (x,y) where x has second char j and y has second char k is counted once? \n\n        However, if we do:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    if j != k:\n                        case1 += data[i][j] * data[i][k]\n\n        Then for a fixed i, we are counting for every unordered pair (j,k) with j != k: the product. But note: the pair (j,k) and (k,j) are the same set of pairs? Actually, no: the product data[i][j]*data[i][k] counts the pair (x,y) where x has second char j and y has second char k, and also the same pair is counted again when j and k are swapped? \n\n        Actually, no: because when j and k are distinct, we count the pair (x,y) exactly once? \n\n        But wait: the inner loop runs for j and then k, so for j=0, k=1: we count data[i][0]*data[i][1]\n        and for j=1, k=0: we count data[i][1]*data[i][0] -> which is the same.\n\n        So we are double-counting? \n\n        Therefore, we should either do:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(j+1, 11):\n                    case1 += data[i][j] * data[i][k]\n\n            then case1_total = case1, and then we don't double.\n\n        But then we multiply by 1? \n\n        Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            total_pairs = 0\n            for j in range(11):\n                total_pairs += data[i][j]\n            then the number of pairs for the same first char i and different second char is: \n                total_pairs*(total_pairs-1)//2? \n            but wait: that counts every unordered pair of two distinct strings in the same first char? \n            However, that counts pairs that have the same second char? \n\n            Actually, no: we want pairs that have different second chars. \n\n            The total pairs of strings in the same first char i is: \n                total = sum_j data[i][j]\n                and the number of pairs that have the same second char j is: for each j, data[i][j]*(data[i][j]-1)//2? \n            Then the number of pairs that have different second chars = total*(total-1)//2 - sum_j [ data[i][j]*(data[i][j]-1)//2 ]\n\n            But that might be more efficient? \n\n        Similarly for case2.\n\n        However, the provided code does:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n            then print(answer//2)\n\n        The current code without the TODO:\n\n            It adds for every j, k, l (three nested loops) and for every triple (j,k,l) it does:\n\n                if j != l: \n                    # TODO: so we are going to add something here? \n                if k != l:\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n            Then divides by 2.\n\n        This seems to be only doing one case? \n\n        Actually, the current code without the TODO is:\n\n            It adds for every j, k, l: \n                if k != l: \n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n            Then divides by 2.\n\n            What does that count?\n                For a fixed j (which we can think as the first char) and then for k and l (which are second chars) and k != l, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l] for every k and l distinct.\n\n            Then we do for every j.\n\n            This is exactly case1: same first char, different second char.\n\n            But we are missing case2: same second char, different first char.\n\n            And note: the TODO is inside the inner loop and we have an if condition for j != l? \n\n            The code has:\n\n                for j in range(11):\n                    for k in range(11):\n                        for l in range(11):\n                            if j != l:\n                                # TODO: Your code here\n\n                            if k != l:\n                                answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n            This is inefficient: 11*11*11 = 1331, which is acceptable.\n\n            But the TODO: we are to add something for the case j != l? \n\n            And then we also add for k != l? \n\n            How about we do:\n\n                if j != l:\n                    # This is for case2? \n                    # For case2: we fix the second char? \n                    # Actually, in the current loops, j is the first char index? and k and l are second char indices? \n\n                But wait: the data is indexed as data[first][second] = count.\n\n                For case2: same second char, different first char: \n                    We fix the second char, say k (which is the second char) and then we want to consider two different first chars: j and l? \n                    Then the count would be: data[j][k] * data[l][k]   [because the second char is k for both, and first chars are j and l]\n\n                But note: in the inner loops, we have j, k, l.\n\n                Then we can do:\n\n                    if j != l:\n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]   # but wait: the second char is k for both, and we are iterating k? \n\n                However, we are iterating k as the second char? \n\n                But then we are adding for every j, k, l with j != l: data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n                Then the total for case2 is the sum over k, and then over j != l: data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n                And then we also have the case1: which is the same as the existing line: \n                    if k != l: \n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n                But note: the existing line is inside the loops and we are adding for every j, k, l with k != l: data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n                Then we are adding both case1 and case2? \n\n                Then total = case1 + case2.\n\n                But then we do answer//2? \n\n                Why divide by 2?\n\n                Because in case1: \n                    We are counting each pair (x,y) in the same first char and different second char: \n                        For a fixed j (first char) and two distinct second chars k and l, we add data[j][k] * data[j][l] for every k and l distinct. \n                    But note: the pair (x,y) is counted once? \n                    However, we iterate k and l independently: for a fixed j, and for k and l (k != l), we add the product. \n                    But if we have two second chars: k and l, then we add when k=0, l=1 and when k=1, l=0? \n                    So we are double-counting? \n\n                Similarly, in case2: \n                    For a fixed k (second char) and two distinct first chars j and l, we add data[j][k] * data[l][k] for every j and l distinct. \n                    And we iterate j and l independently: so we count (j,l) and (l,j) -> double.\n\n                Therefore, the entire answer is double the actual? \n\n                So we divide by 2.\n\n                But wait: in case1, for a fixed j, the total for distinct second chars is: \n                    sum_{k} sum_{l != k} data[j][k] * data[j][l] \n                    = (sum_{k} data[j][k])^2 - sum_{k} data[j][k]^2   [but note: the square includes the same element? and we subtract the squares? but we are doing without the same element?]\n\n                Actually, the double sum over k and l (l != k) is: \n                    = (sum_{k} data[j][k]) * (sum_{l} data[j][l]) - sum_{k} data[j][k]^2 \n                    = (total_j)^2 - sum_{k} data[j][k]^2\n\n                And then we do the same for case2? \n\n                But the code does:\n\n                    for j in range(11):\n                        for k in range(11):\n                            for l in range(11):\n                                if j != l:\n                                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]   # case2\n                                if k != l:\n                                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]   # case1\n\n                Then we divide by 2.\n\n                But note: the case1 part: \n                    for a fixed j, and for k and l (with k != l): \n                        we add data[j][k] * data[j][l] for every k and l distinct -> that is: for each j, we add (total_j^2 - sum_k data[j][k]^2) \n                    and then we sum over j.\n\n                Similarly, case2: \n                    for a fixed k, and for j and l (with j != l): \n                        we add data[j][k] * data[l][k] for every j and l distinct -> that is: for each k, we add ( (sum_j data[j][k])^2 - sum_j data[j][k]^2 )\n                    and then we sum over k.\n\n                Then total = [ sum_j ( (sum_k data[j][k])^2 - sum_k data[j][k]^2 ) ] + [ sum_k ( (sum_j data[j][k])^2 - sum_j data[j][k]^2 ) ]\n\n                Then we divide by 2? \n\n                But note: the double counting: in case1, we counted each unordered pair of strings (x,y) that share the same first char and have different second chars exactly twice? \n                    Why? \n                    Consider two strings: (j, k1) and (j, k2) with k1 != k2.\n                    In the inner loops: \n                         j is fixed, then we iterate k and l: \n                         when k = k1 and l = k2: we add 1 (if counts are 1) \n                         when k = k2 and l = k1: we add 1 \n                    so total 2.\n\n                Similarly for case2: two strings (j1, k) and (j2, k) with j1 != j2: \n                    we add when j=j1, l=j2: 1\n                    and when j=j2, l=j1: 1 -> total 2.\n\n                Therefore, we are counting each valid pair twice? \n\n                So we divide by 2.\n\n                But note: the problem counts each unordered pair (i<j) once.\n\n                Therefore, the code is:\n\n                    for j in range(11):\n                        for k in range(11):\n                            for l in range(11):\n                                if j != l:\n                                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n                                if k != l:\n                                    answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n                    print(answer//2)\n\n                However, we can optimize by precomputing the row sums and column sums? but the grid is 11x11, so 11*11*11=1331 is acceptable.\n\n                But note: the constraints: t up to 100, and the inner triple loop is 1331 per test case, so total 100*1331 = 133100, which is acceptable.\n\n                Therefore, we complete the TODO as:\n\n                    if j != l:\n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n                And leave the next line (if k != l: ...) as is.\n\n                But note: the existing line is already there.\n\n                So the missing code for program1.py is only the line:\n\n                    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n                inside the if j != l.\n\n                However, the code has:\n\n                    if j != l:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n                So we write: \n\n                    if j != l:\n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n                But note: the variable l is the same as the inner loop variable? \n\n                Yes.\n\n                But wait: the existing line:\n\n                    if k != l:\n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n                is outside the if j != l? \n\n                So the entire inner loop body:\n\n                    if j != l:\n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n                    if k != l:\n                        answer += data[j][k] * data[j][l]\n\n                This is correct.\n\n   Therefore, for program1.py, the missing code is:\n\n        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n   And for program2.py, the missing code is the entire block from the next line after the for-loop to the print, which is:\n\n        s = s.strip()\n        segs = s.split('W')\n        valid = True\n        for seg in segs:\n            if not seg:\n                continue\n            if len(seg) == 1:\n                valid = False\n                break\n            if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n   But note: the program2.py provided code is:\n\n        for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n   So we must write the code that goes in the body of that for-loop.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code. Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n   And the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n   We write:\n\n        program1: the string \"        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n        program2: the string starting from the next line after the for s... and including the body.\n\n   But note: the program1.py code has an indentation: the TODO is inside a triple nested loop and inside an if.\n\n   So the missing line in program1.py is:\n\n        \"        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n   (with 8 spaces at the beginning? The existing code has 8 or 12? Let me see:\n\n        for j in range(11):\n            for k in range(11):\n                for l in range(11):\n                    if j != l:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n\n                    if k != l:\n                        answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n        The TODO is at an indentation level of 20 spaces? (4 for the outer for, 4 for the next, 4 for the next, 4 for the if)\n\n        But we can use the same indentation as the existing line below: which is 20 spaces? \n\n        We write: 20 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the existing line: \n            \"                    if k != l:\"\n            \"                        answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\"\n\n        The TODO is at the same level as the first if? \n\n        So we write:\n\n            \"                    if j != l:\"\n            \"                        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        But the TODO is only the line to add? \n\n        So the missing line is: \n\n            \"                        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        with 24 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the existing code after the TODO has:\n\n            if k != l:\n                answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n        The TODO is inside the if j != l, so we need to indent one more level.\n\n        The current code:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n        So the TODO is at the same level as the inner for-loop body. The if j != l: is at 4*4=16 spaces? \n\n        Then the TODO comment is at 16+4=20? \n\n        Then the code we add should be at 20 spaces? \n\n        But the next line (if k != l) is at 16 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the code is:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n        The if j != l: and the if k != l: are at the same indentation level (the body of the innermost for loop).\n\n        So the missing code for the TODO is:\n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n        with the same indentation as the comment (which is one more level than the if).\n\n        How many spaces? The problem does not specify, but we can use 4 spaces per level.\n\n        Since the for-loops are 3 levels, and the if is the fourth, then the TODO line should be at 4*4=16 spaces? \n\n        But the existing code uses 4 spaces per level? \n\n        We'll assume 4 spaces per level.\n\n        So:\n\n            Level0: for j: 0\n            Level1: for k: 4\n            Level2: for l: 8\n            Level3: if j != l: 12\n            Level4: (the TODO) 16\n\n        Then the next line (if k != l) is at level3: 12.\n\n        So the missing line is at 16 spaces: \n\n            \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        But wait: 16 spaces? \n\n        Alternatively, we can write without counting spaces: \n\n            We are in the innermost loop: \n                for l in range(11):\n                    if j != l:\n                        [we are here]\n\n        So we write: \n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n        with one level of indentation (4 spaces) inside the if.\n\n        But the existing code below is at the same level as the if, so we must not break the structure.\n\n        Therefore, for program1, the missing line is:\n\n            \"        answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        with 8 spaces? \n\n        Actually, the code we are given in program1.py has:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n        The TODO is at the same level as the two if's. The TODO comment is at the same level as the next line (the if k != l). \n\n        We are to replace the TODO comment with:\n\n            answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\n\n        at the same indentation level as the comment.\n\n        How many spaces? The problem does not specify, but we can use the same as the next line: \n\n            The next line: \"                        if k != l:\" \n\n        The TODO comment is at the same level? \n\n        Actually, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we can use 4 spaces per level. \n\n        Since the for-loops are three levels, the inner body is indented 12 spaces. Then the if j!=l is at 12, and the body of the if is 16. \n\n        But the TODO is in the body of the if, so 16 spaces.\n\n        Then the next if k!=l is at 12 spaces.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        with 16 spaces? \n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", so we output the line that goes in the TODO.\n\n        We'll output: \n\n            program1: \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        (with 16 spaces: 16 spaces is 4*4)\n\n        However, to be safe, we can use the same indentation as the existing line below? \n\n        But the existing line below is at a different level.\n\n        Alternatively, we can count the spaces in the provided code: \n\n            The line after the TODO: \n                \"                        answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\"\n\n            This line is at 24 spaces? \n\n            But the TODO is at 20? \n\n        Actually, the code we are given:\n\n            for j in range(11):\n                for k in range(11):\n                    for l in range(11):\n                        if j != l:\n                            # TODO: Your code here\n\n                        if k != l:\n                            answer += data[j][k]*data[j][l]\n\n        The if j != l: is at 12 spaces (because for j:0, for k:4, for l:8, then if:12). \n        The body of the if (the TODO) is at 16 spaces.\n        The next if k != l: is at 12 spaces, and its body is at 16 spaces.\n\n        So the TODO line should be at 16 spaces: \n\n            \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        but with 4 spaces at the inner level.\n\n        But the problem does not specify, so we assume 4 spaces per indent.\n\n        We'll write for program1: \n\n            \"    answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        with 4 spaces at the beginning? \n\n        But that would be 4 spaces, but we need 16? \n\n        Alternatively, we can output the exact string that would replace the TODO.\n\n        Since the problem does not specify, we output with 4 spaces for each level of indentation beyond the for-loops.\n\n        We have 3 for-loops (12 spaces) and then the if adds 4 -> 16 spaces.\n\n        So 16 spaces: \n\n            program1: \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n\n        (16 spaces at the beginning)\n\n   For program2, we output the entire block of code that goes in the for-loop, with the same indentation as the for-loop.\n\n        The for-loop: \n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n        Then the body should be indented.\n\n        We'll use 4 spaces for the body.\n\n        So:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n            segs = s.split('W')\n            valid = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if not seg:\n                    continue\n                if len(seg) == 1:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the for-loop in program2 is one line, so the body must be indented.\n\n        We output the above block with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line? \n\n        Actually, the entire block is the body of the for s... loop.\n\n        We write:\n\n            program2: \n                s = s.strip()\n                segs = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for seg in segs:\n                    if not seg:\n                        continue\n                    if len(seg) == 1:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the for s... loop is already given, so we only output the body.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code\", and the provided code has the for-loop, so we output the body.\n\n        But the body is multiple lines.\n\n        We must output it as a string that can be inserted.\n\n        We can use triple quotes? But the problem says not markdown.\n\n        We output as a string with newlines.\n\n        But the output format is JSON. We must escape newlines.\n\n        Alternatively, we can output as a single string with \\n.\n\n        Example: \n\n            \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if not seg:\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg) == 1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if valid else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n        But note: the quotes inside: we have single quotes in split('W') and double quotes in the print. We can use single quotes for the JSON string? \n\n        The outer JSON uses double quotes, so we escape the double quotes in the print.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use:\n\n            print(\\\"YES\\\" if valid else \\\"NO\\\")\n\n        But the entire string for program2 must be a JSON string.\n\n        We'll do:\n\n            \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if not seg:\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg) == 1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if valid else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n        The indentation: \n            The for s... loop is at the top level, then the body is indented 4 spaces? \n\n        We'll use 4 spaces for the entire body.\n\n        But the provided code for program2 is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n        and then we insert the body.\n\n        So the body should be indented.\n\n        In Python, we use 4 spaces for the first indent.\n\n        Therefore, we output the body with 4 spaces at the beginning of each line.\n\n   Summary:\n\n        program1: \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\"\n        program2: \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if not seg:\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg) == 1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if valid else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n   But wait: in program2, the variable `s` is already defined by the for-loop? \n\n        for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n        Then we do s = s.strip() -> that's fine.\n\n   We output the JSON.\n\n   Note: the entire JSON string must be valid.\n\n   We write:\n\n        {\n            \"program1\": \"                answer += data[j][k] * data[l][k]\",\n            \"program2\": \"    s = s.strip()\\n    segs = s.split('W')\\n    valid = True\\n    for seg in segs:\\n        if not seg:\\n            continue\\n        if len(seg) == 1:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n        if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\\n            valid = False\\n            break\\n    print(\\\"YES\\\" if valid else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2 string has a for-loop and an if, so we must be careful with the quotes.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write without escaping by using a raw string? But the problem doesn't specify.\n\n   We'll use the above.\n\n   However, the problem says: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, and our solution for program2 is O(n) per test case, and the total n is the total length of the strings, which is <= 10^5, so it's acceptable.\n\n   And for program1, the triple loop is 11^3 per test case, and t<=100, so 100*1331 = 133100, which is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, we output the JSON."
