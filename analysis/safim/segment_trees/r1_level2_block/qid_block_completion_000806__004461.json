But note: if they eat the entire array, then the left segment and the right segment together cover the entire array. The condition d[s] + (idx+1) = n is acceptable. So the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1)) But note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe. Now, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: For each test case, we are given n (>=4) and we must output four positive integers a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d). The provided code handles:\n- If n%4==0: then output (n//4, n//4, n//4, n//4). This works because gcd(n//4, n//4)=n//4 and lcm(n//4, n//4)=n//4. For the else branch, we have two cases: when n is odd (a%2==1) and when n is even (else). In the odd case:\n   a1 = n-1 (so we leave 1 for the last number). Then, if a1%3==0, we output (a1//3, a1//3, a1//3, 1). This works because gcd(a1//3, a1//3)=a1//3 and lcm(a1//3,1)=a1//3? Actually, lcm(a1//3,1)=a1//3. And the gcd is also a1//3. So it matches. Then, if a1%4==0, we output (a1//4, a1//2, a1//4, 1). Let's check: \n        gcd(a1//4, a1//2) = a1//4? Because a1//2 = 2*(a1//4) and gcd(a1//4, 2*(a1//4)) = a1//4 (if a1//4 is even? or odd? Actually, a1 is even? because n is odd -> a1 = n-1 is even. But a1%4==0, so a1 is divisible by 4. Then a1//4 is an integer. Then gcd(a1//4, a1//2) = gcd(a1//4, 2*(a1//4)) = a1//4 (if a1//4 is even, then 2*(a1//4) is divisible by a1//4?",

So the string for program1 is:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1) But note: the existing code in the same branch (a1%3==0) has:\n\n                print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1) So the indentation is the same. Therefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            if d[s] + (idx+1) < = n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code: we are using a1, which is defined as a1 = a-1 (where a is the input n).

Then we need a and b such that a+b = a1-2 and gcd(a,b)=2. We can set a=2, b=a1-4. Then gcd(2, a1-4): we require that gcd(2, a1-4)=2. This happens if a1-4 is even? and positive? a1-4 must be at least 2? because b must be positive? Actually, b = a1-4 must be at least 1? But we require gcd=2, so it must be even and at least 2? So a1-4 must be at least 2? -> a1>=6. For n=5: a1=4 -> then a1-4=0 -> not positive. So we cannot use c=2 for n=5. So for n=5, we must use c=1. But note: the condition a1%3 ! =0 and a1%4 ! =0: for n=5, a1=4 -> 4%3=1 ! =0, and 4%4==0 -> so we don't get to this branch. Actually, for n=5: \n        n is odd -> a1=4 -> then we check: 4%3 ! =0 -> then we check: 4%4==0 -> so we use the branch: \n            print(a1//4, a1//2, a1//4, 1) = (1, 2, 1, 1) -> which is the same as above. So the missing branch is only when a1%3 ! =0 and a1%4 ! =0? Actually, the code has:\n\n        if a1%3==0:\n            ... elif a1%4!=0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        elif a1%4==0:\n            ... So the missing branch is when a1%3 ! =0 and a1%4 ! =0. Then we need to output. We can do: \n        We set c=1, then we set a=1, b=a1-1-1 = a1-2, and d=1. Then the four numbers: 1, a1-2, 1, 1. But note: we have two 1's for c and d? Actually, we have a=1, b=a1-2, c=1, d=1. Then the sum: 1 + (a1-2) + 1 + 1 = a1+1 = n. \n        And gcd(1, a1-2)=1, and lcm(1,1)=1 -> works. But what if a1-2=1? Then we have (1,1,1,1) for n=4? But n=4 is handled by the first branch. So for the odd branch, n>=5? and a1>=4. Then a1-2>=2? for n=5: a1=4 -> a1-2=2 -> then (1,2,1,1) -> which is acceptable. But what if a1-2=0? Then we cannot. But a1 = n-1, and n>=5 -> a1>=4, so a1-2>=2. So we can output: \n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1) But note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and 1 and a1-2 are positive for a1>=4. Alternatively, we can set a=2, b=a1-3, c=1, d=1? Then gcd(2, a1-3)=1? We require that. But that is not always true.",

So when s=30 (from the right) we have idx=3 (because we've added 4 candies? but note: enumerate starts at 0). In the loop: \n    idx=0: i=1 -> s=1\n    idx=1: i=11 -> s=12\n    idx=2: i=8 -> s=20\n    idx=3: i=10 -> s=30 -> then we check: d[30]=3, and 3+ (3+1)=3+4=7 <=8 -> then r = max(0,7)=7. So it works.

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the left and right respectively, and they want the total weight eaten by each to be equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py does the following:\n1. Reads the number of test cases.\n2. For each test case:\n   a. Reads n (number of candies) and the list of weights.\n   b. Computes x = sum(a) // 2. This is half the total weight, so the maximum possible common weight they can have is at most x.\n   c. Then, it iterates from the left, accumulating the sum (s) and storing in a dictionary d the cumulative sum as key and the number of candies eaten (idx+1) as value. It breaks when the cumulative sum exceeds x (since beyond that, the common weight cannot be achieved because the total weight is fixed and we are only going to use sums that are at most half).\n   d. Then, it iterates from the right (a[::-1]), accumulating the sum (s). For each cumulative sum from the right, it checks if that sum is in the dictionary d (which contains cumulative sums from the left). If it is, then we have a candidate: the total candies eaten would be (d[s] from the left) + (idx+1 from the right). We want the maximum total candies (r) over such matches.\n\nHowever, the code after the second loop is incomplete. We need to update r to be the maximum of the current r and the total candies (d[s] + (idx+1)) whenever s is in d. Also note: we must avoid using the same candy? But note the problem says they eat from left and right and cannot eat the same candy. The way the problem is set up, the left part and right part are disjoint because we are matching the cumulative sums from the left and the cumulative sums from the right, and the entire array is fixed. However, we must ensure that the left and right segments do not overlap. The dictionary d was built for the entire left part until the cumulative sum exceeds half. Then when we traverse from the right, we are adding from the right. The indices in the left part are from 0 to d[s]-1, and the right part is from n-1 down to n - (idx+1). We must have that the left segment does not overlap with the right segment. That is, d[s] + (idx+1) must be <= n. However, note that the problem says that if they eat overlapping candies, that candy is only eaten by one? Actually, the problem states: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So the two segments must be disjoint.\n\nBut in the current approach, we are building the left cumulative without considering the right. How do we avoid overlap? The note in the problem: For the fourth test case, Alice eats [7,3,20] (which are the first, second, and fifth candy? because the example input is [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1]) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (the last four). So the left segment is the first three? Actually, the example says: Alice eats the first three from the left: [7,3,20] (which are the first, second, and third? but wait the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]). Then Bob eats from the right: [10,8,11,1] which are the last four. But note: the third candy (20) is the fifth? Actually, the example says: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7, 3, 20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10, 8, 11, 1]\". How are these disjoint? The array is [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]. The [7,3,20] are the first three, and [10,8,11,1] are the last four. The candy with weight 5 is in the middle and not eaten. So the left segment is contiguous from the left and the right segment is contiguous from the right, and they do not overlap.\n\nIn our code, when we build the dictionary from the left, we are storing the cumulative sum and the count (which is the number of candies from the left). Similarly, from the right, we are counting the number of candies from the right. The condition for non-overlap is that the left count + right count <= n. But note: if the entire array is eaten, then the middle candy (if any) is not eaten by either? Actually, the problem does not require that all candies are eaten. We are only concerned with the candies eaten by Alice and Bob.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten\" in the second test case. But in the fourth test case, they don't eat all. So we must ensure that the left segment and the right segment do not overlap. How? The left segment uses indices [0, d[s]-1] and the right segment uses [n - (idx+1), n-1]. The condition for non-overlap is: d[s] <= n - (idx+1). But note: the dictionary d was built for the entire left without considering the right. In the second loop, we are iterating from the right. We can check that the left count (d[s]) and the right count (idx+1) together do not exceed n? Actually, they might not necessarily be adjacent? But the problem does not require that the uneaten part is contiguous? Actually, the problem says: Alice eats from the left in a contiguous segment (starting at the left) and Bob from the right (starting at the right). So the uneaten part is in the middle. Therefore, the condition is that the left segment and the right segment must not meet: the last candy eaten by Alice must be to the left of the first candy eaten by Bob. That is: d[s] (the count from the left) must be at most n - (idx+1) (so that the next candy after the left segment is not eaten by Bob). But note: the right segment starts at the last candy and goes left for (idx+1) candies. So the first candy of the right segment is at index n-1, then n-2, ... until n - (idx+1). The last candy of the left segment is at index d[s]-1. We require d[s]-1 < n - (idx+1). That is, d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\nBut note: the problem does not require that the entire array is covered? They can leave some in the middle. So we must check that the two segments do not overlap. However, the way we are building the left and right cumulative sums independently, we are not enforcing that the segments are disjoint? Actually, the segments are disjoint by the way we are taking: left from the beginning and right from the end. The only issue is that we might count the same candy twice? But the left segment is from the left and the right segment is from the right, so they are disjoint as long as the left segment does not extend into the right segment. The condition is that the left count (L) and the right count (R) must satisfy L + R <= n. And that is automatically true because we are only storing the cumulative sums and the counts, and the entire array has n candies.\n\nBut note: the problem says that the same candy cannot be eaten by both. So we must ensure that the two segments do not overlap. The condition is: the left segment covers [0, L-1] and the right segment covers [n-R, n-1]. They do not overlap if L <= n-R. That is, L+R <= n.\n\nTherefore, when we find a common cumulative sum s from the left and the right, we must check that the total candies L+R does not exceed n? Actually, we are storing L = d[s] and R = idx+1. We must have d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. But note: the entire array is of size n, and we are taking from the two ends, so if d[s] + (idx+1) > n, then the segments overlap. Therefore, we should only consider when d[s] + (idx+1) <= n.\n\nSo the missing code in program1.py should be:\n    if s in d:\n        if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n            r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the problem says that they can also choose to eat zero candies? The problem states: \"they want to be fair\" meaning the total weight must be equal. The answer for the third test case is 0. So if we don't find any common sum, then r remains 0, which is correct.\n\nHowever, note that the dictionary d was built only for cumulative sums that are <= x (half the total). But the right cumulative might also exceed x? Actually, we break the left loop when s > x, but the right loop doesn't break? The right loop goes until the end? But note: the problem says the total weight of the left segment and the right segment must be equal. And the maximum possible common weight is at most half the total. So if the right cumulative sum s is greater than x, then we don't need to break because we are going to continue and we might find a smaller s? Actually, we are iterating from the right and adding one candy at a time. The cumulative sum from the right is increasing. But we are only interested in s that are in the dictionary d (which are <= x). So if s becomes greater than x, then we don't have that s in d (because d only has keys <= x) and we can break? Actually, we can break when s > x? But note: the dictionary d only has keys <= x, so if s > x, then we won't find it in d. And since the right cumulative sum is increasing, we can break early to save time? However, the constraints say that the total n over test cases is at most 200000, so it's acceptable to break early.\n\nBut the problem does not require that. We can also not break and just skip. However, the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can do without breaking. But the provided code does not break in the right loop. We can break when s > x? Actually, the left dictionary d only has keys up to x, so if s > x, then we won't get a match. And since the array elements are positive, s is increasing. So we can break when s > x? But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but the worst-case for the right loop is O(n) per test case, and the total n is 200000, so worst-case 200000*2 = 400000 operations? But the problem says the sum of n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe.\n\nBut the provided code does not break in the right loop. We can add a break condition? Actually, the problem does not require that, but it might be efficient. However, the problem does not require efficiency beyond the constraints, and the total n is 200000, so we can do without. But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we have at most one test case? Actually, the note: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\". So we can break when s > x? Actually, we can break the right loop when s > x because we won't get a match beyond that. But the provided code does not have that. We are only required to complete the missing part.\n\nSo the missing part in program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the variable idx in the right loop is from 0 to n-1 (because we are iterating over a[::-1]). The index in the reversed array: the first element in the reversed array is the last candy, so when we add one candy, we are at the last candy (1 candy from the right), then two, etc.\n\nBut note: the condition d[s] + (idx+1) <= n: d[s] is the number of candies from the left, and (idx+1) is the number from the right. The entire array has n candies, so the maximum they can eat is n. But if they eat the entire array, then the condition is d[s] + (idx+1) = n, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, what if the entire array is eaten? Then the left segment and the right segment must meet? Actually, if they eat the entire array, then the left segment and the right segment must cover the entire array without overlapping? But if the left segment is the first k candies and the right segment is the last n-k candies, then the condition is that the left segment ends at k-1 and the right segment starts at k? Then they are adjacent. The problem does not say they cannot be adjacent. They just cannot eat the same candy. So adjacent is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the condition is d[s] + (idx+1) <= n. But note: if they eat the entire array, then the left segment and the right segment together cover the entire array. The condition d[s] + (idx+1) = n is acceptable.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the problem says that the total n over test cases is 200000, so we are safe.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: For each test case, we are given n (>=4) and we must output four positive integers a, b, c, d such that a+b+c+d = n and gcd(a,b) = lcm(c,d).\n\nThe provided code handles:\n- If n%4==0: then output (n//4, n//4, n//4, n//4). This works because gcd(n//4, n//4)=n//4 and lcm(n//4, n//4)=n//4.\n\nFor the else branch, we have two cases: when n is odd (a%2==1) and when n is even (else).\n\nIn the odd case:\n   a1 = n-1 (so we leave 1 for the last number).\n   Then, if a1%3==0, we output (a1//3, a1//3, a1//3, 1). This works because gcd(a1//3, a1//3)=a1//3 and lcm(a1//3,1)=a1//3? Actually, lcm(a1//3,1)=a1//3. And the gcd is also a1//3. So it matches.\n\n   Then, if a1%4==0, we output (a1//4, a1//2, a1//4, 1). Let's check: \n        gcd(a1//4, a1//2) = a1//4? Because a1//2 = 2*(a1//4) and gcd(a1//4, 2*(a1//4)) = a1//4 (if a1//4 is even? or odd? Actually, a1 is even? because n is odd -> a1 = n-1 is even. But a1%4==0, so a1 is divisible by 4. Then a1//4 is an integer. Then gcd(a1//4, a1//2) = gcd(a1//4, 2*(a1//4)) = a1//4 (if a1//4 is even, then 2*(a1//4) is divisible by a1//4? Actually, the gcd of k and 2k is k. So yes. Then lcm(a1//4,1)=a1//4? Actually, lcm(c,d)=lcm(a1//4,1)=a1//4. So it matches.\n\n   But what if a1%3 !=0 and a1%4 !=0? The code has an elif a1%4!=0: and then we have to write code.\n\nIn the even case (else): \n   a1 = n-2 (leaving 2 for the last two numbers, which are 1 and 1). Then we output (a1//2-1, a1//2+1, 1, 1). \n   Why? \n        The sum: (a1//2-1) + (a1//2+1) + 1 + 1 = a1 + 2 = n.\n        Now, gcd(a1//2-1, a1//2+1): note that (a1//2-1) and (a1//2+1) are consecutive even numbers? Actually, they are two numbers that differ by 2. The gcd of two numbers that differ by 2: \n            Let x = a1//2, then we have x-1 and x+1. The gcd(x-1, x+1) = gcd(x-1, (x+1) - (x-1)) = gcd(x-1, 2). \n        And lcm(1,1)=1. \n        So we require that gcd(x-1, x+1) = 1. But that is not always true. For example, if x is even, then x-1 and x+1 are odd, and the gcd might be 1? But if x is odd, then x-1 and x+1 are even? Actually, a1 = n-2, and n is even, so a1 is even. Then x = a1//2 is an integer. But a1 is even, so x is an integer. However, x might be even or odd? \n\n        Example: n=6 -> even, then a1=4, then x=2, then we output (2-1, 2+1, 1,1) = (1,3,1,1). Then gcd(1,3)=1, and lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n        Example: n=8 -> even? but n=8 is divisible by 4, so we use the first branch. So we don't get here.\n\n        Example: n=10 -> even? but 10%4 !=0 -> so we go to the else branch. Then a1=10-2=8, x=4, then output (4-1,4+1,1,1) = (3,5,1,1). Then gcd(3,5)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n        Example: n=14 -> even, not divisible by 4. Then a1=12, x=6, then output (5,7,1,1). gcd(5,7)=1 -> works.\n\n        But what if we have n=12? 12%4==0 -> so we use the first branch.\n\n        So the even branch seems to work.\n\nNow, the problem is the odd branch when a1%3 !=0 and a1%4 !=0. We need to output four positive integers.\n\nWe have a1 = n-1 (so we are leaving 1 for the last number). We need to split a1 into three numbers a, b, c and then d=1. But we require that gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,1)=c.\n\nSo we require gcd(a,b)=c. And a+b+c = a1.\n\nWe can choose a and b arbitrarily? We can set c to be a divisor of a1? \n\nNote: the example test cases:\n\nExample: n=7 -> odd, then a1=6. \n   The code: 6%3==0 -> so we output (2,2,2,1). \n   But what if n=9? \n        n=9: odd, then a1=8. \n        8%3 !=0 -> so we go to the next condition: 8%4==0 -> then we output (8//4, 8//2, 8//4, 1) = (2,4,2,1). \n        Check: gcd(2,4)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\nExample: n=11: odd, a1=10. \n        10%3 !=0 -> so we go to the next condition: 10%4 !=0? 10%4=2 -> so we are in the elif a1%4!=0: branch.\n\nWe need to output for n=11: a+b+c+1=11 -> a+b+c=10.\n\nWe require gcd(a,b)=lcm(c,1)=c.\n\nWe can choose c to be a divisor of 10? and then set a and b such that a+b = 10-c and gcd(a,b)=c.\n\nWe can try c=1: then a+b=9. We need gcd(a,b)=1. We can choose a=2, b=7 -> gcd(2,7)=1 -> works. So output (2,7,1,1). But note: the example test case n=10: the fifth test case: \n        \"In the fifth test case gcd(3,5)=lcm(1,1)=1, 3+5+1+1=10\". \n        So for n=10, they output (3,5,1,1). \n\nBut our n=11: we can output (2,7,1,1) -> but then the gcd(2,7)=1 and lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nBut what if we have a1=10 (for n=11) and we try c=2? then a+b=8 and gcd(a,b)=2. We can choose a=2, b=6 -> then gcd(2,6)=2 -> works. So output (2,6,2,1). Then the numbers: 2+6+2+1=11, and gcd(2,6)=2, lcm(2,1)=2 -> works.\n\nBut which one to choose? The problem says we can output any.\n\nWe can also choose c=5: then a+b=5, and gcd(a,b)=5. Then we can choose a=5, b=0 -> but b must be positive. So we cannot. Or a=1, b=4 -> gcd(1,4)=1 !=5. So not.\n\nSo we can choose c=1 or c=2.\n\nBut note: we must have positive integers. So a,b,c,d>0.\n\nWe can set c=1, then we need two positive integers a and b such that a+b=9 and gcd(a,b)=1. We can choose a=1, b=8 -> gcd(1,8)=1 -> works. But then we have two 1's? That's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem does not require distinct numbers.\n\nAlternatively, we can set c=2, then a+b=8 and gcd(a,b)=2. We can choose a=2, b=6 -> then we have (2,6,2,1). \n\nBut note: the example for n=9 used (2,4,2,1) which is similar.\n\nSo the code for the missing part in program2.py for the odd case when a1%3 !=0 and a1%4 !=0:\n\nWe can choose c=1, then we need a and b such that a+b = a1-1 and gcd(a,b)=1. We can set a=1 and b=a1-2? Then gcd(1, a1-2)=1. But then we have two 1's? Actually, we have a=1, b=a1-2, c=1, d=1. Then the numbers are 1, a1-2, 1, 1. The sum: 1 + (a1-2) + 1 + 1 = a1+1 = n? But a1 = n-1, so 1 + (n-3) + 1 + 1 = n-3+3 = n. And gcd(1, n-3)=1, and lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nBut what if a1-2=1? then we have a=1, b=1 -> then we have (1,1,1,1) for n=1+1+1+1=4? But n=4 is handled by the first branch. So for n>=5? Actually, n>=4 and odd: the smallest odd n is 5? Then a1=4, then we set a=1, b=4-2=2 -> then (1,2,1,1) for n=5? \n        Check: 1+2+1+1=5, gcd(1,2)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nBut we can also choose other values. However, the problem says we can output any.\n\nAlternatively, we can set c=2. Then we need a and b such that a+b = a1-2 and gcd(a,b)=2. We can set a=2, b=a1-4. Then gcd(2, a1-4): we require that gcd(2, a1-4)=2. This happens if a1-4 is even? and positive? \n        a1-4 must be at least 2? because b must be positive? Actually, b = a1-4 must be at least 1? But we require gcd=2, so it must be even and at least 2? \n        So a1-4 must be at least 2? -> a1>=6. \n        For n=5: a1=4 -> then a1-4=0 -> not positive. So we cannot use c=2 for n=5.\n\nSo for n=5, we must use c=1.\n\nBut note: the condition a1%3 !=0 and a1%4 !=0: for n=5, a1=4 -> 4%3=1 !=0, and 4%4==0 -> so we don't get to this branch. Actually, for n=5: \n        n is odd -> a1=4 -> then we check: 4%3 !=0 -> then we check: 4%4==0 -> so we use the branch: \n            print(a1//4, a1//2, a1//4, 1) = (1, 2, 1, 1) -> which is the same as above.\n\nSo the missing branch is only when a1%3 !=0 and a1%4 !=0? Actually, the code has:\n\n        if a1%3==0:\n            ...\n        elif a1%4!=0:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n        elif a1%4==0:\n            ...\n\nSo the missing branch is when a1%3 !=0 and a1%4 !=0. Then we need to output.\n\nWe can do: \n        We set c=1, then we set a=1, b=a1-1-1 = a1-2, and d=1. Then the four numbers: 1, a1-2, 1, 1. \n        But note: we have two 1's for c and d? Actually, we have a=1, b=a1-2, c=1, d=1. \n        Then the sum: 1 + (a1-2) + 1 + 1 = a1+1 = n. \n        And gcd(1, a1-2)=1, and lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\nBut what if a1-2=1? Then we have (1,1,1,1) for n=4? But n=4 is handled by the first branch. So for the odd branch, n>=5? and a1>=4. Then a1-2>=2? for n=5: a1=4 -> a1-2=2 -> then (1,2,1,1) -> which is acceptable.\n\nBut what if a1-2=0? Then we cannot. But a1 = n-1, and n>=5 -> a1>=4, so a1-2>=2.\n\nSo we can output: \n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\nBut note: the problem says \"positive integers\", and 1 and a1-2 are positive for a1>=4.\n\nAlternatively, we can set a=2, b=a1-3, c=1, d=1? Then gcd(2, a1-3)=1? We require that. But that is not always true. For example, if a1-3 is even, then gcd(2, even) is at least 2. So we cannot.\n\nSo the safe way is to set a=1, b=a1-2, c=1, d=1.\n\nBut note: the example for n=10: they used (3,5,1,1) which is different. But that was in the even branch? Actually, n=10 is even, so we don't get here.\n\nSo for the missing part in program2.py:\n\n        elif a1%4!=0:\n            print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\nBut wait: what if a1-2 is negative? It cannot be because a1 = n-1, and n>=4 -> a1>=3. Then a1-2>=1? for n=4: we don't get here because n=4 is divisible by 4. For n=5: a1=4 -> 4-2=2 -> positive.\n\nBut note: the condition: we are in the odd branch (n is odd) and a1%3 !=0 and a1%4 !=0. The smallest n that falls here: \n        n=7: a1=6 -> 6%3==0 -> skip.\n        n=9: a1=8 -> 8%4==0 -> skip.\n        n=11: a1=10 -> 10%3=1, 10%4=2 -> so we get here. Then we output (1, 10-2, 1, 1) = (1,8,1,1). \n        Check: gcd(1,8)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n        n=13: a1=12 -> 12%3=0 -> skip.\n        n=15: a1=14 -> 14%3=2, 14%4=2 -> so we output (1,12,1,1). \n        Check: gcd(1,12)=1, lcm(1,1)=1 -> works.\n\n        n=17: a1=16 -> 16%3=1, 16%4=0 -> skip.\n\n        n=19: a1=18 -> 18%3=0 -> skip.\n\n        n=21: a1=20 -> 20%3=2, 20%4=0 -> skip.\n\n        n=23: a1=22 -> 22%3=1, 22%4=2 -> output (1,20,1,1) -> works.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"It is possible to show that the answer always exists\", so we are safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\nBut note: the code has an indentation. The missing part is in the block:\n\n        if a%2==1:\n            a1=(a-1)\n            if a1%3==0:\n                print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n            elif a1%4!=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                print(a1//4,a1//2,a1//4,1)\n\nBut note: the code already has the elif a1%4==0: branch. So we just fill the elif a1%4!=0: branch.\n\nNow, we output the missing code in the required JSON format.\n\nNote: We must output only the missing code, not the entire program.\n\nFor program1.py: the missing code is a block of code (multiple lines). We must output it as a string that can be placed exactly in the TODO part.\n\nSimilarly for program2.py.\n\nSo:\n\nprogram1: \n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the original code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" at the end of the line. We replace that with the above block. But the existing line is:\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the entire comment and the condition? Actually, we are replacing the comment with the code. But the condition is already written. We only need to write the body of the if statement.\n\nSo the missing code for program1.py is the body of the if statement that starts at the next line. We must write:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the existing line \"if s in d:\" is already there. So we are only adding the inner if and the assignment.\n\nBut the code must be properly indented. The existing code has:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nWe are replacing the TODO comment with the inner block. So the code becomes:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: \n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the for loop must have a body. The current for loop has the line \"s += i\" and then the if statement. We are adding two more lines (with proper indentation) inside the if.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the variable idx in the for loop: the enumerate starts at 0. The candy count from the right is idx+1.\n\nFor program2.py: the missing code is:\n\n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\nBut note: the existing code has:\n\n            elif a1%4!=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe replace the comment with the print statement. So the missing code is:\n\n        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\nBut note: the variable a1 is defined as a1 = a-1 (where a is the input n). So we use a1.\n\nNow, we output the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"        print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code must be indented properly. The existing code has 8 spaces for the inner block? Actually, the existing code:\n\n    else:\n        if a%2==1:\n            a1=(a-1)\n            if a1%3==0:\n                print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n            elif a1%4!=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                print(a1//4,a1//2,a1//4,1)\n\nThe missing code is in the elif block. The current indentation for the inner if-elif is 12 spaces? Actually, the code uses 4 spaces per indent. The structure:\n\nfor ...:\n    if ...:\n        ...\n    else:\n        if ...:\n            ... (indent level 8)\n            if ...: (indent level 12)\n            elif ...: (indent level 12)\n                ... (indent level 16)\n\nBut the print statement in the other branches is at 16 spaces. So we should output 16 spaces? Actually, the existing print statements in the same level are indented by 16 spaces. So the missing code for program2.py should be:\n\n                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\nBut the code we are replacing is:\n\n            elif a1%4!=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with the print statement. The comment is at the same level as the condition (which is 12 spaces). The print statement should be indented by 4 more spaces? So 16 spaces.\n\nBut the existing code in the same branch for the even case (the else branch) has:\n\n        else:\n            a1=a-2\n            print(a1//2-1,a1//2+1,1,1)\n\nThat print is at 12 spaces? Actually, the else branch is at the same level as the if branch (if a%2==1). The else branch is:\n\n        else:\n            a1=a-2\n            print(a1//2-1,a1//2+1,1,1)\n\nSo the print is at 12 spaces (because the else is at 8, then the next line is 12). \n\nBut in the if branch (if a%2==1) we have:\n\n            if a1%3==0:\n                print(...)   [this print is at 16 spaces?]\n\nActually, the code:\n\n    else:\n        if a%2==1:\n            a1=(a-1)\n            if a1%3==0:\n                print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n            elif a1%4!=0:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n            elif a1%4==0:\n                print(a1//4,a1//2,a1//4,1)\n\nThe prints are at 16 spaces (because they are inside the inner if-elif). So the missing print should be at 16 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\nBut note: the existing code in the same branch for the condition a1%3==0 has:\n\n                print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n\nSo we use the same indentation.\n\nSo the JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program1 code has two lines. We use a newline character to separate.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the program1 code as a single string with a newline escape? But the problem says to output the code as it would appear.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Return json\".\n\nSo we write the string with the newline.\n\nLet me check the program1 code: the existing code has:\n\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n\nWe are replacing the comment with:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut note: the existing line \"if s in d:\" is already there. We are only adding the inner block. The inner block must be indented by 4 more spaces? The for loop body is already indented by 4 (relative to the for). The if statement is at the same level. Then the inner if should be indented by 4 more (so 8 in total). But the existing code in the for loop is:\n\n        s += i\n        if s in d: ...\n\nSo the inner block should be:\n\n        if s in d: \n            if ...:   [this is 8 spaces from the for loop level?]\n\nBut the entire program is:\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    a = [*map(int, input().split())]\n    x = sum(a) // 2\n    s, d = 0, {}\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a):\n        s += i\n        if s > x: break\n        d[s] = idx + 1\n    s, r = 0, 0\n    for idx, i in enumerate(a[::-1]):\n        s += i\n        if s in d: # TODO: Your code here\n    print(r)\n\nSo the for loop (the second one) is at 4 spaces. The body of the for loop is 8 spaces. The if statement is at 8 spaces. The inner block we are adding should be at 12 and 16 spaces.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py should be:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nBut the existing line \"if s in d:\" is at 8 spaces, and we are adding two lines: one at 12 and one at 16.\n\nSo the string for program1 is:\n\n            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\n\nSimilarly, for program2, the missing code is:\n\n                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\n\nBut note: the existing code in the same branch (a1%3==0) has:\n\n                print(a1//3,a1//3,a1//3,1)\n\nSo the indentation is the same.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON:\n\n{\n    \"program1\": \"            if d[s] + (idx+1) <= n:\\n                r = max(r, d[s] + (idx+1))\",\n    \"program2\": \"                print(1, a1-2, 1, 1)\"\n}\n\nBut note: the program2 code: we are using a1, which is defined as a1 = a-1 (where a is the input n). So it's correct.\n\nLet me test with the provided examples.\n\nExample for program1: the fourth test case: [7, 3, 20, 5, 10, 8, 11, 1] -> n=8, weights = [7,3,20,5,10,8,11,1]. The total sum is 65. Half is 32.5, but we use integer? Actually, the code uses x = sum(a)//2 = 65//2 = 32.\n\nThe left cumulative:\n  7 -> d[7]=1\n  7+3=10 -> d[10]=2\n  10+20=30 -> d[30]=3\n  30+5=35 -> break (because 35>32)\n\nThen from the right:\n  start with 1 -> s=1 -> not in d.\n  then 11 -> s=12 -> not in d.\n  then 8 -> s=20 -> not in d.\n  then 10 -> s=30 -> in d. Then left count = d[30]=3, right count=3 (because we've eaten 3 from the right). Then total=6. But the expected answer is 7? \n\nWait, the example says: \"the answer is 7\". How? They ate 7 candies: Alice ate [7,3,20] (3 candies) and Bob ate [10,8,11,1] (4 candies). The total weight is 30 for each.\n\nSo we should get 3+4=7.\n\nBut in our dictionary d, we have 30 at index 3 (meaning the first 3 candies). Then from the right, we have to get 30. We have:\n  from the right: \n      1 -> 1\n      1+11=12\n      1+11+8=20\n      1+11+8+10=30 -> that's 4 candies.\n\nSo when s=30 (from the right) we have idx=3 (because we've added 4 candies? but note: enumerate starts at 0). \n\nIn the loop: \n    idx=0: i=1 -> s=1\n    idx=1: i=11 -> s=12\n    idx=2: i=8 -> s=20\n    idx=3: i=10 -> s=30 -> then we check: d[30]=3, and 3+ (3+1)=3+4=7 <=8 -> then r = max(0,7)=7.\n\nSo it works.\n\nBut note: the index in the right loop: the variable idx in enumerate(a[::-1]) is the index in the reversed array. The first element (1) is at index0, then 11 at index1, then 8 at index2, then 10 at index3. So when we have 4 candies, idx=3. Then the count is idx+1=4.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nNow, output the JSON."
