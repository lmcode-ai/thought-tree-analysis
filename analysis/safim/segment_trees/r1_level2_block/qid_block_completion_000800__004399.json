But that might be what we want? But in the symmetric example: \n   After we break the tie by adding from the left, we then in the same iteration also add from the right? But that would be incorrect? because we break the tie to avoid infinite loop, but then we immediately add from the right? \n\nBut note: we broke the tie because we had s1==s2 and we added from the left to make s1>s2. Then we want to add from the right to try to balance? But that is the algorithm: we are moving the pointers until we get a balance? But the problem: we are in the same iteration? Example: Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we break the tie: add left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we check: s1>s2 -> then we do the next condition: if s2 < s1 -> true -> then we add from the right: s2=1, p2=4 -> then we have s1==s2 again? but we are in the same iteration? But the code: \n   if s1==s2: \n        ...   # we break the tie: s1 becomes 1, p1=1 -> then we exit that if. then we check: if s1 < s2? -> 1<0? false. then we check: if s2 < s1? -> 0<1 -> true -> then we add from the right: s2=1, p2=4. Then the iteration ends? Then next iteration: \n        condition: p1-1=0<=p2=4 -> true. then we check: s1==s2? 1==1 -> candidate=1 (from Alice: index0) + 1 (from Bob: index5) = 2 -> then we break the tie: add left: s1=1+l[1]=? So it is the same as before? But we are doing two moves in one iteration? That is not intended? But the problem: the algorithm must be efficient? and the total n is 200000. But the inner loop: we are doing at most 3 condition checks per iteration?",

If we broke the tie and then s1>s2, then the next condition (s1<s2) fails, and the next (s2<s1) is true -> then we add from the right? But that might be what we want? because we want to balance? But in the symmetric example, that is what we did: we broke the tie and then we added from the right in the same iteration? But that led to the next candidate? So we don't need the continue? But the problem: if we break the tie and then we add from the right, we might overshoot? But the algorithm is designed to do: \n   while (condition)\n        if equal: record, then break tie by adding left. then if s1 < s2: add left\n        then if s2 < s1: add right But if we break the tie and then we add from the right, we are doing two moves? But that is acceptable? But the example: [1,1] \n   iteration1: \n        s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> break tie: add left: s1=1, p1=1. then check: s1>s2 -> so we add right: s2=1, p2=0. then condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n   iteration2: \n        s1=1, s2=1 -> record candidate: p1=1, p2=0 -> total=1 (Alice: index0) + (n-1-0)= (2-1-0)=1 -> total=2. then break tie: p1=1<=0? false -> break. then print 2. Correct. So we don't need the continue. But what if we break the tie and then we cannot add from the right because p2 is already at the left of p1? But we break the tie only if p1<=p2. Then we set p1 to p1+1. Then we check the next conditions: \n   if s1 < s2: ... if s2 < s1: ... If we broke the tie and then p1 becomes p1+1, and then p1>p2, then the condition for the while loop: p1-1<=p2? p1-1 = p1_old -> which was <= p2? and we set p1 = p1_old+1 -> then p1-1 = p1_old <= p2? so the condition holds? But then we do the next conditions: \n   if s1 < s2: ... if s2 < s1: ...

Then we try to add from the right? but p2 is at p2_old? and we do: \n   s2 += l[p2_old] \n   p2_old -= 1 -> becomes p2_old-1. But if p2_old was already the last one? But the condition: we broke the tie only if p1_old<=p2_old. Then we set p1 = p1_old+1. Then we have p1_old+1 and p2_old. Then we do the next condition: \n   if s2 < s1: \n        s2 += l[p2_old] \n        p2_old -= 1 -> p2 = p2_old-1. Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1 = p1_old <= p2_old-1? But we had p1_old<=p2_old -> then p1_old <= p2_old-1? not necessarily? Example: p1_old = 3, p2_old=3 -> we break the tie: p1 becomes 4, then we do the next condition: s2 < s1 -> true -> then we set p2 = 3-1=2. Then condition: p1-1=3<=2 -> true -> then we continue. So it is safe. Therefore, the missing code for program1.py:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2)) if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000. We must be efficient. But the break: if we break, we break the while loop. Then we don't do the next two conditions? But if we break, we break the loop. But if we break the tie and then p1>p2, we break? But the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> if p1>p2, then p1-1 might be <= p2? only if p1-1<=p2. Example: p1=3, p2=2 -> then p1-1=2<=2 -> true -> we enter the loop. Then we break the tie: we try to add from the left? but p1=3 and p2=2 -> p1<=p2? false -> so we break the loop? But then we break the loop and the next two conditions are skipped? But we are in the loop body. We break the loop? But the break statement breaks the while loop. But we are in the if block. So the code:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2)) if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break   # breaks the while loop\n\n   then the next two if conditions? But if we break, we break the while loop. But if we don't break, we update and then the next two conditions run. This is acceptable. But what if we break the tie and then we don't break, but then the next two conditions run?",

So the second test case must be: \n   n=6, and the array: [1,2,3,4,5,6]? How can they eat 6? Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6\n        Bob: [6,5,4] -> 15 -> not equal.

Example: [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> \n        Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6\n        Bob: [1,2,3] -> 6 -> total=6. So the array is symmetric? So in our algorithm: [1,2,3,3,2,1]\n   Steps:\n        s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we break the tie: add left: s1=1, p1=1. s1=1, s2=0 -> add right: s2=1, p2=4 -> candidate: p1=1, p2=4 -> total=1 (Alice: index0) + 1 (Bob: index5) = 2 -> then break the tie: add left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2. s1=3, s2=1 -> add right: s2=1+2=3, p2=3 -> candidate: p1=2 (Alice: indices0,1) and p2=3 (Bob: indices5,4) -> total=2+2=4 -> then break the tie: add left: s1=3+3=6, p1=3. s1=6, s2=3 -> add right: s2=3+3=6, p2=2 -> candidate: p1=3 (Alice: indices0,1,2) and p2=2 (Bob: indices5,4,3) -> total=3+3=6 -> then break the tie: add left? p1=3 -> we try to add at index3? but p1=3 is beyond the current p1? and the condition: p1-1=2<=p2=2 -> true -> then we do: s1==s2? 6==6 -> candidate=6 -> then we break the tie: add left? but p1=3 is at the end? we cannot because p1=3 (which is the next index) and n=6 -> index3 is valid? So we add l[3]=3 -> s1=9, p1=4 -> then condition: p1-1=3<=p2=2 -> false? so we break. Then we print l2[-1] = 6. So the last candidate is 6, which is the maximum. Therefore, the algorithm:",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends to achieve equal total weights and maximize the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code for program1.py has a while loop and some variables. The note says that the answer is stored in l2 and we print l2[-1]. However, the current code does not update l2 appropriately.\n\nWe note that the problem can be solved by using two pointers. We start with:\n  s1 = 0 (Alice's current sum)\n  s2 = 0 (Bob's current sum)\n  p1 = 0 (left pointer)\n  p2 = n-1 (right pointer)\n\nWe traverse from both ends. The idea is:\n  If s1 == s2, then we record the total number of candies eaten (which is p1 + (n-1-p2)) and then we try to add from the left (because we want to maximize the count, but note that we can also consider moving both? However, the condition says we can only add from the left if s1 is less than s2, and vice versa).\n\nBut note: the problem says we want the maximum total number of candies. So when s1 == s2, we record the current total candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) and then we try to add from the left (because we have to eventually break the equality to see if we can get more). However, the provided code does:\n\n  if s1 == s2: \n      ...   # we must do something here\n\nBut the code currently does nothing in that branch. We should record the current total candies and then we have two choices? Actually, the algorithm in the note does:\n\n  while (p1-1<=p2):   # note: condition is written as (p1-1<=p2) but that seems off. It should be p1<=p2? \n\nBut let me read the condition: \"while (p1-1<=p2)\" -> that would be equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. But note that p1 and p2 are indices. We are going to move until p1 passes p2.\n\nActually, the condition in the while loop is written as (p1-1<=p2). Let me test with n=1: \n   p1=0, p2=0 -> condition: -1<=0 -> true. Then we check s1==s2? yes. Then we do ... then we break because we don't update? Actually, we have to update in the s1==s2 branch? \n\nBut the problem says: we can only add from the left if s1 < s2, and from the right if s2 < s1. So when they are equal, we have to break the tie? We can choose to add from the left? But note: we want to maximize the total number of candies. However, the problem does not require that we have to stop when they are equal? Actually, we can continue because we might get a larger total by eating more candies? But wait: if we are at s1==s2, we have a candidate. Then we can try to add one more candy from the left and then see if we can get back to equality? \n\nBut note: the problem says they eat in a row from their ends. So we can simulate:\n\n  We start with both having 0. Then we can add from the left until we exceed? or we can add from the right? Actually, the algorithm in the note does:\n\n      if s1 == s2: \n          ...   # we record the current total? \n          then we add from the left? but the next two if conditions will not run because s1==s2 and we don't have an else. So we break? \n\nBut that would be an infinite loop. Therefore, we must update in the s1==s2 branch. The note in the problem says: \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". \n\nHow do we simulate that? \n\nWe can do: when s1==s2, we record the total number of candies (p1 + (n-1-p2)) and then we try to add one from the left? because we want to see if we can get a larger total? But note: we are allowed to have multiple segments? Actually, no: they eat in a row. So we have to extend from the left until we break the equality? \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n  if s1 == s2:\n      candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten p1 candies (from index0 to p1-1) and Bob has eaten from p2+1 to n-1 -> that's (n-1-p2) candies.\n      l2.append(candidate)   # we record candidate\n      # Then we add from the left? Why? Because we want to try to extend? But note: we are going to continue the loop. We can break the tie arbitrarily? \n      # Actually, we can add from the left to break the tie? Then we continue. But we must break the tie to avoid infinite loop.\n      s1 += l[p1]\n      p1 += 1\n\nBut wait: what if we have two zeros? Then we keep adding? But the problem says: we want the maximum total. However, we are going to record every time we have equality. Then at the end we take the last recorded candidate? But note: the problem says \"the most number of candies\", so we want the maximum candidate.\n\nBut the code prints l2[-1]. So we are only interested in the last candidate? Actually, we want the maximum candidate. However, the algorithm might record multiple candidates. But note: as we move the pointers, the total number of candies is increasing? Not necessarily: because we are moving the pointers independently. Actually, the total candies is p1 + (n-1-p2). As we move p1 to the right or p2 to the left, the total increases? Actually, when we add from the left, p1 increases -> total increases. When we add from the right, p2 decreases -> total increases. So the last candidate we record might not be the maximum? \n\nBut note: we are going to traverse until the pointers cross. And we record every time we have equality. Then we want the maximum candidate? However, the code prints l2[-1]. So we must record every candidate and then at the end we take the maximum? But the problem says: \"print the maximum number of candies\". \n\nBut the code prints l2[-1]. That would be the last candidate we recorded. However, the last candidate might not be the maximum. For example, in the second test case: \n   n=3, l = [1,2,1]\n   We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate: 0 (but we haven't eaten any) -> then we break the tie by adding from the left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then s1>s2 -> we add from the right: s2=1, p2=1 -> then s1==s2: candidate = 1 (from Alice) + 1 (from Bob) = 2. Then we break the tie again: add from the left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2 -> then p1-1=1<=p2=1 -> true -> then s1>s2 -> we try to add from the right: but p2 is 1, we subtract to 0 -> then condition: p1-1=1<=0? false -> break. Then we print l2[-1] which is 2. But the answer for the second test case is 6? Wait, no: the second test case in the note is:\n\n   \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\nBut wait, the second test case in the note is the fourth test case? The note has four test cases. The second test case in the input example is the one with n=3? Actually, the problem says:\n\n   \"For the first test case\" -> answer=2\n   \"For the second test case\" -> answer=6\n   \"For the third test case\" -> answer=0\n   \"For the fourth test case\" -> answer=7\n\nBut the example input? The problem does not give the input for the second test case? But the note says: \"The first test case\" has n=2? Actually, the problem says: the first test case: n=2? \n\nLooking at the provided example: \n   First test case: n=2? and weights? [1,1] -> then Alice eats one from left (1) and Bob eats one from right (1) -> total=2.\n\n   Second test case: n=3? but the note says: Alice eats the first three from the left? so n must be 6? Actually, the note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\" -> so the array must be of length 6? \n\nBut the input says: the second line of the test case contains n integers. So the second test case: n=6? and the array is [7,3,20,5,10,8]? or something? Actually, the note says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (which sums to 30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1]? that's 4 candies? but the note says the answer is 6? \n\nWait, the note says: \"the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total)\". So Alice ate 3 and Bob ate 3? but the array has 7 candies? Actually, the fourth test case: n=7? \n\nThe note says: \n   First test case: 2\n   Second test case: 6\n   Third test case: 0\n   Fourth test case: 7\n\nSo the second test case: n=6? \n\nBut the code we are writing must work for the examples.\n\nSo what is the algorithm? \n\nWe have two pointers. We start at the ends. We maintain two sums: s1 (left) and s2 (right). \nWe traverse until the pointers cross (p1<=p2) but the condition is written as (p1-1<=p2). Actually, that condition is equivalent to p1 <= p2+1. This allows p1 to go one beyond p2? \n\nWe do:\n   while p1-1 <= p2:   # meaning we can still have at least one candy to eat? \n\n   Then inside:\n        if s1 == s2:\n            candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)   # because Alice has eaten from index0 to p1-1 -> that's p1 candies, Bob has eaten from p2+1 to n-1 -> that's n-1-p2 candies.\n            l2.append(candidate)\n            # Then we break the tie by adding from the left? Why? Because if we don't break the tie, we get stuck. But note: we might have the possibility to add from the left and then later get back to equality? \n            # So we add from the left? \n            # But what if we cannot add from the left? because p1 is already beyond p2? Actually, the condition allows p1 to be at most p2+1? \n            # So we do:\n            if p1 <= p2:   # we can add from the left? \n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break   # but the condition of the while loop will break anyway? \n        elif s1 < s2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:   # s2 < s1\n            s2 += l[p2]\n            p2 -= 1\n\nBut wait: what if we break the tie arbitrarily? It might be that we should break the tie by adding from the right? But the problem does not specify. However, we want to maximize the total. \n\nBut note: we are going to record every time we have equality. Then at the end, we take the maximum candidate? But the code prints l2[-1]. So we must change that? \n\nAlternatively, we can record the candidate and then break the tie arbitrarily? and then at the end we take the maximum candidate? \n\nBut the problem says: the total of the test cases can be up to 200000. We cannot store every candidate and then take max? because we are in a while loop per test case. But note: the while loop runs at most n steps. And the total n over test cases is 200000. So we can store the candidate and then at the end take the maximum? \n\nBut the code currently prints l2[-1]. We can change the code to print max(l2) if l2 is not empty? But the problem says: if no candy is eaten, then 0. So we must consider that.\n\nBut the problem says: for the third test case, answer=0. So we must record 0? \n\nHow do we start? Initially, s1==s2=0 -> we record candidate=0. Then we break the tie by adding from the left? Then we continue. But then we might never get back to equality? \n\nSo we should record the candidate at every equality. Then after the loop, we take the maximum candidate? \n\nBut the code currently prints l2[-1]. We can change the last line to print(max(l2))? \n\nBut the problem says: we cannot change the provided code arbitrarily? We are only to fill in the missing lines. \n\nLooking at the provided code:\n\n    l2=[]\n    s1,s2=0,0\n    p1,p2=0,n-1\n    while (p1-1<=p2):\n        if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n        if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n        if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n    print(l2[-1])\n\nWe cannot change the print statement. So we must store the candidate in l2 only when we have equality? and then at the end we want the last candidate? But the last candidate might not be the maximum? \n\nBut note: the total number of candies is increasing as we move the pointers? Actually, the total candies eaten is p1 + (n-1-p2). As we move p1 to the right, p1 increases. As we move p2 to the left, (n-1-p2) increases. So the total is increasing. Therefore, the last candidate we record is the maximum? \n\nWhy? Because we start at 0, then we record 0. Then we break the tie and then we move the pointers. Then we might get a candidate at a later time. And since the total is increasing, the last candidate we record is the maximum. \n\nBut is that true? Consider: \n   We have an array: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n   We start: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we break the tie: add left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then s1>s2 -> we add from the right: s2=1, p2=4 -> then s1==s2: candidate= 1 (from Alice) + 1 (from Bob) = 2 -> then we break the tie: add left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2 -> then s1>s2 -> add right: s2=1+1=2, p2=3 -> then s1>s2? 3>2 -> add right: s2=2+1=3, p2=2 -> now p1=2, p2=2 -> condition: p1-1=1<=2 -> true -> then s1==s2? 3==3 -> candidate= 2 (Alice: indices0,1) + 3 (Bob: indices3,4,5) -> total=5? \n   Then we break the tie: add left? but p1=2, which is at index2 -> we add l[2]=1 -> s1=4, p1=3 -> then condition: p1-1=2<=p2=2 -> true -> then s1=4, s2=3 -> so we add from the right? but p2 is 2, we cannot add because we are at the same index? Actually, we have p1=3 and p2=2 -> condition: 3-1=2<=2 -> true -> then we do: s1>s2 -> we try to add from the right? but p2 is 2, we have already taken the candy at index2? \n\nActually, we are moving the pointers: \n   Initially: p1=0, p2=5 -> [0,1,2,3,4,5]\n   Step1: s1==0 -> record 0 -> then we add left: p1 becomes 1, s1=1.\n   Step2: s1>s2? no, s1=1, s2=0 -> so we do the second if: s1< s2? no. Then the third if: s2< s1 -> yes: so we add the right: p2=4, s2=1.\n   Step3: s1==s2? record candidate: p1=1, p2=4 -> total=1 (from Alice: index0) + 1 (from Bob: index5) -> 2.\n          then we break the tie: add left: p1=2, s1=1+2=3.\n   Step4: s1=3, s2=1 -> we do the third if: s2< s1 -> add right: p2=3, s2=1+1=2.\n   Step5: s1=3, s2=2 -> add right: p2=2, s2=2+1=3.\n   Step6: s1==s2? 3==3 -> candidate: p1=2 (so Alice has eaten 2 candies: indices0,1) and p2=2 (so Bob has eaten 3 candies: indices3,4,5) -> total=2+3=5.\n          then break the tie: add left: p1=3, s1=3+1=4.\n   Step7: condition: p1-1=2<=p2=2 -> true -> then we check: s1=4, s2=3 -> then we do the third if: s2< s1 -> add right? but p2 is 2, we have already taken the candy at index2? Actually, we are at p1=3 and p2=2. We cannot add from the right because we have already taken the candy at index2? \n\nBut the array has 6 elements: indices0..5. Bob has taken indices5,4,3, and then 2? So at step6, Bob has taken indices5,4,3,2? Then at step7, we try to add from the right: but p2 is 2, we do p2-=1 -> p2=1. But wait, we are at p2=2, we subtract to 1? Then we have taken index2? \n\nBut the condition: we are in the loop: p1-1=2<=p2=2 -> true -> then we do the if s1==s2? no -> then if s1< s2? 4<3? no -> then if s2< s1? 3<4 -> yes: then we do s2+=l[2] -> but l[2] is the third element? which is 1? and then p2 becomes 1. \n\nThen condition: p1-1=2<=1 -> false? so we break. \n\nSo the last candidate we recorded is 5. But the maximum candidate we had was 5? and we also had 0 and 2. So we want 5? and we print l2[-1] which is 5. \n\nBut is 5 the answer? \n   Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [1,1,1] (3) -> total 5 candies? but wait: the candies are: \n        index0:1, index1:2, index2:1, index3:1, index4:1, index5:1.\n   Alice ate index0 and 1 -> [1,2] -> sum=3.\n   Bob ate index5,4,3,2? -> [1,1,1,1] -> sum=4? \n\nWait, no: Bob starts from the right: \n   First: index5 -> 1\n   Then index4 -> 1 -> total=2\n   Then index3 -> 1 -> total=3 -> then we break? \n\nBut in step5: we added index2? so Bob ate index5,4,3, and 2? that's 4 candies? \n\nBut the problem: they cannot eat the same candy. And the candy at index2 is in the middle. \n\nSo the segments: \n   Alice: [0,1] -> indices0 and 1.\n   Bob: [2,3,4,5] -> indices2,3,4,5? \n\nBut that is not contiguous from the right? Bob eats from the right: so he must eat the last candy (index5) first, then the next is index4, then index3, then index2. \n\nBut then the candy at index2 is eaten by Bob? and Alice did not eat it? \n\nBut the condition: they cannot eat the same candy. \n\nSo the total candies: 2 (Alice) + 4 (Bob) = 6? \n\nBut we recorded candidate=5? \n\nWhat went wrong? \n\nThe candidate we record is: \n   candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n\nAt step6: \n   p1=2 -> meaning Alice has eaten 2 candies (indices0 and 1) -> so p1=2 (next available is index2).\n   p2=2 -> meaning Bob has eaten from the right: indices5,4,3 -> 3 candies? and the next available for Bob is index2? \n   Then the total candies eaten: \n        Alice: 2\n        Bob: 3\n        total=5? \n\nBut wait, we have not eaten the candy at index2? \n\nSo the formula: \n   Alice has eaten from index0 to p1-1 -> that's p1 candies? \n   Bob has eaten from p2+1 to n-1 -> that's (n-1 - p2) candies? \n\nAt step6: \n   p1=2 -> so Alice has eaten indices0 and 1 -> 2 candies.\n   p2=2 -> so Bob has eaten indices3,4,5? because we start from the right: we have moved p2 from 5 to 4 to 3 to 2? meaning we have eaten the candies at positions 5,4,3? -> 3 candies.\n\nBut the candy at index2 is not eaten by anyone? \n\nSo the total candies eaten is 2+3=5. \n\nBut the problem: they can only eat contiguous segments from the ends? and they cannot skip? So they cannot leave a gap? \n\nBut note: the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\". But they are allowed to leave candies in the middle? \n\nSo the answer 5 is correct? \n\nBut the example: [1,2,1,1,1,1] -> we can have Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [1,1,1] (the last three) -> that's 5 candies? and the middle 1 is left? \n\nBut the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\" -> so 5 is the maximum? \n\nBut wait, we can also have: \n   Alice: [1,2,1] (4) and Bob: [1,1,1] (3) -> but 4+3=7? but then the sums: 4 vs 3 -> not equal? \n\nOr: \n   Alice: [1,2,1] (4) and Bob: [1,1] (2) -> not equal.\n\nOr: \n   Alice: [1] (1) and Bob: [1] (1) -> total=2.\n\nOr: \n   Alice: [1,2] (3) and Bob: [1,1,1] (3) -> total=5.\n\nSo 5 is the maximum? \n\nBut the note says: for the second test case the answer is 6? \n\nSo what is the second test case? \n   The note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\"\n\nSo the array must be: [7,3,20,5,10,8]? \n   Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n   Bob: [10,8,?] -> but the note says Bob eats the first three from the right: [8,10,5]? but that would be 8+10+5=23? \n\nWait, the note says: \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" -> meaning the last three: [5,10,8]? that sums to 23? not 30.\n\nAlternatively, the array might be: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] for the fourth test case? \n   Then Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n   Bob: [1,11,8,10] -> 1+11+8+10=30 -> that's 4 candies? total=7? \n\nBut the note says the answer for the fourth test case is 7? \n\nSo the second test case must be: \n   n=6, and the array: [1,2,3,4,5,6]? \n   How can they eat 6? \n        Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6\n        Bob: [6,5,4] -> 15 -> not equal.\n\n   Or: \n        Alice: [1,2,3,4] -> 10\n        Bob: [6,5] -> 11 -> not equal.\n\n   Or: \n        Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6\n        Bob: [6] -> 6 -> total=4? \n\n   Or: \n        Alice: [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> 21, Bob: nothing -> not equal.\n\n   Or: \n        Alice: [1,3] -> 4, Bob: [6,5,4] -> 15 -> not equal.\n\n   The note says: \"the first three from the left\" and \"the first three from the right\" -> so the array must be symmetric? \n\n   Example: [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> \n        Alice: [1,2,3] -> 6\n        Bob: [1,2,3] -> 6 -> total=6.\n\nSo the array is symmetric? \n\nSo in our algorithm: \n   [1,2,3,3,2,1]\n   Steps:\n        s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we break the tie: add left: s1=1, p1=1.\n        s1=1, s2=0 -> add right: s2=1, p2=4 -> candidate: p1=1, p2=4 -> total=1 (Alice: index0) + 1 (Bob: index5) = 2 -> then break the tie: add left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2.\n        s1=3, s2=1 -> add right: s2=1+2=3, p2=3 -> candidate: p1=2 (Alice: indices0,1) and p2=3 (Bob: indices5,4) -> total=2+2=4 -> then break the tie: add left: s1=3+3=6, p1=3.\n        s1=6, s2=3 -> add right: s2=3+3=6, p2=2 -> candidate: p1=3 (Alice: indices0,1,2) and p2=2 (Bob: indices5,4,3) -> total=3+3=6 -> then break the tie: add left? p1=3 -> we try to add at index3? but p1=3 is beyond the current p1? and the condition: p1-1=2<=p2=2 -> true -> then we do: s1==s2? 6==6 -> candidate=6 -> then we break the tie: add left? but p1=3 is at the end? we cannot because p1=3 (which is the next index) and n=6 -> index3 is valid? \n        So we add l[3]=3 -> s1=9, p1=4 -> then condition: p1-1=3<=p2=2 -> false? so we break.\n\n        Then we print l2[-1] = 6.\n\nSo the last candidate is 6, which is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm: \n   We record every time we have equality. And because the total is increasing, the last candidate is the maximum.\n\nBut what if we have an array that never gets back to equality after the last candidate? \n   Example: [1,1,1,1,1,1] -> symmetric? \n        Steps:\n          s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then add left: s1=1, p1=1.\n          s1=1, s2=0 -> add right: s2=1, p2=4 -> candidate=2 -> then break tie: add left: s1=2, p1=2.\n          s1=2, s2=1 -> add right: s2=2, p2=3 -> candidate=4 -> then break tie: add left: s1=3, p1=3.\n          s1=3, s2=2 -> add right: s2=3, p2=2 -> candidate=6 -> then break tie: add left: s1=4, p1=4 -> condition: p1-1=3<=p2=2 -> true -> then s1=4, s2=3 -> add right: but p2=2, we add l[2]=1 -> s2=4, p2=1 -> condition: p1-1=3<=1 -> false -> break.\n          Then we print 6.\n\n   But the last candidate is 6? and that is the maximum.\n\nSo we can do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        candidate = p1 + (n-1-p2)\n        l2.append(candidate)\n        # Then we break the tie by adding from the left? \n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            # if we cannot add, then we break? but the condition will break anyway? \n            # we break the loop? but we can let the condition break? \n            # Actually, we break the tie to avoid infinite loop. But if we cannot add from the left, we break? \n            # But note: we are in the while loop condition: p1-1<=p2 -> if p1>p2, then we break? \n            # So we can just do the update only if p1<=p2? \n            pass   # we don't do anything? but then we get stuck? \n   else:\n        ... # the other conditions\n\nBut the code has two more if conditions after the s1==s2? \n\nActually, the code after the s1==s2 branch has:\n   if s1 < s2: ... \n   if s2 < s1: ...\n\nSo if we break the tie by adding from the left, then we set s1 and p1, and then we check the next two conditions? \n\nBut if we break the tie by adding from the left, then s1 becomes larger? and then we will fall into the s2 < s1 condition? \n\nBut what if we break the tie and then p1 becomes greater than p2? Then the next two conditions might not run? \n\nBut the condition of the while loop: we break if p1-1>p2? \n\nSo the plan for the missing code in program1.py:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        # Then we break the tie by adding from the left? But note: we must ensure we don't go out of bounds? \n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            # if we are already at p1>p2, then we break? but the condition will break? \n            # But we must break the tie to avoid infinite loop? \n            # Actually, we can break the loop? but the condition will break? \n            # We do nothing? then the next two conditions will not run? and we will be stuck? \n            # So we break? \n            break   # but the condition of the while loop will break? \n   # But note: the next two conditions are independent ifs. \n\nBut if we break the tie by adding from the left, then we set s1 and p1, and then we skip the other conditions? \n\nBut the next two conditions are ifs, not elif. So if we break the tie and then s1 becomes greater than s2, then the next condition (if s1 < s2) fails, but the next (if s2 < s1) will run? \n\nBut if we break the tie and then p1 is now beyond p2? then we try to add from the left? but we are not allowed? \n\nActually, we break the tie only if p1<=p2. \n\nBut what if we break the tie and then p1 becomes p1+1, and then p1>p2? Then the next two conditions: \n   if s1 < s2: ... -> false\n   if s2 < s1: ... -> true -> then we try to add from the right: but p2 is still the same? and we do s2 += l[p2] and p2-=1. But if p2 is already less than p1? \n\nBut the condition: we break the tie only if p1<=p2. Then we set p1 = p1+1. Then we have p1 = p1_old+1. Then we check: \n   if s1 < s2: ... \n   if s2 < s1: ... \n\nBut if we broke the tie, then we added one candy from the left. Then we have to check the conditions again? \n\nBut the problem: we are in the same iteration? \n\nActually, the code structure:\n\n   while ...:\n        if s1==s2: \n            ...   # we do the candidate and then break the tie (if possible) by adding one from the left.\n        if s1 < s2:   # this is a separate if\n            ... \n        if s2 < s1:   # this is a separate if\n\nSo if we broke the tie and then s1 becomes greater than s2, then the next if (s1 < s2) fails, but the next (s2 < s1) will run? and we add from the right? \n\nBut that might be what we want? \n\nBut in the symmetric example: \n   After we break the tie by adding from the left, we then in the same iteration also add from the right? \n\nBut that would be incorrect? because we break the tie to avoid infinite loop, but then we immediately add from the right? \n\nBut note: we broke the tie because we had s1==s2 and we added from the left to make s1>s2. Then we want to add from the right to try to balance? \n\nBut that is the algorithm: we are moving the pointers until we get a balance? \n\nBut the problem: we are in the same iteration? \n\nExample: \n   Start: s1=0, s2=0 -> candidate=0 -> then we break the tie: add left: s1=1, p1=1 -> then we check: s1>s2 -> then we do the next condition: if s2 < s1 -> true -> then we add from the right: s2=1, p2=4 -> then we have s1==s2 again? but we are in the same iteration? \n\nBut the code: \n   if s1==s2: \n        ...   # we break the tie: s1 becomes 1, p1=1 -> then we exit that if.\n   then we check: if s1 < s2? -> 1<0? false.\n   then we check: if s2 < s1? -> 0<1 -> true -> then we add from the right: s2=1, p2=4.\n\n   Then the iteration ends? \n\n   Then next iteration: \n        condition: p1-1=0<=p2=4 -> true.\n        then we check: s1==s2? 1==1 -> candidate=1 (from Alice: index0) + 1 (from Bob: index5) = 2 -> then we break the tie: add left: s1=1+l[1]=? \n\nSo it is the same as before? \n\nBut we are doing two moves in one iteration? \n\nThat is not intended? \n\nBut the problem: the algorithm must be efficient? and the total n is 200000. \n\nBut the inner loop: we are doing at most 3 condition checks per iteration? and we move at least one pointer per iteration? so it is O(n). \n\nBut the logic: \n   We break the tie by adding one from the left. Then we immediately add one from the right? \n\nBut that is what we did in the symmetric example? \n\nBut in the symmetric example, we did: \n   iteration1: \n        s1==0 -> candidate0 -> break tie: add left -> s1=1, p1=1.\n        then check: s1>s2 -> so we add right: s2=1, p2=4.\n   iteration2: \n        s1==1, s2==1 -> candidate2 -> break tie: add left: s1=1+2=3, p1=2.\n        then check: s1>s2 -> so we add right: s2=1+2=3, p2=3.\n   iteration3:\n        s1==3, s2==3 -> candidate4 -> break tie: add left: s1=3+3=6, p1=3.\n        then check: s1>s2 -> so we add right: s2=3+3=6, p2=2.\n   iteration4:\n        s1==6, s2==6 -> candidate6 -> break tie: add left: s1=6+l[3] -> but l[3] is the fourth element? which is 3? -> s1=9, p1=4.\n        then check: s1>s2 -> so we add right: but p2=2 -> we add l[2]=3 -> s2=9, p2=1.\n   iteration5: condition: p1-1=3<=1 -> false -> break.\n\n   Then we print candidate6? \n\nBut the last candidate we recorded is 6? \n\nBut the total candies eaten at candidate6: \n   Alice: p1=3 -> indices0,1,2 -> 3 candies.\n   Bob: p2=2 -> Bob has eaten from the right: indices5,4,3 -> 3 candies? \n   But wait: at iteration3, we broke the tie by adding left: so we set p1=3 (meaning we have taken index0,1,2) and then we added the right: we set p2=2? meaning we have taken index5,4,3? \n\n   Then the candy at index3 is taken by Bob? and the candy at index2 is taken by Alice? \n\n   Then the middle? none? \n\n   Then total=6.\n\nBut the next iteration: we break the tie and then we take index3 (by Alice) and index2 (by Bob)? but that would be the same candy? \n\nWait: the array: \n   index0:1, index1:2, index2:3, index3:3, index4:2, index5:1.\n\n   At iteration3: \n        Alice: indices0,1,2 -> [1,2,3] -> sum=6.\n        Bob: indices5,4,3 -> [1,2,3] -> sum=6.\n\n   Then we break the tie: we take index3 (which is the next for Alice) -> but index3 is already taken by Bob? \n\nBut in the code: \n   After we record candidate6, we break the tie: \n        if p1<=p2: -> p1=3, p2=2 -> false? so we don't break the tie? \n\n   Then we move to the next conditions: \n        if s1 < s2? 6<6? false.\n        if s2 < s1? false.\n\n   Then the iteration ends? \n\n   Then next iteration: condition: p1-1=2<=p2=2 -> true -> then we check: s1==s2? true -> candidate: p1=3, p2=2 -> total=3 (Alice) + (n-1-p2)= (6-1-2)=3 -> total=6? same as before? \n\n   Then we break the tie: p1=3<=p2=2 -> false -> then we do nothing? \n\n   Then we check the next conditions: \n        s1==s2 -> we skip the first if? \n        then if s1 < s2? false.\n        if s2 < s1? false.\n\n   Then we are stuck? \n\nSo we must break the tie only if we can? and if we break the tie, we update s1 and p1, and then we do not do the other conditions? \n\nBut the code has the other conditions as separate ifs. \n\nWe can change the structure? but we are only allowed to fill the missing part. \n\nAlternatively, we can do:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            # we break the loop? \n            break\n        continue   # then we skip the next two conditions? \n\nBut the problem: we are not allowed to change the structure arbitrarily? \n\nBut the problem says: \"missing lines or blocks\". We are allowed to fill the missing block. \n\nThe missing block is only the body of the if s1==s2. \n\nSo we can write:\n\n        if s1 == s2:\n            l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n            if p1 <= p2:\n                s1 += l[p1]\n                p1 += 1\n            else:\n                break   # to avoid infinite loop? \n            continue   # skip the next two if conditions? \n\nBut the problem: the next two if conditions are after this block. \n\nBut if we break, we break the loop. If we continue, we skip the next two if conditions and go to the next iteration. \n\nBut what if we don't break and don't continue? Then we do the next two if conditions? which might be incorrect? \n\nBut if we break the tie and then we have s1>s2, then we don't want to add from the right? because we just broke the tie? \n\nBut the algorithm: we break the tie by adding from the left, and then we want to continue the loop? but we don't want to add from the right in the same iteration? \n\nBut the next two conditions: \n   if s1 < s2: ... \n   if s2 < s1: ... \n\nIf we broke the tie and then s1>s2, then the next condition (s1<s2) fails, and the next (s2<s1) is true -> then we add from the right? \n\nBut that might be what we want? because we want to balance? \n\nBut in the symmetric example, that is what we did: we broke the tie and then we added from the right in the same iteration? \n\nBut that led to the next candidate? \n\nSo we don't need the continue? \n\nBut the problem: if we break the tie and then we add from the right, we might overshoot? \n\nBut the algorithm is designed to do: \n   while (condition)\n        if equal: record, then break tie by adding left.\n        then if s1 < s2: add left\n        then if s2 < s1: add right\n\nBut if we break the tie and then we add from the right, we are doing two moves? \n\nBut that is acceptable? \n\nBut the example: \n   [1,1] \n   iteration1: \n        s1=0, s2=0 -> record 0 -> break tie: add left: s1=1, p1=1.\n        then check: s1>s2 -> so we add right: s2=1, p2=0.\n        then condition: p1-1=0<=0 -> true.\n   iteration2: \n        s1=1, s2=1 -> record candidate: p1=1, p2=0 -> total=1 (Alice: index0) + (n-1-0)= (2-1-0)=1 -> total=2.\n        then break tie: p1=1<=0? false -> break.\n        then print 2.\n\n   Correct.\n\nSo we don't need the continue. \n\nBut what if we break the tie and then we cannot add from the right because p2 is already at the left of p1? \n\nBut we break the tie only if p1<=p2. Then we set p1 to p1+1. Then we check the next conditions: \n   if s1 < s2: ... \n   if s2 < s1: ... \n\nIf we broke the tie and then p1 becomes p1+1, and then p1>p2, then the condition for the while loop: p1-1<=p2? \n   p1-1 = p1_old -> which was <= p2? and we set p1 = p1_old+1 -> then p1-1 = p1_old <= p2? so the condition holds? \n\nBut then we do the next conditions: \n   if s1 < s2: ... \n   if s2 < s1: ... \n\nBut if we broke the tie and then p1>p2, then we cannot add from the left? but we don't have to because we are in the s1>s2 condition? and we try to add from the right? but p2 might be already at the left of p1? \n\nBut we broke the tie: we added from the left at index p1_old, which was the last available for Alice? and then we set p1 = p1_old+1. Then we try to add from the right? but p2 is at p2_old? and we do: \n   s2 += l[p2_old] \n   p2_old -= 1 -> becomes p2_old-1.\n\nBut if p2_old was already the last one? \n\nBut the condition: we broke the tie only if p1_old<=p2_old. Then we set p1 = p1_old+1. Then we have p1_old+1 and p2_old. Then we do the next condition: \n   if s2 < s1: \n        s2 += l[p2_old] \n        p2_old -= 1 -> p2 = p2_old-1.\n\n   Then the next iteration: condition: p1-1 = p1_old <= p2_old-1? \n\n   But we had p1_old<=p2_old -> then p1_old <= p2_old-1? not necessarily? \n\n   Example: p1_old = 3, p2_old=3 -> we break the tie: p1 becomes 4, then we do the next condition: s2 < s1 -> true -> then we set p2 = 3-1=2. \n   Then condition: p1-1=3<=2 -> true -> then we continue.\n\nSo it is safe.\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1.py:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break\n\nBut note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000. We must be efficient. \n\nBut the break: if we break, we break the while loop. Then we don't do the next two conditions? \n\nBut if we break, we break the loop. \n\nBut if we break the tie and then p1>p2, we break? \n\nBut the condition of the while loop: p1-1<=p2 -> if p1>p2, then p1-1 might be <= p2? only if p1-1<=p2. \n\nExample: p1=3, p2=2 -> then p1-1=2<=2 -> true -> we enter the loop. Then we break the tie: we try to add from the left? but p1=3 and p2=2 -> p1<=p2? false -> so we break the loop? \n\nBut then we break the loop and the next two conditions are skipped? \n\nBut we are in the loop body. We break the loop? \n\nBut the break statement breaks the while loop. \n\nBut we are in the if block. \n\nSo the code:\n\n   if s1 == s2:\n        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n        if p1 <= p2:\n            s1 += l[p1]\n            p1 += 1\n        else:\n            break   # breaks the while loop\n\n   then the next two if conditions? \n\nBut if we break, we break the while loop. \n\nBut if we don't break, we update and then the next two conditions run. \n\nThis is acceptable.\n\nBut what if we break the tie and then we don't break, but then the next two conditions run? \n\nWe already discussed: it is acceptable.\n\nNow, for program2.py:\n\nThe problem: infecting a tree in minimal seconds. \n\nThe provided code:\n\n   t = int(stdin.readline())\n   for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(stdin.readline())\n        parents = [int(x) for x in stdin.readline().split()]\n        counts = defaultdict(int)\n        counts[0] = 1\n        for i in parents:\n            counts[i] += 1\n\n        lives = [counts[i] for i in counts]\n        lives.sort(reverse=True)\n\n        for i in range(len(lives)):\n            lives[i] -= len(lives)-i\n\n        answer = len(lives)\n\n        while max(lives) > 0:\n            current_max = -1\n            max_index = -1\n            for i in range(len(lives)):\n                lives[i] -= 1\n                if lives[i] > current_max:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n            lives[max_index] -= 1\n            answer += 1\n\n        stdout.write(\"{}\\n\".format(answer))\n\nThe idea:\n\n   We are counting the number of children for each node? \n\n   The problem: \n        Initially, we can infect the root by injection at second 0? \n        Then at each second: \n            Spreading: for each node that has at least one child infected, we can infect one more child (if available) of our choice.\n            Injection: we can infect any one healthy node.\n\n        We want the minimal seconds to infect the whole tree.\n\n   The note: the image is not provided, but the process is described.\n\n   We note that the root is infected at time 0. Then at each second, we can do:\n        - First, spreading: we can choose one child per node that has at least one infected child to infect one more child (if available). \n        - Then, injection: we choose one healthy node to infect.\n\n   How to compute the minimal time?\n\n   We can use a greedy / simulation. \n\n   The provided code:\n\n        counts: we count the frequency of each parent? \n        Then lives = list of counts (for each node that has children? but note: the root is included? and we set counts[0]=1? but the root has no parent? \n\n        Actually, the input: the second line has n-1 integers: p2, p3, ... pn: the parent of vertex i (for i from 2 to n).\n\n        Then we count: \n            counts[0] = 1 -> the root? \n            for each parent i in the list, we do counts[i] += 1.\n\n        So counts[i] is the number of children of node i? \n\n        Then we form a list \"lives\" of these counts? \n\n        Then we sort in descending order.\n\n        Then we do: \n            for i in range(len(lives)):\n                lives[i] -= (len(lives)-i)\n\n        Then answer = len(lives)\n\n        Then while max(lives)>0:\n            We do: \n                current_max = -1\n                max_index = -1\n                for i in range(len(lives)):\n                    lives[i] -= 1\n                    if lives[i] > current_max:\n                         ...   # we set current_max and max_index? \n\n                Then we do: lives[max_index] -= 1\n                Then answer += 1\n\n   What is the meaning of \"lives\"? \n\n   The idea from known solutions: \n\n        We start by having the root infected at time 0.\n\n        The spreading operation: at each second, for each node that has at least one child already infected, we can choose one more child to infect (if available). This is like a multi-source BFS? \n\n        But note: we can choose the order.\n\n        Known solution: \n            Let deg[i] = number of children of node i? \n            Then we consider the nodes that have at least one child? \n\n            We start with the root. Then we have an array of the children counts for each node? \n\n            The process: \n                At time 0: the root is infected.\n\n                Then at time 1: \n                    Spreading: we can spread from the root to one child? \n                    Injection: we can inject one node? \n\n                So at time 1, we have two infected nodes: the root and one child? or the root and one arbitrary node? \n\n            Actually, the injection can be any node. \n\n        Alternate known solution (from known problems like this): \n            We consider the children counts of the nodes. For the root, we have deg[root] children. For other nodes, we have deg[node] - 1 (because one of the children is the parent? but wait, the tree is rooted, so the children count is the outdegree? \n\n            Actually, the counts we computed: counts[i] is the number of children of node i? \n\n            Then we do:\n\n                Let a = sorted(counts.values(), reverse=True)\n                Then we start with time = 0, and we have a queue of events? \n\n            But the provided code does:\n\n                lives = sorted(counts.values(), reverse=True)   # but note: we have counts for the root and all nodes that have children? \n\n                Then we do: \n                    for i in range(len(lives)):\n                        lives[i] = lives[i] - (len(lives) - i)   # subtract the number of seconds that we have already used? \n\n                Then we set answer = len(lives)   # which is the number of nodes that have children? \n\n                Then while max(lives)>0:\n                    ...   # we simulate additional seconds? \n\n            The while loop: \n                We subtract 1 from every life? \n                Then we find the index of the maximum life? \n                Then we subtract an additional 1 from that maximum life? \n                Then we add one second.\n\n            Why? \n\n            Explanation: \n                The initial answer = len(lives) is the base time? \n\n                Then we have an array \"lives\" that represents the remaining work? \n\n                The operation: each second, we can reduce one from every life (which corresponds to the spreading operation: one child per node per second) and then we can do one extra reduction (which corresponds to the injection operation? we can choose one life to reduce by an extra one?).\n\n                But note: the injection operation: we can infect any healthy node. How does that help? \n\n                Actually, if we inject a node, then that node can start spreading? \n\n                The known solution for the problem \"D. Infection\" or similar? \n\n            However, the provided code does:\n\n                while max(lives) > 0:\n                    current_max = -1\n                    max_index = -1\n                    for i in range(len(lives)):\n                        lives[i] -= 1\n                        if lives[i] > current_max:\n                            current_max = lives[i]\n                            max_index = i\n\n                    lives[max_index] -= 1\n                    answer += 1\n\n            This is inefficient: the total n over test cases is 200000, but the lives list length is at most 200000? and the while loop runs until max(lives)<=0, and in each iteration we do a full scan of lives? and the values in lives can be large? \n\n            But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000. But the lives list per test case: the length is the number of distinct nodes that have children? which is at most 200000? and the while loop: the number of iterations is the maximum value in lives? which can be 200000? and then the inner loop is 200000? so worst-case 200000*200000 = 40e9 -> too slow.\n\n            So we must optimize? \n\n            But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases is 200000. But the lives list is built from the counts of children. The total number of nodes is n, and the sum of n over test cases is 200000? so the total number of nodes is 200000? \n\n            But the lives list for one test case can be up to 200000? and the while loop might run up to 200000 iterations? and the inner loop 200000? so worst-case 200000*200000 = 40e9 for one test case? which is too slow.\n\n            Therefore, the provided code is not efficient? \n\n            But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000. So the total number of nodes in all test cases is 200000. \n\n            But the lives list for one test case: the length is the number of distinct nodes that have children? which is at most the number of nodes in that test case. And the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total length of all lives lists is 200000? \n\n            But the while loop: the number of iterations per test case is the value of the maximum life? which might be large? \n\n            We need a more efficient way. \n\n            However, the problem says: we are only to fill the missing code. \n\n            The missing code is inside the for loop in the while loop:\n\n                for i in range(len(lives)):\n                    lives[i] -= 1\n                    if lives[i] > current_max:\n                         ...   # we set current_max and max_index? \n\n            We are to set:\n\n                current_max = lives[i]   # but we are subtracting 1 above? \n                max_index = i\n\n            But note: we subtract 1 from every life first. Then we compare. \n\n            So:\n\n                for i in range(len(lives)):\n                    lives[i] -= 1\n                    if lives[i] > current_max:\n                         current_max = lives[i]\n                         max_index = i\n\n            Then after the for loop, we do: lives[max_index] -= 1.\n\n            This is the extra reduction for the injection? \n\n            But the problem: the values in lives are being reduced by one for every second (spreading) and then we choose the one with the maximum remaining work to do an extra reduction (injection).\n\n            This is a greedy: we always reduce the largest one by an extra one.\n\n            But the while loop runs until no life is positive? \n\n            However, the efficiency: the while loop runs at most O(max(lives)) iterations? and the inner loop is O(len(lives)). \n\n            The initial lives: the maximum value is the maximum children count? which can be 200000? and the length of lives is at most 200000? so worst-case 200000 * 200000 = 40e9 -> too slow for Python.\n\n            But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000. But the test cases: the sum of n is 200000, but the lives list per test case: the length is the number of distinct nodes that have children? and the maximum children count per node is at most 200000? \n\n            However, the total number of test cases t can be up to 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the maximum n per test case can be 200000? and the lives list for a test case with n=200000 might have up to 200000 elements? and the while loop might run up to 200000 iterations? so 200000*200000 = 40e9 iterations per test case? and we have up to 10000 test cases? but the sum of n is 200000, so the number of test cases is at most 200000? but the sum of n is 200000, so the number of test cases is at most 10000, but the sum of the sizes of the trees is 200000. So the largest test case might be 200000? but then the while loop would be 200000 iterations and the inner loop 200000 -> 40e9 which is too slow.\n\n            Therefore, we must optimize. But the problem says: we are only to fill the missing code. \n\n            But the problem also says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000. \n\n            However, the n in the test case is the number of vertices. The lives list has length = number of distinct nodes that have children? which is at most n. \n\n            But the while loop: the number of iterations is the maximum value in the lives array? which is the maximum children count? which can be n-1 (if the root has n-1 children). \n\n            And the inner loop is the length of lives? which is at most n. \n\n            So the total work per test case: O(n * max_children) = O(n^2). \n\n            And the sum of n over test cases is 200000, but the worst-case n for one test case is 200000, then the work is 200000^2 = 40e9 -> too slow.\n\n            So the provided algorithm is not efficient. \n\n            But the problem says: we are only to fill the missing code. \n\n            And the problem says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000. \n\n            But note: the sum of n over test cases is 200000, meaning the total number of vertices in all test cases is 200000. \n\n            Therefore, the largest test case has n=200000, and there is only one test case? because 200000 is the total. \n\n            But 40e9 operations is too slow in Python. \n\n            We need a more efficient method. \n\n            However, the problem says: we are only to fill the missing code. \n\n            So we fill the missing code as:\n\n                current_max = lives[i]\n                max_index = i\n\n            But then the while loop might be too slow? \n\n            But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases is 200000, but the n in the test case is the number of vertices. The lives array for one test case has length L (<=n). The while loop runs at most M iterations, where M is the maximum value in the initial lives array (after the subtraction). \n\n            The initial subtraction: \n                for i in range(len(lives)):\n                    lives[i] -= len(lives)-i\n\n            Then the maximum value in lives might be reduced. \n\n            But still, the worst-case might be large. \n\n            We must hope that the test cases are not worst-case? \n\n            Or there is a more efficient implementation? \n\n            Alternatively, we can use a heap? \n\n            But we are not allowed to change the structure. \n\n            So we output the missing code as:\n\n                current_max = lives[i]\n                max_index = i\n\n            But note: the variable current_max is set to lives[i] (after we subtracted 1) and then we update the current_max and max_index.\n\n            Then after the for loop, we do: lives[max_index] -= 1.\n\n            This is the extra reduction for the injection.\n\n            So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                current_max = lives[i]\n                max_index = i\n\n            But note: the for loop subtracts 1 from every life first. Then we compare. \n\n            We initialize: \n                current_max = -1\n                max_index = -1\n\n            Then for each i, we do:\n\n                lives[i] -= 1\n                if lives[i] > current_max:\n                    current_max = lives[i]\n                    max_index = i\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            However, the efficiency might be borderline? \n\n            But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but that is the total number of vertices. The lives array for one test case: the length is the number of distinct nodes that have children? which is at most the number of nodes. And the total number of nodes over test cases is 200000. \n\n            But the while loop: the number of iterations is the maximum value in the lives array after the initial subtraction? \n\n            The initial subtraction: \n                lives[i] = original_count - (L - i)   # where L = len(lives)\n\n            The maximum original_count is at most 200000? and L is at most 200000? so the maximum lives[i] after subtraction is at most 200000? \n\n            Then the while loop runs at most 200000 iterations per test case? and the inner loop is the length of lives? which is at most 200000? so the total work per test case is 200000 * 200000 = 40e9 -> too slow.\n\n            But the total number of test cases: the sum of n is 200000, so there is only one test case? \n\n            And 40e9 operations in Python is about 40 seconds? which is too slow.\n\n            Therefore, we must optimize. But the problem says: we are only to fill the missing code. \n\n            We are not allowed to change the structure. \n\n            But the problem says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000. \n\n            However, the n in the test case is the number of vertices. The lives array length L is at most n. And the total n over test cases is 200000, so the total work over test cases is the sum over test cases of (max_lives_after_initial * L). \n\n            But the worst-case for one test case: n=200000, L=200000, and max_lives_after_initial = 200000? then work=200000*200000=40e9.\n\n            And there is only one test case? \n\n            So we must hope that the maximum lives after the initial subtraction is small? \n\n            Or the intended solution is different? \n\n            But the problem says: we are only to fill the missing code. \n\n            So we output the missing code as above.\n\n            But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\"\n\n            For program1.py: \n                We fill: \n                    l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                    if p1 <= p2:\n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n\n            For program2.py: \n                We fill: \n                    current_max = lives[i]\n                    max_index = i\n\n            But note: the code in program2.py has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\" and then two lines below: \n                lives[max_index] -= 1\n\n            So the missing code is two lines: \n\n                current_max = lives[i]\n                max_index = i\n\n            But we must be careful: the variable names.\n\n            However, the code initializes:\n                current_max = -1\n                max_index = -1\n\n            Then in the for loop, we subtract 1 from lives[i], and then we compare.\n\n            So the code:\n\n                for i in range(len(lives)):\n                    lives[i] -= 1\n                    if lives[i] > current_max:\n                        current_max = lives[i]\n                        max_index = i\n\n            This is correct.\n\n            But note: the condition is \"if lives[i] > current_max\", and we update current_max to lives[i] and max_index to i.\n\n            So we output:\n\n                \"program1\": \"l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            break\",\n                \"program2\": \"current_max = lives[i]\\n            max_index = i\"\n\n            But we must be careful: the indentation.\n\n            For program1.py: the missing code is the body of the if s1==s2. The current code has:\n\n                if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace the TODO with:\n\n                l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                if p1 <= p2:\n                    s1 += l[p1]\n                    p1 += 1\n                else:\n                    break\n\n            For program2.py: the missing code is the body of the if lives[i] > current_max:\n\n                if lives[i] > current_max:\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n            We replace with:\n\n                current_max = lives[i]\n                max_index = i\n\n            But note: the next line is: \n\n                lives[max_index] -= 1\n\n            So the code for program2.py after filling:\n\n                for i in range(len(lives)):\n                    lives[i] -= 1\n                    if lives[i] > current_max:\n                        current_max = lives[i]\n                        max_index = i\n\n                lives[max_index] -= 1\n                answer += 1\n\n            This is the intended greedy.\n\n            We hope that the test cases are not worst-case? \n\n            But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, but that is the total number of vertices. The worst-case for the while loop might be 200000 seconds? and the inner loop 200000? so 40e9 for one test case. \n\n            But the total n over test cases is 200000, so there is only one test case? \n\n            And 40e9 operations in Python might be borderline in C++ but in Python it is too slow.\n\n            However, the problem says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000. \n\n            But note: the n in the test case is the number of vertices. The lives array length L is at most n. And the while loop iterations: the number of iterations is the maximum value in the lives array after the initial subtraction. \n\n            The initial subtraction: \n                for i in range(len(lives)):\n                    lives[i] -= len(lives)-i\n\n            This reduces the lives array. The maximum value after this subtraction is at most the maximum value before minus (0) for the first element? \n\n            Actually, the subtraction: \n                lives[0] = original_count0 - (L - 0)\n                lives[1] = original_count1 - (L - 1)\n                ...\n\n            The maximum original_count is at most 200000. And L is at most 200000. So the maximum lives[i] after subtraction is at most 200000? \n\n            But then the while loop runs at most 200000 iterations? and the inner loop is 200000? so 40e9.\n\n            We need a better method. \n\n            But the problem says: we are only to fill the missing code. \n\n            So we output as above.\n\n            Alternatively, we can use a heap to avoid the inner loop? but we are not allowed to change the structure. \n\n            Therefore, we output the missing code as described.\n\n            But note: the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that ... runs correctly.\"\n\n            And the problem says: the sum of n over test cases does not exceed 200000, but that is the total number of vertices. The worst-case for the lives array might be large, but the problem says the total n is 200000, so there is only one test case? and 200000 vertices? then the while loop might be 200000 iterations and the inner loop 200000 -> 40e9, which is too slow in Python.\n\n            But the problem constraints: the total n over test cases is 200000, and the sum of n is 200000, so the largest test case has n=200000. \n\n            And 40e9 operations in Python is not feasible.\n\n            However, known solutions in C++ for this problem use a greedy with a priority queue. \n\n            But the provided code uses a list and scans. \n\n            We must output the missing code as required.\n\n            We hope that the test cases are not worst-case? or the initial subtraction reduces the values enough? \n\n            Or the intended solution is different? \n\n            But we follow the instructions.\n\n            So the final answer:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\\n        if p1 <= p2:\\n            s1 += l[p1]\\n            p1 += 1\\n        else:\\n            break\", \n                \"program2\": \"current_max = lives[i]\\n            max_index = i\"\n            }\n\n            But note: the indentation in program1.py: the missing code is at the same indentation level as the if. \n\n            In program1.py, the if s1==s2: is at the same level as the while. The body of the if should be indented by 8 spaces? \n\n            But the existing code: \n\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    if s1 == s2: # TODO: Your code here\n                    if s1 < s2: s1+=l[p1]; p1+=1\n                    if s2 < s1: s2+=l[p2]; p2-=1\n\n            We replace the TODO line with:\n\n                    if s1 == s2:\n                        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                        if p1 <= p2:\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:\n                            break\n\n            But then we have two if conditions after? \n\n            Actually, we are replacing the entire if block? \n\n            The original code has:\n\n                if s1 == s2: \n                    # TODO\n\n            We are replacing the TODO with the block.\n\n            But the next two if conditions are separate. \n\n            So the code becomes:\n\n                while (p1-1<=p2):\n                    if s1 == s2: \n                        l2.append(p1 + (n-1-p2))\n                        if p1 <= p2:\n                            s1 += l[p1]\n                            p1 += 1\n                        else:\n                            break\n                    if s1 < s2: \n                        s1 += l[p1]\n                        p1 += 1\n                    if s2 < s1: \n                        s2 += l[p2]\n                        p2 -= 1\n\n            This is acceptable.\n\n            For program2.py, the missing code is two lines in the for loop.\n\n            We output the JSON."
