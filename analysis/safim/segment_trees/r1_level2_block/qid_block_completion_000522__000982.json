Actually, if (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) is divisible by a_i, then we need k_i at least (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) / a_i + 1? But note: the condition is strict. So if (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) = some multiple of a_i, then k_i must be at least that multiple + 1. So k_i_min = floor( (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) / a_i ) + 1 But then we have two choices for k_i: either take k_i_min or a larger value?",

Then:\n          b1 = -1 (by one move)\n          b2 = 0 (by default? but we didn't do anything) -> then we have b1=-1, b2=0 -> valid. b3 = 1 (by one move) -> then b2=0 < b3=1 -> valid.\n          b4 = 1 (by one move) -> then b3=1 and b4=1 -> not strictly increasing. So that doesn't work. The example final array: [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] -> so 5 elements. b0=-1, b1=0, b2=3, b3=4, b4=5. Moves:\n          b0: subtract a0: 1 move -> -1\n          b1: 0 moves -> 0? but then we need 0 to be greater than -1 -> it is. b2: add a2 three times: 3 moves -> 3\n          b3: add a3 once: 1 move? -> 1 -> then 3 and 1 -> not increasing. Alternatively, b3: add a3 four times: 4 moves -> 4? then total moves for b3 is 4? Then total moves: 1+0+3+4+? for b4: 5 moves? -> 1+3+4+5 = 13. The example says 4 moves. After re-read: the example says: \n        \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> one move on b1.\n        \"add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> one move on b3, one on b4, one on b5: total 4 moves. And the final array: \n            b1 = -1 (so b0? is not mentioned) -> but the array is given as [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] for indices 0..4. So if they did:\n            b0: not touched -> 0? b1: subtract a1 -> becomes -1? then we have [0, -1] -> not increasing.",

The variable t is the current b_{j+1} (the next element to the right, which we have already set). We require that b_j < b_{j+1}. But note: we are going backwards. So when we are at j (with value k), the next element to the right (j+1) has been set to t? We require: \n   b_j = d * k   (so we are setting k_j = d) and we require b_j < b_{j+1} = t. So we require: d * k < t.\n\nBut wait: the condition is the opposite: we require b_j < b_{j+1}. But we are going backwards: from j+1 to j. So we have already set b_{j+1} to t, and now we set b_j to d*k, and we require d*k < t. But the code does: d = ceil((t+1)/k) t = k * d   -> then we set the new t for the next (leftward) element. But note: the condition: d*k < t_old? But we set d = ceil((t_old+1)/k). Then:\n\n   d = ceil((t_old+1)/k) \n   => d >= (t_old+1)/k\n   => d*k >= t_old+1 > t_old\n\nSo we have d*k > t_old, which is the opposite of what we want. But we want b_j < b_{j+1} = t_old. So we are setting b_j = d*k, and we have d*k > t_old, which is b_j > b_{j+1} -> not increasing. This is backwards.",

However, the condition for the right part: \n        b_{i} < b_{i+1} \n        b_{i+1} < b_{i+2}\n\n   We can start with the first element to the right: \n        We require b_{i} < b_{i+1}  -> 0 < b_{i+1} = d * a_{i+1} for some integer d. The minimal |d| that satisfies d * a_{i+1} > 0 is d=1. Then for the next: \n        We require b_{i+1} = a_{i+1} < b_{i+2} = d_{i+2} * a_{i+2}\n\n        => d_{i+2} * a_{i+2} > a_{i+1}\n\n        => d_{i+2} > a_{i+1} / a_{i+2} So d_{i+2} = ceil( (a_{i+1}) / a_{i+2} ) + 1? not exactly, because we require >, so floor(a_{i+1}/a_{i+2])+1 might work, but if it is integer then we need at least a_{i+1}/a_{i+2} + 1.

But note: the minimal positive integer d that satisfies d*k > t is indeed ceil((t+1)/k) ? Example: t=0, k=2 -> ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> then d=1, and 1*2=2>0 -> valid. Example: t=2, k=2 -> ceil((2+1)/2)=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2, then 2*2=4>2 -> valid. But is there a smaller d? d=1: 1*2=2, which is not >2. So d=2 is minimal. Therefore, it is correct. However, note: the value of t for the next element is set to d*k, which is the value of b_{i+1}. Then for the next element, we require b_{i+2} > b_{i+1} = t. So the TODO for the right part is:\n\n        t = 0   # the value of the previous element (initially the i-th element, which is 0)\n        for k in a[i+1:]: d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += abs(d)   # or p += d? since d is positive? But note: d is ceil(...) which is at least 1, so positive. Therefore, p += d.\n\n   But wait: the left part used p += d without abs, and d was positive? In the left part: \n        for k in reversed(a[:i]): \n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n   And in the example for i=1 in n=2, we had d=1, so p=1. Therefore, for the right part, we should do the same: p += d.\n\n   But note: the right part might require negative d? We argued that for the right part, we must use positive d because we require b_{i+1} > 0",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are to compute for each query (x, y): the maximum total value of the y cheapest items that can be made free when purchasing at least x items.\n\nApproach for program1:\n1. We note that to maximize the free value, we want to have the highest possible cheap items for free. However, note that the free items are the y cheapest among the purchased items. Therefore, to maximize the free value, we want the purchased set to include as many high-priced items as possible, but note that the free items are the cheapest ones in the set. So we want to have a set of x items that has the largest possible y smallest items? Actually, we want the sum of the y smallest items in the set to be as large as possible.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"maximum total value of items received for free\". The free items are the y cheapest in the purchase. So to maximize the free value, we want the y cheapest items in the purchase to be as expensive as possible.\n\nHow to achieve that?\nWe can only choose a set of at least x items. Actually, we can choose exactly x items because if we choose more, then we are including even cheaper items which might become part of the free set? But note: the free set is the y cheapest. So if we choose more than x, then the free set might include even cheaper items? Actually, the problem says: \"if a customer purchases at least x items, then the y cheapest of them are free\". So we can choose any set of items of size at least x. However, note that we are free to choose the set arbitrarily (any subset of the items). Therefore, we want to choose a set S such that |S|>=x and the sum of the y smallest in S is maximized.\n\nBut note: we can also choose more than x items. However, if we choose more than x, then the set of free items is the y cheapest in the entire set. Since we are including more items, the y cheapest might become smaller? Therefore, it is always optimal to choose exactly x items. Why? Because if we choose more than x, then we are including additional items that are at most as expensive as the ones we already have. But note: we can skip some cheap items. Actually, we can avoid including very cheap items. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to choose exactly x items and skip the cheapest items that we don't want to be forced to include in the free set.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: \n  We are to choose exactly x items (or at least x, but we can choose exactly x) such that the sum of the y smallest items in that set is maximized.\n\nBut note: we can also choose more than x? Let me think: if we choose x+1 items, then the free set is the y cheapest in the x+1 items. The y cheapest in the x+1 items might be lower than the y cheapest in a set of x items that avoids the very cheap ones? So it might be worse. Therefore, we can assume that we choose exactly x items.\n\nHow to form the set? We want to maximize the sum of the y smallest items in the set. To maximize the sum of the smallest y, we want the smallest y items in the set to be as large as possible. Therefore, we can do:\n\n  We sort the prices in descending order. Then, we consider that the set we choose must include at least y items that are as large as possible? But note: the set we choose must have exactly x items. The free set is the y smallest in the set. So we want the entire set to have the smallest y items as large as possible.\n\nWe can do:\n  We choose the largest x items. Then the y smallest in that set are the last y of these x (which are the smallest in the set). Then the free value is the sum of the last y in the sorted (ascending) order of the chosen set? But note: we sorted in descending order. Actually, if we sort the entire array in descending order, then the chosen set is the first x. Then the free set is the last y in the chosen set (which are the smallest in the chosen set). But note: the last y in the chosen set (in descending order) are the smallest? Actually, if we have the array sorted in descending order: [v0, v1, ..., v_{x-1}], then the smallest y are the last y: v_{x-y} to v_{x-1}. So the free value is the sum of the segment [x-y, x-1] in the descending sorted array.\n\nBut wait: is that the maximum? Consider: we might avoid including some very cheap items that are not in the top x? Actually, we are forced to take the top x? Because if we skip one of the top x and take a cheaper one, then the free set (the y smallest) might become cheaper? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: we want the y smallest in the set to be as large as possible. Therefore, we want the entire set to have a \"floor\" as high as possible. The best we can do is to take the top x items. Then the y smallest in that set are the last y of the top x. \n\nBut note: what if we take the top x-1 and then skip one of the top x and take a more expensive one? We cannot because the top x are the most expensive. So the set of the top x items is the best set.\n\nTherefore, for a query (x, y):\n  We have the array sorted in descending order: let the array be d[0..n-1] (d[0] is the largest).\n  We choose the first x: d[0..x-1].\n  The free set is the last y of these x, i.e., d[x-y] to d[x-1]? Actually, in the descending order, the smallest in the set are the last ones. So the y smallest are d[x-y] ... d[x-1]? Actually, no: in descending order, the set is [d0, d1, ..., d_{x-1}]. The smallest element is d_{x-1}, then d_{x-2}, ... up to d_{x-y} is the y-th smallest? Actually, the y smallest are the last y: from index x-y to x-1? But note: the entire set is sorted descending, so the last element is the smallest. Therefore, the y smallest are the last y: indices from x-y to x-1? Actually, the y smallest are the last y in the set, which are the last y in the descending array: indices [x-y, x-1] (if we take 0-indexed). But note: the sum of these? \n\nBut wait: the problem says \"the y cheapest\", which are the smallest. So we want the sum of the smallest y in the set. In the set of the top x, the smallest y are the last y in the descending order? Actually, if we sort in ascending order, the set of the top x would be the last x in the ascending array. Then the y cheapest are the first y in the ascending order? But we have the array in descending order. \n\nAlternatively, we can precompute a prefix sum array for the ascending sorted array? But note the code we are given sorts the array in descending order? Actually, the code does:\n\n  for x in sorted(g())[::-1]: a += a[-1]+x,\n\nThis sorts the input, then reverses to get descending order, and then builds an array 'a' which is the prefix sum of the descending array? \n\nBut note: the array 'a' is built as:\n  a[0] = 0\n  then for each x in the sorted descending array: a.append(a[-1] + x)\n\nSo a[1] = p0 (the largest)\n   a[2] = p0+p1\n   ... \n   a[i] = sum of the first i largest items.\n\nNow, for a query (x, y): \n  The set we choose is the top x items. The free set is the y smallest in the top x. The y smallest in the top x are the last y in the top x, which in the descending order are the last y of the top x. How to get the sum of these? \n\nWe note that the entire top x sum is a[x] (since a[0]=0, then a[1] is the first, so a[x] is the sum of the first x largest). The free set is the last y of the top x. But note: the top x in descending order: [d0, d1, ..., d_{x-1}]. The last y are d_{x-y}, d_{x-y+1}, ... , d_{x-1}. \n\nBut wait: the prefix sum array 'a' is built on the entire descending array. So the sum of the first x-y items (the largest x-y) is a[x-y]. Then the free set (the last y) is the total of the top x minus the top x-y: a[x] - a[x-y].\n\nBut let me test with the example:\n\nExample: \n  Input: n=4, q=3, prices = [1,2,3,5]\n  Query1: x=3, y=2 -> free value = 3+2? but wait, the example says: \n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5,3,5, the two cheapest of them are 3+5=8\" -> wait, 5+3+5? but we have only one 5. Actually, the example input is not provided. The note says: \n      \"In the first query, a customer can buy three items worth 5, 3, 5\" -> so there are two 5's? \n\nLooking at the input specification: the second line contains n integers. So the example must have had two 5's? \n\nBut the note says: \n  Input: \n      n=3, q=3? Actually, the example has three items: 5,3,5? \n\nBut the example input in the note: \n  \"The first line contains two integers n and q ... The second line contains n integers ...\"\n\nSo let me assume the example: \n  n=3, q=3, prices = [5,3,5]\n\nThen sorted descending: [5,5,3]\nFor query (x=3, y=2): \n  We choose all 3. The free set is the 2 cheapest: 5 and 3? but wait, the two cheapest are 3 and 5? Actually, the two smallest are 3 and 5? But then the sum is 8? \n\nBut according to our method: \n  a = [0]\n  then add 5 -> a[1]=5\n  then add 5 -> a[2]=10\n  then add 3 -> a[3]=13\n\n  Then the free set = a[3] - a[3-2] = a[3]-a[1] = 13-5 = 8 -> matches.\n\nAnother query: (x=2, y=1): \n  We choose the top 2: [5,5]. The free set is the smallest 1: 5? \n  Our method: a[2] - a[2-1] = 10 - a[1] = 10-5 = 5 -> matches.\n\nThird query: (x=3, y=3): \n  free set = all 3: 13? \n  a[3]-a[0] = 13-0 = 13.\n\nBut the note says: \n  \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\nWait, that example has different prices? The note says: \n  \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items\" (so n=5? because the example output is 6) and the prices are [1,2,3,4,5]? \n\nActually, the note has multiple examples? \n\nBut the problem says: the store has n items. The example in the note for the third query: \n  \"In the third query, a customer has to buy all the items to receive the three cheapest of them for free; their total price is 1+2+3=6\"\n\nSo for that example: \n  n=5? \n  prices = [1,2,3,4,5]? \n  query: x=5, y=3? \n  Then we choose the top 5? which is the entire set. The free set is the 3 cheapest: 1,2,3 -> sum=6.\n\nOur method: \n  sort descending: [5,4,3,2,1]\n  prefix: a[0]=0, a[1]=5, a[2]=9, a[3]=12, a[4]=14, a[5]=15.\n  free set = a[5] - a[5-3] = 15 - a[2] = 15-9=6 -> matches.\n\nTherefore, the solution for program1 is:\n  For each query (x, y):\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the array 'a' we built has length n+1? and we have a[0]..a[n]. And x is at most n, and x-y>=0 because y<=x.\n\nSo in the code for program1, we have:\n\n  for b in [0]*q:\n      # read the query: x_i and y_i\n      x, y = map(int, next(r).split())\n      # then output a[x] - a[x-y]\n\nBut note: the array 'a' we built is for the entire descending sorted array. And we have a[0]=0, a[1]=first element, ... a[n]=total sum.\n\nTherefore, the missing code in program1.py is:\n\n  for _ in range(q):\n      x, y = g()\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the code already has:\n  for b in[0]*q:\n\nSo we can do:\n\n  for b in [0]*q:\n      x, y = g()\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut wait: the array 'a' is built from the sorted descending array. And we have stored the prefix sums. This matches.\n\nHowever, note: the array 'a' is built with:\n   a = [0]\n   for x in sorted(g())[::-1]: \n        a += a[-1] + x,\n\nSo a[0]=0, a[1]=first (largest), a[2]=largest+second largest, ... a[n]=total.\n\nSo for a given x, a[x] is the sum of the x largest items.\n\nThen the free set is the y smallest in the set of x largest. The y smallest in the set of x largest are the last y in the descending order, which are the smallest in that set. And we can compute that as the total of the x largest minus the total of the (x-y) largest? That is exactly a[x] - a[x-y].\n\nTherefore, the missing code for program1 is:\n\n  for b in [0]*q:\n      x, y = g()\n      print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\nBut note: the problem says the array 'a' is built by iterating over the sorted descending array. And we have built the prefix array for the entire array. So we have a[0..n] (n+1 elements). And x is at least 1 and at most n, and x-y is at least 0 and at most n.\n\nBut note: if x==y, then we are subtracting a[0] which is 0 -> then we get the entire set of x items? which is the free set? yes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow for program2.py:\n\nDescription: We are to compute the minimum number of moves to make b increasing (strictly). We start with b = [0,0,...,0]. In one move, we can choose an index i and either add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i. We can do multiple moves on the same index.\n\nWe want to make b[0] < b[1] < ... < b[n-1].\n\nWe are allowed to do any number of moves on any index. The cost is the total number of moves (each time we do an operation on an index, it counts as one move).\n\nWe note that for each index i, the value of b_i will be k_i * a_i, where k_i is an integer (positive, negative, or zero). But note: we start at 0 and then we can add or subtract any number of times. So b_i = c_i * a_i, where c_i is an integer (which can be positive or negative).\n\nBut note: we can do multiple operations on the same index. For example, we can do: \n   subtract a_i: then b_i = -a_i\n   then subtract again: b_i = -2a_i\n   then add: b_i = -a_i, etc.\n\nSo b_i = k_i * a_i, for any integer k_i.\n\nWe require: \n   b0 < b1 < ... < b_{n-1}\n\nWe want to minimize the total number of moves. The total moves is the sum of the absolute values of the k_i? Because each move is one operation. But note: if we do multiple operations on the same index, the net effect is k_i = (number of adds) - (number of subtracts). And the total moves is |k_0| + |k_1| + ... + |k_{n-1}|? \n\nBut wait: the problem says \"in one move you can choose an integer i and add a_i or subtract a_i\". So each move is one operation. Therefore, the total moves is the total number of operations. For index i, if we did 3 subtracts and 2 adds, then the net is k_i = -3 + 2 = -1, and the total moves for that index is 5. So the total moves for index i is |k_i|? No, because we did 5 moves. Actually, the net k_i is the net multiplier? Actually, if we do 3 subtracts and 2 adds, then the net is -a_i, but the total moves is 5. How do we express that? \n\nActually, the net effect is: \n   b_i = (number of adds - number of subtracts) * a_i = k_i * a_i, \nand the total moves for index i is (number of adds + number of subtracts). \n\nBut note: we can achieve the same net k_i in multiple ways? However, we are free to choose any sequence. The minimal number of moves to get a net k_i is |k_i|? Actually, no: \n   To get k_i=1: we do one add -> 1 move.\n   To get k_i=2: we do two adds -> 2 moves.\n   To get k_i=-1: one subtract -> 1 move.\n   To get k_i=0: we do nothing -> 0 moves.\n\nBut wait: what if we do an add and then a subtract? then we get 0, and that took 2 moves. But we could have done nothing. So the minimal moves for a net k_i is |k_i|? \n\nActually, yes: because we can do |k_i| moves: \n   if k_i>0: do k_i adds.\n   if k_i<0: do |k_i| subtracts.\n\nSo the total moves is |k_0| + |k_1| + ... + |k_{n-1}|.\n\nTherefore, we are to assign an integer k_i to each index i such that:\n   k_0 * a_0 < k_1 * a_1 < ... < k_{n-1} * a_{n-1}\nand minimize the sum |k_0|+|k_1|+...+|k_{n-1}|.\n\nThis is a dynamic programming problem.\n\nWe note that the constraints: n<=5000.\n\nWe can try to design a DP:\n\nLet dp[i][j] = the minimal total cost (sum of |k|) for the prefix [0..i] such that the last element (i-th) has a net multiplier j? But j can be any integer? That state is too big.\n\nAlternative: we note that the condition is:\n   k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n\nWe can try to iterate from left to right and let dp[i][k] = minimal total cost for the first i elements and the i-th element having a multiplier k. But k can be very large? \n\nWe need to avoid large k. Note: the minimal moves might be achieved with k_i that are not too large? \n\nBut note: we might have to make k_i very large if a_i is very small and the previous element is very large? \n\nHowever, we can use the following observation:\n\n   We require: k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n\n   => k_i >= ceil( (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1} + 1) / a_i )\n\nBut then we want to minimize |k_i|. So for each state at i-1 (with value k_{i-1}), we can compute the minimal k_i that satisfies the condition and then the cost for the i-th element is |k_i|. Then we update:\n\n   dp[i][k_i] = min( dp[i][k_i], dp[i-1][k_{i-1}] + |k_i| )\n\nBut the state k_i might be huge? \n\nWe need a better approach.\n\nAnother idea: we can note that the condition can be rewritten as:\n\n   k_i >= floor( (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) / a_i ) + 1   (if we are using integers)\n\nBut actually: \n   k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n   => k_i > (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) / a_i\n\nSo the minimal integer k_i is floor( (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) / a_i ) + 1, unless (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) is divisible by a_i, then we need to add 1? Actually, if (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) is divisible by a_i, then we need k_i at least (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) / a_i + 1? \n\nBut note: the condition is strict. So if (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) = some multiple of a_i, then k_i must be at least that multiple + 1.\n\nSo k_i_min = floor( (k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}) / a_i ) + 1\n\nBut then we have two choices for k_i: either take k_i_min or a larger value? However, we want to minimize the total cost. The cost for k_i is |k_i|. Since k_i_min might be negative? \n\nBut note: we can choose k_i to be negative? \n\nHowever, if we choose k_i to be negative, then the cost |k_i| is positive. But we might avoid large |k_i| by choosing positive k_i? \n\nBut note: if k_i_min is negative, then we can choose k_i=0? but then the condition: 0 * a_i = 0, and we require 0 > k_{i-1}*a_{i-1}. But if k_{i-1}*a_{i-1} is positive, then 0 is not greater. So we must choose k_i at least k_i_min. \n\nBut k_i_min might be negative? \n\nExample: \n   a_i is large, and k_{i-1}*a_{i-1} is negative? Then (k_{i-1}*a_{i-1})/a_i is negative, so k_i_min = negative number + 1? \n\nBut note: we can choose k_i to be negative? \n\nHowever, we want to minimize |k_i|. The minimal |k_i| for k_i>=k_i_min is achieved by the k_i that is closest to 0? \n\nBut note: k_i_min might be negative, then we can choose k_i = k_i_min, k_i_min+1, ... up to 0, then positive. The minimal |k_i| is min( |k_i_min|, |k_i_min+1|, ... )? Actually, the minimal |k_i| for k_i>=k_i_min is achieved at:\n\n   if k_i_min <= 0, then the minimal |k_i| is min( |k_i_min|, |k_i_min+1|, ... , |0| )? Actually, the minimal |k_i| for k_i>=k_i_min is 0 if k_i_min<=0? But wait: if k_i_min<=0, then we can choose k_i=0? \n\nBut we must check the condition: \n   k_i * a_i > k_{i-1} * a_{i-1}\n\nIf we choose k_i=0, then we require 0 > k_{i-1}*a_{i-1}. \n\nBut if k_{i-1}*a_{i-1} is negative, then 0 is greater? Then condition holds. \n\nBut if k_{i-1}*a_{i-1} is nonnegative, then 0 is not greater. So we cannot choose 0.\n\nTherefore, we must consider the sign.\n\nActually, we can break the problem by the sign of the b_i? But note: we are free to choose any integers. \n\nHowever, the problem is complex. \n\nLooking at the provided code:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  a = list(map(int, input().split(' '))) \n\n  c = None\n  d = 0\n  for i in range(len(a)):\n      p = 0\n      t = 0\n      for k in a[i+1:]:\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      t = 0\n      for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n          d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n          t = k*d\n          p += d\n      if c == None or p < c:\n          c = p\n\n  print(c)\n\nThis code structure is:\n\n  for each i (from 0 to n-1) we are computing a value p, and then we take the minimum p.\n\nWhat is p? It seems that for a fixed i, we are processing the elements to the right and to the left.\n\nBut note: the problem is to assign k_i for each index. The provided code does:\n\n  for i in range(len(a)):\n      p = 0\n      t = 0\n      for k in a[i+1:]:   # the elements after i\n          # TODO: Your code here\n      t = 0\n      for k in reversed(a[:i]):   # the elements before i, in reverse order (so from i-1 down to 0)\n          d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n          t = k*d\n          p += d\n      ... and then update c = min(c, p)\n\nBut the inner loop for the left part is already implemented? \n\nIn the left part (reversed(a[:i])):\n   We have k (which is the a_j for j from i-1 down to 0) and we do:\n        d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n        t = k * d\n        p += d\n\nWhat is t? and what is d?\n\nNote: the variable t is reset to 0 at the beginning of the left part.\n\nLet me simulate for a small example: \n   n=2, a = [1, 2]\n   i=0: \n        left: a[:0] is empty -> skip.\n        then we do the right part? but the right part is a[1:] = [2] and the TODO is missing.\n\n   i=1:\n        left: reversed(a[:1]) = [a0] = [1]\n        t=0\n        for k in [1]:\n            d = ceil((0+1)/1) = ceil(1) = 1\n            t = 1*1 = 1\n            p += 1 -> p=1\n        then the right part: a[2:] is empty.\n\n   Then c = min(c, 1) -> 1.\n\nBut what is the expected? \n   We have two elements: a0=1, a1=2.\n   We require b0 < b1.\n\n   Possibilities:\n      We can assign k0 and k1.\n\n      Condition: k0*1 < k1*2.\n\n      We want to minimize |k0|+|k1|.\n\n      Possibilities:\n        k0=0, k1=0 -> 0 cost, but 0<0 fails.\n        k0=0, k1=1 -> 0<2 -> valid, cost=1.\n        k0=1, k1=0 -> 1<0 fails.\n        k0=1, k1=1 -> 1<2 -> valid, cost=2.\n        k0=-1, k1=0 -> -1<0 -> valid, cost=1.\n\n      So minimal cost is 1.\n\n      The code for i=1: p=1 -> so it would output 1? \n\n      But what about i=0? \n        i=0: \n          left: empty -> skip.\n          right: a[1:]=[2] -> we have a TODO.\n\n      We must complete the TODO for the right part.\n\n      Also, for i=0: we then do the left part? but the left part is empty, so p remains 0? Then we update c = min(None,0)=0? That would be wrong.\n\n      Therefore, the TODO for the right part must be implemented similarly to the left part? \n\nLooking at the left part: \n   We are iterating from the element immediately to the left (i-1) and going backwards to 0. \n   For each element k (which is a_j) we compute:\n        d = ceil((t+1)/k)\n        t = k * d\n        p += abs(d)? or just d? \n\nBut note: p += d, and d is an integer. \n\nWhat is the meaning? \n\nIn the left part, we are processing the elements from i-1 down to 0. The variable t is the current b_{j+1} (the next element to the right, which we have already set). We require that b_j < b_{j+1}. \n\nBut note: we are going backwards. So when we are at j (with value k), the next element to the right (j+1) has been set to t? \n\nWe require: \n   b_j = d * k   (so we are setting k_j = d) \n   and we require b_j < b_{j+1} = t.\n\n   So we require: d * k < t.\n\nBut wait: the condition is the opposite: we require b_j < b_{j+1}. But we are going backwards: from j+1 to j. So we have already set b_{j+1} to t, and now we set b_j to d*k, and we require d*k < t.\n\nBut the code does:\n   d = ceil((t+1)/k)\n   t = k * d   -> then we set the new t for the next (leftward) element.\n\nBut note: the condition: d*k < t_old? But we set d = ceil((t_old+1)/k). Then:\n\n   d = ceil((t_old+1)/k) \n   => d >= (t_old+1)/k\n   => d*k >= t_old+1 > t_old\n\nSo we have d*k > t_old, which is the opposite of what we want.\n\nBut we want b_j < b_{j+1} = t_old. \n\nSo we are setting b_j = d*k, and we have d*k > t_old, which is b_j > b_{j+1} -> not increasing.\n\nThis is backwards.\n\nAlternatively, the code might be setting the constraint for the next element to the left? \n\nActually, we are going from j+1 to j (from right to left). We have set b_{j+1} to t_old. Now we want to set b_j such that b_j < b_{j+1}. \n\nBut the code sets:\n   d = ceil((t_old+1)/k)   -> then b_j = d*k, and then we set t = d*k (which becomes the new b_j for the next element to the left).\n\nBut then we have b_j = d*k > t_old (because d*k >= t_old+1) -> so b_j > b_{j+1}, which is the opposite.\n\nWe want b_j < b_{j+1}. \n\nSo we should set b_j to be less than t_old. \n\nHow about: \n   We want b_j = d * k < t_old.\n\n   The minimal |d| that satisfies d*k < t_old? \n\nBut note: we want to minimize the total moves. We are free to choose d. \n\nThe condition: d * k < t_old.\n\n   => d < t_old / k.\n\nSo the maximal integer d that satisfies d <= floor((t_old-1)/k) ? \n\nBut then we want to minimize |d|? \n\nBut note: we can choose d to be negative? \n\nHowever, the minimal |d| might be achieved by a negative d? \n\nBut the problem: we are going backwards and we are setting the entire sequence. \n\nAlternatively, the provided code for the left part might be intended for a different direction? \n\nBut note: the problem in the note: \n   Example1: a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> n=5, and the answer is 4.\n\n   How? \n        We can set: \n          b0 = -1, b1=0, b2=1, b3=2, b4=3 -> moves: | -1 | = 1 for b0, 0 for b1, 1 for b2, 2 for b3, 3 for b4 -> total 1+0+1+2+3=7? \n        But the example says 4 moves: \n          \"subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5\" -> so moves: \n          b0: 0 -> unchanged: 0 moves? \n          b1: subtract a1: 1 move -> b1=-1\n          b2: 0 -> unchanged: 0 moves? \n          b3: add a3: 1 move -> b3=1\n          b4: add a4: 1 move -> b4=1 -> but wait, we need increasing? \n          Actually, the example says: [ -1, 0, 3, 4, 5] -> that doesn't match.\n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        \"The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5] after 4 moves\"\n\n        So: \n          b0 = -1 -> move: subtract a0: 1 move -> -1\n          b1 = 0 -> 0 moves? \n          b2 = 3: we need to add a2 three times? 3 moves? \n          b3 = 4: add a3 four times? 4 moves? \n          b4 = 5: add a4 five times? 5 moves? -> total 1+0+3+4+5=13.\n\n   But the example says 4 moves.\n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> so b1 becomes -1? but then b0 is not touched? \n        and then add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5: so one move for each -> 4 moves.\n\n        Then the array: \n          b0 = 0\n          b1 = -1\n          b2 = 0\n          b3 = 1\n          b4 = 1\n          b5 = 1   -> but that is not increasing.\n\n   Correction: the example says: \n        \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> so b1 becomes -1 (if a1 is the first element? then b0 is 0, b1 becomes -1 -> then we have 0, -1 -> not increasing).\n\n   Actually, the example says: \n        \"The final array will be [\u22121, 0, 3, 4, 5]\"\n\n        So indices: \n          b0 = -1\n          b1 = 0\n          b2 = 3\n          b3 = 4\n          b4 = 5\n\n        How to achieve that? \n          b0: subtract a0: 1 move -> -1\n          b1: 0 moves -> 0? but then 0 is not greater than -1? \n          Actually, we can do: \n             b0: -1 (by one subtract)\n             b1: 0: how? we can add a1 once? then b1=1? -> then we have -1, 1 -> valid. Then we need to set b2=3: we can add a2 three times: 3 moves. Then b3: add a3 once: 1 move? then b3=4? but then we have 3<4 -> valid. Then b4: add a4 once: 1 move -> 5. Total moves: 1+1+3+1+1 = 7.\n\n        But the example says 4 moves.\n\n        The example says: \n            \"subtract a1 from b1\" -> so they are subtracting from b1? which is the first element? then b0 becomes -1? \n            and then add a3, a4, a5 to b3, b4, b5: \n                b0: 0 -> unchanged? \n                b1: -1\n                b2: 0\n                b3: 1\n                b4: 1\n                b5: 1\n\n        That is not increasing.\n\n   I think the example is: \n        \"Example1: you can subtract a1 from b1, and add a3, a4, and a5 to b3, b4, and b5 respectively.

But then we have -1 and 0 -> valid.\n        b2: 3: we do three moves on b2: three adds -> 3.\n        b3: 4: one move (add) -> 1, but then we need 3<1? fail.\n\n        Or b3: we do three adds? then 3, but then b2=3 and b3=3 -> not strictly.\n\n   I think the example might have a different a array? \n\n   The example says: \"Example1\" and then \"Example2\". \n\n   Example2: \n        Input: n=7, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1] -> answer=10.\n\n   How to achieve 10? \n        We can set: \n          b0 = -3, b1 = -2, b2 = -1, b3=0, b4=1, b5=2, b6=3.\n        Moves: \n          b0: 3 (subtract three times) -> 3 moves.\n          b1: 2 (subtract twice) -> 2 moves.\n          b2: 1 (subtract once) -> 1 move.\n          b3: 0 -> 0 moves.\n          b4: 1 move.\n          b5: 2 moves.\n          b6: 3 moves.\n        Total: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\n        Or we can do:\n          b0 = -4, b1 = -2, b2 = -1, b3=0, b4=1, b5=2, b6=4 -> but that might not be minimal.\n\n   The example says: \n        \"Example2: you can reach [\u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves.\"\n\n        Moves: \n          b0: -3: 3 moves (subtract)\n          b1: -2: 2 moves (subtract)\n          b2: -1: 1 move\n          b3: 0: 0\n          b4: 1: 1 move\n          b5: 2: 2 moves\n          b6: 3: 3 moves\n        Total: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12, not 10.\n\n   But wait: the example says 10 moves. \n\n   How 10? \n        They might be doing moves that are not the minimal for each index? \n\n   Note: we can do moves in any order and multiple times on the same index. \n\n   But the minimal moves for a given net is |k_i|, so the example [\u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3] requires 3+2+1+0+1+2+3=12.\n\n   The example says 10 moves. \n\n   I see: the example says: \n        \"you can reach [\u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves\"\n\n        So they must have a different assignment? \n\n   Let me compute the moves for the example array: \n        b0 = -3: then k0 = -3 -> 3 moves.\n        b1 = -2: then k1 = -2 -> 2 moves.\n        b2 = -1: then k2 = -1 -> 1 move.\n        b3 = 0: 0 moves.\n        b4 = 1: 1 move.\n        b5 = 2: 2 moves.\n        b6 = 3: 3 moves.\n        Total: 3+2+1+0+1+2+3 = 12.\n\n   Unless they are not using the minimal moves per index? \n\n   But the minimal moves to get -3 is 3. \n\n   Therefore, I think the example final array is not [\u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3] for the net multipliers of the given a_i=1. \n\n   Or the example has a different a array? \n\n   The example says: a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] for example2.\n\n   I think there is a misunderstanding.\n\n   Let me read the problem again: \n        \"In one move you can choose an integer i (1\u2264i\u2264n), and add a_i to b_i or subtract a_i from b_i.\"\n\n   So for index i, we can do:\n\n        b_i = c_i * a_i, and the moves for index i is |c_i|.\n\n   Then the example2: a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] and the final b = [\u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3] -> then c_i = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3] -> moves = 3+2+1+0+1+2+3=12.\n\n   But the example says 10 moves.\n\n   Unless the example2 has a different a array? \n\n   The problem says: \n        \"Example2: you can reach [\u22123, \u22122, \u22121, 0, 1, 2, 3] in 10 moves.\"\n\n   So they must be able to do it in 10 moves. How? \n\n   Note: we can do moves in any order and on any index. The net is what matters. \n\n   But the net for index i is fixed to be an integer multiple of a_i. In example2, a_i=1, so b_i can be any integer. \n\n   The moves: \n        We want b0=-3: we can do 3 subtracts on index0.\n        b1=-2: 2 subtracts on index1.\n        b2=-1: 1 subtract on index2.\n        b3=0: 0 moves.\n        b4=1: 1 add on index4.\n        b5=2: 2 adds on index5.\n        b6=3: 3 adds on index6.\n        -> 3+2+1+0+1+2+3=12.\n\n   How to do it in 10 moves? \n\n   We can share the moves? \n\n   But note: each move is on one index. \n\n   Insight: the problem does not require that the moves are done in isolation. We can do moves in any order. But the net for each index is the number of times we added minus the number of times we subtracted on that index. \n\n   Therefore, the minimal number of moves for index i is |c_i|, and the total is the sum. \n\n   So 12 is the minimal for example2.\n\n   But the example says 10. \n\n   I see the example might be: \n        a = [3,2,1,1,1,1,1] or something else? \n\n   The example says: \"Print a single integer, the minimum number of moves to make b increasing.\"\n\n   So for a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], the minimum moves is 12, not 10.\n\n   Unless the example2 is not with a_i=1 for all? \n\n   The example says: \"Example2\" and then the input is not specified. \n\n   Given the confusion, let me return to the provided code structure.\n\n   The code structure for program2 is:\n\n      for i in range(n):\n          p = 0\n          t = 0\n          for k in a[i+1:]:   # the elements to the right of i\n              # TODO: Your code here\n          t = 0\n          for k in reversed(a[:i]):   # the elements to the left of i, from i-1 down to 0\n              d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n              t = k * d\n              p += d\n          if c is None or p < c:\n              c = p\n\n      print(c)\n\n   What is the idea? \n\n   It seems that for a fixed i, we are not changing the i-th element? because we are only processing the left and the right. \n\n   And then p is the cost for the left and the cost for the right. \n\n   But then the i-th element is fixed to 0? \n\n   How can that work? \n\n   Let me try with n=2, a=[1,2]:\n        i=0:\n            right: a[1:]=[2] -> TODO.\n            left: empty -> p = 0 (from left) + whatever from right.\n        i=1:\n            right: empty.\n            left: reversed(a[:1])=reversed([1]) = [1] -> \n                  t=0\n                  for k=1: d = ceil((0+1)/1)=ceil(1)=1, t=1, p=1.\n            then c=1.\n\n   Then the answer=1.\n\n   This matches.\n\n   Now for i=0 in n=2, we must do the TODO for the right part.\n\n   How should the right part be processed? \n\n   In the left part, we processed from the element immediately to the left of i (which for i=0 there is none) up to the beginning. For the right part, we should process from the element immediately to the right of i to the end. \n\n   We require: b_i < b_{i+1} < b_{i+2} < ... \n\n   We are not changing the i-th element (b_i=0), and we want to set the right part.\n\n   How to set the right part? \n\n   We want: \n        b_{i} < b_{i+1} \n        b_{i+1} < b_{i+2}\n        ...\n\n   We can do similarly to the left part, but in the forward direction? \n\n   But the code processes the right part in the order they appear in the array? \n\n   However, the condition for the right part: \n        b_{i} < b_{i+1} \n        b_{i+1} < b_{i+2}\n\n   We can start with the first element to the right: \n        We require b_{i} < b_{i+1}  -> 0 < b_{i+1} = d * a_{i+1} for some integer d.\n        The minimal |d| that satisfies d * a_{i+1} > 0 is d=1.\n\n   Then for the next: \n        We require b_{i+1} = a_{i+1} < b_{i+2} = d_{i+2} * a_{i+2}\n\n        => d_{i+2} * a_{i+2} > a_{i+1}\n\n        => d_{i+2} > a_{i+1} / a_{i+2}\n\n   So d_{i+2} = ceil( (a_{i+1}) / a_{i+2} ) + 1? not exactly, because we require >, so floor(a_{i+1}/a_{i+2])+1 might work, but if it is integer then we need at least a_{i+1}/a_{i+2} + 1.\n\n   But note: the code for the left part used ceil((t+1)/k) and then set t = k*d.\n\n   In the right part, we might do similarly but in the forward direction? \n\n   However, the provided code for the right part is a for-loop over k in a[i+1:], and then TODO.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        t = 0   # but wait, the i-th element is 0? \n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # k is the a_j for j in [i+1, ...]\n            # we require that the next element (which will be b_{i+1}) > t (which is the previous element, initially 0)\n            # then we set d = ceil( (t+1) / k )   [because we require d*k > t]\n            # then the cost for this index is d (if d is positive) or |d|? \n            # but note: if we use d, then the moves for this index is |d|.\n\n            # However, the condition: d*k > t, and we want to minimize |d|.\n\n            # The minimal d in absolute value that satisfies d*k > t might be negative? \n\n            # But if we use a negative d, then d*k is negative, and if t is nonnegative, then negative is not greater. So we must use positive d.\n\n            # Therefore, d = ceil((t+1)/k) is the minimal positive integer d such that d*k > t.\n\n            # Then we set t = d * k   (which is the value of b_{i+1] for the next constraint)\n            # and add |d| to p.\n\n        But note: the minimal positive integer d that satisfies d*k > t is indeed ceil((t+1)/k) ? \n\n        Example: t=0, k=2 -> ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1 -> then d=1, and 1*2=2>0 -> valid.\n\n        Example: t=2, k=2 -> ceil((2+1)/2)=ceil(3/2)=ceil(1.5)=2, then 2*2=4>2 -> valid.\n\n        But is there a smaller d? d=1: 1*2=2, which is not >2. So d=2 is minimal.\n\n        Therefore, it is correct.\n\n   However, note: the value of t for the next element is set to d*k, which is the value of b_{i+1}. Then for the next element, we require b_{i+2} > b_{i+1} = t.\n\n   So the TODO for the right part is:\n\n        t = 0   # the value of the previous element (initially the i-th element, which is 0)\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += abs(d)   # or p += d? since d is positive? \n\n        But note: d is ceil(...) which is at least 1, so positive. Therefore, p += d.\n\n   But wait: the left part used p += d without abs, and d was positive? \n\n   In the left part: \n        for k in reversed(a[:i]): \n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n   And in the example for i=1 in n=2, we had d=1, so p=1.\n\n   Therefore, for the right part, we should do the same: p += d.\n\n   But note: the right part might require negative d? \n\n   We argued that for the right part, we must use positive d because we require b_{i+1} > 0 (the i-th element is 0) and then for the next ones we require even larger. \n\n   So d will be positive.\n\n   Therefore, the TODO for the right part is:\n\n        t = 0\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            d = math.ceil((t+1) / k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n   Then for the left part, we already have:\n\n        t = 0\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            d = math.ceil((t+1) / k)\n            t = k * d\n            p += d\n\n   And then we take the minimum p over i.\n\n   Why over i? \n\n   The idea might be: we are not changing the i-th element (it remains 0), and then we set the left part and the right part relative to it. \n\n   But the left part is set to be increasing from left to the center i, and the right part is set to be increasing from i to the right. \n\n   However, the entire array must be increasing. The left part is processed from i-1 down to 0, and the condition is that each element is less than the next element to the right. When we set the left part, we start from the element immediately to the left of i (which will be the rightmost in the left part) and then move left. We ensure that the sequence from 0 to i is increasing. Similarly, the right part from i to the end is increasing.\n\n   But note: the element at i is 0. The element at i-1 (if exists) is set to be less than the element at i (0) -> so it must be negative. The element at i+1 is set to be greater than 0.\n\n   Example: n=2, a=[1,2]:\n        i=0: \n            left: empty.\n            right: a[1:]=[2] -> \n                   t=0\n                   for k=2: d = ceil((0+1)/2)=ceil(0.5)=1, then t=2, p=1.\n            total p=1.\n        i=1:\n            left: a[:1]=[1] -> reversed is [1]\n                   t=0\n                   for k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1, t=1, p=1.\n            right: empty.\n            total p=1.\n\n        Then the answer=1.\n\n   Example: n=3, a=[1,1,1]:\n        i=0:\n            left: empty.\n            right: a[1:]=[1,1]\n                t=0\n                for k=1: d=ceil((0+1)/1)=1 -> t=1, p=1.\n                for k=1: d=ceil((1+1)/1)=ceil(2)=2 -> t=2, p=1+2=3.\n            p=3.\n\n        i=1:\n            left: a[:1]=[1] -> reversed=[1]\n                   t=0 -> d=ceil(1/1)=1, t=1, p=1.\n            right: a[2:]=[1]\n                   t=0 -> d=ceil(1/1)=1, t=1, p=1+1=2.\n            p=2.\n\n        i=2:\n            left: a[:2]=[1,1] -> reversed=[1,1]\n                   t=0 -> d=ceil(1/1)=1, t=1, p=1.\n                   then for the next: d=ceil((1+1)/1)=2, t=2, p=1+2=3.\n            p=3.\n\n        Then the answer=2.\n\n   Is 2 the minimal? \n        We can do:\n           b0 = -1 (1 move: subtract)\n           b1 = 0 (0 moves) -> then b0=-1 < b1=0.\n           b2 = 1 (1 move: add) -> then b1=0 < b2=1.\n           total moves=2.\n\n        Or we can do:\n           b0=0, b1=1, b2=2: moves=0+1+2=3.\n           b0=-1, b1=1, b2=0: not increasing.\n\n        So 2 is minimal.\n\n   Therefore, the code for program2 is:\n\n        import math\n        n = int(input())\n        a = list(map(int, input().split(' '))) \n\n        c = None\n        for i in range(len(a)):\n            p = 0\n            t = 0\n            # Process the right part: from i+1 to end\n            for k in a[i+1:]:\n                # d is the minimal positive integer such that d*k > t\n                d = math.ceil((t+1) / k)\n                t = k * d\n                p += d\n\n            t = 0\n            # Process the left part: from i-1 down to 0\n            for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n                d = math.ceil((t+1) / k)\n                t = k * d\n                p += d\n\n            if c is None or p < c:\n                c = p\n\n        print(c)\n\n   But note: the division (t+1)/k might be an integer? and ceil might work.\n\n   However, in Python, when using math.ceil, if the number is integer, ceil returns the integer.\n\n   But note: (t+1)/k might be an integer. For example, if t+1 is divisible by k, then ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+1)//k.\n\n   But then d = (t+1)//k, and then d*k = t+1, which is > t -> valid.\n\n   Therefore, it is correct.\n\n   However, note: the constraints: a_i can be up to 10^9, and t can be large. But the for loops are O(n) and we do it for each i, so total O(n^2). n<=5000, so 5000^2=25e6, which is acceptable in Pyton if the operations inside are cheap.\n\n   But the division and ceil are cheap.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2 is the TODO part for the right part.\n\n   But note: the provided code already has:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So we replace the TODO with:\n\n        d = math.ceil((t+1) / k)\n        t = k * d\n        p += d\n\n   But note: we must use integer arithmetic? or floating point? \n\n   The numbers can be up to 10^9, and t can be up to 10^9 * 5000? which is 5e12, which is within the range of Python integers. But (t+1)/k might be a float and might lose precision? \n\n   We can do integer ceiling division: \n\n        d = (t) // k\n        if (t+1) % k != 0:\n            d = (t+1) // k + 1\n        else:\n            d = (t+1) // k\n\n   But note: ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+1 + k - 1) // k   [integer ceil division formula]\n\n        = (t + k) // k\n\n   But let me check: \n        ceil(a/b) = (a + b - 1) // b   for positive a and b.\n\n        Here a = t+1, b = k.\n\n        So ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+1 + k - 1) // k = (t+k) // k.\n\n   However, let me test: \n        t=0, k=2: (0+2)//2 = 2//2=1 -> correct.\n        t=2, k=2: (2+2)//2=4//2=2 -> correct.\n\n   But what if t+1 is divisible by k? \n        t+1 = c * k, then (t+1 + k - 1) = c*k + k - 1 = k*(c+1) - 1, then (t+k) = c*k + k - 1? \n        Actually, t = c*k - 1, then t+k = c*k -1 + k = k*(c+1) - 1, then (t+k)//k = c+1 - 1//k? -> integer division: (k*(c+1)-1) // k = c+1 - 1 = c? \n\n        But we want c.\n\n        So the formula ceil(a/b) = (a-1)//b + 1.\n\n        For a = t+1, then ceil = (t+1 - 1) // k + 1 = t//k + 1, if (t+1) is divisible by k, then t = c*k-1, then t//k = (c*k-1)//k = c-1, then d = c-1+1 = c.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n            if (t+1) % k == 0:\n                d = (t+1) // k\n            else:\n                d = (t+1) // k + 1\n\n        But the formula: d = (t+1 + k - 1) // k = (t+k) // k   does not work as shown above.\n\n        Let me test with t+1 divisible by k: \n            t+1 = 4, k=2 -> then d should be 2.\n            (t+k) = 3+2? wait, t=3, k=2 -> (3+2)=5, 5//2=2 -> works.\n\n        But wait: t=3, k=2: \n            ceil(4/2)=ceil(2)=2.\n            (t+k)=5, 5//2=2.\n\n        Another: t=1, k=2: \n            ceil((1+1)/2)=ceil(2/2)=ceil(1)=1.\n            (t+k)=1+2=3, 3//2=1 -> works.\n\n        And if not divisible: \n            t=0, k=2: ceil(1/2)=1, (0+2)=2, 2//2=1 -> works.\n            t=2, k=2: ceil(3/2)=2, (2+2)=4, 4//2=2 -> works.\n\n        Therefore, we can use: d = (t + k) // k\n\n        But note: t and k are positive.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can use integer arithmetic:\n\n        d = (t + k) // k   # if we are sure that t and k are positive and we want ceil((t+1)/k)\n\n   But is it always ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+k) // k?\n\n        Let me prove: \n            Let x = (t+1) / k.\n            We want d = ceil(x).\n\n            (t+k) // k = floor((t+k)/k) = floor(t/k + 1) = floor(t/k) + 1.\n\n            But note: \n                ceil(x) = ceil((t+1)/k) = \n                    if (t+1) is divisible by k, then = (t+1)/k = integer.\n                    else, then = floor((t+1)/k) + 1.\n\n            And floor((t+1)/k) = floor(t/k + 1/k) = \n                if t = m*k + r (0<=r<k), then (t+1)/k = m + (r+1)/k.\n                then floor = m if r+1<k, and m+1 if r+1==k? but r+1<=k.\n\n                Actually, r+1 is between 1 and k.\n\n                So floor = m if r+1 < k? no: \n                    if r+1 < k, then (r+1)/k < 1, so floor = m.\n                    if r+1 == k, then (r+1)/k=1, so floor = m+1.\n\n                Then ceil = \n                    if r+1 < k: ceil = m+1\n                    if r+1 == k: ceil = m+1.\n\n                So ceil = m+1 in both cases.\n\n            Now, (t+k) // k = (m*k + r + k) // k = (m+1)*k + r // k = m+1 + floor(r/k) = m+1, since r<k.\n\n            And we have: \n                if r+1 < k: ceil = m+1, and (t+k)//k = m+1.\n                if r+1 == k: ceil = m+1, and (t+k)//k = m+1.\n\n            So it holds.\n\n        Therefore, we can use: d = (t + k) // k\n\n   But note: the condition: we require d*k > t. \n        d = (t+k)//k, then d*k = k * ((t+k)//k) \n        But note: (t+k)//k is the floor of (t+k)/k, so \n            d*k <= t+k\n        We require d*k > t, so we require t+k > t, which is true. But is it strictly greater?\n\n            d*k = k * floor((t+k)/k) \n            and since (t+k)/k is not necessarily an integer, we have:\n                d*k = k * floor((t+k)/k) <= t+k - ? \n\n            Actually, we have: \n                d = (t+k)//k  => d*k = k * ((t+k)//k) \n                and we know: (t+k)//k is at least (t+k)/k - (k-1)/k, so d*k >= t+k - (k-1) = t+1.\n\n            Therefore, d*k >= t+1 > t.\n\n        So it is strictly greater.\n\n   Therefore, we can use integer arithmetic: d = (t+k) // k\n\n   But note: the left part in the provided code uses math.ceil. We can change both to integer arithmetic? But the problem says the given code for the left part is already implemented with math.ceil. \n\n   Since the constraints are large, and integer arithmetic is faster, we might change both. But the problem only asks for the TODO in the right part.\n\n   However, to be consistent with the left part (which uses math.ceil) and to avoid floating point precision issues, we might use integer arithmetic for the right part as well.\n\n   But the problem does not require to change the left part.\n\n   We have two options for the TODO in the right part:\n\n        Option 1: use math.ceil (floating point) as in the left part:\n\n            d = math.ceil((t+1) / k)\n\n        Option 2: use integer arithmetic:\n\n            d = (t + k) // k   # because ceil((t+1)/k) = (t+k)//k\n\n   But note: t and k are integers, and k>=1, so (t+1)/k might be a float that is not representable exactly? for large t and k. \n\n   Example: t = 10**18, k = 10**9+1 -> (t+1)/k might lose precision.\n\n   Therefore, we should use integer arithmetic.\n\n   But the left part uses math.ceil. We can change the left part as well? but the problem says the left part is already implemented.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Complete the code ... with missing lines or blocks\". We are only to complete the TODO block.\n\n   And the TODO block is in the right part.\n\n   So we can do:\n\n        d = (t + k) // k\n\n   But wait: what if (t+1) is 0? then we want d=0? but then the condition fails? \n\n   However, t is initially 0 (the value of the i-th element) and then for the first element in the right part, we require d*k>0, so d>=1. \n\n   And (0+k)//k = 1, which is correct.\n\n   Therefore, we can use:\n\n        d = (t + k) // k\n\n   But note: the left part uses math.ceil. We are not allowed to change the left part. \n\n   However, the problem does not require to change the left part. \n\n   But to be safe and avoid floating point, we might use the integer formula in the TODO for the right part.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is for the TODO in the right part.\n\n   We'll output:\n\n        d = (t + k) // k\n        t = k * d\n        p += d\n\n   But note: the left part uses:\n\n        d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n\n   and then the same update.\n\n   We can use the integer version for the right part.\n\n   Let me test with the example: n=2, a=[1,2], i=0, right part: \n        k=2, t=0: \n            d = (0+2)//2 = 2//2=1 -> then t=2, p=1.\n\n   Then the entire program for i=0: p=1.\n\n   For i=1: p=1 (from the left part).\n\n   Then the answer=1.\n\n   It works.\n\n   But note: the example in the left part: \n        for the left part, we have: \n            k=1, t=0: \n                d = math.ceil((0+1)/1)=ceil(1)=1 -> then t=1, p=1.\n\n   If we did the left part with integer arithmetic: \n        d = (0+1)//1 = 1 -> same.\n\n   So we are consistent.\n\n   Therefore, the missing code for program2 is:\n\n        d = (t + k) // k\n        t = k * d\n        p += d\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program\", and we are to output only the missing code for the two programs in a json.\n\n   Summary:\n\n   program1: \n        for b in [0]*q:\n            x, y = g()\n            print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n   program2:\n        d = (t + k) // k\n        t = k * d\n        p += d\n\n   However, note: in program1, the array 'a' has n+1 elements (from 0 to n). And x is at least 1 and at most n, and x-y is at least 0 and at most n. So a[x] and a[x-y] are defined.\n\n   But note: the array 'a' in program1 is built as:\n\n        a = [0]\n        for x in sorted(g())[::-1]: \n            a += a[-1] + x,\n\n        So a[0]=0, a[1]=p0, a[2]=p0+p1, ... a[n]=total.\n\n   And the query: we use a[x] and a[x-y]. \n\n   Example: x=3, y=2: then we use a[3] and a[1].\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"    x, y = g()\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\",\n          \"program2\": \"        d = (t + k) // k\\n        t = k * d\\n        p += d\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program1 code is inside the for loop. The existing code has:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We must fill the TODO. We are to read the query and then print the answer.\n\n   The program2 code is inside the for-loop for the right part.\n\n   However, the program2 TODO is in the inner loop for the right part. We are to replace the TODO with three lines.\n\n   But the TODO is only one line? We are replacing the entire block.\n\n   We output the exact code that should be placed in the TODO.\n\n   For program1, the existing code has:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with:\n\n        x, y = g()\n        print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n   But note: the existing code has a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", and then we have to put the code. We put two lines.\n\n   For program2, the existing code has:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the TODO with three lines.\n\n   But note: the program2 code has after the TODO:\n\n        t = 0\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n\n   So we must not disturb that.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"    x, y = g()\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\",\n        \"program2\": \"        d = (t + k) // k\\n        t = k * d\\n        p += d\"\n\n   But note: the indentation. In program1, the for loop is at the same level as the previous, so we indent by 4 spaces.\n\n   In the given program1, the for loop is:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to put two lines of code inside the for loop. We indent by 4 more spaces.\n\n   Similarly, in program2, the TODO is inside the for k in a[i+1:], so we indent by 8 spaces (if the outer is 4 and the inner is 8).\n\n   But the provided program2 has:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We replace the comment with three lines, each indented by 8 spaces? \n\n   However, the program2 code we are to output is the three lines, and we must match the existing indentation.\n\n   The existing code in program2 for the left part (which is already implemented) is:\n\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k*d\n            p += d\n\n   So the three lines in the right part should be indented the same.\n\n   Therefore, we output the three lines with 8 spaces at the beginning? \n\n   But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the exact code that goes in the TODO, with the same indentation as the TODO.\n\n   The TODO in program2 is at the same indentation level as the for-loop body. So we output the three lines with the same indentation as the comment.\n\n   In the provided program2, the for-loop for the right part is:\n\n        for k in a[i+1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   So the TODO is at 8 spaces (if the outer for is 4, and the inner for is 8, and the comment is 12? but the comment is at 12? \n\n   Actually, the code:\n\n        for i in range(len(a)):\n            p = 0\n            t = 0\n            for k in a[i+1:]:\n                # TODO: Your code here\n\n   The for k loop is at 8 spaces, and the comment is at 12.\n\n   We output three lines at 12 spaces.\n\n   But the left part is:\n\n        for k in reversed(a[:i]):\n            d = math.ceil((t+1)/k)\n            t = k*d\n            p += d\n\n   which is at 12 spaces.\n\n   So we do the same.\n\n   Therefore, the final output:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"    x, y = g()\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\",\n          \"program2\": \"        d = (t + k) // k\\n        t = k * d\\n        p += d\"\n        }\n\n   But note: in program1, the existing code has a space after the for? \n\n        for b in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the comment. We put:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:\n            x, y = g()\n            print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n   But the existing code has no colon? \n\n   Actually, the existing code in program1 is:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   This is valid: the for loop has a body that is currently a comment? and then nothing. But we are to replace the comment with two lines. \n\n   We must break the line? \n\n   We can do:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:\n            x, y = g()\n            print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n   But the existing code has the comment on the same line. We can simply put the two lines after the for.\n\n   Alternatively, we can write:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:\n            x, y = g()\n            print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n   But the existing code has the for loop without a colon? \n\n   Actually, the code: \n\n        for b in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   is a for loop that has a body that is a comment? and then the body is empty. \n\n   We must have the body. We can do:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:\n            x, y = g()\n            print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n   But the original code has the for loop and then the comment. We are replacing the comment with two lines of code. \n\n   How to do that? \n\n   We can write:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:\n            x, y = g()\n            print(a[x] - a[x-y])\n\n   But note: the original for loop line ends with a comment. We remove the comment and put a colon? \n\n   Actually, the original code has:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We can change that line to:\n\n        for b in[0]*q:\n\n   and then put the two lines. But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", so we are allowed to change the for loop line? \n\n   However, the problem says: \"Complete the code ... with missing lines or blocks\". We are to fill the missing lines. \n\n   But the TODO is in the comment. We are to replace the entire for loop body? \n\n   The problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", meaning the code that is missing, not the entire for loop.\n\n   We are to output only the two lines that go inside the for loop.\n\n   Therefore, we output:\n\n        \"program1\": \"    x, y = g()\\n    print(a[x] - a[x-y])\"\n\n   and we assume that the for loop line is already there.\n\n   Similarly, in program2, we output only the three lines that go in the TODO block.\n\n   Therefore, the final answer."
