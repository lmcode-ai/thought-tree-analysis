But the total n is 200000, and the total over test cases is 200000, but if we do a binary search for each j, that would be O(n log n) per test case? The total n over test cases is 200000, so worst-case one test case with n=200000 -> O(n log n) which is acceptable? But note: t can be up to 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the maximum n per test case might be 200000, but the number of test cases t is at most 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the maximum t is 10000, but the average n is 200000/10000 = 20? So we can do O(n log n) per test case? Actually, worst-case one test case with n=200000 -> then O(n log n) is acceptable (200000 * log2(200000) ~ 200000 * 18 = 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton).

Then at the end we check total==0? It's -1 -> so we print 'NO'. Alternatively, we can set a flag:\n\n            valid = True\n            for x in ...:\n                ... if condition:\n                    valid = False\n                    break   # but we break the loop\n\n            Then at the end: if valid and total==0: print YES, else NO. But the code snippet doesn't have that. It only has:\n\n            print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO') So we must set total to a non-zero value if we break?

      "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total such that the sum of the weights of the candies Alice eats from the left equals the sum of the weights of the candies Bob eats from the right. The solution involves efficiently checking all possible partitions of the candy array where the sum of the left segment equals the sum of the right segment without overlapping.\n\n### Approach for Program1\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires finding two non-overlapping segments\u2014one starting from the left (Alice's segment) and one from the right (Bob's segment)\u2014such that their sums are equal. The goal is to maximize the total number of candies (i.e., the sum of the lengths of both segments).\n\n2. **Intuition**: \n   - **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Compute prefix sums (sum of elements from the start up to each index) and suffix sums (sum of elements from each index to the end).\n   - **Binary Search for Efficiency**: For each possible segment length Bob might take (from the right), use binary search to find the largest possible segment Alice can take from the left such that their sums are equal and the segments do not overlap.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Precompute prefix sums for all possible starting segments and suffix sums for all possible ending segments.\n   - **Dictionary for Prefix Sums**: Store the indices where each prefix sum occurs in a dictionary to facilitate quick lookups.\n   - **Binary Search**: For each possible suffix sum (representing Bob's segment), check if there exists a matching prefix sum (Alice's segment) such that their combined length does not exceed the array size. Use binary search to find the largest valid segment for Alice.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) per test case, where n is the number of candies. This is due to the binary search operations for each suffix segment.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing prefix and suffix sums and the dictionary.\n\n### Solution Code for Program1\n```python\nt = int(input().strip())\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] + w[i - 1]\n    suffix = [0] * (n + 2)\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        suffix[i] = suffix[i + 1] + w[i]\n    d = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(0, n + 1):\n        d[prefix[i]].append(i)\n    ans = 0\n    for j in range(0, n + 1):\n        s = suffix[n - j]\n        if s in d:\n            arr = d[s]\n            lo, hi = 0, len(arr) - 1\n            candidate_index = -1\n            while lo <= hi:\n                mid = (lo + hi) // 2\n                if arr[mid] <= n - j:\n                    candidate_index = arr[mid]\n                    lo = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    hi = mid - 1\n            if candidate_index != -1:\n                ans = max(ans, candidate_index + j)\n    print(ans)\n```\n\n### Approach for Program2\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves verifying if a given array can be constructed by a series of operations where a pointer starts at the first element, moves left or right (with specific rules), and ends at the first element. The operations involve incrementing or decrementing the current element before moving.\n\n2. **Intuition**:\n   - **Prefix Sum Check**: The total sum of the array must be zero because every right move (increment) must be balanced by a left move (decrement) to return the pointer to the start.\n   - **Non-Negative Prefix**: The prefix sum must never be negative at any point during traversal.\n   - **Zero Prefix Handling**: Once the prefix sum becomes zero, all subsequent prefix sums must also be zero to ensure no further operations are performed after returning to the start.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Traversal with Checks**: Traverse the array while maintaining a running total (prefix sum). If at any point the prefix sum becomes negative or becomes non-zero after having been zero, the array is invalid.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Time Complexity**: O(n) per test case, where n is the length of the array, as we traverse the array once.\n   - **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space, as we only use a few variables.\n\n### Solution Code for Program2\n```python\ninput = __import__('sys').stdin.readline\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    allzeros = False\n    total = 0\n    for x in map(int, input().split()):\n        total += x\n        if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n            total = 1\n            break\n        if total == 0:\n            allzeros = True\n    print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO')\n\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    solve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Program1**: The solution involves precomputing prefix and suffix sums to efficiently check for segments where the sum of the left segment equals the sum of the right segment. By using a dictionary to store prefix sums and their indices, and binary search to find valid segments, we maximize the total candies eaten.\n- **Program2**: The solution checks the feasibility of constructing the array by ensuring the total sum is zero (indicating balanced moves), the prefix sums never dip below zero (ensuring valid operations), and once the prefix sum becomes zero, all subsequent sums must also be zero (ensuring no further operations after returning to start). If any condition fails, the array is deemed invalid.",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given multiple test cases. For each test case:\n  - First integer n: the size of the array.\n  - Then an array a of n integers.\n\nWe are to determine if we can obtain the array a after performing a series of operations with the rules:\n  1. The pointer starts at the first element (index0) and after all operations must return to the first element.\n  2. Two operations:\n        a) If not at the last element: \n             - Increase the current element by 1, then move to the next element.\n        b) If not at the first element:\n             - Decrease the current element by 1, then move to the previous element.\n\nImportant observations from known solutions and the problem:\n\nLet the array be a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\nWe can model the operations as:\n  - The process is a walk from index0 to ... and back to index0.\n  - The operations can be thought of as:\n        Operation 1 (right move): \n            current_index = i -> i+1, and we add 1 to a[i] (the current element before moving)\n        Operation 2 (left move):\n            current_index = i -> i-1, and we subtract 1 from a[i] (the current element before moving)\n\nBut note: the operations are performed and then we move. Also, the entire process must end at index0.\n\nWe can think of the net effect on the array. However, note that the problem says we start with zeros and then apply operations.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a known approach:\n\n1. The entire process must end at index0, so the total number of right moves must equal the total number of left moves.\n\n2. We can define a prefix sum array for the operations. However, note the constraints and the fact that the total n over test cases is bounded by 200,000.\n\nKnown solution idea (from similar problems):\n\nWe traverse from left to right and maintain a running total (which represents the current \"balance\" at each position). However, note the operations:\n\n  - When we move right from i to i+1, we leave a[i] with an increased value (so we are adding 1 at a[i] for each right move that passes through i).\n  - When we move left from i to i-1, we leave a[i] with a decreased value (so we subtract 1 at a[i] for each left move that passes through i).\n\nBut note: the same candy might be passed multiple times? Actually, the operations are sequential and the pointer moves step by step.\n\nAlternatively, we can model the array as:\n\n  Let d[i] be the number of times the pointer moves from i to i+1 (right move) minus the number of times the pointer moves from i+1 to i (left move). Then:\n\n      a[0] = d[0]   (because the first candy: we only have right moves leaving it and left moves coming from the right? But note: we start at 0 and the first operation that leaves 0 must be a right move. Also, when we come back we might have left moves that pass through 0? Actually, the pointer must end at 0, so the last operation must be a left move from 1 to 0? But then we subtract 1 at index1 and then at index0 we are not modified in the last step? \n\nActually, the operations:\n\n  Operation 1: at position i (starting at 0), we do a right move: \n        a[i] becomes a[i] + 1, then move to i+1.\n  Operation 2: at position i (i>=1), we do a left move:\n        a[i] becomes a[i] - 1, then move to i-1.\n\nSo the net effect on the array is:\n\n  a[0] = (number of right moves starting at 0) - (number of left moves that end at 0? but note: when we leave 0 to go to 1 we add 1, and when we come back from 1 to 0 we subtract 1 at index1 and then at index0 we are not modified by that move? Actually, the move that comes back to 0 ends at 0 and does not modify a[0] again? \n\nWait, the operation that moves from 1 to 0: we are at 1, then we subtract 1 at 1 and move to 0. So a[0] is only modified by the right moves that leave 0 and the left moves that leave 1? But note: when we are at 0 and do a left move? We cannot because we are at the first element. So a[0] is only increased by the right moves that start at 0.\n\nSimilarly, for a[1]:\n  - It is increased by every right move that goes from 1 to 2? and also decreased by every left move that goes from 1 to 0? and also increased by the right moves that start at 0 (because they pass through 1? no, they only leave 0 and then we are at 1, but the operation that leaves 0 only adds to 0 and then we are at 1. Then when we are at 1, we can do a right move (which adds to 1) or a left move (which subtracts from 1). Also, we can come to 1 from 2 by a left move? but that would subtract at 2 and then we are at 1, and then we can do a right move from 1 to 2 (which adds to 1) or a left move from 1 to 0 (which subtracts from 1).\n\nActually, we can model the entire array by the net number of times the edge (i, i+1) is traversed to the right minus the number of times it is traversed to the left. Let:\n\n  r[i] = number of times we move from i to i+1 (right move)\n  l[i] = number of times we move from i to i-1 (left move)  [for i>=1]\n\nThen the value at position i is:\n\n  a[0] = r[0] - l[1]   ??? \n\nBut wait, when we are at 0, we can only do right moves. Then we leave 0 (r[0] times) and then we come back to 0 only from 1 (so l[1] times: but note that when we come back from 1 to 0, we are at 1 and then we do a left move: that subtracts 1 at 1, not at 0). \n\nActually, the value at a[i] is:\n\n  a[i] = (number of times we were at i and did a right move) + (number of times we were at i and did a left move) ? \n\nBut note: \n  - When we are at i and do a right move: we add 1 to a[i] and then move to i+1.\n  - When we are at i and do a left move: we subtract 1 from a[i] and then move to i-1.\n\nSo a[i] = (number of right moves starting at i) - (number of left moves starting at i).\n\nBut note: we can also pass through i without starting a move from i? Actually, every time we are at i we are about to make a move. So the entire time we are at i, we either do a right or a left move (if allowed). Therefore:\n\n  a[i] = (right_moves[i]) - (left_moves[i])\n\nBut we also have constraints on the moves:\n\n  - The moves must form a walk that starts and ends at 0.\n\n  - The walk must be such that we never go left from 0 and never go right from n-1.\n\n  - The net displacement: the total right moves must equal the total left moves? Actually, we start at 0 and end at 0, so the number of right moves must equal the number of left moves.\n\n  - Additionally, we can model the entire walk as a sequence of moves. We can define the prefix sum of the net moves:\n\n        Let s[0] = 0.\n        For i from 0 to n-1:\n            s[i+1] = s[i] + (right_moves[i] - left_moves[i+1])? \n\nBut note: the moves are on edges. Alternatively, we can use the idea of a balance that changes as we traverse.\n\nKnown solution from the provided code snippet:\n\nThe provided code snippet for the solve function does:\n\n  n = int(input())\n  allzeros = False\n  total = 0\n  for x in map(int, input().split()):\n      total += x\n      if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n          # ... (we break or set a flag and then break?)\n          # Actually, the known solution for similar problems (like Codeforces problems) is to check:\n          #   - The prefix sum must never be negative.\n          #   - Once the prefix sum becomes zero at some point (allzeros becomes True), then we must not have any non-zero after that.\n      allzeros = allzeros or total == 0\n\n  Then we print 'YES' if total==0 else 'NO'\n\nBut note: the problem says the array can have negative values? Actually, the operations can leave negative values.\n\nHowever, the known solution for the problem \"Candies and Two Sisters\" (or similar) is:\n\n  We traverse the array and maintain:\n      prefix[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i]\n\n  But note: the problem says the total of the entire array must be zero? Why?\n\nExplanation:\n\n  Consider the entire process: \n      The operations that add and subtract must balance out? \n\n  Actually, the entire array is built by the moves. The net effect on the entire array: \n      The only moves that affect the array are the right moves (which add 1 at the current position) and the left moves (which subtract 1 at the current position). \n\n  However, note that the starting point is 0 and we end at 0. The total sum of the array is:\n\n      sum(a) = (total right moves) - (total left moves)\n\n  But the total right moves must equal the total left moves? Why? Because every time we move right we must eventually move left to come back? Actually, the entire path: we start at 0 and end at 0, so the number of right moves must equal the number of left moves. Therefore, the total sum of the array must be 0.\n\n  So condition 1: total sum must be 0.\n\n  Condition 2: the prefix sums must be non-negative? Actually, we can have negative values in the array? But note the operations: we can only move right from the left and left from the right. However, the prefix sum of the array might not be the same as the balance of the walk.\n\n  Actually, we can model the walk as:\n\n      Let b[0] = 0.\n      For i from 0 to n-1:\n          We are at position i. We have a[i] = (number of times we left i to the right) - (number of times we left i to the left).\n\n      But note: the number of times we enter i from the left (if i>0) is the number of right moves from i-1, and the number of times we enter i from the right (if i<n-1) is the number of left moves from i+1.\n\n      The net balance at i: \n          (right_moves[i-1] + left_moves[i+1]) = (right_moves[i] + left_moves[i])   [because we leave i by right or left]\n\n      But also, the value a[i] = right_moves[i] - left_moves[i].\n\n      And the condition that the walk is connected: \n          For i from 0 to n-2: \n              right_moves[i] = left_moves[i+1]   ??? \n\n      Actually, the number of times we traverse the edge (i, i+1) to the right must equal the number of times we traverse it to the left? Not necessarily, because we might have multiple passes? \n\n  Alternatively, we can use a known solution from Codeforces problems (like \"Candies\" or \"Two Sweeps\"):\n\n      We traverse from left to right and maintain a prefix sum of the array. We require:\n          - The entire array sum is 0.\n          - The prefix sums (starting from the left) must be non-negative.\n          - Once the prefix sum becomes zero at some index, then the rest of the array must be zero? Or we cannot have a positive prefix again? Actually, the known solution in the provided code snippet uses:\n\n          total = 0\n          allzeros = False   # meaning we have encountered a prefix sum of zero at least once?\n          for x in a:\n              total += x\n              if total < 0:\n                  # we break early and say no?\n                  # but we don't break, we just set a flag? Actually, we can break and then later check total==0?\n                  # The code snippet has: if total < 0 or (total !=0 and allzeros): then what? \n\n          Actually, the intended solution is:\n\n          Conditions:\n            1. The total sum must be 0.\n            2. The prefix sums must be non-negative at every step.\n            3. We cannot have a positive prefix after a zero prefix? \n\n          Why condition 3? Because if we have a zero prefix at some point, that means we have \"closed\" a segment. The operations that happened in the prefix are balanced and the pointer is back at 0. Then the rest of the array must be zero? Actually, no: we can have more operations? \n\n          But note: the problem says the pointer must be at the first element at the end. So if we ever come back to 0 (so prefix sum becomes 0 at index i), then the rest of the array must be processed without leaving the segment [0, i]? Actually, we can leave again? \n\n          However, the known solution for the problem \"Candies\" (Codeforces Round #756 (Div. 3), problem C) is:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                s = 0\n                ok = True\n                seen_zero = False\n                for i in range(n):\n                    s += a[i]\n                    if s < 0:\n                        ok = False\n                    if s == 0:\n                        seen_zero = True\n                    if seen_zero and s != 0:\n                        ok = False\n                if s != 0:\n                    ok = False\n                print(\"Yes\" if ok else \"No\")\n\n          But note: the problem statement says that the array can have negative values? And the example: \n            Example 2: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> but wait, the example in the note: \n                The second test case: n=4, a = [1, 1, 1, 1] -> but the example operation sequence leads to [2, -1, -1, 0]? \n\n          Actually, the example in the note: \n                The second test case: \n                    Input: 4\n                            1 1 1 1\n                    Output: 6 (for the first problem) but here we are solving a different problem? \n\n          This problem: We are given an array a and we have to check if it can be obtained.\n\n          The example in the note of the problem: \n                One way of obtaining the array in the second test case (which is [2, -1, -1, 0]?) is shown.\n\n          But the input says: the second test case has n=4 and the array [1,1,1,1]? \n\n          Actually, the problem has two different problems? The first one (program1) is about maximizing the number of candies eaten, and the second (program2) is about checking if the array a can be obtained.\n\n          The example in the note for program2: \n                \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\" -> so that test case is invalid? \n\n          Actually, the problem says: \"after we are done, the pointer has to be on the first element\". So the first test case in the example must be invalid? \n\n          The note says: \n            \"In the first test case we can obtain the array after some operations, but the pointer won't be on the first element.\"\n\n          So the first test case is a \"No\".\n\n          The second test case: \n            n=4, a = [2, -1, -1, 0] -> valid? \n\n          How does the known solution work for [2, -1, -1, 0]?\n            prefix[0] = 2 -> nonnegative, and not zero -> seen_zero remains False.\n            prefix[1] = 2 + (-1) = 1 -> nonnegative, not zero -> seen_zero remains False.\n            prefix[2] = 1 + (-1) = 0 -> seen_zero becomes True.\n            prefix[3] = 0 + 0 = 0 -> but then we have seen_zero and now we have 0? that's allowed? \n\n          However, the condition in the known solution: \n            if seen_zero and s != 0: then fail.\n\n          At index3: s=0, so we don't trigger the condition. \n\n          And total s=0 -> so it would print \"Yes\".\n\n          But the example also says: \n            \"One way of obtaining the array in the second test case is shown\" -> so it's valid.\n\n          What about [1, -1, 1]?\n            prefix[0]=1 -> not zero, seen_zero=False -> okay.\n            prefix[1]=0 -> seen_zero=True -> okay.\n            prefix[2]=1 -> now we have seen_zero and then a non-zero -> condition triggers: fail.\n\n          Why is [1,-1,1] invalid?\n            We start at index0. \n            We can do:\n                Right move: a[0] becomes 1, then at index1.\n                Then we do a left move: at index1 we subtract 1 -> a[1] becomes -1, then move to index0.\n                Now we are at index0. Then we do a right move: a[0] becomes 2, then index1.\n                Then we do a right move: a[1] becomes -1+1=0, then index2.\n                Then we are at index2. We cannot do a right move (because last element) so we must do a left move? \n                    Then we subtract 1 at index2 -> becomes 0, then move to index1.\n                Then at index1, we can do a right move? but then we go to index2 again? \n                How do we get back to 0? \n\n            Alternatively, we can try:\n                Start: [0,0,0] at index0.\n                Operation1: [1,0,0] -> index1.\n                Operation2: [1,-1,0] -> index0.\n                Now we are at 0. Then we do a right move: [2,-1,0] -> index1.\n                Then we do a left move: [2,-2,0] -> index0. -> then we are at 0 and the array is [2,-2,0] -> not [1,-1,1].\n\n            How to get [1,-1,1]?\n                We need to have a[0]=1, a[1]=-1, a[2]=1.\n\n            After the first two moves: [1,-1,0] and we are at 0. Then we want to get the last element to 1? \n                We can go: \n                    from 0: right to 1: [2,-1,0] -> at 1.\n                    then right to 2: [2,0,0] -> at 2. \n                    then we are at 2: we can only do left? \n                    then left: [2,0,-1] -> at 1.\n                    then left: [2,-1,-1] -> at 0. -> [2,-1,-1] -> not [1,-1,1].\n\n            It seems difficult. \n\n            Actually, the known solution says [1,-1,1] is invalid because after the prefix becomes 0 at index1, we then get a positive prefix at index2.\n\n          Therefore, the conditions are:\n            Condition 1: total sum must be 0.\n            Condition 2: every prefix sum must be >=0.\n            Condition 3: once we have encountered a zero in the prefix, then all subsequent prefix sums must be zero.\n\n          Why condition 3? Because if we have a zero at some prefix, that means we have returned to the start (index0) at some point. Then the rest of the array must be built without leaving the start? But note: we can leave again? \n\n          However, the problem requires that at the end we are at the start. So if we have a zero prefix at index i, then we are at index0. Then we can start a new journey? But note: the array is fixed. The operations we do after that would start from 0 and then we would have to come back. But the array values for indices beyond i are fixed. How can we have non-zero values beyond i without leaving 0? We must leave 0 again. Then the prefix from 0 to j (j>i) would be the sum of the entire segment from 0 to j, which includes the part from 0 to i (which is 0) and then the segment from i+1 to j. But then the prefix at j is the sum of the segment from 0 to j, which is the same as the sum from i+1 to j. However, we are not allowed to have a positive prefix again? \n\n          Actually, the known solution in the code snippet we are to complete:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            allzeros = False\n            total = 0\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                total += x\n                if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                    # We break out of the loop? and then we set a flag? \n                    # Actually, we can break and then remember that it's invalid?\n                    # But we must check the entire array? \n                    # We can break and set total to a non-zero value so that at the end we print 'NO'\n                    # How? We can set total = 1 (so that it becomes non-zero) and break? \n                    # Or we can set a flag and break, and then at the end check the flag and total==0.\n                    # The code snippet doesn't do anything in the if body? We have to complete it.\n\n          The intended logic:\n\n            We traverse the array and compute the prefix sum (total so far).\n\n            If at any point the prefix sum becomes negative -> invalid.\n\n            If we have already seen a zero (meaning we had a prefix sum zero at some earlier index) and then we get a non-zero prefix -> invalid.\n\n          Then at the end, we require the total to be zero.\n\n          So we can break the loop and set a flag to indicate failure? But the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can break early.\n\n          How to break? We can set total to a non-zero value and break? Or we can set a flag and then break, and then at the end we check the flag and total.\n\n          The code snippet:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We want to mark as invalid and break? \n                # But we are in a loop. We can set total to -1 (so that at the end it's not zero) and break? \n                # Or we can set a variable 'valid' to False and break, but the code doesn't have that.\n\n          Alternatively, we can set total to 1 (so that it becomes non-zero) and break? Then at the end we check total==0.\n\n          But note: we are adding x to total. If we break, we haven't read the entire array? The problem says the total n over test cases is bounded, but we are in the middle of the array. We can break and skip the rest of the array? \n\n          The problem: we are guaranteed that the sum of n over test cases is <=200000, so we can break and then skip the rest of the array? \n\n          How about:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We set total to -1 (so that it fails the final check) and break the loop.\n                total = -1\n                break\n\n          But then we have to skip the rest of the array? The input for the test case has n integers. We have read only part of them. We must read the entire line? \n\n          The code: \n            for x in map(int, input().split()): \n          So we are iterating over the entire list. We cannot break the input? Actually, we can break the for loop and the rest of the numbers are not processed? But the input is already read. So we can break the loop and then the rest of the numbers are not added to total? \n\n          But then the total we have is only the prefix until the break. We set total=-1 and break. Then at the end we check: if total==0 -> no, so we print 'NO'. \n\n          However, what if we break because of the condition and then the total we set to -1, but the actual total might be zero? We don't care because we broke due to an intermediate condition.\n\n          But note: the condition (total !=0 and allzeros) might occur and then we break, but the total at that point is non-zero and we set it to -1. Then we break. Then we don't process the rest. Then at the end we check total==0? It's -1 -> so we print 'NO'. \n\n          Alternatively, we can set a flag:\n\n            valid = True\n            for x in ...:\n                ...\n                if condition:\n                    valid = False\n                    break   # but we break the loop\n\n            Then at the end: if valid and total==0: print YES, else NO.\n\n          But the code snippet doesn't have that. It only has:\n\n            print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO')\n\n          So we must set total to a non-zero value if we break? \n\n          How about:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                # We set total to 1 (so that it becomes non-zero) and break? \n                total = 1\n                break\n\n          But then if we break because total<0, we set total=1 and break -> then we print 'NO'. \n          If we break because (total !=0 and allzeros), we set total=1 and break -> then we print 'NO'.\n\n          However, what if we break and then the total was negative? We set it to 1, but then we break and then we don't process the rest. Then the condition at the end: total==0? -> no, so we print 'NO'. \n\n          But what if we break because of negative? Then we don't care about the rest. \n\n          However, what if we break because of (total !=0 and allzeros) and then the rest of the array is such that the total becomes zero? But we break early and set total=1, so we print 'NO'. That's correct because the condition is violated.\n\n          But note: the condition (total !=0 and allzeros) is only checked at the current step. We break and then the rest of the array is not processed. But the condition for the entire array must be that the total is zero. However, we broke because we saw a non-zero after a zero, which is invalid. So we don't care about the rest.\n\n          However, we must read the entire input? The problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, but if we break early we skip the rest of the current array? That's acceptable.\n\n          But the input for the test case is given in one line. We are reading the entire line at the beginning: \n\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n\n          So we are iterating over the list. If we break, we stop the iteration. The rest of the numbers in the list are not processed. That's acceptable.\n\n          However, we must not break the entire test case? We are only breaking the inner loop.\n\n          So the plan:\n\n            We have:\n                n = int(input())\n                arr = list of n integers (we are iterating over them)\n\n            We set:\n                total = 0\n                allzeros = False   # to track if we have ever encountered a zero prefix so far\n\n            For each x in arr:\n                total += x\n                if total < 0:\n                    # invalid: set total to 1 and break\n                    total = 1   # so that at the end we get non-zero\n                    break\n                if allzeros and total != 0:\n                    total = 1\n                    break\n                if total == 0:\n                    allzeros = True\n\n            Then at the end: \n                if total == 0: print('YES')\n                else: print('NO')\n\n          But note: the condition \"allzeros and total !=0\" must be checked after we update total? \n\n          However, we can combine:\n\n            if total < 0 or (allzeros and total != 0):\n                total = 1\n                break\n\n            Then update allzeros: \n                if total == 0: allzeros = True   -> but note: if we break, we skip this.\n\n          But what if we break? Then we skip the update. \n\n          Also, note: we update allzeros only when total==0. \n\n          Example: \n            [0,0,0]: \n                step1: x=0 -> total=0 -> then check: total<0? no. then (allzeros and total!=0) -> allzeros is False -> skip. Then set allzeros = True (because total==0).\n                step2: x=0 -> total=0 -> condition: total<0? no. then (allzeros and total!=0) -> allzeros is True and total==0 -> false. Then set allzeros remains True (but it's already True).\n                step3: same.\n\n            Then total=0 -> YES.\n\n          Example: [1, -1, 1]:\n                step0: allzeros=False, total=0.\n                step1: x=1 -> total=1 -> condition: 1<0? no. (allzeros and 1!=0) -> false. Then set allzeros: total!=0 -> skip. allzeros remains False.\n                step2: x=-1 -> total=0 -> condition: 0<0? no. (allzeros and 0!=0) -> false. Then set allzeros = True (because total==0).\n                step3: x=1 -> total=1 -> condition: 1<0? no. (allzeros and 1!=0) -> true -> set total=1 and break.\n\n            Then we break and then print 'NO' because total=1.\n\n          Example: [2, -1, -1, 0]:\n                step0: allzeros=False, total=0.\n                step1: x=2 -> total=2 -> condition: false. allzeros remains False.\n                step2: x=-1 -> total=1 -> condition: false. allzeros remains False.\n                step3: x=-1 -> total=0 -> condition: false. set allzeros=True.\n                step4: x=0 -> total=0 -> condition: (0<0 -> false) and (allzeros and 0!=0 -> false) -> then set allzeros remains True (but already true).\n                Then total=0 -> YES.\n\n          Example: [0, 0, 0, 1, -1]:\n                step0: total=0 -> condition: false. set allzeros=True.\n                step1: x=0 -> total=0 -> condition: (0<0 false) and (allzeros and 0!=0 -> false) -> then update: allzeros remains True.\n                step2: x=0 -> same.\n                step3: x=1 -> total=1 -> condition: (1<0 false) and (allzeros and 1!=0 -> true) -> break, set total=1 -> then print NO.\n\n          Why is [0,0,0,1,-1] invalid? \n            We start at 0. \n            We have a[0]=0: we don't do any move? Then we are at 0. Then we have a[1]=0: again, we don't do any move? Then a[2]=0: same. Then a[3]=1: we must have done a right move from 3 to 4? but then we are at 4. Then we do a left move from 4 to 3: subtract 1 at 4 -> becomes -1? but then a[4] becomes -1? \n            How do we get a[3]=1 and a[4]=-1? \n            We start at 0. \n            We do nothing until we are at 0. Then we want to set a[3]=1 and a[4]=-1? \n            We must go from 0 to 3: \n                Right from 0->1: a[0] becomes 1? but we need a[0]=0 -> so we cannot do that.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n                We are at 0: we do nothing -> a[0] remains 0? \n                Then we do a right move: a[0] becomes 1 -> but we need 0 -> so we cannot.\n\n            How about: \n                We do a right move from 0: a[0] becomes 1 -> then we are at 1.\n                Then we do a right move from 1: a[1] becomes 1 -> then at 2.\n                Then we do a right move from 2: a[2] becomes 1 -> then at 3.\n                Then we do a right move from 3: a[3] becomes 1 -> then at 4.\n                Then we do a left move from 4: a[4] becomes -1 -> then at 3.\n                Then we do a left move from 3: a[3] becomes 0 -> then at 2.\n                Then we do a left move from 2: a[2] becomes 0 -> then at 1.\n                Then we do a left move from 1: a[1] becomes 0 -> then at 0.\n\n            Then the array becomes: [1,0,0,0,-1] -> not [0,0,0,1,-1].\n\n            How to get [0,0,0,1,-1]? \n                We must not touch the first three? \n                We start at 0: we do nothing? \n                Then we go to 3? without leaving a trace? \n\n            It seems impossible. \n\n          Therefore, the solution is:\n\n            We break the loop and set total=1 (so that we print 'NO') if at any step:\n                - the prefix sum becomes negative, OR\n                - we have already seen a zero prefix and then the current prefix is non-zero.\n\n          Then we require the total to be zero at the end.\n\n          But note: what if we break because of negative? Then we set total=1 and break. Then we print 'NO'. \n\n          However, what if we break because of negative and then the rest of the array is such that the total becomes zero? But we break early and set total=1, so we print 'NO'. That's acceptable because the prefix became negative which is invalid.\n\n          Therefore, we complete the code as:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                total = 1   # we set to non-zero to force NO, but note: we break so we don't process the rest\n                break\n\n          But wait: what if we break because of negative and then the total we set to 1, but the actual total (if we had continued) might have become negative? We don't care because we already broke.\n\n          However, we are setting total=1 arbitrarily. But we break and then we don't process the rest. Then we check total==0? -> no, so we print 'NO'. \n\n          But what if we break because of negative and then the rest of the array is positive and brings the total to zero? But the condition says we break at the first negative prefix. And the problem requires that every prefix is nonnegative. So we break at the first negative and then we don't care about the rest.\n\n          Therefore, the code for program2.py is:\n\n            input = __import__('sys').stdin.readline\n\n            def solve():\n                n = int(input())\n                allzeros = False\n                total = 0\n                arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                # We'll iterate over the array\n                for x in arr:\n                    total += x\n                    if total < 0:\n                        total = 1   # to force non-zero at the end\n                        break\n                    if allzeros and total != 0:\n                        total = 1\n                        break\n                    if total == 0:\n                        allzeros = True\n                # Now, if we broke, total is 1 -> then we print 'NO'. Otherwise, if we didn't break, then we require total==0 to print 'YES'\n                print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO')\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                solve()\n\n          However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so we are safe.\n\n          But wait: what if we break early? Then we skip the rest of the array. The input for the test case has n integers. We read the entire line at once? \n\n          The line: \n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n          reads the entire line. So we are not saving time by breaking the loop? But the problem says the total n over test cases is bounded by 200000, so it's acceptable.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can read the entire array for each test case.\n\n          But note: the problem says \"the sum of n\", meaning the total number of elements in all test cases is <=200000. So we can read each test case and process.\n\n          But in our solution, we break early so we don't process the entire array? That's acceptable.\n\n          However, we are reading the entire array at the beginning: \n\n            arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n          So we are reading all n integers for the test case. Then we break the loop. But that's okay.\n\n          Alternatively, we can avoid reading the entire array at once? But the problem says the total n is bounded, so it's acceptable.\n\n          But the problem says: the total n over test cases is 200000, so we can read the entire array.\n\n          Therefore, we complete the code as above.\n\n          However, the provided code snippet in the problem does not read the entire array at once? It uses:\n\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n\n          So we can do:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            allzeros = False\n            total = 0\n            for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                total += x\n                if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                    total = 1\n                    break\n                if total == 0:\n                    allzeros = True\n\n            print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO')\n\n          This is efficient because we break early and skip the rest of the numbers in the current test case.\n\n          But note: the input is read as a whole line? The map object will read the entire line? Then we break the for loop, so we don't process the rest of the numbers? But the entire line is read by the input().split()? \n\n          Yes, the entire line is read and split into a list of strings, then we iterate over the map. But we break the loop so we don't process the entire list? But the entire list is created in memory. \n\n          Since the total n over test cases is 200000, it's acceptable.\n\n          Therefore, we complete the code for program2.py as above.\n\n          Now, what about program1.py?\n\n          We are to solve: \n            There are n candies. Alice eats from the left (a contiguous segment from the left), Bob from the right (a contiguous segment from the right). They cannot overlap. They want the total weight eaten to be equal. What is the maximum total number of candies they can eat?\n\n          Input: \n            t test cases. For each test case:\n                n: number of candies\n                list of n integers: weights w1, w2, ..., wn\n\n          Output: \n            For each test case, the maximum total number of candies (so Alice's count + Bob's count) such that the total weight of Alice's candies equals the total weight of Bob's candies.\n\n          Example: \n            n=3, [1,1,1] -> \n                Alice can take the first candy (1) and Bob the last candy (1) -> total=2.\n                Or Alice takes the first two (1+1=2) and Bob takes the last one (1) -> not equal.\n                Or Alice takes the first one and Bob takes the last two -> not equal.\n                So answer=2.\n\n          How to solve?\n            We are to choose an integer i (number of candies Alice eats) and an integer j (number of candies Bob eats) such that:\n                i>=0, j>=0, i+j <= n, and the segment Alice eats: [0, i-1] and Bob eats [n-j, n-1] (and they don't overlap: so i+j<=n) and \n                sum(a[0:i]) = sum(a[n-j:n])\n\n            We want to maximize i+j.\n\n          Constraints: \n            t up to 10000, but the total n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n          We cannot try all i and j (which would be O(n^2)).\n\n          We can use two pointers:\n\n            Let left = 0, right = n-1.\n            Let sum_left = 0, sum_right = 0.\n            Let ans = 0.\n\n            We can try to extend the left until we meet the right. But note: we are allowed to take non-overlapping segments.\n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            We traverse the prefix sums and store the prefix sums in a set (or a dictionary) for the left part. Then we traverse the suffix sums and check if the suffix sum is in the prefix set. Then we can update the total candies = (i+1) + (j+1) for the prefix at index i and suffix at index j (where the suffix j is from the right: j = n-1-index).\n\n          Steps:\n\n            Precompute prefix sums: \n                prefix[i] = w0 + w1 + ... + w_i   for i from 0 to n-1.\n\n            Precompute suffix sums:\n                suffix[i] = w_i + w_{i+1} + ... + w_{n-1}   for i from 0 to n-1? \n                But we want the suffix starting from the right: \n                    Let suffix[j] = w_{n-1} + w_{n-2} + ... + w_j   for j from n-1 down to 0.\n\n            But note: we want the sum of the segment that Bob eats: from index j to n-1? Actually, Bob eats from the right: the last j candies? \n                Bob's segment: from index n-j to n-1? Actually, if Bob eats j candies, then the segment is [n-j, n-1]. The sum = suffix_sum[n-j] (if we define suffix_sum[i] as the sum from i to n-1).\n\n            But we want to match: \n                prefix[i-1] = suffix_sum[n-j]   (if Alice eats i candies: indices 0 to i-1, Bob eats j candies: indices n-j to n-1)\n\n            And we require that i-1 < n-j (so the segments don't overlap) -> i+j <= n.\n\n            We want to maximize i+j.\n\n          How to do it fast?\n\n            We can precompute:\n                prefix = [0]\n                for i in range(n):\n                    prefix.append(prefix[-1] + w[i])\n\n                suffix = [0] * (n+1)\n                for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                    suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\n\n            Then we want to find indices i and j (with i from 0 to n, j from 0 to n, and i+j<=n) such that:\n                prefix[i] = suffix[n-j]   (note: prefix[i] = sum of first i elements, suffix[n-j] = sum of the last j elements: from index n-j to n-1)\n\n            And we want to maximize i+j.\n\n          But note: we can also consider j from 0 to n, and then for each j, we check if there exists an i (0<=i<=n-j) such that prefix[i] = suffix[n-j]. Then the total candies = i+j.\n\n          We can do:\n\n            Let ans = 0.\n            Create a dictionary that maps prefix[i] to the largest i (or the i itself) for which prefix[i] is achieved? But note: we want the largest i for a given prefix? Actually, we want the maximum i+j, so for a fixed j, we want the largest i such that prefix[i] = suffix[n-j] and i<=n-j-1? (because the segments don't overlap: i<=n-j-1? Actually, the segments are [0, i-1] and [n-j, n-1]. The condition for non-overlap: i <= n-j. But if i = n-j, then the segment Alice eats is [0, n-j-1] and Bob eats [n-j, n-1] -> they are adjacent, which is allowed. So i can be from 0 to n-j.\n\n          Actually, the condition: the segments are disjoint if i <= n-j. So we require i in [0, n-j].\n\n          We can precompute:\n\n            Let d = {}\n            For i from 0 to n:   (prefix[0] to prefix[n])\n                We store the maximum i for which prefix[i] = s? Actually, we want the maximum i for a given s? But note: we want to maximize i+j, so for a fixed j, we want the largest i (so that we get the largest i+j) for the given s. But we can store for each s the maximum i that we have seen so far? \n\n            However, we traverse i from 0 to n, and we want i to be as large as possible? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do:\n\n            Traverse j from 0 to n (j: the number of candies Bob eats, so the suffix sum = suffix[n-j] = total of the last j candies). Then we look for the same value in the prefix sums for i in the range [0, n-j]. We want the maximum i for which prefix[i] = suffix[n-j] and i<=n-j.\n\n          How to do that fast? We can precompute a dictionary that maps the prefix sum value to the list of indices i? Then for each j, we look up the list and then find the maximum i that is <= n-j? Then update ans = max(ans, i+j).\n\n          But the total n is 200000, and the total over test cases is 200000, but if we do a binary search for each j, that would be O(n log n) per test case? The total n over test cases is 200000, so worst-case one test case with n=200000 -> O(n log n) which is acceptable? \n\n          But note: t can be up to 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the maximum n per test case might be 200000, but the number of test cases t is at most 10000, but the sum of n is 200000, so the maximum t is 10000, but the average n is 200000/10000 = 20? So we can do O(n log n) per test case? Actually, worst-case one test case with n=200000 -> then O(n log n) is acceptable (200000 * log2(200000) ~ 200000 * 18 = 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton).\n\n          But note: we have multiple test cases, and the total n is 200000, so the worst-case test case might be one test case with n=200000. Then we do one O(n log n) which is acceptable.\n\n          Steps for one test case:\n\n            n = int(input())\n            w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n            # Precompute prefix: prefix[i] for i in range(0, n+1)\n            prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n            for i in range(1, n+1):\n                prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\n\n            # Precompute suffix: suffix[i] for i in range(0, n+1): suffix[i] = sum from i to n-1\n            suffix = [0]*(n+2)   # we can do n+1\n            # suffix[i] = w[i] + w[i+1] + ... + w[n-1]\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\n\n            # But note: the suffix for the last j candies: we want the sum of the last j candies = suffix[n-j] (because the last j candies are from index n-j to n-1).\n\n            # We want to build a dictionary for prefix: \n            #   We want for each sum s, the maximum index i (in the range [0, n]) such that prefix[i] = s.\n            #   But note: we require i<=n-j for a given j. However, we can store the maximum i for each s? But that maximum i might be beyond n-j. So we need the maximum i that is <= n-j? \n\n            # Alternatively, we can precompute an array for the prefix sums and then for each j we do a lookup? \n\n            # Instead, we can do:\n            #   Create a dictionary: d = {}\n            #   For i from 0 to n:\n            #       s = prefix[i]\n            #       d[s] = i   # we store the largest i? but we traverse i increasing, so the last i for a given s is the largest? \n            #   But note: we want the largest i for a given s? But if we traverse from 0 to n, then the last occurrence of s is stored. However, we want the largest i (which is the last one). \n\n            # However, what if the same sum appears multiple times? We want the largest i for which prefix[i]=s. So we can do:\n\n            d = {}\n            for i in range(0, n+1):\n                s = prefix[i]\n                # We store the maximum i for s? \n                # But if we traverse from 0 to n, then the last i for s is the largest. So we can do:\n                d[s] = i   # this will store the last occurrence of s? \n\n            # But note: we require i<=n-j. Then for a given j, we look up s = suffix[n-j] in d. If it exists, then we have a candidate: i = d[s] and then total candies = i + j, provided that i<=n-j? \n\n            # But what if d[s] is greater than n-j? Then we cannot use it. \n\n            # How to get the maximum i that is <= n-j? We would need to store all the indices? Then for each j we do a binary search? \n\n            # Alternatively, we can iterate j from 0 to n, and for each j we check if suffix[n-j] is in d and if d[suffix[n-j]] <= n-j? \n            # But note: we stored the largest i for each s. If the largest i is <= n-j, then we can use it. But what if there is a smaller i? Then we don't care because we want to maximize i+j, and a smaller i would give a smaller total. \n\n            # However, it is possible that the same s appears at multiple indices. We stored the largest i. But if the largest i is greater than n-j, then we cannot use it. But there might be a smaller i that is <= n-j? \n\n            # Example: \n            #   prefix = [0,1,0,1]   (n=3)\n            #   Then for s=0: we stored i=2 (the last occurrence) and for s=1: i=3.\n            #   Now, for j=1: we look at suffix[n-1] = suffix[3]? \n            #       Actually, suffix: \n            #           suffix[0] = w0+w1+w2\n            #           suffix[1] = w1+w2\n            #           suffix[2] = w2\n            #           suffix[3] = 0\n            #       So for j=1: the last 1 candy: suffix[n-1] = suffix[3]? -> no, j=1: we want the last 1 candy: that is w2, so suffix[2] = w2.\n            #   How do we compute the suffix for the last j candies? \n            #       Let j=1: then the last 1 candy: index2 -> sum = w2.\n            #       j=2: last 2 candies: w1+w2 -> suffix[1]?\n            #       j=3: w0+w1+w2 -> suffix[0]?\n            #   So the suffix for the last j candies is suffix[n-j] (if we define suffix[i] as the sum from index i to n-1). \n\n            #   Therefore, for j=1: s = suffix[3-1] = suffix[2] = w2.\n            #   Then we look up w2 in d: we want an i such that prefix[i] = w2 and i<= n-j = 3-1=2.\n            #   But we stored for w2: if w2 is 0, then we have i=2. Then total = 2+1=3.\n\n            #   But what if w2=1? Then we look for s=1 in d: we have i=3 (from prefix[3]=1) but 3<=2? no. Then we cannot use it. But there is a prefix[1]=1? which is <=2 -> then we can use i=1? \n\n            #   However, we stored only the last occurrence. We lost the information of the first occurrence.\n\n            # Therefore, we need to store the maximum i for each s that is <= n-j? But we don't know j in advance.\n\n          Alternative approach:\n\n            We can iterate j from 0 to n, and for each j, we want to know the maximum i (<= n-j) such that prefix[i] = suffix[n-j]. \n\n            We can precompute for each prefix sum s, the list of indices i (with the prefix sum s) and then for each j we do a binary search in that list for the largest i <= n-j. Then candidate = i+j.\n\n            Steps:\n\n              d = defaultdict(list)\n              for i in range(0, n+1):\n                  s = prefix[i]\n                  d[s].append(i)   # we store the index i\n\n              Then for each list, we sort it? Actually, we are traversing i in increasing order, so the list is sorted.\n\n              Then for j in range(0, n+1):\n                  s = suffix[n-j]   # the sum of the last j candies\n                  if s in d:\n                      # we want the largest i in d[s] that is <= n-j\n                      # we can do a binary search in d[s] for the largest number <= n-j\n                      arr = d[s]\n                      # binary search: \n                      lo, hi = 0, len(arr)-1\n                      candidate_index = -1\n                      while lo<=hi:\n                          mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                          if arr[mid] <= n-j:\n                              candidate_index = arr[mid]\n                              lo = mid+1\n                          else:\n                              hi = mid-1\n                      if candidate_index != -1:\n                          ans = max(ans, candidate_index + j)\n\n              But note: j can be 0? then we are taking 0 candies from the right, and we look for an i such that prefix[i] = suffix[n] (which is 0) and i<=n. Then candidate_index = the largest i such that prefix[i]=0 -> which is the last i with prefix[i]=0. Then total = i+0 = i. But we want the maximum total candies? \n\n          However, we must consider that the segments must be non-overlapping. When j=0, Bob eats 0 candies, then Alice can eat up to the entire array? But then the condition: prefix[i] = suffix[n] = 0? only if the entire array sums to 0? \n\n          Actually, suffix[n] = 0 (by our definition: suffix[n] = sum from index n to n-1 -> 0). So we are looking for prefix[i]=0. Then we can have i=0: then total=0, or i= some index where prefix[i]=0. Then total = i+0 = i. \n\n          But note: we are maximizing the total candies. So we take the largest i such that prefix[i]=0 and i<=n (which is always true) -> then total = i. \n\n          But is that valid? Alice eats the first i candies and Bob eats 0. Then the total weight Alice ate is 0? only if prefix[i]=0. Then it's valid. \n\n          Similarly, we can have j>0.\n\n          However, we must note: the entire array might be negative? But the problem says weights are positive? The input says: w_i>=1? \n\n          Actually, the input says: \"1<=w_i<=10000\", so all weights are positive. Then prefix[i] is increasing. Then the only prefix[i]=0 is when i=0. \n\n          Therefore, for j=0: candidate = 0.\n\n          But what about j>0? \n\n          Example: [1,1,1] -> n=3\n            prefix: [0,1,2,3]\n            suffix: \n                suffix[0] = 1+1+1=3\n                suffix[1] = 1+1=2\n                suffix[2] = 1\n                suffix[3] = 0\n\n            d:\n                d[0] = [0]\n                d[1] = [1]\n                d[2] = [2]\n                d[3] = [3]\n\n            j=0: s = suffix[3] = 0 -> candidate: i in d[0] -> [0] -> candidate_index=0 -> total=0.\n            j=1: s = suffix[2] = 1 -> candidate: i in d[1] -> [1] -> 1<= n-j = 3-1=2 -> true -> total=1+1=2.\n            j=2: s = suffix[1] = 2 -> candidate: i in d[2] -> [2] -> 2<=3-2=1 -> false -> skip.\n            j=3: s = suffix[0]=3 -> candidate: i in d[3] -> [3] -> 3<=0 -> false.\n\n            Then ans = max(0,2)=2.\n\n          Example: [1,2,3,3,2,1] -> \n            prefix: [0,1,3,6,9,11,12]\n            suffix: \n                suffix[0]=12, suffix[1]=11, suffix[2]=9, suffix[3]=6, suffix[4]=3, suffix[5]=1, suffix[6]=0\n\n            We want to match:\n                j=0: s=0 -> i=0 -> total=0.\n                j=1: s=1 -> i=1: 1<=5? yes -> total=1+1=2.\n                j=2: s=3 -> i=2: 2<=4? yes -> total=2+2=4.\n                j=3: s=6 -> i=3: 3<=3? yes -> total=3+3=6.\n                j=4: s=9 -> i=4: 4<=2? no -> skip.\n                j=5: s=11 -> i=5: 5<=1? no -> skip.\n                j=6: s=12 -> i=6: 6<=0? no -> skip.\n\n            Then ans=6.\n\n          But is 6 valid? \n            Alice eats the first 3 candies: 1+2+3=6.\n            Bob eats the last 3 candies: 3+2+1=6.\n            And they are adjacent? \n                Alice: indices0,1,2 -> [1,2,3] -> sum=6.\n                Bob: indices3,4,5 -> [3,2,1] -> sum=6.\n            And they don't overlap? \n                Alice: [0,2], Bob: [3,5] -> non-overlapping -> valid.\n\n          Therefore, the algorithm for program1.py:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                w = list(map(int, input().split()))\n                prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n                for i in range(1, n+1):\n                    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\n\n                suffix = [0]*(n+2)\n                for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                    suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\n\n                # Build dictionary for prefix: for each sum, list of indices (which are from 0 to n)\n                from collections import defaultdict\n                d = defaultdict(list)\n                for i in range(0, n+1):\n                    d[prefix[i]].append(i)\n\n                # We'll iterate j from 0 to n (j: number of candies Bob eats)\n                ans = 0\n                for j in range(0, n+1):\n                    s = suffix[n-j]   # the sum of the last j candies\n                    if s in d:\n                        # We have a list of indices i for which prefix[i] = s.\n                        arr = d[s]\n                        # We want the largest i in arr that is <= n - j\n                        # Since arr is sorted (because we built by increasing i), we can do a binary search for the last element <= n-j.\n                        lo, hi = 0, len(arr)-1\n                        candidate_index = -1\n                        while lo<=hi:\n                            mid = (lo+hi)//2\n                            if arr[mid] <= n - j:\n                                candidate_index = arr[mid]\n                                lo = mid+1\n                            else:\n                                hi = mid-1\n                        if candidate_index != -1:\n                            # candidate_index is the largest i such that prefix[i]=s and i<=n-j.\n                            # Then total candies = candidate_index (from Alice) + j (from Bob)\n                            if candidate_index + j <= n:   # this is always true because candidate_index<=n-j -> candidate_index+j<=n\n                                ans = max(ans, candidate_index + j)\n                print(ans)\n\n          But note: the condition candidate_index+j<=n is redundant because candidate_index<=n-j -> candidate_index+j<=n.\n\n          However, we must note: the segments must be non-overlapping. The condition candidate_index<=n-j ensures that the last candy Alice eats (at index candidate_index-1) is strictly less than the first candy Bob eats (at index n-j). So they are disjoint.\n\n          But what if candidate_index = n-j? Then Alice eats [0, candidate_index-1] and Bob eats [n-j, n-1] = [candidate_index, n-1] -> adjacent, which is allowed.\n\n          Therefore, we can remove the redundant check.\n\n          But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, and we are doing a binary search for each j (which is n+1 iterations). The total work per test case is O(n log n). Since the total n over test cases is 200000, the worst-case one test case with n=200000 -> O(n log n) = 200000 * log2(200000) ~ 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Python.\n\n          However, worst-case the dictionary d might have one key with many indices? But the total number of indices is n+1, so the binary search over one key's list would be O(log n) per j, and we do n+1 j's -> O(n log n).\n\n          But note: the same key might appear many times? Then the binary search for that key is O(log (frequency)) per j. But the total over j is O(n log n). \n\n          However, worst-case if all prefix[i] are the same? Then the list for that key has n+1 elements. Then each binary search is O(log n) and we do n+1 binary searches -> O(n log n). \n\n          Therefore, the code for program1.py is as above.\n\n          But note: we must be cautious: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case one test case with n=200000 -> 200000*log2(200000) is about 3.6e6, which is acceptable in Pyton in 1 second? Probably.\n\n          However, we can optimize by not iterating j from 0 to n? We can break early? \n\n          Alternatively, we can iterate i from 0 to n, and then for each i, we want to find j such that suffix[n-j] = prefix[i] and j<=n-i. Then candidate = i+j. Then we can do similarly: build a dictionary for suffix and then for each i, we look for the largest j such that suffix[n-j] = prefix[i] and j<=n-i? \n\n          But it's symmetric.\n\n          We'll do as above.\n\n          But note: the problem says the total n over test cases is 200000, so we do one O(n log n) per test case, and the total n over test cases is 200000, but note: the sum of n is 200000, so the number of test cases t is at most 10000, but the sum of the sizes is 200000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=200000. \n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            For program1.py: the code above.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks\". \n\n          The provided program1.py is:\n\n            # (we are not given any code for program1.py? The problem says \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\")\n\n          But in the problem statement, we are only given the description and the code for program2.py (with a TODO). For program1.py, we are not given any starting code? \n\n          The problem says: \"Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem\" for program1.py and then for program2.py.\n\n          And then: \"Output Format: Return json with the following structure: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\"\n\n          So we must output the entire code for program1.py? But the problem says \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n          However, the problem says: \"with missing lines or blocks\", so we are to fill in the missing parts. But for program1.py, we are not given any starting code? \n\n          Looking back: \n\n            # program1.py\n            Complete the code in python to solve this programming problem:\n\n            ... (description)\n\n            Input Specification: ...\n\n            Output Specification: ...\n\n            Notes: ...\n\n            Code:   # but there is no code provided for program1.py? \n\n          The problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n          But in the problem statement, only program2.py is provided with a TODO. \n\n          Therefore, for program1.py, we must write the entire code? \n\n          But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". \n\n          How to interpret? \n\n          Since program1.py is not provided, we assume we have to write the entire code? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n          Alternatively, the problem might have intended to provide a skeleton for program1.py? \n\n          But it is not provided. \n\n          We'll assume that for program1.py we write the entire code, and for program2.py we complete the TODO.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\"\n\n          But then how? \n\n          The output format is: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n          For program2.py, we are given:\n\n            input = __import__('sys').stdin.readline\n\n            def solve():\n                n = int(input())\n                allzeros = False\n                total = 0\n                for x in map(int, input().split()):\n                    total += x\n                    if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                    allzeros = allzeros or total == 0\n\n                print('YES' if total == 0 else 'NO')\n\n            for _ in range(int(input())):\n                solve()\n\n          We are to complete the TODO block.\n\n          For program1.py, we are not given any code? Then we must write the entire code? But the problem says \"missing lines or blocks\". \n\n          We'll assume that for program1.py we are to write the entire code block as a string.\n\n          Therefore, we output:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    w = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    prefix = [0]*(n+1)\\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\\n    suffix = [0]*(n+2)\\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\\n        suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\\n    d = defaultdict(list)\\n    for i in range(0, n+1):\\n        d[prefix[i]].append(i)\\n    ans = 0\\n    for j in range(0, n+1):\\n        s = suffix[n-j]\\n        if s in d:\\n            arr = d[s]\\n            lo, hi = 0, len(arr)-1\\n            candidate_index = -1\\n            while lo<=hi:\\n                mid = (lo+hi)//2\\n                if arr[mid] <= n - j:\\n                    candidate_index = arr[mid]\\n                    lo = mid+1\\n                else:\\n                    hi = mid-1\\n            if candidate_index != -1:\\n                ans = max(ans, candidate_index + j)\\n    print(ans)\",\n              \"program2\": \"total = 1\\nbreak\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the program2.py completion: we are to replace the TODO with:\n\n                total = 1\n                break\n\n          However, the TODO is inside the for loop. We break the loop.\n\n          But the code after the TODO is:\n\n                allzeros = allzeros or total == 0\n\n          We break, so we skip that update? That's acceptable.\n\n          Alternatively, we can write:\n\n            if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n                total = 1\n                break\n\n          But the condition is already written. We just need to fill the two lines.\n\n          Therefore, the completion for program2.py is:\n\n                total = 1\n                break\n\n          But note: the condition is:\n\n                if total < 0 or total != 0 and allzeros:\n\n          We can write:\n\n                total = 1\n                break\n\n          However, we must be careful: the condition is:\n\n                if total < 0 or (total != 0 and allzeros):\n\n          But operator precedence: 'and' has higher precedence than 'or'. So it's:\n\n                if (total < 0) or (total !=0 and allzeros):\n\n          So we break in both cases.\n\n          Therefore, the answer is:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    w = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    prefix = [0]*(n+1)\\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\\n    suffix = [0]*(n+2)\\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\\n        suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\\n    d = defaultdict(list)\\n    for i in range(0, n+1):\\n        d[prefix[i]].append(i)\\n    ans = 0\\n    for j in range(0, n+1):\\n        s = suffix[n-j]\\n        if s in d:\\n            arr = d[s]\\n            lo, hi = 0, len(arr)-1\\n            candidate_index = -1\\n            while lo<=hi:\\n                mid = (lo+hi)//2\\n                if arr[mid] <= n - j:\\n                    candidate_index = arr[mid]\\n                    lo = mid+1\\n                else:\\n                    hi = mid-1\\n            if candidate_index != -1:\\n                ans = max(ans, candidate_index + j)\\n    print(ans)\",\n              \"program2\": \"total = 1\\nbreak\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the program1.py code: we must not forget to import defaultdict.\n\n          We'll write the entire code for program1.py as a string.\n\n          However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\". But for program1.py, there is no existing code? So the entire code is missing.\n\n          We'll output the entire code for program1.py and the two lines for program2.py.\n\n          But note: the problem says: \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" -> but we are outputting the entire program for program1.py? \n\n          How else? The problem says \"missing lines or blocks\", and for program1.py the entire block is missing.\n\n          We'll do as above.\n\n          Let me test the program2.py with the example: [2, -1, -1, 0] -> should be YES.\n\n          In the code for program2.py:\n\n            n=4\n            arr = [2,-1,-1,0]\n\n            total=0, allzeros=False\n            x=2: total=2 -> condition: 2<0? no. (allzeros and 2!=0) -> false. Then set allzeros: 2!=0 -> skip -> allzeros remains False.\n            x=-1: total=1 -> condition: false. allzeros remains False.\n            x=-1: total=0 -> condition: false. Then set allzeros = True.\n            x=0: total=0 -> condition: false. Then set allzeros remains True.\n\n            Then print 'YES'\n\n          Example [1,-1,1]: \n            n=3, arr=[1,-1,1]\n            total=0, allzeros=False\n            x=1: total=1 -> condition: false. allzeros remains False.\n            x=-1: total=0 -> condition: false. set allzeros=True.\n            x=1: total=1 -> condition: (1<0 -> false) or (allzeros and 1!=0 -> true) -> then set total=1 and break.\n            Then print 'NO'\n\n          So it works.\n\n          Therefore, we output the JSON.\n\n          Note: We must escape the quotes? The problem says output the json. We'll output a string that is a json.\n\n          We write:\n\n            {\n              \"program1\": \"t = int(input().strip())\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\nfor _ in range(t):\\n    n = int(input().strip())\\n    w = list(map(int, input().split()))\\n    prefix = [0]*(n+1)\\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + w[i-1]\\n    suffix = [0]*(n+2)\\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\\n        suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\\n    d = defaultdict(list)\\n    for i in range(0, n+1):\\n        d[prefix[i]].append(i)\\n    ans = 0\\n    for j in range(0, n+1):\\n        s = suffix[n-j]\\n        if s in d:\\n            arr = d[s]\\n            lo, hi = 0, len(arr)-1\\n            candidate_index = -1\\n            while lo<=hi:\\n                mid = (lo+hi)//2\\n                if arr[mid] <= n - j:\\n                    candidate_index = arr[mid]\\n                    lo = mid+1\\n                else:\\n                    hi = mid-1\\n            if candidate_index != -1:\\n                ans = max(ans, candidate_index + j)\\n    print(ans)\",\n              \"program2\": \"total = 1\\nbreak\"\n            }\n\n          But note: the program1.py code: we have to be careful with the suffix array: we defined suffix of size n+2, and we do:\n\n            for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n                suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\n\n          This is correct: \n            suffix[n] = 0 (by initialization) and then we don't set suffix[n] again? \n            Actually, we initialize suffix as [0]*(n+2), so suffix[n] and suffix[n+1] are 0.\n            Then for i from n-1 down to 0: \n                suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + w[i]\n\n          Then the suffix for the last j candies is suffix[n-j] (which is the sum from index n-j to n-1).\n\n          Example: n=3, j=1: then we want the last 1 candy: w[2]. Then suffix[3-1]=suffix[2] = w[2] + suffix[3] = w[2] + 0 = w[2]. Correct.\n\n          Therefore, we are done."
