Example: \"abcda\" -> \n                Adjacent duplicates: none.

And the total n over test cases is 200000 -> so it's acceptable. But note: the problem says \"the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe. Let's test with the examples in the note:\n            Example 1: \"aba\" -> distinct set: {'a','b'} -> so we skip the length3 check? -> YES? But the example says \"aba\" is balanced? -> YES. Example 2: \"abb\" -> adjacent duplicate: at index1 and index2: 'b' and 'b' -> NO -> which matches. Example 3: \"abc\" -> distinct set: {'a','b','c'} -> no adjacent duplicates -> then check length3: \n                substring \"abc\": s[0]=='a', s[2]=='c' -> not same -> then we don't break -> YES. Example 4: \"abac\" -> distinct set: {'a','b','c'} -> no adjacent duplicates? a->b: no, b->a: no, a->c: no -> then check length3: [0:3]: \"aba\" -> s[0]=='a', s[2]=='a' -> same and s[1]=='b' ! = 'a' -> break -> NO.

The condition still holds: we break if we find a substring of the form \"aXa\" (with a != X) and then output \"NO\", else \"YES\".",

Or Alice: [1,2,3,4] -> 10, Bob: [7,6,5] -> 18 -> not equal. Or Alice: [3,4,5,6,7] -> 25, Bob: [1,2] -> 3 -> not equal. The example says output 7.",

    "original_reasoning": "<think>\nWe are guaranteed that the total length of all strings is <= 200,000.\n The problem: Check for every substring t of s and for every pair of characters (u, v) in s, the frequency of u and v in t differ by at most 1.\n However, note that the condition must hold for every triplet (t, u, v) where u and v are characters present in the entire string s.\n\n Important observation: The condition is very strict. In fact, note that the problem states that the entire string s must be such that for every substring t and for every two characters u and v that appear in s, the frequencies in t must be almost equal.\n\n But note: the condition must hold for every non-empty substring t? Actually, the problem says: \"for all possible triplets (t, u, v) such that t is a non-empty substring of s and u and v are characters present in s\".\n\n However, note that if a character u does not appear in the substring t, then the frequency is 0. So if we have two characters u and v that are in the entire string s, but one of them (say u) does not appear in t, then the frequency of u is 0 and the frequency of v might be, say, 2 -> then the difference is 2, which is more than 1 -> so that substring t would break the condition.\n\n Therefore, the condition implies that in every substring t, every character that appears in the entire string s must appear in t? That is too strong because then the entire string s must have only one distinct character? But the example \"abc\" is balanced.\n\n Let me reexamine: The condition says \"u and v are characters present in s\", but note: they are present in s, but not necessarily in t. However, if u is not in t, then f_t(u)=0. So if there is a substring t that does not contain a particular character u (which is in s) and also contains a character v (which is in s) with frequency at least 2, then we have |0 - f_t(v)| >= 2 -> which breaks the condition.\n\n Therefore, for every substring t, every character that appears in the entire string s must appear in t? Actually, no: because if a substring t does not contain u, then we require that for every character v in s, f_t(v) must be at most 1? Why? Because if v appears 2 times then |0-2| = 2.\n\n So the condition for a substring t is: for every character u in the entire set of s, the frequency of u in t must be either 0 or 1? And also, if a character is present in t, then it must appear exactly once? Because if two different characters u and v both appear at least twice, then |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| might be 0, but if one appears twice and another once, then |2-1|=1 which is acceptable. However, what if we have three distinct characters? Then we require that in every substring t, the frequency of each distinct character (that appears in s) must be either 0 or 1? Actually, no: consider the substring t that is the entire string \"abc\": frequencies are 1,1,1 -> that's okay. But what about a substring of length 2? For example, \"ab\": then we have a:1, b:1, c:0. Then |1-0|=1 -> okay. But what if we have a substring of length 1? Then one character is 1 and the others are 0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay. \n\n However, what if we have a substring of length 4? Then we must have at least one character appearing twice? But then if we have two a's and one b and one c, then |f(a)-f(b)| = |2-1|=1 -> okay. But wait, the condition says \"the difference between the frequencies of u and v in t is not more than 1\". So if we have two a's, one b, and one c, then for u='a' and v='b': |2-1|=1 -> okay; for u='a' and v='c': |2-1|=1 -> okay; for u='b' and v='c': |1-1|=0 -> okay. So that substring is okay.\n\n But then why is \"abb\" not balanced? Because in the substring \"bb\", we have:\n   u='a', v='b': |0-2| = 2 -> not allowed.\n\n Therefore, the condition breaks when we have a substring that has two of the same character and misses one of the characters that appears in the entire string? Actually, note that in the entire string \"abb\", the set of characters is {'a','b'}. In the substring \"bb\", we have:\n   f_t('a') = 0, f_t('b') = 2 -> |0-2| = 2.\n\n So the condition is broken.\n\n Now, what is the necessary condition for the entire string?\n Observation: The condition must hold for every contiguous substring. In particular, it must hold for every contiguous substring of length 2. So if we have two adjacent same characters, then we have a substring of length 2 that has two of the same character and then the other characters (if any) in the entire string are absent. But note: the entire string might have more than two distinct characters? However, the condition must hold for every pair of characters that appear in the entire string.\n\n Therefore, if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then in any substring of length 2 that has two identical characters, say \"aa\", then for any other character c that is in the entire string (but not in this substring) we have |f_t(a)-f_t(c)| = |2-0| = 2 -> breaks.\n\n So we must avoid having two identical adjacent characters? Actually, that is necessary but is it sufficient?\n\n Also, what about longer substrings? Consider a substring of length 3: \"aba\". The entire string has at least the characters 'a' and 'b'. Then in the substring \"aba\", we have a:2, b:1 -> |2-1|=1 -> okay. But what if we have \"aab\" as the entire string? Then the substring \"aa\" (the first two) is bad: for the pair (a,b): |2-0|=2 -> bad.\n\n Therefore, we can deduce that the string must not contain two consecutive same characters? But what about a string with three distinct characters? Consider \"abc\": no consecutive same -> it is balanced.\n\n However, what about a string that has a repeated character but not adjacent? For example: \"abacaba\". Let's check a substring that contains two a's and one b and one c? That's okay as we saw. But what about the substring \"aa\"? That substring has two a's and no b and no c. Then for the pair (a,b): |2-0|=2 -> bad. So if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then any substring that is \"aa\" (or any two same adjacent) is bad.\n\n But note: the substring \"aa\" might be isolated? Actually, if the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then the substring \"aa\" (if it appears) will break the condition because the other distinct character (say b) is present in the entire string but absent in \"aa\", and then |f_t(a)-f_t(b)| = |2-0|=2.\n\n Therefore, the necessary condition is that the string must not have any two adjacent equal characters? And also, what about the distinct characters? Actually, the condition must hold for every substring. But note: if the entire string has only one distinct character? Then for any substring, we have only one character. Then for any two characters u and v (but note: the entire string has only one distinct character, so u and v must be the same) then |f_t(u)-f_t(v)| = |f_t(u)-f_t(u)| = 0 -> okay. So a string of all same characters is balanced.\n\n Therefore, we can deduce:\n   If the string has two adjacent equal characters, then it is not balanced.\n   Otherwise, if the string has no adjacent equal characters, then is it balanced?\n\n Let's test with \"abacaba\": \n   It has adjacent a's? The string is: a, b, a, c, a, b, a -> no two adjacent are the same? Actually, it doesn't have two consecutive same? So it should be balanced? But wait, what about the substring \"aba\"? That's okay. What about the substring \"a\" (the first one)? Then for any two distinct characters in the entire string (which are a, b, c): \n        a:1, b:0, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 for (a,b) and (a,c) -> okay.\n   What about the substring \"ab\": \n        a:1, b:1, c:0 -> |1-0|=1 -> okay.\n   What about the substring \"aca\": \n        a:2, b:0, c:1 -> then |2-1|=1 for (a,c) -> okay, and |2-0|=2 for (a,b) -> wait, that's 2 -> not okay.\n\n So the substring \"aca\" breaks the condition? \n   The entire string is \"abacaba\", and the substring \"aca\" is from index 2 to 4: \n        s[2] = 'a', s[3]='c', s[4]='a'. \n   The entire string has characters {'a','b','c'}. In the substring \"aca\", we have:\n        a:2, c:1, b:0.\n   Then for the pair (a,b): |2-0|=2 -> violates.\n\n Therefore, even without adjacent duplicates, we can have a problem.\n\n What is the issue? The substring \"aca\" has two a's and one c, and misses b. So the condition fails because the entire string has b, but in this substring b is absent and a appears twice.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid having a character appear twice in a substring that does not contain all the distinct characters? But the condition must hold for every substring. How can we avoid that?\n\n Alternatively, note the constraint: the entire string s must be such that the set of distinct characters is small? Actually, the problem says the total length of all test cases is <= 200000, but the distinct characters in a string can be up to 26.\n\n How to solve?\n Another observation: the condition must hold for every contiguous substring. In particular, it must hold for every contiguous substring of length 2 and 3. \n\n We have seen that:\n   - If there is a duplicate adjacent (like \"aa\"), then the substring \"aa\" breaks the condition (if the entire string has at least two distinct characters). \n   - Also, if the entire string has more than 2 distinct characters, then we must avoid having a substring that contains two of one character and one of another and misses a third? \n\n But note: the condition must hold for every substring. So if the entire string has 3 distinct characters, then every contiguous substring must either:\n   (a) contain all three distinct characters, or \n   (b) if it misses one, then the frequencies of the two that are present must be at most 1? \n\n Actually, if a substring misses one character (say c) and has two a's and one b, then for the pair (a,c): |2-0|=2 -> breaks.\n\n Therefore, the condition implies that in every contiguous substring, the frequency of every character that is present in the entire string must be at least the maximum frequency minus 1? Actually, no: because if we have a substring that has two a's and two b's, then |2-2|=0 -> okay, and if we have two a's and one b, then |2-1|=1 -> okay? But wait, what if we have three distinct characters? Then we must have the third character present? \n\n Actually, the condition requires that the frequency of the third character must be at least 1? Because if it is 0, then |2-0|=2 -> breaks.\n\n Therefore, every contiguous substring must contain every distinct character that appears in the entire string? That is, the entire string must have only one distinct character? Because if there are two distinct characters, then a substring of length 1 (which has only one character) would break the condition? \n\n But wait: in the example \"abc\", the substring \"a\" (which is of length 1) has a:1, b:0, c:0 -> then |1-0|=1 -> acceptable. So the condition is that the difference must be at most 1. So if we have a substring that has one character and the others 0, then the difference is 1 -> acceptable.\n\n However, if we have a substring that has two of one character and 0 of another, then the difference is 2 -> not acceptable.\n\n Therefore, the condition is broken if we have a substring that has at least two of one character and zero of another character that appears in the entire string.\n\n So the problem reduces to: \n   For the entire string s, let D be the set of distinct characters.\n   We must check that for every contiguous substring t, and for every character c in D, the frequency of c in t is at least (max_{d in D} f_t(d)) - 1.\n\n But note: if the substring t has maximum frequency M, then every character in D must appear at least M-1 times? That is too strong because we can have a substring that has two a's and one b (and no c) and if D has three characters, then we require that c appears at least 1 time? But it doesn't.\n\n Alternatively, we can think: the condition is that the maximum frequency in the substring minus the minimum frequency (over the characters in D) must be at most 1. But note: the minimum frequency might be 0. So the condition is: max_f - min_f <= 1.\n\n However, the min_f is taken over the entire set D? Yes. And note: the min_f might be 0. So if we have a substring that has two a's and one b and zero c, then max_f=2, min_f=0 -> 2-0=2>1 -> breaks.\n\n Therefore, the condition is equivalent to: for every contiguous substring t, the frequencies of the characters in D (the entire distinct set) must satisfy: max_f - min_f <= 1.\n\n How to check for every contiguous substring? The total length of all test cases is 200000, but the distinct set D can be up to 26. However, the number of distinct characters in a string is at most 26.\n\n We can use the following idea:\n   Since the condition must hold for every contiguous substring, we can try to check only the minimal substrings that might break the condition. What are the minimal violations?\n   We have seen that if there is a duplicate adjacent (like \"aa\") and the entire string has at least two distinct characters, then the substring \"aa\" breaks the condition. Also, we have seen that a substring of length 3 that has two of one character and one of another and misses a third (like \"aca\" in a string that has 'a','b','c') breaks the condition.\n\n   Therefore, we can check all contiguous substrings of length 2 and 3? Why?\n   Claim: if a string has no duplicate adjacent and no contiguous substring of length 3 that has two of one character and one of another and misses a third, then the entire string is balanced?\n\n   Why? \n   - The condition for substrings of length 1: max_f=1, min_f=0 -> 1-0=1 -> okay.\n   - For substrings of length 2: they must be distinct (since no adjacent duplicates) so frequencies are 1 for two distinct characters? Actually, no: if the entire string has more than 2 distinct characters, then a substring of length 2 has two distinct characters, but the others are 0. Then max_f=1, min_f=0 -> 1-0=1 -> okay.\n   - For substrings of length 3: we are assuming that we don't have a substring that has two of one character and one of another and misses a third? But note: we might have a substring of length 3 that has three distinct characters: then max_f=1, min_f=1 -> 0 -> okay. Or we might have a substring of length 3 that has two of one character and one of another? But then we are assuming that we don't have that? Actually, we are assuming that we don't have a substring of length 3 that has two of one character and one of another and misses a third? But if the entire string has only two distinct characters, then a substring of length 3 that has two of one and one of the other is acceptable? Because then the set D has two characters, and the frequencies: [2,1] -> max_f=2, min_f=1 -> 1<=1 -> okay.\n\n   However, if the entire string has three distinct characters, then a substring of length 3 that has two of one and one of another (and misses the third) is not acceptable. But we are going to check for that.\n\n   Therefore, the violations can only occur in substrings of length 2 and 3? \n\n   Why? \n   Consider a longer substring that breaks the condition. It must have a character that appears at least twice and a character that is missing (so the entire string has at least two distinct characters). Then we can try to find a minimal such substring: \n        - If we have a substring t that has max_f>=2 and min_f=0 (so missing at least one character) then we can try to shrink the substring until we get a minimal one. \n        - The minimal violation would be a substring that has max_f=2 and min_f=0 and as short as possible. How short? \n            * If we have two of the same character: then we can take the two same characters that are closest? But if they are adjacent: then we have a substring of length 2: \"aa\" -> that's minimal.\n            * If they are not adjacent, then we have a substring that has two a's and the characters in between. But note: if we take the two a's and the characters in between, we might have a substring that has the two a's and one character in between? Then the substring is \"aXa\". Then the frequency of a is 2, and the frequency of the character X is 1, and the other characters (if any in the entire string) are 0. Then if the entire string has a third character (say b) that is not X and not a, then we have min_f=0 (for b) and max_f=2 -> breaks. And the length is 3.\n\n   Therefore, we only need to check:\n        - All contiguous substrings of length 2: if there is any duplicate adjacent -> then break (return \"NO\").\n        - All contiguous substrings of length 3: if there is a substring of the form \"aXa\" (where X is any character, possibly equal to a? but then adjacent duplicates would have been caught) but note: if X is not a, then we have two a's and one X. Then if the entire string has a third distinct character (say b) that is not present in this substring, then we break. But wait: how do we know the entire string has a third distinct character? We can precompute the distinct set for the entire string.\n\n   However, note: the condition must hold for every pair of characters in the entire string. So if the entire string has only two distinct characters, then in the substring \"aXa\" (with X being the other character) we have:\n        distinct set of entire string: {a, X}. \n        In the substring: a:2, X:1 -> then for the pair (a,X): |2-1|=1 -> okay. \n        And there is no third character. So it is acceptable.\n\n   Therefore, the substring \"aXa\" (with two distinct characters) is acceptable. \n\n   But if the entire string has three distinct characters, then the substring \"aXa\" (which does not contain the third character, say b) will break the condition: because for the pair (a,b): |2-0|=2.\n\n   Therefore, we must check for every substring of length 3 that has the form \"aXa\" (with a != X) and the entire string has at least three distinct characters? \n\n   However, what if the entire string has more than three distinct characters? Then the same applies: if the substring \"aXa\" does not contain one of the distinct characters (say any one of the others) then it breaks.\n\n   Therefore, we can do:\n        Let D = set(s) (the distinct characters in the entire string)\n        If |D| == 1: then we are safe? -> YES.\n        Else:\n            Check for any adjacent duplicate: if exists -> NO.\n            Then, if |D|>=3, check for any substring of length 3 of the form \"aXa\" (with a != X) -> then NO.\n\n        But wait: what if the entire string has 2 distinct characters? Then we don't check the substring of the form \"aXa\" because |D|==2? And we already checked adjacent duplicates? Then we return YES.\n\n   Let's test:\n        Example 1: \"aba\" -> entire string: D = {'a','b'} -> |D|=2 -> we only check adjacent duplicates: \n            'a' and 'b' -> no duplicate adjacent? Then YES.\n\n        Example 2: \"abc\" -> D has 3. Check adjacent duplicates: no. Then check for any substring of length 3: \n            The entire string is \"abc\": \n                substring[0:3] = \"abc\": not of the form \"aXa\" -> skip.\n            But wait, we need to check every contiguous substring of length 3? Actually, we have:\n                s[0:3] = \"abc\" -> not of the form \"aXa\" (because the first and last are different: 'a' and 'c').\n            What about \"aba\"? That would be a substring of length 3? But in \"abc\", we don't have \"aba\". \n\n        However, what about the entire string \"abac\"? \n            D = {'a','b','c'} -> |D|=3.\n            Adjacent duplicates? \n                a->b: no, b->a: no, a->c: no -> so no adjacent duplicates.\n            Now check substrings of length 3:\n                \"aba\": \n                    first char 'a', last char 'a', and the middle is 'b' (which is not a) -> so it is of the form \"aXa\". \n                    Then we break -> NO.\n\n        But wait: the entire string \"abac\" has the substring \"aba\", which breaks the condition? \n            In \"aba\": \n                a:2, b:1, c:0 -> then for (a,c): |2-0|=2 -> breaks.\n\n        Therefore, we return \"NO\" for \"abac\".\n\n        What about \"a\"? -> |D|=1 -> YES.\n        What about \"aa\" -> adjacent duplicate -> NO.\n        What about \"aab\" -> adjacent duplicate (the first two) -> NO.\n\n        What about \"ab\": \n            |D|=2 -> no adjacent duplicate -> YES.\n\n        What about \"abc\": \n            |D|=3 -> no adjacent duplicate -> then check for any substring of length 3 that is \"aXa\", \"bXb\", or \"cXc\". \n            The entire string \"abc\": \n                \"abc\": not of the form (first and last same) -> no.\n            So YES.\n\n        But wait: what about the substring \"ab\" in \"abc\"? \n            We have already considered that adjacent duplicates are absent, and for substrings of length 3 we are only checking those that have the same first and last? \n            What about a substring of length 3 that is \"bcb\" in a different string? \n\n        However, note: we are iterating over every contiguous substring of length 3. In \"abc\", we have only one contiguous substring of length 3: \"abc\". \n\n        But what if we have \"abca\"? \n            D = {'a','b','c'} -> |D|=3.\n            Adjacent duplicates? \n                a->b, b->c, c->a -> none.\n            Check substrings of length 3:\n                \"abc\": not of the form aXa, bXb, cXc? \n                \"bca\": not of the form? \n                But wait, we have to check every contiguous substring of length 3: \n                    [0:3] = \"abc\": not.\n                    [1:4] = \"bca\": not.\n                But what about the substring \"aca\"? \n                    The substring starting at index0 and index2? That would be \"aba\"? But wait, the string is \"abca\", so:\n                        indices: \n                            0: 'a'\n                            1: 'b'\n                            2: 'c'\n                            3: 'a'\n                    The substring of length 3 starting at index1: \"bca\" -> not of the form (first and last same) because 'b' and 'a' are different.\n\n            However, we missed the substring \"aca\": \n                How do we get \"aca\"? \n                    It is the substring starting at index0 and index2? But that is \"abc\" (if we take 3 consecutive, we get \"abc\", then \"bca\"). \n                Actually, \"aca\" is not contiguous? The contiguous substring must be consecutive. So \"aca\" is not contiguous in \"abca\" because the a's are not consecutive.\n\n            But note: the substring \"aca\" in the string \"abca\" is not contiguous? The contiguous substring that gives \"aca\" would require skipping the 'b'. So we don't have that.\n\n            However, we do have a contiguous substring that is \"a\" at the beginning and the next a at the end? But that is two non consecutive a's. The contiguous substring that includes the first and last a is the entire string \"abca\", which has length 4. \n\n            How about the substring of length 4? \n                We are only checking length 2 and 3? \n\n            But note: the condition must hold for every contiguous substring. The substring \"abca\" (the entire string) has:\n                a:2, b:1, c:1 -> then max_f=2, min_f=1 -> 2-1=1 -> acceptable.\n\n            However, what about the substring that is the last two and the first? -> that is not contiguous.\n\n            Therefore, we only need to check contiguous substrings. \n\n            But wait: the substring \"a\" at the beginning and the \"a\" at the end are not contiguous? We cannot skip the middle. \n\n            So the contiguous substrings of \"abca\" are:\n                length1: \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"a\" -> all okay.\n                length2: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"ca\" -> okay (no duplicates and distinct).\n                length3: \"abc\", \"bca\" -> \n                    \"abc\": a:1, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n                    \"bca\": b:1, c:1, a:1 -> okay.\n                length4: \"abca\": a:2, b:1, c:1 -> okay.\n\n            So \"abca\" is acceptable? \n\n            But wait: what about the substring that is the first 'a' and the last 'a'? That would be two non contiguous a's? But the problem says contiguous substring. \n\n            Therefore, we only check contiguous substrings.\n\n            However, note: the problem says \"a string b is called a substring of a if b can be obtained by deleting some characters (possibly 0) from the start and some characters (possibly 0) from the end of a\". So contiguous substring.\n\n            Therefore, we only need to check contiguous substrings.\n\n            But then why did the example \"abac\" (which is \"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"c\") break? \n                The contiguous substring \"aba\" (indices0 to 2) is present: \n                    s[0:3] = \"aba\" -> which is of the form \"aXa\" (with X='b') and the entire string has 3 distinct characters -> so we break.\n\n            How do we check for \"aba\" in \"abac\"? \n                We can iterate over every contiguous substring of length 3 and check if the first and last character are the same? \n\n            Algorithm for a test case:\n                s = input string.\n                D = set(s)\n                if len(D) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check for adjacent duplicates\n                flag = False\n                for i in range(len(s)-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        flag = True\n                        break\n                if flag:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                # If |D| < 3, then we are done -> YES.\n                if len(D) < 3:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Now check for any contiguous substring of length 3 that has the same first and last character.\n                for i in range(len(s)-2):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+2] and s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                        # This substring is s[i], s[i+1], s[i+2] -> form \"aXa\"\n                        flag = True\n                        break\n\n                if flag:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n        But wait: what if we have a substring of the form \"aXa\" but the entire string has only two distinct characters? Then we don't break? Actually, we skip because we only do this check when |D|>=3.\n\n        However, what if the entire string has two distinct characters and we have a substring \"aXa\"? Then we don't check? But that substring is acceptable? Because the entire string has only two distinct characters: a and X. Then in the substring \"aXa\", we have a:2, X:1 -> max_f=2, min_f=1 -> 1<=1 -> acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we only need to break when |D|>=3 and we find a substring of the form \"aXa\" (with a != X).\n\n        But note: what if we have a substring of length 3 that is \"aaa\"? \n            Then we have adjacent duplicates? Actually, we already checked adjacent duplicates: the first two are 'a' and 'a' -> we break at the adjacent duplicate check.\n\n        Therefore, we don't need to worry about \"aaa\" because it would have been caught by the adjacent duplicate check.\n\n        What about \"aaba\"? \n            Adjacent duplicates: \n                index0 and index1: 'a' and 'a' -> break -> NO.\n\n        What about \"acba\"? \n            D = {'a','b','c'} -> |D|=3.\n            Adjacent duplicates: \n                a->c: no, c->b: no, b->a: no -> pass.\n            Check substrings of length 3:\n                \"acb\": a and b -> not same -> skip.\n                \"cba\": c and a -> not same -> skip.\n            Then we return YES.\n\n        But wait: what about the substring \"a\" and \"a\" at the ends? They are not contiguous? So we don't have a contiguous substring that has two a's and misses the b? \n            The contiguous substrings that have two a's must include the entire substring \"acba\": \n                a:2, c:1, b:1 -> max_f=2, min_f=1 -> 1 -> acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the answer for \"acba\" is YES.\n\n        However, what about the substring \"aba\" in \"acba\"? \n            The string \"acba\" does not have \"aba\" as a contiguous substring? \n                The contiguous substrings of length 3: \n                    [0:3] = \"acb\"\n                    [1:4] = \"cba\"\n                \"aba\" is not contiguous? \n\n        So we are safe.\n\n        But what about the string \"acaca\"? \n            D = {'a','c'} -> |D|=2 -> we skip the length3 check? \n            Adjacent duplicates: \n                a->c: no, c->a: no, a->c: no, c->a: no -> no adjacent duplicates -> YES.\n\n        However, what about the substring \"aca\" and then \"aca\" again? \n            The entire string: \n                a:3, c:2 -> max_f=3, min_f=2 -> 1 -> acceptable? \n            But what about a contiguous substring that is \"aca\": \n                a:2, c:1 -> acceptable? because |2-1|=1 -> acceptable.\n\n        So it is YES.\n\n        But what if the entire string has three distinct characters and we have a substring of the form \"aXa\" but with more than 3 characters? \n            Example: \"abcda\" -> \n                Adjacent duplicates: none.\n                Check substrings of length 3: \n                    \"abc\": not same first and last -> skip.\n                    \"bcd\": not same -> skip.\n                    \"cda\": not same -> skip.\n                Then we return YES.\n\n            But what about the substring \"aba\"? We don't have that. \n            What about the substring \"aa\"? We don't have adjacent duplicates.\n\n            However, what about the substring \"a...a\" (the first and last a) in a contiguous substring? \n                The contiguous substring that is the entire string: \"abcda\": \n                    a:2, b:1, c:1, d:1 -> max_f=2, min_f=1 -> 1 -> acceptable.\n\n            But what about the substring that is the first a and the last a? That is the entire string? \n\n            What about a shorter contiguous substring that has two a's and misses one of the distinct characters? \n                For example, if we take the substring from index0 to index3: \"abcd\" -> then we have a:1, b:1, c:1, d:1 -> acceptable.\n                How about from index0 to index4: the entire string -> acceptable.\n\n            How about from index0 to index0: \"a\" -> acceptable.\n            How about from index0 to index1: \"ab\" -> acceptable.\n\n            How about from index0 to index2: \"abc\" -> acceptable.\n\n            How about from index0 to index3: \"abcd\" -> acceptable.\n\n            How about from index1 to index4: \"bcda\" -> acceptable.\n\n            So we don't have a violation.\n\n        But wait: what if we have \"abacaba\"? \n            We already saw that the substring \"aba\" (the first three) is a problem? \n                But note: the entire string \"abacaba\" has distinct set {'a','b','c'} -> |D|=3.\n                Adjacent duplicates: \n                    a->b: no, b->a: no, a->c: no, c->a: no, a->b: no, b->a: no -> no adjacent duplicates.\n                Check substrings of length 3:\n                    [0:3] = \"aba\": first and last are 'a' -> and the entire string has 3 distinct characters -> break -> NO.\n\n        Therefore, the algorithm:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for each test case:\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                n = len(s)\n\n                # If the string has only one distinct character -> YES.\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Check for adjacent duplicates\n                has_dup = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        has_dup = True\n                        break\n\n                if has_dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                # If the distinct set has 2 characters -> YES.\n                if len(distinct) == 2:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Now distinct set has at least 3\n                # Check for any contiguous substring of length 3 that has the same first and last character and the middle is different.\n                found = False\n                for i in range(n-2):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+2] and s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n\n                if found:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is <= 200000. The adjacent duplicate check is O(n) per test case, and the length3 check is also O(n) per test case. And the total n over test cases is 200000 -> so it's acceptable.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we are safe.\n\n        Let's test with the examples in the note:\n            Example 1: \"aba\" -> distinct set: {'a','b'} -> so we skip the length3 check? -> YES? \n                But the example says \"aba\" is balanced? -> YES.\n\n            Example 2: \"abb\" -> adjacent duplicate: at index1 and index2: 'b' and 'b' -> NO -> which matches.\n\n            Example 3: \"abc\" -> distinct set: {'a','b','c'} -> no adjacent duplicates -> then check length3: \n                substring \"abc\": s[0]=='a', s[2]=='c' -> not same -> then we don't break -> YES.\n\n            Example 4: \"abac\" -> distinct set: {'a','b','c'} -> no adjacent duplicates? \n                a->b: no, b->a: no, a->c: no -> then check length3: \n                    [0:3]: \"aba\" -> s[0]=='a', s[2]=='a' -> same and s[1]=='b' != 'a' -> break -> NO.\n\n        Therefore, the code:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                n = len(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                dup = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        dup = True\n                        break\n                if dup:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n                if len(distinct) == 2:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                # Now distinct>=3\n                found = False\n                for i in range(n-2):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+2] and s[i] != s[i+1]:\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                print(\"NO\" if found else \"YES\")\n\n        But wait: what if the distinct set has more than 3? The condition still holds: we break if we find a substring of the form \"aXa\" (with a != X) and then output \"NO\", else \"YES\".\n\n        However, note: the condition might be broken by a substring of length 3 that has the same first and last and the entire string has more than 2 distinct characters? Yes, because we are checking for |D|>=3.\n\n        Therefore, the code above should work.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is <= 200000, so we are safe.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can do:\n\n            total_length = 0\n            for each test case: total_length += n\n\n            and we are doing two loops per test case: one for adjacent duplicates (which is O(n)) and one for length3 (which is O(n)) -> so total O(2 * total_length) = 400000 -> acceptable.\n\n        But note: we break early if we find an adjacent duplicate. So worst-case we do two passes per test case.\n\n        Alternatively, we can combine the two loops? But not necessary.\n\n        Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is <= 200000, so we can do:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                n = len(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                # Check adjacent duplicates and also check for any triplet of the form \"aXa\" in one pass?\n                # Actually, we can break early for adjacent duplicates, then if we get to the triplet part we do that.\n\n                # Check adjacent duplicates:\n                found_bad = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        found_bad = True\n                        break\n\n                if found_bad:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n\n                if len(distinct) == 2:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n\n                # Now check for triplet\n                for i in range(n-2):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                        # We don't care about the middle? Actually, we require that the middle is different? \n                        # But if the middle is the same, then we would have had adjacent duplicates? \n                        # Because if s[i] == s[i+1] then we break in the adjacent duplicate check. \n                        # So if we get here, then s[i] != s[i+1] and s[i] == s[i+2] -> so we break.\n                        found_bad = True\n                        break\n\n                print(\"NO\" if found_bad else \"YES\")\n\n        Actually, we don't need to check s[i] != s[i+1] in the triplet part because if s[i] == s[i+1] we would have broken earlier. So we can just check s[i] == s[i+2].\n\n        Therefore, the code for the test case becomes:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                s = input().strip()\n                distinct = set(s)\n                n = len(s)\n                if len(distinct) == 1:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                flag = False\n                for i in range(n-1):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+1]:\n                        flag = True\n                        break\n                if flag:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    continue\n                if len(distinct) == 2:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                    continue\n                flag = False\n                for i in range(n-2):\n                    if s[i] == s[i+2]:\n                        flag = True\n                        break\n                print(\"NO\" if flag else \"YES\")\n\n        Let's test with the provided examples.\n\n        Example 1: \"aba\" -> distinct=2 -> after adjacent duplicate check (no duplicate) -> then we skip the triplet check -> YES.\n        Example 2: \"abb\" -> adjacent duplicate at i=1 -> NO.\n        Example 3: \"abc\" -> distinct=3 -> no adjacent duplicate -> then check triplet: \n            i=0: s[0]=='a', s[2]=='c' -> not equal -> skip.\n            i=1: s[1]=='b', s[3] -> out of range -> then flag remains False -> YES.\n        Example 4: \"abac\" -> distinct=3 -> no adjacent duplicate -> triplet check:\n            i=0: s[0]=='a', s[2]=='a' -> equal -> flag=True -> break -> NO.\n\n        Example 5: \"a\" -> distinct=1 -> YES.\n        Example 6: \"aa\" -> adjacent duplicate -> NO.\n        Example 7: \"ab\" -> distinct=2 -> YES.\n        Example 8: \"abc\" -> YES.\n        Example 9: \"abac\" -> NO.\n\n        But note: the example \"abacaba\" (the first example in the note) is \"aba\" -> which we now return YES? \n            Actually, the example \"aba\" in the note is the entire string? \n            The problem says: \n                For the first test case: \"aba\" -> the answer is YES? \n                But the example output for the first test case is 2? -> wait, no, the problem says \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right.\" -> that was a different problem.\n\n        This is a different problem: we are now on the problem about perfectly balanced strings.\n\n        The note in the problem says:\n            For example, the strings \"aba\" and \"abc\" are perfectly balanced but \"abb\" is not.\n\n        So \"aba\" is balanced -> YES.\n\n        Therefore, the code above matches.\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is <= 200000, but the triplet loop runs for n-2 per test case. The worst-case total n is 200000, so worst-case total iterations for triplet checks is 200000 (if no adjacent duplicates and distinct>=3) -> acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we output the code accordingly.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total of the lengths of all test cases is <= 200000, so we are safe.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", meaning the total characters in all test cases is <=200000.\n\n        So we are good.\n\n        Now, the given code template:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            while (t > 0):\n                t -= 1\n                s = str(input())\n                var = set(s)\n                ans = \"YES\"\n                for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                    if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                        # TODO: Your code here\n                print(ans)\n\n        This template is different. It is trying to check something else: it checks for every contiguous substring of length = len(var) (the distinct count) whether the distinct count in that substring is the same as the distinct count of the entire string? \n\n        But note: the condition we deduced is that we must avoid adjacent duplicates and avoid triplets of the form \"aXa\" (with a != X) when the distinct count is at least 3.\n\n        How does the template relate? \n\n        The template is checking: for every starting index i, the substring s[i:i+len(var)] must have exactly len(var) distinct characters? \n\n        Why? \n            If the entire string has d distinct characters, then every contiguous substring of length d must contain all d distinct characters? \n\n        But is that true? \n            Consider \"aba\": d=2. Then we check substrings of length 2: \n                s[0:2] = \"ab\" -> distinct: {'a','b'} -> 2 -> okay.\n                s[1:3] = \"ba\" -> distinct: {'b','a'} -> 2 -> okay.\n\n            Consider \"abc\": d=3. Then we check substrings of length 3: \n                only one: \"abc\" -> distinct:3 -> okay.\n\n            Consider \"abac\": d=3. Then we check substrings of length 3:\n                [0:3] = \"aba\" -> distinct: {'a','b'} -> 2 != 3 -> then we set ans to \"NO\".\n\n        So the template is doing: \n            ans = \"YES\"\n            for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break   # but note: the break is not in the template, but we can break\n\n        Then print(ans)\n\n        This is equivalent to: \n            Check that every contiguous substring of length = (number of distinct characters) has exactly that many distinct characters.\n\n        Why is that equivalent to our condition?\n\n        Claim: The condition (that the string is perfectly balanced) is equivalent to: for every contiguous substring t, the distinct set of t is the entire distinct set of s? \n            But that is not true: consider \"aba\" (which is balanced) and the substring \"a\": distinct set is {'a'} which is not the entire set {'a','b'}.\n\n        However, the template checks only contiguous substrings of length = d (the distinct count). \n\n        But note: if we have a contiguous substring of length d that does not contain all distinct characters, then we break? \n\n        How does that relate to our condition? \n            We know that if there is a contiguous substring that misses a distinct character and has a character repeated (so that the frequency of that repeated character is at least 2) then we break? \n\n        Actually, if we have a contiguous substring of length d that does not contain all distinct characters, then it must be missing at least one character. And since the length is d, and the distinct characters in the substring are less than d, then by pigeonhole, at least one character appears at least twice? \n\n        Then in that substring, we have at least one character with frequency>=2 and one character (the missing one) with frequency 0 -> then the difference is at least 2 -> breaks the condition.\n\n        Therefore, if we find a contiguous substring of length d that does not contain all distinct characters, then the string is not balanced.\n\n        Conversely, if the string is not balanced, then we have a contiguous substring t and two characters u and v (in the entire distinct set) such that |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|>=2. \n            Then, in this substring t, let M = max_{c in D} f_t(c) and m = min_{c in D} f_t(c). Then M - m >= 2.\n            Then, we can consider a contiguous substring of t that has length at most d? \n\n        Actually, we can use the following: \n            We know that the minimal violations occur in substrings of length 2 (adjacent duplicates) or 3 (the triplet). \n\n        But the template approach: \n            It checks every contiguous substring of length d (the distinct count). \n\n        How efficient is that? \n            The distinct count d can be up to 26, but the number of contiguous substrings of length d is n - d + 1, and the total n over test cases is 200000. \n            However, if d is 1, then we have n contiguous substrings of length 1 -> n can be 200000 per test case? But the total n over test cases is 200000 -> so worst-case one test case with n=200000 and d=1 -> then we do 200000 iterations, each taking O(1) to check the set? Actually, we are building a set of a substring of length 1 -> O(1). \n\n            But if d is 26, then we are building a set for each contiguous substring of length 26, and the total number of such substrings is n-25. For one test case with n=200000, that would be 199975 substrings, and building a set of 26 characters is O(26) per substring -> total 199975 * 26 ~ 5.2e6 -> acceptable.\n\n        But note: the total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case total length is 200000. Then the total work for all test cases would be: \n            For each test case: \n                d = len(set(s))\n                number of contiguous substrings of length d: n - d + 1\n                and for each substring, we do set(s[i:i+d]) -> which is O(d) per substring.\n\n            Then the total work for one test case: O(d * (n-d+1)) = O(d*n). \n\n            The worst-case d is 26, so 26 * n. The total n over test cases is 200000, so worst-case one test case with n=200000 -> 26*200000 = 5.2e6 -> acceptable.\n\n        But what if there are many test cases? The total n over test cases is 200000, so the worst-case is one test case with n=200000 -> then 5.2e6 is acceptable.\n\n        However, what if we have 10000 test cases? But the total n is 200000, so the average n is 20. Then d is at most 20? Then worst-case for one test case: d=20, n=20 -> 20*20=400. Then total over 10000 test cases: 10000*400 = 4e6 -> acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, the template approach is acceptable.\n\n        How does it work? \n            We set ans = \"YES\"\n            For i in range(n-d+1):\n                substring = s[i:i+d]\n                if len(set(substring)) != d:\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n            Then print(ans)\n\n        Why is this correct?\n            If we find a contiguous substring of length d that does not have d distinct characters, then we break and output \"NO\". Otherwise, \"YES\".\n\n        But is that sufficient? \n            We must also consider: what if there is a violation in a substring that is shorter than d? \n                For example, adjacent duplicates: if we have \"aa\", then d for the entire string is 1? -> no, because if the entire string is \"aa\", then d=1. Then we check contiguous substrings of length 1: \n                    each substring of length 1 has distinct=1 -> so we don't break. \n                But wait, the entire string \"aa\" is not balanced? because we have a substring \"aa\": \n                    for the entire string, distinct set is {'a'}, so we only consider u=v='a'. Then |2-2|=0 -> okay? \n                But wait, the problem says: the entire string has distinct set {'a'}, so the condition must hold for every substring and for every pair of characters in the entire string? \n                    The entire string has only one character, so the only pair is (a,a). Then for any substring, the frequencies are the same -> 0 difference.\n\n                Therefore, a string of all the same character is balanced.\n\n            What about \"abb\": \n                distinct set: {'a','b'} -> d=2.\n                Check contiguous substrings of length 2:\n                    [0:2] = \"ab\": distinct=2 -> okay.\n                    [1:3] = \"bb\": distinct=1 -> not 2 -> break -> \"NO\".\n\n            What about \"aba\": \n                d=2.\n                Check contiguous substrings of length 2:\n                    [0:2] = \"ab\": distinct=2 -> okay.\n                    [1:3] = \"ba\": distinct=2 -> okay.\n                -> YES.\n\n            What about \"abac\": \n                d=3.\n                Check contiguous substrings of length 3:\n                    [0:3] = \"aba\": distinct=2 -> not 3 -> break -> \"NO\".\n\n            What about \"abc\": \n                d=3.\n                Check contiguous substrings of length 3: \n                    [0:3] = \"abc\": distinct=3 -> YES.\n\n            What about \"abca\": \n                d=3.\n                Check contiguous substrings of length 3:\n                    [0:3] = \"abc\": distinct=3 -> okay.\n                    [1:4] = \"bca\": distinct=3 -> okay.\n                -> YES.\n\n            What about \"abacaba\": \n                d=3.\n                Check contiguous substrings of length 3:\n                    [0:3] = \"aba\": distinct=2 -> break -> \"NO\".\n\n            This matches our previous result.\n\n        Therefore, the template approach is correct and simpler.\n\n        Why? \n            Because if there is any contiguous substring of length d (the distinct count) that does not contain all distinct characters, then that substring has at least one character missing (so frequency 0) and by the pigeonhole principle, at least one character appears at least twice? \n                Since the substring has length d and distinct count < d, then at least one character appears at least twice -> then the frequency of that character is at least 2 and the frequency of the missing character is 0 -> difference>=2 -> breaks.\n\n            Conversely, if the string is not balanced, then there exists a contiguous substring t and two characters u and v in the entire distinct set such that |f_t(u)-f_t(v)|>=2. \n                Then, we can consider a minimal contiguous substring that breaks the condition. We have argued that the minimal violations occur in substrings of length 2 or 3. \n                But note: the template checks substrings of length d. However, if we have a violation in a substring of length 2 (like \"aa\") and the entire distinct set has size 2, then the substring \"aa\" has length 2 (which is d) and distinct count=1 (which is less than d) -> so we break.\n                Similarly, if we have a violation in a substring of length 3 (like \"aba\") and the entire distinct set has size 3, then the substring \"aba\" has length 3 (which is d) and distinct count=2 (less than d) -> break.\n\n            Therefore, the template approach catches the violations.\n\n        So we can complete the template as:\n\n            t = int(input())\n            while (t > 0):\n                t -= 1\n                s = str(input())\n                var = set(s)\n                d = len(var)\n                n = len(s)\n                ans = \"YES\"\n                # If d==1, then we don't need to check? Actually, we can skip? \n                # But the loop: for i in range(n-d+1): \n                #   if d==1, then we are checking every contiguous substring of length 1 -> each has distinct=1 -> so we don't break -> YES.\n                # So we can do the loop for any d.\n\n                # But note: if d > n, then the loop runs 0 times -> then we output YES? \n                # But d cannot be greater than n? because d is the distinct count of the entire string, which is at most n.\n\n                for i in range(n - d + 1):\n                    # Extract substring s[i:i+d]\n                    substr = s[i:i+d]\n                    if len(set(substr)) != d:\n                        ans = \"NO\"\n                        break   # break out of the for loop\n\n                print(ans)\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total length of all test cases is 200000, and d is at most 26, so the inner set creation is O(d) and the total work is O(d * (n-d+1)) per test case. And the total n over test cases is 200000 -> worst-case one test case with n=200000 and d=26: 26 * (200000-26+1) ~ 26*199975 ~ 5.2e6 -> acceptable.\n\n        But note: worst-case total n is 200000, but if we have many test cases with small n, then it's acceptable.\n\n        Therefore, we can complete the template by filling the break condition.\n\n        However, the template has:\n\n            for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We need to set ans = \"NO\" and break? \n\n        But the template sets ans = \"YES\" initially.\n\n        So:\n\n            ans = \"YES\"\n            for ...:\n                if ...:\n                    ans = \"NO\"\n                    break\n\n        Then print(ans)\n\n        Therefore, the missing code is:\n\n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\n        But note: we break to avoid unnecessary checks.\n\n        However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and the missing code is inside the if block and the for loop.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\n        But note: the template has:\n\n            for i in range(len(s)-len(var)+1):\n                if len(set(s[i:i+len(var)])) != len(var):\n                    # TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are to replace the TODO with two lines: \n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\n        However, we must be cautious: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", so we output:\n\n            ans = \"NO\"\n            break\n\n        But note: the problem says \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        However, this is for two programs? \n\n        The problem has two programs: program1.py and program2.py? \n\n        But the problem only provided one template: for program1.py? \n\n        Actually, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        But in the description, we only see one template for program1.py? \n\n        And the problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n        And the output format is a json with two keys: \"program1\" and \"program2\".\n\n        But we only have one program? \n\n        Let me reread: \n            \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\"\n\n        But the problem only provided one template? \n\n        And the example output format: \n            {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        So we must fill both? \n\n        However, the problem only provided one template (for program1.py) and did not provide program2.py? \n\n        And the command is: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\"\n\n        This implies that program1.py outputs something and program2.py reads from stdin and outputs the answer? \n\n        But the problem says: \"For each test case, print a single integer\" for the first problem (candies) and for the second problem (balanced string) it says \"print YES or NO\".\n\n        How are they connected? \n\n        The problem has two separate programs? \n\n        Actually, the problem has two parts: \n          - The first part (candies) is program1.py? \n          - The second part (balanced string) is program2.py? \n\n        But the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py with missing lines or blocks\"\n\n        And then we are given two templates? \n\n        But the problem only provided one template? \n\n        Actually, the problem has two descriptions? \n\n        Looking back: \n          - The first description is about candies (Alice and Bob) -> that is program1.py? \n          - The second description is about perfectly balanced strings -> that is program2.py? \n\n        And the command: \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" \n\n        This means that the output of program1.py is fed as input to program2.py? \n\n        But the two problems are independent? \n\n        How can that be? \n\n        The problem says: \"Output only the missing code so that \"python3 program1.py | program2.py\" runs correctly.\"\n\n        And the output format is a json with two keys.\n\n        Therefore, we must complete both programs.\n\n        But the problem provided two templates? \n\n        Actually, the problem provided:\n\n          # program1.py\n          ... (candies problem)\n\n          # program2.py\n          ... (balanced string problem)\n\n        But in the text, we see:\n\n          # program1.py\n          ... (candies problem template)\n\n          and then \n\n          # program2.py\n          ... (balanced string problem template)\n\n        But wait, the problem text only shows one template for program1.py (for the candies problem) and one template for program2.py (for the balanced string problem)? \n\n        However, the problem says: \"You will be given program1.py and program2.py\", meaning we have two separate templates.\n\n        And we must complete both.\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output only the missing code\", and then the json with two completions.\n\n        Therefore, we must complete:\n\n          program1.py: the candies problem (the first one)\n          program2.py: the balanced string problem (the second one)\n\n        And we have already deduced the solution for the balanced string problem (program2.py) using the template approach.\n\n        But what about program1.py? \n\n        We haven't solved the candies problem yet.\n\n        Let me go back to the candies problem.\n\n        Program1.py: \n          Description: There are n candies. Alice eats from the left, Bob from the right. They want the total weight eaten by Alice and Bob to be equal. What is the maximum total number of candies they can eat?\n\n          Input: \n            t test cases.\n            For each test case: \n                n\n                list of n integers: w1, w2, ... , wn\n\n          Output: For each test case, the maximum total number of candies eaten (which is the number of candies eaten by Alice plus the number eaten by Bob) such that the total weight of Alice equals that of Bob.\n\n          Example: \n            Input: \n                4\n                3\n                10 20 10\n                4\n                7 3 20 5\n                1\n                100\n                7\n                1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n            Output:\n                2\n                6\n                0\n                7\n\n          How to solve?\n            We are to choose a prefix (for Alice) and a suffix (for Bob) such that the prefix and suffix do not overlap and the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix. We want to maximize the total number of candies (len(prefix) + len(suffix)).\n\n          Note: The prefix must be contiguous from the left, and the suffix contiguous from the right.\n\n          Example 1: \n            n=3, [10,20,10]\n            Alice: [10] -> sum=10, Bob: [10] (the last candy) -> sum=10 -> total candies=2.\n            We cannot do more: if Alice takes [10,20] (sum=30) and Bob takes nothing -> not equal. Or Alice takes [10] and Bob takes [20,10] -> then Alice=10, Bob=30 -> not equal. Or Alice takes nothing and Bob takes [10,20,10] -> then Bob=40, Alice=0 -> not equal. So 2.\n\n          Example 2:\n            n=4, [7,3,20,5]\n            The example says 6. How?\n            They eat 6 candies in total: that means Alice eats 3 and Bob eats 3? But the total candies is 4 -> they must overlap? \n            But the problem: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So they cannot overlap.\n\n            How can they eat 6 candies? \n                Total candies is 4 -> they cannot eat 6.\n\n            Wait, the example output is 6? \n\n            Let me read the example again: \n                \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n            Alice: first three: [7,3,20] -> sum=30? \n            Bob: last three: [3,20,5] -> sum=28? \n\n            But the example says total weight 7? \n\n            Actually, the example says: \n                \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7)\" -> that doesn't add up: 7+3+20=30, not 7.\n\n            Let me check the example in the problem statement: \n                \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, ..., wn\"\n\n            Example 2: n=4, weights: 7, 3, 20, 5.\n\n            The example says: \n                \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\"\n\n            This is confusing.\n\n            Let me read the note again: \n                \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n            How can the first three from the left have total weight 7? \n                The first three: 7, 3, 20 -> 30.\n\n            And the first three from the right: 20, 5, ...? The first three from the right: the last three: 3,20,5 -> 28.\n\n            But the example says 7? \n\n            I see: the example says \"the first three from the left\" and then says \"with total weight 7\", but 7 is the first candy. \n\n            Actually, the example might be: \n                Alice: [7] (the first candy) -> sum=7.\n                Bob: [5] (the last candy) -> sum=5 -> not equal.\n\n            Then they try: \n                Alice: [7,3] -> 10\n                Bob: [5,20] -> 25 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n                Bob: [20,5] -> 25 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [7] -> 7\n                Bob: [5,20,3] -> 28 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [7,3] -> 10\n                Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [7] -> 7\n                Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [7,3] -> 10\n                Bob: [20,5] -> 25 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30\n                Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [3] -> 3\n                Bob: [20,5] -> 25 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [3,20] -> 23\n                Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [20] -> 20\n                Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n            Then:\n                Alice: [7,3,20,5] -> but then Bob eats nothing -> not equal.\n\n            How to get 6? \n\n            The example says: \"the first three from the left\" and \"the first three from the right\" -> but that would be the entire array? and they overlap on the middle two.\n\n            The problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So they cannot overlap.\n\n            The example says: \"the first three from the left\" (indices0,1,2) and \"the first three from the right\" (indices1,2,3) -> they overlap on indices1 and 2.\n\n            That is not allowed.\n\n            But the example output is 6? \n\n            And the total candies eaten is 6? That would be 3+3=6, but there are only 4 candies.\n\n            This is impossible.\n\n            I see: the example says: \n                \"the first three from the left\" and \"the first three from the right\" -> but note: the first three from the left are indices0,1,2 and the first three from the right are indices3,2,1 -> but then they overlap on 1 and 2.\n\n            The problem: \"Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row)\" -> so Bob's candies must be a contiguous suffix.\n\n            Therefore, Bob's candies are a contiguous segment at the end.\n\n            So Alice: [7,3,20] (indices0,1,2) and Bob: [5] (index3) -> total candies=4, not 6.\n\n            How 6? \n\n            The example says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\". \n\n            This is very confusing.\n\n            Let me check the sample input and output:\n\n                Input:\n                  4\n                  3\n                  10 20 10\n                  4\n                  7 3 20 5\n                  1\n                  100\n                  7\n                  1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n                Output:\n                  2\n                  6\n                  0\n                  7\n\n            The second test case output is 6.\n\n            How to get 6? \n\n            There are only 4 candies. They cannot eat 6 candies.\n\n            I see: the problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\"\n\n            But 6>4 -> impossible.\n\n            There must be an error in the example explanation.\n\n            Let me read the problem again: \n                \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row). Bob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\"\n\n            This means that Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix, and they must be disjoint.\n\n            The total number of candies eaten is the length of the prefix plus the length of the suffix.\n\n            In the second test case: \n                n=4, weights = [7,3,20,5]\n\n            How to get 6? \n\n            They cannot eat 6 candies because there are only 4.\n\n            I suspect the example explanation is for a different test case.\n\n            The sample input has a third test case: \n                1\n                [100] -> output 0.\n\n            Fourth test case: \n                7\n                [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> output 7.\n\n            How to get 7 in the fourth test case? \n                They eat all 7 candies? But then Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they must be disjoint -> if they eat all, then they overlap? \n\n                Alice eats the entire left? But then Bob eats nothing? Or vice versa? \n\n                The problem: Alice eats a contiguous prefix and Bob eats a contiguous suffix, and they are disjoint.\n\n                If Alice eats the entire array, then Bob eats nothing -> then the sums: Alice=28, Bob=0 -> not equal.\n\n                How to get 7? \n                    They must eat all candies and the sums must be equal? \n\n                If Alice eats [1,2,3,4] and Bob eats [5,6,7] -> then Alice=10, Bob=18 -> not equal.\n\n                If Alice eats [1,2,3,4,5] and Bob eats [6,7] -> 15 and 13 -> not equal.\n\n                If Alice eats [1,2,3] and Bob eats [5,6,7] -> 6 and 18 -> not equal.\n\n                If Alice eats [7] and Bob eats [7] -> but the two 7's? The array is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> only one 7.\n\n                How about: \n                    Alice: [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> sum=21, Bob: [7] -> 7 -> not equal.\n\n                Or Alice: [1,2,3,4] -> 10, Bob: [7,6,5] -> 18 -> not equal.\n\n                Or Alice: [3,4,5,6,7] -> 25, Bob: [1,2] -> 3 -> not equal.\n\n                The example says output 7.\n\n            I see: the example says for the fourth test case: \n                \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n            This is for the fourth test case? But the fourth test case has weights [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] -> not [7,3,20] and [10,8,11,1].\n\n            This is very confusing.\n\n            I think the example explanation for the second test case is actually for the fourth test case? \n\n            Let me reread the example explanation for the fourth test case: \n                \"For the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1], they each eat 30 weight. There is no better partition so the answer is 7.\"\n\n            But the fourth test case in the input is: \n                7\n                1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n            This does not match.\n\n            I think there is a mix-up in the example explanation.\n\n            Let me look at the sample input again:\n\n                t=4\n                test1: n=3, [10,20,10]\n                test2: n=4, [7,3,20,5]\n                test3: n=1, [100]\n                test4: n=7, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n\n            The example explanation for test2: \n                \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\n            This cannot be for test2 because the weights are [7,3,20,5] -> the first three from the left: 7+3+20=30, not 7.\n\n            The example explanation for test4: \n                \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\"\n\n            This does not match test4: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n\n            Therefore, I think the example explanation is for a different example.\n\n            Let me assume the sample input is as given, and we must solve the problem.\n\n            How to solve the candies problem?\n\n            We want to choose a prefix (possibly empty) and a suffix (possibly empty) that are disjoint and the sum of the prefix equals the sum of the suffix, and we want to maximize the total number of candies eaten (which is the length of the prefix plus the length of the suffix).\n\n            We cannot have overlap, so the prefix and suffix must be disjoint. This means that the prefix must end before the suffix starts.\n\n            We can try: \n                Let i be the number of candies eaten by Alice (from the left), and j be the number of candies eaten by Bob (from the right), and we require that i+j <= n and the prefix of length i and the suffix of length j are disjoint.\n\n            The sum of the prefix = A = w0 + w1 + ... + w_{i-1}\n            The sum of the suffix = B = w_{n-j} + ... + w_{n-1}\n\n            We want A == B, and we want to maximize i+j.\n\n            We can try two pointers:\n\n                Let left = 0, right = n-1\n                Let sumA = 0, sumB = 0\n                We can try to grow the prefix and suffix.\n\n                But note: we are allowed to choose any prefix and any suffix (not necessarily growing at the same time).\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                We iterate over the possible total number of candies eaten: from 0 to n (but note: they might not be contiguous in the middle) -> but the prefix and suffix are contiguous at the ends.\n\n                We can try every possible i from 0 to n, and for each i, we can try to find the largest j (from 0 to n-i) such that the suffix of length j has sum <= the current prefix sum, and then check if they are equal.\n\n            But the worst-case n=200000, and doing this for every i would be O(n^2) -> 200000^2 = 40e9 -> too slow.\n\n            We need a more efficient method.\n\n            We can use two pointers:\n\n                Let i = 0, j = 0 (both initially 0)\n                We will move i from 0 to n, and j from 0 to n, but we want to avoid overlap: i+j <= n.\n\n                We want to find pairs (i, j) such that the prefix sum of i equals the suffix sum of j.\n\n                We can do:\n\n                  i=0, j=0: sumA=0, sumB=0 -> they are equal, so candidate=0.\n                  Then we can try to increase either i or j.\n\n                We can use:\n\n                  i from 0 to n, and for each i, we add w[i] to sumA.\n                  Then while sumB < sumA and j < n-i, we can add from the suffix.\n\n                But note: the suffix is from the right, and if we increase j, we take w[n-1-j] (or we can precompute suffix sums).\n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                  left = 0, right = 0\n                  i = 0, j = 0\n                  best = 0\n                  while i+j < n:\n                      if sumA <= sumB:\n                          if i < n - j: \n                              sumA += w[i]\n                              i += 1\n                          else: break\n                      else:\n                          if j < n - i:\n                              sumB += w[n-1-j]\n                              j += 1\n                          else: break\n                      if sumA == sumB:\n                          best = i+j   # because i and j are the counts\n\n                  print(best)\n\n            But is that correct?\n\n            Example1: [10,20,10]\n                i=0, j=0: sumA=0, sumB=0 -> best=0, then since sumA<=sumB, we add w[0]=10 -> i=1, sumA=10.\n                Then sumA=10, sumB=0 -> sumA>sumB, so we add from the right: w[2]=10 -> j=1, sumB=10.\n                Then sumA==sumB, best=1+1=2.\n                Then we can try: \n                    now i+j=2<3, then sumA<=sumB? 10<=10 -> true, so we add w[1]=20 -> i=2, sumA=30.\n                Then i+j=3, and we break the while? \n                Then we output 2.\n\n            Example2: [7,3,20,5] \n                We want to achieve 6? but we only have 4 candies -> so 6 is not possible.\n\n                How about: \n                    We might achieve 4: \n                        Alice: [7,3] -> 10, Bob: [5,20] -> 25 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [7] -> 7, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [7,3,20] -> 30, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [3,20] -> 23, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [20] -> 20, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [7,3] -> 10, Bob: [20,5] -> 25 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [7] -> 7, Bob: [20,5] -> 25 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [3] -> 3, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [3] -> 3, Bob: [20,5] -> 25 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [7,3] -> 10, Bob: [5] -> 5 -> not equal.\n\n                How about Alice: [7] and Bob: [5,20,3] -> but that is not a contiguous suffix? \n                    The suffix must be contiguous: from the right, so Bob can only take [5] or [20,5] or [3,20,5] or [7,3,20,5] (but then overlap if Alice took any).\n\n                The only valid non overlapping:\n                    Alice takes a prefix and Bob takes a suffix, and the prefix and suffix do not overlap.\n\n                So the best we can do is 2: Alice takes [10] in the first example, or in the second example we cannot do 2? \n                    In the second example, can we do 2? \n                        Alice: [7] and Bob: [5] -> 7 and 5 -> not equal.\n                        Alice: [7] and Bob: [5,20] -> not contiguous? Bob must take contiguous from the right: [5,20] is not contiguous? \n                            The suffix contiguous: the last two are [20,5] -> so Bob can take [20,5] (sum=25) or [5] (sum=5). \n                        Alice: [7,3] and Bob: [5] -> 10 and 5 -> not equal.\n\n                So the best is 0.\n\n                But the example output for the second test case is 6? \n\n            I see the example input for the second test case is: \n                4\n                7 3 20 5\n\n            and the output is 6.\n\n            This is not possible.\n\n            I think there is a mistake in the example output.\n\n            Let me look for known solutions or known problems: \n                This is problem B of a contest: I recall a problem \"Candies\" (or \"Fair Candy\") in Codeforces.\n\n            I found: \n                https://codeforces.com/contest/1476/problem/B\n                But that is a different problem.\n\n            Another: \n                https://codeforces.com/contest/1343/problem/C\n\n            I recall: \n                There is a problem: \n                  https://codeforces.com/contest/1474/problem/B\n\n            But the sample input/output matches: \n                Input:\n                  4\n                  3\n                  10 20 10\n                  4\n                  7 3 20 5\n                  1\n                  100\n                  7\n                  1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n                Output:\n                  2\n                  6\n                  0\n                  7\n\n            And the sample explanation for the second test case: \n                \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right.
