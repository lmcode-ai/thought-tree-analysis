Example: \n                s = \"0001\" -> runs: ['000','1'] -> both odd. For the first run (i=1): length=3 (odd) -> then since p=0, we set p=1. For the second run (i=2): length=1 (odd) -> then we see p is 1 (non-zero), then we do: r += 2-1 = 1, and set p=0. Then the answer is 1.\n\n              How is 1 operation sufficient? We can change one character: Change the last character to '0': then we get \"0000\" -> one run of length 4 -> valid -> 1 operation. Example: \n                s = \"000111\" -> runs: ['000','111'] -> both odd. First run: i=1, odd -> set p=1. Second run: i=2, odd -> then r += 2-1 = 1, and p=0 -> total operations=1. How to fix with 1 operation? We can change one character: Change the last character of the first run (the third character) to '1': then we get \"001111\" -> runs: ['00','1111'] -> both even -> valid. But note: we could also change the first character of the second run to '0': then we get \"000011\" -> runs: ['0000','11'] -> both even. So one operation is enough. What about three runs? \n                s = \"0001110\" -> runs: ['000','111','0'] -> all odd. First run: i=1 -> p=1. Second run: i=2 -> odd -> then we do: r += 2-1 = 1, and set p=0. Third run: i=3 -> odd -> then we set p=3. Then we break? and we have p=3 at the end? But the code doesn't do anything after the loop? How about: \n                The problem says the total n over test cases <= 200000, and the provided code does not handle the leftover p?",

    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nWe are given t test cases. For each test case, a string s of length n (with characters 'W', 'R', 'B').\nWe need to determine if it is possible to obtain the string by performing any number of stamping operations.\n\nObservations for program1:\n- The stamp covers two adjacent cells and colors them as either RB or BR.\n- Each stamping operation must cover two adjacent cells that are completely within the string.\n- The same cell can be stamped multiple times.\n\nKey idea:\n1. Note that the stamping operation always changes two adjacent cells. Therefore, if we have an isolated non-white cell (i.e., a non-white cell that is adjacent to white cells on both sides and the string length is 1) then it's impossible. But note: the entire string might be non-white.\n\n2. Actually, we can break the string into segments separated by 'W'. Why?\n   Because the stamping operations on disjoint segments (separated by white) are independent.\n\n3. In each contiguous segment (without any 'W'), we can only have an even number of cells? Not exactly: the segment can be of any length, but note the operations always cover two adjacent cells.\n\n4. Important properties:\n   - The stamping operation flips the colors in a specific way? Actually, note that each stamping operation on a pair (i, i+1) sets the pair to either RB or BR. But multiple operations can be done on the same cell.\n\n5. Alternate approach (known from similar problems, e.g., Codeforces problems like \"Stamp Painting\" but specifically for two colors and adjacent):\n   - We note that the entire string must be partitioned into contiguous non-white segments. For each contiguous non-white segment (with no 'W' in between), we must check if it is possible.\n\n6. Known solution for such problems (e.g., from Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) or similar):\n   - We split the string by 'W'. Then for each segment:\n        - If the segment is empty, skip.\n        - The segment must have at least two cells? Actually, a segment of length 1 is impossible because the stamp always covers two adjacent cells. So if we have a segment of length 1, then it's impossible.\n\n   - But wait: what if the segment has more than one cell? We can also note that the entire segment must have at least one red and one blue? Why?\n        Consider: if the entire segment is all the same color (say all 'R'), then how can we achieve it?\n        We can use the stamp in overlapping ways. However, note that the stamp always produces one R and one B. So if we have an entire segment of R's, then we must have an even number of R's? Actually, no: because we can stamp multiple times on the same cell.\n\n        However, let's think about the parity of the number of each color? Actually, the operations can be thought of as toggling the color of a cell? But note: each operation flips two adjacent cells: one to R and one to B. But if we do two operations on the same pair, then we can get back to white? Actually, the problem states that each stamping operation recolors both cells. So if we stamp on the same pair twice, we get:\n          First stamp: RB (or BR)\n          Second stamp: then if we stamp again on the same pair, we can choose the opposite orientation? But note: the stamp can be applied arbitrarily. So if we have a pair that is currently RB and we stamp with BR, then we get BR? Actually, no: because the stamp sets the two cells to the two colors. So if we stamp with BR on a RB, we get BR. But then if we stamp again with RB, we get RB? So it's not additive.\n\n        Actually, the operation is not additive in the sense of toggling. It sets the two cells to the two colors. Therefore, the color of a cell is determined by the last stamp that covers it.\n\n        Alternate known solution (from known problems like \"Stamp Coloring\" or \"Stamp the Grid\") for the two-color adjacent stamp:\n\n        Insight: \n          - The entire string must be decomposable into adjacent pairs that are either RB or BR. But note: the same cell can be covered by multiple stamps. However, we can also note:\n\n        Known solution from Codeforces problems (e.g., problem B of Div4 or Div3 contests) for the same problem:\n\n        Steps:\n          - Split the string by 'W'\n          - For each segment (contiguous non-white part):\n               * If the segment has length 1 -> impossible.\n               * Also, if the segment has all the same color? Actually, that is impossible too? Why?\n                 Because: if we have a segment of length 2: we can get RB or BR, but not RR or BB? \n                 But wait: can we get RR? \n                    Example: \n                      Start: WW\n                      Step1: stamp on the two: say RB -> now we have RB.\n                      Then we stamp again on the same two: but we can choose to stamp as BR -> then we get BR? \n                      Or if we stamp as RB again, we get RB? \n                 Actually, we cannot get two R's in a row? \n\n                 However, consider a segment of three: \n                    We want RRR? \n                    How: \n                      Step1: stamp on positions 1-2: RB -> R B W\n                      Step2: stamp on positions 2-3: BR -> R B becomes R (from first cell) and then the second stamp: on 2-3: sets 2 to B and 3 to R? -> so we get R, B, R -> not RRR.\n\n                 How about:\n                    Step1: stamp on 1-2: BR -> B R W\n                    Step2: stamp on 1-2 again: RB -> R B W -> then we have R and B? \n\n                 Actually, we can never have two adjacent R's? \n\n                 But wait: the example in the problem: \n                    \"B R B B W\" -> so we have adjacent B's? \n\n                 How did they get two B's? \n                    Step1: WWWWW -> stamp on positions 3-4: RB -> WW R B W -> then stamp on positions 2-3: BR -> then position2 becomes B and position3 becomes R -> so we have W, B, R, B, W -> then stamp on positions 2-3 again? But that would change them? \n\n                 Actually, the example: \n                    Step1: WWWWW -> stamp on 3-4: RB -> WW R B W -> then stamp on 1-2: BR -> B R R B W -> then stamp on 2-3: RB -> B B R B W -> then we have B, B, R, B, W? \n\n                 But the example says: \n                    \"WWWWW -> WW RB W -> then BR RRB W -> then B R BB W\" \n\n                 Actually, the example: \n                    Step1: positions 3-4: set to RB -> so positions 3=R, 4=B -> string: WW R B W\n                    Step2: positions 1-2: set to BR -> so positions 1=B, 2=R -> string: B R R B W\n                    Step3: positions 2-3: set to RB -> so positions 2=R becomes B? and position 3=R becomes R? -> no, wait: the stamp sets both: so if we set positions 2-3 to RB, then position2 becomes R? and position3 becomes B? -> then we get: B, R, B, B, W -> which is the target.\n\n                 So we can have two adjacent B's? \n\n                 How? \n                    The key: the same cell can be stamped multiple times. The last stamp on a cell determines its color.\n\n                 Therefore, we can have two adjacent B's: by stamping the second cell multiple times.\n\n                 But then what are the constraints?\n\n        Known solution (from known problems) for this exact problem (e.g., Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4), problem C) is:\n\n          - We split the string by 'W'\n          - For each contiguous segment (without 'W'):\n               * If the segment length is 1 -> impossible -> return \"NO\"\n               * Otherwise, we check: the segment must contain at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'? \n                 Why? \n                 Because: if the entire segment is only one color, say all 'R', then we must have been able to produce it. But how?\n                 Actually, we cannot produce a segment of all 'R'? \n                    Consider: \n                      For two cells: we can only get RB or BR, not RR.\n                      For three cells: \n                         We can do:\n                            Step1: stamp on 1-2: RB -> R B W\n                            Step2: stamp on 2-3: BR -> R B becomes R (from first cell) and then the second stamp: on 2-3: sets 2 to B and 3 to R -> so we get R, B, R -> not RRR.\n\n                 How about four cells? \n                    We want RRRR.\n                    Step1: stamp on 1-2: RB -> R B W W\n                    Step2: stamp on 3-4: RB -> R B R B -> not RRRR.\n\n                 Actually, we can never have an entire segment of the same color? \n\n                 But wait: the example in the problem: \n                    \"B R B B W\" -> has two adjacent B's? \n\n                 However, the entire segment of the two B's? Actually, the segment we are considering is \"BB\", but note that the segment is \"B B\" and they are adjacent? \n\n                 How to get \"BB\"?\n                    We can do:\n                      Start: WW\n                      Step1: stamp on the two: BR -> then we get B and R? -> not BB.\n                    Then we stamp again on the same two: but then we can choose to stamp as RB -> then we get R and B? -> not BB.\n\n                 How about:\n                    Step1: stamp on the two: BR -> becomes B R\n                    Step2: stamp on the two again: BR again? -> then it becomes B R? \n                 But the stamp sets the two cells: so if we stamp with BR again, it sets the two to BR? \n\n                 Actually, the operation is not additive: it sets the two cells to the two colors. So we cannot get BB by stamping the same pair multiple times.\n\n                 However, what if we use overlapping? \n                    For three cells: \n                      We want to get the middle and the last as BB? \n                      Step1: stamp on 1-2: BR -> B R W\n                      Step2: stamp on 2-3: BR -> then the second stamp sets the second cell to B and the third to R? -> so we get B, B, R -> then we have two B's in the first two? \n\n                 But then the entire segment is three cells: and we have B, B, R -> which is not all B.\n\n                 How about four cells: \n                    We want the last two to be BB? \n                    Step1: stamp on 3-4: BR -> W W B R\n                    Step2: stamp on 2-3: BR -> W B R R -> then we have B and R at positions 2 and 3? \n                    Step3: stamp on 3-4: BR again -> then we set 3 and 4 to BR -> so we get W, B, B, R -> then we have two B's at positions 2 and 3? \n\n                 But we wanted the last two to be BB? \n\n                 Alternatively, \n                    Step1: stamp on 1-2: BR -> B R W W\n                    Step2: stamp on 2-3: RB -> B becomes B (unchanged for position1), then position2 becomes R (from the first stamp) and then we stamp on 2-3: RB -> sets position2 to R? and position3 to B? -> so we get B, R, B, W -> then we have two B's at positions 1 and 3? \n\n                 How to get two adjacent B's? \n                    We can do:\n                      Step1: stamp on 1-2: BR -> B R\n                      Step2: stamp on 1-2 again: but with RB -> then we set them to RB -> so we get R and B -> not BB.\n\n                 Actually, we can never get two adjacent B's? \n\n                 But the example in the problem: \"B R B B W\" -> which has two adjacent B's at the end? \n\n                 How they did it? \n                    Step1: WWWWW -> stamp on 3-4: RB -> so we get WW R B W -> positions: 3=R, 4=B.\n                    Step2: stamp on 1-2: BR -> so we get B R R B W -> positions: 1=B, 2=R, 3=R, 4=B.\n                    Step3: stamp on 2-3: RB -> so we set position2 and 3: to R and B? -> no, the stamp sets both: so if we use RB, then position2 becomes R? and position3 becomes B? -> then we get: B, R, B, B -> wait, position4 is still B? so we have B, R, B, B -> which has two adjacent B's at the end? \n\n                 But note: the two adjacent B's are at positions 3 and 4? \n                    After step1: position3=R, position4=B -> then step3: we stamp on 2-3: \n                         position2 was R (from step2) and position3 was R (from step2) -> then we stamp with RB: so position2 becomes R? and position3 becomes B? -> then we have: \n                         position1: B, position2: R (from step2) then changed to R?

It was set to B in step1 and then not stamped again? \n\n                 So we can have two adjacent B's? \n\n                 Therefore, the constraint is not that we cannot have two adjacent same colors? \n\n        After reading known solutions for Codeforces Round #784 (Div. 4) problem C: \n          Solution: \n            - Split the string by 'W'\n            - For each segment:\n                 if the segment is empty: continue\n                 if the segment has length 1: return \"NO\"\n                 if the segment has only one color (either only 'R' or only 'B'): then return \"NO\"\n\n          Why? \n            Because: \n              - The stamp always changes two adjacent cells to one R and one B. Therefore, in any contiguous segment that is stamped, we must have at least one R and at least one B.\n\n          Therefore, the solution for program1.py:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                # Split the string by 'W' to get contiguous non-white segments\n                segments = s.split('W')\n                valid = True\n                for seg in segments:\n                    if seg == '': \n                        continue\n                    # If the segment has length 1, impossible\n                    if len(seg) == 1:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    # Check if the segment has at least one 'R' and at least one 'B'\n                    if 'R' not in seg or 'B' not in seg:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n\n                print(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n\n        However, note: what if the entire string is white? Then we have no non-white segment -> valid.\n\n        But what if the string is \"W\"? Then n=1, and we split by 'W' -> we get ['', '']? Actually, for \"W\", split('W') returns ['','']? \n          Actually: \n            \"W\".split('W') -> ['', ''] -> then we skip the empty strings -> valid.\n\n        But the problem: the stamp cannot be applied to a single cell. So if the entire string is white, we don't need to stamp -> valid.\n\n        Also, what if the string is \"WWW\"? -> same.\n\n        But what if the string is \"R\"? -> then we get a segment of length 1 -> invalid -> \"NO\", which is correct.\n\n        However, what about a segment of length 2: \"RR\"? \n          We split: if the string is \"RR\", then split by 'W' -> ['RR'] -> then we check: \n             len(seg)=2 -> not 1 -> then check: does it have both 'R' and 'B'? -> it doesn't have 'B'. -> invalid -> \"NO\", which is correct because we cannot get \"RR\".\n\n        Similarly, \"BB\" -> invalid.\n\n        But what about \"RB\" or \"BR\"? \n          Then the segment has both 'R' and 'B' -> valid.\n\n        Also, what about \"RBRB\" -> valid? \n          But note: we can have multiple operations. The condition is that we must have at least one R and one B in the segment -> which we do.\n\n        Therefore, the solution for program1.py is as above.\n\n        However, note the constraints: the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so splitting and checking each segment is efficient.\n\n        So for program1.py, we write:\n\n            t = int(input().strip())\n            for _ in range(t):\n                n = int(input().strip())\n                s = input().strip()\n                segs = s.split('W')\n                ok = True\n                for seg in segs:\n                    if seg == '':\n                        continue\n                    if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n                        ok = False\n                        break\n                print(\"YES\" if ok else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the input reading in the provided code snippet is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n        This means: \n          [*open(0)] reads all lines.\n          [2::2] starts from index 2 (so the first line of the first test case is at index0: the t, index1: the n for the first test case, index2: the string for the first test case) and then every second line (so the next test case: index3: n, index4: string, etc.). \n\n        Therefore, the provided loop iterates over the strings of the test cases (the s in the test cases). \n\n        We must adjust: because the provided loop already gives us the string s for each test case.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                s = s.strip()\n                # then process the string s\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program1.py is:\n\n            segs = s.strip().split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg == '':\n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if ok else \"NO\")\n\n        However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, but the total length of all strings is the sum of n, which is <= 10^5. So we are safe.\n\n        But wait: what if a segment is very long? The condition 'R' not in seg and 'B' not in seg: we are scanning the entire segment. But the total length of all segments over test cases is <= 10^5.\n\n        So we can do.\n\n        But note: the provided code snippet for program1.py is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We must output the missing code for program1.py as a string to be placed in the TODO.\n\n        However, note: the problem says \"Output only the missing code\", and the entire program is already structured as a loop over the test case strings.\n\n        So we write:\n\n            segs = s.strip().split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg == '': continue\n                if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if ok else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the input string s might have a newline, so we use s.strip().\n\n        However, the problem says: the string s of length n. So the newline is at the end? We should remove it.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: s = s.rstrip() to remove the trailing newline and any other trailing whitespace.\n\n        But the problem: the string s only contains 'W','R','B'. So using strip() is safe.\n\n        But note: the next test case string might be read in the next iteration. Since we are using [*open(0)][2::2], each s is a line including the newline. So we should strip.\n\n        However, what if the string has spaces? It doesn't.\n\n        So we do: s = s.strip()\n\n        But wait: the problem says the string s of length n. So if we strip, we remove the newline and get a string of length n.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: s = s.rstrip('\\n') to remove only the newline. But the problem says the string only has 'W','R','B', so no spaces. So strip() is safe.\n\n        But note: the problem says \"The second line of each test case contains a string s\", so it is the entire line and then a newline.\n\n        So we can do: s = s.strip()\n\n        However, the provided code in the problem for program1.py already has:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n\n        and then we do:\n\n            s = s.strip()\n\n        But we can also do:\n\n            s = s.rstrip()\n\n        But to be safe, we do s.strip().\n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid an extra variable by:\n\n            segs = s.strip().split('W')\n\n        Then we process.\n\n        But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n        Now for program2.py:\n\n        Description: \n          We are given a binary string s of even length n. We want to split s into contiguous subsegments of the same character, and we want each subsegment to have even length. We can change any character to '0' or '1' any number of times. We want the minimum number of operations.\n\n        Steps:\n          - The problem is the easy version and the code is already provided with a loop that uses regex to split the string into runs of 0's and 1's.\n\n          The code:\n\n            import re\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                i=p=r=0\n                for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n                    i+=1\n                    if len(t)&1:\n                        if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n                        else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n          We need to complete the TODO.\n\n        Observations:\n\n          The problem: we want to make the entire string good, meaning that when we split it into contiguous segments of the same character (minimal number of segments), each segment has even length.\n\n          We can change any character arbitrarily.\n\n          How to minimize the operations?\n\n          Note: the entire string length is even.\n\n          Idea: \n            We can consider the runs (consecutive same characters). The current run lengths might be odd or even.\n\n          We are allowed to change a character, which can break a run and merge with adjacent runs? \n\n          Actually, changing a character in the middle of a run of 1's to 0 will break it into two runs of 1's? Actually, it becomes two runs of 1's separated by a run of one 0? But then we can change that 0 to 1? \n\n          Alternatively, we can think greedily: we traverse the runs and whenever we see an odd-length run, we can fix it by either:\n            - Extending the next run to make the current even? \n            - Or breaking the run?\n\n          However, note the known solution for this problem (from Codeforces problems) is:\n\n            We traverse the runs of consecutive same characters. We note that we can merge adjacent runs of the same character? But the problem requires minimal contiguous subsegments (so we merge adjacent same characters). \n\n          The problem: we want the minimal number of operations so that when we split the string into contiguous segments of same characters (maximal runs), each run has even length.\n\n          How to solve:\n\n            We can use dynamic programming? But note the constraints: the total n over test cases <= 200000, and the sum of n over test cases <= 200000? Actually, the problem says the sum of n over test cases <= 200000.\n\n          However, the provided code uses:\n\n            for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):   # this splits the string into runs\n\n          Then it iterates over the runs. For each run t, it increments i (which is the index of the run). Then if the run length is odd, then:\n\n            if p: \n                r += i - p\n                p = 0\n            else:\n                ...   # TODO\n\n          What is p? It is initially 0.\n\n          The variable r is the answer (the number of operations) for the test case.\n\n          How does this work?\n\n          Known solution from known problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #789 (Div. 2) problem B1) for the same problem:\n\n            We note that we can fix the runs by merging adjacent runs? Actually, we can change a character to break a run and then merge with the next? \n\n          Insight:\n\n            We can consider the runs. We want every run to be even. \n\n            Operation: changing a character can break a run and merge two adjacent runs? \n\n            Actually, if we change a character at the boundary between two runs, we can merge two runs? \n\n            Example: \n                s = \"000\" (run: ['000'] -> length 3, odd) -> we can change the middle character to 1: then we get \"010\", which splits into: '0','1','0' -> each of length 1 (odd) -> not good.\n\n            Alternatively, we can change the last character: then we get \"001\", which splits into: '00','1' -> then the first run is even (2) and the second is odd (1). \n\n            How about: \n                We can change one character to merge two adjacent runs? \n\n            Example: \n                s = \"000111\" -> runs: ['000','111'] -> both odd. \n                We can change the middle of the first run? \n                    Change the last character of the first run: from '0' to '1': then we get \"00111\" -> runs: ['00','111'] -> then the first run is even, the second is odd. \n                Then we change the first character of the second run to '0': then we get \"00011\" -> runs: ['000','11'] -> both odd? \n\n            Alternatively, we can change the middle of the entire string? \n                Change the third character to '1': then we get \"00111\" -> runs: ['00','111'] -> then we change the fourth character to '0': then we get \"00101\" -> runs: ['00','1','0','1'] -> all length 1 -> odd.\n\n            How about: \n                Change the third character to '1' and the fourth to '0': then we get \"001101\" -> runs: ['00','11','0','1'] -> not all even.\n\n            Actually, we can do:\n\n                We can merge two adjacent runs of the same color? But they are separated by a run of the opposite color? \n\n            Alternate known solution (from known problems) for the easy version:\n\n              We note that we can fix the entire string by making the entire string alternating? But then the runs would be of length 1, which is odd. \n\n            However, we can also make the entire string one run? Then the length is even -> valid. \n\n            The minimal operations: we can consider the cost to make the entire string alternating? \n\n            But note: the problem does not require alternating. It requires that the runs are of even length.\n\n            We can have two runs: \n                Example: n=4: \"0000\" -> one run of length 4 -> valid -> 0 operations.\n                \"0011\" -> two runs of length 2 -> valid -> 0 operations.\n\n            How about \"0001\": \n                We can change the last '1' to '0': then we get \"0000\" -> one run -> valid -> 1 operation.\n                Or change the last '0' to '1': then we get \"0001\" -> runs: ['000','1'] -> both odd -> not valid? \n                Actually, if we change the last character to '0', we get \"0000\" -> valid.\n\n            How about \"0101\": \n                runs: ['0','1','0','1'] -> each of length 1 -> odd -> not valid.\n                We can change the second character to '0': then we get \"0001\" -> runs: ['000','1'] -> both odd -> not valid.\n                Change the second character to '1': then we get \"0111\" -> runs: ['0','111'] -> both odd -> not valid.\n\n            How about change two characters? \n                Change the second and the fourth: \n                    Change the second to '1': then \"0111\" -> then change the fourth to '0': then \"0110\" -> runs: ['0','11','0'] -> runs of length 1,2,1 -> the 2 is even, but the 1's are odd -> not valid.\n\n            Alternatively, change the second and the third to '0': then \"0001\" -> then we can change the last to '0' -> \"0000\" -> 3 operations.\n\n            But we can do better: \n                Change the second character to '0' and the third to '0': then we get \"0001\" -> then we change the last to '0' -> 3 operations? \n                Or: \n                Change the first character to '1': then \"1101\" -> runs: ['11','0','1'] -> not valid.\n                Change the second character to '0' and the fourth to '0': then \"0000\" -> 2 operations.\n\n            How about: \n                We can merge adjacent runs? \n\n            Known solution from known problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #789 (Div. 2) problem B1, easy version) is:\n\n              The answer is the number of runs that have odd length? But then we can fix two runs with one operation? \n\n            Actually, the known solution for the easy version:\n\n              We can fix the entire string by making the runs of even length by merging adjacent runs? \n\n              We note that if we have two consecutive runs of the same color, we can merge them by changing the entire run in between to that color? \n\n              But the minimal operations? \n\n            Insight from the provided code structure:\n\n              The code uses:\n                i = index of the current run (starting at 0? but i starts at 0 and then we do i+=1 at the beginning of the loop -> so the first run has i=1)\n                p: initially 0, then when we see an odd run, if p is nonzero then we do: r += i - p, and then set p=0. Otherwise, if p is 0, then we set p to the current run index i.\n\n              Then at the end, we print r.\n\n            How does this work?\n\n              Example: \n                s = \"0001\" -> runs: ['000','1'] -> both odd. \n                For the first run (i=1): length=3 (odd) -> then since p=0, we set p=1.\n                For the second run (i=2): length=1 (odd) -> then we see p is 1 (non-zero), then we do: r += 2-1 = 1, and set p=0.\n\n                Then the answer is 1.\n\n              How is 1 operation sufficient? \n                We can change one character: \n                  Change the last character to '0': then we get \"0000\" -> one run of length 4 -> valid -> 1 operation.\n\n              Example: \n                s = \"000111\" -> runs: ['000','111'] -> both odd.\n                First run: i=1, odd -> set p=1.\n                Second run: i=2, odd -> then r += 2-1 = 1, and p=0 -> total operations=1.\n\n              How to fix with 1 operation? \n                We can change one character: \n                  Change the last character of the first run (the third character) to '1': then we get \"001111\" -> runs: ['00','1111'] -> both even -> valid.\n\n              But note: we could also change the first character of the second run to '0': then we get \"000011\" -> runs: ['0000','11'] -> both even.\n\n              So one operation is enough.\n\n            What about three runs? \n                s = \"0001110\" -> runs: ['000','111','0'] -> all odd.\n                First run: i=1 -> p=1.\n                Second run: i=2 -> odd -> then we do: r += 2-1 = 1, and set p=0.\n                Third run: i=3 -> odd -> then we set p=3.\n                Then we break? and we have p=3 at the end? \n\n            But the code doesn't do anything after the loop? \n\n            How about: \n                The problem says the total n over test cases <= 200000, and the provided code does not handle the leftover p? \n\n            However, note: the entire string length is even. The sum of the lengths of the runs is even. The number of runs with odd length must be even? Why?\n\n              Because: \n                Let the runs have lengths: l1, l2, ..., lk.\n                We want to make each li even. The operation of changing one character can affect the runs: it can break a run and merge adjacent runs? \n\n            Actually, the known solution: \n                We pair the runs with odd length. For every two consecutive runs (in the order of the string) that are odd, we can fix them with one operation? \n\n            How? \n                We change the boundary between the two runs? \n\n            But note: the two runs are of the same color? No, they are of alternating colors. \n\n            Example: \n                runs: [odd_run1, even_run, odd_run2] -> but we don't care about even runs? \n\n            Actually, the provided code: \n                It only considers the index of the run. When we have two consecutive odd runs (in the order of the runs, not necessarily adjacent in the string if there are even runs in between) we fix them with one operation? \n\n            How? \n                The operation: we change one character at the boundary between the two runs? \n\n            But note: the runs are alternating. So the boundary between two consecutive runs is of different colors. \n\n            How can one operation fix two runs? \n\n            Example: \n                s = \"000111\" -> runs: ['000','111'] -> two consecutive runs (the first is 0's, the second is 1's). \n                We change the last character of the first run (which is a '0') to '1'. Then the first run becomes \"00\" (even) and the second run becomes \"1111\" (even). \n\n            How did that happen? \n                The first run becomes \"00\" (the first two) and the last character becomes part of the second run? \n\n            Exactly: \n                The change at the boundary: \n                  Original: ...0 1... (the boundary: the last character of the first run and the first character of the second run are adjacent and different)\n                We change the last character of the first run to '1': then we get ...1 1... -> so the last character of the first run becomes the same as the next run, so the two runs merge? \n\n                Then the entire run becomes: the first run becomes the first two characters \"00\", and the second run becomes the rest: \"1111\"? \n\n                Actually, the entire string becomes \"00111\" -> but wait, we changed the third character to '1', so the string becomes \"00111\" -> then the runs: \n                  The first two: \"00\" -> run of 0's of length 2 -> even.\n                  Then the rest: \"111\" -> run of 1's of length 3 -> odd? \n\n            Why did the second run become 4? \n\n            Actually, we changed the third character (which was the last of the first run) to '1'. Then the string becomes \"00111\". \n                The runs: \n                  The first two: \"00\" -> run of 0's (length2)\n                  Then the next three: \"111\" -> run of 1's (length3) -> still odd.\n\n            That doesn't fix the second run.\n\n            Alternatively, we change the first character of the second run? \n                Change the fourth character (the first of the second run) to '0': then we get \"000011\" -> runs: \n                  \"0000\" -> even, then \"11\" -> even.\n\n            How did that fix both runs? \n                The first run: originally \"000\" -> we added one more 0? by changing the first character of the second run to 0, then the first run becomes \"0000\" (even) and the second run becomes \"11\" (even).\n\n            But note: the boundary: \n                Original: ...0 (last of first run) and then 1 (first of second run). \n                We change the first character of the second run to 0: then we get ...0 0... -> so the last character of the first run and the new 0 are adjacent and same -> so they merge.\n\n            Therefore, the first run becomes \"0000\" (length4) and the second run becomes the rest: \"11\" (length2).\n\n            So one operation fixed both runs? \n\n            But note: we fixed two runs with one operation? \n\n            Therefore, the idea: \n                We can fix two consecutive odd runs (in the order of the runs) with one operation by changing the first character of the second run to the opposite of what it is (which is the same as the first run's character) -> then the two runs become one big run? \n\n            But wait, then we have one big run? \n                The entire segment becomes one run? Then the length is the sum of the two runs plus one? (because we changed one character to merge them) -> but we only changed one character? \n\n            Actually, we changed one character at the boundary: \n                The first run: [0...0] (length a, odd) and the second run: [1...1] (length b, odd). \n                We change the first character of the second run to 0: \n                  Then the first run becomes [0...00] (length a+1, even) and the second run becomes [1...1] (but without the first character) -> so the second run becomes of length b-1, which is even? \n\n            But wait: the second run: we changed the first character to 0, so the second run now starts at the next character? \n                Example: \n                  Original: 000 111 -> positions: [0,1,2] are '0', [3,4,5] are '1'\n                  Change the first character of the second run (position3) to '0': \n                    Then we have: \"000011\" -> \n                    The runs: \n                      from index0 to index3: '0' repeated -> length=4 -> even.\n                      then index4 to index5: '1' repeated -> length=2 -> even.\n\n            How did the first run become 4? \n                Because we added one more '0' at position3, so the first run now extends to position3.\n\n            And the second run now starts at position4? and has two '1's? \n\n            Therefore, we broke the second run: the first character of the second run was changed to 0, so the second run now starts at the next character? \n\n            But note: the entire string is contiguous. After the change, the character at position3 is now 0, which is the same as the previous run, so the two runs (the first run and the changed character) merge? \n\n            Then the entire first run becomes the first four characters: \"0000\", and then the rest is \"11\". \n\n            So we fixed two runs with one operation.\n\n            What if we have three consecutive odd runs? \n                Example: \"000111000\" -> runs: ['000','111','000'] -> all odd.\n                We fix the first two: change the first character of the second run (which is at the start of the second run) to 0: \n                    Then we get: \"0000111000\" -> runs: \n                         first run: \"0000\" (even) -> then the next: \"111\" (odd) -> then \"000\" (odd) -> then we have two odd runs left.\n                Then we fix the next two: change the first character of the third run to 1? \n                    Then we get: \"0000111100\" -> runs: \n                         \"0000\", \"1111\", \"00\" -> all even.\n\n                Total operations: 2.\n\n            How does the code work for three runs? \n                First run (i=1): odd -> set p=1.\n                Second run (i=2): odd -> then we do: r += 2-1 = 1, and set p=0.\n                Third run (i=3): odd -> then we set p=3.\n                Then we break? and we have p=3 at the end? \n\n            But the problem: we have an unpaired run? \n\n            However, note: the entire string length is even. The sum of the runs is even. The number of runs with odd length must be even? \n                Because: \n                  The total length = sum of runs.\n                  We want to make each run even -> so the total length mod2 is the sum of the parities mod2. \n                  Initially, the total length is even -> so the number of runs with odd length must be even.\n\n            Therefore, we will always have an even number of odd runs.\n\n            So the algorithm: \n                We traverse the runs. We keep a variable p that records the index of the last unpaired odd run. \n                When we encounter an odd run:\n                  if p is 0 (meaning we don't have an unpaired odd run), then we set p to the current run index i.\n                  else (we have an unpaired odd run at index p), then we do: \n                         r += i - p\n                         p = 0   (we pair the current run with the one at p)\n\n            Why i-p? \n                The operation: we fix two runs that are separated by (i-p-1) runs? \n                But note: the runs are consecutive in the string. The operation we do is to change one character at the boundary between the two runs? \n\n            Actually, the operation we do is one operation per pair. But the cost is one operation per pair? \n\n            However, the code does: r += i - p.\n\n            In the example of two consecutive runs: \n                i=2, p=1 -> r += 2-1 = 1 -> which is the one operation.\n\n            In the example of three runs: \n                First odd run: p=1.\n                Second odd run: i=2 -> r += 2-1 = 1, then p=0.\n                Third odd run: then we set p=3.\n                Then we break? but we have an even number of odd runs? so we need to pair the third run with a fourth? \n\n            How about four runs? \n                Example: four odd runs: \n                    i=1: set p=1.\n                    i=2: r += 2-1=1, p=0.\n                    i=3: set p=3.\n                    i=4: r += 4-3=1, p=0 -> total r=2.\n\n            But the operation count: we need two operations.\n\n            However, the code does: r += i-p, which is 1 for each pair.\n\n            Therefore, the total operations is the number of pairs? \n\n            But wait: the example of two runs: one operation -> one pair -> one operation -> matches.\n            The example of four runs: two operations -> matches.\n\n            But why i-p? \n                The variable i is the index of the current run. The variable p is the index of the previous unpaired odd run.\n\n                The difference i-p is the number of runs between the two odd runs? \n\n            Actually, the runs are in order. The index i is just the count (the first run is 1, the second is 2, etc.). \n\n            Why do we add the difference in indices? \n\n            Example: \n                runs: [run1 (odd), run2 (even), run3 (odd)] \n                Then for run1: set p=1.\n                Then run2: skip (even).\n                Then run3: odd -> then we do: r += 3-1 = 2.\n\n            But we only need one operation to fix the two odd runs? \n\n            Why 2 operations? \n\n            How do we fix run1 and run3? \n                We can change one character at the boundary between run1 and run2? \n                But that boundary is between run1 (which is 0's) and run2 (which is 1's). Changing a character at that boundary: \n                  If we change the last character of run1 to 1: then run1 becomes even (if it was length 3, then becomes 2) and then run2 becomes ...? \n                    Actually, we break run1: the last character becomes 1, so run1 becomes the first two (if it was 3) and then the last character becomes part of run2? \n                    Then run2 becomes: the original run2 plus that last character? \n                    Then run2 becomes even? because originally run2 was even, then we add one character -> odd? \n\n                Alternatively, we change the first character of run2? \n                  Then we merge run1 and run2? \n                  Then run1 becomes run1+run2 (if we change the first character of run2 to 0) -> then the entire run1 becomes even? (because run1 was odd, run2 was even: odd+even = odd, then we add one character? -> no, we changed one character: so the first character of run2 becomes 0, then run1 becomes the original run1 plus that one 0 -> so length = odd+1 = even? \n                  Then run2 becomes the rest of the original run2 (without the first character) -> which is even-1 = odd? \n                  Then we still have an odd run? \n\n            How about changing the boundary between run2 and run3? \n                Change the first character of run3 to the same as run2? \n                  Then run2 and run3 merge? \n                  Then run2 becomes even (because originally even) plus one character (the changed one) -> then even+1 = odd? \n                  Then run3 becomes the rest -> odd-1 = even? \n                  Then we have: run1 (odd), run2 (odd) -> then we need to fix run1 and run2? \n\n            It seems we need two operations? \n\n            But note: we can fix two non-adjacent odd runs with one operation? \n\n            Actually, we can fix them independently? \n                We can fix run1 by changing one character at the boundary between run1 and run2: \n                  Change the last character of run1 to the opposite? Then run1 becomes even (if it was 3, then 2) and then the next run (run2) becomes ...? \n                  The last character of run1 becomes 1, so it becomes part of run2? Then run2 becomes: the original run2 (even) plus one character -> odd? \n                Then we fix run3: we change the last character of run2 (which is now the boundary between run2 and run3) to the opposite of run2? \n                  Then run2 becomes even (because we remove the last character? and then run3 becomes ...? \n\n            Alternatively, we can do:\n\n                Operation1: change the last character of run1 to 1 -> then:\n                  run1: becomes even (if originally 3, then 2) -> fixed.\n                  run2: becomes the original run2 plus one 1 at the beginning? -> then run2 becomes: if originally run2 was \"1111\" (even), then now becomes \"11111\" (odd) -> not fixed.\n\n                Operation2: then we fix run2 and run3: \n                  We change the first character of run3 to 1? -> then run2 becomes: the current run2 (which is odd) and then we merge with run3? \n                  But run3 is 0's? we change the first character of run3 to 1: then run2 becomes run2 plus that one 1? -> then run2 becomes even? and run3 becomes the rest (which is odd-1 -> even? if run3 was 3, then becomes 2) -> fixed.\n\n                Total 2 operations.\n\n            Therefore, the minimal operations for two non-adjacent odd runs is 2.\n\n            And the code: \n                For run1 (i=1): set p=1.\n                For run2 (i=2): even -> skip.\n                For run3 (i=3): odd -> then we do: r += 3-1 = 2.\n\n            So it matches.\n\n            Why is the cost i-p? \n                The cost is the difference in the run indices? \n                The run indices are consecutive: 1,2,3,... \n                The number of operations is the difference in the indices? \n\n            But note: the runs are in order. The difference in indices is the number of runs between the two odd runs? \n\n            Actually, the difference in indices is the gap in the run count. \n\n            Why is the cost 2 for two odd runs that are separated by one even run? \n                Because we need two operations? \n\n            Therefore, the algorithm: \n                We pair the odd runs in the order they appear. The cost for a pair (the j-th odd run and the k-th odd run) is k - j.\n\n            But note: the j-th odd run is at index j (in the run list) and the k-th at index k. The cost is k-j.\n\n            Why? \n                Because we cannot fix them with one operation? we need one operation per run in between? \n\n            Actually, the known solution: \n                The minimal operations is the number of odd runs divided by 2? \n                But the example: \n                  2 odd runs: cost=1 -> 2/2=1 -> matches.\n                  4 odd runs: cost= (2-1)+(4-3)=1+1=2 -> 4/2=2 -> matches.\n                  3 odd runs: not possible? because the total number of odd runs must be even.\n\n            But the example with three runs: \n                runs: [odd, even, odd] -> two odd runs -> cost= (3-1)=2 -> which is 2 operations.\n\n            How is the cost 2? \n                Because the two odd runs are separated by one even run -> we need two operations.\n\n            Therefore, the algorithm: \n                We traverse the runs. For each run:\n                  if the run length is odd:\n                    if p is 0 (meaning we don't have an unpaired odd run), then set p = i (the current run index)\n                    else:\n                         r += i - p   (add the difference in indices)\n                         p = 0\n\n            Then the answer is r.\n\n            Therefore, the TODO in program2.py is:\n\n                else:\n                    p = i   # set p to the current run index\n\n            But note: the code already has:\n\n                i=p=r=0\n                for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n                    i+=1\n                    if len(t)&1:\n                        if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n                        else: \n                            # TODO: set p to i\n\n            So we write: p = i\n\n            However, note: the variable i is the current run index (starting at 1 for the first run).\n\n            Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n                p = i\n\n            But note: the problem says the entire string length is even, so the number of odd runs is even. We don't have to worry about leftover p.\n\n        Therefore, the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            p = i\n\n        But note: the code after the loop does nothing. And we are setting p only for the first odd run in a pair.\n\n        So the complete code for program2.py is:\n\n            import re\n            for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:\n                i = p = r = 0\n                for t in re.findall('0+|1+', s.strip()):   # note: we should strip the string s to remove newline?\n                    i += 1\n                    if len(t) % 2 == 1:   # odd length\n                        if p: \n                            r += i - p\n                            p = 0\n                        else:\n                            p = i\n                print(r)\n\n        However, the provided code does not have the strip? \n\n        But the problem: the string s might have a newline. The re.findall might include the newline? \n\n        We should do: s = s.strip() and then use s? \n\n        But the code: \n\n            for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n\n        Here s is the line from the input, which might have a newline. The regex '0+|1+' will not match the newline, so it's safe.\n\n        But what if the string has a newline at the end? Then the last run might be matched? \n\n        Actually, the regex will match the entire string because the string only contains 0 and 1? \n\n        But the problem says: the string s is a binary string of zeros and ones. \n\n        So we don't need to strip? \n\n        However, the example: \n            s = \"000111\\n\" -> then re.findall('0+|1+', s) will work: it will ignore the newline? \n\n        Actually, the regex will match the runs of 0's and 1's and stop at the newline. \n\n        But the problem: the string s is the entire line? \n\n        We can do: s = s.strip() to be safe.\n\n        But the provided code does not do that. \n\n        Alternatively, we can change the loop to:\n\n            for t in re.findall('0+|1+', s.strip()):\n\n        But the problem says: the total n over test cases <= 200000, and the sum of n <= 200000, so stripping each string is O(n) and acceptable.\n\n        However, the provided code snippet does not have the strip. \n\n        But note: the problem says \"Do NOT output the entire program or explanations or any additional information.\" and \"Output only the missing code\".\n\n        The provided code for program2.py already has:\n\n            import re\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:\n                i=p=r=0\n                for t in re.findall('0+|1+',s):\n                    i+=1\n                    if len(t)&1:\n                        if p:r+=i-p;p=0\n                        else:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are only to complete the TODO. \n\n        Therefore, we only write: \n\n            p = i\n\n        for the else block.\n\n        But note: the code after the TODO is not provided. We must complete the else block.\n\n        So the missing code for program2.py is:\n\n            p = i\n\n        However, we must be careful: the indentation. The else block is at the same level as the if p: block.\n\n        Therefore, the code for the else block is:\n\n            p = i\n\n        But note: the code after the else: we have a comment \"# TODO: Your code here\", so we replace that comment with \"p = i\".\n\n        But the problem says: \"Output the missing code, NOT as markdown code.\" and in the format: {\u201cprogram1\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d, \u201cprogram2\u201d: \u201ccompletion\u201d}\n\n        We write the completions as strings.\n\n        However, note: the completions are code snippets that must be inserted.\n\n        For program1.py, the completion is:\n\n            segs = s.strip().split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg == '':\n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if ok else \"NO\")\n\n        But note: the program1.py already has a for loop that iterates over the test case strings. We are replacing the TODO in the loop.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, the completion is:\n\n            p = i\n\n        But note: the else block is only one line.\n\n        Therefore, the JSON:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"segs = s.strip().split('W')\\nok = True\\nfor seg in segs:\\n    if seg == '':\\n        continue\\n    if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\\n        ok = False\\n        break\\nprint(\\\"YES\\\" if ok else \\\"NO\\\")\",\n                \"program2\": \"p = i\"\n            }\n\n        However, note: the program1.py code must be indented properly? The original loop is:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the TODO with the above block. The block is multiple lines.\n\n        Similarly, for program2.py, the TODO is inside a for loop and an if block.\n\n        We output the code exactly as it should appear.\n\n        But note: the program1.py code: we must be careful with the indentation. The for loop in program1.py is at the top level, so the code we insert must be at the same indentation level? \n\n        Actually, the provided code for program1.py has:\n\n            for s in[*open(0)][2::2]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n        We are replacing the comment with a block of code that is indented by 4 spaces per level.\n\n        We write the code as a string with newlines and the necessary indentation.\n\n        However, the problem does not specify the indentation level. We assume 4 spaces per level.\n\n        But the original program1.py: the for loop is at level 0, then the block inside the for loop should be indented.\n\n        We write the code for program1.py as:\n\n            segs = s.strip().split('W')\n            ok = True\n            for seg in segs:\n                if seg == '':\n                    continue\n                if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n                    ok = False\n                    break\n            print(\"YES\" if ok else \"NO\")\n\n        This is 7 lines.\n\n        For program2.py, we write:\n\n            p = i\n\n        This is one line.\n\n        Now, we must escape the quotes? \n\n        In the JSON, we must escape the double quotes and the backslashes.\n\n        But the problem says: output the json.\n\n        We can write:\n\n            {\n                \"program1\": \"segs = s.strip().split('W')\\nok = True\\nfor seg in segs:\\n    if seg == '':\\n        continue\\n    if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\\n        ok = False\\n        break\\nprint(\\\"YES\\\" if ok else \\\"NO\\\")\",\n                \"program2\": \"p = i\"\n            }\n\n        However, note: the program1 string has double quotes in the print statement. We escape them with backslash.\n\n        Alternatively, we can use single quotes in the print statement? But the code uses double quotes.\n\n        We write the print statement as: print(\"YES\" if ok else \"NO\") -> so we have double quotes. In the JSON string, we must escape the double quotes.\n\n        Therefore, we write: \n            print(\\\"YES\\\" if ok else \\\"NO\\\")\n\n        Similarly, the condition: \n            if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\n\n        We have single quotes, so we don't need to escape.\n\n        But the entire string for program1 is a string in JSON, so we must escape any double quotes and backslashes.\n\n        We do:\n\n            \"program1\": \"segs = s.strip().split('W')\\nok = True\\nfor seg in segs:\\n    if seg == '':\\n        continue\\n    if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\\n        ok = False\\n        break\\nprint(\\\"YES\\\" if ok else \\\"NO\\\")\"\n\n        And program2: \n\n            \"program2\": \"p = i\"\n\n        Now, we output the JSON.\n\n        Note: the entire output must be a valid JSON.\n\n        We write:\n\n            {\"program1\": \"segs = s.strip().split('W')\\nok = True\\nfor seg in segs:\\n    if seg == '':\\n        continue\\n    if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg):\\n        ok = False\\n        break\\nprint(\\\"YES\\\" if ok else \\\"NO\\\")\", \"program2\": \"p = i\"}\n\n        But note: the program1 code has a condition: \n            if len(seg)==1 or ('R' not in seg) or ('B' not in seg)\n\n        This is correct.\n\n        However, we can optimize: \n            if len(seg)==1: then we break -> invalid.\n            if the segment does not contain 'R' -> then it must be all 'B' -> invalid.\n            if the segment does not contain 'B' -> then it must be all 'R' -> invalid.\n\n        So the condition is correct.\n\n        Therefore, we output the JSON as above."
