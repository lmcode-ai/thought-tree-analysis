Actually, we can break the problem:\n\n We can count:\n   For Case 1: (differ in first, same second)\n        For a fixed second character c, and for two different first characters x and y, the pair (x, c) and (y, c) would be counted.\n        But note: we cannot have the same string? Actually, the same string might appear multiple times? The problem does not say distinct.\n\n        However, note: the input is n strings, and they can be repeated.\n\n        How to count for a fixed second character c?\n          Let F(c) = frequency of each first character for strings that have second character c.\n          Then for a fixed c, the number of pairs of strings that have the same second character c and different first characters is:\n             total = sum_{x} F(c)[x]\n             Then the pairs = for each x, F(c)[x] * (total - F(c)[x])\n          But note: this counts each pair twice? Actually, (x,y) and (y,x) are the same and we want unordered pairs. However, we are iterating over x and then multiplying by (total - F(c)[x]) which counts every unordered pair exactly once? Actually, no: because for two distinct x and y, the pair (x,y) is counted when we are at x and also at y? So we would count each pair twice.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: total*(total-1)//2 - sum_{x} [ F(c)[x]*(F(c)[x]-1)//2 ] \n        but that counts all pairs of strings with second character c and then subtracts the ones that have the same first character? Actually, we don't want that.\n\n        Actually, we want the pairs that have different first characters. So we can do:\n          total = T\n          Then the number of pairs with same first character for this c is: for each x, F(c)[x]*(F(c)[x]-1)//2? \n          But wait, we don't want that. We want the pairs that have different first characters: that is total pairs (T*(T-1)//2) minus the pairs that have the same first character.\n\n        However, note: we are only counting pairs that have the same second character and different first character. So we can do:\n\n          For fixed c, the total pairs of strings with second character c is T*(T-1)//2? But that is not what we need: because we are going to count pairs that have the same first character? Actually, we don't want to subtract? We want the pairs that have different first characters.\n\n        Alternatively, we can do: \n          For each distinct first character x in the group of second character c, we can count the pairs that have first character x and then the pairs that have a different first character? Actually, we can do:\n\n          total_pairs = 0\n          for x in group_c:\n             for y in group_c: \n                 if x != y: then add F(c)[x] * F(c)[y] \n          but that is O(11^2) per group, which is acceptable because there are at most 11 letters.\n\n        However, we can do without the double loop: \n          total = T = sum_{x} F(c)[x]\n          Then the sum of F(c)[x] * F(c)[y] for x != y = (T*T - sum_{x} F(c)[x]^2) // 2   [because (a+b)^2 = a^2+b^2+2ab, so ab = ( (a+b)^2 - a^2 - b^2 ) / 2, and then extend to multiple: the sum of products for distinct pairs is (T^2 - sum squares)/2 ]\n\n        But note: we are counting unordered pairs? Yes, and the formula (T^2 - sum_sq) // 2 gives the unordered pairs of distinct first characters? Actually, it counts every unordered pair (x,y) with x != y exactly once? Actually, no: because if we have three groups: a, b, c: \n          T = a+b+c\n          T^2 = a^2+b^2+c^2 + 2(ab+ac+bc)\n          Then (T^2 - (a^2+b^2+c^2)) = 2(ab+ac+bc) -> so ab+ac+bc = (T^2 - (a^2+b^2+c^2))//2.\n\n        So for fixed c, the count for Case 1 (differ in first, same second) is: (T^2 - sum_{x} (F(c)[x])^2) // 2.\n\n        But wait: is that the same as the pairs of strings that have the same second character and different first? Actually, no: because each string is represented by (x, c) and (y, c). And we are counting the pairs of strings? Yes.\n\n        However, note: the above formula counts every unordered pair of two different first characters? And that is exactly what we want for Case 1? But note: we are counting pairs of strings that have the same second character and different first characters. So yes.\n\n   Similarly, for Case 2: (same first, different second)\n        We fix the first character, say f, and then group by the second character? \n        Then for a fixed f, let G(f) be the frequency of each second character for strings that have first character f.\n        Then the count for fixed f is: (U^2 - sum_{c} (G(f)[c])^2) // 2, where U = total number of strings with first character f.\n\n But note: we cannot use the same grouping? Actually, we can do:\n\n   We can create two dictionaries:\n     dict1: key = first character, value = dictionary for second character counts? Actually, we don't need that.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n     For Case 1: \n        We want to group by the second character. So:\n          group_by_second = defaultdict(dict)  # but actually we don't need nested dict? We can do: \n          group_by_second: a dictionary where key is the second char, and then we have a frequency of first chars? Actually, we don't need the first char breakdown? We only need the total per second char and the breakdown per first char for that second char.\n\n        Actually, we can do:\n          group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n          for each string s = xy:\n             group_by_second[y][x] += 1\n\n        Then for each second char y, we have a dictionary of first chars. Then T = total for y = sum(group_by_second[y].values())\n        Then the count for Case 1 for this y is: (T*T - sum( v*v for v in group_by_second[y].values() )) // 2\n\n     Similarly, for Case 2:\n        group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        for each string s = xy:\n            group_by_first[x][y] += 1\n        Then for each first char x, U = total for x = sum(group_by_first[x].values())\n        Then the count for Case 2 for this x is: (U*U - sum( v*v for v in group_by_first[x].values() )) // 2\n\n   Then total pairs = (sum over y of Case1 for y) + (sum over x of Case2 for x)\n\n However, note: what about pairs that are identical? Actually, the problem says \"differ in exactly one position\". If two strings are identical, then they don't differ in any position? So they are not counted. Also, in our Case1 and Case2, we are only counting pairs that have the same second char (for Case1) and same first char (for Case2) and then we subtract the same first char pairs? Actually, in Case1 we are subtracting the pairs that have the same first char? No: in the group for a fixed second char, we are counting pairs that have different first chars. So identical strings? They would be in the same group and same first char? But if two strings are identical, they have the same first and same second. So they are in the same group for both Case1 and Case2? But in Case1: for a fixed second char, if we have two identical strings, they have the same first char so they are not included in the Case1 count (because we subtract the same first char pairs). Similarly for Case2. So we are safe.\n\n But wait: what if we have two identical strings? They are not counted in either case? That's correct because they don't differ in any position.\n\n However, note: the problem does not say distinct strings. So we might have duplicates. But our method counts pairs of indices. So if we have two identical strings at indices i and j, then they form a pair? But they are not counted because they don't have exactly one difference? They have zero differences. So we are safe.\n\n But note: the above method counts each pair that has exactly one difference exactly once? \n   Consider a pair (s, t) that has the first character different and the second same. Then it is counted in Case1 (in the group of the common second character). \n   Similarly, if the first is same and second different, then it is counted in Case2.\n\n   And there is no overlap: because if they differ in exactly one position, then either the first is different and the second same (Case1) or the first same and the second different (Case2). They cannot be both.\n\n Therefore, the total is the sum of Case1 and Case2.\n\n However, note: the constraints say that the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we can iterate over the groups.\n\n Steps for program1.py:\n\n   t = int(input().strip())\n   for each test case:\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # We'll create two grouping dictionaries:\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))  # key: second char, then first char -> count\n        group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))   # key: first char, then second char -> count\n\n        for s in strings:\n            first, second = s[0], s[1]\n            group_by_second[second][first] += 1\n            group_by_first[first][second] += 1\n\n        total_pairs = 0\n\n        # Case 1: same second, different first\n        for second_char, first_char_counts in group_by_second.items():\n            total = sum(first_char_counts.values())\n            sq_sum = 0\n            for count in first_char_counts.values():\n                sq_sum += count * count\n            # The number of unordered pairs in this group that have different first characters:\n            # total pairs in the group: total*(total-1)//2, but we want the ones that are not same first char? \n            # Actually, we can use: (total*total - sq_sum) // 2   -> because this counts every pair (x,y) with x and y being different first chars? \n            # But note: the formula (total^2 - sq_sum) // 2 is exactly the sum over distinct first chars: for each first char x, we have count_x * (total - count_x) and then we divide by 2 because we count each pair twice? \n            # Actually, the formula without division by 2 would be the sum of count_x * (total - count_x) which counts each pair (x,y) twice? (once for x and once for y) -> no, because for two distinct first chars x and y, the term for x: count_x * (total - count_x) includes count_x * count_y, and the term for y: count_y * (total - count_y) also includes count_y * count_x. So we have 2 * (count_x * count_y). Therefore, the entire expression without division by 2 is 2 * (the number of unordered pairs of distinct first chars). So we must divide by 2.\n\n            total_pairs += (total*total - sq_sum) // 2\n\n        # Case 2: same first, different second\n        for first_char, second_char_counts in group_by_first.items():\n            total = sum(second_char_counts.values())\n            sq_sum = 0\n            for count in second_char_counts.values():\n                sq_sum += count * count\n            total_pairs += (total*total - sq_sum) // 2\n\n        print(total_pairs)\n\n But note: the problem says the answer may be large and we must use 64-bit integers. In Python, integers are arbitrary precision, but we are doing integer arithmetic. The total_pairs might be large (like nC2) so we are safe.\n\n However, note: the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, so the above loops over groups: the groups are by the 11 letters, so each group_by_second and group_by_first will have at most 11 keys per outer key? Actually, the outer keys are the letters (11) and the inner keys are also 11. So the inner loops are over at most 11 elements. So the entire thing is O(n) per test case (because we iterate over the n strings) and then O(11 * (number of distinct outer keys)) for the grouping, which is O(11*11) per test case? Actually, the distinct outer keys for group_by_second: the second char can be one of 11, so at most 11. Similarly for group_by_first: at most 11. So the inner loops are over 11 elements per group, and there are at most 11 groups per dictionary? So total for one test case: 11*11 for group_by_second and 11*11 for group_by_first -> 242, which is constant.\n\n Therefore, we can do this.\n\n But note: the problem says the total n over test cases <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n However, the original code had a variable `x` and `mul` and a double loop. We are replacing that.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from the point after reading the input until the print(co). We are replacing the inefficient double loop.\n\n But note: the original code had a variable `co` that is printed. We are using `total_pairs`.\n\n Let me write the code for program1.py:\n\n   for ii in range(int(input())):\n        n = int(input())\n        strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # If we have no strings, then skip.\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n\n        for s in strings:\n            a, b = s[0], s[1]\n            group_by_second[b][a] += 1\n            group_by_first[a][b] += 1\n\n        total_pairs = 0\n\n        # Case 1: same second char, different first char\n        for char_b, inner_dict in group_by_second.items():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = 0\n            for count in inner_dict.values():\n                sq_sum += count * count\n            total_pairs += (total_in_group * total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n\n        # Case 2: same first char, different second char\n        for char_a, inner_dict in group_by_first.items():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = 0\n            for count in inner_dict.values():\n                sq_sum += count * count\n            total_pairs += (total_in_group * total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n\n        print(total_pairs)\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases is <= 10^5, but note that the test cases are multiple and the sum of n is <= 10^5. So we are safe.\n\n But wait: the original code had a variable `a` and `x` and `mul` and `co`. We are replacing the entire inner part.\n\n So the missing code for program1.py is the entire block from after reading n until the print(co). But note the original code had:\n\n        a=[] \n        co=0 \n        x=set() \n        for jj in range(n): \n            a.append(input()) \n\n We are going to replace from the for-loop that appends until the print(co). Actually, we can use the list `a` we built.\n\n Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        a = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        # Then we do the grouping.\n\n But note: the original code had a set `x` and a double loop that we are removing.\n\n So the completion for program1.py is:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        a = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n\n        for s in a:\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n\n        total_pairs = 0\n\n        for inner_dict in group_by_second.values():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n            total_pairs += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n\n        for inner_dict in group_by_first.values():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n            total_pairs += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n\n        print(total_pairs)\n\n However, note: the original code had a variable `co` that is printed. We are using `total_pairs` and then printing it. So we can set `co = total_pairs` and then print(co) to match the variable? But the original code prints `co`. \n\n Alternatively, we can just print(total_pairs) and remove the variable `co`? The original code had:\n\n        co = 0\n        ... then the double loop that we are removing, then print(co)\n\n We are replacing the double loop and the set `x` and the variable `mul` with our grouping. So we can do:\n\n        co = total_pairs\n\n But we are not using the set `x` and the double loop. So we can remove them.\n\n So the code for program1.py becomes:\n\n        n = int(input())\n        a = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        for s in a:\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n        co = 0\n        for inner_dict in group_by_second.values():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n            co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n        for inner_dict in group_by_first.values():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n            co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n        print(co)\n\n But note: the division by 2: we are using integer division (//) and the expression (T^2 - sq_sum) is even? \n   Why? Because T = total_in_group, and T^2 mod 2 = (sum of counts)^2 mod 2 = (sum of squares mod 2) + twice the products mod 2. But note: the expression T^2 - sq_sum is the sum of 2 * (all the products of distinct counts). So it is even. So integer division is safe.\n\n However, in Python, if we use // with integers, it will be integer division. And the numbers are nonnegative.\n\n Now, for program2.py:\n\n The problem: \n   We have t test cases. The first line is t, then t lines each with a rating.\n\n   We need to output:\n        Division 1: if rating >= 1900\n        Division 2: if 1600 <= rating <= 1899\n        Division 3: if 1400 <= rating <= 1599\n        Division 4: if rating <= 1399\n\n   The input: first line is t, then t lines with the rating.\n\n   The code given: \n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n            # TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are to process each test case.\n\n   We note that the ratings can be negative? Yes, from -5000 to 5000.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        for line in [*open(0)][1:]:\n            rating = int(line.strip())\n            if rating >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif rating >= 1600:   # then it must be between 1600 and 1899\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif rating >= 1400:   # then between 1400 and 1599\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\")\n\n   But note: the conditions: \n        Division 1: 1900 and above -> rating>=1900\n        Division 2: 1600 to 1899 -> rating>=1600 and rating<=1899? But we can write:\n\n        if rating >= 1900: Division 1\n        elif rating >= 1600: Division 2   [because if it's >=1600 and <1900, then it falls here? But note: the first condition already caught >=1900, so this is 1600<=rating<=1899? Actually, no: because if rating is 2000, it's caught by the first. So the second condition is for 1600<=rating<1900? But the problem says 1600 to 1899, inclusive. So 1600 is included in Division2? Yes.\n\n        Similarly, Division 3: 1400 to 1599 -> we can do: elif rating>=1400: then Division3? But then 1400 to 1599 is included, and also 1600 and above are already taken by the previous conditions? So yes.\n\n        And the rest: Division4.\n\n   However, note: the problem says:\n        Division 4: rating <= 1399\n\n   So if rating is 1399, then it's Division4. 1400 is Division3.\n\n   So the conditions are:\n\n        if rating >= 1900: Division 1\n        elif rating >= 1600: Division 2   [because 1600<=rating<=1899]\n        elif rating >= 1400: Division 3   [because 1400<=rating<=1599]\n        else: Division 4\n\n   This matches.\n\n   But note: the input is read as [*open(0)][1:], which is a list of lines including the newline. We should strip the newline.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n            rating = int(n.strip())\n            if rating >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif rating >= 1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif rating >= 1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\")\n\n   However, the variable name `n` is a bit confusing, but it's just a string from the input.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        t = [*open(0)]\n        for i in range(1, len(t)):\n            rating = int(t[i].strip())\n            ... \n\n   But the given code uses a for loop over [*open(0)][1:], so we can use that.\n\n   So the completion for program2.py is:\n\n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:\n            r = int(n.strip())\n            if r >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif r >= 1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif r >= 1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\")\n\n Now, we must output in the specified JSON format.\n\n   { \"program1\": \"completion for program1\", \"program2\": \"completion for program2\" }\n\n But note: the completions must be the exact code that is missing? \n\n For program1.py, the original code had:\n\n        for ii in range(int(input())):\n            n=int(input())\n            a=[]\n            co=0\n            x=set()\n            for jj in range(n):\n                a.append(input())\n            # Then the double loop that we are replacing.\n\n We are replacing from the for-loop that builds the list `a` until the print(co). Actually, we are replacing the entire block after building the list `a` and the double loop.\n\n Specifically, we are replacing:\n\n            for jj in range(n):\n                mul=1\n                if jj not in x:\n                    for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                        ... \n            print(co)\n\n with:\n\n            from collections import defaultdict\n            group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n            for s in a:\n                c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n                group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n                group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n            co = 0\n            for inner_dict in group_by_second.values():\n                total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n                sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n                co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n            for inner_dict in group_by_first.values():\n                total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n                sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n                co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n            print(co)\n\n But note: the original code had a variable `x` and `mul` that we are not using. We are removing them.\n\n However, the problem says: \"Output only the missing lines or blocks that you must fill in.\" and \"Do NOT output the entire program\".\n\n We are replacing a block. The block we are replacing is from the line after the last a.append(input()) until the print(co). But note the original code had a double loop and a set `x` and a variable `mul`. We are replacing that entire block.\n\n But the original code had:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\n            mul=1\n            if jj not in x:\n                for kk in range(jj+1,n):\n                    ... \n\n        print(co)\n\n We are replacing that entire block (the double loop and the set operations) with our grouping code.\n\n So the completion for program1.py is the string:\n\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        for s in a:\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n        co = 0\n        for inner_dict in group_by_second.values():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n            co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n        for inner_dict in group_by_first.values():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n            co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n\n And then we leave the print(co) as it is? But note: the original code had the print(co) at the end. We are not replacing that.\n\n However, the problem says: the missing lines or blocks. The original code had a TODO in the double loop? Actually, the TODO was in the elif branch for when the two strings are identical. But we are replacing the entire double loop.\n\n So we are replacing the entire block from the for jj in range(n) to the end of the inner loops? and then we leave the print(co). But note: the original code had:\n\n        for jj in range(n):\n            ... (a long block)\n\n        print(co)\n\n We are replacing the entire for jj in range(n) loop and the inner for kk loop with our grouping code. And we are setting co to the new value.\n\n Therefore, the completion for program1.py is the code above.\n\n But note: the original code had a set `x` and a variable `mul` that we are not using. We are removing them. So we don't need to set `x` or `mul`.\n\n For program2.py, the original code had:\n\n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n We are replacing the TODO with:\n\n            r = int(n.strip())\n            if r >= 1900:\n                print(\"Division 1\")\n            elif r >= 1600:\n                print(\"Division 2\")\n            elif r >= 1400:\n                print(\"Division 3\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Division 4\")\n\n But note: the TODO is in the for loop. So we must indent properly.\n\n However, the problem says: output the missing code, not the entire program.\n\n So for program1.py, the missing block is the entire block we wrote above (without the print(co) because the print(co) is already there).\n\n But wait: the original code had the print(co) at the end. We are not replacing that. So we are replacing the block from after the for-loop that builds `a` until the print(co) with our grouping code and then the print(co) remains.\n\n Actually, the original code had:\n\n        for jj in range(n):   # this is the loop that builds a? No, that was already done. This is a new loop.\n\n        print(co)\n\n We are replacing the entire for jj in range(n) and the inner for kk in range(jj+1, n) and the set operations.\n\n So the completion for program1.py is the string:\n\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        group_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        group_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\n        for s in a:\n            c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\n            group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\n            group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\n        co = 0\n        for inner_dict in group_by_second.values():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n            co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n        for inner_dict in group_by_first.values():\n            total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\n            sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\n            co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\n\n And then the existing print(co) remains.\n\n But note: the original code had a set `x` and a variable `mul` that we are not using. We are removing them. So we don't need to set `x` or `mul`.\n\n For program2.py, the missing code is the body of the for loop.\n\n So the completion for program2.py is:\n\n        r = int(n.strip())\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\"Division 1\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\"Division 2\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\"Division 3\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Division 4\")\n\n Now, we must output in JSON.\n\n However, note: the code might have newlines and quotes. We must escape the string appropriately for JSON? But the problem says to output the JSON with the completions as strings.\n\n We can write:\n\n   {\n     \"program1\": \"from collections import defaultdict\\ngroup_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\ngroup_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfor s in a:\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n    group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\\nco = 0\\nfor inner_dict in group_by_second.values():\\n    total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\\n    sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\\n    co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\\nfor inner_dict in group_by_first.values():\\n    total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\\n    sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\\n    co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\",\n     \"program2\": \"r = int(n.strip())\\nif r >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif r >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif r >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n   }\n\n But note: the program2.py code has double quotes inside the string. We must escape them.\n\n Alternatively, we can use single quotes for the JSON keys and then use double quotes inside the string? But the problem says to output JSON.\n\n We can escape the double quotes in the string for program2: \n        print(\\\"Division 1\\\") -> becomes \\\"print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\\"\n\n But the problem does not specify the exact escaping, but we are to output valid JSON.\n\n Alternatively, we can use triple quotes? But the problem says to output the missing code as a string.\n\n We'll do:\n\n   \"program1\": \"the code string with newlines as \\n and escaped quotes if any\"\n\n   In program1, we don't have any quotes in the code? We have single quotes in the code: s[0], s[1] -> these are single quotes, so no problem.\n\n   In program2, we have double quotes in the print statements. So we must escape them.\n\n   So for program2, the string is:\n\n        r = int(n.strip())\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\n        else:\n            print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\n\n   We replace every double quote with \\\".\n\n   But note: the original code in program2.py had the for loop: for n in [*open(0)][1:]: and then the body. We are only providing the body? Yes.\n\n   And the body is indented? In the for loop, so we must have the same indentation? The problem does not specify, but we can use 4 spaces per indent? The original code used 4 spaces? The problem did not specify, but we can use 4 spaces.\n\n   However, the problem says: output the missing code. The missing code for program2 is the body of the for loop, so we write it with the same level of indentation as the TODO? Actually, the TODO was at the same line as the for. But we are writing multiple lines. We must indent the body.\n\n   But note: the original code had:\n\n        for n in [*open(0)][1:]:# TODO: Your code here\n\n   We are replacing the TODO with a block of code that is indented. So we write the code with 4 spaces for the inner block.\n\n   However, the problem does not specify the exact indentation, but we can use 4 spaces.\n\n   So the program2 completion string is:\n\n        r = int(n.strip())\n        if r >= 1900:\n            print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\n        elif r >= 1600:\n            print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\n        elif r >= 1400:\n            print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\n        else:\n            print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\n\n   But note: the variable `n` in the for loop is a string from the input. We are using `n` as the variable. That's what the original for loop uses.\n\n   We'll output the JSON.\n\n   Important: the entire output must be a valid JSON.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"from collections import defaultdict\\ngroup_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\ngroup_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfor s in a:\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n    group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\\nco = 0\\nfor inner_dict in group_by_second.values():\\n    total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\\n    sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\\n    co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\\nfor inner_dict in group_by_first.values():\\n    total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\\n    sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\\n    co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\",\n          \"program2\": \"r = int(n.strip())\\nif r >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\"Division 1\\\")\\nelif r >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\"Division 2\\\")\\nelif r >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\"Division 3\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\"Division 4\\\")\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program1 string has a line: \n        for s in a:\n   and then we use s[0] and s[1]. This is correct.\n\n   And the program2 string uses the variable `n` from the for loop.\n\n   We are done.\n\n However, note: the problem says the total n over test cases for program1 is <= 10^5, so we are safe.\n\n Let me test with the example: \n   Example 1: \n        n=5, strings: [\"ab\", \"cb\", \"db\", \"aa\", \"cc\"]\n        We expect 5 pairs.\n\n        Let's compute:\n          group_by_second: \n            'b': for second char 'b': first chars: 'a','c','d' -> counts: a:1, c:1, d:1 -> total=3, sq_sum=1+1+1=3 -> (9-3)//2 = 3\n            'a': for second char 'a': first char 'a': count=1 -> total=1, sq_sum=1 -> (1-1)//2=0\n            'c': for second char 'c': first char 'c': count=1 -> total=1, sq_sum=1 -> 0\n\n          Case1: 3+0+0 = 3\n\n          group_by_first:\n            'a': second chars: 'b','a' -> counts: b:1, a:1 -> total=2, sq_sum=1+1=2 -> (4-2)//2=1\n            'c': second chars: 'b','c' -> counts: b:1, c:1 -> total=2, sq_sum=2 -> (4-2)//2=1\n            'd': second chars: 'b' -> total=1, sq_sum=1 -> 0\n\n          Case2: 1+1+0 = 2\n\n          Total = 3+2 = 5 -> matches.\n\n   Example 2: \n        n=6, strings: [\"aa\", \"aa\", \"cc\", \"ac\", \"ca\", \"aa\"]\n        Actually, the example in the note: \n          The pairs: \n            (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n          But note: the example says: \n            For the second test case the pairs that differ in exactly one position are: \n                (\"aa\", \"ac\"), (\"aa\", \"ca\"), (\"cc\", \"ac\"), (\"cc\", \"ca\"), (\"ac\", \"aa\") and (\"ca\", \"aa\")\n          However, note that (\"aa\",\"ac\") and (\"ac\",\"aa\") are the same pair? Because the problem says pairs of indices (i,j) with i<j. So if we have:\n            s0 = \"aa\", s1 = \"aa\", s2 = \"cc\", s3 = \"ac\", s4 = \"ca\", s5 = \"aa\"\n\n          Then the pairs (i,j) with i<j and exactly one difference:\n\n          Let me list the strings by index:\n            0: \"aa\"\n            1: \"aa\"\n            2: \"cc\"\n            3: \"ac\"\n            4: \"ca\"\n            5: \"aa\"\n\n          Pairs that are (0,3): \"aa\" and \"ac\" -> differ in second char? Actually: \n            \"aa\": first char 'a', second 'a'\n            \"ac\": first char 'a', second 'c' -> same first, different second -> Case2: count.\n\n          (0,4): \"aa\" and \"ca\": \n            first char: 'a' vs 'c' -> different, second char: 'a' vs 'a' -> same -> Case1: count.\n\n          (0,1): \"aa\" and \"aa\": same -> skip.\n          (0,2): \"aa\" and \"cc\": two differences -> skip.\n          (0,5): \"aa\" and \"aa\": same -> skip.\n\n          (1,3): \"aa\" and \"ac\": same as (0,3) -> Case2: count.\n          (1,4): \"aa\" and \"ca\": same as (0,4) -> Case1: count.\n          (1,2): skip (two differences)\n          (1,5): same -> skip.\n\n          (2,3): \"cc\" and \"ac\": \n            first char: 'c' vs 'a' -> different, second char: 'c' vs 'c'? Actually, \"cc\" -> second char is 'c', \"ac\" -> second char is 'c'? Actually, \"ac\": second char is 'c'. So same second?

But the problem says JSON, and JSON standard requires double quotes for keys and strings.\n\n   We'll output the JSON with double quotes and escape the inner double quotes.\n\n   Final output:\n\n        {\n          \"program1\": \"from collections import defaultdict\\ngroup_by_second = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\ngroup_by_first = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))\\nfor s in a:\\n    c1, c2 = s[0], s[1]\\n    group_by_second[c2][c1] += 1\\n    group_by_first[c1][c2] += 1\\nco = 0\\nfor inner_dict in group_by_second.values():\\n    total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\\n    sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\\n    co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\\nfor inner_dict in group_by_first.values():\\n    total_in_group = sum(inner_dict.values())\\n    sq_sum = sum(count*count for count in inner_dict.values())\\n    co += (total_in_group*total_in_group - sq_sum) // 2\",\n          \"program2\": \"r = int(n.strip())\\nif r >= 1900:\\n    print(\\\\\\\"Division 1\\\\\\\")\\nelif r >= 1600:\\n    print(\\\\\\\"Division 2\\\\\\\")\\nelif r >= 1400:\\n    print(\\\\\\\"Division 3\\\\\\\")\\nelse:\\n    print(\\\\\\\"Division 4\\\\\\\")\"\n        }\n\n   But note: the program2 string has the word \"Division\" and then a space and then a number. We have escaped the double quotes.\n\n   We are done."
