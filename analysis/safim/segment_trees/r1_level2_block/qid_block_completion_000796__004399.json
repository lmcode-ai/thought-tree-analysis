    "original_reasoning": "We are given two programs to complete.\n\nFor program1.py:\nThe problem is about two people (Alice and Bob) eating candies from the ends and trying to have the same total weight while maximizing the total number of candies eaten.\n\nThe provided code uses a deque and a while loop. The current approach is:\n  - We have a deque `l` of the candies.\n  - `a` and `b` are the total weights eaten by Alice and Bob respectively.\n  - `cur` is the current count of candies eaten.\n  - `ans` is the answer (maximum total candies when a==b).\n\nThe current code does:\n  In each iteration, it increments `cur` (which counts the total candies eaten so far?).\n  Then, if a>=b, it pops from the right (so Bob eats one more candy) and adds to b.\n  Otherwise, there is a TODO.\n\nBut note: the problem says Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right. The current code only pops from the right when a>=b. What about when a < b? Then we should let Alice eat from the left.\n\nSo the TODO part should be:\n            a += l.popleft()\n\nHowever, note that the condition is: if a>=b, then Bob eats (from the right). Otherwise, Alice eats (from the left). This is because when a < b, we need to increase a to catch up.\n\nBut there is a problem: the condition `if a>=b` leads to Bob eating, which might overshoot. Also, we are only updating the answer when a==b.\n\nHowever, the problem is that we are not necessarily traversing the entire array? We are popping until the deque is empty. But note: the problem says they cannot eat the same candy. So we have to simulate until all candies are eaten? But the goal is to maximize the total number of candies when the two totals are equal.\n\nBut note: we are only updating `ans` when a==b. And we are counting every candy we eat in `cur`. However, we are not stopping when we have an overlap? Actually, the deque will be popped until empty, but we might have a situation where the two pointers cross? Actually, the deque will be empty at the end, but we are updating `ans` every time a==b. So we are capturing every moment when the two totals are equal, and the last such moment is the one with the most candies? But note: we are not stopping when the two pointers meet? Actually, the deque is being popped until empty, so we are going to simulate the entire eating. However, the problem says that they cannot eat the same candy, so when the deque becomes empty, we have eaten all.\n\nBut the example: \n  For the first test case: [1,2] -> Alice eats 1 (a=1), then Bob eats 2 (b=2) -> then a>=b? 1>=2? no, so then we would do the else: but the deque is not empty? Actually, after the first two steps, the deque becomes empty? \n\nWait, the initial deque is [1,2]. \n  Step1: cur=1, a=0, b=0 -> a>=b? yes, so we pop from right: b=2. Then check: a==b? 0==2? no.\n  Step2: cur=2, now a=0, b=2 -> a>=b? 0>=2? no -> so we do the else: we pop from left: a=1. Then check: a==b? 1==2? no.\n  Then the deque is empty -> break. But we never set ans? because a never equals b.\n\nBut the expected answer is 2. So we must set ans when a==b at step2? Actually, after step1: a=0, b=2 -> not equal. After step2: a=1, b=2 -> not equal.\n\nSo what went wrong? The example says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\". So they each eat one candy. How do we represent that?\n\nWe should not be starting with 0 for both. We should let Alice eat from the left and Bob from the right until they meet. And we want to record the total number of candies when the two totals are equal.\n\nAlternative approach: use two pointers (left and right) and two prefix sums. We can have:\n  a = 0, b = 0\n  left = 0, right = n-1\n  ans = 0\n  while left <= right:\n      if a <= b:\n          a += w[left]\n          left += 1\n      else:\n          b += w[right]\n          right -= 1\n      if a == b:\n          ans = left + (n-1-right)   # because left is the next for Alice, so Alice has eaten left candies, Bob has eaten n-1-right candies.\n\nBut note: the problem says the total number of candies eaten is the count. So when a==b, we record the total as (left) [from Alice] + (n-1-right) [from Bob].\n\nHowever, the provided code uses a deque and pops. We can adjust the provided code to use two pointers without deque? But the provided code uses a deque and pops. Alternatively, we can fix the provided code.\n\nThe issue in the provided code is that it increments `cur` at every step, but `cur` is the total number of candies eaten so far. However, when we pop from the left or right, we are effectively eating one candy. So `cur` is the total count. But we are only setting `ans = cur` when a==b. So we are capturing the total count at the moment when a==b. But we are continuing until the deque is empty. So the last time a==b is recorded? But we want the maximum total candies. So we should record the maximum `cur` for which a==b.\n\nBut the example: [1,2] \n  Step1: pop right -> b=2, cur=1 -> a!=b -> no update.\n  Step2: pop left -> a=1, cur=2 -> a!=b -> no update.\n\nBut we never get a==b? \n\nWe must note: the example says they eat one each. So we should have a moment when a==b? Actually, after step1: a=0, b=2 -> not equal. After step2: a=1, b=2 -> not equal.\n\nBut wait, the example says: \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\". So they eat simultaneously? Actually, the problem says: Alice eats any number from the left (in a row) and Bob from the right. But they are independent? However, the note says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\". So they each eat one candy and then stop? And the total weight: Alice=1, Bob=2 -> not equal? \n\nWait, the example says: \"the answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total\". But the weights are not equal? \n\nI see: the example says: \"There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight\". But 1 != 2. \n\nActually, the example says: \"For the first test case, the candies are [1,2]. Alice eats the left candy (weight=1) and Bob eats the right candy (weight=2). They are not equal? Then why is the answer 2? \n\nBut the note says: \"Note: For the first test case, ... The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\" and the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" meaning they must have the same total weight. \n\nI think I see the confusion: the example says \"Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right\" and then they stop because they have each eaten one candy and the weights are 1 and 2? But that is not equal. \n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"They want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\" So they must have the same total weight. Therefore, the example [1,2] cannot have both eating one candy because 1 != 2. \n\nBut the note says: \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2\". \n\nActually, the sample input and output from the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n4\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n5\n7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n6\n0\n7\n\nSo the first test case: n=2, [1,2] -> output 2.\n\nHow can they eat 2 candies? They must both eat one candy? But then the weights are 1 and 2 -> not equal. \n\nBut note: the problem says \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left\" and \"Bob can eat any number from the right\". They don't have to eat only one. They can choose to eat more? \n\nIn the first test case, they have two candies. The only way to have the same total weight is if they both eat zero? Then the total candies eaten is 0? But the answer is 2.\n\nWait, the note says: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight.\" \n\nBut 1 != 2. \n\nI see the issue: the problem says \"they eat in total\" meaning the total number of candies (which is 2) but the condition is that the total weight must be equal. How can that be? \n\nActually, the problem says: \"they want to be fair\" meaning the total weight each has eaten must be equal. So if they both eat one candy, then Alice has 1 and Bob has 2 -> not equal. So that is not fair. \n\nBut then why is the answer 2? \n\nWait, the sample output for the third test case is 0: \n  \"For the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is 0\"\n\nSo for the first test case, they must have eaten the same total weight. How? \n\nAnother possibility: they don't have to eat the entire set? They can choose to eat a subset. In the first test case, if Alice eats the left candy and Bob eats the right candy, then the total weight for Alice is 1 and for Bob is 2 -> not equal. So that is invalid. \n\nBut then what is the valid scenario for the first test case? \n\nThe problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" meaning she must eat a contiguous segment from the left. Similarly for Bob from the right. And they cannot overlap.\n\nSo the entire set of candies is [1,2]. The only possibilities:\n  - Alice eats 0, Bob eats 0: total candies=0, and weights 0==0 -> valid. But then the total candies is 0, not 2.\n  - Alice eats 0, Bob eats 1: then Bob eats [2] -> weights: Alice=0, Bob=2 -> not equal.\n  - Alice eats 0, Bob eats 2: then Bob eats [2,1]? but from the right: first the rightmost (2) then the next (1) -> but then Bob has 2+1=3. Alice=0 -> not equal.\n  - Alice eats 1: [1], Bob eats 0: -> 1 vs 0 -> not equal.\n  - Alice eats 1: [1], Bob eats 1: [2] -> 1 vs 2 -> not equal.\n  - Alice eats 1: [1], Bob eats 2: [2,1] -> but then Bob eats the candy that was the left one? But Alice already ate the left one? So they cannot both eat the same candy. So Bob cannot eat the left candy because it's already gone.\n\nSo the only valid scenario with non-zero candies is when they both eat one candy? But that is not fair. \n\nBut the problem says: \"the answer is 2\". \n\nI see the note: \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\" \n\nThis implies that they do eat two candies. And the problem says they are fair. \n\nSo the only possibility: they both eat the entire two candies? But then Alice eats [1,2] and Bob eats nothing? Or Bob eats [2,1] and Alice nothing? But that would be overlapping. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that they are eating simultaneously and independently? But the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa)\".\n\nSo the entire set of candies is partitioned: some prefix (for Alice) and some suffix (for Bob) and they don't overlap. \n\nIn the first test case, if Alice eats the entire set: [1,2] and Bob eats nothing, then Alice=3, Bob=0 -> not equal. \nIf Bob eats the entire set: [1,2] (from the right: first 2 then 1) -> Bob=3, Alice=0 -> not equal.\nIf Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [2] -> 1 and 2 -> not equal.\n\nBut wait, what if they both eat the same candy? That is not allowed.\n\nSo how can the answer be 2? \n\nI see: the problem says \"the maximum number of candies they can eat in total\" meaning the total count of candies eaten by both. And they must be fair (same total weight). \n\nBut in the first test case, the only way to have the same total weight is if they both have 0. Then the total candies eaten is 0. \n\nBut the sample output is 2. \n\nThis is a known problem: \"Candies for Two\". In fact, the sample test case 1 is [1,2] and the answer is 2. How? \n\nLooking at known solutions for similar problems (e.g., Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3) - C. Alternating Subsequence) but this is different.\n\nActually, I recall a problem: \"Candies\" in Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3) - C. But that is not the same.\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the note: \"For the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is 2 because they eat two candies in total.\"\n\nThis implies that they do eat two candies and the total weight for Alice is 1 and for Bob is 2? But that is not equal. \n\nUnless the problem does not require that the total weight is the same? But the problem says: \"they want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies.\"\n\nSo I must be missing something.\n\nAnother possibility: the problem allows them to exchange information and choose arbitrarily which candies to eat, but the catch is that Alice eats a contiguous segment from the left and Bob eats a contiguous segment from the right, and they can choose how many to eat arbitrarily. But they cannot skip: if Alice eats, she must eat a contiguous segment starting from the left, and similarly for Bob from the right.\n\nIn the first test case, if Alice eats the left candy (weight 1) and Bob eats the right candy (weight 2), then the total weight for Alice is 1 and for Bob is 2. But they are not equal. \n\nBut the problem says: \"they want to be fair\". So they would not do that. \n\nSo the only fair way is to not eat any candy? Then the total candies eaten is 0. \n\nBut the sample output is 2.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLooking at the fourth test case: \n  Input: [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> answer=7.\n\nThe note says: Alice eats [7,3,20] (total=30) and Bob eats [10,8,11,1] (total=30). So they eat 3+4=7 candies.\n\nSo the first test case: n=2, [1,2]. How can they get the same total weight? \n  If Alice eats the left candy (1) and Bob eats the right candy (2), then 1 != 2 -> not fair.\n  If Alice eats nothing and Bob eats the entire set: 0 vs 3 -> not fair.\n  If Alice eats the entire set: 3 vs 0 -> not fair.\n  If Alice eats the left candy and Bob eats nothing: 1 vs 0 -> not fair.\n\nBut wait, what if they eat in such a way that the total weight is the same by sharing the candies? The problem does not say they have to eat only from their side without any transfer. \n\nNo, the problem says: Alice eats from the left and Bob from the right, and they cannot eat the same candy.\n\nSo the only possibility is that they both eat exactly the same total weight. \n\nIn the first test case, the only way to have the same total weight is 0. So the answer should be 0? But the sample output is 2.\n\nThis is a known problem: \"Candies\" in Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3), problem C. But the sample input and output do not match.\n\nWait, I found the problem: \"Candies!\" from a contest? Actually, the problem is from a contest and the sample is:\n\nInput:\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n5\n7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n6\n0\n7\n\nBut the first test case is [1,1] not [1,2]! \n\nThe problem statement says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, \u2026, wn (1\u2264wi\u226410^4)\" and the first test case has n=2, and then two integers. In the example note, it says for the first test case: Alice eats one from the left and Bob eats one from the right -> then they both have 1. So the candies are [1,1].\n\nSo the first test case is [1,1], not [1,2]. \n\nThe problem statement in the note says: \"For the first test case, ... The answer is 2\", and then for the second test case: [1,2,3] -> answer=6, which is the entire set because 1+2+3 = 6, and they split: Alice eats [1,2,3] and Bob eats [3,2,1]? But then they would be eating the same candy twice? \n\nNo, the second test case: n=3, [1,2,3]. The note says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\". But 1+2+3=6, not 7. \n\nWait, the note says: \"the first three from the left\" for a set of three candies? That is the entire set. And Bob eats the entire set from the right. But then they are both eating the entire set? That is not possible because the candies are the same.\n\nUnless the note means: \n  Alice eats the first three: [1,2,3] -> total=6.\n  Bob eats the first three from the right: that is [3,2,1] -> total=6.\n  But then they are eating the same three candies? \n\nThis is not possible.\n\nThe note says: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7)\". \n\nBut 1+2+3=6, not 7. \n\nUnless the weights are not [1,2,3]? \n\nThe problem says: \"The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, \u2026, wn\". For the second test case, n=3, and the weights are [1,2,3]? \n\nBut the note says total weight 7. \n\nThis suggests that the weights for the second test case are not [1,2,3] but something else? \n\nLooking at the sample input: \n  \"3\n  1 2 3\"\n\nSo the weights are [1,2,3]. Then the total for Alice if she eats all is 6, and for Bob if he eats all is 6. But then they would have to eat the same set? \n\nThe problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\". So they cannot both eat the same candy.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have the entire set eaten is if one of them eats the entire set and the other eats nothing. Then the totals are 6 and 0 -> not equal.\n\nBut the note says they both eat three candies and have total weight 7? \n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the problem statement: \n  \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\nThis implies the weights are not [1,2,3] but perhaps [1,2,4]? or [2,2,3]? \n\nBut the input specification says: \"the second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, \u2026, wn\" and the example input is \"3\" and then \"1 2 3\".\n\nUnless the example input is different? \n\nThe problem statement says: \n  \"The first line contains an integer t (1\u2264t\u226410^4) \u2014 the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1\u2264n\u22642\u22c510^5) \u2014 the number of candies on the table. The second line of each test case contains n integers w1, w2, \u2026, wn (1\u2264wi\u226410^4) \u2014 the weights of candies from left to right.\"\n\nAnd the sample input is:\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n5\n7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\nSo the first test case: n=2, weights = [1,1] -> then Alice eats one from the left (1) and Bob eats one from the right (1) -> both have 1, and total candies=2.\nThe second test case: n=3, weights = [1,2,3] -> then how do they get 7? \n\nWait, the note says: \"Alice will eat the first three candies from the left\" but there are only three. And \"Bob will eat the first three candies from the right\" which is the entire set. But then they are both claiming the entire set? \n\nThis is not possible.\n\nUnless the note means: \n  Alice eats the first two from the left: [1,2] (total=3) and Bob eats the last two from the right: [2,3] (total=5) -> not equal.\n  Alice eats the first one: [1] (1), Bob eats the last one: [3] (3) -> not equal.\n  Alice eats the first one: [1], Bob eats the last two: [2,3] (5) -> not equal.\n  Alice eats the first two: [1,2] (3), Bob eats the last one: [3] (3) -> equal. Then the total candies eaten is 3 (by Alice) + 1 (by Bob) = 4? But the note says 6.\n\nThe note says: \"They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is 6\". \n\nThis suggests that they eat all candies. But how can they eat all candies and have the same total weight? \n\nIf Alice eats [1,3] and Bob eats [2]? But Alice cannot skip the middle candy. She must eat a contiguous segment from the left. \n\nSo the only contiguous segments for Alice are:\n  [1] -> weight=1\n  [1,2] -> weight=3\n  [1,2,3] -> weight=6\n\nFor Bob, contiguous segments from the right:\n  [3] -> weight=3\n  [2,3] -> weight=5\n  [1,2,3] -> weight=6\n\nNow, we want to partition the candies into two non overlapping sets: a prefix for Alice and a suffix for Bob. And the union might not be the entire set? \n\nFor example, Alice eats [1] (leaving [2,3]) and Bob eats [3] (from the right) -> then the middle candy 2 is not eaten. Then the totals: Alice=1, Bob=3 -> not equal.\n\nAlice eats [1,2] (leaving [3]) and Bob eats [3] -> then Alice=3, Bob=3 -> equal. And the total candies eaten is 3 (by Alice) + 1 (by Bob) = 4. But the note says 6.\n\nThe problem says: \"the most number of candies they can eat in total\". In this scenario, they eat 4 candies. But they could also eat the entire set? How? \n\nIf Alice eats [1,2,3] and Bob eats nothing: then Alice=6, Bob=0 -> not equal.\nIf Alice eats nothing and Bob eats [1,2,3]: then Alice=0, Bob=6 -> not equal.\nIf Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [2,3]: then Alice=1, Bob=5 -> not equal.\nIf Alice eats [1,2] and Bob eats [3]: then 3 and 3 -> valid, total=3+1=4.\nIf Alice eats [1] and Bob eats [3]: then 1 and 3 -> not valid.\n\nSo the maximum total candies is 4.\n\nBut the sample output for the second test case is 6.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nUnless the note is for a different test case? \n\nThe problem says: \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\". \n\nAnd the input for the second test case is n=3 and weights=[1,2,3]. \n\nBut then how is the answer 6? \n\nAnother possibility: the problem allows them to eat the same candy if it is in the middle? But the problem says: \"if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it\".\n\nUnless the entire set is partitioned between Alice and Bob. In the scenario where they eat the entire set, then the candy in the middle must be eaten by either Alice or Bob, but not both. \n\nBut then how can they both have the same total weight? \n\nIf Alice eats [1,2] (weight=3) and Bob eats [3] (weight=3), then the entire set is eaten? No, because the candy 2 is eaten by Alice, and the candy 3 by Bob, but the candy 2 is not the middle? In a set of three: \n  positions: 0:1, 1:2, 2:3.\n  Alice eats from the left: must be [0] or [0,1] or [0,1,2].\n  Bob eats from the right: must be [2] or [1,2] or [0,1,2].\n\nIf Alice eats [0,1] and Bob eats [2], then the entire set is eaten. And the total weight is 1+2=3 for Alice and 3 for Bob. So the total candies eaten is 3 (by Alice: two candies, by Bob: one candy) -> total=3. But the problem says the total number of candies eaten in total is 3, not 6.\n\n The note says: \"the answer is 6 (because they eat six candies in total)\". \n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAfter re\u2010reading the note: \"For the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight 7) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight 7).\"\n\nThis implies that the weights are not [1,2,3] but [ something that sums to 7 on each side ]. \n\nLooking at the sample input: the second test case has weights [1,2,3] -> sum=6, not 7. \n\nSo there is a mistake in the problem statement? \n\nIn the sample input provided in the problem: \n  \"3\n  1 2 3\"\n\nBut the note says the total weight is 7. \n\nThis suggests that the sample input in the note is different. \n\nIn fact, the fourth test case: \n  \"5\n  7 3 20 10 8 11 1\"\n\nWait, n=5 but there are 7 weights? \n\nThe first line is n, then a list of n weights. \n  Test case 1: n=2, weights = [1,1]\n  Test case 2: n=3, weights = [1,2,3]\n  Test case 3: n=4, weights = [1,2,3,4]\n  Test case 4: n=5, weights = [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> but that is 7 weights, not 5.\n\n So the sample input is:\n\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n5\n7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\nThis is invalid because the last test case says n=5 but provides 7 weights.\n\n Unless the '5' is a typo and should be 7.\n\n In the note for the fourth test case: \"Alice will eat candies with weights [7,3,20] and Bob will eat candies with weights [10,8,11,1]\". \n   [7,3,20] -> 7+3+20 = 30\n   [10,8,11,1] -> 10+8+11+1 = 30\n   and the entire set is 7,3,20,10,8,11,1 -> 7 weights.\n\n So the last test case has n=7, not n=5.\n\n Therefore, the sample input should be:\n\n4\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n7\n7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\n So the second test case is n=3, weights=[1,2,3]. \n\n How can the answer be 6 for the second test case? \n\n They cannot eat the entire set because that would require one of them to eat the entire set and the other to eat nothing, and then the totals are 6 and 0 -> not equal.\n\n The only valid partition is Alice eating [1,2] (3) and Bob eating [3] (3) -> total candies = 3 (Alice) + 1 (Bob) = 4.\n\n But the sample output is 6.\n\n This is a known problem: \"Candies and Two Sisters\". But that is not the same.\n\n After research, I recall a problem: \"Candies\" in Codeforces Round #636 (Div. 3), problem C, but that is \"Candies!\" and has to do with a different matter.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be: \n   They are not required to partition the entire set. They can leave some in the middle. \n   The goal is to maximize the total number of candies eaten (by both) while having the sum of Alice's = the sum of Bob's.\n\n In the second test case, if they eat the entire set, then the sums are not equal. But if they eat only part, then we can have at most 4 candies (as above).\n\n But the sample output is 6.\n\n This is a contradiction.\n\n unless the note for the second test case is for a different input. \n\n The problem says: \"For the second test case, ... the answer is 6\". \n\n and the input for the second test case is n=3 and [1,2,3].\n\n But then how to get 6? \n\n Another possibility: the problem is not about partitioning the set, but about time? or the spreading as in program2? \n\n We must solve program1 and program2.\n\n Given the time, I will assume that the sample input for the second test case is not [1,2,3] but [ something else ].\n\n But the sample input is provided as [1,2,3] and the sample output is 6.\n\n This is a known issue in the problem statement. \n\n Alternatively, the problem might allow Alice and Bob to eat from both ends in any order, and they can choose to eat one candy at a time from either end arbitrarily, as long as Alice only eats from the left end and Bob only from the right end. And they stop when the sums are equal. \n\n In this case, for [1,2,3]:\n   They might do:\n     Alice eats the leftmost (1) -> a=1, Bob hasn't eaten.\n     then Bob eats the rightmost (3) -> b=3, then a=1, b=3 -> not equal.\n     then Alice eats the next left (2) -> a=1+2=3, b=3 -> equal. \n     So they have eaten: Alice: two candies, Bob: one candy -> total=3 candies.\n\n But the note says the answer is 6.\n\n If they continue:\n     then Bob eats the next from the right ( which is the only remaining in the middle: 2) -> but then they would be eating the same candy? \n\n So that is not allowed.\n\n Therefore, I think the problem statement has a mistake.\n\n But looking at known solution for a problem with the same sample: \n   for the first test case: [1,1] -> answer=2\n   for the second: [1,2,3] -> answer=0? or 4? \n\n In fact, in the sample output provided in the problem: \n   test1: 2\n   test2: 6\n   test3: 0\n   test4: 7\n\n How can test2 be 6? \n\n unless n=3 is not the second test case in the sample input, but the sample input has:\n   t=4\n   test1: n=2, [1,1] -> 2\n   test2: n=3, [1,2,3] -> 6\n   test3: n=4, [1,2,3,4] -> 0\n   test4: n=7, [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> 7\n\n For test2: n=3, [1,2,3] -> answer=6.\n\n We must output 6 for that test case.\n\n How do known solutions for this problem ( which is a common problem) work? \n\n This is a two-pointer technique to find the maximum number of candies eaten such that the sum of the prefix (eaten by Alice) equals the sum of the suffix (eaten by Bob).\n\n The approach:\n   Let left = 0, right = n-1.\n   Let a = 0, b = 0.\n   Let count = 0.\n   While left <= right:\n        if a < b:\n            a += arr[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            b += arr[right]\n            right -= 1\n        if a == b:\n            count = left + (n - 1 - right)   # because Alice has eaten 'left' candies, and Bob has eaten 'n-1-right' candies.\n\n   Then output count.\n\n But for [1,1]:\n        left=0, right=1.\n        a=0, b=0 -> a>=b is false? or true? -> let's do else: b += arr[1]=1, right=0.\n        then a==b? 0==1 -> no.\n        then left<=right: true.\n        a=0, b=1 -> a< b -> a+=arr[0]=1, left=1.\n        then a==b: 1==1 -> count = 1 + (2-1-0) = 1+1 = 2.\n        then left(1)<=right(0) -> false. -> output 2.\n\n For [1,2,3]:\n        left=0, right=2.\n        a=0, b=0 -> a>=b -> b+=arr[2]=3, right=1.\n        a!=b.\n        a=0, b=3 -> a< b -> a+=arr[0]=1, left=1.\n        a!=b.\n        a=1, b=3 -> a< b -> a+=arr[1]=2, left=2.\n        a=3, b=3 -> count = 2 + (3-1-1) = 2+ (1) = 3.\n        then left=2, right=1 -> exit.\n        output 3.\n\n But the expected answer is 6.\n\n 6 means they ate all 3+3=6? but there are only 3 candies.\n\n unless the '6' is a mistake and should be 3? \n\n But the sample output says 6.\n\n The only way to get 6 is if they ate 6 candies, but there are only 3. \n\n This is not possible.\n\n Therefore, I think the sample output for the second test case is not 6 for [1,2,3] but for a different test case.\n\n Given the provided sample input for the fourth test case: n=7, [7,3,20,10,8,11,1] -> output 7.\n\n In the fourth test case, the answer is 7, which is the total number of candies eaten (3 by Alice and 4 by Bob) -> 3+4=7.\n\n So the answer for a test case is the total number of candies eaten (count, not sum of weights).\n\n For [1,1]: 2 candies.\n For [1,2,3]: ? -> the only valid partition is when a==b, and the maximum count we can achieve is 3 ( as in the two-pointer above) -> but the sample output is 6, which is not 3.\n\n unless the sample test case 2 has n=3 but the weights are not [1,2,3] but [ something else ].\n\n The problem says: \" the second line of each test case contains n integers\"\n\n and the sample input for the second test case is \"1 2 3\", so three integers.\n\n So the only possibility is that the spreading for the second test case is not [1,2,3] but a different tree in program2? \n\n But wait, we have two different programs: program1 and program2.\n\n The user is given two programs to complete.\n\n program1.py is for the candies problem.\n program2.py is for the tree infection problem.\n\n So the sample output for program1.py for the second test case is 6, and for program2.py we have a tree problem.\n\n Therefore, I will complete program1.py as follows:\n\n   We use two pointers (left and right) and simulate:\n        a = 0, b = 0\n        left = 0, right = n-1\n        count = 0\n        best = 0\n        while left <= right:\n            if a <= b:\n                a += arr[left]\n                left += 1\n            else:\n                b += arr[right]\n                right -= 1\n            if a == b:\n                best = left + (n - 1 - right)   # because left is the next index for Alice, so she has eaten 'left' candies, and right is the next index for Bob, so he has eaten 'n-1-right' candies.\n\n        print(best)\n\n But for [1,2,3] this yields 3, not 6.\n\n unless the sample test case 2 in the input is not [1,2,3] for program1, but the sample input for program1 is:\n        2\n        1 1\n        3\n        1 2 3\n        4\n        1 2 3 4\n        7\n        7 3 20 10 8 11 1\n\n and the expected output is:\n        2\n        6\n        0\n        7\n\n How can [1,2,3] yield 6? \n\n One possibility: the spreading operation in the problem allows them to eat more than once from the same side? \n\n The problem says: \"Alice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row)\" -> so she eats a contiguous segment. Similarly for Bob.\n\n So they each eat only one contiguous segment. \n\n Therefore, the above two-pointer does not simulate that. The above two-pointer is for when they eat one candy at a time, alternating.\n\n But the problem does not say they alternate. They choose independently. \n\n So the solution is to try every possible partition: \n   For i in range(0, n+1): # i: number of candies eaten by Alice\n        a = sum(arr[0:i])\n        for j in range(0, n+1-i): # j: number of candies eaten by Bob from the right\n            b = sum(arr[n-j:n])\n            if a == b:\n                best = max(best, i+j)\n\n But n can be up to 200,000, and the total n over test cases is 200,000, but the sum of n is 200,000, so we can't do O(n^2).\n\n We need an O(n) solution.\n\n We can precompute prefix sums and suffix sums.\n\n Let prefix[i] = sum of arr[0..i-1]\n Let suffix[j] = sum of arr[n-j..n-1]\n\n Then we want to find i and j such that prefix[i] = suffix[j] and i+j <= n (because they don't overlap) and maximize i+j.\n\n How to do that in O(n)? \n   i from 0 to n, j from 0 to n, but we want i+j<=n and also the segments don't overlap: i <= n-j.\n\n So i+j<=n.\n\n We can iterate i from 0 to n, and for each i, we want to find the largest j such that j<=n-i and suffix[j] = prefix[i].\n\n But note: j cannot exceed n-i (because then the segments would overlap).\n\n We can precompute a mapping from suffix_sum to the maximum j (or the maximum j for that suffix_sum) for j in [0, n].\n\n However, the sum might be large (up to 2e9) but the number of distinct suffix sums is O(n) and n<=200000.\n\n Alternatively, we can do a two-pointer:\n\n   i = 0, j = 0 ( here j is the number of candies from the right)\n   best = 0\n   current_left = 0\n   current_right = 0\n   for i in range(0, n+1):\n        if i>0:\n            current_left = prefix[i]   # which is sum of [0, i-1]\n        # now we want to find the largest j such that j<=n-i and suffix[j] == current_left, and also j>=0.\n        # but we can move j while current_right > current_left and j>0: decrement j and current_right -= arr[n-j] ( but we are not storing it that way)\n\n Alternatively, we can iterate i from 0 to n, and j from 0 upwards to n-i, and use a dictionary to store the j for a given suffix_sum.\n\n But note: the sum of n over test cases is 200000, but within one test case, n can be 200000, and we iterate i from 0 to n, and for each i we do a lookup in a dictionary -> O(n) per test case, which is acceptable because the sum of n over test cases is 200000.\n\n However, the problem says: \"the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000\", so we can do a loop over n for each test case, and the total will be 200000.\n\n So the plan for program1.py:\n\n   for each test case:\n        n = int(input())\n        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n        # compute prefix sums: prefix[i] = sum of arr[0:i] (i from 0 to n)\n        prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]\n\n        # compute suffix sums: suffix[j] = sum of arr[n-j: n] (j from 0 to n)\n        suffix = [0]*(n+1)\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            suffix[j] = suffix[j-1] + arr[n-j]\n\n        # create a mapping: for the suffix part, for a given sum s, we want the maximum j (number of candies) such that suffix[j] = s.\n        # because we want to maximize i+j, and for a given prefix[i] = s, if we have a suffix[j] = s with j<=n-i, then candidate = i+j.\n        # But note: the segments must not overlap: i cand from left and j cand from right -> we require i<=n-j, which is i+j<=n.\n        # So for a given s, we want the maximum j (<= some limit) such that suffix[j]==s. However, we are iterating i, and j cannot exceed n-i.\n\n        # Instead, we can precompute for each sum s, the list of j's such that suffix[j]==s? But then for each i we would have to binary search for a j<=n-i.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can iterate i from 0 to n, and for each i, we want to know if there is a j in the suffix for the same sum, and j<=n-i.\n\n        # But note: the suffix array is for j in [0, n], and we can create a dictionary: for each sum s, we want the maximum j (<= some value) such that suffix[j]==s. However, we want the maximum j overall for a given s, and then check if that j is<=n-i? But that might not work because the maximum j might be too large (overlap).\n\n        # Instead, we can do: \n        #   Let's create a dictionary that maps s to the maximum j such that suffix[j]==s. But note: for a given s, we want the maximum j (which means the largest number of candies eaten from the right) that yields s. But if we have multiple j for the same s, we take the maximum j.\n\n        #   Then for i in range(0, n+1):\n        #        s = prefix[i]\n        #        if s in dictionary and the stored j0 = dict[s] and j0 <= n-i:\n        #            candidate = i + j0\n        #            best = max(best, candidate)\n\n        #   But is that correct? Consider: \n        #        It is possible that for the same s, there is a j1 < j0 and j0 is the maximum, then we use j0. But is that valid? \n        #        Yes, because if suffix[j0] = s, then we can use j0 and i, and the number of candies is i+j0, and since j0 is the maximum j for s, it gives the maximum i+j for that s.\n\n        #   However, note: it is possible that the maximum j0 might be > n-i, then we cannot use it. But is there a smaller j that also has suffix[j]=s? \n        #        We want the maximum j that is <= n-i. \n\n        #   So we need for each s, the maximum j <= some limit (n-i) such that suffix[j]==s.\n\n        #   This requires a Fenwick tree or segment tree or at least a sorted structure.\n\n        # Given the constraints on the sum of n, and that the total n is 200000, we can do a two-pointer or simply iterate j for the suffix in increasing order of j.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can iterate i from 0 to n, and also iterate j from 0 to n in decreasing order, and use a hash map for the suffix sums encountered for j>=current.\n\n        # But easier: \n        #   Let's create a dictionary for the suffix: for each sum s, we want the maximum j such that suffix[j]==s. This is for the entire suffix array. Then when iterating i, we only consider j up to n-i. But if the maximum j for s is > n-i, then we cannot use it. \n\n        #   But is there a smaller j that also has suffix[j]==s?

The given list parents: for vertex 2, parent = p2, for vertex 3, parent = p3, etc.\n\n   counts[0]=1: this might be for the root? but the root is 1. \n\n   Then for each parent in the list, we do counts[i] += 1.\n\n   So counts[i] is the number of children of node i, but note that the root might not be in the list of parents? \n\n   Actually, the root (1) might appear in the list.\n\n   Example: n=3, parents = [1,1] -> then counts[1] will be 2, and counts[0]=1.\n\n   What is node 0? \n\n   This might be a placeholder. \n\n   Alternatively, the counts[0] might be for the root: but the root has no parent, so it's not in the list. But the root has children. \n\n   So counts should be initialized for the root. The code does counts[0]=1, but then the root is 1, not 0. \n\n   This is a mistake.\n\n   We should do:\n\n        counts = defaultdict(int)\n        # the root (vertex 1) has no parent given, but it has children.\n        # the parents list has the parent for vertex 2 to vertex n.\n        for i in parents:\n            counts[i] += 1\n        # and the root might appear in counts, but what about the root? \n        # the root is vertex 1, and it might be in the parents list.\n\n   But the root has no parent in the list, so we need to count the root's children.\n\n   The code has counts[0]=1. This might be for the root? and then they are using 0 to represent the root? \n\n   But the parents in the list are between 1 and n, so 0 might be an extra node.\n\n   This is not right.\n\n   Alternatively, the counts should be for the out-degree (number of direct children) for each node.\n\n   For the root, it has out-degree = number of times 1 appears in the parents list.\n\n   So we don't need counts[0]. \n\n   But the code does counts[0]=1.\n\n   Then lives = [counts[i] for i in counts] -> this will include counts[0]=1, and counts for other nodes.\n\n   For a tree with n=3, parents=[1,1]: \n        counts[0]=1, counts[1]=2.\n        lives = [2,1] -> then sort: [2,1]\n\n   Then for i in range(len(lives)) which is 2:\n        i=0: lives[0] = 2 - (2-0) = 2-2 = 0.\n        i=1: lives[1] = 1 - (2-1) = 1-1=0.\n        then answer = 2.\n\n   Then while max(lives)>0: not entered.\n\n   output 2.\n\n   But what is the minimal seconds for a tree of 3 nodes (root 1, and two children 2 and 3)?\n\n        Second 0: initially healthy.\n        We can do:\n          Second 1: \n             Injection: we can inject one node. Let's inject the root (1). \n             Then after injection: [1] is infected.\n          Second 2:\n             Spreading: from node 1, we see it has two children. Since at least one child is not infected (actually both are not), we can spread to one child. Let's infect child 2.\n             Then after spreading: [1,2]\n             Then injection: we can inject node 3.\n             So after second 2: [1,2,3] -> done.\n          So 2 seconds.\n\n        But the code outputs 2.\n\n   However, the sample tree in the problem might be more complex.\n\n   The while loop:\n\n        while max(lives) > 0:\n            current_max = -1\n            max_index = -1\n            for i in range(len(lives)):\n                lives[i] -= 1\n                if lives[i] > current_max:\n                    # TODO: update current_max and max_index\n                    current_max = lives[i]\n                    max_index = i\n            lives[max_index] -= 1\n            answer += 1\n\n   In the example above, we don't enter the loop.\n\n   For a tree with n=2: \n        parents = [1]  ( for vertex 2)\n        counts[0]=1, counts[1]=1.\n        lives = [1,1] -> sorted: [1,1]\n        for i in range(2):\n            i=0: lives[0] = 1 - (2-0) = 1-2 = -1.\n            i=1: lives[1] = 1 - (2-1)=0.\n        lives = [-1,0] -> then answer = 2.\n        then while max(lives)>0: no -> output 2.\n\n   But for a tree of 2 nodes:\n        Second 1: inject node 1.\n        Second 2: \n             spreading: node 1 has a child (node 2) -> we can spread to node 2.\n             then done.\n        so 2 seconds.\n\n   But we can do:\n        Second 1: inject node 1 -> [1]\n        then in the spreading phase of second 1: node 1 has a child, so we can spread to node 2 immediately in the spreading phase of second 1? \n        However, the problem says: \"each second you do two operations, the spreading operation and, after that, the injection operation\"\n\n        So in second 1:\n            Initially: [1] is infected (by injection in second 1? not exactly)\n\n        The process:\n            We start with no one infected.\n            Second 1:\n                Injection: we inject node 1.\n                Then after injection, we are done for second 1? and then the spreading phase? \n                But the spreading phase: for each node, if at least one child is infected, we can spread to at most one other child. \n                At the time of the spreading phase in second 1, only node 1 is infected. For node 1, it has a child (node 2) that is not infected, and we can spread to node 2? \n                The condition: \"for each vertex v, if at least one child of v is infected\" -> initially, no child is infected because we just injected node 1. \n                So in the spreading phase of second 1, node 1 has no infected child, so we cannot spread.\n\n            Then at the end of second 1, only node 1 is infected.\n\n            Second 2:\n                Spreading: node 1 has one child (node 2) that is not infected -> condition: \"if at least one child of v is infected\" -> none is infected, so we cannot spread.\n                Injection: we inject node 2.\n\n            So it takes 2 seconds.\n\n        Therefore, the code output 2 is correct.\n\n   The TODO in the while loop is to update current_max and max_index.\n\n   So the missing code is:\n\n        current_max = lives[i]\n        max_index = i\n\n   But note: in the for loop, we are decrementing lives[i] by 1 for every i, and then we check if the new lives[i] is greater than current_max.\n\n   Then after the for loop, we do lives[max_index] -= 1.\n\n   This is because we can do one extra injection? \n\n   Let me simulate a tree that requires more than the initial answer.\n\n   Example: a star with 4 nodes: root 1, and children 2,3,4.\n        parents = [1,1,1] for vertices 2,3,4.\n        counts[0]=1, counts[1]=3.\n        lives = [3,1] -> sorted: [3,1]\n        for i in range(2):\n            i=0: lives[0] = 3 - (2-0) = 3-2=1.\n            i=1: lives[1] = 1 - (2-1)=0.\n        lives = [1,0] -> answer = 2.\n        then while max(lives)>0: \n            current_max = -1, max_index = -1\n            for i in range(2):\n                lives[0] = 1-1 = 0\n                lives[1] = 0-1 = -1\n                then for i=0: lives[0]=0> current_max(-1) -> current_max=0, max_index=0.\n                for i=1: lives[1]=-1 -> not greater.\n            then lives[0] (at index0) is decremented by 1: lives[0] = -1.\n            answer becomes 3.\n\n        output 3.\n\n   Is 3 seconds enough for the star tree?\n\n        Second 1:\n            Injection: inject the root (1). \n            Then spreading: for node 1, it has no infected child (because we just injected it, and its children are not infected) -> so no spreading.\n            State: [1]\n        Second 2:\n            Injection: inject one child, say node 2.\n            Spreading: for node 1, it has one infected child (node 2), so we can spread to one other child, say node 3.\n            State: [1,2,3]\n        Second 3:\n            Injection: inject node 4.\n            or alternatively, in spreading phase of second 3: \n                node 1 has two infected children (2 and 3), so we can spread to node 4.\n            so at the end of second 3: [1,2,3,4]\n\n        So 3 seconds.\n\n   But can we do better? \n        Second 1: inject node 1.\n        Second 2: \n             Injection: inject node 2.\n             Spreading: from node 1, we can spread to node 3.\n        then state: [1,2,3] -> not done.\n        Second 3:\n             Injection: inject node 4.\n        -> 3 seconds.\n\n        or in second 3: \n             without injection, in spreading: node 1 has two infected children (2 and 3), so we can spread to node 4.\n        -> 3 seconds.\n\n   So 3 is minimal.\n\n   Therefore, the code is correct for this example.\n\n   So for program2.py, the TODO is:\n\n        current_max = lives[i]\n        max_index = i\n\n   But note: the for loop is over the entire list, and we are doing lives[i] -= 1 for every i, and then we are also doing an extra lives[max_index] -= 1 after the loop.\n\n   This might be to simulate the injection: the injection can be used to reduce the highest remaining life.\n\n   In the while loop, we are essentially doing one more operation (answer +=1) and within that second, we are doing a spreading that reduces every life by 1 (which might be the natural decay) and then we do one extra injection on the highest life.\n\n   So the TODO is to update the current_max and max_index.\n\n   Therefore, I will output for program2.py the missing code as two lines.\n\n In summary:\n\n   program1.py: missing code in the else branch: \n        a += l.popleft()\n\n   program2.py: missing code in the if condition in the for loop:\n        current_max = lives[i]\n        max_index = i\n\n   But note: in program2.py, the for loop is inside the while loop, and we are decrementing lives[i] by 1 for every i in the for loop. Then we are setting current_max to the new lives[i] (after decrement) and tracking the index of the maximum.\n\n   Then after the for loop, we do lives[max_index] -= 1, which is an extra decrement for the maximum one.\n\n   This is as intended.\n\n   We output in the required JSON format."
